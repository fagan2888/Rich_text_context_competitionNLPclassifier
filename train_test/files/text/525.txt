Use of Health Care Services

Abstract
Background: Expanding insurance coverage is designed to improve access to primary care and reduce
use of emergency department (ED) services. Whether expanding coverage achieves this is of paramount
importance as the United States prepares for the Affordable Care Act.
Objectives: Emergency and outpatient department use was examined after the State Children's Health
Insurance Program (CHIP) coverage expansion, focusing on adolescents (a major target group for CHIP)
versus young adults (not targeted). The hypothesis was that coverage would increase use of outpatient
services, and ED use would decrease.
Methods: Using the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), the years 1992­1996 were analyzed as baseline and then
compared to use patterns in 1999­2009, after the CHIP launch. Primary outcomes were population-
adjusted annual visits to ED versus nonemergency outpatient settings. Interrupted time series were
performed on use rates to ED and outpatient departments between adolescents (11 to 18 years old) and
young adults (19 to 29 years old) in the pre-CHIP and CHIP periods. Outpatient-to-ED ratios were
calculated and compared across time periods. A stratified analysis by payer and sex was also performed.
Results: The mean number of outpatient adolescent visits increased by 299 visits per 1,000 persons (95%
confidence interval [CI] = 140 to 457), while there was no statistically significant increase in young adult
outpatient visits across time periods. There was no statistically significant change in the mean number of
adolescent ED visits across time periods, while young adult ED use increased by 48 visits per 1,000
persons (95% CI = 24 to 73). The adolescent outpatient-to-ED ratio increased by 1.0 (95% CI = 0.49 to
1.6), while the young adults ratio decreased by 0.53 across time periods (95% CI = ­0.90 to ­0.16).
Conclusions: Since CHIP, adolescent non-ED outpatient visits have increased, while ED visits have
remained unchanged. In comparison to young adults, expanding insurance coverage to adolescents
improved use of health care services and suggests a shift to non-ED settings. Expanding insurance
through the Affordable Care Act of 2010 will likely increase use of outpatient services, but may not
decrease ED volumes.

high-quality care in primary care settings will reduce
reliance on emergency departments (EDs).1 Determining
whether expanding coverage achieves this goal of shift-
ing patients to nonemergency outpatient settings is of
paramount importance as the United States prepares to
implement the Affordable Care Act, a landmark initia-
tive to address the uninsured rate in the United States.
In 1997, the State Children's Health Insurance Pro-
gram (SCHIP; when it was reauthorized in 2009, SCHIP
was reidentified as CHIP, but we use the latter acronym
throughout the article to refer to the original program as
well) was enacted as a national initiative to increase insur-
ance among children by providing coverage to children
not historically targeted by Medicaid. As part of the
program, income-eligibility thresholds were increased for
children in all age groups, with the most notable increases
seen in adolescents.2 Through streamlined enrollment and
outreach efforts, the provision of coverage through CHIP
along with Medicaid resulted in a decrease in uninsured
rates among near-poor children.3­6 Since the implementa-
tion of CHIP, several state-level analyses have found that
newly enrolled children have improved access to a usual
source of care and specialty care, as well as preventive care
visits, and have also found higher parental satisfaction with
the quality of health care services.2,7­12 However, previous
state-level analyses of CHIP and its effect on ED use vary
broadly, finding no change,10 to increased use in children
under 5 years old,8 to decreased use.7­9 Analyses using
nationally representative household surveys found that
CHIP increased physician outpatient visits and well-child
encounters from 1997 to 2003; however, concurrent effects
on ED visits were not examined.2,11
Emergency department use is an area of major policy
concern, given the high costs of ED care overall13 and
the potential for newly acquired coverage to lead to
increasing numbers of ED visits at the population
level.14 Therefore, we empirically assessed CHIP, the last
national program that broadly expanded insurance cov-
erage, and its effect on ED and non-ED use, as a natural
experiment. Although CHIP was more narrowly targeted
in its coverage efforts than the Affordable Care Act, it
was similarly directed to provide coverage to populations
predominantly unserved by the private and public cover-
age options available at the time of its enactment.
METHODS
Study Design
This was a retrospective cohort analysis of ambulatory
visits, including ED and non-ED outpatient settings,
using data from the National Ambulatory Medical Care
Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS). The National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) compiles both surveys to
provide comprehensive and nationally representative
data sources regarding ambulatory care use. They are
annual cross-sectional surveys using nationally repre-
sentative probability samples of physician visits to non-
federal clinics and short-stay hospitals.15
ED and Non-ED Outpatient Visits
The NAMCS provides a sample of office-based visits to
private physicians and community health centers, while
the NHAMCS includes visits to hospital-based outpatient
departments and EDs. According to the NCHS, visits
prioritized for data collection are those where direct
patient care is delivered. ED visits and outpatient visits
are available for survey years 1992 through 2009--
permitting assessment of years of use patterns prior to
and after CHIP legislation. Therefore, years 1992 to 1996
were used to establish a baseline utilization trend prior
to the CHIP legislation, which was then compared with
visit patterns in 1999 through 2009. To allow time for
implementation, visits from years 1997 and 1998 were
excluded from analysis.
Data from NAMCS and NHAMCS can be used for
calculation of national estimates,16,17 based on weights
from the NCHS that take into account nonresponse, the
probability of being sampled, and a ratio adjustment for
physicians within the specialty groups. For visits to ED
and hospital-based outpatient departments (i.e., primary
care or subspecialty care settings within hospitals) in
the NHAMCS survey, similar weights are available that
additionally account for the number of hospitals within
the region and annual volume of hospital visits. Accord-
ing to our institutional review board, our study did not
require approval, as the data used are publicly available
and de-identified to prevent linking of information
directly to individual patients.
Measures
The primary study outcomes were population-adjusted
annual visit rates to EDs versus nonemergency outpa-
tient settings, generated from NAMCS and NHAMCS
visit frequencies divided by annual national population
estimates by age group from the U.S. Census Bureau
Current Population Survey. Outpatient visits were
defined as a pooled sample (NAMCS + NHAMCS) of
visits to private physician offices, community health cen-
ters, and hospital-based outpatient departments.
Our population of primary interest was adolescents,
defined here as 11 to 18 years old, based on the Guide-
lines for Adolescent Preventive Services (GAPS),18 and
accounting for age-eligibility criteria for CHIP cover-
age.19 Previous studies highlighted high rates of unin-
sured adolescents20 prior to the CHIP legislation,
particularly among the poor (<100% of the federal pov-
erty level) and near-poor (100% to 199% of the federal
poverty level).21 Several other investigators highlighted
trends of underuse of primary care services for this age
group,22,23 and therefore our analysis was focused pri-
marily on the effect of CHIP on adolescents' trends in
use of health care services.
For purposes of comparison, trends of adolescent
ambulatory care use were compared with those of young
adults 19 to 29 years old. We considered young adults an
ideal comparison group to assess for secular trends, as
this age group is similar to adolescents in terms of general
health and insurance coverage in the pre-CHIP period, yet
was not a primary target for coverage under CHIP.24 The
authors note here that a small group of states used federal
funds allotted under CHIP to cover childless adults, but
the small size of these initiatives related to CHIP overall is
not expected to affect the analysis and would, after all,
bias toward finding no difference between adolescent and
young adult health care use patterns.

Data Analysis
Our analysis includes descriptive statistics of weighted
visits reflecting national estimates by care setting, as
well as a summary of demographics across time peri-
ods. To assess the effect of CHIP policy on trends of
health care use, we performed segmented time-series
analyses25 on use rates of adolescents and young adults
to ED and outpatient settings in the pre-CHIP (1992 to
1996) and CHIP implementation (1999 to 2009) periods.
For the 1992 data set, a weighted estimate variable does
not exist for the NAMCS data set, and therefore this
year was excluded from our analyses of the total
national outpatient visit estimates and time-series
analyses (but included for ED analyses, available from
NHAMCS data).
In addition, we sought to analyze how outpatient use
compares with ED use on a population level. We calcu-
lated a ratio of outpatient-to-ED visits to assess the rela-
tionship of change in annual visits between the two
ambulatory settings, as an informative composite mea-
sure of ED and outpatient visits over the pre-CHIP and
CHIP implementation time periods.
We also calculated the difference between the adoles-
cent and young adult annual visits within the ED and
non-ED outpatient settings for the pre-CHIP and CHIP
implementation periods. This difference-in-difference
analysis allowed us to control for secular trends in the
use of medical services, comparing adolescents
expected to benefit as a group from an expansion of
coverage versus young adults not targeted by CHIP.
Finally, we performed a stratified analysis of trends in
ED and outpatient use by payer and sex.
Linear regression was used to assess the statistical
significance in the change from the pre-CHIP and CHIP
implementation time periods for all primary outcomes:
mean number of annual visits, mean ratio of outpatient-
to-ED visits, and difference-in-difference rates. All
analyses were performed using Stata 12.0 (StataCorp,
College Station, TX), incorporating the complex multi-
stage sampling design and survey weighting estimates
of the NAMCS and NHAMCS survey data.
RESULTS
Patterns of Visits in Pre-CHIP Versus CHIP Periods
Adolescents made an estimated 321 ED visits per 1000
annually during the pre-CHIP era and 316 per 1,000
after implementation. Annual outpatient visits changed
from 1,740 to 2,038 per 1,000 adolescents across time
periods. The proportion of uninsured adolescent visits
decreased from 15% to 6%. Adolescent visits with Med-
icaid/CHIP coverage increased from 18% to 24%
(Table 1).
In contrast, young adults made approximately 429 ED
visits per 1,000 annually pre-CHIP versus 478 per 1,000
during CHIP implementation. For outpatient visits, there
were an estimated 2,099 visits per 1,000 young adults
pre-CHIP versus 2,070 per 1,000 since CHIP. Across time
periods, the proportion of young adult visits where the
patient was uninsured changed from 17 to 14, and visits
with Medicaid/CHIP coverage changed from 18 to 19.
Among adolescents, the mean number of population-
adjusted outpatient visits increased by 299 visits per
1,000 adolescents (95% confidence interval [CI] = 140 to

young adults, there was no statistically significant
increase in outpatient visits over the same time period
(Figure 1). Meanwhile, there was no statistically signifi-
cant change in the mean number of adolescent ED visits
after CHIP implementation (Figure 2). In contrast, the
mean population-adjusted annual number of ED visits
for young adults increased by 48 visits per 1,000 (95%
CI = 24 to 73; Figure 2).
We also perform stratified analysis of the trends in
ED and outpatient use by payer and sex across time
periods (data not shown). For adolescents with Medic-
aid/CHIP coverage, ED visits did not change signifi-
cantly, while outpatient visits increased by 480 per 1,000
adolescents (95% CI = 101 to 857). Concurrent trends in
privately insured adolescent outpatient visits demon-
strated an increase by 364 per 1,000 adolescents (95%
CI = 158 to 569), with a decrease in ED visits by 26 per
1,000 adolescents (95% CI = ­39 to ­12). ED visits by
uninsured adolescents did not change significantly;
however, outpatient visits by uninsured adolescents
decreased by 775 per 1,000 after implementation of
CHIP (95% CI = ­1,070 to ­440).
For comparison, health care use for young adults
with Medicaid/CHIP coverage did not show a statisti-
cally significant change in outpatient visits; however,
ED visits increased by 213 visits per 1,000 young adults
(95% CI = 116 to 310) across time periods. Privately
insured young adult outpatient visits increased by 151
visits (95% CI = 28 to 274), while ED visits did not
change significantly over time. Outpatient visits for
uninsured young adults decreased by 424 visits per
1,000 (95% CI = ­536 to ­311), and ED increased by 132
visits per 1,000 (95% CI = 83 to 181).
Analyses of trends by sex did not show a statistically
significant change in female adolescent ED visits; how-
ever, outpatient visits increased by 306 visits per 1,000
(95% CI = 146 to 464). Similarly, ED visits by adolescent
males did not change significantly, while outpatient vis-
its increased by 304 per 1,000 (95% CI = 124 to 483). As
for young adults during the same time periods, ED
visits increased by 100 per 1,000 young adult females
(95% CI = 60 to 140), without a statistically significant
change in female outpatient visits. There was no statisti-
cally significant change in male ED or outpatient visits
over time.
Changing Ratios of Outpatient-to-Emergency Visits
with CHIP
The outpatient-to-ED visit ratio for adolescents
increased significantly by 1.04 (95% CI = 0.49 to 1.59)
from the pre-CHIP period (ratio = 5.3) to CHIP period
(ratio = 6.3; Figure 3). In contrast, the outpatient-to-ED
ratio for young adults decreased significantly by ­0.53
(95% CI = ­0.90 to ­0.16; Figure 3).
Stated another way, with CHIP the difference-in-dif-
ference for adolescents versus young adults was 328
more outpatient visits annually per 1,000 adolescents
(95% CI = 208.96 to 446.02) and 53 fewer ED visits
annually per 1,000 adolescents (95% CI = ­65.30, to ­
40.53; Table 2). These summary comparisons highlight
the diverging health care utilization patterns among
adolescents versus young adults with the implementa-
tion of CHIP.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we sought to evaluate the effect of CHIP on
use of primary, outpatient specialty care, and ED ser-
vices to illustrate the changing demands on the ambula-
tory health care system during an era of health care
coverage reform. Prior to original CHIP legislation,
Newacheck and colleagues26 demonstrated the now-
familiar observation that insured children were more
likely to have contact with physicians, a usual source
care, access to after-hours care, and less unmet need
versus uninsured peers. Similarly, in another analysis
using the National Health Interview Survey, Lieu et al.27
found that adolescents with public and private insurance
had higher numbers of visits for routine care, and a

(defined as 19- to 29-year-olds) mean number of outpatient vis-
its decreased by 28 visits per 1,000 persons annually from pre-
CHIP to post-implementation period (95% CI = ­128 to 70); p-
value not significant. Adolescent mean number of outpatient
visits increased by 299 per 1,000 annually (95% CI = 140 to 457);

greater likelihood of having a usual source of care, com-
pared to their uninsured counterparts.
Our study found, with the implementation of CHIP,
that adolescent overall visits to non-ED outpatient set-
tings have significantly increased, with the predominant
increase seen among adolescents with Medicaid/CHIP
coverage, while ED visit rates have remained relatively
unchanged. Consistent with our study findings, other
investigators have found that doctor visits for nonemer-
gency health care among older children (6 to 17 years
of age) have increased since expanding children's health
care coverage through CHIP.2 Kenney's analysis of
CHIP's effects across 10 states also found that enrolled
children were more likely to have improved access to
private physician offices as their usual source of care.9
Our study builds on this prior work by using a differ-
ent national data source over more years, including the
pre-CHIP era, and dual investigation of the outpatient
and ED settings. The relatively unchanging volume of
ED visits for adolescents after CHIP implementation in
our study is consistent with an analysis of the New York
CHIP program, which did not find a difference in use of
acute care and emergency services one year after
enrollment.10 In contrast, a separate 1-year assessment
of newly enrolled children in a North Carolina CHIP
program found an 11% increase in parents reporting
use of private physicians for acute care and a decrease
in ED visits for older children ages 6 to 18 years whose
only access to the health system or acute care services
was the ED.8 One of the salient aspects of our analysis
is that it is essential to consider that the effect of health
care reform on altering patterns of use requires time to
materialize, and that 1 year is not sufficient to capture
these downstream effects. Therefore, our study adds to
the existing literature by providing insight into the
implications of health care reform on ED trends over a
more extended time period, aggregated at the national
level.
Our results also contribute to the growing, mixed
literature regarding ED patterns after health care cover-
age expansions. An analysis of Massachusetts' 2006
health care reform policy on nonelderly adult ED use at
11 institutions found that the volume of ED visits did
not decrease after implementation of near universal
health insurance coverage.28 In a separate study,
Miller29 performed a county-level analysis of ED visits
to all hospitals in Massachusetts over the years 2002
through 2008 and compared them with visits in Rhode
Island, Vermont, Connecticut, and New Jersey. There
was no comparative reduction in overall ED visits in
Massachusetts when comparing utilization trends
across time periods or between states. In the recent
Oregon health insurance experiment, there was a 35%
increase in use of outpatient care without a significant
difference in ED use among newly enrolled Medicaid
patients.30,31 Meanwhile, an annual survey of nonelderly
Massachusetts adults initiated prior to health reform
implementation noted a decrease in reported ED use in
2010.32 Our findings highlight a central theme in the lit-
erature to date, which is that decreasing ED visit vol-
umes--promoted by some as a benefit of coverage
expansions--may not be realized among populations
that experience new coverage.
ED volume is an important metric, but is only one of
several factors that must be taken into account when
assessing the effects of future health reform initiatives.
To better understand the effects of health care reform
on demand for ED versus outpatient services, it will be

imperative to also assess for changes in admission
rates, diagnoses, and acuity. For example, in one study,
although a reduction in overall ED visits was not
observed, geographic areas with greater increases in
insurance coverage after reform had the largest
decrease in ED visits for conditions classified as nonur-
gent, primary care­treatable, and primary care­prevent-
able, along with an increase in ED visits for
nonpreventable emergencies.29 These findings suggest
that even though ED visits did not decrease in aggre-
gate, the manner in which patients access emergency
services may change. In future studies, we plan to focus
on such granular detail to allow for a better under-
standing of the demands for ED and non-ED health
care services.
Our findings suggest that expanding insurance cover-
age to adolescents improved access to health care ser-
vices and shifted use to non-ED settings. Comparisons
with young adults, a group not targeted by national
coverage initiatives during this same time period,
demonstrated their increasing use of ED services, while
visits to outpatient departments remained relatively flat.
This comparison underscores the importance of the
provision of affordable health insurance in facilitating
access to outpatient health care services overall. With
regard to the trend of increasing ED use for young
adults over time, it is important to consider that this
population may have a higher demand for acute medical
care compared to adolescents. Other investigators have
found that young adults (20 to 29 years of age) were
more likely than children (0 to 18 years of age) to be
seen in the ED for injuries, as well as for noninjury
conditions.33
LIMITATIONS
Our analysis uses CHIP as a natural experiment to
assess the policy effects of prior national initiatives to
expand health insurance on subsequent use of health
care services. In such an observational study, we are
unable to control for potential confounders such as
other secular trends, including the changing influence
of health care management organizations or new pedi-
atric guidelines during this time period, which may be
associated with health care use patterns. Therefore, in
an effort to reveal potential secular trends, we felt it
was important to include the young adults as a control.
We considered the young adult age group to be an
appropriate control group due to their similarities to
adolescents. Persons in the third decade of life are tradi-
tionally healthy and therefore not expected to require
frequent health care visits for chronic disease manage-
ment. They are also similar to adolescents because they
often interface with health care systems for primarily
acute care needs such as injuries. We do, however, rec-
ognize that adolescents and young adults may not
match as well regarding access to motor vehicles, as
well as drugs and alcohol. Increased access to these fac-
tors could contribute to greater risk for injury in the
young adult population and increased likelihood to seek
ED services.
In addition, as an ecologic study using visit-level
aggregate data, we are unable to examine individual-
level variation. Therefore, we are unable to attribute
these trends to individual health care­seeking behav-
iors. Visit-level data are useful in assessing overall
demand for medical services, but do not allow us the
ability to determine whether the trends observed are
from one person who visited several times or several
persons who visited once. Therefore, in an effort to
assess the validity of our results, we also performed
analyses of utilization trends by payer and sex.
Another important consideration is the limited num-
ber of years in the pre-CHIP baseline time period. We
sought to capture simultaneous trends in ambulatory
care use at the population level; however, the sur-
vey years that include both ED and outpatient visits
were limited to 1992 onward.
CONCLUSIONS
Our study highlights the association of the Children's
Health Insurance Program with national patterns of
ambulatory health care utilization. We found in the Chil-
dren's Health Insurance Program target population that
use of outpatient services increased, while ED volumes
did not decrease over time. In this context, the outpa-
tient-to-ED ratio may be an informative measure for
gauging the overall effect of future coverage initiatives
on both ED and non-ED outpatient use.
Understanding population demand for ambulatory
care services and trends related to where patients opt
to seek care can inform interventions to improve coor-
dination and use of health care services. It may also
highlight persistent disparities or barriers that limit use
of primary and preventive care services and contribute
to overreliance on ED services. Developing a better
understanding of patient decision-making and prefer-
ences in changing circumstances of individual coverage
may inform development of patient-centered interven-
tions to address the increasing demand for acute care
services at the population level with national coverage
expansion. Our findings have particular relevance as
our country prepares for a large-scale expansion of
health care coverage. As the implementation of the
Affordable Care Act moves forward, it will be vital to
