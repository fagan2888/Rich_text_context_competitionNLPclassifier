In-Law Preferences in China and in Cyprus:
Differences and Similarities
Yan Wang1 and Menelaos Apostolou2
Abstract
Across different times and cultures, parents exercise considerable influence over their children's mate choices. When they do
so, parents are looking for specific traits in a prospective daughter- and son-in-law. Using a sample of 674 parents, the current
research investigated in-law preferences in China. Participants rated 88 different traits, which were clustered in 10 different
preference domains. In-law preferences were found to be contingent on the sex of the in-law and the sex of the parent. The
data from the current study were compared with data from a different study which took place in the Republic of Cyprus. It
was found that preferences varied in the two samples, but specific cultural differences were identified. It was also found that
for both samples, the 10 different domains clustered in two supra-domains. The first supra-domain, where personality traits
clustered, was preferred more by both Chinese and Greek-Cypriot parents than the second domain, where the rest of the
traits clustered.

Across different times and cultures, parents have been exer-
cising considerable influence over their children's mate
choices. In preindustrial societies, it is usually the case that
parents choose directly spouses for their children through
the institution of arranged marriage (Broude & Green,
1983; Coonz, 2006), while in postindustrial societies, they
influence mate choice indirectly through using manipula-
tion (Apostolou, 2013; Apostolou & Papageorgi, 2014;
Sussman, 1953). To guide their in-law choices, parents
have well-defined in-law preferences (Apostolou, 2007a).
These preferences have been examined in Western postin-
dustrial societies (Apostolou, 2015b) as well as in prein-
dustrial societies (Apostolou, 2010a), but there is limited if
any research in non-Western postindustrial societies.
Accordingly, the first goal of the current study is to exam-
ine in-law preferences in the Chinese culture. Moreover, in-
law preferences are not rigid mechanisms, but adaptable to
the prevailing ecological conditions, which means that cross-
cultural variation is expected (Apostolou, 2014b). Thus, the
second goal of the current study is to examine variation in
in-law preferences between the Chinese and the Greek-
Cypriot culture. We will start by discussing the evolutionary
logic of in-law preferences.
In-Law Preferences
Evidence from anthropological studies on contemporary pre-
industrial societies indicates that parents exercise strong control
over their children's mate choices (Broude & Green, 1983;
Stephens, 1963). In particular, in preindustrial societies which
base their subsistence on hunting and gathering, the most com-
mon mode of long-term mating is arranged marriage, where
parents choose spouses for their children (Apostolou, 2007b).
This is also the case in preindustrial societies that base their
subsistence on agriculture and animal husbandry (Apostolou,
2010b). It is likely that the typical patterns of mating in con-
temporary preindustrial societies have also been typical in
ancestral preindustrial societies (Apostolou, 2014b; Ember,
1978). This argument is consistent with historical evidence,

which indicates that in historical preindustrial societies,
arranged marriage was the typical mode of long-term mating
(Apostolou, 2012). It is also supported by evidence from phy-
logenetic studies which attempt to reconstruct the ancestral
human condition (Walker, Hill, Flinn, & Ellsworth, 2011).
Accordingly, there are good reasons to believe that during
most of human evolutionary time, parents have been facing the
evolutionary problem of choosing beneficial in-laws, that is to
say, to screen prospective daughters- and sons-in-law for those
who had the most beneficial traits. This problem translated into
exercising selection pressure that would favor mechanisms that
enabled parents to perform this screening. Such mechanisms
are in-law preferences: Parents would tend to find fitness-
increasing traits (i.e., traits that would make a positive contri-
bution to the surviving and reproductive success of parents and
their genetic relatives) desirable and fitness-decreasing traits
undesirable (Apostolou, 2007a).
One study examined in-law preferences in 67 preindustrial
societies and identified 13 traits, such as "Good character" and
"Good family background," that parents found desirable in
prospective daughters- and sons-in-law (Apostolou, 2010a; see
also Koster, 2011). Some traits were reported as important
more frequently than others, suggesting that parents had a hier-
archy of importance in their in-law preferences.
In postindustrial societies, studies in the United Kingdom and
the United States found that parents had a well-defined hierarchy
of in-law preferences (Apostolou, 2007a; Perilloux, Fleischman,
& Buss, 2011). However, these studies employed instruments that
were originally developed to study mate preferences and, thus,
could not capture the full range of in-law preferences. To address
this limitation, one study administered an open-ended question-
naire in a sample of Greek-Cypriot families and identified 86
desirable traits (Apostolou,2011). On the basis of anthropological
evidence, a subsequent study added two more traits in this list and
askedasampleofGreek-Cypriotparentstoindicatehowdesirable
they considered each of the 88 traits separately in a prospective
son-in-law and in a prospective daughter-in-law (Apostolou,
2014a). Principal components analysis found 11 trait domains for
a daughter-in-law and a son-in-law.
A larger scale study employed a large sample of Greek-
Cypriot parents who were asked to rate how desirable they
would consider the 88 traits in a prospective spouse for their
children (Apostolou, 2015b). Principal components analysis
revealed 10 in-law preferences domains. This research needs
to be extended, however, because there are only two studies
that have attempted to examine the structure of in-law prefer-
ences, and additional replication is needed. Also, to our
knowledge, there is no study that has attempted to examine
the structure of in-law preferences in non-Western postindus-
trial societies.
Contingencies
Daughters-in-law versus sons-in-law. Men and women differ in
their capacities and in the social goals ascribed to them (Whyte,
1978). For instance, women face menopause, and as a
consequence, their reproductive value declines more sharply
than men's with age (Buss, 2017). To use another example,
across different societies, wealth is controlled predominantly
by men (Whyte, 1978). Such differences suggest that it would
pay for parents to differentiate their preferences depending on
the sex of the in-law. In these examples, it would beneficial for
parents to ascribe more value to youth in a daughter-in-law
than in a son-in-law and more value to wealth in a son-in-
law than in a daughter-in-law. In this way, parents would divert
their limited resources in getting daughters-in-law who are
young and more likely to give them grandchildren and
sons-in-law who control resources and can assist them in their
survival and reproductive effort. Overall, certain traits make
different contributions to the fitness of parents depending on
whether they are found in a daughter-in-law or in a son-in-law.
These differences translate into selection pressures to be
exercised making in-law preferences contingent to the sex of
the prospective in-law (Apostolou, 2007a, 2014b).
Empirical evidence is consistent with this prediction. In pre-
industrials societies, traits such as "Good economic prospects"
and "Wealthy" were reported as important significantly more
frequently in a son-in-law than in a daughter-in-law (Apostolou,
2010a). On the other hand, "Chastity" was reported significantly
more often in a daughter-in-law than in a son-in-law. Studies in
postindustrial societies found that traits such as wealth and a
good social standing were preferred more in a son-in-law than
in a daughter-in-law, while traits such as good looks and good
housekeeping abilities were preferred more in a daughter-in-law
than in a son-in-law (Apostolou, 2007a, 2014b).
Mothers versus fathers. Certain traits in a prospective in-law are
likely to give different fitness benefits to fathers and mothers.
For example, due to internal gestation, women are more certain
than men that their children are actually their own (Buss,
2000). Accordingly, if a prospective in-law harms their chil-
dren and grandchildren, the fitness cost would be potentially
higher for mothers than for fathers, as the former are more
certain that their children and grandchildren are actually their
own (Apostolou, 2015a, 2016b). Thus, traits such as kindness
and emotional stability, which predict how well a prospective
in-law will treat their children, could be more fitness increasing
for mothers than for fathers. In this respect, selection pressures
may have resulted in in-law preferences diverging depending
on the sex of the in-law. However, since most of the traits in a
prospective in-law are expected to give the same benefits to
both parents, mothers' and fathers' preferences are predicted to
overlap considerably (Apostolou, 2007a).
Most studies in postindustrial societies found almost a com-
plete overlap in preferences between mothers and fathers
(Apostolou, 2007a; Perilloux et al., 2011). One study, however,
found that "From a wealthy family" and "Wealthy" traits were
preferred more by fathers than by mothers, while mothers val-
ued kindness in a prospective son-in-law more than in a pro-
spective daughter-in-law (Apostolou, 2016a). Thus, additional
studies are required in order to examine the degree that moth-
ers' and fathers' preferences overlap.
2 Evolutionary Psychology
Cultural variation. The prevailing evolutionary conditions affect
the importance of traits in an in-law. For instance, if in a given
context there is very limited surplus wealth, the wealth an
individual possesses is of little relevance to parents. In a dif-
ferent society, where much surplus wealth is produced and is
unequally distributed, the wealth an individual possesses is of
much higher importance to parents. The ecological conditions
that parents found themselves into during human evolutionary
time were, most likely, not static which means that the fitness
contribution of different traits would vary. For instance, a
period of plague would increase considerably the fitness value
of being healthy in an in-law, while following the end of the
plague, its fitness value would decrease. In the same vein, in a
period of war, the fitness value of traits such as physical
strength would increase and the same value would decrease
following a period of peace.
Consequently, it would not be optimal for parents to have
evolved rigid in-law preferences, that is, to prefer specific traits
irrespectively of the prevailing conditions. It would be more
optimal for parents to have evolved dispositions that would
enable them to prefer fitness-increasing traits in a prospective
in-law, but these preferences would be flexible and adjustable
to local conditions. This being the case, parents would share a
similar structure of in-law preferences across different cultures
--they would prefer the same basic traits, but the weights they
ascribe to each trait would differ.
One study examined differences in preference between pre-
industrial societies of different subsistence types (Apostolou,
2010a). Comparison between societies which based their sub-
sistence on hunting and gathering with societies that based
their subsistence on agriculture and animal husbandry indicated
that being wealthy and coming from a good family background
were reported more frequently as important in the latter than in
the former. To our knowledge, there has not been any study
that attempted to examine cross-cultural variation among post-
industrial societies.
Overall, although our understanding of in-law preferences
has increased considerably over the last years, there are
considerable gaps in the literature. To begin with, in-law pre-
ferences have not being investigated in non-Western postindus-
trial societies. In addition, there has been only one attempt to
examine the structure of in-law preferences, and additional
replication is needed. Last but not least, there has not been any
attempt to examine variation in in-law preferences across dif-
ferent postindustrial societies. The current article contributes in
closing the gap to our knowledge by examining in-law prefer-
ences in China and comparing these findings with the findings
of a different study on in-law preferences in the Republic
of Cyprus.
More specifically, on the basis of the evolutionary frame-
work developed above, we can make the following predictions:
(a) Chinese parents would have a well-defined hierarchy of in-
law preferences; (b) these preferences would be contingent on
the sex of the in-law; (c) Chinese fathers and mothers would
have largely overlapping in-law preferences, but there would
be specific differences; and (d) the structure of Chinese and
Greek-Cypriot in-law preferences would be similar, but there
would be differences, reflecting predominantly ecological dif-
ferences between the two cultural settings.
Method
Participants
The participants of the study completed an online survey. More
specifically, we recruited students registered in courses in psy-
chology in a Chinese university, who contacted their parents
about taking part in a research on mate and in-law choice.
Parents who agreed to participate were forwarded the link of
the study. To distinguish between couples, each family was
ascribed a number, and participants would enter this number
when answering the survey.
Each participant received a certain payment after complet-
ing the survey (i.e., 3.0 ¥,yuán). Overall, 674 Chinese parents
took part in this research (345 women, 329 men). The mean
age of mothers was 46.57 (SD = 3.99, range = 32), and the
mean age of fathers was 48.50 (SD = 4.19, range = 38). All
parents had only one child. The male children had a mean age
of 21.78 (SD = 3.28, range = 18). The female children had a
mean age of 20.11 (SD = 2.13, range = 17).
Moreover, 13.2% of the participants lived in a rural area,
25.5% lived in a small town, and 61.3% lived in an urban area.
With respect to education, 11.0% of participants had completed
secondary school, 28.6% graduated from a high school, 51.6%
had a bachelor degree, and 8.8% had a postgraduate degree.
Finally, all of the participants were married.
Materials
The survey had two parts. In the first part, participants were
asked to fill their demographic information (such as sex, age,
educational level, marital status, and sex of child). In the next
part, the participants were asked to rate how desirable they
considered a set of 88 traits in the prospective child-in-law,
using a 4-point Likert-type scale (0 = unimportant, 1 = some-
how important, 2 = important, 3 = indispensable). The 88 traits
to measure in-law preferences have been identified by previous
research (Apostolou, 2011). Please note that the order of pre-
sentation of the 88 traits was randomized across participants.
Results
In order to classify traits in broader preference domains, princi-
pal components method for factor extraction and direct
oblimin as the rotation method were used. Direct oblimin was
chosen because the assumption of noncorrelated preferences was
unlikely to hold (Field, 2013). The results suggested a 10-factor
solution (eigenvalue > 1), and the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin (KMO)
statistic was .97, indicating a very good sample adequacy. The
factors and the respective loadings were presented in Table 1.
The scales produced by this procedure were checked by means
of reliability analysis. The internal consistency (Cronbach's )
ranged from .71 to .94, with a mean of .84.
Wang and Apostolou 3
In order to construct a hierarchy of preferences, we estimated
the means and standard deviations for each extracted factor by
summing the traits that composed each factor and dividing them
by their number. The results were presented in Table 2. The "Reli-
able," "Family oriented," and "Kind and understanding" topped
participants' preferences. The "Strong personality," "Exciting per-
sonality," "Well-off," and "Good cook­housekeeper" were found
in the middle of the hierarchy. Finally, the "Chastity," "Good
looks," and "Similar religious and ethnic background" were found
at the bottom of the preferences hierarchy.

were in agreement over what they looked for in a prospective
in-law, we run a series of Doubly Multivariate Analysis on
each extracted factor. This analysis was similar to multivariate
analysis of variance, but it allowed the independent factors to
be within subsects. In this case, because the current study
employed a within-family design, the answers of mothers and
fathers should not be considered independent, and participants'
sex needed to be treated as a within-subjects factor. Also, par-
ticipants gave ratings only for one in-law (e.g., son-in-law), so
the sex of the in-law would be treated as a between-subjects
design. Accordingly, the traits that composed each factor were
entered as the dependent variables, and the sex of the in-law
was entered as the independent between-subjects factor, and
the sex of the parent was entered as the within-subjects inde-
pendent factor. Overall, 10 tests were performed. Multiple tests
were likely to inflate the  level. Accordingly, Bonferroni cor-
rection should be applied to reduce  to .005 (.05/10). The
results were presented in Table 2.
Daughters-in-law versus sons-in-law. In most cases, the sex of the
in-law came significant with a large effect size. An examina-
tion of the means for the significant domains indicated that
these traits were preferred more in a son-in-law than in a
daughter-in-law. The exception was the "Good looks," where
the means overlapped. In this case, the significant difference
came predominantly from the "Tall" and the "Athletic" com-
ponents of this domain that were preferred more in a son-in-law
than in a daughter-in-law.
These findings were inconsistent with our original predic-
tions. In particular, we predicted that certain traits would be
preferred more in son-in-law and others more in a daughter-in-
law, but we found that most traits were preferred more in a son-
in-law than in a daughter-in-law. We believe that this finding
could be explained by the unbalanced sex ratio currently pre-
vailing in China. More specifically, the one-child policy pre-
vented parents from having more than one child, and most
parents favored male children, resulting in more young men
to be available as grooms and fewer young women available as
brides (Deng, 2000). Such difference allowed parents with
daughters to be more selective than parents with sons, which
was reflected in the stronger preferences for sons-in-law.
This argument is consistent with the argument that in-law
preferences are adjustable to prevailing conditions (here, the
unbalanced sex ratio). However, the unbalanced sex-ratio effect
may have potentially masked evolved in-law contingencies. Par-
ents may have evolved to prefer certain traits more in a daughter-
in-law than in a son-in-law, but the unbalanced sex ratio resulted
in parents placing extra weight to the ones in a son-in-law
which, in turn, could result in these traits not to come significant
**and/or to come significant in favor of sons-in-law.
We can apply a simple way to remove the unbalanced sex-
ratio effect, so that we can better examine the contingencies in
in-law preferences. More specifically, in a balanced sex-ratio
scenario, the overall preference strength would be the same for
daughters- and sons-in-law. The observed divergence in prefer-
ences would be due to the unbalanced sex-ratio effect, so if this
difference could be estimated, it could be removed from the data.
For this purpose, we added all scores for the 88 traits that parents
gave for a son-in-law and all scores they gave for a daughter-in-
law, and we divided them by their number. The grand mean for a
son-in-law was 1.92 (SD = .35) and for a daughter-in-law 1.80
(SD = .44). The difference between the two was .117 units in our
4-point scale. On this basis, we can assume that the unbalanced
sex-ratio effect resulted in in-law preferences for parents with
daughters to increase by about .117 units.
We have deducted from all the scores for a son-in-law the
.117, and we have repeated the analysis above. The results
were presented in Table 2. We can see that the "Reliable" and
the "Family oriented" came no longer significant. The "Good
looks" came significant, but this time because most of the
composing traits were preferred significantly more in a daugh-
ter- than in a son-in-law.

Mothers versus fathers. Moving on to fathers and mothers, there
was considerable agreement between the two, as only 2 of the
10 domains were preferred differently. For the "Strong person-
ality," the "Intelligent," "Dynamic," and "Longsighted" sub-
components were preferred more by mothers than by fathers.
For the "Well-off," the "Good provider" and the "Educated"
were preferred more by mothers than by fathers, while the
"Good economic prospects" was preferred more by fathers than
by mothers.
In addition, a significant interaction was found between the
sex of the parent and the sex of the in-law, F(1, 335) = 8.12,

Cultural Effects and Similarities
In order to examine cross-cultural difference and similarities in
preferences, we employed evidence from a study conducted in
the republic of Cyprus. More specifically, this study employed
evidence from Greek-Cypriots parents to rate the same 88 traits
we employed here, in a prospective daughter- or son-in-law
(Apostolou, 2015b).
We can start by comparing the factor structure derived here,
with the factor structure derived in Apostolou (2015b) study.
The factor structure was very similar across the two groups.
More specifically, the "Family oriented," "Good looks,"
"Exciting personality," "Good cook­housekeeper," and "Simi-
lar religious and ethnic background" were found in both set-
tings. The "Kind and understanding" found here was very
similar to the "Kind, understanding, and cooperative," with the
main difference being that the cooperative component did not
load here. The "Reliable" found in the current study was very
similar to the "Reliable and tolerant" but without the tolerant
component to load in the Chinese case. Moreover, the "Well-
off" was similar to the "Good economic prospects," with the
difference that the family background components did not load
to the latter. Also, there was overlap between the "Strong
personality" and the "Spontaneous and selfless." The "Well-
off" family background found in the Apostolou (2015b) study
was not found here, but it seemed to have been integrated to the
"Well-off" domain. Finally, the "Chastity" found in the current
study was not found in the Apostolou (2015b) study, but it was
found in the Apostolou (2014a) study which also employed a
Greek-Cypriot sample. Overall, although there are differences,
the structure of in-law preferences appears to be very similar in
the two cultures.
We can now proceed to investigate cultural differences in
more detail. In order to make comparisons possible, we needed
to employ a common factor structure, and for this purpose, we
used the factor structure produced for the Chinese sample.
Accordingly, we estimated the means and standard deviations
for the Greek-Cypriot sample, and we ranked them next to the
Chinese sample (Table 3). In order to examine similarity, we
applied Spearman's correlation between the ranks for each
sample. The correlation was significant and very strong,
r(10) = .939, p < .001 (two tailed), suggesting that the hierarchy
of in-law preferences across the two samples was very similar.
In order to examine differences further, we applied Doubly
Multivariate Analysis on each domain. In particular, the traits
composing each factor were entered as the dependent variables
and the sex of the in-law and the sample (Chinese/Greek-
Cypriot) were entered as the between-subjects factors and the
sex of the parent as the within-subjects factor. Please note that
in the Greek-Cypriot sample, if parents had two adult children
of different sexes, they would give ratings for both prospective
daughters- and sons-in-law. In order to make comparisons
between samples possible, we dropped these cases (about 8%
of the Greek-Cypriot sample). The results of this analysis were
presented in Table 3.
We can see that the sample came significant in all cases. The
"Reliable" and the "Kind and understanding" were preferred
more by the Chinese than by the Greek-Cypriot parents. For
the "Family oriented," the means overlapped; the results indi-
cated that the "Wants children," "Loves children," and "Good
parent" subcomponents were preferred more by Greek-Cypriot

parents, while the "Family oriented" and the "Healthy" sub-
components were preferred more by Chinese parents. The
remaining seven domains were preferred more by Greek-
Cypriot than by Chinese parents.
The effect sizes indicated that the largest difference was
over "Similar religious and ethnic background," where Chinese
parents indicated a very weak interest in comparison to Greek-
Cypriot parents. The second largest difference was over
"Strong personality" which was considered important in both
cultures, but as more important in the Greek-Cypriot culture.
Moreover, for 6 of the 10 domains, a significant interaction
was found between the sex of the in-law and the sample. We
have plotted the interaction using grand means (i.e., adding
the domains together and dividing them by their number) in
Figure 1. We can see that the interaction came predominantly
from Chinese parents giving higher scores for prospective
sons-in-law than for prospective daughters-in-law, which was
not the case for Greek-Cypriots. Finally, significant interactions
between the sample and the sex of the parent were found for
the "Well-off" and the "Strong personality." In these cases,
when we moved from the Chinese to the Greek-Cypriot sam-
ple, the scores increased for both parents, but more for fathers
than for mothers.
Second-order factor structure. We would like to examine whether
the 10 different domains clustered in even broader supra-
domains. For this purpose, we applied second-order principal
components analysis. In particular, we estimated 10 new vari-
ables by summing and dividing by their number the traits that
composed each domain. We subsequently applied principal
components analysis on these variables, with direct oblimin
as the rotation method. We performed this analysis twice, once
for the Chinese sample and once for the Greek-Cypriot sample.
For the Chinese sample, the results suggested a two-factor
solution (eigenvalue > 1), and the KMO statistic was .88,
indicating a very good sample adequacy. The scales produced
by this procedure were checked by means of reliability analy-
sis. The internal consistency (Cronbach's ) was .91 for the
first supra-domain and .81 for the second. For the Greek-
Cypriot sample, the results also suggested a two-factor solu-
tion. The KMO statistic was .82, and the internal consistency
was .94 for the first supra-domain and .76 for the second. The
supra-domains and the respective loadings were presented
in Table 4.
The personality domains clustered in the first supra-domain,
while the rest of the traits clustered to the second supra-
domain. In order to assess importance, we estimated the means
for each supra-domain. For the Chinese sample, the personality
supra-domain was considered more important (M = 2.17,
SD = .32) than the other traits supra-domain (M = 1.36,
SD = .42). This was also the case for the Greek-Cypriot sample
(M = 2.14, SD = .38; M = 1.68, SD = 041). These findings can
be interpreted to indicate that parents cared predominantly
about the personality of their prospective in-laws and second-
ary about the rest of their prospective in-laws traits.
In order to examine contingencies in these factors, we run
a four-way mixed design analysis of variance, where in-law
preferences were entered as the dependent variable, the sex of
the parent and the domain type were entered as the within-
subjects factors, and the sample (Chinese/Greek-Cypriot) and
the sex of the in-law were entered as the between-subjects
factors. The results indicated several significant interaction
and main effects.
To begin with, there was a significant main effect of the sex
of the parent, F(1, 627) = 84.14, p < .001, 2
p
= .118, where
mothers gave overall higher scores (M = 1.86, SD = .39) than
fathers (M = 1.81, SD = .40). This difference was present for
the Chinese sample (mothers: M = 1.80, SD = .41; fathers:
M = 1.73, SD = .41) as well as the Greek-Cypriot sample
(mothers: M = 1.91, SD = .36; fathers: M = 1.88, SD = .38).
Moreover, there was a significant main effect of the domain,
F(1, 627) = 1,845.79, p < .001, 2
p
= .792, where the person-
ality supra-domain was preferred more (M = 2.16, SD = .35)
than the other traits supra-domain (M = 1.51, SD = .44). The
effect size was very large, suggesting considerable divergence
in preferences. In addition, there was a significant main effect
of sample, F(1, 627) = 31.48, p < .001, 2
p
= .048, where the
Chinese parents gave lower overall score (M = 1.76, SD = .34)
than the Greek-Cypriot parents (M = 1.90, SD = .33).
There was a significant interaction between the sample and
the domain, F(1, 627) = 154.17, p < .001, 2
p
= .197, where for
the personality supra-domain, Chinese and Greek-Cypriot par-
ents gave similar scores. However, when we moved to the
other traits supra-domain, the scores of both parents decreased,
but the scores of Chinese parents decreased more than the
scores of Greek-Cypriot parents. There was a significant
three-way interaction between the sample, the sex of the
Figure 1. The figure depicts the interaction between the sample and
the sex of the in-law. We can see that when we moved from a son-in-
law to a daughter-in-law, the scores of Chinese parents decreased
considerably, but the scores of Greek-Cypriot parents remained
relatively unchanged.

in-law, and the domain, F(1, 627) = 17.52, p < .001, 2
p
= .027,
where the same interaction as before was observed, but the
decrease in scores when we moved to the other traits supra-
domain was much more pronounced in the case of a daughter-
in-law than in the case of a son-in-law, predominantly because
Chinese parents lowered considerably more their scores for a
daughter-in-law (Figure 2).
There was a significant interaction between the sex of the
in-law and the domain, F(1, 627) = 36.52, p < .001, 2
p
= .055,
where for the other traits supra-domain the scores for the two
in-laws were similar, but when we moved to the personality
supra-domain, the scores increased more for a son-in-law
than for a daughter-in-law. In addition, there was a significant
interaction between the sex of the parent and the domain,
F(1, 627) = 102.21, p < .001, 2
p
= .140, where the scores
decreased when we moved from mothers to fathers and
decreased more for the other traits supra-domain than for the
personality supra-domain.
Finally, there was a significant three-way interaction
between the sex of the parent, the sex of the in-law, and the
domain, F(1, 627) = 14.14, p < .001, 2
p
= .022, where, as
above, for the other traits supra-domain the scores for the two
in-laws were similar, but when we moved to the personality
supra-domain, the score increased more for a son-in-law than
for a daughter-in-law. This increase was more pronounced for
fathers than for mothers.
Discussion
Our results indicate that parents in China had a well-defined
hierarchy of in-law preferences. Their preferences were con-
tingent on the sex of the in-law, while mothers and fathers had
largely overlapping preferences. In-law preferences were also
found to be contingent on the cultural context, as comparisons
between the Chinese and Greek-Cypriot samples indicated con-
siderable similarities but also specific differences.
In more detail, the primary concern of Chinese parents was
the personality of their prospective in-laws. The first 5 of the
10 preferences domains referred directly to personality and
clustered to a single personality supra-domain. This is not
surprising, as personality predicts a wide range of human
conduct (Buss & Hawley, 2010) which is relevant to in-law
choice (Apostolou, 2014a). Reliability ensures that parents
have in-laws who will be consistently there for them and their
family, kindness ensures that in-laws will treat parents and
their children well, family oriented ensures stability in mar-
riage, strong personality ensures success in fitness-increasing
goals, and exciting personality ensures successful integration
to the family unit.
Figure 2. The figures depict the three-way interaction between the domain type, the sample, and the sex of the in-law. We can see the first
supra-domain the scores of Chinese and Greek-Cypriot parents converged. However, when we moved to the second supra-domain the
scores decreased, but more for the Chinese than for the Greek-Cypriot parents. This decrease was more pronounced for a daughter-in-law
than for a son-in-law, that is to say, the scores of Chinese parents dropped more sharply in the former than in the latter case.

Parents also cared to have in-laws who were well-off and
came from well-off families and could bring to their family
unit monetary resources. The well-off domain was in the mid-
dle of the in-law hierarchy, below personality traits, indicating
that Chinese parents valued personality more than wealth and
family background. One possible explanation is that person-
ality constitutes a more reliable predictor of resources than the
actual resources one controls, as money can be spent or lost,
but personality traits that lead to money making cannot.
Moreover, in the Chinese context, as well as in other post-
industrial societies, families are relative independent, so alli-
ances with other families become less important than in a
preindustrial context.
The looks of a prospective in-law did not appear to be
important for parents. Similarly, parents did not care about
similarity in ethnic and religious background, which was
located at the bottom of the in-law preferences hierarchy.
Other studies have found that similarity was important for
parents, one reason for this being that it enables effective
integration to the family unit (Apostolou, 2014b). This find-
ing should not be interpreted, however, as indicating that
Chinese parents did not look for similarity, but that they did
not look for similarity in these traits. We believe that the main
reason for this finding is that China is relative homogenous in
terms of ethnicity and religion, so prospective in-laws are
unlikely to vary in these dimensions, turning them irrelevant
to in-law choice.
Moreover, it was found that parents gave higher scores for
their prospective sons-in-law than for their prospective
daughters-in-law. We have argued that this difference was due
to the unbalanced sex-ratio effect; that is, the one-child policy
in China has resulted in more young men than young women
to be available as spouses, which allowed parents with daugh-
ters to be more selective than parents with sons. This finding
indicates that in-law preferences can adjust to local condi-
tions. This being the case, we can predict that this effect will
reside in the future. In particular, the one-child policy has
been recently relaxed (see the Communist Party of China the
fifth Plenary Session of the 18th CPC Central Committee
Bulletin, 2015), which is likely to lead to a more balanced
sex ratio that, in turn, will result in parents with daughters not
being able to be that selective.
The unbalanced sex-ratio effect has probably masked
evolved contingencies in in-law preferences. Accordingly,
we have attempted to remove this effect from the data. We
found that when doing so, good looks were preferred more in
a daughter-in-law than in a son-in-law, while being reliable
and family oriented was valued the same in both in-laws. Yet,
on the basis of previous research and evolutionary theorizing
(Apostolou, 2007a, 2014a; Perilloux et al., 2011), we would
expect that chastity and housekeeping/cooking capacities
would be preferred more in a daughter-in-law than in a son-
in-law, but such sex differences were not found. We have to
say that our method of removing the unbalanced sex-ratio
effect was crude, and this may explain the nonsignificant
differences. Future research may attempt to control better this
effect, by replicating this study in areas of China where the
sex ratio is balanced.
The preferences of mothers and fathers largely overlapped.
In the cases where differences were found, mothers gave higher
scores than fathers. In addition, the aggregate scores of mothers
were significantly higher than the aggregate scores of fathers.
One possible interpretation of this difference is that mothers are
more selective than fathers when it comes to in-law choice.
One reason may be the difference in parental uncertainty. Since
mothers are more certain than their children are actually their
own, they may have more at stake in the mate choices of their
children and so they may be more selective over in-law choice
(Apostolou, 2015a). If this difference constitutes an evolved
predisposition, it should also be found in other cultures. Con-
sistent with this prediction, it was also found in both samples,
but more cross-cultural replication is needed.
Comparisons between Chinese and Greek-Cypriot samples
indicated that in-law preferences were very similar across sam-
ples. First-order principal components analysis indicated a very
similar factor structure across samples, and second-order prin-
cipal components analysis indicated an identical factor struc-
ture across the two samples. In addition, correlational analysis
indicated that the hierarchy of in-law preferences was very
similar across the two samples. Yet, specific differences have
been found in the two samples.
The primary differences were that Chinese parents gave
higher scores for their prospective son-in-law than for their
prospective daughters-in-law, and Greek-Cypriot parents
placed considerable more emphasis on the similarity in reli-
gious and ethnic background. Starting from the former differ-
ence, the sex ratio in Cyprus is much more balanced, which
means that, as opposed to Chinese parents with daughters,
Greek-Cypriot parents with daughters could not afford to be
more selective than parents with sons.
Moving on to the second difference, the Republic of Cyprus
is much less homogenous than China in terms of ethnicity and
religion, as there are many different ethnic groups of different
religious backgrounds in the country. Accordingly, marriage
with prospective in-laws of different ethnic and religious back-
grounds is much more probable in Cyprus than in China, which
makes these dimensions much more important in the former
than in the latter. Finally, parents in both cultures converged in
their preferences for the personality supra-domain, but they
diverged for the other traits supra-domain. The latter difference
can be partially explained by the difference in preferences for
similarity over religious and ethnic background. The former
convergence can be interpreted to indicate that the personality
of a prospective in-law is of high fitness relevance for parents
in both contexts.
Consistent with our theoretical framework, our findings sug-
gest that parents share the same basic in-law preferences, but
these preferences adjust to the local conditions. They also sug-
gest that personality is the most important concern for parents
in both prospective daughters- and sons-in-law in a postindus-
trial context. Still, more cross-cultural work and replication is
required in order to reach more definite conclusions.

This work is not without limitations. One advantage of this
research was that it was online, which gave privacy to individ-
uals who, in turn, were more likely to give honest answers
(Kreuter, Presser, & Tourangeau, 2008). The drawback was,
however, that the sample is not representative of the popula-
tion, as people who were younger, more educated, and more
open-minded were likely to be overrepresented (Ross,
Månsson, Daneback, Cooper, & Tikkanen, 2005). Future
studies need to attempt to replicate these findings using
different research methods. Moreover, this is a self-report
study, so there is the possibility that people may behave
differently from the way they have indicated here, when the
situation in question actually arises.
Last but not least, for the purposes of this study, we have
employed an instrument that was developed in a different
cultural context. Thus, although this instrument is inclusive,
there is the possibility that it does not capture preferences for
traits which may have only local relevance. In particular,
there may be traits which are important for Chinese parents,
but which were not present in our instrument, because it has
been developed in a different culture, where they were not
important. Future qualitative research that can construct an
instrument specific for the Chinese cultural context can
address this limitation.
Studying in-law preferences, especially in a non-Western
context, has received little attention from researchers. The cur-
rent article contributes toward closing this gap in our knowl-
edge by providing evidence about in-law preferences and their
contingencies in China, as well as differences and similarities
between Greek-Cypriot and Chinese parents. However, more
research is required in order to fully understand in-law prefer-
ences and how they vary across cultures.
