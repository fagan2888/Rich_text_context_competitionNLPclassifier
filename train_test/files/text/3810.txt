Introduction
Chronic heart failure (HF) is a clinical syndrome affecting
2­3% of the global population.1,2 It is associated with fre-
quent hospital admissions, imposing a vast burden on
industrialised countries.3,4 Standard treatment of HF is
aimed at prolonging life by maintaining physiological sta-
bility.1 It usually involves a complex regimen of daily self-
care behaviours, including pharmacological therapy,
symptom monitoring and lifestyle modifications.
Health-related quality of life (HRQOL) is profoundly
impaired in patients with HF.5 Many patients suffer from
other conditions, including diabetes, anaemia and renal
disease,6 but also from psychological distress.7,8 Patients
with HF are prone to experiencing disabling psychosocial
consequences of their burdening condition, such as social
isolation and fear.9 Several demographic and clinical fac-
tors are known to impact HRQOL, such as younger age,
increased disease severity and poor functional capacity.10

failure: A longitudinal analysis

Abstract
Background: Self-care is assumed to benefit health outcomes in patients with chronic heart failure (HF), but the
evidence is conflicting for health-related quality of life (HRQOL). The aim of this study was to examine the association
of (changes in) self-care with HRQOL while adjusting for psychological distress.
Methods: In total, 459 patients (mean age = 66.1±10.5 years, 73% male) with chronic HF completed questionnaires at
baseline and at 6, 12 and 18 months of follow-up. Self-care and HF-specific HRQOL were quantified with the European
Heart Failure Self-care Behaviour scale and the Minnesota Living with Heart Failure Questionnaire.
Results: Using general linear models, multivariable between-subject (estimate=­0.14, p=0.005) and no within-subject
effects of self-care were found for better HRQOL over time. Associations between self-care and HRQOL were
fully explained by depression (estimate
=
1.77, p<0.001). Anxiety (estimate=4.49, p
<
0.001) and Type D personality
(estimate=13.3, p<0.001) were associated with poor HRQOL, but only partially accounted for the relationship between
self-care and emotional HRQOL.
Conclusions: Self-care was prospectively associated with better disease-specific HRQOL in patients with HF, which
was fully accounted for by depression, and partially accounted for by anxiety and Type D personality. Changes in self-
care within a person did not affect HRQOL. Psychological distress should be considered in future efforts to address
self-care and HRQOL.

It seems likely that self-care would benefit HRQOL, as
it is targeted at reducing HF symptoms in order to improve
the patient's physical condition. However, findings from
previous, primarily cross-sectional and small studies have
yielded inconsistent results,11­14 also when examining the
effects of self-care interventions on HRQOL.15 We there-
fore investigated the longitudinal association of HF self-
care and HRQOL in a large cohort of patients with chronic
HF. We extend previous work by examining whether dif-
ferences in self-care within and between patients were
related to HRQOL over time. Furthermore, as psychologi-
cal distress adversely relates to HRQOL,7,11 we explored
whether depression, anxiety and Type D personality
explained potential relationships between self-care and
HRQOL.
Methods
Patients and procedure
This study is part of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden Heart
Failure Cohort Study. Consecutive patients attending the
outpatient HF clinic of the Elisabeth-TweeSteden teach-
ing hospital (Tilburg, The Netherlands) were approached
for participation in a longitudinal study with five meas-
urement occasions over a total follow-up period of 18
months.16,17 Exclusion criteria comprised: diastolic HF;
age 80 years; a myocardial infarction or hospitalisa-
tion in the month prior to inclusion; a life-threatening
disease with a life expectancy <1 year; serious psychiat-
ric illness except for mood disorders; or insufficient
understanding of and fluency in the Dutch language.
Patients were informed about the study and recruited by
their cardiologist or specialised HF nurse. If patients
agreed to participate, they were called in the same week
to arrange a baseline appointment. At baseline, patients
completed a psychological survey at home, which was
returned in a self-addressed envelope. At 6, 12 and 18
months of follow-up, patients were contacted to com-
plete the psychological survey again. In case of missing
items, patients were contacted by phone or email in an
attempt to obtain the missing answers. If the question-
naire was not returned within 2 weeks, patients received
a reminder telephone call or letter. Of 570 eligible
patients, 465 agreed to participate (81%) and 459 patients
returned the baseline questionnaire. Written informed
consent was obtained from all patients. The study proto-
col was approved by the institutional medical ethics
review boards of all participating hospitals.
Measures
Self-care. The nine-item European Heart Failure Self-care
Behaviour scale (EHFScB-9)18 was administered in order
to assess self-care at baseline and 6, 12 and 18 months of
follow-up. Items were rated on a five-point Likert scale
from 1 (`I completely agree') to 5 (`I completely disa-
gree'). To calculate sum scores, item scores were reversed,
with a possible range of 9­45. Raw sum scores were trans-
formed into standardised scores from 0 to 100, with higher
scores reflecting better self-care.19 This includes a four-
item `consulting behaviour' subscale that measures
whether patients contact their physician in case of a sud-
den increase of the following symptoms: shortness of
breath, ankle swelling, weight gain or fatigue. The remain-
ing items assess how patients judge their adherence to the
most commonly recommended self-care behaviours: daily
weight monitoring, limiting fluids, low-sodium diet, regu-
lar exercise and medication adherence. The internal con-
sistency of the total self-care and its consultation scale
were acceptable (Cronbach's  = 0.79) and good (Cron-
bach's  = 0.87) at baseline, respectively. For descriptive
statistical purposes, we split the person-mean of self-care
(i.e. an individual's self-care scores averaged over all time
points) at the median in order to denote low and high self-
care, as there are no well-validated cut-off values pub-
lished in the literature.
Health-related quality of life.The Minnesota Living with
Heart Failure (MLWHF) questionnaire was administered
in order to assess HF-specific HRQOLat all time points.20,21
The MLWHF is designed to assess the effects of HF symp-
toms, functional limitations and psychological distress on
the patient's quality of life. Twenty-one items are answered
on a six-point Likert scale ranging from 0 to 5. Higher
scores indicate worse HF-specific HRQOL, with a differ-
ence of five denoting a clinically relevant change.22 This
provides a total score that includes additional social, HF-
specific and healthcare-related items, as well as a physical
and emotional dimensional subscale score.
Depression.
The 21-item Beck Depression Inventory
(BDI)23 was used in order to assess depressive symptoma-
tology. This is a well-validated self-report measure and has
been found to be reliable for measuring depressive symp-
tomatology in patients with chronic HF.24 Each item is
rated on a 0­3 scale. A total score is obtained by the sum of
all items. We performed three assessments of depressive
symptoms at baseline and at the 12- and 18-month follow-
up visits. Internal consistency was good at all three meas-
urement occasions, with Cronbach's  being 0.86, 0.83
and 0.82, respectively.
Anxiety. Symptoms of anxiety were assessed with the two
anxiety items (i.e. tension and restlessness) of the Symp-
toms of Anxiety­Depression index (SAD4
), which has
been shown to detect an increased risk of anxiety disorder
in cardiac patients.25 Items are answered on a five-point
Likert scale with a range from 0 (`not at all') to 4 (`very
much'). The internal consistency was high in this study
(Cronbach's  range = 0.87­0.92).
Kessing et al. 607
Type D personality. The 14-item Type D Scale (DS14) was
used in order to assess Type D personality,26 which is
defined as the combination of the negative affectivity
(NA) and social inhibition (SI) personality traits. Individ-
uals with a Type D personality tend to experience negative
emotions across time and situations, and have the ten-
dency of not expressing themselves in social interactions
because of fear of rejection or disapproval by others. Type
D personality has been shown to independently predict
HRQOL27 and self-care28 in patients with HF. Items are
answered on a five-point Likert scale, ranging from 0
(`false') to 4 (`true'). The DS14 consists of two seven-
item subscales ­ NA and SI ­ which are time-stable and
internally consistent (Cronbach's  =0.88/0.86).26,29 In
the current study, Cronbach's  was .87 for NA and .84 for
SI. The standardised cut-off score of 10 on both sub-
scales was used in order to classify individuals with a
Type D personality.26
Sociodemographic and clinical covariates
We included demographics (i.e. age, gender, educational
level and living alone), cardiac history and comorbidities.
We dichotomised education into two groups (i.e. 8 years or
less vs. more than 8 years) for presentation purposes. We
did not include New York Heart Association (NYHA)
functional class, as its criteria largely overlap with the
items of the MLWHF questionnaire. Left ventricular ejec-
tion fraction (LVEF) was also not included as a covariate
because the majority of studies have found no association
between (LVEF) and HRQOL.10,11
Statistical analysis
We examined the course of total, physical and emotional
HRQOL over all measurement occasions using pairwise
comparisons. We stratified the course of HRQOL for
above- and below-median levels of total self-care. In
order to analyse the effects of the level (between sub-
jects) and change (within subjects) of self-care over time
on the course of HRQOL, we conducted linear mixed
modelling analyses (using maximum likelihood [ML]
estimation and an unstructured covariance matrix). To
this end, we calculated the person-mean of self-care over
the measurement occasions in order to address a between-
subjects effect. Then, we calculated the deviations from
this person-mean at each time point in order to obtain
information on the person-specific change in self-care so
as to address within-subjects effects. These two variables
constituted our independent variables.
Three separate analyses were performed for total,
physical and emotional HRQOL as outcome measures.
Separate analyses were performed for total self-care and
for the consultation behaviour subscale.13 In step 1, the
self-care variables (person-mean and deviation) were
entered (unadjusted model). In step 2, we adjusted the
models for demographic and clinical covariates. In a final
step, we separately added depression, anxiety and Type D
personality. All illness-related and psychological covari-
ates were time-varying, except for demographic variables
and Type D personality. Estimates were reported, which
represent the non-standardised regression coefficients of
the dependent variable when the independent variable
increases by one unit. Analyses were performed with
SPSS 20.0 for Windows (IBM SPSS Statistics for
Windows, version 20.0; Armonk, NY: IBM Corp. USA).
Tests were two-tailed with a p-value <
0.05 indicating
statistical significance.
Results
Sample characteristics
Baseline characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Patients with below-median scores of total self-care
received less education. They demonstrated less favour-
able health behaviours (reduced physical activity and
higher body mass index). The below-median self-care
patients more often had a cardiac history. Angiotensin-
related medication and loop diuretics were less likely to
be prescribed to the below-median self-care group.
Those who were low in self-care reported increased
symptoms of depression and anxiety. There were some
trend associations as well, suggesting that the below-
median self-care patients lived alone a bit more often.
They also tended to have larger comorbidity burdens, as
well as fewer implanted cardioverter defibrillators or
pacemakers. Type D personality tended to be more
prevalent in the low self-care group, although this was
not a significant difference (p=0.08).
Attrition
In total, 56 patients (13%; of whom 22 were deceased)
dropped out at the 12-month measurement occasion,
while another 20 patients (4%; of whom seven were
deceased) dropped out at the 18-month measurement
occasion. Patients who dropped out were more likely to
have a worse illness severity (NYHA class III, 2 = 12.1,
p<0.001) and to have a lower educational level (2 = 5.7,
p
=
0.02). Patients who dropped out at 18 months were
more likely to have an elevated Charlson Comorbidity
Index (CCI) score at 12 months (F=8.47, p=0.004; no
differences at earlier measurement occasions). There
were no differences in self-care between completers and
dropouts. Patients who dropped out did have significantly
worse HRQOL during the measurement occasions before
their dropping out (inclusion: F=5.20, p=0.02; 6-month
follow-up: F=7.50, p
=
0.006) and had increased levels
of depression (F=4.45, p
=
0.04) and anxiety (F=5.06,
608 European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 16(7)
p
=
0.03) at baseline, but not at intermediate follow-up
occasions.
HRQOL over time
HRQOL differed over time (F=3.96, p=0.01), with pair-
wise comparisons showing that HRQOL was, on average,
better at all follow-up occasions than at baseline (p<0.04;
Figure 1). At 1 year, HRQOL tended to be better than at 6
months (p
=
0.05), while at 18 months, HRQOL was not
significantly different from HRQOL at the 12-month fol-
low-up. Average differences were smaller than five points
(between 1.6 and 3.0). Physical and emotional subscale
scores showed a main effect of time (F=2.84, p=0.04;
F=9.51, p
<
0.001, respectively), although the pattern of
differences was different. Physical HRQOL had a wave
form, with patients doing better at 1year of follow-up and
moving back towards baseline levels at 18months of fol-
low-up. Emotional HRQOL was worse at baseline com-
pared to at all three other follow-up occasions.
More patients in the above-median self-care group
(42%) showed a clinically relevant improvement in
HRQOL of five points or more over the first 6 months
compared to the below-median self-care group (32%),
which included a larger number of patients who signifi-
cantly deteriorated (37% vs. 29%). At 12 months, there
were more deteriorating patients in the low self-care group
(31% vs. 22%). The percentage of improving patients was
equal for low and high self-care groups. At 18 months, the
differences between low and high self-care groups altered,

with a similar percentage of clinically relevant deteriora-
tion as compared to baseline in HRQOL (32 vs. 27%) and
more divergent percentages of patients who were clinically
improving (32% vs. 42%).
Self-care and HRQOL
As a first step, we entered the person mean of self-care and
the deviation from this person-mean over time in order to
assess between-subjects and within-subjects effects of
self-care on HRQOL total and component scores. The
results showed a significant between-subjects effect of
self-care (F=12.61, p
<
0.001), but no significant within-
subjects effect (F=0.32, p=0.57). Table 2 shows the esti-
mates of the individual parameters, representing
non-standardised regression coefficients of the dependent
variable when the independent variable increases by one
unit. Better mean self-care was associated with better
HRQOL over time, while within-person variation in self-
care across time was unrelated to the level of HRQOL
across time. After adjusting for established covariates
(step 2), the relationship between self-care and HRQOL
remained similar. Low education level was a significant
predictor of worse HRQOL. In the third and final step, we
included psychological distress in three different sub-
models for depression, anxiety and Type D personality. All
three psychological distress variables were strongly related
to total HRQOL. Examining the difference in self-care
estimates between models 2 and 3 would give an indica-
tion of how much of the effect of self-care on HRQOL
could be explained by psychological stress. Depression
shared almost all variance with self-care, as the estimate
for the grand mean of self-care (between subjects) was
reduced to nearly zero. Anxiety overlapped partly with
self-care in explaining variance in HRQOL over time,
indicating that self-care affected HRQOL independently of
anxiety. Type D personality overlapped the least with self-
care in explaining variance in HRQOL over time, with the
estimate of self-care largely remaining similar to the esti-
mate in the prior step.
The physical and emotional subcomponents were less
strongly related to self-care than the total score (Table 2).
In unadjusted analyses, between-subject differences in
self-care were significantly related to difference in physi-
cal and emotional HRQOL over time. This effect disap-
peared for emotional HRQOL in adjusted analyses. Low
education level and a larger comorbidity burden were both
related to poorer physical but not emotional HRQOL. It
was shown that psychological distress was strongly related
to poorer physical and emotional HRQOL. Higher self-
care remained a predictor for better physical HRQOL
when anxiety and Type D personality were included. Self-
care no longer predicted emotional HRQOL when psycho-
logical distress variables were included.
Consultation behaviour and HRQOL
Results were similar for consultation behaviour. We found
a main effect of between-subject differences (F=16.74,
p
<
0.001), but no within-subject effects on consultation
behaviour (F=1.25, p
=
0.26). These main effects were
similar for the physical (F=17.55, p< 0.001; F=1.56,
p
=
0.21) and emotional HRQOL (F=8.95, p=0.003;
F=0.001, p
=
0.97) subcomponents. Table 3 shows the

estimates of the individual parameters, representing non-
standardised regression coefficients of the dependent vari-
able when the independent variable increases by one unit.
Between-subject differences in consultation behaviour
affected levels of HRQOL in unadjusted analyses; poorer
consultation behaviour was associated with worse
HRQOL, and this remained significant and of similar size
when adjusting for demographic and clinical covariates.
Within-subject variation of reported consultation behav-
iour over time was unrelated to HRQOL. When consider-
ing psychological distress, poorer consultation behaviour
remained a predictor for poorer HRQOL when anxiety and
Type D personality were included. Depression reduced the
effect of consultation behaviour to a non-significant level.
With respect to the physical and emotional subcompo-
nents, similar patterns appeared as were observed for total
self-care.
Discussion
The current study examined the longitudinal association
of self-care and HRQOL over a follow-up period of 18
months in a cohort of 459 patients with chronic HF. The
results led to two primary conclusions. First, between-
subject differences in self-care, but not within-subject
changes in self-care, were associated with HRQOL over
time. Lower self-care was associated with poorer overall
HRQOL, as well as its physical and emotional subcompo-
nents. Associations were robust since they were hardly
affected by established covariates, and were similar for
total self-care and the consulting for HF symptoms sub-
scale. Against the background of the inconsistent results
published so far, the current study supports the notion that
HF self-care is prospectively associated with HRQOL.11­14
Self-care was most relevant in terms of total HRQOL,
which involved additional social, HF-specific and health-
care-related items in comparison to the physical and emo-
tional HRQOL subcomponents. This study extends
previous work on the impact of psychological factors on
cardiac disease30 by showing that psychological distress
affected the relationship between HF self-care and
HRQOL negatively; either a substantial part or the entire
relationship was explained by psychological distress lev-
els. Depression fully explained the relationship between
self-care and all HRQOL domains. While anxiety and
Type D personality were related to poor HRQOL, they
only explained the relationship between self-care and
emotional HRQOL. In line with the majority of studies,
patients who were low in self-care reported higher levels
of psychological distress.31

HRQOL: health-related quality of life.
Kessing et al. 611
Depression, anxiety and Type D personality should be
considered in future attempts to address self-care and
HRQOL. Why depression was more relevant with respect
to self-care and physical HRQOL may be explained by its
somatic­affective component greatly impacting physical
function through direct and indirect effects. Research
increasingly shows that somatic rather than cognitive
depressive symptoms are related to poorer cardiovascular
health (e.g. reduced heart rate variability32), as well as
increased mortality risk in HF.16 We hypothesise that
somatic­affective symptoms may be of indirect influence
on physical HRQOL, preventing patients from performing
daily self-care behaviours. Another reason may be nega-
tive cognitive bias, which is often present in people with
depressive symptoms, leading to poor perceptions of both
self-care and HRQOL.33
HRQOL improved over time, but this was not clinically
significant (<5 points). Clinically significant deteriorations
in HRQOL were observed more often in patients who were
low in self-care, especially within the first year of follow-
up. Against expectations,13 within-person variations in self-
care did not relate to changes in HRQOL. Changes in
self-care within a person may perhaps be necessary in order
to maintain stable physical and emotional homeostasis,
which may therefore not be reflected in significant changes
in HRQOL. Further studies are necessary in order to repli-
cate these results and examine such a mechanism. Predictors
of poor HRQOL other than self-care were low education
level and increasing CCI, which reflects the burden of
comorbid conditions and ageing.
Further studies should examine which components of
psychological distress serve as potential mediators of
the relationship between self-care and HRQOL.
Accumulating studies suggest that specific psychologi-
cal characteristics or dimensions (e.g. anhedonia or
somatic symptoms) of depression are more important
with respect to specific facets of self-care31 and
HRQOL.34 Given the lack of effectiveness of self-care
interventions on quality of life,15 interventions that are
designed to improve self-care may have to incorporate
the role of psychological distress in order to impact
HRQOL. This is supported by a meta-analysis showing
that face-to-face psychosocial interventions are benefi-
cial to improving quality of life in chronic HF patients.35
There are several limitations of this study. Self-care was
assessed by means of self-report, which is subject to sys-
tematic biases and may not reflect actual behaviour.36 It
would also have been preferable to use a more extensive
anxiety measure or interview. The follow-up period of 18
months might have been too short to detect relevant

HRQOL: health-related quality of life.

changes in self-care and/or HRQOL. Our findings suggest
that psychological distress mediates associations between
self-care and HRQOL. This was not addressed with statis-
tical methods, as it diverted from the main aim of the study.
We had a small percentage of missing data. As mixed lin-
ear effects modelling makes use of ML estimation, imputa-
tion of the missing values was not necessary. Finally, given
the observational nature of the study design, no conclu-
sions can be drawn regarding the causality of these rela-
tionships. The strengths of this study were its large sample
size, its longitudinal design with self-care and HRQOL as
time-varying variables and its inclusion of psychological
distress. In addition, this is the first study to examine
whether changes in self-care within a person were associ-
ated with changes in HRQOL.
Advances in cardiovascular treatment have led to better
survival rates. Consequently, the chronicity of HF contin-
ues to increase and the risk for hospitalisation remains
high. Clinicians are challenged to minimise the devastat-
ing effects of HF on HRQOL, possibly through effective
self-care. This study confirmed that self-care was associ-
ated with HRQOL, but this relationship was greatly
affected by psychological distress, primarily depression.
Changes in self-care within a person over time did not con-
tribute to HRQOL. From a clinical perspective, our results
emphasise the notion that psychological distress is essen-
tial to and underlies the relationship between self-care and
HRQOL. Further research will enable us to gain a better
understanding of the potential psychological and behav-
ioural factors that contribute to overall HRQOL in patients
with chronic HF.
Implications for practice
·
· Self-care, but not changes in self-care, is associ-
ated with heart failure-related quality of life over
time.
·
· Depressive symptoms are most relevant in deter-
mining worse heart failure-related quality of life.
·
· Minimising psychological distress may benefit
both self-care and health-related quality of life.
