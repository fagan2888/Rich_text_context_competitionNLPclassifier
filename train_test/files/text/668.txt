This study clarifies the process by which mortality and disability interact to determine differences in active life
expectancy by age, sex, race, and education for the U.S. population 70 years of age and over. The analysis is
performed using datafrom the Longitudinal Study of Aging and multistate life tables constructed using the results of
hazard models. Women spend more years than men both active and inactive at every age; however, the proportion of
life that is expected to be active is smaller for women. These differences are largely due to mortality differences
favoring women. Persons with less than a high school education have shorter total and active life expectancies but
similar expected lengths of inactive life compared to those with more than a high school education. There are no sig-
nificant race differences in total life expectancy for race-education groups of the older population; but Blacks have
lower expected active life than non-Blacks because of worse functioning.
THE fact that elderly Americans differ greatly in their life
chances is well established. Women live longer than
men (Verbrugge, 1989). Persons of higher socioeconomic
status live longer than those less fortunate (Rogot, Sorlie,
and Johnson, 1992). And, Whites generally live longer than
Blacks. Increasing evidence shows parallel diversity in the
health and disability status of elderly Americans. Women,
Blacks, and those who are poor and less educated are more
likely to have worse health and functioning.
What is less clear is how mortality and disability experi-
ences interact over the life cycle to determine differences in
active life expectancy in the population. Active life expect-
ancy defines the period of life individuals can expect to live
without chronic disability. The present study examines how
disability, recovery, and mortality interact to determine
active life expectancy across sex, race, and education sub-
groups of the older population. A multivariate, multistate
life-table modeling approach is used to estimate active life
expectancy for the major population subgroups. A key
advantage of this approach over more traditional life-table
models is that we gain some leverage on differentiating the
biological sources of active life expectancy from socially
structured causes. This complements prior research docu-
menting the sex and socioeconomic status gradients of mor-
tality by showing how longer (or shorter) life is accompanied
by better (or worse) health.
The multivariate, multistate model is based on hazard
models determining the associations between sex, race, and
education and the disability and mortality transitions among
persons 70 years of age and older in the United States. The
models' results for each transition are combined using a
multistate life-table model to derive the implications of these
rates for total and active life expectancy and for the preva-
lence of disability across sex, race, and education sub-
groups. This approach is useful, because it can document
how specific types of health changes affect active life expect-
ancy for a particular population subgroup. Moreover, the
multistate approach allows us to document how cross-
sectional prevalence measures of disability status for a stand-
ard population are determined by transitions into and out of
various health states.
Background
Differences in active life may arise because of differences
in mortality, the onset of disability, the recovery from
disability, or some combination of these experiences (Crim-
mins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994). Results from recent
studies (Branch et al., 1991; Guralnik et al., 1993; Land,
Guralnik, and Blazer, 1994; Manton and Stallard, 1991;
Manton, Stallard, and Liu, 1993) suggest, for example, that
women have a longer active life expectancy than men.
Hypothetically, this could be due simply to women living
longer than men and accumulating more years in both
disabled and nondisabled states as they age. It also could be
due to sex differences in the rate of onset of (and perhaps
recovery from) disability. Perhaps due to the variety of
definitions of disability and samples of the older population,
prior research is ambiguous on this point. Manton (1988)
reports that sex is unrelated to functional change among
elderly persons; Land, Guralnik, and Blazer (1994) report
that sex is not related to the onset of disability but that
females are more likely to recover from disability, whereas
Rogers, Rogers, and Belanger (1992) report that males were
more likely to experience the occurrence of a disability.
How differences in rates of mortality and disability onset
and recovery are related to the prevalence of disability also
is unclear. One of the real paradoxes of the aging process is
the longer life but worse health of women. While women's
total and active life expectancy are greater compared to
men, they also have a higher prevalence of disability and
worse self-rated health (Verbrugge, 1989). Sex differences
in the diseases underlying the disability process almost
SI
SI 12 CRIMM1NS ET AL.
certainly play a role in explaining this paradox. Verbrugge
(1989) has documented a higher prevalence of fatal dis-
eases, such as heart disease, among men and a higher
prevalence of nonfatal chronic conditions, such as arthritis,
among women. If men suffer from diseases that are more
likely to kill them and women from diseases that are more
likely to disable them, this could result in longer life with
more disability for women.
In contrast to the association between active and total life
expectancy for men and women, current evidence on mortal-
ity and disability differences by education suggests that active
life expectancy varies by socioeconomic status in much the
same way as mortality. Older persons of lower socioeco-
nomic status have been shown to have both higher mortality
and a higher prevalence of functioning problems (Guralnik et
al., 1993; House et al., 1992). A number of studies have
found older persons of lower socioeconomic status to have
higher rates of functioning decline and mortality (Rogers,
Rogers, and Belanger, 1992), but whether socioeconomic
status is related to recovery is less clear (Crimmins and Saito,
1993; Rogers, Rogers, and Belanger, 1992).
Considerable ambiguity surrounds race differences in the
association between active and total life expectancy, in part
because of the inconsistency of the mortality and morbidity
estimates. Up to the oldest ages, mortality among Whites is
lower than that for African Americans; after age 80, the
differential is less clear. Mortality rates estimated from vital
statistics and population data usually show that a crossover
from higher Black to higher White mortality occurs at about
age 80 (Manton, Patrick, and Johnson, 1987). Recent work
by Preston and colleagues (1995), however, concludes that
the observed crossover results from an understatement of age
on death certificates for African Americans. When age at
death is corrected, no crossover occurs and White mortality
is lower than that for African Americans throughout the age
range (Elo and Preston, 1994; Preston et al., 1995). Race
crossovers in mortality rates also have been observed in a
variety of longitudinally followed samples of the elderly
(Gibson, 1994), although not all longitudinally followed
populations have different mortality by race or a race cross-
over (Berkman, Singer, and Manton, 1989). Recently, re-
searchers using data from the Piedmont region of North
Carolina found that above age 74, active and total life
expectancy for African Americans exceeded by a consider-
able margin that of Whites (Guralnik et al., 1993).
Differentials in disability prevalence reported for the older
population by race generally favor Whites (Clark, Maddox,
and Steinhauser, 1993), although some evidence suggests
that this difference exists only below age 75 and that there is
a crossover in morbidity as well as mortality (Gibson, 1991,
1994). When socioeconomic status is controlled, however,
most investigators do not find race differences in functioning
change or mortality (Clark, Maddox, and Steinhauser, 1993;
Rogers, R., 1992; Rogers, Rogers, and Belanger, 1992),
although there are exceptions to this (Berkman, Singer, and
Manton, 1989; Land, Guralnik, and Blazer, 1994).
Researchers interested in the health effects of social and
economic factors typically have examined mortality and
disability singly without considering how these health out-
comes might interact. Not surprisingly, therefore, there is
considerable ambiguity in our understanding of how these
factors are associated with the decline in health status over
the life span and how they relate to expected health events in
individuals' lives. Active life expectancy provides a succinct
measure of how individuals' lives can be apportioned into
years with and without disability or functioning difficulties,
and the multivariate, multistate life table model allows us to
examine the source of these differences. The ability to
identify the independent effects of sex, race, and educational
differences in active life expectancy is important because
such differences reflect the underlying aging processes char-
acteristic of subgroups in the U.S. population.
Definitions of States of Active and Inactive Life
and Types of Transitions
Active life expectancy in this analysis is life when one is
able to perform the functions necessary for personal care and
independent living; inactive life is time when one is unable
to perform these functions or would be dependent upon
others for their performance. Most analyses of active life
have divided life into only two states, one active and the
other inactive based on the ability to perform personal care
functions or activities of daily living (ADLs; Branch et al.,
1991; Guralnik et al., 1993). Manton and Stallard (1990,
1991) redress this lack of attention to other forms of disabil-
ity by incorporating measures of ability to perform tasks
necessary for independent living or instrumental activities of
daily living (IADLs) in the evaluation of active life. Building
on this work, we differentiate inactive or disabled life
according to the ability to perform ADL functions and the
ability to perform IADL functions given ADL ability. In
order to examine differentials in functioning change at
higher levels of functioning ability, we differentiate active
life into years with some functioning difficulties and years
with no reported difficulties. These definitions allow us to
classify persons in one of four functioning states, ranging
from no functioning problems to inability to perform per-
sonal care functions. The expanded "state space" allows us
to assess whether demographic and socioeconomic differen-
tials are similar across the full range of functioning experi-
enced by the older population -- not simply in terms of
severe functioning problems.
The operational definitions of each of the four functioning
states are as follows:
(1) Unable (because of health) to perform by oneself and
without aids one or more of the following ADL functions:
bathing, dressing, eating, getting in and out of bed, toileting;
or, residence in an institution;
(2) Able to perform all of the above (but perhaps with
some difficulty) but unable to perform one or more of the
following IADL functions: preparing own meal, shopping
for personal items, managing money, using the telephone,
doing light housework;
(3) Able to perform all of the above functions although
perhaps with difficulty and/or has difficulty in one of the
following functions indicating stamina and mobility: walk-
ing one-quarter of a mile, walking up 10 steps without rest,
standing or being on feet for 2 hours, sitting for 2 hours,
stooping/crouching/kneeling, lifting or carrying 10 pounds;
DIFFERENTIALS IN ACTIVE LIFE EXPECTANCY SI 13
(4) No difficulty in any of the 16 tasks used in the above
definitions.
These states are assumed to represent a rough hierarchical
scale of functioning ability, and empirical evidence from the
data support this assumption (Crimmins, Hayward, and
Saito, 1994). The first two functioning states as defined
above are viewed as inactive life or disability; the last two
states are considered active life. Estimates of active and
inactive life expectancy are derived from age-specific transi-
tion rates for the 16 types of health events that can occur with
four states of life and death defining the state space. Four of
these are deaths from each of the functioning states. Six
transitions reflect movements to better functioning, while
the remaining six transitions denote movements to worse
functioning.
The Data
The Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA) is the data set
utilized for this analysis. This study began in 1984 with
interviews of 7,527 individuals who were a representative
sample of the noninstitutionalized population 70 years of
age and over. A subset of the panel (5,151 respondents) was
chosen for reinterview in 1986. Interviews were attempted
with the survivors of the entire panel in 1988 and 1990.
Transition rates are estimated from the changes in function-
ing over the 2-year periods 1984-86, 1986-88, and 1988-
90. For this analysis, the observations are pooled over the
three intervals in order to maximize the number of transi-
tions of each type. In pooling we assume a Markov process
and no period effects. The analysis is based on a total of
15,450 person-intervals. An extensive description of this
data set including the sampling, exact wording of the
questions, and response rates can be found in Kovar, Fitti,
and Chyba (1992).
Three important adjustments to the basic data were per-
formed before proceeding with the analysis of active life
expectancy. Because the institutional population is initially
omitted from the LSOA sample and only gradually enters the
sample, the data underrepresent this segment of the older
population. Information on the percent institutionalized by
age and sex from the National Long Term Care Survey
(NLTCS) is used to adjust the weight for the LSOA institu-
tionalized respondents in order to better represent the func-
tioning transitions of the entire older population. Because in
our analysis all of the institutional sample is in the ADL-
impaired group, only the transitions observed for this group
are influenced by the reweighting. The reweighting assures
that the institutional and noninstitutional segments of the
ADL-impaired population are correctly represented.
As with any longitudinal data set, attrition is a problem in
the LSOA. Because attrition for this sample is likely to be
related to the mortality and disability outcomes of interest, it
cannot be ignored. A combination of imputation and an
additional weighting adjustment was used to adjust for sam-
ple attrition to eliminate bias caused by sample loss (for
details see Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994). Our analy-
sis is somewhat sensitive to these procedures. Four coef-
ficients become significant that would not be without the
adjustments. Three of these involve change to better function-
ing among the group, including the institutional population.
Finally, the fact that intervals between interviews differ
slightly in length has also been taken into account. This has
been done by adjusting the exposure interval in computing
the hazard rates.
The characteristics of the weighted pooled observations
are shown in Table 1. Functioning change is observed for
15,450 interval observations; women contribute 63 percent
of the observations, and African Americans contribute 8
percent of the observations. The observations contributed
by education category are almost equal: persons with 0-11
years of education contribute 56 percent of the observa-
tions, with 44 percent coming from persons with 12 or more
years. The distribution of observations by initial function-
ing state indicates that sample members are most likely to
begin the observation period with some functioning prob-
lems (45%) and least likely to be unable to provide indepen-
dent living (9%).
METHODS
Estimation of mortality rates and the rates of entering and
leaving functioning states for each subgroup of interest is the
first step in our analysis. Multivariate hazard models are
used to derive the subgroup specific transition rates which
are used to calculate the multistate life tables. Because the
LSOA does not provide complete histories of functioning
change over the 2-year intervals, we compare the respon-
dent's status across 2-year observation intervals to identify
functioning change and mortality events. Implicitly, the data
structure forces us to assume that only one transition occurs
within any interval. This, of course, results in many unob-
served transitions. We also assume that all events, including
censoring, occur in mid-interval. Movements between states
are characterized by conditional hazard rates adopting a
discrete-time hazard modeling approach. This produces cen-
tral transition rates similar to a standard life table.

the age interval x to x + 2. Statistical significance of the
estimated coefficients is examined to address the question of
whether there are differentials between groups in the risk of
making certain health changes. A hierarchical-modeling
strategy is used to obtain best-fitting models. Beginning with
a main-effects "full" model, if an estimated coefficient for a
given transition is not significant, the covariate is eliminated
from the model and the model is reestimated using only sig-
nificant covariates. Thus, in the multistate life table, transi-
tion rates for covariate strata are not different unless the
estimated coefficient in the hazard model is significant.
Differences in the estimates from the multistate life table
thus reflect statistically significant differences for specific
types of transitions. If we included insignificant coefficients,
we would be causing differences in life expectancy that were
based on insignificant differences. We also tested for a
variety of functional forms of age dependence for the 16
transitions in the model. In no instance did a more complex
functional form improve the model's fit, compared to a
model where the age effect was specified as linear.
Our second set of models includes race and education as
covariates. Thus, for each transition we estimated the net
effects of sex, race, and education.

Ed (2)
Education is a dummy variable indicating 0 to 11 years of
schooling, and its effect is measured relative to 12 or more
years. Equation (2) also was estimated with age-race interac-
tion terms to investigate the existence of race crossovers in
the transition schedules (i.e., nonproportionality).
Results of the above models are used to construct one-year
age-sex-state and age-sex-race-education-state specific
schedules of transition rates. The multistate life table is
estimated by first transforming the transition rates into a
matrix of transition probabilities from which all other life-
table functions are derived. Details of the methods for
deriving the life-table measures are available in a number of
sources (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994; Hayward
and Grady, 1990; Rogers, 1975; Schoen and Woodrow,
1980). In our analysis we use population-based rather than
status-based multistate life tables because of our interest in
how the transition rates determine the prevalence of disabil-
ity in the life-table population. To estimate population-based
tables, we initially distributed the radix population
(100,000) according to the observed prevalence in each of
the functioning states for the U.S. population 70 years of age
so that only the effect of differing mortality and rates of
functioning change is shown in the tables. Later in the
analysis we tested for the effect of subgroup differences in
the initial distribution of functioning status on outcomes.
However, previous work has shown that radix differences
have negligible effects on life-table functions after only a
few years of age (Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994;
Rogers, A., 1992).
Population-based tables allow us to compute the implied
age-specific prevalence of functioning states in the life-table
population. These prevalence measures indicate the effects
of differential rates of functioning change and mortality on
the disability and functioning structure of the population.
The prevalence rates of disability and functioning status are a
consequence of flows both into and out of the various
functioning states and of the stock of persons in each status.
Further details on the methods employed are provided in
Crimmins, Hayward, and Saito (1994).
RESULTS
Age-Sex Differences
Results of the hazards model analyses indicating the effects
of age and sex on functioning status changes are shown in
Table 2. Table 2 presents the antilogs of the parameter
estimates showing the relative risk of making a transition
(numbers above 1.0 indicate positive effects; numbers less
than 1.0 indicate negative effects). The transitions are sepa-
rated in the table into those where the change is in the
direction of better functioning, worse functioning, and death.
Prior research has documented that age is associated with
being in poor health. The results in Table 2 show that age
generally affects functioning changes regardless of individ-
uals' initial and subsequent health statuses. Older persons,
for example, are more likely to die from any initial function-
ing state and to experience worsening ability to function. A
year of age increases the relative likelihood of death by 3
percent in the inactive states and by 5 to 10 percent in the
active states. A year of age increases the relative risk of
going from no functioning problems to an inactive state by
11 to 15 percent. Younger persons are more likely to experi-
ence improved functioning. The one transition unaffected by
age, from inability to provide personal care to inability to
provide independent living, is a transition with very low
frequency.
Males across all levels of disability are more likely to die
than are females. This means that male-female life expect-
ancy differences result from greater male frailty across the
range of functioning. In the states of life that are active, at a
given age a female is about half as likely to die as a male; in
inactive states, women are 33 percent less likely to die. The
increase in chronic health problems appears to attenuate the
sex effect somewhat. While sex does not affect the risk of all
functioning transitions, where there are significant relation-
ships, men are more likely to experience improving func-
tioning and women are more likely to experience deteriorat-
ing functioning. Thus, sex affects mortality and disability in
the opposite direction: Males experience higher mortality,
and females experience worse functioning change.
In order to clarify the absolute effect of the age-sex
covariates on mortality, the one-year age-specific mortality
rates from each functioning state by sex are calculated using
the results of the hazards models and are shown in Figures
1A and IB. In general, as functioning deteriorates, mortality
increases for each sex although there is a crossover in
mortality at the upper ages between those with some func-
tioning problems and those with no problems. In fact, the
mortality differences between the two active states are fairly
small at all ages. Males have higher mortality rates from all
functioning states, as would be expected from the estimated
coefficients.
The effect of the differing transition rates for men's and
women's expected life in these functioning states is shown in
Table 3. Life expectancy at age 70 is 10.3 years for males

and 13.9 years for females. Females have longer total
expected life and life in every state than males at age 70. The
expected length of inactive life for females is twice that for
males: 2.8 years for females and 1.4 years for males. For
females, about two-thirds of inactive life (1.8 years) would
be a time when one would be unable to provide personal
care; for males, about half of inactive life (.8 years) is in this
most severely disabled category.
The percentage of life expected to be inactive is higher at
every age for females, but for both sexes it increases rapidly
with age. This is because the expected length of inactive life
stays fairly constant with age, but the length of active life
decreases markedly for each sex. At age 80, females expect
to spend more years in all of the states with functioning
problems than males, but the expected years with no func-
tioning problems are similar for both sexes. Thus, women's
greater life expectancy at the highest ages compared to
men's is due to the greater number of years women live with
functioning problems.
Most of the difference in male-female active life expect-
ancy arises from the higher mortality of males in every
functioning state rather than differences in the onset of
disability. Females gain inactive years through their longer
survival in the inactive states. If males and females differed
only in mortality rates and not in functioning transition rates,
the sex difference in active life expectancy would be larger

(2.5 years at age 70 vs the 2.2 years shown in Table 3). If
males and females differed only in the functioning transi-
tions and not in mortality, there would be very little sex
difference in either life expectancy or active life expectancy
(.3 years at age 70).
The prevalence of functioning problems among men and
women in the life-table population also is affected by the
different risks of dying and changing functioning status. At
any age above the radix, women have a greater prevalence of
disability. Even though the model begins at age 70 with the
same distribution of functioning status for each sex, by age
80 the odds of females being unable to provide personal care
are 1.3 times those for men (Figure 2).
Differences in the likelihood of making health transitions
affect both the life and death experiences of men and
women. If one assumes 100,000 males and females enter age
70 with similar levels of functioning but experience the age-
sex transition schedules of this multistate life table, females
will experience almost 65 percent more transitions from an
active to an inactive state during their expected lives (55,813
vs 34,022; data not shown). By definition, each one of these
transitions is from an independent to a dependent state when
help from another person would be needed for independent
living and/or personal care. Examination of the transitions in
the multistate life table also indicates that females are more
likely to die after a period of dependency. About half of
females (49%) die from a state of dependent life, while this
is true of less than one-third of males (31%). These figures
have significant implications for the differential care re-
quired by sex in the last years of life.
The above analysis assumes that males and females enter
age 70 in similar functioning states and differ at this age and
older in their mortality rates, disability rates, and recovery
rates. If the radix of the multistate life table is adjusted to
represent the observed higher prevalence of poor functioning
for females than males at age 70, the results of the analysis
are virtually unchanged. Female total life expectancy and
life expectancy in each of the active states would drop by . 1
year, whereas male life expectancy and life expectancy with
no functioning problems would increase by . 1 year. These
results demonstrate that differences in the initial distribution
of functioning state for an older age population are quickly
extinguished by current rates of functioning state change.

Race and Education
In our next analysis we introduce race and education into
the equations. When functioning status and education are
controlled, race has relatively few effects on the risks that an
older individual will either die or change functioning state
(Table 4). The one exception among the mortality transitions
is the effect of race among persons unable to provide inde-
pendent living. Non-Blacks who are unable to provide inde-
pendent living are more likely to die than Blacks with similar
functioning status. Race has a significant net effect for only 3
of the 12 functioning transitions. In each case the coef-
ficients indicate that Blacks are less likely to recover and
more likely to experience declines in functioning ability
compared to non-Blacks. Thus, there is some evidence that
African Americans are more vulnerable than non-Blacks to
disability even with education and the initial disability state
controlled. There is no evidence of worse mortality condi-
tions for Blacks within functioning state.
The generally insignificant race effect on mortality is not
due to the fact that education is controlled. The results from
hazard models excluding education are the same. Nor is the
result due to the fact that health status is controlled. Race
does not affect mortality if observations are grouped into two

states of health, active and inactive, or into one state as in
computing rates for a conventional life table.
When age-race interaction terms are introduced, the effect
is usually to eliminate the main effect of race while the
interactions are not significant. The interaction and the main
effect are significant in the transition from the state of no
problem functioning to death, but no other race or age-race
interaction terms are significant. This means that our lack of
observed racial effects in Table 4 is not due to a pattern of
age-race crossovers in transition rates. Including the signifi-
cant interaction terms into calculation of the transition rates
had only a negligible effect on the multistate life table
estimates. Therefore, we proceed with our analysis without
incorporating interaction terms.
Within functioning status groups, education is related to
the likelihood of death from the state of best functioning.
Among persons who have no functioning problems, those
with less than a complete high school education are more
likely than those with higher education to die. This may
reflect a lack of diagnosis of conditions with no functioning
consequences such as some types of heart disease and high
blood pressure among those with lower status and less
preventative health care usage. Alternatively, higher status
persons may delay death from this state by the medical
management of disease. Once functioning problems occur,
our results are consistent with the idea that those with worse
education have their conditions diagnosed and treated so that
health then is not differentiated by education.
Lower socioeconomic status also increases the chances of
experiencing the onset of mild disability and then progres-
sion to the inability to provide independent living. On the
other hand, among persons experiencing the most severe
forms of disability, better-educated persons are more likely
to recoup functioning. These transitions include moves out
of an institution, and, as such, may include effects of both
differential functioning change and differential ability to
afford certain kinds of care. It is possible that higher status
persons have alternatives to institutional care, or they may be
required to find such alternatives because they are not eligi-
ble for Medicaid-provided institutional care.
These socioeconomic differences in mortality and func-
tioning transitions result in differences in total and active life
expectancy by education (Table 5). Those with low educa-
tion have about .7 fewer years of total life expectancy at age
70 than those with at least a high school education in the
same race-sex group. Differences in the length of expected
active life are the primary cause of differences in total life
expectancy; active life expectancy for higher education
groups is one year longer than that for lower education race-
sex groups. Differences in the length of inactive life are
smaller (.3 years for Black females is the widest range);
those with lower education have more years of inactive life.
This means that the proportion of expected inactive life is
somewhat higher for those with less education.
The total years of expected life is very similar for sex-
education groups of the two race groups. This is obviously
derived from the fact that there was little race difference in
mortality. The implication of race differences in the health
status transition rates is that non-Blacks of both sexes expect
somewhat fewer years of inactive life and more years of
active life. This results in a smaller percentage of inactive
life for non-Blacks. The advantages non-Blacks have in
active life expectancy thus are due to race differences in the
likelihood of making disability transitions. The race differ-
ences are such that 23 percent of expected life is inactive for
African American women with higher education at age 70,

whereas the figure for non-Black women is only 18 percent.
The size of the difference is similar for men.
The implication of the transition rates for the prevalence
of disability among the life-table populations for sex-race-
education subgroups is shown in Figures 3A and 3B. By age
80 the lower education groups of both Black and non-Black
males would expect to have about 40 percent more inactive
or dependent people than the higher education group. For
Black females at this age the proportion dependent is about
one-third larger in the lowest status group; for non-Black
women, the lower group has about one-fourth more depen-
dent persons. For all sex-education groups in the life-table
population, the proportion of the population that is depen-
dent is higher in the Black population than the non-Black
population.
DISCUSSION
The large and consistent mortality differential between
men and women at all levels of functioning leads to substan-
tially higher total and active life expectancy for women and
to the larger sex difference in total compared to active life
expectancy. While women over age 70 experience more
disability events compared to men, this difference only
reduces slightly the excess years of female active life. Even
this effect may be overestimated. Some of the observed sex
differences in functioning transitions may not, in fact, reflect
differences in ability to function but may be due to differ-
ences in the likelihood of institutionalization. Two of the
four significant sex differences in functioning reflected
changes into and out of the category containing the institu-
tional population. Because we know that institutionalization
is affected by one's support network as well as one's func-
tioning ability, this may reflect sex differences in the support
network in old age. Because of the sex difference in mortal-
ity, older women are more likely than older men to be
widowed and then institutionalized because they have no
caregiving spouse. Thus, higher male mortality could be the
cause of some of the greater likelihood for what appears to be
functioning decline among women.
On the other hand, the differences in male and female
disability transitions may reflect sex differences in the dis-
eases causing disability (Verbrugge, 1989) as well as in the
DIFFERENTIALS IN ACTIVE LIFE EXPECTANCY S119
patterns and progression of certain diseases and conditions
(Manton, 1990). For instance, at the 1984 interview of this
sample, women were more likely than men to report the
presence of conditions such as osteoporosis (5.7 vs 0.6%)
and arthritis (60.6 vs 45%). Both of these are non-mortal
conditions which may be related to higher onset and lack of
recovery from disability. Men, on the other hand, are more
likely to report that they have heart disease (20.0 vs 15.0%),
which is the major cause of death in this age range and is
certainly related to their higher mortality. Many who die
from heart disease do so with little or no warning. Males are
known to have higher death rates from heart disease as well
as other mortal conditions. This means that females are more
likely to survive these conditions and then acquire the
nonfatal conditions more prominent among women.
Women's expectations for a longer inactive life, a greater
likelihood of experiencing disabling events, and a greater
likelihood of dying from the disabled state need to be
incorporated into life cycle planning until there is a greater
similarity in mortality between the sexes. Older women's as
well as men's lives would be very positively affected by a
decrease in male mortality that brought their rates closer to
those of women. Such a decrease would provide more
caregivers for women in their years of disability.
Even at the oldest ages, life differs for those of different
socioeconomic backgrounds. Those of higher status are
more likely to survive to old age and they are more likely to
survive old age better. Because there are stronger socioeco-
nomic effects on functioning change than mortality, socio-
economic differentials in active life expectancy exceed those
for total life expectancy. Within race groups, persons of
lower education live shorter total and active lives.
Because Black and non-Black mortality are the same in
three states of functioning, there are no significant race
differences in total life expectancy estimated for race-
education subgroups. However, non-Blacks live fewer years
of life inactive and more active. Socioeconomic differences
in disability onset and recovery lead to higher prevalences of
disability among those who are Black and of low education.
This results in a more difficult life for both these groups and
their families, who are likely to be called on to serve as
caregivers.
The similarity of mortality between African American and
other persons in this sample replicates the findings of other
longitudinal studies of the older population (Berkman,
Singer, and Manton, 1989). If the racial crossover in mortal-
ity found in almost all data generated from vital statistics is
due to errors on the death certificate, as suggested by Preston
et al. (1995), a crossover is less likely to occur in sample
surveys where the deceased reports his or her own age while
still living. Investigation of the race patterns of differences
between ages reported in sample surveys and on death
certificates of sample members would be enlightening on
this score.
