Introduction
Tsunamis are infrequent high-impact events that can
cause a considerable number of fatalities, inflict major
damage and cause significant economic loss to large sec-
tions of the coastlines. Under-sea earthquakes account
for nearly 85% of the world's tsunamis (Whitmore etal.,
2008), and tsunamis are less commonly caused by sub-
marine landslides, infrequently by submarine volcanic
eruptions and very rarely by a large meteorite impact in
the ocean (Nayak and Kumar, 2011). The Indian Ocean
tsunami of 26 December 2004 killed over 230,000 people
and displaced more than 1
million people. In India, the
tsunami devastated the coastal communities in Kerala,
Tamil Nadu, Andhra Pradesh, Puducherry, and the
Andaman and Nicobar Islands claiming nearly 18,000
lives (National Disaster ManagementAuthority (NDMA),
2010). In response to this great tragedy, the Government

Abstract
The Indian Tsunami Early Warning System situated at Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services, Hyderabad,
India, monitors real-time earthquake activity throughout the Indian Ocean to evaluate potential tsunamigenic earthquakes.
The functions of the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System earthquake monitoring system include detection, location and
determination of the magnitude of potentially tsunamigenic earthquakes occurring in the Indian Ocean. The real-time
seismic monitoring network comprises 17 broadband Indian seismic stations transmitting real-time earthquake data through
VSAT communication to the central receiving stations located at the Indian Meteorological Department, New Delhi, and
the Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services, Hyderabad, simultaneously for processing and interpretation.
In addition to this, earthquake data from around 300 global seismic stations are also received at the Indian National Center
for Ocean Information Services in near-real-time. Most of these data are provided by IRIS Global Seismographic Network
and GEOFON Extended Virtual Network through Internet. The Indian National Center for Ocean Information Services
uses SeisComP3 software for auto-location of earthquake parameters (location, magnitude, focal depth and origin time).
All earthquakes of Mw >5.0 are auto-located within 5­10minutes of the occurrence of the earthquake. Since its inception
in October 2007 to date, the warning centre has monitored and reported 55 tsunamigenic earthquakes (under-sea and
near coast earthquakes of magnitude 6.5) in the Indian Ocean region. Comparison of the earthquake parameters (elapsed
time, magnitude, focal depth and location) estimated by the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System with the US Geological
Survey suggests that the Indian Tsunami Early Warning System is performing well and has achieved the target set up by the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission.

of India established the Indian Tsunami Early Warning
System (ITEWS) at the Indian National Centre for Ocean
Information Services (INCOIS), Hyderabad (Gupta,
2005). The ITEWS comprises a real-time network of
seismic stations, tsunami buoys, tide gauges and a 24×7
operational tsunami warning centre to detect tsunami-
genic earthquakes, to monitor tsunamis and to provide
timely advisories with back-end support of scenario data-
base, vulnerability modelling and decision support sys-
tem (Kumar etal., 2010).
The concept
Within any tsunami early warning concept, but mainly
for a warning system for near-field tsunamis, the earth-
quake monitoring system plays a central role (Hanka
etal., 2006). The time available to warn the population in
the near-field regions like the Andaman and Nicobar
Islands after a tsunami has been generated by a large
earthquake is extremely short since the expected tsunami
travel times are only of the order of 20­30min or even
less. Therefore, tsunami watch or warning bulletins
should be issued preferably within 10­15min in order to
be able to initiate timely civil protection measures. These
bulletins will initially be based primarily on rapidly
determined earthquake parameters and on selected pre-
calculated tsunami scenarios which fit the initial seismic
parameters (Behrens etal., 2010). The sea level sensor
data will be used in the later bulletins to warn the far field
regions like the Indian mainland. These sea level data
will also be used to validate the model results and also
help in giving the final ALL Clear advisory.
The seismic network
Observation of the historical earthquake data sets in the
Indian Ocean region indicates two potential source
regions, namely, the Andaman­Nicobar­Sumatra island
arc and the Makran subduction zone north of the Arabian
Sea (Nayak and Kumar, 2008). The east and west coasts
of India and the island regions are likely to be affected by
tsunamis generated mainly by subduction zone­related

earthquakes occurring in these zones (Figure 1). In order
to monitor earthquakes occurring in these regions and to
estimate earthquake parameters with reasonable accuracy
in the shortest possible time, a well-distributed network
of broadband seismic stations communicating data in
real-time is vital for the tsunami early warning system.
INCOIS has established a land-based network of 17 seis-
mic stations (Figure 2) in collaboration with the Indian
Meteorological Department (IMD), New Delhi. All these
stations transmit real-time data through VSAT
communication to the central receiving stations (CRSs)
located at IMD, New Delhi, and INCOIS, Hyderabad,
simultaneously for processing and interpretation. The
stations are listed in Table 1. In order to have good azi-
muthal coverage of stations for quick and precise estima-
tion of the earthquake parameters, the ITEWS has also
configured stations from internationally coordinated net-
works like the IRIS, GEOFON and GSN networks, where
real-time data are received through the Internet.
Station configuration
Each field station is equipped with Trillium 240 broadband
seismometer, Taurus seismograph, and necessary power
and communication facilities. The seismometer is well
covered with thermal insulation and kept on `pier' for
direct contact with hard rock on the ground and shielded
perfectly to avoid the thermal and pressure fluctuations
and to protect it from other atmospheric effects. The seis-
mometer continuously records ground motion with 100
samples/s in the frequency range of 0.01­50Hz with con-
stant frequency response. The recorded data are stored in
the Taurus seismograph and transmitted continuously in
automatic mode to the CRS through VSAT communica-
tion. The CRSs are equipped with state-of-the-art comput-
ing hardware, communication, data processing,
visualisation and dissemination facilities. The field equip-
ment can be accessed from the CRS remotely at any point
of time and perform functions such as calibration of sen-
sors including centring of mass, inspecting the state of
health and downloading the seismic data from field sta-
tions. The schematic diagram at each station is given in
Figure 3.

Real-time data processing
The real-time seismic data received at the ITEWS have
to be quickly processed for the estimation of the earth-
quake parameters. SeisComP3 software is configured
for real-time data reception, archiving, processing and
auto-location using the national and international sta-
tions. Any earthquake of magnitude >5.0 occurring on
the globe is auto-located within 5­10
min using this
software. The earthquake parameters are displayed
(Figure 4) with an alarm notification to alert the warning
centre operators. The system can compute almost all
types of magnitudes such as the local magnitude (ML),
body wave magnitude (mb), broadband body wave mag-
nitude (mB), broadband p-wave magnitude (Mwp), sur-
face wave magnitude (MS) and moment magnitude
(Mw). After the auto-location is given by the system, the
operators can review the earthquake waveforms to refine

the auto-located parameters and the focal mechanism can
be computed to know the tsunamigenic potential of the
under-sea earthquake.
The ITEWS has been recognised as one of the
Regional Tsunami advisory Service Providers (TSP) for
the Indian Ocean region on 12 October 2011 by the
Intergovernmental Oceanographic Commission (IOC) of
the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural
Organization (UNESCO). As part of its regional ser-
vices, the ITEWS compares its estimated earthquake
parameters (elapsed time, magnitude, focal depth and
location) with those of the US Geological Survey
(USGS) to maintain its regional performance (targets
set by IOC-ICG/IOTWS-V/13, 2008). Since its incep-
tion in October 2007 till 31 May 2015, ITEWS has mon-
itored 475 earthquakes of magnitude 6.5 all over the
globe (both land and ocean). Out of these earthquakes,
55 are in the Indian Ocean region (both Ocean and near
coast). A summary of the performance of the warning
centre against key performance indicators since it
attained regional status, that is, since 12 October 2011
(22 earthquakes), is given in Table 2.
It is evident from Table 2 that the parameters estimated
by the ITEWS seismic network are very well within the
target set up by IOC-ICG/IOTWS-V/13. Elapsed time is
the time span between origin time of the earthquake and
initial earthquake information issuance. It is observed that
the average elapsed time of the ITEWS is 8.3min, which
is within the target of 10/15min, while the USGS has an
elapsed time of 10min. The average difference in magni-
tude of the ITEWS estimate with the USGS is 0.30, which
also achieves the target of 0.3. The average focal depth
difference with the USGS is 19.8km (Figure 5(a)), which
is within the target value of 25km. A comparison of earth-
quake location estimated by the ITEWS with the USGS
indicates that the average difference in location is within
the target of 30km (Figure 5(b)).
As a case study, we will discuss the ITEWS perfor-
mance during the large strike-slip earthquakes of mag-
nitude Mw (mB) 8.5 and 8.2 that occurred on 11 April
2012 in the Indian Ocean region. The former earth-
quake generated a small ocean-wide tsunami that has
been recorded by various tide gauges and tsunami
buoys located in the Indian Ocean region. The ITEWS
detected this earthquake within 3
min 52
seconds and
located it within 7
min from its occurrence with the
help of `SeisComP3' auto-location software. The initial
magnitude of this earthquake was estimated as Mw
(mB) 8.7 with a focal depth of 10km. Both the national
and regional earthquake information bulletins were
issued after 8min of the occurrence of the earthquake
which is within the target of 10/15
min prescribed by
the IOC. The earthquake parameters were reviewed,
and considering the tsunami model results, the second
bulletin was issued at 12
min with the revised earth-
quake magnitude as Mw (mB) 8.5 with threat informa-
tion considering the earthquake as thrust fault as it
occurred in the subduction zone. Furthermore, the real-
time waveforms were analysed and noted that the earth-
quake occurred with strike-slip faulting and concluded
there was no threat of an ocean-wide tsunami. But con-
sidering the tsunami model results and the real-time sea
level observations, only a few parts of Andaman and
Nicobar Islands were advised to evacuate. The ITEWS
issued further bulletins according to its Standard
Operating Procedure and avoided unnecessary evacua-
tions to the mainland. This event once again proved the
efficiency of the ITEWS.
Summary
The ITEWS established at the INCOIS with all the neces-
sary computational and communication infrastructure is
performing satisfactorily since its inception in October
2007. The real-time seismic monitoring network is con-
tinuously providing data and achieved its design goals.
The earthquake monitoring capability of the ITEWS is
significantly improved with the real-time seismic net-
work, in particular with respect to the potential tsunami-
genic earthquake­generating regions.
