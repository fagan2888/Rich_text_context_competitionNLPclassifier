OBJECTIVE -- Although A1C is now recommended to diagnose diabetes, its test perfor-
mance for diagnosis and prognosis is uncertain. Our objective was to assess the test performance
of A1C against single and repeat glucose measurements for diagnosis of prevalent diabetes and
for prediction of incident diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We conducted population-based analyses of
12,485 participants in the Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities (ARIC) study and a subpopu-
lation of 691 participants in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) with repeat test results.
RESULTS -- Against a single fasting glucose 126 mg/dl, the sensitivity and specificity of
A1C 6.5% for detection of prevalent diabetes were 47 and 98%, respectively (area under the
curve 0.892). Against repeated fasting glucose (3 years apart) 126 mg/dl, sensitivity improved
to 67% and specificity remained high (97%) (AUC 0.936). Similar results were obtained in
NHANES III against repeated fasting glucose 2 weeks apart. The accuracy of A1C was consistent
across age, BMI, and race groups. For individuals with fasting glucose 126 mg/dl and A1C
6.5% at baseline, the 10-year risk of diagnosed diabetes was 88% compared with 55% among
those individuals with fasting glucose 126 mg/dl and A1C 5.7­6.5%.
CONCLUSIONS -- A1C performs well as a diagnostic tool when diabetes definitions that
most closely resemble those used in clinical practice are used as the "gold standard." The high
risk of diabetes among individuals with both elevated fasting glucose and A1C suggests a dual
role for fasting glucose and A1C for prediction of diabetes.

Although A1C is now recommended
for the diagnosis of diabetes (1,2),
its precise test performance is un-
certain. The lack of a single, clear "gold
standard" poses a challenge for determin-
ing the performance of A1C. Previous di-
agnostic studies of A1C have relied
exclusively on a single elevated fasting or
2-h glucose values as gold standards (3­
5). However, because glucose determina-
tions are inherently more variable than
A1C (6), these convenient gold standards
are likely to reduce the apparent accuracy
of A1C as a diagnostic test. A stronger
gold standard would rely on repeated glu-
cose determinations on different days (2),
i.e., the recommended approach to diag-
nosis of diabetes in clinical practice. Al-
ternatively, A1C and fasting glucose can
be compared head-to-head against the
subsequent development of clinically di-
agnosed diabetes as the gold standard.
We hypothesized that 1) A1C would per-
form well as a diagnostic and prognostic
test for diabetes across its full range and at
the American Diabetes Association­
recommended threshold of 6.5% and 2)
that its performance would be best when
judged against stronger, most clinically
relevant gold standards.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS
Atherosclerosis risk in communities
study
The Atherosclerosis Risk in Communities
(ARIC) study is a community-based co-
hort study of 15,792 black or white adults
aged 45­64 years at baseline sampled
from four U.S. communities. The first
clinical examinations (visit 1) took place
during 1987­1989, with three follow-up
visits approximately every 3 years. Infor-
mation on diabetes status including self-
reported physician diagnosis, diabetes
medication use, and fasting glucose mea-
surements was obtained from all partici-
pants at each clinical examination (7).
Visit 2 (1990­1992), attended by 14,348
participants, was the only visit for which
stored whole blood samples were avail-
able for measurement of A1C and is the
baseline for the present study. We ex-
cluded participants who identified race/
ethnicity as other than white or black,
who had a self-reported physician diag-
nosis of diabetes or diabetes medication
use (visit 1 or visit 2), who were nonfast-
ing, or who were missing variables of in-
terest; thus, the final sample size for our
main analyses was 12,485 individuals.
Second examination of the third
national health and nutrition
examination survey
The Second Examination of the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III Second Exam) was a
substudy of NHANES III, conducted in
1988­1994 (8). A nonrandom sample of
2,596 participants in the original
NHANES III was selected for participa-
tion in this substudy; these data comprise
one of the largest available databases of
short-term repeat laboratory and physical
examination measurements in humans
(6,9,10). We excluded NHANES III Sec-
ond Exam participants who were aged
18 years (n  387), who were fasting
8 h (n  1,411), who reported a prior
physician diagnosis of diabetes (n  53),
or who were missing glucose or A1C val-
ues (n  54). After these exclusions, 691

participants remained for analysis. Oral
glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) were
only performed on individuals who were
aged 40­74 years and who had morning
examinations; all analyses of 2-h glucose
measurements were limited to the smaller
sample of individuals with valid OGTT
data (n  317).
Measurement of glucose and A1C
In the ARIC study, serum glucose was
measured from blood collected at each
visit using the hexokinase method. We
thawed and assayed frozen whole blood
samples collected at ARIC study visit 2
(1990­1992) for measurement of A1C
using high-performance liquid chroma-
tography (Tosoh 2.2 Plus in 2003­2004
and Tosoh G7 in 2007­2008, Tosoh Cor-
poration, Tokyo, Japan) (standardized to
the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial [DCCT] assay) (11). Because A1C
data are only available at visit 2 in the
ARIC study, this was used as the baseline
examination in the present study.
In addition to plasma glucose mea-
surements, the NHANES III examination
included a 2-h 75-g OGTT in adults aged
40­75 years. A1C measurements were
obtained using the Diamat high-
performance liquid chromatography as-
say (Bio-Rad Laboratories) (standardized
to the DCCT assay). Because variant he-
moglobins can interfere with A1C mea-
surement by the Diamat assay, samples
with evidence of interference were reana-
lyzed by affinity chromatography. The
NHANES III repeat examinations were
conducted approximately 2 weeks after
the first examination by trained personnel
following the same standardized proto-
cols (6). Detailed information on data col-
lection and laboratory procedures in
NHANES III are described elsewhere
(12,13).
Prevalent undiagnosed diabetes
In the ARIC and NHANES III studies, we
used the repeat glucose values available to
compare different definitions of prevalent
undiagnosed diabetes (Table 2). In the
ARIC study, we generated two principle
definitions of prevalent diabetes (defini-
tion 1: a single fasting glucose value 126
mg/dl at baseline [visit 2]; and definition
2: fasting glucose values 126 mg/dl at
two separate examinations). In the ARIC
study, the two fasting glucose measure-
ments took place at the clinical examina-
tions that were 3 years apart. In the
NHANES III subpopulation, the two clin-
ical examinations took place 2 weeks
apart (mean 17 days). In the NHANES III
subpopulation, we also examined indi-
viduals with undiagnosed diabetes de-
fined by single and repeat 2-h glucose
values 200 mg/dl.
Incident diabetes in the ARIC study
On-going longitudinal follow-up of ARIC
study participants also provided us the
opportunity to assess the performance of
baseline A1C for classification of incident
diabetes. We used two definitions of inci-
dent diabetes: a visit-based definition
(definition A) and an interview-based def-
inition (definition B). For definition A, we
used a standard time-to-diabetes defini-
tion based on glucose measurements, self-
reported diagnosis, or medication use for
a maximum of 6 years of follow-up (14).
For definition B, we used self-reported in-
formation on diabetes diagnosis and
medication use during the visits and sub-
sequent annual telephone calls for a max-
imum of 15 years of follow-up (15).
Statistical analyses
We examined population characteristics
by diagnostic categories of A1C (6.5%
and 6.5%) among individuals without a
history of diagnosed diabetes in the ARIC
and NHANES III populations. We calcu-
lated the sensitivity, specificity, and posi-
tive and negative likelihood ratios at all
cutoffs of A1C for each definition of prev-
alent and incident diabetes. We calcu-
lated the area under the receiver operator
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for
A1C overall and by subgroups of the
population in the ARIC study only (the
sample size for the NHANES III subpopu-
lation was insufficient for subgroup anal-
yses): age (60 or 60 years), race/
ethnicity (white or African American),
and BMI categories (25, 25­30, or
30 kg/m2). We also conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses in individuals with anemia.
We used data from the ARIC study to es-
timate the subsequent risk of diabetes
during follow-up (15). Using the Kaplan-
Meier method, we estimated the 10-year
cumulative incidence of diagnosed diabe-
tes according to clinical categories of
baseline fasting glucose and A1C.
RESULTS -- The characteristics of the
study populations by A1C 6.5% and
6.5% are shown in Table 1. Among
NHANES III participants with A1C
6.5% at the baseline examination, 80%
(61­92%) also had A1C 6.5% at the
second examination 17 days later.
Among participants with fasting glucose
126 mg/dl at baseline, 70% (50­86%)
had fasting glucose 126 mg/dl at the
second examination. In the ARIC study,
60% (57­64%) of participants with a fast-
ing glucose 126 mg/dl at the baseline
examination also had a fasting glucose
126 mg/dl at the 3-year follow-up visit.
Repeat A1C measurements were not
available in the ARIC study.
The AUCs for A1C for the identifica-
tion of diabetes using multiple definitions
are shown in Table 2. In the ARIC study,
the highest AUC was for diabetes defined
by two fasting glucose measurements
126 mg/dl, 3 years apart (definition 2):
AUC 0.936 (95% CI 0.920­0.952). The
accuracy of A1C was consistent across age
and race groups, but there was a signifi-
cant difference in the accuracy across BMI
categories (supplementary Table, avail-
able in an online appendix at http://care.
diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/
dc10-1235/DC1). For definition 1, the
accuracy of A1C was lower among nor-
mal-weight individuals compared with
overweight and obese individuals. How-
ever, for definition 2, A1C demonstrated
high and consistent accuracy across all
BMI groups. The AUCs were also high in
NHANES for both definitions (Table 2).
The AUC for A1C for a single fasting glu-
cose at baseline as the gold standard in
NHANES III (definition 1) was (0.938
[95% CI 0.881­0.995]), but the sample
size was small (n  29 cases of diabetes),
with corresponding imprecision re-
flected in the wide CIs. Two-hour glu-
cose measurements were also available
in NHANES III, and analyses using single
and repeated 2-h glucose measurements
demonstrated similarly high AUCs. For
instance, the AUC for A1C was 0.959
(0.899­1.00) for diabetes defined as a
fasting glucose 126 and 2-h glucose
200 mg/dl at the baseline examination.
The AUCs for fasting glucose 126 mg/dl
and 2-h glucose 200 mg/dl at both the
baseline and follow-up examination 17
days later were identical (0.959 [0.885­
1.000]), but, again, the number of cases of
diabetes in this study population was
small (n  14).
The ROC curves for A1C in the ARIC
study comparing definitions 1 and 2 are
shown in Fig. 1. The sensitivity and spec-
ificity of A1C 6.5% for identifying cases
of diabetes by definition 1 (single fasting
glucose 126 mg/dl) were 47 and 98%,
respectively. For definition 2 (fasting glu-
cose 126 mg/dl at two time points, 3
years apart), the sensitivity was 67% and
the specificity was 97%. Detailed infor-

mation on the sensitivity, specificity, and
positive and negative likelihood ratios of
all A1C cutoffs for each definition of dia-
betes in ARIC and NHANES III are pre-
sented in the supplementary Table. The
prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin 13
g/dl in men and 12 g/dl in women [16])
was 9.9% in the ARIC population. In
analyses among individuals with anemia,
the overall performance (AUC), sensitiv-
ity, and specificity of A1C were similar
(data not shown).
Follow-up data available in the ARIC
study allowed us to examine the perfor-
mance of A1C for prediction of subsequent
diabetes (Table 2). The AUC for the visit-
detected cases of diabetes during 6 years of
follow-up (definition A) was 0.827 (0.813­
0.840). The AUC for diagnosed (interview-
based) diabetes risk during a median of 14
years of follow-up (definition B) was 0.733
(0.722­0.745). However, the AUC for in-
terview-based diagnosed cases during the
first 6 years of follow-up only was similar to
that for the visit-detected cases: 0.826
(0.800­0.851).
The 10-year risk of diagnosed diabe-
tes was 12% (11­13%) and the 15-year
risk was 25% (24­26%) in the ARIC
study. The 10-year risks of diagnosed di-
abetes stratified by categories of baseline
and A1C and fasting glucose are shown in
Fig. 2.
CONCLUSIONS -- The accuracy of
A1C for diagnosis of prevalent diabetes
was high for all reference definitions and
robust across subpopulations (all AUCs
0.80). However, the sensitivity and
specificity of A1C 6.5% to identify cases
of undiagnosed diabetes varied, depend-
ing on the definition of undiagnosed dia-
betes used as the gold standard. Use of
repeat glucose tests to define diabetes
substantially reduced the proportion of

A1C for prediction of diabetes
86 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 34, NUMBER 1, JANUARY 2011 care.diabetesjournals.org
individuals in the discordant cells, partic-
ularly individuals with fasting glucose
(126 mg/dl) and A1C (6.5%). In this
study, a value of A1C 6.5% strongly
predicted a subsequent diagnosis of dia-
betes, even among individuals classified
as having undiagnosed diabetes by fasting
glucose. We observed that those with
high A1C but without elevated fasting
glucose had a lower incidence of diag-
nosed diabetes than those meeting both
the glucose and A1C criteria. Such results
suggest a dual role for A1C and glucose
for the prediction of diabetes.
New guidelines for the use of A1C for
the diagnosis of diabetes recommend that
an elevated A1C or fasting glucose or
OGTT results be confirmed on a second
occasion or that the diagnosis be con-
firmed by a different test on the same oc-
casion. Analyses of short-term (6) and
long-term reliability (17) have demon-
strated that A1C is significantly less vari-
able than fasting glucose or 2-h glucose.
Our data suggest an A1C 6.5% con-
firmed by a fasting glucose 126 mg/dl
on the same occasion has a high positive
predictive value (88%) for 10-year diabe-
tes risk. We observed a substantial risk of
diagnosed diabetes at high levels of A1C
regardless of the baseline fasting glucose
level, consistent with previous analyses of
these data (15). However, the observed
diabetes risk among individuals in discor-
dant A1C and fasting glucose risk catego-
ries suggests the utility of using both A1C
and fasting glucose to reduce misclassifi-
cation and accurately identify individuals
at risk of future diabetes.
An A1C cut point of 6.5% is highly
specific but has low sensitivity for the
identification of prevalent undiagnosed
diabetes by these definitions. The low
sensitivity of A1C does not necessarily
mean that A1C has poor test perfor-
mance; it may be that A1C is more appro-
priately distinguishing those individuals
at risk for subsequent complications. Rec-
ommendations for use of A1C for diagno-
sis, monitoring glycemic control, and
guiding therapy in diabetes are largely
based on the association of A1C with
long-term microvascular outcomes (2).
Epidemiological studies have also dem-
onstrated associations among A1C and
risk of diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and all-cause mortality in nondiabetic in-
dividuals (15), with substantial increases
in risk observed at A1C values 6.0%.
Prospective epidemiological data demon-
strate that A1C is a stronger predictor of
vascular complications than fasting glu-
cose (15).
As has been shown in previous stud-
ies (18,19), blacks were substantially
more likely to have elevated A1C values
than whites. Nonetheless, we did not ob-
serve substantial racial differences in the
overall performance of A1C for the iden-
tification or prediction of diabetes.
This study highlights a weakness in
the literature related to diabetes diagno-
sis: the lack of confirmatory glucose test-
ing to replicate the typical clinical
scenario in which multiple tests are con-
ducted before a diagnosis is made. In
studies with no confirmatory testing, A1C
will seem to miss a proportion of fasting
glucose-defined cases of diabetes. This is
partly a function of the short-term vari-
ability in fasting glucose. When repeat
testing is used, this discordance is re-
duced. We have shown previously that
A1C has substantially lower within-
person variability compared with fasting
and 2-h glucose (6). Whereas repeating
fasting glucose tests can substantially
reduce misclassification, the high reliabil-
ity of A1C suggests that a single measure-
ment is sufficient for diagnostic
classification unless laboratory error or
interference is suspected.
For diabetes and other asymptomatic
conditions that are clinically defined,
diagnostic testing studies should use
multiple reference standards, ideally em-
phasizing those that most closely replicate
the clinical setting. Previous studies have
highlighted the low sensitivity of A1C for
detecting diabetes defined by a single fast-
ing or 2-h glucose measurement
(3,5,20,21). Our data demonstrated im-
proved performance of A1C compared
with stronger gold standards that relied
on repeated glucose determinations on
different days.
A number of limitations of this study
should be considered. This study was not
a traditional diagnostic testing study, and
we did not conduct a head-to-head com-
parison of the accuracy of glucose com-
pared with A1C; for this, a third reference
standard would be needed. The small
number of cases of diabetes by any defi-
nition among participants in the
NHANES III subsample resulted in im-
precision of our estimates and prevented
further subgroup analyses in this popula-
tion. We also did not have information on
2-h glucose at the time of A1C measure-
ment in the ARIC study. Nonetheless, the
ARIC study is one of the largest U.S. co-

hort studies of A1C with information on
the development of diabetes. The addi-
tional analyses of NHANES demonstrated
consistency across populations and al-
lowed us to examine definitions of diabe-
tes based on short-term repeat glucose
measurements (weeks apart).
In summary, we found that A1C per-
forms best when more stringent glucose
criteria are used to define diabetes (i.e.,
fasting glucose 126 mg/dl on two
separate occasions), similar to clinical
practice. Our data support current rec-
ommendations for use of A1C in the di-
agnosis of diabetes and demonstrate that
an A1C cutoff of 6.5% is highly specific
and may be reasonably sensitive in the
context of evidence linking A1C to risk of
long-term microvascular and macrovas-
cular outcomes in nondiabetic adults. We
also found that A1C and fasting glucose
both strongly predict subsequent risk of
diagnosed diabetes, but the very high risk
observed for individuals with both ele-
vated fasting glucose and A1C suggests a
dual role for fasting glucose and A1C for
prediction of diabetes.
