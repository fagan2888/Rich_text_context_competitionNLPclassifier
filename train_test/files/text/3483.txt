Abstract: Proponents of Terror Management Theory (TMT) argue that many facets
of disgust serve to defend against existential anxiety accompanying cognizance of
one's mortality. Because the passage of time brings death closer, this view predicts
that the intensity of disgust elicited by reminders of death should increase with age.
Skeptical of TMT, we conducted Internet-based studies using the instrument created
by TMT proponents. Results reveal that age is negatively, not positively, correlated
with death disgust sensitivity, a pattern consistent with adaptive habituation rather
than terror management. The same result was obtained using in-person
administration of the instrument in Costa Rica, a society characterized by attitudes
toward death that differ from those of the U.S. Additional work in Costa Rica
demonstrated that, contrary to TMT predictions, attention to one's own death need
not increase disgust reactions to the body or its products. Both the evocative power of
death stimuli and the negative effects of age on death disgust are consistent with the
argument that disgust is an adaptation motivating disease avoidance rather than a
psychodynamic defense mechanism.

The Terror Management account of disgust
Disgust, first systematically studied by Darwin (1872), is widely considered a
universal emotion (Ekman, Friesen, and Ellsworth, 1982; Oatley and Johnson-Laird,
1987; Scherer and Wallbott, 1994). Though long neglected, within the last two
The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
decades disgust has become the focus of rigorous investigation. Paul Rozin and
Jonathan Haidt, the principal pioneers in this enterprise, have, together with their
associates, generated a large body of empirical findings, shedding new light on
disgust. Because their work constitutes a thematically coherent corpus, we refer to
this team collectively as the Rozin School. The Rozin School proposes that a disgust-
like emotion evolved to protect the body from the oral incorporation of pathogen- and
toxin-bearing substances (Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994; Haidt, Rozin,
McCauley, and Imada, 1997; Rozin and Fallon, 1987; Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley,
1993, 1999). However, being intimately linked to defending the body/self from
contamination, disgust, the Rozin School argues, is readily extended to other
domains.
A principal conceptual hazard that symbolically-mediated disgust ostensibly
guards against is the recognition that humans are animals. Inspired by the work of
anthropologist Ernest Becker (1973), and relying on the same premises as the
theoretical framework now known as Terror Management Theory (TMT) (see
Greenberg, Solomon, and Pyszczynski, 1997 for review), the Rozin School claims
that knowledge of our own mortality induces existential anxiety, a condition that
TMT proponents describe as a fitness-reducing paralytic state ­ consumed by an
awareness of the inevitability of death, individuals are, it is postulated, unable to
engage in the tasks that contribute to survival and reproductive success (Greenberg,
Solomon, and Pyszczynski, 1997; Solomon, Greenberg, Schimel, Arndt, and
Pyszczynski, 2004). Because humans are aware that animals are mortal, being
reminded of our animality provokes this paralyzing anxiety. Disgust is thus
purportedly adaptively employed as a defense against existential terror, an
explanation invoked to account for the linkage between disgust and such stimuli as
contact with animals, body products, violations of the body envelope, and the dead
(Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Kluck, and Cornwell, 2001; Haidt,
McCauley, and Rozin, 1994; Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, and Imada, 1997; Rozin,
Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore, 1999; Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, and Imada,
1997; Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley, 1993, 1999, 2000).
Consistent with the above reasoning, the Rozin School and allied Terror
Management investigators hold that the application of disgust to the domain of sexual
behavior is motivated by a panhuman need to distance oneself from the animality of
mating (Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994; Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, and Imada,
1997; Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore, 1999; Rozin, Haidt, and
McCauley, 1993, 1999, 2000; see also Goldenberg, Cox, Pyszczynski, Greenberg,
and Solomon, 2002; Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon, Kluck, and
Cornwell, 2001; Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, McCoy, Greenberg, and Solomon, 1999).
Recently, we demonstrated that disgust sensitivity in the sexual domain, and only in
the sexual domain, increases as a function of the likelihood of conception across the
menstrual cycle (Fessler and Navarrete, 2003a). It is difficult to see how such
patterned domain-specific changes in disgust sensitivity can be explained by the
notion that sexual disgust derives from an intense need to avoid recognition of one's

The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
own mortality. In contrast, these changes are exactly what should be expected if
women's sexual disgust is an evolved adaptation that reduces the probability of
biologically suboptimal sexual unions (e.g., incest, bestiality, etc.) during the fertile
phase. This led us to question the Rozin School's oft-repeated claim that, rather than
directly reflecting the workings of an evolved mechanism, many aspects of disgust
experience instead constitute an attempt to avoid existential terror. We therefore
sought to examine the domain in which the postulated phenomenon ought to loom
most large, namely disgust reactions to stimuli that are overtly associated with death.
If, as TMT proponents argue (Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon,
Kluck, and Cornwell, 2001; Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994; Haidt, Rozin,
McCauley, and Imada, 1997; Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore, 1999;
Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, and Imada, 1997; Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley, 1993, 1999,
2000), disgust responses to reminders of death constitute an attempt to avoid the
anxiety attending the recognition that we are mortal, and if, as part of that
recognition, each of us knows that the passage of time inexorably brings us closer to
the day that we will die, then disgust sensitivity in the death domain should increase
with age, since the motivation to deny our impending death should be enhanced as the
fateful day draws closer.1
Although Quigley, Sherman, and Sherman (1997) noted that disgust
sensitivity declines with age, their study focused only on young adults, and they
report only overall disgust sensitivity, rather than disgust sensitivity by domain;
similar considerations apply to Rozin, Haidt, and McCauley's observation that `There
are hints ... that disgust sensitivity declines after the teen years,' (2000, p. 648). In
the course of our investigation of changes in disgust sensitivity over the menstrual
cycle, using the same instrument employed by both Quigley, Sherman, and Sherman
and the Rozin School, we also found a decline in overall disgust sensitivity with age
(Fessler and Navarrete, 2003a); however, our study involved only reproductive-age
women. In a very large sample spanning a wide age range, Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie
(2004) showed declines in disgust sensitivity with age; however, their study
employed stimuli not directly related to death. As the literature thus does not
illuminate the relationship between age and disgust sensitivity in the death domain,
we sought to address this issue via three avenues. First, we reanalyzed data
previously collected in two Internet-based surveys that employed the Disgust Scale
(Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994), the instrument created by the Rozin School, the
principal advocates of the Terror Management account of death disgust. Second, we
conducted a new Internet-based survey using the Disgust Scale. Lastly, because
attitudes toward death vary across cultures, in order to ensure that any patterns found
were not the unique product of U.S. culture, we orally administered a translated
version of the Disgust Scale in rural Costa Rica, a cultural environment in which
individuals have greater familiarity with death, and in which death fears are more
boldly confronted, than is generally true in the U.S.

The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
Study 1 ­ Reanalysis of prior Internet-based administrations of the Disgust Scale
Method
In order to shed light on the relationship between age and death disgust, we
revisited data collected previously in the course of two Internet studies conducted for
other purposes. The first study, described to participants as `Surveys on Diet,
Disgust, and Motion Sickness,' consisted of a dietary inventory on the first web page,
followed by the Disgust Scale on a second page, followed in turn by a questionnaire
on susceptibility to motion sickness (see Fessler, Arguello, Mekdara, and Macias,
2003 for details). In the second study, titled `Body Awareness and the Self,' the
initial web page asked participants to rate how disgusting they found the prospect of
transplantation of each of twenty different body tissues; the Disgust Scale was then
presented on a separate page (see Fessler and Haley, in press, Study 3, for details). In
both studies, participants were recruited through postings to clearinghouse web sites
(e.g., Psychological Research on the Net, SocialPsychology.org) and listservs (e.g.,
Psych-L, Anthro-L). Participation was anonymous, and no compensation was
offered.
Results and Discussion
We pooled data from the two studies, limiting the analysis to adults who
completed every item on each questionnaire and eliminating multiple entries from the
same IP address. This produced a combined sample of 921 individuals (635 women
and 286 men, aged 18 ­ 79; M = 29.5, S.D. = 11.3). To assess death disgust
sensitivity, we examined responses to death-related questions on the Disgust Scale,
including both true/false questions (e.g., "It would bother me to sleep in a nice hotel
room if I knew that a man had died of a heart attack in that room the night before,"
etc.) and scalar `how disgusting' questions (e.g., "You accidentally touch the ashes of
a person who has been cremated," etc.) (see Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994). In a
multiple regression analysis in which the independent variables were age, sex, and a
dummy variable controlling for mean differences between the two samples,2 we
found a significant main effect for age in which increasing age predicted lower
disgust sensitivity to death stimuli. As will be discussed later, a sizeable body of work
demonstrates that, in many domains, women are generally more disgust sensitive than
men. Consistent with this literature, we also found a main effect for sex, as, on
average, men showed significantly less disgust sensitivity toward death stimuli than
did women. (see Table 1 full regression statistics).
We explored sex-x-age interactions in a second step. However, adding these
cross-products did not significantly increase the variance explained in the regression,
and they were therefore removed from the model. This revealed that, although men
were less disgust sensitive towards death stimuli than were women, the slopes
predicting disgust sensitivity as a function of age did not differ between the sexes.

Study 2 ­ Internet-based administration of the Disgust Scale alone
Method
Because the materials analyzed in Study 1 were not originally collected for
the purpose of examining age effects on death disgust sensitivity, in both of the
surveys, the Disgust Scale was preceded by a questionnaire addressing a different
topic; likewise, in both cases, demographic information was collected at the
beginning of the survey. These procedures raise the possibility that the pattern
evident in the results reflects age-dependent priming effects produced by stimuli not
directly pertaining to death disgust. To address this limitation, we conducted an
additional Internet survey in which the Disgust Scale was presented in isolation. A
link labeled `An Investigation of the Effects of Context on Emotional Reactions,'
posted on clearinghouse web sites, led to the Disgust Scale, followed by a separate
page containing questions regarding age, sex, and the setting in which participation
took place (the latter information was collected for reasons not relevant to the present
discussion).
Results
Employing the same criteria for inclusion as those used in Study 1 produced a
sample of 692 individuals (506 women and 186 men, aged 18 ­ 81; M = 26.8, S.D. =
11.7). In a multiple regression analysis in which the independent variables were age,
sex and their interactions, we found significant main effects for age and sex.
Confirming previous results, death disgust sensitivity declined significantly with age,
and men were less disgust sensitive than women (Table 2). A second step in which
interaction terms were added once again revealed that, although men had a lower
mean level of death disgust sensitivity than did women, the slopes predicting disgust
sensitivity as a function of age did not differ between the sexes.

Study 3 ­ In-person oral administration of the Disgust Scale in rural Costa Rica
Participants for Studies 1 and 2 were recruited using web sites and listservs
that are directed primarily at an English-speaking North American audience. It is
therefore likely that many participants in Studies 1 and 2 either primarily identified
with U.S. culture, or else were intimately familiar with it. Adherence to a cultural
worldview plays a central role in TMT (Greenberg, Solomon, and Pyszczynski,
1997). Because attitudes toward death vary substantially across cultures (Counts and
Counts, 1991), we therefore felt it important to demonstrate that the effects of age on
death disgust sensitivity documented in Studies 1 and 2 are not unique to those who
are well-versed in North American culture.
Rural Costa Rica differs along many important dimensions from the dominant
culture of the U.S. (Hofstede, 1991), and numerous traditions, practices and beliefs
remain relatively unadulterated by North American influences (Biesanz , Biesanz,
and Biesanz, 1999). As in other agricultural areas in the Developing World, people in
rural Costa Rica are frequently exposed to the death of animals, as animals are killed
for food, pests and predators are exterminated, and farm animals die of injuries or
age. In addition to the general exposure to the cycle of life and death typical of rural
dwellers, Latin Americans are noteworthy for the degree to which they appear to have
normalized death. Many Hispanic authors have noted that mortality concerns are
expressed openly in Latin American cultures, rather than repressed as they often are
in the U.S. (e.g. Delibes, 1966; Fierro, 1980). Likewise, death themes have been
staples of Hispanic written and oral traditions for centuries, and may have pre-
Columbian roots in both the Spanish and the Mayan and Aztec traditions (Siefken,
1993). Consistent with these generalizations, practices in rural Costa Rica reflect an
easy familiarity with death. Dying relatives usually pass away in the home, not in
hospitals, and surviving family members are present at the moment of death. In the
immediate aftermath, family members often remain in close proximity to the
deceased, sometimes embracing and kissing the corpse. More generally, people
frequently visit relatives' graves and memorials, and picnics at a loved one's tomb are
common, particularly during religious holidays; food is sometimes left at the grave
for the deceased to consume. Correspondingly, with regard to overarching attitudes

The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
toward death and dying, rural Costa Ricans are more open about their anxieties, more
familiar with the death process, and much more fatalistic in their attitude toward
death than is typical in the U.S. (Biesanz , Biesanz, and Biesanz, 1999; Navarrete,
2004). Hence, because of the many relevant contrasts with contemporary U.S.
culture, rural Costa Rica constitutes a promising setting in which to evaluate the
degree of universality of patterns of emotional reactions to reminders of death.
In addition to examining the effects of age on death disgust in rural Costa
Rica, we also used this opportunity to test a related prediction promulgated by
proponents of a Terror Management approach to disgust. Goldenberg, Pyszczynski,
Greenberg, and Solomon (2000) and Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon,
Kluck, and Cornwell (2001) argue that, because disgust defends against fitness-
reducing existential anxiety, reminders of death should intensify the disgust reaction
to stimuli, such as the body and its by-products, which remind people that they are
animals, and hence are mortal. Goldenberg, Pyszczynski, Greenberg, Solomon,
Kluck, and Cornwell (2001, Study 1) tested this hypothesis in a North American
university sample by administering the Disgust Scale following contemplation of
one's own death; results revealed that, relative to a control condition, mortality
salience increased scores on the body products and animal disgust sensitivity
subscales. The authors interpret this finding as supporting the Rozin School's notion
that disgust responses serve as a symbolic, distal defense against death by
differentiating humans from animals.
In previous research, we found that, contrary to the core predictions of TMT,
reminders of death failed to increase worldview defense among Costa Rican
participants (Navarrete, 2004; Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, and Kirkpatrick, 2004).
We hypothesized that these null effects were due to cultural differences, as overt
death fears may not be particularly salient to individuals in societies such as Costa
Rica in which beliefs, practices, and fatalistic attitudes make exposure to death
themes less problematic than is true for people living in societies that emphasize
secular life and control over one's own destiny. Rural Costa Rica was thus a useful
location for a test of the TMT claim that, due to evolved panhuman features of mind,
mortality salience should enhance disgust sensitivity toward the corporeal aspects of
human animality.
Method
Study participants were 82 Costa Rican citizens (29 men and 53 women)
living in the community of Cariari, in the Limón Province of the Republic of Costa
Rica--a region with a primarily agricultural economy in which bananas are the
principal export. Participants were recruited door-to-door in their homes to participate
in a survey on personality and social attitudes, and ranged in age from 16 to 73 (Mean
Age: 28, S.D. = 11.1). Education ranged from 0 to 15 years (Mean 7.9, S.D. = 2.5)
with the modal education level at the completion of primary school (6 years).
Because rural Costa Ricans have little or no familiarity with written surveys,
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 285 -
The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
we employed an in-person structured interview format. With the aid of literate local
assistants, the second author translated the Disgust Scale into colloquial Costa Rican
Spanish. The resulting translation was then inspected by two faculty members at the
D'Amore Language School in Quepos, Costa Rica, who edited the translation for
clarity. Finally, the edited version was presented to local assistants, who substituted
familiar colloquial terms for any formal phrases. The survey was then administered
by a male research assistant who was naïve to the hypotheses being tested.
Participants were given a mortality salience prime, the Positive And Negative
Affect Schedule (PANAS) (Watson, Clark, and Tellegen, 1988), the Disgust Scale,
and an assay of several demographic items. The mortality salience prime, similar to
that used in typical TMT research, asked participants to describe the feelings that the
thought of their own death aroused in them, and to describe what happens when one
physically dies. Participants in the treatment condition were given the mortality
salience prime before the administration of the Disgust Scale, while participants in
the control condition were given the prime after the Disgust Scale. Following Terror
Management protocols (Greenberg, Pyszczynski, Solomon, Simon, and Breus, 1994),
the PANAS was administered as a delay and distraction before administration of the
Disgust Scale.
Results and Discussion
In evaluating the effects of age and sex on death disgust sensitivity, we
conducted a regression analysis similar to those described above. A dummy variable
coded for whether participants were exposed to the mortality salience prime before or
after administration of the Disgust Scale.
Analysis revealed a main effect for age, a marginally significant effect for
sex, and no effect for mortality salience on death disgust sensitivity (see Table 3).
Interaction terms were not significant and were removed from the model. As in our
Internet studies, death disgust decreased as a function of age, and men showed less
death disgust than did women. Mortality salience failed to produce a significant
change in disgust sensitivity toward death stimuli.

The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
In assessing the TMT prediction that reminders of death should intensify the
disgust reaction to animality and by-products of the body, we conducted a
multivariate regression in which the animal and body products subscales of the
Disgust Scale were the two dependent variables; mortality salience, sex, and age were
the predictors. The analysis revealed no effect for mortality salience on either
subscale, no age effects, and a main effect for sex, with men being less disgust
sensitive toward animal and body-function disgust stimuli than women (see Table 4).
Contrary to the predictions, and previous findings, of TMT researchers working in the
U.S., in Costa Rica reminders of death failed to intensify the disgust reaction to those
domains which blur the human­animal boundary.

Limitations
Although the Disgust Scale incompletely predicts performance on behavioral
measures of disgust sensitivity (Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore,
1999), given that the instrument was created for this purpose by the Rozin School,
this limitation does not reduce the challenge that our findings pose to the latter's
explanation of death disgust. Nevertheless, additional studies using other means of
measuring death disgust sensitivity are necessary before definitive conclusions can be
reached regarding the effects of age on death disgust. Given our cross-sectional
design, it is possible that the patterns we report are due to cohort effects rather than
age-related changes in disgust sensitivity. However, we know of no evidence
suggesting that death disgust sensitivity has increased among younger adults in recent
years, and, given the increasingly realistic and graphic portrayals of death popular in
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 3. 2005. - 287 -
The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
entertainment consumed by Western young people, it is more likely that, at least in
our Internet samples, the opposite is true.
Several readers of a draft of this paper suggested that the age-related increases
in death disgust predicted by Terror Management approaches to this emotion might
be masked by overarching psychological changes such as the reduction in negative
emotional reactivity with age (cf. Mather et al., 2004). We acknowledge that our
methods do not allow us to rule out this possibility. Nevertheless, if, as Terror
Management Theory claims, existential anxiety is truly fitness-reducing, and if, as
asserted by the Rozin School and other proponents of TMT, death disgust is an
important means of combating such paralytic anxiety, then one might reasonably
expect that natural selection would have found a way to maximize, rather than
constrain, individuals' emotion-mediated abilities to combat increasing paralysis as
the end of life looms closer with the passage of time. By way of comparison,
consider the threat posed by dangerous animals, a factor that has plausibly constituted
a significant source of selective pressure over the course of human evolution. Fear of
dangerous animals leads individuals to avoid activities that place them at risk of
attack, and hence, within limits, such fear is fitness-enhancing today, and would have
been in the ancestral past as well. Due to age-related changes in physical robusticity,
older individuals are generally less able to fend off dangerous animals than are
younger adults. Consistent with this pattern, older adults report greater fear of large
carnivores (Roskaft, Bjerke, Kaltenborn, Linnell, and Andersen, 2003) and dogs
(Boyd et al., 2004) than do younger adults. This suggests that, when the fitness costs
are both real and evolutionarily recurrent, emotional responses vary in an adaptive
fashion as a function of age despite the influence of overarching age-related changes
in negative emotional reactivity.
General discussion
A straightforward reading of Terror Management Theory suggests that
defenses against existential anxiety should progressively increase as the inevitability
of senescence, and hence death, becomes increasingly evident. The Rozin School and
allied TMT researchers assert that disgust reactions to death are part of such defenses,
generating the prediction that death disgust should increase with age. Here, using the
measure of disgust sensitivity devised by the Rozin School, we have shown that,
contrary to this prediction, disgust sensitivity in the death domain declines with age.
Recently, some proponents of TMT have argued that what they term `successful
aging' involves abandoning those defenses against death anxiety thought to be
characteristic of younger adults, replacing them instead with coping mechanisms
centering on what is described as `self-transcendence' (McCoy, Pyszczynski,
Solomon, and Greenberg, 2000). This revised formulation of TMT fares no better in
our tests. If disgust reactions to death and reminders of death are a defense against
existential anxiety characteristic of one stage of life, and if defenses of this type are
later replaced by self-transcendence, then the relationship between age and death

The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
disgust should shift sometime in old age. Younger individuals should exhibit a
positive correlation between death disgust and age since, being still reliant on defense
mechanisms involving denial and avoidance, with each passing year they should
work harder to distance themselves from their approaching deaths. In contrast, older
individuals should exhibit a negative correlation between death disgust and age since,
the greater their age, the longer the opportunity they have had to work toward self-
transcendence, and hence the less they should need to deny their mortality through
disgust reactions to death. In each of our studies we found a significant main effect
for age, indicating that the relationship between death disgust and age does not
exhibit the inverted U-shaped function predicted by this version of TMT.
In addition to demonstrating that TMT is unable to predict the relationship
between age and death disgust, our Costa Rican study reveals that, contrary to the
predictions of Terror Management theorists, in at least one population, mortality
salience induction does not enhance disgust responses to reminders of animality.
Although Terror Management Theory explicitly purports to provide an
evolutionary account of human responses to death (Solomon, Greenberg, Schimel,
Arndt, and Pyszczynski, 2004), viewed from the perspective of contemporary
evolutionary psychology, TMT is premised on a number of questionable assumptions,
including the view that anxiety is fitness-reducing, and the claim that all animals
possess a domain-general survival instinct (for critiques see Boyer 2001, pp. 204-226;
Buss, 1997; Leary, 2004; Leary and Schreindorfer, 1997; Matz, Evans, Geisler, and
Hinsz, 1997; Navarrete and Fessler, 2005; Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, and
Kirkpatrick, 2004). Elsewhere (Navarrete, Kurzban, Fessler, and Kirkpatrick, 2004)
we have provided evidence that the experimental prime, mortality salience induction,
employed in much TMT research lacks the uniqueness ascribed to it by TMT
advocates. Together with the results presented above, these observations lead us to
conclude that Terror Management Theory does not provide a solid foundation on
which to construct theories of disgust.
Although Paul Rozin was one of the earliest proponents of a neo-Darwinian
approach to behavior (cf. 1976), while noting the evolutionary origins of disgust as a
motivator of behavioral prophylaxis, the Rozin School has nevertheless emphasized
features of disgust, such as elicitation by culturally-defined morally objectionable
behaviors, that deviate from this function (Haidt, Rozin, McCauley, and Imada, 1997;
Rozin, Lowery, Imada, and Haidt, 1999). In contrast, following suggestions by Nesse
and Williams (1995) and Pinker (1997), Curtis and Biran (2001) have sought to
swing the pendulum back toward a more comprehensive evolutionary account of
disgust, documenting that, across disparate cultures, this emotion is elicited by
stimuli, such as feces, vomit, and spoiled food, that constitute avenues for pathogen
transmission (see also Cosmides and Tooby, 2000; Wronska, 1990; compare with
Kurzban and Leary, 2001). Consistent with this view, Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie
(2004) recently showed that disgust elicitation is influenced by cues (wound type,
color of liquids, etc.) that are discretely associated with sources of disease. In
previous work, members of our research group have argued that a) the salience of

animals and animal parts as disgust elicitors reflects the hazards of pathogen
transmission that such objects posed in ancestral environments (Fessler and
Navarrete, 2003b); and b) the relative salience of various parts of the human body in
disgust events is a function of both their vulnerability to biological contamination and
their role in producing contaminants (Fessler and Haley, in press). Recently, we
demonstrated that food disgust sensitivity is elevated during the first trimester of
pregnancy, a period when, due in part to reproductive immunosuppression, the costs
of food-borne illness are greatly elevated (Fessler, Eng, and Navarrete, 2005). While
we acknowledge that disgust experiences are importantly shaped by cultural beliefs,
we believe that this growing corpus of evidence indicates that many features of
disgust are best explained in terms of the functional importance that avoiding sources
of biologically relevant contamination held for our ancestors. Given that a) for most
of human history, death was often caused by disease, and b) pathogens proliferate on
corpses and carcasses, it follows that disgust reactions to death are parsimoniously
explained as one facet of an emotion that evolved to decrease exposure to fitness-
reducing contamination (Boyer, 2001, pp. 212-215).
Declines in disgust sensitivity with age may reflect habituation as a result of
repeated exposure to death-related stimuli over time. Habituation can be viewed as
part of the adaptive modulation of responses to indices of potentially harmful
circumstances: because caution and avoidance are costly due to the time, energy, and
missed opportunities that they entail, it is adaptive to reduce such responses when
experience reveals that, in the given environment, the stimuli at issue do not index
significant hazards. Note that the habituation explanation is incompatible with the
Rozin School's claim that death disgust defends against existential terror -- defense
mechanisms can be likened to mental calluses and, like their physical equivalents,
they ought to become increasingly robust, rather than increasingly weak, with
successive exposure to abrasive features of the environment. Our account of death
disgust thus combines an acknowledgement of the evolutionary importance of disease
avoidance with a recognition of the possible adaptive influence of habituation on
response intensity. This perspective is both more parsimonious and better able to
explain the influence of age on death disgust than the rather baroque psychodynamic
processes postulated by Terror Management Theory.
Future directions
In addition to a robust effect of age on death disgust, our results consistently
reveal a sex difference in this area, with women exhibiting greater disgust sensitivity
in the death domain in each of our studies. This pattern is in keeping with the sex
difference in overall disgust sensitivity reported in numerous previous investigations
(Arrindell, Mulkens, Kok, and Vollenbroek, 1999; Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie, 2004;
Davey, 1994; Druschel and Sherman, 1999; Haidt, McCauley, and Rozin, 1994;
Huang and Wang, 1994; Mancini, Gragnani, and D'Olimpio, 2001; Marzillier and
Davey, 2004; Oppliger and Zillmann, 1997; Quigley, Sherman, and Sherman, 1997;

The Effect of Age on Death Disgust: Challenges to Terror Management Perspectives
Rozin, Haidt, McCauley, Dunlop, and Ashmore, 1999; Schienle, Walter, Stark, and
Vaitl, 2002; Wronska, 1990). A number of factors may have favored the evolution of
greater female disgust sensitivity. Fessler (2001) proposes that, as a result of the
cyclical immunosuppression intrinsic to female reproduction, contamination imposes
greater fitness costs on females than on males, a thesis congruent with the elevation
of disgust sensitivity in the first trimester of pregnancy described earlier (Fessler,
Eng, and Navarrete, 2005). Curtis, Aunger, and Rabie (2004) suggest that, because
females were principally responsible for child care in ancestral environments, the
enhanced vulnerability of infants and small children to disease favored greater female
disgust sensitivity as a means of protecting offspring from pathogen transmission.
Lastly, Fessler, Pillsworth, and Flamson (2004) propose that, for males, publicly
evincing low disgust sensitivity can a) signal a willingness to take risks, thus both
deterring potential rivals from transgressing against the actor and demonstrating the
actor's value as an ally, and b) signal possession of locally optimal genes for
immunological robusticity. At present, more work is needed to determine which, if
any, of these factors are responsible for the sex difference in disgust sensitivity.

Notes
1. A reviewer of this paper questioned whether TMT advocates have explicitly
articulated this prediction. To our knowledge, they have not. However, this
objection is not germane -- because it is an obvious and logically necessary
consequence of the core reasoning on which TMT is premised, testing this
prediction is a legitimate means of examining the validity of TMT. If a theory
is so underspecified that only its authors can determine what predictions it
generates, then it is of no merit.
2. The two data sets presumably differ in mean disgust score because a
questionnaire that likely primed disgust reactions preceded the Disgust Scale
in the second study.
