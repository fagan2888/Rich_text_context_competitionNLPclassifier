State of urgency: Surveillance, power, and
algorithms in France's state of emergency
Kyle Kubler
Abstract
The recent terrorist attacks and ongoing state of emergency in France have brought questions of police surveillance into
the public spotlight, making it increasingly important to understand how police attain data from citizens. Since 2005, the
French police have been using IBM's computer program, i2 Analyst's Notebook, to aggregate information and craft
criminal narratives. This technology serves to quickly connect suspects with crimes, looking for as many associations as
possible, ranking and visualizing them based on level of importance. Recently, surveillance and state power have been
theorized as having shifted to a posthegemonic, order. Drawing from literature on power, surveillance, and identity, this
paper considers the various ways that algorithms can impact policing under a state of emergency by comparing the
technical protocol of i2 Analyst's Notebook with the administrative protocol of the French state. Using i2 Analyst's
Notebook as an example, this paper argues that posthegemonic theories of power have their place in determining how
algorithms can be used for surveillance, but that they cannot completely explain their use under the state of emergency.

Introduction
This paper attempts to outline the role that algorithms
play in the French state of emergency by looking at
how the policing software, i2 Analyst's Notebook,
organizes and visualizes data. Using police testimony
from an investigation by the French national assembly,
this paper shows the importance of data extraction as a
police tactic under the state of emergency. The technical
protocol of i2 Analyst's Notebook, which allows for
data extraction at its current scale, is compared with
the administrative protocol of the nation-state. Using
Agamben's work on the state of exception, I argue that
the state of emergency is a central function of liberal
statehood, as opposed to a temporary lapse in
democratic judgment. The algorithm and the data visu-
alization are more than just the mediums of state
control and they are part of its material constitution.
This argument brings along with it discussions
of power operating as posthegemonic, and the ``post-
panopticon'' era of surveillance, which raise questions
of how social life is controlled and by whom. For the-
ories of surveillance and power, this work focuses on
Scott Lash's ``Power after hegemony'' (2007), and
David Lyon and Zygmunt Bauman's Liquid
Surveillance: A Conversation (2013). These authors,
along with others, have made the case that power no
longer operates from above in a traditional hegemonic
fashion, but rather that it operates from below, in

horizontal forms of communication. By putting surveil-
lance literature in conversation with that of algorithms,
I show how the state of emergency in France validates,
but also complicates concepts of posthegemony, par-
ticularly regarding the state.
The state of emergency in France creates a unique
case study for understanding the role of algorithms in
the creation of political identity. For scholars that evoke
Foucault, Agamben, and Deleuze to theorize the inter-
section of state power and surveillance technologies, I
hope the example of France today will be a helpful
expose
´ of state violence and identity. I draw heavily
from Dan McQuillan's ``Algorithmic state of exception''
(2015) and John Cheney-Lippold's ``A new algorithmic
identity'' (2011) to test these theories against the current
state of emergency in France, showing the intersections
and limits of current scholarship. Cheney-Lippold uses
Deleuze and theories of posthegemony to show how
algorithms create a fragmented identity of dividuality.
For McQuillan, algorithms create an ungovernable
space of exception that allows them to determine iden-
tity in this way. I argue that the creation of dividual
identity aligns with the technical protocol of i2
Analyst's Notebook, and the administrative protocol
of the French state, but that it is not necessarily indica-
tive of posthegemonic power, nor a result of states of
exception created by the algorithm itself. The state of
emergency is an example of how the state creates divi-
dual identity, not through exception, but as a rule of its
existence. For some, the increasing use of algorithms in
governance and policing is seen as inhumane or
undemocratic. My goal is not to discourage this conver-
sation, but to take it further by making an ontological
connection between how both algorithms and the state
operate through identity, control, and exclusion.
State of emergency
In response to the terrorist attacks in Paris on 13
November 2015, France has been under a state of emer-
gency which has drastic effects on law enforcement.
Legally, this allows the police1 significant freedoms that
are not limited to conducting house raids and putting
people under house arrest without approval from a
judge, collecting and monitoring information obtained
from potential suspects, and the ability to block websites
and prevent public gatherings (Human Rights Watch,
2016a). These freedoms allow police access to vast
amounts of data, with over 18 terabytes collected and ana-
lyzed since November 2015 (Raimbourg and Poisson,
2016). Since November, over 4000 raids have been exe-
cuted and more than 500 people have been put under
house arrest (Human Rights Watch, 2016b). The state of
emergency has now been extended for a fourth time, which
will last until July 2017. In an era of policing that relies
heavily on computer software to aggregate information, it
is important to understand the potential these technologies
have for influencing surveillance and policing.
While much of the legal focus in France has been on
the changes during the state of emergency, impactful
changes to data privacy and security laws took place
earlier, in 2014 with the LPM Act (loi de programma-
tion militaire). Along with allowing the deployment of
7000 soldiers during times of crisis, the LPM Act also
``provided an opportunity to modify the legal regime
applicable to administrative access to communications
data, in order to give counter-terrorism services
broader access'' (CNIL, 2015). The Charlie Hebdo
attacks in January 2015 activated the LPM act and
brought along with it the Intelligence Act of 24 July
2015.2 The Intelligence Act allowed intelligence services
to hold communication data of potential suspects for
up to five years (previously one year before the LPM),
wiretapping and electronic surveillance were extended
beyond just the suspect to include family and friends,
authorized the use of keyloggers and other software to
monitor and record computer use, and introduced
IMSI catchers, or fake cell phone towers that capture
mobile phone data (CNIL, 2015). These previous legal
decisions have affected the way data has been collected
and analyzed during the state of emergency.
The legal parameters of the state of emergency have
fluctuated since it has been in effect. The period from
November 2015 to February 2016 saw the highest
number of raids and house arrests. When the state of
emergency was continued in February, the constitu-
tional court deemed it unconstitutional to seize data
from citizens during house raids. In the period imme-
diately following this decision, from February until
July, raids and house arrests were at their lowest.
However, after the terrorist attack in Nice during
Bastille day celebrations on 14 July 2016, the state of
emergency was extended again, with a reevaluation of
data seizure laws. For the newly ratified state of emer-
gency, French police can seize property such as cell
phones and hard drives, on the condition that a signifi-
cant connection to a crime or terrorist plot can be
proven. For this data to be stored, connections to a
crime must be ratified by a judge, which according to
the vice-president of the State Counsel, Jean-Marc
Sauve
´ , has a 90% success rate (Jacquin, 2016). Since
this ruling, house arrests have increased 50%, and raids
are up as well (Pascual, 2016a).
Unsurprisingly, these raids and house arrests have
been carried out along highly racialized and religious
lines. Due to the strict secularization laws in France, the
state does not have official census data on race or reli-
gion, making quantitative answers to these questions
difficult. Estimations of the Muslim population in
France are around 8%, mostly of north African
2 Big Data & Society
descent, with the most well-known study done by the
French Institute for Demographic Studies (INED,
2010). However, with a Muslim population of only
8%, it is estimated that Muslims make up 50­70% of
the prison population (Khosrokhavar, 2013). With this
massive overrepresentation of Muslims in prison
occurring for many years before the state of emergency,
certain a priori assumptions about discrimination in
the implementation of the state of emergency can be
made. It is worth noting here that despite the secular
resistance to providing census data for the Muslim
population in prison, the French state seems to have
no qualms about making its antiterrorism programs
explicitly tied to stopping radical Islam. This can be
seen clearly in their antiradicalization campaign started
in 2014 called #alwaysachoice which provides people
with a nationwide hotline to call if they think someone
they know is becoming a radical jihadi. One of the
many problems with this approach is that it ignores
all other forms of radicalization, in favor of only
seeing radicalization as a process that happens within
Islam. For some, this level of discrimination is
explained away by the fact that most severe terrorist
attacks in France over the past five years have been
associated with ISIS, yet the degree to which the
French state selectively uses its secularization laws is
evident.
Some of the best evidence available so far regarding
how the state of emergency has been implemented by
security forces in France comes from a report by the
French national assembly, in which different security
administrators and police officers testified. One of
these officers is Colonel Charles-Antoine Thomas, the
head of the gendarmes in Val d'Oise, a region that
covers much of the northern suburbs of Paris. When
asked how long house raids usually take, Colonel
Charles-Antoine Thomas replied: ``it depends on the
amount of data that's discovered; that's what takes us
the longest. For us, the best part is the data, because
sometimes we can find signs of logistics networks,
nobody sleeps with their AK!'' (Raimbourg and
Poisson, 2016: 108). These sources point to the value
of data accumulation in the house raids under the state
of emergency. It is software like i2 Analyst's Notebook
that facilitates this type of policing, by providing a tool
that can sort, order, and present the large amount of
data collected through these raids. This approach relies
on data visualizations to analyze a high volume of data
in such a short amount of time (Seidler and Adderley,
2013).
i2Analyst's Notebook
In 2005, France purchased IBM's i2 Analyst's
Notebook (hereafter known as i2AN) in conjunction
with the beginnings of criminal analysis programs
SALVAC3 and ANACRIM4 (Polloni, (2015)). These
initiatives were part of a broader plan to bring
government data online in a centralized and easily shar-
able format. They defined how long police could keep
personal information about suspects and victims on file,
as well as created unified databases for storing this
information. ANACRIM was recently updated two
years ago to help automate the retrieval of information
from all police databases so that it can be more easily
integrated into their network analysis software, i2AN
(CNIL, 2014). According to IBM's website, i2AN,
is a visual intelligence analysis environment that can
optimize the value of massive amounts of information
collected by government agencies and businesses. With
an intuitive and contextual design it allows analysts to
quickly collate, analyze and visualize data from dispar-
ate sources while reducing the time required to discover
key information in complex data. (IBM, 2016)
One of i2AN's most important functions is to import
data from multiple datasets and produce visualizations
that will help reveal connections that would not be
made otherwise. This type of software enables police
forces to access large amounts of public data while
conserving resources and time (Kennedy et al., 2015).
Similar initiatives to digitize and centralize police rec-
ords have occurred across the world to take advantage
of policing software. If the databases are not entirely
readable by the data-mining algorithms in the software
this can lead to inefficiencies and error (Kantardzic,
2011).
Azzam et al. (2013: 8) define data visualization as
``a process that (a) is based on qualitative or quantita-
tive data and (b) results in an image that is representa-
tive of the raw data, which is (c) readable by viewers
and supports exploration, examination, and communi-
cation of the data.'' This definition helps clarify the
purpose of data visualization, which is to speak and
interpret on behalf of information that might not other-
wise have a voice. For the French police, i2AN's visu-
alization tool is most valuable in analyzing criminal
networks. This role is explained in the police journal
National Gendarme Review,
Intelligence network analysis is an essential step in the
adoption of action and a prerequisite to decision
making. i2 Analyst's Notebook permits analysts to
quickly class, analyze and visualize data from multiple
sources. It reduces the time necessary to recognize
necessary information to craft a solid and timely net-
work which allows the identification, prediction, pre-
vention and interruption of terrorist, criminal, and
fraudulent activities. (Corrieu and Sajhau, 2014: 50)

The use of the visual not only allows for a unique
view of the data, but it also represents the speed and
processing capacity of the software. In ideal circum-
stances, data visualization promotes exploration and
examination like the above definition denotes, but
sometimes the opposite is true. In certain situations, it
is possible for the visualization themselves to become
the answers instead of an interpretive tool for decision
makers.
Despite the inherent notion of objectivity in the
word data, our social world and technologies shape
and rationalize our understanding of facts. This is espe-
cially true for police work. Dealing with environments
that are constantly in flux, there is never a situation
where officers will have all the available information
on a subject or crime. Widespread use of the internet,
mobile phones, and other geolocatable technologies
(bank cards, transit pass, etc.) have vastly expanded
the data available to police departments (Alison,
2014), which have responded by introducing soft-
ware that aggregates information from multiple
databases in real time. With so much information
being processed at once, data visualization becomes a
vital component in the synthesis and comprehensibility
of data. To make the information intelligible to ana-
lysts, visualizations create cognitive shortcuts for faster
and more efficient information processing (Kantardzic,
2011).
i2AN is not a predictive policing software like the
more popular software PredPol. For PredPol, algo-
rithms play the role of the analyst once the data has
been collected (usually a process done by other algo-
rithms). What is usually meant by predictive policing is
algorithms making predictions for where and when
crime is going to occur. For i2AN, algorithms data-
mine and provide visualization readouts of that infor-
mation, but a human analyst is still required to decide
about a target or action. The level to which this soft-
ware constitutes predictive policing is based on several
factors, the most well-known being algorithms that
attempt to replace the role of the analyst in evaluating
the results of the data-mining process. However, the
presence of a human analyst does not preclude policing
from being predictive to some degree, even if it doesn't
fall under the traditional definition of predictive poli-
cing. The processes of data-mining and visualization
are correlative in nature (boyd and Crawford, 2012),
and many of these policing software are based on the-
ories of crime that value the correlations of past crimes
to predict future ones (Benbouzid, 2015). The human
analyst is still making a prediction of the future based
on past events, so the major difference between our
``predictive'' and nonpredictive policing software is
determined not by the nature of prediction, but who/
what is doing the predicting.
Clarifying the similarities is important, since much
of PredPol's popularity has come in the form of
critiques about its predictive capacities, without a
deeper evaluation of the underlying connection between
search algorithms and the state (Brakel and
Rosamunde, 2016; Kutnowski, 2017). New algorithmic
categorization has changed how power is distributed
through the coevolution of technologies and govern-
ance (Just and Lazer, 2016). Police software such as
i2AN can take the form of a list-plus-algorithm, with
the list of inputs serving as the background on which
the algorithm computes.Fleur Johns (2016: 128) traces
this problem to the protocol of list-plus-algorithm soft-
ware like i2AN.
Lists-plus-algorithms are envisaged doing many useful
things: prompting redirection of resources towards
areas of greatest need, for instance. Yet, for many,
lists-plus-algorithms dissemble as much as they dis-
close, perturb as much as they excite. Even as they
are identified with enhanced capacities of prediction
and preemption, these practices also evoke a sense of
diminished capacity[. . .]The use of list-plus-algorithm
for global governance seems, at once, an apotheosis
of rationalism and a condition of reason's demise.
For i2AN, and other similar policing software, infor-
mation about a subject or object in question is mined
from multiple private and public databases, depending
on the level of access granted to the agency in question.
The data then appear in visualization for an analyst, or
another algorithm, to evaluate. When the simple
mining of databases is not enough, the information is
extracted through more forceful measures such as a
house or business raid in which cell phones and hard
drives are confiscated. The very real threat of terrorism
in France today has exacerbated the need for the
French state to go to these extreme measures, under-
lining the diminished capacity that Johns mentions of
these algorithms to accurately identify terrorist threats.
These lists-plus-algorithms must briefly be put in
their historical context, as their development is part
and parcel to that of capitalism (Mager, 2012) and
modern warfare (Amoore, 2009). Capitalism, the liberal
democratic state's counterpart, relies on the commodity
form to organize and distribute goods. Search algo-
rithms are built to take a commodity and divide it
into its material inputs for supply chain organization
or into its constituent cultural value so that it can best
be advertised to consumers. i2AN is a direct descendent
of the decision-tree algorithms that, originally used for
retail, have now been adopted by militaries for counter-
terrorism and cybersecurity. The primary role of these
software is to ``translate probable associations between
people or objects into actionable security decisions''
4 Big Data & Society
(Amoore, 2009: 55). To accomplish this, a unified
system of addressability had to be created. Amoore
traces how the development of these technologies
went from addressability to locatability.
Addressability allows one's location to be searched,
while locatability allows one to be tracked.
Individuals are broken down into their constituent
parts and repackaged to craft a network that is
deemed the most lucrative for identifying potential sus-
pects. The ability to quickly leverage algorithmic deci-
sions about potential terrorist targets through house
and business raids increases the effectiveness of this
apparatus, which is historically linked to both com-
modification and warfare. House arrest is a highly
accurate form of locatability, where those arrested are
required to check in to a police station up to three times
a day. However, this method is costly and doesn't cast a
wide enough net. Going after a hard drive or cell phone
reduces the need to use other, traditional methods of
obtaining information such as interrogation and tor-
ture, and can provide a wealth of data on criminal net-
works that can then be analyzed with i2AN. The use of
the state of emergency to accomplish these goals can be
followed to the protocol of both i2AN and the state.
Protocol
The concept of protocol is used in many ways, with two
of the more common uses being the operations of a
technical system, and a set of administrative rules.
Both definitions are valuable in understanding how
the technical protocol of software such as i2AN reflects
administrative protocol of the French state of emer-
gency. Algorithms play a large role in surveillance
and search, and it is their technical protocol that deter-
mines how information is stored and accessed
(Galloway, 2004). Galloway defines protocol as
``against interpretation. This is to say that protocol
does little to transcode the meaning of the semantic
units of value that pass in and out of its purview''
(p. 52). Simply put, protocol is the potential for
existence within a system or software. ``The limits of
a protocological system and the limits of possibility
within that system are synonymous'' (p. 52). Protocol
is not descriptive of data pathways within software, it is
those data pathways. Understanding protocol allows
for actions by the police to be viewed through the pos-
sibilities of their software. Rather than a deterministic
view of technology's influence on policing, protocol
provides just one factor out of the many technical, pol-
itical, religious, and economic factors that shape police
action in the state of emergency.
When looking at the technical protocol of i2AN, one
can start with its GUI-WIMP interface (Graphical User
Interface-Windows, Icons, Menus, and Pointers) that is
accessed predominantly through a desktop computer.
This means that the i2AN interface responds to user's
actions with the mouse and keyboard. There are certain
affordances, imagined and material, that are present
while working with i2AN on a desktop that work
together with technical and administrative protocol to
construct possible action, (Nagy and Neff, 2015). A 2D
social network analysis, in the form of a node and link
graph, is laid on top of a GIS map, where suspects can
be dragged around the screen, enlarged with a double-
click, and ordered based on their importance. These are
all components of how criminality is visualized and
understood in i2AN.
The default screen for working on a new project in
i2AN is a blank page surrounded on the top and right-
hand sides with toolbars. To begin working the user
must import a dataset that has values recognizable to
i2AN. These datasets have been compiled by
data-mining algorithms and generally have not yet
been interpreted by a human analyst. The program
has multiple options for data visualization and gives
its user multiple options for how they want the cluster-
ing and centrality of the nodes to be weighed and
visually displayed, which augments the focus of the
graph. These options can be checked or unchecked,
leading to a large variety of outcomes based on the
user's preference. i2AN also gives users the option to
customize the weight of each link in the network to
emphasize different degrees of connection. The magni-
tude of these options is only a sampling of the various
ways a single dataset can be interpreted and is an
instructive glimpse at the possibilities of i2AN.
i2AN's use of node and link graphs for visualizing
social network analysis brings up issues of accuracy,
particularly under the state of emergency, where the
goal is to find out about future terrorist plots, or ter-
rorists, from the inside out. Node and link graphs are
not known for being a good visualization for this type
of risk (Hall et al., 2015). For these visualizations to
adequately represent the relationships between nodes,
there needs to be a clear identity distinction between the
insiders and outsiders of a network. Commenting on
node and link visualizations, Hall et al. (2015) note
that ``visualization presupposes fixed behaviour types:
insiders are either loyal or malicious. Such a distinction
complies with militaristic approaches of the past, but in
cloud computing the distinction between insiders and
outsiders is not easy to make'' (p. 95). It is important to
note that the theoretical background for terrorist net-
work analysis is still developing (Lindelauf et al., 2011).
Despite adopting theories from other fields that use
social network analysis, ``the evidence concerning
terrorist network structures however is often anec-
dotal'' (p. 63). While identity descriptors such as
name, race, gender, might be known, the meaning of
Kubler 5
that identity in terms of its threat may not be. As this
article will attempt to show, distinguishing insiders
from outsiders is a task that algorithms attempt to
accomplish. This task is central not only to the state
of emergency but to the state itself.
Administrative protocol also represents limits of
possibility, but instead of a technical structure, it
applies to a social structure. The nature of the sovereign
and the state of exception reveal the administrative
protocol of the nation-state. In allowing a sovereign
body to govern and make laws that all must follow, it
becomes quite difficult to prevent that body from
breaking its own rules. This rule of exception is a fea-
ture, not a bug of sovereign statehood.Early philosoph-
ical investigations into this dual quality of the state
begin with Schmitt C (2005), in his essay Political
Theology, where the sovereign is that which defines
the nature of exception. Further work by Ernst
Kantorowicz (1957) in, The King's Two Bodies,
looked at the dual nature of governance in medieval
Europe, coining the popular phrase ``body politic.''
To reference the above quote by Fleur Johns (2016:
128) that the state is the only one to both set the
rules and call time out is both ``an apotheosis of ration-
alism and a condition of reason's demise.''
The contemporary philosophical work on the state
of exception is centered around Giorgio Agamben's
(1995), Homo Sacer series, which draws heavily from
both Schmitt and Kantorowicz. At the surface, it seems
easy to separate exception and rule into two different
legal categories, but Agamben stresses that exceptional
legal circumstances in fact define the rule. ``Only
because its validity is suspended in the state of excep-
tion can positive law define the normal case as the
realm of its own validity'' (p. 17). The ontologically
inseparable connection between rule and exception
demonstrates the administrative protocol of sovereign
statehood. The state of emergency is thus a defining
feature of the French state, used to redefine who it con-
siders as citizens internal to its rule, and who it con-
siders as external threats. How algorithms affect this
distinction between inside and out is discussed further
in the section on identity and exception. Both adminis-
trative and technological protocol shape policing and
the use of algorithms, and it is through this lens that the
state of emergency can be used to question theories of
power and posthegemony.
Power and surveillance
The implications of algorithmic police surveillance in
France must be evaluated in the context of theories of
power and hegemony. Along with developments of
postmodernism in the second half of the 20th century,
critiques of modernist analyses of power began to
emerge from thinkers such as Michel Foucault and
Jean Baudrillard. This line of thinking has involved
the term ``posthegemony,'' which replaces structuralist
narratives of power from above with power from within
or below. The modern usage of hegemony is commonly
associated with Antonio Gramsci, to refer to a source
of totally dominating power, be it the state, capital,
colonialism, etc. Many others have taken up this term
in different disciplines, with a notable example being
Stuart Hall in cultural studies. It is through this con-
ception of hegemony within cultural studies that Scott
Lash roots the move to posthegemony. One of the
tenants of this theory relies on how we perceive and
communicate data, information, and fact. Lash points
to the algorithm being an integral medium for commu-
nicating power and domination in a posthegemonic era
(Lash, 2007).
For Lash, the difference between hegemony and
posthegemony relies on where power is located. ``The
hegemon is above. It is outside and over. In the post-
hegemonic order, power comes to act from below: it no
longer stays outside that which it `effects'. It becomes
instead immanent in its object and its processes''
(Lash, 2007: 61). One of the mediations of this power
from below is in ``a change from an extensive (and
hegemonic) regime of representation to an intensive
regime of communication'' (Lash, 2007: 56). Following
theories of networks and the multitude from Hardt and
Negri's Empire, Lash sees posthegemonic control in the
communication networks made constant by ubiquitous
media and the protocol through which the media tech-
nologies are constructed. Since many agree we are in
the era of ubiquitous media and computing, the poten-
tial for algorithms to produce posthegemonic power is
vast (Kitchin, 2017; Lash, 2007). In this sense, the algo-
rithm does embody posthegemonic power from below
since it is embedded in the architecture of mediated
communication. Data becomes a higher priority for
police because mediated, and thus searchable, record-
able, and organizable, actions encompass a greater por-
tion of total human actions. When viewing power at the
level of the algorithm, a shift to posthegemony seems
plausible. However, forms of data extraction seen in the
state of emergency in France place the role of the algo-
rithm within a broader structure of state power,
demonstrating the limits of posthegemony.
If the necessary power to control society was pro-
duced only from below, through our networked com-
munication and with the help of algorithms, there
would be no need for the state of emergency, or perhaps
even the state itself. The state of exception demon-
strates the necessary separation of inside and outside,
above and below, that is constitutive of the state.
Algorithms as material lines of code reflect this separ-
ation as well. They interpret information from the
6 Big Data & Society
inside, to produce a result from the outside. It is the act
of interpreting, through code and visualization, that
defines this separation in the use of algorithms. When
interpreting the use of data and information under
posthegemony Lash writes: ``in the post-hegemonic
age the concept is dis-intermediated and we come up
against facts as raw sense data. In their rawness, facts
come very much alive'' (p. 64). It may be the case that
we as subjects encounter this raw sense data, but the
goal of i2AN for the French police, however successful,
is to remove this rawness and make the data compre-
hensible so that it can be acted upon. The state of emer-
gency exists as an admittance of the failure of
posthegemonic forms of power to guarantee social
peace. i2AN may help govern from below in some post-
hegemonic fashion, but the data it receives, extracted
from house and business raids, demonstrates the hege-
monic form of domination that still persists.
Following the move to posthegemony, the term post-
panopticon has been used in the field of surveillance
studies by Zygmunt Bauman, and David Lyon, in
tandem with the phrase liquid modernity. The concept
of liquid modernity is analogous to posthegemony in
that it highlights the flexible nature of control and
power. Postpanopticon describes a mode of surveil-
lance that is not determined by direct state observation,
as was the case with Jeremy Bentham's panopticon, but
by indirect monitoring, prediction, and self-surveillance
(Bauman and Lyon, 2013). Self-surveillance to this
degree is made possible by ubiquitous media use and
algorithms. Postpanoptical prediction creates what
Lyon calls a data double. ``The information that
proxies for the person is made up of `personal data'
only in the sense that it originated with a person's
body and may affect their life chances and choices''
(p. 8). This is how i2AN operates, by creating a con-
glomerate of data points about an individual and trying
to connect them to a network of other potential sus-
pects. Finally, Bauman sees the traditional era of pan-
opticon surveillance still in operation today, but only
for certain people. In the era of liquid modernity, more
hegemonic forms of panopticon surveillance operate at
the social margins, in prisons, at borders, and the out-
skirts, while those with more social value and wealth
are surveilled at a postpanoptical distance (Bauman
and Lyon, 2013). What is of interest here is what
these theories of surveillance can tell us about the cur-
rent state of emergency in France and what role the
algorithm plays.
As mentioned above, the state of emergency exposes
the state as a traditional, hegemonic form of power,
despite methods of control that might be deemed post-
hegemonic. The state of emergency is the enclosure and
reduction of the free space that was previously pur-
chased by social classes willing, and able, to surveil
themselves. In the case of house arrests, the social mar-
gins creep into everyday life, making the home a prison,
and the neighborhood a border. One of the central
functions of the house raid is to help police forces
redraw these boundaries by gathering data of criminal
networks. This is demonstrated in a conversation
between the minister of justice, Jean-Jacques Urvoas,
and the departmental director of public security in
Loiret, Pascal Belin.
Urvoas: In your opinion, is intelligence gathering the
main benefit of the state of emergency?
Belin: I would say the interest in house raids has dimin-
ished really quickly. For example, with this group of
Chechens, the first house arrest and raid focused on the
treasure of the group; the examination of their
computers - with documents in cyrillic . . . - that was
very interesting. But the rest of the group quickly
went underground. The house raids were no longer
valuable: we found wiped telephones, no call records,
no text messages, no contacts . . . just like the com-
puters, completely empty. (Raimbourg and Poisson,
2016: 121)
While arresting criminals and ending the threat of ter-
rorism are clearly the overall goals of the state of emer-
gency, the more immediate and specific goal of the
house arrest and raid, as tactic, is access to data that
would not be available under normal legal circum-
stances. Those that previously existed at a postpanop-
tical distance, now feel the immediacy of hegemonic
state power. With this information, one's data double
can be used to discover criminal networks and lead to
future arrests.
Identity and exception
Surveillance tools that function using algorithms bring
up questions of identity and formation of subjectivity
under the state. Cheney-Lippold's ``A new algorithmic
identity'' (2013) explores this topic extensively and
offers a base on which identity in the state of emergency
can be analyzed. Cheney-Lippold uses Deleuze's theory
of the dividual and Foucault's work on biopolitics and
power to argue that algorithmic search and surveillance
create floating, adaptable identities, analogous to
Bauman and Lyon's data double. This allows for soft
forms of state control, as seen in the posthegemonic
era, to replace the hard power of previous state discip-
line. ``Many mechanisms of control have shifted to
practices external to the body, where discipline has
often become more or less unnecessary if control can
be enacted through a series of guiding, determining,
and persuasive mechanisms of power'' (pp. 168­169).
This form of control creates dividuality, an idea
Kubler 7
originating with Deleuze, which refers to individuality
that is constantly subdivided into constituent parts, or
dividuals. ``These dividuals become the axiom of con-
trol, the recipients through which power flows as sub-
jectivity takes a deconstructed dive into the digital era''
(p. 169). Control in this sense is the form of power that
modulates conditions of possibility without direct, dis-
ciplinary uses of force. It seems that while softer forms
of control certainly fit with some of the technical proto-
col of search and surveillance algorithms, this does not
exclude those algorithms from also serving hard discip-
line. The example of France during the state of emer-
gency shows that those algorithms can be used for
disciplinary roles, while still treating the citizen as a
dividual. After all, the goal of the state of emergency
in creating dividuality through i2AN is to capture ter-
rorists, the hyper-targeted individual.
The raid and house arrest are tactics that perform a
particular type of surveillance. They are conducted on
individuals that could be dangerous to the state, but
who do not have enough evidence against them to be
arrested. Their dividuality, or data double, has not soli-
dified into a credible identity for the state, and thus
requires further investigation. This identity monitoring
during the state of emergency is explained again by
Pascal Belin during his testimony to the French
National Assembly.
In three fourths of the cases, the house raids allowed us
to check up on people who had been signaled to us as
having a troubling change in behavior or talked about
supporting Daesh: we could see, at these people's own
homes, if these signs were just associated with a general
unhappiness, or if it was something more serious.
(Raimbourg and Poisson, 2016: 121).
This type of verification is another instance of an
enclosure of borders coming from above, when the
tactic of surveillance from below is insufficient. The
state of emergency is the admittance of an increased
threat level that requires a reconfiguration of data dou-
bles and dividualities, to more precisely surveil certain
populations. Where Bauman and Lyon urge us to think
of a liquid modernity with data flows and networks as
sources of power, the house raid is a reminder of the
state's desire to monitor and appropriate them.
What is at play here is not only the question of how
to coherently make sense of the massive amounts of
data that get plugged into these lists-plus-algorithms,
but how this process of mining, visualization, and ana-
lysis changes the nature of the subjects that the data
represent. The algorithm calculates correlations
from the list that is definite, ordered, and yet endlessly
alterable; this combination of protocols is what Johns
(2016: 128) calls hybridization.To go further into
algorithmic decision making, Diakopoulos (2016) div-
ides it into four different parts: prioritizing,
classification, association, and filtering. These tasks
are shared by both list and algorithm in a way that
makes transparency and regulation difficult.
In theory, it is the judicial system of liberal democracies
that is supposed to defend the civil liberties of individ-
uals against unlawful search and identification from
these algorithms. In many cases this means restricting
these algorithms from working at their full potential.
Only certain information about subjects can be used at
a certain time or only with permission from a judge.
In France, along with many other countries, the collec-
tion and sorting of data for commercial and judicial
purposes is common place. The state of emergency
allows for these practices of information gathering by
the police to take place without the normal judicial
restraint.
Deferred decision making from state to algorithm is
elaborated by Dan McQuillan in ``Algorithmic states of
exception.'' Drawing from Agamben's notion of homo
sacer, McQuillan urges us ``to look at the nature of the
material-political apparatus that connects data to deci-
sion-making and governance'' (p. 565). For Agamben's
thesis that Western law has placed nation-states in a
permanent state of exception, there is perhaps no
better example than France's ever-extending state of
emergency. Ontologically this state of exception puts
the state in a position of ``being-outside and yet belong-
ing'' which McQuillan correlates to the nature of
algorithms in governance. The tension of power from
above versus below, and inside versus outside, are
brought up once again. Since the sovereign nation-
state can both make laws and exempt itself from
them, it is both outside the purview of its own laws,
while being fundamentally bound to their creation. As
terrorism threatens to undermine the foundations of
the western nation-state, the state must reciprocally cir-
cumvent its own legal system to defend itself.
For McQuillan, the fear is that ``the new algorithmic
apparatus can be characterized by the production of
states of exception'' (p. 578) indicating not just a lack
of legal protection, but a fundamental inability of law
to deal with these issues since they are themselves legal.
This means that the somewhat autonomous nature of
these algorithmic apparatuses has the potential to be as
ungovernable as the state itself. Expanding on this def-
inition of algorithmic states of exception, the example
of i2AN highlights ways that algorithms can alter and
exacerbate states of exception that are not their own.
It is not that i2AN has created its own state of excep-
tion, but rather that it has been embedded into that of
the state, with the same extrajudicial predicament as the
original homo sacer in Ancient Greece. i2AN creates the
visual and geographic boundaries for a state that treats
8 Big Data & Society
its subjects as data-mining opportunities. Above, it was
the state itself that was treated as ``being-outside yet
belonging,'' but it is through this relation that
Agamben points to the state's ability to use measures
such as a state of emergency to render its own subjects
as also ``being-outside yet belonging.'' Being the subject
of extrajudicial house raids and arrests situates citizens
belonging to the state at the same time as it removes
them from the regular judicial system, the being-outside
the law. The ability to split the subject in this way is an
example of algorithmic identity dividing the individual
into multiple dividual parts. Algorithmic identity is
blurred at the level of the dividual, being outside of
specific categories, yet each subject has the potential
to be the homo sacer, or the terrorist. It is in this
sense that the police raid and house arrest, as tactic
of the state of emergency, creates the homo sacer. The
criminality is undetermined at first, with the raid ser-
ving as an identity adjustment period through data
extraction and analysis. For some this adjustment
comes quickly, but for others, this liminal period of
house arrest can last over a year (Pascual, 2016b).
Conclusion
The role that algorithms play in policing during the state
of emergency in France is complex and subject to con-
stant change. From a theoretical standpoint, the oper-
ations of i2AN's lists-plus-algorithm and its visual
component challenge ontological conceptions of indi-
vidual state subjects. I have attempted to show how
the creation of dividual state subjects and data doubles,
through algorithms can be used for hard state power, or
discipline, as well as soft biopolitics or surveillance. Not
only are the data-driven police raids a clear form of
hard, disciplinary power, but they also expose the
basis through which posthegemonic soft power regimes
of control are created. Just as the carrot rarely works
without the threat of the stick, it is also the stick that
makes one interested in the carrot in the first place.
This analysis of i2AN is only a glimpse of the differ-
ent roles played by algorithm and the state. I argue that
the data sorting and mining capabilities of i2AN allow
data collection to be a feasible means of policing, which
has taken the form of raids and house arrests during the
state of emergency. The form of data extraction reflects
the technical protocol of i2AN, just as the state of
emergency reflects the administrative protocol of the
liberal nation-state. A task for further research is an
in-depth look at how police analysts directly interact
with i2AN and what effect that has had on police oper-
ations. Considering the ways in which social conditions
influence relationships between decision making and
technology is incredibly valuable and can add much
to the theoretical grounding presented in this paper.
Raids and house arrests provide the French police
with a massive amount of information about a select
population that they would not have without the legal
exemptions of the state of emergency. With a justice
system that is both racially and religiously discrimin-
atory, the data extraction taking place exacerbates
existing inequalities and has the potential to do so
even after the state of emergency comes to an end.
Theories of postpanopticon surveillance or posthege-
monic power get us part of the way in understanding
how control is mediated through algorithms but they
must not neglect theories of hegemony that came before
them. To develop a framework for how algorithms
influence power, surveillance, and identity, we must
continue to refine and develop theory that reflects con-
temporary examples of policing such as France's state
of emergency.

Notes
1. For this paper, I'm using the term ``police'' in a broad sense
to encompass all forms of law enforcement. Specifically, the
three groups of law enforcement that carry out the majority
of the house raids and arrest are the local police forces, the
gendarmes (a mix between a state trooper and the national
guard), and the DGSI (the French FBI).
