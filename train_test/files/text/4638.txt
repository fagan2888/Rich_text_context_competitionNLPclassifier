Abstract
Two hypotheses have been advanced in the recent literature with respect to the so-called
Interlanguage Speech Intelligibility Benefit (ISIB): a nonnative speaker will be better understood by
a another nonnative listener than a native speaker of the target language will be (a) only when the
nonnatives share the same native language (matched interlanguage) or (b) even when the
nonnatives have different mother tongues (non-matched interlanguage). Based on a survey of
published experimental materials, the present article will demonstrate that both the restricted
(a) and the generalized (b) hypotheses are false when the ISIB effect is evaluated in terms of
absolute intelligibility scores. We will then propose a simple way to compute a relative measure for
the ISIB (R-ISIB), which we claim is a more insightful way of evaluating the interlanguage benefit,
and test the hypotheses in relative (R-ISIB) terms on the same literature data. We then find that
our R-ISIB measure only supports the more restricted hypothesis (a) while rejecting the more
general hypothesis (b). This finding shows that the native language shared by the interactants biases
the listener toward interpreting sounds in terms of the phonology of the shared mother tongue.

rigorously quantify relevant data in a meta-analysis. It is commonly recognized that native
speakers and native listeners outperform foreign speakers and listeners of the language. For
instance, native (L1) listeners generally find fellow native talkers more intelligible than
nonnative (L2) talkers, particularly in noisy conditions (Munro, 1998; Munro & Derwing,
1995). L1 speakers cause fewer word perception errors than foreign speakers of the language
do. In a classical study, word recognition by native listeners for Serbian-, Japanese- and
Punjabi-accented English was some 36% poorer than for native English speech in a range
of signal-to-noise ratios and filtering conditions (Lane, 1967). More recently, it was shown
that the word error rate of English spoken with a Mandarin accent was 11% against a mere
4% for native American control speakers, when in both cases the listeners were Americans
(Munro & Derwing, 1995). Using a different methodology, native-speaker superiority was
measured in terms of the speech reception threshold, that is, the noise level at which 50% of
the words in the test materials are correctly recognized. Speech reception threshold was found
to be at a 4-dB poorer signal-to-noise ratio when the Dutch listeners responded to Dutch
speakers, than when the speakers were British learners of Dutch (Van Wijngaarden, 2001).
By the same token, L1 listeners have better scores, faster recognition times, and withstand
more adverse listening conditions than L2 listeners do -- at least when the test materials are
recorded from fellow L1 speakers. Native listeners are better at recognizing degraded speech
(telephone speech, synthetic speech, speech in noise) than nonnative speakers. For instance,
Dutch listeners could recognize Dutch words from shorter onset portions than English
learners of Dutch, even if the latter had resided in the Netherlands for 20 years or more
(Nooteboom & Truin, 1980).
In the studies summarized earlier, information is exchanged between a native speaker and a
native listener as the control condition and a native/nonnative pair of interactants for the
experimental condition. In this comparison the native/nonnative pair is consistently
outperformed by the native/native control pairs. Note that the comparison does not involve
pairs of interactants who are both nonnative speakers of the language used. Somewhat
surprisingly, it has been observed that nonnative speakers may be more intelligible than native
speakers when the listener is also nonnative. Indeed, second-language learners often report that
the speech of a fellow nonnative talker is easier to understand than the speech of a native talker.
Bent and Bradlow (2003) advanced two hypotheses with respect to this phenomenon. The first
hypothesis holds that a foreign talker of a language is more intelligible to any foreign listener of
that language than a native speaker is. This is what Bent and Bradlow call the non-matched (or
``mixed'') interlanguage speech intelligibility benefit (ISIB). Early evidence in support of this
hypothesis has been provided by Nash (1969). The second, more restricted, hypothesis predicts
that a foreign talker will be more intelligible to a foreign listener (than a native talker would be)
only if the foreign talker and listener share the same mother tongue. This is what Bent and
Bradlow call the matched (or ``shared'') interlanguage benefit.
The theoretical underpinning of the unrestricted hypothesis seems tenuous. It has been
observed that nonnative talkers speak rather slowly and hesitantly, which would benefit
anyone who would have problems with decoding the message (e.g., Derwing & Munro,
2001). The slow speed of delivery and the insertion of pauses when the speaker is looking
for words would allow the nonnative listener time to integrate what has been heard and to
predict upcoming words. The beneficial effect of insertion of pauses (with compensation for
slower rate of delivery) has been demonstrated for low-quality Dutch speech synthesis and
for natural Dutch speech in noise (Scharpff, 1994; Scharpff & Van Heuven, 1988; Van
Heuven & Scharpff, 1991), as well as for Danish perceived by Swedish listeners (Gooskens
& Van Bezooijen, 2014). Moreover, the foreign talker will use a fairly restricted vocabulary
comprising high-frequency words only (e.g., Cervatiuc, 2008; Milton & Meara, 1995) so that
2 i-Perception 6(6)
the listeners will not often be confronted with unfamiliar words. The benefit will probably
disappear, we would argue, if the test materials were produced by a native speaker of the
target language and manipulated such that the words and sentence structures (after minimal
correction) and the gross temporal organization (speed of delivery as well location and length
of pauses) would be the same as that used by the nonnative talker. We are not aware of any
such study, however, so that our objection remains speculative.
Arguments supporting this more restricted hypothesis have been provided by many
studies, for example, Smith and Rafiqzad (1979), Van Wijngaarden (2001), Van
Wijngaarden, Steeneken, and Houtgast (2002), Imai, Flege and Walley (2003), Wang and
Van Heuven (2003, 2004, 2006), and Wang (2007). Native speakers have a vast knowledge of
the statistical regularities at all linguistic levels (sounds, syllables, morphemes, words, and
sentences) and skillfully use any redundancy that may exist in the native language system
(Cutler, 2012). These skills are much less developed in nonnative listeners. The sound
categories of the target language are less well defined in the perceptual representation of
nonnatives, and transitional probabilities that allow the native listener to predict upcoming
sounds (or restore sounds that were missed) are not known to (let alone used by) the
nonnative listener. This does not only apply to nonnative listeners who have learned the
foreign language as adults, but it has been shown that even the sound categories in a second
language that was acquired before the age of four (i.e., by so-called early bilinguals) are less
well defined than for monolingual listeners (Sebastian-Galles & Soto Faraco, 1999).
Bent and Bradlow (2003) tested both hypotheses in one integrated experiment and claim that
they found evidence in support of both. They point out that specific combinations of foreign
speaker and listener language backgrounds yield better intelligibility scores than combinations
involving a native speaker or listener, both when language backgrounds of the foreign speakers
and listeners are mixed and when they are shared. However, the authors do not quantify the
effect in a way that allows the reader to determine the magnitude of the interlanguage benefit, nor
to check whether the benefit is larger for the shared interlanguage than for the mixed
interlanguage situation. We would argue that this is an undesirable state of affairs. In fact, it
is our contention that in none of the studies we are aware of (see below) has the ISIB been
quantified and tested in an adequate way. More specifically we criticize the implicit choice in the
literature to examine the ISIB in terms of absolute scores obtained by groups of listeners. This is a
statistically inadequate and nai¨ve way of testing the ISIB. Rather, we will argue that the ISIB
should be evaluated in a relative manner, using insights from linear modeling, such that the
relative ISIB (R-ISIB) is defined as the magnitude of the statistical interaction term that is needed
on top of the main effects of speaker and listener language in order to make an error-free
prediction of the absolute scores. We will demonstrate the feasibility and superiority of our
approach by making a systematic comparison of ISIB and R-ISIB values in a reanalysis of a
number of published studies (in fact, all published studies that exist and speak to the issue).
We will briefly introduce the basic idea behind linear modeling and explain the difference
between main effects and interactions. We will illustrate the (simple) computational method
to express the magnitude of the (shared or mixed) interlanguage benefit and then reanalyze
the results of a number of earlier studies on these phenomena. This meta-analytic exercise will
show, first of all, that the proposed relative measure of the interlanguage benefit yields the
predicted effects (much more clearly so than when some absolute measure of the benefit is
applied), and that the benefit is indeed larger when speakers and listeners have a shared native
language between them than when the interactants have different native languages.
Moreover, the meta-analysis will reveal that the mutual intelligibility is poorest when one
of the interlocutors (whether speaker or listener) is native and the other is nonnative. We will
call this the case of the native-speaker handicap.

A Relative (R-ISIB)
Linear modeling is a statistical technique that allows a researcher to decompose the relationship
between stimulus properties and response scores into main effects and interactions between
main effects (e.g., Philips, 1999, pp. 131­142; Yamane, 1973, pp. 865­874).
Table 1 presents data taken from a study described in more detail by Wang (2007), Van
Heuven and Wang (2007), and Wang and Van Heuven (2014) -- see also Meta-Analysis:
Testing the ISIB Hypotheses on Aggregated Data section. In an experiment, one
representative male and one female speaker were selected from a larger peer group
comprising 10 male and 10 female speakers for each of three native language
backgrounds, that is, Mandarin-Chinese, Dutch, and American English. These speakers
had produced the vowels of English in a fixed/hVd/context, which were then offered for
forced choice identification to groups of Chinese, Dutch, and American English listeners
(N ¼ 36 for each listener group). Per speaker group the one male and female speaker had
been selected with the shortest Euclidean distance from the peer group centroid in a two-
dimensional plane defined by correct vowel identification and correct consonant
identification by listeners in an earlier experiment who shared the language background of
the speakers (shared interlanguage).
The linear model decomposes the scores in each of the nine cells (as listed in part of
Table 1) in terms of their deviation from the grand mean, both in the speaker dimension
and in the listener dimension (part B). The grand mean of the nine scores equals 49.
Subtracting the grand mean from all cell scores does not affect any of the differences
between cell scores, it just adjusts the grand mean to zero. In linear modeling, the cell
scores are then represented as the arithmetic addition of three components: (a) the main
effect of speaker group, that is, the deviation from xi
þ (b) the main effect of listener group,
that is, the deviation from yj
þ , (c) the interaction between speaker and listener group, that is,
whatever adjustment is needed to make the addition of all three components match the cell
contents. The interaction term for each cell is what is needed to bridge the gap between the
cell score that is expected on the basis of the linear addition of the main effects of speaker
group and listener group (the ``expected'' score) and the actual ``observed'' score for that cell.
We argue that the interaction component, that is, the difference Á between the expected and
observed score for a cell in Table 1 is the magnitude of R-ISIB.
Table 2 rearranges the scores in Table 1 in a format that is better suited to illustrate how
the components of the linear model are obtained. The observed scores (column marked

``Obs.'') are the mean percent correct vowel identification scores for each of the nine
combinations of speaker and listener language backgrounds, copied from Table 1. In
absolute terms, the best intelligibility scores are obtained when both speakers and listeners
are native (75% correct vowel identification). It is not the case, however, that native-
nonnative speaker-listener combinations yield consistently poorer intelligibility scores than
pairs exclusively involving nonnative interactants -- in contradistinction to what the
interlanguage intelligibility benefit hypothesis predicts. In fact, the poorest results are
obtained when both speakers and listeners are Chinese (30%), and the best result is found
for the combination of Dutch listeners to American speakers (61%). Nor is it the case that
nonnative speaker-listener combinations that share the same language between them (30%
for Chinese­Chinese and 59% for Dutch­Dutch) yield consistently better scores than mixed
nonnative combinations (34% and 40% for Chinese­Dutch and Dutch­Chinese,
respectively). Clearly, then, testing the ISIB hypothesis in absolute terms fails miserably.
Now let us look at these results in rather more relative terms. I argue that the 30% correct
vowel identification obtained by the Chinese-Chinese speaker-listener combination, although
the lowest score of all in absolute terms, is in fact much better than should be expected in
comparison with the other scores. Table 2 shows that the 30% vowel identification score is
better than what would be expected on the basis of the linear addition of the main effects
of speaker group and listener group. The difference is, in fact, 8 points, that is, a R-ISIB
value of 8.
The computation involves the following steps.
(1) Compute the grand mean score across all speaker­listener combinations. This is 49%
correct in the present example (see bottom row).
(2) Next, compute the mean score for each of the speaker groups (by averaging over the
listener groups). For instance, the mean score for Chinese speakers is 39 (see column
Table 2. Expected Vowel Identification Scores (% Correct) on the Basis of Grand Mean (¼ 49%) and Main
Effects for Listener and Speaker L1.

Note. Means for listener groups and speaker groups are specified, as well as the effect of group membership (i.e., group

from the grand mean. Observed scores (Obs.) and residuals (Á) are indicated. Shaded rows contain speaker­listener

speaker-mean), which is the mean of Chinese speakers combined with Chinese, Dutch,
and American listeners, with scores of 30%, 40%, and 50%, respectively (see column
Obs.).1
(3) Likewise, compute the mean scores for each of the listener groups, averaged over
speakers. This yields mean scores of 33%, 53%, and 61% for Chinese, Dutch, and
American listeners, respectively (see column listener-mean).
(4) Then compute the deviation of the speaker means from the grand mean by subtraction.
For instance, the mean of the Chinese speaker group (39%) is 10 points below the grand
mean of 49%, hence a deviation of À10 (see column speaker-effect).
(5) Similarly, compute the deviation of each listener group mean from the grand mean.
The mean of the Chinese listener group (33%) is 16 points below the grand mean,
hence a deviation of À16 (see column listener-effect).
(6) Then compute the expected score for each speaker­listener combination, by adding the
speaker group deviation and the listener group deviation to the grand mean. In the
case of the Chinese-Chinese speaker-listener combination this would be 49% (grand
mean)À16 (listener group deviation)À10 (speaker group deviation) ¼ 22% (see column
Exp.).2
(7) Finally, compute the prediction error (``residual'') for each speaker­listener combination,
which is the difference between the expected and the observed score. This gap between
expected and observed scores is then closed by the interaction component in the linear
model. For the Chinese­Chinese combination, we expect 22% (top data row, column
Exp.) but find 30% (same row, column Obs.), so that the residual equals þ8 points (same
row, column Á). This is the value for R-ISIB.3 Note that the mean R-ISIB for each row
and each column in the matrix, as well as for the matrix in its entirety, should always add
up to zero, since positive and negative prediction errors should cancel each other out.
When the listeners are Chinese, Dutch, and American, the expected mean scores are À16,
þ4, and þ12 relative to the grand mean; for the three speaker language backgrounds, the
expected mean should be additionally corrected with À10, þ3, and þ7, respectively.
Note here that the size of the increments/decrements is larger for listener language
background than for speaker language background, that is, the listener effect is larger than
the speaker effect.
Generally, the observed scores are correctly predicted or even overestimated by the linear
addition of the two main effects. Only in three combinations of factor levels is the observed
score substantially better than the prediction. These are precisely the conditions in which the
listeners are confronted with vowel tokens spoken by their fellow countrymen (``shared
interlanguage'', shaded rows in Table 2). The native or interlanguage benefit is 4 to 8
percentage points better than the expected score. It appears that there is no need to
differentiate between communication between a native speaker and a native listener (with a
R-ISIB of þ7 points, which could be called a ``native-language benefit'') and communication
between a nonnative speaker and a nonnative listener who share the same native language
(þ4 and þ8 points for Dutch and Chinese matched interlanguage groups, respectively): in
both situations the residual is of comparable, positive magnitude.
In the case of a speaker­listener combination with a mixed interlanguage, the R-ISIB is
very close to zero: À1 for Dutch-Chinese and À2 for Chinese-Dutch). This would indicate
that, indeed, the shared interlanguage yields a substantially greater benefit than the mixed
interlanguage. There are too few observations to run any meaningful statistics on the
difference; this we will do in the next section of this article where we will test this effect on
data aggregated over a number of studies.
6 i-Perception 6(6)
R-ISIB is most negative when the speaker­listener combination involves one native and
one nonnative party. Here the R-ISIB ranges between À1 and À6 points. Again, we will defer
statistical testing of the significance of this native-language handicap until we have sufficient
aggregate data.
In the next section, we will first provide some background on the idea of linear modeling and
then explain the computational procedure that should be applied to compute the proposed
relative measure of interlanguage benefit. Here we will use an example taken from Wang
(2007). In the later sections, we will reanalyze earlier results by Smith and Rafiqzad (1979), by
Bent and Bradlow (2003) and the set of six tests used by Wang (2007). As far as we have been
able to ascertain, these are the only studies that have been published on mutual intelligibility in
English comparing speaker and listener groups from more than just two (i.e., native English vs.
one nonnative language group) different nonnative language backgrounds.
Meta-Analysis: Testing the ISIB Hypotheses on Aggregated Data
In this section, we will test the restricted (shared interlanguage) and generalized (mixed
interlanguage) versions of the ISIB hypothesis on a collection of data taken from three
studies that address the issue. Where individual studies contain too few data to do any
meaningful statistical evaluation of the versions of the hypotheses, we claim that aggregate
data from multiple studies do afford this possibility. In the next subsection, we will briefly
describe the studies that underlie the meta-analysis, then formulate quantitative predictions
and proceed with a statistical analysis of the aggregate data.
Literature Data
Smith and Rafiqzad (1979). The earliest study to compare the intelligibility of native and
nonnative English in a sufficiently complete matrix of speaker and listener groups with a
variety of language backgrounds was probably done by Smith and Rafiqzad (1979). In this
study, the authors recorded materials from educated L2 speakers of English in seven Asian
countries, viz. Hong Kong, India, Japan, Korea, Malaysia, Nepal, and the Philippines.
Similar materials were collected from native speakers of American English. Unfortunately,
the design was incomplete in that no materials of any speaker group were presented to
American native listeners. There were also nonnative listener groups that were never used
as speakers -- these I pruned from the matrix below.4 The materials were presented to the
seven relevant listener groups in a Cloze test, in which listeners saw a printed version of the
audible text, with every sixth word replaced by a blank to be filled in. A detailed analysis of
the results both in terms of ISIB and of R-ISIB, as was demonstrated for the Wang's (2007)
vowel identification experiment in A Relative R-ISIB section, is presented in Van Heuven
(2015; Tables 2 and 3). Here we will not dwell on the intermediate steps but concentrate on a
comparison of effects across all meta-analytic data.
Bent and Bradlow (2003). Bent and Bradlow (2003) examined the interlanguage benefit in a
database with mutual intelligibility scores in English obtained for five types of speakers: one
high-proficiency and one low-proficiency Korean L2 speaker of English, one high-proficiency
and one low-proficiency Chinese L2 speaker of English, and one native speaker of American
English. Sentences produced by these five (female) speakers were presented to four groups of
listeners with Chinese (N ¼ 21), Korean (N ¼ 10), American (N ¼ 21), and mixed-foreign
(N ¼ 12) backgrounds. Intelligibility scores were determined for all 5 Â 4 ¼ 20 combinations
of speaker and hearer L1 backgrounds.
Wang and van Heuven 7
The scores were not expressed in percentages but in rationalized arcsine units (RAUs).
The arcsine transform was applied by Bent and Bradlow to unwarp the bottom and top
ranges of the percentage scale in order to compensate for bottom and ceiling effects. After
``rationalisation'' the transformed scale extends between À17 and þ117 RAU; 50
RAU ¼ 50% (Studebaker, 1985). For the purpose of this meta-analysis, we will treat the
RAU scores as if they were percentages. This decision is motivated by the consideration that
whatever distortion the arcsine transformation may have introduced, the choice between
percentages and RAUs will not affect the difference between absolute and relative ISIB.
For details of the results, see Van Heuven (2015: Tables 4 and 5). The absolute and
relative (R-ISIB) scores were transferred to the aggregate data.
Wang (2007). Wang (2007) ran a large study on the mutual intelligibility of Dutch, Mandarin,
and American speakers of English. Twenty speakers (10 males, 10 females) from each of these
three different native-language backgrounds produced materials in English, that is, (a) vowels
in a /hVd/ context, (b) consonants and (c) consonant clusters in intervocalic contexts, (d)
semantically unpredictable sentences, (e) semantically meaningful sentences with final target
words in unpredictable (``non-pregnant''), and (f) predictable (``pregnant'') contexts.
The materials of one representative male and one female speaker for each of the three
language backgrounds were then offered for identification (of vowels, consonants, and
clusters) or recognition (of words in sentences) to 36 listeners in each of three countries 36
learners of English at Changchun University (Mandarin language area), 36 learners of
English at Leiden University (Netherlands), and 36 American native listeners at the
University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), so that all nine possible combinations of
speaker and listener backgrounds occurred equally often in the experiment.
Predictions
We will now perform a statistical analysis across all data that were discussed above. We will
specifically test two related hypotheses. The first is that (1a) there will be a strong
interlanguage intelligibility benefit such that two nonnatives with the same mother tongue

will understand each other in English best when speaking a foreign language (shared
interlanguage), (1b) two nonnatives with different native language backgrounds will
understand each other more poorly (mixed interlanguage), and (1c) the poorest
intelligibility will be observed when a nonnative communicates with a native speaker
(whether as speaker or as listener). The second hypothesis is that these predictions will be
borne out more clearly when using the relative measure of the ISIB than when looking at
absolute intelligibility scores.
Results of the Meta-Analysis
The aggregate data contain 130 cases, that is, the total number of speaker­listener group
combinations accumulated across the studies reviewed in the preceding subsections, that is, 7
(listener language backgrounds) Â 8 (speaker language backgrounds) ¼ 56 combinations
taken from Smith and Rafiqzad (1979), 4 Â 5 ¼ 20 combinations from Bent and Bradlow
(2003), and 6 (tests) Â 3 (listener groups) Â 3 (speaker groups) ¼ 54 combinations from
Wang (2007). The six tests from Wang (2007) were treated as independent, on the strength
of the observation that there were no significant correlations between the scores obtained on
the six tests (see Wang 2007, chap. 10). Table 3 presents the mean ISIB and R-ISIB values for
four types of speaker­listener group combinations, that is, combinations yielding (a) shared
interlanguage, (b) mixed interlanguage, (c) native/nonnative pair, and (d) native-native pairs
(as a control condition).
In terms of absolute interlanguage benefit, the results indicate that native-speaker-native-
listener pairs yield near-ceiling intelligibility scores (93%), which is about 30 percentage
points better than any of the three combinations involving one or two nonnative
interactants; these three speaker­listener combinations do not differ from each other by a
posthoc comparison of means (Bonferroni-corrected, after one-way analysis of variance, see
Table 3). The results obviously contradict the hypothesis that there is any benefit to be gained
by nonnatives, whether they do or do not share an interlanguage: all nonnatives are equally
handicapped, whether communicating with a native or with each other.
In relative terms, however, the situation is much more as predicted. First of all, nonnatives
with a shared interlanguage enjoy the same intelligibility benefit as two natives, with positive
R-ISIB values of 6.8 and 7.0, respectively. Moreover, when speaker and listener have a non-
matched (mixed) interlanguage, the R-ISIB is negative (À2.4). There is a clear difference,
then, between the matched and the non-matched interlanguage pairs to the effect that no
benefit remains when speaker and listener have different native languages. The idea of a
native speaker handicap, however, is not supported by the aggregate data. It is not the
case that a nonnative listener is at a greater disadvantage when communicating with a
native speaker than when communicating with a nonnative with whom he does not share
the native language background. Not only are the R-ISIB results more in line with the
hypotheses formulated in the literature, they are also statistically more reliable, given that
the effect size (Z2) of the speaker­listener combination is roughly three times stronger in
relative (R-ISIB) than absolute (ISIB) scores (see Table 2).
Conclusion and Discussion
On the basis of the literature, we formulated two hypotheses with respect to the effect of the
specific composition of a speaker-listener pair involving different combinations of native and
nonnative interactants. The first hypothesis predicted (1a) that two nonnatives will
understand each other in English best when they have the same native-language
Wang and van Heuven 9
background (i.e., shared interlanguage) and (1b) will perform better than when they have
different native language backgrounds (mixed interlanguage). These subhypotheses proved
false when tested in absolute terms but were clearly supported by the data when evaluated in
relative (R-ISIB) terms. In fact, in relative terms, nonnative speaker-listener pairs enjoy the
same interlanguage benefit as native speaker-native listener pairs -- as long as speaker and
listener have the same mother tongue. One more subhypothesis, (1c), which was formulated
on the basis of earlier analyses of Wang's (2007) data, cannot be upheld in the meta-analysis:
it is not the case that communication between native and nonnative interactants is poorer
than between two nonnatives with different language backgrounds. On the strength of this
latter finding, hypothesis (1c) has to be rejected.
The above state of affairs suggests that the earlier tripartite division of interlocuters in
terms of (a) native speakers and listeners, (b) nonnative speaker-listener pairs with a shared
interlanguage, and (c) those with non-shared, that is, mixed, interlanguages is not supported
by our R-ISIB results. The meta-analysis boils down to a very simple and clear-cut binary
division in intelligibility between native and nonnative speakers of a language. When two
interactants share the same native language, they enjoy the advantage of a shared phonology.
In this sense native speakers communicating with native listeners also share a common
interlanguage, namely the ideal (near) perfect grammar/phonology of the native speaker/
listener. When two interactants do not have the same mother tongue, their mutual
intelligibility is poorer. Here, it does not matter whether both interactants are nonnative
or whether a foreigner communicates with a native -- the point is that they do not share
any interlanguage.
Also Hypothesis (2) predicted that the effects would be stronger when evaluated in relative
rather than in absolute scores. The analysis of variance indicated an effect size in R-ISIB that
was three times larger than when analyzed in absolute scores. Hypothesis (2) is therefore
confirmed: relative scores work better than absolute scores.
As we pointed out in the introduction, it has been observed that nonnative listeners of
English often have the intuition that they understand a fellow nonnative talker, that is,
one with whom they share a common mother tongue, better than a native speaker of
English. This intuition is supported by the experimental data, but only when the
intelligibility scores are expressed in relative terms, that is, in terms of the R-ISIB
measure that was explained in A Relative R-ISIB section. We conclude, therefore, that
the proper way of evaluating the concept of the ISIB, as formulated by Bent and Bradlow
(2003), is in relative rather than in absolute terms. We would suggest that future research
on communication between native and/or nonnative interactants should analyze the
results in terms of our R-ISIB measure, either as the only ISIB measure or at least as
a measure supplementary to comparing absolute ISIB values as has been the common
practice in the literature.
In summary, we now have at our disposal a way to quantify the ISIB in a way that works
and that matches intuitions that were formulated in the literature (which were not matched
when absolute intelligibility scores were examined earlier). Also, we now know that there is a
clear (and motivated) difference between communication that involves interactants who share
the same native language (whether speaking in their mother tongue or in a nonnative
language) and communication involving interactants who do not share the interlanguage.
This refutes the earlier hypothesis (entertained and not rejected by Bent & Bradlow, 2003)
that any nonnative speaker should be more intelligible to a nonnative listener than a native
speaker is. This insight is new. Together these two points constitute the contribution this
article adds to what was known about factors that determine speech intelligibility among
native and nonnative interlocutors.

Notes
1. On face value, these three numbers should average out at 40% instead of 39%. The discrepancy is
due to rounding errors.
2. On the basis of the values presented in Table 1, an expected value of 21% would be expected. The
slight discrepancy is due to greater rounding accuracy in the computations underlying the table.
3. The numbers presented in this table deviate slightly from what was published in Wang (2007) and
Van Heuven and Wang (2007). The present numbers are correct.
4. Smith and Rafiqzad (1979) have been criticized for other reasons as well. It has been pointed out that
the materials produced by the speaker groups differ substantially in terms of conceptual
comprehensibility -- so that no straightforward comparisons between speaker and listener groups
can be made. This criticism, of course, is no longer valid once we apply the concept of R-ISIB. When
the speaker of a language is more difficult to understand, for whatever reason, this will affect the
main effect of speaker but not the speaker by listener interaction, that is, not the R-ISIB.
