Brief Report
Incidence of Dog Bite Injuries
Treated in Emergency Departments
Harold B. Weiss, MS, MPH; Deborah I. Friedman; Jeffrey H. Coben, MD
Context.--Dog bites that result in injuries occur frequently, but how frequently
dog bite injuries necessitate medical attention at a hospital or hospital admission
is unknown.
Objective.--To describe the incidence and characteristics of dog bite injuries
treated in US emergency departments (EDs).
Design.--Emergency department survey from the National Center for Health
Statistics National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey for 1992 to 1994.
Patients.--National probability sample of patients visiting EDs.
Main Outcome Measure.-- Incidence of dog bites treated in EDs, defined as
a cause of injury recorded as the E-code E906.0.
Results.--The 3-year annualized, adjusted, and weighted estimate of new dog
bite­related injury visits to US EDs was 333 687, a rate of 12.9 per 10000 persons
(95% confidence interval [CI], 10.5-15.4). This represents approximately 914 new
dog bite injuries requiring ED visits per day. The median age of patients bitten was
15 years, with children, especially boys aged 5 to 9 years, having the highest in-
cidence rate (60.7 per 10 000 persons for boys aged 5 to 9 years). Children seen
in EDs were more likely than older persons to be bitten on the face, neck, and head
(73% vs 30%). We estimated that for each US dog bite fatality there are about 670
hospitalizations and 16 000 ED visits.
Conclusions.--DogbiteinjuriesareanimportantsourceofinjuryintheUSpopu-
lation,especiallyamongchildren.Improvedsurveillanceandpreventionofdogbite­
related injuries, particularly among children, are needed.

THECLOSEASSOCIATIONbetween
humans and domesticated dogs began at
least 12 000 years ago.1 Since then,
people have been intimately involved in
domesticating the wild dog into hunter,
guard,andcompanion.However,thedo-
mesticated dog retains many of its wild
instincts,includingbehaviorsthatalltoo
often lead to human attacks. This risk
hasalwaysbeenpresent.Onlynow,how-
ever, are we beginning to gain a full un-
derstanding of the impact of dog bites on
populations.2
Estimates of dog bite injuries have
been reported from data derived from
household surveys, hospital-based stud-
ies, school-based surveys, local animal
shelter monitoring, police reports, and
newspaper articles.2-8 Because of lack of
a national reporting system and varia-
tion of local reporting procedures, accu-
rate national incidence rates for dog
bite­related emergency department
(ED)visitsandhospitalizationshavenot
been well quantified. The reported inci-
dence of ED-treated dog bite injuries in
the United States ranges from 0.3% to
1.1% of all ED visits.3,9,10
With regard to overall morbidity, the
annual number of total bites that occur
in the US population has been estimated
torangefrom500 000to4.5million.11,12 It
hasbeenestimatedthatalmosthalfofall
children have been bitten by a dog at
some point in their lives.5 Among chil-
dren, more than 50% of documented
bites have been to the head, face, or
neck.4,13,14 Unfortunately, most of the
studiesthatprovidedthisdescriptivein-
formation were limited because of small
sample size and lack of consistent defi-
nitions, or they were not representative
of the general population.
Recent work by Sacks et al2 has im-
proved the precision of national esti-
matesfordogbite­relatedmortalityand
for dog bites receiving any medical at-
tention. For the 10-year period, 1979
through1988,anannualaverageofabout
15 fatal dog attacks was documented in
theUnitedStates,withextrapolatedes-
timates suggesting that as many as 20
per year may have actually occurred.11
Based on a random household survey,
theInjuryControlandRiskSurveycon-
ducted by the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention, it was estimated
that about 800 000 bites occur annually
that require medical attention.2 How-
ever, this estimate was not able to break
down the proportion of patients seen in
hospitals owing to the small size of the
sample. The only nationwide study from
any country that examined both major
morbidity and mortality from dog bite
injuries was conducted in New Zeal-
and.15 This study predicted an incidence
of hospitalization due to dog bites in the
year 2000 of 9.6 per 100 000 persons,
twice the incidence for 1979.15

The purpose of the present study is to
estimate the incidence and characteris-
tics of dog bite injuries treated in US
EDs using a 3-year population-based
stratified random sample of US ED vis-
its. This study also fills the gaps in our
understanding of the patterns of medi-
cal care for dog bite victims. With such
anunderstanding,thebroadmedicaland
public health impact of dog bite­related
injuries can be better appreciated and
targeted for preventive efforts.
Methods
Data Source.--Data were obtained
from the ED component of the 1992-
1994 National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS), a
population-basedstratifiedsampleofUS
ED visits. This survey, conducted annu-
ally since 1992, is directed by the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
NationalCenterforHealthStatistics.The
combined 1992-1994 data set repre-
sented estimates applying to approxi-
mately274millionEDvisits16-18 (about91
million visits per year). The NHAMCS
is a national probability sample of non-
institutional general and short-stay hos-
pitals (excludes federal, Veterans Af-
fairs, and military hospitals). It uses a 4-
stage probability sample that covers
geographic primary sampling units, hos-
pitalswithinprimarysamplingunits,EDs
withinhospitals,andpatientswithinEDs.
Data collection takes place during a ran-
domly assigned 4-week data period for
eachofthesampledhospitals.TheUSBu-
reau of the Census regional staff over-
seesthedatacollectionprocess,whileac-
tual data collection is the responsibility
of hospital staff. A separate data collec-
tion form is filled out at or close to the
time of visit for each sampled patient. A
fullreportofthemethodsusedinthissur-
vey is available from the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics (NCHS).16
After the forms are completed, they
are sent to NCHS where International
Classification of Disease, Ninth Revi-
sion,ClinicalModification(ICD-9-CM)
coding takes place by experienced no-
sologists. A maximum of 3 E-codes are
assigned to each case. The nosologists
work from the data collection form, not
the original medical record. For 1992-
1994, a total of 91 935 patient forms were
collected.
DefinitionandCaseSelection.--Adog
bite injury was defined as any ED visit
withanICD-9-CME-codeofE906.0("dog
bite") in the primary, secondary, or ter-
tiary E-code field. More than 99% of the
caseswereidentifiedfromtheprimaryE-
code field. To obtain incidence estimates
(ie,newcases)recordsfromthe1992data
setwereexcludediftheywerenotmarked
as"Injury,firstvisit"inthedatasettopre-
vent counting follow-up visits. This ex-
cluded 17.9% of the dog bite­related in-
juries from the 1992 data. The 1993 and
1994 data collection instruments did not
contain information on whether the visit
wasafirstvisitforinjuryorfollow-upvisit.
Therefore,thesampleweightsfromeach
of these latter 2 years were reduced by
17.9% based on the percentage of follow-
up visits found in 1992. All 3 years were
then combined and averaged to produce
mean annual national estimates. The

timateforthiscombineddatasetis30 000
visits (Catherine W. Burt, EdD, Ambu-
latoryCareStatisticsBranch,NCHS,oral
communication,August30,1996).Placeof
injury(home,work,school,street,etc)was
only collected in 1993 and 1994. An addi-
tion was made to the NHAMCS data set

jury severity mainly in terms of threat to
life.InthisstudytheInjurySeverityScore
was derived by automated translation of
the ICD-9-CM diagnoses using Tricode
software(Tri-AnalyticsInc,BelAir,Md).

ware (SPSS Inc, Chicago, Ill). Rates

Results
The annualized weighted estimate of
the incidence of new dog bite­related in-
juries seen in US EDs was 333 687 (95%
CI, 269 950-397 424) for a rate of 12.9
(95% CI, 10.5-15.4) per 10 000 persons.
These injuries comprised about 0.4% of
all ED visits during the study period.
(Numbers and rates for race, sex, age,
age and sex, geographic region, season,
and day of month are available from the
authors on request).
Ages of victims of dog bite­related in-
juries ranged from younger than 1 year
to 91 years (median age, 15 years). Inci-
dence rates were significantly higher
among children aged 0 to 9 years, espe-
cially among boys. The 5- to 9-year-old
maleagegrouphadthehighestrate,60.7
ED visits per 10 000 persons (95% CI,
34.8-86.6). The estimated 57 580 dog
bite­related visits for boys aged 5 to 9
years represent 3.6% of all injury-re-
latedEDvisitsinthisageandsexgroup.
Among the cases in which body part
area could be determined (about two
thirds of the cases), the face, neck, and
head (combined) were the leading body
partsitesaffected(29%),followedbythe
upper limbs and lower limbs. Among
children aged 0 to 9 years, 73% of the
injuries with attributed injury site were
totheface,head,andneck,whileallother
ageshadonly30%oftheinjuriesoccurto
the face, head, and neck. There was a
nonsignificant trend toward a seasonal
distribution of the incidence of dog bite
injuries,withthehighestratesbeingob-
served during the summer months. Al-
though the highest number of cases was
seeninthesouthernregionoftheUnited
States (Alabama, Arkansas, Delaware,
District of Columbia, Florida, Georgia,
Kentucky, Louisiana, Maryland, Missis-
sippi, North Carolina, Oklahoma, South
Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia,
and West Virginia), the population-ad-
justed rates were similar by geographic
region and not significantly different
from one another.
Over half the dog bite injuries (58.0%)
were reported to have occurred at a
home. Dog bite­related ED visits were
more likely to occur on the weekends.
Dog bite injuries were triaged in the ED
as urgent-emergent in 46.1% of the vis-
its and nonurgent for the remainder.
Ninety-six percent of patients making
dog bite­related ED visits were treated
and released from the ED; the remain-
der were admitted to the hospital or
transferred to another facility. Among
the 94% of the cases assigned a calcu-
lated ISS score, 99% were of low sever-
ity (Injury Severity Score, 1).
Comment
This study extends previous work in
dog bite epidemiology by adding more
precise quantitative information about
ED visits and incidence. It fills the re-
maining gap in our understanding of
where people go for medical treatment
of dog bites, thereby more clearly defin-
ing their burden on the medical care sys-
tem. Using the (rounded) NCHS survey
data reported here of 334 000 dog bite­
related ED visits with a 4% hospitaliza-
tion rate, Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention household survey esti-
mates of 757 000 medically treated and
3.73 million nonmedically treated dog
bites,2 and averaged mortality data re-
porting about 20 deaths per year,11,19 it
appears that, for each US dog bite fatal-
ity, there are about 670 hospitalizations,
16 000 ED visits, 21 000 other medical

visits (office and clinic), and 187 000 non-
medically treated bites. Consistent with
the results of other reports, males were
more likely than females to be bitten by
dogs,childrenhadthehighestrateofED

children were more likely than adults to

The Table presents some interesting
comparisons between the incidence of
the dog bite­related ED visits and ED
visits for selected injury types reported
by the US Consumer Product Safety
Commission (CPSC).20 The CPSC does
not currently collect or report dog bite­
related injuries.
We also applied a limited but useful
payment model to the data. This model
was based on averaging a non­NCHS/
NHAMCS sample of actual ED visit re-
imbursements for each of several broad
body part­based diagnosis code group-
ings (details available from authors on
request). This conservative model ex-
cluded indirect costs (such as pain and
suffering or lost work, either by parents
or the victim), charges for ED follow-up
visits and inpatient visits, and non­ED-
related charges. Also, given the risk of
infection,22 the ragged nature of many
bite-related lacerations, and the large
number of dog bites treated by at least
an initial course of rabies prophylaxis,
the average payment for a dog bite­re-
lated injury might be much higher than
thediagnosticgroupaverageusedinthe
model. Nevertheless, using this model
weestimatetheaveragedogbiteresults
in a payment to the hospital of $274 and
a national annual total payment for ED
services for new dog bite­related inju-
ries of $102.4 million. Children and ado-
lescents younger than 20 years ac-
counted for over half these payments
($58.7 million), and Medicaid, Medicare,
and other government sources were
mentioned as payers in 26% of the visits.
Regarding study limitations, some
undercounting was possible since the
NHAMCS data set had no cause of in-
jury text-string field available to search
for dog bite­related visits that were not
E-coded. Therefore, some bites may not
have been identified on account of miss-
ing or incorrect coding. However, a
single, unambiguous E-code for dog
bites limits the false positives likely in
the ICD-9-CM coding scheme used in
this data set.
The NHAMCS provides the ongoing
ability to quantify nationally the magni-
tude of the incidence of hospital-treated
dog bite injuries. This data set is a rep-
resentative sample of the US popula-
tion from which trends can eventually be
followed for the nation as a whole and to
set realistic goals for local programs.
However, sample size issues result in
large 95% CIs for many subgroup distri-
butions, limiting the data set's useful-
ness. Most animal control programs are
administeredlocallyandrequirelocaland
morespecificdata,suchasbreedtypeand
more specificity about the incident, for
which the NHAMCS national ED sur-
vey is not suited.
AnalysisoftheNHAMCSdatasethas
shown that each year US EDs treat
about334 000newcasesofdogbiteswith
associated ED treatment payments of
over $100 million. With more than one
third of American households owning a
dog, the number of dogs in the United
States is over 50 million.23 Clearly, the
popularity of the dog as both friend and
protector will not soon disappear. Con-
sidering the risk to large parts of the
population, especially to children, it is
necessary that effective preventive
strategies be developed and applied to
reduce the painful and costly burden of
dog bites. We know little about which
strategies work or do not work, how-
ever.11 More knowledge is needed
through a combination of enhanced and
coordinated dog bite reporting systems,
expanded population-based surveys,
and implementation and evaluation of
preventive trials. Particularly for the
moresevereepisodes,informationneeds
to be obtained regarding high-risk
situations, high-risk dogs, and what
leads to successful preventive interven-
tions.
