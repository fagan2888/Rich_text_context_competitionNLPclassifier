on the Voluntary Activities of Midlife
and Older Women

One factor thought to contribute to higher levels of stress among caregivers is the restriction on personal time.and
leisure activities that theyfeel. We use datafrom the National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to exam-
ine the influences that caregiving, the relationship of the care-recipient with the caregiver, and the intensity of the
caregiving have on women's participation in personal, family-centered, and community activities. We find that care-
giving, regardless of age, does not, reduce the frequency of participation in voluntary activities. In fact, among
younger women, some types of caregiving are associated with significantly higher levels of participation. Based on
our results, we conclude that caregiving does not necessarily result in a "loss of self." Caregivers may be using out-
side activities as a way to relieve the stress of the caregiving tasks; caregivers may be particularly adept at balancing
roles, or most caregiving may not be at a level of intensity sufficient to interfere with other activities.
DIFFICULTIES relating to the "caregiver" role of
women continue to be emphasized in current research
and media. Are women trapped by attending to the needs of
one or more generations of care-recipients as their parents,
grandparents, spouses, and other kin become infirm? Are
caregiving women simultaneously pulled by the obligations
of multiple roles as a parent, spouse, and employee? And if
so, is this at the expense and restriction of their voluntary
or leisure activities? This research addresses whether the
increased competition for midlife and older women's time
by their family, caregiving, and employment roles dimin-
ishes their participation in other activities.
Current and future demographic transformations have
the potential to change the familial responsibilities of
women. The growing numbers of elderly people and their
increased life expectancy may cause subsequent genera-
tions to delegate greater portions of their time to caregiv-
ing. Recent work by Himes (1994) demonstrated that with
constant mortality or slight improvements in the survival of
the old, a daughter's lifetime chances of providing parental
care range from 55 percent to 75 percent. Expansion of the
caregiving role to include physically ill or disabled spous-
es, children, and others increases these lifetime chances
substantially. Women's increased participation in the paid
labor force has contributed a new dimension to family
issues. Employment in the paid labor market also has the
potential to influence the cqrrirnunity, personal, or volun-
teer activities of women. Albeit women -- regardless of
age -- are impacted by these transitions, it is midlife and
older women who may be required to make the greatest
adjustments as they continue to assume the roles of "care-
giver" and "mother" while being employed (Hagemann-
White, 1984) and requested to assist with community needs
and organizations.
The purpose of this study is to examine the extent to
which women's concurrent roles as caregiver, labor force
participant, and family member restrict their involvement in
voluntary activities. This research uses data from the
National Survey of Families and Households (NSFH) to
examine the influence of caregiving and market work on the
likelihood of participating in personal, family-centered, and
community activities. Secondly, this research explores pos-
sible differentials in the limitation of caregivers' activities
by the relationship of the care-recipient with the caregiver
and by the intensity of the caregiving relationship. Finally,
acknowledging that midlife and older women have different
market work experiences and familial relationships, this
study provides a contrast of the impact of caregiving on the
participation levels of midlife and older women.
Background Issues
Women continue to strongly associate with the caregiv-
ing role -- nearly three-quarters of the caregivers for elders
are women (Stone, Cafferata, and Sangl, 1987). Women are
also the primary caregivers for nonelderly disabled or ill
children, spouses, and other family members (Lee, 1992).
The range of activities considered as "caregiving" varies
widely from study to study, including visiting, managing
household tasks, providing transportation, and the direct
provision of personal care. It is likely that many of the con-
flicting or ambiguous research results in the caregiving lit-
erature are, at least in part, the result of differences in the
definition of care (Stone, 1991). In addition to variations in
the types of activities provided, caregiving can vary dra-
matically in duration and intensity (Himes, Jordan, and
Farkas, 1996). These differences may be just as important
in determining the effects of caregiving as the types of
activities included.

CAREGIVING'S INFLUENCE ON ACTIVITIES S181
Several empirical studies have contributed to our under-
standing of the influence of caregiving on the personal lives
of women. These studies have often addressed the related
issues of the sources of stress experienced by caregivers
and the effect of the caregiving role on the caregiver's life
satisfaction. Stress among caregivers is thought to be the
product of a variety of processes, some the result of the
type of physical and psychological problems presented by
the care-recipient (Kinney and Stephens, 1989; Schulz,
Tompkins, and Rau, 1988; Zarit, Reever, and Bach-Peter-
son, 1980), others the result of the competing demands on
the time of the caregiver (George and Gwyther, 1986;
Miller and Montgomery, 1990; Stoller and Pugliesi, 1989).
One source of stress is the "loss of self described by Skaff
and Pearlin (1992). They theorize that the responsibilities
of the multiple roles occupied by caregivers result in a
reduction of roles, leading to a loss of the sense of self-
identity. In various forms, this hypothesis has been tested
by researchers examining the roles of employee and spouse
in combination with caregiving.
The fear that the increased participation of women in the
labor force will diminish caregiving has resulted in several
studies addressing the influence of paid employment on
caregiving. In general, two questions are raised in these
studies: (1) Are caregiving and employment compatible?,
that is, does employment prevent or limit caregiving activi-
ties or, conversely, does caregiving limit employment? and
(2) Does employment, in addition to caregiving, result in
increased levels of stress among caregivers? The answers to
both questions are, so far, ambiguous. Studies examining
the relationship between employment and caregiving have
generally found high levels of employment among care-
givers. Using data from the National Long Term Care Sur-
vey, Stone and Short (1990) find that caregivers may modi-
fy their work schedules, but the decision to work is related
to factors other than care responsibilities. Other studies find
higher rates of absenteeism, tardiness, and reduced produc-
tivity among workers who are also caregivers (Gibeau and
Anastas, 1989; Neal et al., 1990; Scharlach and Boyd,
1989). Stueve and O'Donnell (1989) conclude that em-
ployed daughters provide less care to impaired elderly than
nonemployed daughters, but employed caregivers report
greater role strain. Based on their examination of two
cohorts of women, however, Moen and her colleagues
(Moen, Robison, and Fields, 1994; Robison, Moen, and
Dempster-McClain, 1995) find no evidence that increased
female labor force participation has decreased caregiving
responsibilities overall. In fact, they find that women in the
younger cohort studied were more likely to be caregivers,
despite their greater labor force participation.
In a series of studies, Scharlach and colleagues have
examined workers in several different settings who are car-
ing for relatives. Scharlach and Boyd (1989) document the
increased levels of job disruption among working care-
givers. Scharlach and Fredriksen (1994) conclude that care-
givers to disabled care-recipients between the ages of 18
and 64 have greater role strain than caregivers providing
care to those 65 and older. They also find that employer-
sponsored programs are designed to alleviate elder care dif-
ficulties, yet often neglect to recognize the needs of care-
givers to the nonelderly. In a different study population,
Scharlach (1994) finds that employment may complement,
rather than compete with, the caregiving role. Many work-
ing caregivers find satisfaction in their ability to successful-
ly combine the two roles and find that employment pro-
vides a respite from care responsibilities.
The role of wife might serve as an additional source of
stress for caregivers. The positive and negative benefits of
this role, in addition to the parental caregiving role, were
the focus of recent research by Stephens and Franks (1995).
Their examination of the roles of spouse and caregiver for a
sample of couples in which the woman was providing
parental care reveals that caregiving generally creates nega-
tive spillover into the spousal role for women. However,
the wife role provides some buffering for the negative
effects of caregiving. Further research indicated that a hus-
band's support of a wife's caregiving activities may
increase marital satisfaction, although that support may not
serve as a buffer to the stresses of caregiving (Franks and
Stephens, 1996). In related work, Kleban et al. (1989) did
not find that wives' parent-care responsibilities negatively
affected husbands' marital satisfaction. Work by Lang and
Brody (1983) highlights the dilemma faced by midlife
women with competing roles. Looking at the additional
roles encountered by women meeting the needs of aging
parents, they found that parental caregiving was dependent
on the woman's work and marital status, as well as the resi-
dential status of the elderly parent. However, they con-
cluded that competing roles of midlife women did not sig-
nificantly reduce their caregiving activities.
Spitze and Logan (1990) also raise critical issues regard-
ing the validity of the characterization of midlife women
assisting aging parents as divided by competing family and
employment demands. They questioned the appraisal of the
potential problems experienced by caregivers implied by
other research by asking, "How typical was the caregiving
experience for middle-aged women?" They conclude that it
is the atypical individual who simultaneously experiences
the pulls of work, aging parents, in-laws, and dependent
children. More recent work by Rosenthal and colleagues
(Rosenthal, Martin-Matthews, and Matthews, 1996) finds
that among Canadian men and women, the simultaneous
occupation of the roles of caregiver, parent, and employee
is not typical. In an accompanying editorial, Soldo (1996)
emphasizes, however, that an understanding of the burden
on middle-aged adults requires the consideration of the full
range of the type of transfers (including time, money, and
care) in families, and the broader family structure in which
they take place.
The roles of employee, spouse, and mother are more sta-
ble than other roles that a caregiver might occupy. As com-
petition for time and energy increases, the area in which
role reduction is most often thought to take place is in the
leisure and supplemental activities of caregivers -- social
organization, church, and recreational activities, and infor-
mal visiting with family and friends. While a reduction in
the time available for these activities is often reported to be
a source of stress among caregivers (Cantor, 1983; George
and Gwyther, 1986; Miller and Montgomery, 1990), little
work has been done to quantify the extent to which care-
S182 FARKAS AND HIMES
givers participate in these types of activities, differences in
the types of activities affected, or the relationship between
the duration and intensity of the care responsibilities and
activity limitation.
In their examination of indicators of caregiver well-
being, George and Gwyther (1986) find that elderly care-
givers are less likely to participate in social activities than
other community members their age. Their work, however,
was based on a selected population of both caregivers and
noncaregivers. Miller and Montgomery (1990) used data
from the nationally representative 1982 National Long
Term Care Survey to measure limitations in social activities
among caregivers. They find that caregivers who subjec-
tively assess their caregiving demands as high are more
likely to report perceived limitations in social activities,
even when objective measures of care demands are similar.
However, they were limited by the survey's design, which
does not allow for an objective measure of social activities
nor for a comparison between caregivers and noncare-
givers. Hoyert and Seltzer (1992) were able to overcome
most of these difficulties through an examination of data
from the National Survey of Families and Households.
They find that caregivers report higher levels of participa-
tion in social activities when compared to noncaregivers.
Unfortunately, they do not distinguish the effects by age
nor by the type of activity. Caregiving has a definite age
pattern, with those caring for spouses on average older than
those caring for parents, and those caring for parents on
average older than those caring for adult children. Since
social activities are also likely to have distinct age patterns,
based on the work experience, household composition, and
educational level of the caregiver, age becomes an impor-
tant factor in the quantity and type of social activity
engagement. In addition, Hoyert and Seltzer did not exam-
ine the joint effects of caregiving and employment on the
social activities of caregiving women.
On balance, an evaluation of the literature suggests that
caregiving may restrict participation in personal, family,
and community activities, especially among employed
women. In addition, the experience of women caring for an
elderly parent may differ from that of women caring for
children or other relatives. The goal of our research is to
examine the extent to which participation in voluntary
activities is restricted by caregiving tasks. We expect to find
differences in participation based on the relationship
between the caregiver and the care recipient, the employ-
ment status of the caregiver, the duration and intensity of
the caregiving, and the cohort membership of the caregiver.
METHODS
The first wave of the 1988 National Survey of Families
and Households (NSFH, 1990) was selected for this study.
Respondents in the survey were drawn from a nationally
representative sample utilizing a multi-stage area probabili-
ty sample design. The survey, conducted in 1987 and early
1988, was administered to 13,017 respondents aged 19 and
over. The primary sampling unit for this survey was the
individual, rather than the family or household. The data
were collected verbally using a personal interview with an
additional self-administered questionnaire portion. The sur-
vey gathered retrospective household, family, and individu-
al characteristics of the primary respondent and included
several sections on the respondent's provision of assistance
activities to seriously ill or disabled coresidential and non-
coresidential kin members, friends, and nonrelatives.
From the NSFH survey's main sample of respondents
who provided information on their voluntary activities,
3,808 respondents were identified as women born between
the years 1913 and 1952 -- aged 35 to 74. The women
were grouped into two 20-year age intervals, ages 35 to 54
and 55 to 74, to capture and contrast the diversity in roles
across the life course. Sixty percent of the respondents
(2,374) were in the middle-age interval and 40 percent
(1,434) were in the older age interval.
Cohort analysis has a long history in sociology and
gerontology, influenced to a great extent by the work of
Ryder (1960) and Riley (1978, 1988; Riley, Kahn, and
Forner, 1994). Part of our interest is an examination of the
effects of cohort membership on activity participation. The
analysis of cohorts, rather than a strict analysis by age,
allows us to compare groups of women with similar sets of
experiences. We expect, for example, that the influence of
employment may be different for older women, many of
whom did not have lifetime careers, than for younger
women who are more likely to have been in the workforce
continuously. Analysis by cohorts allows us to control not
only the different experiences of individuals, but also, to
some extent, the context in which those experiences take
place.
Dependent variables. -- The variables of interest are
participation in voluntary activities unrelated to work and
beyond the normative roles of parent, grandparent, and
wife. Role involvement in voluntary activities is defined as
active participation or volunteering in organizations or
activities outside the household. The NSFH included ques-
tions regarding participation in a variety of these activities.
In total, the frequency of participation was measured for
nine specific types of activities and four types of social vis-
its. In addition, one question tapped the frequency of social
activities with groups of friends. A factor analysis revealed
that these activities and organizations could be clustered in
three areas: family-centered activities, formally structured
group activities, and casual activities and visiting (Table 1).
The first composite measure includes a variety of family-
centered activities -- church-affiliated groups, youth
groups, school-related groups, and sports groups. These
activities are likely to involve several members of a family,
especially children. Although they may be considered struc-
tured activities, the emphasis is not primarily on individual
enrichment. The second composite measure, formal groups,
includes participation in service clubs, hobby or garden
groups, professional or academic societies, and literature or
art groups. These groups have in common an emphasis on
regular meetings and activities, a focus on personal growth
or enrichment, and a generally more structured format. The
third composite measure incorporates less structured activi-
ties such as visiting with relatives, neighbors, colleagues
from work, or friends from outside the neighborhood,
attending social events at church or synagogue, and partici-

pation in group recreational activities such as bowling or
golf. These activities are more informal than those included
in the other two measures and the emphasis is on socializ-
ing. They are less likely to be regularly scheduled, and par-
ticipation is more flexible.
For each activity, respondents were asked to report the
frequency of their participation as: never, a few times a
year, about once a month, about once a week, or several
times a week. Several different methods of scoring partici-
pation were considered, including a variety of weighting
schemes for the frequency of participation, weighting com-
bined frequencies of participation, and a simple dichoto-
mous measure of participation. Our final models are based
on a scheme which translates the reported frequency levels
into monthly approximations. The participation scale is cre-
ated from the reported frequency of participation in each
individual activity. Those women reporting no participation
in an individual activity are given scores of 0 for that activ-
ity, while women who reported participating a few times in
the past year, but less than monthly, are given scores of 0.5.
Monthly participation is scored as a 1; weekly participation
is scored as a 4; and greater than weekly participation is
given a score of 12. The scores for individual activities are
then summed across activities within a group to obtain a
group activity score. For family and formal activity, these
composite scores range from 0 to 48, and for casual activi-
ties and visiting the scores range from 0 to 72.
Explanatory variables. -- The provision of care to seri-
ously ill or disabled coresidential and non-coresidential fam-
ily and friends over the past 12 months and the woman's
current employment status are the explanatory variables of
interest in our models. We use three concepts to capture the
multidimensionality of the caregiving process.
The first caregiving concept is a global caregiving mea-
sure designed to evaluate the influence of providing non-
paid physical care to any individual regardless of the care-
giver's relationship to the care recipient or the intensity of
the caregiving experience. A dichotomous measure of care-
giving was derived based on the answers to a series of
questions in the NSFH regarding the provision of care to
any person in or out of the household in the past year due to
his or her serious illness or disability. This definition should
exclude the ordinary care of children in the household, care
provided during short acute illnesses, or incidental assis-
tance provided to friends or family. It might include the
routine care of a chronically ill child, the provision of
household assistance to a parent or other person (if that
assistance is needed because of a disability), or the provi-
sion of physical care during a serious illness. For this study,
women who had provided care to any ill or disabled kin
member, friend, or non-relative over the past 12 months are
defined as caregivers.
The intent of the second caregiving concept is to examine
if the relationship of the caregiver to the care-recipient influ-
ences the caregiver's participation in voluntary activities.
Four dichotomous variables were created to identify the
care-recipient's relationship to the caregiver. Women who
provided physical care to an ill or disabled parent, parent in-
law, or step-parent over the past 12 months are considered to
be parental caregivers, while women who provided care to
an ill or disabled spouse during the past year are considered
to be spousal caregivers. Similarly, women who provided
physical care to an ill or disabled biological child or
stepchild are considered child caregivers. Finally, women
who provided physical care to an ill or disabled sibling,
step-sibling, grandchild, grandparent, other kin member, or
non-kin person are considered to be "other" caregivers.
The third set of caregiving variables measures the dura-
tion and intensity of the caregiving experience. The NSFH
includes several questions that (a) identify whether the
care-recipient resided with the caregiver, and (b) for non-
coresidential care-recipients, the number of weeks and
hours per week the caregiver provided physical care over
the past 12 months. We use these questions to create five
dichotomous variables assessing the influence of the dura-
tion and intensity of the caregiving experience. If the care-
recipients lived in the same household as the caregiver, the
women are considered coresident caregivers. Four mea-
sures combining the number of weeks and hours spent care-
giving by non-coresidential caregivers were created to cap-
ture the variation in out-of-home care activities. The
measures of duration and intensity are highly skewed, with
most caregivers reporting shorter durations and lower
intensities. Our goal was to create categories which are eas-
ily interpreted and replicated. In order to preserve compara-
bility, previously defined categories of care duration and
intensity groups were used (Himes, Jordan, and Farkas,
1996). Duration was divided at 26 weeks and intensity at 2
hours a day. The four groups are defined as:
SHORT/LOW caregivers provided care during 26 or
fewer weeks in the past year and for fewer than 14 hours
per week.
S184 FARKAS AND HIMES
SHORT/HIGH caregivers provided care during 26 or
fewer weeks in the past year and for 14 or more hours
per week.
LONG/LOW caregivers provided care during more than
26 weeks in the past year and for fewer than 14 hours per
week.
LONG/HIGH caregivers provided care during more than
26 weeks in the past year and for 14 or more hours per
week.
A small fraction of the women provided care to two or
more persons in the past 12 months (20% of midlife women
and 19% of older women). For women providing care to
two or more non-coresidential persons, the survey asked for
duration (weeks) and intensity (hours) only for the person
that the caregiver spent the greatest amount of time assist-
ing, and we use that care-recipient to define our caregiving
measures. A small portion of caregivers provided care to
both a coresidential and non-coresidential person. In these
cases, we assume that the coresidential care-recipient pre-
sents the greatest constraint on the women's time and use
that relationship to define the caregiving measures. For
each of the three multidimensional concept measures of
caregiving -- global caregiving, relationship to care-recipi-
ent, and the duration and intensity of caregiving -- the
comparison category is women who provided no care to an
ill or disabled person in the past 12 months.
A simple measure of work status, employed or not, is
included to capture the women's working role. Additional
roles common to women and women's characteristics are
included in the analysis as background control measures.
Women's additional role variables include presence of chil-
dren in the household, being a grandparent, and the
women's marital status. Respondent's health has been
shown to impact kin assistance and activities; therefore,
self-reported health was included as a background control
measure. Background measures also control for the
women's educational attainment, ethnicity, and income.
Analysis. -- Descriptive statistics are used initially to
examine whether differences are found by caregiving and
employment on the levels of participation in the three activ-
ity groups for each age interval of women. Multivariate
models are then used to estimate the influence of caregiving
and employment on the likelihood of participation in volun-
tary activities. For each cohort, a series of models are esti-
mated to explore the effects of each unique caregiving con-
cept (global care, relationship to the care-recipient, and the
duration/intensity measures) on each outcome variable.
This results in nine separate models for each cohort of
women. Because activity participation levels are defined as
ratio scales, ordinary least squares models are appropriate
for estimation.
RESULTS
Table 2 provides descriptive information on the level of
participation in the three activity groups, employment sta-
tus, and demographic characteristics for caregivers and
noncaregivers. Caregiving is slightly more common among
the younger cohort of women; 24.6 percent (468/2,374) of
women in the midlife group are caregivers compared to
23.3 percent (271/1,434) of the older cohort. Participation
in family-centered activities is higher among the younger

women. This high level of participation is most likely a
reflection of the greater likelihood of these women having a
child at home. The difference in participation is smaller for
formal activities, where caregiving midlife women have the
highest mean level of participation and noncaregiving older
women the lowest. The most common type of activity for
all groups is visiting and casual social activities. Again, the
younger cohort of women has higher levels of participation
than the older women. Although the differences between
groups may be substantively different, none of the differ-
ences is statistically significant at the .05 level.
The descriptive measures support the distinction of
women at different stages of the life course. Younger
women are more likely than the older cohort to be
employed, married, and to have children at home. Midlife
women who are not caregivers have the highest levels of
employment, 72 percent, and older women who are not
caregivers the lowest level, 28 percent. In additional analy-
sis, among employed midlife women who had provided
care in the past 12 months, 94 percent reported working 20
or more hours per week. Essentially all employed older
caregiving women worked 20 or more hours per week (data
not shown).
The mean age of the midlife women cohort is about 43
years while women in the older cohort were 64 years old on
average. There is little difference in health status among the
women, either by age or caregiving status. Midlife women
have higher incomes than older women by $6,000 to
$8,000. Midlife caregiving women are most likely to be
married, and noncaregiving older women the least likely.
Caregivers of all ages are slightly less likely to be Black
than noncaregivers. Few older women had a child residing
in the household (about 17 percent overall), but over 70
percent of midlife women reported that a child remained in
the household. Just over 25 percent of all midlife women
but nearly 70 percent of the older women were grandmoth-
ers. Older women had fewer years of completed schooling
than midlife women; 62 percent of older women had com-
pleted 12 or more years of school versus 81 percent of
midlife women.
Although the proportion of women in each cohort pro-
viding care is similar, the recipients of that care differ

(Table 3). For both groups of women, parents were the
most common care-recipient; 53 percent of midlife women
and 36 percent of older women were caring for a parent.
However, older women are much more likely to be provid-
ing care to a spouse or other person than midlife women.
More older women coreside with the care recipient (45% vs
33% for midlife women). However, the distribution of the
remaining caregivers among duration and intensity groups
varies little by age.
Figure 1 shows the participation of midlife and older
women in the three activity groups when considering both
caregiving and employment status. Among the younger
cohort, working women who are also caregivers have, with
one slight exception, the highest levels of participation in
all activities. This difference is significant at the .10 level
for all three activity types when working caregivers are
compared to nonworking, noncaregivers. So, among care-
givers, working and caregiving together are associated with
higher, rather than lower, levels of participation. For casual
activities, women who are caregivers, whether they work or
not, have significantly higher levels of activity participation
than their noncaregiving counterparts. Among the older
cohort of women, working women who are not caregivers
have significantly higher levels of participation in both
family and formal activities than women who are neither
working nor caregiving. Levels of participation in casual
activities do not vary significantly among the groups of
older women. These results indicate that caregiving and

+p<A0;*p<.05.
work may operate differently for the two groups; work tends
to lead to higher levels of participation for both groups, but
for the older cohort the combination of caregiving and
work is associated with some reduction in participation.
Among the younger cohort, the combination of work and
caregiving leads to the highest levels of participation.
Multivariate results. -- Table 4 provides a summary of
the multivariate results for the caregiving measures on the
level of participation in family-centered, formal, and casual
activities net of women's normative parent, grandparent,
and marital roles, and net of education, income, health, and
race (complete models are available upon request).
The first set of models examines the effect of the global
measure of caregiving and work status on participation in
each activity (shown in the first panel of Table 4). Neither
caregiving nor work has a consistent effect on women's
participation in voluntary activities. Contrary to expecta-
tions, caregiving does not seem to significantly reduce par-
ticipation levels. In one case, participation in casual activi-
ties for younger women, caregiving has a statistically
significant positive effect -- caregivers have higher levels
of visiting and casual activity. Work tends to have a nega-
tive effect on activity participation, although the results are
not statistically significant. However, the interaction of
caregiving and work tends to have a negative effect on
activity participation, particularly for the older cohort of
women. For the older women, the combination of work and
caregiving leads to lower levels of participation in both
family and formal activities. The importance of this interac-
tion highlights the additional burdens that older women
who have multiple roles may be facing.
The control factors in all models show the expected rela-
tionships to activity participation. Higher levels of educa-
tion increase participation for all types of activities for both
cohorts. Being married reduces visiting levels for both
cohorts, but for younger women marriage increases partici-
pation in family-centered activities. Marital status has no
significant effect on participation in formal activities for
either group of women. Being a grandparent is not statisti-
cally related to any activity. Having a child at home
increases participation in family-centered activities for the
young cohort, but reduces participation in both formal and
casual activities for the older cohort of women. Better
health leads to greater participation in all models, but
income is not statistically associated with any activity.
Black women in both cohorts have higher levels of partici-
pation in family activities. Older Black women are less
likely to participate in formal activities, and younger Black
women are more likely to participate in casual social activi-
ties than White women.
The second set of caregiving models in Table 4 provides
information on the effect of the relationship of the care-
recipient to the caregiver on the caregiver's participation in
voluntary activities. Midlife women caring for a parent par-
ticipate in more activities outside the household than non-
caregiving women (net of background factors). Among the
older cohort, parent care is associated with higher levels of
participation in family and formal activities. Other types of
caregiving do not result in a consistent reduction in activity
participation, with no effects reaching statistical signifi-
cance. Again, work is generally associated with lower lev-
els of participation.
Several factors may be operating that provide parental
CAREGIVING'S INFLUENCE ON ACTIVITIES S187
caregivers the occasion to participate in social activities.
On average, parental caregivers have larger familial net-
works to share the caregiving task (Miller and Mont-
gomery, 1990), and a portion of the higher casual visiting
observed for younger parental caregivers may, in part,
reflect the interactions of the kin network in caring for the
infirm parent. Women providing care to other kin or non-
kin may also share the caregiving responsibilities with oth-
ers, resulting in a less strenuous caregiving schedule. In
addition, their obligations, perceived or real, may be dimin-
ished to less closely related kin or non-kin care-recipients.
Nevertheless, caregiving women do not significantly dimin-
ish their social activities as a consequence of their caregiv-
ing obligations, and in some instances are likely to have
higher levels of participation in voluntary activities than
noncaregiving women.
The third set of caregiving models in Table 4 evaluates
the effect of the duration and intensity of the caregiving
episode on the midlife women's participation in voluntary
activities. The strongest effects are seen for caregiving of
short duration and high intensity. For all women, this type
of care seems to have a positive effect on activity participa-
tion (net of background factors). Unexpectedly, women
with a coresident care-recipient do not significantly reduce
their voluntary activities compared to noncaregiving
women, although the direction of the effect is generally
negative, especially among the older cohort. As in the pre-
vious analyses, employment exerts a negative effect on par-
ticipation, net of caregiving. The presence of a positive
effect of caregiving on activity participation in the short-
duration, high-intensity group may be the result of several
factors. The care may have been so short in duration as to
not interfere significantly with regular activities. Also, we
do not have information on the timing of the caregiving
with respect to the activities, so the two may both have
occurred in the past year, but at different times.
DISCUSSION
Competition for women's limited time when providing
physical care to an ill or disabled individual, combined with
the roles of labor force participant and family member, has
the potential to reduce women's participation in voluntary
activities outside the household. Using the NSFH data, our
study evaluated the extent to which midlife and older
women caregivers reduce their participation in voluntary
activities. From the results of this study, we conclude that
women do not reduce their outside activities in response to
additional caregiving requirements and, in some cases,
caregiving is associated with higher levels of participation.
Among midlife women, caregivers were no less likely
than noncaregivers to participate in all three types of activi-
ties. In the case of casual social activities, caregiving sig-
nificantly increased participation among midlife women.
For older women caregiving was not significantly related to
participation in any of the three activity types. Employment
generally was associated negatively with increased caregiv-
ing. However, the combination of caregiving and work sig-
nificantly reduced participation in family and formal activi-
ties for older women.
The effect of the caregiver-care recipient relationship
was most significant when the care recipient was a parent.
For all activities, parental care was associated with greater
levels of participation among midlife women. It is possible
that midlife women caring for a parent have a large net-
work of caregiving "helpers" that rally behind them and
allow them the opportunity to participate in voluntary activ-
ities. For the older cohort, there was no consistent relation-
ship of care-recipient to activity participation.
Our analysis does not examine the role of men in provid-
ing care or supporting caregiving women. It is possible that
those caregivers who are able to remain active do so by
sharing their care responsibilities with their male partners.
In addition, we might expect that men, who traditionally
have lower levels of participation in social activities and
less involvement in care activities, may not be as affected
by caregiving as women. It is not unlikely that the grouping
of activities for men would be different from that observed
for women. Further study should address the kin networks
of all caregivers across the life course and incorporate all
categories of care-recipients.
The duration and intensity of care responsibilities also
affected activity participation. The group which stands out
are those women in the younger cohort who are providing
short, intensive periods of care. The generally higher levels
of activity participation among these women may indicate a
group of women who are unusually competent and orga-
nized. They may find that they are called upon as caregivers
because of their ability to relate to others, to be involved in
various activities, and to manage their time. It may also be
true that these periods of care, although intense while they
last, do not affect the participation levels of women over
the course of a year. Women may find it easier to suspend
participation in activities for a short period of time while
providing care, and then resume those activities when the
episode of caregiving has ended.
In all cases, the lack of differences observed among older
women caregivers and noncaregivers may reflect the gener-
ally lower levels of participation by older women in most
of the activities measured due to the absence of children in
the household, the woman's own health status, and the
activity reduction associated with retirement. The differ-
ences may also result from differences in the life experi-
ences of the two cohorts of women. Other research (Robi-
son, Moen, and Dempster-McClain, 1995) finds that
caregiving experiences have increased for younger cohorts.
Although the age ranges they examine both fall within our
"older" women's group, we might expect that the chances
of a woman being called on to provide care may increase
for even younger cohorts because of the increasing life
expectancy of the elderly. It is also likely that the types of
conditions requiring care have and will change over time as
persons survive longer with debilitating chronic illnesses
such as Alzheimer's disease.
While the richness of the NSFH data allows us to exam-
ine the effects of several factors influencing caregiving and
activity participation, there are limitations to the data as
well. Significantly, we do not know the timing of the care-
giving episodes. Caregiving may have been spread over sev-
eral short periods during the past year, or be concentrated
in one. Intermittent caregiving is likely to have less of an
S188 FARKASAND HIMES
effect on activity participation. In addition, we have limited
information on the extent of the caregivers' involvement in
care activities. Self-reports of care activities may result in a
variety of experiences being included, ranging from intense
personal care to household assistance. Finally, we are limited
in our ability to determine whether the caregiver has primary
responsibility for the care activities, or is part of a wider net-
work of care providers. However, the persistent lack of
effect, or even positive influence of caregiving on activity
participation, lends strength to our general conclusions.
The higher levels of social participation among care-
givers, which confirm those found by Hoyert and Seltzer
(1992), cast some doubt on the notion that caregivers suffer
a "loss of self in the caregiving role. Even when those care-
givers who provide the most intensive care are examined,
supplemental activity participation is not reduced. It is pos-
sible that much like the effect proposed for employees, care-
givers use their outside activities as a source of relief from
the caregiving burdens. Another explanation may lie in the
varieties of caregiving experiences among women. Most
parental caregiving is of limited duration and tends to be
episodic, rather than continual (Moen, Robison, and Fields,
1994). These caregivers may find that their participation in
outside activities is limited only for short periods of time.
Caregivers of chronically ill or disabled adult children, on
the other hand, may have developed alternative sources of
care or coping strategies which allow them free time.
While these explanations might explain why caregivers
would have similar levels of participation in outside activi-
ties, they do not explain as easily the higher levels observed
for some groups in this study. An explanation might be
found in the personality characteristics of caregivers and
noncaregivers. For example, are those who are more likely
to be involved in a numerous assortment of activities more
apt to have additional resources and skills which enable
them to provide care? A profile of caregivers as being com-
petent, involved, and capable is beginning to emerge from
the literature. While no researcher denies the added stress
which occurs when the caregiving role is added to the lives
of women, caregiving women, especially those who are
employed, appear to be coping remarkably well. Additional
research on the ways in which women are selected into, and
out of, the role of caregiver, the ways in which they use a
variety of roles to compensate and complement one anoth-
er, and the successful strategies they employ for managing
their time and responsibilities is likely to improve our
understanding of the needs of caregivers and the types of
support most beneficial to them.

Any reformed health care financing
system will have to find ways of pro-
viding high quality long-term care to
older Americans at a reasonable cost. In this book,
Ronald J. and Jacqueline L. Angel argue that policies
based on the assumption of a homogenous population
will fail to take advantage of the opportunities that eth-
nic and cultural diversity offer for the long-term care of
the elderly. Based on their assessments of the levels of
need for long-term care among black, Hispanic, and
non-Hispanic white older persons, they offer viable and
attractive possible alternatives to institutionalization in
the long-term care of the elderly.
