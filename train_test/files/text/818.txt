This study examined the effects of declining functional status and the availability of
assistance on community-based residential mobility. Wolinsky and colleagues (1993),
using data from the 1984, 1986, and 1988 waves of the Longitudinal Study on Aging,
reported other transitions that result from increased health demand, namely those of
nursing home placement and death. Using their functional health scales and recently
available statistical techniques, we performed a two-stage analysis within a health behavior
conceptual framework. We conclude that older adults who report several cognitive
limitations in the absence of assistance in the home are more likely to make residential
changes. Additionally, we determined that the independent effects of cognitive and lower
body deterioration trigger, in this case, community-based moves even when adjusting for
the effect of baseline levels of functional health and other factors in the model. Our
analysis extends the earlier findings of Wolinsky and colleagues to encompass residential
change as an ecological outcome of health decline in old age.

Health ecology--that is, environmental adaptations
to changes in health status--became a more promi-
nent concern for hospital administration, clinical prac-
tice, and medical research after Diagnostically Related
Croups (DRGs) were introduced into government re-
imbursement regulations for Medicare patients, thereby
limiting hospital stays. Environmental adaptations go
far beyond discharge planning, however, and are of
special interest in geriatrics and gerontology. The fit
of persons to their environments in very old age is
sometimes made problematic by declines in functional
health or by health crises that require extended recu-
peration. Several kinds of environmental adaptations,
or transitions, therefore, may result from declining func-
tional health. A good deal of attention has been paid
to the health care outcomes of functional declines,
such as institutionalization (Foley et al., 1992; Wolinsky,
1990; Wolinsky, Johnson, & Fitzgerald, 1992) and death
(Guralnik, LaCroiz, Branch, Kasi, & Wallace, 1992;
Manton, 1988). Comparatively little notice (Worobey
& Angel, 1990), however, has been paid in the healtn
care use literature to noninstitutional or community-
based moves, in contrast to moves resulting in institu-
tionalization, as responses to differing levels of func-
tional health. To what extent are such moves within
the community a response to increasing disability?

Litwak and Longino (1987) proposed that there were
three, not two, types of elderly migration associated
with different periods in the life course. In their typol-
ogy of moves, the first move that older people make
is now well known; it tends to follow retirement fairly
closely. Movers are often married couples in good
health with better than average financial resources
(Longino, Wiseman, Biggar, & Flynn, 1984) and ap-
pear to be motivated primarily by lifestyle consider-
ations. Wiseman (1980) called this type "amenity" mi-
gration. Of course, only a small minority of retired
persons ever makes this type of move. It is not re-
quired in a life course, but if it occurs, it tends to
happen early in retirement.
Litwak and Longino (1987) theorized that the mo-
tivation in the life course for a second type of move
arises when older people develop instrumental chronic
disabilities that make everyday household tasks diffi-
cult to perform. The presence of a spouse provides
help and motivation for performing these tasks. Brad-
sher, Longino, Jackson, & Zimmerman (1992) dem-
onstrated that motivation for this second move is
compounded when deficits from widowhood and dis-
ability are combined. As health demands arise, if older
people live at a distance from a person who is avail-
able to provide help and if they cannot adapt their
living environments adequately, they must move to
get the help they need. This type of move is not nec-
essarily the second in a sequence of moves in the
individual's life, even after retirement. However, per-
sons who make this type of move will have a higher
median age than those making a postretirement ame-
nity move, and in that cross-sectional sense, it is the
Vol. 39, No. 2, 1999 187
second move of the typology. The third type of move
is one to a nursing home when the health needs of
the older person overwhelm the capacity of the fam-
ily to provide informal support.
The existence of the second move was later tested
by Longino and his colleagues (Longino, Jackson, Zim-
merman, & Bradsher, 1991) using the 1984 and 1986
waves of the Longitudinal Study of Aging (LSOA). In
keeping with the conceptual model, their study fo-
cused on community-based moves and only one di-
mension of functional disability, measured by instru-
mental activities of daily living (lADLs; i.e., difficulty
doing heavy and light housework, shopping, prepar-
ing meals, managing money, and using the phone).
The predicted probability of moving during this 2-year
interval, regardless of specified migrant characteristics,
as produced from maximum likelihood estimation, was
7.3% and ranged from 2% to 15%, depending upon
the level of disability, while adjusting for other rel-
evant factors. Findings supportive to this analysis were
offered at about the same time by Speare, Avery, and
Lawton (1991), and more recently by Silverstein (1995),
who reported that health declines of older parents
were associated with residential moves bringing par-
ents and adult children geographically closer to one
another. The second move now seems firmly estab-
lished in the research literature. Our study elaborates
the second move concept.
In an attempt to explore the mechanisms connect-
ing health and mobility, Zimmerman, Jackson, Longino,
& Bradsher (1993) examined the economic and inter-
personal resources of persons making health-related
community-based moves, using the 1984 and 1986
waves of the LSOA. Family income, however, had no
independent effect on mobility in the face of declin-
ing functional health. The availability of assistance in
one's home, then, is a buffer to a health-motivated
environmental adjustment, such as moving, and is
considered in the present study.
In the retirement migration literature, the concept
of place ties has a strong influence on the likelihood
of moving (Longino et al., 1991). This concept, which
is drawn directly from geography-based studies of mobility
(Oldakowski & Roseman, 1986; Sullivan, 1985), is seen
theoretically as a counterbalance to the pushes and
pulls that motivate moves. Ties to place, particularly
among older adults, often include ties to geographic
regions and local support networks. The best mea-
sure of the concept in the LSOA, however, is indi-
cated by whether the migrant owns His or her dwell-
ing. Home ownership also figured prominently in the
models that were specified in the previously cited
studies of health and community-based moves in later
life and is included in our model as an adequate rep-
resentation of place ties.
Wolinsky and his colleagues (Wolinsky & Johnson,
1991; Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, & Johnson, 1992;
Wolinsky, Johnson, & Fitzgerald, 1992) produced a
set of five multiple-item scales of functional health taken
from or modeled after various measures of activities
of daily living (ADLs). In addition to stripped-down
versions of basic and instrumental (household) ADL
scales, they added three others. One is an advanced
(cognitive) ADL scale (difficulty managing money, talking
on the phone, and eating). The other two tapped
lower body limitations (difficulty walking, standing,
stooping, and lifting) and upper body limitations (diffi-
culty sitting, reaching up, reaching out, and grasping).
Following the coding conventions prescribed by Wo-
linsky and colleagues, it is possible to relate a much
richer range of measures for functional health to com-
munity-based residential change. In our investigation,
we use Wolinsky's definitions to group functional limi-
tations into meaningful areas, and we further investi-
gate how the number of limitations within these groups
may differentially alter the future probability of a resi-
dential move.
The employment of more complex measures of func-
tional health allows us to better understand the rela-
tionships between health demands and geographical
mobility. Earlier studies relied only on additive ADL
and IADL scales. Because the present study uses five
measures of functional health, it is possible to sort out
some of the subtleties of the effects of health demand
on community-based moves within a general multi-
variate model framework accounting for competing out-
comes such as institutionalization and death.
A more thorough examination of mobility and health
using LSOA data is now possible because of the
recent availability of computer software for analyzing
multicategory outcomes (e.g., nominal, ordinal outcomes)
obtained from longitudinal survey samples (Liang,
Zeger, & Qaqish, 1991; Miller, Davis, & Landis, 1993;
Shah, Barnwell, & Bieler, 1996). Until the release of
the MULTILOG procedure in SUDAAN (Shah et al.,
1996), statistical software that accounts for the survey
aspects of the sample design (i.e., cluster sampling
of participants with unequal probabilities of selection)
and permits the specification of models for longitudinal
data with multicategory outcomes was not readily avail-
able. The MULTILOG procedure permits the analyst
to use generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods
to perform estimation and inference for longitudinal
data (Liang et al., 1991; Miller et al., 1993). Prior to
release of this software, analysts of categorical outcomes
obtained from longitudinal survey samples were lim-
ited to use of binary or survival analysis techniques.
One GEE method is equivalent to the cluster data
methods developed for the analysis of survey sampling
data (Binder, 1983; Korn & Graubard, 1995), and thus
can provide a unified approach to the analysis of data
containing dependencies between repeated measure-
ments taken on individuals and within clusters defined
by the complex survey design (e.g., communities se-
lected within the complex survey sampling scheme).
For analysis of a rare outcome such as a residential
move, use of multiple time points for individuals per-
mits us to investigate whether it is possible to collapse
all changes between adjacent LSOA interviews (1984-
1986, 1986-1988, 1988-1990) into a single analysis
of 2-year change. Thus, this type of model can over-
come the previously mentioned limitations involv-
ing the small number of community-based moves be-
tween 1984 and 1986 that influenced the diversity of
models available to Longino and colleagues (1991).
By taking advantage of all moves occurring during each
188 The Gerontologist
transition period, this exploratory study asked the
following question: Does there exist an association be-
tween the availability of assistance and declining
levels of health in predicting a particular type of house-
hold adjustment (i.e., a community-based move), in
the same 2-year time period? Initially, predictors col-
lected only at the beginning of each interval are used
to gain a more thorough understanding of the nature
of future moves. Subsequently, to address the afore-
mentioned question, we relate the presence of assis-
tance and changes in functional limitations to the oc-
currence of concurrent community-based moves. As
such, this analysis considers the role of health demand
as a motivator of geographical mobility.
Methods
Sample
Data used in our analyses were drawn from all four
waves of the LSOA conducted by the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS, 1990) in collaboration with
the National Institute on Aging. The LSOA is based on
the 1984 Supplement on Aging (SOA) of the National
Health Interview Survey (NHIS), a probability sample
of noninstitutionalized persons aged 55 and older liv-
ing in the United States in 1984. In the LSOA, 7,541
SOA participants aged 70 or older in 1984 were fol-
lowed over a 6-year period with repeat interviews in
1986, 1988, and 1990 (Kovar, Fitte, & Chyba, 1992).
Proxy respondents, often family members, were inter-
viewed when the respondents were incapable of be-
ing interviewed. Due to financial constraints, only 5,151
LSOA participants were selected for reinterview in
1986. We restricted our initial analytical sample to this
subsample because participants with missing data in
1986 aid not contribute information to analyses of
change between 1984 and 1986 or 1986 and 1988.
Information from participants with unknown status
in one interval but complete data in two other con-
secutive interviews was used in our analyses. This has
implications for the number of observations used in
our models. Participants had to possess covariate in-
formation at the beginning of each time period to
be used in our analyses (N = 5,068 for 1984-1986,
N = 3,895 for 1986-1988, and N = 3,044 for 1988-
1990 for a total of 12,007 outcomes).
Outcome Measures
Responses given by participants or proxy respon-
dents at each of the LSOA interviews were compared
to determine whether a move took place within any
of the three 2-year periods comprising the LSOA. An
individual was categorized as having moved during a
particular interval if the individual reported a change
in residence in that 2-year time period. When data
obtained from a proxy were inconsistent with infor-
mation obtained from a later self-interview regarding
the time of the participant's move, the data from the
proxy were ignored. We also determined whether par-
ticipants moved to or remained in a nursing home,
died, made no residential transition, or had unknown
status during each 2-year period. We refer to these
five nominal outcome categories as "transition" states
in the remainder of this article.
Predictor Variables
Gender, age, and race were measured in the 1984
interview. Gender (men vs women) and race (White
vs all other races) were considered time-stationary co-
variates and their constant values were used to pre-
dict observed transitions for all intervals within all
models considered. Due to the small number of His-
panics and members of "other" ethnic groups present
in the sample, a more diverse categorization of race
was not possible. Age was measured in 1984 using
1-year increments and was categorized into 5-year
intervals from 70 to 90 for use in our models to esti-
mate a cross-sectional effect of aging on the probabil-
ity of the observed transition. These three predispos-
ing factors have been shown to be related to moving
in earlier studies (Longino et al., 1991; Jackson, Longino,
Zimmerman, & Bradsher, 1991), and they are rou-
tinely included in nearly all health behavior studies.
Change in age since 1984 was used to estimate the
longitudinal effect of aging. Because this variable only
could take on values of 0, 2, or 4 years, it also repre-
sented a survey transition year effect (1984-1986,
1986-1988,1988-1990) when coded using two "dummy"
variables. We refer to the variable representing this
effect as the "survey transition year" in subsequent dis-
cussions. Our parametrization of the aging effect is
similar to that described by Laird, Donnelly, and Ware
(1992).
We selected a cluster of variables, generally mea-
sured during all interviews of the LSOA, that were re-
lated to the resources inherent in the social environ-
ment. The familial and community resources hypoth-
esized to modify community-based moves are repre-
sented by a participant's living arrangement (alone vs
with others), marital status, home ownership (yes/no),
yearly family income, and assistance with three areas
of functioning. There were no direct measures of par-
ticular community services or social support. Marital
status was coded using three levels: married, widowed
within the previous 2 years, and other status (e.g., di-
vorced, separated, single, widow for >2 years). Home
ownership, the measure of place ties, was not mea-
sured in the 1986 interview; thus, for prediction of
the 1986-1988 transition, we imputed 1984 home
ownership values for missing 1986 values. The impact
of this imputation would be to lessen any estimated
effect of home ownership on moves. Family income
in 1984 was coded using an unknown category and
four additional categories representing income incre-
ments of $5,000 (<$5,000; $5,000 to <$10,000; $10,000
to <$15,000; and >$15,000). The assistance variables
are described below in relation to the defined areas
of functional status. Finally, the ability to adapt the
home environment, although of theoretical importance,
was not measured in the LSOA.
Health measures make up the primary independent
variable. Hospitalization in the previous year was con-
sidered a characteristic that may capture acute health

conditions in contrast to the five areas of functional
status developed based on statistical analyses of these
same LSOA data by Wolinsky, Callahan, Fitzgerald, and
Johnson (1993). These included: (1) Basic Activities
of Daily Living (BADLs)--any difficulty with bathing,
dressing, getting out of bed, toileting, or a related item
on walking; (2) Household Activities of Daily Living
(HHADL)--any difficulty with meal preparation, snopping,
and light or heavy housework; (3) Advanced Activities
of Daily Living (AADL)--any difficulty with managing
money, using the telephone, and eating; (4) Lower
Body Limitations (LBL)--any difficulty with walking a
quarter of a mile, walking up 10 steps without rest,
standing or being on the feet for two nours, stooping,
crouching or kneeling, and lifting or carrying 25 pounds;
and (5) Upper Body Limitations (UBL)--any difficulty
sitting for two hours, reaching over the head, reach-
ing out as if to shake hands, and using fingers to grasp
objects. Several of the functional tasks contained within
these LBL and UBL scales involve activities that may
utilize strength in both lower and upper body areas.
Within each of these functional status areas, we de-
fined variables representing the number of limitations
reported: two variables were used to represent the
levels 0, 1, and >1 limitation within BADLs, HHADLs,
and AADLs, whereas single variables taking the values
0-5 and 0--4 were usea for LBLs and UBLs, respec-
tively. For an individual reporting any difficulties with
BADLs, HHADLs, or AADLs, we were able to obtain
information regarding whether the person received any
assistance performing any of the tasks within these
areas of functioning. The different approach for cod-
ing the number of BADLs, HHADLs, and AADLs, in
contrast to LBLs and UBLs, made it possible to in-
vestigate the effect of assistance within those persons
reporting only a single limitation versus individuals
reporting more than one limitation. As previously
mentioned, these assistance variables were considered
interpersonal resources.
Statistical Modeling--Stage 7
The initial model that we investigated used multi-
variate logistic regression (Agresti, 1990) to analyze a
five-category nominal response with outcomes defined
as (1) institutionalization; (2) move; (3) death; (4) un-
known status; and (5) no move. Although "no move"
is not a literal transition, to simplify the presentation,
all outcomes are referred to as transition states. Be-
cause our primary interest was in the'odds of moving
relative to not moving, our use of the other categories
adjusted our analyses for the competing transition
states. We present the results from our models in terms
of ratios of odds for being institutionalized, moving,
death, or unknown status relative to the no move cat-
egory. A mathematical description of both Stage 1 and
Stage 2 (explained in the next section) models is pro-
vided in the Appendix.
We took the following approach for the develop-
ment of the Stage 1 model predicting transitions to
the five nominal categories using variables containing
information collected at the beginning of each of the
three transition periods. Initially, we entered variables
representing gender, age, race, hospitalization, mari-
tal status, living arrangements (alone/others), family in-
come, home ownership, and survey transition year effects
into the model. We also assumed the presence of an
interaction term between gender and age, because a
differential effect of age on death and institutionaliza-
tion for men versus women was expected. Within this
model, we investigated for two-way interactions be-
tween gender, age, race, and each other variable, as
well as a three-way interaction between marital sta-
tus, living arrangements, and gender. We had interest
in developing separate models within strata defined
by marital status, living arrangements, and gender; how-
ever, the total sample sizes available for the move out-
come precluded this possibility. The two- and three-
way interaction terms were retained in the model if
they met either of two criterion: (1) if the overall test
of the effect of the interaction across all outcome cat-
egories was significant at p < .05, or (2) if the overall
test was not significant, but the component of the in-
teraction term related to moves versus no transition
was significant at p < .05. Although this approach to
model building runs an increased risk of Type I error,
within our exploratory analysis, to control appropri-
ately for the probability of response in the competing
outcome states, we felt it necessary to include inter-
actions when the overall test of the effect across all
outcome categories was significant. Inclusion of inter-
action terms related to the move outcome was neces-
sary as these terms were of primary interest to our
analysis.
To the aforementioned model, we added the assis-
tance and functional status variables collected at the
beginning of each transition interval. For BADLs, HHADLs,
and AADLs, using the interaction inclusion criterion
described previously, we also investigated for interac-
tions between the number of reported functional
limitations and both assistance (for BADLs, HHADLs,
and AADLs) and living alone.
Because individuals in our sample could possess up
to three outcomes (1984-1986, 1986-1988, 1988-
1990), the validity of our modeling approach was con-
tingent on an investigation for interactions between
the variable representing the transition survey year and
associated covariates used in these models (see Ap-
pendix for further details). If these interactions were
significant, we would be unable to combine param-
eters across the multiple transition periods, thus ne-
cessitating the use of separate parameters to repre-
sent the effects of the variable for each transition
period. The same criterion, as described earlier for
retaining other interactions, was used to investigate
survey year interactions.
Statistical Modeling--Stage 2
To investigate how changes in functional status were
associated with the probability of concurrent commu-
nity-based moves, we introduced change in functional
limitations into the aformentioned model by fitting
models containing both the baseline measure and the
follow-up measure. In contrast to the Stage 1 model,
this model was not prospective in that both the
190 The Gerontologist
change in functional status and the transition occurred
in the same interval. Additionally, because participants
had to possess covariate information at the end of
each interval, it was necessary to exclude from this
analysis persons having the outcomes of institutional-
ization, death, and unknown status at the end of
an interval. Thus, this model made inference only to
those noninstitutionalized survivors with known status
at the end of the 2-year transition period. The num-
ber of observations used in this model was N = 3,862
for 1984-1986, N = 2,908 for 1986-1988, and N =
2,252 for 1988-1990, equaling a total of 9,022 tran-
sitions.
Using initial and follow-up functional status levels
in this latter predictive model produces results that
are equivalent to fitting a model containing the initial
level and the change from that initial level. The pa-
rameters from our model can be used to obtain odds
ratios representing change that are identical to those
that would be obtained from a model that explicitly
models change. It is important to note that, for either
of these approaches, the interaction between the ini-
tial level and the follow-up level (or baseline and
change variables) should be investigated; otherwise,
the model may make the restrictive assumptions that
(a) the effect of change is independent of the starting
point, and (b) the odds ratios related to improvements
are the reciprocal of odds ratios associated with
declines of equivalent magnitude. We investigated
for these interactions for all types of functional limi-
tations.
Model Estimation
Independence estimating equations were used to
estimate parameters within each model (Liang & Zeger,
1986). A robust estimate of the variance (Binder, 1983;
Liang & Zeger, 1986) was used to account for depen-
dency both within primary sampling units (PSUs) de-
fined for the original NHIS survey (Kovar, Fitte, & Chyba,
1992), and between repeated outcomes obtained on
the same participant. Because the PSU references the
highest level of clustering, with repeated measures taken
on participants falling within single PSUs, this use of
the robust variance estimate also accounts for depen-
dence between the multiple measurements obtained
for each participant (Korn & Graubard, 1995). With-
out use of this robust variance estimate, the standard
errors of parameter estimates potentially would be in-
accurate. When the correlation between repeated out-
comes and within clusters is zero, these methods re-
duce to maximum likelihood.
All results that we present are weighted using
weights that account for the unequal probabilities of
selection and nonresponse adjustments. It is well known
that the use of weights can increase variances of pa-
rameter estimates; however, parameters estimated in
weighted analyses are typically less biased than those
obtained from unweighted analyses. Following the sug-
gestions of Korn ana Graubard (1995), we estimated
the inefficiency that resulted from incorporating weights
in our analyses. These analyses indicated that the in-
flation in variances resulting from our use of weights
was small; thus, all results are presented in terms of
weighted analyses. Full details on unweighted analy-
ses are available upon request. Modeling results
were obtained using the MULTILOG procedure of
SUDAAN (Shah et at., 1996) and SAS (1989) proce-
dures.
Findings
Descriptive Results
Table 1 presents a description of the sample/popu-
lation. The number of moves and reason for moving
during each transition period are included at the top
of this table. The second type of move, as formulated
by Litwak and Longino (1987), would include the com-
munity-based moves that were motivated by health
or a desire to live closer to children and possibly some
moves listed as residential considerations. Moves listed
as resulting from residential considerations may include
moves resulting in "better or improved living condi-
tions, arrangements and environment" or residential
limitations related to "location, size and design." The
proportion of movers giving at least one of these rea-
sons was 56% in 1984, 51% in 1986, and 56% in
1988. The mean age of persons moving for health rea-
sons or a desire to live closer to children was 80 or
older in each interval, whereas the youngest group of
movers had an average age in the mid-70s and con-
sisted of those moving for financial reasons. Although
they are not the focus of this article, lower average
ages tend to characterize amenity, or lifestyle-moti-
vated, migrants.
Table 1 also contains the percentage of participants
making each of the five types of "transitions" during
each period. Five thousand sixty-eight of the 5,151
LSOA participants selected to be interviewed in 1986
possessed covariate information in 1984. Of these,
2.8% were institutionalized, 6.1% moved, 11.1% died,
7.5% had unknown status, and 72.5% remained in
their 1984 residence during the subsequent 2 years.
The percentage of "nonmovers" that had others move
in with them was 3.31% for 1984-1986, 3.63% for
1986-1988, and 3.06% for 1988-1990. These per-
centages were too small to permit a more specific
categorization of the nonmove classification. The total
number of transitions drops each year due to deaths
in previous periods and the inconsistent follow-up of
institutionalized participants. Our models make infer-
ence to participants until institutionalization or death.
Participants with -unknown status in one period do
not appear in the subsequent interval, but unknowns
between 1984-1986 can come back into the sample
between 1988-1990. Thus, transitional status is re-
ported for only 3,895 participants during the 1986-
1988 interval and 3,044 participants during the 1988-
1990 interval.
The bottom half of Table 1 provides a description
of the percentages of persons having specified char-
acteristics in each transition period. Other than mari-
tal status, the nonfunctional status characteristics are
fairly consistent across all three transition periods. The

aData are percentage reporting any limitation with mean number of limitations given in parentheses.
difference in the percentage widowed in the previous
2-year period in 1984 versus 1986 and 1988 is most
probably related to how the information was obtained
at each interview. In 1986 and 1988, participants were
asked whether they had been widowed since the pre-
vious interview, whereas, in 1984 participants indi-
cated how long they had been widowed. The per-
centages of participants reporting any limitations in the
five functional status areas increases from 1984 to 1986,
but remains fairly constant for the 1986-1988 and 1988-
1990 transitions.
In Table 2, we present data on the change in func-
tional status over each transition period. Within each
area of functional limitation, the mean number of limi-
tations increases in each transition period. However,
based on the data reported in the lower panel of this
table, clearly some participants do experience im-
provements, reporting some limitations at the prece-
dent interview and no limitations at the subsequent
interview.
In Table 3, we report the impact of assistance on
all subsequent transitions within categories defined by
the number of limitations reported by the participant.
LBLs and UBLs are not included in this table because
assistance information was not collected on items used
to create these two dimensions of functional status.
Clearly, assistance may have an impact on the prob-
ability of moving for those receiving assistance for BADLs
and AADLs ana reporting greater than one limitation.
For BADLs, the presence of assistance is associated
with a twofold decrease in the probability of a move
(.0363 for those receiving assistance vs .0724 for those
without assistance), whereas, for AADLs, the presence
of assistance is associated with a threefold decrease in
this probability (.0444 for those receiving assistance vs
.1345 for those without assistance).

Modeling Results
The Stage 1 model investigated trends in moves in
the two-year transition periods (1984-1986, 1986-1988,
and 1988-1990), using covariates collected at the be-
ginning of each interval. Odds ratios, relative to the
"no move" category, and 95 percent confidence in-
tervals obtained from this model are presented in Table
4. The results for the move outcome are presented in
the second column of this table, with the results for

the competing outcome states presented in the final
three columns. As is evident from Table 4, some of
the factors listed in the first column are significantly
associated with the other competing outcome states
but not the move outcome. Our discussion concen-
trates on the move outcome and those effects that
were significant at p < .05. Because no interactions
between effects and survey transition year were found
to be significant, we were able to fit common param-
eters across all survey years for each effect (see Ap-
pendix for details).
Overall, we found that the odds of a move versus
no transition for men were 1.51 times these odds for
women. As expected, men also experienced signifi-
cantly greater odds for death. This result is consistent
with the unadjusted, weighted probabilities of each
outcome for men versus women. In the unadjusted
data, across all periods, the percentages of movers among
men and women are almost equal (5.01% for men vs
5.44% for women). However, the percentage of men
that died exceeded that of women (14.8% for men vs
9.7% for women), resulting in increased odds ratios
for men for both of these outcomes relative to the
"no move" outcome. Age in 1984 showed minimal
impact on the probability of a subsequent move, the
only significant increase in the odds of moving being
for men aged 90 or older, where the odds ratio was
3.02. For men in this oldest age group, the percent-
age of men who moved was 8.3%, versus between
4.5% and 5.5% for men in any other age group. As
expected, age did have a significant impact on the
odds of institutionalization and death.
No main effects were found for the odds of moving
versus "no move" for race (p = .19 for move, p = .01
overall for all outcomes); marital status (p = .32 for
move, p = .32 overall for all outcomes); income (p =
Vol. 39, No. 2, 1999 195
.42 for move, p < .001 overall for all outcomes); or
hospitalization (p = .98 for move, p < .001 overall for
all outcomes). The effect of transition year was signifi-
cant on both the odds of moving relative to "no move"
(p = .001) and overall for all outcomes (p = .003).
LSOA participants had significantly lower odds of
moving in the 1988-1990 interval (OR = 0.60, 95%
Cl = 0.46-0.79) than in the 1984-1986 interval.
Significant interactions were found between gen-
der and living alone (p = .28 for move, p = .005
overall for all outcomes), and gender and home own-
ership (p = .006 for move, p = .09 overall for all
outcomes). Although not significantly higher, men liv-
ing alone had increased odds for all outcomes versus
men living with others, whereas women living alone
had essentially equivalent or significantly smaller odds
(death outcome OR = 0.77, 95% Cl = 0.64-0.92)
than women living with others. For home ownership,
both men and women who owned their homes had
greatly reduced odds of moving relative to those who
did not own their homes; however, the effect was
significantly stronger among men (OR = 0.26) com-
pared with women (OR = 0.46).
Using the parameter estimates from both the mari-
tal status and living arrangements variables, we deter-
mined that for recently widowed men living alone,
the odds of a move were 1.59 (95% Cl 0.97-2.56)
times these same odds for married men, of whom
>95% reported living with their spouse. For recently
widowed women living alone, the odds of a move
were 1.25 (95% Cl 0.93-1.89) times these odds for
married women, of whom more than 95% lived with
their spouses. For men and women not recently wid-
owed or with "other" marital status who lived alone
versus those that lived with "others," the estimated
odds of a move were 1.20 for men (95% Cl 0.77-
1.88) and 0.96 for women (95% Cl 0.69-1.32).
The impact of functional disability and assistance
on future transitions differed depending on the type
of functional disability reported. The number of
BADLs did exhibit an influence of borderline statisti-
cal significance on the odds of moving (p = .07 for
move, p = .003 overall for all outcomes). For those
participants reporting a single BADL, the odds of moving
were 1.35 times these odds for those reporting zero
BADLs (95% Cl = 0.99-1.82). The odds ratio for par-
ticipants reporting more than one BADL relative to
those reporting zero BADLs was 1.49 (95% Cl = 1.02-
2.19). In contrast to increased numbers of BADLs be-
ing associated with increased odds of moving, a non-
significant trend of decreasing odds for moving with
an increasing number of HHADLs was found (p =
.12 for move, p = .072 overall for all outcomes). Base-
line levels of neither LBLs (p = .54 for move, p >
.001 overall for all outcomes) nor UBLs (p = .26 for
move, p = .014 overall for all outcomes) exhibited a
significant effect on the odds of moving.
Aid for BADLs (p = .45) and HHADLs (p = .09)
did not exhibit a significant influence on the odds of
moving. Interactions between these variables and
the baseline levels of BADLs and HHADLs also were
not statistically significant (p > .10 for all hypothesis
tests). In contrast, a significant interaction was found
between the number of AADLs and assistance with
AADLs (p = .04 for move, p = .20 overall for all
outcomes). Because the interaction between the num-
ber of AADLs and assistance results in different odds
ratios depending on whether assistance was received,
we report in Table 4 the odds ratios associated with
an increasing number of AADLs separately for those
receiving ana/or not receiving assistance. Likewise, odds
ratios for the impact of receiving assistance are re-
ported separately within each level of AADLs.
Conclusions obtained using the adjusted model-
based results were very similar to conclusions based
on the unadjusted, weighted percentages reported in
Table 3. For persons reporting no assistance, having
more than one AADL was associated with increased
odds of moving (OR = 5.31, 95% Cl = 1.74-16.20).
Likewise, within those reporting more than one AADL,
the presence of assistance greatly reduced the odds
of moving (OR = 0.27, 95% Cl = 0.08-0.90).
In Stage 2 of our model building, to the variables
contained in the aforementioned model, we added
the follow-up levels of functional status as measured
at the end of the same interval for which the out-
come was obtained. Here, our discussion of model
results concentrates solely on how the odds of mov-
ing are associated with a concurrent change in func-
tional status. Controlling for the variables contained
in Table 4, we found significant effects for follow-up
levels of AADLs (p < .001), LBLs (p = .04), and a
significant interaction between initial and follow-up
levels of HHADLs (p = .01). For LBLs, an increase of
a single limitation was significantly associated with
an increased odds of moving (OR = 1.10, 95% Cl =
1.01-1.20). For UBLs, there was no significant asso-
ciation between change and the odds of moving
(OR = 0.92, 95% Cl = 0.81-1.05).
In Table 5, we present the results for BADLs,
HHADLs, and AADLs in terms of ratios of odds for a
change relative to no change from the initially observed
level, controlling for whether assistance was present
in the household. All of the confidence intervals for
BADLs contain the value 1, agreeing with the overall
finding of nonsignificance of these effects at both
baseline and follow-up. Due to the significant interac-
tion between initial and follow-up levels of HHADLs,
odds ratios greater than unity were estimated for either
improvements or declines in functional status; how-
ever, only the odds ratio for improvement from one
limitation to no limitations was statistically significant
at p < .05. The odds ratio for decline from one limi-
tation had borderline statistical significance (p = .06).
In contrast to these findings for HHADLs, all esti-
mated odds ratios for AADLs were statistically sig-
nificant (p < .05). For AADLs, after controlling for
whether assistance was reported at the earlier inter-
view, we found that declines were consistently associ-
ated with increased odds of moving, whereas improve-
ments were associated with decreased odds of moving.
Discussion
In 1993, Wolinsky and associates reported the first
evidence from the LSOA that declines in certain types

of functional health predict nursing home placement
and death. Specifically, they found that deterioration
in cognitive function and lower body strength were
associated with increased risk of these two outcomes
even when the effect of other factors (and baseline
values of the disability measures themselves) were netted
out.
The findings of the present investigation represent
an advance in health ecology by combining the eco-
logical changes studied by Wolinsky and those of re-
searchers concerned with community-based residen-
tial moves. In earlier research using LSOA data, Bradsher
and colleagues (1992) found that the loss of a spouse
greatly increases the probability of a move when health
declines. In contrast, our model did not indicate that
widowhood within the past 2 years was significantly
related to a move in the subsequent 2 years when
controlling for baseline functional status. The differ-
ence in these results potentially lies in the fact that
we did not look just at those experiencing health de-
clines.
Similar to the earlier work of Longino and colleagues
(1991), we found that home ownership, a surrogate
for place ties, had a strong impact on the odds of
moving for both men and women. However, we also
identified that this relationship is stronger for men than
for women. Combining all transition intervals, approxi-
mately 3.5% of men owning a home made a commu-
nity-based move; however, of those men who did not
own homes, slightly more than 11% made moves. For
women, a similar relationship held, with 4% of home-
owners and 8% of those not owning homes making
community-based moves. It could be argued that per-
sons who do not own homes may have already made
transitions for reasons related to health deterioration,
or that they may have fewer financial resources, which
mitigates against a move. Unfortunately, this question
could not be addressed using available LSOA data.
After controlling for numerous baseline health-related
factors, this relationship continued to hold up within
our models. With respect to this relationship, it is im-
portant to note that much of the same information is
contained in the variables representing home owner-
ship, living alone, and marital status. For example, in
the absence of either the home ownership or marital
status variables, living alone was highly predictive of a
move for men with an odds ratio of 1.5; however,
when either of these variables were in the model, this
odds ratio dropped to approximately 1.3. When both
home ownership and marital status were included, the
odds ratio further dropped to 1.2. Thus, due to the
correlation between these variables, it was not pos-
sible to "tease out" the full effect of each. The strength
of the home ownership variable in the presence of all
other variables, however, does underscore the impor-
tance of place ties for both men and women.
A general contribution of our analysis is that our
models illustrate that a combination of factors, includ-
ing the type and number of functional limitations and
the presence or absence of assistance, may have dif-
ferential effects on the probability of a residential transi-
tion. For instance, assistance did not have substantial
impact on the probability of a residential transition for
household or basic ADLs; however, the presence of
assistance had a substantial impact on the probability
of a move for participants reporting more than a single
advanced ADL Interestingly, inspection of the unad-
justed, weighted probabilities associated with advanced
ADLs reveals that persons who reported receiving as-
sistance also had increased probabilities of institution-
alization and death and a decreased probability of
having unknown status, relative to those who reported
no assistance. Thus, one hypothesis is that these indi-
viduals may be somewhat sicker and have already
Vol.39, No. 2, 1999 197
made residential adjustments, whereas those without
assistance are in the process of making adjustments.
Wolinsky and colleagues (1993) did find lower ini-
tial levels of basic self-care, such as dressing, bathing
and toileting, to predict subsequent nursing home
placement. Our initial model (see Table 4) also dem-
onstrated this effect for the institutionalization out-
come. However, when Wolinsky and colleagues (1993)
applied a dynamic model, examining the effect of change
in disability as a predictor, change in basic self-care
was not predictive of nursing home placement. In our
study, such initial levels of basic self-care needs were
somewhat predictive of a residential move (p = .07).
In the Stage 2 model investigating the impact of change
in limitations on the probability of a move, the one
most closely resembling the dynamic model of Wolin-
sky and colleagues (1993), interval increases in BADLs
(controlling for initial level) were not predictive. In-
stead, similar to the findings of Wolinsky and col-
leagues (1993), for nursing home placement, the
deterioration of advanced (cognitive) ADLs and lower
body strength significantly predicted a community-based
residential move, even when adjusting for the effect
of baseline levels of functional health and other fac-
tors. In this regard, our analysis extends the earlier
findings of Wolinsky and colleagues (1993) to encom-
pass residential change as an ecological outcome of
health decline in old age.
Litwak and Longino (1987) predicted that residen-
tial moves are one type of environmental adjustment
that could be anticipated when functional status de-
clines. In the face of moderate increases in functional
disability, they argued, there would be a correspond-
ing increase in the need for informal social support,
which could be provided best by family members.
Household ADLs (HHADLs), Wolinsky's dimension of
functionality that most closely resembles lADLs, how-
ever, showed little utility in predicting community-based
moves in the present analysis--that is, until interinterval
change in HHADLs is considered apart from its initial
level. In our Stage 2 model, both improvements and
declines were associated with an increased probabil-
ity of moving. The odds ratios, however, were only
significant or of borderline significance for individuals
with one limitation at the previous interview. It is this
change in ADL level that was emphasized by Litwak
and Longino as the potential trigger for the second
type of move. Based on our results, it appears that
any instability in HHADLs may, in fact, trigger an ad-
justment.
When considering our results, one must judge the
potential limitations of our study. Proximity to chil-
dren, a consideration that was important in the Litwak/
Longino model was not addressed in this analysis
because the data were not collected in all intervals.
Litwak and Longino's (1987) research suggests that
proximity may be as important to environmental en-
richment for some older persons as living with others.
Regarding analytical limitations, although we report
parameter estimates and confidence intervals for our
models, we do not report tests of fit for these models.
Unfortunately, methods for assessing the goodness-of-
fit of logistic models to longitudinal survey data are
not yet fully developed. The dependence between re-
peated measurements on individuals and observations
within households makes traditional approaches for
assessing the fit of logistic regression models (e.g., ROC
curves, Hosmer-Lemeshow tests) not applicable to this
setting (Hosmer & Lemeshow, 1989).
Missing from our analyses is a consideration of the
lag effect between declines in the various types of func-
tional status and outcomes such as community-based
moves. Had we used lagged effects, we would have
been unable to use the 1984-1986 transition as an
outcome because measures of functional disabilities
were not collected prior to the first interview in 1984.
Thus, our analyses have concentrated on how con-
current changes in functional health and moving may
be related, thus, potentially investigating the short-term
impact of changes in functional status. However, our
findings for the model relating change in various as-
pects of functional status to transitions in the same
interval may be limited by the fact that the temporal-
ity of concurrent changes within an interval cannot be
established. When data are collected in 2-year inter-
vals such as in the LSOA, investigation of concurrent
relationships may be the only means of determining
the effects of changes in limitations that may have close
temporal relationships to subsequent adjustments.
Because functional status was collected only every
2 years among this oldest-old population, a consider-
ation of how lagged effects alter the probability of
transitions that subsequently take place anywhere from
2 to 4 years later might capture how the various mea-
sures of functional status have long-term effects on com-
munity-based residential adjustments. The second type
of move, as discussed by Litwak and Longino (1987),
may turn out to be a cluster of types of health-related
community-based moves.

Modeling Approaches for Stage 1 & 2 Models
Stage 1 Model
A generalized logit model allowing for both discrete
and continuous explanatory variables (Agresti, 1990,
p. 313) was used to model the probability of a transi-
tion (institutionalization, community-based move, death,
unknown status, no household move) during each
interval. Defining ; = 1, 2, 3, as the transition inter-
val, j = 1, . . . , 5 as the outcome categories, and
letting k denote the participant in the survey, the ex-
pected probabilities from this model take the form:
(1)
5
I exp(P;x*)
Here, xik
is the vector of predictor variables for the
kth participant during the ith interval and also con-
tains indicator variables allowing a transition-year
effect. For identifiability purposes, we let (35
= 0 (pa-
rameters associated with no household move during
the interval), thus resulting in the multiple logit model:
7 = 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 .
The transition year effect was parameterized with
respect to the 1984-1986 interval, thus using two dummy
variables to represent the three transition periods. Note
that Equation 1 specified common (3s across all transi-
tion periods. This assumption was tested for each pre-
dictor variable by fitting an interaction between each
predictor variable and the transition-year effect. By fit-
ting the common effects across transition years, and
adjusting for a transition year effect, we were able to
gain power for investigating relationships between po-
tential predictors and the relatively rare household
move outcome. However, we do note that one draw-
back associated with this approach is that the power
to reject the null hypothesis of common effects across
transition intervals (i.e., the test of the interactions be-
tween predictor variables and the transition-year ef-
fect) may be low for some predictor variables.
Odds ratios were estimated from the above model
using the following approach. Assume, for sake of il-
lustration, that the logistic model for White males
relating the probability of response in the "Institution-
alized" category to the probability of response in the
"No Move" category is specified as
log (Prob Institutionalized / Prob No Move)jk
=
V, + *c, + **i + ft ** '
where //,, x^, and xR1
represent the intercept, gender
effect, and race effect, respectively, for this logit model
which also contains the terms j ^ x.k
controlling for both
other covariates and the transition-year effects. In Table
A-1, we specify a parameterization that could be used
to fit a model relating the main effects of gender and
race to these five response categories, assuming each
of the cells in the table contains the additional terms
The odds ratios specific to any outcome category
for either race or gender, controlling for the other factor,
are found by exponentiating the differences between

parameters in selected cells of the above table. For
instance, the ratio of the odds of being "Institutional-
ized" relative to "No Move" for men versus women,
controlling for "White" race, is determined as follows:

assuming the same levels of other covariates {xik

.)
for the men and women being compared. Exactly the
same odds ratio is obtained controlling for "All Other
Races." If an interaction between race and gender is
entered into the model, then different odds ratios are
obtained when controlling for the different racial clas-
sifications.
Stage 2 Model
For the Stage 2 model, we entered variables repre-
senting functional status at the end of the transition
period into the Stage 1 models. Because these vari-
ables could only be obtained on noninstitutionalized
survivors, this restricted our model to a simple logistic
regression model of "community-based movers" ver-
sus "nonmovers." Using the above notation, the prob-
ability of moving during the /th transition interval can
be written as
. %
exp(P'x/fc
)
* 1 + expip'xj
Here, xjk
also contains terms representing functional
status at both the beginning and end of each interval.
Tests for common transition interval effects were per-
formed in the same manner as was used for Stage 1.
