Introduction
Studies about obesity reveal a wide variety of disciplinary
foci, from medicine to nutrition, and economics to transpor-
tation and public policy. Methods vary across disciplines, as
does variable measurement. Hamersh (1) notes the problem
of data availability. Sturm (2) and McKinnon et al. (3) identify
problems with measuring the food and built environments
and physical activity. In order to move the obesity research
agenda forward, the academic community must recognize
both the challenges and opportunities that exist when data
are complex, measures differ across disciplinary lines, and no
one dataset or methodology can capture all the variables that
contribute to obesity (3). This study explores the possibility
of linking three population-based nationally representative
databases to better understand the impact that food patterns,
time use, and demographic characteristics have on obesity,
based on the concept that individuals produce health using
available resources (4,5).
Nutritionists focus on relationships between intake of foods
and obesity (6­8). Economists focus on expenditures on food
and budget shares (9,10). Recently, nutrition scholars have
recognized the importance of both household purchasing
behaviors and the characterization of the achievement and
maintenance of a healthy weight as "work" that must be "man-
aged" (11). In the consumer economics field, the household
production model has been a framework of choice for research
(4) and has been expanded to include the production of health
(5). However, studying the production of a healthy weight is
still in the exploratory stage (1,12­14).
The number of eating occasions, including snacking, in addi-
tion to where people consume food, i.e., at home, in restaurants
or at fast food establishments, influence obesity. That is partly
due to an increase in the average portion sizes of snack foods,
soft drinks and in all restaurant settings (15­17). Snacking
impacts total daily caloric intake as people fail to compensate
by eating less at subsequent meals (18).
A body of work related to time spent in meal production and
eating is developing (1,19). While still largely anecdotal, there
is some evidence that knowledge of cooking increases healthy
food intake and the United States is a nation that cannot or
does not cook (20). Research has also found that a decrease
in the number of meals prepared "from scratch" increased the
probability of being overweight in a national sample (12). But
people perceive less time to cook (21,22).
Other time uses are linked to obesity. Time spent in front of
a computer or television (screen time) as well as other forms
of inactivity are detrimental to health (23,24). Americans fall
short of meeting exercise guidelines, spending less than 20min
daily in exercise, sports, or recreation but over 2 hours watch-
ing television (25). Sleep (or lack thereof) may be connected to
overweight (26).
Research links obesity with demographic characteristics
including educational attainment, gender, race, and age (27­30).
Other factors include attributes of the built environment.
Research has linked walkability, urban location, and use of non-
motorized transportation modes to decreased obesity (31,32).
The conceptual basis for this study is Grossman's (5) model
of the demand for health capital, an extension of Becker's (4)
Time Use and Food Pattern Influences
on Obesity
Jane M. Kolodinsky1 and Amanda B. Goldstein2
The rise of obesity in the United States over the past 25 years has resulted in an increase in the number of research
studies published related to the causes, consequences, and possible solutions to the problem. Most would agree
that obesity is a multi-dimensional problem that requires a range of solutions related to individual diet and activity,
food and built environment, and public policy. Examination of complex relationships between food choice, time use
patterns, sociodemographic characteristics and obesity has been limited by data availability and disciplinary focus.
Using the theory of the production of health capital, this paper links empirical data from the Consumer Expenditure,
Current Population, and American Time Use Surveys to provide estimates of the impacts of food expenditure and time
use patterns on obesity in single female headed households of 31­50 years of age.

theory of the allocation of time. The details are described else-
where (12,13). Building stocks of health capital, one measure
of which is a healthy weight, is a decision made at the house-
hold level. Individuals, given an initial stock of health, produce
health rather than consume it from the market as they would
in a traditional neoclassical demand model. The model allows
the examination of the effects of time use, purchased inputs
and household characteristics on the production of a healthy
weight. Certain time uses result in energy output, e.g., physi-
cal activity. Other time uses result in less energy output, e.g.,
sedentary behaviors including screen time. Some time is com-
bined with purchased inputs and results in energy input, e.g.,
cooking time and purchased food for consumption at home.
However, research on measuring food and physical activity
environments is relatively recent, at an early stage of develop-
ment, and few standard measures exist (3). Any conceptual
model which attempts to incorporate multiple factors related
to obesity becomes increasingly complex. We estimate a mul-
tivariate version of the health capital model that permits the
testing of several hypotheses, Ceteris Paribus. H1 and H2 are
derived from the literature, which has relied mostly on bivari-
ate statistics to examine relationships between demographic
variables and obesity. H3, H4, and H5 are formulated based on
the energy balance equation (24).
H1: Demographic characteristics of lower income, lower
education, rural location, and being of black or Hispanic eth-
nicity are associated with increased obesity;
H2: Food time use patterns that include more "cooking time"
and "mindful eating" are associated with decreased obesity;
H3: Food patterns that include more fast and other food
away from home are associated with increased obesity;
H4: Time use patterns that involve more sedentary behav-
iors are associated with increased obesity; and
H5: Time use patterns that involve more physically active
behaviors are associated with decreased obesity.
Methods and Procedures
Necessary data include food expenditures, time use, demographic
characteristics and measures of height and weight. No one nationally
representative database contains all this information. Therefore, the
Eating and Health Module of the American Time Use Survey (ATUS)
is linked with individual data from the Current Population Survey
and grouped data from the Consumer Expenditure Survey (CE). The
CE has been available yearly since 1984 from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics (http://www.bls.gov/cex/) and contains information neither
about height nor weight. In the time diary portion of the ATUS (http://
www.bls.gov/tus), respondents sequentially report activities they did
between 4:00 AM on the day before the interview until 4:00 AM on the
day of the interview. The ATUS Eating and Health Module provides
height and weight information. Cross sectional data from 2006 to 2007
were pooled.
This analysis includes single female headed households of 31­50 years
of age without a disability. Use of this subsample is based on a variety of
disciplinary findings. The Food Guide Pyramid and the 2005 Dietary
Guidelines for Americans (DGA) (33) make recommendations by gender
and age: 18­30, 31­50, and individuals over the age of 50; our selec-
tion follows that categorization. People with disabilities were excluded
to ensure that time use was dictated by personal choice and not physical
limits. Underweight and pregnant women were excluded; underweight
presents a distinct public health issue, and pregnant women may have a
higher BMI without being overweight. Time use patterns differ across the
life stage (34). Individuals with a BMI >50 were excluded, since morbid
obesity presents additional and more serious health problems and does
not parallel overweight or moderate obesity trends (35).
We reference both the Food Guide Pyramid and DGA to identify food
patterns (33). We combined or renamed the CE broad food expenditure
categories to correspond to the specific food groups identified in the
DGA (33). A content analysis conducted by two registered dieticians
recommended that expenditures be recoded as well as regrouped into cat-
egories that more closely mirror the DGA categorization. Average expen-
ditures from the CE were assigned to individuals in the ATUS through
a matching based on three demographic variables: gender, income, and
family composition. These have all been linked as major predictors of
both food expenditures and time use patterns in addition to being corre-
lated to obesity (36). In addition, that combination of variables preserves
the most variability within the expenditure data. Hundreds of matches
were made. An example of the assignment methodology is as follows:
according to the CE, in 2007, the average weekly expenditure on chicken
for an adult single female headed household without children earning
less than $10,000 per year was $1.63. Each 2007 ATUS respondent who
was a single female head of household without children who earned less
than $10,000 per year was then assigned a weekly chicken expenditure of
$1.63. Similarly, the average value for all other food groups was assigned
to each category of income and household composition. This matching
method preserves individual data for demographic and time use vari-
ables in the ATUS data and assigns grouped data for food expenditures
in the CE. Table 1 presents characteristics of the 1,451 respondents in
the linked sample and each healthy and overweight cohort. Weight status
differs significantly across race, education, region of residence, income,
employment status, and self-reported health status. These relationships
are consistent with other research (27­30).
Next, expenditure shares for 28 food categories were calculated.
Initially, only the major DGA categories were used. These included
combined categories of animal and non-animal protein, dairy, fruits,
vegetables, carbohydrate, added fats, added sugars, and included the
additional categories of beverages, miscellaneous foods, fast food, and
full service food away from home. Early analysis revealed that regard-
less of income level and family composition, the share of expenditures
did not differ significantly across demographic groups. Therefore, DGA
categories were further disaggregated. Using the expertise of dietitians,
the DGA categories, and available expenditures in the CE data resulted
in expenditure shares that were diverse enough to show variation across
respondents, yet aggregated enough to allow interpretation within the
DGA guidelines.
The method of two-step cluster analysis using the log-likelihood
distance measure and Schwarz's Bayesian Criterion in the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences (SPSS 15.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL) was used to
identify food patterns. Cluster analysis is typically sensitive to the vari-
ables included in the clustering. In the case of food, all 30 of the DGA
food groups were included. There were no additions or deletions of vari-
ables that could influence the cluster results. Cluster analysis has been
used across disciplines to define distinct dietary patterns using both
food intake and expenditure data (8,37,38). When the relationships
among several variables are unknown and several variables may be con-
sidered dependent, cluster analysis can give an indication of complex
patterns within a dataset, not easily accomplished with economic, soci-
ological, or even social-ecological models, which tend to lead to regres-
sion type approaches to empirical analysis (14,39,40). Five patterns
clusters emerged; about average across food categories (AVERAGE;
23 percent), higher full-service food away from home (FULLFAFH; 31
percent), higher fast food away from home (FASTFOOD; 24 percent),
higher animal protein and beverages at home (PROTEIN; 11 percent),
and higher processed and prepared foods at home (PREPARED; 11
percent). Table 2 describes these clusters. The AVERAGE group has
about average expenditure shares when compared with the total sam-
ple. They do have higher shares for fresh fruits and vegetables and full

service food away from home, and a lower fast food share. The FULL-
FAFH cluster has the lowest shares allocated to sugars and sweets, fats
and oils, soda and juice. The PREPARED cluster appears to take time
saving routes to food purchasing. This cluster has the highest shares for
prepared foods, other meats (includes cold cuts) and eggs (quick cook-
ing protein), and the largest shares for sugars/sweets and fats/oils. The
PROTEIN cluster spends almost one-fifth of its food budget on animal
protein and five percent on soda and juice. The CE does not provide
a breakdown on the type of beverage beyond these, nor whether the
beverages are sugar sweetened or low calorie. The PROTEIN cluster
has among the lowest shares for sugars/sweets. The PREPARED food
cluster has the highest proportion of overweight respondents (70 per-
cent), followed by FASTFOOD (62 percent), PROTEIN (61 percent),
AVERAGE (60 percent) and FULLFAFH (47 percent). The percentage
of overweight respondents differs significantly across clusters, as do
expenditure shares on individual foods. On average, all clusters are
classified as overweight.
Next, time use patterns were examined. Household work, personal
care, caring for others, work hours, education hours, volunteer hours,
sleep, sleeplessness, physical activity, commuting time, socializing, non-
active leisure, and screen time were included in a cluster analysis, as
described above. As with the food groups, there were no additions or
deletions of time use in the cluster analysis that could lead to sensi-
tivity in the emerging clusters. Table 3 describes the five clusters that
emerged. Paid workers (WORKERS; 30 percent) spent over 8h per day
in paid employment. The most physically active cluster (ACTIVE; 6
percent) spent over 1h per day in physical activity, had the highest levels
of sleeplessness and the lowest percentage of overweight respondents (42
percent). Respondents who spent the most time in household activities
and caring for others, more than 3h per day (HHWORK; 30 percent),
also reported getting the most sleep (~6h), screen time, and time in
non-active leisure (more than 5h). SOCIALITE (11 percent) spent the
most time socializing (more than 3 hours) and reported the most time in
personal care activities. VOLUNTEERS (5 percent) spent the most time
in non-paid work, both in volunteering (more than 1.5h) and pursuing
education (almost 3h). Time uses differ significantly across clusters as
do the percentages of overweight respondents. On average, all clusters
are overweight.
Standard t-tests were run to examine differences in food-related time
uses and behaviors between healthy weight and overweight cohorts.
Data included: number of primary and secondary eating occasions, time
spent in secondary drinking (other than water), the primary cook in
the household, and time spent in meal preparation and clean-up. Sig-
nificant differences were found between healthy weight and overweight
individuals in time spent eating and drinking, total minutes per meal
and whether the respondent is the major cook in the household. Healthy
weight individuals report spending more time eating and drinking and a
larger percentage are the major cook for the household. Table 4 presents
these results.
Bivariate results presented in Tables 1­4 show that the percentage of
overweight respondents differs significantly across demographics and
eating and time use patterns, with fewer differences in time use related to
eating and drinking. Next, we regressed demographic, eating, and time
use pattern variables on both the probability of being overweight and on
BMI. The method of truncated regression is used. A variation of the Tobit
model, the probability of a non-limit outcome is determined separately
from the level of the non-limit outcome. When applied to a model of
overweight, the estimation of BMI is determined separately for healthy
weight and overweight individuals, given the probability of being over-
weight. Truncated regression allows the sign of individual coefficients
to differ in the estimation of the probabilities compared to the degree
of overweight, which is not possible in the Tobit regression model (for
details of the statistical approach, see refs. 41,42).
Three models are estimated. The dependent variables are the prob-
ability of being overweight (BMI 25), BMI for BMI 25 and BMI for
BMI >18 and <25. Results of the estimation includes the probability of
crossing the overweight threshold and the effect of the independent
variables on BMI for both healthy weight and overweight individuals.
Because the focus of this paper is on overweight, we omit the healthy
weight results. Independent variables include the food pattern and time
use clusters. Because these are 0/1 "dummy variables," we leave out the
HHWORK time use and AVERAGE food pattern cluster as the reference
group. While any group can be the reference group, we chose to use the
food pattern group closest to the sample average and the time use pattern
group with the most time in spent in the household. There was no "aver-
age" time use cluster. The HHWORK cluster represented 30 percent of the
total sample and had a percentage of overweight individuals that was clos-
est to the national average. We also included the individual food-related
time use variables: number of primary eating and drinking occasions,
number of secondary eating occasions, time spent in secondary drinking,
time spent in food preparation and clean-up, time spent in primary eating
and drinking, minutes per meal (every additional 10min per primary eat-
ing and drinking occasion), whether the respondent is the major cook in
the household and an interaction term between major cook and cooking/
clean-up time. The demographic variables age, race, education, income,
presence of children, region of residence, living in a metropolitan area,
and self-reported poor health status are also included.

Tables 5 and 6 present regression results. The last column of
Table 5 presents the marginal effect on the probability of being
overweight. Each marginal effect is interpreted, "holding all the
other included variables constant, the effect of (independent
variable x) increases/decreases the probability of being over-
weight by..." For example, holding all other included variables
constant, the effect of being Black on the sample as a whole
increases the probability of being overweight by 24 percent. The
model predicts the probability of being overweight correctly
in 80 percent of the cases. For individuals in the >35­40 age
group and the >40­45 age group, the probabilities of being
overweight compared to those age 50 and older are 0.08 and
0.09 probability points lower. Even in this limited age cohort,
the probability of being overweight increases with age. Being
black or of a race other than white increases the probability of
being overweight by 0.24 and 0.22 probability points, respec-
tively. Being Asian decreases the probability of overweight by
0.36 points. Compared to those living in the Northeast, the
Midwestern, Southern and Western residents all have higher
probabilities of being overweight. Those in poor health have a
probability of being overweight 0.19 points higher. Education
(reference group is high school graduate) and income (refer-
ence group is <135 percent of poverty level), are insignificant.
Ceteris Paribus, income has no effect on the probability of
being overweight.

The probability of the full service restaurant pattern
(FULLFAFH) cluster being overweight that is 0.10 points
lower than the AVERAGE group. The time use cluster that
spends more time in education and volunteer activities
(VOLUNTEER) has a probability of being overweight that
is 0.12 points lower compared with the reference HHWORK
group. And, while, individual eating behaviors are not signifi-
cant in predicting the probability of being overweight, their
influence becomes apparent when the level of BMI is pre-
dicted, given an individual has crossed the overweight thresh-
old, as seen below.
Table 6 presents results of the truncated regression esti-
mates that predict BMI for overweight individuals. The coef-
ficients are interpreted, "what is the incremental effect on BMI
of each individual independent variable, given an individual
has a BMI greater than 25 and less than 50?" Demographic
variables and time use and food patterns significantly impact
BMI. While the probability estimates showed that individuals
in the >35­40 and >40­45 age groups had a lower probabil-
ity of being overweight compared to those of >45­50 years of
age, if overweight, their BMI is predicted to be 4.85 and 7.59
points higher than the oldest group. While all of the included
racial groups, compared to whites, were significant in predict-
ing the probability of overweight, only blacks have a signifi-
cantly higher BMI once they are overweight, increasing BMI
by 7.74 points. Education was insignificant in predicting the
probability of being overweight. If an individual is overweight,
individuals with some college education have a predicted BMI
7.34 points higher compared to having completed high school.
Poor health was significant in predicting the probability of
being overweight. It increases BMI 9.10 points for an over-
weight individual. While income was insignificant in predict-
ing the probability of overweight, individuals with incomes
>135% and 185% of the federal poverty level had a predicted

BMI 5.06 points lower than individuals earning incomes less
than 135% of poverty.
Individual time uses related to food were insignificant in
predicting the probability of being overweight. However, once
an individual crosses the overweight threshold, these time uses
are significant in predicting BMI. Each additional reported pri-
mary eating occasion increases BMI by 3.96 points. For every
additional 10min spent in secondary drinking, predicted BMI
increases by 0.55 points. Interpreting the effects of being the
primary cook and time spent in food preparation and clean-up
is more complicated because of the included interaction effect.

Behavior and Psychology
Isolating the effect of being the primary cook is calculated as:
-1.03 primary cook + (0.05 primary cook × food preparation
and clean-up) ÷ 0.08 food preparation and clean-up.
Being the primary cook decreases BMI 1.72 points for over-
weight individuals. Isolating the effect of food preparation and
clean-up time reveals that an additional 10min spent cooking
and cleaning-up decreases BMI by 0.13 points.
Two food pattern clusters are significant in predicting BMI
for overweight individuals. Those in the full service food away
from home cluster (FULLFAFH) have a predicted BMI 6.60
points lower than those in the AVERAGE cluster. Individuals in
the higher protein (PROTEIN) at home cluster have a predicted
BMI 7.05 points lower compared with the AVERAGE cluster.
Three time use clusters are significant. Given an individual
is overweight, those classified as having the most time spent
in social activities (SOCIALIATE), have a predicted BMI 5.88
points higher. Those classified as spending most time in vol-
unteer activities (VOLUNTEER) have a predicted BMI 2.27
points lower compared to the HHWORK cluster. And, the
ACTIVE cluster has a predicted BMI 10.70 points lower com-
pared to the HHWORK cluster.
Discussion
This research adds to the literature in several ways. Three
population-based data sets are linked to obtain a richer set of
variables for which to analyze the factors that contribute to the
probability of being overweight and BMI for both overweight
and healthy weight individuals. This study shows the impor-
tance of isolating the effect of these factors on the probability
of being overweight separate from their effects on BMI once
the individual becomes overweight.
Forsingleheadedfemalehouseholdsbetweentheagesof31and
50, variables that impact the probability of being overweight and
variables that predict BMI for overweight individuals differ in
significance, magnitude, and in some cases direction of effect.
Lifestyle pattern clusters of time use and food patterns impact
both the probability of being overweight and BMI. The impact of
individual food-related time uses shows that knowledge of cook-
ing and eating patterns affect the BMI of overweight individuals.
Increases in cooking time are associated with a decrease in BMI.
Previous literature links demographic characteristics
and obesity. When time use and eating pattern clusters are
accounted for, race and region of residence continue to be
significant predictors of the probability of being overweight.
People residing in the northeast have a lower probability of
being overweight and given they are overweight have a lower
BMI, except when compared to people living in the south. The
effect of income is not found to be as robust as other research
but this research controls for other variables (6,10,36). In our
limited age cohort, being older within the age range increases
BMI only for already overweight individuals. These results
stress the importance of maintaining a healthy weight in early
adulthood. H1 is partially supported, and the effect of demo-
graphic variables depends on whether the dependent variable
is the prediction of the probability of overweight or the predic-
tion of BMI once the overweight threshold is passed.
Results also show that for overweight individuals, more pri-
mary eating and drinking occasions and time spent in second-
ary drinking increase BMI. While results for the truncated
regression to estimate BMI for healthy weight individuals are
not presented in this paper, more drinking occasions are asso-
ciated with a decrease in BMI and number of primary eating
occasions has no impact on BMI. This study is one of the first,
in a multivariate analysis, to show that cooking at home has a
mitigating effect on BMI for overweight individuals. Results
corroborate the idea that a resurgence of home economics type
classes within school curriculum and community cooking
skills interventions might serve a useful purpose (43).
Our results also show that a lifestyle that includes larger budget
sharesallocatedtofull-servicerestaurants(FULLFAFH)isassoci-
atedwithalowerprobabilityofbeingoverweightandalowerBMI
for the overweight sample compared to the AVERAGE cluster.
LookingacrossexpendituresharesinTable2,theAVERAGEclus-
ter spends "about" the average on most food categories, including
food away from home, while the FULLFAFH group spends less
on several at home categories, including protein (looking across
meats, eggs, and nuts), dairy, breads, cereals, sugars and sweets,
fats and oils, and soda and juice. Further research is necessary to
investigatewhetherthosewhospendalargershareoftheirbudget
on full-service food away from home substitute more expen-
sive, lower in overall calorie foods for food at home and have a
lower overall calorie intake compared to the AVERAGE cluster
which has average shares on most food categories and higher
than average shares on full-service food away from home. The
higher protein (PROTEIN) overweight cluster also has signifi-
cantly lower BMIs compared to the AVERAGE cluster. Looking
at other shares in the PROTEIN group reveals that this cluster
has the lowest expenditure shares for both fast and full-service
food away from home. Further research is needed to investigate
whether the FULLFAFH cluster substitutes restaurant meals for
food at home and the PROTEIN cluster substitutes food at home
for restaurant meals, while the AVERAGE cluster eats both at
and away from home. For the overweight sample, being in the
fast food cluster (FASTFOOD) has no effect on BMI. Therefore,
this study does not show that being classified in a cluster with
higher than average food away from home shares is associated
with a higher probability of being overweight or a higher BMI if
overweight, as has been suggested, though not overwhelmingly
supported, in some of the literature (12,15,44­46). It appears that
food away from home must be interpreted within overall dietary
patterns. H2 cannot be supported by this analysis.
This study also shows that certain time use patterns are asso-
ciated with being overweight and BMI level. Belonging to the
cluster that spent the most time in educational and volunteer
activities decreased the probability of being overweight by
0.12 probability points, but had no significant effect on BMI
for overweight individuals. On the other hand, while spending
more time in the labor market (WORKERS), in physical activ-
ity (ACTIVES), or socializing (SOCIALITE) did not signifi-
cantly impact the probability of being overweight, individuals
in these clusters had predicted BMIs 4.47 lower, 10.70 lower,
and 5.88 points higher compared to the HHWORK cluster. The

SOCIALITE clusters had the lowest levels of physical activity
of all clusters, and spent the most time traveling and in per-
sonal care activities. While total calorie expenditure for travel
can vary if an individual actively commutes either by walking
or by using a bicycle, research shows less than 4 percent of
the US population uses these transportation modes (47). The
SOCIALITE cluster is sedentary compared to the other clus-
ters. The ACTIVE group has the lowest predicted BMI in the
overweight group. H3 and H4, both having to do with energy
expenditure, are supported for overweight persons.
Overall, considering time use and food expenditure pat-
terns in the context of a household health production model
adds to the understanding of the impact of time use and food
expenditure patterns, in addition to the importance of demo-
graphic characteristics on obesity. The results provide insight
into the complex array of factors that are associated with obes-
ity and points to both target groups and obesity prevention
programs. For example, blacks and minorities in the "other"
group (including Hispanics) remain a priority target group for
obesity prevention. Policies in the workplace should encour-
age both places and time for physical activity. Alternatives to
screen time and non-active leisure alternatives must continue
to be developed and marketed, especially to people who spend
much of their time at home caring for others. The obesity epi-
demic is complex; a combination of variables jointly contribute
to the probability of being overweight and to BMI.
There are limitations to this study. First, we have tested our
approach on one cohort of individuals: single female headed
households aged 31­50 years. The analysis should be repli-
cated on other cohorts. Second, only two of the datasets used
are linked by individual. More complete, nationally represented
datasets are needed. Third, food expenditures do not mean
the same thing as food intake. Future research should inves-
tigate the possibility of linking the ATUS with the National
Health and Examination Survey. However, 2007­2008 National
Health and Examination Survey data are still not fully avail-
able. Fourth, in order to handle the complexity of the data,
many of the included variables are proxy measures. For exam-
ple, the composite SOCIALITE cluster gives an indication of
a variety of sedentary lifestyle behaviors and that individuals
in this cluster who are already overweight may be engaging in
more energy intake and less energy output when participating
in their social activities. Future studies should build on this
research, and investigate more complexities in lifestyle patterns,
including examining interaction effects between time use and
food expenditure patterns.
When obesity is viewed within a model of health production,
the results corroborate what has been found in the hundreds of
focused studies related to the causes of obesity, and add to the
literature by identifying the impact of individual variables hold-
ing the effect of others constant. Such comprehensive analysis
should be replicated using other demographic profiles, including
family types, ages, and gender of household head. Other datasets
should be explored, and interactions between food and time use
patterns should be explored. Overall, this study motivates fur-
ther studies at both the focused and complex levels.
