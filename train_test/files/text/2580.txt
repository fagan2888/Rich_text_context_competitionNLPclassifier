ABSTRACT
Background It is unclear whether the increase in life
expectancy (LE) globally is coupled with a postponement
of morbidity and disability. Evidence on trends and
determinants of disability-free life expectancies (DFLEs)
are available in high-income countries but less in low
and middle-income countries (LMICs). This study
examines the levels of and inequalities in LE, disability
and DFLE between men and women across different age
groups aged 50 years and over in six countries with
developing economies.
Methods This study utilised the cross-sectional data
(n=32 724) from the WHO Study on global AGEing and
adult health (SAGE) in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the
Russian Federation and South Africa in 2007­2010.
Disability was measured with the activity of daily living
(ADL) instrument. The DFLE was estimated using the
Sullivan method based on the standard period life table
and ADL-disability proportions.
Results The disability prevalence ranged from 13% in
China to 54% in India. The prevalence of disability was
highest and occurred at younger age in both sexes in
India. Women were more disadvantaged with higher
prevalence of disability across all age groups, and the
situation was worst among older women in Mexico and
the Russian Federation. Though women had higher LE,
their proportion of remaining LE free from disability was
lower than men.
Conclusions There are inequalities in the levels of
disability and DFLE among men and women in different
age groups among people aged over 50 years in these
six countries. Countermeasures to decrease intercountry
and gender gaps in DFLE, including improvements in
health promotion and healthcare distribution, with a
gender equity focus, are needed.
INTRODUCTION
Life expectancies (LEs) are increasing rapidly in low
and middle income countries (LMICs), but the evi-
dence on whether the additional years gained are
coupled with a healthier life and a reduced period
of morbidity (known as the `compression of morbid-
ity') is conflicting.1 The proportion of the world's
population aged 65 or older is projected to double
from 8% in 2010 to 16% by 2050, representing a
population of about 1.5 billion people.2 By the year
2025, 70% of the world's older population will be
living in LMICs. Intertwined with these demo-
graphic changes is the epidemiological transition of
diseases, where the primary causes of disability, mor-
bidity and mortality shift from communicable dis-
eases (CDs) to chronic non-communicable diseases
(NCDs). Health systems in LMICs are
fundamentally unprepared for tackling the chronic
disease challenges since they have been set up in a
period when CDs were dominant.3 The increasing
NCD burden puts older adults and elderly and their
households at the risk of catastrophic health expen-
ditures and impoverishments. In LMICs,
out-of-pocket payments for healthcare services are
predominant, and existing formal social protection
systems cover only a small proportion of their
ageing population.4 Thus, people in LMICs arrive at
old age in poorer shape and with fewer reserves.
During the last decade, a large body of literature
focused on trends and determinants for the
unequal distribution of healthy life years (HLYs)
and the disability-free life expectancy (DFLE)
among older people in several European countries
and North America.5 6 The results consistently
show improvements in the overall quality of HLYs
of older people in these high-income settings,
though inequalities in DFLE between population
subgroups remain. However, there is a paucity of
evidence from studies on healthy ageing conducted
in LMICs.7­12 A study based on the INDEPTH
WHO-SAGE data revealed how different socio-
economic indicators such as education, marital
status, living arrangement and household socio-
economic status influence health inequality
observed between men and women in eight coun-
tries in Africa and Asia.7 Studies in Brazil and
Mexico link inequalities in DFLE to the prevalence
of NCDs.8­10 In Mexico, a nearly 10-year gap in
DFLE between diabetics and non-diabetics exists.11
Another study from Brazil shows that women
receive more years of personal assistance but also
experience more unmet care needs compared with
men.9 A study in China showed evidence for a
compression of morbidity among people aged 65
and over during 1992­2002 but not among the
younger age groups.12 Most of those studies,
except the study by Ng et al,7 used different instru-
ments to measure disability at individual level. The
heterogeneity in disability measurement limits the
availability of cross-country comparative data.
The objectives of this study are to describe the
levels of and inequalities in LE, disability and
DFLE between men and women across different
age groups 50 years and over in six countries with
developing economies. We utilise data from the
WHO Study on global AGEing and adult health
(WHO-SAGE), which was collected using standar-
dised instrument in six countries, representing four
different world regions. These countries are also at
different stages of the demographic, economic and
epidemiological transition.

METHODS
Study design and participants
The current cross-sectional study is based on the first wave data
of the WHO-SAGE. The WHO-SAGE is designed as a longitu-
dinal study with the first wave data collection conducted among
people aged 50 and over in China, Ghana, India, Mexico, the
Russian Federation and South Africa during 2007­2010. A total
of 34 138 individuals aged 50 and over participated in this first
wave.
Data collection methods
In all countries, multistage cluster sampling was used to select
nationally representative households. All individuals aged 50
and over in the households were invited and data were collected
through face-to-face interviews conducted by trained staff. The
combination of computer-assisted personal interview (CAPI)
and paper and pencil was used. Details about the sampling pro-
cedure and data collection have been described elsewhere.13
Instruments
Standardised instruments, containing individual and household
questionnaires, were used in all six countries. The demographic
(age and sex) and basic activities of daily living (ADLs) data
were derived from the individual questionnaire. We used six
questions on ADL to estimate disability prevalence. The ques-
tions asked how much difficulty the respondents had in the last
30 days in (1) walking a long distance, (2) bathing or washing
the whole body, (3) dressing, (4) transferring through a room,
(5) eating food and (6) getting to and using the toilet. The
response was recorded in five categories ranging from no diffi-
culty, mild, moderate, severe and extreme difficulty. Responses
to each of these questions were dichotomised into `no disability'
(no difficulty and mild difficulty--coded as 0) and `with disabil-
ity' (moderate, severe and extreme difficulty--coded as 1).
A total score of ADL was later calculated as the sum of
responses to the six questions (range 0­6). On the basis of the
total ADL, individuals were defined `with disability' (total score
1­6) and have `full function' (total score 0).
Statistical analysis
About 4% of the respondents with missing data in any of the
variables included in this study were excluded from the analysis;
hence, the complete case analysis included 32 770 respondents.
We calculated the DFLE for men and women in each country
using the Sullivan method. The Sullivan method, established in
1971,14 is one of the most common methods used to estimate
DFLE.15 DFLE is defined as the mean length of time that indivi-
duals can expect to live free of disability if current health condi-
tions continue to apply. Two key indicators were used in the
DFLE calculation, that is, the standard period life table and the
age-specific prevalence of disability. The life table was estimated
using age-specific and sex-specific mortality information
obtained from 2010 WHO Global Burden of Disease.16
We estimated the prevalence of disability, based on the ADL
scale, for each age group (50­54, 55­59, ..., and 80+ years)
stratified by sex. We weighted the survey data using country-
specific weights to adjust for different age­sex distributions in
each country. The person-years of the life table for each age
group were multiplied by the age-specific prevalence of disabil-
ity. The analyses resulted in the total number of remaining life
years (total life expectancy, TLE), differentiated into the years
lived with (life expectancy with disability, LED) and without dis-
ability (DFLE). Finally, we estimated the difference in LE and
DFLE between men and women. All analyses were conducted in
Stata V
.13 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas, USA, 2014).
ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS
The WHO headquarters in Geneva granted access to the
WHO-SAGE dataset, which is available in public domain.
All participants provided informed consents prior to the study.
RESULTS
The sample size ranged from 2140 individuals in Mexico to
12 784 individuals in China. There were more women in all
countries (overall: 51.7% women, 48.3% men), except in Ghana
(47.3% women) and India (48.1% women). About 53% of the
respondents were aged 60 and over and 5% were 80 years and
over, ranging from 4.2% in China and India to 7.5% in the
Russian Federation (see online supplementary appendix 1).
Prevalence of disability
Overall, 26.5% of respondents (21.6% men, 31.3% women)
reported moderate or severe difficulty in performing any of the
ADLs in the last 30 days (table 1). The disability prevalence
ranged from 13.5% in China to 54.1% in India. Women consist-
ently reported more disability compared with men in all coun-
tries (up to 1.8 times in the Russian Federation). More
respondents (29% women, 19% men) reported difficulty in
walking long distance compared to other domains where <5%
of men and 7% of women reported difficulty. Indian men and
women reported higher prevalence of disability in most domains.
Some exceptions included that more Russian and Mexican
women reported difficulties in bathing/washing and dressing,
respectively, and more Mexican, South African and Ghanaian
men had problem with dressing, moving inside the home and toi-
leting, respectively. As expected, the prevalence of disability
increased among population at older age groups as shown in
table 2.
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of disability by sex and age
group for each country. The prevalence of disability was higher
among women (dashed lines, grey bars in figure 1) than men
across all age groups. The prevalence was also higher among
older age groups, consistently in all countries, except for men
aged 85 and over in the Russian Federation and South Africa.
India had the highest prevalence of disability among young age
groups (55% of Indian women aged 50­54 years reported dis-
ability). The prevalence was over 80% among Indian women
aged 75­79 years (vs only about 40% in their Chinese counter-
parts). The gender gaps in prevalence of disability were smallest
in China and largest in Ghana. The gender gaps were constant
across age groups in China and Ghana. On the contrary, the
gender differences were wider among older people in Mexico
and the Russian Federation and narrower in India and South
Africa.
Gender differences in LE and DFLE
The highest LE at age 50 (LE-50) was observed in Mexico
(men: 27 years; women: 29.1 years), while the lowest was
among South African women (23.3 years) and Ghanaian,
Russian and South African men (20 years) (see online supple-
mentary appendices 2 and 3). The proportion of LE lived
without disability (the grey part of the bars) indicated that
Chinese were the healthiest and Indians were the least healthy
(figure 2). Chinese men and women spent 87% and 81% of
their remaining LE-50 without disability, respectively, compared
with only 53% and 34% among Indian men and women.
Ghanaian, Indian and Mexican women aged 85 and over spent

Research report
<20% of their remaining LE-50 without disability. The corre-
sponding numbers among men aged 85 and over ranged from
15% in India to 54% in China.
Women enjoyed a longer LE than men, with higher LE-50
compared with men (from 8% higher in Mexico to 40% in the
Russian Federation). The female advantage was observed stead-
ily across all age groups, though it declined at the older age
groups (black bars in figure 3). Yet, women experienced a less
healthy life than men. The proportion of women's remaining
LE without disability was less compared with men (grey bars in
figure 3). The gender gap in the proportion of DFLE was smal-
lest in China and South Africa. This disadvantaged phenomenon
was, however, markedly observed among women aged 85 and
over in Mexico and the Russian Federation, and women aged
75­84 years in Ghana.
DISCUSSIONS
This study expands the current literature on DFLE by using
recent nationally representative and comparable data from six
LMICs. The main findings of the current study are: (1) the
prevalence of disability was highest in both sexes in India, and it
occurred at a younger age; (2) women were more disadvantaged
with higher prevalence of disability across all age groups, and
the situation was worst among older women in Mexico and the
Russian Federation and (3) though women had higher LE, their
proportion of remaining LE without disability was lower com-
pared with men.
Intercountry differences in the level of disability
The observed country differences in the prevalence of disability
in this study might reflect the differential chronic disease

burdens and their risk factors. Chronic diseases tend to lead to
chronic-disabling conditions.8 17 18 The proportions of total
musculoskeletal disease-related years lived with disability
(YLDs), one of the leading causes of disability, in the six SAGE
countries range from 12% (India) to 19% (the Russian
Federation). Chronic obstructive pulmonary diseases (COPDs)
accounted for 9­11% of total YLDs in Ghana and South Africa.
Mexico had a large burden of diabetes-related morbidity and
mortality,16 which was the highest among the six SAGE coun-
tries.19 In India, where the disability was highest in our study,
having multiple chronic illnesses, including hypertension, vision
and hearing deficits, arthritis, depression, COPD, angina, dia-
betes and stroke, was significantly associated with disability
among population aged 50 and over.17
Many of the NCD risk factors predict the onset of disability
among older adults. Physical inactivity is predictive of shorter
active LE and a longer period of disability prior to death in old
age. Alcohol consumption is strongly associated with cognitive
and physical disabilities.20 Smoking, on the contrary, is more
strongly associated with fatal diseases and a relatively short
period of disablement.21 Overweight and obesity predict func-
tional decline and physical disability, such as osteoarthritis and
chronic back pain.21 Compared to smoking and alcohol con-
sumption, obesity is more strongly associated with an increased
risk of more YLDs at age 55.22 Data from the same
WHO-SAGE population show that over 70% of Chinese and
90% of South African older adults had two or more NCD risk
factors, including daily tobacco use, alcohol use, physical
inactivity and obesity.23
These intercountry differences could also reflect the differences
in socioeconomic and contextual factors across countries. Even
there are intracounty differences observed across different popula-
tion groups. Studies in Britain and Canada identified strong
regional variability in DFLE.24 25 In Canada, the highest DFLEs
were found in highly populated urban areas, while the lowest
DFLEs were commonly found in remote rural regions.25 In the
UK, there was an increasing clustering of inequalities in DFLE in
deprived areas compared with affluent areas.24 Inequalities in
DFLE are also driven by socioeconomic status.24­27 Educational
inequalities favouring the higher educated have been identified
among European pensioners before and after the retirement and
among Belgian men and women.6 26 Other social determinants
such as illiteracy, smoking and unemployment are strongly asso-
ciated with variations in DFLE in Spain.27
Gender inequality in disability and LE
Our study confirms the existence of gender inequality in disabil-
ity and LE as observed elsewhere.28­31 We show that women
have longer LE but proportionally less years of DFLE than men
as shown in other studies.32­35 The gender inequalities in DFLE
were more evident in India, Ghana, Mexico and the Russian
Federation. The similar observations, putting women as the dis-
advantaged sex, have also been reported in 25 countries in the
EU region,32 the UK,33 Japan34 and Bangladesh.35
Women had higher prevalence of non-fatal chronic conditions
compared with men who are more likely to die from more fatal
diseases before being disabled due to disease. The differences
could be attributed to the biological and social determinants of
healthy ageing.36 In many LMICs, women tend to have higher
rates of sedentary behaviour, hence lower muscle strength and
bone density and higher proportion of body fat. They might
also have restricted access to nutritional food and healthcare
facilities. Consequently, women may accumulate more disability
throughout the life course. On the other hand, younger men
could suffer more disability than younger women, as they were
more prone to be exposed to economic and social instability,

high rates of tobacco and alcohol consumption, poor nutrition
and depression, as observed in the Russian Federation.37
Exclusion from access to resources that enhance human
development from childhood up to old age and that enrich lives
at different ages is the major basis of inequality across popula-
tion groups.38

Cultural context of disability
The meaning of ageing is less biologically dependent but more
socioculturally constructed. The differences in the perception
and evaluation of age and ageing vary considerably across cul-
tures,39 hence, the ageing process might not progress uniformly
across populations. Eastern/Asian cultures--being based on
Confucian values, ancestor worship and filial piety--employ
more positive views on ageing compared to Western societies,
which are thought to be more youth oriented and thus holding
more negative notions towards the ageing process and elderly.
Changes in functioning could therefore reflect changes in indivi-
duals' expectations of disability and use of equipment, rather
than changes in their underlying disabilities.
Strengths and limitations of the study
This study is one of the first studies with a cross-country DFLE
comparison using a standardised instrument. The national repre-
sentative sample in the WHO-SAGE ensures the generalisability
of the findings to the population in each country. Stringent
research protocol employed in the study ensured that translation
of questionnaire from English to local or national language in
participating countries achieved equivalence across settings.13
The large dataset with relatively low proportion of missing data
ensures sufficient sample size to obtain robust statistics, espe-
cially among the oldest age group above 80 years. The use of
Sullivan method, recommended for its simplicity, relative accur-
acy and ease of interpretation, produces comparable results
across the six countries.40
Several limitations in this study warrant careful interpretation
of the results. The WHO-SAGE surveyed only
community-dwelling older adults and not institutionalised older
adults; hence, we might have underestimated the true preva-
lence of disability. The prevalence of disability might also be
influenced by acute short-lasting illness that could not be con-
trolled for in the analysis. On the contrary, the more conserva-
tive definition of disability in this study might be sensitive
enough in revealing its true prevalence. The data do not allow
us to assess a non-returnable state assumption, whether people
recovered from their disability situation or not. It is therefore
not possible to examine the transitional probabilities across dif-
ferent functional states, and how the disability transition rates
and level vary by age and sex. As with many studies which were
based on self-reported questionnaire, the comparability of cross-
country findings in this study might be hampered by differential
health reporting related to different experiences and expectation
about health by different population groups within and between
countries.41 Though anchoring vignette approach has been
introduced to handle these reporting differences in cross-
country studies,42 43 the applicability of this method in some
settings has been limited.44 45 Biological markers collected in
the second wave of SAGE could shed light on the validity of
these self-reported questionnaires in measuring health and dis-
ability across different population groups.46
Public health policy implications
Our study raises several policy implications concerning the import-
ance of monitoring health trends through the DFLE indicator.
Further investigations on how social determinants of health and
lifestyle risk factors might influence the disability states in different
countries are needed to understand the complexity of disability
problems among older people. Though the health of older women
is a critically important issue, the feminisation of ageing phenom-
enon is policy-wise a less acknowledged field. Without challenging
policies related to welfare, pensions, families and migration that
emanate from the interests and experiences in more developed
countries, the gendering of old-age experiences we see in the
present global context may not change to any great extent.47 The
contextual differences in how the process of ageing is experienced
need to be considered by decision-makers, when designing gender-
responsive policies and programmes for ageing women. Further,
ensuring universal healthcare and strengthening the health system
to address the emerging burden of NCDs and the intersection of
NCDs with other diseases among women using a life course per-
spective are among the essential steps to promote healthy ageing
among women.48
CONCLUSIONS
There are significant inequalities in the levels of disability and
DFLE among men and women, and these inequalities are also
observed across different age groups over 50 years in the six
SAGE countries. Countermeasures to decrease intercountry and
between-gender differences in DFLE, including accelerating eco-
nomic development and improving health promotion and
healthcare distribution, with a gender equity focus, are needed.
What is already known on this subject
Life expectancy has increased unprecedentedly in low-and-
middle income countries in the last few decades. Yet, adding
extra years to life does not always mean that the additional
years are disability free.
What this study adds
Gender differences in LE and DFLE exist across different age
groups over 50 years in LMICs. Though women had a higher life
expectancy, they also had worse health conditions compared
with men. Therefore, policy actions aiming to reduce the burden
of disability and maximise DFLE for older populations must be a
priority in promoting healthy ageing. It is also vital to address
the social and biological determinants of healthy ageing in
LMICs applying a strong gender equity focus.
