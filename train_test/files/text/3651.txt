Background
On May 10, 2011, the Australian government announced
new funding commitments of A$419.7 million for two
major youth mental health programs: Early Psychosis
Prevention and Intervention Centres (EPPIC) and
Headspace. EPPIC is an integrated mental health service
aimed at youth aged 15 to 24 years with a first episode of
psychosis. Headspace comprises one-stop early treatment
centers aimed at improving youth mental health and pro-
viding drug and alcohol, employment, and other integrated
social services (Commonwealth of Australia, 2011;
Headspace, 2011; Muir et al., 2009; Russell, 2011). These
reforms were promoted as "the centerpiece" of the federal
Labor government's mental health commitments by the
then Prime Minister Julia Gillard (Australian Associated
Press, 2011b). In this article, we examine the events leading
up to the 2011 budget to identify the reasons why early
intervention services for youth were adopted. Our aim is to
increase the awareness of both mental health policy makers
and researchers of the socio-political dynamics that affect
the uptake of research findings by governments.
Conceptual Framework
John Kingdon's (2003) multiple streams framework provides
one way of understanding how and why early intervention
mental health services for youth rose to the top of a crowded
health policy agenda. This approach to understanding the
agenda-setting phase of the policy process has been used

Agenda?

Abstract
The 2011 Australian federal budget included a large investment in youth mental health and early intervention services. In
this article, we focus on the critical role of agenda setting in the preceding 4 years to examine how and why these services
were given such a high priority at this time. We undertook a systematic review of relevant literature, including parliamentary
Hansard transcripts from the House of Representatives and Senate, the final reports of all available parliamentary committees,
government policy documents, other pertinent documents held by the Commonwealth Department of Health and Aging,
and media reports from five widely circulated Australian publications/news outlets. We used Kingdon's multiple streams
framework to structure analysis. We highlight three factors that were influential in getting youth mental health issues onto
the policy agenda: (a) the strategic use of quantitative evidence to create a publicly visible "problem," (b) the marshalling of
the "public" to create pressure on government, and (c) the role of serendipity. Overall, we found the decision to prioritize
youth mental health resulted from a combination of advocacy for a well-articulated policy solution by high-profile, influential
policy entrepreneurs, and political pressure caused by an up swell of national support for mental health reform. Our findings
highlight the socio-political factors that influence agenda setting and health policy formulation. They raise important ethical
and strategic issues in utilizing research evidence to change policy.

extensively in the analysis of health and social policy
(Battams & Baum, 2010; Craig, Felix, Walker, & Phillips,
2010; Guldbrandsson & Fossum, 2009; Kruger, 2001;
Lancaster, Ritter, & Colebatch, 2014; Laraway & Jennings,
2002; Lenton, 2008; Sharma, 2008).
Kingdon (2003) conceptualized the agenda-setting phase of
the policy process as comprising three streams: problems, poli-
cies, and politics (see Figure 1). Each stream contains its own
processes and actors and operates independently of the others
according to its own set of rules and dynamics. Kingdon argued
that, at certain times, the actions of advocates, or policy entre-
preneurs, can lead to the coupling of these three streams to open
a "policy window" that leads to action in the form of policy
change (Craig et al., 2010; Felix, 2007; Kingdon, 2003). More
recent iterations of the multiple streams approach have relaxed
the condition that the streams are independent and argued that
this approach is best viewed as a conceptual device to help the
analyst identify the elements that contribute to policy "rational-
ity" (Zahariadis, 1999). A summary of key concepts that under-
pin a multiple streams analysis is outlined below.
Problems
The problem stream encapsulates any problems that could
come to hold decision makers' attention. At any one time,
there are many potential problems that decision makers
could address but, for a small subset of these, there will be a
growing belief that something can and should be done.
Possible reasons for the ascendency of such a belief include
a focusing event such as a crisis or disaster, publication of
numeric or other indicators that suggest a worsening of the
problem, or feedback that an existing policy or program is
not working (Kingdon, 2003).
Policy Solutions
Kingdon conceptualizes potential policy proposals or "solu-
tions" as undergoing development, recombination, discussion,
and debate within a policy community comprising a usually
small group of influential people inside and outside of govern-
ment. This process yields a limited number of technically fea-
sible, and/or affordable policy contenders. These need to be
frequently advocated and discussed within the policy commu-
nity if they are to gain traction. Kingdon argues that consensus
on a policy contender can facilitate its diffusion. Furthermore,
he suggests that a "problem" is more likely to rise to the top of
the policy agenda if a well-defined, widely accepted policy
solution is known to exist (Kingdon, 2003, p. 117).
Political Context
The political stream is an entity that comprises elements such
as: public mood, pressure group campaigns, election results/
changes of government, and ideological divides within and
between the major political parties. For a policy solution to
be seriously considered, it must be politically palatable for
the government of the day.
Policy Entrepreneurs
Policy entrepreneurs are individuals who invest time and
resources in seizing opportunities where change is more
likely and push for their particular policy solution to a per-
ceived problem in the political sphere. Policy entrepreneurs
are important actors in coupling a problem with a policy
solution so as to facilitate its political adoption that results in
policy change.
Policy Windows
Policy windows are the final major element of Kingdon's
framework. They are defined as opportunities that make deci-
sions and action more likely. Policy windows can open expect-
edly (with a change in government and federal budgets) or
unexpectedly (as a result of a pressing problem or disaster, or
by a shift in national mood that makes government action seem
imperative; Kingdon, 2003). Windows are often open for a
short period of time, so policy entrepreneurs must be ready
with their problem well-defined and framed, an acceptable
policy solution to that problem and have political support for
the solution.An opportunity may quickly pass if it is not seized.
Method
Data Collection
Our analysis is based on a two-stage literature review of key
texts in the public domain. First, relevant documents were
collected from the following sources: (a) transcripts of par-
liamentary proceedings (recorded in Hansard) from the
Australian House of Representatives and Senate, (b) the final
reports of all available Australian government parliamentary
committees, (c) Australian government policy documents,

Whiteford et al. 3
and (d) other pertinent documents held by the Commonwealth
Department of Health. We also reviewed media reports from
five widely circulated Australian publications/news outlets:
The Australian, the Sydney Morning Herald, The Age, The
Canberra Times, and Australia's ABC network.
Parliamentary records were searched for the period May
10, 2010, to June 10, 2011. This included 1-year prior and 1
month post 2011 budget. This date range was set both for
pragmatic reasons, because of the large amount of data that
were collected and to isolate the political debate relating spe-
cifically to the 2011 budget. Other sources (media articles,
government documents, and the final reports of parliamen-
tary committees) were examined across a wider period
(January 1, 2008-June 10, 2011) to capture longer term
trends.
Texts were included in our study if they explicitly men-
tioned "youth mental health services," Headspace or EPPIC,
or "early intervention services." While early intervention for
mental health is applicable across the lifespan, in this par-
ticular context, "early intervention" was often used in con-
junction with youth mental health. Prominent or repeated
mentions of media coverage and constituent concerns by
politicians in Hansard were also identified and the articles
retrieved.
The second stage of review involved a search of academic
literature to refine findings drawn from primary sources and
provide context. Electronic databases searched included
MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Embase (searched via Ovid),
Australian Public Affairs Full Text (APAFT), Humanities
and Social Sciences Collection, TV NewsArchive, Rural and
Remote Health Database,Australasian Medical Index (AMI),
Australian Public Affairs Information Service-Health
(APAIS-Health), Health Issues in Criminal Justice (CINCH-
Health), Health and Society Database, Health Collection,
and Media Scan (via Informit).
Using this search strategy, we identified 143 Hansard
transcripts, 110 media articles, 11 non­peer-reviewed publi-
cations (grey literature), and 20 peer-reviewed journal arti-
cles relevant to Australian youth mental health policy over
the period of interest.
Data Analysis
For the first step of analysis, we carried out a content analy-
sis of Hansard to provide a rough proxy measure of changes
in the importance of youth mental health on the political
agenda from 2007 to 2012. Mentions of the following key
words, mental health, youth mental health, headspace, and
EPPIC, were counted over the 4-year period and for the year
prior and afterward.
For the second stage of analysis, a deductive approach
was employed, using Kingdon's multiple streams frame-
work (Kingdon, 2003) as a means to operationalize/code
data. This approach was partly guided by the pragmatic need
to sort large volumes of data, which rendered an inductive,
grounded-theory approach (Strauss & Corbin, 1990) infea-
sible (J. Smith, Bekker, & Cheater, 2011).
All documents identified in the first and second stages of the
review process were reviewed and their contents categorized in
an Excel® spreadsheet template according to whether they
related to (a) policy problems, (b) policy solutions, and/or (c)
political issues, based on Kingdon's framework, as defined
above. "Problem" representations were further categorized as
indicators, feedback, or focusing events (Kingdon, 2003).
Using this method, the major problems, policy solutions,
and political events between January 2008 and the end of
May 2011, relating to youth mental health, were identified
and described. Finally, we drew conclusions about cause and
effect relationships between different spheres of influence
(i.e., different "streams").
Results
Change Over Time in Mention of (Youth) Mental
Health in Hansard
Mentions of mental health rose sharply in Hansard docu-
ments in 2010 and 2011. Youth-specific terms such as "youth
mental health," "EPPIC," and "Headspace" also increased
over the time in the lead up to the funding announcement in
2010-2011 (Figure 2).
Problems, Policy Solutions and Political Context in
Youth Mental Health
Key themes were found in all data sources relating to prob-
lems, policy solutions and political issues relevant to youth
mental health, the role of policy entrepreneurs and the char-
acter of the policy window. These are described below and
summarized in Table 1.

The Problem Stream
There were two ways in which the problem of youth mental
health was constructed in public and policy spheres:
Indicators that quantified the extent and burden of youth
mental health were used to highlight the seriousness of the
issue while evidence to suggest that youth were underserved
by existing mental health services promoted the need for spe-
cialized youth mental health services. Although there was no
single focusing event to spur action, advocates and the media
used statistical data to quantify the burden of youth mental
health and suicide and highlight the crisis of youth mental
health. However, there were constraints on how government
could act: natural disasters in 2010-2011 left a substantial
"clean-up" bill, and at the same time, the Labor government
was under sustained pressure from the Liberal dominated
coalition, in opposition, over its financial management.
Use of indicators.Hansard transcripts of speeches often
included data on the population prevalence of mental disor-
ders in youth (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Repre-
sentatives, 2010). For example, Hansard excerpts that framed
mental health and suicide as a problem of youth included
phrases like: "half of the Australians aged between 12 and 25
will experience a diagnosable episode of mental illness"
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2011, p. 2009), and "[suicide is] a leading cause of deaths
under 44" (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Represen-
tatives, 2010, p. 6346).
Media stories also focused on the burden of youth mental
illness reporting statistics that "75 percent of mental health
problems will appear by age 25" ("A Man on a Timely
Mission," 2010) and "one in three young Australians will
experience mental illness by their 25th birthday" (Australian
Associated Press, 2008). In addition, the media emphasized
the high level of youth need for mental health services (Jones,
2010; Marcus, 2008; McGorry, 2011a; Stark, 2008).
Indicators of persistently low levels of mental health ser-
vice utilization among young people were reported in the
2009 release of findings from the 2007 National Mental
Health and Wellbeing Survey (Slade, Johnston, Browne,
Andrews, & Whiteford, 2009). This issue was identified as a
major concern in Senate enquiries in 2008 (The Senate
Standing Committee on Community Affairs, 2008) and 2010
(The Senate Finance and Public Administration References
Committee, 2010). It also featured in parliamentary debate
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2011) and numerous academic articles (Boyd, Hayes, Wilson,
& Bearsley-Smith, 2008; Burgess et al., 2009; "Youth
Initiatives: Headspace--National Youth Mental Health
Foundation," 2008).
Economic losses from untreated mental illness, in general,
were also highlighted in parliamentary debate, the academic
literature, and the media. The cost to the economy of untreated
mental illness was estimated at A$30 billion in lost productiv-
ity and lost lives. Mental illness was identified as a major con-
tributor to unemployment and to long-term receipt of welfare
(Australian Associated Press, 2008; Butterworth, Burgess, &
Whiteford, 2011; Commonwealth of Australia: House of
Representatives, 2010; Commonwealth of Australia: Senate,
2010; Leach & Butterworth, 2012; McGorry, 2010a; Waghorn,
Table 1. Summary of the Elements in the Case Study Conforming to Kingdon's Multiple Streams Framework.
Major elements Description of major findings in the time period of interest
Problems Indicators: Prevalence and burden of mental illness in youth, including the economic burden on society,
low rates of service utilization by young people, not enough money being allocated to youth, not
enough money being allocated overall to mental health.
 (Perceived) feedback from existing systems: Stigma and barriers to treatment could not be overcome
by mainstream services, and fragmentation and lack of intersectoral linkages meant many will slip
through the gaps.
 Focusing event: Claims by high-profile professionals that the treatment of mental health is sub-standard
and should not be accepted; status quo will lead to a new "lost generation."
Policies Headspace and EPPIC--Well-advertised, pre-tested early intervention services aimed at youth were
announced to be ready for widespread implementation.
Politics Initial reluctance by government to prioritize mental health (including youth mental health) evolved
into strong bipartisan support for action as an election year progressed and a vocal, positive shift in
national mood/pressure groups became clear. Political turmoil within Labor ranks before the election
(culminating in a change in prime minister) and an opposition with a strong policy on certain youth
mental health services made it politically expedient to act.
Policy entrepreneurs High-profile mental health advocates, primarily represented in the public domain by Pat McGorry, Ian
Hickie, and John Mendoza engaged in continuous media and public criticism of the status quo and
lobbied both political parties for change.
The opening of a window The 2011 Australian federal budget represented a rational and predictable window for action to be
taken on mental health.

Chant, Lloyd, & Harris, 2011). At the same time, the federal
Labor government was under pressure to return the budget to
surplus following the 2008 global financial crisis
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010) so parliamentary debate focused on increasing youth
participation in employment or training and education by
investing in mental health services (Commonwealth of
Australia: House of Representatives, 2010).
Feedback from existing programs.In parliamentary debates
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010) and the media (Australian Associated Press, 2008),
mainstream mental health services were described as inap-
propriate for youth with emerging mental health problems.
Among the explanations offered for this situation were that
parents and mainstream mental health professionals often
mistook youth mental illness for a normal part of adoles-
cence (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representa-
tives, 2010; Stark, 2008), that overworked mainstream health
care professionals were not equipped to deal with youth
problems (Commonwealth of Australia: House of Represen-
tatives, 2011) and that negative first experiences of seeking
help discouraged further efforts to obtain assistance (Cohen,
Medlow, Kelk, & Hickie, 2009). Parliamentarians identified
the following major barriers to adequate services for young
mental health consumers: fragmentation of the mental health
sector, lack of collaboration and co-ordination, and poor
intersectoral linkages (Commonwealth of Australia: House
of Representatives, 2011).
The research literature identified multiple reasons why
young people did not seek help for their mental health. These
included poor mental health literacy among young people,
stigma, lack of awareness of the services available, lack of
youth-focused information on mental health and drug educa-
tion programs, and consumers not believing they needed
help or not believing that they would benefit from profes-
sional help (Cohen et al., 2009; Collin et al., 2011; Hampshire
& Di Nicola, 2011; Harris, Burgess, Pirkis, Slade, &
Whiteford, 2011; Henderson, Andrews, & Hall, 2009;
McCann & Lubman, 2012; Whiteford & Groves, 2009).
By contrast, parliamentarians identified the barriers to
youth help seeking as primarily geographical (e.g., lack of
access in rural and regional areas), financial (e.g., ability to
pay for services), and social (e.g., stigma of being labeled
mentally ill; Commonwealth of Australia: House of
Representatives, 2011). Parliamentarians agreed that these
barriers to youth access could not be overcome using exist-
ing mainstream health services (Commonwealth ofAustralia:
Senate, 2010). A 2008 Senate enquiry on mental health ser-
vices found that much of the 2006 Council of Australian
Governnments (COAG) National Action Plan funding had
been provided to generic services. It recommended a greater
focus on meeting the mental health care needs of specific
groups, especially youth (The Senate Standing Committee
on Community Affairs, 2008).
Focusing events and crises. There was no one crisis or event,
such as a mass shooting or high-profile suicide, which
focused attention on mental health during this time period, as
had stimulated earlier mental health reform initiatives (Whit-
eford, 2014; Meurk, Whiteford, Head, Hall, & Carah, 2015);
although there was a suicide "spike" in a major regional cen-
ter (Mackay, Queensland) reported in national television
media on Four Corners (McDermott, 2010) and mentioned
repeatedly in parliament as an example of the problem (Com-
monwealth of Australia: House of Representatives, 2010, p.
1864; Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representa-
tives, 2011, p. 119, p. 1316, p. 3008). Rather, the main issues
highlighted by mental health advocates to construct a visible
"crisis" in the public domain were statistics on the burden of
mental illness, poor service utilization by young people and
overall suicide rates. They argued through the media that
there was a moral imperative for government to urgently act
on youth mental health to prevent a generation being lost to
chronic illness or premature death.
Advocates argued that mental health suffered from a
social neglect that would be unacceptable in treatment of
physical conditions (Australian Associated Press, 2010a;
Hickie, 2010; McGorry, 2010c). For example, Professor Pat
McGorry was quoted as saying,
Failure to invest in early psychosis reform will result in another
lost generation of young Australians consigned to unnecessary
disability as well as premature death from suicide and
cardiovascular disease (Medew, 2010).
Media claims were repeated in parliamentary debates and
focused political and public attention on the tragedy of youth
mental illness and suicide (Commonwealth of Australia:
House of Representatives, 2010; Commonwealth of
Australia: House of Representatives, 2011).
Competing "problems." Governments often find it difficult to
prioritize spending on programs, such as early intervention
and preventative programs, where the benefits are arguably
long-term while the costs are immediate (Head & Redmond,
2011). The Labor government faced a number of political
and financial constraints on their capacity to invest in youth
mental health. These included large clean-up bills after
unprecedented natural disasters along much of Australia's
east coast in late 2010 and early 2011. In addition, they were
subject to persistent criticism from the Opposition over
wasteful spending and demands that they honor their elec-
tion commitment to return the budget to surplus by 2012-
2013 (Commonwealth of Australia: Senate, 2011).
The Policy Solutions Stream
Headspace and EPPIC were the primary policy solutions
advanced to address the youth mental health "problem."
Advocates argued that these programs were effective, had
6 SAGE Open
evidence of prior success, and were ready to be scaled up to
meet needs. The option of taking no action (by either invest-
ing in other mental health services or not investing in mental
health at all) and proposals to mainstream youth care were
not advocated. The proposed "one-stop" policy solutions
(Headspace and EPPIC) were clearly defined and conceptu-
ally simple. They also had the advantage of having been pre-
tested in a small-scale pilot study domestically and on a
larger scale, internationally. Headspace had received some
funding in 2006 and by 2008 had 30 centers operating.
EPPIC had been operating in Australia since 1992 but on a
geographically limited scale. Similar models of care had,
however, been adopted in other countries, most notably in
the United Kingdom, where there had been significant
investment in early intervention services for psychoses
(Joseph & Birchwood, 2005).
Headspace and EPPIC also had high-profile policy advo-
cates lobbying politicians and policy makers. These included:
Ian Hickie, a founder and later director of Headspace; Pat
McGorry, Executive Director of Orygen Youth Health, the
mental health organization that developed and ran EPPIC,
and a director of Headspace; and John Mendoza, CEO of
what was then the Mental Health Council of Australia, the
peak mental health advisory body to the federal government.
Their proposed policy options received endorsement in the
media and parliament as a "solution" to youth mental illness
(Australian Associated Press, 2010b; Medew, 2010;
Robotham, 2009; Schmidt, 2009). They were promoted as
part of a "collaborative continuum of care" (Commonwealth
of Australia: House of Representatives, 2010, p. 980) that
was better able to meet the needs of young people than exist-
ing overburdened mainstream services that prioritized care
forpeoplewithsevereandchronicmentalillnesses(McGorry,
2011b; Muir, Powell, & McDermott, 2012).
The Political Stream
The political context in the 4 years preceding the 2011 bud-
get was characterized by the political upheaval of replacing a
first-term Labor Prime Minister in June 2010 followed by a
closely fought election that produced a minority Labor gov-
ernment in August 2010. The 2007 federal Labor election
victory had raised expectations that youth mental health
would be part of the new government's "revolutionary"
national health reforms (Commonwealth of Australia:
Senate, 2010, p. 4210; Crosbie, 2009; Office of the Prime
Minister & Minister for Health and Ageing, 2010). These
hopes were dashed when the 2009 and 2010 budgets pro-
vided little new funding commitments to mental health
(Metherell, 2010).
Transcripts of parliamentary debate around this time
reveal that politicians were conscious of the growing public
criticism about the lack of funding for mental health in the
national health reforms (Commonwealth of Australia: House
of Representatives, 2010; Commonwealth of Australia:
Senate, 2010). The media initially reported that government
action was pending, for example, "[that Headspace would]
be well positioned to make the most of our health reform
decisions" (Jenkins, 2009). However, later media comments
by the then health minister after the 2010 federal budget sug-
gested that mental health reform would occur as part of
national health reform at an unspecified future date (B.
Smith, 2010).
Politicians acknowledged increasing criticism that the
overall level of funding to mental health was low compared
with physical health, with mental health labeled a "poor rela-
tion"(CommonwealthofAustralia:HouseofRepresentatives,
2010, p. 1495).
The resignation of Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and his
replacement by Deputy Prime Minister Julia Gillard on the
June 24, 2010, overshadowed the delivery on the same day
of a letter signed by over 60 of the nation's peak mental
health organizations, demanding that greater attention be
paid to mental health in the wider health care reforms.
However, the sustained high media profile achieved by men-
tal health advocates, combined with the unflattering media
comparisons of the Labor and previous Liberal Government's
records on mental health, positioned mental health as an
issue to which the new Gillard-led government needed to
respond.
The Labor government was being criticized by the oppo-
sition who strongly advocated for mental health investment,
including in youth services, both before the August 2010
election, and after their narrow election loss. Coalition advo-
cacy often focused on their collaboration with leading men-
tal health experts and the previous Coalition Government's
decision to start funding early intervention services in 2006
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010; 2011). Both sides of politics used their alleged support
for mental health to promote their own records and attack
that of their opponents, increasing mental health's position
on the national policy agenda (see, for example,
Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010).
Policy entrepreneurs worked with the opposition to
develop an alternative, mental health election "Action Plan"
of A$1.5 billion, which placed a special emphasis on early
intervention (Liberal Party of Australia, 2010). This commit-
ment far exceeded the Government's July 2010 election
promise of A$277 million and placed pressure upon the
Government to match the opposition promise. The result was
a significant election promise from Labor to make mental
health a second-term priority (Commonwealth of Australia:
House of Representatives, 2010; Grattan, 2010). One of
Prime Minister Gillard's early decisions after the resignation
of Mr. Rudd was to appoint an inaugural federal minister for
mental health in September 2010 to give greater policy atten-
tion to the area than her predecessor had done. In the wake of
the federal election, increased resources for mental health
was seen as a "political imperative" (Drape, 2010), and the
Whiteford et al. 7
new minority Labor government was under significant pres-
sure to fund new services (Commonwealth of Australia:
House of Representatives, 2010, p. 1614, p. 1499).
Policy Entrepreneurs and the Opening of the
Policy Window
There was a growing recognition that the mental health sec-
tor needed high-profile champions to gain political support,
especially after the low allocations to mental health in the
2009 and 2010 budgets (Australian Associated Press, 2010c;
Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010; Hocking, 2010; O'Conner & Storm, 2010). This may
have prompted the application of consistent, high-impact
pressure by policy entrepreneurs on the political stream
through the media in 2010 and early 2011. These policy
entrepreneurs comprised a group of mental health advocates
who worked closely together. They included the highly visi-
ble public presence of 2010 Australian of the Year, Pat
McGorry (Commonwealth of Australia: House of
Representatives, 2010), John Mendoza, and Ian Hickie.
The naming of Professor McGorry as Australian of the
Year in 2010 provided important exposure for mental health
issues and enabled other mental health advocates to argue for
better youth mental health and mental health services more
generally(AustralianAssociatedPress,2011a;Commonwealth
ofAustralia: Senate, 2010). Professor McGorry used his status
to highlight the low commitments to mental health in 2010 and
was quoted as saying: "[the] Government . . . is pumping all its
precious fuel into acute health while mental health is left to run
on fumes" (McGorry, 2010b). McGorry was also quoted in
parliament as describing the funding for EPPIC in the 2010
budget as "[only enough to build] a heavily diluted cardboard
cut-out service lacking many of the core features of EPPIC"
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010, p. 2216). Hansard reveals that politicians on both sides
of the house responded to media appearances and comments
by this core group of policy entrepreneurs and also attempted
to obtain experts' approval for their policies (Commonwealth
of Australia: House of Representatives, 2010).
Policy entrepreneurs were engaged in creating a further
focusing event to publicize their criticism of Labor's commit-
ment to mental health: John Mendoza's public resignation on
the June 18, 2010, as the CEO of National Advisory
Commission on Mental Health, a Commission that the Labor
government itself had established. In his resignation letter,
Mendoza (2010) argued that "it is now abundantly clear that
there is no vision or commitment from the Rudd Government
to mental health" and that the government was "publicly
claiming credit for the increased investment in mental health
when almost all of this is a consequence of the work of the
Howard Government." The contents of his letter were reported
nationally (Fyfe & Star, 2010). Mendoza's resignation ensured
that mental health received media coverage in the lead up to
the August 2010 election and Hansard records an extensive,
often vituperative debate after Mendoza's resignation. His
comments were seized on by the opposition as an indication of
wider problems within the Rudd's Labor Government
(Commonwealth of Australia: House of Representatives,
2010; Commonwealth of Australia: Senate, 2010).
Mental health was further promoted as an issue by the
highly visible public advocacy organization GetUp! It coop-
erated with Mendoza after his resignation to highlight mental
health issues, generally, and youth mental health, specifi-
cally. In the months before the August 2010 election, GetUp!
ran a campaign that included candlelight vigils across the
country, National TV ads, three full-page newspaper ads
funded by donations, a mass emailing campaign to politi-
cians, and the delivery to the Government of a petition signed
by 103,000 Australians (Hagan, 2010).
Cohesiveness and unity among professionals in the men-
tal health sector was publically acknowledged as important
by these entrepreneurs (McGorry, 2011a). In March 2011, a
group of advocates, the Independent Mental Health Reform
Group (comprising Monsignor David Cappo, Professors
Patrick McGorry and Ian Hickie, Sebastian Rosenberg, John
Moran, and Matthew Hamilton), released a report "Including,
Connecting, Contributing: A Blueprint to Transform Mental
Health and Social Participation in Australia." This report
strongly encouraged the Government to invest in services
that were ready for immediate implementation (Independent
Mental Health Reform Group, 2011). The coalition's August
2010 plan and final budget announcement broadly accorded
with the Blueprint's recommendations (Boxall, 2011).
These policy entrepreneurs successfully constructed and
maintained youth mental health as a problem demanding
political attention. The policy solution--two early interven-
tion programs for youth--was attached to a problem in ways
that resonated nationally. These solutions were just as well
publicized as the problems they addressed and advertised as
ready to be rolled out. Professor Hickie argued in a radio
interview hours before the 2011 budget announcement on
May 10th, that these programs were "shovel-ready" and so
should be funded immediately (Australian Associated Press,
2011a). Widespread lobbying by policy entrepreneurs,
including their partnership with GetUp!, was critical to open-
ing the policy window. So was bipartisan support for mental
health reform.
Discussion
All five main elements of Kingdon's framework--problems,
policies, politics, policy actors, and policy windows--could
be identified at work in this analysis. A social condition,
youth mental illness, was identified as a problem requiring
action, using data from suicide rates, burden of illness, ineq-
uity in access to services, economic costs of not treating men-
tal illness, and through the argument that existing programs
were not fit for purpose in dealing with the problem. This
8 SAGE Open
effort was aided by focusing events such as the public resig-
nation of a key advocacy figure. Early intervention was the
policy solution claimed by these high-profile policy entrepre-
neurs as effective, having demonstrated success and being
readily scalable to meet the recognized need.
The Role of Evidence in Achieving Reform
Evidence was used for policy advocacy, but it was not the
sole reason why youth mental health reform reached the
threshold where a policy solution was adopted. The way the
problem was framed, in terms of the high prevalence and low
treatment rates of mental illness, was not new; the data had
been available for many years. However, this research evi-
dence was marshaled to construct the problem, and refer-
ences to the effectiveness of the proposed programs were
used to justify their adoption. Evidence was presented in the
media by highly effective advocates and supported by media
advocacy campaigns by GetUp! These effectively generated
a perceived change in national mood that convinced politi-
cians that something should be done. Widespread dissemina-
tion of early intervention as a policy persuaded them that
something could be done.
The debate, including dissent, within academic and pro-
fessional communities about the evidence base for the long-
termeffectivenessandcost-effectivenessofearlyintervention
in reducing the overall burden of mental health is well docu-
mented (see, for example, Bosanac, Patton, & Castle, 2010;
Pelosi, 2008; The RoyalAustralian and New Zealand College
of Psychiatrists, 2009; The Senate Finance and Public
Administration References Committee, 2010), but beyond
the scope of this article to address. Interestingly, however,
this debate did not appear to significantly affect the political
trajectory of the publicised problem or its solution and was in
fact primarily publicized in the media after the federal gov-
ernment had announced its decision to implement their
policies.
The Role of the (Media-Savvy) "Public" in
Creating Political Pressure
An important factor in this case study was the increasing
political will for change. The political stream was dominated
by Government reactions to a perceived overwhelming pub-
lic pressure for change, as evidenced by public support for
the GetUp! campaign, and the endorsements of Opposition
policies by highly influential mental health advocates. Public
pressure, however, did not necessarily reflect the views of a
representative section of the voting public. Rather, it was a
group that could be termed "the conspicuous public," those
who most effectively utilized social media to make their
views known, and thus became important influencers of
agenda setting on this issue. A recent study has suggested
that the "youth vote" (below 35) may have decided the out-
come of the 2001, 2004, 2007, and 2010 federal elections
(Brooker, 2011). If this is so, then support for youth issues
may have increased a political party's chances of success.
Serendipity
The role of serendipity in policy processes should not be
under-estimated. The unexpected change in leader of the
Labor party in 2010 and the election of a new government in
the same year provided an opportunity for a new leader to
move away from the previous leader's non-committal stance
on investing in mental health. This support's Kingdon's
argument that political timing and context, not all of which
can be predicted, are essential for policy change (Hall, 2004;
Kingdon, 2003).
Limitations
The findings of the study should be viewed in light of its
limitations. First, the short time period used to analyze this
case study does not take account of policy developments
over the span of decades. A short time period may fail to
capture some of these explanatory elements, particularly in
the policy stream. The benefit of examining a short policy
time frame is that it can examine the role of short-term politi-
cal pressures and focusing events. Second, the conclusions
drawn from an analysis of information in the public domain
is almost certainly incomplete. Under recent amendments
made to the Archives act of 1983, Cabinet records are now
publically available after 20 years rather than the previous
interval of 30 years (Commonwealth of Australia, 2013). A
future analysis with benefit of access to cabinet documents
and the recollections of key policy actors will enable a better
assessment of the accuracy of the conclusions we have
drawn. Third, the Kingdon framework describes agenda set-
ting rather than the implementation of policy. It was beyond
our scope to examine the extent to which the new services
actually created the outcomes intended by policy. This is an
important area for future study.
Conclusion
We analyzed the case study of youth mental health reform
using Kingdon's multiple streams approach to investigate when
and how evidence may have informed agenda setting. Our
findings suggest that the policy solutions most likely to succeed
are those that are pre-packaged and publicized, are seen to
address an identifiable and quantifiable problem, and are sup-
ported by high-profile and credible public figures. However,
the fact that some research evidence (e.g., the evidence base for
the cost-effectiveness of early intervention) did not enter the
public debate, or did not feature prominently, raises a number
of issues that require careful consideration in terms of the effec-
tive use of research evidence to achieve long-term mental
health reforms. Our analysis also identified an increasing "dou-
ble-role" of scientific researcher and policy advocate. The
Whiteford et al. 9
politicized use of evidence by policy entrepreneurs for the
advancement of funding to one part of the mental health system
has been shown in this study to be a successful approach; how-
ever, the scientific community should be conscious that selec-
tive reportage of research evidence runs the risk of reinforcing
a piecemeal and ad-hoc approach to reform (Whiteford, Harris,
& Diminic, 2013). We suggest that the path toward strategic,
long-term, evidence-informed mental health governance is per-
haps better served by developing and building upon an open
political culture, fluid knowledge flow across research and
policy realms, and the development of a skilled bureaucratic
workforce enabled to make the best use of evidence to inform
policy questions (Head, 2014).
The success of policy advocates increased the visibility of
youth mental health in the political sphere but only future
research will establish whether this policy change has pro-
duced lasting changes for the better or perpetuated a cycle of
ad-hoc reform prompted by the need to address a perceived
crisis created by policy advocates.
