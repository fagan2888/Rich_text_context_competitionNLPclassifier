Asthma is one of the most common, serious chronic diseases in pediatric and young adult populations. Health-risk behaviors,
including cigarette smoking and alcohol use, may exacerbate chronic diseases and complicate their management. The aim of this
study was to longitudinally analyze rates of cigarette smoking and alcohol use in adolescents and young adults who have asthma
and those who do not have asthma. A secondary analysis of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
was undertaken. Individuals with asthma were found to exhibit increasing rates of cigarette smoking and alcohol use as they
aged. When an adolescent with a chronic health issue begins health-risk-taking behaviors, behavior change interventions must
be planned. Pediatric nurses, practitioners, and clinicians are uniquely positioned to assess for health-risk behaviors in youth with
asthma and to intervene with plans of care that are tailored for the needs of this vulnerable population.
1. Introduction
Risk-taking behaviors that can have lifelong implications are
often begun in adolescence and young adulthood. Two com-
mon health-risk behaviors that are frequently initiated are
cigarette smoking and the alcohol consumption. The long-
term negative health consequences of these behaviors have
been well documented, as has their prevalence in the general
healthy adolescent population; however, what is beginning
to emerge in the literature is that health-risk behaviors are
also occurring among youth and adults with chronic health
conditions, specifically asthma. This paper discusses the
findings from a study that examined cigarette smoking and
alcohol use in adolescents and young adults who have asthma
and in those who do not have asthma. The sample was drawn
through a secondary analysis of data from the National
Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) [1].
Our study addressed the following research questions:
(1) How many adolescents and young adults with asthma
are engaging in health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking
cigarettes and drinking alcohol)?
(2) How do cigarette smoking and alcohol use rates and
patterns change as adolescents with asthma age?
(3) Are there differences in cigarette smoking and alcohol
use behaviors between adolescents and young adults
with asthma and those who do not have asthma?
Asthma is a significant and growing public health prob-
lem in the United States, with the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) estimating that about 7 million
children under the age of 18 years are affected [2]. Asthma
is considered the most common serious chronic disease
in children accounting for approximately 3 million visits
to healthcare providers and over 200,000 hospitalizations
annually [2, 3]. It is estimated that asthma affects 5% to 15%
of the pediatric population with prevalence peaking between
the ages of 5­17 years [2, 4]. Further, recent research suggests
that the prevalence rates of asthma in children are on the
rise; a nearly 72% increase in cases was reported between
1982 and 1994 [3, 5], making pediatric asthma the third
leading cause of hospitalizations in those under the age of
18 years.
2 Nursing Research and Practice
The course of asthma may vary in the pediatric popula-
tion with young children, school-age children, and adoles-
cents being managed and managing their asthma and related
symptoms differently. Typically younger children rely on a
parent or caregiver to monitor their health status, coordinate
visits to healthcare providers, and manage medications,
including rescue drugs (inhalers, nebulizers, etc.). As chil-
dren age into adolescence, expectations change such that the
monitoring and management of asthma and symptoms are
increasingly taken on by the individual adolescent or young
adult. At the same time that adolescents may be assuming
greater responsibility and control for their own asthma
management, they are being faced with the same temptations
and motivations that their peers face to engage in "adult-
like" health-related risk behaviors. Cigarette smoking is of
particular concern as smoking is known to exacerbate asthma
and directly contradicts the basic tenets of asthma education
and health promotion efforts [6­8].
In the United States, each day approximately 6,000 ado-
lescents, aged 12 to 18 years, try smoking a cigarette for the
first time, and 3,000 adolescents become daily smokers [9].
Most of these individuals do so without fully understanding
the health risks associated with cigarette smoking both in
the short and long term. In addition to being a well-
recognized health risk to the general population, cigarette
smoking exacerbates asthma and complicates management
[6, 8, 9]. Exposure to cigarette smoke is often associated
with increased clinical manifestations of asthma symptoms
(e.g., wheezing, coughing, and shortness of breath) and
an increased need for rescue medications and or medical
management [9­11]. Almost all asthma health education
materials contain specific references to the hazards of
airborne or inhaled irritants and the exacerbation of asthma
symptoms by cigarette use, second-hand smoke, wood
smoke, or fumes [7, 9]. Yet, contrary to healthcare providers'
assumptions and "common sense," there is growing evidence
that individuals with asthma do smoke cigarettes and that
their rates of cigarette smoking may be comparable to those
of peers who do not have asthma or another chronic illness
[6, 12­15].
A large body of research suggests that adolescents who
participate in one health-risk behavior are more likely to
engage in additional risk behaviors [9, 16, 17]. According to
the CDC [9], 75% of high school students report drinking
alcoholic beverages at least once. The cooccurrence of
alcohol consumption and cigarette smoking documented in
the general adolescent population is now being reported
among chronically ill youth [18]. The impact of alcohol
consumption on lung and airway function is dependent
upon concentration, duration, and route of exposure [19]. It
has been reported in the literature that prolonged and heavy
exposure to alcohol may complicate asthma management
in addition to exerting direct negative effects on lung
functioning [19]. However this has not been well studied in
individuals who have asthma.
Recent studies have shown that adolescents' engagement
in health-risk behaviors may be influenced by the social
pressures from peers and by their parent role models [6,
20, 21]. Specifically, children who have parents and friends
who smoke cigarettes are more likely than others to smoke
themselves [20]. Adolescents who smoke cigarettes may also
be influenced by parents or guardians who do not supervise
the activities of their child. Low parental monitoring has been
associated with high school students' reports of smoking
cigarettes, using other tobacco products, drinking alcohol,
and smoking marijuana [21].
2. Materials and Methods
The current study represents a secondary analysis of the
public-use data from the National Longitudinal Survey of
Adolescent Health (Add Health) [1]. Data were obtained
through a contractual arrangement with the proprietors of
Add Health [1], and IRB approval was obtained prior to
undertaking the secondary analysis. The decision to utilize
a secondary analysis for the current study was based on
the understanding that, in the nursing literature, the use
of "secondary analysis of large databases is increasingly
recognized as a valid and efficient method of research"
[22]. Using nationally representative databases provides
opportunities to address important health issues as these
databases allow researchers to study their phenomenon of
interest using large samples [22­25].
2.1. Procedures. The original study, the National Longitudi-
nal Study of Adolescent Health, is the largest, most compre-
hensive survey of adolescents ever undertaken in the United
States and is based upon a nationally representative sample
of adolescents enrolled in grades 7 through 12 in 1994.
Add Health contains survey data about adolescents' social
contexts (families, friends, peers, schools, neighborhoods,
and communities) and how these contexts may influence
adolescents' health and risk behaviors. The sampling design
for Add Health included complex, multilevel cluster sam-
pling techniques described in detail elsewhere [1, 26­28].
2.2. Setting and Participants. Add Health researchers selected
a sample of 80 out of the 26,666 high schools in the
United States stratified by size, school type, census region,
level of urbanization, and percent White. Fifty-two schools
agreed to participate, and the remaining 28 were replaced
by high schools with similar characteristics. Feeder schools
were also identified and included in data collection. Parental
consent was obtained prior to data collection [1]. Data for
Wave I were collected in 1994-1995 via in-school student
questionnaires, school administrator questionnaires, and in-
home interviews with students and one of the student's
parents (usually the mother). The in-home interview data
with students and parents were collected in 1995. A second
wave (Wave II) of data was subsequently collected in 1996
(not used in our analyses); a third wave of data (Wave III)
was collected in 2001-2002. Respondents, aged 18 to 26 years
at the time of Wave III, were reinterviewed to investigate their
transitions to young adulthood.
The sample for our study's secondary analysis consisted
of 4,882 adolescents and young adults who participated
in the Wave III survey. Eight cases from Wave III were

subsequently excluded due to missing data for whether or
not they had asthma, resulting in a final analytic sample of
4,874 individuals.
2.3. Data Collection and Analysis. All analyses were con-
ducted using SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
For this analysis, cross-sectional sampling weights for Wave
III were used on all data. Chi-squared tests were used
for comparisons of categorical data, and independent two-
sample t-tests were used for continuous/numeric variables.
Adjustments for sampling designs were made using the Rao-
Scott method [29]. Analyses were adjusted for clustering and
weighting from the publicly available dataset, but did not
address the stratification, as that variable was not available
in the public-use dataset. However, it has been reported that
exclusion of the strata variable in the public dataset "only
minimally affects the standard errors" [30].
2.4. Measures. The current study employed measures from
the Wave I and Wave III questionnaires. Demographic
measures from adolescents included Wave I reports of
age, gender, race, ethnicity, and household composition.
Background information from parents (usually the mother)
at Wave I included age, marital status, asthma, smoking, and
alcohol use.
Key measures of interest in this study included questions
from Waves I and III asking about asthma status, cigarette
smoking, and alcohol intake. Asthma status was assessed via
self-report by asking, "Have you ever been diagnosed with
asthma?" Participants responded "yes" or "no." Cigarette
smoking and alcohol consumption were assessed with two
sets of questions. The first asked participants whether they
had "ever" tried the behavior (smoking cigarettes or drinking
alcoholic beverages). Second, participants were asked if they
had "regularly" smoked (defined as at least one cigarette per
day for 30 days). The response choices were "yes" or "no."
Participants were also asked to rate how much alcohol they
drank. The question was worded, "Think of all of the times
you have had a drink in the past twelve months. How many
drinks did you usually have each time?"
3. Results
A total of 818 (16.2%) Add Health participants were self-
identified as having asthma and were included in the asthma
group; 4,056 were self-identified as not having asthma and
were included in the nonasthma group. As is shown in
Table 1, there were no significant differences in the two
groups in terms of age, sex, or race. The asthma group
included slightly more females, although these differences
were not statistically significant. However, those in the
asthma group were more likely to speak only English in the
home and were less likely to have been born outside the
USA compared to those in the nonasthma group (P < .01
and P < .05, resp.). Those with asthma reported having
more health problems related to allergies when compared
to their nonasthma peers (70% versus 37%; P < .001) and
were more likely to have a family history of asthma (P <
.001); 19% of the asthma group versus 7% of nonasthma
group had a biological mother with asthma and 15% of the
asthma group versus 5% of the nonasthma group reported
having a biological father with asthma (P < .0001 for
both).
3.1. Smoking Cigarettes. Findings from Wave III indicated
that those with asthma had higher rates of having tried
cigarette smoking (79%) compared to those without asthma
(75%; P < .05). In addition, those in the asthma group
were more likely to become later smokers than those in the
nonasthma group. Comparing smoking patterns at Wave I
4 Nursing Research and Practice
and Wave III for both groups found that there was an increase
of 18% in smoking within the asthma group (they reported
not smoking in Wave I but responded "yes" to regularly
smoking eight years later in Wave III). As is shown in Table 2,
there was additional evidence (P < 0.06) that suggested those
with asthma were more likely to smoke regularly than those
without asthma (72% versus 67%). Those in the asthma
group (33%) were also more likely to report experiencing
feelings of moderate or intense physical relaxation when they
began smoking compared to 29% of the nonasthma group
(P < 0.05).
3.2. Drinking Alcohol. Participants in the asthma group
reported drinking behaviors that were comparable to those
without asthma at both Wave I and Wave III. There were
no significant differences between the two groups' reports.
However, differences were found between the groups in
changes in the amount of alcohol consumption that occurred
between Waves I and III. As is shown in Table 3, the asthma
group drank 0.22 drinks less than their nonasthma peers
at Wave I (early- to mid-adolescence); six-seven years later
(Wave III; young adulthood), the asthma group reported
drinking 0.30 drinks more than those in the nonasthma
group. This represented an increase of almost one full drink
per episode.
In addition, participants in the asthma group were more
likely to report alcohol-related risk behaviors at Wave III,
compared to those in the nonasthma group. Specifically,
participants with asthma were more likely to report having at
least one best friend who was a binge drinker (5+ drinks on a
single occasion) (58% versus 55%; P < 0.05). Asthma group
participants also reported being slightly more likely to report
having a sexual situation occur after drinking alcohol than
the group without asthma (24% versus 21%); this finding
was worrisome although not statistically significant.
4. Discussion and Clinical Implications
Three major findings emerged from this study: (1) adoles-
cents and young adults with asthma are smoking cigarettes
and drinking alcohol; two behaviors that are contraindi-
cated for individuals with asthma; (2) the asthma group
participated in these health-risk behaviors at rates that were
similar to their nonasthma peers during adolescence and
at even higher rates during young adulthood; (3) those
in the asthma group reported elevated rates of lifestyle
risk behaviors associated with alcohol use. The study's
findings have implications for nurses, nurse practitioners,
health educators, and other professionals who work with
adolescents and young adults who have asthma.
When a diagnosis of asthma is made, healthcare pro-
fessionals begin anticipatory guidance related to health
promotion and management of asthma symptoms. Asthma
education focuses on identifying triggers, recommendations
for a healthy lifestyle, limiting exposure to allergens, use
of medications (rescue and maintenance), and adherence
to a holistic plan of care. Goals of asthma therapy include
minimal or no chronic symptoms (daytime or nighttime);

minimal or no exacerbations; no limitations on physical
activities (no missed school or work days); minimal use of
short-acting inhaled Beta2-agonists; minimal or no adverse
events from medication [2, 9, 31]. Successful treatment of
asthma may be impeded when other risk behaviors are
present particularly in the face of severe asthma [6]. Smoking
cigarettes is recognized as a deterrent to healthy pulmonary
function and would be contraindicated in any plan of care
for asthma.
Adolescent cigarette smoking can be viewed within a
broad profile of risk factors that incorporate the desire to
take health risks, peer influences, parental role modeling,
environment, perception of current health, and any chronic
conditions [6, 20, 32, 33]. To better assess individuals with
asthma and gauge their participation in health-risk behav-
iors, ongoing risk behavior assessments should be conducted
at each healthcare visit. Pediatric nurses, practitioners,
clinicians, and other healthcare professionals are in an ideal
position to assess the type of and level of participation in
an adolescent or a young adult with asthma. Using open-
ended questioning is ideal for exploring what experiences
adolescents have had with cigarettes or alcohol, how long
they have been smoking or drinking, how the behavior
began, where they are encountering cigarettes or alcohol,
how they perceive their friends' participation with these
substances, and what behaviors they see in their household
with their parents.
In addition to assessment, a family-centered approach
to asthma management is important. Whether or not the
Nursing Research and Practice 5
parents or other household members smoke needs to be
assessed [6, 7]. The potential influence of parental monitor-
ing/supervision, role modeling of risk behaviors, and access
to cigarettes and alcohol in the home should be discussed
with parents. Education on risk reduction strategies and
referrals for smoking cessation assistance should be offered
when indicated.
Reasons for smoking and how cigarettes make ado-
lescents feel should also be assessed. For example, in the
current study those with asthma reported feeling a physical
relaxation from smoking and were less likely to report having
tried to quit smoking cigarettes. Asking questions during an
exam or taking a history specific to cigarette smoking, age
of first cigarette, how many cigarettes they smoke a day, how
smoking makes he or she feel, and if they have tried to quit
smoking may provide insight that can direct the development
of an individualized plan of care to decrease or cease cigarette
smoking.
Drinking alcohol was also found to be a health-risk
behavior for the asthma group in this study. As young adults
the asthma group reported drinking slightly more alcohol
than those without asthma. In addition, they reported some-
what higher rates of risky lifestyle behaviors associated with
alcohol use. Having a friend who binge drinks, participating
in a sexual situation after drinking alcohol, and being drunk
at school or work (8% of the asthma group versus 6%
of the without asthma group) are behaviors that together
or alone raise alarms. For example, adolescents without a
chronic illness who have alcohol-related disorders or heavy
consumption of alcohol have been found to be more likely
to smoke cigarettes, less likely to exercise, and less likely
eat a balanced diet and take vitamins compared to those
without alcohol use disorders [33]. Further study is needed to
better understand the participation in risky lifestyle choices
associated with drinking alcohol and how these are affecting
individuals with asthma, their level of health and disease
knowledge in addition to their commitment to a wellness
lifestyle. Research into how much alcohol is being consumed
by adolescents and young adults with asthma and how
their alcohol intake may relate to their lung functioning,
occurrence of respiratory infections, and use of asthma
medications is also essential.
Alcohol use and cigarette smoking are complex behaviors
whose prevalence appears to increase with age in the general
population of adolescents and young adults [2]. Our study
findings support this literature with similar findings in an
at-risk population, adolescents and young adults who have
asthma. It is not uncommon for youth with or without a
chronic illness to want to belong and behavior as others.
There is a growing body of research that has found youth
with a chronic condition may have additional risks for
engaging in health-risk behaviors (e.g., smoking cigarettes,
smoking marijuana, performing violent, or antisocial acts)
when compared with healthy peers [6, 34, 35]. Our study fur-
thers the existing literature by comparing cigarette smoking
and alcohol consumption between those with and without
asthma and by examining these behaviors longitudinally
across adolescence and the transition to young adulthood.
That our study found an increase in smoking cigarettes
and drinking alcohol in an asthma population suggests
that continued education and health promotion by nurses
and other healthcare professionals is imperative during this
transitional time period.
The diagnosis of asthma in our study's population was
made before the 7th grade, a finding that implies that the
child's parent or guardian was aware of the condition. In
asthma education and management parents or guardians are
involved in every aspect of health and treatment when their
children are young. As children age into adolescence, asthma
management may gradually shift from parent to adolescent
and increase the youth's accountability and responsibility
for his or her disease and management. Nonetheless, strong
parental support of positive behaviors that promote health
has been found to be associated with lower rates of risk
behaviors in adolescents with health issues [17].
In this study behaviors of cigarette smoking and drinking
alcohol were found during adolescence and then again six to
seven years later during the young adult time period. Pedi-
atric nurses have an influential role in how adolescents man-
age their health, asthma management, and risk taking behav-
iors as they age. Providing positive anticipatory guidance and
including both adolescents and parents in the plan of care
may have a better chance of succeeding in promoting healthy
lifestyle choices that will be with them across their lifespan.
Nurses and other healthcare providers must consider
directing their health promotion and educational efforts
towards two areas with an asthma population: prevention
and smoking cessation. Nurses can find time during an
individual's primary health visit, specialty clinic visit, school
nurse visit, parish visit, community or home visit to
convey health promotion information that is focused on
the prevention and abstinence from smoking. There are
currently numerous cessation programs designed to educate
individuals about the hazards of cigarette smoking and
drinking alcohol for healthy adolescents and young adults.
Nurses, practitioners, educators, and other professionals are
in ideal positions to create new programs or modify existing
ones to incorporate interventions and materials that address
the special needs of a young, chronically ill population.
5. Research Implications
We do not fully appreciate the relationships between the
developmental needs of the adolescents, the physiology
of their health condition, and social influences of family
and peers. Health-related behavior is complex, involving
a myriad of factors that contribute to the occurrence of
health promotion and health-risk behaviors that can begin
in adolescence and continue into adulthood. Findings from
this study are consistent with the broader literature on
health behavior that highlights that knowledge alone and a
diagnosis of asthma may not account for behavior or act
as factors in preventing smoking [6, 7, 31, 35, 36]. Our
study supports findings from Tercyak using Add Health
Wave II data [35]. Tercyak reported that adolescents with
asthma were just as likely to experiment with smoking in
their lifetime and were significantly more likely to be current
smokers than their peers without asthma. Further, rates of
6 Nursing Research and Practice
current smoking were higher in the asthma group (48%)
compared to those without asthma (42%). Given the current
study findings that smoking rates continued to increase
as youth with asthma aged, equal to or exceeding rates
in the nonasthma group, further research should focus on
understanding the factors that contribute to the adoption of
heath-risk behaviors of this chronically ill group.
6. Limitations
The study findings should be viewed in light of the study
limitations. Two of the most significant shortcomings in the
current study relate to the use of abbreviated measures in
the Add Health dataset and the omission of several clini-
cally relevant variables. Specifically, this study relied upon
adolescents' self-reports of having asthma. No confirmatory
medical diagnoses were obtained, and no data regarding
the severity of the asthma (e.g., mild, moderate, or severe)
were collected. In addition, there were no data collected
regarding the type of asthma (e.g., reactive airway, physical
exertion, or allergy induced). These two shortcomings are
commonly encountered limitations in secondary analyses
with large, national datasets [23­25, 37]. While these types
of datasets provide large, representative samples, and breadth
of data, they tend to lack detailed measures in any single area
[23­25, 37]. Nonetheless, the Add Health study data were
well suited to this initial examination of cigarette smoking
and alcohol use among adolescents and young adults with
asthma.
