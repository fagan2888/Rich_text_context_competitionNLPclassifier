ABSTRACT
MyD88 KO (knockout) mice are exquisitely sensitive to CNS
(central nervous system) infection with Staphylococcus
aureus, a common aetiological agent of brain abscess,
exhibiting global defects in innate immunity and exacer-
bated tissue damage. However, since brain abscesses are
typified by the involvement of both activated CNS-resident
and infiltrating immune cells, in our previous studies it has
been impossible to determine the relative contribution of
MyD88-dependent signalling in the CNS compared with
the peripheral immune cell compartments. In the present
study we addressed this by examining the course of S.
aureus infection in MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice.
Interestingly, chimaeras where MyD88 was present in the
CNS, but not bone marrow-derived cells, mounted pro-
inflammatory mediator expression profiles and neutrophil
recruitment equivalent to or exceeding that detected in WT
(wild-type) mice. These results implicate CNS MyD88 as
essential in eliciting the initial wave of inflammation during
the acute response to parenchymal infection. Microarray
analysis of infected MyD88 KO compared with WT mice
revealed a preponderance of differentially regulated genes
involved in apoptotic pathways, suggesting that the
extensive tissue damage characteristic of brain abscesses
from MyD88 KO mice could result from dysregulated
apoptosis. Collectively, the findings of the present study
highlight a novel mechanism for CNS-resident cells in
initiating a protective innate immune response in the
infected brain and, in the absence of MyD88 in this
compartment, immunity is compromised.

INTRODUCTION
In the CNS (central nervous system), brain abscesses arise
from a parenchymal infection by pyogenic bacteria and
represent a serious life-threatening condition. Brain abscesses
can form by bacterial perforation of the thin bony structures
separating the brain from neighbouring sites of chronic
infection occurring in the paranasal sinuses, middle ear, or
upper molars. Other routes include seeding of the brain with
bacterial emboli originating from systemic sites of infection
(i.e. endocarditis or septicemia) (Mathisen and Johnson, 1997)
where the frontal and temporal lobes are most commonly
affected (McClelland et al., 1978; Carpenter et al., 2007),
penetrating trauma to the head, or following neurosurgery
(Tenney, 1986; Schliamser et al., 1988). Although brain
abscesses ensue in response to a diverse array of pathogens,
streptococcal species and Staphylococcus aureus represent
the most common aetiological agents of infection in humans.
Innate immunity plays an essential role in the host
response to bacterial infections. Among the central players

in anti-bacterial immunity are members of the TLR (Toll-like
receptor) family of pattern recognition receptors (Akira et al.,
2006; Trinchieri and Sher, 2007). These receptors recognize
conserved motifs from a wide range of pathogens that are
inherently resistant to mutation based on their essential
nature for pathogen survival (Medzhitov and Janeway, 2002).
When considering the array of TLRs that could be triggered
during S. aureus infection in the brain, several candidates
emerge, since the bacterium presents an arsenal of distinct
immunostimulatory motifs. For example, bacterial lipopro-
teins and PGN (peptidoglycan) can trigger TLR1 and TLR2,
whereas bacterial DNA can stimulate TLR9 in endosomal
compartments (Akira et al., 2006; Trinchieri and Sher, 2007).
Based on this complexity it is expected that numerous
receptors are engaged following bacterial infection in the
brain. This is supported by our previous studies demonstrating
that brain abscess pathogenesis following S. aureus infection
was not markedly affected by the loss of TLR2 (Kielian et al.,
2005). Therefore a broader role for additional recognition
molecules sensing bacterial infection was apparent.
MyD88 is a central adaptor molecule for the majority of
TLRs, with the exception of TLR3 (Akira, 2006; O'Neill and
Bowie, 2007). This molecule is also responsible for transdu-
cing activation signals emanating from the IL-1R [IL
(interleukin)-1 receptor] and IL-18R (Wesche et al., 1997;
Adachi et al., 1998; Burns et al., 1998; Medzhitov et al., 1998).
Since IL-1 and IL-18 have been shown to have important roles
in anti-bacterial immunity, coupled with the pivotal role of
MyD88-dependent pathways in bacterial recognition and the
induction of downstream cytokine signalling networks,
MyD88 represents a central converging point in the innate
inflammatory pathway. Indeed, recent studies from our
laboratory have demonstrated the essential role of MyD88-
dependent mechanism(s) in mounting a productive host
innate immune response during the acute stage of brain
abscess development (Kielian et al., 2007). Studies by other
groups have also established the importance of MyD88-
dependent pathways in the innate immune response to
Gram-positive infections in both the CNS and periphery
(Takeuchi et al., 2000; Koedel et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2006;
Fremond et al., 2007).
Although our previous report demonstrated an essential
and non-redundant role for MyD88 in eliciting an innate
immune response during brain abscess development (Kielian
et al., 2007), it remained unclear whether MyD88 expression
was more important in CNS-resident compared with
infiltrating immune cells since the molecule was globally
absent in KO (knockout) mice. To address this question, we
engineered radiation bone marrow chimaera mice where
MyD88 was differentially expressed in the CNS compared
with the peripheral immune cell compartments.
Unexpectedly, the results demonstrated that MyD88 express-
ion in the CNS was required to mount an innate immune
response equivalent to WT (wild-type) during the acute stage
of brain abscess development. The requirement for MyD88 in
CNS-resident cells was reinforced by the finding that
neutrophil influx into the infected brain was only achieved
in chimaeric mice where MyD88 was present in the CNS. This
is probably due to the fact that numerous neutrophil
chemokines were restored to WT levels only in animals where
MyD88 was expressed in the CNS compartment.
Curiously, our previous study demonstrated that, despite
global defects in innate immunity, bacterial burdens
remained relatively consistent between MyD88 KO and WT
mice, suggesting that mechanisms other than bacterial
burdens themselves were responsible for the enhanced
susceptibility of MyD88 KO mice to CNS S. aureus infection
(Kielian et al., 2007). In the present study, we performed
transcriptional profiling with Illumina microarrays to identify
pathways that were differentially regulated by MyD88 during
brain abscess development that might provide some insights
into why these animals succumb so quickly to infection,
despite having relatively equivalent bacterial burdens as WT
animals. These studies revealed a preponderance of differ-
entially regulated genes involved in apoptotic pathways,
suggesting that the extensive tissue damage characteristic of
brain abscesses from MyD88 KO mice could result from
dysregulated apoptosis. Collectively, these results reveal an
essential role for MyD88 in CNS-resident cells that triggers a
protective innate immune response within the first 24 h
following intracerebral infection with S. aureus.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice
All animal use protocols were approved by the University of
Arkansas for Medical Sciences Institutional Animal Care and
Use Committee and are in accordance with the National
Institutes of Health guidelines for the use of rodents. MyD88
gene KO mice (originally from Dr Shizuo Akira, Osaka
University, Japan) (Adachi et al., 1998) have been previously
backcrossed with C57BL/6 mice for over ten generations
(Kawai et al., 1999; Fremond et al., 2004). Age- and sex-
matched C57BL/6 mice (Harlan Laboratories) were used as WT
controls. For the generation of bone marrow chimaeras, B6/
SJL mice that are congenic for the CD45 allele (CD45.1) on a
C57BL/6 background were purchased from Jackson
Laboratories. Mice were used between 10 and 12 weeks of
age for all brain abscess studies.
Generation of MyD88 radiation bone marrow
chimaera mice
For generating MyD88 bone marrow chimaeras, CD45
congenic B6/SJL mice were used where only one allele,
CD45.1, originates from the SJL strain, whereas the remainder
of the genome is derived from C57BL/6 mice. These animals

represent the WT strain since they express functional MyD88.
MyD88 KO mice are on a C57BL/6 background and express
the CD45.2 allele, allowing for the discrimination between
donor- compared with recipient-derived leucocytes based on
staining with antibodies specific for CD45.1 and CD45.2. The
following radiation chimaeras were generated in these
experiments (donor bone marrowRirradiated recipient):
WTRWT, KORKO, WTRKO and KORWT. The experimental
chimaeras were WTRKO and KORWT, whereas the other two
groups (WTRWT and KORKO) represented controls to rule
out any non-specific effects of irradiation on immune
activation. The latter could be verified by confirming that
the inflammatory profiles of irradiated control groups
obtained in the present study (WTRWT and KORKO) were
similar to those observed in non-irradiated MyD88 WT and KO
mice as reported recently (Kielian et al., 2007). CNS
parenchymal cells are radiation-resistant and maintain the
host phenotype following radiation exposure (Hickey and
Kimura, 1988; Ajami et al., 2007). Reconstitution of irradiated
MyD88 KO animals with bone marrow from WT recipients
ensured that cells derived from the bone marrow expressed
this molecule along with CNS perivascular cells (Hickey and
Kimura, 1988; Bechmann et al., 2001). In contrast, parenchy-
mal microglia would not express MyD88 as a result of their
radioresistance. The procedure for bone marrow chimaera
generation was based on previously published studies with
minor modifications (Hickey and Kimura, 1988; Byram et al.,
2004; Zehntner et al., 2004; Chakravarty and Herkenham,
2005). Briefly, bone marrow donor mice were euthanized with
an overdose of inhaled isoflurane and marrow was isolated
from the long bones by flushing with sterile 16PBS.
Recipient mice were placed on antibiotic-supplemented
water (1 g/l neomycin and 125 mg/l polymyxin) for 4 days
prior to bone marrow transfer and subjected to irradiation
(1000 rad) using a J.L. Shepherd Model i45 caesium irradiator
to destroy the marrow. Within 4 h following irradiation,
recipient mice received an i.v. (intravenous) injection of
26107 bone marrow cells supplemented with 16107 cells
from the spleen to serve as an immediate source of immune
cells. Engraftment was allowed to take place over a 6­8 week
period and chimaeric animals were maintained on antibiotic-
supplemented water for the first 2 weeks to provide
protection during transient immunocompromise. At 6­8
weeks post-transplant, chimaeric mice were bled retro-
orbitally and cells were stained for flow cytometric analysis
using CD45.1 and CD45.2. Only animals that displayed
chimaerism of greater than 90% were used in brain abscess
studies. Animals were evaluated for their responses to an
intracerebral inoculation of S. aureus at approx. 10­12 weeks
following bone marrow transfer, a period that we, and others
(Hassan-Zahraee et al., 2000; Becher et al., 2001; Zehntner et
al., 2004), have established to be sufficient for establishing
chimaerism. We found that bone marrow chimaeras gener-
ated with B6/SJL and MyD88 KO mice did not exhibit any
evidence of graft versus host disease, indicating that this was
not a confounding issue.
Generation of experimental brain abscess
Live S. aureus (strain RN6390) was encapsulated in agarose
beads prior to implantation in the brain as previously
described (Kielian et al., 2001). Previous studies from our
laboratory have established that the introduction of sterile
agarose beads does not induce overt inflammation or
peripheral immune cell infiltrates (Kielian et al., 2001;
Baldwin and Kielian, 2004). To induce brain abscesses, mice
were anaesthetized with 2.5% avertin i.p. (intraperitoneally)
and a 1 cm longitudinal incision was made along the vertex
of the skull extending from the ear to the eye. A rodent
stereotaxic apparatus equipped with a Cunningham mouse
adaptor (Stoelting) was used to implant S. aureus-encapsu-
lated beads into the caudate/putamen region using the
following co-ordinates relative to bregma: +1.0 mm rostral,
+2.0 mm lateral, and 23.0 mm deep from the surface of the
brain. A burr hole was made and a 5 ml Hamilton syringe
fitted with a 26-gauge bevelled needle was used to slowly
deliver 2 ml of beads [104 CFUs (colony forming units)] into
the brain parenchyma. The needle remained in place for 2.5
min following injection to minimize bead efflux and potential
leakage into the meninges. The incision was closed using
surgical glue.
Preparation of brain abscess homogenates
To prepare brain abscess homogenates for downstream
protein and RNA analysis, lesion sites were visualized by the
stab wound created during injections and were sectioned
within 1­2 mm on all sides. Upon recovery, brain abscesses
were homogenized in 500 ml of PBS supplemented with a
CompleteTM protease inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and 160
units/ml RNAse inhibitor (Promega) using a Polytron
homogenizer (Brinkmann Instruments). At this point, a 20
ml aliquot of abscess homogenate was removed for
quantitative culture of viable bacteria as described below.
Subsequently, homogenates were centrifuged at 21 000 g for
15 min at 4°C to pellet membrane material, and supernatants
were removed and stored at 270°C until ELISA and multi-
plex cytokine microbead array analysis as described below.
Quantification of viable bacteria from brain
abscesses
To quantify the numbers of viable bacteria associated with
brain abscesses, serial 10-fold dilutions of abscess homo-
genates were plated on to blood agar plates. Titres were
calculated by enumerating colony growth and were expressed
as CFUs per ml of homogenate.
ELISA
Protein levels of CXCL2 were quantified in brain abscess
homogenates using an ELISA kit according to the manufac-
turer's instructions (DuoSet, R&D Systems; level of sensitiv-
ity515.6 pg/ml). Results were normalized to the amount of
CNS MyD88 in brain abscesses

total protein extracted from tissues to correct for differences
in sampling size as previously described (Baldwin and Kielian,
2004; Kielian et al., 2004a).
Multi-analyte microbead array to detect pro-
inflammatory mediator expression
To expand the analysis of inflammatory mediators differenti-
ally expressed between the various MyD88 bone marrow
chimaera mice, a mouse 20-plex cytokine microbead array
system was used according to the manufacturer's instructions
(BioSource International). This microbead array allowed for
the simultaneous detection of 20 individual inflammatory
molecules in a single 50 ml brain abscess homogenate sample
including IL-1a, IL-1b, TNF-a (tumour necrosis factor-a), IFN-
c (interferon-c), IL-2, IL-3, IL-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-10, IL-12 p40/
p70, IL-13, IL-17, IP-10 (chemokine CXCL10), MIG (monokine
induced by IFN-c), MCP-1 (monocyte chemotactic protein-1),
KC (chemokine CXCL1), GM-CSF (granulocyte/macrophage
colony-stimulating factor), VEGF (vascular endothelial growth
factor) and bFGF (basic fibroblast growth factor). Results
were analysed using a Bio-Plex Workstation (Bio-Rad) and
adjusted based on the amount of total protein extracted from
abscess tissues for normalization. The level of sensitivity for
each microbead cytokine standard curve ranged from 1 to 35
pg/ml.
Immunofluorescence staining and confocal
microscopy
Neutrophil and microglia/macrophage accumulation in brain
abscesses from MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice were
evaluated by immunofluorescence staining using Gr-1 and
Iba-1 respectively. For these studies, mice were infected with
104 CFUs of S. aureus RN6390 engineered to express GFP
(green fluorescent protein) under the control of the RNAIII
promoter (a gift of Dr Ambrose Cheung, Dartmouth Medical
School, Hanover, NH, U.S.A.) to visualize bacterial dissemina-
tion in tissue sections. At the indicated time points post-
infection (i.e. 18 or 24 h), MyD88 bone marrow chimaera
mice were perfused transcardially to eliminate leucocytes
from the vasculature, whereupon brains were removed and
immediately flash-frozen on dry ice. These early time intervals
were required since the survival period of MyD88 KO mice did
not extend much beyond this time point (Kielian et al., 2007).
Prior to cryostat sectioning, brain tissues were embedded in
OCT (optimal cutting temperature) medium, whereupon serial
10 mm sections were made throughout the entire lesioned
tissue, mounted on to SuperFrost Plus slides (Fisher
Scientific), air-dried, and stored at 280°C until use. For Gr-1
staining, fresh frozen tissues were analysed; however, to
detect Iba-1 immunoreactivity, tissue sections were post-
fixed in 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde for 1 h, since strong
reactivity with this antibody was not detected in freshly
frozen sections. Tissues were incubated with either rat anti-
mouse Gr-1 (BD Biosciences) or rabbit anti-mouse Iba-1
(Biocare Medical) antibodies overnight at 4°C in a humidified
chamber. Following numerous rinses in PBS, Gr-1 staining
was detected with a mouse anti-rat IgG-HRP (horseradish
peroxidase)-conjugated antibody (Invitrogen) for 1 h at room
temperature (25°C) and visualized using a TSA-Alexa FluorH
594 kit (Invitrogen). For Iba-1 detection, a rabbit ImmPRESS
kit (Vector Laboratories) was used in conjunction with a TSA-
Alexa FluorH 594 kit. Upon completion of the staining
protocols, slides were coverslipped using the Prolong anti-
fade reagent (Invitrogen) and sealed using nail polish. Slides
were imaged using a Zeiss laser-scanning confocal micro-
scope (LSM 510; Carl Zeiss Microimaging). Specific staining of
antibodies was confirmed by the absence of fluorescence
signal following incubation of brain abscess tissues with
secondary antibodies alone (results not shown).
RNA isolation and Illumina oligonucleotide
microarray
Total RNA from brain abscesses of MyD88 KO and WT mice
was isolated using TRIzolH reagent (Invitrogen) and subjected
to DNAse treatment prior to use in microarray studies. RNA
concentrations and integrity were determined with an
Agilent 2100 bio-analyser using Agilent RNA6000 Nano kits.
Transcriptional profiling of changes in gene expression
between S. aureus-infected MyD88 KO and WT mice was
determined using Illumina Sentrix MouseRef-8 Expression
BeadChips (Illumina). For these experiments, RNA samples
from four individual animals/group/time point were analysed
to account for biological variability. Total RNA was used to
generate biotin-labelled cRNA using the Illumina TotalPrep
RNA Amplification Kit (Ambion, catalogue number IL1791).
Briefly, 0.5 mg of total RNA was first converted into single-
stranded cDNA with reverse transcriptase using an oligo-dT
primer containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter site and
then copied to produce double-stranded cDNA molecules. The
double-stranded cDNA was cleaned and concentrated with
the supplied columns and used in an overnight in vitro
transcription reaction where single-stranded RNA (cRNA) was
generated and labelled by incorporation of biotin-16-UTP. A
total of 0.75 mg of biotin-labelled cRNA was hybridized at
58°C for 16 h to Illumina's Sentrix MouseRef-8 Expression
BeadChips. Each BeadChip has 24 000 well-annotated RefSeq
transcripts with approx. 30-fold redundancy. The arrays were
washed, blocked, and the labelled cRNA was detected by
staining with streptavidin-Cy3. The arrays were scanned using
an Illumina BeadStation 500X Genetic Analysis Systems
scanner and the image data was extracted using the
Illumina BeadStudio software, version 3.0.
Microarray data analysis and statistical methods
The expression data were filtered to include only probes with
a consistent signal on each chip; the probe original signal
filter value was established at a detection P value,0.02. The
resulting dataset was next analysed with DIANE 6.0, a
S Garg and others

spreadsheet-based microarray analysis program. An overview
of DIANE can be found online at http://www.grc.nia.nih.gov/
branches/rrb/dna/diane_software.pdf. Using DIANE, the
results were normalized with a Z-score transformation
(Cheadle et al., 2003). Z-normalized data were then analysed
with PCA (principal component analysis). To determine the
gene expression changes caused by each specific RNA
comparison, Z-scores for paired treatment groups were
compared using the Z-ratio statistic (Cheadle et al., 2003):
Z-ratio~
Z-scoreLPS
{Z-scorevehicle
s Z-scoreLPS
{Z-scorevehicle
½ 
Expression changes for individual genes were considered
significant if they met four criteria: Z-ratio above 1.5 or
below 21.5; FDR (false detection rate) (Tusher et al., 2001) of
less than 0.30; a P value statistic for Z-score replicability
below 0.05; and mean background-corrected signal intensity
greater than zero.
qRT-PCR [quantitative real-time RT (reverse
transcriptase)-PCR]
To confirm a subset of differentially expressed genes from
microarray studies, qRT-PCR was performed as previously
described (Kielian et al., 2004b). ABI Assays on Demand kits
were used to examine Lcn2 (lipocalin-2), Pacsin3 (protein
kinase C and casein kinase substrate in neurons 3), Ier3/IEX
(immediate early response 3), Pfc (complement factor
properdin) and SOCS3 (suppressor of cytokine signalling 3)
expression, whereas GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) primers and the TAMRA TaqMan probe were
synthesized by ABI based on previously published sequences
(Esen et al., 2004; Tanga et al., 2005).
Statistics
Significant differences between the various MyD88 bone
marrow chimaera experimental groups were determined
using one-way ANOVA followed by the Holm­Sidak method
for multiple pair-wise comparisons with Sigma Stat (SPSS
Science). For comparisons in gene expression profiles between
MyD88 KO and WT mice by qRT-PCR the Student's t test was
used.
RESULTS
MyD88 expression in the CNS compartment is
essential for achieving maximal inflammatory
responses to intracerebral S. aureus infection
Recent studies from our laboratory have identified an
essential role for MyD88-dependent pathways in initiating
innate immune responses to S. aureus during the acute stage
of brain abscess formation (Kielian et al., 2007). However, the
relative importance of MyD88 within the CNS compartment
compared with infiltrating peripheral immune cells was
uncertain, since prior studies utilized MyD88 KO mice where
this adaptor was globally absent. To address this question, we
generated chimaeric animals using B6.SJL congenic mice that
express the CD45.1 allele, allowing the discrimination
between donor and recipient cells based on the fact that
MyD88 KO mice are on a C57BL/6 background and express
CD45.2. In pilot studies, we carefully titrated the dose of
ionizing radiation administered to recipient mice to ablate
the bone marrow without inducing toxicity to the gastro-
intestinal tract (results not shown). Mice were evaluated at 8
weeks following bone marrow transfer to assess the degree of
chimaerism by examining the extent of CD45.1 and CD45.2
expression on peripheral blood leucocytes by FACS. A
representative FACS screen of bone marrow chimaera mice
is provided in Figure 1. For these experiments, a total of four
bone marrow treatment groups were compared. The two
experimental groups consisted of mice where MyD88 was
present in the CNS but not in bone marrow-derived cells (i.e.
KORWT; Group 1) and vice versa (i.e. WTRKO; Group 2),
whereas bone marrow transfers into genetically identical
mice (i.e. KORKO and WTRWT; Groups 3 and 4 respectively)
were also performed to rule out any non-specific effects of
ionizing radiation on the responses obtained. The latter could
be verified by confirming that the inflammatory profiles of
irradiated control groups obtained in the present study
(WTRWT and KORKO) were similar to those observed in
non-irradiated MyD88 WT and KO mice as reported recently
(Kielian et al., 2007). Although chimaeric mice were screened
at 8 weeks following bone marrow transfer, animals were not
infected with S. aureus until 10­12 weeks after transplanta-
tion. Any mice that demonstrated incomplete chimaerism
(i.e..10% residual recipient phenotype) were excluded from
the study.
As previously reported, MyD88 KO mice do not survive very
long following intracerebral S. aureus infection, with the
majority of animals succumbing within 24 h after bacterial
exposure with the infectious inoculum used in the earlier and
present studies (i.e. 104 CFUs) (Kielian et al., 2007). This fact
dictated the time course for analysing the current experi-
ments, since we were restricted by the survival time of mice
where MyD88 KO bone marrow was transferred into
irradiated MyD88 KO recipients (KORKO). Therefore we
examined the entire cohort of bone marrow chimaera animals
at two acute intervals, namely 18 and 24 h following S.
aureus infection. As shown in Figure 2, numerous pro-
inflammatory cytokines and chemokines were already
detected in WT control mice (WTRWT) at these early time
points and were significantly attenuated in MyD88 KO
control mice (KORKO) in agreement with our previous
report using non-irradiated animals (Kielian et al., 2007),
suggesting that the irradiation paradigm itself did not
significantly alter the inflammatory phenotype of MyD88
CNS MyD88 in brain abscesses

KO and WT mice. Next we assessed which of the experimental
chimaeras achieved cytokine expression profiles that were
equivalent to WT levels, which would implicate a compart-
mental-specific contribution for MyD88-dependent signals.
As shown in Figure 2, chimaeras where MyD88 was present in
the CNS but not in bone marrow-derived cells (KORWT) were
able to mount pro-inflammatory mediator expression profiles
equivalent to or exceeding those detected in WT mice at both
18 and 24 h post-infection. This finding implicates CNS
MyD88 as essential in eliciting the initial wave of inflam-
mation during the acute response to parenchymal infection.
In contrast, the inflammatory phenotype of chimaeric mice
where MyD88 was absent in the CNS compartment but
present in infiltrating bone marrow-derived cells (WTRKO)
was basically identical with MyD88 KO control mice (KORKO;
Figure 2). This finding reinforces the importance of MyD88 in
the brain to elicit an effective innate immune response to S.
aureus and that MyD88 originating from peripheral immune
cells alone is not sufficient to recover inflammatory mediator
expression to WT levels.
CNS MyD88 dictates the degree of neutrophil
influx into S. aureus-induced brain abscesses
Our previous study with MyD88 KO mice demonstrated that
neutrophil influx into brain abscesses was significantly
attenuated in these animals (Kielian et al., 2007). In the
present study, we examined whether MyD88 in the CNS or
peripheral immune cell compartment was important for
dictating neutrophil entry into the infected brain. For these
studies we utilized immunofluorescence staining and con-
focal microscopy with an S. aureus strain that constitutively
expresses GFP. Importantly, this S. aureus-GFP strain is

identical with the isolate used in our previous studies with
the exception of the GFP construct. As shown in Figure 3,
neutrophil influx was readily apparent in abscesses of WT
control mice (WTRWT), whereas very few cells could be
visualized in lesions of MyD88 KO control animals (KORKO),
in agreement with our previous report (Kielian et al., 2007). In
concordance with the finding that chemokine expression was
restored to WT levels in bone marrow chimaera where MyD88
was present in the CNS compartment (KORWT), significant
numbers of neutrophils were associated with brain abscesses
of these chimaeras, reaching levels that were equivalent to
WT mice (WTRWT; Figure 3). In contrast, minimal neutrophil
influx was detected in chimaeras where MyD88 was only
present in bone marrow-derived cells and absent in the CNS
(WTRKO; Figure 3). We did not perform quantitative
measurements of PMN (polymorphonuclear cell) infiltrates
by FACS in the various chimaera groups owing to limiting
numbers of mice. Collectively, these findings indicate that
MyD88 expression in resident CNS cells is critical for dictating
subsequent neutrophil efflux into the infected brain.
Importantly, these findings mirror chemokine expression
profiles (Figure 2), providing additional supportive evidence
for the important role of central MyD88 in initiating the
inflammatory cascade required for CNS amplification of
inflammatory networks to recruit peripheral anti-microbial
effector cells.
Neutrophil and microglia/macrophages occupy
distinct anatomical niches during S. aureus
infection in the CNS parenchyma
The use of a S. aureus-GFP isolate enabled us to evaluate the
cell type(s) intimately associated with bacteria in the CNS
parenchyma. A consistent trend surfaced where neutrophils
were in direct contact with bacteria (Figure 4), whereas
microglia/macrophages were never found associated with S.
aureus, but rather were physically removed from the bacteria
and localized along the abscess margins. The physical locales
of these cell types are probably attributed to their effector
functions during brain abscess development. For example,
neutrophils are essential for controlling bacterial burdens and
the extent of brain abscess dissemination (Kielian et al.,
Figure 2 MyD88 in the CNS compartment is important for regulating pro-inflammatory mediator expression in brain abscesses
Abscess homogenates from MyD88 bone marrow chimaeras (n54­6 mice per group) were prepared at 18 or 24 h following S. aureus
infection, whereupon inflammatory mediator expression was analysed at the protein level using multi-plex microbead arrays.
Mediator levels were normalized to the amount of total protein to account for differences in tissue sampling size. Significant
differences between chimaera groups were determined by one-way ANOVA followed by the Holm­Sidak method for multiple pair-
wise comparisons and are denoted with asterisks (*P,0.05; **P,0.001). Results are representative of three independent experiments.

along the abscess margins (Flaris and Hickey, 1992; Kielian et
al., 2008).
Lack of MyD88 expression in the CNS
compartment leads to elevated S. aureus burdens
We next examined whether MyD88 expression in CNS
parenchymal compared with infiltrating immune cells
influences S. aureus survival in the brain. Interestingly,
although no significant differences in bacterial burdens were
observed at 18 h post-infection, a significant increase in S.
aureus titres was detected in chimaeric animals where MyD88
was absent in the CNS but present in bone marrow-derived
cells (WTRKO) at 24 h following bacterial exposure
(Figure 5). This finding is in agreement with the fact that
pro-inflammatory mediator production was depressed in
MyD88 WTRKO chimaeras compared with KORWT and

Bone marrow chimaera mice (n54­6 per group) received an intracerebral infection with a S. aureus-GFP strain (green) and were

sections were prepared throughout the entire abscess, subjected to immunofluorescence staining for the neutrophil marker Gr-1
(red), and imaged by confocal microscopy (magnification, 406). Nuclei were visualized by DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole)
staining (blue). Significant numbers of neutrophils can be visualized infiltrating brain abscesses of WTRWT and KORWT chimaeras.

WTRWT animals; however, it is intriguing that elevated
bacterial burdens were not also observed in MyD88 KO
controls, although the latter is in agreement with our
previous findings (Kielian et al., 2007). It is not clear what
mechanism(s) are responsible for enhanced bacterial burdens
in MyD88 WTRKO chimaeras, but one possibility could relate
to the recent observation that some bacterial species possess
homologues of the TIR (Toll/IL-1 receptor) domain to subvert
host defences (Cirl et al., 2008), and it is conceivable that this
mechanism could result in the failure to contain bacterial
burdens in the presence of MyD88 WT leucocytes. An
alternative explanation is that MyD88-positive leucocytes
infiltrating the brain parenchyma do not receive a requisite
signal(s) from the brain microenvironment in the absence of
MyD88, culminating in ineffective bacterial neutralization.
These possibilities remain highly speculative at the present
time. Collectively, these results indicate that CNS-derived
MyD88 signals influence the efficacy of ensuing bactericidal
effector mechanisms.
Transcriptional profiling of MyD88 KO mice
following intracerebral S. aureus infection
reveals alterations in apoptosis regulatory
pathways
Previous studies with MyD88 KO mice in the experimental
brain abscess model revealed that, although these animals
were incapable of mounting a significant innate immune
response and experienced high mortality rates, paradoxically,
these mice did not exhibit significantly elevated bacterial
burdens as compared with WT animals (Kielian et al., 2007).
This finding demonstrated that bacterial burdens themselves
are not the sole determinant in dictating the extent of tissue
injury and/or mortality during brain abscess development. To
begin to dissect the potential mechanism(s) responsible for
the rapid decline of MyD88 KO mice following intracerebral S.
aureus infection, transcriptional profiling was performed.
Interestingly, only a small subset of genes was found to be
differentially expressed by microarray analysis and many of
these have been implicated in controlling apoptotic pathways
(i.e. Erdr1, Ier3, Pdap1, Calm2, Hspca, Mtch1, and Ifitm1 and
2; Table 1). Dysregulation of apoptotic pathways could
conceivably be responsible, in part, for the excessive tissue
destruction observed in MyD88 KO mice (Kielian et al., 2007),
where a combination of rampant necrotic and apoptotic
death leads to the destruction of infected and neighbouring
non-infected brain parenchyma respectively. In addition,
several genes detected by microarray analysis (i.e. CXCL1, IL-
1b) have previously been shown to be down-regulated in
brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice at the protein level
(Kielian et al., 2007), confirming the validity of the microarray
findings to accurately distinguish changes in gene expression
between the groups. However, to further confirm the
differential expression patterns detected by microarray
analysis, we selected a subset of genes for validation by
qRT-PCR. As shown in Figure 6, the expression patterns of the
five genes examined (Lcn2, SOCS3, Ier3, Pfc and Pascin3) were
in agreement with the microarray findings, indicating that
these genes may impact the differential outcome of S. aureus
infection and widespread parenchymal destruction in the
brains of MyD88 KO mice. It should be noted that the
relatively low number of differentially expressed genes
detected between MyD88 KO and WT mice is probably the
result of our experimental design. Namely, we elected to
perform microarrays on brain abscess RNA collected from
individual animals at each time point rather than pooling
RNA from a group of animals. We felt this was important to
account for biological variability between individual mice
and, as such, it is highly likely that the breadth of
differentially expressed genes was underestimated by this
approach. Collectively, these transcriptional profiling studies
suggest dysregulation of pro-inflammatory and apoptotic
genes in acute brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice. The
functional role for each of these molecules in contributing to
the excessive parenchymal destruction observed following S.
aureus infection in MyD88 KO mice remains to be determined.

immunofluorescence staining for the neutrophil or microglia/macrophage
markers Gr-1 and Iba-1 respectively (red), and imaged by confocal
microscopy (magnification, 406). Neutrophils are found to directly interact
with bacteria, whereas microglia/macrophage staining did not overlap with S.
aureus. Results are representative of two independent experiments.

DISCUSSION
MyD88-dependent signalling plays a pivotal role in regulating
the host innate immune response to bacterial infection (Akira
et al., 2006; Trinchieri and Sher, 2007). Not only is this
adaptor molecule central in the signalling of the majority of
TLRs, but also mediates activation through the IL-1R and IL-
18R (Wesche et al., 1997; Adachi et al., 1998; Burns et al.,
1998; Medzhitov et al., 1998). The importance of MyD88 in
the host response to infectious diseases has been highlighted
by several laboratories in diverse infectious disease models
(Takeuchi et al., 2000; Koedel et al., 2004; Miller et al., 2006;
Fremond et al., 2007).
Our recent study demonstrated that MyD88 KO mice
displayed global defects in innate immunity following
intracerebral S. aureus infection as typified by the dramatic
reduction in pro-inflammatory cytokine and chemokine
expression and the inability to recruit significant numbers
of neutrophils and macrophages from the periphery (Kielian
et al., 2007). One main question that remained to be
answered was how important is MyD88 in the CNS
compartment? Does CNS MyD88 expression play a role in
shaping the subsequent innate immune response following
bacterial infection in the brain or are infiltrating leucocytes
alone sufficient for establishing immunity? This issue could
not be resolved in our previous study since MyD88 was
globally absent in MyD88 KO mice and the fact that the brain
abscess model is complicated by the involvement of both
activated CNS-resident and infiltrating immune cells both of
which express this adaptor molecule (Kielian, 2004; Stenzel et
al., 2005; Kielian et al., 2007). This conundrum was addressed
in the present study by generating radiation bone marrow
chimaera mice where MyD88 was specifically expressed in
either CNS-resident cells or peripheral bone marrow-derived
leucocytes.
The results from MyD88 bone marrow chimaera mice were
rather unexpected given the essential nature of MyD88-
Figure 5 Lack of MyD88 expression in the CNS compartment leads to
elevated S. aureus burdens
Abscess homogenates from MyD88 bone marrow chimaeras (n54­6 mice per
group) were prepared at 18 or 24 h following S. aureus infection, whereupon
the number of viable bacteria were determined by quantitative plate assays.
Significant differences between chimaera groups were determined by one-
way ANOVA followed by the Holm­Sidak method for multiple pair-wise
comparisons and are denoted with asterisks (**P,0.001). Results are
representative of three independent experiments.

MyD88 KO and WT mice (n54­5 per group) were infected with S. aureus intracerebrally and euthanized at 12 or 24 h, whereupon
total RNA was isolated and evaluated for a subset of genes determined to be differentially expressed by microarray analysis using
qRT-PCR. Genes analysed included Lcn2, SOCS3, Ier3, Pfc and Pascin3. Gene expression levels were calculated after normalizing
target signals against the housekeeping gene GAPDH and are presented as the change in mRNA expression compared with
uninfected animals (mean¡S.D.). Significant differences in gene expression levels between MyD88 KO and WT mice are denoted
with asterisks (*P,0.05). Results are representative of two independent experiments examining a total of 8­10 individual animals.

dependent signalling in peripheral leucocyte activation and
the fact that these cells represent the major infiltrate
associated with evolving brain abscesses (Kielian, 2004).
Indeed, studies by our group and others have shown that
neutrophils constitute the main cell type associated with
brain abscesses during the early stage of infection (Kielian et
al., 2001; Stenzel et al., 2005; Kielian et al., 2007). In essence,
our results demonstrated that MyD88 expression in CNS-
resident cells, not bone marrow-derived cells, was essential
for inducing maximal cytokine/chemokine expression since
levels were restored to those observed in WT-infected animals
only in MyD88 KORWT chimaeras. In contrast, animals where
MyD88 was present in bone marrow-derived cells, but not the
CNS (i.e. WTRKO) did not display WT mediator expression.
However, the finding that some inflammatory molecules were
more highly expressed in WTRKO chimaeras compared with
MyD88 KO controls (i.e. KORKO) suggests a minor
contribution for peripheral MyD88 in shaping the innate
immune response during the first 24 h following S. aureus
infection. It should be acknowledged that we cannot discount
a potential role for MyD88 expression in the periphery during
later stages of infection. In fact, this possibility appears likely
since resident CNS cells (i.e. microglia and astrocytes),
although immune competent, have relatively poor bacter-
icidal activity compared with professional phagocytes (i.e.
neutrophils and macrophages). In addition, since many gene
products driven by MyD88 impact bacterial survival [i.e. iNOS
(inducible NO synthase), ROI (reactive oxygen intermediates)
and cytokines] it is likely that, with time, MyD88 signals
originating from bone marrow-derived leucocytes may
become more important in regulating anti-bacterial immun-
ity in brain abscesses. However, this possibility could not be
examined in the current study due to the short survival
period of infected MyD88 KO mice.
A similar requirement for MyD88 expression in the CNS
compartment was observed when evaluating neutrophil
influx into the infected brain. Specifically, WT levels of
neutrophil recruitment were only observed in chimaeras with
MyD88 expression in the brain parenchyma (i.e. KORWT).
This finding probably stems from the fact that the expression
of neutrophil chemokines was also restored to WT levels in
these chimaeras. It is important to note that radiation bone
marrow chimaera studies are not without potential caveats.
For example, irradiation has been shown to induce transient
blood­brain barrier compromise and the expression of several
pro-inflammatory mediators (Belka et al., 2001; Diserbo et al.,
2002; Li et al., 2004; Linard et al., 2004). The likelihood that
these factors influenced the results obtained in the present
study is minimized by the fact that chimaeras were not
infected with S. aureus until 8 weeks post-transplant. Indeed,
a recent report has demonstrated that pro-inflammatory
molecule expression was similar between radiation chimaera
and non-irradiated mice in response to intracerebral LPS
(lipopolysaccharide) (Turrin et al., 2007). It has been
suggested that irradiation serves to condition the CNS for
subsequent colonization by bone marrow-derived cells that
eventually transition into microglia-like cells, although some
controversy with regard to this latter point still exists
(Simard et al., 2006; Ajami et al., 2007; Mildner et al.,
2007; Davoust et al., 2008). Therefore it is possible that a
minor percentage of parenchymal microglia in the present
study originated from bone marrow precursors since we did
not shield the head during the irradiation procedure;
nonetheless, our results clearly demonstrate an essential role
for MyD88 expression by CNS-resident cells in eliciting
protective immunity during early stages of brain abscess
development.
To further investigate the potential pathway(s) affected by
MyD88 loss during early brain abscess development, micro-
array analysis was performed. Interestingly, many genes that
were differentially expressed in MyD88 KO mice were related
to apoptosis, which may be due, in part, to the inability to
trigger NF-kB (nuclear factor kB) activation, a well known
survival signal (Van Antwerp et al., 1996; Li et al., 1999). One
such gene was Ier3 (IEX-1), a stress-inducible gene that is
rapidly up-regulated in response to a variety of factors
including infection, inflammatory cytokines, and transcrip-
tion factors such as NF-kB (Pietzsch et al., 1997;
Domachowske et al., 2000; Arlt et al., 2008). Indeed, a
previous study has demonstrated that IEX-1 expression is NF-
kB- and TNF-a-dependent (Osawa et al., 2003) and, since
both molecules are significantly attenuated in MyD88 KO
mice, this is in agreement with the reduction in IEX-1 levels
detected by microarray in these animals. Although IEX-1 has
been shown to play a pivotal role in promoting cell survival in
response to stress (Wu et al., 1998; Garcia et al., 2002; Mittal
et al., 2006), its functional impact on cell survival remains
controversial and probably depends on cell type, stimulus,
and expression levels (Arlt et al., 2001; Schilling et al., 2001;
Osawa et al., 2003). Interestingly, a previous study has
demonstrated that IEX-1 reduces ROS (reactive oxygen
species) production (Shen et al., 2006) and, by extension,
attenuated IEX-1 levels in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice
could conceivably exacerbate ROS accumulation contributing
to the massive tissue damage observed in these animals.
However, these possibilities remain speculative at the present
time.
Another gene that was significantly down-regulated in
brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice is Lcn2 [also referred to as
NGAL (neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin)]. Similar to
IEX-1, Lcn2 has also been implicated in regulating apoptosis
and is produced by numerous cell types including macro-
phages and neutrophils in response to infection (Kjeldsen et
al., 1993; Devireddy et al., 2001; Tong et al., 2005; Lee et al.,
2007). Therefore, in the context of our brain abscess model, it
is likely that reduced Lcn2 expression in MyD88 KO mice
resulted from the fact that neutrophil and macrophage
infiltrates are decreased approx. 85% and 15% respectively,
compared with WT animals as we previously reported (Kielian
et al., 2007). In addition, a previous study has demonstrated
that Lcn2 is induced in macrophages in response to heat-
killed group B Streptococcus via a TLR2-dependent manner,

87
implying a role for TLRs in Lcn2 induction (Draper et al.,
2006). Obviously, TLR2-mediated signalling is ablated in
MyD88 KO mice, suggesting that this may represent one
mechanism by which Lcn2 expression is reduced during brain
abscess formation in these animals. Another gene whose
expression was decreased in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO
animals was properdin. Properdin activates the alternative
pathway of complement by assembling the C3 convertase on
target surfaces (Kemper and Hourcade, 2008). Properdin is
capable of binding to bacteria to engage the alternative
complement pathway and its importance in host defence is
illustrated by the enhanced sensitivity of properdin-deficient
patients to meningococcal disease (Densen et al., 1987;
Emonts et al., 2003). Unlike most complement components,
properdin is produced by neutrophils and macrophages
(Schwaeble et al., 1994; Wirthmueller et al., 1997) and the
fact that the influx of both of these cell types is significantly
attenuated in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice (Kielian et
al., 2007) probably explains the reduction in properdin levels
observed in these animals. Another gene that was attenuated
in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice was SOCS3, which is a
negative regulator of cytokine signalling elicited by JAK
(Janus kinase)/STAT (signal transducer and activator of
transcription), as well as TLR signalling pathways (Dimitriou
et al., 2008). It is interesting to note that SOCS3 has been
reported to block IL-10 production, as well as induce classical
macrophage activation (Dimitriou et al., 2008; Liu et al.,
2008). Our previous study demonstrated that macrophages
and microglia isolated from brain abscesses of MyD88 KO
mice expressed equivalent levels of IL-10 compared with WT
cells, and this fact could be explained by the reduction in
SOCS3 levels observed here. In addition, TNF-a has been
reported to stabilize SOCS3 mRNA expression (Ehlting et al.,
2007), and the failure to induce significant TNF-a expression
in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice could be another factor
contributing to reduced SOCS3 levels in these animals.
Importantly, our microarray analysis revealed several genes
that we have previously reported to be significantly
attenuated in brain abscesses of MyD88 KO mice at the
protein level including IL-1b and CXCL1 (KC) (Kielian et al.,
2007). This provides further confidence in the accuracy of our
microarray analysis. Collectively the propensity of apoptosis-
related genes that are differentially expressed in brain
abscesses of MyD88 KO mice is highly suggestive that the
expansive tissue damage that occurs in these animals is
influenced by accelerated/dysregulated apoptotic pathways.
This possibility remains to be directly tested in future studies
with MyD88 KO mice in the brain abscess model.
One important point to emphasize is that, although we
have identified a critical role for MyD88 in the CNS
compartment during the early phase of S. aureus infection,
several outstanding questions remain. The first is that we
cannot determine whether MyD88 mediates its effects
through TLRs or the IL-1R or IL-18R since all of these
molecules utilize this signalling adaptor. This is important
since earlier studies from our laboratory have revealed a
pivotal role for IL-1 in innate immunity to CNS S. aureus
infection (Kielian et al., 2004a). A second issue relates to the
target cells in the brain where MyD88 expression is
important. Likely candidates include microglia and astrocytes
since both cell types are capable of recognizing S. aureus via
a MyD88-dependent mechanism leading to pro-inflammatory
mediator release (Esen and Kielian, 2006; T. Kielian,
unpublished data). Regardless, the findings of the present
study highlight a novel mechanism for CNS-resident cells in
initiating a protective innate immune response in the
infected brain and, in the absence of MyD88 in this
compartment, immunity is compromised.
