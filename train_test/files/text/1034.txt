Abstract
This paper uses the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS) to analyse
the dynamics of moonlighting by the working-age population. We find that
moonlighting is transitory and that a desire to switch jobs expressed in the past
is positively related to moonlighting in the present and to actual job changes in
the future. We also find that workers who moonlighted as self-employed in the
past represent 26.5 percent of the new self-employed. These results suggest that
moonlighting in Russia can be seen as an effective incubator for setting up new
self-employed businesses, thereby providing long-term benefits for the economy.

1. Introduction
Existing studies suggest that the informal economy in Russia is large. For
example, focusing on the relationship between output and aggregate electricity
consumption, Johnson et al. (1997) argue that the informal economy in Russia
amounted to 41.6 percent of total gross domestic product (GDP) in 1995. Using
households' electricity rather than aggregate consumption, Lacko (2000) provides
estimates similar to those in Johnson et al. (1997). Although it provides much lower
estimates of the size of the informal economy, the Russian State Committee on
Statistics (Goskomstat) admits that the Russian informal economy is large and
growing fast. According to its estimates, the share of the informal economy in
GDP increased from 13 percent in 1993 to 23 percent in 1996 (Goskomstat,
1999).
In this paper, we define the informal economy as those legal production
activities which should be registered with the relevant authorities by employers
or self-employed, but are not, as well as those for which no registration
requirements actually exist (the production of goods and services aimed
primarily at generating employment and income for the households concerned).
Although in theory the nation's GDP should include value added produced in
the informal economy, in practice it does not because of measurement problems.
Consequently, the authorities are unable to impose taxes on informal economy
activities.2
In transition economies in general, and more specifically in Russia, informal
economy activities are largely made up of moonlighting activities (second job
holdings), and most moonlighting activities take place in the informal economy.
According to the VCIOM data, moonlighting represents about 70 percent of
Russian households' money income from the informal economy.3 Moreover,
using the same dataset, Kim (2002) found that in November 1998, 78 percent of
2 The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD, 2002) defines the non-
observed economy as those activities which should be included in a nation's GDP, but are in fact not
covered in the statistical surveys or administrative records used in the compilation of the National
Accounts. The non-observed economy is made up of the following three components: the underground
economy that produces legal goods and services but conceals production activities deliberately in order
to avoid paying taxes or social security contributions; the illegal economy that produces or distributes
goods and services whose sale or possession is forbidden by laws; the informal economy that operates
usually at the household level and legally produces goods and services in order to generate employment
and income for the households concerned. Our definition of the informal economy is rather broader
than the OECD's definition: it includes both the underground and the informal economy categories defined
by the OECD.
3 The VCIOM data are based on a series of regular (mostly bi-monthly) cross-sectional household surveys
conducted since 1991 by the All-Russian Centre for Public Opinion Research (VCIOM is its Russian acronym).
For a detailed description of the VCIOM data, see Brainerd (1998).
The Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 3
all additional jobs in Russia were in the informal economy. In contrast, only
4.7 percent of total main jobs could be considered to be informal.4
Is the informal economy harmful for the economy as a whole? Some studies,
mainly based on aggregate data, suggest that it has negative effects. First, being
untaxed by nature, it prevents overall tax revenue from increasing as much as it
would if the activities undertaken in the informal economy were conducted in the
formal sector (Johnson et al., 1997). This is a significant limitation in transition
economies, where the government needs to generate revenue to improve the social
security system and the quality of public services. Second, because of its low
productivity and high transaction costs, the informal economy is likely to restrict
economic growth (Loayza, 1996). Third, as argued by Lacko (2000), it is harmful
for the private sector growth, which is regarded as an engine of economic growth
in transition countries (Blanchard, 1997). Fourth, increases in income inequality in
transition economies are found to be positively associated with informal economy
activities (Rosser et al., 2000, 2003).5 All these arguments suggest that the Russian
economy has been badly hit by its soaring informal economy activities: weak
economic growth, a persistent public budget deficit, and rising income inequality
can all be seen as direct consequences of these activities. Thus, policies aiming at
shrinking the size of the informal economy are particularly desirable.
However, an important disadvantage of the use of aggregate data for the study
of the informal economy is widely recognized. These data can only show the
overall picture without proper differentiation between the various types of informal
economy activities (Thomas, 1992; Levenson and Maloney, 1998; Schneider and
Enste, 2000). Given that the motivations for undertaking informal economy activities,
as well as their effects, are extremely different depending upon the various types of
such activities, failing to allow for heterogeneity across different kinds of informal
economy activities could lead to gross and possibly misleading simplification of
their motives and effects.
Research using micro-level data such as household budget surveys, enterprise
surveys and labour force surveys has attempted to analyse particular sectors of
the informal economy in transition countries.6 Most microdata-based studies of
the Russian informal economy have used household budget surveys (Braithwaite,
4 In Russia, a primary (main) job is usually seen as the place where a person keeps his/her labour book ­
a document that traces the `official' work history and salaries. Primary jobs are also in many cases connected
with benefits such as medical and pension rights. In this regard, it is reasonable to assume that secondary
jobs (moonlighting activities) are generally `unreported', and are, therefore, part of the informal economy.
5 Rosser et al. (2000) use aggregate data on income inequality and the size of the informal economy in
transition countries and analyse a simple correlation between the two variables. They find that the coefficient
of correlation between the level of the Gini coefficient (used as a proxy for inequality) and the share of the
informal economy in 1993­94 is 0.76 and conclude that the larger the informal economy, the higher the
income inequality. This conclusion is confirmed in Rosser et al. (2003), where a multiple regression
framework based on data from 18 transition economies is used.

1994; Foley, 1997; Kolev, 1998; Clarke, 1999) to study moonlighting. The studies
generally confirm one of the findings based on aggregate data: the informal
economy in Russia is positively associated with income inequality.
The main contribution of our paper is that it uses microdata to focus on an
important dimension of the Russian informal economy, namely dynamics. This
aspect has been largely neglected by the existing studies on moonlighting, which
generally only show snapshot pictures of moonlighting, without looking at its
changing nature. Although Klopov (1996) put forward the idea that moonlighting
has a positive role in smoothing labour market transitions, the hypothesis has never
been tested empirically. Understanding the dynamics of informal economy activities
is extremely important for the implications it has on the economy as a whole. As
Asea (1996) and Foley (1997) suggest, what matters for the economy as a whole is
whether informal economy activities can evolve into formal activities, after having
allowed participants in the informal economy to sufficiently develop their human
capital. If this is the case, then the informal economy may provide a dynamic outlet
for entrepreneurial talent, which can lead to a better formal economy as part of a
natural evolution (Asea, 1996; Levenson and Maloney, 1998). This positive effect of
the informal economy may offset the negative effects mentioned previously.
In this paper, we will try to answer the following questions: Are there frequent
bi-directional movements between the formal and informal economies in Russia?
For what purposes do people use informal jobs? Are such purposes associated with
the enhancement of human capital? Is there any evidence that previous participants
in the informal economy subsequently become registered self-employed workers
or entrepreneurs? We will attempt to answer these questions by focusing on
moonlighting, which represents an important component of the informal economy
in Russia. More specifically, we will assess the degree of persistence of moonlighting
and evaluate the rate of conversion of secondary jobs into primary jobs by analysing
the relationship amongst current moonlighting, past moonlighting, and the desire to
switch jobs, as well as the relationship amongst actual job changes, past moonlighting,
and the desire to switch jobs. We will use a nationally representative longitudinal
survey of Russian citizens, the Russian Longitudinal Monitoring Survey (RLMS)
for the years 1994 to 1998 and exploit its panel dimension.7
Our findings suggest that moonlighting is transitory: previous moonlighting
is negatively associated with present moonlighting. Moreover, an intention to shift
7 The RLMS is a panel household-based survey representative of the Russian Federation as a whole. See
Section 4 for more details on this survey. We limit our analysis to the period 1994­98 because, as we will
discuss in Section 5.4, this paper investigates among other things the extent to which moonlighting was
used by workers to smooth the transition towards a main job as self-employed. Self-employment was in
fact strongly discouraged until the late 1980s. With the transition towards a market economy, the share of
self-employed out of total employment increased substantially as households took advantage of the sudden
opening of these new but rather uncertain opportunities (Earle and Sakova, 1999, 2000). This process,
however, slowed down with the stabilization of the country which followed the 1998 crisis.
The Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 5
jobs has a positive impact on moonlighting. This may suggest that people who want
to switch jobs use moonlighting as an experiment, before making a full commitment
to another job. We also find that previous moonlighting and an intention to switch
jobs are positively associated with an actual job change. Finally, self-employment
is a popular choice as a main activity for previous moonlighters.
The structure of the paper is as follows. In Section 2, we review existing studies
on the determinants of moonlighting. In Section 3, we explain our methodological
framework and describe our estimation strategy. In Section 4, we present our dataset
and some descriptive statistics. Section 5 illustrates our empirical results about the
dynamics of moonlighting of the Russian working-age population. Section 6
presents our conclusions.
2. Existing work on moonlighting
A fairly large number of papers have been written on multiple job holding in
Western countries. One group of economists attempts to explain the motives for
moonlighting by looking at differences in returns between jobs in the formal sector
and jobs in the informal sector (Ehrlich, 1973; Shishko and Rostker, 1976; Conway
and Kimmel, 1998). If the latter jobs are associated with higher risk but higher
returns compared to the former, households will allocate some of their time to
jobs in the informal sector in order to maximize returns given risk. Another group
of economists emphasizes the importance of unemployment or, more generally,
working-hour constraints as causes of moonlighting (Shishko and Rostker, 1976;
Krishnan, 1990; Paxson and Sicherman, 1996; Ahn and Rica, 1997).8
Rose (1994) suggests that there are two major motives for moonlighting in
transition countries: survival and enterprising.9 In line with the first motive, Kim
(2005) argues that in Romania, moonlighting is driven by low income and by the
gap between the needed and the actual consumption levels. Similarly, Desai and
Idson (2000) claim that wage arrears, which increase the incidence of poverty, are
positively correlated with the probability of holding a secondary job in Russia. On
the other hand, Braithwaite (1994), Foley (1997), and Kolev (1998) find that wage
rates in secondary jobs in Russia are higher compared to those of primary jobs, and
that Russian households, which are not necessarily poor in terms of their income
from legal sources, tend to participate in the informal economy to further increase
their income. On the basis of surveys of households conducted in four Russian
8 For instance, Paxson and Sicherman (1996) argue that a full-time employee is subject to a working hour
constraint if he/she would like to work more, for instance because of a difficulty in making ends meet with
only the income from his/her primary job, but is not able to do it.
9 Enterprising is intended as the exploitation of opportunities. According to this motive, people moonlight
not out of necessity, but because they want to avoid paying taxes, or to use their human capital to exploit
the higher returns available in the informal economy, and hence to increase their income.

cities, Clarke (1999) claims that there is no correlation between economic hardship
and moonlighting. Similarly, using the RLMS, Foley (1997) and Kolev (1998)
suggest that higher education is positively correlated with holding a second job,
while the effect of primary job wages is either insignificant or very small in terms
of its magnitude. In line with the enterprising motive, their finding indicates that
relatively well-off workers hold additional jobs to further increase their income
without paying taxes, thereby increasing income inequality.
Other researchers have investigated further reasons why households might
hold multiple jobs. Guariglia and Kim (2004) find that moonlighting in Russia is a
self-insurance mechanism that can be used as an alternative to precautionary
saving to smooth consumption in the presence of fluctuating earnings. Commander
and Tolstopiatenko (1997) claim that the extent of moonlighting is also affected by
demand factors. A firm can choose whether to employ part-time informal labour
subject to some probability of being caught, or full-time formal labour that pays
payroll taxes. Their findings suggest that the allocation of workers across formal
full-time and informal part-time jobs depends on the scale of the subsidy provided
to formal sector workers.
3. Methodological framework
Let us denote by T the time available to an individual for work or leisure; by h1
and
h2
, the number of hours that he spends on his main and secondary jobs, respectively;10
by w1
and w2
, the hourly wages on his primary and secondary jobs, respectively;
by NLY, his non-labour income; and by Y, his total income.11 The individual's
utility function can be written as follows:
U = U(T - h1
- h2
, Y). (1)
The individual maximizes his utility function subject to the following constraints:
Y = w1
h1
+ w2
h2
+ NLY, and (2)
h1
 0, h2
 0. (3)
Because the budget constraint is satisfied with equality, the utility function can be
expressed as:
10 The word `he' will be used hereafter to refer to both genders.
11 Models similar to the one outlined in the succeeding discussion were used in Shishko and Rostker (1976),
Krishnan (1990), and Conway and Kimmel (1998). In our empirical analysis, we deflate all nominal variables
using price deflators based on September 1992 roubles.
The Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 7
U = U(T - h1
- h2
, w1
h1
+ w2
h2
+ NLY). (4)
We can define the marginal utility with respect to the secondary job working hours
as follows:
(5)
The first-order conditions for utility maximization can be obtained by setting
equation (5) equal to 0, and then solving it for the labour supply relative to
secondary jobs.
If we let P2
denote the decision to have a secondary job, the Kuhn­Tucker
slackness conditions yield the following:
(6)
Assuming that is a function of all the exogenous variables included in the
model, the following estimable participation equation can be derived:
P2,it
= Xit
+  ln w1,it
+  ln w
2,it
+  ln h1,it
+ vi
+ vt
+ eit
(7)
where Xit
is a vector of exogenous variables relative to individual i at time t, which
includes demographic, educational, and regional variables, as well as some variables
related to the individual's main job, such as wage arrears. w1,it
is the wage rate earned
by individual i at time t in his primary job, and w
2,it
the corresponding wage rate
earned in his secondary job, which, as described in Appendix 1, will be obtained
from the estimation of a wage rate equation using the Heckman (1976) procedure.12
The error term in equation (7) is made up of three components: a time-invariant
individual-specific effect (vi
), which can be viewed as a collection of factors that are
specific to the individual but are not included in Xit
; a time-specific effect (vt
), which
accounts for possible business cycle effects; and an idiosyncratic component (eit
).
In order to test whether moonlighting is persistent, we will add previous
moonlighting to the right-hand side of equation (7). In addition, we will test
whether moonlighting is positively associated with a desire to switch jobs by also
including a variable relating to the desire for a job change expressed in the previous
period as a regressor. We will, therefore, estimate the following extended equation:
12 As pointed out in Moffitt (1999), the Heckman procedure is extremely sensitive to the specification and
non-normality of the errors. We tested the robustness of our main results by estimating different versions
of all our equations, which omit the predicted variables. The results were very similar to those presented in
the paper and are not reported for brevity. They are, however, available from the authors upon request.

where P2,i(t-1)
denotes moonlighting for individual i at time t ­ 1, and di(t-1)
is a
dummy variable indicating whether respondent i expressed a desire to switch jobs
at time t ­ 1.
Equation (8) will be estimated using a random-effects Probit model. As the same
individual appears up to three times in the sample, the use of a random-effects
estimator will allow us to take into account unobserved heterogeneity (which
appears in the vi
component of the error term).13 We will take into account the vt
component of the error term by including time dummies in all specifications.
However, if the initial observation of moonlighting is correlated with the
individual-specific component of the error term, then the estimation of equation (8)
using a random-effects Probit specification is likely to lead to biased estimates.14
We will, therefore, also use an Instrumental Variable (IV) approach, where lagged
moonlighting will be instrumented using lagged local unemployment rates, lagged
broad categories of primary occupations (managerial, professional, non-manual
skilled, manual skilled, unskilled), lagged perceived economic rank,15 and time
dummies. These instruments are intended to capture both demand- and supply-side
aspects of moonlighting.
We will subsequently test whether job changes follow spells of moonlighting
and the declared intention to switch jobs. Following Roy (1951) and Lee (1978), the
decision to change jobs can be reached after comparing the relative earnings expected
in a new job and an old job with a certain `reservation' wage ratio. In particular, if
we denote by jc a binary choice variable indicating whether the individual changes
jobs or stays with his old job, by wn1
, the wage that would be received in a new main
job if jc = 1, by wo1
, the wage that would be received in the old main job if jc = 0,
and by , the ratio between the two corresponding reservation wages, then an
individual would change jobs (jc = 1) if the following equation holds:
13 Because the sample of individuals that we use in this paper is randomly drawn from a large population,
it is appropriate to use a random-effects model (Baltagi, 1995).
14 More generally, if there is a correlation between the regressors and the individual-specific component of
the error term, then one should treat the vi
component of the error term as fixed. However, in the Probit
case, because we cannot subtract the group means from all the variables and then work on the transformed
data, it would not be possible to obtain consistent estimates of the individual-specific component of the error
term under this scenario as the number of vi
s increases with the sample size. This is known as the incidental
parameters problem (see Neyman and Scott, 1948). To check the robustness of our main random-effects
Probit specification, we will use an alternative estimator, the conditional fixed-effects Logit estimator
(Chamberlain, 1980), which is a conditional maximum likelihood estimator, where the conditioning is
carried out with respect to a minimal sufficient statistic in order to eliminate the unobservable vi
s.
15 The perceived economic rank variable is based on the following question asked in the RLMS: `Imagine a
9-step ladder where on the bottom, the first step, stand the poorest people, and on the highest step, the 9th, stand the
rich. On which step are you today?'

is not directly observable. We will assume that it is a linear function of a set
of individual characteristics, Z. Substituting into (9) and rearranging yields the
following estimable equation:
(10)
where the first element will be estimated using the Heckman (1976) procedure, and
the last three elements represent the composite error term.
Finally, we will analyse which type of main job an individual chooses to hold
after a period of moonlighting. Main jobs are categorized as self-employed, paid,
or entrepreneurial jobs. The decision to acquire a self-employed main job is defined
by the binary choice variable, seit
, which is modelled as follows:

is the wage that individual i would get at time t in self-employment: it will be
estimated using the Heckman (1976) procedure. Kit
is a set of characteristics of
individual i at time t. The choice of having a paid job and engaging in entrepreneurial
activities as a main occupation will be estimated in a similar way. Both equations
(10) and (11) will be estimated using a random-effects probit model.
4. Data and descriptive statistics
The data used in this paper consist of rounds 5 to 8 of the Russian Longitudinal
Monitoring Survey (RLMS), corresponding to household and individual interviews
held in 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1998, respectively. The survey is based on a nationally
representative sample of several thousands of households across the Russian
Federation.16 The RLMS contains detailed information on households' income and
16 The RLMS is managed by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill Population Centre, in collaboration
with five agencies which include Paragon Research and the Russian Institute of Sociology. The surveys from
round 5 to round 8 took place in the following periods: November 1994­January 1995 for round 5, October­
December 1995 for round 6, October­December 1996 for round 7, and October 1998­January 1999 for round 8.
In round 5, a total of 3,973 households and 8,490 adult individuals (aged 18 or more) were interviewed.
The corresponding numbers in 1995, 1996, and 1998 were 3,781 and 8,059; 3,750 and 7,946; and 3,831 and
8,179. Detailed information on the structure of the survey, the questionnaires, and the data can be found at

(1999) for a comprehensive description of the dataset.

expenditure, as well as on individuals' demographic characteristics, education, and
labour force activities, including those related to secondary jobs. We restrict our
sample to adult individuals who have a main job.17 Given the fact that retirement
ages for Russian men and women are 60 and 55 years, respectively, we also restrict
our sample to individuals who are aged between 18 and 58 years for men, and
between 18 and 54 years for women.18
We classify an individual as holding multiple jobs if he answered `yes' to either
of the following questions:19
`Tell me please, do you have some other kind of work?'20 and
`Tell me please, in the last 30 days did you engage in some additional kind of work for
which you got paid? Maybe you sewed someone a dress, gave someone a ride in a car,
assisted someone with apartment or car repairs, purchased and delivered food, looked after
a sick person, or did something else that you were paid for?'
The first question refers to a paid secondary job while the second refers to the
so-called individual economic activities, which can be viewed as self-employment
17 Individuals who have a main job are those who did not answer `I do not work' to the survey question:
`Tell me please, do you now work, are you on paid or unpaid leave, or do you not work?'
18 We apply this specific restriction because we intend to avoid complications caused by moonlighting
close to retirement ages. Our results did not change if we considered a sample of men aged 18 to 60 years
old and women aged 18 to 55 years old. Note that by only considering workers far enough from retirement
age, only 17 men and 10 women were excluded.
19 One can distinguish moonlighters from multiple job holders: the former refer to people who hold a
secondary job while working on a full-time basis in their main job. The latter refer to workers who hold
several part-time jobs at the same time. According to our dataset, 78 percent of secondary job holders work
more than 40 hours per week in their main job. This indicates that participants in the Russian secondary job
market are, in general, moonlighters (that is full-time workers rather than part-timers in their main job). We
included a dummy variable for lagged moonlighting together with one for lagged multiple job holding in
our regression for present moonlighting. The coefficients on both dummy variables were negative and
precisely determined. Moreover, the difference between the coefficients on the two variables was not
statistically significant (2(1) = 0.56, P-value 0.45). In the remaining part of this paper, we therefore use the
terms moonlighting and multiple job holding interchangeably.
20 This first question was only asked to those respondents who, earlier in the questionnaire, reported
having a main job. It was followed by other questions about the type of this secondary occupation and the
characteristics of the enterprise/organization at which it was held, in terms of number of employees,
ownership structure, and so on. These additional questions indicate that the secondary jobs referred to are
more formal compared to the Individual Economic Activities (IEAs) to which the next question refers. Also
note that, in our sample, these secondary jobs represent about 37 percent of the additional jobs held by
Russian employees, whereas the IEAs represent the remaining 63 percent. The VCIOM data show that some
individuals hold more than one secondary job: in November 1997, 14 percent and 10 percent of moonlighters
held two second jobs and more than two second jobs, respectively. Unfortunately, the RLMS does not
provide accurate information on the number of second jobs held by moonlighters.

activities.21 In order to be classified as holding multiple jobs, an individual
also needs to state that he worked a positive number of hours in the last
30 days on his additional job, and that he received a positive wage payment on that
job.22
Although the second question on second-job holding seems to refer to
unskilled types of occupations, the Russian labour market for moonlighting is not
dominated by low-skilled and less-educated workers. For example, according to
VCIOM data, 68 percent of the moonlighters declared that the qualifications
required for their additional job were higher or equal to those required in their
main job.
Table 1 reports variable means over the pooled sample for working-age popu-
lation, together with standard errors and the ranges of the variables. Compared to
non-moonlighters, multiple-job holders are slightly younger, more educated,
and have a somewhat shorter primary job tenure. Monthly working hours of
moonlighters in their main job are slightly lower than those of non-moonlighters,
and real wage rates of moonlighters in their primary jobs are very similar to those
of non-moonlighters. However, the moonlighters' real wage rates in the secondary
jobs are more than four times higher than the wage rates in their primary jobs.23
Regional differences are also noticeable: moonlighting is particularly high in
21 The VCIOM dataset provides detailed information on the types of second jobs, which can be associated
with self-employment (IEAs). According to the VCIOM, from 1994 to 1999, the most popular IEA was to
provide consumer services such as repair work (this activity represented 28 percent of the total of IEA-
type second jobs), followed by the sale of goods including shuttle trading (22 percent), professional work
(translating, computer programming, etc., 16 percent), personal services (baby-sitting, nursing, cooking etc.,
12 percent), private lessons (9 percent), business mediation (6 percent), production of consumer goods
(5 percent), and work in own shop, café, and kiosks (3 percent). The RLMS provides details for paid second
jobs. According to this dataset, the highest share of paid second jobs can be found in the occupational group
of professionals: 26 percent of the individuals holding paid second jobs work as professionals on their
second job. This is followed by the occupational group of plant and machine operators and assemblers (22
percent), unskilled occupations (19 percent), technical and associated professionals (14 percent), and service
and market workers (13 percent).
22 For self-employed workers, wages are meant as profits. Also note that the questions relative to IEAs and
paid secondary jobs are not defined using the same time frame. In particular, the question in the survey
relative to the latter variable asks whether a worker holds an additional paid job now, while the question
regarding IEAs refers to a second job held during the last 30 days. This is why in our analysis, we defined
a moonlighter as an individual who stated that he held an additional job (either paid or IEA-type), and who
received positive income and worked positive hours on that job during the last month. Therefore, an individual
who only started his last job now would not be considered as a moonlighter, as he would not have received
a positive income from that job, nor worked a positive number of hours on that job in the last month.
23 This comparison is based on money wages. Income in kind such as free or subsidized housing, health
care, and nursery facilities are widely available for main jobs. If those fringe benefits were included, the
difference between income from main jobs and secondary jobs would obviously become smaller. Friebel and
Guriev (1999) analyse the negative effect of in-kind payments from enterprises on job mobility. Higher risk
attached to secondary jobs and opportunities for using equipment available on main jobs can also explain
why workers hold main jobs in spite of their far lower wage rates.

metropolitan cities. As for main occupations, professionals, as well as crafts and
trade people, are highly active in holding multiple jobs.24
5. The dynamics of moonlighting: Empirical evidence
5.1 Is moonlighting persistent or transitory?
Given that moonlighting is highly associated with informal economy activities,
an important question that arises is whether it is persistent or transitory.
Persistent moonlighting suggests a limited rate of conversion of secondary jobs
into primary ones. Although their secondary job may provide a higher wage rate,
people may be reluctant to transform it into their primary occupation, because
of the risk attached to it. Only if they become sufficiently confident about their
secondary job will they transform it into their main occupation. Moreover, fringe
benefits and wage arrears associated with their main job may deter workers from
leaving it. Some moonlighting jobs may not be convertible to a main job because
the demand for the good or service produced in these jobs is not sufficient to
support full-time work, or because these are seasonal secondary jobs. In such cases,
individuals will continue to moonlight, thus moonlighting could be persistent. Finally,
moonlighters may be reluctant to convert their secondary job into their main job in
order to continue to avoid taxes on the income from their secondary job.
Table 2 presents a mobility matrix of moonlighting. The table shows that multiple-
job holding in Russia is not growing. The share of multiple-job holders as a proportion
of the working-age adult population was 12.1 percent in 1994. It decreased to 10.2 per-
cent in 1995 and stabilized at around 10 percent in 1996­98.25 This stable share can be
caused either by a frequent bi-directional movement between single-job holding and
multiple-job holding, or by persistent moonlighting activities by certain groups of
individuals. The table supports the former hypothesis, suggesting considerable mobility
between single-job and multiple-job holding. For example, new moonlighters, defined
as those who held a secondary job for the first time in the current year, amounted
to 57 percent of total moonlighters, in 1995, before declining to 38 percent in 1998.
The transitory nature of moonlighting can be more clearly shown by looking at
the conditional probability of continued moonlighting in the present period given
moonlighting in the previous round: this probability is fairly stable over the period
considered (37­38 percent). On the other hand, about 60 percent of the individuals
who engaged in moonlighting in the previous period return to holding only one
24 We used Hotelling's (1931) t-squared generalized means tests to see if the differences in the means of the
variables discussed in the text were statistically significant. All differences referred to were significant. We
did not present the tests for brevity.
25 The VCIOM data also suggest that there is little evidence of a significant increase in the number of multiple
job holders in the period 1994­99. According to the data, 14.2 percent of the adult population held a second
job from 1994 to 1999, and moonlighting amounted to 11 percent of the adult population in January 1999.

job in the present.26 Although these results do not control for other factors that can
influence moonlighting, they suggest that moonlighting is not persistent in Russia.
The table also shows that moonlighting becomes more persistent as the years of
moonlighting increase. The probability of holding multiple jobs after having
experienced moonlighting for the previous two and three rounds increases to
50­52 percent and 69 percent, respectively.
Although the analysis of the transition probabilities presented in Table 2 suggests
the transitory nature of moonlighting, the result is only indicative because no controls
are included. As we discussed in Section 3, we now estimate the following model:
P2,it
= Xit
+  ln w1,it
+  ln w
2,it
+  ln h1,it
+ P2,i(t-1)
+ vi
+ vt
+ eit
(12)
where i indexes individuals and t indexes time,27 P2,it
represents moonlighting in the
current round, and P2,i(t-1)
is moonlighting in the previous round. Xit
is a vector of socio-
economic variables, which includes demographic, educational, and regional variables, w1,it
is the wage rate in the main job, w
2,it
is the predicted wage rate in the secondary job,28 h1,it
represents working hours on the main job, vi
, vt
and eit
make up the composite error terms.
Our primary concern is to investigate the extent to which previous moonlighting
is associated with present moonlighting. For this purpose, we restrict our sample
to respondents who moonlighted at least once before the present period. To give
some indication of the duration of moonlighting, we also include in our specification
two new dummy variables, one indicating whether the individual moonlighted in
the previous two rounds, and another indicating whether he moonlighted in the
previous three rounds. We estimate our equation for the probability of moonlighting
at time t using a random-effects probit specification.
The results, reported in column 1 of Table 3, show that the coefficient on the
estimated secondary job wage rate is positive and highly significant, suggesting
that higher wages are positively correlated with moonlighting. On the other hand,
the coefficients associated with the primary job wage and wage arrears are not
precisely determined.29 The coefficient on the variable indicating whether the
26 We tested for the equality between these two probabilities. The test statistic was t = 8.98 and the equality
was consequently rejected.
27 t refers to the rounds of the RLMS used in estimation. The available rounds are 5 to 8, but round 5 is lost
due to the presence of a lagged variable on the right-hand side of the estimating equation. Lagged variables
refer to variables in the previous round. Time dummies are included in all regressions.
28 The predicted secondary job wage rate is obtained using the Heckman (1976) procedure, which corrects
for self-selection bias. See Appendix 1 for details on the calculation of this predicted wage.
29 These results are different from those obtained by Desai and Idson (2000). This is because the sample that
we use in our study when we analyse the determinants of moonlighting is different from the sample that
they use. Because we focus on the dynamics of moonlighting while Desai and Idson (2000) investigate the
determinants of moonlighting in a static context, we have to restrict our sample to respondents who
moonlighted at least once before the present period. In contrast, Desai and Idson (2000) use a larger sample
regardless of moonlighting experience. Furthermore, we use a random-effects probit specification while
Desai and Idson (2000) and other researchers generally use pooled cross-section regressions.

The Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 21
individual experienced moonlighting in the previous period is precisely deter-
mined and its coefficient is negative. This implies that previous moonlighting is
negatively associated with the probability of holding multiple jobs in the present
period. In other words, in Russia, moonlighting is transitory rather than persistent.30
In contrast, the positive and significant coefficients on the variables indicating
whether the individual moonlighted in the two and three previous rounds suggest
that the longer the period in which the individual engaged in moonlighting, the
less likely he is to return to single-job holding.31
One problem with these estimates is that they could be biased if the initial
observation of moonlighting is correlated with the individual-specific component
of the error term. In column 2 of Table 3, we use an Instrumental Variable (IV)
approach, which helps us to control for this problem. As we discussed previously,
we instrument the previous moonlighting variable using lagged regional
unemployment rates, lagged primary job categories, and lagged perceived
economic rank. The coefficient on previous moonlighting is once more negative
and precisely determined. To check for instrument validity, we performed a test
as in Nickell and Nicolitsas (1999): we regressed our previous moonlighting
variable on all the exogenous variables plus all the remaining instruments, using a
random-effects specification. We then tested for the joint significance of the
latter instruments, using a Wald test. The statistic suggests that the instruments are
indeed valid [2(13) = 105.81, P-value: 0.0].32
We check the robustness of our results in three ways. First, one could argue that
the inclusion of a generated regressor such as the predicted second job wage in our
moonlighting regression might result in biased standard errors. In addition, given
the fact that the RLMS is based on a stratified sampling procedure starting from the
primary sampling units (PSUs), clustering can also have an impact on the standard
errors.33 The first column of Table A3 in Appendix 2 presents the estimation results
30 Note that spells of moonlighting that are completed quickly have a lower probability of still being in
existence when the stock of persons currently moonlighting is observed, whereas longer spells have a higher
probability of appearing in the sample. This problem is known as `length-biased sampling' (Kiefer, 1988).
The possibility of a return of a moonlighter to holding one job between the surveys actually reinforces our
finding that moonlighting is transitory in Russia.
31 It has to be noted, however, that very few people moonlighted in the two or three previous rounds. Table
2 shows that in 1998, there were 367 moonlighters, 69 of which had also moonlighted in the previous round 35
of which had moonlighted in the previous two rounds; and only 22 of which had moonlighted in the
previous three rounds.
32 Although this joint significance test only tells us that the instruments are good predictors of lagged
moonlighting, we also think that they can be reasonably excluded from the present moonlighting equation,
as they are lagged one period. It makes sense to assume that lagged unemployment rates, lagged primary job
categories, and lagged economic rank perceived by the individual are strongly related with past moonlighting,
but not as strongly with present moonlighting. Dynan (2001) used a similar approach to estimate a consumption
growth equation with lagged consumption growth as a regressor.
33 For a description of the multilevel probability sample design of the RLMS, see Gregory et al. (1999). For
an analysis of the impact of clustering on standard errors, see Deaton (1997).
22 Guariglia and Kim
of our moonlighting equation once the generated variable bias and clustering are
taken into account.34
Second, we check whether the fact that we only use individuals who have
positive income and have worked for positive hours in the last 30 days generates
a sample-selection problem. We therefore use a larger sample of the Russian adult
population that comprises both working individuals and individuals on leave.
Note that non-working individuals cannot be included in the sample because the
question on additional paid jobs is only asked to individuals who have a working
status.35 The result of the estimation of equation (12) based on the larger sample is
presented in the second column of Table A3.36
Lastly, following Chamberlain (1980), a conditional fixed-effects logit model
is used as an alternative method of estimation. An advantage of this method of
estimation is that it allows the regressors and the individual-specific component of
the error term to be correlated. A disadvantage is that all time invariant variables
have to be dropped from the estimation. In addition, all the individuals for whom
the dependent variable is either always 0 or always 1 are dropped from the sample
used in estimation. Finally, the precision of some variables whose variance is
negligible across time is compromised. Column 3 of Table A3 shows the results
using this alternative estimation method.
The three columns of Table A3 show that in all cases the coefficient on the
previous moonlighting variable is negative and statistically significant. This
suggests that correcting the standard errors for clustering or generated variable
bias, using an extended sample, and using a different estimation method do not
affect our main results.
Given this transitory nature of moonlighting, three further interesting questions
arise. Is moonlighting associated with the desire for a job shift? Do job changes
effectively occur after moonlighting and a declared intention to switch jobs? What
primary occupation do previous moonlighters choose? We analyse these issues
in turn.
34 In order to take clustering and the generated regressor bias into account, the following procedure was
used: first, a random sample of similar size to the original sample was drawn with replacement from the
observed sample; second, the relevant regression was estimated on this new sample using the Stata
`svyprobit' command, with the option psu, in order to take clustering into account; third, the procedure was
replicated 1,000 times and bootstrapped standard errors were calculated from the distribution of each of the
1,000 estimated parameters obtained in these replications. Note that bootstrapping the standard errors is
specifically aimed at correcting for the generated variable bias.
35 Individuals subject to wage arrears who were not paid their wage at all during the month prior to
interview are also excluded from the sample used in estimation, as their primary job wage is recorded as
missing. According to the VCIOM, however, in 1997 only 11 percent of the workers who suffered from wage
arrears in the previous month did not receive any wage at all. The majority of workers subject to wage
arrears received partial wages and are therefore included in our sample.
36 The unpaid leave variable which we included in this specification is insignificant. This can be seen as
further evidence that moonlighting is not associated with hardship faced by the individuals.
The Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 23
5.2 Is moonlighting associated with the desire for a job shift?
We initially test whether an individual's intention to switch jobs has an impact on
his probability to hold an additional job. The intention of making a job switch is
inferred from the answer given to the following question:
`Would you like to find different work?'
The responses are coded as 1 if the respondent answers `yes' and 0 if the
respondent answers `no'. We use the first lag of the variable quantifying the
intention to make a job switch, along with all other variables used in the regressions
reported in the first two columns of Table 3 as independent variables in a random-
effects probit model for the probability of moonlighting in the present. We use the
lagged intention to make a job change to explain current period moonlighting
because it is reasonable to assume that people take some time before they start
to moonlight with a view to implementing their intention to switch jobs.37 In
addition, the use of the first lag of the variable relative to the individual's intention
to change jobs avoids possible endogeneity biases that may arise when using the
contemporaneous variable.
The results are presented in column 3 of Table 3. The coefficient associated
with the variable indicating the intention of a job switch proves to be positive and
statistically significant.38 A possible explanation for this finding could be that
moonlighting in Russia is used as a mechanism that enables workers to experiment
with a different job, instead of immediately shifting to it. Moonlighting can, in fact,
reduce the risk attached to a job change in two ways. First, it can make a reversal
less costly when the prospects of the job tried turn out not to be bright. In such a
way, moonlighting can help those individuals for whom changing jobs at once
would be too costly and risky, to start a new job or business more smoothly.
Second, it provides a period for obtaining the necessary skills and information. If
37 Note that a lag of one year does not necessarily mean that the respondent starts moonlighting after one
full year: moonlighting can begin at any time between the previous round and the present round, but it is
just recorded in the present round survey. We checked whether our results are sensitive to which specific
lag is used on the variable relative to the desire of changing jobs in two ways. First, we used the variable
of an intention to change jobs lagged twice (instead of the same variable lagged once) as an explanatory
variable in our regression for present moonlighting. This allows for a longer time interval between the
intention and implementation. The coefficient and the t-value on the twice-lagged variable were 0.167 and
2.73, respectively. Second, we instrumented the variable relative to the intention for a job switch using
regional unemployment rates, job categories, and perceived economic ranks and used the first lag of the
predicted variable as a regressor. The coefficient on this predicted variable was still precisely determined
(coefficient: 0.247, t-value: 3.05).
38 As before, we checked the robustness of this result by using the extended sample and by taking clustering
and the generated regressor bias into account. We found that the coefficient on the variable relative to the
individual's intention to switch jobs was in both cases precisely determined and positive. We did not report
these results for brevity, but they are available upon request.
24 Guariglia and Kim
this interpretation were true, then moonlighting could be viewed as a `human
capital-enhancing activity'.39
5.3 Does a job change follow an intention to switch jobs and/or
previous moonlighting?
One may ask whether a declared intention to change jobs effectively ends in a job
switch, and whether previous moonlighting contributes to the switch. We estimate
equation (10) to test whether the prior intention to switch jobs and previous
moonlighting have a statistically significant effect on actual job changes.
Problematically, rounds 5 to 6 of the RLMS do not provide direct information on
whether the respondent changed jobs. Sabirianova (2002) attempted to trace
occupational mobility using the differences reported between rounds in the four-digit
International Standard Classification of Occupations (ISCO) codes, which are
available in the RLMS. Because of miscoding, however, she concluded that the result
was hardly convincing. For example, she found that 50.3 percent of employed
respondents changed their occupation between 1994 and 1995. We use an alternative
method, which can provide a more reliable estimate of actual job changes. Our
method is based on the answers given by respondents to the following question:
`Tell me, please, since what year and month have you been working at this place?'
We assume that a job change has occurred if the starting date of the current
job is later than that reported in the previous year survey.40 According to this
methodology, 20 percent of the respondents switched jobs between 1994 and 1995,
20 percent between 1995 and 1996, and 27 percent between 1996 and 1998. The last
two figures are fairly consistent with the subjective evaluations of job changes
provided in rounds 7 and 8, according to which 19.5 percent and 27.6 percent of
respondents declared to have changed their place of work over the periods
1995­96 and 1996­98, respectively.
39 Foley (1997) interprets his finding that secondary employment is most often in a different field than the
main occupation in a similar way as ours. He in fact claims that workers may be exploring possible career
shifts without having to make a full investment and leave their primary job.
40 In this case, the job switch obviously occurred between the date of the previous survey and that of the
present survey. We examined possible irregularities in the data and corrected them. For example, some
observations were recorded as job changes while the individual was on leave. These were corrected because
job changes are incompatible with paid/unpaid/maternity leave. We also looked at other information such
as the number of employees in the enterprise/organization before and after the job change in order to check
whether our variable of job change was reliable. One limitation with this methodology is that it can only
capture inter-firm occupational mobility, but not changes in a respondent's occupation within the place of
work. However, the number of respondents who switched jobs within the place of work is not large:
according to round 8 of the RLMS, which specifically asks about job changes, only 3.3 percent of respondents
said they had changed jobs while remaining within their place of work.
The Dynamics of Moonlighting in Russia 25
We now use the whole sample of working-age population because we deal with
actual job changes, which are not restricted to moonlighters. We first estimate the
wage rates of the new and old jobs using demographic, human capital, regional, and
occupational dummies as explanatory variables. The differences between estimated
wage rates at new and old jobs are incorporated as an independent variable in the
regression for actual job changes, the results of which are presented in Table 4.41
We find that an intention to change jobs expressed in the previous period is
positively associated with an actual job change. In addition, moonlighting in
the previous period is also positively associated with job changes, suggesting
that former moonlighters are more active in changing their jobs compared to
non-moonlighters.42 These findings may be explained by the fact that individuals
who desired to switch jobs used moonlighting as an experimental mechanism,
and actually changed their main job if the experiment was successful. We also find
that the coefficient associated with the wage gap variable is positive but not
precisely determined.43 A further interesting result, which is consistent with Earle
and Sabirianova (2002), is that wage arrears in the previous round are negatively
associated with job changes in the present round.44
5.4 Which primary occupation do previous moonlighters choose?
We now discuss which types of primary job people who have moonlighted in the
past and desired a job shift tend to choose in the present. In particular, we want to
41 For the sake of brevity, the results from the wage regressions, estimated using the Heckman (1976)
procedure, are omitted, but are available from the authors upon request.
42 We obtained similar results using the information on actual job changes derived from the direct question asked
in rounds 7 and 8. In other words, we combined job changes in round 6 measured indirectly using the
method explained in the text with data on actual job changes available from the RLMS in rounds 7 and 8. In
this case, the coefficient and t-value on the dummy indicating the intention to switch jobs were respectively
equal to 0.498 and 9.99, and those on the previous moonlighting dummy were respectively 0.156 and 2.02.
43 There may be cases in which workers who switch jobs end up with new jobs requiring lower qualifications
than their old jobs. These types of job switches are likely to be involuntary. They may occur, for instance,
as a consequence of the loss of the employee's main job. In these cases, the employee may be left with little
choice, apart from taking an unskilled job. This may justify why the coefficient on the wage gap variable
in the job change regression is positive but not statistically significant: voluntary movers exploiting
higher wages on new jobs are likely to be mixed with non-voluntary movers who have to end up with jobs
requiring only elementary skills. This hypothesis is confirmed by examining the ISCO codes associated with
workers' main jobs before and after the job changes. The number of job movers who moved upward on the
ladder of ISCO codes was similar to that of the individuals who moved downward. In addition, about 18
percent of job movers ended up with jobs requiring no skills (ISCO codes equal to 9,000 or above), moving
from jobs that required higher level of skills according to the ISCO codes.
44 For an extensive discussion on why wage arrears might be negatively associated with job changes, see
Earle and Sabirianova (2002). They suggest that wage arrears affect the slope of the wage­tenure profile,
thus increasing an incentive to remain longer with an employer. Other reasons include the fact that workers
who quit a job generally lose any chance to receive back wages owed. Poor outside options and fringe
benefits attached to a job can also explain the negative effect of wage arrears on job changes.

Notes: Due to the relatively small number of respondents who changed jobs in this sample, we had to re-
code some variables into broader categories. The `town' variable is coded as follows: 1, for urban areas; 0,
for villages where the majority of people are not engaged in agricultural activities and for villages where
the majority of people are engaged in agricultural activities. Occupational variables are also re-coded as
noted in the table. Estimation results are obtained using a random-effects probit procedure with time
dummies. We checked the robustness of our results relative to the coefficients associated with the variables
on the intention for a job shift and moonlighting in the previous round by taking the generated regressor
bias and clustering into account. Once this was done, the t-values associated with these coefficients became
respectively 10.82 and 2.72.

test whether in the future, these people will hold main jobs as paid employees,
entrepreneurs, or self-employed.45 Some previous moonlighters may prefer jobs
as paid employees in enterprises or public organizations because they found
moonlighting too risky. Others might want to hold jobs as entrepreneurs after
having acquired some experience and possibly some capital. Alternatively previous
moonlighters may decide to work as self-employed on a full-time basis. To find
which is the correct scenario, we estimate random-effects probit regressions for the
probability that previous moonlighters now hold each of the three types of main
occupations (paid employees, entrepreneurs, and self-employed).
Following Manser and Picot (1999), we differentiate the self-employed into
incorporated and unincorporated. The unincorporated self-employed are defined
as the currently working people who answered `no' to the following question:
45 Because, as we discussed in the introduction, only 4.7 percent of total main jobs in Russia in 1998 could
be considered as informal (Kim, 2002), it is reasonable to assume that the main jobs referred to in this
sub-section take place in the official economy.
28 Guariglia and Kim
`Please state if you work for an enterprise, organization, institution, collective farm, state
farm, firm'.
Incorporated self-employed, on the other hand, are defined as those who
answered `yes' to the above question, work at their own enterprise, hold more than
50 percent of shares, and employ fewer than 10 workers.46
The classification as entrepreneur is based on the answer given by respondents
not already classified as self-employed to the following question:
`Do you think you are doing entrepreneurial activities in this job?'
The respondents who answered `yes' to this question were classified as
entrepreneurs. Finally, paid employees are defined as currently working people
who are neither self-employed, nor entrepreneurs.
The regression results are presented in Table 5.47 Column 2 shows that there is
no significant association between previous moonlighting and a main job as an
entrepreneur. According to column 3, there is evidence that previous moonlighting is
negatively related with the probability of holding a paid job. Column 1 suggests that
there is a positive and precisely determined association between self-employment
and previous moonlighting: the coefficient and the t-value on the moonlighting
variable are 0.330 and 2.35, respectively.48 As for the marginal effect, having been
46 In more detail, the incorporated self-employed also answered `yes' to the question: `Do you work at your
own enterprise?' and answered `from 51­100 percent' to the question: `What percentage of this enterprise do you
own?'; and `less than 10' to the question: `How many people work in your enterprise?' Given that self-employment
is not clearly defined in the questionnaire, we used several definitions of self-employed, for instance
including only the unincorporated, or only the incorporated. In all cases, we obtained results similar to those
reported, which are available upon request.
47 The results in Table 5 refer to the estimation of equation (11), where the dependent variable is a binary
variable indicating whether people hold jobs as self-employed, entrepreneurs, or paid employees at time t.
The results were obtained using a two-step estimation procedure as before. In the first step, we estimated
selectivity-bias-corrected earning functions for self-employed, entrepreneurs, and paid employees using a
Heckman (1976) procedure, and fitted values for wage rates were obtained. In the second step, the estimated
wage rates were used as explanatory variables in the estimation of the equation for the participation in each
of the three main occupations. Note that for the self-employed, we use wages to refer to the profits or
revenues that they obtain from their business.
48 The coefficient on the previous moonlighting variable is still marginally significant when we take the
effect of clustering and the generated regressor bias into account (the t-value becomes 1.92). Considering
the possibility of measurement error affecting the self-employed category, we pooled the self-employed and
entrepreneurs together in a single category and looked at the effect of previous moonlighting on the
probability of being an entrepreneur or self-employed as a primary job. The results, not reported for brevity,
suggested that the coefficient associated with previous moonlighting was strongly significant both when
clustering and the generated regressor bias were taken into account (t-value is 2.40) and when they were
not (t-value is 2.72). Note that this broader classification is unlikely to suffer from measurement error
because occupation as a self-employed worker or entrepreneur is directly observable from the data and is
clearly differentiated from occupation as a paid employee.

a moonlighter in the previous period is associated with a 35 percent higher
probability of being self-employed in the present.49 In other words, a popular first
job choice of previous moonlighters appears to be self-employment.50
In order to put the marginal effects obtained before in a better context, Table 6
shows workers' transition to different types of primary jobs (self-employed, paid,
and entrepreneurial jobs) after a spell of moonlighting as self-employed (individual
economic activities). We only focus on those moonlighters who hold a self-employed
second job because we are interested in seeing whether they convert their main job
to self-employment following a moonlighting spell as self-employed.
Several observations can be drawn from the table. First, across the three different
types of jobs, the conditional probability that an individual does not engage in
moonlighting in the terminal period after an initial period of moonlighting is
higher than the probability that he still moonlights (column 1).51 This confirms our
earlier finding of the transitory nature of moonlighting.
Column 5 of the table reports ratios obtained by dividing the number of
workers who were moonlighting as self-employed at time t and hold a main job as
self-employed, paid employees, or entrepreneurs in period t + 1 (column 1), by the
total number of workers who hold a main job in each of the three groups of
activities at time t + 1 (column 3). These ratios, which are 10.0 percent for the
self-employed, 9.8 percent for the entrepreneurs, and 7.9 percent for the paid
employees, suggest that following a spell of moonlighting as self-employed, people
are most likely to hold a self-employed or entrepreneurial primary job.52
The ratios reported in column 5, however, do not take into account the fact that
former moonlighters might have already held a main job as self-employed, paid
employees, or entrepreneurs in period t. Column 6 takes this effect into account: it
indicates the ratio between the number of workers who did not have a main job
in one of the three main categories of activities, but who were moonlighting as
self-employed in period t, and switched to a main job as self-employed, paid
49 Note that although only 31 individuals in our sample moonlighted as self-employed in the period prior
to effectively becoming self-employed, which represents only 8.4 percent of the pool of self-employed, these
31 individuals represent 26.5 percent of the inflow into self-employment (see Table 6 below and the associated
discussion).
50 One should also consider the possibility that some past moonlighters end up in unemployment or out of
the labour force, instead of going into single job holding. We have tested this hypothesis by estimating a
regression similar to those reported in Table 5, where the dependent variable is equal to 1 if the respondent
is unemployed or out of the labour force, and 0 otherwise. We found that the coefficient associated with the
previous moonlighting variable was marginally significant (t-value: 1.96). Moreover, its coefficient (0.12)
was very small compared to the corresponding coefficient reported in column 1 of Table 5 relative to the
probability of ending up as self-employed as a main occupation (0.33). These results, which are not reported
for brevity, but are available from the authors upon request, suggest that the association between past
moonlighting and becoming unemployed or exiting the labour force is not particularly strong.
51 The difference between the two probabilities is statistically significant (t-value: 21.9).
52 Note that the difference in the ratios relative to the self-employed and paid workers is statistically significant
(t-value: 8.9), whereas the corresponding difference between self-employed and entrepreneurs is not (t-value: 0.12).

employee, or entrepreneur at time t + 1, and the number of inflows in the three
main groups of activities in period t + 1. The shares reported in column 6 show that
self-employment moonlighting contributes to the expansion of self-employment
in Russia, as it represents 26.5 percent of the new self-employed main jobs. In
contrast, the contribution by previous moonlighters to the flows into the categories
of paid employees or entrepreneurs is significantly lower.53
One possible interpretation of our findings is that self-employment activities
were strongly discouraged until the late 1980s in the Soviet Union. Although those
activities began to emerge in a new environment at the later stage of perestroika, the
share of self-employment out of total employment was negligible. The transition
towards a market economy in Russia provided households with the sudden opening
of opportunities. Workers contemplating self-employment could experiment with
it as a secondary form of employment, before leaving their main job and becoming
full-time self-employed. Thus, secondary jobs could serve as the entry point of
self-employment, which could evolve into entrepreneurships in the future.54 If
this interpretation were true, then moonlighting in Russia could be viewed as a
low-cost seedbed for setting up new self-employed businesses, and moonlighting
could be seen as a significant factor that contributed to the emergence of new
self-employed businesses during the transition period.55
6. Conclusions
Using the RLMS, this paper has analysed the dynamics of moonlighting in Russia.
We can summarize our findings as follows: First, previous moonlighting is
53 Both the differences in shares between self-employed and paid worker, and between self-employed
worker and entrepreneur are statistically significant (the t-values are 9.5 and 2.0, respectively).
54 Earle and Sakova (1999) suggested that the considerable rise in self-employment after the transition can
be seen as a `quasi-experiment' for understanding the sources of entrepreneurship in transition economies.
Due to the lack of capital and of a banking system to finance small businesses, the start-ups would nearly
always have begun as self-employed activities.
55 The positive correlation between past moonlighting and self-employment could also reflect the decision
of workers who expect to lose their primary job to start self-employment as a coping mechanism and thus
to combine it with their first job until they effectively lose their primary job, after which the secondary
self-employment would become de facto the main activity (see Earle and Sakova, 2000). Although in some
cases, this interpretation could be true, we think that because the unemployment rate in Russia was fairly
low over the period considered, averaging only 7.2 percent (Russian Economic Trends, 1999), it is more likely
that moonlighting was used as a stepping stone to setting up new self-employed businesses. Furthermore,
over the period 1994­98, only 13.5 percent of respondents on average answered the question: `How
concerned are you that you might lose your job?' with `very concerned', the other possible answers being `a little
concerned', `both concerned and not concerned', `not very concerned', and `not concerned at all'. We constructed
a dummy equal to 1 for these respondents and equal to 0 otherwise and included it as an additional
explanatory variable in equation (12). We found that the coefficient associated with this dummy was negative
and precisely determined, suggesting that people who expect to lose their primary jobs are actually less
likely to moonlight. This is in line with the enterprising motive for moonlighting discussed in Section 2.

negatively associated with present moonlighting, suggesting that moonlighting in
Russia is transitory. Most working-aged Russians return to a single-job holding
after a period of moonlighting.
Second, an intention for a job shift expressed in the past is positively correlated
with present moonlighting and previous moonlighting is positively associated with
present job changes. This may be due to the fact that Russians use moonlighting as
a mechanism to smooth the process of changing jobs. Moonlighting can in fact
allow individuals to transform their secondary job into the primary one without
exposing them to the risk arising from an immediate shift from one job to the
other. Moonlighting can also be used as a human capital-enhancing activity for a
job mover, enabling him to accumulate the necessary skills and information about
the new job. According to our results, an intention to change jobs tends to end up
with an actual job change, suggesting that there is a significant association
between the intention and the implementation. We can therefore conclude that
there is a considerable interaction between the three key variables in our analysis:
moonlighting, an intention to change jobs, and an actual job change.
Third, previous experience as a moonlighter is positively correlated with
becoming self-employed as a main activity, and 26.5 percent of the inflow into
self-employment is due to those people starting self-employment as a main job
after a period of moonlighting as self-employed. In the early stages of the transition,
many households worked in the informal economy because of turmoil, excessive
regulations, high taxes, wage arrears, and so on. As the transition proceeded,
the turmoil and some of the extreme distortions subsided. This appears to have
encouraged former moonlighters to move into self-employment as a main job,
emerging into the tax-paying official economy. After having experienced self-
employment in the official economy for a while, some of the former moonlighters
may eventually become entrepreneurs in the official sector. In this sense,
moonlighting in Russia can be viewed as an effective incubator for setting up new
self-employed/entrepreneurial businesses in the official economy, and might
provide long-term benefits to the economy in spite of its possible negative effects,
which have been widely discussed in the literature.

Appendix 1
Estimation of secondary job wages
The estimated wage rates for secondary jobs included in Table 3 are the fitted
values obtained from the estimation of a wage equation using the standard
Heckman (1976) procedure, which corrects for selection bias. The dependent
variable in the wage equation is the logarithm of real hourly wages received in
the month prior to interview in the informal economy. The independent variables
are standard: human capital variables such as education and main job tenure,
demographic characteristics, location, main job occupational dummies captured by
ISCO codes, and secondary job characteristics. Note that wage arrears in secondary
jobs are not common: only 9 percent of moonlighters in our sample face unpaid
wages. The identification variables in the participation equation include wage rates
and working hours from the main job, income from non-job-related sources,
marital status, and family characteristics. These variables are assumed to affect the
participation decision through their effects on the individual's preference and his
time constraints.
We estimate the wage and participation equations separately for each round
for two reasons. First, this helps to avoid possible instability of equations across
rounds. Second, the Heckman-type regression is not yet developed to take into
account the panel nature of the data. The estimation results for the wage equations
are presented in Tables A1 and A2.

Robustness checks relative to the specification showing the effects of
previous moonlighting on present moonlighting
Table A3 provides some robustness tests relative to the specification relating
previous moonlighting to present moonlighting reported in the first two columns
of Table 3. Column 1 presents the estimates of the specification once the generated
variable bias and clustering are taken into consideration. Column 2 is based on a
larger sample of the Russian population that comprises not only working individuals,

Notes: In column 1, the estimation results are obtained using a pooled probit model with time dummies. Standard errors are corrected for the
generated regressor bias and clustering. In column 2, the results are obtained using a random-effects probit model with time dummies. In
column 3, the results are obtained using a conditional fixed-effects logit model (Chamberlain, 1980). In all specifications, the previous
moonlighting variable is instrumented using lagged regional unemployment rates, lagged primary job categories (managerial, professional,
non-manual skilled, manual skilled, unskilled), and lagged perceived economic rank.
*Other income for the estimation using the whole sample (column 2) is defined as income not originated from the secondary job.
**The estimated wage rate on the second job is estimated using the Heckman (1976) method. In columns 1 and 3, this method is applied to those individuals
who received a positive income from a main job and who moonlighted at least once before the present period. In column 2, it is applied to all individuals
who held a main job (regardless of whether they received any income from it) and who moonlighted at least once before the present period.
