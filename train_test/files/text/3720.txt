Introduction
Job satisfaction has received attention from studies of orga-
nizational behavior, which have examined job satisfaction as
antecedents of improved leadership capabilities and human
resource management. Generally, constructs and measure-
ment instruments have been developed in Western countries.
Consequently, job satisfaction has been studied extensively
in Western Europe and the United States. However, empiri-
cal studies indicate that these studies cannot be directly
applied to the analysis of organizational behavior in the
Czech Republic (e.g., Lukásová, Franková, & Surynek,
2006).
In the past decade, there have been a number of studies
involving non-Western cultures, including studies from
Taiwan (e.g., Chen & Silverthorne, 2008; Cheung &
Scherling, 1999; Lu, Tseng, & Cooper, 1999; Silverthorne,
2004), China (e.g., Lau, Tse, & Zhou, 2002; Leung, Smith,
Wang, & Sun, 1996; Liu, Tang, & Zhu, 2008; Loscocco &
Bose, 1998; Scott, Bishop, & Chen, 2003), and Russia (Linz,
2003). Recently, investigations of the Middle East have also
been undertaken (e.g., Abdulla, Djebarni, & Mellahi, 2011;
Tlaiss, 2013; Yousef, 2001). Nonetheless, there remains a
paucity of empirical data from transient post-Communist
economies from Central and Eastern Europe (CEE), which
includes the Czech Republic. Little is known about the fac-
tors that influence job satisfaction in post-Communist coun-
tries as they change their behavioral patterns during the
transition from a centrally planned economy to a market
economy (Lange, 2009). The importance of understanding
the organizational behavior of people from CEE countries
has emerged from the fact that some features of the recent
socioeconomic development of those countries are very spe-
cific and differ from both Western and Eastern countries.
Moreover, life under Communist regimes had long-term
impacts on CEE citizens' values and beliefs (Inglehart &
Baker, 2000).
Studies in some CEE countries have been based on
smaller samples and focused on specific professions--for
example, public relations practitioners in Bulgaria (Karadjov,
Kim, & Karavasilev, 2000) hospital staff (Kaarna, Põlluste,
Lepnurm, & Thetloff, 2004) and family doctors (Kalda,
Maaroos, & Lember, 2000) in Estonia, managers
(Alonderiene, 2010) and dentists in Lithuania (Puriene,
Petrauskiene, Janulyte, & Balciuniene, 2007), salespersons
in Poland (Brashear, Lepkowska-White, & Chelariu, 2003),
and nurses in Slovakia (Gurková, Cáp, Ziaková, & urisková,

Abstract
This study examines the effect of personal and work-related factors on job satisfaction based on a sample from the Czech
Republic. The study, which was based on a questionnaire survey of 1,776 respondents in organizations in the Czech Republic,
proposed a number of hypotheses related to demographic and organizational variables and tests using ANOVA. Results
of the data analysis revealed similarities to findings in Western countries, in which men show higher job satisfaction than
women. Age does not seem to have a significant effect on job satisfaction. There is low job satisfaction in public/governmental
organizations and among young people entering the job market. It is suggested that it is necessary to develop a human
resources strategy for the public/governmental sector that will not only increase its social prestige but also increase positive
feelings among its employees. The need to better prepare undergraduates for the demands of the job market is also discussed.

workers have received a great deal of attention.
Haraszti (1977) has argued that Soviet-style labor rela-
tions produced demotivated, demoralized, and unsatisfied
workers. Although it is quite difficult to make such general-
ized statements about all European Communist countries, it
is known that during the last decade of Communist rule
(1980s), job dissatisfaction commonly existed in the Czech
Republic (known until 1992 as Czechoslovakia), which was
caused by insufficient work organization, bad workplace
relations, incompetent superordinates, inefficient reward
systems, and limited opportunities for career advancement
(typically, formal political activity was required).
Consequently, low job satisfaction was associated with low
job performance, which resulted in the economy's overall
poor performance (e.g., Mozný, 1999). In public and official
communications, however, these negative phenomena were
hidden. For this reason, there are no empirical data describ-
ing job satisfaction in organizations during that period.
However, following the collapse of the Communist political
and centrally planned economic systems in CEE countries,
the last two decades have been characterized by a very rapid
socioeconomic and political transition. The extent and field
of the recent institutional changes in the transition econo-
mies of CEE countries have been quite unusual (Peng, 2003).
Despite initial difficulties, most of these countries now have
market economies that are more stable than before (Olson et
al., 2006). However, there is a question of whether the lega-
cies of Communist industrial relations still influence Czech
employees' organizational behavior. Unfortunately, our
knowledge about changes in organizational behavior during
this period of transition is still quite limited.
The first empirical data about job satisfaction in the Czech
Republic are available from 1997 from the International
Social Survey Program (ISSP), which focuses on registering
work orientation. Several studies based on those data have
been published (Medgyesi & Róbert, 2003; Sousa-Poza &
Sousa-Poza, 2000; Vecerník, 2003). The data showed that
levels of job satisfaction in CEE countries were quite low
compared with Western and Northern Europe. Four CEE
countries (Hungary, Slovenia, Bulgaria, and the Czech
Republic) are among the eight countries with the lowest job-
satisfaction levels. A subsequent survey conducted in 2005
(see http://www.issp.org) showed that job-satisfaction levels
in the Czech Republic are still one of the lowest among the
21 Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD) countries. The study, based on data
obtained from 1999 to 2002 in both Western and Eastern
European countries from a sample of 20,000 employed
respondents, again confirmed that job-satisfaction levels
were considerably higher in Western European countries
than in Eastern European countries (Borooah, 2009). Data
from the European Employee Index collected in 2008 and
2009 in 22 countries showed that the Czech Republic ranked
second-to-last in job satisfaction (see Eskildsen, Kristensen,
& Antvor, 2010). Determinants of job satisfaction in Western
and Eastern European countries have been analyzed by
Fargher et al. (2008) and Lange (2009). Unfortunately, dif-
ferences between particular CEE countries were not exam-
ined in these studies.
All of these studies have shown that during the past two
decades, the level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic
has been quite low. To understand this situation, we need
more information about the impact of particular factors that
influence job satisfaction. Thus, the objective of this study
was to examine sociodemographic and organizational factors
that determine job satisfaction in a sample from the Czech
Republic and to compare them with findings from developed
Western countries. This study continues our previous
research on a smaller sample (Frank & Vecea, 2008), which
primarily focused on the personal correlates of job satisfac-
tion. The aim of this study is to investigate relationships
between job satisfaction and sociodemographic and personal
characteristics (gender, education, age, and occupational
level), along with relationships between job satisfaction and
some work-related situational factors (organization size,
organization ownership, and organizational culture).
Review of the literature
A classic definition describes job satisfaction as a pleasur-
able or positive emotional state resulting from the appraisal
of one's job or job experience (Locke, 1976). Measurements
of job satisfaction include both intrinsic and extrinsic satis-
faction (e.g., Ryan & Deci, 2000). Typically, intrinsic satis-
faction includes achievement, responsibility, recognition,
and dependence, whereas extrinsic satisfaction is composed
of salary, additional bonuses, relationships with coworkers,
and working conditions. Job satisfaction plays a role in job
performance (e.g., Judge et al., 2001). Job satisfaction is con-
sidered a cause of turnover and absenteeism, along with their
associated costs (e.g., Mobley, 1982; Staw, 1984). Moreover,
job satisfaction is associated with general life satisfaction
(Drobnic, Beham, & Präg, 2010; Judge & Watanabe, 1993).
Many factors can affect the level of job satisfaction. The
literature often distinguishes between the situational and per-
sonal characteristics of job satisfaction (e.g., Spector, 1997).
Whereas situational characteristics represent job characteris-
tics (organizational, work-related factors), personal charac-
teristics represent an individual's personal (e.g., age, gender,
education) and dispositional (e.g., personality traits)
features.
Age is an employee characteristic that is often thought to
influence job satisfaction. Several decades ago, Rhodes (1983)
conducted a meta-analytic study based on a review of more
than 185 studies and concluded that job satisfaction is posi-
tively and linearly linked with age. Older employees are more
satisfied than younger employees with their jobs. Later, Clark,
Oswald, and Warr (1996) noted that many older people have
succeeded in moving into occupations with characteristics that
Frank et al. 3
are more desirable. They have expectations of their jobs that
are more realistic, and their mental structures change with age-
ing. Interestingly, some of the differences between age groups
might be accounted by different rates of labor-force participa-
tion--typically, approximately 90% of young people are eco-
nomically active, whereas the rate of employment is lower
among older people (Clark et al., 1996).
In the 1990s, new insight into this association was pro-
vided by Clark et al. (1996) in a study sampling 5,000 U.K.
employees. Their investigation provides strong evidence for
a U-shaped relationship between job satisfaction and age,
meaning that younger and older employees are more satis-
fied than middle-aged employees. Specifically, overall job
satisfaction is at its lowest at age 36 and increases thereafter.
This finding was confirmed in later research by Gazioglu and
Tansel (2006) on a sample of more than 28,000 British
employees. Fargher et al. (2008) have conducted a study on
data from European countries (Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, The
Netherlands, Sweden, and the United Kingdom) collected in
1999-2000 and have replicated the U-shaped distribution of
job satisfaction as a function of age in a Western European
subsample. In a CEE subsample (Czech Republic, Estonia,
Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, Slovakia, and Slovenia),
however, the U-shaped pattern was visible but not statisti-
cally significant. In contrast, Eskildsen, Kristensen, and
Westlund (2003), in a survey conducted in the Nordic coun-
tries (Denmark, Finland, Norway, and Sweden), have
reported that job satisfaction increases linearly with age.
Interestingly, a study by Luthans and Thomas (1989), con-
ducted in the United States, has found that workers older
than 40 years of age become less satisfied with their jobs. An
explanation for this may involve both processes of resigna-
tion and pressure from modern technologies, high work
overload, and the increasing focus on productivity.
The labor market in the Czech Republic is dissimilar to
markets in the above-mentioned Western countries.
Unfortunately, there are no investigations available that
describe relationships between job satisfaction and age in the
Czech Republic and other transient economies of CEE begin-
ning in the early 1990s. As stated above, very rapid political,
social, and economic changes imposed great pressures, pri-
marily on middle-aged and older generations of employees.
Organizations' transition processes were characterized by
rapid technological changes, internationalization develop-
ments, privatization, and pressure for higher quality products
and higher work productivity. In addition, during that period,
older employees suffered from age discrimination. All of
these phenomena caused the middle and the older genera-
tions to feel threatened and distressed. Our previous research,
conducted in 2007 (Frank & Vecea, 2008), showed that job
satisfaction during that period slightly significantly decreased
with age (r = -.17). However, we assume that later, around
the 2010s, people who have recently become members of the
middle and the older generations would have become more
adapted to changes due to generational shift.
Education is an additional factor often found to cause dif-
ferences in the level of job satisfaction. However, the evi-
dence of an association between job satisfaction and
education is contradictory. Studies from the 1970s reported a
positive association between job satisfaction and education
(e.g., Weaver, 1980). However, in their meta-analysis involv-
ing 21 studies and more than 10,000 employees, Brush,
Moch, and Pooyan (1987) found that the correlation between
job satisfaction and education does not differ significantly
from zero because patterns of associations differ by organi-
zational type. In studies conducted in the United Kingdom
beginning in 1990, Clark et al. (1996) found that job satisfac-
tion decreases with increasing educational levels. The expla-
nation is that education that does not result in extrinsic
rewards (e.g., money, prestige, autonomy) leads to dissatis-
faction. A subsequent study by Clark and Oswald (1996) has
provided empirical support for this proposal: Their analyses
initially found a positive effect of education on job satisfac-
tion. However, this positive effect disappeared when the
effect of income was controlled.
Lange (2009) did not find any significant associations
between education and job satisfaction in data for 1999-2000
from CEE countries. A study by Frank and Vecea (2008) in
the Czech Republic found a very weak positive association
between job satisfaction and education. Significant differ-
ences were seen only between employees with an educa-
tional level of "skilled worker" and those who completed
secondary school or are working and currently engaged in
university-level studies (distance learning).
Numerous studies have investigated gender differences
in reported levels of job satisfaction. In terms of associa-
tions between job satisfaction and education, their findings
are also contradictory in some respects. Some researchers
have found women to be more satisfied than men (Clark,
1997; Murray & Atkinson, 1981; Wharton, Rotolo, & Bird,
2000). Others have reported men to be more satisfied than
women (Forgionne & Peeters, 1982; Weaver, 1974). A
large body of studies has reported that there are no signifi-
cant gender differences (Brief, Rose, & Aldag, 1977;
Eskildsen et al., 2003; Weaver, 1978). In contrast, there is
evidence of gender bias in CEE countries. There are sub-
stantial differences between male and female employees,
and it seems that some of those differences reflect the sur-
viving influence of the Communist gender order (Lange,
2008; Pook, Füstös, & Marian, 2003). These influences
result in male employees having higher levels of job
satisfaction.
In view of the above literature, we have the following
expectations:
Hypothesis 1: There are no age-related differences in job
satisfaction.
Hypothesis 2: Educational level has no impact on job
satisfaction.
Hypothesis 3: Men are more satisfied with their job than
are women.

Next, we focus on work-related factors that influence job
satisfaction. There is evidence that job satisfaction is also
influenced by an employee's position in an organization.
Robie, Ryan, Schmieder, Parra, and Smith (1998) performed
a meta-analysis of the relationship between job level and job
satisfaction, analyzing data from 35 independent studies
involving more than 18,000 employees. They found that job
satisfaction increases with the level of one's job position. In
general, managers report higher levels of job satisfaction
than do regular employees (Eskildsen et al., 2003). Huang
and Vliert (2004) analyzed data from a multinational com-
pany survey of more than 129,000 respondents from 39
countries. They reported that job level is associated with job
satisfaction in individualistic countries but not in collectivis-
tic countries. In addition, they found a positive relationship
between job level and job satisfaction only for jobs that pro-
vide opportunities for individuals to use their professional
skills and abilities, that is, in individualistic countries.
Earlier research has revealed that job satisfaction is influ-
enced in some way by organization size (e.g., Ingham, 1970;
Talacchi, 1957). Moreover, frequently it has been observed
that large companies pay more than small firms (i.e., the
employer size-wage effect, for example, Brown & Medoff,
1989; Green, Machin, & Manning, 1996; Troske, 1999).
Lang and Johnson (1994) proposed that the balance of intrin-
sic and extrinsic values moderates organization size and job
satisfaction. Investigations from the United Kingdom (Clark,
1996; Gazioglu & Tansel, 2006) and the United States (Idson,
1990) that are more recent indicate lower levels of satisfac-
tion in larger organizations. Idson (1990) proposed that lower
levels of satisfaction in larger organizations can be explained
by those organizations' inflexible work environments. Ritter
and Anker (2002) reported that the smallest employers (up to
10 employees) generate the lowest job satisfaction in Latin
America but the highest job satisfaction in Hungary and
Ukraine. Their explanation relates to the fact that in transi-
tion economies, small companies are more dynamic in con-
trast to the previously state-run enterprises, which are rigid.
Investigations of Western countries do not show system-
atic differences in job satisfaction between the government
and the private sector (e.g., Kankaanranta et al., 2007).
Patterns of employment in public organizations differ from
those of private or semipublic systems. In most countries,
compared with the private sector, public sector salaries are
lower, promotion is slower, and rewards are not always
related to work performance (Rainey, 1991). In contrast, the
public sector usually offers a stable work environment and
higher job security. During the Czech Republic's process of
economic transition, government employees suffered from
low incomes and a bureaucratic organizational culture.
Frank and Vecea (2008) found the highest level of overall
job satisfaction in international corporations, followed by
organizations with foreign owners, organizations with Czech
owners, and public/governmental organizations.
Based on previous evidence, we hypothesize as follows:
Hypothesis 4: Managers are more satisfied with their
jobs than are employees in nonmanagerial positions.
Hypothesis 5: The highest level of job satisfaction is
found in the smallest organizations.
Hypothesis 6: The lowest level of job satisfaction is
found in public/governmental organizations.
Research method
Sample
A sample of 1,776 respondents participated in the study.
Respondents ranged from 17 to 74 years of age. Their mean
age was 36.3 years (SD = 10.80). The sample consisted of
762 men and 1,014 women who lived mostly in the
Northeastern regions of the Czech Republic--Hradec
Králové, Pardubice, and (partially) Vysocina. Table 1 shows
the characteristics of the employees and organizations sur-
veyed. The respondents worked in various occupations
covering a wide spectrum of activities (for details, see
Table 2).
Frank et al. 5
Measurements
The survey questionnaire consisted of three sections. The
first section contained three demographic questions: gender,
age, and educational level. The second section contained five
questions concerning the characteristics of the respondents'
organizations: ownership (Czech ownership, foreign owner-
ship, international corporation, or public/governmental orga-
nization), size (up to 50 employees, up to 250 employees, up
to 500 employees, and more than 500 employees), respon-
dents' job levels (manager/supervisory responsibility, non-
supervisory responsibility), and type of business.
The third section included the 36-item scale "Job
Satisfaction Survey," which was developed by Spector
(1985). This scale was used to measure the respondents' per-
ceived level of job satisfaction. Because the original version
is in English, the scale was translated to Czech. The method
of parallel translation was used. Two people independently
translated the scale from English to Czech, and discussions
between the translators resolved discrepancies. The full text
of the Czech version of the scale is available on the web page
of the original version's author (see http://shell.cas.usf.
edu/~pspector/scales/jsstranslate.html).
The scale was composed of nine subscales describing
various facets of job satisfaction: Pay (Cronbach's  = .85),
Promotion (Cronbach's  = .84), Supervision (Cronbach's
 = .76), Fringe Benefits (Cronbach's  = .73), Contingent
Rewards (Cronbach's  = .82), Operating Conditions
(Cronbach's  = .64), Coworkers (Cronbach's  = .70),
Nature of theWork (Cronbach's  = .80), and Communication
(Cronbach's  = .77). The Cronbach's alpha for total satisfac-
tion was .93. Respondents were instructed to indicate the
extent of their agreement with each item on a 6-point scale
ranging from strongly disagree (1) to strongly agree (6).
Procedures
We attempted to create a sample of employees from various
fields in the business and nonprofit sectors. The data were
collected by part-time undergraduate students. Typically, the
University of Hradec Králové's part-time undergraduates are
from the Northeastern regions of the Czech Republic. Thus,
we collected data from the Hradec Králové and Pardubice
regions, along with part of the Vysocina region. Given that
the data were collected by part-time students of different
ages, working in various types of organizations, who had
miscellaneous reasons for studying while they worked, we
did not assume any systematic selection bias in the data set.
The data used in this study were collected in January and
February 2013. Part-time undergraduate students enrolled in
management or psychology courses at the University of
Hradec Králové's Faculty of Informatics and Management
were invited to administer paper-and-pencil questionnaires
in the companies and organizations where they worked.
Typically, each undergraduate collected approximately 20

questionnaires. To achieve high statistical power, we made
an effort to obtain a sample of approximately 2,000 partici-
pants. Ultimately, 1,950 respondents participated in the
study; 174 questionnaires were excluded due to various
errors and missing values.
Statistical analyses were conducted using Statistica 8
software (Statsoft, Inc.).
Research findings
Table 3 shows the average scores on overall job satisfaction,
as well as the average scores on particular facets of job satis-
faction. The first hypothesis proposed that there are no sig-
nificant differences among particular age groups with respect
to the level of job satisfaction. One-way ANOVA was used to
test this hypothesis by comparing the means of the three age
groups. ANOVA did not indicate a significant effect of age
on the level of overall job satisfaction, F(1, 1773) = 2.159,
p = .116. Moreover, Pearson's correlation indicated that cor-
relation between age and overall job satisfaction was about
zero (r = .03, p = .138).
In the next step, we looked for age differences in particu-
lar facets of job satisfaction. In most of them, except for pro-
motion, supervision, and operating conditions, we did not
find significant differences among the scores for particular
age groups. The results revealed significant differences in
satisfaction with promotion, F(2, 1773) = 6.98, p < .01, 2 =
0.007, among the age groups.TheTukey Honestly Significant
Difference (HSD) post hoc test yielded significant differ-
ences in satisfaction with promotion between the youngest
and oldest age groups. Older employees were less satisfied
than younger ones. Moreover, we found significant differ-
ences in satisfaction with supervision, F(2, 1773) = 5.29, p <
.01, 2 = 0.010. The Tukey HSD post hoc test yielded signifi-
cant differences in satisfaction with supervision between the
middle and oldest age groups--that is, that older employees
are less satisfied. Finally, the results revealed significant dif-
ferences in satisfaction with operating conditions,
F(2, 1773) = 8.80, p < .001, 2 = 0.010. The Tukey HSD post
hoc test yielded significant differences between the younger
age group and the other age groups. Young employees were
more satisfied with operating conditions. In conclusion, we
find that the oldest employees were less satisfied with respect
to some facets of job satisfaction. With respect to other fac-
ets, however, there were no significant differences among the
age groups. Thus, H1 was partially confirmed.
The second hypothesis proposed no significant differ-
ences between education and level of job satisfaction. One-
way ANOVA was used to test this hypothesis by comparing
the means of the six levels of education. The ANOVA did not
Frank et al. 7
indicate a significant effect of education on the level of over-
all job satisfaction, F(1, 1770) = 2.066, p = .075. In the next
step, we looked for an effect of education on particular facets
of job satisfaction. The ANOVA revealed a significant effect
of education on satisfaction with supervision, F(2, 1773) =
4.632, p < .001, 2 = 0.013; operating conditions,
F(2, 1773) = 6.182, p < .001, 2 = 0.017; coworkers, F(2,
1773) = 4.010, p < .01, 2 = 0. 011; and nature of the work,
F(2, 1773) = 3.190, p < 0.01, 2 = 0.009. The Tukey HSD
post hoc test showed that differences in the satisfaction of
skilled workers versus working undergraduates were mostly
significant. Clearly, these analyses confirmed a lower level
of job satisfaction among less-educated employees (skilled
workers), but did not reveal some type of linear association
between level of education and job satisfaction. Thus, H2
was partially confirmed.
The third hypothesis proposed that males are more satis-
fied with their jobs than are females. The t test for indepen-
dent samples indicated significant differences between the
average scores of overall job satisfaction for males and
females (t = 3.143, p < .01). Males were more satisfied than
females. However, the effect size was small (Cohen's d =
0.138). In a subsequent analysis, we checked gender differ-
ences for particular facets of job satisfaction. The results
revealed that males are significantly more satisfied than
females with pay (t = 5.649, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.274),
promotion (t = 6.752, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.326), fringe
benefits (t = 2.971, p < .01, Cohen's d = 0.144), and contin-
gent rewards (t = 3.750, p < .001, Cohen's d = 0.180).
Conversely, females are significantly more satisfied than
males with communication (t = 2.171, p < .05, Cohen's d =
0.131). Thus, H3 was confirmed.
The fourth hypothesis proposed that managers are more
satisfied with their jobs than are employees without supervi-
sory responsibility. The t test for independent samples indi-
cated significant differences in overall job satisfaction
between managers and nonsupervisory employees (t = 5.779,
p < .001). Managers are more satisfied than nonsupervisory
employees, with the effect size being moderate (Cohen's d =
0.311). Furthermore, analysis of particular facets of job sat-
isfaction indicates that managers are significantly more satis-
fied than are nonsupervisory employees with pay (t = 7.176,
p < .001, Cohen's d = -0.388), promotion (t = 7.663, p <
.001, Cohen's d = 0.697), fringe benefits (t = 5230, p < .001,
Cohen's d = -0.288), contingent rewards (t = 5.506, p < .001,
Cohen's d = 0.296), operating conditions (t = 2.508, p < .05,
Cohen's d = 0.138), nature of the work (t = 6.499, p < .001,
Cohen's d = 0.367), and communication (t = 3.664, p < .001,
Cohen's d = 0.200). The differences were not significant for
supervision and coworkers. Thus, H4 was confirmed.
The fifth hypothesis proposed that the highest level of job
satisfaction is found in the smallest organizations. One-way
ANOVA was used to test this hypothesis by comparing the
means of overall job-satisfaction scores in four types of orga-
nizations divided by size. The ANOVA revealed the signifi-
cant effect of organization size on overall job satisfaction,
F(3, 1772) = 2.770, p < .01, 2 = 0.004. The Tukey HSD post
hoc test showed statistically significant differences only
between the smallest organizations of up to 50 employees
and organizations with 50 to 250 employees (means of 3.79
vs. 3.68). The effect size was small (Cohen's d = 0.149).
To clarify the nature of these differences, analyses of par-
ticular facets of job satisfaction were performed. The results
revealed that satisfaction with pay, F(3, 1772) = 3.641, p <
.01, 2 = 0.006, and fringe benefits, F(3, 1772) = 5.528, p <
.001, 2 = 0.009, is highest in larger organizations and small-
est in organizations with 50 to 250 employees. In contrast,
the smallest organizations have the highest satisfaction with
contingent rewards, F(3, 1772) = 3.323, p < .05, 2 = 0.006;
the nature of the work, F(3, 1772) = 9,045, p < .001, 2 =
0.015; and coworkers, F(3, 1772) = 4,446, p < .01, 2 =
0.007. The smallest organizations also have the highest level
of job satisfaction with operating conditions, whereas larger
organizations have the lowest, F(3, 1772) = 13.843, p < .001,
2 = 0.023. Finally, the smallest organizations have the high-
est level of job satisfaction with communication compared
with satisfaction levels in larger organizations and organiza-
tions with 50 to 250 employees, F(3, 1772) = 8,424, p < .001,
2 = 0.014. Thus, H5 was partly confirmed.
The final hypothesis proposed that public/governmental
organizations have the lowest level of job satisfaction. The
ANOVA revealed the significant effect of type of organiza-
tion ownership on overall job satisfaction, F(3, 1772) =
12.71, p < .001, 2 = 0.021. Table 2 shows that overall job
satisfaction in public/governmental organizations is lower,
whereas in other types of organizations, the level of overall
job satisfaction is nearly equal. The Tukey HSD post hoc test
only showed statistically significant differences between job
satisfaction in public/governmental organizations and other
types of organizations. Furthermore, analysis of particular
facets of job satisfaction indicates that public/governmental
employees are the least satisfied with pay, F(3, 1772) =
29.46, p < .001, 2 = 0.048; fringe benefits, F(3, 1772) =
25.19, p < .001, 2 = 0.041; contingent rewards, F(3, 1772) =
13.00, p < .001, 2 = 0.022; promotion opportunities,
F(3, 1772) = 39.52, p < .001, 2 = 0.063; and operating con-
ditions, F(3, 1772) = 28.56, p < .001, 2 = 0.046. Thus, H6
was confirmed.
Discussion and Conclusion
In this study, we aimed to extend our knowledge about the
impact of selected personal and work-related factors on job
satisfaction in the Czech Republic. We were interested in
finding out whether the patterns of associations between par-
ticular personal and work-related determinants and job satis-
faction in the Czech Republic are similar to those in Western
countries. Our data reveal patterns of associations similar to
those observed in Western countries. However, some differ-
ences were found.
Adifferent pattern of association was found for age. Some
Western European countries showed a U-shaped pattern of
8 SAGE Open
job satisfaction with age, whereas the Nordic countries
showed a linear increase. Although our older data from 2007
(Frank & Vecea, 2008) revealed a slightly significant
decrease of job satisfaction with age, in the current data,
overall job satisfaction was not affected by age. A significant
negative correlation with age was found only in the three
facets of job satisfaction, namely, promotion, supervision,
and operating conditions. Clearly, this finding supports our
assumption that newly middle-aged and older employees in
the Czech Republic have become relatively adapted to the
organizational changes that primarily occurred in the 1990s.
The positive message of this outcome is that the level of
overall job satisfaction of the older age group did not tend to
decline. Conversely, there is a negative message in that the
youngest group of Czech employees have a low level of sat-
isfaction compared with the U-shaped relationship between
age and job satisfaction observed in some Western European
countries.
Because of the paucity of further relevant data, we can
offer only a relatively speculative explanation. First, Czech
employers often complain that graduates of various types of
schools lack appropriate preparation for job requirements
(Doucek, Maryska, & Novotný, 2013; Kalousková &
Vojtch, 2008). According to this critique, Czech schools,
colleges, and universities do not appropriately educate their
graduates for the potential demands of the job market.
Employers argue that education often suffers from a lack of
practical skill and experience training (e.g., communication,
team work, and trustworthiness). It might be that because of
inappropriate preparation by the Czech schools, entry-level
employment is unpleasant or even stressful for young
employees, resulting in a lower level of perceived job satis-
faction. Second, it has often been reported (Kalousková &
Vojtch, 2008) that young Czech graduates have unrealistic
expectations about high wages or possibilities of rapid pro-
motion, which also can lead to perceived job dissatisfaction.
These unrealistic expectations may also be a manifestation
of naive hopes that emerged at the beginning of the period of
the socioeconomic transition. In the Czech Republic, the
younger generation did not always have realistic hopes about
the rapidity of success in the new "capitalist" society (e.g.,
Kvapil, 2013). Interestingly, Olson et al. (2006) have com-
pared young adults' ideals about future jobs in post-Commu-
nist CEE countries and the United States, finding that
wanting a well-paying job is associated with poorer eco-
nomic conditions, whereas preference for career success is
associated with better economic conditions.
It was observed that the associations between educational
degree and the level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic
are similar to the patterns of those associations observed in
Western countries. More specifically, a higher degree of edu-
cation does not mean a higher level of job satisfaction. The
detailed analysis of our data revealed significant differences
between the job satisfaction of skilled workers and that of
employees with higher educational levels. Unfortunately, the
category of employees with an elementary-level education
was almost missing in our sample. Thus, the data did not
enable a precise analysis of the patterns of those associations
in groups of employees with lower educational levels.
Conversely, no increase in job satisfaction for workers with
higher educational levels was observed. As already stated,
education that does not result in a higher salary, promotion,
or prestige tends to lead to dissatisfaction. In the Czech
Republic, the situation is similar to that in Western Europe,
where the rate of bachelor's or master's degree holders is
gradually increasing (Koucký, 2009). Conversely, the num-
ber of prestigious, well-paid jobs is limited.
As we predicted, a higher overall job satisfaction was
found in men. It turned out that men were overall more satis-
fied than women with pay, promotion, fringe benefits, and
contingent rewards. Males' higher job satisfaction with these
job facets is consistent with the well-established fact that, on
average, in the Czech Republic women are paid less than
men. Women also have fewer possibilities for promotion
(e.g., Vecerník, 2001).
Furthermore, it was confirmed that organizational size
and type also affect job satisfaction. Consistent with the
above-mentioned findings, the highest overall job satisfac-
tion score was found in the smallest organizations (i.e., those
with up to 50 employees). In small organizations, employees
are satisfied with contingent rewards, the nature of the work,
operating conditions, coworkers, and communication. In
contrast, employees in the largest organizations are satisfied
with pay and fringe benefits (employer size-wage effect). The
lowest level of job satisfaction is found in organizations of
approximately 50 to 250 employees, which cannot offer
monetary rewards similar to those offered by large compa-
nies or (conversely) a level of flexibility and informal rela-
tionships similar to those offered by the smallest
organizations.
We observed a low level of overall job satisfaction in pub-
lic/governmental organizations that was not observed in pub-
lic organizations in the West. Generally, the public sector
offers lower pay and benefits than the private sector, along
with fewer and slower career advancement opportunities
(Rainey, 1991). This was confirmed by our data. Moreover,
dissatisfaction with working conditions was also identified,
which most likely reflects the poor equipment and facilities
that are quite often typical of Czech public/governmental
organizations. Whereas lower salaries in the public sector are
typically compensated by job security or some form of social
prestige, in the Czech Republic, public employees do not
enjoy such advantages. Because of political instability, gov-
ernment organizations are periodically restructured and suf-
fer from budget cuts. Moreover, according to public opinion,
government employees are often perceived as parasitic on
the private sector.
Finally, there is the question of the reason for the often-
reported low level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic.
Our analysis of the determinants that influence job
Frank et al. 9
satisfaction did not satisfactorily clarify this phenomenon
because patterns of associations between particular deter-
minants and job-satisfaction levels showed many similari-
ties with findings obtained in Western countries. Thus, any
explanation should utilize generally known facts and asso-
ciations. It is very likely that a crucial factor influencing the
overall low level of job satisfaction in the Czech Republic
is the level of general satisfaction with life. In the Czech
Republic, life satisfaction levels are substantially lower
than in economically developed Western countries (e.g.,
Böhnke, 2008). As stated above, job satisfaction is corre-
lated with life satisfaction (e.g., Judge & Watanabe, 1993).
Recently, Georgellis and Lange (2012) analyzed associa-
tions between life satisfaction and job satisfaction using
data from the European Values Survey. The results showed
that the Czech Republic is one of the countries with the
strongest link between life satisfaction and job
satisfaction.
In addition, we assume that the low level of overall job
satisfaction in the Czech Republic has some link to rapid and
substantial processes of economic transition, which in the
1990s elicited much pressure on both employees and society
as a whole. These processes eroded the level of general life
satisfaction in the Czech Republic, which in turn affected the
level of job satisfaction.
This study has several implications. As noted, our data
revealed the low satisfaction levels among public employees.
Because this sector is crucial for the effective functioning of
both various public services and governmental administra-
tion, the implications of this study indicate the need for a
human resources strategy that will improve public employ-
ees' positive feelings in the workplace. Whereas the budget
in this sector is always limited, one of the recommendations
may involve an improvement in operating conditions along
with (at a minimum) the establishment of fair methods of
recognition, promotion, and rewards. Moreover, another way
to increase public employees' level of job satisfaction would
be to increase the social prestige of the public/governmental
sector by changing public perceptions of public
organizations.
Next, on the assumption that the lower level of job satis-
faction among young people is due to inappropriate prepara-
tion by the schools, educational authorities should implement
additional approaches. Although universities have broader
goals than preparing their graduates for work, it would be
quite reasonable to change one aspect of the Czech univer-
sity. In their complaints about the educational process,
employers often note that Czech universities are much more
liberal institutions than Western universities in terms of
demands on the students. There are no strict demands with
respect to deadlines, the precision of student work, or require-
ments for obtaining credits (Spíka, 2008). We believe that
focusing on these deficiencies would be beneficial not only
for employers and young, first-time employees but also for
the schools themselves.
Limitations
Our research had several limitations. Respondent selection is
the first limitation. As we have explained, the data were pri-
marily collected from two regions of the Czech Republic--
Hradec Králové and Pardubice. However, this deficiency is
somewhat ameliorated by the fact that the Czech Republic
has a socioeconomic composition that is relatively homoge-
neous. The country consists of 14 regions. The region of the
capital city of Prague is a bit different (e.g., it has the highest
salaries and the lowest rate of unemployment; moreover, the
prevalent political orientation is right-wing). Also different
are two regions that in the past had a great deal of heavy
industry but now suffer a higher rate of unemployment (i.e.,
the Moravskoslezský and Ústecký regions). The Hradec
Králové and Pardubice regions have relatively higher living
standards and a lower rate of unemployment. Thus, the data
gathered here can be applied to the greater Czech Republic.
A further limitation is that the category of employees with
lower educational levels was underrepresented in our sam-
ple. Another possible limitation is the method of data collec-
tion by part-time students. However, this disadvantage is
partially compensated for by the diversity of those students'
jobs because they were working in different areas of the pri-
vate and public/governmental sectors. The last limitation of
this study is that this research did not analyze all work-related
factors. Income, which is often assumed to affect employee
performance, was not examined. In the Czech Republic, it is
not common to inform others about the level of one's own
salary because quite often, people are afraid of the envy of
their colleagues. Thus, had we asked our respondents this
question, they might have refused to complete the question-
naire or would have left the item blank. Despite these limita-
tions, we believe that our data provide results that enlarge
our findings on job satisfaction in CEE countries.
