This study employs data from the 1993-94 Hispanic Established Population for
Epidemiological Studies of the Elderly (H-EPESE) to assess the impact of nativity on
preferences in living arrangements for a sample of 3,046 Mexican American individuals over
the age of 65. Our results reveal great differences between the native and foreign-born in their
desire to live with their children. A larger fraction of the foreign-born than native-born
currently live with their children and state that they would care to continue living with their
children in the event that they could no longer care for themselves. The data also reveal that
the foreign-born face more serious economic constraints than the native-born and suggest that
living with children may be motivated in part by economic need. We end by speculating on
the implications of these findings for community-based care for elderly Mexican Americans.

The population of the United States, like that of
most other nations of the world, will age rapidly well
into the twenty-first century. The consequences of
this population aging have been debated in numer-
ous arenas, most recently in conjunction with the
growing cost of medical and long-term care of the
elderly (Mendelson & Schwartz, 1993; Newhouse,
1993). It is clear that we are entering a new era in
human history in which aging populations present
unique problems to both developed and developing
nations. For the most part, scholarly debate over the
effect of aging populations has focused on the con-
sequences of the relative size of the older population
on aggregate spending for social welfare (World
Bank, 1994). Clearly, the fact that both the number of
older individuals and the proportion of the popula-
tion they represent is rapidly increasing has impor-
tant implications for all aspects of social policy. Yet
the relative size of the older population is not the
only, and perhaps not even the most important,
factor that will affect social policy relating to long-

term care in the near future (Oriol, 1994). As impor-
tant as the size of the elderly population is for policy
planners, the consequences of the increasing racial
and ethnic heterogeneity among the population over
65 may be even more important.
Because of higher fertility and differential immigra-
tion patterns among certain groups, an ever larger
fraction of the older population consists of individ-
uals who are members of racial and ethnic minority
groups (Angel & Hogan, 1992). The long-term medi-
cal care needs and preferences in living arrange-
ments of these subgroups of the elderly population
may differ significantly from those of the majority
(Angel & Angel, 1992; Burr, 1990; Burr & Mutchler,
1992; Frisbie, Bean, & Poston, 1985; Thomas &
Wister, 1984; Worobey & Angel, 1990). Long-term
care policies that are based on the assumption that
the elderly are homogeneous in terms of their health
care needs and preferences in living arrangements
are very likely to be plagued by inefficiency (Wil-
liams, 1994). In this article, we argue that in order to
develop long-term care options that optimize the
quality of life among older individuals in a politically
realistic and cost-effective manner, we must first un-
derstand the needs and preferences of specific sub-
groups. In the present case, we look at older Mexican
Americans. A major focus of the study is to examine
the extent to which culturally conditioned norms
concerning children's obligations to care for their
aging parents explain the well documented tendency
for older Mexican Americans to remain in the com-

munity and not to enter nursing homes (Burr, 1990;
Eribes & Bradley-Rawls, 1978; Espino, Neufeld, Mulvi-
hill, & Libow, 1988; Torres-Gil & Fielder, 1986-87;
Worobey & Angel, 1990).
The Growing Cost of Long-term Care
Since 1965, when Medicare was introduced, the
rate in the growth of expenditures for medical care
under that program has increased dramatically
(Feder, Rowland, Holahan, Salganicoff, & Heslam,
1993). In addition, Medicaid expenditures for hospi-
tal and physician services and long-term care for the
elderly have grown at an ever-increasing rate in re-
cent years (Rowland, Feder, Lyons, & Salganicoff,
1992; Feder et al., 1993). Currently, Medicaid pro-
vides coverage to only one third of the older popula-
tion in poverty (Rowland & Lyons, 1987). Those not
covered by Medicaid must rely on Medicare alone,
managing somehow to cover the premiums, deducti-
bles, and copayments out of current income, or they
must do without services. Providing supplemental
coverage to all poor elderly Americans, either
through Medicaid or some other program, will add
greatly to aggregate health care costs and divert
money from other uses. For the foreseeable future,
therefore, the forces propelling the growth in health
care costs, including advances in technology and
an aging population, will make it difficult, and per-
haps impossible, to contain the growth in health
care expenditures (Mendelson & Schwartz, 1993;
Newhouse, 1993).
In the context of an aging population with an ever
greater need for hospital and home health care ser-
vices, the containment of the growth in expenditures
for the care of older individuals will require innova-
tions that maximize the use of less expensive commu-
nity mechanisms of support (Bass & Noelker, 1987).
Numerous experiments in home- and community-
based care have been tried and will no doubt form a
central part of any innovations in long-term care for
the elderly (Rivlin & Weiner, 1988; Rowland & Lyons,
1987; Rowland et al., 1992; Weiner & Hanley, 1992).
Initial hopes were that community-based care would
be less expensive than institutionalization, but the
evidence indicates that this is not necessarily the case
(Capitman, 1986; Kane & Kane, 1990; Leutz, 1986;
Vertrees, Manton, & Adler, 1989; Weiner & Hanley,
1992). Because of the large number of individuals in
the community who might benefit from community
services but who do not receive them, providing such
services could increase use among these individuals
and result in higher program costs (Hanley, Weiner, &
Harris, 1991). Nonetheless, in light of the continuing
growth in health care costs, especially those associ-
ated with long-term care, community-based pro-
grams continue to hold great potential for the support
of individuals with intermediate levels of need.
It is clear that the family shoulders the greatest
burden in caring for infirm older individuals, espe-
cially among minority elderly persons (Brody, 1985;
Doty, 1986; Creenberg & Becker, 1988). Even when
they suffer from fairly serious disabilities, older indi-
viduals prefer to live alone or in the community
rather than enter a nursing home (McDowell,
Barniskis, & Wright, 1994; Worobey & Angel, 1990).
Although many receive some form of home health
care, many others simply do without care or rely
mainly on the assistance of family members (Soldo,
Wolf, & Agree, 1990; Wallace, Levy-Storms, & Fergu-
son, 1995). Many programs for assisting the family by
providing support to elderly parents in the commu-
nity have been proposed in recent years and it is
likely that in the future such proposals and programs
will become common (Capitman, 1986; Doty, 1986;
Horwitz & Shindelman, 1983). Due to the aging of
the baby boom generation, it is imperative that we
determine how such informal mechanisms of sup-
port might be augmented, rather than replaced, by
formal sources (Brody, Poulshock, & Masciocchi,
1978; Cantor, 1991; Stone & Kemper, 1989; World
Bank, 1994).
Most long-term care policy proposals are based on
the assumption that the elderly population is homo-
geneous in its needs (e.g., Ladd, 1995). Fernando
Torres-Gil, who is currently the Assistant Secretary
for the Department of Health and Human Services
Administration on Aging, notes that, while "Long-
term care programs and benefits generally rely on
age and/or functional ability as the criteria for receiv-
ing services and assume the aged population is ho-
mogeneous . . . it is clear that the minority elderly
population is increasing and their cultural, social,
and linguistic uniqueness will require that more than
age and functional ability be considered in the devel-
opment of long-term care policies" (1986; p. 50). This
growing cultural heterogeneity among the elderly
population will influence personal and family prefer-
ences in living arrangements and affect the long-
term care needs of different segments of the older
population (Cowart, 1994).
Although most individuals prefer to live in the com-
munity as long as possible, one's ability to do so, and
the quality of one's life in the community, are affected
by numerous factors. One's family situation and liv-
ing arrangements determine the number of individ-
uals available to help with basic physical activities of
daily living, such as dressing and bathing, as well as
with more complex instrumental tasks, such as shop-
ping and handling finances (Litwak, 1985). Racial and
ethnic groups differ significantly in living arrange-
ments and family size, factors that influence the avail-
ability of informal support (Angel & Angel, 1992).
In addition, there is mounting evidence that cul-
tural factors influence the role of the family in the
care of elderly individuals, thereby affecting the
overall assistance package that elderly individuals
require (Burr, 1990; Worobey & Angel, 1990). At-
tempts to develop a rational system of managed care
for the elderly must be informed by a better under-
standing of the total package of pathology different
groups of elderly individuals experience, as well as
an understanding of the ways in which cultural, eco-
nomic, and health care system factors influence the
extent of need for long-term care and specific home
health care services.

The Mexican American Elderly and Family Support
Mama Elena, you know perfectly well that being the
youngest daughter means you have to take care of me
until the day I die. ... but in my opinion, you don't
have an opinion, and that's all I want to hear about it.
For generations, not a single person in my family has
ever questioned this tradition, and no daughter of
mine is going to be the one to start. . . (Laura Esquivel,
Like Water for Chocolate, pp. 10-11).
The Mexican American population, like all other
cultural groups, is unique in ways that can potentially
affect the health and welfare of its elderly members.
Because of high fertility and historically high levels of
both legal and illegal immigration, the Mexican
American population is among the fastest growing
minority groups in the United States (Bean & Tienda,
1987). Mexican Americans are also on average youn-
ger than blacks or non-Hispanic whites. Yet, like the
population at large, Mexican Americans have experi-
enced decreases in mortality from both acute and
chronic diseases and, consequently, the number of
Mexican Americans over the age of 65 is growing
rapidly. By the year 2010, the number of Hispanics in
the United States over the age of 65, of whom Mexi-
can Americans are the largest group, is projected to
increase by approximately two and a half times (An-
gel & Hogan, 1992). Like their non-Hispanic white
counterparts, older Mexican Americans will be living
longer and will suffer from the chronic illnesses that
accompany aging. This fact means that the cost of
caring for older infirm Mexican Americans will inevi-
tably increase (Torres-Gil & Fielder, 1986-87).
Although Mexican American fertility rates have
dropped along with those of the rest of the popula-
tion, the Mexican American population continues to
have larger-than-average families. Furthermore,
there is evidence to suggest that a traditional orienta-
tion may instill in both parents and children alike a
desire for greater contact and expectations that chil-
dren should be responsible for aging parents (Sub-
committee on Aging, 1994). In what follows, we ex-
amine patterns in living arrangements and, for those
who live with their children, their reasons for doing
so. The data suggest that for older Mexican Ameri-
cans, living with children is still a desirable and viable
option. We also examine responses to the question
of where an older individual would care to live in the
event of incapacity. Our ultimate objective is to get at
least a rudimentary idea of the long-term health care
needs and desires of the older Mexican American
population. Up until now, those desires have been
purely a matter of specification or have been as-
sumed to be identical to those of other groups.
Traditional portrayals of the Mexican-origin family
convey the image of a multigenerational household
governed by norms of mutual assistance and primary
reliance on the family (Cratton, 1987; Griswold del
Castillo, 1984). Indeed, a highly familistic orientation
among Mexican Americans has been documented by
demographers, ethnographers, and sociologists (Be-
cerra, 1983,1988; Burr & Mutchler, 1992; Markides &
Martin, 1983; Sotomayor & Garcia, 1993). Some ob-
servers find that, on average, Mexican Americans do
indeed have more cohesive family support systems
than non-Hispanics (e.g., Angel & Angel, 1992; Be-
cerra, 1988; Keefe & Padilla, 1987; Weeks & Cuellar,
1981). Yet, everyone is affected by social and eco-
nomic change, and it is clear that for older Mexican
Americans, the decision to live alone, to live with
family, or to enter a nursing home is influenced by a
complex set of objective factors, as well as by one's
attitudes and life experiences (Weeks & Cuellar, 1981 ;
Williams, 1990). As among non-Hispanics, many
Mexican American adult children are unable to pro-
vide either financial or instrumental aid to their aging
and infirm relatives (Grebler, Moore, & Guzman,
1970; Markides & Martin, 1983). In many cases, dis-
tance, low income, and inadequate housing make it
difficult for the family to play the role it may have
played in previous years.
The family, though, continues to offer great possi-
bilities for the care of the elderly. Recent evidence
from the Canadian Survey of Aging indicates that
elderly parents would like to live with their children if
they could feel certain that they would be welcome
(Connidis, 1983). Many researchers have suggested
that extended households may represent a response
to poverty and provide the possibility of mutual aid
and assistance among family members. In some
cases, living with relatives may be a realistic substi-
tute for formal care (Angel & Tienda, 1982; Kane &
Kane, 1981; Litwak, 1985). Studies show that Mexican
families tend to live near relatives and close friends,
have frequent interactions with family members, and
exchange a wide range of goods and services that
include babysitting, temporary housing, personal
advice, nursing during times of illness, and emo-
tional support (Muller & Espenshade, 1985).
Method
In the following analyses, we employ data from the
Hispanic Established Population for Epidemiological
Studies of the Elderly (H-EPESE), a large, multistage
probability sample of Mexican Americans 65 and
older who reside in the southwestern states of Texas,
California, New Mexico, Arizona, and Colorado
(Markides, Rudkin, Angel, & Espino, in press). The
present analysis is based on the first wave of the
study, which consists of a survey of 3,050 individuals.
The overall response rate for the respondents is 86%.
All subjects were interviewed in their home for ap-
proximately two hours by trained interviewers who
assessed the respondent's functional capacity and
collected information on nativity status, demograph-
ics, household structure, and socioeconomic status.
In the following analyses, we employ variables that
capture aspects of economic and structural con-
straints on choices in living arrangements. For those
individuals who were too cognitively or physically
debilitated to participate in the study, information on
objective questions was obtained from a proxy famil-
iar with the subject. Ten percent of the completed
interviews were with proxy respondents. These cases
are dropped from analyses in which subjective infor-
mation is employed.
466 The Gerontologist
Measures and Analyses. -- In the first stage of the
analysis, we present descriptive statistics to show the
association between living arrangements, prefer-
ences in long-term care arrangements, and func-
tional disability among native and foreign-born el-
derly men and women. In order to characterize their
living arrangements, we employ a detailed typology
of living arrangements with eight categories based
on household size, marital status of the respondent,
and the relationship of the respondent to the head of
the household. For married individuals, the living
arrangements we examine include (1) those who live
only with their spouse; (2) those who live with
others, but in a situation in which neither of the older
couple is the head of household; and (3) those who
live with others in a situation in which the older
couple is the head of the household. Among the
unmarried, we compare the living arrangements of
(4) unmarried individuals living alone to those who
live with others in four different arrangements based
on sex and household headship status, (5) unmarried
women heading their own household, (6) unmarried
women living with someone else who is the head of
the household, (7) unmarried men heading their
own household, and (8) unmarried men living with
someone else who is the head of the household.
We assess functional limitations using three
standard scales that tap separate dimensions of dis-
ability. Two scales tap dimensions of physical dis-
ability, and the third assesses problems with more
complex daily social activities. The first physical dis-
ability scale measures an individual's capacity to
perform basic physical activities of daily living
(PADLs) without help, and includes questions con-
cerning bathing or showering, dressing, personal
grooming, eating, transferring (getting in and out of
chair), walking across a room, getting outside, and
using the toilet. The second physical functioning
scale (ROSOW) is a modified version of the Rosow-
Breslau scale and includes three questions on gross
mobility, whether the respondent needs help with
heavy housework, walking up and'down stairs or to
a second floor, and walking half a mile (Rosow &
Breslau, 1966). The third scale measures problems
associated with social activities of daily living
(SADLs), and includes questions concerning diffi-
culty performing routine household chores, using a
telephone, shopping for groceries, driving an auto-
mobile or traveling alone on public transportation,
doing light housework, taking medicine, preparing
meals, and handling money.
Results
Table 1 contrasts the native-born to the foreign-
born on the basis of the eight arrangements listed
above. What emerges is a clear picture of a greater
familial orientation among the foreign-born. Fewer of
the married foreign-born than the native-born live
with only their spouse (living arrangement 1), and
although only a small fraction of married couples live
with someone else in a situation in which they are not
the heads of the household, a larger fraction of those

who do are foreign-born (living arrangement 3). In a
majority of these cases, the head of household is an
adult child. Among unmarried females, a smaller frac-
tion of the foreign-born are heads of household and a
larger fraction live with someone else, again usually
an adult child. Although relatively few single males
live with someone else when they are not the head of
household, a larger fraction of those who do are
foreign-born. These data, therefore, suggest that the
foreign-born elderly are more likely to live with their
children than are the native-born.
Table 2 contrasts the native-born to the foreign-
born in terms of sociodemographic characteristics,
health, and disability. The data reveal a profile that is
consistent with the lesser degree of structural and
economic assimilation that is typical of recent immi-
grants. The foreign-born live in larger households
and have less education and lower household and
personal incomes than the native-born. In addition,
the table reveals that foreign-born elderly individuals
are more likely than their native-born counterparts
to report problems with mobility and instrumental
(social) activities of daily living (Rosow and SADL).
The greater difficulty with social functioning among
foreign-born individuals is accounted for largely by
the problems they encounter with driving or obtain-
ing transportation, areas in which the foreign-born
are clearly handicapped. These data indicate, there-
fore, that the foreign-born are at a clear socioeco-
nomic disadvantage and are handicapped in terms of
their ability to get around. These disadvantages al-
most certainly increase their reliance on family.
There has been a great deal of speculation as to
what accounts for the tendency of older Mexican
Americans to live with their children. Our data allow
us to go beyond speculation and examine responses
to questions concerning preferences in current liv-
ing arrangements and where one would care to live

response we examined was one to a question con-
cerning why those older individuals who live with
their children choose to do so. The responses to this
question for married and unmarried native-born and
foreign-born respondents are presented in Table 3,
separately for men and women. A respondent could
have chosen more than one reason, so the propor-
tions do not add to 100%, therefore we do not
present tests of significance. This table reveals that a

larger proportion of foreign-born than native-born
men and women who live with their children say that
they live with them because both parties want it that
way. Again, this difference between the native- and
the foreign-born reveals a more traditional orienta-
tion toward the family and the duties of children to
aging parents among the foreign-born.
The data also show that a larger fraction of foreign-
born than native-born men and women live with
their children because the parents provide their
adult children with financial or child care assistance.
On the other hand, a significantly smaller fraction of
foreign-born than native-born men and women re-
port that they live with children, or rather that their
children live with them, because they are the head of
household (37.3% vs 51.4% and 17.8% vs 45.3%,
respectively). These data suggest, therefore, that
among the foreign-born, it is more often the case
that parents move in with their children than that
children move in with their parents.
In order to extend this analysis, we examined re-
sponses to a question that asked respondents
whether they were satisfied with their current living
arrangement and if not, where they would prefer to
live. The most striking finding was that only 115
individuals indicated that they were unsatisfied with
their present living arrangement and would prefer to
live somewhere else (data not shown). An additional
36 respondents stated that they would prefer to live
somewhere else but did not specify where that might
be. Of course, a question of this sort cannot elicit
subtle dissatisfactions with current living arrange-
ments and, we suspect, most people normalize their
situation if, in fact, some other arrangement is unre-
alistic. Nonetheless, the answers to this question
suggest that most individuals are quite satisfied with
their current living arrangements.
In Table 4, we examine another facet of the issue
and present data on where the older respondent
would care to live in the event that he or she could no
longer take care of him- or herself. Nearly 20% of
foreign-born in comparison to 13% of native-born
Mexican American couples who are currently living
only with their spouse state that they would want to
live with their children in the event that they could
no longer take care of themselves. On the other
hand, native-born elderly individuals who are living

with only their spouse are much more likely than
their foreign-born counterparts to express a desire to
enter a nursing home.
Foreign-born Mexican Americans who live with
family also express a stronger desire than natives to
continue living with children in the event of declin-
ing health (44.0% vs 38.1 %). On the other hand, twice
as many of the native-born than the foreign-born
who are currently living with family chose a nursing
home as an option. Regardless of their current living
arrangement, then, these data indicate that in con-
trast to the native-born, foreign-born older persons
expect to live with their children in the event of
incapacity.
Our objective so far has been to shed some light on
the reasons that certain older Mexican-origin indi-
viduals choose to live with their children. The data so
far appear to suggest that it is because the older
person, at least, wants it that way. Of course, such a
response may mask some other reason, such as pov-
erty or poor health, on the part of the elderly person.
An individual who is living with his or her child be-
cause he or she cannot afford to live alone or because
he or she is physically unable to care for himself or

satisfaction with a situation that is really made neces-

the extent to which this phenomenon occurs, in Table

aStated reason for living with family.
bResponses include (1) their children want them to live there or (2) it's best if parents live with their children.
Vol. 36, No. 4,1996 469
might have said that health was a reason, but also
have stated that they prefer it that way.)
As one would expect, a large proportion of both
the native- and the foreign-born who cite health as a
reason for living with family have problems with
physical activities of daily living and with SADLs. Yet,
interestingly, a substantial fraction of those who cite
desire as a reason for living with children also suffer
from functional limitations and poor health, as do
those who state some other reason. These data at
least suggest that among Mexican American elders,
living with one's child is a culturally legitimate way of
coping with poor health. Among older Mexican
Americans who state that they want to live with
family, culturally based values may interact with ne-
cessity to determine living arrangements.
Our next and final step in the analysis is to examine
living arrangements in a multivariate framework in
order to determine whether other demographic fac-
tors, either economic need or health, are significant
determinants of living arrangements for the native
and foreign born. In Table 6, we present four logistic
regression models that assess the impact of house-
hold economic status and an older person's func-
tional status on the probability of extended living
arrangements for both the native and foreign born. In
Model 1 (columns one and two), we predict the likeli-
hood of living alone versus the probability of living
with others among native- and foreign-born unmar-
ried individuals. Model 2 focuses on native- and
foreign-born married individuals and assesses the
probability of living with only one's spouse as op-
posed to living with one's spouse and children. In
these models, we control for various socioeconomic
and other risk factors, including age, sex, education,
household income, and the functional status varia-
bles. These models also include a global health rating.
Model 1 reveals no clear independent effect of
disability, i.e., PADLs or mobility (Rosow), on the
probability that a single person lives alone or with
others. In contrast, this model reveals that low in-
come is associated with an increased probability of
living alone, regardless of nativity status. Almost by
definition, those who live alone have lower house-
hold incomes than those who live with others. Joint
living arrangements, therefore, serve to increase an
older person's economic status. Model 2, which fo-
cuses on married individuals, reveals that for both
the native and foreign born, those individuals who
live with their spouse only have lower family incomes
than those who live with their spouse and others.
Again, as in the case of single individuals, net of
income and functional status measures have no sta-
tistically significant effect on the probability of living
with others. For both single individuals and couples,
therefore, living with children increases overall eco-
nomic welfare. It also appears that functional inca-
pacity is not an overriding factor in determining
extended living arrangements among older Mexican
Americans. However, as these data and previous
studies show, it is clear that for older persons, health
and economic need are interrelated (see Burr &
Mutchler, 1992).
Discussion
If behavior is an indicator of preference, most older
people prefer to live with their spouse while he or she
is alive and alone or with family members after the
spouse dies. Our data also show that in the event of
incapacity, many older Mexican Americans, and espe-
cially the more traditionally oriented, foreign-born
among them, living with their children is a desirable
alternative. Only a minority of our respondents ex-
pressed the desire to enter a nursing home in the
event of incapacity, although among those who live
alone, approximately one third stated that they would
choose a nursing home in the event of incapacity,
perhaps reflecting the lack of an alternative.
Future long-term care policy should make use of
these potential family resources and optimize the
family's options for the care of their infirm elderly
parents. We certainly do not advocate forcing older
parents onto unwilling children. Rather, we advocate
the effective use of culturally based options that
increase the choices available to elderly men and
women and their families. Such options would in-
volve formal systems that complement, rather than
replace, the family as the main source of long-term
care for older persons. If the objective of long-term
care policy is to optimize well-being while containing
costs, we must take individual and family prefer-
ences into account (Wiener, Hanley, & Illston, 1992).
Our data suggest that a more traditional cultural
orientation, measured in terms of nativity, is associ-
ated with a greater reliance on family, and perhaps
with norms and values that dictate that older parents
should rely on their children for instrumental if not
necessarily financial assistance. The data also suggest
that among native-born individuals, these norms and
values may be weakened, although they do not dis-
appear. As among other groups, the family remains
the main source of instrumental support for older
Mexican Americans, and policies that weaken the
commitment of one generation to the next should be
avoided.
Even for groups such as Mexican Americans who
have traditionally been portrayed as familistic,
though, social change and cultural and structural
assimilation take their toll on family life. For Mexican
Americans, as for everyone else, economic con-
straints limit options in living arrangements, and the
necessity for women to work limits their availability
as full-time caregivers for older parents. It is also
clear that the motivations for extended living ar-
rangements are complex and that the needs and
desires of everyone involved play a role. In our
sample, a significant number of older Mexican Amer-
icans took their children into their households be-
cause of the children's needs. In 1982, Angel and
Tienda posed the question as to whether extended
living arrangements represent a response to poverty
or whether they reflect a cultural orientation. They
concluded that both sets of factors play a role. These
newer data suggest that this is still the case among
the elderly and their families.
Our findings carry certain implications for public

policy toward the long-term care of the elderly. The
objective of such policy is to provide the highest
quality health care and community support at a rea-
sonable cost (National Academy on Aging, 1994).
Ideally, we wish to allow people to remain in their
homes and in the community for as long as they are
able. Institutionalization is an option of last resort,
and one which most individuals and families resist
until there is no longer a choice. If it were possible to
maintain even a fraction of the elderly in the commu-
nity for longer periods at a reasonable cost, the
payoff in terms of quality of life alone might well be
worth the expense. In order to reach this objective,
however, a better understanding of the family and
living situations of the elderly, as well as their prefer-
ences, is necessary. We must also begin to identify
the health resource needs of local communities if we
as a society are to help provide effective services to
the elderly.
The optimal use of culturally specific family and
community resources for the care of the elderly may
in the future become a central goal of health care
policy (Torres-Gil & Fielder, 1986-87). In certain
areas, especially those currently lacking basic pri-
mary care and mental health services, the barriers
that impede the introduction of more efficient health
care delivery and formal support systems will be
formidable (Yeatts, Crow, & Folts, 1992). Although
efficient mechanisms for financing and organizing
health care delivery to underserved areas have not
Vol.36, No. 4, 1996 471
yet been fully developed, there is reason for at least
modest optimism that such mechanisms can be de-
veloped. Although we have no hard data, there is
enough anecdotal experience with outreach pro-
grams that make use of nurse practitioners and other
health care professionals, as well as primary care
physicians who are familiar with the culture of the
clientele they serve, to suggest useful avenues to
pursue in developing effective health care delivery
systems. Many of these involve the patient's family.
Providing care to poor older individuals in urban
areas presents us with an entirely different set of
issues. The availability of kin and formal community
support mechanisms differs greatly between the in-
ner city and more rural areas. In recent years, we
have become increasingly aware of the role of the
family in the care of the chronically ill, whether they
be the chronically physically ill, the severely and
persistently mentally ill, or the infirm elderly. Given
the economic and social stresses that many families
must endure, their commitment to care for needy
family members is admirable and should be aug-
mented by formal services designed to ease the bur-
den of care and to improve the quality of life for all
involved. The accomplishment of this goal will re-
quire a much more sophisticated understanding of
the potential role of families and the constraints that
they face in the care of their elderly members.
