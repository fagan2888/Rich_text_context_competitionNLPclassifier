The Role of Social Relationships in
Predicting Loneliness: The National
Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
Sharon Shiovitz-Ezra and Sara A. Leitsch
The authors explore associations between objective and subjective social network characteristics
and loneliness in later life,using data from the National Social Life,Health,andAging Project,
a nationally representative sample of individuals ages 57 to 85 in the United States.Hierarchical
linear regression was used to examine the associations between measures of objective and
subjective social network characteristics and their importance in predicting loneliness across
marital status.For the entire sample,as well as the married­cohabitating subsample,objective
indicators such as frequency of contact with social network members were negatively associated
with feelings of loneliness, net of background characteristics. However, the authors' analysis
highlights the contribution of subjective perceptions of social ties, the quality of marriage in
later life for those engaged in marital or cohabitating relationships,and the quality of familial
ties for the nonmarried older adults. In a married­cohabitating subsample, the subjective
perceptions of one's relationship with the partner explained, by itself, 7% of the variance in
loneliness, whereas the quality of family ties explained an additional 6% of the variance in
loneliness in the nonmarried sample.Based on the present findings,practical implications for
social workers are discussed.
Key words: later life; loneliness; social networks; subjective perceptions
In research, multiple definitions of loneliness
have been proposed. Yet almost uniformly, a
distinction has been made between loneliness
and aloneness (Andersson, 1998). Loneliness is ap-
proached as a discrete,subjective construct associated
with the objective social situation but not synony-
mous with the actual circumstances.Thus, people
can feel lonely in the company of many others or be
alone without feeling lonely.It also has been agreed
that loneliness is a painful or unpleasant experience
(Peplau & Perlman, 1982).
Cognitive theory,which is a major theoretical ap-
proach guiding loneliness research,focuses on one's
perception and evaluation of social ties. Loneliness,
according to this theoretical point of view, results
from the perceived discrepancy between desired
and actual social relationships or the subjective gap
between one's optimal levels of social relationships
and achieved levels of same.A perceived deficit in
one's social interactions is crucial in creating a sense
of loneliness. Past experience and experience of
other people in the social environment shape this
evaluation process. Contrary to other important
theoretical views of loneliness, such as the social
needs approach (represented byWeiss, 1973, 1987),
cognitive theory suggests an indirect relation be-
tween objective deficits in one's social network
and feelings of loneliness. Cognitive processes of
perception and evaluation serve as mediators (de
Jong Gierveld, 1998; Peplau & Perlman, 1982).
In recent years, interest in aging and loneliness
has grown for two primary reasons.First,loneliness
is a socially prevalent phenomenon among elderly
people. For example, in a representative sample of
British community-dwelling older people, almost
40% experienced loneliness to some degree (Vic-
tor, Scambler, Bowling, & Bond, 2005). Similar
prevalence rates were recently found in Finland
among a random sample of people age 75 and over
(Savikko, Routasalo, Tilvis, Strandberg, & Pitkälä,
2005).In the United States,Theeke (2007) reported
that approximately 17% of people age 50 and above
reported loneliness.
Second, loneliness can have deleterious effects
in multiple domains of elders' lives, including both
physical and mental health. In the Chicago Health,
Aging, and Social Relations Study, loneliness was
associated with elevated systolic blood pressure,even
158 Social Work Research Volume 34, Number 3 September 2010
after controlling for demographics,health behaviors,
and various psychosocial factors. Moreover, loneli-
ness was a unique predictor of age-related increases
in systolic blood pressure (Hawkley, Masi, Berry, &
Cacioppo,2006).Loneliness was also found to affect
cardiovascular activity in everyday life by predicting
higher basal total peripheral resistance and lower
cardiac output (Hawkley, Burleson, Berntson, &
Cacioppo,2003).Moreover,loneliness has predicted
mortality in elderly people in a longitudinal study
(Penninx et al., 1997).
Along with effects on physical health, loneliness
is associated with poor mental health.In both cross-
sectional and longitudinal studies,greater loneliness
was associated with higher levels of depression.
Moreover, loneliness remained a risk factor for de-
pression after central demographic and psychosocial
factors were taken into account (Cacioppo,Hughes,
Waite,Hawkley,&Thisted,2006).Loneliness was also
found to be negatively associated with emotional
well-being (Lee & Ishii-Kuntz,1987) and positively
associated with serious thoughts of suicide and
parasuicide (Stravynski & Boyer, 2001).
According to the cognitive model for concep-
tualizing loneliness,suggested by de Jong Gierveld
(1987), two domains of the social network form
the most likely determinants of loneliness among
older adults. The first, termed "the descriptive
characteristics of the social network," represents
the objective aspect of social contacts, as mea-
sured by network size and frequency of contact.
However, study of objective determinants yields
inconsistent results as to their contribution to the
prediction of loneliness in later life. In a recent
study, levels of contact with family or friends and
also proximity and number of family or friends did
not demonstrate statistically significant association
with self-reported loneliness (Victor et al., 2005).
However, among 20-year survivors of the Bangor
Longitudinal Study on Ageing, married status
and children living nearby were protective factors
against loneliness (Wenger & Burholt,2004).Also,
a study of 1,071 participants in the Senior Citizens
Nutrition andActivities Program in Florida found
that subjects with no children and no friends were
lonelier than their counterparts with children
and friends (Mullins & Elston, 1996).The latter is
consistent with a Swedish study of elderly people
age 75 and over, which demonstrated that 50% of
those who reported no friends experienced lone-
liness (Holmen, Ericsson, Andersson, & Winblad,
1992). However, marital status had no impact on
loneliness (Mullins & Elston, 1996).
The second domain emphasizes the quality of
social ties, as measured by perceived availability of
support and satisfaction with interpersonal relation-
ships, and is termed the "subjective evaluations of
the social network." Although both the objective
and subjective network aspects were included in
de Jong Gierveld's framework,she underscored the
importance of the latter one,which is argued to be
more closely linked to loneliness than the objec-
tive domain.Many other scholars have emphasized
the importance of subjective assessments of social
interactions over objective social circumstances
in predicting well-being outcomes (for example,
Antonucci & Akiyama, 1991; Bowling, 1994), par-
ticularly for loneliness (Cutrona, 1982; Peplau &
Perlman, 1982).
Nevertheless, studies most frequently use objec-
tive measures of social networks as determinates of
loneliness;the subjective domain is less often tested
(Pinquart & Sörensen, 2001). Several recent stud-
ies that incorporated subjective assessments of the
network--measured by perceived social support--
found statistically significant inverse associations
with loneliness (Kahn, Hessling, & Russell, 2003;
Kim, 1999;Tiikkainen & Heikkinen, 2005). How-
ever, these studies' findings are not generalizable
because of their select samples.For example,Kahn et
al.(2003) used a sample of 100 older adults attending
a senior community center,whereasTiikkainen and
Heikkinen's (2005) sample comprised 207 residents
of central Finland at age 80.
Moreover, the literature suggests that social ties
are not always beneficent and supportive, but can
also be hurtful (Rook & Pietromonaco,1987).Be-
neficent and negativity characteristics can co-occur
in the same relationships (Ruehlman & Wolchik,
1988).Thus, there is a serious need to explore the
positive and negative aspects of social interactions.
This arena was explored previously in relation to
depressed mood (Schuster,Kessler,&Aseltine,1990),
life satisfaction, and positive and negative mood
(Walen & Lachman, 2000), but not in regard to
loneliness in later life.
In sum,there seems to be no prevailing consensus
about the contribution of the objective domain of
social relationships in relation to loneliness.There
is also insufficient knowledge concerning the con-
tribution of subjective quality of the same ties.The
current study, using contemporary data from the
159
Shiovitz-Ezra and Leitsch / Social Relationships Loneliness: The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
recently implemented National Social Life,Health,
and Aging Project (NSHAP), contributes to lone-
liness research in two ways. It explored both the
objective and the subjective characteristics of older
adults' social networks.The latter aspect was tested
in a comprehensive manner (perceived support and
strain) while using a large, generalizable sample.
This latter aspect is particularly important, because
much of loneliness research has been criticized as
stemming from locally based samples, thus limiting
the generalization of the various findings (Victor
et al., 2005).
Method
The current study used data from the first wave of
NSHAP that is focused on older adult interper-
sonal connections,including marriage,family,social
relationships, and sexuality as well as the health of
older adults.The general aims of NSHAP wave 1
were to describe the health of older adults;evaluate
the relationship between older adult interpersonal
connections and health;examine the importance of
gender,culture,and economic context for older adult
health and social connectedness;identify the biologi-
cal pathways through which social connectedness
affects various aspects of health;and describe health
behaviors and health care use among older adults,
including their perceptions of patient­physician
communication.
NSHAP is a nationally representative probability
sample of noninstitutionalized people ages 57 to 85
years, selected from households across the United
States. NSHAP is a multistage, stratified area prob-
ability sample.The sample for NSHAP was gener-
ated using the same field operation that was used
for the 2004 wave of the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS).The HRS is a nationally representa-
tive sample of individuals 50 years and older living
in the United States that is sponsored by the Na-
tional Institute on Aging and is conducted by the
University of Michigan. Participants take part in
a biennial interview that covers a range of topics,
including income, wealth, work, retirement, family
support systems,health,and health care use (http://
hrsonline.isr.umich.edu/).
Through an innovative collaboration between
NSHAP and HRS, the screening for both surveys
was carried out as a single operation.The sample
designs for NSHAP and HRS were thus identi-
cal at the area stages, in which geographic areas
were selected into the sample with probabilities
proportional to their sizes. Two additional sam-
pling stages were (1) a household selection stage
in which households were selected for screening
and (2) an individual selection stage in which one
eligible person in each household was selected for
the NSHAP interview.The 2004 HRS new cohort
required adults ages 50 to 56.To avoid overlap with
the HRS sample, the age range of 57 to 85 years
was selected for the NSHAP investigation.African
Americans, Latinos, men, and the older age group
were oversampled to provide adequate representa-
tion of these subgroups (for a detailed description of
the sample design, see O'Muircheartaigh, Eckman,
& Smith, 2009).
Two-hour in-home interviews were conducted
in English and Spanish by professional interviewers
using a computer-assisted personal interview.The
interviewer training included the completion of a
home study packet, a four-day in-person training,
and booster trainings, which were held by phone
during data collection to provide help with field
efficiency and gain cooperation (Smith et al.,
2009). Data collection was executed between July
2005 and March 2006, yielding 3,005 respondents
(1,455 men and 1,550 women). The weighted
sample response rate was 75.5%.Data collection also
included a brief "leave behind" self-administrated
questionnaire.This questionnaire was given to the
respondents at the end of the in-person interview
to fill out and mail back.The response rate for the
postinterview questionnaire was approximately 84%.
(For detailed information on NSHAP methodol-
ogy, see O'Muircheartaigh et al., 2009, and Smith
et al., 2009.)
Study Variables
Loneliness. NSHAP used a shortened version of
one of the most widespread scales of loneliness:
the Revised UCLA Loneliness Scale (R-UCLA)
(Russell,Peplau,& Cutrona,1980).For use in large
surveys, Hughes, Waite, Hawkley, and Cacioppo
(2004) shortened the original 20-item scale to
three questions with a simplified set of response
categories. Respondents were asked to rate, on a
three-point scale (ranging from hardly ever to of-
ten), how often they felt a lack of companionship,
left out, or isolated from others. Responses to each
question are summed,with higher scores indicating
greater loneliness.In the NSHAP sample,this scale
achieved good internal reliability,with a Cronbach's
alpha of .81.
160 Social Work Research Volume 34, Number 3 September 2010
Social Network Characteristics. Objective net
work characteristics: For the purposes of this
analysis, current marital status was measured using
two categories: married or cohabiting and other.
Respondents also reported the number of living
children and grandchildren they have. In addi-
tion, respondents reported the number of relatives
and friends they have on a six-point ordinal scale
ranging from none to more than 20. Frequency of
social contact with neighbors was measured on a
five-point ordinal scale ranging from hardly ever
to daily or almost every day, whereas frequency of
contact with friends and relatives was measured on
a seven-point scale ranging from never to several
times a week.
Subjective characteristics of the social network:
The subjective characteristics (positive and nega-
tive) were operationalized through four indicators
taken from the 2002 HRS that were originally
developed for the MacArthur Midlife in the United
States survey (MIDUS) to evaluate perceived social
support and perceived strain (Honda & Jacobson,
2005;Walen & Lachman,2000).Items were asked in
three loops in reference to the respondent's partner,
friends,and family.Included were two indicators of
perceived support: (1) "How often can you open
up to your (husband/wife/partner) if you need to
talk about your worries:Would you say hardly ever,
some of the time,or often?"(2)"How often can you
rely on (him/her) for help if you have a problem?"
(with the same response scale). The two indicators
of perceived strain were as follows: (1) "How often
does your (husband/wife/partner) make too many
demands on you?Would you say hardly ever, some
of the time,or often?"(2)"How often does (he/she)
criticize you?" (with the same response scale). In
accordance with other studies using these indicators,
we summed the two perceived support indicators
and the two strain measures separately for spouse,
relatives,and friends.In NSHAP,as in MIDUS,factor
analysis supported this solution (Walen & Lachman,
2000).For the three types of relationships,two fac-
tors (perceived support and perceived strain) were
extracted on the basis of two eigenvalues greater
than 1 while using principal component analysis
withVarimax rotation.
Covariates
Health status was measured using a self-reported
question:"Would you say your health is excellent,
very good, good, fair or poor?" Responses to this
item ranged from 1 to 5, with higher scores indi-
cating better subjective health. We included two
additional measures of health: eyesight and hearing
loss. Respondents were asked to rate their eyesight
in the same manner that they rated their health and
to indicate on a yes/no question whether they had
experienced a hearing loss.
Sociodemographic data--age (57 to 64,65 to 74,
75 to 85), gender (men, women), education (less
than high school, high school, some college, bach-
elor's degree or more),ethnicity (white,not white),
and subjective income--were gathered through
self-report. In the case of subjective income, the
respondents were asked the following:"Compared
with most of the people you know personally, like
your friends, and work associates, would you say
that your household income is far below average,
below average, average, above average or far above
average?"
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate correlations were used to examine the
relationships between individual predictors and
loneliness.We used hierarchical linear regressions to
examine the associations between various measures
of objective and subjective social network character-
istics and the relative importance of each domain in
predicting loneliness (using the difference in the R2s
as an estimator). Using the entire sample, three sets
of variables were added sequentially: (1) background
characteristics,(2) objective network characteristics,
and (3) subjective network characteristics. In this
sample,a substantial number of respondents did not
have a spouse or a cohabitating partner.Therefore,
we ran two additional sets of regressions, among
the unmarried and married subsamples separately.
In the unmarried sample, we used the same three
models as in the entire sample; to examine how
perceptions of a partner relationship were related
to loneliness for the married group, we executed a
third hierarchical regression. For this analysis, the
first three models were run as indicated earlier,and a
fourth model estimated the contribution of subjec-
tive perceptions of the respondent's relationship to
his or her partner. In all three stages of analysis, we
used weights to account for differential probabilities
of selection and differential nonresponse.The com-
plex sampling design used in NSHAP requires the
use of weights in the analyses to provide unbiased
estimates of the population. The weight variable
used in these analyses accounts for the probability
161
Shiovitz-Ezra and Leitsch / Social Relationships Loneliness: The National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project
of the household's selection for the HRS screening
operation, including the probability of selection of
the areas that contain the case and the probability of
the household selection and the household's prob-
ability of selection for the NSHAP survey, which
accounts for any adjustments due to subsampling of
nonminority cases,the probability of selection of the
household for NSHAP,and the probability of selec-
tion of the given individual within the household.
The weight variable also accounts for differential
nonresponse (see O'Muircheartaigh et al.,2009,for
a detailed description of weighting procedures and
available weights for use in the public data).STATA
9.0 was used for the analyses.
Results
Background characteristics of the NSHAP sample
and differences in mean loneliness scores across
gender, marital status, ethnicity, income, education,
and health groups are presented in Table 1. The
loneliness scale ranges from 3 to 9,with higher scores
reflecting greater loneliness.The mean of loneliness
for the entire sample was 3.99 (SE = 0.04; 95% CI
3.9,4.07),suggesting a relatively low level of expe-
rienced loneliness. However, on the bivariate level,
women,nonmarried individuals,black and Hispanic
people, and people with lower income levels and
lower education reported greater loneliness. The
better one's perceived health, the less loneliness
one felt. Among these relationships, being married
or cohabiting appeared as an important protective
factor against loneliness.Age and hearing loss were
not significantly correlated to feelings of loneliness
(not shown).
The bivariate relationships between objective and
subjective network characteristics and loneliness can
be found inTable 2.Each subjective subscale ranges
from 2 to 6, with higher scores indicating greater
perceived support or strain. In general, older adults
perceived their network as more supportive than
strained.The direction of the relationships between
the subjective network characteristics and loneliness
were as expected. Supportiveness received from a
spouse or partner, relatives, and friends was associ-
ated with less loneliness.Strained relationships were
associated with higher levels of loneliness. With
partners,perceived support was more closely linked
to loneliness than perceived strain. The opposite,
however,was found concerning relatives and friends,
with the negative characteristics more dominantly
associated with loneliness.
We also tested the bivariate associations between
objective network characteristics and loneliness
(see Table 2).The number of relatives, number of
friends, frequency of contact with neighbors and
with relatives,and frequency of contact with friends
had significant negative relationships with experi-
enced loneliness (­.17,­.24,­.10,­.15,respectively).
However, we did not find a significant association
with number of children and grandchildren (not
shown).
Hierarchical regressions were used to examine
the importance of objective and subjective social
network features in predicting loneliness,net of the
effect of demographic characteristics (see Table 3).
Regressions included only variables that showed
significant correlations with loneliness at the bivari-
ate level. In model 1, when only the background
explanatory variables were entered, better income
and subjective health (general and eyesight) were
inversely associated with feelings of loneliness.
Men were also less lonely than women. In model
2,with objective network measures added,the most
powerful protective factor was being married.The
other background factors from model 1 remained
significant,excluding gender.As expected,in model
3,strained family relationships were positively associ-
ated with loneliness,and positive family relationships
were negatively associated with loneliness.Surpris-
ingly, perceived supportiveness (positive and nega-
tive) from friends was not related to loneliness.
To determine the relative contributions of the
objective and subjective network domains in pre-
dicting loneliness, we tested the difference in R2.
In model 1, 9% of the variance in loneliness was
explained.Adding the objective network indicators
increased the ratio of the explained variance to 15%,
and the difference in R2 between the two models was
significant.Significant additional improvement was
shown when the subjective network characteristics
were introduced; model 3 explained 19% of the
variance in loneliness.The most influential predic-
tor of loneliness in the entire sample was marital
status. Being married was found to be a significant
protective predictor of loneliness.
Next,among married and cohabitating adults,we
examined the relative importance of respondents'
perceptions of support and strain from their spouse
or partner. Thus, in addition to the three models
included in the former analysis, this analysis tested
the subjective quality of the marital relationship as
well (seeTable 3).The influence of background char-
162 Social Work Research Volume 34, Number 3 September 2010
acteristics remained similar in the married group to
that of the entire sample.In model 2,all the objective
social network measures were significant predictors
of loneliness. However, when subjective appraisals
of family and friends were introduced, the number
of relatives was not significant, but the rest of the
objective measures were still influential.As for the
quality of the relationship with family and friends,
perceived family strain showed a strong positive
association with loneliness as in the entire sample.
However, in the married/cohabitating subsample,
subjective family support did not show protective
effects, whereas perceived strain from friends was
statistically associated with greater loneliness in
this group.
The quality of the marital tie proved to have a
remarkable influence on experienced loneliness
(model 4).The feeling that you can open up and
rely on your spouse achieved the strongest negative
association with loneliness. Perceived strain from a
spouse was strongly associated with greater feel-
ings of loneliness.The importance of the quality of
the marital tie was also substantiated when testing
the differences in R-squares.Adding the subjective
perceptions of the marital/cohabitating relation-
ship explained an additional 7% of the variance in
loneliness.
The importance of the subjective characteristics
of the network was shown again when the three-
level model was tested among the nonmarried group
(see Table 3).The strongest association was found
between perceived family strain and loneliness (
= 0.30), followed by a strong negative relationship
between perceived support received from the family

Discussion
The current study aimed to examine the role of
social ties in predicting loneliness among a nationally
representative sample of older people in the United
States. Our findings underscore the importance of
the objective characteristics of the social network.
For the entire sample as well as in the married
subsample, number of friends and relatives and
frequency of contact with social network members
were all inversely associated with loneliness.A strong
negative relationship was also found between the
number of relatives and feelings of loneliness among
the nonmarried group.Thus,the potentially pallia-
tive influence of objective network characteristics
on loneliness is consistent with other studies (Hol-
men et al., 1992; Lee & Ishii-Kuntz, 1987; Mullins
& Elston, 1996).
Theoretical models,however,argue that the sub-
jective quality of social contact is more closely linked
to perceived loneliness than are objective features
(Cutrona,1982;de Jong Gierveld,1987).This argu-
ment received substantial verification in our study
in both the married/cohabiting and the nonmarried
subsamples. In both groups, greater explanatory
power for the perceived characteristics was found.
Moreover, the strongest predictors of loneliness in
these groups came from the subjective appraisals of
the social network.This is in accord with another
study that found that the level of satisfaction with
the network is a leading determinate of loneliness,
whereas the size of the network has only a moderate
effect, albeit significant (Kim, 1999).
The importance of the quality of social relation-
ships is emphasized too by the fact that social ties are
not always beneficent and supportive (Carstensen,
1991).The NSHAP data allowed us to explore these
two facets of the subjective contacts--perceived sup-
port and perceived strain--providing an opportunity
to test which domain has a stronger relationship with
loneliness. Our analysis suggests that the negative
aspect is more predictive than supportive interac-
tions of loneliness. A strained familial relationship
was among the most influential predictors of lone-
liness, especially for the nonmarried respondents.
However,consistent with other studies,the objective
measures of kinship (that is,number of children and
grandchildren) did not demonstrate a relationship
with loneliness (Lee & Ishii-Kuntz,1987;Zhang &
Liu, 2007).This emphasizes the importance of the
perceived quality of family ties rather than the size
of the family network in predicting loneliness.
In addition, a notable effect of the quality of the
marital/cohabitating relationship was found. Hav-
ing a supportive spouse or partner to whom one
can open up and upon whom one can rely had the
strongest inverse relationship with self-reported
loneliness,after controlling for the effects of varying

background and objective measures. Also, strained
marital bond demonstrated a strong association with
greater loneliness.The subjective perceptions of one's
relationship with a married/cohabitating partner
explained,by itself,7% of the variance in loneliness
among the married/cohabitating subsample.
Among the entire sample,the absence of a partner
was also found to be highly correlated with feelings
of loneliness.This is in accord with other studies
(Green, Richardson, Lago, & Schatten-Jones, 2001;
Jylhä, 2004) and the conceptualization suggested
by Weiss (1973, 1987) that differentiated between
loneliness of emotional isolation and that of social
isolation,the former deriving from the absence of a
partner.Based on our last findings,we can conclude
that having a partner is a potent protective factor
against loneliness. However, when an individual is
married or cohabitating, loneliness is most closely
linked to the quality of the relationship.
Surprisingly, we did not empirically verify the
association between quality of friendship ties and
reported loneliness.This is in contrast with other
studies that have underscored the importance of
satisfaction with friend contacts (Holmen et al.,1992;
Holmen & Furukawa,2002).It might be that friends
are different than family in the sense that friends are
selected and chosen.This might imply that friends
who are not supportive and those who are harm-
ful do not remain as friends and, consequently, are
not considered when replying to the question.The
importance of friends in predicting loneliness is
evident, nevertheless, when the objective measures
of number of friends and frequency of contact with
them are explored.
A limitation of the present study is that NSHAP
used a shortened version of the R-UCLA Loneliness
Scale.This scale does not make a distinction between
the two common forms of loneliness--emotional
loneliness and social loneliness--that were originally
offered by Weiss (de Jong Gierveld & van Tilburg,
2006). Consequently, we could not explore these
domains according to their strict definitional criteria.
Another limitation was that we could not make a
distinction between situational loneliness and long-
term,chronic loneliness (Marangoni & Ickes,1989).
However,in 2011,when wave 2 data from NSHAP
become available, we will be able to explore the
distinctions between these two types of loneliness.
Using panel data will also allow us to examine a
model with causal relationships that is limited now
by the cross-sectional nature of the data.
Nonetheless, our findings demonstrate an
important relationship between objective social
network characteristics and feelings of loneliness in
later life.In particular,our investigation underscores
the contribution of subjective perceptions of social
ties, the quality of marriage in later life for those
engaged in marital or cohabitating relationship,
and the quality of familial ties for the nonmarried
older adults.
The current investigation has some practical
implications for professionals such as social work-
ers. In the literature, three levels of interventions
have been suggested to combat this painful experi-
ence of loneliness (Rook, 1984).At the individual
level, several one-to-one interventions have been
described, and most of them are based on home
visits or telephone calls conducted by professionals
or by peers (Cattan, White, Bond, & Learmouth,
2005). The second level intervention--group
interventions--was found to be much more
prevalent and effective (Cattan et al., 2005). One
example of a successful intervention at the group
level is the friendship enrichment program, devel-
oped and carried out in the Netherlands among
older women.This program aimed at coping with
loneliness by developing new beneficent friendships
(Stevens,2001;Stevens & vanTilburg,2000).At the
environmental level, removing obstacles to social
contacts was suggested. Examples include offering
free transportation for older people (Rook, 1984)
and providing access to and computer skills for
using the Internet to facilitate virtual networking
and encourage interpersonal dialogue, particularly
among older adults with disabilities (Findlay,2003).
The current investigation highlights the importance
of the quality of existent relationships,the quality of
the closest ties, the marital bond for married older
adults,and familial relationships for the nonmarried
older adults. Therefore, instead of focusing solely
on the extension of the social network in terms of
objective characteristics,a serious professional effort
should be focused at improving the quality of the
closest relationships.The current findings also sug-
gest that there is no one prescription for combating
loneliness in later life.For nonmarried older adults,
interventions should take place at the familial arena
as both support and strain from family members
are associated with feelings of loneliness. Efforts
should be made at increasing support and reducing
familial strain to cope with loneliness. However,
for their counterparts, the married or cohabiting
166 Social Work Research Volume 34, Number 3 September 2010
older adults,efforts at reducing loneliness should be
focused more on the couple level.
