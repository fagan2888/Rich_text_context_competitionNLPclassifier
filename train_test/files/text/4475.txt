Article
Although empirical and theoretical links between narcissism
and anger are well established, existing research has focused
only on narcissistic anger that results from negative feedback
that has already occurred. We examined the effects of antici-
pated negative feedback on narcissistic anger in a nonclinical
sample of U.S. college students to test experimentally for the
first time the "paradox of narcissism" theory developed by
Elliot and Thrash (2001). They argue that narcissistic competi-
tiveness includes a desire to both gain mastery of the task and
to perform better than others, which implies the need to achieve.
Narcissistic tendencies may be defined as a personality
type characterized by a high and unstable self-esteem (cf.
Baumeister, Smart, & Boden, 1996). Although narcissism
overlaps with self-esteem in its definition, narcissism has
two distinctive characteristics that are not formally associ-
ated with the concept of self-esteem: competitiveness (Elliot
& Thrash, 2001; Ziffer, 1991) and the need for admiration
(American Psychiatric Association, 2013; Raskin, Novacek,
& Hogan, 1991; Wallace & Baumeister, 2002). Thus, narcis-
sism involves maintaining high self-esteem by constant com-
parison with others. Non-narcissists with high self-esteem
are able to think of their self-worth as measured on an abso-
lute scale, without comparing their performance with others'
performance. In contrast, narcissists are only satisfied when
they outperform others or are given lavish praise by their
admirers.
Narcissism and Anger
In their original "threatened egotism model," Baumeister
et al. (1996) explained that there is a dark side of high self-
esteem. They also consider the case of high but unstable self-
esteem, which is one aspect of narcissism (cf. Baumeister,
1993; Bushman & Huesmann, 2010; Kernis, Grannemann, &
Barclay, 1989). According to their model, when those with
high and unstable self-esteem receive negative evaluations, a
perceived threat (i.e., "threatened egotism") emerges because
their inflated but uncertain self-worth has already been dero-
gated or may be derogated in the future. Consequently, they
attempt to reestablish and maintain a favorable view of self
by rejecting all negative feedback. This process involves a
negative emotion (i.e., anger) toward the source of the threat
(i.e., negative feedback) and leads people with high/unstable
self-esteem to express their anger in the form of aggression.
Thus, anger can be provoked when narcissists' aggran-
dized, but fragile self-worth, is threatened by negative

The Effects of Anticipated Negative
Feedback on Psychological States
Among Narcissists
Akiko Matsuo1 and Eros R. DeSouza2
Abstract
Although narcissism has long been researched in relation to anger, previous research examined narcissistic anger toward
negative feedback that had already occurred. In this study, we investigated the effects of anticipation of evaluation (present
vs. absent) and negative feedback (present vs. absent), using a creativity task paradigm, on state anger scores among 231 U.S.
undergraduates (76% White, 60% women). We also measured undergraduates' narcissistic tendencies and impressions of
the creativity task. Multiple regression analyses revealed a significant interaction between narcissism and negative feedback
on total anger scores, with narcissists responding with more anger than non-narcissists in the condition of negative feedback.
We also found a significant two-way interaction between narcissism and anticipation of evaluation on total enjoyment scores.
Anticipation of feedback inhibited narcissist-prone individuals from enjoying the task in the anticipation condition, but this
pattern was not present in the no-anticipation condition. Implications and recommendations to better understand the nature
of narcissism are discussed.

feedback from others. In addition, anger is not only a
response to threatened self-esteem but also a means of
regaining and retaining one's sense of superiority. That is,
anger and aggressive behavior often function as a symbolic
dominance over others (Baumeister et al., 1996).
Paradox in Narcissists and Unexplored
Areas
Although previous researchers have investigated the under-
lying cognitive processes in narcissism, they discuss just one
side of narcissists' competitiveness and the need for admira-
tion, which is their active involvement in competition and
interactions with others to flaunt their superiority over them.
Regarding this notion, Elliot and Thrash (2001) pointed
out the "paradox of narcissism." Thus, poor performance
may result in negative feedback from others or lowering self-
esteem, but narcissists must actively get involved in compe-
tition because that is the only way to maintain their
self-esteem. Elliot and Thrash refer to the paradox of narcis-
sism as the "fear of failure," in which narcissists compete to
validate their ideal self, but simultaneously fear negative
feedback. Therefore, to protect their self-esteem from possi-
ble threats, narcissists become sensitive to feedback-related
situations, which results in fragile high/unstable self-esteem.
When narcissists perceive a situation as an ego-threatening
event, they feel distressed and may become angry even
before the actual feedback is provided (cf. Barry, Chaplin, &
Grafeman, 2006; Baumeister et al., 1996). That is, if narcis-
sists anticipate that they might not perform well even when
failure has not actually happened, they are frustrated and
may become angry. This anger stems from narcissists'notion
that they are afraid of failure and want to reject all actual and
possible events that may cause a reduction in self-esteem.
However, scant research has been done about the para-
doxical characteristic (i.e., "fear of failure") in narcissists in
relation to anger. The existing literature has focused only on
the performance-based threat that has already happened. In
addition to emphasizing private events (i.e., one's perfor-
mance) alone, most of the literature has only manipulated the
positive or negative feedback condition and focused on the
outcome of the feedback brought by others (e.g., Barry et al.,
2006; Bond, Ruaro, & Wingrove, 2006; Bushman &
Baumeister, 1998; Rhodewalt & Morf, 1998; Stucke &
Sporer, 2002). This methodology lacks the perspective of the
"fear of failure" that accompanies anticipation of negative
results. It also lacks variation in experimental conditions,
because it is based on the anger effect elicited by feedback
that has already been given. However, narcissistic anger,
which is an expression of "fear of failure," should also be
observed before actual feedback is given.
The anticipation of negative feedback can possibly elicit
narcissists'anger by the frustration that stems from perceived
internal threat when they judge they are unlikely to surpass
others in a given task.
It is possible that they would become angry just by the
anticipation of negative evaluation, which would evoke as
strong reaction as actual negative evaluation about their per-
formance. If narcissists' anger might come just from antici-
pation, it might potentially be directed at anyone around
them, not just the individuals who would give them negative
evaluation. The anticipation-based anger would then possi-
bly hurt narcissists' interpersonal relationships because oth-
ers would be unwilling to interact with narcissists whose
anger would appear to happen for no good reason.
Consequently, others would be unwilling to interact with
narcissists.
Gender is also an understudied area in the narcissism­
anger link, although some previous research suggested the
importance of taking gender differences into consideration.
According to the American Psychiatric Association (2013),
up to 75% of those diagnosed with narcissistic personality
disorder are men. The literature on narcissism indicates that
men tend to show more narcissistic characteristics than
women as ways to control the situation, dominate others, and
exhibit their excellence (Carroll, 1987; Philipson, 1985;
Richman & Flaherty, 1990), which are congruent with tradi-
tional male gender roles. Also, narcissists' affective states
about a task depended on participants' gender in relative
evaluation situations (Morf, Weir, & Davidov, 2000). Morf
et al. (2000) found that male narcissists experienced more
enjoyment and positive emotions in the conditions where
performance evaluation was implied, but this pattern was not
found among female narcissists, using a college student sam-
ple scoring in the top and bottom third score range on the
Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI; Raskin & Hall,
1979, 1981).
Few studies examined gender differences regarding nar-
cissism and anger, which is of interest to us. For example,
Hibino, Yukawa, Kodama, and Yoshida (2005) examined
narcissism as one of the possible variables involving anger
expression in a Japanese junior high school student sample.
In a class period, participants voluntarily answered a retro-
spective questionnaire on an anger-triggering event. They
found that a narcissistic characteristic (excessive need for
admiration) took different paths to aggressive behavior by
gender. For boys, the link was straightforward; excessive
need for admiration led to anger, which motivated them to
engage in aggressive behavior (e.g., revenge on the person
who caused the event, complaint about the event to others,
and displacement of anger toward objects). However, girls'
excessive need for admiration led to a cognitive process
that emphasized their victimhood, which motivated them to
act aggressively. That is, unlike boys, girls tended to over-
estimate the seriousness of an anger-triggering event; they
perceived being treated poorly, resulting in aggressive
behavior.
In addition, Barry et al. (2006) found a strong positive
relationship between narcissism and expressed aggression,
with men showing this trend more strongly than women in a
Matsuo and DeSouza 3
college student sample. Similarly, Thomaes, Stegge, Olthof,
Bushman, and Nezlek (2011) found that male, but not female,
narcissists expressed anger when humiliated in Study 2.
Thus, men and women express anger differently.
Concerning violence (i.e., a more serious form of express-
ing aggression) in heterosexual dating relationships, Ryan,
Weikel, and Sprechini (2008) found that significant relation-
ships between college students' scores on physical assault/
sexual coercion and three subcategories of narcissism (i.e.,
overt narcissism, covert narcissism, and sexual narcissism)
depended on gender; only men showed significant correla-
tions between covert narcissism and physical assault and
between sexual narcissism and sexual coercion.
Considering that narcissists desire to participate in com-
petition and expected to win, the investigation of narcissists'
psychological states about such competition is also of inter-
est to us. Some previous work found that narcissism is related
to positive psychological states (e.g., enjoyment) and nega-
tive ones (e.g., fear) simultaneously (Rose, 2002; see also
Wink, 1991). Narcissists think positively about their own
performance (albeit unrealistically). However, they are also
nervous about their performance and damaging their self-
image, which causes them to be vulnerable to threat. These
conflicting psychological states should be observed when
asked about the task they have engaged in. It is possible that
they feel negative about the task itself (that brought unfavor-
able feedback) because the task is the source of their frustra-
tion. Their negative internal states would be a contributor to
support narcissists' "fear of failure."
The Current Study
We experimentally tested the narcissistic paradox of "fear of
failure." Along with anger and gender, we also examined
enjoyment, interest, and boredom. We argue that anticipation
of negative feedback from others activates narcissists'
ambivalent attitudes (i.e., activating both their participation
in a task and their reluctance to engage in it due to fear of
failure). Narcissists are not intrinsically motivated to engage
in the task (cf. Morf et al., 2000); therefore, they would not
enjoy it.
Likewise, because they cannot accept anything that casts
doubt on their superiority, they would not find the task inter-
esting when evaluation is announced beforehand. Then, in
the case of anticipated outcomes, to protect their self-esteem,
we expect narcissists to view the task as unenjoyable.
Based on the extant literature and the rationale above, we
propose the following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: College students who score high on narcis-
sistic tendencies will respond to anticipated negative
feedback with more anger than college students who score
low on narcissistic tendencies,
Hypothesis 2: Those who score high on narcissistic ten-
dencies will also respond to actual negative feedback with
more anger than those who score low on narcissistic
tendencies,
Hypothesis 3: Male narcissists will show the above pat-
terns more strongly than female narcissists, and
Hypothesis 4: Narcissists will enjoy the assigned task
less (i.e., show less interest and more boredom) than non-
narcissists when they anticipate being evaluated.
Method
Participants
The sample consisted of 237 (n = 143 or 60% women) under-
graduates enrolled in general education classes at a large
U.S. Midwestern public university with a mean age of 19.36
years (SD = 1.76). The majority of participants self-reported
to be White (n = 181, 76.4%). Participation was voluntary.
There was no financial compensation given, but students
were offered the opportunity to earn extra credit points for
their participation.
Measures and Task
NPI.Originally constructed as a 54-item scale aiming at
measuring one's narcissistic tendency, the NPI is composed
of sentences that are answered in a "yes" (coded 1) and "no"
(coded 0) format. Responses are summed to create a narcis-
sistic tendency score. Higher scores indicate higher levels of
narcissism. A sample item includes, "I have a natural talent
for influencing people" (Raskin & Hall, 1979, 1981). Unlike
instruments that are designed to measure pathological narcis-
sism, the NPI identifies individual differences in narcissistic
tendencies in a nonclinical population (cf. Emmons, 1984;
Raskin & Terry, 1988). Raskin and Hall (1981) reported a
strong correlation between the 40-item NPI with its 54-item
version (r = .98). del Rosario and White (2005) reported a
Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .80 with a sample of college
students for the 40-item NPI. We used the 40-item short ver-
sion of the NPI in the current study, which had a Cronbach's
alpha of .76.
State-Trait Anger Expression Inventory (STAXI).We used the
10-item State Anger subscale (Spielberger, 1988). Each item
is rated on a Likert-type scale, ranging from 1 (not at all/
almost never) to 4 (very much/almost always). Responses are
summed, with higher scores indicating higher levels of anger.
A sample item includes, "I feel like hitting something."
Using a college sample, Fuqua et al. (1991) reported an alpha
of .91 for the State Anger subscale. In our study, the Cron-
bach's alpha coefficient for the STAXI was .88.
Creativity test. The "Lange-Elliot Creativity Test" asks partici-
pants to come up with as many uses as possible for a brick
(Part 1) and a candle (Part 2), and each of the two task lasts
about 5 min (Sedikides, Campbell, Reeder, & Elliot, 1998). In

the current study, we only used Part 1 (i.e., uses of a brick) for
the sake of time. In the feedback-anticipating conditions, there
was a clear statement regarding feedback. Although partici-
pants were led to believe that this creativity test was an estab-
lished measure of one's creativity level, this bogus test served
as an unfamiliar task without practice, which was new to every-
one and seemed rather difficult (i.e., threat for narcissists).
Impressions of the task.Based on Sedikides et al.'s (1998)
study, we asked participants three questions about their
impressions of the task: (a) How much they enjoyed the cre-
ativity task, (b) how interesting it was, and (c) how boring it
was. They rated each question on a 4-point, Likert-type scale
that ranged from 1 (not at all/almost never) to 4 (very much/
almost always). We summed their scores (the boring item
was reverse-scored), creating a total enjoyment index score
that ranged from 3 to 12 ( = .79).
Experimental Manipulations
There were four experimental conditions: feedback-anticipation/
negative feedback given, feedback anticipation/no negative
feedback given, no anticipation/negative feedback given, and
no anticipation/no negative feedback given. In all conditions
and before the creativity task began, participants were informed
that the experimenter had already obtained reliable norms con-
cerning the task at 130 students from the same university and
had found a strong relationship between high scores on the task
and high IQ level (i.e., intelligent students did well on the task).
This cover story was intended to give participants a good
opportunity to show evidence of their intellectual ability and
also to stimulate their competitive motivation. The experi-
menter added that they were now collecting more data.
In the feedback-anticipating condition, at the time the
directions of the task was given (i.e., before the task), partici-
pants were told that they would receive the evaluation of
their performance after the task in the form of percentile
rank. The instructions for the no-anticipation condition did
not include any possibility of feedback.
Concerning actual feedback, after the creativity task, par-
ticipants in the no-negative feedback condition received
nothing, whereas participants in the negative feedback con-
dition received a bogus performance evaluation sheet, which
indicated that they performed poorly on the task and clearly
showing that their score was on the 31st percentile (signifi-
cantly below the norm). The experimenter also verbally told
them that they did poorly on the task.
Procedure
All participants in each session (one to two same-sex stu-
dents) were randomly assigned to one of the four conditions.
The participants signed the consent form and completed the
demographic questionnaire and the NPI in the same room.
After that, we took each participant to a separate room
where he or she worked individually on the creativity task
with the manipulations described earlier. Next, participants
responded to the 10-item State Anger subscale that was
embedded randomly with other items that asked about
enjoyment, interest, and boredom about the creativity task
(cf. Sedikides et al., 1998).
On completion, all participants were thoroughly debriefed,
emphasizing that the feedback sheet was created to make the
performance appear negative, and performance was not actu-
ally evaluated. They were told that the experimenters would
examine participants'reactions to the task after some were led
to believe that they had performed poorly. Also, participants
were told that the task they performed was not a legitimate test
of creativity and that confidentiality would be kept at all times.
Results
Six participants were excluded from the data analysis because
three were suspicious about the true purpose of this study,
two did not follow the directions on the creativity task, and
one had a session that was seriously interrupted by another
participant who arrived late, reducing the data set from 237
to 231. Of these, 57 participants were assigned to the antici-
pation/no-negative feedback condition, 59 to the anticipa-
tion/negative feedback condition, 58 to the no anticipation/
no-negative feedback condition, and 57 were to the no antici-
pation/negative feedback condition. Table 1 shows the means
and standard deviations for the total rating scores by gender.
Three multiple regression analyses were performed after
centering, with each condition of anticipation/no anticipa-
tion, negative feedback/no negative feedback, and man/
woman dummy coded. We conducted separate analyses
focusing on negative feedback and anticipation because such
investigation would show the clearest effects. Concerning
the first analysis, the top half of Table 2 shows significant
main effects of the total NPI score and negative feedback.
The interaction of negative feedback and the total NPI score
was also significant; the interaction of negative feedback
with gender was not significant; last, three-way interaction
Matsuo and DeSouza 5
was not significant. A simple slope test revealed that non-
narcissists experienced significantly greater anger when neg-
ative feedback was given than when the feedback was not
presented, but no difference was observed for narcissist
about the level of anger between no-negative feedback con-
dition and actual-negative feedback condition. For the antici-
pation condition (see bottom half of Table 2), we did not find
any significant main effects, two-way interactions, or three-
way interaction on the total anger score.
These results supported Hypothesis 2, with narcissists
having higher anger scores than non-narcissists in the actual-
negative feedback condition. However, Hypothesis 1 (antici-
pation of negative feedback) and Hypothesis 3 (gender
differences) were not supported.
Finally, we ran a separate multiple regression analysis
(after centering) with the total NPI score anticipation, and
their interaction as predictors and the total enjoyment score
as criterion variable. Table 3 shows that the interaction of the
total NPI score and anticipation was statistically significant,
supporting Hypothesis 4. That is, high NPI scorers reported
feeling less enjoyment in the task when they were informed
that they would be given feedback (anticipation condition)
than low NPI scorers. However, this pattern was not present
in the case of the no-anticipation condition.
A series of post hoc power analyses were conducted using
the software package, G*Power (Faul, Erdfelder, Lang, &
Buchner, 2007). Along with our sample size of 231, we
found the observed power for the effects of the first analysis
about negative feedback, the second about anticipation, and
the third about enjoyment were .97, above .99, and above
.93, respectively.
Discussion
We found that narcissists'anger was provoked by actual neg-
ative feedback about their performance on the creativity task,
which is in keeping with previous studies (e.g., Barry et al.,
2006; Baumeister et al., 1996; Stucke & Sporer, 2002). We
did not find support for the anticipation of feedback hypoth-
esis. We speculate that having told all participants that the
creativity task was valid and was related to intelligence may
have prompted some anticipation of evaluation or judgment
in all four conditions; in addition, presumably the experi-
menter would know the "results" of the creativity task for
each participant regardless of feedback given. Future studies
should ask participants how much they anticipated feedback
and how negative the feedback was to them to ensure that
such manipulations are indeed relevant to our participants.
It is also feasible that our fear of failure model may need
to be modified, as third variable(s) may be acting as media-
tors or moderators, affecting the narcissism­anger relation-
ship. For example, Stucke and Sporer (2002) indicated that
self-concept clarity is an important factor in considering pos-
sible interactions between narcissism and performance feed-
back on anger expression.
Our study still contributes to the literature because it
revealed that anticipation of being evaluated affected partici-
pants' reactions to the task, suggesting that narcissist-prone
individuals were sensitive to the situation and showed their
psychological states differently from non-narcissist-prone
individuals. It is noteworthy that anticipation of evaluation
prevented narcissist-prone individuals from enjoying the cre-
ativity task. We speculate that this pattern reflects narcissists'
inner ambivalence between active participation in a competi-
tive situation to validate their greatness and reluctance to
engage in an unfamiliar task that might cause failure. When
narcissists feel bored about a task and do not enjoy it, they
may be actually reluctant to engage in it because they do not
want to experience unwanted outcomes (i.e., fear of failure).
However, they need to get involved in the competitive situa-
tion anyway because of their desire to obtain admiration from
others. As discussed earlier, narcissism features competitive
motivation and need for admiration. These two characteristics
could result from their tendency to participate actively, which
is one aspect of narcissism. Furthermore, narcissists want to
be in the public eye and involve themselves in competitive

situations with others because these situations offer opportu-
nities to boast of their greatness and superiority over others.
We cast light on the "paradox of narcissism" theory devel-
oped by Elliot and Thrash (2001) and empirically tested it for
the first time. No current theory predicts our findings on
anticipation of negative feedback, but our attempt was at
least a good starting point to examine unexplored areas of
narcissism. That is, our findings captured narcissists'impres-
sion of a task before, not after, receiving feedback about the
task. As the previous research (e.g., Morf et al., 2000;
Rhodewalt & Morf, 1998) focused on the psychological
states caused by performance feedback (i.e., after feedback),
the current study did cast light on a possible cognitive pro-
cess when narcissists are waiting for feedback.
Narcissists are often described as having such confidence
about their competency that they eagerly participate in com-
petitive situations (cf. Morf et al., 2000). Yet, the current find-
ings suggest that they do not enjoy these situations because of
upcoming feedback. Together with the psychological unsta-
bleness of narcissists' self-esteem, their inner ambivalence
between the undesirable self (possibly performing poorly)
and their desire to do better than others emerge when they
anticipate evaluation. Narcissists'derogation of the task could
be a manifestation of their ambivalence between taking
advantage of competitions (approach) and avoiding such
opportunities for the purpose of protecting their self-esteem.
We recommend that future studies examine the "paradox
of narcissism" by experimentally manipulating approach
(e.g., desire to show off one's abilities) and avoidance (e.g.,
fear of anticipating/receiving negative feedback) conditions
separately, and possibly showing their simultaneous activa-
tion. It might also be helpful to test whether the effect of
feedback anticipation on anger by manipulating how many
people would know the results of the creativity task (e.g., just
the experimenter, as was the case in the current study, vs.
many individuals, such as other research participants or con-
federates) and to include self-concept clarity (Stucke &
Sporer, 2002) as a possible mediator/moderator.
Although the current study did not find evidence of sig-
nificant gender differences concerning the narcissism­anger
link, future research should continue to examine the disposi-
tional aspect of narcissism by gender. According to Morf and
Rhodewalt (2001), it is possible that narcissists try to achieve
their goals in different and unique ways suitable to their gen-
der roles. In the United States, hegemonic masculinity rein-
forces success, power, and competition, which have been
linked to aggression and violence (Crowther, Goodson,
McGuire, & Dickson, 2013), whereas "emphasized feminin-
ity" reinforces feminine submissiveness (DeSouza, 2013).
Following such gender roles, narcissistic characteristic(s) and
expressiveness of anger may be different for women and men
(Ryan et al., 2008), especially in Latin countries where
machismo and marianismo (emphasized femininity) seem to
be even stronger than in NorthAmerica (Baldwin & DeSouza,
2001). Thus, gender differences may be pronounced in more
traditional cultures than in more egalitarian cultures such as
in Scandinavia. We recommend a cross-cultural investigation
to test for gender differences in the narcissism­anger link.
Conclusion
Our study provided theoretical insights into personality psy-
chological science by identifying variables in narcissism that
were affected by anticipation of negative feedback. Narcissists
are situation-sensitive; their unexpected anger and reactions
(witnessed by other people) are likely to have negative effects
on their engagement in tasks, actual achievement, and inter-
personal relationships. Narcissists' sensitivity to their social
worlds (i.e., reactions about their performance from others)
originally comes from the paradoxical concept they bear--
they want to be superior to others, but they are worried about
possible negative feedback. Their self-evaluation derives not
from themselves, but from their environment, which results in
high/unstable self-esteem. As Morf and Rhodewalt (2001)
discussed, narcissism should be viewed as a self-regulatory
processing system with paradoxical features.
Future research on narcissism should be interwoven with
other self-related concepts and attitudes toward the external
world in cognitive processes working for establishing narcis-
sists'self-understanding and their interpersonal relationships
to better understand the complicated mechanisms of narcis-
sism and its dynamism.
