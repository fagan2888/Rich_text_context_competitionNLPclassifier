Pesticide exposure may differentially impact young children; they live closer to the ground and take in greater amounts of food relative to body mass than older
children or adults. We are using an organophosphate (OP) urinary biomarker screen (gas chromatography with flame photometric detection, GC/FPD) to
evaluate pesticide exposure among 154 children 6 years of age living in a heavily farmed border (US±Mexico) community. The screen detects
diethylphosphates (DEPs) and dimethylphosphates (DMPs) above a reference range of 1000 non-occupationally exposed individuals (DL=25 g/g
creatinine, Cr). At least one metabolite was detected for 33% of the subjects; many samples contained multiple biomarkers. DEP was detected in 5% of the
subjects. DMP and DMTP were frequently measured (25% and 26%, respectively). Biomarker concentrations are adjusted by the body's metabolism of Cr as
an indicator of urine dilution. Cr concentrations were examined separately to evaluate their effect on internal dose measures. Cr concentrations were
significantly different by season (K±W=0.83, P=0.022). Significant differences exist between the autumn:spring (P=0.038) Cr concentrations and
between summer:autumn (P=0.041) Cr concentrations based on Mann±Whitney U=1070.5, z= À2.041, (P=0.041). Our analysis of NHANES III data did
not reflect seasonal Cr differences for 6 year olds. No younger children were included. Absorbed daily dose (ADD) estimates were calculated for children with
the highest concentrations of metabolite. Calculations are theoretical values assuming that the entirety of a given metabolite was metabolized from a single
pesticide. Several class-appropriate pesticides were evaluated. For the children with the highest levels, almost all estimated ADDs exceeded the RfD. Although
the actual metabolite concentrations dropped appreciably, ADD were still exceeded RfDs at the 95th percentile. The urinary OP screen was effective in
identifying subjects with atypical internal doses. Daily Cr yield is a critical component in ADD calculations. Cr variability produces differences in internal dose
measurement and estimates of ADD independent of exposure. Cr variability among young children needs to be examined, and caution should be applied when
evaluating Cr adjusted internal doses for children. Journal of Exposure Analysis and Environmental Epidemiology (2000) 10, 672±681.

Introduction
Residents in agricultural communities, like Yuma County,
AZ, have great awareness of pesticide exposure risks. Aerial
application and real fear of pesticide drift enhance concerns
of accidental pesticide exposure. In Yuma County, agricul-
ture is a year-round activity. The greatest amount of
pesticide is applied during the month of August when insect
pests are the most numerous (Merrigan and Baker, 1995).
For community members uninvolved with agriculture, late
summer may be the season of greatest exposure risk. Worker
exposure, excluding pesticide mixers and handlers, is
limited during the summer because most of the fieldworks
are mechanized. Excluding the risk of aerial drift, the
greatest potential for human contact with pesticide occurs
during the late fall and winter months when crops are tended
by seasonal and migrant laborers.
Agricultural worker residents receive job-related pes-
ticide safety training. The Worker Protection Standard of
1992 (40 CRF Part 170) addresses worker exposure to
pesticides used in farming, forestry, and nursery or
greenhouse operations (EPA, 1994). The standard
requires employers to prevent and mitigate exposure of
agricultural workers to pesticides. Provisions require
notification of application, safety training of the workers
and handlers, availability of decontamination facilities,
transportation to medical treatment, and provision of
medical treatment for workers accidentally exposed.
Training programs focus on issues related to worker
safety. Some information address transfer of pesticide
from the field to the home environment (e.g., separate
laundering of field clothes). ``Paraoccupational'' or
secondary exposure to family members living in or near
the fields remains largely unevaluated (NIOSH, 1995;

Fenske, 1997), but initial evaluation shows evidence of
these exposures (Simcox et al., 1995; Loewenherz et al.,
1997).
Organophosphate (OP) pesticides are used widely in the
fields against agricultural pests (methyl parathion, oxyde-
meton methyl) and in homes to combat termites and
roaches (chlorpyrifos, diazinon). Exposure can occur
through all routes, and children are particularly vulnerable.
Children are not small adults; they have a high body surface
to body volume ratio resulting in greater inhalation,
ingestion, and dermal absorption than adults. Further, rates
of body processes like excretion and metabolism are greater.
These rates vary by developmental stage and among
individuals within a given stage (Bearer, 1995). Behaviors
of children (e.g., mouthing surfaces and crawling) further
promote exposure (Zartarian et al., 1995, 1997; Reed et al.,
1999). Collectively, these differences leave children more
susceptible to exposures (Goldman, 1995). Proximity to
source places children of farm workers at a greater risk for
routine exposure (Fenske, 1997). Demonstrating these
principles with field data, recent studies by Loewenherz et
al. (1997) and Azaroff (1999) report detectable urinary
metabolites (dialkylphosphates) among children living in
agricultural regions.
Urinary biomarkers can be reported as concentration/unit
volume or as concentrations relative to a urine concentration.
Many factors influence daily urinary output both within and
between individuals. For instance, water, urea, salt, specific
gravity, and osmolality will increase or decrease depending
on the amount of water consumed. Using a volumetric
approach, toxicants or metabolites reported as units per liter
of urine can vary independent of exposure (Elkins et al.,
1974). Another approach employs a metabolic ``by-
product'' generated by the human body, then the amount of
metabolite (e.g., a dialkylphosphate) is expressed in
relationship to the amount of ``by-product'' produced by
the body (e.g., creatinine, Cr). The assumption is that both
the metabolized toxicant and the metabolic by-product are
responding to the same processes. Cr is a metabolite
produced constantly in the body through the metabolism of
tissue and protoplasmic molecules (i.e., creatine and
phosphocreatine in muscle). Cr has little day-to-day and
interindividual variability among healthy, working, aged
adults. Urine samples from the elderly frequently show a
decline in urinary Cr. Work evaluating glomerular filtration
rates suggests that the decline is caused by insufficient
dietary protein consumption andwhen values are adjusted for
diet, no Cr excretion decline is found (Kimmel et al., 1996).
The stability of Cr production and excretion among young
children is assumed to be the same as for adults.
This paper reports initial results of Cr adjusted urinary
metabolite frequency using an OP screen. We focused on
children living in small agricultural communities south of
Yuma, AZ; they were between the ages of 2 and 6 years and
potty-trained. In the process of evaluating results, we
examined factors affecting urinary Cr concentrations and
the influence of Cr concentrations on ``exposure'' as
measured by the biomarkers. Since the dialkylphosphates
represent aggregate exposure across multiple pesticides
within a class, calculations of ``theoretical'' absorbed daily
dose(s) (ADDs) are presented to explore the meaning of
``high'' laboratory results as they relate to locally used OP
pesticides.
Methods
Study Area and Population Recruitment
Seven Yuma County census tracts (1990) were selected for
the National Human Exposure Assessment Survey
(NHEXAS) and the Arizona Border Survey (ABS) using
a population proportional to size study design (Robertson et
al., 1999). We designed the Children's Exposure to Pesticide
Survey (CPS) to be performed in the same area. This
enabled us to build CPS on a base of previously collected
data. The community of interest extends from the south side
of the city of Yuma to the United States border with Mexico.
The community includes homes in unincorporated areas and
the villages of Somerton, Gadsden, and San Luis, AZ (Figure
1). According to the 1990 census, this fastgrowing
agricultural community was over 65% Hispanic.
Study subjects were recruited in two ways. (1) NHEXAS
and ABS used a population-based probability design; 111
households were contacted in Yuma County. Of these, 11
families with children 6 years in age were enrolled in the
NHEXAS and ABS. Through strict adherence to the study
design, these families were not selected for NHEXAS or
ABS environmental sampling (stage II or III). We
recontacted these families and enrolled seven of them in
the CPS. These families and families with eligible children
sampled in NHEXAS and ABS provide a population base for
bootstrap modeling. (2) We enrolled 143 additional families
meeting study criteria by focusing on services catering to
children with the desired characteristics (2± 6 years and
possessing bladder control). Participants were enrolled
through Head Start, Migrant Head Start, and Women,
Infants, and Children (WIC) programs located in San Luis
and Somerton, AZ, by ``promotoras'' from the Western
Arizona Area Health Education Center (WAHEC). Using
both methods, a total of 150 families wereenrolled. Ten of the
children celebrated birthdays prior to stage II sampling (see
below). By the conclusion of the study, we sampled 140
homes with 154 children meeting the enrollment criteria to
participate in the CPS.
Study Design
Our study of children's pesticide exposure in Yuma County
involves five stages. This report will evaluate results from
Pesticide exposure and creatinine in young children O'Rourke et al.

the first two stages. Stage I Ð Enrollment. All families
were administered a descriptive questionnaire to determine
the characteristics of the participant population. Questions
addressed household location, characteristics, and demo-
graphic information for each household resident. Stage II
Ð Screening. This stage required two visits to each enrolled
household. Interviews included a baseline questionnaire
related to subject exposure, a 1-day record of typical
activities and their duration, and a 1-day record of all food
and beverages consumed. The interview was conducted in
the language (Spanish or English) selected by the subject's
parent/guardian. A first morning urine sample and a
household dust sample were collected. The remaining three
stages (intensive sampling, subject education, and commu-
nity education) are just concluding and will be reported
later.
Stage II Sampling, Handling, and Processing
Parents of all participating children were provided with a
urine cup and basic written and verbal instructions on
sample collection; they were asked to collect the first urine
void of the day for participating children. Parents were
instructed to place all samples in their freezer until the field
team returned to retrieve the sample (usually the same day
of the urine sample collection). Each urine sample was
labeled with the child's study identification number. Frozen
urine samples were shipped to Tucson with cold packs by an
overnight express service. Once received, samples were
logged and held in a À208C freezer. Samples were held and
shipped in batches of 20 samples to Pacific Toxicology
Laboratories on dry ice for dialkylphosphate metabolites
analysis, with a detection limit of 25 g/l. Residual aliquots
were archived at À188C by Pacific Toxicology Labora-
tories. Freezing does not appear to affect metabolite
concentrations (Ito et al., 1979). Urinary metabolites were
evaluated and results were returned as raw values (g/l)
and Cr adjusted values (g/g). Cr values were also
reported separately in grams of Cr per liter of urine.
Cautions regarding measurement validity were reported if
urinary Cr levels were <0.5 or >3.0 g/l. Dust samples were
collected, processed, and screened for pesticides. Those
results will not be discussed in this paper.
Urine Sample Analysis A minimum of 25 ml of urine was
placed in test tubes for sample analysis. The urine was
freeze-dried and derivatized using benzyltolyltriazine
reagent (Daughton et al., 1979; Takade et al., 1979). A
saturated salt solution was added to the tubes and the benzyl
derivatives were extracted using cyclohexane and analyzed
by gas chromatography with flame photometric detection
(GC/FPD) (Shafik and Enos, 1969; Lores and Bradway,
1977).
Laboratory Quality Assurance Procedures Calibration
standards were prepared from pooled blank urine collected
from laboratory personnel. Aliquots of urine were fortified
on the first day of sample preparation from spiking solutions
prepared from analytical grade salts of the dialkylpho-
sphates. All standards were extracted and derivatized in the
same manner as patient samples and expired after 12
months.
Controls were prepared by fortifying pooled blank urine
(collected from laboratory personnel) with spiking solution
using analytical grade material of a different lot than that
used to prepare the calibration standard spiking material.
After spiking, the urine was aliquoted (2 ml) in separate
screw cap test tubes and frozen until use. Controls were
prepared at two levels. The low control was prepared at the
limit of detection. The high control was prepared at 40Â the
low control.
One low control and one high control were extracted and
analyzed with each batch of subject samples. The ``control''
recoveries were compared to a ``QC range'' set by
evaluating 10±20 consecutive samples, determining the
mean and standard deviation of those samples, and

establishing a QC range at 2 SD of the mean. An
acceptable mean was considered anything between 70% and
120% of the amount fortified. Results were only valid when
the controls were within the QC range. Control samples are
tracked across all batches run at the laboratory and
evaluated for systematic trends and errors using the
Westgard Rules.
Data Management and Analysis
All questionnaires used for this project were produced in
Teleform and were scanned into SPSS2 portable databases
(O'Rourke et al., 1999). Samples were labeled with
barcodes and logged in into a computerized system. The
results of the urinary dialkylphosphate metabolites were
provided in paper and electronic formats. Data were hand-
entered twice, compared, and errors corrected. The final
database was 100% visually verified against the original
laboratory reports.
Calculations
Data analysis was performed using SPSS2 version 9.0 for
Windows.2 Exploratory values of ADD were calculated
using the formula:
ADD  g biomarker=g Cr
  Â g Cr excreted=day
 
Â compound wt=metabolite wt
 
Â % cleared
 =childHs body weight in kg
Empirical data available for the analysis included the
biomarker concentration per gram of Cr, the compound
(specific pesticide) and metabolite (DEP, DMP, DMTP)
weights, the child's age and body weight as reported by the
parent. To determine the grams of Cr excreted in a day, we
took the product of the Cr yield of the analyzed urine
sample (g/l) and the age adjusted daily urinary excretion
rate as reported by Snyder et al. (1975). We assume no
gender differences in excretion rates for children 6 years
(Snyder et al., 1975) and 100% clearance.
Results
Demographics
Of the 140 households with stage II sampling, two children
under the age of 6 years were recruited in 14 homes for a
total of 154 subjects under the age of 6. The study design
also called for evaluation of some older sibling for
comparison; 38 older children were recruited. Forty-six
percent of the population was recruited from San Luis, AZ,
a town on the US±Mexico border; 49% of the population
was recruited from Somerton, AZ, a town $8 km northeast
of San Luis. The remaining 5% was from Gadsden and
Yuma (city). These are the mailing addresses. Many of
these homes are in non-urbanized settings proximal to these
small towns.
All children were Hispanic and most households were
bilingual. Families were asked their preferred language.
Subsequent contacts were made in that language, including
reports of study results. Only 3% of the families preferred to
be interviewed in English. Spanish was the preferred
language for questionnaire completion in 97% of the homes
surveyed. About two thirds of the families spoke both
languages to some extent. Fifty-one percent of the children
was comprised of male and 49% female. The majority of the
children 6 years of age were 5 years of age (47%) with
near equal representation of 3 and 4 year olds (21% and
25%, respectively). Each age group had about the same
gender split.
Cr Concentrations and Sample Validity
We collected 196 urine samples from children of all ages;
four samples were lost to breakage during shipment. One
hundred fifty-four samples were evaluated from children
6 years Ð the focus of this study. The mean Cr value for
all 154 samples was 0.90 g/l (SD=0.11). Table 1 presents
the distribution of urine samples for each Cr class (g/l). We
considered the effects of a child's age and urinary output as
potential variables (Snyder et al., 1975) and adjusted the
grams per liter Cr measures (Table 1) to reflect daily
excretion of Cr (g/day). Figure 2 illustrates the paired Cr
concentration lines (g/l and g/day). The grams per liter
values were sorted in ascending order and the case numbers
were fixed. The corresponding values in grams per day were
adjusted using urinary output constants by subject age. The
trends of the two lines are similar. [The highest Cr value
(7.5 g/l or 4.5 g/day) was excluded from Figure 2 for
purposes of scaling.]
The analytical laboratory warned that metabolite results
were questionable for samples with Cr less than 0.5 or
greater than 3.0 g/l. Thirty-two of these samples were so
designated by the laboratory. By most standards, the Cr
levels appeared low, especially since the samples were
represented as first morning voids (g/l). Of the 121
``valid'' samples, the mean Cr level was 1.05 g/l
(SD=0.68). Of the 32 samples with low Cr yield, the
mean Cr level was 0.33 g/l (SD=0.11).

To determine whether the 32 samples with low Cr (g/l)
were first morning voids, we contacted the parents and
asked questions regarding the sampling time frame and the
parent's recollection of the child's toilet habits. Results are
presented in Table 2. Only one parent admitted to having no
recollection of the sampling time frame. None of the
children wore diapers to bed routinely. Sixteen percent of
the parents reported that their child usually wet the bed;
parents confirmed one bedwetting event and two other
parents considered bedwetting a possibility. Half of the
parents believed that the child may have used the toilet
during the night without the parent's knowledge. If we
assume that half of the children with unknown nighttime
toilet use actually urinated, then about three quarters of the
children with low Cr yield probably conformed to the
protocol. Some other factors must account for the variable
Cr yield in these children.
Next, we considered whether Cr content of urine varied
seasonally as found by Freeman et al. (1995). The
maximum daily temperature in Yuma County varies
between warm and hot. We divided the year into two
seasons: April 15±October 15 (hot) and October 16
through April 14 (warm). No difference was seen in
urinary Cr levels during these seasons (0.90 g/l with an n of
104 and 0.91 g/l with an n of 48, respectively). When
results were divided into locally relevant seasons, the
observed Cr concentrations were significantly different by
season (K±W median test: median=0.83, 2 =9.613, df=3,
P=0.022). Significant differences exist between the autumn
and spring Cr concentrations (Mann±Whitney U=469;
z= À2.04, P=0.038); another significant difference was
found between summer and autumn Cr concentrations
(Mann±Whitney U=1070.5, z= À2.041, P=0.041). No
other differences among seasonal Cr values were signifi-
cant. Table 3 presents the seasonal values by both grams per
liter and grams per day of Cr in first morning voids across all
age groups. The seasonal distribution of 121 valid samples
(excluding those with Cr <0.5 g/l) shows the same, albeit
less pronounced, trend.
For further comparison, we examined the Cr results for
6 year olds from the NHANES III survey (DHHS, 1996).
The range of Cr difference was under 0.1 g/l across all
seasons and there was no statistically significant seasonal
variability (P=0.05). The NHANES III Cr data presented
other interesting opportunities. By race, Cr values are
significantly greater for African±Americans (mean=0.94
g Cr/l urine; n=173) than whites (mean=0.78 g Cr/l
urine; n=285) with a Mann±Whitney U=19,241
(z= À3.94; P=0.0000). Between ethnic groups, non-
Hispanics had significantly greater Cr concentrations
(mean=0.89 g Cr/l urine; n=287) than Hispanics
(mean=0.77 g Cr/l urine; n=190) with a Mann±Whitney
U=23,102.5 (z= À2.85; P=0.005). These results for 6-

year-old children suggest that Cr variability needs to be
considered not only in terms of age, but also in terms of
race and ethnicity.
Urinary Metabolites Indicative of Pesticide Exposure
The dialkylphosphates were measured in the urine of 121
children 6 years or younger who were able to urinate
into the specimen cup and whose Cr yield was sufficient
for laboratory analysis. Overall, at least one metabolite
was detected for 33% of the subjects. Many samples
contained multiple biomarkers. Only 5% of the subjects
produced any of the diethylphosphates (DEPs). None of
the other DEPs [diethylphosphorothioate (DETP) or
diethylphosphorodithioate (DEDTP) ] was reported from
the urine samples. Most of the detectable measures were
from the dimethylphosphates (DMPs). DMP and DMTP
(dimethylphosphorothioate) were frequently reported
(25% and 26%, respectively). DMDTP (dimethylpho-
sphorodithioate) was found in only 3% of the samples.
Hayes et al. (1980) indicate that DMTP had the greatest
recovery among the dialkylphosphates. Thus, in most
studies, DMTP appears most commonly. These values
and results from other comparable studies are presented
in Table 4. DMTP was the most frequently detected
metabolite by Azaroff (1999) and Loewenherz et al.
(1997). The highest concentrations of dialkylphosphates
were reported among citrus growers by Griffith and
Duncan (1985); results were compared with those of
NHANES II.
Table 4 contains the percent of dialkylphosphate
concentrations elevated beyond the reference range of
the specific analyte (DEP, DMP, DMTP). The laboratory
defined the reference range as the level experienced by
the 95th percentile individual in a survey of 1000 non-
occupationally exposed individuals for that analyte. Since
detection was unexpected among non-occupationally
exposed individuals, the reference range is defined as
zero at the limit of detection for the method (25 ppb).
Therefore, anything above 25 ppb was considered above
the reference range and is a detect. Viewing all detectable
levels as ``high'' only serves to describe result levels
relative to other individuals Ð a typical method used in
clinical analyses. Detection does not imply any toxicolo-
gical impact or risk. The non-specificity of the results
limits the utility of the test; there are no published levels
of OP residues associated with any kind of toxicological
effect.
ADD is usually calculated for a single pesticide with a
specific metabolite. We have identified pesticides com-
monly used in the Yuma area. Metabolism of each pesticide
would result in a class of metabolite (DEP, DMP, DMTP).
Table 5 contains the ADD based on actual biomarkers
collected from this population of children. Three children
are presented for each pesticide example, and each child
excreted the greatest concentration of biomarker for his/her
age class. For these calculations, we assume that a single
pesticide was metabolized, it produced a single metabolite,
and all of the metabolites were cleared.
The measured DEP could be derived from either
chlorpyrifos or diazinon, among other pesticides not
discussed. Both pesticides are reportedly used in the
Yuma area. For the highest DEP report, the ADD
exceeds the permissible reference dose by 126 times, in
the worst case Ð diazinon. Levels of DMP and DMTP
as associated with methyl parathion exceed the reference
dose by 385 and 61 times, respectively. In most cases,
there is a considerable difference between the greatest
metabolite concentration and the (still elevated) con-
centration at the 95th percentile of the distribution. Using
the same subject parameters (i.e., g Cr/day and subject

Discussion
Evaluating pesticide exposure and health effects is a
difficult undertaking. Clearly, children face greater risks
to non-occupational pesticide exposure than adults. Pound
for pound of body weight, children eat more, breath more,
and have a faster metabolism. Behaviorally, they play on
the floor or lawn where pesticides are commonly applied
and have more frequent hand-to-mouth contacts (Zartarian
et al., 1995, 1997; Bradman et al., 1997; Eskenazi et al.,
1999; Reed et al., 1999). Based on the laboratory reference
range procedure, 5% exposure was expected. DEP
measures met expectations. DMP and DMTP exceeded
expectations by 20% and 21%, respectively.
Several factors may account for these numbers. (1)
Subjects experience paraoccupational exposure as children
of farm workers. Pesticides are used routinely near their
homes, and their parent's occupation promotes transport
of pesticides from the field to the home. (2) As children,
their behaviors and biology place them at greater risk. (3)
The reference population may not be comparable to the
study population in terms of age, activities, and
temperature regimes experienced (region of the country).
Further, results from the NHEXAS studies indicate a
gradual increase of chlorpyrifos exposure when compared
with NHANES III data. More people appear exposed to
low levels of pesticide as time progresses. If the
laboratory reference population for CPS was evaluated
more than 10 years ago, its relevance today may be
questionable.
Few studies have focused on children's exposure to
pesticides, making comparisons difficult. Guillete et al.
(1998) conducted a study in Mexico with 4±5-year-old
Yaqui children with assumed low level chronic exposure
to agricultural pesticides and compared them with children
living in a nearby community perceived as having less
pesticide use. They found that children who lived in the
agricultural area had significant deficits in tests of
stamina, eye±hand coordination, short-term memory,
and ability to draw a person when compared with the
presumably non-exposed children. There were no direct
measures of pesticide dose from the children and
environmental measures were few. The paper shows
trends, but has no evaluation, of metabolites indicating
internal dose.
Azaroff (1999) conducted a study with farm workers
from rural El Salvador. She found that nearly half of 358
samples had detectable levels of OP metabolites. Detectable
metabolite levels were found among 30% of the non-
occupationally exposed subjects. Similar rates were found

among children (any age younger that 18) and adults.
Among subjects, excretion of OP metabolites was predicted
by performing fieldwork during the past 2 weeks, having the
head of household applying OP pesticides during the past 2
years, and reporting the use of OP pesticides in the house or
yard.
Loewenherz et al. (1997) measured urinary metabolites
from two groups of children in Washington State.
Children (44%), with parents who were pesticide
applicators had urinary metabolites above the detection
level, while only 27% of the non-applicator's children had
detectable levels. The children of non-applicators also
lived in agricultural environments. The method used by
Loewenherz et al. (1997) was about twice as sensitive as
those of other studies (Table 4). The increased sensitivity
levels may influence the percentage reported. Non-
applicator children may reflect the enhanced ``back-
ground'' measures. If lower detection levels were available
to CPS, we would expect an increased percentage of the
Yuma population to respond.
When assessing a urine sample for OP concentration, it is
logical to obtain the greatest accumulation of urine over a
specified time as is possible. The first morning void meets
these needs. The investigator must rely on the child and
parent to make sure the sample is a first morning void. Age
adjusted Cr concentrations are one approach to evaluating
compliance to the protocol. We found no relationship
between low Cr levels and bedwetting or diaper-wearing.
The potential for children to use the toilet unbeknown to the
parent appeared evenly split and remains a possibility for
about 10% of the population. In addition to protocol non-
compliance, elevated Cr concentrations in first morning
voids may impede the chemical assay. Cr values exceeding
3.0 g/l were only found in one sample from the CPS. Other
studies counterelevated Cr by collecting spot urine samples.
Researchers measure Cr and rely on it being more or less
constant.
Freeman et al. (1995) found highly variable Cr levels
among children under the age of 6 years living in a Jersey
city (NJ) neighborhood near a chromium waste site.
Overall, Cr levels appeared low. Further, summer mean Cr
levels were 0.716 g/l (17 children) and autumn values
were 0.395 g/l (14 children). Our results confirm
seasonal variability in Cr concentration among young
children.
A variety of explanations abound for the seasonal trend
in these two studies. Foremost among these is limited
knowledge of norms for healthy children. Activity and
increased perspiration may play a role. Yet, CPS children
spent 8 h sleeping prior to sample collection. Some
differences might be caused by changes in household air
cooling method (air conditioning versus open windows).
Another important factor is dietary intake. Elders with
reduced dietary protein have a decline in urinary Cr
clearance (Kimmel et al., 1996). Children may have a
diet with greater seasonal variation than adults. Ethnic
differences in diet may relate to the racial and ethnic Cr
differences in the NHANES III data. Lower Cr concen-
trations yield increased adjusted biomarker measures for a
toxicant. What is the impact of these adjustments on
concepts like environmental justice if different groups of
children metabolize Cr at different rates or dietary issues
confound the Cr yield?
The classic paper by Elkins et al. (1974) clearly
demonstrates the need for some method of standardizing
toxicants in urine. Investigators carefully seek the labora-
tory with the best detection limit for the analyte of interest
along with quality assurance procedures; less thought is
provided to the Cr standard. Our evaluation of the CDC Cr
concentrations among 6 year olds in NHANES III showed a
total spread of only 0.09 g/l across all seasons. Six years of
age marks a major change for children. They enter school
for a complete day and activities change. These changes
may affect Cr yield along with racial and ethnic factors. An
alternative is the caliber of laboratory work done at CDC.
They may yield consistently better Cr measurements than
commercial laboratories.
Cr concentration is fundamental to the calculation of
internal dose and ADD. We calculated the ADD for a 4-
year-old child using daily Cr concentrations measured in
the field and using those reported by Snyder et al. (1975).
Assuming exposure to methyl parathion of 179 g/g Cr
and using the greater measures found for our population
(0.68 g/day as opposed to a reference value of 0.25 g/
day), the ADDs were 0.01687 and 0.00620 mg kgÀ1
dayÀ1. Both measures exceed the RfD; the value based on
our actual Cr measure is almost three times greater.
Laboratory errors on Cr measures may result in erroneous
conclusions regarding pesticide safety. Further, our results
and those of Freeman et al. (1995) suggest that Cr yield
may be more variable among children. NHANES IV will
evaluate children under the age of 6 years across all
seasons. Results may better characterize Cr production in
young children across a variety of temporal and spatial
regimes.
The OP screen provides interesting, although non-
specific, results. It enables investigators to evaluate a
``class'' of pesticides and not miss an important exposure by
a poor selection of specific metabolites. In our future stage
III evaluations of CPS, we can examine the relationships
between the OP screen and metabolites specific to a
pesticide.
Conclusions
In Yuma County, one or more urinary metabolites to OP
pesticides were observed in 33% of the children 6 years

of age. Paraoccupational exposure is a likely source.
Bedwetting or wearing of diapers did not appear to be a
problem in obtaining a first morning void. There may be a
seasonal variation in Cr yield in young children. Cr yield
per day is a critical component of ADD calculations.
Variability in Cr measures will produce differences in
internal dose and estimates of ADD independent of
exposure.
