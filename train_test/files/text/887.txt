Relations of income inequality and family income to
chronic medical conditions and mental health disorders:
national survey
Roland Sturm, Carole Roan Gresenz
Abstract
Objectives To analyse the relation between
geographical inequalities in income and the
prevalence of common chronic medical conditions
and mental health disorders, and to compare it with
the relation between family income and these health
problems.
Design Nationally representative household
telephone survey conducted in 1997-8.
Setting 60 metropolitan areas or economic areas of
the United States.
Participants 9585 adults who participated in the
community tracking study.
Main outcome measures Self report of 17 common
chronic medical conditions; current depressive
disorder or anxiety disorder assessed by clinical
screeners.
Results A strong continuous association was seen
between health and education or family income. No
relation was found between income inequality and the
prevalence of chronic medical problems or depressive
disorders and anxiety disorders, either across the
whole population or among poorer people. Only self
reported overall health, the measure used in previous
studies, was significantly correlated with inequality at
the population level, but this correlation disappeared
after adjustment for individual characteristics.
Conclusions This study provides no evidence for the
hypothesis that income inequality is a major risk
factor for common disorders of physical or mental
health.
Introduction
The "income inequality hypothesis" says that dispari-
ties in income among members of a community affect
their health and, specifically, that economically
egalitarian communities or societies have better health
outcomes than more unequal communities.1­3 Some
proponents argue that inequality in incomes is a
stronger determinant of health than the income of
individuals or families.1
Initial support for the income inequality hypothesis
came from aggregate level studies of total mortality or
cause specific mortality.1 4­10 More recent studies at the
level of the individual confirm the positive correlation
between inequality and self rated health or mortality at
the population level, but show mixed results once indi-
vidual characteristics are included in the analysis.11­17
Health status was usually measured by the question, "In
general, would you say that your health is excellent,
very good, good, fair, or poor?" Three studies also
measured psychological distress.15 17 18
This study re-examines the income inequality
hypothesis with measures of health that reflect the
presence or absence of 17 chronic physical conditions
and specific disorders of mental health, by using data
from a survey carried out in 1997-8 in 60 metropolitan
or economic areas across the United Sates. We discuss
how the relation between income inequality and these
physical and mental health conditions compares with
the relation between family income and health.
Methods
Sources of data
"Healthcare for Communities" is a household tele-
phone survey clustered in 60 randomly selected
metropolitan areas or economic areas of the United
States; it was carried out in 1997-8.19 The surveyors
reinterviewed a stratified random sample of 9585 par-
ticipants of the community tracking study20 and
achieved a response rate of 64%. This analysis focuses
on 8235 respondents living in the 60 sites for which
measures of income inequality are available (1337
respondents lived outside the 60 sites). We derived
weights on the basis of the inverse of the probability of
selection, non-response, and households without a
telephone. Descriptions of the study design have been
published.19 20
Outcome measures
For comparability with previous studies we analysed
the self reported general health status of respondents
and created an indicator for a response of poor or fair
(population weighted mean = 16.3%).13 14 17 Numbers
presented were calculated by using sampling weights
to provide nationally representative estimates
Our measure of mental health considered four
psychiatric disorders--major depressive disorder, dys-
thymic disorder, panic disorder, and generalised
anxiety disorder--which we assessed by using the com-
posite international diagnostic interview, short form,

plus role limitation for panic disorder.21­23 The
weighted population estimate is 13.2% for at least one
of the four disorders and 10.5% for at least one of the
two depressive disorders (major depressive disorder
and dysthymic disorder).
We assessed physical health from answers to ques-
tions about 17 chronic health conditions: asthma;
diabetes; hypertension; arthritis; a physical disability;
trouble breathing; cancer; a neurological condition;
stroke or paralysis; angina, heart failure, or coronary
artery disease; chronic back problems; stomach ulcer;
chronic liver disease; migraine or chronic severe head-
aches; chronic bladder problems; chronic gynaecologi-
cal problems (women only); and unspecified chronic
pain. We report results for the overall number of con-
ditions and for the more common individual
conditions or conditions that may have psychosocial
components. Weighted percentages are 26.9% for at
least one of three pain conditions (migraine or chronic
severe headaches, back pain, other unspecified chronic
pain); 22.7% for arthritis; 16.6% for hypertension; 8.9%
(of women) for gynaecological problems; 6.1% for
diabetes; 4.3% for angina, heart failure, or coronary
heart disease; and 3.9% for trouble breathing.
Income inequality, individual income, and other
independent variables
We calculated income inequality at site level from the
community tracking study. For the sensitivity analysis
we also used Kahn et al's state level inequality measures
based on the 1990 census17 and three of Mellor and
Milyo's16 state measures based on the current
population surveys. The results shown are based on the
Gini coefficient,24­26 which ranges from 0.38 to 0.54
across the 60 communities. This is higher than the
0.27-0.35 range found in a British mental health study,
indicating higher levels of inequality.18
Income at the individual level was measured as
family income, which includes earnings from work,
transfer income, and other sources. The survey asked
about each major component of income separately,
and respondents were asked to respond with actual
dollar amounts. Unfolding follow up brackets were
adopted to reduce item non-response--this method
allows partial information to be obtained about
missing items when respondents are unwilling to pro-
vide a more detailed answer.27 The tables classify
respondents by fifths of income on the basis of the
national distribution of income (rather than fifths of
the sample), resulting in larger low income groups
because the study oversampled poorer people.
We also used age, sex, race or ethnicity, and size
of family to adjust for confounding factors in the
statistical analyses.
Analyses
We grouped respondents by fifths of family income
and by community level inequality and calculated a
weighted mean for the prevalence of each condition in
each group. We tested the association between
prevalence of medical conditions and family income or
inequality by using individual level logistic regressions
with an indicator of a health condition as the depend-
ent variable. We tested the association both with and
without adjustment for other individual level socio-
demographic variables. P values for tests of associa-
tions given in the final two columns are based on tests
using continuously measured family income or
inequality. We also allowed for non-linear effects of
inequality on health outcomes by including dummy
variables for each fifth of inequality and with a
quadratic function of inequality, but the results were
robust to the alternative specifications and are not
reported. We weighted regressions and non-
parametrically adjusted standard errors by using the
Huber-White correction as implemented in the cluster
option in Stata 6.0 to account for the sampling design.
In the sensitivity analyses, we substituted income
adjusted for education or family size for total family
income and used state level inequality measures
instead of site level inequality. The figures are based on
regression models with sociodemographic variables
and dummy variables for each fifth of site income
inequality.
Results
Table 1 confirms the strong social gradient in health by
income. Most conditions showed a continuous relation
between prevalence and income across most of the
income range. However, the magnitude of the drop in
the prevalence of health problems tended to be largest
from the lowest fifth to the next fifth. The final column
in the table gives P values from two tests of association
between the prevalence of the condition and family
income. The first value reports the results when socio-

demographic characteristics were not included in the
regression, and the second value reflects a regression
adjusted for age group, sex, race or ethnicity, and com-
position of family. The association between family
income and prevalence was highly significant for
almost all conditions. The overall picture was identical
when we stratified results by income adjusted for fam-
ily size or educational achievement (less than high
school, high school, some college, college degree;
results not shown). Table 2 shows the results obtained
when we made adjustments for household composi-
tion by dividing family income by the square root of
the number of household members, where dependants
have a weight of 0.5. The results do not differ from
those in table 1 .
Table 3 shows the prevalence of health problems by
fifth of community level income inequality. Consistent
with previous studies, we found a highly significant
(P < 0.01) association between high income inequality
and the probability that a person reports being in poor
or fair health, although the finding was not robust to
adjustment for other sociodemographic factors.
Except for this self reported health measure, however,
there was no discernible pattern in health outcomes by
income inequality. A third of the conditions were most
prevalent in communities with average income
inequality, and three health problems (depression,
chronic pain, and asthma) were most prevalent in
communities with low income inequality (bottom two
fifths). With the exception of chronic gynaecological
problems, we found no significant association between
any specific health condition--chronic, mental, or
otherwise--and income inequality (including condi-
tions not shown). Even the significant result for gynae-
cological problems disappeared when individual
sociodemographic variables were taken into account.
In contrast, the highest prevalence for every condition
occurred in one of the two poorest fifths as stratified by
family income.
Figures 1 and 2 show the same relations (between
income inequality and health conditions and between
family income and health conditions) after adjustment
for differences in sociodemographic characteristics.
Table 4 summarises the results from a subset of the
sensitivity tests that we conducted, all based on
regression models controlling for other socio-
demographic variables. When we substituted income
adjusted for size of family or level of education for
family income, a strong and highly significant social
gradient remained. This was also the case for men and
women separately (results not shown). Income
inequality, on the other hand, had no effect, regardless
of whether it was measured by the state level Gini coef-
ficient, the coefficient of variation, the share of income
held by the top 50% of the income distribution, or the
ratio of the 90th to 10th centiles of the income. Nor did

we find any effect of inequality when we used subsets of
data for poorer respondents, richer respondents,
women only, men only, minorities only, or other com-
binations. Among more than 200 regression models
on the full sample that used income inequality as the
primary explanatory variable and had socio-
demographic controls, only one result was significant
at P < 0.01, but it had the wrong sign (higher state level
inequality was associated with a reduced prevalence of
arthritis or rheumatism). We paid particular attention
to potential effects of inequality among people with
lower incomes (a "weak" income inequality hypothesis)
because Kahn et al found significant effects on mental
health status among poor women.17 Our data did not
replicate their finding, even when we used their meas-
ure of income inequality.
Discussion
The relation between income inequality and health has
been at the centre of a substantial amount of research,
but the measures of health status that have been
analysed to date have largely been limited to self
reported health status or mortality in the case of physi-
cal health, and depressive symptoms or psychological
distress for mental health. To our knowledge, this study
is the first to explore the association between income
inequality and several specific physical conditions as
well as particular mental health disorders. Although
our data confirm the association between income
inequality and poor or fair self reported health, no
similar relation exists between income inequality and
depressive disorders or anxiety disorders or any of the
medical conditions assessed, either at the population
level or among people with lower incomes, wealthier
people, women, or men. On the other hand, family
income and education, which may reflect rank in the
social hierarchy, are strongly related to health. Their
effects are not confined to differences between the low-
est income group and other groups (which would
point towards material deprivation as an explanation)
but show a gradient that flattens well above the median
income level. This finding is similar to that of the
Whitehall studies of British civil servants, where social
gradients in morbidity and mortality ran from the bot-
tom to the top of the hierarchy.28­30
The sample size of this study provides good statisti-
cal power to detect differences between fifths of
inequality up to 75% smaller than the estimated differ-
ences between fifths of family income. Smaller inequal-
ity effects (that is, more than 75% smaller than the
estimated differences between fifths of income) may
not be detectable, however. Measurement error in the
site level inequality measure could also bias estimates
downward, but the results were unchanged for alterna-
tive inequality measures at the state level.
Although we found no empirical support for the
hypothesis that income inequality affects mortality or
self rated health status through higher rates of specific

medical conditions, the results do not necessarily con-
tradict previously reported associations between
income inequality and self rated health status or
mortality. Factors linking income inequality to health
may include the severity of disorder, the probability
that a person receives a diagnosis conditional on
having a disorder, and the way in which having a disor-
der determines people's perceptions of their health.
But some of these factors are likely to be influenced by
environmental factors other than income inequality,
including state policies and healthcare infrastructure,
that may be unrelated to income distribution. It seems
premature to conclude that income inequality itself is
an important risk factor for poor health, and the results
highlight the need to better understand the psycho-
logical and physiological pathways through which the
social environment affects health.

(Accepted 17 September 2001)
What is already known on this topic
Several studies have found a relation between
income inequality and self reported health or
mortality
What this study adds
There is a strong social gradient in health, as
measured by the prevalence of chronic medical
conditions and specific mental health disorders, by
income or education
No such association is seen between income
inequality and health
