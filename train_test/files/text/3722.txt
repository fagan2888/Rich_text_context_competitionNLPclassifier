Identity and Historical Question of
Food
Cookery is one of the rare arts or sciences that has no need
for confirmation of its purpose. Unlike painting, theater, or
philosophy, cookery does not suffer from a lack of apparent
utility, yet at the same time, it goes beyond its central,
momentary, and self-evident purpose to encapsulate a con-
current status as an image, a notion, and an idea. By serving
as a toy and indicator of accurate memory, both individual
and collective, food appears within the class of origin myths
(Gray, 2011). Old cookbooks offer mythological material,
with instructive correlations of (omni) knowledge about
being alive; although they preserve ancient lessons and tradi-
tions, such readings do not belong to the domain of tradi-
tional wisdom. Whether written down or shared through
vocal transmissions, the art and being of nutrition are phe-
nomena capable of unconscious, transgenerational transmis-
sions, and they determine both who we are and what we are
like, revealing perhaps more than we want them to and more
than we realize. As Tony Judt (2010) realized, "We Are What
We Eat" (p. 31), a slogan known in antiquity and Hindu
teachings as a literal caution; today, the phrase is a subject of
a wider interest and argumentation, encompassing the impact
of consumer habits on building identities (see also Foulston,
2006; McGee, 2004). It acknowledges that food is a story of
a life and a rare truth that cannot be forged. By moving beyond
alimentary biographies, bibliographies, or edible memories,
nutrition indicates identity and becomes a true reflection of
people's being, views, and experience. The resulting percep-
tion or story does not require interpretation, because it can-
not deceive or lie but is self-evident and self-sufficient.
Furthermore, it offers an inexhaustible source of research.
Food has been the subject of biology, chemistry, and anthro-
pology studies that seek the most accurate representation of
humanity (Judt, 2010). In historical terms, food is a key term,
because it represents the foundation not only of civilizations
but also of their boundaries, such that it has prompted most
of the changes in a society, provided measures of economic
growth, and indicated social fragmentation (Holtzman,
2006). In this sense, the history of food is actually the history
of the world, in that we can regard magistra vitae from the
perspective of food development and its impact on the
appearance of the magistra (Standage, 2010). In addition to
being a driving, cohesive force, the key function of food in
the history of humankind has been largely performative.
Much like Adam Smith's (1723-1790) assumption of "an
invisible hand of the market," Standage (2010) speaks about
food through a metaphor of "invisible fork" that changes the
fate of humankind, which is unaware of the main cause of
that change (pp. 14-15). In inducing divisions and struggles

From Basic Instincts to Art Performance:
Value Shifts in the Treatment of Cookery
Gordana eri1 and Laurent Tournois2
Abstract
Both science and the arts have largely disregarded cookery in their quests for the sublime and the beautiful; this article seeks
to explicate why cookery has been excluded as a subject of analytical and aesthetic interest. By reexamining the particular
sacredness attached to culture over time, this article outlines how processes of mastering spirit and knowledge go beyond
physiology and physical senses (i.e., taste and smell). Fundamental causes for the decline of an established value order, which
also gradually shifted the status of cookery, are identified. The development of food-related art and wisdom is considered
in the context of the end of the cult of culture in its commonsense usage. This essay approaches food and the art of its
preparation as an epistemological, aesthetic question, as well as an example for illustrating the decomposition of one value
system and the foundation of another; it also details the new opportunities this transformation creates.

for power throughout all historical periods, food continually
represents a backdrop for all other contests and struggles.
The history of the world, as we know it, thus is inextricable
from the history of food. More than any other fear, fears
about a lack of food are easy to manipulate and effective
routes to conquest. Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin (2002)
provided remarkably early insights into the importance of
nutrition, claiming that the destiny of a nation depends on a
type of food it has chosen. Despite offering an effective plat-
form for the physiology of taste, his early 19th-century work
remained on the margins of learning until recently. Yet
Brillat-Savarin essentially established the scholarly disci-
pline, unrecognized in his time, of transcendental gastron-
omy. Soon thereafter, Nietzsche (1888) conditioned the
salvation of humankind on its nutrition, suggesting that the
slavery of ideology that confined people could best be mea-
sured by their inability to conceive of alternatives, such as in
their food selections.
As an insatiable desire and driving force, food also consti-
tutes a passion, reflecting instinct. In recent years, it has come
to represent either salvation or catastrophe, such as when it is
proposed as a cure or the cause of virtually any disease. Any
manipulation of food, whether collection, cultivation, prepara-
tion, or consumption, represents a cultural act (Montanari,
2006)--more than merely knowledge or merely discourse or
merely culture or merely need, though it also is all of those
things simultaneously. Traditional approaches forget, or
ignore, that food entails both primary enjoyments and elemen-
tary values, such as emotional and energy values. However, by
vulgarizing food perceptions, the cliché view of needs has
greatly and negatively affected human self-perceptions.
Guided by the language of needs and necessities, or things
we cannot live without, the only acceptable definition states
that human survival necessitates food. Such a view has deter-
mined the shape of the world, whose history--regardless of
perspective--demonstrates the great influences of both hunger
and love, as initially established by Freud (1930) and his
Viennese colleagues. In studies that focus systematically on the
study of instinct and gratification, far more progress has been
made in investigating the skills and techniques related to the
preparation of food than in parallel research into sexology
(Zeldin, 1995). In this narrow assessment, the origin of civiliza-
tion emerged not just from the conjugal bed but by the emer-
gence of cooking--the mother of humankind, such that one
theory holds that primates became human approximately two
millionyearsago,whentheypreparedthefirstmeal(Wrangham,
2009). Comparable with Darwinian theory in its provocative-
ness and comprehensiveness, Wrangham's theory identifies an
initial stage of society as the family, which used the art of living
together in organization around a fire and roasting the items that
had been hunted and collected. Cooking has made us the people
that we are today, claims the author, it steered us toward civiliza-
tion, initiated the evolutionary leap, and transformed necessity
into artistry, a herd into a group that enjoys meals together. How
and whether cookery is equivalent to other arts and sciences,
and why humankind has taken so long to recognize the activ-
ity as such, constitute the central research questions for this
article. We adopt a historical perspective, such that the debate
appears ingrained with issues of values and our inconsistent
relation to those values over time. In this sense, we use
Perroux's (1943) terminology, which defines values as state-
ments or objects that have been assigned importance.
Phenomena of value correspond to (comparative) judgments
about the importance of goods and are based on individual
preference scales. These phenomena of value can be found in
any economic system.
The Long Prehistory of the First
Revolution
An overemphasis on the corporeal and organic, focused on the
nose, mouth, tongue, and digestive system, has degraded the
culinary realm for centuries. In contrast, the process of master-
ing the spirit and knowledge disregarded or conflicted with
notions of physiology. In a quest for an absolute, the owners of
wisdom and guardians of metaphysical knowledge bypassed
trivial, necessary, and commonplace ideas, such that scholarly
and aesthetic inquiry ignored instincts and urges. Theories of
art and epistemology were associated only with hearing or
sight. In the name of progress and civilization, culture built a
wall against biology. For centuries, preferences centered on
the pleasures of contemplation and continence rather than an
immediate, widely available enjoyment. Because no insights
into these spheres and their mastery was available, it became
impossible for them to attain cultural status.
With its apparent and simple purpose, food became pri-
marily associated with consumption and satiety, similar to
how the sexual act came to be understood through orgasm or
reproduction, that is, through its function. Indolence and
contemptuous attitudes emerged from the social and human-
istic schools of thought toward biology and instinctive senses
of taste and smell, as indirectly reflected in a vulgar, func-
tionalistic perception of food consumption. For many years,
cookery did not have its place in traditionally viewed aes-
thetics. Furthermore, traditional theorists failed to recognize
the evident, fundamental artistic principles culinary acts,
which include creation aimed at experience (not just reading,
listening, or seeing); unity in action, place, and time; and dis-
tinctive performativity principles, in the sense that the culi-
nary act transforms not just states and feelings but the body
as well.
Because it is apparent, utilitarian, and broadly under-
standable, the art of cooking does not generally produce
ambiguity; in contrast, classical arts have relied on principles
such as an unclear purpose, distinctiveness, flow of time,
abstractness, demands, or incomprehensibility except to an
exclusive minority.
Closely related to biological needs and temporally coded,
the necessary act of cookery had been painfully and slowly
becoming a subject of focused analytical or aesthetic research,
eri and Tournois 3
perhaps also because it reminded the anthropocentric schol-
ars of the unpleasant human proximity to animals. Finally,
the opposition to perceiving the art of cooking emerged from
efforts to preserve the prohibitions and cult of culture, which
entail dependence on conventional or dominant orders in the
organization of knowledge and skills, leading to a lack of
ability to realize or recognize alternatives. Bound by self-
interest, no existing order can approve of originality, even
though seeking alternatives should be the primary founda-
tion for cultural critiques.
To obtain their current prominence, gastronomic knowl-
edge and skill have required both time and true devotees,
including artists, eccentrics, provocateurs, and multidisci-
plinary scholars, as well as some favorable circumstances.
For this discussion, we note that the first recorded use of the
term gastronomy dates back to 1623, but it entered the com-
mon lexicon only after the foundation of corresponding
research, including iterative experiments, examinations,
classifications, analyses, and obtained facts and conclusions.
In turn, such research required significant progress in the
skills associated with preparing various dishes; linguisti-
cally, it required a practice that was sufficiently recogniz-
able, as occurred in the aftermath of the French Revolution.
According to Onfray (1997), "1793 marked the emergence
of gastronomy" (p. 146). However, because of the clarity,
naturalness, and distinctiveness of the experience of senses
of taste and smell, they remained difficult to prove and thus
unrecognized or neglected as subjects of study for consider-
able time.1 Yet these senses, which are arbiters of what is
edible or inedible, tasty or unpalatable, are incomparable in
their power and sophistication; few visual or acoustic stimuli
prompt such accurate reactions. In literature, the sense of
smell is the only one whose vitality and fatality have been
characterized by a profound, lucid, existential, literary, and
aesthetic reflections (Süskind, 1986). Reactions to smell and
taste include altered moods and conditions, which become
manifest instantly and in a distinctly individual manner,
whether reflexive, mimicking, or onomatopoeic.
These reactions also are difficult to hide and influenced
by cultural, collective traditions (e.g., Douglas, 1966; Largey
& Watson, 1972; Sokolov, 1991; Synnott, 1991). This influ-
ence has decisive importance, because over the time, taste
becomes the character of a culture. Unlike Claude Levi-
Strauss and structuralists, who prioritize cultural conven-
tions to distinguish edible from inedible, Harris introduces
biopsychological, ecological, and political-economic deter-
minants of the consumption and production of food (Harris,
1987). If we overcome disciplinary limitations and prefer-
ences, it is difficult to deny the existence of culinary codes in
every society that regulate complex geographic, historical,
and developmental characteristics, as well as customs, reli-
gions, worldviews, and alimentary habits, semiotics, and
design. Because this influence is broader than the individual
level, these issues belong to the domain of cultural anthro-
pology more than any other field. Nothing is inherently tasty
or unsavory, whether dogs, snails, locusts, or pigs; that which
is edible or inedible is both an individual choice and a choice
made by our cultures (see Korsmeyer, 2002).
More profound and intimate than other stimuli, smells
and tastes recount, better than words, what we would not
remember otherwise. Like the amalgamated voice of chemi-
cal and emotional processes, they are heralds of the uncon-
scious and neglected triggers of forgotten personal
experiences. Both smell and taste can revive memories of
past events, and from a physiology perspective, oblivion is
deceptive, such that we would approach memory and obliv-
ion differently if we studied them through the registers of
smell and taste--those sudden stimuli that highlight the per-
manence experience. Scent reminders reveal that, in an emo-
tional sense, anything that once existed never disappears. It
is very much the same with the theoretical-historical treat-
ment of culinary art: Dogged by controversies, these issues
had been slowly attracting a focused research or aesthetic
attention, first in philosophy and later in other scholarly
disciplines.
Without creativity and inspiration, cookery could not
progress, yet it generally has been approached as knowledge
that gets transformed into a repetitive routine. Of course, it is
a routine, just like any other arts based on knowledge and
clichés. The procedure is the same; the only thing that differs
is the value position taken toward one or the other type of
activity or art. If classical aesthetics include "masters and
dilettanti, authentic authors and epigoni, creators and follow-
ers, ingenious minds and spiritual dwarfs, then the same will
hold true for the culinary field" (Onfray, 1997, p. 142).
In short, food is widely understandable and indispensable
for everyone, which is both its advantage and its greatest
shortcoming with regard to the status of food as art in its
preparation. The immediate, direct gratification of instincts
deprived cookery of both aesthetic status and attention as an
important research subject, though without this instinctive
element, it is difficult to imagine the existence of any related
art or significant achievement. Instead, the domination of a
"rational," hierarchical system of values and knowledge
requires an extraordinary performance: to prove the undeni-
able, self-evident value of culinary works using weighty
approaches from art and science.
If no other method enables us to make ourselves under-
stood, we note that the wisdom and art of nutrition precede
enlightenment in other disciplines. In philosophical anthro-
pology, the importance of food is most easily recognized in
the Epicurean tradition, a conceptualization of humans and
the world in which pleasure is the highest good, continuing
Democritus's materialistic system of thought. Post antiquity,
centuries passed before sensuous experiences were seriously
contemplated; as late as the 17th century, owing to John Locke
and empiricism, sensuous experience earned legitimacy
through the certitude of cognition, that is, Locke's (1995)
well-known assertion that there is nothing in the mind except
what was first in the senses.The emergence of empiricism
4 SAGE Open
opened the door to Julien de Offray de La Mettrie's (1997)
ethics of sensuous pleasures, in which he argued that "instinct
is wiser than intellect" (p. 10).
Because of his claim that psychological occurrences must
be related to organic changes in the nervous system, he was
severely criticized first by his fellow physicians and later by
Enlightenment thinkers (Voltaire, Diderot, and d'Holbach).
The attack on La Mettrie came from all sides: He was
despised and attacked by everyone, from the French king,
senior clerics, Enlightenment thinkers to academic dignitar-
ies. His positions, disputable for the beginning of 18th cen-
tury, inevitably led to his being driven to Berlin, under the
protective patronage of Frederick the Great, where he ended
his life (1751), following a sumptuous dinner prepared in his
honor. La Mettrie's death, allegedly caused by an excessive
consumption of pheasant pate in truffle cream sauce, or
deliberate poisoning--it had never been established--spar-
kled speculations that it was a deserved punishment for his
excessively sensual and hedonistic views. In an era ruled by
theoretical intellect (i.e., civilized behavior and restraint), it
was difficult to write about the finest morality of enjoyment
or the life whose purpose was seeking for pleasures.
Unfinished First Revolution
Although Alexandre Balthazar Laurent Grimod de La
Reynière and Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin did not immedi-
ately follow La Mettrie, the founders of the gastronomic
alphabet continued his hedonic-sensual thought, specializing
in the wisdom and art of good dining. Through practical and
theoretical work, they aimed to prove that skillful treatments
of food, more than any other skill or art, constitute quests for
taste and the sublime. By preferring the invention of a new
meal to the discovery of an unknown celestial body, they
applied their talents to the only topic that also can be tasted.
Grimod de La Reynière was an eccentric theater lover and
critic, who created what modern speakers would call an
event. This conceptual artist was a member of various societ-
ies that gathered on specific days of the week to develop, and
enjoy, the procedures of the emerging science of gastronomy.
The results of these gatherings were not just new edible
inventions but also rules for naming and evaluating meals, as
well as improved manners, forms, and orders for serving
food. They introduced the idea of a lift between the kitchen
and dining room, and they produced the methodological
notion of a jury of tasters, which still remains an essential
institution for testing new technologies or ingredients in food
preparation. Such a jury of tasters is responsible for reflect-
ing on and evaluating morsels to determine the taste of a
dish, prior to writing any text or review.
To introduce gastronomy into the fine arts, Grimod de La
Reynière (1978) presented his idea as a revolution, designed to
overcome the stale order that marked the organization of values
and knowledge. The same aim was pursued by Brillat-Savarin
(2002), who did not conceal his demand for the highest
position for gastronomy. Proceeding from the recognition
that nothing can live without food, these provocateurs further
asserted that there could be no metaphysics or politics with-
out the reconciliation of humans with their urges, passions,
and instincts. Ignoring the ruling order as much as it ignored
them (their contemporaries remained mistrusting and scared
of their originality), these founders of hedonism evaluated
historical epochs only according to their contributions to the
alimentary and progress made in the preparation of food,
whether practical, technological, aesthetic, or hedonistic. To
avoid semantic misconceptions, we also note that the hedo-
nism Grimod de La Reynière practiced had little in common
with the contemporary sense of this term; rather, it implied
self-control, manners, semi-satiating bites, rituals, forms,
order, sensibility, reflection, and intelligent conversations
during the course of meals, which represented acts to share
pleasures and establish closeness (Onfray, 1997). It was not
immoderateness or gluttony but quite the opposite, namely,
controlled restraint.
Another multitalented gastronomist and a contemporary
of the originators of the gastronomic scene--as well as true
devotee to the beautiful and tasty--Antonin Carême sought
to achieve through cookery (pastry making in particular)
what he could not do through architecture. Faced with rejec-
tions of his projects, he shifted his talent to culinary writings
and discussions of the art of French cuisine, along with draw-
ings, copper plate engravings, and "deteriorative," edible
works modeled after architectural designs. With his knowl-
edge of architectural styles, which he applied to food prepa-
ration, Carême became the originator of bourgeois cuisine,
defined as follows:
The bourgeois cuisine attempts to bound the internal by
the external, to negate the spiritual refinement of a dish by an
alluring appearance. That is the reason for such popularity of
flambé dish preparation, over-pouring and permeation, soak-
ing and benumbing the taste by alcohol; saucing, covering
by cream, butter, and béchamel sauce spread. Then, glaze
icing, which hardens the dish and fixes it by a layer of jelly;
poaching and frying in bread crumbs, which disguise the true
appearance of eggs and chicken; filling, by means of which
volume is artificially increased, and a false appearance is
created (Onfray, 1997). This step forward in culinary form,
texture, content, and poetic naming is largely manifested in
the altered approach to the contemporary culinary order,
which relied solely on taste and smell. By subordinating his
approach to the sense of sight, he shifted the art of well-pre-
pared dishes from a focus on smelling to visual sensations,
while also directing attention to stylistic harmony and visual
effects.
Although hungry for recognition, Carême had to content
himself during his lifetime with the title pastry chef-archi-
tect, or the Palladio of French cuisine. The new world emerg-
ing after the French Revolution needed precisely this type of
talent, because it celebrated (including through food) the
power of money as a new master, as possessed by merchants,
eri and Tournois 5
entrepreneurs, and members of the bourgeoisie. Although
opposed to the ruling system, Carême served the emerging
order--as, for that matter, did Brillat-Savarin and Grimod de
La Reynière--because "by abolishing one system of privi-
leges based on blood, the French revolution created prerequi-
sites for establishment of a brilliant, brand-new system, this
time based on money" (Onfray, 1997, p. 152).
In the years that followed the political revolution, the culi-
nary revolution remained incomplete, important only to itself
and a narrow circle of people who could benefit from it. The
main ideas of its actors were left unrealized, and the extant
value and knowledge order stayed intact. Chefs remained
chefs, the bourgeoisie enjoyed ever-tastier dishes, and artists
and metaphysicians continued to guard their artistic "tem-
ple." Good dishes were necessary but not sufficient to invoke
a fundamental change of the value system, which instead
required outside influence, aided by the receptiveness, and
the weaknesses, of the culture itself, as it started to consume
itself. Ultimately though, the culinary specialties of true rev-
olutionaries Brillat-Savarin, Grimod, and Carême would be
enjoyed by their gastronomic progeny in France and world-
wide through different types of cheese, cakes, and various
other dishes--all savored in a French manner of dining. By
eating their dishes, the disciples extended the life of their
creators, who will, after an uninterrupted continuity of prac-
ticing, experience the triumph of deserved world fame and
the victory in the present day theory and aesthetics--their
culinary ideas and inventions will be replicated by the artists
who wished to be recognized as such.
In the 19th century, these culinary provocateurs (i.e.,
Brillat-Savarin, Grimod, and Carême) could have found per-
haps their greatest ally in Friedrich Nietzsche, a self-pro-
claimed disciple of Dionysus. Whether he knew of their
endeavors, Nietzsche's (1888) poetics of life spoke in their
disembodied voices, in his attempt to reassess all values,
including his claims that human salvation depends on the
form of nutrition. He gave priority to issues of food, climate,
and residence over to all other questions, despite his tradi-
tional German education, "which from the beginning teaches
losing sight of realities, in order to run after entirely prob-
lematic, so called `ideal' objectives" (p. 41). Indulging his
instinct to overthrow idols and idealistic or rationalistic
hoaxers throughout history, this self-confident sage claimed
that what and how we think is directly determined by what
we eat.
Following this proclamation of the poetics of life in the
late 19th century, many authors remained indebted to
Nietzsche, whether they recognized it or not (mostly not).
The question of how we become what we are, as posed in
the subtitle of Ecce Homo, appears in Wrangham's (2009)
theory of cooking as the mother of mankind. However,
even today, it is difficult to regard Nietzsche as being one
of the founders of the ideas on wisdom and art of food
consumption, as his work has been rarely interpreted in
this key.
The (R)evolution That Guardians of the
Cult of Culture Cannot Digest
The complex question of the internal collapse of the cult of
culture, and its co-relation with an event, historical circum-
stances, or cumulative discontent, necessarily surpasses the
available framework of any one discipline, as well as our
knowledge and ambitions. However, in a context that per-
tains, directly or indirectly, to the change in the status of the
art of cooking, we find a decisive role of Marcel Duchamp--
cooking, a decisive role was performed by Marcel Duchamp
with his Chocolate Grinder (1913)--at the end of an epoch
or at the dawn of a short 20th century (Hobsbawm, 1994).
Yet it is hard to define whether Duchamp's subversive acts
were directed at visual arts, to overcome the gap between art
itself and the living world, or aimed to signify the erosion of
the previous order of things in the value system and organi-
zation of knowledge, in terms of perceptions of sublime ver-
sus low. Beyond objects and images, in the verbal realms of
social and humanistic studies, indicators of change and dis-
content with the ruling value order doubtlessly were
expressed before and after Duchamp, such as in Physiology
of Taste by Brillat-Savarin; in Nietzsche's writings; in psy-
choanalysis, when Freud declared that something is wrong
with our standards and that "It is impossible to escape the
impression that people commonly use false standards of
measurement . . . They disparage, however, the true living val-
ues" (Freud, 1930); later in the works by Theodore Adorno,
Claude Levi-Strauss and Roland Barthes. For example,
Barthes (1972) helped encourage the shift from linguistic
semiology to a cultural version, summarized as poststructural-
ist critique. Through his analyses of advertisements for pan-
zani spaghetti and similar works, Barthes also revealed an
interest in studies of food (see Barthes, 1983).
Some versions of this cultural end cite the decline of
visual arts and art critiques in the 1970s, whereas others note
the trend of identifying marketing with culture (Seabrook,
2000), through the dominance of representation, such that
the positions of the symbol and the symbolized switch. Still
others focus on the so-called death of the author. Yet they all
agree that symbolic value of the cultural or artistic, in the old
sense, became devaluated long ago. The value of the related
theory is its ability to register these processes and attempt to
find their causes, though the most convincing anticipation of
the profound changes actually emerged much earlier, in a lit-
erary rather than theoretical domain. That is, Robert Musil
(1965) predicted quick shifts in the evaluation of scientific
knowledge, claiming
Our teaching is so strong that it will transform the cesspool of
your sins into clear, sparkling mountain streams. But in science
it happens every few years that something till then held to be in
error suddenly revolutionizes the field, or that some dim and
disdained idea becomes the ruler of a new realm of thought.
Such events are not merely upheavals, but lead us upward like a
Jacob's ladder. (p. 43)

He also foreshadowed the marginalization of humanistic
values that had been typical of the period before 1914.
Cultural theorists, in their irrepressible drive to break from
obsolete terms and previously imposed metaphysical objec-
tives, slowly released the ballast of the past, to always find
something new and interesting. Finally, by the end of the
century, humanists had unburdened themselves of every-
thing from the "dark past" and thus irreversibly marginalized
themselves as well.
Regardless of the perspective taken, the collapse of the
cult of culture took place during the "short twentieth cen-
tury" (Caryl, 2013; Hobsbawm, 1994), whether we locate its
symbolic end in 1979 or 1989. For those who live of and for
culture, nothing would be the same after that end, as perhaps
best revealed in the context of fine arts--the first space to
open to culinary arts and ultimately its subordinate in the
promotion of aesthetic, hedonistic, and consumer aspects.
The release from the visual provided a beneficial, important
strategy for survival in the new understanding of the cultural
sphere. Saboteurs in their own fields licensed their profes-
sional non-involvement strategy first as a provocation, then
as a fashion or practices; as a result, few modern artists actu-
ally paint. This virus of obstruction and destruction of tradi-
tional disciplinary conventions spread to other fields, and
literary and humanistic critique in general. Camille Paglia
(1998), as early as the late 1970s, lucidly identified the lack
of negative critique in the United States and the prevailing
standard of cautious, indulgent reviews. From her perspec-
tive, when academic whistles and bells quiet down, an atmo-
sphere of general uniformity and simulation prevails; in
frustrated response, Paglia sharply criticized the inertial aca-
demic world, including the gap between it and commercial
mass media; the means by which humanistic science, in the
service of politics, had become cheap propaganda; and voy-
eurism as a dominant cultural cliché.
In the late short 20th century culture, with the decisive aid
of several actors such as Daniel Spoerri and Peter Kubelka,
autonomy in the conventional sense of the word was lost.
Even if not dead, culture in the 21st century changed, com-
pared with the previous century's perception. Cookery ben-
efited from this death though, as a marginal, unexpected
beneficiary of complex processes, as well as directed action.
In the early 1960s, Daniel Spoerri attached notes reading,
"attention, work of art" to delicatessen products; in the
1970s, as the eat-art movement was established in Milan, he
was appointed a lecturer in the Department of Fine Arts of
the Academy in Cologne (Onfray, 1997, p. 217). Reacting to
decadence in art, this author concluded that nothing remained
but "the sublime art of cookery" for acquiring the knowledge
about oneself. In 1978, the film director and musician Peter
Kubelka became a cookery lecturer at the Academy of Fine
Arts in Frankfurt, in which role he taught that more could be
achieved by raising awareness of and education about the
senses than through intellect. Yet these examples remained
exceptions at the time, whereas in the present time, they would
represent regular practice. Cookery clearly has gained legiti-
macy as an academic subject, as exemplified by the introduc-
tion of relevant theory and practice in schools. French
elementary school pupils already participate in systematic
training in the study and formation of taste. This formation of
personal identity through taste can hardly be separated from
a general relation to the world or one's body. In addition, the
curriculum includes experimenting with known and unknown
dishes and encouraging openness to the sensations, smells,
and tastes of different cultures (Zeldin, 1995).
The dynamic relationship between cookery and art is
experiencing a sharp shift today. The traditionally subordi-
nated position of cookery to art finally has been altered,
largely through the intervention of Marina Abramovi.
Cookery will no longer use the back door to access aesthetics
and knowledge, but instead, the symbolic capital of art must
appeal to cookery. In her performance Let Them Eat Volcano
Flambé! staged in the New York restaurant Park Avenue
Winter, Abramovi effectively demonstrated the equivalence
of the value of cookery and art, by equalizing the price of a
museum ticket and the price of cake: US$20 was the price of
entrance to the New York Museum of Modern Art and for the
consumption of a dessert that featured her signature. With
her flambé cake sprinkled by golden leaves, the performance
artist went even further, to achieve more than a mere equiva-
lence, through a direct quotation of Antonin Carême, the
founder of bourgeois cuisine. Using flambé and glazed icing
procedures to subordinate, in value terms, the internal con-
tent to external manifestations, Abramovi confirmed the
paradigm through a combative binary structure, making her
the Carême of American art. If cookery, in the altered value
order, gains the status of a superior, prestigious form of art,
then this new value hierarchy also must be reflected in our
language, so the formulation, Carême of American art, must
be understood affirmatively, rather than ironically or disparag-
ingly. When Carême claimed himself a Palladio of French cui-
sine, his pride reflected the current hierarchy at the time.
Calling her the Carême of American art is a compliment to
Abramovi, within a value system in which the art of food
preparation dominates. Accordingly, even as she maintains
essentialist frameworks of internal and external, spiritual and
material, Abramovi demonstrates the shift of the traditional
relations of these values in the cultural hierarchy and affirms
material, hedonist, and luxury values on formal level, marked
by golden leaves and flambé. Although this shift can be inter-
preted in at least two ways, the performance clearly transforms
an old value order and symbolically verifies the change, a
long-term process achieved by various means. The initiation
of cookery into the art world through performance is not
unusual, because this art form is the closest to the single-time,
unrepeatable quality of a culinary act. The question that
remains is whether the symbolic capital of the artistic perfor-
mance of Let Them Eat Volcano Flambé! serves more than the
purpose of the value inversion of a long-lasting dichotomy,
built through various means, or contributes to its overthrow.
eri and Tournois 7
One way or another though, "a tortilla has been tossed,"
as a colloquial Spanish saying goes. Things were in their
proper order; the art of preparing and consuming food
acquired the status it has deserved from the beginning. Yet it
would be bitterly noticed by guardians of the metaphysical
temple, in a vain attempt to understand the historical move-
ments. Ironically, the art of cookery came to triumph in a
period that, through "progress" and the serial production of
food, downgraded our consumption to a prehistoric status:
Similar to their distant ancestors, modern consumers have
meals in places imposed by need, such as fast food stands
and petrol stations. Because the expansion of cookery coin-
cided with the fall of "true culture," comparisons are inevi-
table--though the global fame and influence of Jamie Oliver
are hardly comparable with the fame and influence of any
painter, playwright, or philosopher. Initiated during the
Enlightenment but neglected for two centuries, gastronomy
is teaching us a modern lesson, as the manifestation of civi-
lized behavior, described in studies that have acquired the
dignity of representing a prestigious scholarly discipline.
Ever increasing investments in the study of food, frequently
by faculties in the social sciences, design, and art, testify that
cookery is no longer a distant relative or exotic, unnecessary
spice. On the contrary, it has become an experimentally
established, verifiable expression of mutual conditioning:
Through gastronomy, and its molecular form in particular, a
powerful alliance has been established between the rational
and emotional attainment of an objective (This, 2009).
Conclusion
The winds of change have started to blow, bringing with
them a dynamic era in which, due to progress in communica-
tions among other things, culture in the old sense of the word
has contributed to its own end. For those lulled by the pre-
dictability of the previous linear flow of time, the ruling
order, similar to a menu, appeared innovated to the point of
inedibility. Butmenus cannot change without intentions of
change; similarly, these extensive changes could not have
occurred without some dissatisfaction with the previous
state. As a result of our frequently distasteful anthropological
theories, the segment of reality that makes our world both
tastier and more understandable had been marginalized. In
this process, supporters of traditional arts--possibly weary
of examining the aesthetic possibilities of known-to-all pas-
sions--could have either shrugged their shoulders and joined
the trend, or else observed from a distance how the unique
experience of creation, including through cookery, became
commonplace, usual, and banal. In the language of the domi-
nant culture of market values and numbers, they might have
observed how prices dropped rapidly with the emergence of
new artists, including culinary ones.
Throughout its history, leading to the status that it enjoys
today, cookery has had to traverse long distances, from a routine
necessity aimed at fulfilling basic needs to an art performance.
It has been an uninterrupted path of testing and perfecting
culinary skills, first by sense of smell and taste and later in time
engaging all other senses. In that process, food has become
much more than a central existential problem; its skilled prepa-
ration involves, at the same time, the art of mastering the taste,
color, proportions, and, ultimately, the time and the meaning.
Its status development, leading to its transformation into
an artistic act, consisted of slow changes in viewers'perspec-
tives, sometimes painstakingly, in that awareness of the aes-
thetic and epistemological value of culinary works lagged
behind knowledge of food preparation. However, a rigid cul-
tural order can be transformed and democratized through a
series of more or less successful revolutions that insist on
awareness of the importance of all senses and receptiveness
to different viewpoints, as unequivocally demonstrated by
the history of cookery. In retrospect, cookery has been invis-
ible as a subject of a serious aesthetic and analytical reflec-
tions, treated as an object of refraction for metaphysical and
physical contemplations on the sublime or the low, and an
independent path with a performative impact. The persistent
influence of cookery on the domain of thought also is appar-
ent in the alimentary metaphors used in this text, which facil-
itate the "digestion" of the complex topics. Yet even though
it remains a demanding topic of study--one that puts taste, as
a measure, to test--the art of cookery is also a research-
friendly topic, which should serve as a constant reminder
that we cannot linger too long on its theoretical development.
To conclude, Dewey (2005) wrote "by one of the ironic per-
versities that often attend the course of affairs, the existence
of the works of art upon which formation of an esthetic the-
ory depends, has become an obstruction to theory about
them" (p. 3; see also Shusterman, 2010).
