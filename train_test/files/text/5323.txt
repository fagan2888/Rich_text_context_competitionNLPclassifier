Abstract
Objective: We evaluated the efficacy of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of
postoperative shivering.
Methods: We searched PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE and Web of Knowledge to find
randomized controlled trials (RCT) of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for the prevention of
postoperative shivering. Two researchers independently screened studies, extracted data, and
assessed quality in accordance with the inclusion and exclusion criteria, and then conducted a
meta-analysis using RevMan 5.2.
Results: Ultimately, 14 RCTs that included 980 patients were included in the analysis. We found
that: 1) the incidence of shivering was significantly lower in 5-HT3 groups than placebo groups
(relative risk, [RR] ¼ 0.48, 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.40 ­ 0.58); 2) there was no significant
difference in the incidence of shivering between 5-HT3 groups and meperidine groups (RR ¼ 0.89,
95% CI 0.60 ­ 1.34).
Conclusion: 5-HT3 receptor antagonists appear to prevent postoperative shivering, with a
broadly comparable efficacy to meperidine.

Introduction
Postoperative shivering reportedly compli-
cates emergence from anaesthesia in 5% to
60% of cases.1 Postoperative shivering can
provoke elevation in cellular metabolism,
oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide
production; hypoxaemia and lactic acidosis
may occur in severe cases. Physical and

pharmacologic methods have been used to
prevent postoperative shivering, with vari-
able success. Opioid and non-opioid drugs
are often used to treat postoperative shiver-
ing, but they have potential side effects,
including hypotension, hypertension, sed-
ation, respiratory depression, nausea and
vomiting.2,3 More recently, 5-HT3 receptor
antagonists have emerged as a means of
preventing postoperative shivering. We
undertook a meta-analysis of controlled clin-
ical trials of 5-HT3 receptor antagonists for
the prevention of postoperative shivering to
assess their efficacy.
Materials & methods
Inclusion criteria
We identified randomized controlled trials
(RCTs) of patients undergoing elective sur-
gery under general or spinal anaesthesia. The
intervention in the experimental group was
an intravenously administered 5-HT3 recep-
tor antagonist; the control groups included
an intravenous injection of placebo (physio-
logic saline), or meperidine. The main out-
come indicator in eligible studies was the
occurrence of postoperative shivering.
Exclusion criteria
We excluded studies in which 5-HT3 antag-
onists were administered in combination
with other drugs to prevent shivering,
those with incomplete information or data,
and articles for which we could not obtain
the full text.
Search strategy
We searched articles published from incep-
tion to May 2016 in the Cochrane Library,
PubMed, EMBASE and Web of
Knowledge. A combination of subject
headings with keyword searching was
employed and document types were not
restricted. English search terms included
``ondansetron'', ``5-HT3receptor antago-
nists'', ``Lpalonosetron'', ``granisetron'',
``tropisetron'', ``postoperative shivering'',
``postanaesthetic shivering'', ``Lshivering''
and ``anesthesia''. et cetera.
Literature screening and quality evaluation
Two researchers independently screened
studies and extracted data, then cross-
checked with each other. The two resolved
disagreements by discussion or consulted a
third party when consensus could not be
reached. We evaluated methodologic quality
of the RCTs identified using a modified
Jadad scale.4 Evaluation included random-
ization, allocation concealment, and blind-
ing of implementers and participants.
Data extraction
Two researchers independently extracted
data using tables designed in advance, and
then cross-checked with each other. The two
resolved disagreements by discussion or con-
sulted a third party when consensus could not
be reached. Extracted data included: names
of the researchers, year of publication, study
design, interventions, control measures, out-
come indicators, target events and the overall
sample size.
Statistical methods
Statistical analysis was conducted via using
the RevMan 5.2 program, provided by the
Cochrane Collaboration (London, UK).
First, heterogeneity was tested using the
chi-squared and I2 tests: when there was no
heterogeneity (P > 0.1 and I2 < 50%, respect-
ively), we adopted a fixed-effects model.
When we detected heterogeneity, we
employed a random-effects model and we
subsequently made an assessment of stability
by undertaking further meta-analyses while
eliminating studies one by one. For continu-
ous variables, the weighted mean difference
Zhou et al. 1175
was used, and for enumeration data, relative
risk (RR) was calculated. All effect sizes were
represented by 95% confidence intervals (CI),
and when P< 0.05, the results were considered
statistically significant. We used funnel plots to
establish whether there was publication bias.
Results
Search results
We identified 248 articles using our search
strategy; 17 were selected for further screening
against our inclusion and exclusion criteria
after reading the titles and checking for dupli-
cate publication. One was excluded as the full
text was not available,5 another because the 5-
HT3 antagonist was administered in combin-
ation with other drugs6 and another because
the number of shivering patients was not
provided.7 Ultimately, 14 RCTs were included
in the meta-analysis.8­21 Figure 1 shows our
literature screening process.
Characteristics of included studies
The included studies comprised 980 partici-
pants, 499 of whom were allocated to
experimental groups and 481 to control
groups. Cases included in the study are
presented in Table 1.
Quality assessment of included studies
The 14 included studies all employed a
randomized group model. The implementa-
tion of the blinding method was not
described in three studies.8,15,16 None of
the studies was assessed to exhibit selective
reporting (Table 1).
Meta-analysis results
All studies reported the incidence of shiver-
ing, but each study defined shivering differ-
ently and the durations of observation for
shivering were inconsistent. We elected to
analyse the total incidence of shivering only,
and did not seek to quantify the extent of
shivering.
The incidence of postoperative shivering. All
studies compared the incidence of post-
operative shivering. No statistical hetero-
geneity (P ¼ 0.20, I2 ¼ 24%) was found

among 14 studies, therefore, a fixed effects
model was applied to conduct the meta-
analysis. The incidence of postoperative
shivering was significantly lower in
experimental groups than control groups
(RR ¼ 0.48, 95% CI 0.40 ­ 0.58,
P < 0.00001; Figure 2). We identified het-
erogeneity in the studies of postoperative

those of general anaesthesia (Table 2).
Subgroup meta-analysis by aesthetic tech-
nique, using random and fixed effects models,
respectively, demonstrated that 5-HT3 recep-
tor antagonists were associated with signifi-
cant reductions in the risk of postoperative
shivering in patients undergoing both modes
of anaesthesia (Table 2).
Six studies, totalling 376 patients, com-
pared 5-HT3 receptor antagonists with
meperidine for postoperative shiver-
ing.11,14,16,18,20 We identified an acceptable
lack of heterogeneity between the studies
(P ¼ 0.16, I2 ¼ 36%), so used a fixed effects
model for meta-analysis. We found that no
statistically significant difference between
the incidence of shivering in the 5-HT3
receptor antagonist and meperidine groups
(RR ¼ 0.89, 95% CI 0.60­1.34, P ¼ 0.59;
Figure 3).
Sensitivity and funnel plot analysis
Funnel plot analysis indicated that the
results were symmetrical, suggesting that
there was no publication bias (Figure 4).
After the complete meta-analysis, we under-
took subsequent meta-analyses excluding
studies one by one, and found that the
results were consistent with those obtained
before exclusion, implying that stability was
satisfactory.
Discussion
This meta-analysis indicated that 5-HT3
receptor antagonists appear to prevent

postoperative shivering, with a broadly com-
parable efficacy to meperidine. Shivering is a
common complication of emergence from
anaesthesia. Shivering is generally considered
to be a thermoregulatory phenomenon, a
physiologic response to lowering of core
body temperature during anaesthesia.
Nonetheless, heat preservation and adminis-
tration of warmed fluids does not eliminate
shivering.22 Under spinal anaesthesia, shiver-
ing occurs as a thermoregulatory response to
lowering of core body temperature and
reductions in blood supply to the upper
body. Thermoregulation is controlled by
central nervous system neurotransmitters in
the hypothalamus; the preoptic area of the
hypothalamus releases 5-HT3 to activate
heat production pathways, and thus increase
body temperature. In mouse models, intra-
venous administration of 5-HT3 reportedly
provokes vaso-dilation and shivering,23 sug-
gesting that 5-HT3-mediated pathways play
an import-ant role in the control of post-
operative shivering. 5-HT3 antagonists may

prevent postoperative shivering by inhibiting
reuptake of 5-HT in the preoptic area.1
Shivering after general anaesthesia and
after spinal anaesthesia may have different
causes. General anaesthesia likely impairs
central thermoregulation, while spinal
anaesthesia impairs peripheral and central
thermoregulation by increasing the inter-
threshold range, increasing the sweating
threshold, and reducing the shivering and
vasoconstriction thresholds.24 Core tem-
perature reduction reportedly peaks 3 ­ 4
hours after induction of general anaesthesia,
but no such peak occurs after spinal anaes-
thesia; vasoconstriction will occur when the
core temperature reaches the vasoconstric-
tion threshold in general anaesthesia, but
not in spinal anaesthesia.25 Interestingly,
despite the potential differences in mechan-
isms, our meta-analysis found that 5-HT3
antagonists effectively prevent postoperative
shivering after general anaesthesia and
spinal anaesthesia. We found no significant
difference between the efficacy of 5-HT3
antagonists and meperidine for the preven-
tion of shivering. However, our study had
some limitations. First, only 14 RCTs were
included. Second, a variety of 5-HT3 recep-
tor antagonists were used at different doses
and times in the experimental groups. These
factors may have introduced bias and
affected the reliability of our results.
Consequently, more rigorously designed,
detailed, high-quality RCTs are needed to
verify our conclusions.
