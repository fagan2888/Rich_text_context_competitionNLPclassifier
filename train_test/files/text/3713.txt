Male and Female Perception of Physical
Attractiveness: An Eye Movement Study
Ray Garza1, Roberto R. Heredia1, and Anna B. Cieslicka1
Abstract
Waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) and breast size are morphological traits that are associated with female attractiveness. Previous studies
using line drawings of women have shown that men across cultures rate low WHRs (0.6 and 0.7) as most attractive. In this study,
we used additional viewing measurements (i.e., first fixation duration and visual regressions) to measure visual attention and
record how long participants first focused on the female body and whether they regressed back to an area of interest. Addi-
tionally, we manipulated skin tone to determine whether they preferred light- or dark-skinned women. In two eye tracking
experiments, participants rated the attractiveness of female nude images varying in WHR (0.5­0.9), breast size, and skin tone. We
measured first fixation duration, gaze duration, and total time. The overall results of both studies revealed that visual attention fell
mostly on the face, the breasts, and the midriff of the female body, supporting the evolutionary view that reproductively relevant
regions of the female body are important to female attractiveness. Because the stimuli varied in skin tone and the participants
were mainly Hispanic of Mexican American descent, the findings from these studies also support a preference for low WHRs and
reproductively relevant regions of the female body.

Introduction
Physical characteristics (e.g., narrow waist, long legs, and
medium­large breasts) play an important role in determining
attractiveness and selecting a potential mate, particularly in
men's evaluations of women (Dixson, Grimshaw, Linklater,
& Dixon, 2010, 2011b; Singh, 1993; Singh & Young, 1995).
One of the most explored areas of research in judging attrac-
tiveness is the waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), or the size of a
woman's waist in relation to her hips, including her buttocks.
Studies show that women who have a low WHR are rated as
more attractive and have advantages associated with reproduc-
tive success (Moran et al., 1999; Singh, 1993, 2002; Singh &
Young, 1995; Van Hooff et al., 2000). Women with WHRs of
0.7 have been rated as being more attractive, in better health,
and of higher reproductive value (Singh, 1993; Singh & Young,
1995). This article examines male and female Mexican Amer-
ican perceptions of attractiveness using eye movements to
explore how this ethnic group might differ from others previ-
ously studied in the way it views attractiveness. Previous
research (Singh, 1993; Singh & Young, 1995; Marlowe, Api-
cella, & Reed, 2005) has traditionally used line drawings and
nonecologically valid images to assess female attractiveness.
More recently, research in this domain is beginning to use
technologically advanced empirical techniques, such as func-
tional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and eye tracking, to
accurately and objectively measure perceived female attraction
(Platek & Singh, 2010; Suschinsky, Elias, & Krupp, 2007). One
advantage of using eye movements to measure attractiveness is
that they provide objective and precise recordings of where and
when (in ms) a particular region of interest (ROI), such as the
breasts or the midriff, receives the most attention, using mul-
tiple indicators of eye movements as participants scan target
pictures.

Attraction and Mate Selection
Humans have evolved certain cognitive strategies or mental
shortcuts to aid in mate selection. These characteristics include
a dependence on certain morphological traits that are associ-
ated with fertility to determine whether an individual is attrac-
tive (e.g., narrow waist). If certain morphological traits are
associated with fertility and reproductive value in women, it
follows that men should have cognitive mechanisms that lead
them to find such features attractive. Singh and Young (1995)
proposed that men judge women to be most attractive within an
ideal range of WHRs. To evaluate male preference for lower
WHRs, Singh (1993) utilized line drawings exhibiting a range
of WHRs (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) to determine whether there was a
preference for specific waist characteristics. Findings revealed
that for all body types, the lowest WHR was rated as most
attractive. It is interesting to note that normal body types and
low WHRs were rated high in attractiveness, sexiness, good
health, and capacity for childbearing, all of which relate to
fertility. In a follow-up study, Singh and Young (1995) looked
at the WHR in relation to breast size and the role of both in
determining personal attributes and desirability for romantic
relationships. Singh and Young contend that in times of famine
and food shortages, women would have needed to store surplus
energy for successful reproduction, most notably in the gluteo-
femoral region and breast for milk production. This would have
resulted in men having an evolved preference for women who
exhibit lower WHRs and bigger breast size. Singh and Young
found out that low, rather than high, WHR did indeed play a
significant role in determining attractiveness, good health, fem-
inine features, kindness, and understanding. Women categor-
ized as having a high WHR were typically rated as less
attractive and older looking, an attribute not consistent with
reproductive success. Images that portrayed a low WHR and
larger breasts were rated as most attractive and youthful look-
ing, in keeping with attractiveness and reproductive success.
Moreover, fMRI findings (e.g., Platek & Singh, 2010) have
revealed that brain areas associated with reward processing and
decision making (e.g., the anterior paracingulate, nucleus
accumbens) become activated when men view images depict-
ing low WHRs.
Despite playing an important role in attractiveness, it is not
clear what importance breast size plays in sexual selection.
Breast size may indicate reproductive capability, with small
breasts being characteristic of a young, prepubescent girl, and
large breasts characteristic of an older, reproductively capable
woman (Singh & Young, 1995). Previous research by Singh
and Young found breast size to be an important contributor to
female attractiveness. In their study, breast size and WHRs
were used as predictors of attractiveness, health, femininity,
and kindness and understanding. They concluded that images
of slender women with large breasts were rated as most attrac-
tive. Additionally, images of plump women with large breasts
were rated as less attractive than images of slender women with
small or large breasts. In a follow-up experiment, Singh and
Young reported that female figures with large breasts and
narrow hips were rated as older than figures with small breasts
and narrow hips. It is important to note, however, that the
perception of increased age was more apparent when the fig-
ures had wide hips.
Another sexually dimorphic trait that is associated with sex-
ual selection is skin tone. Women are lighter skinned than men
in a wide range of human populations (Frost, 1988, 2007, 2008;
van den Berghe & Frost, 1986), even when one controls for
degree of sun exposure. Interestingly, skin tone becomes sexu-
ally dimorphic at puberty, when girls become lighter skinned
than boys. According to Mesa's (1983) study on Spanish
schoolchildren, skin color darkens progressively before pub-
erty and then lightens during adolescence, eventually forming
a stable sex difference in adulthood. This sex difference is most
pronounced in humans of medium skin color and seems to be
constrained in very dark- and very light-skinned humans. Sim-
ilar sex differences have been noted in hair color, which dar-
kens during adolescence in both sexes but more so in boys than
in girls (Leguebe & Twiesselmann, 1976; Steggerda, 1941; van
den Berghe & Frost, 1986). There are two main evolutionary
explanations for the sexually dimorphic nature of skin tone: (1)
skin tone is used as a signal of neoteny and (2) skin tone is used
as an indicator of fertility. Neotenous traits are associated with
childlike or juvenile characteristics, such as body fat, high-
pitched voice, and lighter skin. In women, a lighter skin tone
may be associated with what is known as infantile mimicry,
that is, these physical characteristics are said to serve as an
elicitor of male nurturance, similar to nurturance given to a
child (Frost, 1988, 2007, 2008, 2011; van den Berghe & Frost,
1986). A childlike appearance may also reduce aggressive male
feelings and hence the likelihood of aggressive behavior. Dif-
ferences in skin tone are also apparent in line with hormonal
changes in women. Skin tone can darken during pregnancy,
during the infertile phases of the menstrual cycle, and while
one is taking contraceptives (van den Berghe & Frost, 1986).
Skin tone, therefore, functions as a means of determining the
fecundability of women (i.e., lighter skin tone is associated
with greater reproductive potential). A cross-cultural study of
51 societies found that 47 showed a preference for the lighter
end of the locally represented spectrum of skin tones (van den
Berghe & Frost, 1986).
Ethnic Differences
Although previous studies have primarily focused on European
and European American men, research on other ethnic mino-
rities, such as Hispanics, who are the focus of this study, has not
been well documented. The ideal female body of Western cul-
tures (Singh & Luis, 1995) differs in some respects from that of
other cultures, particularly hunter gatherers. In examining eth-
nic differences in WHR, Singh's (1994) operating assumption
was that every culture has distinct characteristics in terms of
what they look for in the opposite sex. Marlowe, Apicella, and
Reed (2005) looked into WHR preferences among the Hazda
hunter gatherers of Tanzania using a frontal 2-D WHR and a
profile WHR, which is a 2-D photo showing the side view of an
2 Evolutionary Psychology
image where the waist and buttocks are more visible. The
results showed that Hazda men's WHR preferences for the
frontal images were similar to the choices made by European
American men. However, preference for higher WHRs was
seen in images that portrayed profile images. European Amer-
ican men preferred profile images with a 0.7 WHR, while
Hazda men preferred profile images with a 0.9 WHR (Marlowe
et al., 2005). In an extension of Marlowe et al.'s study, Swami,
Jones, Einon, and Furnham (2009) used British men who were
classified as being European Caucasian or of African descent.
They also used a sample of African men from Cape Town,
South Africa. The images used in this study were of women
of both ethnicities in a profile pose (side view). Swami et al.
(2009) found that South African men preferred high WHR
Black women with large breasts and high WHR White women
with small breasts. The British sample, on the other hand,
preferred high WHR Black women with small breasts and high
WHR women with large breasts. Thus, this pattern of results
seems to argue against low WHR preferences and suggests
cross-cultural differences. As for Hispanics, little is known
about their WHR preferences. By better understanding the pre-
ferences of a Hispanic population, we may better understand
how selection pressures have created cognitive strategies or
mental shortcuts for assessment of WHR.
Eye Movements and Attractiveness
Recently, researchers have been utilizing eye movements to
measure which features are used to assess attractiveness. Eye
movements or eye tracking methodology is a sensitive gaze-
contingency technique that measures real-time visual process-
ing. It provides a precise measurement of when and where
participants look without evoking a conscious response (i.e.,
without relying on the participant's explicit awareness). In a
typical eye movement study, participants are simply asked to
inspect a picture/image to determine whether it is attractive
(yes/no type of answer). For example, researchers might be
interested in the number of eye fixations or the amount of time
a person spends looking at a particular area of a target image.
Eye movements show that differences in the duration and num-
ber of fixations indicate interest in a specific region of the
target image (Balcetis & Dunning, 2006; Henderson, 2003;
Issacowitz, 2006; Rayner, 1998; Rizzo, Hurrig, & Damasio,
1987). Eye movements are important visual attention measure-
ments because where a person looks or fixates on indicates
the initial stage before the stimulus is processed and encoded
(Yantis, 2005). Moreover, attractiveness is a strong factor in
determining visual attention, as demonstrated in previous
research showing that (1) people focus more attention on rele-
vant versus irrelevant information (Suschinsky et al., 2007), (2)
infants gaze longer at attractive or familiar adults (Langlois
et al., 1987), and (3) men stare longer at attractive female faces
(Fink et al., 2008; Maner, DeWall, & Gailliot, 2008). Specifi-
cally, eye tracking studies show that people look longer at
images that portray the opposite sex and limit their viewing
of the face when the image contains erotic content (Lykins,
Meana, & Kambe, 2006; see also Rupp & Wallen, 2007). These
studies are consistent with eye tracking research, which shows
differences in visual attention to the female body and to spe-
cific ROIs.
What is the relationship between eye movements and WHR
research? In one of the first studies to use eye movements, Sus-
chinsky, Elias, and Krupp (2007) examined visual attention to
images of different female WHRs (0.68­0.85), and the partici-
pants were asked to rate the women's attractiveness. The results
showed that men directed most of their visual attention (i.e.,
fixations) to regions that were reproductively significant, such
as the breasts, the waist, and the hips. More importantly, women
with lower WHRs received the most visual attention, indicating
male interest in that particular region of the body. Moreover,
women with lower WHRs were also rated as the most attractive.
In a related study, Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, and Milt-
ner (2008) explored gender differences and gaze patterns of
participants who were looking at a male or female body. Parti-
cipants were exposed to images of fully clothed men and
women. Each image had the same posture, a similar clothing
style, and a similar size of body regions. Overall, findings
indicated that, when exposed to images of the opposite sex,
participants were more likely to rate them as attractive and
spent longer time viewing them. Men spent significantly more
time focusing on the breast area. Indeed, these patterns of
results are consistent with evolutionary strategies of mate
selection (Hewig, Trippe, Hecht, Straube, & Miltner, 2008) and
suggest that longer viewing time is associated with attraction.
Dural, Cetinkaya, and Gulbertekin (2008) presented male and
female participants with female images with altered overall
weight, which included underweight, normal-weight, and over-
weight individuals as well as varying WHRs (0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and
1.0). The attractiveness of each image was rated by measuring
eye fixations. The body was divided into three ROIs: the upper
trunk (e.g., the breasts), below the breasts to the waist, and the
hips to the feet. Analysis of eye fixations revealed significant sex
differences in attention to the region from below the breasts to
the waist and including the overall waist-to-hip area. Male par-
ticipants rated this region more attractive than the other ROIs
and spent more time looking at it. Dural et al. concluded that
WHR importance must be an evolved cognitive mechanism in
mate selection due to the overall gender differences, that is, male
participants rated the region from the breasts to the waist as the
most attractive region and gave it the most visual attention.
In a more recent study, Dixson, Grimshaw, Linklater, &
Dixon (2010) investigated how individuals viewed nude female
images as a function of WHR. The images were graphically
manipulated to represent WHRs of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9. The nude
image was divided into six anatomical ROIs: face, breasts,
waist, hips and thighs, genitals, and legs for the frontal pose.
The back pose was divided into the head, upper back, waist,
buttocks, rear thighs, and rear legs. Results showed that,
regardless of the frontal or rear poses, the midriff received the
most eye fixations and total time; that is, participants made
more visual fixations and spent the most time looking at the
waist area. Moreover, the images with the lowest WHR (0.7)
Garza et al. 3
were the ones that received the most first fixations on the
breasts. In other words, when shown a woman who exhibited
the lowest WHR, individuals first fixated on the breasts. It has
been argued that first fixations reflect automaticity, in that
individuals look at a specific area first without awareness,
before consciously focusing on other areas. For higher WHRs
(0.8 and 0.9), individuals fixated on the midriff more. Accord-
ingly, men will employ the WHR as a cognitive mechanism
filter in order to identify women who do not meet the percei-
ver's expectations of attractiveness and fertility. Men in the
Dixson et al.'s (2010) study may have automatically focused
on the woman's breast, as seen with WHRs of 0.7 and 0.9,
because the WHR preference was already met. This propensity
for men to look at the 0.7 WHR is known as the ``first pass
filter,'' and it tends to exclude women who are unhealthy or
have low reproductive value (Singh, 1993). Once WHRs higher
than 0.7 are filtered out, men will use other characteristics of
the female body (i.e., head, breasts, and skin tone) to determine
a final mate selection (Singh, 1993). Unfortunately, Dixson
et al. (2010) measured first fixations but not first fixation dura-
tion. By including this second measurement, we wish to find
out not only whether individuals look for a 0.7 WHR first but
also whether they are more interested in the breasts and the
midriff than in other regions of the body.
Present Study
The present study expands on Dixson et al. (2010) in three
important ways. (1) It includes first fixation duration, gaze
duration, and visual regressions. These additional visual mea-
surements will further explore the first pass filter by recording
automatic processing time (i.e., number of first fixations and
first fixation duration), time spent on an ROI (i.e., gaze dura-
tion), and whether individuals regress back to a specific ROI
(i.e., visual regressions). (2) This study measures attractiveness
ratings by using yes/no responses immediately after the image
is presented. This will give us an insight into the intuitive
judgments individuals make when looking at a female image
without having to spend a considerable amount of time using a
rating system that is time consuming and might discourage
``intuitive'' responses. (3) Furthermore, the experiment
described here looks at an understudied population and deter-
mines the extent to which previous findings can be generalized
to the Hispanic population. Additionally, the study examines
the gender differences that exist in visual attention. Previous
studies have primarily focused on male populations; therefore,
by using both men and women, we can provide further insights
into the question of whether visual attraction is a gender or a
general preference. The possibility that males spend a consid-
erable amount of time attending to specific areas of the body
when compared to females would further support the mate (i.e.,
male) selection preferences hypothesis. A finding that a low
WHR ratio is preferred, and that individuals focus on reproduc-
tively relevant regions, would further support the possibility
that cognitive strategies are used to assess the physical charac-
teristics that are sought for in women, primarily by male
participants. Therefore, in this study, we hypothesized the fol-
lowing: (1) as has been shown by Dixson et al. (2010, 2011b),
Singh (1993), Singh and Young (1995), and Suschinsky et al.
(2007), the areas of the breast and midriff will receive more
visual attention than other areas; (2) the lower the WHR, the
more attractive ratings it will receive; and (3) there will be
gender differences in the amount of visual attention displayed,
that is, men will spend longer time viewing the images than will
women.
Experiment 1
Material and Method
Participants
Participants were 54 (men ¼ 16 and women ¼ 38) Hispanic
students of Mexican American descent, ranging from 18­40
(M ¼ 23.70, SD ¼ 4.98) years of age recruited from the Texas
A and M International University (TAMIU) undergraduate pop-
ulation. Participants received class credit for their participation.
Materials
A color photograph taken from Dixson et al.'s (2010) study of a
nude woman facing forward was used and altered to meet the
required dimensions. Using Adobe Photoshop CS6, version
13.0.1.1, the image's waist and breast size were manipulated
by making either the waist or the breasts appear small, medium,
or large. A professional artist and expert in the Photoshop
software application performed the image alterations. A low
WHR image was made by digitally reducing the waist and a
high WHR image by expanding the waist. WHRs were oper-
ationally defined by a numerical ratio of 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9, by
dividing the waist of the image with the hips. As in Dixson
et al. (2011a) and Brown et al. (1999), breast sizes were oper-
ationally defined as small (80% of the original image), medium
(original breasts of the image), or large (120% of the original
image). In total, nine images exhibited different combinations
of waist and breast sizes, so that one image could have a small
waist-small breast, small waist-medium breast, or small waist-
large breast, and the sequence was continued for all of the
images. The ROIs were the six anatomical regions used in
Dixson et al's. (2011) study, which included the following:
(1) the face and neck, from the top of the head to the clavicle;
(2) the breasts, as measured from the clavicle to the border of
the bottom of the breasts; (3) the midriff, which included the
waist and extended from the bottom of the breasts to the widest
part of the hips; (4) the groin, which encompassed the area
showing pubic hair; (5) the thighs, beginning at the end of the
midriff border to the knee; and (6) the legs and feet, which were
the remaining portion of the female body. All images were
input into SR-Experiment Builder and modified to meet the
size requirements, so that they could be viewed clearly. Each
image in SR-Experiment Builder was 783 Â 1,599 pixels, and
the bit depth was set at 24. Additionally, we set ROIs for all of
4 Evolutionary Psychology
the images, so as to know specifically which part of the body
participants fixated on more.
Procedure
Upon arrival at the laboratory, participants completed a consent
form. They were then instructed to sit comfortably, so that they
were able to position their chin on a chinrest and maintain
stability. Visual calibrations were conducted to ensure that the
eye tracker was accurately recording the participants' eye
movements. The visual recording was monocular, that is, the
eye tracker recorded the movements of the right eye. The dis-
tance between the chinrest and the eye tracker was 55 cm.
Experimental stimuli were presented using SR-Experiment
Builder running on Windows OS 7, and the EyeLink 1000 eye
tracker was connected to a dedicated host computer running on
disk operating system.
Experimental instructions were presented on the computer
screen, and participants familiarized themselves with a Micro-
soft Sidewinder Plug and Play Gamepad used to rate image
attractiveness. Participants were instructed to use the left trig-
ger for ``not attractive'' and the right trigger for ``attractive.'' In
rating the images, participants were instructed to make an intui-
tive judgment. No time limit was set for the images. Before the
experimental images were shown, participants rated six pic-
tures as part of the practice block. A total of nine experimental
images were shown in each individual session, and the order of
the images was randomized for each experimental session.
In recording eye measurements, first eye fixation was deter-
mined by the first area (ROI) participants viewed. First fixation
duration was the amount of time participants focused first on a
specific ROI (head, breasts, midriff, groin, thighs, and legs/feet).
Gaze duration time was the entire time participants focused on a
specific ROI throughout the trial. The participant's total time
was measured by how long they viewed each image (i.e., the
overall duration of the trial). This was primarily done to measure
the effect that breast size and WHR manipulations had on view-
ing the entire image. Fixation count was determined by how
many visual fixations were recorded for a specific ROI. Finally,
regressions were operationalized as the number of times parti-
cipants returned to an ROI throughout a trial.
Results
Data from three participants were excluded because the eye
tracker camera was unable to record their eye movements due
to the type of corrective lenses they were using.
Attractiveness
WHR and breast size have both been used to determine a
woman's attractiveness. As in Singh (1993), Suchinsksy et al.
(2007), and Dixson et al. (2010), we first attempted to find a
relationship between breast size and attractiveness and between
WHR and attractiveness. Breast size, particularly large breasts,
has often been used as an indicator of female attractiveness
(Singh & Young, 1995). Previous research has also indicated
that a low WHR is considered more attractive and a preferred
characteristic in mate selection. A logistic regression using
WHRs (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) and breast size (small, medium, and
large) was performed to determine whether these dummy-
coded predictor variables would increase the likelihood of rat-
ing a female figure as more attractive (i.e., no/yes ratings and
dummy coded). Participants made intuitive judgments while
being visually recorded. Since past research has found that a
low WHR is associated with attractiveness, the highest WHR
(0.9) was used as a reference category. Because large breasts
are generally preferred, we used small breasts as a reference
category. The logistic regression was statistically significant,
w2(4) ¼ 186.555, p < .001. When the images portrayed a WHR
of 0.7 or 0.8, they were 4 times more likely to be rated as
attractive (see Table 1). When the images portrayed medium
or large breasts, they were more likely to be rated as attractive.
First Fixations
For all WHR images (0.7, 0.8, and 0.9), breasts received the
greatest number of first fixations, w2 ¼ 649.40, p < .001 (see
Table 2). We further examined whether the head, breasts, and
midriff ROIs were influenced by WHRs. Significant differ-
ences were revealed, in which the lower the WHR, the more
first fixations were noted on the head, w2 ¼ 27.81, p < .002. The
midriff also revealed differences, that is, first fixations
were recorded more on the midriff for the 0.9 WHR, w2 ¼
32.07, p < .001 than the 0.7 and 0.8 WHRs. The breasts did
not reveal significant differences in first fixations across

Data were submitted to a linear mixed-effects analysis using
IBM SPSS (Version 22), with items (images) and subjects
(participants) as random effects and gender, WHR, and ROIs
as fixed effects. The overall model conformed to a 2 (gender:
male vs. female) Â 3 (WHR: 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) Â 3 (breasts: small,

groin, legs/feet) mixed design. This basic design was used
throughout Experiments 1 and 2 to analyze the different eye
movement indexes.
First Fixation Duration
The results revealed a main effect of ROI, F(5, 1614.76) ¼
2.70, p < .01. As can be seen from Figure 1, participants' first
fixation duration was longer on the midriff than on the head,
t(658.31) ¼ 3.10, p ¼ .002, and the thighs, t(579.85) ¼ 2.35, p
¼ .01. There were no significant differences between the mid-
riff and the breasts, t(689.13) ¼ 1.28, p ¼ .20; the groin,
t(486.67) ¼ .98, p ¼ .32; and the legs/feet, t(397.33) ¼ .87,
p ¼ .38. This suggests that participants focused more of their
first fixation time on the midriff than on other regions of
the body. There was an interaction between ROI and gender,
F(5, 1613.47) ¼ 2.31, p < .05, suggesting that males spent
longer first fixation time duration on all ROIs, with the excep-
tion of the head region.
Gaze Duration
Gaze duration was measured by recording the average time
participants focused on a specific area throughout each trial.
There was a main effect for ROI, F(5, 1606.86) ¼ 38.58, p <
.001. Significant differences were noted between the breasts and
the midriff, t(690.60) ¼ 2.98, p < .01; the thighs, t(625.01) ¼
7.82, p < .001; the groin, t(543.88) ¼ 9.83, p < .001; and the legs/
feet, t(451.75) ¼ 5.08, p < .001. There was no significant
difference between the breasts and the head, t(700.30) ¼ .58,
p ¼ .56. There was an interaction between ROI and gender, F(5,
1605.56) ¼ 3.50, p < .01. Follow-up multiple comparisons
showed that men focused their visual attention on the breasts,
t(92.58) ¼ 3.51, p < .001, and the head, t(106.15) ¼ 2.60, p < .01,
more so than did women (see Figure 2). The other ROIs fol-
lowed the same pattern, with the exception of the legs; however,
these ROIs did not reach significance.
Total Time
Total time was the time spent on each image per trial. The only
significant main effect involved gender, F(1, 62.97) ¼ 10.76, p
< .01. The main effect revealed that men spent significantly
more time viewing the images than women, t(62) ¼ 3.24, p <
.001. Additionally, there was a three-way interaction between
WHR, breast size, and gender, F(10, 1597.51) ¼ 20.43, p <
.001. The interaction (see Figure 3) showed that men spent

more time looking at small breasts when the WHR was 0.7 or
0.8. In general, low to medium WHRs predicted longer total
times spent viewing small breasts.
Fixation Count
Fixation count was defined as the average number of fixations
made in each trial. There was a main effect for ROI, F(5,
1605.99) ¼ 44.81, p < .01, and an interaction between ROI
and gender, F(5, 1604.76) ¼ 2.97, p ¼ .01. Participants made
more fixations on the breasts than on the midriff, t(691.31) ¼
4.62, p < .001; the head, t(697.88) ¼ 2.62, p < .01; the thighs,
t(634.04) ¼ 7.53, p < .001; the groin, t(545.96) ¼ 10.72, p <
.001; and the legs/feet, t(452.42) ¼ 5.27, p < .001. The interac-
tion showed that, for all of the ROIs, men made more fixations
than women on all of the areas, with the exception of the legs/
feet. There was an additional interaction between WHR and
ROI, F(10, 1591.80) ¼ 2.91, p ¼ .01. For the 0.7 WHR, the
breasts received the highest number of fixations, significantly
more than the midriff, t(1584.78) ¼ 5.56, p < .001; the groin,
t(1588.19) ¼ 8.96, p < .001; the thighs, t(1591.42) ¼ 5.76, p <
.001; and the legs/feet, t(1625.78) ¼ 4.68, p < .001. The
breasts were not significantly fixated on more than the head,
t(1583.98) ¼ 1.80, p ¼ .07. For the 0.8 WHR, the breasts
received the highest number of fixations, significantly more than
the head, t(1586.51) ¼ 3.19, p < .01; the midriff, t(1587.23) ¼
4.19, p < .001; the groin, t(1592.94) ¼ 7.96, p < .001; the thighs,
t(1590.55) ¼ 5.96, p < .001; and the legs/feet, t(1596.79) ¼ 3.87,
p < .001. The 0.9 WHR produced the highest number of fixations
on the breasts, significantly more than on the groin, t(1591.80) ¼
7.24, p < .001; the thighs, t(1588.40) ¼ 6.00, p < .001; and the
legs/feet t(1596.55) ¼ 2.67, p < .01. The breasts were not sig-
nificantly fixated on more than the head, t(1588.40) ¼ 1.48, p ¼
.07, and the midriff t(1589.09) ¼ .50, p ¼ .62. Table 3 shows the
overall fixation counts by ROI and by WHR. Consistent with
Dixson et al.'s (2010), most of the visual fixations were centered
on the upper female body (head, breasts, and midriff), more
specifically on the breasts.
Visual Regressions
For eye regressions, the results yielded a significant main effect
for ROI, F(5, 1613) ¼ 8.95, p < .001. Participants tended to
regress back to an ROI associated with the upper body, such as
the head, the breasts, and the midriff. Participants made more
regressions toward the upper body than toward the lower body.
There was a significant three-way interaction between ROI,
WHR, and gender, F(25, 1587.03) ¼ 2.083, p ¼ .001. The
interaction showed that the lower the WHR (0.7), the more
visual regressions men made toward the upper body, as seen
in Figure 4.
Discussion
According to previous studies (Moran et al., 1999; Singh, 1993;
Singh & Young, 1995; 2002; Van Hooff et al., 2000), the lower
the WHR, the more attractive a woman will be rated. One
purpose of the present study was to investigate whether parti-
cipants would rate the lowest WHR as more attractive than
higher WHRs while viewing images that vary not only in WHR

but also in breast size. Past studies (e.g., Moran et al., 1999;
Singh, 2002; Van Hooff et al., 2000) utilized a rating scale with
multiple numerical options for the level of attractiveness. In this
experiment, the focus was on how intuitive these responses
would be while participants viewed images. This is why a binary
response (i.e., yes/no) was used to prevent participants from
spending too much time considering different possibilities and
instead encourage them to provide a fast and intuitive judgment.
As predicted, the lowest WHR (0.7) increased the likelihood of
rating the image as attractive, more so than the higher WHRs.
This was also seen with the 0.9 WHR. Breast size was varied as
well, with the medium and large breasts slightly increasing the
likelihood of rating the image as attractive. As with Dixson et al.
(2010), Suschinsky et al. (2007), and Brase and Walker (2004),
the lower the WHR, the higher was the attractiveness rating.
These results support the importance of the WHR in ratings of
attractiveness and extend this importance to a Hispanic popula-
tion of Mexican American descent, hence indicating that WHRs
are cross culturally used to assess attractiveness.
Another purpose of the present study was to determine
which regions of the female body received the most visual
attention. By using eye movements, we were able to determine
which areas were most important. During first fixations, parti-
cipants directed their attention toward the upper parts of the
body (i.e., head, breasts, and midriff), which are typically con-
sidered more reproductively relevant to male participants.
There were more first fixations directed toward the breasts than
toward the midriff, and these differences were significant for
WHRs of 0.7 and 0.8 but not for the 0.9 WHR. In short, the
present results replicated Dixson et al.'s (2010) findings when
the WHR was 0.7. Thus, based on first fixation counts, it
appears that the small and medium breasts attract the most
attention for all WHRs, except for the 0.9 WHR.
In addition, we measured first fixation duration, that is, the
length of time participants focused on the first area they
viewed. This measurement was not included in Dixson et al.
(2010). The results revealed that the midriff was the region of
the body that participants focused on the longest. To the best of
our knowledge, this measurement has never been utilized
before in this area of research. Although the breasts received
the most first fixations, the midriff received a longer duration
of first fixations. It can be argued that the number of first
fixations merely represents participants' scanning of the image,
while the duration of first fixations indicates the degree of
interest in a particular region. Thus, it may very well be the
case that first fixation duration is a reasonable indicator of the
first pass filter, or mental module, proposed by Singh (1993) as
a major determinant of preferences for low female WHRs.
To measure gaze duration, we recorded the amount of time
participants spent looking at a WHR image. As with Dixson
et al. (2010) and Suschinsky et al. (2007), participants viewed
the upper part of the female body longer than the lower parts.
This is consistent with evolutionary thinking that the upper
parts of the body are key to males in mate selection and attrac-
tiveness (Suschinsky et al., 2007). More specifically, the
breasts received the longest gaze duration and also showed the
greatest gender differences. Men spent significantly longer
time viewing each ROI, except for the feet. Other than the
effect of gender, these differences in gaze duration are consis-
tent with Dixson et al. (2010) for the ROIs. Overall, male
viewing times were more directed toward ROIs, whereas
women were more evenly distributed in their viewing times.
We wanted to determine whether manipulation of the WHR
would affect the total time spent viewing female images. Over-
all, male participants viewed the lowest WHR (0.7) longer than
the 0.8 and 0.9 WHRs. Moreover, in male participants, the 0.7
and 0.8 WHRs received the longest total time when paired with
small breasts. When the image had a 0.9 WHR, male participants
viewed the one with the largest breasts the longest. This is an
additional finding that, to the best of our knowledge, has not
been reported in the literature. Previous research has looked
mostly into overall ratings of attractiveness as a function of
WHR and breast size, and the eye tracking literature has focused
mostly on gaze duration and fixation count. These findings may
imply that WHR and breast size can be conflicting signals of
phenotypic quality, the outcome being longer decision times.
With regard to visual regressions or the likelihood of partici-
pants returning to a viewed ROI, the ROIs in the upper body
received the highest number of visual regressions for all three
WHRs. In particular, the lowest WHR produced the highest
number of regressions. This is a new finding, and the first time
that visual regressions have been considered in sexual attraction
research. More importantly, the visual regressions are consistent
with the importance of the upper body, which encompasses the
more reproductively relevant regions. Male participants looked
back the most at the upper body, most notably, the head and the
breasts, when the woman had a low WHR (0.7).
Low WHRs were rated as most attractive, and breast size did
not play a role in the attractiveness ratings. Overall, it was
apparent that participants focused most of their visual attention
on the upper female body. This is highlighted by our findings
from first fixations, first fixation duration, gaze duration, fixa-
tion count, and visual regressions. For measurements of total
time, fixation count, and visual regressions, the results indicate
the importance of low WHRs (0.7). Although participants did
look first at the breasts (i.e., first fixation), we believe that first
fixation duration should be considered more important because
it signifies degree of attention, instead of a visual scan. To
summarize the findings of Experiment 1, the lower the WHR,
the more attractive the female image seemed. We were also
able to confirm our hypothesis that visual attention would be
directed toward the breasts and the midriff, which are repro-
ductively relevant regions. Finally, gender differences were
observed as well, that is, men spent more time than did women
viewing images and viewing the ROIs.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 further manipulated WHR (0.5 and 0.6) and skin
tone (dark vs. light). This was done to further explore whether
using lower WHRs than what has been commonly used so far
(0.7, 0.8, 0.9, and 1.0) would significantly affect attractiveness

ratings. In previous studies (e.g., Frost, 1988, 2007, 2008,
2011; Swami, Furnham, & Joshi, 2008; van den Berghe &
Frost, 1986), participants found lighter-skinned women to be
more attractive. If skin tone plays a role in attractiveness, we
would expect dark and light complexions to be assessed differ-
ently, as shown by eye movements and attractiveness ratings.
Overall, we expected Experiment 2 to replicate and further
corroborate the results of Experiment 1. That is, the breasts
and the midriff should receive more visual attention than other
regions (e.g., thighs and feet).
Material and Method
Participants
Ninety-eight Hispanic students from Mexican American des-
cent (males ¼ 29 and females ¼ 69,) ranging from 18­40 (M ¼
22.40, SD ¼ 4.54) years of age participated in the experiment.
Participants were recruited from the TAMIU undergraduate
population. None of the participants from Experiment 2 took
part in Experiment 1.
Materials
Experimental materials were the same as in Experiment 1, with
the exception that the female image was modified to include 0.5
and 0.6 WHRs. In addition, skin tone was manipulated to create
a set of dark skin and light skin tone images. A total of 15 images
for each skin tone (i.e., dark vs. light) were created with five
different WHRs (i.e., 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) and three dif-
ferent breast sizes (i.e., small, medium, and large). A total of 30
images were used in the experiment. The attractiveness scale
was identical to the one used in Dixson et al. (2010). Attractive-
ness was measured on a 6-point Likert-type scale (1 ¼ unattrac-
tive, 2 ¼ slightly attractive, 3 ¼ moderately attractive, 4 ¼
attractive, 5 ¼ very attractive, and 6 ¼ extremely attractive).
Procedure
The eye tracking sessions followed the same procedure as in
Experiment 1. Immediately after completion of the experimental
session, participants proceeded to a second computer station to
rate the attractiveness of the female images they were exposed
to. Image presentation for the attractiveness-rating task was per-
formed on an Apple iMac computer, using PsyScope and ioLab
Systems USB Button Box. This task was randomly assigned, so
that participants received a set of 15 images that were either dark
skinned or light skinned. They were first given a practice trial of
three pictures to familiarize them with the task.
Results
Attractiveness
As in Experiment 1, attractiveness ratings using a dichotomous
variable were made as a function of WHR and breast size. Rat-
ings were performed as participants made intuitive judgments
while being visually recorded. The variables were dummy coded
for WHR (i.e., 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9), breast size (i.e., small,
medium, and large), and skin tone (i.e., dark and light). Attrac-
tiveness ratings were dummy coded as well. The logistic regres-
sion was significant, w2(6) ¼ 2,258.62, p < .001. Using the
highest WHR (0.9) as a reference category, participants who
viewed the 0.6 WHR were 15 times more likely to rate the image
as attractive. This was followed by the lowest WHR (0.5), for
which participants were 10 times more likely to rate the image as
attractive, then the 0.7 WHR (7 times more likely), and lastly the
0.8 WHR (2 times more likely). If we use the smallest breast size
as the reference category, medium breasts were almost 2 times
more likely to be rated as attractive (see Table 4).
Using the 6-point attractiveness Likert-type scale, a 2 (gen-
der: male vs. female) Â 2 (skin tone: dark vs. light) Â 3 (breasts:
small, medium, and large) Â 5 (WHR: 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9)
mixed design revealed a significant main effect for WHR, F(4,
1337.91) ¼ 269.09, p < .01. The lowest WHR (0.5) received the
highest rating of attractiveness; significantly higher than the 0.7
WHR, t(1337.90) ¼ 4.08, p < .001, 0.8, t(1337.90) ¼ 14.88, p <
.001, or the 0.9 WHR t(1337.90) ¼ 18.54, p < .001. The lowest
WHR (0.5) was not significantly different from the 0.6 WHR,
t(1337.90) ¼ .87, p ¼ .39. The main effect for breast size was
also significant, F(2, 1337.95) ¼ 19.82, p < .01. Images with
medium breast size were rated as more attractive than images
with small breast size, t(1337.98) ¼ 6.54, p < .001, and large
breast size, t(1337.93) ¼ 2.89, p < .01. There was a main effect
for gender, F(1, 80.96) ¼ 6.06, p ¼ .01. The images seemed more
attractive to men than to women, t(80.89) ¼ 2.46, p ¼ .01. There
was an interaction between gender and skin tone, F(1, 1459) ¼
5.25, p < .05. The dark-skinned images seemed more attractive to
men (M ¼ 3.31, SD ¼ 1.55 vs. M ¼ 2.62, SD ¼ 1.57) than to
women, t(79.87) ¼ 2.55, p < .05.Finally, the results indicated that
skin tone did not play a significant role in the overall ratings of
attractiveness, t(1457) ¼ .32, p ¼.74. Overall, we found that the
lowest WHR (0.5) and the images with medium breasts received
the highest ratings of attractiveness. Table 5 shows the mean
ratings of attractiveness on a Likert-type scale.

First Fixations
For all of the images (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9), significant
differences were observed for the first region fixated on, w2 ¼
10,219.02, p < .001 (see Table 6). The thighs were the region
participants first looked at, but the duration of first fixation on
the thighs was not affected by WHR, w2 ¼ 21.71, p ¼ .15. The
second region that received the most first fixations was the
groin. There were no significant differences between the
remaining ROIs and WHR, w2 ¼ 25.28, p ¼ .19. That is,
regardless of WHR, regions such as the head, the breasts,
the midriff, and the legs/feet received similar first fixations.
For all subsequent analyses, a 2 (gender) Â 2 (skin tone) Â 3
(breasts) Â 5 (WHR) Â 6 (ROI) mixed design was used to
analyze the participant's eye movements.
First Fixation Duration
The analysis revealed a significant main effect for ROI, F(5,
10858) ¼ 24.62, p < .01. The ROIs that received the longest
first fixation duration were the upper portion of the female
image, most notably the head, the breasts, and the midriff, as
seen in Figure 5. The breasts received longer first fixation
duration than did the midriff, t(4160.79) ¼ 4.88, p < .001; the
head, t(3987.04) ¼ 6.13, p < .001; the groin, t(4335.32) ¼ 8.59,
p < .001; the thighs, t(4951.92) ¼ 10.71, p < .001; and the legs/
feet t(2580.44) ¼ 3.12, p < .01. The results were similar to
Experiment 1, where the reproductively relevant regions (i.e.,
head, breasts, and midriff) received the longest first fixation
duration. However, in Experiment 2, the breasts specifically
received the longest duration. There were no significant differ-
ences for gender in first fixation duration.
Gaze Duration
In the gaze duration analysis, there was a main effect for ROIs,
F(5, 10882.19) ¼ 190.05, p < .01. Overall, fixations were lon-
ger for ROIs on the upper body than for those on the lower
body. Individuals fixated longer on the breasts than on the
midriff, t(4155.29) ¼ 5.80, p < .001; the head, t(3974.92) ¼
2.54, p < .01; the groin, t(4355.58) ¼ 11.18, p < .001; the
thighs, t(4959.06) ¼ 9.93, p < .001; and the legs/feet,
t(2563.10) ¼ 4.97, p < .001. There was a significant interaction
between ROI and gender, F(5, 10882.21) ¼ 5.89, p < .01.
This indicated that men in general spent more time than did
women on all the ROIs, with the exception of the legs/feet
(see Figure 6). Moreover, the head and the breasts received
the longest gaze duration. These findings replicate the gaze
duration time and differences recorded in Experiment 1.
Total Time
For total time, there were three main effects, gender, F(1,
95.44) ¼ 6.80, p < .01; breast size, F(2, 21.75) ¼ 9.03, p <
.01; and skin tone, F(1, 21.75) ¼ 19.91, p < .01. The main
effect for gender revealed that males spent longer total time
on the images than females, t(95.44) ¼ 2.61, p ¼ .01. The main
effect for breast size showed that large breasts received longer
total time than medium, t(89.95) ¼ 3.68, p < .01, and small
breasts, t(84.12) ¼ 3.52, p < .01. The main effect for skin tone
showed that light skin tone images received longer total time
than dark skin tone images, t(14.23) ¼ 4.38, p < .001. The main
effect for skin tone showed that, although attractiveness ratings
of skin tone have been reported in past studies (e.g., Frost,
1988, 2007, 2008, 2011; van den Berghe & Frost, 1986), visual
attention has not. This is a new finding that provides insight
into the amount of interest people may show when scanning
Table 5. Means (SD) of the Attractiveness Rating Scale.

visual images. The images with the light skin tone were viewed
longer than the images with the dark skin tone, t(6.93) ¼ 4.46, p
< .001. There was a three-way interaction between WHR,
breast size, and gender, F(2, 64.31) ¼ 5.33, p < .01. Men
viewed the images with the 0.7 WHR and small breasts longer
than women, as depicted in Figure 7. Female visual attention
was consistent across all WHRs and breast size, where males
showed the most difference in WHRs and breast size. Overall,
findings for total time were similar to those reported for Experi-
ment 1, in which men spent more time looking at all WHRs,
including the additional 0.5 and 0.6 WHRs.
Fixation Count
For fixation count, there was a main effect for ROIs, F(5,
10874.94) ¼ 255.63, p < .01. The breasts received a higher
number of fixations than the midriff, t(4151.68) ¼ 11.38, p <
.001; the head, t(3945.40) ¼ 5.63, p < .001; the groin,
t(4355.56) ¼ 20.98, p < .001; the thighs, t(4960.44) ¼ 15.94,
p < .001; and the legs/feet, t(2957.64) ¼ 12.30, p < .001. There
were interactions between ROI and gender, F(5, 10870.24) ¼
8.44, p < .01, and between ROI and WHR, F(20, 10832.40) ¼
2.82, p < .01. Men focused more than women on the breasts than
on the midriff, t(106.07) ¼ 2.29, p ¼ .02; the head, t(115.42) ¼
5.62, p < .001; the groin, t(110.59) ¼ 21.02, p < .001; the thighs,
t(105.58) ¼ 15.97, p <.001; and the legs/feet, t(290.89) ¼ 12.20,
p < .001. Table 7 shows mean fixation counts for the interaction
between WHR and ROI. Fixation counts for WHRs and ROIs
replicated findings from Experiment 1.
Visual Regressions
Visual regressions yielded a significant main effect for
ROIs, F(5, 10890.47) ¼ 100.32, p < .01. Participants made
most of their visual regressions toward the upper body and
the thighs. Most notably, the head and the breasts received
the highest number of visual regressions for all WHRs, as
seen in Figure 8. These differences were all significantly
different from each other (p < .01). In line with Experiment
1, most visual regressions focused on the upper female body
(i.e., head, breasts, and midriff).
A separate post hoc analysis was conducted in order to
determine differences between ratings of attractiveness and
visual measurements. The YES/NO responses were dummy
coded and entered as a predictor variable in the model. Sub-
sequently, first fixation duration, gaze duration, total time,
and fixation count were analyzed in a 2 (gender: male vs.
female) Â 2 (skin tone: dark vs. light) Â 2 (attractive: yes
vs. no) Â 3 (breasts: small, medium, large) Â 5 (WHR: 0.5,
0.6, 0.7, 0.8, 0.9) Â 6 (ROIs) mixed design. First fixation
duration showed no significant interaction between ROI and
attractiveness, F(5, 10809.82) ¼ 1.46, p ¼ .20. Gaze duration
showed a significant interaction between ROI and attractive-
ness, F(6, 10852.39) ¼ 2.20, p < .05. Pairwise comparisons
revealed that images rated as attractive had longer gaze
duration. In the total time analysis, there was an interaction
between WHR and attractiveness, F(4, 9943.38) ¼ 37.14,
p < .001. Pairwise comparisons showed that, for 0.5, 0.8, and
0.9 WHRs, individuals who rated pictures as attractive spent
more time viewing the image. This pattern was reversed for
the 0.6 WHR. When participants rated the image as

unattractive, their viewing time was longer than when they
rated the image as attractive. For the 0.7 WHR, total viewing
time did not differ significantly between participants who
rated the image as attractive and those who did not (p ¼
.78). Additionally, there was a significant three-way inter-
action between WHR, skin tone, and attractiveness rating,
F(2, 10815.28) ¼ 5.44, p < .01. Light skin tone images that
were rated as attractive were looked at longer (see Figure 9).

tiveness, F(6, 10467.95) ¼ 3.55, p < .01. For all ROIs, parti-
cipants who rated the image as attractive made more visual
fixations on that image; however, there were no gender
differences.
Discussion
In Experiment 2, our main goal was to determine whether
lower WHRs (0.5 and 0.6) than in Experiment 1 would produce
similar findings. Previous studies (Dixson et al., 2010; Henss,
2000; Singh, 1993, 2002; Singh & Young, 1995; Suschinsky
et al., 2007) typically used 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9 WHRs and found
that the lower the WHR, the more attractive the women would
be rated. Additionally, we altered the image's skin tone to
determine whether skin tone played any role in attractiveness
and in visual attention.
As in Experiment 1, we found that participants' intuitive
judgments of attractiveness were inversely related to WHR.
That is, the lower the WHR, the more likely participants rated
the image as attractive. As a methodological issue, we wanted
to compare the YES/NO scale used in the experiment with the
more commonly used 6-point Likert-type scale of attractive-
ness. Our results showed that the YES/NO responses were
identical to those produced with the attractiveness scale used
by Dixson et al. (2010).
Using the attractiveness scale, we also wanted to determine
whether waist size, breast size, and skin tone were associated
with attractiveness. For waist size, the image with the lowest
WHR (0.5) received the highest rating of attractiveness. This
study is one of the first to indicate that the 0.5 WHR is rated
highly on the attractiveness scale. For breast size, the image
with medium breasts received the highest rating of attractive-
ness. In contrast to Singh (1993), large breasts did not receive

the highest rating of attractiveness. Moreover, men were more
likely than women to give female images higher ratings of
attractiveness. Another important finding was that, unlike other
findings (e.g., Swami et al., 2008), we did not find an overall
significant relationship between attractiveness ratings and skin
tone. However, when breaking the results down by gender, we
found that darker-skinned women seemed more attractive to
men than to women.
The eye movement results of Experiment 2 replicated those
of Experiment 1, with the exception of the first fixation results.
First fixations were directed toward the thighs, as opposed to
the breasts (as in Experiment 1). This could be accounted for by
the different WHRs that were used, the thighs (including the
buttocks) being more noticeable. However, first fixation dura-
tion was identical in the two experiments. As in the first experi-
ment, participants spent more time viewing the breasts and the
midriff. This finding supports Singh (1993) in his notion of a
first pass filter, that is, unconsciously, men will use the waist
area as a measure of attractiveness. Gaze duration revealed
similar patterns. The ROIs that received the most visual atten-
tion were the reproductively relevant ones, most notably the
head, the breasts, and the midriff. This difference was more
pronounced in men. This same pattern was reported in the first
experiment. Specifically, men showed more interest in all the
areas of the female body, with the exception of the feet. The
upper parts of the body are often physical cues for mate selec-
tion; therefore, the time spent looking at the upper body dif-
fered significantly from the time spent looking at the lower
body.
Total time data replicated the results found in Experiment 1
when looking at gender differences. Men spent more time
viewing the breasts of the female when the WHR was 0.7. Total
time results also showed that men spent significantly more time
viewing the image than did women. Although participants did
not rate the light skin tone as more attractive than the dark one
on the Likert-type scale, they spent significantly greater time
viewing the light-skinned images than the dark-skinned ones
when making the intuitive attractiveness response (i.e., YES/
NO). This suggests greater visual interest in the images with
lighter skin. Previous research (Frost, 1988, 2007, 2008, 2011;
van den Berghe & Frost, 1986) has suggested that lighter skin is
a preferred attribute of women in many societies, and female
skin tone changes in many ways that may explain this increase
in attention. First, girls lighten in skin tone during adolescence
much more than do boys, at a time of increasing reproductive
capability. Also, skin tone is a neotenous trait, that is, lighter
skin is one of several childlike characteristics that the female
body seems to mimic, possibly to foster male nurturance and to
decrease male aggressiveness (Frost, 1988, 2007, 2008, 2011;
van den Berghe & Frost, 1986).
Finally, as in Experiment 1, fixation count and regressions
were similar. Participants made more visual fixations on the
upper body, most notably the breasts, the head, and the midriff.
In terms of visual regressions, participants regressed to the
upper body after first viewing the images. These visual regres-
sions are consistent with the data from Experiment 1 and
highlight the postautomatic response of visual interest, suggest-
ing that the reproductively relevant regions are given a higher
rating of attractiveness. In a separate post hoc analysis, we used
attractiveness as a predictor to determine whether participants
would spend more time viewing the female image rated as
more attractive. We found significant interactions between
attractiveness and gaze duration, in the sense that participants
who rated the image as attractive had longer gaze duration time
for all ROIs. Additionally, attractiveness was related to longer
total time spent viewing images with WHRs of 0.5, 0.8, and
0.9. Interestingly, the image that was rated as attractive had
more fixation counts for all ROIs. With this analysis, we can
specifically show that eye movements differ as a function of
attractiveness.
General Discussion
The purpose of the two experiments reported here was to
explore attractiveness by measuring eye movements while par-
ticipants viewed nude female images with different WHRs,
breast sizes, and skin tones. To our knowledge, this is one of
the most complete studies of attractiveness with a predomi-
nantly Hispanic population. By using eye movements, we
could specifically measure visual attention in relation to WHR,
ROI, gender, and skin tone.
Both experiments revealed similar findings and, in addition,
replicated previous studies (e.g., Dixson et al., 2010, 2011b;
Hewig et al., 2008; Suschinsky et al., 2007). When we mea-
sured first fixation duration, gaze duration, total time, fixation
count, and visual regressions, participants were more likely to
focus most of their visual attention on the upper part of the
woman's body. This is in line with what Suschinsky et al.
(2007) referred to as the reproductively relevant regions, par-
ticularly for men. This study also supported the theoretical
notion, which Singh (1993) referred to as the first pass filter,
that visual attention should focus on the waist (i.e., the midriff).
Also related to Singh's research, we found that breast size did
play a minor role in judging whether a female figure is attrac-
tive; however, waist size contributed a more significant role.
Additionally, when looking at skin tone, we find that our results
corroborate Frost's extensive work on skin tone and attractive-
ness. Participants were more likely to view a female image
longer if the skin tone was light, rather than dark.
The results of both experiments add to the existing literature
on attractiveness, eye tracking, and ethnic differences. In this
study, we did not see any major differences from previous
research that focused primarily on European American popula-
tions. It appears that Hispanics of Mexican American descent
prefer low WHRs, as do other ethnicities. In addition, our
results indicate the importance of a more diverse selection of
WHRs (0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8, and 0.9) as a means to examine the
differences that may exist with lower WHRs. In this study,
images with lower WHRs (0.5, 0.6, and 0.7) had identical
attractiveness ratings and total gaze time. We also found that
breast size was not necessarily a consistent variable in attrac-
tiveness and visual measurements. Breast size slightly
Garza et al. 13
increased the likelihood of rating the female image as attrac-
tive, and yet breasts overall received most of the visual atten-
tion. Participants focused most of their attention on smaller
breasts in the first experiment and on large breasts in the sec-
ond. Therefore, we cannot conclude that breast size directly
affects either the attractiveness ratings or visual attention mea-
sures. This is in contrast to Dixson et al.'s (2011a) study, where
the amount of visual attention did not differ with breast size.
To summarize, the results of both studies contribute three
new findings to the field of human attractiveness. First, attrac-
tiveness varies over a short period of time, while one is viewing
an image of a woman. This may indicate that the upper female
body is considered more attractive than the lower female body,
as was shown in both experiments. A mental algorithm seems
to focus attention on one physical characteristic and then on
another. In this sequence of events, evaluation of one charac-
teristic has an impact on evaluation of succeeding characteris-
tics. Interest in the midriff, as measured by first fixation
duration, seems to function as a first pass filter that precedes
evaluation of other characteristics, or specific regions of the
female body that have been considered important in sexual
selection. Moreover, when individuals focused on specific
regions of the body, they tended to return to the ones they
focused on the most. Second, this study shows the importance
of additional measurements (e.g., first fixation duration and
regressions) to accurately and precisely measure attractiveness.
Eye movements provide a ``true'' measure because they reflect
ongoing mental processes in real time, whereas ratings are
typically ``post hoc'' processes that rely more on problem-
solving strategies. The rating process may misrepresent what
participants actually prefer or wish, since it requires additional
mental processes. By using eye tracking, we can specifically
measure what participants are most interested in. This was
apparent in measurement of skin tone preferences: Attractive-
ness ratings did not differ overall, with the exception of gender
differences, yet light-skinned images were viewed longer than
dark-skinned images. Lastly, the results of the present study
suggest gender differences in terms of attraction when viewing
a female's physical structure. The overall results provide fur-
ther evidence that males favor certain regions (e.g., breasts and
midriff) and spend significantly more time viewing the female
body. Therefore, the way one views the female body is specif-
ically determined by the physical characteristics that aid in
mate selection.
These findings have led to a number of suggestions for
future research. Studies of WHRs and attractiveness using eye
tracking methodology might consider a wider array of mea-
surements, such as those employed in the experiments
described here. In previous studies, first fixation count was
used to measure automatic processing and thus immediate
interest in a specific body region. The present study shows that,
in addition to first fixation count, first fixation duration should
be used as an index of immediate visual interest. In both experi-
ments, first fixation duration was a more consistent measure-
ment than first fixation count. First fixation duration can
provide greater insight into the amount of attention people
devote to a specific body region. In contrast, first fixation count
could indicate visual scanning, rather than degree of interest.
We also suggest using attractiveness as a predictor variable to
determine whether people spend longer times looking at
images they rate as attractive than at those they rate as unat-
tractive. This study is the first to look at these perceived dif-
ferences between viewing times and attractiveness ratings.
Future research might also consider whether eye tracking and
image rating measure different levels of attraction. It may be
that rating of images or figures on the traditional Likert-type
scale would tap into erotic attraction, whereas eye tracking
would measure attraction in general.
To conclude, we would like to address the following meth-
odological issues that might be improved for future research. In
both studies, there were more women than men in our sample
size. The reason for using both genders in the study was to
primarily focus on visual attention and attraction. Since the
image was nude, and there were differences in gender visual
attention, it can be argued that male visual attention was
focused more on sexual attraction. That is, although there were
similarities in visual patterns (i.e., first fixation duration, gaze
duration, fixation count, and regressions), overall men spent
more time on those areas than females, supporting the evolu-
tionary theory of mate selection. Any reference to mate selec-
tion and reproductive relevance was distinctively associated
with our male sample size. Even when using more males, as
in the second experiment, the results were similar to the first,
and it was shown that men spent more time on images and
specific areas (e.g., breasts and midriff) of the body than
women. Future research exploring mate selection or reproduc-
tive relevance could focus specifically on a male population.
Another limitation of the present study was the stimuli that
were used. The image taken from Dixson et al. (2010) may not
capture a representative cross section of women's torsos (i.e.,
include more than one image exhibiting various poses).
Research in this field could benefit from using different photos'
of females, such as nude versus clothed females to compare
whether the pattern of visual attention is solely for nude
females, or for females in general, and to experimentally
manipulate visual attraction versus sexual attraction, where
clothed may represent visual attraction and nude sexual attrac-
tion. Additionally, the experimental image used exhibited
pubic hair in the groin area of the body. Since it has become
fashionable for women to remove pubic hair, it might have
served as a distracting stimulus. However, our results did not
reveal significant fixation or attention displayed to this ROI.
Future research using similar stimuli might wish to consider
removing potentially distracting stimulus.
