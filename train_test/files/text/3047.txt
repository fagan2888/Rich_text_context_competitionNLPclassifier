U.S. Adults

Past weight or patterns of weight change may be more impor­ tant to chronic disease risk than current weight. Self-reports, however, are often the only source of information about past body weight. To date, very few studies have examined factors affecting the validity of self-reported past body weight. We examined the validity of self-reported past body weights of 1,931 U.S. adults who were participants in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1971-1975) and were interviewed again in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study (1982- 1984). We compared the body weight measured during the initial examination (1971- 1975) with the recalled 1971-1975 body weight reported during the follow-up interview (1982-

1984). Recalled past weight was strongly correlated with pre­ viously measured weight (r = 0.73 for men, and r = 0.74 for women). Men overestimated their past body weight, whereas women underestimated thei r past weight. Although 39% of men and 41% of women estimated their past weight within 5 pounds, approximately 17% of women and 10% of men un­ derestimated their past weight more than 15 pounds. Accuracy of reporting was influenced by sex, race, current body mass index, and the amount of weight gained over the 10 years following the initial examination. These factors should be considered when using recalled weight in epidemiologic studies. (Epidemiology 1995;6:61-66)

  Overweight is an important risk factor for many chronic diseases, including coronary heart disease, cere­ brovascular disease, diabetes, and certain cancers.1  One of the problems in examining body weight as a risk factor for chronic disease is the apparent latency of its effect on disease development.2 Th erefore, current weight often may not be as important to disease risk as is either past weight or patterns of weight change.3·4 In many epide­ miologic studies, the only feasible source of information about past body weight is from self-reports.56
  Although the validity of self-reported current body weight has been extensively studied,-7 14 few studies have examined the validity of self-reported past body weight.JS-IS Studies have found high to moderate corre­
lations between recalled and previously measured weight when recalled 18 years (r = 0.87) and 40 years (r = 0.95) later15; 4 years (r = 0.94) and 28 years (r = 0.82) later16; 53-66 years (r = 0.64 for males, and r = 0.84 for females) later17; and 20 years (r = 0.80) later.18 It has

been reported that women are more likely to underesti­ mate their past weight.1516 Accuracy of reporting has also been found to be influenced by race,16 education,,1516 current body mass index,1516 and, in some cases, adoles­ cent weight.17
  The purpose of this study is to examine the factors that might affect the validity of recalled past body weight in a nationally representative cohort of U.S. adults.


Methods
  Data used for this study are from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Fol­ low-up Study (NHEFS), conducted by the Nationa l Center for Health Statistics between 1982 and  1984. The National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur­ vey I Epidemiologic Follow-up Study is a national fol­ low-up study of persons who participated in the First National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES I) conducted in 1971-1975. Between 1982 and 1984, an attempt was made to follow up the 14,407 adults who were age 25-74 years at the time of partici­ pation in the NHANES I. Of this  number,  11,296 (78%) participants were found to be alive, and 10,523 (93%) were interviewed in person. The average time between the baseline examination and the follow-up interview was 10.2 years. Details of the sample selection and examination methodology have been published.19

  Questions asked during the follow-up interview (1982-1984) concerning past weights included: "What was your usual weight at age 25?" "What was your usual weight at age 40?" and "What was your usual weight at age 65?" Therefore, although both recalled weight and baseline measured weight were available for most per­ sons in the cohort, recalled weight was directly compa­ rable with measured weight only for those persons who were ages 25, 40, or 65 years at the baseline examina­ tion. Nevertheless, we included persons in our analysis
who were within 1 year of these ages to  increase  the study size (N = 2,094). We excluded those who indi­ cated their race was other than white or black (N = 21) and women who were pregnant (N = 20). Persons who
had missing data for education, baseline weight, recalled weight, or follow-up weight (1982-1984) or  whose weight was greater than 300 pounds at follow-up (max­ imum scale capacity) were also excluded from the study
(N  =  122).  The  final  sample  included  1,931 persons:
702 men and  1,229 women;  560 age  25-26  years,  717
age 39-41 years, and 654 age 64-66 years.
  In NHANES I, participants were measured in dispos­ able paper examination gowns and foam rubber slippers, using a Toledo self-balancing scale.20 In the 1982-1984 examination, participants were weighed in their homes in street clothes without shoes, using spring-type bath­ room weighing scales. To adjust the 1982-1984 weight for indoor clothing, we subtracted 1.6 kg from the mea­ sured weight.21

DEFINITION OF VARIABLES
  We defined weight recall error in this study as the self-reported past body weight minus the body weight

measured at baseline in 1971-1975. Weight recall error was divided into five categories: underestimated past weight by 15 or more pounds, underestimated by more than 5 but less than 15 pounds, estimated within 5 pounds, overestimated by more than 5 but less than 15 pounds, and overestimated by 15 or more pounds. We defined measured weight change as the 1982-1984 mea­ sured body weight minus the 1971-1975 measured body weight. We defined recalled weight change as the self­ reported 1982-1984 weight minus the recalled 1971- 1975 weight. Both measured and recalled weight change were stratified into the same five categories as weight recall error.
We calculated current body mass index [BMI; weight
(kg) per height (m)2] by using the subjects' 1982-1984 measured weight and baseline height measurements (height was not remeasured at the follow-up examina­ tion). We divided current BMI into three categories (<25, 25-30, and >30). We also stratified education level, as reported at baseline, into three levels: less than
high school, completed high school, and some college or technical school. We used hospitalization in the 2 years before the follow-up assessment (as verified by hospital records) as an indicator of recent illness.


STATISTICAL METHODS
  We calculated crude mean recall error by age, sex, race, education, current BMI, measured weight change status, and recent hospitalization using stratified univa­ riate analysis. Since univariate analyses revealed major differences in recall error by sex and age, we stratified all further analyses by sex and age. We assessed the associ-

BMI, measured weight change, recent hospitalization, and elapsed time in months between each subject's base­ line examination and follow-up interview. Because body weight change may also be a factor of interest in epide­ miologic studies, we examined the agreement between categories of weight change based on recalled past body weight and weight change based on measured body weight using the kappa statistic .23

Results
  The final sample of 702 men and 1,229 women was 87% white and 13% black (Table 1). A majority had a high school education or some college and a BMI under 30, and only a small percentage had been recently hos­ pitalized. Of those who were 25 or 40 years of age at baseline, a larger percentage had gained more than 5 pounds at follow-up than had remained stable or lost weight, whereas a larger percentage of those who were age 65 at baseline had lost weigh t.

WEIGHT RECALL ERROR
  Recalled past weight was strongly correlated with measured  past weight  in both men and women (Spear­
man r = 0.73 and 0.74, respectively). Women and older

weight to a greater degree than any of the other race-sex groups. Current BMI and measured weight change were associated with recall error in both sexes. Persons with a higher current BMI tended to underestimate their past weight more than did those with a lower BMI. Men with a current BMI under 25 overestimated their past weight, whereas those with a current BMI over 30 underesti­ mated their past weight. Although all groups of women underestimated their past weight, the degree of under­ estimation increased as current BMI increased. Both men and women who had lost weight since baseline tended to underestimate their past weight more than did those whose weight had been stable or who had gained weight . In each age category, men who had gained weight overestimated their past weight . Women age 65 at baseline who had gained weight also overestimated their past weigh t.
  Education was not associated with weight recall error in any of the age-sex groups. Hospita lization in the past 2 years was also not consistently associated with weight recall error in men, but women age 25 at baseline who had been hospitalized in the 2 years before the follow-up interview underestimated their past weight more than women who had not been hospitalized .

 Each value is adjusted for all other variables in the table by analysis of covariance.
t A negative recall error indicates underestimation of past weight, and a positive recall error indicates overestimation of past weight.
:j: The age categories at baseline represent ages 25 (24-26), 40 (39-41), and 65 (64-66) years.




39% of men and 41% of women across all baseline age categories were able to estimate their past weight within 5 pounds (Table 3). About 80% of men and 78% of women were able to estimate their past weight within 15 pounds. A greater percentage of women than men, how­ ever, underestimated their past weight by more than 15 pounds (approximately 17% of women vs 10% of men) .

WEIGHT CHANGE
  We examined the agreement between recalled weight change and measured weight change for each age group. Because the pattern was similar, the weight change findings are presented for all ages combined (Table 4). Of those men and women whose recalled weight re­ flected a weight loss greater than 15 pounds, 42% of men and 32% of women actually experienced this degree of weight loss (as determined by measured weights). Re­ porting was more accurate for those whose recalled weight change was more than 15 pounds, among whom 58% of men and 57% of women had actually gained this amount of weight. Overall, agreement between mea­ sured weight change and weight change based on re­
called weight was substantially better than expected by chance (kappa = 0.27).
Discussion
  In  the  present  study,  we found a strong correlation
between recalled baseline weight and measured baseline weight (r = 0.73 and 0.74 for men and women, respec­ tively) that was similar to that found by Rhoads and
Kagan 18 in men ofJapanese ancestry who participated in the Honolulu Heart Study (r = 0.80). The correlation, however, was not as strong as that found by others. 1-5 17
The slightly weaker correlations may be due to the more heterogeneous sample in our study.
  This investigation showed that although people were generally able to estimate accurately what they had weighed 10 years earlier, the accuracy of recalled weight was influenced by sex, race, current BMI, and weight change. Blacks and women underestimated their past weight to a greater degree than did whites and men.

Stevens et al16 have also reported a slightly greater un­ derestimation of past body weight by black women. The findings of our study also agree with those of Casey et al,15 who presented data from the Harvard Longitudinal Studies of Child Health and Development. In the study by Casey et al, men and women reported their current weight equally accurately; however, women were slightly more likely to underestimate their past weight.
  In the present study, the relation between current body size and recall error of past weight is similar to what others have found for errors in reporting  current weight.-7 14 We found that both men and women with high current BMI underestimated their past weight to a greater degree than did others. Men in the lowest cur­ rent BMI category (BMI under 25) actually tended to overestimate their past weight. Stevens et al16 also found that a higher current BMI was associated with underes­ timation of past weight, whereas a lower current BMI was associated with overestimation of past weight. In contrast to our findings and those of Stevens et al,16 Casey et al15 reported that men with a higher BMI at age 50 overestimated past body weight, but no such associ­ ation was found in women. Must et al17 found no sub­ stantial difference in recall error of past weight accord­ ing to adult weight; however, women who were obese in adolescence underestimated their adolescent weight. In that same study, males who were lean in adolescence overestimated their adolescent weight.
  Our findings showed that the accuracy of recall of past weight was not influenced by education. Stevens et al,16 however, found that education was inversely associated with recall error in participants in the Charleston Heart Study, and Casey et al15 reported that the accuracy of recalled weights was influenced by education in men but not in women.
  Because weight change is common 24 and may be as­ sociated with coronary heart disease,3 self-reported past body weight  may be a more useful indicator of weight as  a risk factor for chronic disease in retrospective and case-control studies than is current weight. Our study indicates that about 80% of adults are able to estimate

their body weights 10 years in the past within 15 pounds of their true past weight. An important question  is whether misclassification of 15 pounds or more in the remaining 20% of adults would lead to substantial bias in the relation between body weight and disease. For men and women of average height in the U.S. (5  feet  10 inches and 5 feet 4 inches, respectively) 15 pounds  is equal to about 2.5 BMI units. Studies of body weight and mortality, for example, often categorize body weight into I- to 3-BMI unit intervals.25 Thus, if such studies used self-reported past body weight as an exposure, it is likely that some misclassification ofBMI category would occur. If such misclassification is unrelated to  both  mortality and mortality risk factors, then it is likely that the effect estimates of the association between weight and mortal­ ity would be biased toward no association. On the other hand, if poor reporters of past weight are more likely to  die (for example, obese persons), then this could lead to differential misclassification. To answer the question of bias directly, a study is required in which both measured past body weight and self-reported past body weight are related to disease outcome.
  One of the limitations of the current study is the lack of adequate data to assess the interactive effects of fac­ tors within subgroups (for example, the study size was too small to assess the effects of BMI or weight change on recall error in blacks). To increase our study size, we included participants who were not exactly age 25, 40, or 65, but within 1 year of these ages at baseline. It is possible that some of the recall error could be attribut­ able to actual weight fluctuations within the 1-year period, but we believe this possibility to be unlikely, since, when only those participants who were exactly 25, 40, and 65 years of age were included in the analysis, the recall error was similar (data not shown). In our study, recall of past body weight was elicited by simple ques­ tions about weight at specific ages. The accuracy of recall of past body weight could probably be enhanced in future studies by the use of cognitive techniques to facilitate memory of events at specific ages.26 Finally, in our study design, the analysis was restricted to partici-



pants within 1 year of ages 25, 40, and 65 years. Because the levels of misclassification of past body weight are fairly similar across these age groups, we believe that our results are generalizable across adulthood. On the other hand, we did not examine the validity of  self-reported past weights in the elderly. Thus, we are unable to extrapolate our findings to persons considerably  above age 65 years.
  The majority of people seem to be able to recall body weights from about 10 years in the past with enough accuracy to be of use in epidemiologic studies. Never­ theless, sex, race, current body size (BMI), and weight change over time may be important determinants of the accuracy of recalled past body weight . Because these factors are also important determinants of health out­ come, it would be advisable to adjust for them  when using self-reported past body weights in epidemiologic studies and to consider these  biases in the  interpretation of the data.
