IMPORTANCE Significant progress has been made in reducing the prevalence of tobacco use
in the United States. However, tobacco cessation efforts have focused on the general
population rather than individuals with mental illness, who demonstrate greater rates of
tobacco use and nicotine dependence.
OBJECTIVES To assess whether declines in tobacco use have been realized among individuals
with mental illness and examine the association between mental health treatment and
smoking cessation.
DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Use of nationally representative surveys of
noninstitutionalized US residents to compare trends in smoking rates between adults with
and without mental illness and across multiple disorders (2004-2011 Medical Expenditure
Panel Survey [MEPS]) and to compare rates of smoking cessation among adults with mental
illness who did and did not receive mental health treatment (2009-2011 National Survey of
Drug Use and Health [NSDUH]).The MEPS sample included 32 156 respondents with mental
illness (operationalized as reporting severe psychological distress, probable depression, or
receiving treatment for mental illness) and 133 113 without mental illness. The NSDUH sample
included 14 057 lifetime smokers with mental illness.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES Current smoking status (primary analysis; MEPS sample)
and smoking cessation, operationalized as a lifetime smoker who did not smoke in the last 30
days (secondary analysis; NSDUH sample).
RESULTS Adjusted smoking rates declined significantly among individuals without mental
illness (19.2% [95% CI, 18.7-19.7%] to 16.5% [95% CI, 16.0%-17.0%]; P < .001) but changed
only slightly among those with mental illness (25.3% [95% CI, 24.2%-26.3%] to 24.9% [95%
CI, 23.8%- 26.0%]; P = .50), a significant difference in difference of 2.3% (95% CI,
0.7%-3.9%) (P = .005). Individuals with mental illness who received mental health treatment
within the previous year were more likely to have quit smoking (37.2% [95% CI,
35.1%-39.4%]) than those not receiving treatment (33.1% [95% CI, 31.5%-34.7%]) (P = .005).
CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Between 2004 and 2011, the decline in smoking among
individuals with mental illness was significantly less than among those without mental illness,
although quit rates were greater among those receiving mental health treatment. This
suggests that tobacco control policies and cessation interventions targeting the general
population have not worked as effectively for persons with mental illness.

Despite significant progress made in reducing tobacco
use within the general population, individuals with
mental illness smoke at rates approximately twice that
of adults without mental disorders1,2 and comprise more than
half of nicotine-dependent smokers.2,3 Smoking rates are even
higher among individuals with multiple lifetime psychiatric
diagnoses,2 schizophrenia,4 andotherseverementalillnesses.5
Mental illness is associated with higher levels of nicotine de-
pendence,intensityofsmoking,andsmokingseverity(ie,num-
berofcigarettes/wk)6 andwithlesssuccessinquitting.2,7 Smok-
ing is believed to account for the majority of excess mortality
among individuals with serious mental illness,8 and life ex-
pectancy among people with severe mental illness is 25 years
less than that among the general population.9
Recent studies suggest that smokers with mental illness
are highly motivated to quit10 and may do so without aggra-
vating psychiatric symptoms if provided with appropriate
support.11 Evidence-based tobacco cessation modules and in-
terventions that integrate mental health and substance abuse
treatment12,13 are now readily available and well suited to be
integrated into psychotherapy.14 However, it is rare for behav-
ioral health specialists to incorporate behavioral interven-
tions or pharmacological treatments to reduce patient
smoking.15
To our knowledge, there have been no studies that exam-
ine smoking trends among persons with mental illness. The
role of the mental health system in reducing rates of smoking
withinthiskeypopulationisalsopoorlyunderstood.Wethere-
fore compared smoking trends between 2004 and 2011 among
individuals with and without mental illness and assessed
whether these trends vary by treatment for mental illness and
by type of diagnosis.
Methods
Smoking Prevalence Data
We analyzed a nationally representative, noninstitutional-
ized sample of adults 18 and older from the 2004-2011 Medi-
cal Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) Medical Provider and
HouseholdComponents.HouseholdsselectedfortheMEPSare
a subsample of households participating in the previous year's
National Health Interview Survey. Approximately 15 000 in-
dividuals are newly surveyed each year to describe character-
istics of the US population related to health care utilization,
demographics, socioeconomic status, and health and mental
health status. Response rates between 2004 and 2011 varied
between 58.6% and 68.2%. All rates and model estimates were
weighted to be nationally representative and account for
sample design and survey nonresponse. Analyses were con-
ducted using Stata release 12.0.16 The study was approved by
the Cambridge Health alliance institutional review board; the
requirement for informed consent was waived.
Our dependent variable was current smoker status,
determined by the response to the question "Do you cur-
rently smoke?" We considered individuals to have a mental
health disorder or substance use disorder (referred to herein
as "mental illness") if (1) during the survey year they made
an outpatient visit to a primary care professional or special-
ist, linked to the behavioral health International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) codes 291, 292, and
295-314, or psychotherapy or mental health counseling, or a
prescription drug fill for a behavioral health disorder17; (2)
they scored more than 12 (possible scores, 0-24) on the
Kessler 6-Item Psychological Distress Scale (K-6), a criterion
predictive of a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental
Disorders (Fourth Edition) mental disorder and severe
impairment18; or (3) they scored more than 2 (possible
scores, 0-6) on the Patient Health Questionnaire 2 (PHQ-2)
depression symptom checklist, a sensitive (93%) and some-
what specific (75%) indicator for any depressive disorder.19
We additionally measured smoking trends defining mental
illness, using only criterion 1 and using only criteria 2 and 3.
Additionally, we assessed smoking rates among those receiv-
ing treatment for episodic mood disorder (ICD-9 code 296) or
neurotic/anxiety disorders (ICD-9 code 300).
To address missing data in variables other than current
smoking in the MEPS (less than 1% missing on K-6, PHQ-2, and
socioeconomicstatusvariables),weimplementedmultipleim-
putation methods using the mi procedure in Stata. This tech-
nique creates 5 complete data sets, imputes missing values
using a chained-equations approach, analyzes each data set,
and uses standard rules to combine estimates and adjust stan-
dard errors for the uncertainty attributable to imputation.20,21
We adjusted for covariates that potentially confound the
relationship between mental illness and cigarette smoking and
thathavedocumentedassociationwithsmoking.22 Forthefirst

claiming to be of Hispanic origin as Hispanic. Others were clas-
sified as black, white, or other race by their responses to the
question about race. Other covariates were age (18-24, 25-34,
35-44, 45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75 years), sex, marital status (mar-
ried, not married), income (<100% of the federal poverty level
[FPL]; 100%-199% of FPL; 200%-399% of FPL; 400% of FPL),
education (less than high school, high school graduate, some
college, college graduate), employment status (employed, not
employed),urbanicity(metropolitanstatisticalareawithpopu-
lation >250 000), and insurance category (private, Medicare,
Medicaid, other public insurance [ie, CHAMPVA], unin-
sured).
Analysis of Smoking Prevalence
We first describe sociodemographic characteristics of our
sample and present unadjusted differences of cigarette smok-
ingbetweenindividualswithandwithoutmentalillnessineach
year between 2004 and 2011, measuring the significance of dif-
ferences in trends using 2 tests.
We next estimated logistic regression models to assess
smokingtrendsbetween2004and2011amongindividualswith
and without mental illness, after adjustment for covariates,
using the following empirical model:
E(Y = 1) = f[0

where Y is an indicator of current smoking and f is the

indicates whether smoking trends differed by
mental health status between 2004-2005 and each consecu-
tive period. Goodness of fit was verified using Pregibon link
test23 and the modified Hosmer-Lemeshow test,24 and
F-adjusted mean residual goodness-of-fit statistics are
presented.25
To convert coefficients on interaction variables into dif-
ferences in the scale of interest (percentages),26 we estimated
predicted probabilities by period (for brevity, 2004-2005 and
2010-2011 are presented) and mental illness using the predic-
tive margins method,27 generating standard errors for each
group and differences between groups using bootstrap
methods.28 P  .05 (2-tailed) was considered statistically sig-
nificant.
Supplementary Analysis of Tobacco Cessation
and Treatment
Data for the secondary analysis are from the National Survey
on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), which provides nationally
representative estimates of smoking prevalence, behavioral
health, and sociodemographic characteristics. We pooled 3
years of NSDUH data (2009-2011) to create a robust sample of
adult (18 years) respondents who reported smoking more
than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime and experiencing mental
illness in the past year. An individual was defined as a quitter
or former smoker if he or she was a lifetime smoker and had
smoked zero cigarettes during the past 30 days.29,30 Mental
illness was determined using a prediction formula developed
by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration31 to identify any mental illness; severity
(mild, moderate, serious) of mental illness was determined
by combining data from the K-6 and the World Health
Organization­Disability Assessment Schedule impairment
scale. The prediction model successfully predicted mental ill-
ness and characterized 3 cutpoints of severity among a group
of 1504 NSDUH respondents who received a detailed
follow-up diagnostic interview.31
We estimated a logistic regression model of quitting smok-
ing conditional on receiving any mental health treatment dur-
ingthepastyear,receivinganysubstanceabusetreatmentdur-
ing the past year, severity of mental illness (mild, moderate,
serious), race/ethnicity, age, marital status, insurance status,
employment status, urbanicity, education and income (cat-
egorized to be similar to the MEPS data above), and an indi-
cator of any criminal activity (any lifetime arrest or any pa-
role or probation in the previous year). We estimated 2
additional logistic regression models, replacing any mental
health treatment with (1) past-year inpatient mental health
treatment, defined as any hospitalization overnight or longer
to receive treatment for mental illness; and (2) past-year out-
patientmentalhealthtreatment,definedasanyoutpatientvisit

chiatrist,socialworker,orcounselorforthetreatmentofamen-
tal illness. Goodness-of-fit tests and multiple imputation es-
timation strategies for missing data were conducted as
described above.
Results
Trends in Smoking Prevalence
The2004-2011MEPSsampleincludes165 269respondentswith
nonmissing data on the item measuring current smoking sta-
tus. Adults who received treatment for mental illness, had psy-
chological distress, or had probable depression ("with men-
tal illness") differed from the remaining population ("without
mental illness") in racial/ethnic composition, sex, and other
socioeconomic characteristics. Individuals with mental ill-
ness were more likely to be women, white, or unemployed and
less likely to be married or uninsured than individuals with-
out mental illness (Table 1). Unadjusted rates of smoking were
higheramongadultswithmentalillness(28.2%[95%CI,27.7%-
28.7%]) than among adults without mental illness (17.5% [95%
CI, 17.3%-17.7%]) (P < .001). Smoking rates among those re-
ceiving treatment for a mental health disorder were signifi-
cantly lower (26.4% [95% CI, 25.8%-27.0%]) than among those
screened as having severe psychological distress or probable
depression (34.2% [95% CI, 33.5%-34.9%]) (P < .001).
For individuals without mental illness, unadjusted smok-
ing rates declined from 19.5% (95% CI, 18.9%-20.2%) to 15.6%
(95%CI,15.0%-16.1%)between2004and2011(Figure),whereas
for those with mental illness, smoking rates declined from
28.8% (95% CI, 27.4%-30.2%) to 27.0% (95% CI, 25.7%-
28.4%), a significant difference in difference of 2.2% (95% CI,
1.0%-3.0%) (P = .006). Similar patterns were found among
those with and without treatment linked to a mental health
diagnosis, with and without severe psychological distress or
probable depression, with and without diagnosed neurotic or
anxiety disorder, and with and without depressive disorder
(Figure).
The interaction between mental illness and the 2010-
2011 periods (corresponding to 3
in the equation) was signifi-
cantly positive (P = .004) (Table 2), signifying differing smok-
ing rate trends among individuals with and without mental
illness, after adjustment for covariates. Age, sex, race/
ethnicity,maritalstatus,insurance,income,education,andur-
ban residence were all significant predictors of current smok-
ing status.
Model-predicted smoking rates that adjust for all covari-
ates declined significantly over time among individuals with-
out mental illness, decreasing from 19.2% (95% CI, 18.7%-
19.7%) to 16.5% (95% CI, 16.0%-17.0%) (P < .001), but did not
change significantly among those with mental illness, decreas-
ing only from 25.3% (95% CI, 24.2%-26.3%) to 24.9% (95% CI,
23.8%-26.0%) (P = .50). This represents a significant differ-
ence in difference of 2.3% (95% CI, 0.7%-3.9%) (P = .005)
(Table 3). Similar patterns were found when comparing model-
basedsmokingratesamongindividualswithandwithouttreat-
ment linked to a mental health diagnosis (Table 3) and those
with and without psychological distress or probable depres-
sion (Table 3), although this latter difference in difference was
not significant. Of note is that model-predicted smoking rates
adjusting for all covariates were considerably lower than un-
adjusted rates for individuals with mental illness. This differ-
ence was especially marked among those with psychological

(eTable in Supplement).
Discussion
We have further characterized the association of mental ill-
ness and smoking,2,3,6 demonstrating that recent decreases in
US smoking rates have not been realized among individuals
with mental illness, episodic mood disorder, or neurotic/
anxiety disorder. The mechanisms that support persistently
higher rates of smoking among individuals with mental ill-
ness are complex and remain understudied.32 Patients with
mental illness may attribute greater benefits and reward value
to smoking compared with patients without psychiatric
disorders33 or may experience more difficult life circum-
stances, higher negative affect, or a relative lack of alterna-
tive rewards.32,34 Identifying new interventions to address
mechanisms specific to this population should be a priority for
tobacco control policy.
We found higher rates of smoking among individuals with
psychological distress or probable depression compared with
those receiving treatment for a mental health diagnosis. This
disparity may be explained, in part, by compositional differ-
ences between these groups. Compared with the group receiv-
ing treatment, the population screened as having psychologi-
cal distress or probable depression was more likely to be
unemployed men with lower income and education--all risk
factors for tobacco use.35
Mental illness not only is an independent risk factor for
smoking but is associated with a number of smoking-related
risk factors, including higher poverty, lower education, and
lower employment (Table 1). Because of these associations,
the provision of care to an individual diagnosed with mental
illness should be seen as an opportunity for smoking pre-
vention or cessation treatment. For many individuals
receiving mental health treatment, interactions with mental
health professionals (eg, psychologists, psychiatrists, men-
tal health counselors) are their only access to preventive
health counseling. Effective tobacco cessation treatments,12
interventions that integrate mental health and substance
abuse treatment,13 and nicotine replacement therapies are
now readily available and can dovetail easily with psychoso-
cial treatments and prescription of psychotropic medica-
tions.
Our supplementary analysis found that individuals receiv-
ing mental health treatment are not only less likely to smoke
but are more likely to quit, even after adjustment for mental
health and sociodemographic factors. These results suggest
thatsmokerscanquitandremainabstinentfromcigarettesdur-
ing mental health treatment and that this is a promising set-
ting to promote smoking cessation. It also indicates the im-
portanceofassistingsmokerswithmentalillnessinovercoming
barriers to accessing mental health care (eg, insuring the un-
insured, increasing the supply of mental health care profes-
sionals, improving linkages between primary care and men-
tal health care) as a means to address smoking-related
harm.36,37
However, the fact that smoking rates for individuals re-
ceivingmentalhealthcarehavenotexperiencedthesamerates
of decline as the general population suggests limited adop-
tion of integrated treatments38 and ongoing barriers to cessa-
tion treatment in mental health care settings.39 Some pri-
mary care and behavioral health professionals continue to
believe that smoking cessation can adversely affect psychiat-
ric treatment.40 Other barriers to cessation treatment include
a lack of confidence that individuals with mental illness are
willing and able to quit, failure to appreciate the health ef-

be undergoing treatment for acute exacerbations of severe
mental disorders, although efforts for changing the smoking
culture in such settings are under way.45
This study has several limitations. First, our findings are
limited to a period (2004-2011) in which the decline in smok-
ing among the general population was relatively small, so that
the K-6 and PHQ-2 (administered for the first time in 2004)
could be incorporated into the analysis. It is possible that the
divergence in trends between individuals with and without
mental illness is a recent phenomenon. Second, the MEPS does
notcontainstructureddiagnosticinstrumentstoidentifymen-
talillness.Usingavailablemeasures,weidentifieda15%preva-
lenceofmentalillness,considerablylowerthanthe26%preva-
lence of any 12-month Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition) disorder using structured di-
agnostic instruments in a 2002-2003 national survey.9 Using
the K-6 and PHQ-2 criteria to determine mental illness raises
the possibility that mentally ill individuals with low levels of
distress and depressive symptoms may be underrepre-
sented, and smoking rates for the mentally ill may thus be un-
derestimated. Including individuals receiving any psycho-
therapy or with filled prescriptions for any psychotropic drug
may alternately miscategorize individuals with no or sub-
threshold mental health disorder. Significantly, the identi-
fied trends were similar for both populations as well as within
specific disorders.
Third, the MEPS excludes persons with mental illness who
are institutionalized, potentially underestimating the overall
prevalence of smoking in the US population. Fourth, the
supplementary NSDUH analysis does not allow for a causal de-
termination of whether smoking cessation was influenced by
mental health treatment, and it is possible that respondents
quit tobacco use before mental health treatment was initi-
ated. Interpretation of these findings should not rule out the
possibility of reverse causality (individuals are more likely to
initiate mental health care after quitting) or the possibility that
unobserved variables explain the strong relationship be-
tween treatment and cessation.
Despite these limitations, our findings provide evidence
of diverging trends in smoking rates among individuals with
and without mental illness, and the findings remain robust to
a number of different definitions of mental illness and among
individuals receiving treatment for neurotic/anxiety and epi-
sodic mood disorders. Our analyses also identify that men-
tally ill lifetime smokers receiving mental health treatment
were more likely to have quit smoking than their counter-
parts not receiving treatment.
Conclusions
Between 2004 and 2011, the decline in smoking among indi-
viduals with mental illness was significantly less than among
those without mental illness, although quit rates were greater
among those receiving mental health treatment. This sug-
gests that tobacco control policies and cessation interven-
tions targeting the general population have not worked as ef-
fectively for those with mental illness.
