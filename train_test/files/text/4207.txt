Introduction
The acquisition of English grammatical articles has been of
considerable concern since early 1970s (Brown, 1973;
Bresson, 1974; Maratsos, 1974, 2009; Warden, 1976). For
native speakers, the proper use of English articles is acquired
unconsciously and at an early stage (Brown, 1973; Maratsos,
1974). However, English-as-a-second language learners
(ELLs), especially those whose first languages (L1) do not
have the equivalent article systems, tend to have difficulty
acquiring English articles (Chen, 2000; Ionin & Montrul,
2010; Romaine, 2003). This study explored the acquisition
sequence, differences, and difficulties of English article by
ELLs whose L1 has, or does not have, the equivalence of
English article system (+Art or -Art).
Definition of Definite Article (the),
Indefinite Article (a or an), and Zero
Article
According to Leech and Svartvik (1994), there were two arti-
cles in English: the definite article the (as in the book) and the
indefinite article a (as in a book) or an (as in an eye).
Sometimes, noun requires no article at all, the zero article
(books, eyes). They said, the definite article the, the indefinite
article a or an, and zero article were used for different pur-
poses. The major use of the definite article the was to demon-
strate that the noun referred to a particular example of
something (Richards, Platt, & Platt, 1992). They also pointed
out that the major use of the indefinite article a or an was to
demonstrate that the noun referred to something general or to
something not having been identified by the speaker.
According to Yotsukura (1970) and Palmer (1939), there
were two types of zero article. Yotsukura (1970) found it nec-
essary to separate two types of NP (noun phrase) occurring
without (visible) articles, which he defined as the zero forms.
This is consistent with the believes of Palmer (1939), Sinclair
(1991), Chesterman (1991), and Master (1997), who sepa-
rated zero (indefinite, with mass and plural) and null (definite,
with singular proper nouns and some singular count nouns).
However, no unified theory of English articles was yet
available (Chesterman, 1991). This study was governed by
the definition mentioned above and focuses on a or an, the,
and zero article.

The Acquisition of English Articles
by Second Language Learners: The
Sequence, Differences, and Difficulties
Ganzhao Sun1
Abstract
Despite the numerous studies on English article acquisition, the acquisition sequence, differences, and difficulties by English-
as-a-second language learners (ELLs) remain to be further explored. With a detailed literature review, this study investigated
the acquisition sequence, differences, and difficulties of English articles by ELLs with diverse first language backgrounds.
Eighteen college ELLs participated in the study. Data were collected through cloze exercises. The results, through the analysis
of its database of 6,178 article used, indicated that "zero article" was the last to be acquired while article "a" is the first
to be acquired; positive correspondence existed between the growth of the acquisition of article "a/an," "the," and "zero"
between "+Art" (with article system) group and "-Art" (without article system) group. The results also revealed that (a) the
most difficult article for participants in both groups to acquire was "zero article," (b) "the" was the most difficult article for
participants in "+Art" group, and (c) "a" was the easiest one acquired by both groups. These findings, in fact, challenge the
commonsense belief that "+Art" ELLs acquired English articles faster than "-Art" ELLs and that when two languages were
similar, positive transfer would occur.

Literature Review
Studies on Article Acquisition by L1 Learners
Despite the abundant studies on second language (L2) acqui-
sition (Geranpayeh, 2000), the literature has yet revealed
limited studies on article acquisition by ELLs. Before the
exploration of English article acquisition by ELLs, it is
essential to review the major studies that relate to the acqui-
sition of English articles by L1 learners.
Outstanding contributors to the study of article acquisi-
tion by L1 learners are Zehler and Brewer (1982), Whitman
(1974), Bickerton (1981, 1984), Maratsos (1974, 2009),
Brown (1973), Warden (1976), Karmiloff-Smith (1979), and
Chesterman (1991).
Zehler and Brewer (1982) examined the sequence and
principles in article system used by L1 learners. They found
an early acquisition sequence of zero article use, a use only,
essentially correct a and the patterns of use, and overex-
tended the use.
Based on the assumption that English article structure was
a sequence of quantification and determination rather than a
choice between specified and unspecified, Whitman (1974)
recommended pedagogical sequence.
According to Bickerton (1981), the most comprehensive
examination of the acquisition of English articles was that of
Maratsos (1974, 2009) who confirmed Brown's (1973) natu-
ralistic observation that the article system was mastered at a
very early stage by L1 learners.
Bickerton (1981) also found that some of Maratsos's
(1974, 2009) findings were challenged by Warden (1976)
and Karmiloff-Smith (1979) who questioned the earliness
with which the definite­nondefinite distinction was acquired.
In his language bioprogram hypothesis, Bickerton (1984)
indicated that there was a SNSD (specific­nonspecific dis-
tinction) by English-speaking children. When examining
child's early language, he found an outstanding higher per-
centage of articles demonstrated in specific-reference NP,
whereas zero articles would have continuously existed in the
non-specific environment longer than anywhere else. Hence,
he claimed the innateness of the SNSD. That is, human beings
have an innate ability to make distinctions of specific- and
non-specific-reference NP. The SNSD would be quite impos-
sible to learn by means of linguistic data. It is innate.
Bickerton (1981, 1984) also stated that only non-specific
reference was marked by zero article, but the persistence of
the notion in advanced--proficiency of non-native English
speakers and the evidence from the pidgin studies suggested
that unambiguous specific reference was also likely con-
nected to the zero article (as cited in Master, 1997).
Although Brown (1973) and Maratsos (1974, 2009)
believed that the article system was mastered at a very early
stage by L1 learners, Bickerton's (1981, 1984) theory of
SNSD, as aforementioned, emphasized the innate perspec-
tive of article acquisition.
However, Chesterman (1991) challenged the theory of
SNSD, claiming that it was not helpful to link article use too
directly to noun class, and hence, to the distinction between
count and non-count.
Bioprogram and Article Acquisition by ELLs
Worthwhile to mention are Ionin (2003) and Ionin, Ko, and
Wexler (2004), who applied Bickerton's bioprogram theory
to English articles acquisition by ELLs.
Ionin (2003) found that through UG (universal grammar),
ELLs could assess semantic distinctions beneath article
choice and there was a specificity distinction that discrimi-
nated the definiteness distinction.
Ionin etal. (2004) investigated the role of specificity in
article semantics and asserted that articles could interpret the
feature +definite or the feature +specific. They found that
ELLs could approach universal semantic features +definite
and +specific and there was direct access to universal seman-
tic features and +specific features.
Studies on Sequence, Differences, and Difficulties
of Article Acquisition by ELLs
Unlike the acquisition of English article by L1 learners, the
English article system is one of the most difficult aspects of
English grammar for ELLs and one of the last to be fully
acquired (Master, 1987). Following are some outstanding
studies on the article acquisition sequence, differences, and
difficulties by ELLs of various L1 backgrounds.
Ekiert (2004) examined the L2 development sequence of
article acquisition by Polish-speaking ELLs and found evi-
dence supporting the hypothesis that the sequence of L2
article acquisition mainly followed the L1 natural order of
article acquisition. Lu (2001) investigated acquisition
sequence by Chinese-speaking ELLs and found an order of
the = a > , and the > a > , among all groups.
Through the study on the acquisition of the English defi-
nite article by Chinese- and Malay-speaking ELLs, Wong
and Quek (2007) found that the acquisition sequence of the
four non-genetic uses of the followed a natural order of situ-
ation > structural > textual > cultural, regardless of their L1
backgrounds, and the L2 rate of accuracy on article usage
improved outstandingly as proficiency level increased.
Master (1990, 1997) suggested that the English article sys-
tem could be learned through the separation between classifica-
tion (a and zero) and identification (the). He claimed that
speakers of -Art needed more time to acquire the article system
than +Art speakers did, but they would eventually acquire it.
zero--for--the errors would continue to occur until advanced
interlanguage for -Art speakers. He found that +Art group pro-
duced larger number of correct answers than the -Art group.
The English articles acquisition order was null > the > a in the
(-Art) group and the > null > a in the (+Art) group.

Through the examination of the acquisition sequence of
English article functions, Park (1996) found that French and
German students (+Art) earned higher scores than the
Japanese and Korean students (-Art). In addition, the acqui-
sition order of English article functions was similar no mat-
ter whether or not L1 had an article system.
Snape, García-Mayo, and Gurel (2013) studied L2 acqui-
sition of English generic NPs by Spanish-speaking ELLs
(+Art), Turkish-speaking ELLs whose L1 had an indefinite
article but no definite article, and Japanese-speaking ELLs
(-Art). They found that L2 article preference was mainly
influenced by their L1.
Ionin, Montrul, Kim, and Philippov (2011) investigated
whether Russian- and Korean-speaking ELLs (-Art) could
discriminate different kinds of English genericity. Their
study showed that although their L2 showed zero article for
plural nouns and indefinite article for singular generics, it did
not demonstrate the acquisition of definite article for singu-
lar generics.
Ionin and Montrul (2010) examined L2 acquisition of the
expression of plural NPs. The results of the study supported the
hypothesis that Spanish-speaking ELLs (+Art) over-accepted
the generic expression of English definite plurals far more than
Korean-speaking ELLs whose L1 had no article system (-Art).
Ionin, Zubizarreta, and Philippov (2009) investigated English
article use by ELLs of adults and children, whose L1 was
Russian (-Art). They found that both groups of learners dem-
onstrated sensitivity to definiteness and specificity.
Ionin, Zubizarreta, and Maldonado (2008) explored three
sources of knowledge in the acquisition of English articles
by L2 learners: L1-transfer, L2-input, and Universal
Grammar. They found that all three sources were related to
the English article acquisition.
Through the examination on L1 transfer in article acquisi-
tion, Sharma (2005) found that the new article system pro-
duced by L2 learners showed no resemblance with their L1
article system. Definite article the did not disappear com-
pletely in their speech when their L1 had no article, although
L1 transfer was obvious when it contained the specific indef-
inite article a. Zegarac (2004) investigated the relevance
theory (Sperber & Wilson, 1995) for the acquisition of
English article "the" by ELLs of -Art. He found that L2
learning was influenced not only by L1 transfer but also
through the process of designing and testing hypotheses.
Romaine (2003) found that ELLs of +Art made faster
progress than those without one.
Mayo and Pilar (2008) found that (a) the "four nongeneric
use" of articles demonstrated different difficulty levels for
the ELLs, (b) ELLs' "underuse of obligatory the" decreased
outstandingly from elementary to low-intermediate level
until they moved up to advanced levels (pp. 550-565), (c) the
participants' performance in the overuse of the was strongly
influenced by their L1 and improved significantly with pro-
ficiency level, and (d) the difficulty level for an ELL setting
was substantial.
Geranpayeh (2000) examined the difficulties of English
article acquisition by Persian-speaking ELLs and found that
these ELLs had problems identifying the English definite
marker when it was in the subject position.
Chen (2000) indicated that English article could be one of
the most difficult grammatical components for Taiwanese
ELLs because L1 (Chinese) did not have article system. He
also claimed that errors made by these ELLs were due to L1
interference.
Purpose of the Study
Despite the outstanding aforementioned studies on English
article acquisition, the acquisition sequence, differences, and
difficulties by ELLs remain to be further explored. Based on
the definition of articles and literature review of article
acquisition mentioned above, this study examined the
sequence, differences, and difficulties of article acquisition
demonstrated by ELLs with various L1 backgrounds.
Method
Participants
The participants of the study (Table 1) are 18 college stu-
dents learning English as a second language (ESL) at a lan-
guage institute in the United States, with age ranging from
20- (from18) to 30+. The participants were divided into three
levels according to the level of ESL class they were
attending.
Level A participants were students placed in advanced
classes according to college placement testing (with an
equivalent Test of English as a Foreign Language [TOFEL]
score of approximately 430-480). Among them, three were
male and three were female. They had various L1 back-
grounds--Korean, Chinese, Spanish, French, and Hebrew
and had been in the United States for at least 2 years.
Level B participants were those who were placed in the
intermediate classes based on college placement test (with an
equivalent TOFEL score of 300-430). Among them, two
were male and four were female. Their L1s were Polish,
French, Spanish, Russian, and Urdu. They had been in the
United States for at least 9 months.
Level C participants were students attending the begin-
ners' classes according to college placement test (with an
equivalent TOFEL score below 300). Among them, two were
female and four were male. Their L1s were Spanish, French,
Urdu, and Bangla, and they had been in the United States for
at least 3 months.
Data Collection
Data were collected by means of cloze exercises (sample,
Appendix A). Participants were asked to complete conversa-
tion, dialogues, sentences, and paragraphs with article a or
4 SAGE Open
an, the, or zero. The participants were required to complete
the cloze in 45 to 60 min.
Data Analysis
After the cloze exercises of the 18 participants were com-
pleted, the answers were corrected according to the answer
keys provided by the resource. The scores were categorized
into three groups: Level A (Advanced), Level B
(Intermediate), and Level C (Beginning) under the forms of
article a or an, the, and zero, and the percentage and raw
scores were documented (sample table of data analysis,
Appendix B).
Reliability of the Data
To insure the reliability of the data, three major consider-
ations were taken. First, the same length of time and condi-
tion were provided for each group of participants. Second,
Kuder­Richardson reliability coefficient (K-R 21) formula
(Hatch & Lazaraton, 1991; Richards etal., 1992) was applied
to estimate internal consistency. Third, the cloze exercises
were corrected according to the answer keys provided by the
resources so that subjective judgment could be avoided.
Results of the Studies
The results of the study (Appendix Table C1) show that in
the group of Level A (Advanced), the participants demon-
strated an accuracy of 84.1% (116 out of 138) for article a or
an. They demonstrated an accuracy of 77.1% (162 out of
210) for article the. For zero article, the participants showed
an accuracy of 61.7% (137 out of 222).
In the group of Level B (Intermediate), the participants
demonstrated an accuracy of 81.9% (118 out of 144) for arti-
cle a or an. They demonstrated an accuracy of 78.9% (142
out of 180) for article the. For zero article, the participants
showed an accuracy of 47.2% (105 out of 222).
In the group of Level C (Beginning), the participants
demonstrated an accuracy of 77.1% (111 out of 144) for arti-
cle a or an. They demonstrated an accuracy of 69.1% (112
out of 162) for article the. For zero article, the participants
showed an accuracy of 53.2% (115 out of 216).
The results of the study (Appendix Table D1) reveal that
in the group of Level A (Advanced), the participants whose
L1s contain article systems demonstrated an accuracy of
83.9% (193 out of 230) for article a or an. They demon-
strated an accuracy of 81.4% (285 out of 350) for article the.
For zero article, they showed an accuracy of 62.1% (230 out
of 370). The participants whose L1s do not contain article
systems demonstrated an accuracy of 84.7% (195 out of 230)
for article a or an. They demonstrated an accuracy of 74.3%
(260 out of 350) for article the. For zero article, they showed
an accuracy of 61.6% (228 out of 370).
In the group of Level B (Intermediate), the participants
whose L1s contain article systems demonstrated an accuracy
of 91.6% (220 out of 240) for article a or an. They demon-
strated an accuracy of 86.7% (260 out of 300) for article the.
For zero article, the participants showed an accuracy of 50%
(185 out of 370). The participants whose L1s do not contain
article systems demonstrated an accuracy of 62.5% (150 out
of 240) for article a or an. They demonstrated an accuracy of
63.3% (190 out of 300) for article the. For zero article, the
participants showed an accuracy of 1.4% (5 out of 370).
In the group of Level C (Beginning), the participants
whose L1s contain article systems demonstrated an accuracy

Discussion, Conclusion, and
Implications
Through the study (Appendix Table D1), the following was
found and discussed:
First of all, the scores in Appendix Table D1 indicate that
the most significant difference demonstrated in the acquisi-
tion of article a or an, article the, and zero article at Level B
between ELLs whose L1 had article systems and those whose
L1 had no article systems.
Next, significant difference was also demonstrated in zero
article acquisition at Levels B and C between ELLs whose
L1 had article systems and ELLs whose L1 had no article
systems.
Finally, the results shown in Appendix Table D1 indicate
that it was consistent with what Master (1987) found: that
(+Art) group had produced larger number of correct answers
than (-Art) group. However, different finding demonstrates
that the acquisition sequence of the English articles was a >
the > zero for Levels A and C and the > a > zero for Level B
participants in (-Art) group and a > the > zero for Levels A
and B participants and a > zero > the for Level C partici-
pants in (+Art) group. In other words, the most difficult arti-
cle for the ELLs in both (-Art) and (+Art) groups to acquire
was zero article except for Level C participants in (+Art)
group, who tended to have the most difficulty in learning
article the, whereas a was the easiest article for the ELLs in
both groups except Level B participants in (-Art) group.
In regard to the sequence, differences, and difficulties of
the article acquisition by the participants, the following can
be concluded based on the results of the study (Table C1,
Appendix C):
First, zero article was the last one to be acquired and was
the most difficult one for L2 learners of all levels; indefinite
article a was the first one and the easiest one for L2 learners
of all levels to acquire.
Second, a steady but insignificant growth (4.8 points) has
demonstrated for the acquisition of indefinite article a from
Level C participants to Level B participants and growth (2.2
points) from Level B participants to Level A participants.
Third, for definite article the, Level B participants demon-
strated a growth of 9.8 points from Level C participants, but
Level A participants showed a decrease of 1.8 points from
Level B participants to Level A participants.
Fourth, for zero article, there was a decrease by six points
from Level C participants to Level B participants but a
significant move up by 14.5 points from Level B participants
to Level A participants.
Fifth, the results demonstrated that positive correspon-
dence existed between the growth of the acquisition of indef-
inite article a and the proficiency level of L2 learners, but no
regular correspondence had been demonstrated between the
acquisition of definite article the and zero article.
For researchers, educators, and learners in the field, the
following implications are suggested:
First of all, as aforementioned, the study revealed that the
most difficult article for the ELLs in both (-Art and +Art)
groups to acquire was zero article, except for Level C partici-
pants in (+Art) group who tended to have the most difficulty in
learning article the. In fact, this finding, which is uncommon-
sense (Mayher, 1990; Sun, 2000) in nature, challenges the com-
monsense belief that ELLs whose L1 contains article systems
(+Art) acquired English articles faster than ELLs whose L1 did
not contain article systems (-Art; Master, 1990, 1997; Park,
1996; Romaine, 2003) and that when two languages were simi-
lar, positive transfer would occur (Ekiert, 2004; Master, 1987;
Park, 1996; Romaine, 2003; Snape et
al., 2013); when they
were different, negative transfer would happen (Chen, 2000).
In addition, as shown above, a or an was the easiest article
for the ELLs in both groups, except Level B participants in
(-Art) group. What are the underlining reasons for these
interlanguage phenomena?
Moreover, as aforementioned, Bickerton (1981, 1984)
claimed the innateness of the SNSD. Does the acquisition of
the English articles by English language learners associate
with SNSD? If the answer is positive, what is the underlining
reason for the differences demonstrated in the interlanguage
produced by ELLs from various L1 backgrounds with or
without article systems?
Finally, although Bickerton (1981, 1984) emphasized the
innate aspect of article acquisition, Chesterman (1991) held
that it was not helpful to connect article use too directly to
noun class, and hence, to the distinction between count and
non-count. Will further study focusing on the article distribu-
tion on count and non-count nouns by ELLs determine whether
or not the distinction ever exists in the interlanguage by ELLs?
If the answer is positive, how and why does it occur?
Limitation of the Study
Because the number, age, and L1 backgrounds of the partici-
pants in the study were limited, it is necessary to increase the
scale of the participants in the study with a larger number, more
various age groups, and divers L1 backgrounds before we can
claim the universality of the findings demonstrated in the study.
