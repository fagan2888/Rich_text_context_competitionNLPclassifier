Beginning Physical Education Teachers
In their first year, physical education teachers become aware
of the many complexities and difficulties that are involved in
the teaching profession. Not only must they overcome these,
but they must also grapple with the additional intricacies that
are part of being a first-year teacher beginning their teaching
career (Hardy, 1999).
Physical education teachers' induction into the teaching
profession differs slightly from that of other teaching sub-
jects. Physical education may be less stressful, because in
previous research there has been no mention of the reality
shock that tends to accompany the experiences of other sub-
ject classroom teachers (Sparkes, Templin, & Schempp,
1993; Thevenard, Haddock, Phillips, & Reddish, 2009;
Tinning, McCuaig, & Hunter, 2006).
The role of physical education teachers has been ques-
tioned on various occasions citing the subject's usefulness
and appropriateness for modern day teaching. Keay (2006)
looked at the professional development opportunities pro-
vided during the induction process for physical education
teachers. Results of the study suggest that new teachers were
able to call upon their previous experience to guide their
instruction in schools; however, it was also suggested that
school managers, heads of departments, and external school
providers do have a need to ensure adequate learning oppor-
tunities are provided to teachers so they can continually chal-
lenge their own practice.
Following on from the subject area of physical education
being questioned over its appropriateness, the teaching of
physical education to pre-service primary school teachers
has also been questioned in the literature because of the dif-
ficulties primary school teachers often encounter with teach-
ing physical education. Morgan and Hansen (2007), in their
study of 189 teachers discovered that teachers were not plan-
ning, implementing, reporting, or evaluating physical educa-
tion programs. The authors suggest that due to the lack of
confidence in primary-based teachers to teach physical edu-
cation programs, professional development and pre-service
education needs to be strengthened and made more suitable
for primary school teachers' needs and skill set. The confi-
dence of non-physical education specialists to teach physical
education was investigated by Morgan and Bourke (2008).
The study found that many teachers were dissatisfied and
disgruntled with teaching physical education, and teacher
educators needed to find ways to challenge these perceptions
and reinvigorate teachers to want to teach physical education
for the benefit of their students as well as the teachers.

First-Year Physical Education Teachers'
Experiences With Teaching African
Refugee Students
Christopher Francis Baldwin1
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to analyze and explore the experiences of eight first-year physical education teachers who
have taught African refugee students. Interviews were conducted at the end of each participant's first year of teaching. The
findings of this study highlight the vast different learning styles of students from Africa and the strategies that these teachers
trialed and incorporated into their lessons in an attempt to minimize the disruptions they experienced when first introduced
to the students. The results of this study, together with information from the literature, suggest that the training and
education of teachers in Australia must incorporate strategies for teaching students from different backgrounds, cultures, and
living situations to better facilitate the inclusion of them in school-based activities and learning.

Inadequate instruction of pre-service teachers has been
suggested as one of the reasons why physical education is
failing in primary schools (Elliot, Atencio, Campbell, & Jess,
2013). In this study, they interviewed 327 non-specialist pri-
mary teachers regarding their experiences with their pre-ser-
vice university teaching course in physical education. The
study concludes that the teachers in the courses were only
given a basic starting point that was inadequate for teaching
physical education effectively. Recommendations are made
for more critical and reflective learning opportunities and
experiences in physical education.
Although numerous challenges have been identified in the
teaching of physical education, it has been suggested that one
of the biggest challenges lies in understanding what physical
education is (Coulter & Chroinin, 2013). In their study, where
participants were asked to write down what physical educa-
tion is to them, results suggest that for a large proportion of
the pre-service teachers involved in the study, their knowl-
edge and understanding of physical education were largely
based on their own school experiences. The researchers
acknowledge that although previous knowledge and experi-
ence are valuable, physical education needs to move beyond
reproducing dominant sport and health ideologies.
The initial years of teaching for beginning teachers are
extremely important in their development of knowledge and
understanding in the classroom environment (Mtika, 2010).
These early years in beginning teachers' career determine
whether they will remain in the profession as well as what
kind of teacher they will become (Thevenard et al., 2009).
Researchers have suggested that the first years of a teacher's
career are actually learning years for the teacher out on the
job (Hardy, 1999; Ibrahim, 2012; Thevenard et al., 2009).
The first years of teaching are acknowledged as often being
the hardest. Shoffner (2011), in her study looked at begin-
ning teacher's experiences and what they perceived as being
some of the hardest aspects of teaching to come to terms
with. The participants in Shoffner's study identified these
aspects as adjustment to the profession, acceptance of stu-
dents, and management of emotion. Shoffner suggests that
teacher educators need to prepare beginning teachers for the
existence of these concerns in the classroom and one way
that they may be achieved in an ongoing sense is through the
teaching and practice of reflection.
Research has suggested that beginning teachers are not
always provided the necessary support they need and as a
result can suffer from reality shock which can lead to their
premature departure from the teaching profession (El baz-
Luwisch, 2005). "Beginning teachers have real learning
needs that cannot be grasped in advance or outside the con-
text of the classroom" (Ibrahim, 2012, p. 540). Classroom
management, motivation of students, juggling workload,
assessment and marking, reports, parent interviews, and
dealing with individual difference are just some of the day-
to-day tasks that today's teachers have to deal with.
Teaching Students From Diverse
Cultural and Linguistic Backgrounds
The ability to successfully teach students from diverse cul-
tural and linguistic backgrounds is underpinned by the
knowledge and training of the teacher in question
(Zozakiewicz, 2010). Training programs vary greatly from
institution to institution, so much so that Zozakiewicz (2010)
in her study suggested that one of the more successful ways
of preparing teachers for the challenges of teaching diverse
students is through in-school mentoring programs.
Zozakiewicz acknowledges that culturally responsible men-
toring helps teachers become critical thinkers about the cul-
turally diverse contexts with which they work, in turn
assisting them develop inclusive practices for their students.
The ability of teachers to balance the ever changing class-
room dynamics with the demands of school policies, curricu-
lum, and other constraints is a hugely difficult task (Miller,
2011). Couple this challenge with students from diverse cul-
tures and with varying degrees of linguistic ability and you
have an even tougher job as a teacher. Miller's (2011) study
addressed this challenge in one school in Melbourne where
the spectrum of conflicts the school's teachers dealt with was
so great, the teachers themselves often felt isolated and dis-
empowered. The study concludes that there is a greater need
for schools to support and retain their teachers, and one way
of doing this is ensuring there is the support and training pro-
vided in the teaching of literacy, especially to non-English
speaking students.
Trent (2011) further supported this notion by adding that
beginning teachers often have rigid views about themselves
and about their teaching abilities; add to this the complexities
of teaching students with limited or no English and linguistic
abilities and these conceptions multiple tenfold. Trent argues
that future research needs to address the way teachers con-
struct their teaching identity and how this identity moves and
changes over the course of a teaching career.
Malewski, Sharma, and Phillion (2012) took this point
further in their study, indicating that before we even address
the schools the beginning teachers are teaching in, we need
to look at their overall professional experience (practicum).
Their study acknowledges that students who accessed the
opportunity for an international field experience component
to their university study were more likely to be aware of, and
sensitive to, the needs of diverse students in the classroom.
Teaching in a Global World--The New
Challenge for Beginning Teachers
The ever increasing migration rate, along with an ever
increasing numbers of refugees seeking asylum and resi-
dency status in countries free from war and oppression, has
meant that education systems across the world have had to
become more accommodating for students attending schools
Baldwin 3
from non-native backgrounds (Knoblauch, 2001). Although
many schools and governing institutions of schools have
begun to make arrangements and put policies and procedures
in place for dealing with these students, pre-service educa-
tion programs have maintained their traditional stance of
teacher training; meaning teachers are not trained and
equipped to deal with students who arrive in their classes
from these often traumatic backgrounds (Australian
Government, 2007).
In Australia, a country that has a history of migration
(Australian Bureau of Statistics, 2008), education has tended
to be "inter-cultural" (Turner & Fozdar, 2010). Much exist-
ing research has focused on ethnic minorities from non-refu-
gee populations (Turner & Fozdar, 2010). Little or no
research has attempted to look at refugee populations and
how the educating of students from refugee populations is
carried out, or how teachers dealing with refugee students
manage to teach these students the curriculum. Turner and
Fozdar (2010) acknowledged that low levels of literacy, sig-
nificant cultural difference, and possible trauma related to
displacement experiences make educating refugee students
quite difficult and challenging for teachers, schools, and their
fellow classmates alike.
The teaching of basic literacy skills to migrant students
has been identified as a difficult task (Cross, 2011). The
ability of teachers to understand the concept of teaching
literacy, when the students they are teaching are not native
speakers of the language, was the nature of Cross's (2011)
article. The article concludes that here in Australia, as well
as other countries, we have a premised idea that all stu-
dents share a common language for their engagement with
literacy and that is not the case. Cross suggests that we
need to revisit these assumptions regarding the teaching of
literacy if we are to engage with the contemporary school
system.
Since 1996, Australia has resettled more than 20,000
African-born individuals (Australian Government, 2007).
Many of these individuals have been students; some of them
enter schools throughout Australia. Their traumatic upbring-
ing in Sudan where many have witnessed atrocities per-
formed on parents, siblings, friends, and even strangers
presents the teachers who will be teaching these students
with great challenges. This article looks at eight beginning
teachers in Sydney, Australia, who teach physical education
in primary and secondary schools. Their experiences with
teaching African refugee students and the challenges and tri-
umphs they experienced during their first year of full-time
teaching forms the basis for this research.
Purpose of the Study
The purpose of this study was to understand how first-year
physical education teachers engaged with African refugee
students in their physical education lessons. The questions
that guided this study were as follows:
1. How do physical educators, who are in the first year
of their teaching deal with students from different
cultures, specifically Africa?
2. What on-site measures are in place to assist first-year
teachers deal with the different dynamics of learning
styles present in students from Africa?
3. How do first-year physical educators describe their
experiences with teaching African refugee students?
Method
The primary source of data for this study was interviews con-
ducted with the new beginning teachers at the end of their
first full year of teaching.
In-Depth Interviewing
The researcher carried out multiple open-ended questions
with multiple interviews used (Alvarez & Urla, 2002; Kvale,
1996, 2007). All interviews were digitally recorded and
transcribed. The raw transcribed interviews constituted the
primary data set for subsequent analysis (Berg, 2009;
Clandinin & Connelly, 1994; Elliott, 2005; Rubin & Rubin,
2005; Sparkes, 1995; Wengraf, 2001). The use of teacher
experiences as a way of learning is not something new;
Orland-Barak and Maskit (2011) discussed that the use of
story sheds light on the often hostile and adverse sides of
teaching. The stories also "shed light on the human side of
teachers and teaching, reflecting the plots, heroes and dra-
mas that surround any teacher . . . " (Orland-Barak & Maskit,
2011, p. 435).
Each of the beginning teachers was interviewed twice at
his or her home or a mutually convenient and acceptable
location during the summer schools holidays (December-
February). The purpose of the first interview with the begin-
ning teachers was to establish autobiographical contexts for
understanding the participants'reasons for becoming a phys-
ical education teacher, their experiences during their teacher
training course, and their goals for the next 12 months with
respect to their teaching. The information collected in this
first interview informed lines of questioning for the follow-
up interview.
At the end of the first interview, the second interview
was scheduled to be conducted approximately 2 to 3 weeks
later, which allowed enough time for the first interview to
be transcribed and a preliminary analysis done. The second
interview concentrated on what each participant's first year
as a physical education teacher was like, and how their
teaching had to "change" to enable the inclusion of the
African refugee students in their classes. Questions included
the following:
·
· Moving on to your teaching this year, tell me about
your first day/week of the school year.
·
· How did you come to be placed in this school?
4 SAGE Open
·
· Were you aware of the schools intake of African refu-
gee students?
·
· Compare how you taught in the beginning of the
school year with how you teach now.
·
· How did you learn to teach the way you do now?
·
· Upon reviewing your first year of teaching and the
university teaching course that you recently com-
pleted, do you feel like your teacher training ade-
quately prepared you for teaching? Why/why not?
This is only a brief sample of the questions used in the
interviews with the beginning teachers. A number of addi-
tional questions were asked to elicit responses from the par-
ticipants that addressed what their actual first year of
full-time teaching was like and how as teachers they were
called upon to modify and adapt their classes to cater for
student needs.
Participants
The participants for this study were eight physical education
teachers who completed their first year of teaching during
the 2012 school year. They taught full-time at the primary or
secondary school level in Sydney, Australia. The physical
education teachers were selected to ensure representation by
gender and level (primary and secondary), public and pri-
vate, and small and large schools.
Recruitment of participants for the study was done by
contacting physical education teacher educators and school
administrators throughout Sydney, Australia. A list of poten-
tial participants who fulfilled the requirements noted above
was generated and then used as the basis for the selection
process (Table 1).
Working with the data.The transcripts were read and care-
fully reviewed for thematic elements that were common to
each participant's case. Profiles were then created that
described how their particular experiences in their schools
shaped their first year of physical education teaching.
The transcripts were divided into data units for each
research question, which represented a single point of infor-
mation pertaining to each individual teacher's experience in
their school. The transcripts were then reviewed again to
identify thematic elements that appeared to be common
across individual cases (Clandinin & Connelly, 1994; Miles
& Huberman, 1994). Categories, themes, and tentative
hypotheses about relationships were developed as the inter-
mediate products of inductive reasoning (Buchbinder, 2011;
Mello, 2002; Seale, 2003).
Trustworthiness.To ensure trustworthiness of procedures
used while conducting this project, two methods described
by Guba and Lincoln (2004), peer debriefing and member
checking, were utilized. The peer debriefer, with whom I met
biweekly throughout the period of data collection and analy-
sis, had access to all the data that were collected, this included
research logs and interview transcripts. The central purpose
of periodic meetings with the peer debriefer was to ensure
that the findings were grounded in the data, rather than in my
own expectations and dispositions. Member checks were
possible in that follow-up interviews were conducted. In
addition, participants were given their own profiles to review
and were invited to provide written feedback.
Analysis and Interpretation of Data
The analysis and interpretation of this study are reported in
two sections. The first section provides profiles of two of the
eight teachers and how their particular schools operated and
supported, or did not support, their first year of teaching. The
two selected participants to be reported in this article were
chosen due to the variety of experiences they had. One
teacher, Joe, was challenged daily and found his first full
year of teaching frustrating and tiresome. Sarah, the other
teacher, had lots of support and actively shaped aspects of
her classroom teaching. The second section of the article
summarizes the themes common to all participants.
Collectively, these are brought together to relate the purpose
of the study and respond to the research questions.
Teacher Profiles
Joe. Joe's first year of teaching took place at a state public
high school in Sydney. He taught health and physical educa-
tion to students in years 7 to 10. The isolation and lack of
support he encountered from his fellow colleagues in his first
full year of teaching made his ability to plan engaging and
innovative lessons for his students quite difficult. He
acknowledged that he was assigned to the "beginning teacher

support team" where first-year teachers at his school would
meet to discuss issues with senior staff. Overall, he still felt
that he had a difficult time trying to implement a curriculum
that would move students toward his goals of knowledge and
skill acquisition for lifelong participation in physical educa-
tion. The problem was manifested further by the inclusion of
three African refugee students in his classes. He admitted he
had no idea how to teach them and engage them in his
lessons.
Joe felt confident as he began his first year of teaching, as
he felt that his student teaching experience had provided him
with the opportunity to become acquainted with the school
routine as well as the necessary lesson planning and behavior
management. As a student teacher, however, he had not had
to deal with faculty peers, parents, and administrators, as
well as classes that contained students with extreme learning
needs. In addition, he had not been responsible for the cur-
riculum, and above all, he had not been alone in a classroom
environment.
Joe was not completely alone in his first year of teaching.
Along with the beginning teacher support team, he also met
regularly with a colleague, roughly once a fortnight. John, a
senior physical education teacher, taught at Joe's school, and
was assigned as his mentor teacher for the year. Both teach-
ers taught lessons together on Wednesdays and Fridays,
which allowed Joe to develop some confidence in the plan-
ning, preparation, and execution of physical education
lessons.
Joe's biggest challenge in his first year of full-time teach-
ing was dealing with students from non-English speaking
countries which is something he had not had to do at all dur-
ing his teaching practicum. He was now in a school that had
a student population of 882 students of whom 71 were
classed as refugee students. These refugee students had little
or no education background, nor did any of them understand
the concept of sitting in a classroom and listening to the
teacher talk. He was now suddenly responsible for three of
them in his classes, and he needed to ensure that they were
learning and participating in the lessons and not distracting
or interfering with his teaching or the learning of the other
students.
Health and physical education in the school Joe is teach-
ing is not a strong priority as he commented during his inter-
view. "Some of the other teachers, the principal, and even the
parents do not place a lot of emphasis on physical education,
which can often make planning and preparing for lessons dif-
ficult." He discussed how in his beginning teacher support
group he has made mention of the difficulties in catering for
the African refugee students in his class. He discussed how
other beginning teachers in the group had also discussed
their difficulty in engaging them in classes.
I was frustrated at my lack of success in engaging and teaching
these students in my health and physical education class, so I
brought it up at our meeting and it turned out I was not the only
one. The deputy principal, who chairs these meetings, however
was not very helpful and became dismissive of our problems
citing that we just need to get a grip with teaching and get the job
done. We were like, but we have not had any training or
professional development in how to teach these students.
Joe fought very hard to maintain his goals during his first
year of being a physical education teacher. Although he
wanted his students to enjoy physical activity like any
teacher, he also wanted them to learn something in his
classes, not just play games, and his fear was that because he
lacked the skill to teach and engage the refugee students who
were in his class, his classes turned into just mere games. He
also lacked the ability to communicate with the parents of the
African students. When he called parents at home to discuss
problems with what their child was doing in class, he was
confronted with a language barrier that he or the school could
not break, giving further rise to frustration.
Joe's experiences were further compounded by the inabil-
ity of the African students in his lessons to concentrate on the
task at hand. He commented,
I would often be giving instruction to the students on technique,
such as how to hold a cricket bat, or how to dribble the basketball
and the African students would be talking to each other or
looking elsewhere . . . It was very off-putting for me. I would
chat to them and tell them to pay attention but a minute or two
later they would be doing it again.
Despite the negative experiences, including the lack of
training, professional development, professional support
from the school, and the inability to communicate effec-
tively with parents, Joe persevered with his efforts to pro-
vide what he considered to be a sound physical education
program. He indicated that while it has not been easy, and he
has often gone home at the end of the day wondering what
he had achieved, he felt that he had made sufficient progress
in getting to know and understand the African students and
the experiences that they bring to the classroom. He dis-
cusses that
it's a trust thing, it took a long time to establish with the students,
and partly because for a lot of them they come from such a
traumatic background, and are used to running and hiding. PE
and sport seems to be a great "break out" time for them to play
and have fun, something I imagine they have not had a lot of
opportunity to do in their lives.
Asked about his thoughts on his education and being
properly trained to deal with these types of students, Joe
remained fairly positive and upbeat about his course:
Look, on one hand it is easy to say that Uni did not properly
prepare me for the world of teaching, but then that is true of any
job; it's not until you're put there that you really learn the ropes
and start to gain valuable experience and knowledge about what
6 SAGE Open
you need to do. It would have been nice to have some knowledge
and background on what to do and how to engage these students
but Uni can't prepare you for everything!
Sarah. Sarah taught physical education to students in Grades
K-6 at a Catholic primary school in Wollongong. Sarah's
experiences during her first year were in stark contrast to that
of Joe's. The facilities at the school were amazing for a pri-
mary school: two large gymnasia, a 33-m swimming pool,
two tennis courts, two outdoor basketball courts, and three
spacious multi-purpose playing fields. The facilities, in con-
junction with the variety of equipment available, allowed
Sarah to teach virtually any activity that would be appropri-
ate for primary-age school children.
Sarah had freedom to design her own physical education
program. She explained that as a result of her autonomy, she
had found it easy to adapt her teaching methods and goals of
cooperation, skill acquisition, and enhancement of students'
self-esteem to her new environment. She was also able to
address theAfrican refugee students in her classes quite well.
Unlike Joe, who taught 15 of the 71 African refugee students
who attended his school, Sarah as a primary physical educa-
tion teacher would teach all 89 African refugee students
across the week. The school where Sarah was teaching was
well prepared for the specific and special learning needs that
the African refugee students would require. A specialist
African teacher was placed at the school all week in the role
of a support aid, but, as described by Sarah, this teacher was
also very much like a "tribal/elder" figure to the students and
was a member of the local African community. She was a
contact between the school and the parents, as well as dou-
bling as a translator for both the students and parents when
communicating with the school and teachers.
Sarah, being a physical education specialist in the school,
was the only physical education teacher present. She
acknowledged that at times this was difficult but neverthe-
less made good friends and contacts with the other teachers
who were teaching at the school. Sarah added,
It could get a little lonely sometimes with no other teachers to
talk to on the subject matter of PE; but most of the time it was
fine; and there were always an abundance of students willing to
come up and chat and want to play.
Although there were good support structures in place
within the school and with the aid of a local African com-
munity liaison officer also placed in the school, Sarah
acknowledges that she did have some challenging moments.
One such challenge which she recalls quite freely was a
lunch time playground duty that she was doing, and a large
school yard fight broke out between a number of the older
African and Lebanese boys on the playground. She felt
quite intimidated at attempting to step in and break up the
fight as not all of the boys were small and tiny. She
comments,
This one day when I was on playground duty I was quite scared
and intimidated for both myself and the boys fighting in case
one of them got seriously hurt. Attempting to move in and break
up the fight was also quiet confronting.
Asked about her thoughts on her education and being
properly trained to deal with these types of students, Sarah
was very complimentary and praise-worthy of her pre-
teacher education training:
I really enjoyed my Uni course and I believe that it properly
prepared me for the students that I would be teaching. It gave me
a great core knowledge set that, of course, I have added to since
beginning teaching, but I was never led to believe that my Uni
course would provide me with all of the answers . . . and guess
what, it didn't! But I believe it provided me with the necessary
skill set to get my job done and done well!
Beginning Teacher's Common Experiences for All
Participants
Each of the beginning teachers described how throughout
their first full year of teaching physical education in the vari-
ous schools they encountered difficult and confronting
moments, not only with the African refugee students in their
classes but also the mainstream White Anglo-Saxon stu-
dents. Although each case was different, there were some
similarities that occurred among all eight teachers. Six fac-
tors were identified as being the most significant characteris-
tics common to each of the beginning teachers: the physical
education facilities; the presence or absence of teaching col-
leagues; the scheduling of physical education classes; the
community environment; communication among staff, stu-
dents, and parents; and the actual students.
In addition to the six significant factors that were explic-
itly identified by the participants as influential during their
first year of teaching, important contextual conditions could
be inferred from close examination of the interview tran-
scripts. Unarticulated factors (Clandinin & Connelly, 1994)
were implicit in many of the stories, and some of these
appeared to be sufficiently common to the first-year experi-
ence to represent additional themes of influence in the pro-
cess of learning to teach physical education in schools. These
unarticulated factors included the following: the role of
physical education in the schools, the teachers' sense of effi-
cacy, the teachers'understanding of refugee students, and the
realities of teaching in school versus what the teacher
expected while at university (see Table 2).
The themes in Table 2 summarize the results of this study
and respond to the research questions. The discussion that
follows does not attend to the themes individually, but
focuses instead on several subtle points within the themes.
The beginning teachers in this study were characteristic of
many first-year teachers in that they were expected to per-
form the same duties as a seasoned veteran in the education
Baldwin 7
system. Although many of the participants were assigned
mentors, the participants found these mentors to be of little
help beyond learning the daily routines of the school.
Also, like other beginning teachers, most of the novices
experienced "reality shock" (Ibrahim, 2012), but in the case
of these beginning teachers, there was an additional cultural
shock with the teaching of African refugee students. Nearly
all participants reported that they had not anticipated such
inadequate facilities, their rigorous teaching schedules, or
the lack of support received from supervisors and colleagues,
especially in terms of how best to include and cater for the
diverse learning needs of the refugee students. Moreover,
with few exceptions, their stories indicate that they were not
prepared to confront the social and cultural forces within the
school community with respect to the refugee students.
The nature of physical education and its consequent place
within the school and wider community clearly indicated to
a number of the beginning teachers that they were teaching a
subject which is not regarded as having a high status. In
terms of facilities, a number of the teachers were forced to
conduct their classes in areas and with time allocations that
were less than adequate for instruction and were forced to do
so with fewer resources than would be considered minimally
adequate in the classroom. Sarah seemed to be the only
teacher in the group who had adequate equipment and facili-
ties to conduct her lessons. The remainder spoke quite poorly
of their physical education setups. Grace and Damien's situ-
ation exemplifies their beliefs that facilities strongly influ-
ence their curriculum and their goals for their students. Grace
and Damien's reactions to their facilities were typical of
many participants in this study:
The conditions in the school for teaching and assessing physical
education are a total joke. I have a lopped sided basketball court
that is on a 45degree slope, a small cow paddock oval that I am
not allowed to use as it seems there may have been asbestos
buried underneath it, and I have a hall that swelters in the heat
because there is no air-conditioning, not to mention the hand me
down bats and balls I have which pre-date World War II. (Grace)
It's a concrete jungle, I have next to no room at all to do practical
classes on site, which means for most of my classes I have to
take the students down to the local park which is a good 10
minute walk down and 10 minute walk back, which means I'm
spending 1/3 of my lesson traveling to and from the oval. It's
just not good! (Damien)
Mixed messages were reported about the presence of a
colleague teacher. Some of the participants who did not have
a colleague teacher present indicated that this allowed great
flexibility for them as a teacher in how they taught and pro-
grammed their classes. This absence was generally reported
in primary schools. These teachers who did not have a col-
league present also indicated that it would have been nice for
someone to let them know that what they were doing in class
was correct. The participant teachers that did have a col-
league present were a little uncomfortable as they indicated
it was like they were back doing their practicums and needed
to be supervised at all times. Lyndal and Matthew indicated
their feelings on a colleague teacher being with them during
some of their lessons:
It was kind of a catch twenty-two situation. On one hand I didn't
like it because I am a qualified teacher now and don't need to be
supervised at every point of my lesson, while on the other hand
it was handy to have someone there at different times to support

me and back me up, so yeah, difficult to give a definitive positive
or negative attribute to it. (Lyndal)
Having completed my practicums already and had supervising
teachers and university supervisors sitting in on my lessons, I
thought I had done and completed all of that, so to have someone
back in my lessons again was quite daunting and difficult.
(Matthew)
The scheduling of classes while not a hugely negative
area for the beginning teachers still proved to have some
frustrations. Generally, these surrounded the lack of commu-
nication surrounding the timing of classes. This tended to be
an issue more so with the high school teachers who taught a
combination of theory and practical-based lessons. The pri-
mary school teachers did not have a choice in classes as they
taught practical lessons all day. The community environ-
ments were also not a hugely negative experience for the stu-
dents; however, two participants did mention that this was
the worst part of their physical education lessons, when tak-
ing the students down to the local park. Ebony and Peter
commented,
Taking 12-year-olds down the road to the park is hard enough at
the best of times, combine this when you have a group of
students that have never been able to walk down the road in their
own country for fear of being chased or attacked and you can
imagine that a simple 5 minute walk can end up taking the better
part of the entire lesson because they stop at every house to look
and stare and talk. (Ebony)
Whilst it is not ideal having to walk students down to the local
park for their PE lessons I guess it is what it is so I try and make
the most of it; using this walk as part of, or, your warm-up and
cool-down activities. This is one way I have tried to make the
most of it, but in all honesty I hate it! 20 minutes of my lessons
are wasted doing this and to make matters worse the students
sometimes need to get changed as well which wastes even more
time. (Peter)
Communication proved to be a critical issue that all of the
beginning teachers identified as needing to be improved in
the schools where they were teaching. Whether it was com-
munication between colleagues and themselves, between
students and themselves, or parents and themselves, overall
the participants felt that this was an area that let them down
considerably. The participants responded to these problems
in ways that reflected individual skills and dispositions, as
well as the unique features of each school. For example, con-
versations in the interviews often touched on the participants'
need to feel some sense of success in their day-to-day
exchanges and encounters with the staff and students. At
many of the schools, however, it was difficult to sustain any
such practical sense of accomplishment due to the high
degree of non-English speaking backgrounds that many of
the refugee students brought to the schools.
It's just that some days I feel like I have wasted my time and that
everything I have said and taught in a lesson has not been heard
or taken in by the students. I leave school utterly exhausted and
I feel like I have nothing to show for all of the effort I have put
in. (Lyndal)
It can be a very frustrating job at times, I'm reminded of the old
saying you can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink
because there are some days I feel like that after having taught a
class, just really frustrated and like, I thought I had explained
myself fully but nope they still didn't get it. (Peter)
The participants reported they consciously altered both
their teaching behaviors and their teaching objectives so that
they would be more congruent with what they perceived to
be the norms of their schools. Indeed, all of the participants
who reported having to adjust their teaching styles and goals
also indicated the firm belief that if (or when) their situation
changed, they would (and could) return to their earlier teach-
ing methods.
The participants' commitment to the teaching profession
was a constant powerful message that came through the
interviews, despite the many challenges that the beginning
teachers faced. Joe acknowledged that his intentions were to
keep trying to get the best out of all of his students:
It's been a long and challenging year . . . there have been times
when I have felt like it wasn't worth it, but overall I feel as
though I did achieve something . . . and it can only get easier
from here!
Joe's sense of efficacy in his teaching was not attained
through his students' level of achievement and participation,
but rather by his feeling that he had made a difference in their
personal lives and instilled some thought of the importance
of physical education.
Many of these beginning teachers were able to look
beyond the limitations of their schools, their university edu-
cation, and their experience and feel at least some sense of
having done worthy work. Although it may have been neces-
sary to modify their initial intentions and plans of what
would work in the classroom with the students, many of
these teachers were able to look forward to a second year in
the same school with a degree of optimism. There were,
however, some teachers who believed the cultural and social
climates and difficulties that they encountered in their first
year within the school and community were just too difficult
and would not improve. Those teachers decided not to leave
teaching but to leave their present posting in search of a
school that might provide better support.
I'll be back next year, bigger and stronger and more prepared,
it's a challenge, but life isn't easy and I like a challenge! And
now that I have some experience under my belt it can only get
easier from here.

It has been a tough year, I have often questioned myself during
the year if teaching was in fact the right career choice for me,
and after this year I think the answer is no. I don't know if it is
the stress, the work demands, the students, or all of it combined,
perhaps it has just been this school and if I went to some other
school things may be different? I don't know what I will do next
year. (Joe).
Conclusion
The results of this study, when added and compared with the
information provided in the literature, suggest that despite
some modest efforts, many primary and secondary schools
provide inadequate support for beginning teachers. First-
year physical education teachers, like other beginning teach-
ers, still learn the ropes alone, especially if they are employed
as a physical education specialist in a primary school.
Moreover, the subject matter of physical education presents
unique problems in accomplishing the transition to profes-
sional teaching because of its need on equipment and timeta-
bling, and its constant need to advocate itself against other
key learning areas (Hardy, 1999; Sparkes et al., 1993).
This study has highlighted the challenges beginning
teachers face; in particular, the uniqueness of integrating and
including a number of African refugee students into their
classes which this study has highlighted. The study provides
insight into how eight first-year physical education teachers
engaged with African refugee students in their physical edu-
cation lessons.
The study has also highlighted the need for further inves-
tigation into the area of refugee education in Australian
schools especially given the vast number of refugee students
that migrate to Australia. There is limited research that
focuses on linking experiences with refugee education and
the area of physical education. The current study has high-
lighted the benefits of integrating refugee students into
school-based education and therefore, this issue needs fur-
ther, more detailed, research to investigate the benefits on a
larger, more long-term, scale.
At the time of the last interview, six of the participants had
intended to remain at their schools. Ebony and Joe had
sought and found employment as physical education teach-
ers at other schools. Despite their struggles to reconcile what
was promoted in their teacher education programs with what
was possible in their schools, all participants wanted to con-
tinue teaching physical education.
