ABSTRACT
The contribution of astrocytes to the pathophysiology of
AD (Alzheimer's disease) and the molecular and signalling
mechanisms that potentially underlie them are still very
poorly understood. However, there is mounting evidence
that calcium dysregulation in astrocytes may be playing a
key role. Intercellular calcium waves in astrocyte networks
in vitro can be mechanically induced after Ab (amyloid b-
peptide) treatment, and spontaneously forming intercel-
lular calcium waves have recently been shown in vivo in an
APP (amyloid precursor protein)/PS1 (presenilin 1)
Alzheimer's transgenic mouse model. However, spontan-
eous intercellular calcium transients and waves have not
been observed in vitro in isolated astrocyte cultures in
response to direct Ab stimulation in the absence of
potentially confounding signalling from other cell types.
Here, we show that Ab alone at relatively low concentra-
tions is directly able to induce intracellular calcium
transients and spontaneous intercellular calcium waves in
isolated astrocytes in purified cultures, raising the
possibility of a potential direct effect of Ab exposure on
astrocytes in vivo in the Alzheimer's brain. Waves did not
occur immediately after Ab treatment, but were delayed by
many minutes before spontaneously forming, suggesting
that intracellular signalling mechanisms required sufficient
time to activate before intercellular effects at the network
level become evident. Furthermore, the dynamics of
intercellular calcium waves were heterogeneous, with
distinct radial or longitudinal propagation orientations.
Lastly, we also show that changes in the expression levels
of the intermediate filament proteins GFAP (glial fibrillary
acidic protein) and S100B are affected by Ab-induced
calcium changes differently, with GFAP being more
dependent on calcium levels than S100B.

INTRODUCTION
AD (Alzheimer's disease) is a devastating age-related
neurodegenerative disorder. Neuropathological hallmarks of
AD include loss of neurons, deposition of neuritic plaques and
reactive astrogliosis in affected brain regions, particularly the
hippocampus and neocortex (Masliah, 2008). Accumulation
of Ab (amyloid b-peptide) fragments and sustained disrup-
tion of intracellular calcium concentration ([Ca2+]i
) homoeo-
stasis are prevailing hypotheses for the pathogenesis of AD
(Hardy and Selkoe, 2002; Stutzmann et al., 2004).
The role and contribution of astrocytes to the patho-
physiology of AD and the molecular and signalling mechan-
isms that potentially underlie them are still very poorly
understood. Calcium signalling in astrocytes in the form of
intracellular calcium transients and intercellular calcium
waves putatively play critical roles in neuronal足astrocytic
bidirectional communication (Pasti et al., 1997; Scemes and

Giaume, 2006; Fellin, 2009), and potentially modulate
neuronal activity and survival (Parri et al., 2001; Takano et
al., 2006). There is mounting evidence that [Ca2+]i
dysregula-
tion in astrocytes contributes to the pathophysiology of AD.
Intracellular calcium transients associated with Ab exposure
in astrocytes result in calcium-dependent glutathione
depletion in neurons and the formation of reactive oxygen
species in astrocytes that directly produce neuronal death
(Abramov et al., 2003, 2004). Cytoplasmic calcium transient
changes in presenilin-transfected astrocytes induced by
pharmacological treatment with ATP or glutamate in the
presence of Ab required lower concentrations of these
agonists for responses to manifest themselves (Johnston et
al., 2006). Intercellular calcium waves in astrocyte networks
in vitro can be mechanically induced after Ab treatment, and
they travel further and faster than comparable waves induced
in the absence of Ab (Haughey and Mattson, 2003).
Importantly, spontaneously forming intercellular calcium
waves have recently been shown in vivo in the APP (amyloid
precursor protein)/PS1 (presenilin 1) Alzheimer's transgenic
mouse model independent of neuronal hyperactivity
(Kuchibhotla et al., 2009), although the nature of the
experiments did not allow testing whether Ab itself was
responsible and sufficient for the observed waves or whether
there was a signalling effect from other cell types (e.g.
microglia). Spontaneous intercellular calcium waves have not
been observed in vitro in isolated astrocyte cultures in
response to direct Ab stimulation. The consequences of these
waves on neuronal physiology or the clinical manifestation of
AD are not yet known.
Changes in intracellular calcium levels have also been
implicated in the regulation of gene expression in both
neurons and astrocytes (Dolmetsch et al., 1998; Morita et al.,
2003). Hence it is possible that changes in astrocytic calcium
dynamics induced by Ab may molecularly contribute to the
pathogenesis of AD. Reactive astrogliosis in AD characterized
by up-regulation of GFAP (glial fibrillary acidic protein) and
S100B (Peskind et al., 2001; Pamplona et al., 2005) is
associated with Ab plaques and the formation of abnormal
neurites that contribute to the formation of neuritic plaques
and neurofibrillary tangles (Casas et al., 2004). The molecular
and cellular consequences of intracellular calcium dysregula-
tion in neurons in AD and its effects on neurotoxicity are well
documented (LaFerla, 2002), but little is known regarding the
molecular response of astrocyte calcium signalling to Ab
exposure and its effects on the cell.
In the present study, we show that Ab alone at relatively low
concentrations is directly able to induce intracellular calcium
transients and spontaneous intercellular calcium waves in
isolated astrocytes in purified cultures, raising the possibility of
a potential direct effect of Ab exposure on astrocytes in vivo in
the Alzheimer's brain. Waves did not occur immediately after
Ab treatment, but were delayed by many minutes before
spontaneously forming, suggesting that intracellular signalling
mechanisms required sufficient time to activate before
intercellular effects at the network level become evident.
Furthermore, the dynamics of intercellular calcium waves were
heterogeneous, with distinct radial or longitudinal propagation
orientations. Lastly, we also show that changes in GFAP and
S100B expression levels are affected by Ab-induced calcium
changes differently, with GFAP being more dependent on
calcium levels than S100B, which was up-regulated after
exposure to Ab independent of calcium levels.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Astrocyte cell culture
All experiments were carried out in accordance with approved
protocols from the Institutional Animal Care and Use
Committee of the University of California (San Diego, CA,
U.S.A.). Primary cortical cultures were prepared from postnatal
day 1 Sprague足Dawley rats (Harlan Sprague Dawley,
Indianapolis, IN, U.S.A.) as previously described (Haughey and
Mattson, 2003). Briefly, 1-day-old Sprague足Dawley rat pups
were sacrificed by anaesthesia overdose. Their brains were
removed and the cerebral cortices dissected in sterile KHB
(Krebs Hepes buffer; 10 mM Hepes, 4.2 mM NaHCO3
, 10 mM
dextrose, 1.18 mM MgSO4
?2H2
O, 1.18 mM KH2
PO4
, 4.69 mM
KCl, 118 mM NaCl and 1.29 mM CaCl2
; pH 7.3). Cells were
mechanically dissociated in KHB through a 70 mm cell strainer
(BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) and cultured in Modified
Eagle's Medium (Cellgro/Fisher, Herndon, VA, U.S.A.) with 10%
(v/v) heat-inactivated horse serum (Omega Scientific, Tarzana,
CA, U.S.A.), 1% penicillin足streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, U.S.A.) and 1% Glut-Max (Gibco/Invitrogen).
Before trypsinizing the cell cultures, they were hand shaken for
5 min, resulting in the detachment of contaminating cell types
such as oligodendrocytes and microglia sitting on top of the
astroglial monolayer. Manual shaking resulted in microglia-free
cultures similar to plates purified by shaking in an orbital shaker
for at least 12 h. For both approaches, we tested for microglia
using immunocytochemistry and saw no significant differences
(results not shown). Astroglial cultures were trypsinized and
subcultured once to obtain highly enriched astroglial cultures
(.95% astrocytes) (Saura, 2007). Culture medium was changed
twice per week, and all cultures were used within 2 passages.
Astrocytes were trypsinized and plated on to PDL (poly-D-
lysine)-coated 35 mm glass bottom dishes (MakTek, Ashland,
MA, U.S.A.) at a density of 16105 cells per well. Cells were
allowed to grow at 37属C and 5% CO2
/95% atmospheric air to
confluency (,90%) prior to performing calcium imaging
studies and immunocytochemistry.
Calcium imaging
Cortical astrocyte cultures of ,90% confluency were washed
twice with KHB and incubated with 8 mM Fluo-4AM (Fluo-4
acetoxymethyl ester; Molecular Probes/Invitrogen, Carlsbad,
S-K Chow and others

CA, U.S.A.) in KHB for 40 min at room temperature (25属C).
Excess dye was removed by washing twice with KHB, and an
additional incubation of 20 min at room temperature was
performed to equilibrate intracellular dye concentration.
Under specific experimental conditions, cells were pretreated
for 30 min in 10 mM thapsigargin (T9033; Sigma) or 10 mM
BAPTA/AM [1,2-bis-(o-aminophenoxy)ethane-N,N,N9,N9-
tetra-acetic acid tetrakis(acetoxymethyl ester); A1076;
Sigma]. Calcium-free KHB with 1.5 mM BAPTA (A4926;
Sigma) was also used in certain experiments. Typically, 5 mM
of Ab fragment 1足40 (A1075; Sigma), an amyloid fragment
known to be neurotoxic in vivo and in vitro (Emre et al., 1992;
Kowall et al., 1992), was used in the experiment, and the time
point of Ab dosing was regarded as zero time. We did nine
intercellular calcium experiments, with 8足10 randomly
selected fields of view observed for each, during which
real-time movies of 4.5 min were taken of primary astrocyte
cultures at three time points (0, 15 and 30 min) under five
conditions (control, Ab, Ab+thapsigargin, Ab+BAPTA/AM and
Ab+BAPTA). In each experiment, 5 mM of Ab was bath applied
and 4.5 min movies were recorded at randomly chosen fields
for 1.5 h and seven time points (0, 15, 30, 45, 60, 75 and 90
min post-administration of Ab). All movies were acquired at 5
Hz using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER digital camera (Hamamatsu
Photonics, Hamamatsu City, Japan). Visualization of Ca2+
indicator dye fluorescence was done using a 488 nm (FITC)
filter on an Olympus IX81 inverted fluorescence confocal
microscope (Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) using a 620
UPlanFLN objective (NA50.5; Olympus Optical). Images were
acquired with custom-written LabVIEW (National
Instruments, Austin, TX, U.S.A.) software developed in our
laboratory. Similar experiments were performed with the
non-bioactive control of Ab 1足40, where we used a reverse
40足1 Ab (A2326; Sigma). Images were subsequently pro-
cessed in ImageJ (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/) and Matlab
(Mathworks, Natick, MA, U.S.A.).
Quantification of Ca2+ transients
Quantification of Ca2+ transients was performed using
methods similar to those described previously (Yu et al.,
2009). Briefly, using ImageJ [an NIH (National Institutes of
Health; Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.)-funded open source JAVA-
based morphometric application], individual cell fluorescence
intensity versus time was extracted. The fluorescence
intensity of Fluo-4AM is assumed to be proportional to
calcium concentration. The data were run through a low pass
filter and a running average filter of 10 frames implemented
in Matlab. In order to identify individual [Ca2+]i
transients, we
identified periods of sustained increase in fluorescence
intensity for each centroid. A first-derivative filter was used
to distinguish significant and sustained increases in calcium
(i.e. 10 or more consecutive frames or 2 s at 5 Hz, with
positive derivative values). Cells with sustained calcium
increases were considered to have transient responses. The
percentage of active cells was the ratio of the number of cells
that displayed calcium transients to the total number of cells
in the field of view, while the average transient frequency (in
Hz) was the ratio of the total number of transients to the
number of active cells acquired per movie. For the observed
calcium waves, the average speed of calcium wave propaga-
tion was calculated by plotting the radius from the centre of
the wave against activation time of the cell involved and
fitting the slope of the line through the scatter plot. All
calculations and graphs were done using Matlab and
SigmaPlot (Systat, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.), and the results were
expressed as means臓S.E.M. In all the cases, consistent
imaging settings were used across experimental conditions
and individual experiments (e.g. frame rates, exposure times
etc.).
GFAP and S100B immunocytochemistry
Cultures grown on PDL-coated dishes were fixed with 4%
(w/v) paraformaldehyde in PBS for 15 min. Cells were
permeabilized in 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 and incubated for
2 h with mouse monoclonal anti-S100B antibody (S2657;
Sigma) or mouse anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (anti-
GFAP;556330; BD Biosciences), diluted 1:100 and 1:400
respectively with 10% (v/v) FBS (foetal bovine serum). Goat
anti-mouse IgG (whole antibody)足FITC (F0257; Sigma) was
diluted 1:100 in PBS with 5% FBS and applied for 1 h. Cells
were mounted with ProLong Gold antifade reagent counter-
stained with DAPI (49,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole; Molecular
Probes/Invitrogen). Images were acquired using the same
hardware as described previously and a 640 LUCPlanFLN
objective (NA50.6; Olympus Optical), with filters for FITC,
TRITC (tetramethylrhodamine b-isothiocyanate) and DAPI
using the same customized LabVIEW software used for
calcium imaging.
RESULTS
Ab increases the frequency of intracellular
calcium transients and the number of activated
astrocytes
In cultured cortical astrocytes, 5 mM of Ab 1足42 is sufficient
to alter evoked intercellular calcium waves and to result in
increased amplitude, velocity and travelling distance com-
pared with untreated controls (Haughey and Mattson, 2003).
Dosing levels of Ab 1足40, 25足35 and 1足42 at 10 mM have
been reported to increase the expression of GFAP and S100B
in cultured astrocytes (Meske et al., 1998). In both studies,
astrocytic toxicity from Ab at these concentrations was not
observed. We began by doing a number of experiments using
a range of Ab 1足40 up to a concentration of 10 mM, and did
not observe differences in the results compared with the use
of 5 mM (results not shown). Given the previous work by these

other investigators and our own preliminary experiments, we
used 5 mM as the working concentration of Ab in all our
subsequent experiments.
Compared with untreated controls, Ab-treated cultures
had a significantly larger percentage of cells that displayed
intracellular calcium transients (92臓3.5% versus 81臓5.3%,
P,0.05; Figure 1A). Furthermore, active cells under Ab-
treated conditions that showed transient responses had on
average a higher frequency of responses relative to active
cells in controls (0.05臓0.003 Hz versus 0.033臓0.001 Hz,
P,0.001; Figure 1B). In all cases, we measured baseline levels
of calcium transient response frequencies before exposure to
Ab for 90 s, and with results statistically similar to untreated
Ab controls. The quality and signal-to-noise ratio of
measured transient responses for both experimental and
control conditions were comparable (Figure 1C). Ab-induced
increases were significantly reduced by the perturbation of
intracellular and extracellular calcium sources, suggesting
that the observed changes were directly due to calcium-
dependent mechanisms. Pretreatment with thapsigargin,
which raises cytosolic calcium levels by preventing the
pumping of calcium back into the endoplasmic reticulum,
diminished both the number of active cells and the transient
response frequency increase evoked by Ab (39臓14% in
thapsigargin-treated cells versus 92臓3.5% for Ab-treated
cells alone, P,0.01; and 0.011臓0.001 Hz in thapsigargin-
treated cells versus 0.05臓0.003 Hz for Ab-treated cells alone,
P,0.001). BAPTA/AM, which is a calcium chelator, completely
abolished the increase in response frequency induced by Ab
(0.033 Hz in Ab-BAPTA/AM versus 0.033 Hz in controls),
whereas removal of extracellular Ca2+ ([Ca2+]e
) caused a 2-
fold decrease in the increased frequency response. In
addition, a lack of [Ca2+]e
sharply reduced the number of
active cells that displayed calcium transients at 15 min after

Ab dosing from 99臓1.6% to 1.5臓0.9% (P,0.001), suggesting
an important role for the influx of extracellular Ca2+ on the
effects of Ab. Control experiments using the biologically
inactive reverse 40足1 Ab did not show any changes in the
frequency of calcium transient responses in individual cells or
the fraction of active cells relative to untreated controls (results
not shown). The effects of Ab on calcium transients lasted for at
least 45 min after dosing. We did not use data beyond 45 min in
order to avoid potential confounding effects due to unrelated
changes in the cultures, such as decreasing cell viability with
time, even though we routinely confirmed good cell viability
after the 45 min experimental window by using a calcein/
ethidium live/dead cell cytotoxicity assay.
Ab induces spontaneous time-delayed
intercellular calcium waves in astrocytes
Previous work has shown that mechanically induced inter-
cellular calcium waves in astrocyte cultures pretreated with
Ab travel longer distances and at greater speeds than induced
waves in control cultures not treated with Ab (Haughey and
Mattson, 2003). In vivo in the APP/SP1 transgenic mouse
model of AD, spontaneous waves in astrocyte networks have
been seen (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009). We examined whether
Ab by itself is sufficient to directly induce spontaneous waves
in culture in isolated astrocytes. We bath applied Ab and
recorded movies of randomly chosen fields of view in 15 min
intervals for 90 min after Ab treatment. In contrast with
untreated control cultures, which never showed any res-
ponses, all of the 8足10 randomly chosen fields in eight of the
nine Ab-treated independent experiments displayed spon-
taneous time-delayed waves. Interestingly, two distinct
patterns of calcium waves were observed: seven experiments
displayed waves that propagated radially from an initial focal
locus (Figures 2A and 2B), consistent with patterns of
induced waves reported in most studies (Cornell-Bell et al.,
1990; Newman and Zahs, 1997; Arcuino et al., 2002; Schipke
et al., 2002), whereas one experiment exhibited waves that
propagated linearly (Figures 2C and 2D). This is similar to in
vivo waves seen in the cerebellum (Hoogland et al., 2009). The
distances travelled by radial and linear waves were 75臓21
and 80.5臓11.3 mm respectively, with speeds of 7.8臓2.6 and
4.66臓0.48 mm/s respectively (Figure 2E). Both types of waves
occurred not earlier than 10 min and no later than 75 min
after Ab dosing. The significant delay between the application
of Ab and the initiation of waves suggests that metabotropic
signalling mechanisms may underlie the initiation of wave
events in astrocyte networks, and excludes the possibility that
they were the result of experimental artefacts (e.g.
mechanical disruption of cells during bath application of
Ab). We also checked for and confirmed good cell viability
after the 90 min recording period. Interestingly, some cells in
the path of the wave front were not activated and did not
display intracellular calcium transients, resulting in spatially
heterogeneous activation patterns. This is consistent with
previous results from our laboratory (Macdonald et al., 2008).
It is possible that the absence of observed waves in the one
experiment could have been due to chance if they occurred
outside our randomly chosen fields of view or during intervals
between successive recordings, since we did not selectively
induce them in any way. Control experiments using the
reverse 40足1 Ab never showed spontaneous calcium waves,
similar to untreated controls (results not shown).
Ab induces changes in S100B and GFAP
expression in astrocytes by 12 h
Finally, we also looked at the relationship between Ab-
induced intracellular Ca2+ transients and reactive gliosis by
measuring GFAP and S100B expression levels after Ab dosing
using immunocytochemistry (Figure 3). Elevated levels of
S100B and GFAP have been shown to occur in astrocytes
associated with neuritic AD plaques (Pike et al., 1994;
Simpson et al., 2008). Two previous studies have looked at
changes in the immunocytochemical expression of GFAP,
S100B, vimentin, as well as other putative markers of reactive
gliosis (Salinero et al., 1997; Meske et al., 1998), although the
nature of the analyses and experimental preparations make a
comparison of those studies to our own results difficult: in
the former study, the authors claimed that GFAP and S100B
were up-regulated at 72 h after exposure to a number of Ab
sequences, whereas the latter study claimed that GFAP and
vimentin but not S100B were up-regulated in a subpopula-
tion of cultured cells at 24 h after exposure to the 25足35
peptide. However, both studies used astrocytes that had been
maintained in culture for very long periods of time prior to
experiments, 21 and 14 days respectively, and in both cases
they based their results on qualitative observations from
micrographs without any quantification or image analysis.
Interestingly, Meske and colleagues did not observe any
changes in calcium signalling (Meske et al., 1998).
Images of 10 randomly chosen fields (640) were taken at
three time points after Ab dosing (12, 24 and 48 h) under six
conditions (control, Ab, Ab+thapsigargin, thapsigargin,
Ab+BAPTA/AM and BAPTA/AM) in three experiments.
Differences in fluorescent intensities between experimental
conditions were similar at different time points, so we
evaluated the data for statistical significance at the earliest
time point in which we observed changes (Figure 3). We found
significant changes in S100B and GFAP expression by 12 h after
Ab exposure. The average fluorescence intensity of GFAP at this
time point was 492臓12 A.U. (arbitrary units) for controls and
637臓16 for Ab-incubated cells (P,0.001, n510 images per
sample; see the legend to Figure 3), whereas for S100B the
intensity level for Ab treated cells was 602臓21 compared with
435臓6 for controls. Thapsigargin and BAPTA by themselves
had no effect on either GFAP or S100B expression levels relative
to controls. For GFAP, the application of Ab in combination
with thapsigargin or BAPTA significantly decreased the effects
measured with Ab by itself and brought fluorescence levels
back to those observed for untreated controls (458臓9 for Ab
and thapsigargin and 468臓13 for Ab and BAPTA, P,0.001 for

both). On the other hand, S100B expression levels did not
change relative to Ab levels when challenged with Ab in
combination with thapsigargin or BAPTA, which measured
595臓25 and 627臓22 A.U. respectively.
DISCUSSION
We examined the effects of Ab on the dynamics of
spontaneous intracellular calcium transients and intercellular
calcium waves in networks of primary cortical astrocytes in
vitro, and explored Ab-induced changes in the expression of
GFAP and S100B. Ab increased the frequency of intracellular
calcium transients in individual cells and the total number of
activated astrocytes. It also induced delayed spontaneous
intercellular calcium waves. The recruitment of participating
cells and the dynamics of observed waves were spatially
heterogeneous, in the sense that not all cells within the area
affected by the wave were necessarily activated, and waves
displayed distinct radial or longitudinal directional propaga-
tion patterns. We also showed that changes in GFAP and
S100B expression levels are affected by Ab calcium levels
(Inoue, 2008; Small et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2009).
Our present results are the first to demonstrate that Ab is
able to produce temporally delayed spontaneous intercellular

calcium waves in isolated astrocytes independent of the
contribution of other putative signalling cues. Astrocytic
intercellular calcium waves have previously been associated
with neuropathological phenomena such as spreading depres-
sion (Haughey and Mattson, 2003; Peters et al., 2003). Ab-
induced waves in our experiments exhibited propagation
distances and speeds similar to previously reported values in
the range of 20足100 mm and 5足20 mm/s (Dani et al., 1992;
Zanotti and Charles, 1997; Hamilton et al., 2008). The spatial
heterogeneity of advancing wave fronts observed in both radial
and longitudinal waves, in which not all astrocytes within the
range of a passing wave were necessarily activated or displayed
intracellular calcium transients, suggests that functional
signalling through astrocyte networks is not a passive
phenomenon but spatially and functionally complex (Sul et
al., 2004; Macdonald et al., 2008). This is consistent with
previous experimental and theoretical work from our laboratory
(Macdonald et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009). Mechanistically, the
generation and modulation of these waves is not clear and will
require further investigation. For example, ATP release from
astrocytes is enhanced in the presence of calcium and is stored
and released from dense core granules independent of gap
junctional release (Coco et al., 2003), which could putatively
play a role in modulating Ab-induced calcium waves. Indeed,
ATP vesicular release has been implicated as the principal
mechanism underlying intercellular calcium waves in astrocyte
networks, with a minimal contribution through gap junctions
(Coco et al., 2003; Bowser and Khakh, 2007; Pangrsic et al.,
2007; Zhang et al., 2007).
These results complement the work by Kuchibhotla and
colleagues (Kuchibhotla et al., 2009). These authors eliminated
putative effects of Ab-induced neuronal hyperactivity on

(B, D) Shown are mean fluorescence values, with the error bars representing 95% confidence bounds in A.U. based on image analysis
of the micrographs (see the Materials and methods section). Western blot gels were done to confirm protein expression for the
different conditions but we did not optimize for or quantify protein levels using this method. Fluorescence data were acquired using
the same exposure and gain setting in every case, and the mean fluorescence intensities of the cells were extracted as recorded on
the camera for each image. The camera sensor recorded intensity values on a 12-bit scale in A.U., from 0 to 4095. The results shown

astrocytic calcium signalling by blocking neuronal activity with
TTX (tetrodotoxin), concluding that the resultant observed
astrocytic calcium waves were due to the direct effect of Ab on
the astrocyte network. However, microglia could also modulate
astrocytic calcium signalling independent of any neuronal
contribution, and have been shown to migrate and cluster near
Ab plaque-forming areas in the hippocampus and neocortex
(Frautschy et al., 1998; Stalder et al., 1999; Hasegawa et al.,
2001). Microglia internalize microaggregates of Ab and secret
pro-inflammatory factors including IL-1b (interleukin-1b), TNF
(tumour necrosis factor) and nitric oxide, which in turn affect
calcium homoeostasis and transients in surrounding neurons
and astrocytes (Meda et al., 1995; Weldon et al., 1998; Colton et
al., 2000; Benveniste et al., 2001; Lee et al., 2002; Morita et al.,
2003). Furthermore, microglia derived from AD patients show
significantly higher basal [Ca2+]i
(McLarnon et al., 2005), and
can also cause calcium elevations in neighbouring cells by
regulating the amount of extracellular calcium (Barger and
Basile, 2001; McLarnon et al., 2006). Our results here show that
astrocytes by themselves are capable of spontaneously forming
signalling networks by initiating and propagating intercellular
calcium waves under stress conditions similar to those present
in AD in the absence of signalling factors and cues from other
cell types. The shorter distance and lower speed of the waves in
our experiments compared with those reported by Kuchibhotla
et al. (2009) may be due to an augmented effect caused by
other cell types or signalling factors in vivo missing from the
reduced in vitro preparations we studied. The molecular and
cellular mechanisms that produce these waves and any effects
on the pathophysiology of AD are yet to be confirmed in vivo
and will require much further investigation.
Lastly, in our experiments, Ab induced changes in the protein
expression of both S100B and GFAP by 12 h after exposure to
the peptide. Measured relative changes of normalized fluor-
escence intensity levels of anti-GFAP and anti-S100B signals in
immunocytochemistry have been used as reliable markers
associated with reactive gliosis (Dyer and Cepko, 2000; Wu et
al., 2003; Pathak et al., 2009). We also observed a dependency
between [Ca2+]i
and the expression levels of GFAP after
exposure to Ab. Reducing [Ca2+]i
by chelating with BAPTA or
applying thapsigargin reduced GFAP levels to those measured
under control conditions. Thus it appears that changes in GFAP
expression are dependent on changes in calcium homoeostasis
induced by Ab, rather than a direct effect of Ab itself. S100B
levels, on the other hand, were not affected by application of
BAPTA or thapsigargin, suggesting a potentially more direct
effect of Ab on S100B up-regulation. Interestingly, GFAP plays
a role in trafficking of dense core vesicles containing ANF (atrial
natriuretic factor) (Pangrsic et al., 2007); and since intercellular
calcium waves in astrocytes are mediated primarily by vesicular
ATP, this could play a role in the pathological propagation of
signals throughout the astrocytic network.
The pathophysiology of AD is multidimensional and
complex. While previous efforts have focused on the effects
of Ab on neurons, the results we present here add to other
work implicating a potential, but as yet poorly understood,
role for astrocytes in the pathogenesis of AD. The picture that
is emerging, however, is one where astrocytes directly and
robustly respond to the presence of Ab in a number of ways
known to affect the health and function of neurons. It is
likely that a complete understanding of the pathology of AD
will require an understanding of the metabolic and functional
responses and effects that astrocytes have. Such an
understanding may suggest novel pharmacological targets
to either slow down or reverse the resultant neuronal death.
