Abstract
Support for radical parties on both the left and right is on the rise, fueling intuition that
both radicalisms have similar underpinnings. Indeed, existing studies show that radical
left and right voters have overlapping positions and preferences. In this article, however,
we focus on the differences in the voting bases of such parties. We show that radical
left and right voters have sharply diverging ideological profiles. When it comes to
the historical traditions of the `left' and `right', these voters differ radically
from each other. Both groups express the traditions associated with their mainstream
counterparts--particularly with respect to (non-)egalitarian, (non-)altruistic, and (anti-)
cosmopolitan values. Such differences also explain why radical left voters tend to be
more, not less, educated than mainstream or radical right voters.

Introduction
Radicalisms of both the left and the right have been gaining electoral ground in
advanced democracies. In the United States, Donald Trump surprised friend and
foe with his election to the US Presidency, and during the primaries Bernie Sanders
managed to attract a large share of dissatisfied Democrats. Similar developments
have been taking place for a longer series of election cycles in Europe. Until
recently, most of the headlines concerned radical right parties. In the aftermath
of the elections to the European Parliament in May 2014, for instance, many
news outlets designated the electoral victory of the Front National (FN) in
France and the United Kingdom Independence Party (UKIP) in Britain as a
political `earthquake'.1 The recent successes of parties such as Alternative fu
¨ r
Deutschland (AfD) in Germany, Wilders' Party for Freedom (PVV) in the
Netherlands and the Movement for a better Hungary (Jobbik) also demonstrate
how radical right parties have become important political forces in almost all
European countries. Yet radical left parties have experienced a simultaneous rise
in success. Parties like Syriza in Greece and Podemos in Spain are gaining ground
electorally, attracting much journalistic and academic attention, shock, and awe
towards the radicalisms on both extremes of the political spectrum.
Important to the future of democratic governance is not just understanding the
characteristics of the parties manifesting these radicalisms, but also understanding
the motives and characteristics of voters giving radicalisms their political power and
future. Unfortunately, existing scholarly and popular discussions of radicalism
offer limited insight into what drives radical left as opposed to radical right
voters. Studies on the party level have suggested that radical left and radical
right parties have plenty in common. Both party families have been shown to be
nationalist (Burgoon, 2013; Halikiopoulou et al., 2012), eurosceptic (Hooghe et al.,
2002), and populist (Rooduijn and Akkerman, 2017). Building on the assumption
that also voters for these parties may resemble each other, two recent studies have
found that radical left and right voters share key political desires and discontents,
and come from similar social strata (Lubbers and Scheepers, 2007; Visser et al.,
2014). Although these studies have encountered important differences between the
two electorates--especially some ideological attributes and levels of education--
such differences do not constitute the central focus of study or receive a theoretical
accounting. The emphasis on commonalities instead of differences is strengthened
by the pervasiveness of the concept of `populism'. Populism is often defined as the
political message that the good people are neglected, exploited or corrupted by an
evil elite (see Mudde, 2004). This message can regularly be encountered among
both radical left- and radical right-wing politicians. The present focus on populism
increases the attention to what parties like the FN in France and Podemos in Spain
have in common instead of what divides them. The existing literature, hence,
Rooduijn et al. 537
provides a portrait of radical left and right voters in which differences are excep-
tions that prove a rule: that the similarities among radicalisms are the principal
pattern of importance to electoral democracy.
In this article we take issue with this portrait. Our main argument is that radical
left and right bases should be seen as splinters from the party families with which
they are commonly associated. While they may well share discontent and economic
vulnerabilities, they can also be expected to express the traditions and sentiments
associated with their respective mainstream counterparts, particularly with respect
to (non-)egalitarian and (non-)altruistic values, and with respect to (anti-)cosmo-
politanism that can be clearly linked to such values. We test our expectations
through analysis of European voters and support for radical right and radical
left parties, using seven waves of European Social Survey (ESS) data (from 2002
to 2014) that cover 23 countries, 26 radical right, and 23 radical left parties.
Although our analysis uncovers similarities between the support bases of the two
party families, the data also reveal major differences that manifest the legacies of
left versus right orientation.
Our findings are important to understanding contemporary democratic politics.
They reveal that, although voters for the radical left and the radical right have a lot
in common in socioeconomic terms, such voters also differ in fundamental respects
that mirror well-known differences between the mainstream left and mainstream
right. These differences can be expected to shape European politics for years to
come, not only in national political arenas, but also the supranational EU arena,
where radical left and right parties sometimes collaborate with each other, at least
within their respective party families. The distinctions between multiple radical left
and right parties suggest that national and European party systems are likely to
face increasing polarization in attitudes and positioning toward the EU, immigra-
tion, law-and-order and inequality.
Radical parties and radical voters
Radical parties on both the left and the right are increasingly successful in Europe.
As a result of, among other factors, increasing electoral volatility (Van der Meer
et al., 2012), growing media attention for radical parties (Boomgaarden and
Vliegenthart, 2007; Walgrave and De Swert, 2004), and the rising salience of issues
that these parties `own': immigration, Islam and security for the radical right; socio-
economic inequality and the financial crisis for the radical left; and European inte-
gration for both (see March, 2011; Mudde, 2007)--mainstream parties in most
European countries are now seriously challenged by at least one credible radical
party. What makes these radical parties so attractive to voters?
When it comes to the radical right, extensive study has delineated key explana-
tory characteristics (Mudde, 2007; Rooduijn, 2014; Rydgren, 2007). They are
nationalist parties, meaning that they strive for congruence of the political unit
(the state) and the cultural unit (the nation). Yet radical right parties endorse a
xenophobic form of nationalism that can be called `nativism'. In Mudde's useful
538 European Union Politics 18(4)
formulation, nativism `holds that states should be inhabited exclusively by mem-
bers of the native group (``the nation'') and that non-native elements (persons and
ideas) are fundamentally threatening to the homogeneous nation-state' (Mudde,
2007: 19). Modern European radical right parties also tend to be populist: they
employ a discourse portraying `the good people' as exploited, betrayed, neglected
or corrupted by `an evil elite' (Mudde, 2007; Rooduijn, 2014). The radical right
party family constitutes a homogeneous party family. Although radical right par-
ties often differ from each other regarding ethical issues, the party family is as or
more homogenous than are, for instance, the conservative or liberal party families
(Ennser, 2012).
Various studies have shown that those who vote for radical right parties come
from lower socioeconomic positions. Such voters are generally less educated, tend to
have lower incomes and come from `lower' social classes, and are more likely to be
unemployed (Lubbers et al., 2002; Werts et al., 2013). Moreover, socioeconomic
variables affect vote choice, mediated by attitudes like preferences toward immigra-
tion, European unification, law-and-order, and political cynicism (Arzheimer, 2009;
Ivarsflaten, 2008; Kriesi et al., 2006, 2008; Werts et al., 2013; Van der Brug et al.,
2000, 2005).
While radical right voters may tend to have lower socioeconomic positions, it does
not follow that citizens from lower socioeconomic strata are automatically inclined
to vote for the radical right. These citizens might just feel equally attracted to the
radical left. Indeed, studies of voting behavior have long found that people with
lower socioeconomic positions tend to vote for left-wing parties, whereas citizens
from higher socioeconomic strata are more likely to vote for right-wing parties
(Evans, 2000). This has made sense, as left parties have long called for decreasing
income differences by redistributing welfare, whereas right-wing parties tend to
oppose such state intervention. While differences between the traditional left and
right have blurred over the years, radical left parties continue to decry the skewed
socioeconomic structure of contemporary capitalism, and to advocate reducing
inequalities through far-reaching redistribution and through major changes in eco-
nomic and power structures (March, 2011: 8­9). Radical left parties also strongly
criticize the `neo-liberal' character of global and European economic integration.
This agenda should appeal to the same lower-class, economically vulnerable voters
associated with radical right parties. Ramiro (2016) has indeed found that those who
vote for radical left parties tend to be those who identify with the working class.
Radical distinction
Studies of radical right and radical left parties uncover, as expected, patterns
of support broadly in line with such possibilities. Both party families have been
found in their position-taking to be broadly nationalist (Burgoon, 2013;
Halikiopoulou et al., 2012), eurosceptic (Hooghe et al., 2002), and populist
(Rooduijn and Akkerman, 2017). As for voters for radical parties, Lubbers and
Scheepers (2007) found that citizens with lower incomes and from lower classes
Rooduijn et al. 539
(manual workers) are more inclined to vote for both the radical left and right.2
Visser et al. (2014) come to similar conclusions, focusing on the subjective position-
ing of citizens as extreme left or right based on their self-placement on a 0 to 10 left-
to-right scale. These studies have unearthed important differences between radical
left and right voters. Supporters of the radical right tend to be less educated than
other voters, while voters for the radical left tend to be more educated. And Visser
et al. (2014) find attitudinal differences between the radical left and right, revealing
distinct orientations on redistribution and ethnic diversity. In these studies,
however, such differences are not explained or further examined theoretically
or empirically. Indeed, the broad tenor of existing studies is that the individual
socioeconomic profiles of support for the radical left and right are more common
than distinct.
It is important to look more closely, however, into differences between radical left
and radical right voters, and to explore whether support for radical left and radical
right parties reflects, or fundamentally departs from, the orientations of the party
families with which they stem. Well-known differences between left and right with
respect to the state and markets may in some respects fade and in other respects get
amplified once one gets to the radical left and right. In any event, empirical differ-
ences characterize support for the radical left and for the radical right, belying any
simple explanation--for instance the higher education levels of radical left compared
to radical right supporters. These patterns and enigmas need fuller examination
in light of what `left' and `right' mean in contemporary politics--reckoning with
single or multi-dimensional conceptions of the electoral political space (cf. Van der
Brug et al., 2000; Van der Brug and Van Spanje, 2009).
Argument: The party-ideological roots of distinct radicalisms
We argue that differences in voter support for radical left and for radical right
parties--that is, `radical distinctions'--reflect the socioeconomic interests but also
normative preferences associated with the broader and deeper historical traditions
of the `left' and `right'. Whether voter positions underlie or are cued by party
orientations (Ezrow et al., 2011), voters supporting the radical left and right can
be expected to share important commonalities but also to be divided by differences
in economic positions and social attitudes. On the one hand, both party families
have traditions favoring representation of socially and economically disadvantaged
citizens, and both traditions share extreme offshoots from mainstream movements,
expressing outspoken political and economic discontent, distrust, and protest. On the
other hand, classic and well-known left-right distinctions predict very different nor-
mative bases for the radical left and right. Radical left supporters, in direct contrast
to their radical right counterparts, can be expected to harbor economically egalitar-
ian and altruistic views. These crucial distinctions, in turn, can be expected to under-
gird important differences in the way radical left and right voters view the promise
and pitfalls of globalization. All such differences, finally, make sense of the stark
contrast in the education levels of radical left and right voters.
540 European Union Politics 18(4)
We argue that radical left and radical right voters are, like mainstream voters,
ideological voters (see Van der Brug et al., 2000). Radical voters' attitudes about
the policy issues they deem important are decisive for vote choice, such that
voters choose a party that is ideologically proximate. This often boils down to
a choice for a party with either a left-wing or a right-wing ideology.3 Once this
main ideological choice is made, other factors determine for which specific party
an individual votes. We believe that those with lower socioeconomic positions are
more likely to vote for radical parties because these parties better address their
economic struggles and political concerns (see below). Hence, a voter with a low
socioeconomic status (SES) who is politically and economically discontented and
holds a left-wing ideology will likely vote for a radical left party, whereas a
similar voter with right-wing positions will be prone to vote for a radical right
party. In other words, both radical left and right voters will most likely have
lower socioeconomic positions and stronger feelings of economic and political
discontent compared to the average voter. However, they will be completely dif-
ferent from each other in terms of their principal voting motivations: their main
ideological attitudes.
This puts the onus on where and how the relevant ideological attitudes are
overlapping or contrasting. We argue that one can deduce areas of both overlap
and contrast from the histories of broader left and right party families. We begin by
discussing the areas of overlap, or similarities, but we focus more on differences,
developing three sets of hypotheses on how radical left and radical right diverge in
their ideological positioning: Hypotheses on normative-ideological differences con-
cerning (economic) egalitarianism and the responsibilities and role of government
in support of such egalitarianism; hypotheses on differences on issues of national-
ism versus cosmopolitanism; and hypotheses on differences concerning the charac-
ter and implications of a voter's education.
Shared interests and discontents
Both radical left and right parties, in contrast to their mainstream counterparts, are
focused on representing the social and economically vulnerable to have grown
frustrated with the mainstream. This shared focus, whatever its particular origins,
predicts that the socioeconomic interests and profiles of those supporting the rad-
ical left and right ought to converge. Economic and demographic conditions that
have been found to cause or select for economic risk or vulnerability--lower-class
professional orientation, unemployment, low income--can therefore be expected to
distinguish both radical right and radical left voters from their mainstream
counterparts.
Both radical left and radical right voters have also been shown to share strong
anger towards conventional politics and the economy. They often express deep
dissatisfaction with the functioning and stewardship of the economy and govern-
ment, and express low trust in politicians and political institutions (Rydgren, 2007).
Their party platforms often have at their center radical changes to government
Rooduijn et al. 541
institutions and policies, albeit usually within the ambit of the democratic process
(see March, 2011; Mudde, 2007).
Radical distinctions in statism and egalitarianism
Beyond these important commonalities, the normative ideological traditions histor-
ically associated with left and right can be expected to attract different kinds of voters
to distinct left and right radicalisms. Consistent with the historical traditions of the
left and right in 20th century European politics, the party families sharply clash on
normative ideals related to economic justice and to the state's economic intervention
in pursuit of such justice. The first manifestation of such normative ideals is broad
economic egalitarianism. This commitment has been central to leftism of all
shades--particularly when related to economic equality of outcome or opportunity.
And it has not been shared by right-wing partisan discourse and positioning; in fact,
many right-wing parties reject such egalitarianism in favor of embracing economic
difference based on birth, ability, or wealth (Klingemann et al., 2006). This distinc-
tion on economic egalitarianism might well be part of a broader distinction with
respect to egalitarianism generally--encompassing not only economic but also pol-
itical and social equality of opportunity and condition. But we suspect that the
economic face of egalitarianism is as important as any in the ideological distinctions
between left and right. Hence, this contrast on economic egalitarianism can be
expected to yield a major difference between left and right radicalism.
H1: Voters who support economic egalitarianism (equality of opportunity and effect
in economic life) are more likely to vote for radical left parties compared to main-
stream parties, but not more likely to vote for radical right parties compared to
mainstream parties.
Related to this commitment is an other-regarding altruism or compassion histor-
ically associated with left parties and left voters--as in the Anglo-American con-
cept of `do-gooder' altruism. This pattern is less discussed as a symbol of the left.
But there is clear reliance on such rhetoric more on the left than the right, often
related to the collective ideals of fairness in opposition to Darwinian individualism
(Zettler and Hilbig, 2010). There is some substantial evidence that various mani-
festations of `altruism' and other-regarding (or `socio-tropic') concern yield more
left-wing rather than right-wing voting (Mutz and Mondak, 1997; Zettler and
Hilbig, 2010). Moreover, studies in political psychology have shown that the
Big Five personality trait of Agreeableness--characterized by trust towards
others, tolerance, and altruism (Costa et al., 1991)--also affects radical left and
right voting. Individuals scoring high on Agreeableness (i.e. those who are trustful
and altruistic) tend to be concerned about welfare and solidarity, and are more
likely to hold a left-wing ideology and vote for a (radical) left-wing party
(Chirumbolo and Leone, 2010). Those who score low on this trait, however,
have been shown more likely to experience an ``immigrant threat'', and therefore
542 European Union Politics 18(4)
more likely to vote for radical right parties (Aichholzer and Zandonella, 2016).
We deduce from this pattern that altruism increases the likelihood of voting for the
radical left, but decreases that of voting for the radical right.4
H2: Voters who express altruism (other-regarding concern for the wellbeing of others)
are more likely to vote for radical left parties compared to mainstream parties, but less
likely to vote for radical right parties compared to mainstream parties.
The historical differences between left and right not only concern major ends, such
as economic egalitarianism, but also the means to achieve such ends. The most
important of these concerns the role of the state or government to intervene in the
economy in pursuit of egalitarian or altruist principles. This is a central dividing
line between mainstream left and right in most contemporary democracies
(Castles and Mair, 1984; Korpi, 1983). Left-wing voters and parties embrace inter-
ventionist government policies to regulate and humanize market economies and
promote egalitarianism and wellbeing of the poor. Some radical right parties have
expressed support for state interventions to help the deserving poor, albeit often
with a welfare chauvinist tendency. Yet, because such positions only touch upon
such issues, often amidst conflicting or exclusionary standards, we do not expect
radical right-wing voters to differ from mainstream voters.
H3: Voters who embrace an active government or state to intervene in the economy to
promote economic egalitarianism are more likely to vote for radical left parties com-
pared to mainstream parties, but not more likely to vote for radical right parties
compared to mainstream parties.
Radical distinctions in nationalism/anti-globalization
The above differences should also have strong implications for attitudes of radical
left and right voters with respect to globalization. Various studies show that the
left-to-right political spectrum harbors a horseshoe-shaped pattern in euroscepti-
cism of party platforms (Hooghe et al., 2002) and anti-globalization generally in
such platforms (Burgoon, 2013).5 Recent studies of radical left and right supporters
have also found this U-curve of euroscepticism to unite the two extremes
(Lubbers and Scheepers, 2007; Van Elsas and Van der Brug, 2015; Visser et al.,
2014). Providing a more nuanced portrait, Halikiopoulou et al. (2012: 504) identify
variation in the kinds of nationalism embraced in radical left and radical right
platforms--with the former engaging in more civic nationalism and the latter
more ethnic or xenophobic nationalism. Yet both radicalisms share `a common
denominator' of euroscepticism.
This portrait of radical left and radical right voters sharing strong nationalism
may need some revision in light of the arguments and hypotheses developed above.
The same SES and normative-ideological attitudes towards egalitarianism and
Rooduijn et al. 543
government economic activism that we hypothesized to undergird distinct left and
right radicalisms can be expected to strongly color the attitudes on globalization. In
particular, the socio-economic conditions and normative positioning on egalitar-
ianism can be expected to cut in the same direction for the radical right, but in
opposite directions for the radical left. For the radical right parties and their sup-
porters, low SES and anti-egalitarianism and anti-economic activism push voters
towards anti-European integration, anti-globalization, and anti-immigrant atti-
tudes. With respect to immigrants, for instance, economic insecurity for radical
right parties dovetails with their rejection of egalitarianism or equal treatment.
For radical left voters, on the other hand, the SES and attitudes on egalitarian-
ism and state activism cut in opposite directions. On the one hand, the low SES of
voters ought to make them likely `losers' of globalization, including with respect to
the skewed labor-market competition posed by immigration. On the other hand,
voters embracing egalitarian and altruist values and believing in the propriety of
economic interventions to uphold those values might have offsetting attitudes
towards globalization. Their commitment to redress inequities might make them
see globalization, including immigration flows, as threatening less-skilled citizens
and communities (Mansfield and Mutz, 2009). But that same commitment might
foster substantially less anti-globalization and anti-immigrant attitudes in particu-
lar--as newcomers can be seen as deserving equal treatment even in a world with
substantial borders and inequalities (Pantoja, 2006).
Such logic suggests that radical left and radical right voters harbor distinct anti-
globalization attitudes. Radical left voters and parties, unlike right counterparts,
can be expected to be particularly focused on the inegalitarian aspects of global-
ization (i.e. opposing a `Neo-liberal Europe' but not a `Social Europe'). And we
can expect radical left and right voters to have very different atittudes on immi-
gration, where the equality, equal treatment, and social inclusion of newcomers
divide the left and right. On top of such logic from our above analysis, the histor-
ical and mainstream left has been found to have strong ties to globalism and
internationalism, or anti-nationalism (March, 2011; Minkenberg, 1995), that
ought to moderate any nationalism among the radical left as opposed to radical
right voters. To conclude, although the radical left and right electorates share a
negative attitude toward European integration, they likely differ radically vis-a
` -vis
their attitudes regarding the immigration face of globalization.
H4: Voters who are more anti-immigration are more likely to vote for radical right
parties compared to mainstream parties, but less likely to vote for radical left parties
compared to mainstream parties.
Radical distinctions in education
Education is an important measure of SES relevant to skill-profile and economic
risk: the more educated (European) voter will be more equipped with the skills in
544 European Union Politics 18(4)
demand in the modern global economy, and less likely to be attracted to radical left
or right parties. This should apply in equal measure to left and right radicalism.
Yet, education also shapes and ideas about the global economy and internation-
alism in ways that foster cosmopolitanism. Education has been found to spur pro-
globalization and pro-immigration attitudes among voters, via cosmpolitanism and
not just or mainly of skill premia (Hainmueller and Hiscox, 2010; Hainmueller
and Hopkins, 2014). Education is also associated with reduced levels of euroscepti-
cism (Hakhverdian et al., 2013), and higher levels of cosmopolitanism directly
(Mau et al., 2008). Education can be expected to lead to straight-ahead and con-
sistent rejection of radical right parties--with respect to the intervening link of
cosmopolitanism, not just the intervening link of lowering socioeconomic risk.
But with respect to support for radical left parties, more education can be expected
again to have offsetting implications. More educated individuals may experience
less economic frustration that plausibly underlie both left and right radicalism.
However, via their education, these individuals may also have a more cosmopolitan
embrace of global interaction and of egalitarian treatment of immigrants. It is
possible, of course, that education plays out in ways that constitute two distinct
bases for radical left support--on the one hand, those of low SES including edu-
cation, who embrace the state-activist egalitarianism and nationalism; and on the
other hand, those of higher SES who support the same but also the equal treatment
of immigrants. In general, education should play out differently for radical left and
radical right voter support.
H5: Voters with higher education are more likely to vote for radical left parties
compared to mainstream parties, but less likely to vote for radical right parties com-
pared to mainstream parties.
An implication of the above analysis is that education should affect radicalisms in
ways that are conditional upon egalitarian and altruistic attitudes. The higher
educated who vote for radical left parties are most likely individuals supporting
egalitarian and altruistic attitudes, as for it will be less in their own economic
interest to vote for parties that criticize capitalism and propose higher taxation.
They vote for the radical left because they think that society at large will profit
from a successful radical left. Education socializes political values onto students,
including values of equality and democracy (Stubager, 2008). And a `sociotropic'
orientation can require a modicum of reasoning and knowledge that education can
foster (Dee, 2004; Van de Werfhorst and De Graaf, 2004). Political knowledge may
increase the effects of egalitarian ideology on voting and position-taking on par-
ticular issues, including taxing and spending issues (Gomez and Wilson, 2001;
Lupia and McCubbins, 1998; Lupia et al., 2007; Mansfield and Mutz, 2009).
Relatedly, education's tendency to foster cosmopolitanism might be stronger
among the more ideologically egalitarian and altruistic (Hainmueller and Hiscox,
2010; Mansfield and Mutz, 2009). Conversely, we suspect that the lower educated
who vote for radical left parties are likely to be more egoistic; they vote for the
Rooduijn et al. 545
radical left because they have fewer opportunities on the job market, as a result of
which it is in their direct economic interest to vote for a party that proposes to
protect the socioeconomically most vulnerable.
H6: The tendency of the higher educated to vote for radical left parties (relative to
mainstream parties) increases when voters embrace egalitarian and/or altruist values,
and this does not hold for the tendency to vote for radical right parties compared to
mainstream parties.
Data and measurement
To test the above hypotheses, we analyze seven waves of the ESS (2002­2014) to
test our hypotheses (ESS, 2016). We focus on the voting patterns of respondents
with respect to 26 radical right and 23 radical left parties in 23 countries, summar-
ized in Table 1. We selected those individuals who voted for either one of the
selected radical right or radical left parties, or for a mainstream party (i.e. a liberal,
social democratic, conservative or Christian democratic party). The categorization
of radical right parties is largely based on Mudde (2007) and that of radical left
parties on March (2011).6 Some parties are doubtful cases. The Dutch LPF and the
British UKIP, for instance, are relatively moderate, and some scholars doubt
whether these parties qualify as radical right (see Mudde, 2007). We did not include
the Alternative for Germany (AfD) in our analysis, because in 2014--the most
recent year in our data--this party was not (yet) radical right (see Arzheimer,
2015). Other parties might be perceived as being too extreme to be in the radical
right party family. An example is the German NPD. Similarly, KKE in Greece and
KSS in Slovakia might be defined as something other than radical left parties
(March, 2011). While existing literature and party studies support the present cat-
egorization, we experimented with other categorizations, taking account among
other issues of the heterogeneity of radical left as opposed to radical right parties
(March, 2011). As shall be discussed below, this does not lead to different substan-
tive findings.
The dependent variables are based on the vote choice of respondents.
Respondents were asked whether he or she voted during the last national general
election. If yes, he or she was asked which party s/he voted for. Based on this
vote-choice variable we constructed various dichotomous dependent variables rep-
resenting comparisons between categories of parties, based on the following three
categories: (1) mainstream; (2) radical right; and (3) radical left.7 Our baseline
models include radical right versus mainstream and radical left versus mainstream.
Our independent variables address the expectations articulated above. The first
set is relevant to SES: Education, Class, Subjective income and Unemployed (See for
more information the Online Appendix). Another set of variables concerns nor-
mative stances on political and economic dissatisfaction. We included a variable of
Economic dissatisfaction, which measures how satisfied respondents are with the
546 European Union Politics 18(4)
state of the economy in their country (0 ¼ `extremely satisfied'; 10 ¼ `extremely
dissatisfied'). And we included a measure of Political distrust in our analysis.
On an 11-point scale respondents could indicate trust in the country's parliament
and the country's politicians. We recoded these so that they range from `complete
trust' (0) to `no trust at all' (10), and combined them into a political trust scale
(Cronbach's Alpha ¼ 0.85).
A third set of variables gauges the normative-ideological stances of voters rele-
vant to hypotheses 1­3. To measure Egalitarianism (for H1), we rely on a question
asking respondents whether they believe the following description applies to them:
`S/he thinks it is important that every person in the world should be treated
equally. S/he believes everyone should have equal opportunities in life'.
The 6-point Likert-scale answers range from 1 (`not like me at all') to 6
(`very much like me'). To measure Altruism, relevant to hypothesis 2, respondents
answered another 6-point Likert-scale question on whether respondents recognize

people around her/him. S/he wants to care for their well-being'.8 The answering
categories range from 1 (`not like me at all') to 6 (`very much like me'). Finally, to
measure support for government intervention to support egalitarian goals, relevant
to H3, we rely on Government redistribution, measuring whether respondents strongly
disagreed (1) or strongly agreed (5) with the proposition that `The government
should take measures to reduce differences in income levels'.
A final set of independent variables concern anti-globalization sentiments.
We focus on the two domains consistently addressed across multiple ESS waves:
European Union integration and immigration. Our Anti-EU measure is based on
the question `European unification should go further or has gone too far',
responses ranging from 0 to 10 (0 ¼ `European unification should go further'
through to 10 ¼ `European unification has already gone too far'). Anti-immigration
(hypothesis 4) is a scale that measures perceived ethnic threat.9 The new variable
was recoded so that 0 means `immigrants are good rather than pose a threat' and
10 is that `immigrants pose a large threat' (Cronbach's Alpha ¼ 0.84).
We control for a respondent's priority for a strong state and law-and-order.
We rely on Strong state for safety, based on a 6-point Likert-scale asking whether
respondents judge themselves similar to someone for whom `it is important that
government is strong and ensures safety', with answers ranging from 1 (`not at all
like me') to 6 (`very much like me'). All models control for religiosity, age, gender,
and rural/urban residence of the respondent. Religiosity is measured in subjective
categories ranging from `not at all religious' (0) to `very religious' (10). Age is in
years, though we dropped all respondents younger than 18 years old who are
not allowed to vote yet. A gender dummy classifies females as 1 and males as 0.
The rural/urban residence is urban (1) versus rural (0). Our baseline estimations
are logistic regression models that include country- and year-fixed effects to
account for the fact that respondents are nested within both countries and years.
The reported coefficients are odds ratios, and standard errors are robust-clustered
by country-year. The observations are also weighted using the population size
weights and the design weights provided by the ESS. Observations with missing
values were deleted listwise.
Findings
Table 2 displays the results of the baseline logistic regressions. Models 1 through
4 consider the conditions relevant to the likelihood of voting for the radical right as
opposed to mainstream parties (mainstream is coded as `0' and radical right as `1').
Model 1 is a minimalist model of demographic controls plus education; Model 2
adds the remaining SES variables (class, unemployment and income); Model 3
adds Anti-immigration, and Model 4 Anti-European Union. Models 5­8 repeat
the same stepwise estimates for radical left party votes relative to mainstream
party votes (0 ¼ mainstream; 1 ¼ radical left). By necessity, the analyses on radical
right and radical left voting cover the countries where these respective party

families are present. This means that these models are run on a (partially) different
selection of countries. To be sure that this different coverage does not drive the
results, we also present models directly comparing radical right to radical left voters
in the country-waves where these party families coexist. As will be discussed below,
these analyses lead to very similar substantive findings.
The results show that both radical left and right voters tend to be dispropor-
tionately lower class. Although not all class categories differ significantly from the
reference category of semi- and unskilled manual workers and agricultural
laborers, the lower and higher level professionals and managers and entrepreneurs
do differ in the expected direction from this category. When it comes to radical
right voting, unemployment and income lose statistical significance with the add-
ition of attitudinal controls. Still, lower socioeconomic positions yield, to some
extent, higher likelihood of voting for radical parties compared to mainstream
parties--albeit with some heterogeneity in our models. The clear exception is, as
expected, education (H5), which tends to statistically significantly lower chances of
voting for radical right but increases the chance of voting radical left.
Additional evidence for hypothesis 5 is that the negative effect of education on
support for radical right voting becomes less negative once one controls away the
influence of (direct measures of) socioeconomic risks. Similarly, the positive effect
of education on the chance of voting radical left becomes more positive once one
controls for the same socioeconomic parameters, suggesting that what remains of
the education effect after removing economic risks has to do with the positive
impact on radical left support via education's fostering of cosmopolitanism.
Finally, Table 2 considers the effect of Anti-European Union and Anti-
Immigration attitudes on radical left and right voting. Respondents with stronger
Anti-European Union attitudes tend to disproportionately support both the radical
right and left parties (see model 4 and model 8).10 However, with respect to Anti-
immigration (H4), considering immigration to be a threat is much more likely to
spur radical right voting, but much less likely to spur radical left voting. These
effects are among the substantively (and statistically) strongest in the model, where
a one-unit increase in the 10-point scale of Anti-immigration is associated with a 57-
percent increase in the odds of supporting radical right and 8-percent drop in the
odds of supporting radical left parties. In line with our theory, the positive effect of
education on support for radical left and negative on support for radical right are
both dampened by inclusion of these putative intervening variables.
Table 3 considers full models including all attitudinal variables relevant to the
hypotheses above, though now excluding Anti-European Union so as to retain fuller
coverage. Models 1 and 2 repeat specifications for all the models in Table 2, but
here we also include the remaining attitudinal parameters. Model 1 focuses on the
radical right, while model 2 focuses on the radical left. This allows a side-by-side
comparison of how the various SES and attitudinal factors, beyond anti-globaliza-
tion attitudes, affect left and right radicalisms. Consistent with Table 2,
we see substantial overlap again in the SES conditions (except education) and
the striking difference in Anti-immigration. Interestingly, neither radical right nor

radical left voting are affected by Political Distrust, but both radicalisms are sig-
nificantly spurred by Economic Dissatisfaction.
Equally striking are the comparisons between radical left and right with respect
to the more ideological parameters. The patterns broadly corroborate the above
hypotheses. Consistent with hypothesis 1, radical left voters are more likely to
support Egalitarianism while radical right voters are less likely to do so.
Consistent with hypothesis 2, radical left voters are also more likely to express
Altruism, while radical right voters are not. Consistent with hypothesis 3, finally,
radical left voters are much more likely to Support Government Redistribution than
are mainstream voters, whereas radical right voters are not.
Model 3 in Table 3 considers an alternative specification of the baseline results.
It focuses on only radical voters, with the dependent variable being 1 for radical
left voter and 0 for radical right voter. This sets the patterns of the baseline
models into sharper relief. For instance, the two sorts of radical voters are similar
with respect to class background or income, but significantly different with respect
to unemployment: radical left voters are only half as likely as their radical right
counterparts to be unemployed (OR ¼ .55). And of course, we see again the large
difference with respect to education. More striking, still, are the differences with
respect to the party legacies of the left and right, with patterns virtually identical to
the baseline (Models 1 and 2).
The results so far have shed light on all of our hypotheses, except for hypothesis
6. The expectation of H6 is that highly educated supporters of the left express
altruistic and egalitarianist attitudes, and that the effect of education on voting
for radical left parties will become more strongly positive among more egalitarian

and altruistic voters. To test this hypothesis, we add to the specifications reported
in Table 3's model 1 and 2 interaction terms between Egalitarianism (or Altruism)
and Education. The results are summarized in Table 4. Model 1 in Table 4 shows
that the interaction effect is not significant when it comes to radical right voters.
For radical left voting, however, the interaction is significant (model 2).
Figure 1 clarifies the marginal effects of the interactions. The first panel (a)
presents the insignificant interaction between altruism and education for voting
radical right rather than mainstream. The figure shows a consistent negative
effect of education on radical right voting, irrespective of altruism levels.
Panel (b) displays the inverse interpretation of the same interaction term, which
reads that altruism has no significant effect on voting for the radical right compared
to mainstream parties--no matter the level of education. Figure 1's third and
fourth panels show the same marginal effects for radical left voting. Here, the
third panel (c) shows no significant effect of education for more egoistic individ-
uals. However, for more altruistic voters education becomes positive and statis-
tically significant. Importantly, the difference in the education effect between very
egoistic and very altruistic voters is also statistically significant. Panel (d) confirms
that the interaction is significant and shows that the effect of altruism on radical left
compared to mainstream voting is significant only among higher-educated voters.
These results provide substantial support for hypothesis 6: the higher educated vote
radical left only when they are more altruistic. Importantly, the interaction plaus-
ibly captures conditional effects in the opposite direction: not only is the tendency

Conclusion and discussion
There are reasons to expect similarities between radical right and radical left elect-
orates. Both have been thought to draw upon similar socioeconomic voter positions.
Existing empirical studies of voter radicalisms have affirmed such patterns, while also
unearthing some differences. The problem is that such differences are more induced
than explained, leaving them conceptualized as, at most, ad hoc exceptions that prove
a rule that the radical left and radical right share more than they contest.
We argue that although the radical left and right voter-bases have plenty in
common, they strongly differ when it comes to their main voting motivations.
With respect to fundamental values on equality, altruism, and appropriateness of
government promotion of equality, radical left voters embrace and radical right
voters more readily eschew such values. As a plausible consequence of such diver-
gences in fundamental values, radical left and right voters differ in their national-
ism: The radicalisms of both left and right share concerns about the European
Union, but they yield diametrically opposed attitudes about immigration--where
the radical left shows marked signs of cosmopolitanism and the radical right clear
nativism. Finally, these patterns clarify why radical left voters tend to be more
educated than their radical left counterparts (or, indeed, more than mainstream
voters): the radical left's commitment to cosmopolitanism, itself likely a product of
egalitarianism, develops in part through education.
Future studies should investigate the relationship between egalitarianism, educa-
tion, and radical voting in more detail and by means of more sophisticated attitu-
dinal measurements. Further, it is important to assess the role of macro-level
variables like socioeconomic inequality, economic growth and the percentage of
foreign-born residents. Another possible venue for future research is development
of radical voting over time, or differences between various regions within Europe.
Meanwhile, our findings clarify the future of radicalisms and of coalition for-
mation in an age of electoral turmoil in Europe. The findings imply that the rad-
ical left and radical right likely to draw on very different segments of the same pool
of `losers of globalization'. Relatedly, the competing radicalisms can be expected
to rally discontents to very different ends and party programs--to seek to
win hearts and minds in ways that should be familiar to what we know about
left-right divides in electoral democracy. Another important implication is that
radical left and radical right parties, both doing better in the polls and national
elections, may be less likely to find a common cause and form coalitions than is
often discussed or feared. We know that such coalitions are possible--as in the
wake of the 2015 Greek elections when Syriza formed a government with a small
radical right party. Such an example, our arguments and evidence suggest, repre-
sent a `bootlegger-baptist' coalition--always possible in political life, but no
Rooduijn et al. 555
harbinger for enduring and broader political alliances. Examples of radical left and
radical right cooperation are exceptions that prove, or at least predict, a rule--a
rule of radical distinctions.

2. Lower service workers, however, are not more likely to vote for the radical right,
whereas labor supervisors and self-employed people, for instance, are.
3. Van der Brug and Van Spanje (2009) have found that party positions in Europe are
mainly structured by a single left-right dimension.
4. Note, however, that Bakker et al. (2016) found that voting for populist radical left
parties could be more common among those scoring low on Agreeableness. Yet research
on the relationship between personality and radical voting is still in its infancy (see
Bakker and De Vreese, 2016 vis-a
` -vis EU-attitudes).
5. But note that mainstream parties strongly differ from each other when it comes to their
attitudes and strategies regarding the EU (see Adam et al., 2017).
6. See for similar categorizations also Akkerman et al. (2016), Gomez et al. (2016), Ramiro
(2016), and Zhirkov (2014).
7. This vote-choice question is asked every two years, implying that the last national election
could be several years earlier, potentially yielding recall error. However, incorrectly recalled
parties are often ideologically close to the original vote, and recall tends to be biased
towards current party preferences (Van Elsas et al., 2016). Given our interest in distin-
guishing radical-right and left parties from mainstream parties, and our focus on voting
patterns more generally, vote recall measures are most appropriate. In addition, voters may
be more likely to remember their vote choice if they have opted for a radical party.
8. This question focuses on a narrow part of altruism, other-regarding behavior towards
others in one's own midst, not all others. But this does gauge subjective willingness to
regard and help others, and is the only ESS question to do so.
9. This scale is based on the following questions: (1) `Would you say it is generally bad or
good for [country]'s economy that people come to live here from other countries?'; (2)
`Would you say that [country]'s cultural life is generally undermined or enriched by
people coming to live here from other countries?'; and (3) `Is [country] made a worse or a
better place to live by people coming to live here from other countries?'
10. The anti-EU variable has been added separately because including it leads to a strong
reduction in the sample size.
