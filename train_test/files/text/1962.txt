HEALTH CARE REFORM
ORIGINAL INVESTIGATION
Referral and Consultation Communication
Between Primary Care and Specialist Physicians
Finding Common Ground
Ann S. O'Malley, MD, MPH; James D. Reschovsky, PhD
Background: Communication between primary care
physicians (PCPs) and specialists regarding referrals and
consultations is often inadequate, with negative conse-
quences for patients. We examined PCPs' and special-
ists' perceptions of communication regarding referrals and
consultations. We then identified practice characteris-
tics associated with reported communication.
Methods: We analyzed the nationally representative 2008
Center for Studying Health System Change Health Track-
ing Physician Survey of 4720 physicians providing at least
20 hours per week of direct patient care. Outcome mea-
sures were physician reports of communication regard-
ing referrals and consultations.
Results: Perceptions of communication regarding refer-
ralsandconsultationsdiffered.Forexample,69.3%ofPCPs
reported "always" or "most of the time" sending notifica-
tion of a patient's history and reason for consultation to
specialists, but only 34.8% of specialists said they "al-
ways"or"mostofthetime"receivedsuchnotification.Simi-
larly, 80.6% of specialists said they "always" or "most of
the time" send consultation results to the referring PCP,
but only 62.2% of PCPs said they received such informa-
tion. Physicians who did not receive timely communica-
tion regarding referrals and consultations were more likely
to report that their ability to provide high-quality care was
threatened. The 3 practice characteristics associated with
PCPs and specialists reporting communication regarding
referrals and consultations were "adequate" visit time with
patients, receipt of quality reports regarding patients with
chronic conditions, and nurse support for monitoring pa-
tients with chronic conditions.
Conclusions: These modifiable practice supports asso-
ciated with communication between PCPs and special-
ists can help inform the ways that resources are focused
to improve care coordination.

Despite its importance, interspecialty
communication occurs inconsistently.6,10-13
Identification of practice factors with the
potential to enhance communication can
inform efforts to improve care coordina-
tion. Such efforts include health informa-
tion technology (HIT) adoption; patient-
centered medical homes, which emphasize
coordinationbyPCPs;andaccountablecare
organizations (ACOs), which strive for
shared accountability for patients among
physicians.14-18
Others have examined interspecialty
communication in specific settings or situ-
ations and found, for example, that use of
standardized note formats and computer
access to medical records were associ-
ated with better communication.2,6,10,11,13
In another study,19 practices in which a
care coordinator worked on-site with the
patient's PCP for patients with chronic
conditions had improved coordination and
were cost neutral.

identified practice characteristics associated with posi-
tive perceptions of interspecialty communication. We hy-
pothesized that greater practice resources (including fewer
time pressures), the presence of care management sup-
ports, and indicators of more established referral net-
works and integration would be associated with greater
communication regarding referrals and consultations. We
were particularly interested in 3 modifiable factors: ad-
equacy of patient visit time (as a proxy for time for com-
munication and practice resources), use of HIT to com-
municate regarding patients, and use of nonphysician staff
to support care management.
METHODS
SURVEY AND SAMPLE
We analyzed a national stratified random sample of 4720 phy-
sicians from the 2008 Health System Change Health Tracking
Physician Survey. Funded by the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation, it is the fifth in a series of nationally representative phy-
sician surveys conducted since 1996 by the Center for Study-
ing Health System Change.20 The sampling frame included active
licensed allopathic and osteopathic physicians and was drawn
from the American Medical Association master file. The mail
survey achieved a 61.9% response rate. Characteristics of phy-
sicians who completed the survey and those who refused to par-
ticipate were similar.20 All survey items have been validated
through successful use in other surveys or cognitive testing.
Respondents must have completed their medical training
and provide direct patient care for at least 20 hours per week.
Physicians with minimal direct patient contact (eg, radiolo-
gists, anesthesiologists, and pathologists), federal employees,
and temporarily licensed foreign medical graduates were in-
eligible. Additional background information is available at http:
//www.hschange.org/CONTENT/1085/. An institutional re-
view board approved the survey and procedures.
The PCPs included family practice, general practice, gen-
eral internal medicine, geriatric, internal medicine­pediatric,
and general pediatric physicians. Before combining all special-
ists within 1 group, we analyzed several subgroups separately
(eg, types of surgeons with differing needs to communicate with
PCPs and cognitive vs procedural specialists).
OUTCOME MEASURES
Care coordination requires that PCPs referring patients to spe-
cialists communicate timely, relevant patient information and
the reason for the referral and that specialists communicate find-
ings and recommendations back to the PCP.21 Equally impor-
tant is the receipt and recognition of this information by the
respective parties.1 On the basis of primary care and chronic
care frameworks,1,22 we examined factors hypothesized to in-
fluence these components of communication.
We used 4 questions adapted from the Primary Care
Assessment Tool, Provider Survey.23 We asked PCPs, "When
referring a patient to a specialist, how often do you send the
specialist notification of the patient's history and the reason
for consultation?" and "How often do you receive useful
information about your referred patients from specialists?"
We asked specialists, "When you see a patient referred to you
by a PCP, how often do you receive notification of the
patient's medical history and reason for consultation?" and
"For patients who were referred to you by a PCP, how often
do you send the PCP notification of the results of your con-
sultation and advice to the patient?" Response options were
"always," "most of the time," "sometimes," "seldom or never,"
and "not applicable."
Reports of communication receipt reflect other physicians'
sending behavior and the receiving organization's ability to get
communications to the appropriate physician when needed.
Thus, results regarding communication receipt may reflect the
characteristics of physicians in the referral network and those
of the receiving practice.
Independent variables of primary interest were organized con-
ceptually into the 3 areas related to our hypotheses. We recog-
nizethatsome(eg,practicetypeandsize)mightfitintoall3areas.
PRACTICE RESOURCES AND TIME PRESSURES
We asked physicians about the extent to which they thought
they had adequate time to spend with their patients during of-
fice visits (Likert scale responses ranging from "agree strongly"
to "disagree strongly") and the practices' payer mix (percent-
age of Medicare and Medicaid revenue). Because practices car-
ing for patients with more complex and comorbid conditions
face greater coordination challenges, we assessed whether the
practice cared for patients with 1 or more of 4 prevalent and
costly chronic conditions (eg, asthma, diabetes mellitus, de-
pression, and congestive heart failure) and the percentage of
the physician's patients with any chronic condition.
Other independent variables relevant to practice resources
and physician time pressures were practice type and size and
physician base compensation method. We also included phy-
sician reports of the importance of quality measures, patient
satisfaction surveys, productivity, practice profiling, and prac-
tice financial performance in determining compensation (mod-
erately or very important vs somewhat or not important).
PRACTICE SUPPORTS FOR CARE MANAGEMENT
Practice supports for patients with chronic conditions indi-
cate a capacity for care management and are hypothesized to
be associated with communication in connection with consul-
tations and referrals. These supports include (1) nonphysi-
cian patient educators, (2) nurse care managers, and (3) the
receipt by the physician of quality reports regarding his/her pa-
tients with chronic conditions.22-24 These items were asked of
physicians in practices treating any 1 of 4 prevalent chronic con-
ditions (eg, asthma, diabetes, congestive heart failure, or de-
pression). In the logistic regression models, a dummy variable
was included to capture physicians in practices that did not pro-
vide care for patients with any of these 4 conditions.
We also assessed the presence and use of HIT in the prac-
tice, focusing on elements with the potential to support com-
munication and information sharing. After assessing them in-
dividually, we created a summary measure of 3 HIT tools most
relevant to coordination: (1) whether the respondent's main
practice uses an electronic medical record (EMR) (all paper,
0; part electronic, 1; and all electronic, 2); (2) whether the phy-
sician routinely used HIT for accessing patient notes, problem
lists, and medication lists (no, 0; yes, 1); and (3) whether the
physician routinely used HIT to exchange clinical data with other
physicians (no, 0; yes, 1). We summed responses and then cat-
egorized them as high (3-4), partial (1-2), or none (0). The rate
of e-mail use for communication with other physicians regard-
ing patients was too low to be included in the analysis.
REFERRAL NETWORKS AND
INDICATORS OF INTEGRATION
We included proxy variables that helped capture the extent to
which physicians have more vs less established referral net-
works with other physicians: physician years in practice (11,

11-20, 20), based on prior findings that physicians in prac-
tice longer have more established working relationships with
other physicians; rural vs urban location; independent physi-
cian ownership; practice type (group or staff model health main-
tenance organization [HMO] vs community health center vs
other practice types) and group practice size (number of phy-
sicians); number of managed care contracts; and percentage of
practice revenue under capitation.
We controlled for additional physician factors, including sex,
board certification, medical training location (United States or
Canada vs elsewhere), and specialty.1,2,6,25 We also controlled
for geographic region, physicians' assessment of "market com-
petitiveness," and county ratio of PCP-to-specialist supply.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
We examined univariate frequencies of all variables, correla-
tions among independent variables, and the bivariate associa-
tions between independent and outcome variables. Tests for mul-
tiple comparisons of the bivariate proportions were conducted,
and they did not differ significantly from the raw P values. On
the basis of these analyses and the clinical and policy relevance
of particular factors within the primary care and chronic care con-
ceptual frameworks, we built logistic regression models. The goal
of our multivariate logistic regressions was to examine the asso-
ciation between the key modifiable independent variables (eg, ad-
equate time with patients) and each binary outcome (eg, sends
information regarding a referral or consultation), adjusting for
all other practice factors and potential confounders.
A separate logistic regression model was created for each of
the 4 coordination outcome measures. Two of the models ap-

sician, panel, and market characteristics, we entered nonmodi-

tus)intoeachlogisticregressionmodelasmutuallyexclusivecat-
egoricalvariables.Afterbuildingthesebasemodels,variablesthat

were added one at a time (eg, revenue sources, factors affecting
compensation, use of an EMR, use of nurse care managers for pa-
tientswithchronicconditions,andwhetherthephysicianthought
heorshehadadequatetimetospendwithpatientsduringvisits).
To assess the relative contributions of the key independent vari-
ables of interest on the outcomes and model fit, we performed
the likelihood ratio test (2 difference in the likelihood ratios) as
each modifiable factor was added to the base model.
We assessed for interactions between key independent vari-
ables and relevant covariates with respect to the coordination
measures; none were significant. Specialist subgroup results were
consistent, with only minor differences in magnitude but not
in direction of the associations; therefore, only combined spe-
cialist results are given.
We determined present adjusted percentages from final par-
simonious models. Hosmer-Lemeshow tests indicated good fit
of the data. Also, SUDAAN software, version 10.0 (Research
Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina) was
used to analyze the data that were weighted for probability of
selection and survey nonresponse. Unadjusted analyses were
largely consistent with the multivariate logistic regression re-
sults and thus are not presented.
Finally, we calculated the predicted increase in interspecialty
communication as each of the 4 key practice supports (HIT use,
adequatevisittime,qualityreportsregardingpatientswithchronic
conditions, and a nurse care manager) is added for an average
respondent,holdingallothercovariatesattheirmeans.Thesesimu-
lations are based on estimates from the multivariate logistic re-
gression models.

The PCPs' and specialists' reports of the extent that they
communicate with one another regarding patient refer-
rals and consultations differed significantly (Table 2).
Although 69.3% of PCPs reported that they "always" or
"most of the time" send the specialist notification of a
patient's history and reason for consultation at the time
of referral, only 34.8% of specialists reported they "al-
ways" or "most of the time" receive such notification. Simi-
larly, 80.6% of specialists said they "always" or "most of
the time" send the referring PCP notification of the re-
sults of their consultation and advice to patients,
whereas only 62.2% of PCPs reported they received
such information. The PCPs and specialists who re-
ported not consistently receiving communications re-
garding referrals and consultations were significantly
more likely to report that their ability to provide high-
quality care was threatened because of failure to receive
timely reports (Table 3). This finding suggests poor
communication threatens quality of care and supports
our outcome measures' content validity.
PRACTICE RESOURCES
AND TIME PRESSURES
For PCPs and specialists, "having adequate time to spend
with patients during the office visit" was the factor with
the greatest positive association with each communica-
tion outcome (Table 4 and Table 5). Although phy-
sicians with higher proportions of patients with chronic
conditions were more likely to report sending notifica-
tion to their colleagues, they were also more likely to re-
port that receipt of timely reports from other physicians
was a problem (data not shown).
PRACTICE SUPPORTS
FOR CARE MANAGEMENT
Receipt of quality reports regarding patients with chronic
conditions was positively associated with 3 of 4 out-
comes (Table 4 and Table 5). The involvement of a nurse
at the practice to help treat patients with chronic condi-
tions was associated with greater receipt of communica-
tion regarding referrals and consultations. Use of HIT was
associated with higher reports of receiving and sending
communication by specialists but not by PCPs.

REFERRAL NETWORKS AND
INDICATORS OF INTEGRATION
Physicians who have practiced 20 years or more and phy-
sicians in small and nonmetropolitan areas report send-
ing and receiving communication regarding referrals and
consultations at higher rates than their counterparts, re-
gardless of specialty. The PCPs in group- and staff-
model HMOs, community health centers, and hospital
or medical school practices report sending referral in-
formation to specialists at higher rates than counter-
parts in group practices (Table 4). Among PCPs, re-
ports of sending communication to specialists decreased
as the number of managed care contracts increased
(Table 4). For specialists, this association was in the op-
posite direction.

results suggest much room for improvement. The PCPs
and specialists reporting inconsistent receipt of commu-
nications from other physicians were significantly more
likely to report that their ability to provide high-quality
care was threatened because of failure to receive timely
reports.
The significant differences in PCPs' and specialists' per-
ceptions of the extent to which they communicate with
one another regarding referrals and consultations may
have various causes, including overstatement of send-
ing behaviors and understatement of receipt. Although
our questions asked specifically about patients referred
by PCPs, specialists may have misattributed some pa-
tient self-referrals as PCP referrals. In addition, process
failures, such as late or misdirected reports and reports
not placed in the patient's record in a timely fashion at
the recipient practice, may affect responses regarding re-
ceipt despite timely sending.
MODIFIABLE FACTORS CONSISTENTLY
ASSOCIATED WITH INTERSPECIALTY
COMMUNICATION
Practice Resources and Time Pressures
The factor most consistently and strongly associated with
interspecialty communication was "adequate time with a
patientduringtheofficevisit."Inaddition,PCPsweremore
likely to believe that they do not have adequate time to
spend with patients during office visits than were special-
ists. This likely occurred because of the complex nature
of primary care, which involves longitudinal care over time
and coordination of a patient's care across various condi-
tions.1 Increased administrative burden (eg, health plan
prior authorizations) and decreasing reimbursements
create pressures for physicians to see more patients26 and
decrease the time available for effective communica-
tions regarding referrals and consultations during and af-
ter the visit. The average primary care face-to-face visit
lasts 10.7 to 18.7 minutes, depending on the assessment
method,27,28 and time pressures during the visit result in
lower-quality care, including poorer patient and physi-
cian care experiences.29,30 Our findings complement these
prior studies. With more encounter time, the physician
and staff can focus more completely on the patient's needs,
which may include initiating referral and consultation
communication and retrieving reports from other
physicians.
Overall, payment factors, as measured by this sur-
vey, had inconsistent and little association with inter-
specialty communication. Most current compensation
methods do not incentivize communication. Practice sup-
ports may be more important to facilitating interspe-
cialty communication, at least in the predominant fee-
for-service environment.
Care Management Supports
The positive association between receipt of quality reports
regarding patients with chronic conditions and interspe-
cialty communication regarding referrals and consulta-
tions suggests the potential benefits of providing perfor-
mance feedback to physicians. Such feedback may help
identify gaps in care and spur physicians to communicate
with others sharing care for patients. Practice environ-
ments where quality reports are generated may also have
cultures or mechanisms to facilitate referral and consulta-
tion reports or follow-up when communications are not
received.
It is notable that significantly fewer specialists re-
ceived quality reports compared with PCPs for their pa-
tients with chronic conditions. Given the positive asso-
ciation between quality report receipt and communication
levels between PCPs and specialists, increased attention
to providing specialists with such quality reports might
beindicated.Inaddition,incorporatinginterphysiciancom-
munication measures into such reports might help im-
prove coordination.
The association between having a nurse in the prac-
tice help coordinate care for patients with chronic con-
ditions and greater receipt of interspecialty communi-
cation may reflect efforts by the nurse to reach out to other
practices to obtain referral or consultation letters. This
is a particularly important function for overwhelmed prac-
tices, although few have the resources to provide nurse
care managers and few payers compensate for this. Even
in primary care practices that lack nurse care managers,
the presence of nonphysician staff to educate patients with
chronic conditions was beneficially associated with the
sending of reports from one practice to another.
The positive association between HIT use and send-
ing or receiving information among specialists, but not
among PCPs, may reflect that specialists are more likely
to work in large or institutional settings with available
HIT.31 Use of HIT in this national sample was higher
than prior estimates,32 which used different measures of
HIT use, but closer to a recent publication of data from
the National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey, which
found that 41.5% of physicians reported using all or

the United States27 and that have received less attention
in the quality improvement literature. The survey also
had a high response rate for a physician survey, and we
controlled for a wide range of physician, practice, and
market characteristics.
The study's limitations include the use of physician
self-reportdatathat,giventhestudy'snationalscope,could
not feasibly be validated by medical record reviews. We
also lack information on the accuracy, comprehensive-
ness, and timing of communication. However, our na-
tional sample's self-reported rates of sending or receiv-
ing communication regarding referrals and consultations
are within the range reported in the literature.2,6,10-13 Re-
gardless, potential self-report bias (owing to social de-
sirability) should not systematically affect the direction
of associations. Finally, the cross-sectional design does
not permit causal attribution.
Although we are unable to fully capture the con-
structs of practice resources and pressures and referral
networks and integration, the individual items exam-
ined can help inform policy and clinical initiatives by iden-
tifying how resources might be focused to improve com-
munication regarding referrals and consultations. Our
results suggest that supporting PCPs so that they, for ex-
ample, can afford nurse care managers may facilitate ad-
equate communication with specialists.
IMPLICATIONS
Efforts to improve coordination should address the low
rates of interspecialty communication regarding refer-
rals and consultations. Current initiatives such as patient-
centered medical homes, HIT, and ACOs have the po-
tential to strengthen financial incentives, structures, and
care processes to support communication. Combined with
prior work24,30,35 and anticipated lessons from current
medical home experiments, our findings can help in-
form these initiatives, suggesting ways to focus re-
sources to support infrastructure and measurement of in-
terspecialty communication. Targeted support for
capabilities identified in this study as being associated
with good bilateral communication--adequate visit time
with patients, quality reports regarding patients with
chronic conditions, and nurse support for coordination--
may help advance the communication that is critical to
care coordination and the success of policy efforts to im-
prove it. Such input might also support larger organiza-
tional efforts; for example, ACOs may help to define a
tight referral network and shared accountability for pa-
tients, whereas the patient-centered medical home within
an ACO can focus on care management and serve as the
hub of coordination efforts.
In conclusion, systematic structures, tools, and pro-
cesses for information creation,36 transfer, receipt, and
recognition by the sending and receiving physicians are
needed to assist medical practices. Measures of "mean-
ingful HIT use"14 and coordination of care could in-
clude items that support, track, and confirm comple-
tion of each of these tasks.

INVITED COMMENTARY
Improving Primary Care­Specialty Care
Communication
Lessons From San Francisco's Safety Net
With the advent of health care system reform,
patient-centered medical homes and account-
able care organizations have emerged as so-
lutions to the fragmentation and duplication that charac-
terize the US health care system.1 Given the increasing
burden of chronic disease, the success of these models de-
pends in part on improving the primary care­specialty care
interface.
The interaction between PCPs and specialist consult-
ants is not a trivial issue--it has a central role as a driver of
health care quality2 and cost.3 Moreover, the importance
ofthePCP-specialistnexusisunderscoredbythesheernum-
ber of physicians potentially involved in any given pa-
tient's care. A recent study4 found that in caring for 100
Medicarepatients,theaveragePCPneedstocoordinatecare
with 99 other physicians working across 53 practices.
O'Malley and Reschovsky use a large, nationally rep-
resentative sample of physicians to rigorously confirm a
problem that previously has been reported in smaller, lo-
calized studies. Despite the wide recognition that PCP-
specialist communication is critical for high-quality pa-
tient care, the authors found that communication between
PCPs and specialists occurs inconsistently. Remark-
ably, only 69.3% of PCPs and 80.6% of specialists report
"always" or "most of the time" sending basic patient in-
formation to each other. Furthermore, this retrospec-
tive, self-reported survey data may in fact represent an
overestimate.
