Introduction
Time-series cross-sectional data on countries' national
political regime types feature prominently in virtually all
research on the antecedents and causes of political develop-
ment and conflict. In the past 25 years, the conceptualiza-
tion and measurement of democracy has become a dominant
theme in the subfield of comparative politics, and recent
work on variations in forms of autocracy is growing in
prominence as well. What is more, these debates over con-
cepts and measures are not simply theoretical; they can
have significant effects on research that shapes policy and
advocacy as well. For example, myriad studies have shown
that national regime type shapes countries'propensity to go
to war with each other or their own citizens (Hegre, 2014);
work by the Political Instability Task Force has shown
regime type to be the single most-powerful predictor of
onsets of national political crises such as civil wars, coups,
and state collapse (Goldstone et al, 2010); and work by
numerous scholars suggests that the effects of events such
as sanctions (Escribá-Foch and Wright, 2010; Geddes,
2002) and social unrest (Ulfelder, 2005) on the likelihood
of authoritarian regime breakdown are conditional on for-
mal and informal institutional features of those regimes.
From a practical perspective, the measures of regime
type that are widely used today are expensive to produce.
Polity IV is coded by hand, so the dataset's producers must
spend many hours locating and reviewing relevant docu-
ments for upwards of 160 countries (Marshall and Jaggers,
2002). Freedom House's Freedom in the World depends on
repeated surveys of a large number of subject-matter
experts. The newly launched Varieties of Democracy

data on political regime types

Abstract
We describe the design and results of an experiment in using text-mining and machine-learning techniques to generate
annual measures of national political regime types. Valid and reliable measures of countries' forms of national government
are essential to cross-national and dynamic analysis of many phenomena of great interest to political scientists, including
civil war, interstate war, democratization, and coups d'état. Unfortunately, traditional measures of regime type are very
expensive to produce, and observations for ambiguous cases are often sharply contested. In this project, we train a
series of support vector machine (SVM) classifiers to infer regime type from textual data sources. To train the classifiers,
we used vectorized textual reports from Freedom House and the State Department as features for a training set of
prelabeled regime type data. To validate our SVM classifiers, we compare their predictions in an out-of-sample context,
and the performance results across a variety of metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) are very high. The results of this
project highlight the ability of these techniques to contribute to producing real-time data sources for use in political
science that can also be routinely updated at much lower cost than human-coded data. To this end, we set up a text-
processing pipeline that pulls updated textual data from selected sources, conducts feature extraction, and applies
supervised machine learning methods to produce measures of regime type. This pipeline, written in Python, can be pulled
from the Github repository associated with this project and easily extended as more data becomes available.

project, or V-Dem, does the same (Coppedge et al, 2013).
Other widely cited datasets on national political regimes,
including the Democracy and Dictatorship Dataset
(Cheibub et al, 2010) and the Autocratic Regimes Dataset
(Geddes et al, 2014), are not routinely updated, and the
high cost of doing so appears to be one reason why. The
Unified Democracy Scores (UDS) dataset thoughtfully
addresses the problem of uncertainty about one crucial
regime concept (the degree of democracy) (Pemstein
et al,2010), but it is derived from, and therefore wholly
dependent on, the human-coded datasets that are so labor
intensive to produce.
This paper introduces the use of supervised machine
learning in combination with natural language processing
techniques to generate measures of regime type, specifi-
cally, binary measures for democracy, military rule, one-
party rule, and monarchy. By relying on texts that are
routinely produced and publicly available, we show that it
is possible to train classifiers to predict measures of regime
type from labeled data at low cost and great frequency.
Tremendous growth in global reportage on democracy and
human rights in the past 20 years has produced a massive
corpus of texts on these topics that is ripe for content analy-
sis. Concurrent improvements in computer software and
hardware have made the process of analyzing large bodies
of text much more efficient, and the field has matured with
the development of a common set of methodologies with
well-tested characteristics.Automated coding is completely
transparent, so it avoids the unreproducible subjective ele-
ments of human coding. Once the source texts have been
prepared, recoding to account for new theoretical or tech-
nological components can be done relatively quickly and
efficiently.
Last but not least, innovations in methods for content
analysis are helping researchers use those tools to produce
more interesting and more useful results, including a num-
ber of applications to political texts. These approaches are
increasingly being used to generate political event data
(D'Orazio et al 2014; King and Lowe, 2003; O'Connor
et al, 2013) and to measure things such as political tensions
(Chadefaux, 2014), partisan affiliation (Slapin and Proksch,
2010; Yu et al, 2008), and legislative agendas (Grimmer,
2010). To the best of our knowledge, though, these tech-
niques have not previously been applied to the task of
measuring political regime types over time across many
countries.
The rest of the paper describes the pipeline through
which we generate measures of regime type from text and
the results of our initial application of this process to his-
torical documents and data. We first discuss the texts that
we have used so far to train our classifiers. We then describe
how we generate numerical representations of these texts
using a vector space model. Finally, we discuss how we
used those vector space representations in conjunction with
existing human-coded data on regime type to train support
vector machines (SVMs) that can generate measures of
regime type for years in which labeled data are not
available.
To highlight the feasibility of this approach in generat-
ing measures of regime type that are similar to extant meas-
ures, we apply this classification scheme to currently
existing data. Specifically, we divide up years for which
extant measures of regime type are available into a training
and test set. We then go through the process of training our
SVMs using the labeled and textual data, and then predict-
ing labels for the test-set years. Our results demonstrate that
this strategy works. Our classifiers perform well out of
sample, achieving high or very high precision and recall
scores across the measures of regime type that we are inter-
ested in producing.
Textual data
The first step in our pipeline is choosing textual data to
train our classifiers. We select a corpus of familiar and
well-structured texts describing politics and human-rights
practices each year in all countries worldwide: the Country
Reports on Human Rights Practices published by the US
Department of State, and Freedom House's Freedom in the
World reports. Both of these series of reports have struc-
tures that are explicitly similar and use equivalent concepts
and language to describe political practices in the referent
countries. Further, these reports are available for almost
200 countries for both of these organizations, thus ena-
bling us to produce classifications for a wide variety of
countries.
As the State Department notes on its website, its human
rights reports "cover internationally recognized individual,
civil, political, and worker rights, as set forth in the
Universal Declaration of Human Rights and other interna-
tional agreements". The annual production of State's human
rights reports is mandated by law under the Foreign
Assistance Act of 1961 and the Trade Act of 1974. All UN
member states and other countries receiving US assistance
must be covered.
In its Freedom in the World reports, the US-based
non-governmental organization Freedom House pro-
vides summary descriptions of all countries of the world
and some disputed territories. Per its website, these
descriptions are intended to capture the advance or
decline of "freedom" in each polity, where the idea of
freedom "is grounded in basic standards of political
rights and civil liberties, derived in large measure from
relevant portions of the Universal Declaration of Human
Rights". Freedom House is a non-governmental advo-
cacy group that receives a substantial share of its fund-
ing from the US Government.
We use State Department annual reports on countries'
human rights practices from 1999 to 2013 and Freedom
House's Freedom in the World reports from 1999 to 2014,
Minhas et al 3
which cover the period 1998­2013. These are all of the
reports in the two series that are currently archived online
on the source organizations' websites.1 These reports are
automatically collected from the State Department and
Freedom House websites, and, in the future, we can apply
the same collection methodology to add relevant texts from
other sources into our system of generating measures of
regime type.
Preparing texts
With the textual data collected, we move towards generat-
ing a structured representation of these documents. We first
collate all documents associated with a particular country­
year. In our current implementation, this simply consists of
combining the State and Freedom House textual reports.
From these collated documents, we move towards extract-
ing a set of features--in this case, words or phrases--that
we can use for classification.
To have a relevant set of features on which to do classi-
fication, we first remove items that probably will not pro-
vide any meaningful information on the regime type of
countries. This first involves some mainstream text pro-
cessing techniques such as removing punctuation, stop
words (e.g. "and", "just", "it"), and numbers. We also
remove all proper nouns and acronyms from the docu-
ments. Leaving proper nouns, such as the names of coun-
tries, in the document could be problematic in that the
classification algorithm may assign regime type ratings
based on country names rather than meaningful content
related to political rights and civil liberties. This may bias
predictions for cases in which countries are moving away
or towards a certain regime archetype, as the classifier may
miss out on predicting a change because the country name
is a persistent feature within a document and unique across
the corpus of documents.
After removing unnecessary items, we are still left with
an extremely high number of features. Because the State
and Freedom House reports are so long, the number of fea-
tures for any given document in our corpus reaches into the
hundred of thousands. In addition, for the purposes of clas-
sification, we need to represent the full stack of country­
year documents and features using a vector space, or term
vector, model. This can be thought of as a matrix in which
the rows are country­year documents and the columns are
populated with the features found in every document.
Stacking all of the documents in this way leads to the
creation of an extremely sparse and high-dimensional
matrix, which without further processing would contain a
potentially unmanageable number of columns. Not only
would the number of columns in the matrix be prodigious,
but the features themselves would be repetitive, which
may adversely affect prediction. To deal with this problem,
we lemmatize each of the remaining features. Lemmatizing
is a process through which inflectional endings are
removed and the canonical form of a word is returned. This
process not only reduces the dimensionality of the feature
set; it also better enables us to track similarities between
documents.
The last preprocessing step involves filling in the cross-
sections of our matrices. Here, we calculate the "term-fre-
quency, inverse document frequency" (tf-idf) score for
each feature in every document. This score generates a
measure of the importance of features in a document based
on how frequently they appear across multiple documents.
For example, if a word appears frequently in a single docu-
ment, then it is important to that document, so it receives a
high score. If a word appears in many documents, however,
then even though it may be important, it is not a unique
identifier, so it receives a lower score. Following this scor-
ing system, common words appearing in many documents
will be scaled down, and words that appear frequently in a
single document will be scaled up.
Classification
Using the processed textual data, our goal is to generate
four binary measures of regime type: (1) Democracy, (2)
Military rule, (3) One-party rule, and (4) Monarchy. In
principle, these categories are mutually exclusive. In prac-
tice, however, regime type is inherently uncertain, and any
given regime may exhibit features of more than one of
these ideal types at any time. Consistent with that idea, we
decide to treat each of these archetypes not as different sec-
tions of a single plane but rather as distinct dimensions in a
multi-dimensional regime space, and therefore to train sep-
arate models for each category. Given the flexible nature of
the pipeline that we have established, other regime types
for which labeled data already exist could easily be incor-
porated as well.
We opt to use a supervised learning method to classify
regime type,2 and a supervised method requires labeled
input. To train our regime classification models, we use
pre-existing, human-coded data on national political
regimes from a few widely used sources: Polity; Geddes
et al(2014 hereafter GWF); and Hadenius and Teorell
(2007: hereafter HT); see also Wahman et al. (2013). For
our democracy model, we create a binary variable that
equals one if a country's Polity rating is greater than or
equal to seven. For our models of military rule, one-party
rule, and monarchy, we code our binary indicators as one if
both GWF and HT identify a country­year as belonging to
that category and only that category and zero otherwise. In
other words, we only consider a regime to be sufficiently
representative of each of those authoritarian archetypes if
both sources agree that it belongs in that category and only
that category. Conceptually, we want to learn from the
cases of whose status we are confident, and then leave it to
the models to tell us how closely the more ambiguous cases
approximate those archetypes.
4 Research and Politics 
In choosing an appropriate supervised learning algo-
rithm, we need to take into consideration the structure of
the vector space model used to represent the textual data.
Even with the feature-reduction steps described in the pre-
vious section, the vector space representation of our textual
data is extremely sparse and high dimensional. This is
problematic, because the efficiency of many supervised
learning algorithms, such as neural networks, boosted trees,
and random forests, tends to degrade with the dimensional-
ity of the data (Caruana et al, 2008)
We chose to use SVMs, which have been shown to be
particularly good at dealing with sparse, high-dimensional
data structures such as ours [D'Orazio et al, 2014; Joachims,
1998).3 The goal of our SVMs here is to produce a model
from labeled and processed textual data that we can then
apply to generate labels for country­year observations for
which we do not have labels but do have processed textual
data. SVMs produce this model by finding the optimal
hyperplane to separate the classes of the labeled data (e.g.
democracy and not democracy). The optimal hyperplane is
defined as the one that leads to the maximum margin of
separation between the classes of the labeled data (Chang
and Lin, 2011; Vapnik, 2000). Once this hyperplane is
found, documents on either side correspond to classes of
the binary dependent variable, and new documents can
then be classified according to which side of the hyper-
plane they fall on.
Figure 1 illustrates how a separating hyperplane may be
drawn in the case of two features and perfect separability.4
The two classes of points are designated by blue triangles
and red circles. The goal of an SVM is to find the optimal
separating hyperplane between the two classes of points
that maximizes the margin between the classes' closest
points.
In this example, the optimal separating hyperplane is
designated by the solid line and the margins the dashed line.
The points which fall on the boundaries are called support
vectors. These are designated by darker shades of red and
blue. Having found this hyperplane for a given set of fea-
tures enables us then to easily classify new observations
based on their features. Using this process we can quickly
and objectively classify country-year regime types for
which labels do not already exist.
Research design
To highlight the feasibility and gauge the performance of
this classification approach, we split our sample of exist-
ing labeled data into training and test sets. For the democ-
racy model, we have "ground truth" data from Polity
through 2013, so we set 1999­2008 ( n = 1557 ) as the
training set and 2009­2013 ( n = 707 ) the test set. For the
three authoritarian archetypes, we only have "ground
truth" data from GWF and HT through 2010, so we made
1999­2006 ( n = 1138) the training set and 2007­2010
( n = 583 ) the test set.
The vector space representations of our textual data are
obtained from the Freedom House and State Department
reports, and we process them using the steps described ear-
lier. One additional step that is necessary to undertake
involves determining whether the features represented in the
vector space models should be composed of single words
(unigrams) or phrases (n-grams). We tested a number of
strategies and found that the highest performance in classi-
fying the party and military labels came from using uni-
grams; for monarchy, from n-grams that vary in range from
one to three; and for democracy, from n-grams that vary in
range from two to four.5
Results
The heatmap in Figure 2 summarizes the performance of
the classifiers across our variables of interest in the
out-of-sample test periods. The top two rows of this matrix
designate the accuracy and F-1 scores for our classifiers.
Accuracy provides a measure for the overall correctness of
the model and is calculated as the sum of correct classifica-
tions divided by the total number of classifications. The
accuracy statistic for each of our variables of interest is
greater than or equal to 98%.
The bottom two rows of this matrix designate the preci-
sion and recall scores for our classifiers. For example, in
the case of our monarchy variable, the numerator for both
precision and recall is defined as the number of country­
years classified as a monarchy that were also coded as
being a monarchy by GWF and HT. The denominator for
the precision metric is the total number of country­years
classified as having a monarchy, whereas the denominator
for recall is the total number of country­years labeled as
monarchy by GWF and HT. We achieve 100% precision on
every variable of interest except the democracy label, for
which we still receive a score of 99%. In terms of recall, we
again receive scores of greater than 90% for each of the
metrics except our military label, for which our classifier
receives a score of 67%.
Figure 1. SVM illustration.
Minhas et al 5
The recall metric for the military label is lower because
our SVM classifier differs from the GWF and HT codings
on the cases of Algeria, Pakistan, and Thailand. Figure 3
depicts the classifications received by these three countries
during the test period of 2007 to 2010. The red square
denotes the rating provided by GWF and HT, and the blue
triangle the prediction from the SVM. In the case of Algeria
and Pakistan, the difference results from the SVM classify-
ing the countries as moving away from a militaristic regime
before GWF/HT reached the same conclusion.
Figure 4 highlights a number of the features that were
used by the SVMs to classify country­years into our four
measures of regime type. Blue words in each word cloud
represent features that made it more likely for a country-
year to be classified into a regime type, while red words
indicate features that made it less likely. The size of a word
corresponds to the relative importance of that feature in the
model. As we would expect, phrases such as "free fair elec-
tion" and "right fair trial" are associated with a greater like-
lihood of a country being classified as a democracy, while
features such as "royal" and "king" increase the likelihood
of a country being classified as a monarchy.
The results we have shown so far highlight that the predic-
tions from our classifiers match well against how

Figure 4. Features used by SVM to classify country-years.
country­years in our test set are labeled. For each prediction in
our test set, we can also calculate a "confidence score". These
scores represent the signed distance of a particular country­
year observation from the hyperplane. Distances less than zero
correspond to the cases in which the classifier designates an
observation as not belonging to a particular label, while scores
greater than zero indicate that the observation does belong to
that label. Figure 5 summarizes the out-of-sample confidence
score distributions for each of the four regime types. The score
distributions for the monarchy, party, and military regime
types show that cases not falling into those labels seem to be a
noticeable distance away from the boundary of zero.
Figure 6 shows variance in the SVM confidence scores for
all four regime dimensions in 2009. On the whole, cases fall
out as we would expect them to. For example, the democracy
classifier: confidently identifies Western Europe, Canada,
Australia, and New Zealand as democracies; shows interest-
ing variations in Eastern Europe, Latin America, and South
Asia; and confidently identifies nearly all of the rest of the
world as non-democracies. Meanwhile, the monarchy model
correctly identifies most of the countries of the Arabian
Peninsula, Jordan, and Morocco as monarchies and the rest of
the world as not. The military rule classifier sees Myanmar,
Pakistan, and Algeria as likely cases in 2010 and is less cer-
tain about the absence of military rule in several WestAfrican
and Middle Eastern countries than in the rest of the world.
Last, the map of results from the one-party rule classifier cor-
rectly identifies countries such as China, Laos, Vietnam,
Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan as instances of one-party rule
but mistakenly excludes North Korea from this list in 2009.6
Conclusion
The results described here demonstrate that it is possible to
generate measures of political regime type from publicly
available texts at low cost. Our initial application using fea-
tures derived from a small corpus produced out-of-sample
estimates that closely match observed data on several very
different regime types. These codings have been made
available at the author's dataverse (https://dataverse.har
vard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/
DVN/8MC1LO) and can be extended as additional textual
data becomes available using the pipeline on Github
(https://github.com/hermes829/regimeClassif).
Minhas et al 7
Although the out-of-sample classification accuracy of
our models is very good, we feel that we can improve this
output by incorporating a larger sample of texts. The State
Department and Freedom House texts used so far cover a
narrow set of human-rights practices and political proce-
dures. These practices and procedures are all fundamental
to how we conceive of and observe political regime type,
but they are not the only essential characteristics of regime
type.
In future iterations, we plan to expand the corpus to
include annual or occasional reports that discuss a broader
range of features in each country's national politics.

Eventually, we hope to add news stories to the mix. If we
can develop models that perform well on an amalgamation
of occasional reports and news stories, we will be able to
implement this process in near-real-time, constantly updat-
ing probabilistic measures of regime type for all countries
of the world at very low cost. The pipeline that we have
created to process texts and generate measures of regime
type will make this task easier.

Notes
1. Freedom House recently released its 2015 Freedom in the
World report; however, only a few country-level reports are
currently available. Once reports for all countries have been
released, we can then easily ingest those texts into our pro-
cessing pipeline.
2. In an earlier iteration of this project, we attempted to use unsu-
pervised methods such as latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA).
However, these unsupervised methods produced labeled data
that did not correspond well with existing measures and that
did not reflect meaningful distinctions in regime type.
3. We also experimented with using logistic regression and
naive Bayes learning algorithms but found that the SVM
produced much better results.
4. In real-world applications, training data are rarely perfectly
separable. To deal with this we utilize soft-margin SVMs,
which weight down the influence of data points that fall on
the "wrong" side of the separating hyperplane.
5. This leads to high-dimensional representations for the tex-
tual data associated with each gram choice. The number of
features when using unigrams is equal to almost 25,000,
whereas the number of features using either of the n-gram
approaches surpasses 1 million.
6. North Korea is correctly identified as having a party-based
regime type in other years.
