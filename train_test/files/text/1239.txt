ABSTRACT
Background: The current anemia burden among US preschool chil-
dren and women of childbearing age has not been documented.
Objective: We used data from National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Surveys 1988­1994 and 1999­2002 to examine recent
anemia changes.
Design: We calculated the prevalence of anemia (hemoglobin 
11.0 g/dL at 24 mo, 11.1 g/dL at 24­59 mo, and 12.0 g/dL for
women), iron deficiency anemia (anemia plus abnormal value 2:
serum ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphy-
rin), and high blood lead (10 g/dL) with anemia among children
12­59 mo and women 20­49 y in both surveys. Among women, we
also calculated the prevalence of folate deficiency (erythrocyte fo-
late  317.2 nmol/L) with anemia and high C-reactive protein (10
mg/L) with anemia. Multiple logistic regression was used to com-
pare anemia prevalence between surveys, with control for race and
age.
Results: Anemia declined significantly in children (from 8.0% to
3.6%; OR: 0.4; 95% CI: 0.3, 0.7) and women (10.8% to 6.9%; OR:
0.6;CI:0.4,0.7),buttheprevalenceofirondeficiencyanemiadidnot
change significantly in children (1.5% compared with 1.2%; OR:
0.7; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.5) or women (4.9% compared with 4.1%; OR:
0.8; 95% CI: 0.6, 1.1). Folate deficiency with anemia declined sig-
nificantly in women (from 4.1% to 0.5%; OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.2),
but logistic regression models and standardization indicated that
none of the known possible anemia causes could account for the
decline in total anemia in children or women.
Conclusions: The prevalence of anemia declined significantly
among US women and children between 1988­1994 and 1999­
2002, but this decline was not associated with changes in iron or
folate deficiency, inflammation, or high blood lead. Am J Clin

INTRODUCTION
Anemia is a condition in which the number of red blood cells
or their oxygen-carrying capacity is not adequate to meet normal
physiologic demands (1). Iron deficiency is believed to be the
mostcommoncauseofanemiaworldwide(2),butdeficienciesof
other vitamins, inflammation, infections, and inherited hemo-
globin disorders can also cause anemia (3­5).
Depending on the cause of anemia, the consequences of the
condition are potentially serious and long-lasting. The conse-
quences of iron deficiency anemia--including impaired cogni-
tiveandmotordevelopment(6­9)andincreasedsusceptibilityto
lead poisoning (10, 11) in young children and impaired aerobic
capacity and reduced work productivity (12, 13) in adults--have
been widely reported, but anemia resulting from other nutritional
deficiencies or inflammation can also reflect harmful health con-
ditions. Among other possible causes of nutritional anemia, fo-
late deficiency is associated with an increased risk of neural tube
defects and may also be associated with adverse pregnancy out-
comes, cardiovascular disease, depression, and dementia,
whereas vitamin B-12 deficiency may be associated with an
increased risk of heart disease and neuropathy (14­18). Anemia
resulting from vitamin A deficiency may be linked with impaired
immunity, growth, and vision (19). Anemia can also indicate
inflammation caused by a variety of conditions, including infec-
tion, or it may occur in chronic illnesses such as chronic renal
disease or endocrine disorders that can result in decreased eryth-
ropoiesis (4, 20).
Earlierdataindicatedthattheprevalenceofanemiadeclinedin
the 1970s and 1980s in US preschool children, but not among
women of childbearing age (21, 22). The current burden of ane-
mia in these 2 high-risk groups in the United States is unclear. In
thepresentstudy,weuseddatafrom2recentNationalHealthand
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES 1988­1994 and
1999­2002) to examine recent changes in total anemia preva-
lence. We also investigated between-survey changes in the prev-
alence of several types of anemia, including anemia associated
with iron deficiency, folate deficiency, vitamin B-12 deficiency,
vitamin A deficiency, high blood lead, and inflammation to as-
sess whether these factors played a role in any observed changes

anemia could highlight existing public health interventions that
have been successful or could identify new interventions that
might be considered.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
The NHANES are multistage, nationally representative sur-
veys of the US civilian, noninstitutionalized population (23, 24).
Each participant is interviewed at home, and most participants
also undergo a physical evaluation in a mobile examination cen-
ter. We began with all children aged 12­59 mo and women aged
20­49 y in NHANES 1988­1994 and 1999­2002 who had a
physical exam (1988­1994: n  4812 children, n  5104 wom-
en; 1999­2002: n  1978 children, n  2782 women). We
excluded pregnant women and women whose pregnancy status
could not be ascertained (1988­1994: n  338; 1999­2002: n 
701), any woman with a missing value for red blood cell folate or
C-reactive protein (CRP), and any participant with a missing
value for hemoglobin, serum ferritin, erythrocyte protoporphy-
rin, transferrin saturation, or blood lead. We were unable to
include red blood cell folate or CRP in the children's analyses
because they were assessed only in children 4 y during 1988­
1994 and in children 3 y during 1999­2002. Total exclusions
for missing laboratory data were as follows: n  2026 children
and n  374 women for 1988­1994 and n  776 children and n
 112 women for 1999­2002. After the exclusions, the final
sample size for each survey was as follows: n  2786 children
and n  4392 women for 1988­1994 and n  1202 children and
n  1969 women for 1999­2002.
Phlebotomy refusal was the primary reason for missing labo-
ratory data among children in both surveys (AC Looker, personal
communication) (25). We compared the race/ethnicity distribu-
tion and income status of children excluded for having missing
laboratory values with those of included children and found that
whereas the race/ethnicity distribution was not significantly dif-
ferent in either survey, excluded children in both surveys were
less likely to be of low income (family income 130% of the US
poverty threshold) than were included children (1988­1994:
31% compared with 40%, chi-square test P  0.01; 1999­2002:
34% compared with 44%, chi-square test P  0.01).
In contrast, women excluded in 1999­2002 for having miss-
ing laboratory data were more likely to be of low income than
were their included counterparts (39% compared with 25%, chi-
square test P  0.02). Excluded women were also more likely to
be of non-Hispanic black race/ethnicity than were their included
counterparts in both surveys (1988­1994: 21% compared with
12%, chi-square test P  0.01; 1999­2002: 23% compared with
12%, chi-square test P  0.01).
Finally, because serum vitamin B-12 and retinol were not
measured for the entirety of both surveys, we constructed a sub-
sample of women in each survey who also had data for serum
vitaminB-12(1991­1994:n2506;1999­2002:n1968)and
serum retinol (1988­1994: n  4378; 1999­2000: n  903).
This subanalysis was not possible for children because both
indicators were assessed only in children 4 y during 1988­
1994 and in children 3 y during 1999­2002.
Laboratory methods
In both surveys, blood was collected from study participants
1 y by venipuncture. Hemoglobin was measured as part of a
complete blood count done with a Coulter S-plus Jr in 1988­
1994 and with a Coulter MAXM in 1999­2002 (both from
Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, FL). The laboratory methods for
other indicators were described in detail elsewhere (26­28).
Briefly,serumferritinwasmeasuredbyusingtheBio-RadQuan-
tImune Ferritin immunoradiometric assay (Bio-Rad Laborato-
ries, Hercules, CA), whereas transferrin saturation was calcu-
lated as serum iron divided by total-iron-binding capacity, as
measured by a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention mod-
ification of the automated Technicon AAII-25 ferrozine colori-
metric method (Alpkem TFA analyzer; Alpkem, Clackamas,
OR). Free erythrocyte protoporphyrin was measured in whole
blood by fluorescence extraction by using a modification of the
Sassa method. Red blood cell folate was measured with the
QuantaPhase-I Folate Radioassay Kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories)
from 1988 to 1991 and with the QuantaPhase-II kit from 1991 to
1994 and from 1999 to 2001. The QuantaPhase-II kit reflected
recalibrationoftheassayforwhichappropriateadjustmentswere
made to the 1988­1991 values to make them comparable with
the 1991­2001 values before public release. The QuantaPhase II
assay also measured serum vitamin B-12. During both surveys,
serum CRP was measured by latex-enhanced nephelometry
(lowerlimitofdetection:0.2mg/L).Bloodleadwasmeasuredby
atomicabsorptionspectroscopy,andserumretinolwasmeasured
by HPLC.
Cutoffs and definitions
Hemoglobincutoffsusedtodefineanemiaandcutoffsusedfor
definingabnormalvaluesforindicatorsofironstatus,bloodlead,
red blood cell folate, CRP, retinol, and vitamin B-12 are pre-
sented in Table 1. We defined iron deficiency as having an
abnormal value for 2 of the 3 following indicators: serum
ferritin, transferrin saturation, and erythrocyte protoporphyrin
(29). We defined iron deficiency anemia as iron deficiency plus
anemia.
Statistical analysis
All analyses were conducted with SAS 8.2 with SUDAAN
(SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and used sample weights to ac-
count for differential probabilities of selection and complex sam-
pling design. For children and women in each survey, we first
calculated the prevalence of total anemia. Among children, we
then calculated the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia, the
prevalence of high blood lead with anemia, and the prevalence of
the coexistence of iron deficiency, high blood lead, and anemia.
Among women, we calculated the prevalence of iron deficiency
anemia, folate deficiency with anemia, high CRP with anemia,
high blood lead with anemia, and the coexistence of 2 of these
conditions with anemia. We also calculated the prevalence of
vitamin B-12 deficiency with anemia and the prevalence of vi-
tamin A with anemia among women in the sub-sample.
We then used multiple logistic regression to compare overall
anemiaprevalenceandtype-specificanemiaprevalencebetween
the surveys for children and women, controlling for race/ethnic-
ity, sex (in the children's models), and age. We further adjusted
the children's overall anemia model for iron deficiency and high
blood lead and the women's overall anemia model for iron de-
ficiency, high blood lead, folate deficiency, and high CRP to
assesstheroleofthesepotentialcausesofanemiainanyobserved
change in anemia prevalence.

Becausepreliminaryanalysesandrecentlypublisheddata(36)
indicated that the prevalence of folate deficiency declined sig-
nificantly among women of childbearing age between the sur-
veys, we used direct standardization to examine the possible
effect this decline had on the prevalence of anemia between the
surveys (37).
Finally,toinvestigatethepossibilityofasystematicdifference
in hemoglobin measurement between the surveys, we con-
structedmean-differenceplotsforhemoglobinamongwomenby
subtracting hemoglobin values at each percentile in 1988­1994
from hemoglobin values at the corresponding percentile in
1999­2002 and plotting this difference on the y axis, with he-
moglobin in the first survey on the x axis (38).
RESULTS
The racial distribution and income status for children and
women were similar between the 2 surveys, although women in
1999­2002 tended to have a higher prevalence of family income
130% of the Federal Poverty Threshold than did women in
1988­1994 (P  0.05; Table 2).
Amongchildren,theprevalenceofall-causeanemiadecreased
significantly between the 2 surveys, falling from 8.0% to 3.6%,
with a corresponding adjusted odds ratio (OR) of 0.4 (95% CI:
0.3, 0.7; Table 3). However, the prevalence of iron deficiency
anemia was low ( 2%) and did not change significantly be-
tween the surveys (OR: 0.7; 95% CI: 0.4, 1.5). The prevalence of
highbloodleadwithanemiadeclinedsignificantly,butwas1%
in either survey. Coexisting iron deficiency, high blood lead and
anemia was rare in either survey.
The prevalence of all-cause anemia also declined significantly
among women, falling 4 percentage points from 10.8% to 6.9%
(OR: 0.6; 95% CI: 0.4, 0.7; Table 3). Iron deficiency anemia was
the predominant known type of anemia among women in both
surveys, but its prevalence did not change significantly (OR: 0.8;
95% CI: 0.6, 1.1). The prevalence of folate deficiency with ane-
mia, however, declined significantly by almost 4 percentage
points (from 4.1% to 0.5%; OR: 0.1; 95% CI: 0.1, 0.2), and the
proportion of women with 2 types of anemia declined by more
than a percentage point. Further analysis showed that 70% of
the women in 1988­1994 who had 2 types of anemia had con-
current iron and folate deficiency (data not shown). High blood
lead, inflammation, vitamin A deficiency, and vitamin B-12 de-
ficiency concurrent with anemia were rare among women in both
surveys (1%; subsample data not shown).
Type-specific anemia patterns remained when we stratified by
race/ethnicity category (Table 4). The prevalence of anemia

declined significantly in each race/ethnicity group, but the prev-
alence of iron deficiency anemia did not change significantly in
any group and remained high among both black (12%) and Mex-
ican American (8%) women. The prevalence of folate deficiency
with anemia declined significantly in each race/ethnicity group.
Multiple logistic regression showed, however, that none of the
potential anemia causes fully explained the decline in anemia
among children or women. When we modeled anemia among
children as a function of survey (1999­2002 compared with
1988­1994), race/ethnicity, age, and sex, the OR for the survey
was 0.42 (Table 3; second row). The OR remained 0.42 when
iron deficiency and high blood lead were added to the model.
Similarly, among women, the OR for the survey was 0.56 in the
model that adjusted only for race/ethnicity and age (Table 3;
second row) and was 0.46 after the model was adjusted for iron
deficiency, folate deficiency, high blood lead, and high CRP.
Preliminary analyses showed that the prevalence of folate
deficiency among women in our sample was 36% in 1988­1994
and 4.5% in 1999­2002. To assess further whether this decline
played a role in the decline in anemia that we observed, we
used direct standardization and found that if the prevalence of
folate deficiency had remained 36% in both surveys, the prev-
alence of anemia would have declined from 11% to 8%, sim-
ilar to the decline in unadjusted prevalences of 11% to 7%
(Table 3). Furthermore, additional analyses showed that
among nonfolate-deficient women in each survey, the preva-
lence of anemia also declined from 11% to 7% between the
surveys.

To assess the possibility of a systematic error in hemoglobin
measurement, we constructed mean-difference plots for hemo-
globin among women by subtracting hemoglobin values at each
hemoglobin percentile in 1988­1994 from the hemoglobin val-
uesatthecorrespondingpercentilein1999­2002(Figure1).We
then plotted this difference (in g/dL) along the y axis with he-
moglobin in 1988­1994 along the x axis. For example, among
black women, the 10th, 50th, and 90th percentiles of hemoglobin
were 11.1, 12.6, and 13.8 g/dL, respectively, in the first survey
and were 11.1, 12.7, and 14.1 g/dL, respectively, in the second
survey. The differences in these percentile values (1999­2002
minus 1988­1994) were 0.0, 0.1, and 0.3 g/dL, which fall along
the line in the middle panel of the Figure 1. We found that the
magnitude of change in hemoglobin values differed by race/
ethnicity group, with a greater increase in hemoglobin observed
among white (median difference: 0.34) and Mexican Ameri-
can (0.37) women than among black women (0.13).
DISCUSSION
The prevalence of anemia declined significantly between
1988­1994 and 1999­2002 among US preschool-aged children
and women of childbearing age, but the cause of this decline was
largely unexplained. The prevalence of iron deficiency anemia
remained low and unchanged between the 2 surveys in both
groups, and although the prevalence of folate deficiency with
anemia did decline significantly among women, changes in the
prevalence of folate deficiency accounted for little of the overall
decline in anemia. Inflammation, high blood lead, vitamin B-12
deficiency, and vitamin A deficiency concurrent with anemia
were not common in either survey.
The majority of anemia among children in both surveys was
not associated with iron deficiency or high blood lead. The ob-
served low prevalence of iron deficiency anemia among US
preschool children was likely the result of concerted efforts to
prevent iron deficiency anemia in this vulnerable age group,
including iron fortification of infant formulas and establishment
of The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women,
Infants, and Children in the early 1970s (21, 39­41). Blood lead
concentrations have also declined significantly since the 1970s,
largelybecauseoftheremovalofleadfromgasolineandsoldered
cans (42, 43).
The cause of the decline in the prevalence of anemia among
children between the surveys is thus unclear, and, unfortunately,
the lack of data on folate, vitamin B-12, serum retinol, and CRP
among children surveyed in this age group limited our investi-
gation of potential causes. Others have reported the importance
of common infections, including upper respiratory tract infec-
tion, otitis media, and gastroenteritis as causes of anemia in
preschool-aged children (20), but whether the frequency of these
infections decreased sufficiently between the surveys to contrib-
ute to the decline in all-cause anemia among children is not
known.
Iron deficiency anemia was the predominant type of anemia
among women in both surveys and was most prevalent in black
and Mexican American women. The cause of the persistently
high prevalence among women in these race/ethnicity groups
merits further attention, but may be due to lower socioeconomic
status, lower attained education, or higher parity, all of which are
associated with iron deficiency in women of childbearing age
(30). Nevertheless, the prevalence of iron deficiency anemia did
not change significantly between the 2 surveys among all women
or in any race/ethnicity group and thus seems unlikely to explain
the significant decline in the prevalence of all-cause anemia.
We did observe a significant decline in the prevalence of
concurrent folate deficiency and anemia among women, but this
decline appeared to be the result of concomitant, but unrelated,
declines in both folate deficiency and anemia. Several authors
have reported multiple beneficial effects of the 1998 folic acid
fortification of all US enriched cereal-grain products, including
a reduced prevalence of neural tube disorders (44, 45) and lower
concentrations of homocysteine (46, 47). No study has evaluated
the effect of folic acid fortification on anemia. The timing of
NHANES 1988­1994 (before fortification) and 1999­2002 (af-
ter fortification) permitted us to evaluate such an association, but
regression and standardization results failed to prove a relation.
Another possible cause of the observed decline in anemia was
a systematic difference in hemoglobin measurement between the
surveys, introduced by the use of 2 different models of Coulter
counter. A direct investigation, in which both instruments are
used to measure hemoglobin on the same sera samples, was not
possible because the instruments used in 1988­1994 were no
longer available. We instead used an indirect approach to assess
this possibility by subtracting hemoglobin values at various per-
centiles of the first survey from hemoglobin values at the corre-
sponding percentiles of the second survey and then plotting this
difference on the y axis with hemoglobin in the first survey on the
x axis. These results suggest that a systematic difference in he-
moglobin concentrations between the 2 surveys did not play a
major role in the observed decline in the prevalence of anemia,
because the patterns and magnitude of hemoglobin differences
were different for each race/ethnicity group.

Important health trends over the past 3 decades, specifically
the decline in cigarette smoking (48) and the increase in over-
weight and obesity (49, 50), have the potential to affect anemia
rates, but likely in a direction opposite of what we observed.
Among women in NHANES II, smokers had a significantly
highermeanhemoglobinconcentrationthandidnonsmokersand
a lower prevalence of anemia (51), but the declining smoking
rates between 1988 and 2002 (48) would be more consistent with
a lower hemoglobin concentration and a higher prevalence of
anemia. Similarly, overweight may be associated with an in-
creasedriskofirondeficiency(52),whereasahighprepregnancy
body mass has been found to be associated with a greater risk of
postpartum anemia (53), but both would be consistent with an
increase, rather than with a decline, in anemia.
A limitation of our study was the possibility of selection bias
introduced by the large number of children with missing labora-
tory data, due primarily to phlebotomy refusal. Although the
race/ethnicity of children with missing laboratory data was not
significantly different from included children, included children
were significantly more likely to be of low income, which po-
tentially inflated the anemia estimates. However, the relative
amountofbiasbyincomeinthe2surveysappearssimilar(1988­
1994: 31% low income in the excluded sample compared with
40% in the included sample; 1999­2002: 34% compared with
44%). This finding suggests that the difference in prevalence
between the surveys observed in our study was unlikely to be
seriously affected.
Whereas a much smaller proportion of women than children
were excluded because of missing laboratory values, excluded
women in both surveys were more like to be of non-Hispanic
black race/ethnicity than were included women, perhaps leading
to an underestimation of total anemia and/or iron deficiency
anemia. Again, however, the relative amount of bias by race in
the 2 surveys appeared to be similar (1988­1994: 21% low
income in the excluded sample compared with 12% in the in-
cluded sample; 1999­2002: 23% compared with 12%). Ex-
cludedwomenalsotendedtohaveahigherprevalenceofpoverty
in 1999­2002. Adjustment for poverty in multivariate models
for anemia, however, did not change the OR estimates, which
made it unlikely that this finding significantly affected our over-
all results.
Our restricted ability to assess inflammation was an additional
limitation. CRP tends to peak and diminish rapidly and thus may
not reflect more chronic inflammatory conditions (54). We were
also unable to account for other possible causes of anemia, in-
cluding hemoglobinopathies, cancer, and aplastic anemia result-
ing from reduced red blood cell production; however, these con-
ditions were probably not common in the children and young
adult women.
In summary, we observed a significant decline in the preva-
lence of all-cause anemia between 1988­1994 and 1999­2002.
Whereas the explanation for the decline remains unclear, the
reduced anemia burden among US children and women is nota-
bleinthatanemiaitselfisassociatedwithmultipleadversehealth
outcomes, including mild-to-moderate mental retardation in
children (55) and low infant birth weight and increased risk of
preterm birth in pregnant women (56). Although iron deficiency
anemia was not prevalent among preschool-aged children in
eithersurvey,itremainsprevalentamongwomenofchildbearing
age, particularly among black and Mexican American women.
Further investigation of the lack of association between folate
deficiency and anemia may warrant further investigation.
