REVIEW
Cigarette Smoking
Andrew W. Bergen, Neil Caporaso
Cigarette smoking is the largest preventable risk factor for
morbidity and mortality in developed countries. Dramatic
changes in the prevalence of cigarette smoking in the second
half of this century in the United States (i.e., a reduction
among men and an increase among women) have reduced
current smoking levels to approximately one quarter of the
adult population and have reduced differences in smoking
prevalence and smoking-attributable diseases between the
sexes. Current smoking in the United States is positively
associated with younger age, lower income, reduced educa-
tional achievement, and disadvantaged neighborhood envi-
ronment. Daily smokers smoke cigarettes to maintain nico-
tine levels in the brain, primarily to avoid the negative effects
of nicotine withdrawal, but also to modulate mood. Regular
smokers exhibit higher and lower levels of stress and
arousal, respectively, than nonsmokers, as well as higher
impulsivity and neuroticism trait values. Nicotine depen-
dence is the single most common psychiatric diagnosis in the
United States, and substance abuse, major depression, and
anxiety disorders are the most prevalent psychiatric comor-
bid conditions associated with nicotine dependence. Studies
in twins have implicated genetic factors that explain most of
the variability in vulnerability to smoking and in persistence
of the smoking phenotype. Future research into the causes of
smoking must take into account these associated demo-
graphics, social factors, comorbid psychiatric conditions,
and genetic factors to understand this complex human be-
havior. [J Natl Cancer Inst 1999;91:1365­75]
Cigarette smoking, hereafter referred to as "smoking," is the
largest single risk factor for premature death in developed coun-
tries. Approximately one fifth of the deaths in the United States
are attributable to smoking, and 28% of the smoking-attributable
deaths involve lung cancer, 37% involve vascular disease, and
26% involve other respiratory diseases (1). More than 400000
deaths per year and 30% of all cancers in the United States are
attributable to smoking (2). Lung cancer is the largest single
cause of cancer-associated mortality (3) and is the most common
cause of smoking-related mortality in the United States (4). The
attributable risk from smoking for oral, pharyngeal, and esoph-
ageal cancers is substantial, although less than that for lung
cancer (5,6). The attributable risk from both smoking and alco-
hol consumption accounts for the majority of both oral and
pharyngeal cancers (5) and of esophageal cancer (7). Morbidity
and mortality attributable to smoking would decline in the future
if reductions in smoking prevalence were to be observed. How-
ever, despite dramatic declines in adult male smoking preva-
lence in the United States observed from the 1960s through the
1990s (8), the decline in current adult smoking prevalence
slowed by about 1990 (9), and recent surveys of current smoking
in youth, defined as cigarette use on at least one of the last 30
days preceding the survey, show a statistically significant in-
crease (from 27.5% in 1991 to 36.4% in 1997) (10). The preva-
lence of current smoking among adults in the United States,
defined as smoking daily or smoking on some days (11), is now
about 23% in women and 27% in men and is statistically
significantly higher in those less than 65 years of age; in those
with 9­11 years of education; in those below the poverty thresh-
old; in whites, blacks, and American Indians/Alaskan Natives;
and in military veterans (9,12­15). Projected demographic and
smoking prevalence trends suggest that the absolute number
of current smokers in the United States, about 47 million
individuals in 1995, will continue to increase, especially in
those below the poverty threshold, in those with less than 13
years of education, and in those greater than or equal to 65 years
of age (9,15­18).
Smoking prevalence in men worldwide is higher than it is in
the United States, while smoking prevalence among women
worldwide is usually less than the prevalence in men, although
it has equaled or exceeded that in men in some northern Euro-
pean countries (19,20). While annual per capita cigarette con-
sumption has dropped in developed countries from a high of
more than 3000 in the 1970s to about 2600 in 1990, it is in-
creasing in developing countries (260% increase in China be-
tween 1970 and 1990), so that worldwide annual per capita
cigarette consumption has not changed substantially over the last
25 years (20). Because of the delayed health effects of smoking,
morbidity and mortality in developing countries attributable to
smoking have not yet surpassed those in developed countries but
are likely to do so in the next century (20,21).
The study of biomarkers in smoking-attributable cancer has
concentrated on measures of exposure (i.e., cotinine, NNAL-
Gluc1), dose (i.e., carcinogen­macromolecular adducts, such as
4-amino biphenyl hemoglobin adducts), micronutrients (i.e.,
-carotene), and genetic factors that may modify these factors or
their effects (22). The investigation of such biomarkers is predi-
cated on the assumption that an enhanced understanding of
metabolic mechanisms will help to identify susceptible groups
or individuals and direct future research or prevention efforts.
Another group of risk factors for lung cancer and other smoking-
related cancers are those that are associated with smoking, its
initiation, and its persistence. We will review factors associated
with current and persistent smoking that have been studied by
use of pharmacologic, epidemiologic, behavior genetic, psycho-
logic, and psychiatric perspectives. The identification of those

smoking will provide biologic and social variables with which to
investigate mechanisms that contribute to the persistence of this
behavioral phenotype. Improved understanding of these mecha-
nisms may enable improved cancer prevention and control ef-
forts.
METHODS
The purpose of this review is to describe and evaluate demographic, psycho-
social, and biologic factors found to show statistically significant associations
with current and persistent cigarette smoking in order to make research recom-
mendations concerning which covariates are important in the study of the human
phenotype of cigarette smoking. Published English-language papers of all types
were collected over a 12-month period from October 1997 to October 1998 by
use of the portion of the MEDLINE® database from 1985 to the present and
various combinations of the following terms: smoking, smoking cessation, epi-
demiology, prevalence, nicotine, cotinine, acetylcholine, nicotinic acetylcholine
receptors, lung cancer, oral cancer, drug abuse and dependence, alcohol depen-
dence, depression, twin studies, and animal model studies. Reports from the
Surgeon General, monographs, and internet sites were also searched for relevant
studies and evaluated for inclusion in this review. The purpose of the search was
to gather studies on the cigarette smoking phenotype from the epidemiologic,
pharmacologic, psychiatric, and psychologic literature. Studies evaluated for
associated factors included the following: case­control and case­case studies of
demographic, genetic, psychiatric, and psychologic variables; factor analyses of
case series; twin studies; and animal model studies. To distinguish between
studies included or excluded, the criteria of sample size, validated or controlled
measures of phenotype, established analytic approaches, and reasonable inter-
pretation were used for evaluation. The narrative method was used to provide
examples of the evidence presented in the studies reviewed. The method used to
make research recommendations was to identify those phenotypes that were
consistently and statistically significantly associated with current cigarette smok-
ing.
SMOKING AND NICOTINE
Addiction to nicotine has been established as the psychophar-
macologic mechanism that maintains cigarette smoking behav-
ior (23). Nicotine activates the brain's mesolimbic dopaminergic
reward system (24,25) and produces dependence resulting in
physical and neurobiologic withdrawal symptoms on abrupt ces-
sation (26,27). In rodent and primate animal models of drug
addiction, once study subjects are trained in a controlled sched-
ule paradigm to avoid the aversive effects of high concentrations
of nicotine, nicotine is self-administered (28­31). Nicotine acts
as an agonist for neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptors
(nAChRs)--pentameric ionotropic (Na+ and Ca2+) receptors
found presynaptically throughout the central nervous system
(CNS) and postsynaptically in the autonomic nervous system--
that modulate the release of neurotransmitters and ganglionic
potentials (32). After chronic nicotine treatment (33­35),
nAChR numbers are increased, particularly the most common
nAChR type in the mammalian brain, the 42 heteromer
(36,37). The increased numbers of nAChRs upon chronic nico-
tine treatment is associated with the development of behavioral
tolerance to nicotine in animal models and is statistically sig-
nificantly related to intensity and duration of smoking history in
human postmortem brain (34,38). Nicotine also acts as an an-
tagonist, not because the increased numbers of nAChRs are as-
sociated with an increase in nAChR messenger RNA (39,40) or
a change in binding parameters of nicotine to the receptor (33­
35) but rather because of a reduction in nAChR turnover and
accumulation of nAChR at the cell surface (41). Short- and
long-term desensitization kinetics of 42 receptor suggest that
desensitization and inactivation are two different allosteric states
that may be responsible for the acute and chronic nicotine tol-
erance observed in humans and in animals (41,42).
Smokers of cigarettes increase smoking intensity, smoking
rate, or inhalation to maintain levels of nicotine, as measured by
plasma levels of nicotine in both ad libitum and laboratory
smoking settings (43­46). Measured nicotine levels in the arte-
rial and venous circulation indicate that individual smokers can
obtain plasma nicotine levels of 20­50 ng/mL (46­48). This
concentration range (100­300 nM) is one order of magnitude
less than the equilibrium binding and activation concentration of
l-nicotine to the 42 receptor, the predominant nAChR in the
brain, but is nearly equal to the effective concentration for in-
activation and accumulation of the 42 receptor (49,183).
Nicotine absorption per cigarette has been measured both by
graphical methods from nicotine concentration curves obtained
from plasma blood measurements (46) and by parametric calcu-
lation by use of stable isotope studies of nicotine to cotinine
conversion and nicotine and cotinine clearance values obtained
in inpatient-infusion studies (47). These studies suggest that
smokers are extracting approximately 1­2 mg of nicotine per
cigarette. The total amount of nicotine per cigarette measured by
smoking machines by use of human smoking parameters of puff
volume, duration, and frequency is about 2­3 mg per cigarette
(50,51), suggesting that smokers absorb more than half of the
inhaled nicotine. However, none of these methods measures the
peak brain concentration of nicotine, which is presumed to be
the major pharmacologic factor that mediates reward, depen-
dence, and the development of tolerance. Studies of dosing
kinetics in animal models demonstrate the development of
higher levels of tolerance with higher peak concentrations
(31,52).
One behavioral mechanism responsible for differences in
nicotine consumption may be related to variation in nicotine and
cotinine metabolism (53­55). Nicotine from tobacco smoke is
absorbed quickly (in seconds) throughout the body on initial
dosing (46,48) and then is eliminated with a half-life of 2­3
hours (56). Nicotine is metabolized principally (80%) to coti-
nine by cytochrome P450 2A6 (47,57,58), which is also respon-
sible for much of the metabolism of cotinine (59) and for much
of the activation of the potent tobacco smoke carcinogen NNK
(60). The typical smoker experiences a nicotine concentration
nadir in the morning after overnight abstinence and then smokes
to increase nicotine levels over the first few hours of the day and
to maintain a plateau throughout the remainder of the day (46).
Clearance of nicotine in humans is primarily diurnal, peaking at
midday, with spikes of increased clearance after meals, which is
concordant with increased human smoking rates early in the day,
lowest smoking rates in the evening, and increased smoking
after meals (61).
P450 2A6 activity varies approximately 50-fold in humans as
measured by analysis of protein levels and in kinetic experi-
ments with liver samples (58,62,63). The basis for constitutive
differences in activity has been associated with variant CYP2A6
alleles encoding inactive enzyme (62,64­67). A statistically sig-
nificantly reduced frequency of two CYP2A6 null alleles in
nicotine (and alcohol)-dependent smoking-clinic patients versus
never nicotine-dependent individuals and a statistically signifi-
cant negative association with the numbers of cigarettes smoked
per week have been reported (68). This study needs to be rep-
licated in additional samples to confirm the possible role of
inherited variation at the CYP2A6 locus in smoking behavior.

Misspecification of the CYP2A6 genotype because of incom-
pletely specific CYP2A6 genotyping assays (64,67) may affect
the statistical significance of findings relating CYP2A6 alleles to
smoking behavior.
Plasma and urinary nicotine and cotinine concentrations have
repeatedly been found to be associated with the number of ciga-
rettes smoked per day (69­71). Since cotinine has a half-life an
order of magnitude greater than that of nicotine, it is useful as a
biomarker in smoking surveys, smoking cessation trials, and the
assessment of exposure to environmental cigarette smoke
(72,73). Interindividual variation in the conversion of nicotine to
cotinine and in the clearance of cotinine may have effects on
nicotine consumption and dependence (53). For example, coti-
nine levels were found to be higher in African-Americans than
in Caucasian-Americans or Mexican-Americans, after adjust-
ment was made for reported cigarette smoking (74). While nico-
tine metabolism was not found to be statistically significantly
different in African-Americans and Caucasian-Americans, mean
nonrenal and total metabolism (clearance) of cotinine was
shown to be significantly lower in African-Americans than in
Caucasian-Americans (74,75). Calculation of nicotine intake per
cigarette on the basis of the inpatient infusion studies also indi-
cates that African-Americans absorb statistically significantly
more nicotine per cigarette smoked than do Caucasian-
Americans (75). This suggests that differences in the numbers of
cigarettes smoked among African-American and Caucasian-
American smokers (76,77) may be influenced by metabolic dif-
ferences between the groups.
GENETIC FACTORS ASSOCIATED WITH
CIGARETTE SMOKING
Evidence for genetic determinants affecting the smoking phe-
notype has steadily accumulated both from studies of substance
abuse in animals and from analysis of the contributions of ge-
netics and personality to substance abuse in humans (78,79).
Two recent linkage studies in humans (80,81) have indicated
regions of the genome in which loci affecting nicotine depen-
dence and ever smoking may be found with further work. How-
ever, an appreciation of the neurotransmitter-related mecha-
nisms involved in reward circuits in the human brain has
suggested many candidate loci potentially associated with nico-
tine dependence (54). The first genetic association studies in
humans at dopaminergic loci (82­88) have reported statistically
significant differences in the allele frequencies between smokers
and nonsmokers at markers linked to the genes coding for the
D1, D2, and D4 dopamine receptors and at the dopamine trans-
porter, consistent with the dopaminergic reward hypothesis of
nicotine dependence (89).
As in some previous studies of the D2 dopamine receptor in
case­control studies of substance abuse (90), the less frequent
allele (A1) at a genetic marker flanking the dopamine receptor
D2 coding sequence (DRD2) was found to be at a higher fre-
quency in the collections of smokers versus nonsmokers (82,83).
In a sample of smokers undergoing a limited smoking cessation
intervention, a protective association with a particular allele (al-
lele 9) at the dopamine transporter (SLC6A3) was observed with
smoking status, age at smoking initiation, and history of quitting,
and the protective association with smoking status was stronger
in those individuals with DRD2 A2 genotypes (88). Since the
DRD2 A1 allele has been found previously to be associated with
lower D2 receptor densities (91) and the SLC6A3 allele 9 has
been associated with excess dopamine after cocaine abuse (92),
this suggests that the protective association with smoking status
observed may be due to normal densities of DRD2 receptors and
increased synaptic dopamine that may provide some resistance
to nicotine dependence (88). At the D4 dopamine receptor locus,
allele DRD4.7, found previously to be associated with novelty
seeking and substance abuse in some case­control studies (93),
was found in African-Americans, but not in Caucasian-
Americans, to be associated with smoking status, intensity, per-
sistence, and initiation. In Caucasian-Americans, a statistically
significant association of allele 4 of the DRD4 receptor (not
associated with novelty seeking) with smoking for the regulation
of mood in depressed smokers was observed (87), suggesting
that the DRD4 locus may affect smoking behavior in depressed
individuals as well as increase vulnerability to nicotine depen-
dence in some populations (86). These preliminary candidate
gene studies need to be repeated in larger samples, in samples
with similar and different ethnic origins, and in family-based
samples to confirm the effect of these alleles on vulnerability to
nicotine dependence, to explore the effect in samples that differ
in allele frequency and smoking prevalence, and to control for
potential confounding in case­control samples. Future studies
involving neurobiologic candidate loci that potentially affect
smoking behavior should also emphasize the analysis of func-
tional genetic polymorphisms or of linkage disequilibrium struc-
ture to identify haplotypes potentially carrying functional poly-
morphisms (94).
Genetic epidemiologic studies using the twin-study design
(95), where multiple genetic and environmental risk factors and
a threshold disease model are modeled by use of concordance
data in monozygotic and dizygotic twins, have estimated the
effects of genetic and environmental factors on current smoking,
smoking initiation, and smoking persistence (96). A reanalysis
of seven twin studies from Scandinavia, the United States, and
Australia estimated that a mean of 60% of the variance in risk of
being a current smoker in men and women is accounted for by
additive genetic effects, with most studies demonstrating statis-
tically nonsignificant shared environment effects (96). From the
same studies, the mean additive genetic effect on the liability to
smoking initiation (i.e., becoming a smoker) was estimated to be
57%, with an estimated mean shared environmental effect of
17%. From three of the studies where data were available to
assess the relative contributions to smoking persistence, the
mean additive genetic effect was estimated to be 69%, with
statistically nonsignificant estimated shared environmental ef-
fects. A recent analysis of smoking initiation and persistence
among twin pairs in the Vietnam Era Twin Registry found that
the best-fitting model included statistically significant additive
genetic factors (explaining 50% of variance in risk) and both
shared (family, 30% of variance) and specific (to one twin)
environmental factors (20% of variance) for smoking initiation.
For smoking persistence, however, only genetic and specific
environmental factors were found to be statistically significant,
explaining approximately 70% and 30% of the variation, respec-
tively (97). Thus, twin studies estimate that the majority of the
liability to become and to remain a smoker is explained by
additive genetic factors. A variable remaining portion of the risk
is estimated to be related to specific environmental effects, but
there is no consistent, statistically significant evidence for a
shared or common environment effect.
To assess whether the decline in smoking initiation in men
Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 91, No. 16, August 18, 1999 REVIEW 1367
and the increase in smoking initiation in women have led to a
change in the interaction of genetic and environmental effects
with birth cohort, three large twin studies were reanalyzed that
covered birth cohorts from the early 1900s to the mid-1960s
(98). Researchers tested heterogeneity of twin tetrachoric corre-
lations across samples and across sex and found increased ge-
netic effects in men in two of the samples compared with the
third sample; however, there was no genetic heterogeneity by
age cohort (98). The modeling of age-related changes in the
effects of genetic and environmental factors in smoking initia-
tion in adolescent twin pairs showed that genetic effects in-
creased with age; however, shared environmental effects, which
explain the majority of variation in risk at early ages (12­16
years), were not statistically significant in early adulthood (99).
Family studies of the relatives of substance-dependent individu-
als ascertained in treatment settings, with control subjects lo-
cated via a random-digit-dialing protocol, suggest that there are
both general factors increasing vulnerability to substance abuse
and specific factors increasing vulnerability to specific drugs,
including habitual smoking (100). Family studies of the siblings
of alcoholic and nonalcoholic probands ascertained in treatment
and nontreatment settings identified the sibling's own sex, birth
cohort, and comorbid substance dependence as statistically sig-
nificant predictors of habitual smoking (defined as a smoking
history of 20 cigarettes per day for 6 months) (101). Only
habitual smoking in the proband, but not other substance abuse,
was a statistically significant predictor of habitual smoking in
siblings, suggesting a specific risk factor for nicotine depen-
dence.
SMOKING MOTIVES, PERSONALITY FACTORS, AND
NICOTINE DEPENDENCE
Personality and behavioral studies have suggested why some
people are more likely to smoke and what smokers perceive that
they derive from smoking tobacco. Research in motives for
smoking posits a limited number of factors based on responses
to questions concerning hypothesized reasons for smoking (102­
104). These factors have been constructed from psychosocial
models of various motives for smoking, such as smoking to
modify affect, smoking to relax, food substitution smoking, etc.
(105). Investigation of the correlation structure among these hy-
pothesized motives for smoking provided consistent and statis-
tically significant support for six of these factors: addiction,
automatic, stimulation, psychosocial, indulgent, and sensorimo-
tor manipulation (105,106). Interfactor correlation analysis sug-
gested that the first three factors loaded onto a second-order
pharmacologic factor and the last three loaded onto a nonphar-
macologic factor (106).
Smokers experience self-reported increases in arousal and
decreases in stress after smoking cigarettes, with absolute levels
of arousal and stress peaking in midday and in the morning,
respectively (107). Smokers experience stimulation and se-
dation simultaneously from each cigarette; however, they
also experience lower equilibrium levels of arousal and
higher equilibrium levels of stress than nonsmokers. After
smoking cessation, mean arousal and stress levels are increased
and reduced, respectively, suggesting that smoking cigarettes
may contribute to the increased stress observed in smokers
(108).
Personality and temperament constructs that use question-
naires to measure heritable personality dimensions quantita-
tively, e.g., Cloninger's Tridimensional Personality Question-
naire (79,109), have been used to investigate personality
traits. Novelty seeking, extraversion, impulsivity, and neuroti-
cism have been identified as the personality factors found at
higher levels among smokers than among nonsmokers
(110­113). That both dependent and nondependent smokers
exhibit similarly increased sensation-seeking scores relative
to nonsmokers suggests that, while increased sensation-
seeking may increase liability to smoking initiation, it may
not be related to differences in nicotine dependence among
smokers.
Fagerstrom and colleagues proposed an eight-question
"Tolerance Questionnaire" (FTQ) in 1978 (114) and a revised
questionnaire (115), the Fagerstrom Test for Nicotine
Dependence (FTND), in an attempt to provide quantitative
information on nicotine dependence to assist in cessation
therapy. FTQ and FTND scores have been found to show
statistically significant associations with biochemical
measures related to the quantity of cigarettes smoked (plasma
nicotine, plasma or urinary cotinine, and expired CO)
and are also associated with cessation outcome in trials without
nicotine replacement therapy (115,116). FTQ and FTND scores
have not been consistently correlated with percent abstinent
at the end of the placebo-controlled trials with
nicotine-replacement therapy; when they are predictive, they ex-
plain only 1% of the variation (116,117). FTND scores from
population-based samples of smokers are statistically signifi-
cantly lower than scores from smokers seeking cessation help
(118).
A small fraction of active cigarette smokers are known
as chippers or nondependent smokers, defined as smoking five
or fewer cigarettes per day (119). Compared with regular
smokers, chippers were found to extract similar amounts
of nicotine per cigarette and to exhibit similar elimination
half-lives of nicotine but to be statistically significantly
less nicotine dependent and to have begun their smoking
careers significantly more slowly (119­121). Regular smokers
scored higher on pharmacologic smoking motive factors, and
chippers scored higher on nonpharmacologic smoking motive
factors (122). Chippers and regular smokers both appear
to smoke for affect management; however, unlike regular
smokers, chippers do not crave cigarettes and exhibit lower lev-
els of smoking for stimulation and smoking to relieve negative
affect.
The establishment of nicotine dependence in the American
Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (DSM), third edition, represented the noso-
logic and diagnostic recognition of this drug dependency (123).
The DSM-III/DSM-IV diagnosis of nicotine dependence
(305.10) requires a minimum of three of seven diagnostic symp-
toms: tolerance, withdrawal, greater use than intended, persistent
desire to quit, great amounts of time spent smoking, activities
given up or reduced due to smoking, and continued smoking
despite knowledge of having a persistent physical or psycho-
logic problem with the substance (123,124). The DSM-IV diag-
nosis of nicotine withdrawal (292.0) requires four or more symp-
toms of eight to appear after abrupt cessation of tobacco use
(124). A diagnosis of nicotine abuse is not recognized in either
the DSM-III-R or the DSM-IV, primarily because nicotine does
1368 REVIEW Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 91, No. 16, August 18, 1999
not meet two of the major criteria for a diagnosis of substance
abuse. Specifically, nicotine is not considered to produce intoxi-
cation, and a diagnosis other than nicotine dependence would
not be appropriate for maladaptive use of the substance (125).
Nicotine dependence is a model for drug dependence, where
tobacco smoking fulfills the physiologic, behavioral, and social
characteristics of a dependence syndrome, but it also acts as a
gateway drug for other drugs of abuse (126). However, the mor-
bidity and mortality due to the direct effects of tobacco smoking
exceed the direct or indirect effects of other drugs of abuse or,
indeed, of any other single behavior on a population level
(2,127). In contrast to the FTQ/FTND, there are no explicit
quantitative measures assessed in the DSM substance depen-
dence criteria, which are derived from the alcohol-dependence
syndrome, a gradient of the severity of dependence comprising
additional behavioral elements rather than increased consump-
tion per se (128­130). Analysis of the factor structure of DSM-
III-R nicotine dependence identified two factors named "general
dependence" and "failed cessation," suggesting that DSM-III-R
nicotine dependence is composed of multiple psychopharmaco-
logic mechanisms that may differ in strength among smokers
(131).
Among 15- to 54-year-old civilian, noninstitutionalized
Americans (n  4414) surveyed for tobacco use in the National
Comorbidity Survey in 1991, lifetime DSM-III-R nicotine de-
pendence was found at a population prevalence of 26% in men
and 23% in women and at a higher prevalence among at least
one-time tobacco users, i.e., 33% among males and 31% among
females (132). With the use of data from the 1991­1992
National Household Survey on Drug Abuse (NHSDA) data
(n  61 426), of those who used cigarettes on a daily basis
(n  10 383), 91% experienced one or more symptoms of
nicotine dependence; when grouped by cigarettes smoked per
day, the frequency of those reporting symptoms of dependence
was dose related (133,134). Among middle-aged, male daily
smokers (n  1006) from the Minneapolis­St. Paul area sur-
veyed in 1982, 90% were found to qualify for DSM-III nicotine
dependence (135). Among ever users of tobacco, defined as
those who had used tobacco at least six times (n  645), in
a survey from the DSM-IV field trials using clinical populations
in 1992 (136), 87% qualified for provisional DSM-IV nicotine
dependence. DSM-III-R nicotine dependence occurs in 56%
of daily smokers in an 18-year-old New Zealand sample (n 
321) and in 51% of daily smokers in a young-adult Michigan
sample (n  381) (137,138); however, very large samples of
adolescent smokers have not been studied. While consumption
and dependence are statistically significantly associated for all
drugs of abuse, tobacco is similar to cocaine and the opiates in
terms of its addiction liability; i.e., most users are dependent, in
contrast to users of alcohol, amphetamines, and cannabis
(136,184). For example, among last year users of alcohol (n 
54998), nicotine (n  28 392), cannabis (n  11237), and
cocaine (n  3410) in a nationally representative U.S. popula-
tion sample (1991­1993 NHSDA), nicotine users were statisti-
cally significantly more likely to be nicotine dependent (28%)
than alcohol (5.2%), cannabis (8.2%), or cocaine (11.6%) users
(184). Also, only about 6%­12% of current smokers are inter-
mittent (never daily) smokers (139); thus, the vast majority of
cigarette smokers are daily smokers and, of these, the majority
are nicotine-dependent smokers by DSM-III-R or DSM-IV cri-
teria.
SMOKING, PSYCHIATRIC COMORBIDITY, AND
SUBSTANCE USE
Statistically significant associations have been found in dif-
ferent young adult and adult samples between smoking and de-
pression, anxiety, and alcohol dependence. A randomized trial of
clonidine in heavy smokers provided a provocative etiologic link
between depression and smoking that led to a number of cross-
sectional and prospective studies (140). With the use of data
from the 1980­1983 St. Louis (MO) NIMH-Epidemiologic
Catchment Area (NIMH-ECA) Survey, ever smoking was found
to be statistically significantly more prevalent in those with ma-
jor depression and with DSM-III alcohol dependence (adjusted
for major depression) than in those with no DSM-III diagnoses
(141). With the use of data from the 1975 National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey and the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies Depression (CES-D) scores, current smoking was found
to be significantly related to CES-D score (142). In a random-
digit-dialing telephone study of Latinos, current smokers were
found to have higher mean CES-D scores and were statistically
significantly more likely to have experienced depressive symp-
toms than never smokers (143). In a smoking-cessation study
sample, statistically significantly more smokers scored over the
CES-D cutoff for depression than in a general population
sample; depressed smokers scored statistically significantly
higher on the FTND than those below the CES-D cutoff (144).
With the use of data from the 1981­1983 Durham (NC), NIMH-
ECA Survey, current smoking was found to be statistically sig-
nificantly more prevalent in those with DSM-III generalizable
anxiety disorder and DSM-III alcohol dependence but not in
those with DSM-III depression. These findings could result from
a lack of power, since the prevalence of depression observed in
the Durham survey was half that seen in the St. Louis survey
(145). In a sample of 21- to 30-year-old members of a health
maintenance organization (n  1007), smoking was found to be
statistically significantly associated with other drug dependen-
cies, major depression, and anxiety disorders (146). Further-
more, when adjusted for the presence of depression and anxiety
disorders, moderate (five to six of the criteria met) but not mild
(three to four of the criteria met) nicotine dependence was as-
sociated with a statistically significant increase in risk for all
other drug dependencies compared with nondependent smoking
(138). Similarly, when adjusted for other drug dependencies,
both mild nicotine dependence and moderate nicotine depen-
dence significantly elevate risk for major depression, although
not for any anxiety disorder (138). In a 14-month follow-up
period in this young adult sample, the presence of major depres-
sion in current smokers resulted in an increased risk of becoming
nicotine dependent or to progress from mild to moderate nico-
tine dependency (147).
An unresolved problem in the established association be-
tween depression and smoking is the issue of causality, since the
potential for self-medication or precipitation of depression on
cessation is inherent in the modulating effects of nicotine on
neurotransmitter systems (24). For example, tobacco smoke, but
not nicotine administration, statistically significantly reduces
levels of monoamine oxidases A and B, which are essential
metabolic enzymes for many neurotransmitters (148,149), sug-
gesting that other components of tobacco smoke may have a
substantial effect on synaptic dopamine concentrations (150).

assess possible causal relationships between the statistically sig-
nificant and reciprocally associated diagnoses of nicotine depen-
dence and major depression in co-twins and in their families
(151). With the use of the co-twin control method that compares
observed and expected rate differences between monozygotic
and dizygotic twins, observed concordances rejected a causal
model for one DSM-III-R diagnosis causing the other; in con-
trast, either a noncausal family environment or a noncausal ge-
netic model fits the observed data. Modeling of genetic and
environmental factors indicated a statistically significant genetic
correlation between the liabilities to smoking and major depres-
sion, with specific environmental factors affecting the liabilities
independently and a common environmental factor influencing
the liability to smoking only (151). These data suggest that com-
mon genetic factors may contribute to both daily smoking and
major depression.
The relationship between tobacco and alcohol use and abuse
has been the subject of comprehensive reviews (126,152,153).
Smoking and alcoholism are statistically significantly associated
in population samples; e.g., 38% of ever smokers met the defi-
nition of DSM-III-R alcohol abuse and/or dependence versus
only 16% of never smokers in a young Michigan sample (154),
while 20% of ever smokers met the definition of DSM-III-R
alcohol abuse and/or dependence versus only 8% of never smok-
ers in a North Carolina NIMH-ECA sample (145). DSM-III-R-
defined nicotine dependence and alcohol dependence were sta-
tistically significantly associated with each other, with the
association at the same level as that with major depression and
anxiety, i.e., odds ratios of 2­4 (146,154­156). A statistically
significant association between the severity of DSM-III-R alco-
hol dependence (as defined by numbers of positive criteria) and
nicotine dependence (as defined by FTQ score) was observed in
a clinical (alcohol treatment) population where 88% of the al-
cohol-dependent individuals are current smokers and 92% of
these smokers are defined as nicotine dependent by FTQ score
(157).
Modeling of the statistically significant associations between
alcohol use disorders and nicotine dependence in a university-
based sample followed prospectively for 7 years, with individual
diagnostic data and family history interview data, supports both
reciprocal influence and common vulnerability models (158).
Modeling of joint alcohol and tobacco use in a twin sample
consisting of two age groups found that shared environmental
factors are most important in early use (ages 12­16 years) and
that genetic factors are more important in later use (ages 17­25
years) (99). More important, the shared correlation for the effect
of genetic factors, which explain approximately 50% of the al-
cohol use and 50% of the tobacco use in older adolescents and
young adults, is nearly unity, suggesting that substantially the
same genetic factors are operating in this sample to influence
both alcohol and tobacco use (99). With the use of the NAS-
NRC World War II Twin Registry to investigate the genetic
effects on multiple substance use, a twin model with a common
genetic pathway to tobacco, alcohol, and coffee use, with no
environmental effects and separate pathways with both genetic
and shared environmental effects for each substance, provided
the best fit to the data (159). Most of the genetic effect on
tobacco consumption was found in the common genetic path-
way, and most of the genetic effects on alcohol and coffee con-
sumption were found in substance-specific pathways. Regres-
sion analysis of heavy consumers of the three substances in the
NAS-NRC Twin Registry found two independent latent factors,
one underlying heavy smoking and heavy alcohol use and one
underlying heavy smoking and heavy coffee drinking (160).
Separate factors contributing to the comorbidity of alcohol and
nicotine dependence and to the comorbidity of nicotine depen-
dence and coffee drinking may reflect independent regulation of
the multiple pharmacologic effects of nicotine and the paired
substance (161).
DEMOGRAPHIC AND SOCIAL ENVIRONMENT FACTORS
AND CIGARETTE SMOKING
Prevalence surveys indicate that some demographic vari-
ables--sex, age, ethnicity, and socioeconomic status (SES)--are
consistently associated with cigarette smoking. Specifically,
male sex, younger age, lower SES, and lower educational at-
tainment are positively associated with current smoking preva-
lence, while Hispanic and Asian/Pacific Islander ethnicity is
negatively associated with current smoking prevalence
(11,13,15,77,162) . However, while the negative association be-
tween educational attainment and smoking prevalence is consis-
tently observed in diverse population samples in the United
States (163), some non-U.S. populations show a reverse asso-
ciation, e.g., among females in Italy (164).
In the United States, over the period from 1965 through 1994,
current smoking prevalence among adults less than 65 years of
age has decreased in every demographic category except those
with less than 12 years of education (9). In those adults greater
than or equal to 65 years of age, stable to increased rates of
current smoking are observed in those with less than 12 years of
education, in women, and in African-Americans (9). The quit
ratio, defined as (former smokers)/(ever smokers), has increased
in all groups; however, the rate of increase of the quit ratio has
been slower in adults 65 years old or older. Combined with the
postwar demographic bulge, the absolute number of older cur-
rent smokers continues to increase despite a long-term decrease
in smoking prevalence over the 30 years from 1965 through
1994.
The relationship between SES and smoking is complex, in-
volving a number of related factors. The statistically signifi-
cantly increased risk of smoking prevalence in those below the
poverty threshold (14) is concordant with a statistically signifi-
cantly increased risk for the opportunity of exposure to tobacco
products over the age period 6­13 years because of neighbor-
hood disadvantage, at least in Baltimore (MD) (165). In this
same city, reduced levels of parental monitoring [statistically
significantly associated with male sex of the child, reduced ed-
ucational achievement, and a history of psychiatric disorder in
mothers (166)] are statistically significantly associated with in-
creased risk of smoking initiation (167). Cigarette acceptability
and accessibility were the only school and neighborhood mea-
sures statistically significantly associated with cigarette smoking
rates in a study of Midwestern elementary schools (168). How-
ever, neighborhood disadvantage is not always associated with
increased rates of cigarette smoking; adjusted for attitude toward
substance use and availability (including cigarettes), neighbor-
hoods with lower population density, suggesting economic ad-
vantage, had higher rates of lifetime cigarette use in this Mid-
western sample (168).
Intensive marketing of tobacco products has likely played an
important role in establishing the prevalence of smoking ob-
served today. Targeted promotion may be responsible for a men-
1370 REVIEW Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 91, No. 16, August 18, 1999
thol cigarette brand being the most prevalent brand among Af-
rican-American smokers and for brand recognition among
adolescents (2,169­171). Publication of a cigar-oriented maga-
zine, endorsement of cigar use by celebrities, and marketing to
high SES consumers may have reversed a 20-year decline in
cigar consumption, the beginning of which coincided with ad-
vertising bans enacted in 1969 and 1973 (172).
There is evidence, however, that a number of social environ-
mental factors, especially at the regulatory level, have been
working to decrease the prevalence of smoking. Increasing so-
cietal disapproval of smoking since the 1964 Surgeon General's
Report (173) has resulted in workplace regulation of smoking,
among other antismoking sanctions (174). However, a national
survey of 1992­1993 indoor workplace smoking policies re-
ported by workers themselves observed statistically significantly
different levels of workplace smoking restrictions by sex, age,
smoking status, and occupation of the worker (175). These dif-
ferences found between these sociodemographic factors and
workplace smoking restrictions parallel differences in smoking
prevalence by sex, age, and educational attainment. Recent U.S.
Food and Drug Administration regulations and measures in-
cluded in the first states' attorneys' general tobacco settlement
were designed to modify the marketing behavior of the tobacco
companies to susceptible youth populations and to contribute to
smoking cessation programs (176,177). Analysis of media cam-
paigns designed to reduce smoking initiation and to increase
smoking cessation has demonstrated statistically significant as-
sociations between targeted media and reduced rates of smoking
in adolescent females (178). A combination of a large state tax
increase and tobacco control measures that included prevention,
cessation, and environmental tobacco smoke programs was as-
sociated with an increased average quarterly decline in cigarette
sales, during a period in which average levels of educational
attainment and income were decreasing (179).
SUMMARY
The estimated number of worldwide current smokers of both
sexes in 1996 exceeded one billion individuals (20). Research
into smoking behavior and pharmacology has established that
most smokers are smoking to maintain nicotine levels (30,45).
Recent neurobiologic research (24) has established the proxi-
mate molecular neurobiologic substrate of the mechanism that
maintains nicotine addiction. Nicotine dependence is signifi-
cantly associated with substance abuse, anxiety disorders, and
affective disorders (141,155,180). Twin-model analysis of the
genetic and environmental factors affecting smoking initiation,
current smoking, and persistence reveals that heritability is
stable and more important than environmental factors (96).
However, major secular changes in smoking prevalence support
strong effects of environmental determinants on smoking behav-
ior (175), as do consistent demographic predictors such as edu-
cational attainment in the United States (13).
Nicotine dependence, major depression, and alcohol depen-
dence are the three most prevalent specific psychiatric diagnoses
in population samples in the United States, while substance
abuse, anxiety disorders, and affective disorders are the three
most prevalent diagnostic categories (132,180). Nicotine depen-
dence is significantly associated with each of these three cat-
egories, an example of the striking concentration of psychiatric
comorbidity in approximately one sixth of the U.S. population
(180). The increased severity of nicotine dependence within the
U.S. smoking population (118) and among those with psychiat-
ric comorbidity (181) suggests that smoking cessation programs
may be negatively affected (182), as has been observed
(141,144). While it is the contamination of the nicotine delivery
device with carcinogens, carbon monoxide, and cytotoxic com-
pounds that is the probable source of the attributable risk from
smoking in cancer and cardiovascular and respiratory diseases,
an improved understanding of the neurobiologic mechanisms
that maintain nicotine dependence may provide the basis for
reducing morbidity and mortality, through improved smoking
cessation therapies. Methods to incorporate covariates known to
be significantly associated with smoking prevalence and behav-
ior, including age, sex, SES, psychiatric history, and previously
identified genetic loci, should be used in future candidate gene
studies. Research sample design and future analyses of the
smoking phenotype must address the consistent, statistically sig-
nificant risks due to demographic, psychiatric, and genetic fac-
tors to improve our understanding of the socioeconomic, psy-
chosocial, and neurobiologic bases of this behavior.

NOTES
1The O-glucuronide metabolite of NNAL (4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-
pyridyl)-1-butanol), a metabolite of one of the principal pulmonary carcinogens
in tobacco smoke, NNK, 4-(methylnitrosamino)-1-(3-pyridyl)-1-butone.
2The contemporary Centers for Disease Control and Prevention categories of
cigarette smokers are current smokers (defined as those who currently smoke
every day or on some days), former smokers (ever smokers who do not currently
smoke every day or on some days), and never smokers (who have smoked fewer
than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime) (11).
