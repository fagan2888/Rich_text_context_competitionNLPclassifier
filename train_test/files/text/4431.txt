Abstract. The blue and black dress that "melted the Internet" is thought to have done so because
its perceived color depended on people using different prior assumptions about discounting the
illuminant. However, this is not the first monochromatic object to have confused the public. For a brief
period during WWI, RMS Mauretania was dressed in (dazzle) camouflage shades of blue and black/
grey, yet she is sometimes depicted by artists, modelers, and historians in a much showier dress of
red, blue, yellow, green, and black. I raise the possibility that this originates from a case of public
deception deriving from the momentary misperception of a playful artist who neglected to discount the
illuminant, propagating the most (perhaps only) successful application of dazzle camouflage known.
Keywords: abstract expressionist art, blue and black dress, color constancy, cubism, dazzle camouflage, discounting
the illuminant, misperception of color, painting, razzle dazzle, sundown, sunset, World War I, WWI.
On 26th February 2015, a picture of a dark blue and black dress went viral on social media. The
reason? When forced between two alternatives, about half of the population saw it as blue and black,
the other half as white and gold (Figure 1). Broadly speaking, the generally accepted explanation is
as follows: the low-grade photograph was overexposed and its chromatic content became seriously
distorted, resulting in a spectrum that can be parsed in at least two different ways: (1) yellowish light
from the front that when discounted leaves a dress made from blue and black material; (2) a garment
in dim shadowy blue light that when discounted leaves a dress made from white and gold material. A
third commonly reported visual interpretation is of a pale blue and brown dress where, presumably, the
illuminant is not discounted at all (or is assumed to be made of flat white light), and the pixel wave-
lengths are seen to be (close to) how they look in isolation.
The details of all this, including the properties of the fabric and why different people have dif-
ferent priors for the image/illuminant, are being investigated in several vision laboratories across the
world, and Journal of Vision is planning a special issue on the subject.
The purpose of this note is to bring to the attention of the scientific vision community a much older
(~100 years) misperception of a rather different carrier of a blue and black (or gray) dress, possibly
involving processes of the third kind described above. During the First World War, merchant ships
and their escorts were painted in so-called dazzle camouflage consisting of crazy patterns of stripes
and geometric shapes. Many schemes used black and white, but blues and pastel colors came to be
used in some. It seems that the aim of this striking display was to dazzle the U-boat captains, confus-
ing their assessment of the speed and heading of their targets (e.g., Scott-Samuel, Baddeley, Palmer,
& Cuthill, 2011; Hall, Cuthill, Baddeley, Shohet, & Scott-Samuel, 2013). Given the large number of
vessels involved (over 4,000 merchant ships and 400 military ships from Britain alone, according to
Murphy & Bellamy, 2009), the application of dazzle must have impressed the authorities, but whether
this strategy was truly effective in practice was never shown; it might well have been done more for
morale than for saving allied shipping.
During WW1, the four-funnel liner RMS Mauretania was commandeered as a troop ship, and
by 1918 she was dressed in dazzle camouflage. Photographs from this period are in black and white,
and this has posed difficulties in assessing the true colors in which dazzle ships were painted, in
general. The c1919 painting by Burnett Poole (Figure 2) shows Mauretania in a scheme of blues and
grays. Whether these are the true shades that she carried, or whether the darker blue (such as that to
the aft) was closer to black, as shown in Admiralty diagrams (held by the Imperial War Museum),
is not clear. However, the camouflage shades of gray in every one of the photographs of the ship I
have found on the Internet are consistent with each of these two (rather similar) interpretations. More

importantly, I have found no evidence (photographic, eyewitness reports, or reference to Admiralty
records) that Mauritania ever carried different coloration in any of the pale diamonds on the fore of
the hull. Builders of scale models have a tenacious interest in the subject of livery/camouflage, and
Internet posts from them come to similar conclusions. Nonetheless, an alternative scheme is readily
found in reference books (Williams, 1989, 2001), paintings, (including one by Crossley) and Internet

Figure 3. Seeing red. (a) Part of a post-war publicity poster for the Cunard Line. Almost certainly, this image
is wrong in depicting RMS Mauritania in red, green, and yellow. This author does not know if the poster's true
colors have been accidently/subtly distorted during reproduction, but even so, that could not explain the large
splashes of red. Furthermore, the patchwork of gray in the original black and white photograph upon which this
image was presumably based (not shown) is inconsistent with a grayscale conversion of this image (not shown).
The speculation that the artificial colors were inspired by reflections at sunset is supported by the somewhat
iridescent quality of some of the red regions in the image, particularly around the lifeboats. (This image is
assumed to be public domain.) (b) Photograph of the wing of an Airbus taken at sundown. A dazzling spectacle,
since commercial airlines do not usually paint the underwings of their aircraft red or pink! (In fact, knowledge
of this might impede perception of a colored underwing (e.g., Hurlbert & Ling, 2005; Granzier & Gegenfurtner,
2012). (This image is public domain.)
commentaries; it has exactly the same pattern as the established one, but includes large slabs of bright
red on the hull and superstructure, and pastel shades of yellow and green on two of the funnels. So
what is going on?
The origin of this (assumed) error is almost certainly a post-war publicity poster by the ship's
owners, The Cunard Line, which depicts their liner (Figure 3a) in the exact alternative colors described
above; it seems that these have been taken on face value by those who have seen the poster, and
the myth has been propagated. But the question arises, why gild the lily? The answer might be that
the more colorful scheme was simply thought to be more appealing to potential passengers; but
why choose those colors? After all, there is little evidence that bright red was used in British dazzle
schemes; available records suggesting that more sombre maritime colors were by far the norm. (The
Imperial War Museum website hosts images of (at least) 2,185 scale models, photographs, paintings,
and drawings of dazzle ships, many carrying the curiously named Wilkinson schemes (e.g., 9A, 9EX,
11EX, 14G, 19, and 24-11); in the rare cases where shades of red can be found, they tend toward
bauxite or red oxide, not scarlet). We can't know for sure, but it is not so fanciful to suppose that the
artist of the publicity poster had seen Mauritania (or other dazzle ships) in port at sunset; reflections of
red, and arguably yellow and green, being directed to the artist by some of the paler (more reflective)
facets of the ship (a contemporary example is shown in Figure 3b). With a cognoscente, or even naïve,
prior that anything is possible with these dazzle ships, these splashes of narrowband illuminant might
well have been perceived as paint, at least for a few moments, and--enjoying the spectacle--the artist
chose to share that with the public, in a stylized fashion.
Whatever the underlying reason for this misperception of the blue and black ship, it has proved
provocative (e.g., the contemporary artwork in Figure 41), and it is delightfully ironic that what is
probably dazzle's greatest success in deception has nothing to do with the purpose for which it was
intended; perhaps also, that a similarly misperceived blue and black dress should be the trigger for
Mauritania's public disrobing.
1It is often thought that the cubist art of the period was the inspiration for the dazzle schemes of WW1. However,
the original proposals by Kerr were derived from observations of animal camouflage with the help of Thayer
(Murphy & Bellamy, 2009), and it has been claimed that Wilkinson's schemes were derived quite independently
of the fashionable art movement of the time, though experiments with cubist ideas were carried out by the French
sections de camouflage (Murphy & Bellamy, 2009).
