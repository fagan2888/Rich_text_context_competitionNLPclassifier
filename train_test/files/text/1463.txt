Data from the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey were used to describe the distri-
bution of cardiorespiratory fitness and its association with obesity and leisure-time physical activity (LTPA) for
adults 20­49 years of age without physical limitations or indications of cardiovascular disease. A sample of 7,437
adults aged 20­49 years were examined at a mobile examination center. Of 4,860 eligible for a submaximal
treadmill test, 3,250 completed the test and were included in the analysis. The mean maximal oxygen uptake
( _
VO2
max) was estimated as 44.5, 42.8, and 42.2 mL/kg/minute for men 20­29, 30­39, and 40­49 years of age,
respectively. For women, it was 36.5, 35.4, and 34.4 mL/kg/minute for the corresponding age groups. Non-
Hispanic black women had lower fitness levels than did non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American women.
Regardless of gender or race/ethnicity, people who were obese had a significantly lower estimated maximal
oxygen uptake than did nonobese adults. Furthermore, a positive association between fitness level and LTPA
participation was observed for both men and women. These results can be used to track future population
assessments and to evaluate interventions. The differences in fitness status among population subgroups and
by obesity status or LTPA can also be used to develop health policies and targeted educational campaigns.

As stated in the Surgeon General's report on physical
activity and health in 1996, higher cardiorespiratory fitness
decreases overall mortality rates and morbidity and mor-
tality due to various chronic diseases in a dose-response
fashion (1). These associations have been demonstrated to
be largely independent from other major risk factors (2­7).
Despite the accumulating evidence supporting the impor-
tant health benefits of cardiorespiratory fitness, data on the
population distribution of fitness levels are very limited for
US adults. Since the early 1970s, data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)
have been used to monitor the health status of the nation.
In 1999, a cardiorespiratory fitness component was added
to the NHANES to provide an objective assessment of
fitness level by using a submaximal treadmill test. The
distribution of cardiorespiratory fitness, as indicated by
estimated maximal oxygen uptake ( _
VO2
max), for adults
aged 20­49 years from the 1999­2002 NHANES has been
previously reported by Duncan et al. (8). The present report
updates those estimates with additional NHANES data
from 2003 to 2004. Six years of data yield more stable
and precise estimates of the _
VO2
max because data were
collected from a greater number of locations and because
sample sizes were larger. In addition to the mean _
VO2
max
for the population overall, the current report further pro-
vides detailed percentile estimates by age, gender, and
selected race/ethnicity subgroups, as well as its association
with body mass index and leisure-time physical activity

guidelines (9).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Survey design and study population
The NHANES are conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease Control and Pre-
vention to monitor the health and nutritional status of the
United States. The design for the 1999­2004 NHANES is
a stratified multistage probability sample of the civilian non-
institutionalized population of the United States. Mexican
Americans, blacks, adolescents 12­19 years of age, persons
60 years or older, low income whites, and pregnant women
were oversampled to allow for more precise estimates for
these groups. The survey consisted of a household interview
followed by a physical examination at a mobile examination
center. A cardiorespiratory fitness test component was in-
cluded as part of the physical examination for participants
aged 12­49 years (10).
From 1999 through 2004, 7,437 individuals aged 20­49
years were examined at the mobile examination center.
Among them, 2,577 were not eligible for the fitness test
because of one or more of the following reasons: pregnancy
of more than 12 weeks (n ¼ 595); physical limitations that
would prevent them from using the treadmill (n ¼ 792);
history of cardiovascular diseases or cardiovascular condi-
tions or symptoms (n ¼ 723); asthma symptoms (n ¼ 250);
other lung or breathing conditions or symptoms (n ¼ 515);
use of b-blockers, antiarrhythmics, calcium channel
blockers, nitrates, or digitalis (n ¼ 231); or other reasons
(n ¼ 192). Selected characteristics of eligible and noneli-
gible participants are shown in Table 1. Results in this report
apply to the US population with a set of characteristics as
defined by the eligibility criteria. That is, the population of
inference is the US civilian noninstitutional population who
are aged 20­49 years and who have neither physical limita-
tions nor history of cardiovascular diseases and related
symptoms.
Among individuals who were eligible to participate in the
fitness test, 1,610 did not have their fitness level estimated.
For 816 eligible participants, the following reasons ac-
counted for the missing fitness data: insufficient time to
conduct the test (n ¼ 540), participant refusal (n ¼ 106),
equipment problems (n ¼ 67), and otherwise unclassifiable
reasons (n ¼ 103). For 720 eligible participants, _
VO2
max
was not estimated because the test was terminated prema-
turely. The most common reason for premature termination
was a heart rate exceeding the predetermined limit (n ¼
417). Other safety concerns arising during the test, such as
inability of the participant to walk on the treadmill without

gripping the handrails (n ¼ 55), an abnormal blood pressure
or heart rate response (n ¼ 48), and the occurrence of excess
fatigue, discomfort, or distress such as leg pain, cramping,
or dizziness, also resulted in an early termination of the
fitness test (n ¼ 89). Finally, data from 74 eligible and tested
participants were excluded from analysis because the
change in heart rate between the two 3-minute exercise
stages was less than 8 beats per minute, indicating an
insufficient heart rate response to classify fitness level.
Therefore, 3,250 individuals with an estimated _
VO2
max
are included in the analyses.
The 1999­2004 NHANES protocol was approved by the
National Center for Health Statistics institutional review
board, and written informed consent was obtained from all
participants.
Cardiorespiratory fitness test
Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by a submaximal
treadmill exercise test. Participants were assigned to 1 of 8
treadmill test protocols on the basis of their expected
_
VO2
max, which was predicted from gender, age, body mass
index, and self-reported level of physical activity by using
the formula developed by Jackson et al. (11). Each protocol
included a 2-minute warm-up, two 3-minute exercise stages,
and a 2-minute cool-down period (10). The goal of each
protocol was to elicit a heart rate that was approximately
80% of the age-predicted maximum (220 À age) by the end
of the second exercise stage.
The heart rate was monitored continuously via 4 elec-
trodes connected to the trunk and abdomen of the partici-
pant, and it was recorded at the end of warm-up, each
exercise stage, and each minute of recovery. Blood pressure
was measured at the end of each stage by an STBP-780
automated sphygmomanometer (Colin Medical Instruments
Corporation, San Antonio, Texas). At the end of warm-up
and each exercise stage, participants were asked to rate their
perceived exertion using a 6- to 20-point Borg scale (12).
_
VO2
max (mL/kg/minute) was estimated by extrapolation to
an expected age-specific maximal heart rate by using mea-
sured heart rate responses to the two 3-minute exercise stages
(13). It was assumed that the relation between heart rate
and oxygen consumption is linear during treadmill exercise
(14). An estimated _
VO2
max greater than 75 mL/kg/minute
was coded as 75 mL/kg/minute in the analysis (n ¼ 11).
Covariates
Self-reported information on race and ethnicity was cat-
egorized as non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Mexican American. Persons not classified into one of these
groups were included in total population estimates but are
not presented separately. Participants were asked to recall
the type, frequency, duration, and intensity of leisure-time
physical activities (LTPAs) that they engaged in for at least
10 minutes during the 30 days preceding their interview.
Reported frequencies and durations above the 99th percen-
tile (60 times per 30 days and 300 minutes each time, re-
spectively) were coded to 60 and 300, respectively, for the
analysis. A metabolic equivalent (MET; 1 MET ¼ 3.5 mL of
oxygen uptake per kg per minute) score was assigned to
each activity to represent a standardized energy cost for
the reported activity based on self-reported intensity (15).
The MET score of each activity was multiplied by the re-
ported frequency and duration and then summed and di-
vided by 30 before being multiplied by 7 to obtain the
total MET-minutes per week. For the analysis, participants
were grouped into 4 LTPA categories: no LTPA reported,
low (0­<500 MET-minutes/week), moderate (500­<1,000
MET-minutes/week), or high (!1,000 MET-minutes/week).
The cutpoints were chosen on the basis of the 2008 Physical
Activity Guidelines for Americans recommendations (9).
Measured weight and height were used to calculate body
mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2). On the basis of their
body mass index, participants were classified as normal
weight (18.5­<25 kg/m2), overweight (25­<30 kg/m2), or
obese (!30 kg/m2) (16). Because of limited sample size
(n ¼ 75), underweight participants (body mass index
<18.5 kg/m2) were excluded from analyses using body
mass index categories.
Statistical analysis
Distribution of estimated _
VO2
max was examined by gen-
der, age, and race/ethnicity group, as well as by body mass
index and LTPA category. The trends of _
VO2
max by decades
of age were tested separately for the total sample and by
race/ethnicity groups by using logistic regression with age
decades (20­29, 30­39, and 40­49 years) included as an
ordinal variable. The trends of _
VO2
max by LTPA levels were
tested for men and women separately by using logistic re-
gression. Sample weights were used to account for differen-
tial probabilities of selection, noncoverage, and
nonresponse to the examination (17). Standard errors were
calculated by the Taylor series linearization method. Statis-
tical hypotheses were tested univariately at the 0.05 level by
using a t statistic. To adjust for multiple comparisons when 3
race/ethnicity groups, 3 body mass index categories, or 4
LTPA groups were compared, we used the Bonferroni
method. All statistical analyses were conducted with SAS
for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) and
SUDAAN (SUDAAN Statistical Software Center, Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina) software.
Nonresponse assessment
In the 1999­2004 NHANES, 4,860 participants aged
20­49 years were eligible for the cardiorespiratory fitness
component. For the various reasons discussed above, 1,610
(33%) did not have their _
VO2
max estimated. Assessment
was performed to examine potential nonresponse bias.
Table 1 describes the characteristics of the eligible partic-
ipants that did and did not have their _
VO2
max estimated
along with a description of examined NHANES partici-
pants aged 20­49 years who were not eligible for the
cardiorespiratory fitness component. Compared with those
who were eligible and had _
VO2
max estimated, eligible
individuals missing _
VO2
max had a larger proportion of
non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican Americans and a smaller
proportion of non-Hispanic whites, and they tended to have

lower educational and income levels, to have more current
smokers, and to be less physically active on average. These
2 groups had similar gender and age distributions, and they
had comparable mean levels of body mass index, blood
pressure measurements, and total cholesterol. To further
examine the potential impact of nonresponse, we adjusted
the examination weights for gender, age, race/ethnicity,
and any versus no reported LTPA, using the standard
weighting-class method (18). For this method, variables
related to nonresponse and variables related to the differ-
ential characteristics of responders and nonresponders
were used to form weighting classes. It was then assumed
that the data were missing at random within each adjust-
ment cell. Nonresponse correction factors were calculated
for each adjustment cell, and the adjustments were applied
to the original sampling weights. In the analysis, the esti-
mates of _
VO2
max using these adjusted weights led to dif-
ferences no more than 0.6 mL/kg/minute or 1.1% (data not
presented). This indicates that use of the original survey
weights would result in very little bias. Use of the original
sampling weights is preferred in order for others to be able
to replicate results without having to repeat the process to
obtain a revised set of sampling weights. Therefore, we
present all the estimates in this report using the original
sampling weights.
RESULTS
The age-specific estimates of the mean and median
_
VO2
max, as well as the 20th and 80th percentiles for men
20­49 years of age, are presented in Table 2. The average
_
VO2
max was 43.4, 42.7, and 43.6 mL/kg/minute for non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American
men, respectively. There was a significant decrease in esti-
mated _
VO2
max by age across all race/ethnicity groups. The
difference in estimated _
VO2
max among race/ethnicity groups
was seen only in the age group of 30­39 years and only
between non-Hispanic whites and non-Hispanic blacks. No
significant race/ethnicity differences were observed in other
age groups.

As expected, women (Table 3) had a lower estimated
_
VO2
max compared with men. The mean _
VO2
max for women
was 35.9, 32.9, and 36.0 mL/kg/minute for non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, and Mexican Americans, re-
spectively. Similar to the trend seen in men, a decline was
also observed in the estimated _
VO2
max with age for women
overall and for all 3 race/ethnicity groups. Non-Hispanic
black women had an overall lower mean _
VO2
max than did
their non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American counter-
parts. The differences by race/ethnicity were not always
statistically significant, but the patterns were consistent
across all subgroups.
Distributions of estimated _
VO2
max are further illustrated
in Figure 1 by race/ethnicity group. For men, no
significant differences were observed among the 3 race/
ethnicity groups. The estimated _
VO2
max distribution for
non-Hispanic black women was consistently lower than
that of the non-Hispanic white and Mexican-American
women.
Figure 2 shows the comparison of the estimated _
VO2
max
between body mass index categories by race/ethnicity.
Across all race/ethnicity groups, the estimated _
VO2
max
was significantly lower among individuals classified as
obese compared with their normal weight counterparts.
With the exception of Mexican-American women, persons
who were overweight also had lower fitness levels than did
persons with normal weight.
The estimates of mean _
VO2
max shown in Figure 2 for the
3 race/ethnicity groups are tabulated in Table 4 by body
mass index category. For both men and women, there was
no significant difference observed between race/ethnicity
groups among people who were normal weight. Among
women who were classified as overweight or obese, the
point estimate of mean _
VO2
max was significantly lower
for non-Hispanic blacks than that for non-Hispanic whites
or Mexican Americans. This pattern was also seen in the
same direction for men, although it was not statistically
significant. Because the observed pattern of race/ethnicity

people who reported a high level of LTPA (!1,000 MET-
minutes/week) had higher _
VO2
max compared with those
who reported no or less than 500 MET-minutes/week
of LTPA. For men who reported moderate LTPA
(500­<1,000 MET-minutes/week), their fitness levels,
while similar to those of men with less LTPA, were signifi-
cantly lower than those of men with high LTPA. For women,
the difference in estimated _
VO2
max between high and mod-
erate LTPA groups, however, was not statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
During the past 2 decades, increasing physical activity to
improve cardiorespiratory fitness has been a major focus of
health promotion and disease prevention activities in the
United States. The results from the 1999­2004 NHANES
describe the distribution of cardiorespiratory fitness levels
for men and women aged 20­49 years without physical lim-
itations or indications of cardiovascular disease in a national
sample of the US population including 3 race/ethnicity pop-
ulation subgroups: non-Hispanic blacks, non-Hispanic
whites, and Mexican Americans. On the basis of data from
NHANES 1999­2004, the estimated mean _
VO2
max was 43.2
mL/kg/minute for men and 35.5 mL/kg/minute for women
aged 20­49 years. Non-Hispanic black women had lower
fitness levels than did non-Hispanic white and Mexican-
American women, whereas no significant difference was
observed between race/ethnicity groups among men. The
observed race/ethnicity differences were more evident
among people who were overweight or obese compared with
that among those with normal weight. Overall, regardless of
gender or race/ethnicity, individuals who were obese had
significantly lower cardiorespiratory fitness levels than did
nonobese individuals. Additionally, our results also demon-
strated a positive association between level of cardiorespi-
ratory fitness and participation in leisure-time physical
activity.
Our findings on the lower cardiorespiratory fitness level
among non-Hispanic blacks, particularly women, compared
with non-Hispanic whites and Mexican Americans, are con-
sistent with previously reported data. The Coronary Artery
Risk Development in Young Adults (CARDIA) Study
examined 4,968 black adults and white adults aged 18­30
years in 1985­1986 by using symptom-limited graded tread-
mill exercise testing and reported that white women had
higher exercise performance in both maximal and submax-
imal cardiorespiratory fitness measures than did black
women (19). The performance was similar in white men
and black men at the submaximal level but was better in
whites for the symptom-limited maximal fitness measure.
Farrell et al. (20) studied the fitness differences in 1,967
female school district employees among 3 race/ethnicity
groups using a submaximal treadmill test. A significantly
lower level of cardiorespiratory fitness was observed
in black women compared with whites and Mexican
Americans after adjustment for confounders.

Results from our analysis demonstrated a consistent pat-
tern across various gender and race/ethnicity population
subgroups regarding the relation between cardiorespiratory
fitness level and obesity status. Compared with people who
were of normal weight, those who were obese had a 10%,
14%, and 11% lower estimated _
VO2
max for non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, and Mexican-American men,
respectively. The corresponding differences in women were
7%, 12%, and 9%. Cardiorespiratory fitness has been in-
versely associated with mortality in normal weight, over-
weight, and obese individuals (7, 21­24). Results from
prospective studies showed that improvements in cardio-
respiratory fitness were associated with attenuated age-
related weight gain (25, 26). Data from a 15-year follow-
up of the Coronary Artery Risk Development in Young
Adults Study cohort suggested that a low cardiorespiratory
fitness level in young adults is associated with the develop-
ment of cardiovascular disease risk factors, such as hyper-
tension, diabetes, and metabolic syndrome in middle age,
and is modified by obesity status (25).
When interpreting the results in this report, one must take
into account the fact that the reference population does not
include the subpopulation represented by individuals who
were not eligible for the NHANES fitness test. To ensure the
safety and validity of the test, a series of exclusion criteria
were used to determine the eligibility. A total of 2,577 par-
ticipants at higher risk of complications from exercise or
with conditions that might affect the estimation of _
VO2
max
did not take part in the fitness test. As a result, the population
tested is younger and characterized by participants who did
not have a history of or symptoms of cardiovascular dis-
eases, severe asthma, or self-reported physical conditions
that would prevent them from walking on the treadmill or
who were not more than 12 weeks pregnant. The exclusion
rate for the NHANES fitness test increased with age. There-
fore, if the medical exclusions would lead to a healthier
and more fit sample, it may be more observable among those
aged 40­49 years than among the younger groups. For
example, compared with the 50th percentile estimates from
the Cooper Clinic Longitudinal Study with predominately
white, middle and upper socioeconomic strata participants,
our median estimates of _
VO2
max for women 20­39 years of
age are 7%­8% lower (13). The differences decreased to
about 4% for those aged 40­49 years. The observed diver-
gence across age groups may be explained, at least in part,
by the more heterogeneous sample in our data and by the
differential exclusion rates by age.
A wide variety of submaximal exercise testing protocols
have been developed and used in observational and inter-
vention studies to examine the association of cardiorespira-
tory fitness and health status (1, 2). Compared with direct
measurement of maximal oxygen uptake or maximal exer-
cise testing, submaximal tests impose less of a burden on the
participants in terms of time and effort. The validity of the
NHANES treadmill protocol has been tested on a small
sample of men and women aged 21­47 years (n ¼ 19).
The Pearson correlation between the estimated _
VO2
max
from the NHANES treadmill protocol and the measured
_
VO2
max using analysis of expired air through indirect
calorimetry (13) was 0.79 (data not presented).
In addition to _
VO2
max being an excellent indicator of the
oxygen transport and utilization capacity of the cardiorespi-
ratory system and skeletal muscles, it is also a strong in-
dependent predictor of future cardiovascular diseases, type 2
diabetes, and all-cause mortality (2­7, 27­29). For example,
a 1-MET increase in _
VO2
max (3.5 mL/kg/minute) has been
associated with a 12% and 17% greater survival for men
(30) and women (31), respectively. From this perspective,
our results on an average of 2.5­3.1 mL/kg/minute differ-
ence in _
VO2
max between high LTPA and no or low LTPA
groups suggest a noteworthy health benefit at a population
level. The relative risk of all-cause mortality associated with
a low level of cardiorespiratory fitness has been ranked
comparable with that observed for cigarette smoking (5).
Studies have demonstrated that improvement in the cardio-
respiratory fitness level is associated with reduction in
mortality rates (32) and can be achieved by participating
in regular physical activity (33, 34).
In January 2005, revised Dietary Guidelines for Americans
were released with an emphasis on the importance of regular
physical activity (35). In October 2008, the federal govern-
ment issued its first-ever Physical Activity Guidelines for
Americans to provide science-based guidance on the types
and amounts of physical activity for Americans aged 6 years
or older (9). The target set by the Physical Activity Guide-
lines Advisory Committee for adults to achieve substantial
health benefits from aerobic activity is 500­1,000 MET-
minutes/week, which is the moderate range for LTPA pre-
sented in Table 5. Although the estimated _
VO2
max of men
and women with LTPA meeting the target is not significantly
higher than sedentary individuals, we did observe a signifi-
cant trend for higher fitness across LTPA categories. Self-
reported LTPA leads to substantial misclassification, and the
questionnaire may not be sensitive enough in identifying
individuals meeting current Guidelines. This underscores
the importance of having objective data on fitness in sur-
veillance systems and in making public health and clinical
decisions.
To the authors' knowledge, these data are the only nation-
ally representative estimates of mean and percentiles of fit-
ness level and will provide an important source for
comparison in future studies from the United States and
other countries. This report provides a key reference that
can be used to track future population assessments and to
evaluate the impact of programs. Differences reported here
in cardiorespiratory fitness among population subgroups and
by obesity status and participation in leisure-time physical
activity can be used to develop health policies, programs,
and services targeted to the least active and fit in the US
population.
