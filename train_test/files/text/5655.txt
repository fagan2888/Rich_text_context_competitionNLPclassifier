Abstract
Objective: This study aimed to investigate the damage pattern of the stress transfer path (STP) for
the Japanese Investigation Committee (JIC) classification of pre-collapse osteonecrosis of the femoral
head. We aimed to provide a specific biomechanical basis for treatment decisions of each subtype.
Methods: Five computational models were used in the experiment. Different necrotic
classifications were simulated based on the JIC classification system. Damage patterns of the
STP were used for qualitative assessment and average stresses were used for quantitative analysis.
Results: The STP of type A showed a strong similarity to the healthy level, which was consistent
with the bone density distribution in X-rays and previous simulations results. The damaged area of
principal stress of type B was approximately 25% of the healthy level. The STPs of types C1 and C2
were broken and the damaged areas of principal stress were more than 50% of the healthy level.
The efficiency of stress transfer was reduced.
Conclusions: These results indicate that the damage patterns and stress transfer efficiency of the
femoral head are associated with necrotic classifications.

Management of ONFH is still a challenging
task. Clinical doctors and researchers share
a common goal of choosing a safe and
effective treatment procedure for protecting
the femoral head of patients with ONFH.
Several hip-preserving procedures have
been developed to maintain or reconstruct
the mechanical environment and interrupt
the disease path of articular collapse. These
procedures include core decompression,
transtrochanteric rotational osteotomy,
free and non-vascularized fibular grafting,
and fibular allografts. Total hip arthroplasty
(THA) is considered as the standard
and effective treatment option for patients
with femoral head collapse in terms of
pain relief and functional improvement.
However, many authors have reported
high rates of failure of THA in patients
with ONFH, especially in intermediate-
to long-term results. For young patients
with THA, several surgical treatments
are required. Therefore, the head-preserving
procedure is the first choice for young
patients.
The hip joint is the largest weight-bearing
joint of humans,1 whose pathological progres-
sion is closely related to the biomechanics.2
Several staging and classification criteria,3­6
including the Japanese Investigation
Committee (JIC) classification, Association
Research Circulation Osseous system, and
the Ficat system, were developed and used
to guide treatment of ONFH. However,
none of these disease evaluation criteria
take into account biomechanical basis
limits. Therefore, the situation where selec-
tion of treatment is solely based on isolated
observation of images is in urgent need of
improvement.
This study used computational biomech-
anical technology to investigate the damage
patterns of different classifications of ONFH
based on the JIC classification. Our results
provide a specific biomechanical basis for
treatment decisions of each subtype.
Methods
JIC classification
In 2001, Sugano et al.7 revised diagnostic
criteria to clarify the definition of ONFH.
According to the JIC classification criteria,
ONFH is classified into subtypes A, B, C1,
and C2, which are based on the location
of the lesion in the weight-bearing area
(Figure 1 and Table 1).
Computational models
Five computational models were con-
structed according to the JIC classification.
Clinical data were used to stimulate
a healthy femoral head and create four
classifications of a necrotic femoral head in
a mid-stance gait cycle. Seven muscles were
considered as axial connectors and muscle

forces as previously reported.8 The endpoint
of muscles and cortical bone was connected.
The assumed plane load was considered as a
ground reaction force that was equivalent to
body weight, with application to a rigid
plate that was attached to the distal part of
the femur. All models are described as
nonlinear isotropic elastic models and were
input to ABAQUS V6.13 (Simulia Co.,
Shanghai, China) to generate isotropic
10-node tetrahedral elements. A single-
legged stance was considered as a represen-
tative body position for the primary models.
Constraints were applied to the pubic sym-
physis and sacroiliac joint. All six degrees of
freedom were constrained to zero.
Results
Damage patterns of the stress
transfer path
In this study, the damage pattern of the
stress transfer path (STP) was an important
indicator for evaluating the deterioration
process of ONFH. The contours of the STP
were plotted from a coronal section view of
the femur during the gait cycle. As shown in
Figure 1a, the STP of the physiological
femoral head was distributed along the
direction of the principal compressive tra-
beculae from the weight-bearing area to the
femoral calcar. The STP loads principal
compressive stress. The STP of type A
showed a strong similarity to the healthy
level (Figure 1b, c). The damaged area of
principal stress of type B was approximately
25% of the healthy level. The STPs of types
C1 and C2 were broken and the damaged
area of principal stress was more than 50%
of the healthy level (Figure 1d, e). The
efficiency of stress transfer was reduced.
Stress distribution of the anterolateral
column
Previous research has shown that the risk of
collapse of the femoral head is highly
correlated with the anterolateral column of
the femoral head.9­11 Therefore, we calcu-
lated the average stress of the anterolateral
column from all anterolateral elements.
Figures 2 and 3 show the relationship
between average stresses of the anterolateral
column and the deterioration process of
ONFH. The average stress increased with
an increase in necrotic region. In type A, the
average stress was similar to that measured
at the healthy level. In type B, the average
stress was approximately 4.5% higher than
that at the healthy level. The average stress
was 17.4% higher in type C1 and 37.5%
higher in type C2 than the healthy level.
These findings indicated that the risk of
collapse of the femoral head in type C was
increased.
Validation of the models
For validation purposes, the model was
subjected to a reaction force that was equiva-
lent to body weight. The principal STP of this
model showed strong similarity to previous
results in the literature8 and to the bone
density distribution in a cross-section of a

biomechanical behaviour of this model was
considered valid.
Discussion
The Japanese Investigation Committee
revised the classification criteria for diagno-
sis and management of ONFH in 2001.
ONFH is classified into four types, based on
the location of the necrotic region by radio-
logical evidence. The hip joint is the largest
weight-bearing structure, in which patho-
logical progression is closely related to the
biomechanics. However, treatment options
based on isolated observation by images
without biomechanical basis are required.
We postulate that bone necrotic deterior-
ation would destroy the STP and increas-
ingly reduce the stress transfer efficiency of
principal compressive trabeculae. Because
the four types of ONFH have different
biomechanical characteristics, target treat-
ments of types may achieve better clinical
efficacy. To test this hypothesis, we created
five necrotic damage models to examine the
damage patterns of the STP and the risk of
collapse of the anterolateral column.
The current study aimed to investigate the
damage pattern of the STP for JIC classifi-
cation of pre-collapse ONFH to provide
specific biomechanical basis for treatment
decisions of each subtype. Many biomechan-
ical studies have reported ONFH.13­18
Results from biomechanical models consider-
ing damage patterns of STP in different
classifications have not been previously pub-
lished. Using five computational models, we
found qualitative damage patterns of the STP
and a quantitative risk of collapse of the
anterolateral column. There was a rise in
damage to the STP with increasing necrotic
trabecular region (Figure 2). These results
indicate that when the femoral head with
necrotic lesions is more than two-thirds of the
weight-bearing portion, the principal STP
will break off and the stress transfer efficiency
may be reduced by half. The risk of collapse
of the anterolateral column increased by
nearly four times higher when necrotic
lesions did not extend to the acetabular
edge laterally. The risk of collapse of the

anterolateral column increased to more than
eight times higher when necrotic lesions
extended to the acetabular edge laterally
(Figure 3). These findings indicate that the
femoral head lost bearing capability. This
may have been caused by the necrotic region
losing the ability to load stress, while cortical
bone must be overloaded with work to retain
morphology and function of the femoral
head. When necrotic lesions of the femoral
head were between one-third and two-thirds
of the weight-bearing portion, the damaged
area of the STP was less than 25%. The risk
of collapse of the anterolateral column was
only increased by 4.5%. These findings indi-
cate that the femoral head still has the
function of bearing weight. When necrotic
lesions of the femoral head were less than
one-third of the weight-bearing portion, the
STP was still in good condition. There was no
risk of collapse in the anterolateral column.
Conclusions
This study supports use of computational
biomechanical technology for investigating
the damage patterns of different classifica-
tions of ONFH based on the JIC classifica-
tion. Our study shows that damage patterns
of the STP are closely related to classifica-
tion of the necrotic femoral head. The
efficiency of the STP is reduced with an
increase in necrotic region. In the early stage
of ONFH, such as type A/B, biomechanical
behaviour shows little change compared
with the healthy femur, which indicates that
conservative treatment may be used.
However, the STP is broken and the risk of
collapse of the anterolateral column increases
in the later stage of ONFH, such as type C1/
C2. This finding indicates that surgical treat-
ment may be used in this situation.
