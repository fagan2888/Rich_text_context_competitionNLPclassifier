A novel cutoff for the waist-to-height ratio
predicting metabolic syndrome in young
American adults
Adam D. Bohr1*, Kelly Laurson2 and Matthew B. McQueen3
Abstract
Background: Recent studies have shown the enhanced diagnostic capability of the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR)
over BMI. However, while a structured cutoff hierarchy has been established for BMI, a rigorous analysis to define
individuals as obese using the WHtR has not been performed on a sample of American adults. This study attempts
to establish a cutoff for the WHtR using metabolic syndrome as the outcome.
Methods: The study sample consisted of individuals that were part of the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health (Add Health). The final sample for analysis consisted of 7 935 participants (3 469 males, 4 466
females) that were complete respondents for the variables of interest at Wave IV. The participants ranged from
24.55-33.60 years. Weighted and unweighted receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were performed
predicting metabolic syndrome from the WHtR. Cutoffs were chosen using the Youden index. The derived cutoffs
were validated by logistic regression analysis on the Add Health participants and an external sample of 1 236
participants from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
Results: The ROC analysis resulted in a WHtR cutoff of 0.578 (Youden Index = 0.50) for the full sample of complete
respondents, 0.578 (Youden Index = 0.55) for males only, and 0.580 (Youden Index = 0.50) for females only. The area
under the curve was 0.798 (95 % CI (0.788, 0.809)) for the full sample of complete respondents, 0.833 (95 % CI
(0.818, 0.848)) for males only, and 0.804 (95 % CI (0.791, 0.818)) for females only. Participants in the validation
sample with a WHtR greater than the derived cutoff were more likely (Odds Ratio = 9.8, 95 % CI (6.2, 15.3)) to have
metabolic syndrome than those that were not.
Conclusion: A WHtR cutoff of 0.580 is optimal for discriminating individuals with metabolic syndrome in two
nationally representative samples of young adults. This cutoff is an improvement over a previously recommended
cutoff of 0.5 as well as other cutoffs derived from international samples.

Background
Obesity is an increasing worldwide problem and known
risk factor for the development of several chronic diseases
[1, 2]. BMI has traditionally been used as an indicator of
weight status and cardiometabolic risks associated with
being overweight. However, despite being widely utilized
as the default for determining weight status, evidence sug-
gests an inconsistent ability of the BMI to predict disease
risk. Several studies have shown individuals that were
overweight or obese based off of BMI cutoffs were actually
at reduced mortality compared with normal weight indi-
viduals, while only those that were severely obese or
underweight were at an increased risk [3­5].
For these reasons, alternative measures of weight status
that take the distribution of body mass into consideration
could be superior diagnostic measures for identifying car-
diovascular and metabolic disease risk. One of these mea-
sures is the waist-to-height ratio (WHtR), which has been
shown to outperform BMI and waist circumference (WC)

in discriminating risk of hypertension, diabetes, and car-
diovascular disease risk [6, 7].
Given the diagnostic potential of the WHtR, it is im-
portant that an appropriate cutoff is established that can
identify an individual as overweight or at risk for cardio-
vascular disease outcomes. An international cutoff of 0.5
has been proposed in the past [6, 7]. In addition, cutoffs
have been established in Asian populations. For example,
a study of Beijing adults established WHtR cutoffs of
0.51-0.53 and 0.48-0.50 in men and women, respectively
[8]. Another study conducted in China suggested cutoffs
for severe obesity of 0.54 in men and 0.57 in women [9].
However, it has been shown that WHtR may discrimin-
ate differently in Asian versus non-Asian populations,
and rigorous analysis has not been performed to estab-
lish a cutoff that can be applied to obesity research for
populations in the United States [10].
The primary objective of this study was to establish
such a cutoff using a sample of Wave IV participants
from National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(Add Health). In addition, we tested the validity of the
derived cutoff using another sample of young adults
from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). The results of this study could be
used in future Add Health studies to aid in analyses
when the WHtR is the outcome variable. In addition, it
could be used as a metric in other studies using young
adults in the United States when obesity or risk of obes-
ity is an outcome of interest.
Methods
Participants
The study utilized a sample of individuals from Add
Health [11]. Add Health is a longitudinal study that
investigates how social and environmental factors may
influence health and has followed a cohort of individuals
through four waves of interviewing and testing since its
inception during the 1994-1995 school year. The current
study utilized variables from Wave IV testing. The full
Add Health study consisted of 20 792 participants. Add
Health participants provided written informed consent
for participation in all aspects of Add Health in accord-
ance with the University of North Carolina School of
Public Health Institutional Review Board guidelines.
The initial subsample of this population consisted of
individuals that were part of blood glucose homeostasis
measurements (n = 15 701). Additionally, the packages
used for analyses in the current study required complete
information for all variables used, and a substantial
amount of the respondents had missing data for some of
the Wave IV measurements and variables. Any respond-
ent that did not have complete information for all of the
variables used was not part of the final analysis. The
final sample for analyses consisted of 7 935 participants.
For purpose of comparison, descriptive statistics are pre-
sented for both this sample as well as the respondents
that were removed in Table 1.
Race, sex, age, and smoking variables
Racial classification used the variable "AH_RACE" and
combined the groups "nonHispanic Asian" and "nonHis-
panic Native American" due to sparsely populated cells
for those groups. Race was treated as a factor, comparing
"nonHispanic African Americans", "nonHispanic Asian/
Native American", and "Hispanic" to the referent cat-
egory, "nonHispanic Caucasian." Age was measured con-
tinuously in years. Average age of the participants at
Wave IV was 28.65 (SD = 1.60) years and ranged from
24.55-33.60 years. Smoking was discrete and measured
in the amount of days smoked in the last month [11].
Sex was dichotomous with males coded as "1" and
females coded as "2." The names of the source variables
used can be found in Additional file 1: Table S1.
Cardiometabolic outcomes
For description of the collection of cardiometabolic mea-
surements in Add Health, please refer to the supplemen-
tary information to this manuscript (Additional file 2:
Supplementary Information).
When possible, the National Cholesterol Education
Adult Treatment Panel III (NCEP/ATP III) diagnostic
criteria for metabolic syndrome were used for classifica-
tion purposes [12, 13]. Individuals are considered to
have metabolic syndrome if three or more of five risk
factors are present. These include high waist circumfer-
ence, high blood pressure, high fasting blood glucose,
high triglyceride (TG), and low HDL [12, 13]. The
NCEP/ATP III criteria were applied for determination of
both high waist circumference (men: > 102 cm, women: >
88 cm) and blood pressure (135/85 mm HG). However,
due to the issues related to fasting time for blood glucose
measurements and the fact that only deciles were released
for lipid measurements, other constructs for risk in these
areas were used.
In place of fasting blood glucose, glycolated hemoglobin
(HbA1C
) was used as a measure of glycemic homeostasis.
Individuals with HbA1C
> 5.7 % were classified as pre-
diabetic or diabetic, which roughly corresponds to fasting
blood glucose of  100 mg/dl [14]. Because no absolute
measures for TG or HDL were released, decile ranks were
used to classify individuals for these two risk factors. Pre-
vious research from 2003-2006 reported a prevalence of
hypertriglyceridemia of 29.6 % and 17.8 % in 20-39 year
old males and females, respectively. The same study re-
ported a prevalence of low HDL of 21.4 % and 29.4 % in
20-39 year old males and females, respectively [14]. There-
fore, males that were in the top three deciles and females
that were in the top two deciles for TG were classified has

having this risk factor. Males that were in the bottom two
deciles and females that were in the bottom three deciles
for HDL were classified as having this risk factor.
Individuals that had three or more of the risk factors
were classified as having metabolic syndrome, resulting
in an overall prevalence of 23.35 % of individuals that
were part of the final cutoff analysis. The sex specific
prevalence was 28.16 % for males and 19.61 % for
females. These are slightly higher than those reported in
Ervin et al. (20.3 % in males aged 20-39 years, 15.6 % in
females aged 20-39 years) [14].
Height (cm) and waist circumference (cm) were ex-
tracted from the Add Health Wave 4 anthropometric
measurements. Waist circumference was measured to
the nearest 0.5 cm at the superior border of the iliac
crest. The WHtR metric was calculated by dividing waist
circumference by height.
ROC analysis: unweighted
Due to limitations of the statistical software package used
to identify cutoffs, we initially conducted unweighted
ROC analysis which did not account for sampling weights,
strata, or clusters. Analysis using metabolic syndrome as
the classification variable and WHtR as the continuous
predictor variable was performed to determine the appro-
priate WHtR cutoff. Both sex specific and full sample ana-
lyses were performed. The optimal cutoffs in this study
were determined by the Youden Index, which is defined as
Sensitivity + Specificity - 1 [15]. All analyses and calcula-
tions were done using R version 2.15.3 via the RStudio
platform, version 0.97.320 and used the R package "Opti-
malCutpoints" [16, 17].
ROC analysis: weighted
We also conducted weighted ROC analysis, which
accounted for sampling weights, strata, and clustering.
Add Health employs a multi-stage, stratified, and clustered
sampling strategy. In addition, certain racial, ethnic, and
socioeconomic groups were intentionally over-sampled
[18]. In order to account for the weights, strata, and
clusters, the R package "Survey" was used to create a
study design value that could be applied to different
types of analysis [19].

To conduct the weighted ROC analysis, "Survey" was
used to generate weighted contingency tables that ac-
count for weights, strata, and clustering variables. Step 1
involved creating potential cutoffs for the WHtR from
0.5-0.6 at a resolution of every hundredth. Step 2 involved
generating contingency tables for these cutoffs and pres-
ence of metabolic syndrome, and step 3 involved calculat-
ing the sensitivity and specificity of each potential cutoff.
For both the full and male only samples, the Youden Index
increased until 0.57 and then began to decrease. Cutoffs
were then created from 0.56 to 0.58 at a resolution of
every thousandth, and steps 2 and 3 of the analysis were
repeated. For females, the Youden Index increased until
0.59 and then decreased. Cutoffs were created ranging
from 0.575 to 0.595 at a resolution of every thousandth,
and steps 2 and 3 of the analysis were repeated.
"Survey" was also used to calculate the area under the
curve (AUC) for the optimal cutoffs by generating logistic
regression models to predict metabolic syndrome from
the derived cutoffs. Concordance was then calculated
from these models to determine the AUC.
Logistic regression model
Separate analysis was performed to test the derived cutoffs
while controlling for confounding factors. Indicator vari-
ables were created for whether or not an individual was
above the WHtR cutoff identified in the ROC analysis.
Weighted and unweighted logistic regression models were
constructed for the full sample, males only, and females
only. These models predicted presence of metabolic
syndrome from the WHtR cutoff indicator, race, sex,
age, and smoking.
External validation
Finally, the derived cutoffs were tested using an external
sample from NHANES for the 2005-2006 and 2007-
2008 collection periods. Analysis was restricted to
complete respondents for the variables of interest and to
individuals aged 25-35 years for comparison with the
Add Health participants. This resulted in a sample of 1
236 respondents. A construct for metabolic syndrome
was created, and the following contingency tables were
generated predicting metabolic syndrome from the de-
rived cutoffs: Unweighted, full sample, WHtR > 0.580;
Unweighted, males only, WHtR > 0.578; Unweighted,
females only, WHtR > 0.580; Weighted, full sample,
WHtR > 0.580. Finally, logistic regression analysis was
used to test the cutoff's ability to predict metabolic syn-
drome while controlling for race, age, sex, and smoking
status. A complete description of the variables (Additional
file 3) used as well as descriptive statistics (Additional
file 4) for this sample can be found in the supple-
mentary information to this manuscript.
Results
Descriptive statistics for the sample of complete respon-
dents as well as the respondents that were removed can
be found in Table 1. P values from independent tests of
proportions and means are displayed to test for system-
atic differences between the complete respondents and
the incomplete respondents. The two samples differed in
the demographic categories, with the most pronounced
differences between males and females (P < 0.0001),
"nonHispanic Caucasian" and "nonHispanic African
American" racial categories (P < 0.0001), and age (P <
0.0001). However, they did not differ on smoking status
(P = 0.997) and all but one of the metabolic outcomes
(Waist Circumference, P < 0.0001). Prevalence of meta-
bolic syndrome was not significantly different (P = 0.534)
between complete respondents and incomplete respon-
dents. Finally, the samples did not differ in measures of
weight status or weight distribution (BMI: P = 0.165,
WHtR P = 0.121).
The results of the unweighted ROC analysis are pre-
sented in Table 2. In addition to sensitivity and specifi-
city, point estimates and 95 % confidence intervals for
positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value
(NPV), positive likelihood ratio (PLR), negative likeli-
hood ratio (NLR), and odds ratios (OR) were calculated.
PPV is the probability that a person that tests positive
for the disease outcome is an actual case, while NPV is
the probability that a person that tests negative for the
disease outcome is not a case. PLR and NLR are mea-
sures of how much a test result will change the odds of
having a disease or not having a disease. The ROC plots
for this analysis are presented in Fig. 1.
The ROC analysis resulted in a WHtR cutoff of 0.578
(Youden Index = 0.50) for the full sample of complete
respondents, 0.578 (Youden Index = 0.55) for males only,
and 0.580 (Youden Index = 0.50) for females only. The
AUC was 0.798 (95 % CI (0.788, 0.809)) for the full sam-
ple of complete respondents, 0.833 (95 % CI (0.818,
0.848)) for males only, and 0.804 (95 % CI (0.791,
0.818)) for females only. Individuals that were above the
cutoff of 0.578 were 9.4 (95 % CI (8.22, 10.65)) times
more likely to have metabolic syndrome. Restricting to
males only, those that were above the cutoff of 0.578
were 11.4 (95 % CI (9.61, 13.60)) times more likely to
have metabolic syndrome. Finally, females that were
above a WHtR of 0.580 were 12.3 (95 % CI (9.88, 15.38))
times more likely to have metabolic syndrome.
The results of the weighted ROC analysis are pre-
sented in Table 3. This analysis once again resulted in a
cutoff of 0.578 (Youden Index = 0.51) in the full sample
while the cutoff for males only was 0.576 (Youden Index
= 0.58). The cutoff for females only increased to 0.594
(Youden Index = 0.51), though, there was a very narrow
range of values for the Youden Index between the
Bohr et al. BMC Public Health (2016) 16:295 Page 4 of 9
established cutoff of 0.594 and the cutoff from the initial
analysis 0.580 (Youden Index = 0.50). In addition, speci-
ficity in the female sample was the only diagnostic meas-
ure that differed significantly between the unweighted
(0.61, 95 % CI (0.59, 0.62)) and weighted analysis (0.65,
95 % CI (0.63, 0.66)). However, if the cutoff of 0.580 had
been used, the specificity (0.60, 95 % CI (0.57, 0.62))
would not have differed from the unweighted analysis.
The AUC was 0.794 for the full sample, 0.817 for males
only, and 0.805 for females only.
In separate analysis, logistic regression models were
constructed to test the established cutoffs while con-
trolling for confounding factors (Table 4). Each WHtR
cutoff was a highly significant predictor (P < 0.0001)
with the inclusion of constructs for race, smoking,
age, and sex.
Validation results
The full results of the validation analyses are presented
in the supplementary information (Additional file 5:
Table S4 and Additional file 6: Table S5) to this manu-
script. The overall cutoff of 0.580 resulted in a Youden
Index of 0.49 in the unweighted analysis and 0.52 in the
weighted analysis. In addition, the derived cutoffs were
highly significant predictors of metabolic syndrome in
the weighted and unweighted full sample logistic regres-
sion models as well as the unweighted sex-specific logis-
tic regression models.
Discussion
Recent research has established WHtR as a more useful
diagnostic measure for overweight than BMI. This could
be due in part to the fact that BMI does not take lean
mass or the distribution of body weight into consider-
ation. Fat distribution is known to factor greatly into risk
of cardiovascular disease and early death, as visceral fat
is more metabolically active and associated with greater
systemic inflammation when compared with subcutane-
ous adipose tissue [20, 21]. As such, visceral adiposity is
more causally related to insulin resistance, hypertension,
and dyslipidemia [22, 23].
Add Health is an ideal sample and study design to
conduct cutoff research and has several features that en-
hance the validity as well as the utility of our findings.
First, WHtR, as well as all of the metabolic outcomes,
were measured in the field by trained technicians rather
than self-reported. In addition, the design of the Add
Health study allows for opportunity to make true popu-
lation inferences as it is a nationally representative study
with variables in place to account for complex sampling
strategy. Finally, Add Health is a longitudinal study with
several waves of data collection and includes a vast array
of associational parameters for body composition and
weight distribution. The richness of this data may allow
researchers to observe how the cutoff may change as the
sample ages in addition to how behavioral, genetic, and
sociodemographic factors may impact risk of being over-
weight as defined by WHtR.
We opted to use metabolic syndrome as our disease
outcome as it incorporates a host of cardiovascular out-
comes that are linked to mortality. The prevalence of
metabolic syndrome that we observed in men (28.2 %)
and women (19.6 %) was slightly higher than had been
reported in previous studies [14, 24]. Ervin et al. (2009)
reported a prevalence of 20.3 % and 15.6 % in 20-39 year
old males and females, respectively, while Ford et al.
(2004) reported 16.5 % and 19.1 % in 20-39 year old
males and females, respectively. Waist circumference
was by far the largest source of the difference observed,
as our sample had a prevalence of abdominal obesity of
37.1 % and 65.3 % in males and females, respectively.
Both of these were significantly higher than reported by
Ervin et al. (32 % and 49.8 % in males and females,
respectively).
Another element of our sample worth commenting on
is whether or not there were significant differences
between the individuals that were complete respondents
for the variables we were observing and those that were
not included in our analysis. It is possible that selection
bias could have occurred if there were systematic differ-
ences between individuals that were complete respon-
dents, which would make our results less generalizable.

The individuals that were selected had significantly
higher occurrence of high waist adiposity. In addition,
there were racial and sex differences between the groups,
with the final sample having fewer males and "nonHispa-
nic African Americans" and more "nonHispanic Cauca-
sians" than the sample of participants that were not
selected. However, none of the other metabolic outcomes
differed between the two samples and there were no dif-
ferences between WHtR and BMI of the participants. In
addition, our decision to conduct sex specific and full
sample analyses reduces the chance that differences in
proportion of males and females could affect the final ana-
lyses. Finally, we tested the cutoffs established while con-
trolling for race, and these cutoffs stayed highly significant
in all analysis.
Previous research had suggested a potential inter-
national cutoff of 0.5. However, investigation of the Add
Health sample indicates that this may not be appropri-
ate. This cutoff is significantly below both the median
(0.559) and mean (0.578, SE = 0.001) WHtR of the sam-
ple and would classify the vast majority of the sample as
overweight. If used to predict metabolic syndrome, this

cutoff performs relatively poorly (Sensitivity: 0.97, 95 %
CI (0.96, 0.98); Specificity: 0.29 95 % CI (0.28, 0.30))
compared to the cutoffs we've established.
We performed both analysis that accounted for sampling
strategy (ie. weights, strata, and cluster) and analysis that
did not. There were slight differences in the resulting cut-
offs between the weighted analysis and the unweighted ana-
lysis, though none of the diagnostic measurements differed
between the two sets of analysis. The weighted analysis re-
sulted in a cutoff of 0.576 for males and 0.594 for females
while the unweighted analysis resulted in cutoffs of 0.578
and 0.580 for males and females. The difference in cutoffs
for females was somewhat concerning. However, there was
a very narrow range of the Youden Index (0.50-0.51) for
cutoffs from 0.580 to 0.594 in the weighted analysis, which
would indicate that cutoffs in this range would have
roughly the same diagnostic capability.
Given that two different sets of analyses were per-
formed, and that sex-specific cutoffs have been proposed
in the past, we feel that it is appropriate to recommend
a range of WHtR cutoffs for males (0.575-0.580) and
females (0.580-0.595) to classify individuals as over-
weight. However, considering that there were only
slight differences between the results of the weighted
and unweighted analysis, as well as the similar diagnostic
capabilities within a narrow range of cutoffs, we also feel
that it is appropriate to additionally report a single, overall
cutoff of 0.58.

The results of the logistic regression support the use
of these cutoffs and also show their physiologic signifi-
cance. The cutoffs remained highly significant predictors
in all analyses even with the inclusion of race, sex, smok-
ing status, and age. Additionally, the odds of metabolic
syndrome increased drastically if an individual was above
the cutoff. Males above the cutoff of 0.578 were greater
than eleven times more likely to have metabolic syn-
drome than males that were not, while females that were
above the cutoff of 0.580 were greater than twelve times
more likely to have metabolic syndrome than females
that were not. These results were similar in the weighted
and unweighted analysis.
Limitations
The primary limitation of the current study was the lack
of absolute measures for HDL and TG. This prevented
us from applying the NCEP/ATP III criteria for classifica-
tion of metabolic syndrome. Several other studies that use
metabolic syndrome apply the NCEP/ATP III criteria, so
our inability to do so impairs the comparability of our
results with other studies.
We were also limited in how we classified resondents
as having high blood glucose. The lack of control over
the fasting time of the participants made the results of
the blood glucose less reliable. We were, however, able
to use HbA1C
as an indicator of glucose status. While
HbA1C
is the gold standard for glycemic homeostasis, it
too deviates from the ATP III criteria and therefore
limits our comparability with other studies.
In addition, while the logistic regression models in-
cluded controls for race, sex, age, and smoking; they did
not include other common confounding factors such as
physical activity or socioeconomic status of the partici-
pants. As the primary purpose of these models was val-
idation of the cutoffs and not variability explanation in
metabolic syndrome, we felt it was appropriate to be
parsimonious in covariate inclusion. Finally, we feel that
the strength of the association, both statistically and
physiologically, between the WHtR and metabolic syn-
drome is such that it is unlikely additional covariates
would completely diminish the relationship.
The paper is limited by the cross-sectional nature of
the data and study design. While Add Health itself is a
longitudinal study, we utilized only data from Wave IV.
This prevents us from drawing a causal relationship
between the WHtR cutoff and metabolic syndrome.
Finally, a significant amount of the sample (7 776 re-
spondents) was lost due to missingness of any one of the
measures of interest. In addition, the final sample differed
from removed respondents in racial and gender make-up.
This impairs the ability of our findings to generalize to this
particular population and introduces the potential for
sampling bias. However, we feel that our use of sampling
weights, strata, and cluster variables in analysis attenuates
some of these issues. Finally, it is our contention that
though there is likely some degree of sampling bias
present, due to the fact that there were no differences
between complete and incomplete respondents for the
primary variables of interest (WHtR and metabolic syn-
drome) it is unlikely that the results are unreliable.
Conclusion
Based on both weighted and unweighted analyses, we
recommend a WHtR cutoff of 0.575-0.580 for males and
0.580-0.595 for females in addition to a single, overall
cutoff of 0.58. These cutoffs can be used in prospective
Add Health studies that use the WHtR as a predictor or
outcome and provide a measure of the physiologic sig-
nificance of differences in the WHtR. As the prevalence
of metabolic syndrome has been shown to increase with
age, future studies are warranted to determine age ap-
propriate cutoffs. In addition, a more hierarchical cutoff
structure similar to that of BMI could be developed. Our
cutoff identified individuals that had metabolic syn-
drome, but cutoffs could be developed to identify those
at low risk, moderate risk, and high risk. Finally, the
Add Health study provides a unique opportunity to
follow the cohort prospectively, which will allow us to
observe the disease histories of individuals that are
above or below these cutoffs.
