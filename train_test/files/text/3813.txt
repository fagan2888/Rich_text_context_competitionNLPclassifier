Introduction
Body weight appears to be an attribute that is increasingly
acquiring social importance. This phenomenon may be influ-
enced by the escalating global epidemic of overweight and
obesity, which affect both children and adults (World Health
Organization, 2013), and society's obsession with a thin
body image (Dittmar, 2007). Children's attitudes toward
body size have been the object of several studies, most of
which have focused on overweight figures and a few of
which have considered thin figures. A robust body of evi-
dence has shown that children display negative attitudes
toward obesity (e.g., Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Cramer &
Steinwert, 1998; Penny & Haddock, 2007a; Powlishta,
Serbin, Doyle, & White, 1994; Staffieri, 1967), whereas
findings concerning attitudes toward thinness are inconclu-
sive. Some research has found that children hold negative
attitudes toward thin targets, who are generally seen as being
socially submissive (Staffieri, 1967). Other studies have
emphasized mixed attitudes characterized by ascriptions of
socially desirable traits and negative physical features
(Brylinsky & Moore, 1994). More recent studies have shown
that thin figures are perceived as positively as average-
weight figures (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Musher-
Eizenman, Holub, Barnhart Miller, Goldstein, &
Edwards-Leeper, 2004). Although research has shown that
children's attitudes toward fatness have worsened over the
past 50 years (e.g., Latner & Stunkard, 2003), it is argued
that children's attitudes toward thinness may have become
more positive (Thelen, Powell, Lawrence, & Kuhnert, 1992).
The recent increase in the prevalence of eating disorders
in Western societies emphasizes a paradox: Whereas the
population is generally heavier, the mass media disseminate
an image of unrealistic thinness and simultaneously convey
stigmatized images of overweight individuals (Solbes &
Enesco, 2010). Smolak (2004) noted that media influences
appear to affect body image by late elementary school, and
the internalization of the societal standards of thinness is
considered to be a risk factor for body image disturbance and
eating pathology (Thompson & Stice, 2001). Relatedly,
overweight children who perceive weight-based discrimina-
tion are more likely to engage in binge-eating and unhealthy
weight-related behaviors compared with average-weight
peers (Puhl & Heuer, 2010). Therefore, both belief types
may increase social pressure on children, thus affecting their
social interactions and self-perceptions and leading to more
eating disorders. Thus, investigating children's body size
attitudes appears particularly relevant. The present study
examines attitudes toward thin, average-weight, and over-
weight figures among 6- to 11-year-old children.
Overall positive and negative attitudes toward specific
body types may obscure more notable nuances if the content
of such beliefs is not considered. The socio-psychological

Abstract
Six- to 11-year-old children's attitudes toward thin, average-weight, and overweight targets were investigated with associated
warmth and competence stereotypes. The results showed positive attitudes toward average-weight targets and negative
attitudes toward overweight peers: Both attitudes decreased as a function of children's age. Thin targets were perceived
more positively than overweight ones but less positively than average-weight targets. Notably, social desirability concerns
predicted the decline of anti-fat bias in older children. Finally, the results showed ambivalent stereotypes toward thin and
overweight targets--particularly among older children--mirroring the stereotypes observed in adults. This result suggests
that by the end of elementary school, children manage the two fundamental dimensions of social judgment similar to adults.

literature has widely documented the co-existence of both
favorable and unfavorable beliefs, rather than simply dislike
and antipathy, toward many social categories (e.g., Eagly &
Kite, 1987; Eagly & Mladinic, 1989; Glick & Fiske, 1996,
2001; Katz & Hass, 1988). Remarkably, recent empirical
evidence has shown that the content of group stereotypes is
organized around two fundamental dimensions: warmth and
competence (Fiske, Cuddy, & Glick, 2007). According to
Fiske (2012), "evolution argues for the utility of [a] rapid
category-based social judgment. People have to know whom
to approach or avoid and for what purposes" (p. 34). Warmth
and competence appear to be the two most crucial and adap-
tive aspects relevant to survival because warmth (e.g., friend-
liness, sincerity, trustworthiness, and sociability) reveals
good or bad intentions, and competence (e.g., intelligence,
skill, creativity, and efficacy) reveals the ability to act on
those intentions.
More subtle and modern forms of prejudice are character-
ized by mixed combinations of these two basic dimensions;
that is, groups are described as either competent or warm but
not both (see Cuddy, Fiske, & Glick, 2008, for a review).
Pertinently, recent research has shown mixed ascriptions of
warmth and competence toward obese adults; that is, heavy
individuals were rated as more warm than competent relative
to lean individuals (Vartanian & Silverstein, 2013). However,
to the best of our knowledge, research has not yet systemati-
cally investigated these dimensions on children's stereo-
types. Therefore, the present study also explores children's
warmth and competence stereotypes concerning body weight
to qualify the valence of these attitudes.
Children's Body Size Attitudes
Overweight children suffer from severe stigmatization.
These children are perceived as mean and undesirable play-
mates (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998) who possess more nega-
tive personality and behavioral traits (Sigelman, Miller, &
Whitworth, 1986) and are less likely to be associated with
positive abilities than average-weight children (Penny &
Haddock, 2007a). Interestingly, these negative attitudes
appear to be shared by children who are overweight them-
selves (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Holub, 2008; Staffieri,
1967). As a result, overweight children suffer from peer
rejection (Harper, Wacker, & Cobb, 1986; Strauss, Smith,
Frame, & Forehand, 1985), victimization (Adams &
Bukowski, 2008), academic underachievement (Crosnoe &
Muller, 2004; Taras & Potts-Datema, 2005), lower self-
esteem (Klesges et al., 1992), and anxiety (Vila et al., 2004)
more frequently than average-weight children.
Studies have shown that children's anti-fat attitudes vary
with age (e.g., Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Cramer &
Steinwert, 1998; Powlishta et al., 1994). The variations
observed by researchers are consistent with those suggested
by cognitive-developmental theory (Aboud, 1988, 2003)
regarding the development of children's ethnic prejudice. At
the pre-school level, children focus on the external attributes
of individuals and make global, gross distinctions based on
familiar versus unfamiliar characteristics. These "like me"
and "not like me" categories (Sigelman et al., 1986) peak at
approximately 5 to 8 years old and lead to a clear-cut prefer-
ence for the ingroup over the outgroup. At approximately 8
to 9 years old, children increasingly perceive intra-group
differences and inter-group similarities, which allow them
to consider other people's perspectives, thus attenuating
their ingroup preference and outgroup dislike. However,
many scholars have argued that this decline may simply
involve a social desirability concern; that is, older children
may be more aware of what is socially unacceptable and
may thus be less overtly biased (e.g., Brown, 2010; Rutland,
2004).
Consistent with Aboud's theory, children between 5 and 8
years old are generally more biased toward overweight peers
than 9- to 11-year olds (e.g., Penny & Haddock, 2007a,
2007b). This result is most likely because older children have
more developed reasoning skills. However, it is not obvious
whether such reasoning skills help older children appreciate
overweight peers' perspectives or help them become more
aware of how they are perceived by others and by under-
standing that discrimination is wrong, are less likely to be
openly biased. A recent meta-analysis (Raabe & Beelmann,
2011) integrating 90 years of research on ethnic, racial, and
national prejudices has shown that the increase in prejudice
between early and middle childhood (2-7 years old) can be
regarded as a typical developmental change "because it is a
persistent finding that was obtained independently of contact
opportunities, and the divergent operationalizations of preju-
dice . . ., across a large pool of studies from different social
contexts" (p. 1729). By contrast, the decrease that occurs
between middle and late childhood (7-10 years old) is
affected by the measurements used in the studies. More spe-
cifically, Raabe and Beelmann (2011) observed an age-
related change on explicit but not implicit attitudes. This
result appears consistent for anti-fat attitudes. Solbes and
Enesco (2010) investigated such attitudes at the explicit and
implicit levels in 6- to 11-year-old children. The results
showed that as children age, they appear to reduce their lev-
els of explicit prejudice but not implicit bias.
Some results have also suggested that anti-fat attitudes are
gender-related. Although some studies have observed no
gender differences (e.g., Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Solbes &
Enesco, 2010; Stager & Burke, 1982), others have shown
that overweight females are more stigmatized than their male
peers (e.g., C. S. Crandall, 1995; Phillips & Hill, 1998) and
some evidence indicates that girls show stronger anti-fat atti-
tudes than boys (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Sigelman et al.,
1986). Penny and Haddock (2007b) investigated the mere
proximity effect (i.e., average-weight individuals are deni-
grated when placed next to overweight individuals rather
than average-weight individuals; Hebl &Mannix, 2003) in
5- to 10-year-old children. Such an effect occurred in
Durante et al. 3
children as young as 5 years old and was likely to occur
when evaluations were made on female targets.
According to Smolak (2004), "body image is a strongly
gendered phenomenon" (p. 21). In her review of the litera-
ture, Smolak noted that the incidence of body dissatisfaction
is similar in male and female adolescents, but not in children
younger than approximately 11 years old (see also Tang-
Péronard & Heitmann, 2008). Young boys appear to be less
concerned about their bodies compared with their female
counterparts. For example, Pine (2001) found that the ideal
female figure selected by girls (5- to 11-year-olds) was sig-
nificantly thinner compared with the ideal male figure cho-
sen by boys. Furthermore, when asked to select the figure
they aspired to be as an adult, girls expressed higher prefer-
ences for the thinner figure. Young girls appear to be under a
greater pressure to achieve a particular body type, particu-
larly in contemporary Western societies. Building on the
objectification theory (Fredrickson & Roberts, 1997),
Smolak argued that
while the male body is viewed as agentic and active, the female
body is an object to be looked at, particularly by men. The
function of women's bodies, then, is to be attractive, to be
sexually pleasing to men. Girls learn this lesson early with
messages coming from media, peers, and parents [which are
more consistently directed toward girls than boys] (p. 22).
Considering the above evidence, the present study
explores 6- to 11-year-old children's attitudes toward thin,
average-weight, and overweight figures with the following
aims: to replicate previous results concerning obesity,
namely, a stronger anti-fat bias in younger children com-
pared with older children; to shed new light on attitudes
toward thinness; and to deepen the role of gender in both
types of attitudes. In addition, we investigated social desir-
ability concerns to account for the predicted decline of anti-
fat attitudes in older children (i.e., fifth grade).
Stereotype Content
According to Penny and Haddock (2007a), extensive
research has been carried out to establish the content of obe-
sity stereotypes held by adults, whereas much less attention
has been devoted to children's stereotypes of overweight
children. Furthermore, no research has systematically inves-
tigated children's stereotype content regarding thin, average-
weight, and overweight figures in terms of warmth and
competence, which are considered to be the fundamental
dimensions of social judgment (see Abele, Cuddy, Judd, &
Yzerbyt, 2008). These dimensions are often observed in
ambivalent combinations; that is, groups are perceived as
warm or competent but not both (Fiske et al., 2007; Fiske,
Cuddy, Glick, & Xu, 2002). These ambivalent combinations
are consistent with the compensation hypothesis (Judd,
James-Hawkins, Yzerbyt, & Kashima, 2005) that states that
a compensatory process occurs when one is judged more
positively on one dimension (either warmth or competence)
than on the other. Thus, people attempt to "rectify this dispar-
ity [on one dimension] by asserting that the situation must be
reversed on the other dimension of social judgment" (Judd et
al., 2005, p. 910). These trade-offs of warmth and compe-
tence are led by a compensatory motive that operates when
the judgments of individuals or groups are generated in a
comparative context (see Kervyn, Yzerbyt, & Judd, 2010 for
a review). Ambivalent combinations of warmth and compe-
tence are pervasive in social judgments because they are
functional and depict individuals or groups as possessing
counterbalanced good and bad qualities to maintain a sense
of justice (see Judd et al., 2005; Kay & Jost, 2003).
Studies have shown that overweight children are believed
to be less intelligent, lazier, and less academically successful
compared with their average-weight peers (e.g., Cramer &
Steinwert, 1998; Hill & Silver, 1995; Musher-Eizenman et
al., 2004; Penny & Haddock, 2007a; Tiggemann &Anesbury,
2000). By contrast, thin children are perceived as kinder,
cleverer, and friendlier than overweight children (e.g.,
Brylinsky & Moore, 1994; Wardle, Volz, & Golding, 1995).
Altogether, the existing research appears to indicate that
warmth and competence may underlie children's stereotypes.
However, little is known about how these two dimensions
are combined with reference to specific body types.
As noted, a recent contribution has shown that overweight
adults were rated as more warm than competent relative to
lean adults (Vartanian & Silverstein, 2013). In a related
research domain, Barg, Armstrong, Hetz, and Latimer (2010)
investigated the stigma that able-bodied adults have toward
children with a physical disability in terms of warmth and
competence. People with disabilities are perceived cross-
culturally as more warm than competent (Cuddy et al., 2009;
Durante et al., 2013). Pity, sympathy, and disrespect are gen-
erally directed toward individuals stereotyped in such a man-
ner (Cuddy et al., 2008; Fiske et al., 2002). Barg et al. argued
that "stigma and the consequent reactions towards those with
a disability may be explained by the qualitative differences
in perceived warmth and perceived competence in the con-
tent of stereotypes held by society at large" (p. 372).
Consequently, and according to the stereotype content mod-
el's predictions (cf. Fiske et al., 2002), improving perceived
competence may reduce the stigma that is directed toward
individuals with disabilities. The results showed that by
boosting perceptions of competence of a child with physical
disabilities (i.e., portraying him or her as being active), he or
she was rated as more competent than an able-bodied child.
Therefore, are children's anti-fat attitudes just negative
(as the literature appears to suggest) or are negative evalua-
tions on one dimension compensated by positive evaluations
on the other dimension? Because "not all stereotypes are
alike" (Fiske et al., 2002), we aim to broaden previous
research on children's body size attitudes by considering the
related stereotype content in terms of warmth and

competence and establishing the combination of these
dimensions for each body type. Based on the research of
Barg et al. (2010), identifying different warmth and compe-
tence combinations might help when designing appropriate
intervention programs to reduce weight bias.
Method
Participants
Children (N = 158, 79 males, 79 females; 92.4% Italian)
were recruited from elementary schools in Northern Italy.
Letters describing the study and asking for consent were sent
to the parents/guardians of all children. Only those children
whose parents/guardians returned the signed consent form to
the school participated in the study. The participants were
taken from alternate school years (first, third, and fifth grade)
to comprise three age groups: 50 participants (24 males and
26 females) between 6 and 7 years old (M
age
= 6.35 years), 55
participants (30 males and 25 females) between 8 and 9 years
old (M
age
= 8.37 years), and 53 participants (25 males and 28
females) between 10 and 11 years old (M
age
= 10.35 years).
Materials
Six cartoons were created using graphic computer software
and were pasted onto 16.5 × 24 cm white cardboard squares.
Each cartoon represented a male or female thin, average-
weight, or overweight child. Computer software allowed us
to manipulate body weight changes while maintaining the
stability of the other elements. The characters for each gen-
der were identical except for body size: thin (3.9 cm wide),
average-weight (5.4 cm wide), and overweight (9.2 cm
wide). Measurements were taken at the widest part of the
body. The children made their evaluations (except for the
Social Desirability Scale; see below) using a 5-point scale.
Each point of the scale was labeled appropriately (i.e., 1 =
not at all, 2 = a little, 3 = don't know, 4 = a lot, 5 = very
much) and included smiley faces graded from the most seri-
ous to the happiest. Both the cards and scale were pilot tested
using a convenience sample of 18 children (8 males and 10
females) from 6 to 11 years old. The children were asked to
order the cards from "the thinnest to the chubbiest" (or vice
versa) to ensure that our stimuli conveyed different body
weights. Furthermore, the children completed several prac-
tice questions (e.g., "How much do you like doing your
homework?" "How much do you like ice cream?") to ensure
that all children understood how to use the scale. Both the
figures and scale were appropriate for the children's age
groups and aims of the present study.
Procedure and Measures
The participants were interviewed individually during the
school day. A trained male experimenter conducted all
testing. After a brief period of social interaction, the children
were familiarized with the scale through a few practice ques-
tions (as in the pilot study), and the experimenter ensured
that they understood how to use it. The experimenter then
randomly presented the six figures one at a time giving the
children the ability to rate each figure the same way.
Attitude toward body size.For each figure, the participants
were asked the following three questions: "How much do
you like this boy/girl?" "How much would you like to have
him/her as a friend?" and "How much would you like to have
him/her as a desk partner?" The reliability for each target
figure within each age group was satisfactory (alphas
between .66 and .87; median = .77).
Stereotype content.Next, the participants were again pre-
sented with the target figures one at a time in random order
and were asked to evaluate each figure for competence and
warmth. Two items were used for each dimension: "How
much do you think this boy/girl is intelligent/good at school?"
(i.e., competence) and "How much do you think this boy/girl
is kind/amusing?" (i.e., warmth). The warmth and compe-
tence reliabilities calculated for each target figure within
each age group were generally sufficient (competence
median  = .68; warmth median  = .70).
Finally, the children were asked to order the figures from
"the thinnest to the chubbiest" (or vice versa) to ensure that
they were able to discriminate between different body sizes.1
None of the participants failed this task.
Social desirability.At the end of the session, only the fifth-
grade children were presented with a true­false, 12-item
response format questionnaire to measure social desirability.
We used a short form (Short-Form B) of the Crandall Social
Desirability Test for Children (CSDTC; V. C. Crandall,
Crandall, & Katkovsky, 1965) implemented by Carifio
(1994). The items were translated and adjusted for the Italian
context. Examples include the following: "I would never hit
anyone who was smaller than I am" and "Sometimes I feel
like staying home from school even if I'm not sick." The reli-
ability was sufficient ( = .65). The participants' responses
were coded and aggregated to form a reliable social desir-
ability index (ranging from 0 to 12) with higher scores indi-
cating higher social desirability concerns.
Results
Attitude Toward Body Size
The items were averaged to form reliable scores for each tar-
get figure. A 2 (Participant Gender) × 3 (Age Group) × 2
(Target Gender) × 3 (Target Weight) mixed ANOVA was per-
formed with the last two factors serving as within-partici-
pants factors. The results showed two significant main
effects. First, a Target Weight main effect, F(2, 304) =
Durante et al. 5
229.41, p< .001, 2 = .60: Average-weight figures (M = 3.86,
SD = 0.60) were the most positively evaluated followed by
thin figures (M = 3.31, SD = 0.72), leaving the overweight
figures as the least liked (M = 2.47, SD = 0.88). All three
means significantly differed from the midpoint of the scale,
ts(157) > 5.30, ps < .001. Second, a Target Gender main
effect, F(1, 152) = 5.79, p< .05, 2 = .04, indicating that male
figures (M = 3.28, SD = 0.69) received higher evaluations
than female figures (M = 3.15, SD = 0.78).
The results also revealed three significant two-way inter-
actions. First, Age Group × Target Weight, F(4, 304) = 15.28,
p< .001, 2 = .17, indicated that the three body sizes were
evaluated differently according to the participants' age,
which was expected. Simple effects2 revealed significant dif-
ferences in the evaluations of both overweight, F(2, 152) =
12.62, p< .001, 2 = .14, and average-weight figures,
F(2, 152) = 4.47, p< .05, 2 = .06. Table 1 shows that the
evaluations of overweight targets became more positive from
younger to older children, although third- and fifth-grade
children's ratings did not differ significantly. Similarly, first-
grade children evaluated average-weight figures more posi-
tively compared with both third- and fifth-grade children.
Notably, the evaluations of thin targets did not vary accord-
ing to the participant's age, F(2, 152) = 1.64, p = .20. Finally,
within each age group, average-weight figures were the most
liked followed by thin and overweight figures (Fs > 38.7,
ps < .001, 2s > .34).
Second, there was a significant interaction between the
participant's and target's gender, F(1, 152) = 162.34, p<
.001, 2 = .52, which indicated that the participants preferred
targets of their own gender (see Table 2).
The third significant interaction was Target Gender ×
Target Weight, F(2, 304) = 8.34, p< .001, 2 = .05 (see Table
3). Simple effects showed that average-weight and over-
weight female targets, in particular, were rated less favorably
than average-weight and overweight male targets: average-
weight targets, F(1, 152) = 6.41, p< .05, 2 = .04; overweight
targets, F(1, 152) = 17.27, p< .001, 2 = .10. Again, no sig-
nificant difference was observed for thin figures, F(1, 152) =
1.14, p = .29.
The last two interactions were qualified by the three-way
interaction of Participant Gender × Target Gender × Target
Weight, F(2, 304) = 7.76, p< .01, 2 = .05, which was dis-
sected as a function of participant gender. Two repeated-
measureANOVAs were performed. For the male participants,
the results showed significant Target Gender, F(1, 78) =
113.29, p< .001, 2 = .59, and Target Weight, F(2, 156) =
84.92, p< .001, 2 = .52, main effects, which replicated the
results shown above. However, the interaction was non-sig-
nificant, F(2, 156) = 2.01, p = .14. The results for female
participants showed significant main effects: Target Gender,
F(1, 78) = 54.72, p< .001, 2 = .41; Target Weight,
F(2, 156) = 106.61, p< .001, 2 = .58; and a Target Gender ×
Target Weight interaction, F(2, 156) = 14.79, p< .001, 2 =
.16. Simple effects revealed that female participants attrib-
uted higher ratings to targets of their own gender (i.e.,
ingroup bias): thin, F(1, 78) = 56.28, p< .001; average-
weight, F(1, 78) = 32.94, p< .001; and overweight, F(1, 78)
= 4.13, p< .05. However, the associated effect sizes (2 = .42,
2 = .30, and 2 = .05, respectively) suggest that female par-
ticipants were less biased toward their own gender in evalu-
ating overweight targets (see Table 4).
Social Desirability
Anti-fat attitudes declined as a function of participants' age.
To investigate this decline, a regression analysis was per-
formed in which overweight target ratings from fifth-grade
children were regressed onto their social desirability scores.
The results showed that social desirability predicted anti-fat
attitudes ( = .35, p< .05, R2 = .12); that is, the higher the
level of social desirability, the more positive the attitude

expected decline in preference for average-weight targets
among older children. However, social desirability did not
predict such a decline in fifth-grade children ( = .20, p =

Warmth and competence items were averaged to form reli-
able scores. To explore the existence of ambivalent stereo-
type content in children, a 3 (Age Group) × 3 (Target Weight)
× 2 (Dimension) mixed ANOVA was performed with the last
two factors serving as within-participants factors.3 We were
especially interested in the warmth and competence combi-
nation for each body size and in their variations, if any,
according to children's age. The results showed a significant
Target Weight main effect, F(2, 310) = 59.37, p< .001,
2 = .28; Age Group × Target Weight, F(4, 310) = 5.81, p<
.001, 2 = .07; and Age Group × Dimension interactions,
F(2, 155) = 3.55, p< .05, 2 = .04. Most relevantly, we found
a significant Target Weight × Dimension interaction, F(2,
310) = 38.83, p< .001, 2 = .20. Simple effects revealed that
warmth and competence ratings differed significantly for
thin, F(1, 155) = 23.66, p< .001, 2 = .13, and overweight,
F(1, 155) = 40.70, p< .001, 2 = .21, figures. Table 5 shows
that thin targets were judged as more competent than warm,
whereas overweight targets were judged as more warm than
competent. Notably, average-weight targets were rated as
both competent and warm, F< 1. Furthermore, the simple
effects associated with the two dimensions showed that over-
weight figures were evaluated as the least competent, F(2,
154) = 76.11, p< .001, 2 = .50, whereas average-weight tar-
gets were judged as the warmest, F(2, 154) = 22.52, p< .001,
2 = .23. The other comparisons for each dimension were not
significant.
The relevant three-way Age Group × Target Weight ×
Dimension interaction was not significant, F(4, 310) = 1.44,
p = .22. However, it is possible that different directions in the
warmth and competence evaluations for each target weight
in each age group could have canceled each other out, thus
leading to a non-significant three-way interaction. Therefore,
we further investigated the possibility of compensation in
different dimensions at different ages by comparing the
warmth and competence means for each body size within
each age group. The results for the first-grade children
showed that thin targets were perceived as more competent
(M = 3.90, SD = 0.82) than warm (M = 3.53, SD = 0.86),
t(49) = 3.58, p< .01, whereas the remaining comparisons
were non-significant (ts < 1.25, ps > .20). The third-grade
children's warmth and competence attributions differed sig-
nificantly only for the overweight targets, who were rated as
more warm (M = 3.74, SD = 0.74) than competent (M = 3.15,
SD = 0.91), t(54) = 4.83, p< .001. Finally, fifth-grade chil-
dren evaluated thin figures as more competent (M = 3.80,
SD = 0.53) than warm (M = 3.42, SD = 0.66), t(52) = 3.74, p<
.001, and overweight targets as more warm (M = 3.77, SD =
0.74) than competent (M = 3.23, SD = 0.76), t(52) = 4.85, p<
.001. The average-weight targets were evaluated as both
competent and warm (t< 1) at any age.
To identify the warmth and competence Italian cultural
stereotype associated with different body sizes, a brief ques-
tionnaire was administered to a convenience sample of 33
college students (29 females; M
age
= 20.31, SD = 1.33). The
participants were asked to evaluate how intelligent and capa-
ble (i.e., competence) and how warm and friendly (i.e.,
warmth)4 thin, average-weight, and overweight men and
women were. The responses were made on 5-point scales,
from 1 (not at all) to 5 (very much). The reliabilities were
sufficient (competence  = .63, warmth  = .75). A 3 (Target
Weight) × 2 (Dimension) repeated-measures ANOVA
showed a significant Target Weight main effect, F(2, 64) =
18.18, p< .001, 2 = .36, and most importantly, a significant
Target Weight × Dimension interaction, F(2, 64) = 49.09, p<
.001, 2 = .61. Simple effects revealed that warmth and com-
petence ratings differed significantly for thin, F(1, 32) =
32.92, p< .001, 2 = .51, and overweight, F(1, 32) = 39.55,
p< .001, 2 = .55, targets as was previously observed. The
means reported in Table 6 show that the participants attrib-
uted more competence than warmth to thin targets and more
warmth than competence to overweight targets, whereas
average-weight targets were judged as both competent and

warm (F< 1). Finally, the means for warmth all differed sig-
nificantly, F(2, 31) = 33, p< .001, 2 = .68, with overweight
targets receiving the highest evaluations. Only average-
weight and overweight targets differed in the competence
dimension, F(2, 31) = 6.80, p< .01, 2 = .31 (cf. Vartanian &
Silverstein, 2013).
Discussion
The results showed that children of all ages differentiated
among the three body sizes. Children held the most positive
attitude toward average-weight targets and the most negative
attitude toward overweight targets. Attitudes toward thin tar-
gets appeared to be more positive than those toward over-
weight figures but not as positive as attitudes toward
average-weight targets. Both the preference for average-
weight and the dislike for overweight children decreased
from first- to fifth-grade children. However, social desirabil-
ity concerns appear to be involved in the decline of the anti-
fat attitude, at least among fifth-grade children. Finally,
consistent with Brylinsky and Moore's (1994) findings, atti-
tudes toward thin targets did not vary according to children's
age.
Concerning gender, we found that children favored their
own gender, as reported in previous studies (e.g., Penny &
Haddock, 2007b; Powlishta, 1995). However, average-
weight and overweight female targets, in particular, were
evaluated less favorably than their male counterparts.
Notably, although female participants preferred figures of
their own gender, this ingroup bias was less prominent in
their evaluations of the overweight female target. This result
appears in line with previous findings showing stronger anti-
fat attitudes in girls than boys (e.g., Cramer & Steinwert,
1998; Sigelman et al., 1986). We did not observe a stronger
preference for thin figures among girls compared with boys.
In summary, there were neither gender nor age differences
for the thin targets, but we found age differences for both
average-weight and overweight targets as well as indications
of stronger anti-fat attitudes toward female overweight tar-
gets. These results are not only consistent with previous
research but also extend it in several respects. First, we
assessed attitudes toward thinness as well as fatness. The
majority of previous studies considered only two body types:
either thin or average-weight and overweight. The present
study assessed children's attitudes toward three body types
and found that average-weight is the most liked body size,
but thinness is always preferred over fatness. Furthermore,
we did not adopt a forced-choice paradigm, but the children
had the option to rate each figure in the identical manner.
Therefore, it is unlikely that the biases observed here are
merely the effects of the methodology used. Second, we shed
new light on the role of gender in the anti-fat prejudice, thus
showing that although children preferred targets of their own
gender, the female overweight target was more stigmatized
and did not benefit from the gender ingroup bias as much as
its male counterpart.
Third, our results demonstrated that social desirability
concerns play a role in the decline of anti-fat attitudes among
older children. Similar to recent arguments for racial, ethnic,
and national prejudices (see Raabe & Beelmann, 2011), this
result supports the idea that as age increases, children become
more aware of what is socially desirable and modulate their
responses to appear more positive and less biased. Our find-
ings are also consistent with Solbes and Enesco's (2010)
results on implicit versus explicit weight bias. However,
social desirability did not account for the diminished prefer-
ence toward average weight found among older children,
lending support to cognitive theories (e.g., Aboud, 1988).
The aforementioned results have established the positiv-
ity/negativity of children's body size attitudes. However,
results concerning stereotype content showed that such atti-
tudes are more sophisticated than simply liking or disliking
specific body types. In fact, although children perceived
overweight targets as the least competent, they appeared to
compensate in the warmth dimension, attributing higher
warmth than competence to these targets. Similarly, thin fig-
ures were judged as more competent than warm, whereas
average-weight targets were judged as both competent and
warm. These compensation versus halo effects (see
Rosenberg, Nelson, & Vivekananthan, 1968) are in line with
what was argued by Fiske et al. (2002). According to these
authors, the majority of groups' stereotypes are ambivalent,
but reference groups and ingroups are generally perceived as
possessing both warmth and competence. In the present
research, and consistent with the findings of previous studies
on the anti-fat prejudice, average-weight targets represent
the favorite body type. The majority of children identified
with the average-weight figures (i.e., ingroup; see Note 1).
Therefore, it is not surprising to find a univalent (only posi-
tive) stereotype toward average-weight figures.
Our results concerning the more-warm-than-competent
overweight stereotype are in line with the findings of Penny
and Haddock (2007a) who investigated the same stereotype
in terms of athletic, artistic, academic, and social abilities.
The last two domains may be considered equivalent to com-
petence and warmth, respectively. Although these authors
used a different methodology, they found that compared with

average-weight characters, children between 5 and 8 years
old were less likely to associate overweight characters with
academic ability, whereas children from 9 to 10 years old
attributed greater social abilities to overweight characters.
The present work supports and extends these results by
examining how the two fundamental dimensions of social
judgment are relative to one another in children's stereotypes
by assessing the stereotype content of three body types and
by demonstrating the presence of ambivalent stereotypes in
children. Children's attributions of warmth and competence
to thin, average-weight, and overweight targets mirrored
those of adults (both in the present research and in Vartanian
& Silverstein, 2013), and the evidence of an age trend sug-
gests that by the end of elementary school, children seem to
manage the two fundamental dimensions of social judgment
as adults do.
Implications
The present study has important theoretical and practical
implications. First, our findings concerning the relationship
between the decline of anti-fat attitudes and social desirabil-
ity concerns in fifth graders are consistent with previous
results, indicating that strong negative biases toward over-
weight peers persist during pre-adolescence (e.g., Enesco,
Guerrero, Callejas, & Solbes, 2010). Furthermore, over-
weight and obese individuals experience prejudice and dis-
crimination in every area of their lives, and according to
Johnston (2012), "Weight-based discrimination is on the rise
and remains a socially acceptable form of discrimination" (p.
452; see also Puhl & Heuer, 2010).
All these results emphasize the need for age-appropriate
interventions promoting prejudice reduction at overt and
subtler levels. Raabe and Beelmann (2011) noted that the
transition from middle to late childhood (7-10 years old) is a
sensitive period for environmental influences on prejudice.
These authors suggested contact-based interventions together
with a stronger and more direct communication of anti-prej-
udice and egalitarian norms as strategies to reduce ethnic
prejudice. We believe that such strategies could also be effec-
tive to address negative weight-based attitudes in children.
For example, Hansson and Rasmussen (2010) also found that
one of the predictors of the obesity stereotype in 10-year-old
children was parental body size; that is, children showed
stronger obesity stereotypes with decreasing parental body
size. Relying on the contact hypothesis (Allport, 1954) which
states that frequent interactions with outgroup members may
improve negative attitudes, both toward the outgroup mem-
ber that one interacts with and toward the entire outgroup,
the authors argued that a possible explanation for their result
"is that children with larger parents realize that body size has
little or nothing to do with certain behaviours or characteris-
tics, and are therefore less disposed to stereotype" (Hansson
& Rasmussen, 2010, p. 31).
Second, the more-warm-than-competent overweight ste-
reotype observed in the present study provides us with some
indications of which stereotypical dimension we should
focus on when designing an intervention. The study by Barg
et al. (2010) on the stigma toward children with physical dis-
abilities (also stereotyped as more warm than competent) has
shown that improving perceived competence may reduce the
stigma directed toward such individuals. Therefore, contact-
based, competence-oriented early interventions are essential,
especially considering the recent results that show that the
warmth and competence stereotypes may constrain and
direct outgroups'behavior interpretations (Richetin, Durante,
Mari, Perugini, & Volpato, 2012).
Limitations and Future Directions
The present study has some limitations that should be
addressed in future studies. First, the social desirability mea-
sure was only administered to 5th-grade children. The
CSDTC (V. C. Crandall et al., 1965) was tested with 3rd to
12th graders, but the short form used here was validated by
Carifio(1994)with10-year-oldandolderchildren.Therefore,
it was not appropriate to administer the test to younger chil-
dren. Because in our results 3rd- and 5th-grade children did
not differ in their evaluations of the overweight targets, to
deepen the role that social desirability plays in children's
anti-fat attitude at different ages, future research should con-
sider and develop other instruments to investigate the devel-
opmental pattern of such a construct. Similarly, the decline in
the average-weight preference should be further investigated.
In fact, it is plausible to assume that as children become more
aware of social norms (e.g., modesty), ingroup preference
might consequently decrease.
Second, although consistent with previous results
(Brylinsky & Moore, 1994), we did not observe a preference
for thin targets in either boys or girls, which is inconsistent
with what has been observed in the body image and dissatis-
faction literature. This inconsistency may be because the
incidence of body dissatisfaction is not obvious in children
younger than 11 years old (Smolak, 2004; Tang-Péronard &
Heitmann, 2008). However, because previous studies have
shown that young children display an awareness of dieting
messages (e.g., Holub et al., 2005) and cultural standards for
beauty prior to puberty (e.g., Smolak, 2004), it is plausible to
assume that little girls in particular may not be immune to
these influences. Harriger, Calogero, Witherington, and
Smith (2010) noted that researchers "have documented that
the current ideal body type for women is not only thin, but a
`curvaceously thin' body shape"; therefore, it "is not simply
a matter of attaining a low body weight but also having the
necessary fat distribution in certain areas (e.g., breasts, but-
tocks) to achieve the desired body proportions" (p. 610).
Similarly, the ideal male body type has muscles (see Kelley,
Neufeld, & Musher-Eizenman, 2010). The stimuli used in
the current research portrayed children; therefore, there were
no curves on the girls and no muscles on the boys.
Consequently, expressing a preference for average-weight
figures does not clarify the ideal body type that children
Durante et al. 9
might want to achieve as adults, which could affect their eat-
ing behaviors more than their attitudes toward thin peers.
Specifically designed studies are necessary to address this
problem.
Relative to the stimuli, the difference in width between the
three body weights may be considered a further limitation. In
fact, thin and average figures differed by 1.5 cm, whereas the
difference between the average- and overweight figures was
more than 3 cm. However, in the pilot study, 6- to 11-year-old
children were able to order the cards from "the thinnest to the
chubbiest" (or vice versa), and in the main study, the partici-
pants preferred average-size figures to both thin and over-
weight figures. These results indicated that children were able
to categorize the figures according to their weight. However,
more constant and systematic changes in body weight should
be used in building stimuli for future studies.
Fourth, we did not measure the participants' height and
weight. However, the research suggests that anti-fat attitudes
appear to be shared by children and adults who are over-
weight themselves (Cramer & Steinwert, 1998; Holub,
2008), and perceived body size seems to be a better predictor
of such attitudes (Solbes & Enesco, 2010). Note 1 indicates
that we controlled for perceived body size by asking the chil-
dren to select the child that they looked most similar to from
the six figures. The results showed that the majority of chil-
dren of all ages chose the average-weight figure. Future
research should address both issues more carefully with a
larger and more heterogeneous sample.
Finally, concerning the stereotype content, to our knowl-
edge, this is the first study showing that ambivalent combi-
nations of warmth and competence characterize children's
stereotype content. Although there is no reason to expect that
these findings should operate differently in other social cat-
egories or nations, future research should extend these results
by considering other types of targets (e.g., ethnic, gender
groups) in other countries. Furthermore, future studies
should experimentally establish compensation processes in
children, such as by using stories of fictitious individuals and
manipulating one dimension at a time to determine how the
attributions on the other dimension change as a consequence.
This could be done with children of different ages to verify
the age pattern observed here.
Conclusion
Previous research exploring children's anti-fat biases has
mostly focused on the valence of the attitude. The results of
the current study show that although children hold a negative
attitude toward their overweight peers, the associated stereo-
type content is ambivalent, and positive and negative beliefs
co-exist. Especially in children around 10 years of age, the
fact that overweight targets are penalized in one dimension
(i.e., competence) but are compensated in the other (i.e.,
warmth), in addition to the results concerning social desir-
ability, highlights children's ability as social perceivers.

Notes
1. Children's body size perceptions were also assessed as a
supplementary control measure. The children were asked to
choose which child they most looked like from the six figures.
The results showed that the participants always chose a same-
gender figure, typically the average-weight figure; namely,
male participants: first grade 79.2%, third grade 83.3%, and
fifth grade 76%; female participants: first grade, 80.8%, third
grade 76%, and fifth grade 85.7%.
2. All tests of simple effects used the Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons.
3. For simplicity, the participants' and targets' genders were not
entered in the ANOVA reported in the text because the initial
analyses showed no relevant effects on the warmth and com-
petence dimensions.
4. The traits have been extensively and cross-culturally pre-tested
(e.g., Cuddy et al., 2009; Durante et al., 2013; Fiske, Cuddy,
Glick, & Xu, 2002) to reflect the dimensions of warmth and
competence.
