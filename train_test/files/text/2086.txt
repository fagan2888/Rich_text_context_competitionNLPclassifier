Comparison of Trends for Adolescent Smoking
and Smoking in Movies, 1990-2007
To the Editor: The National Cancer Institute reported that
"the total weight of evidence from cross-sectional, longitu-
dinal, and experimental studies indicates a causal relation-
ship between exposure to depictions of smoking in movies
and youth smoking initiation."1 Attributable risk estimates
suggest that movie smoking accounts for one-third to one-
half of adolescent smoking onset,2,3 raising the possibility
that trends in movie smoking could influence trends in ado-
lescent smoking. We compared current (past 30-day) smok-
ing among US eighth-grade adolescents with smoking in
popular movies.
Methods. Each year from 1990 to 2007, the 25 movies
with highest US box-office gross revenues4 were content
coded for tobacco use by 2 coders. Only tobacco use was
coded (90% was cigarette or cigar smoking). A smoking
occurrence was counted whenever a movie character handled
or used tobacco or when tobacco use was depicted in the
background. A 10% subsample of movies was double-
coded (interrater correlation=0.96 for this outcome).
Current smoking was obtained from the Monitoring the
Future survey,5 which has assessed smoking among US eighth
graders since 1991, with a study sample that ranged from
15 100 to 18 600 and a response rate greater than 80% for
each year during the study period. Smoking among eighth
graders was chosen because most studies linking movies with
adolescent smoking involve teens in this age group.

9.0 (StataCorp, College Station, Texas). The slope estimates
from each regression with 2-sided 95% CIs are reported.
Results. The FIGURE illustrates parallel downward trends
formoviesmokingandadolescentsmokingafter1996.Geo-
metric mean for movie smoking was 3.5 occurrences (95%
CI, 1.8-6.9) in 1990 and 0.23 (95% CI, 0.06-0.93) in 2007.
The narrowing of the CIs for movie smoking reflected a de-
cline in the variability over time, due in part to a significant
increase in the percentage of movies without any smoking
(TABLE). Trend analysis indicated that geometric mean for
movie smoking declined by an average of 0.84 smoking oc-
currences (95% CI, 0.80-0.89) per year between 1990 and
2007. Smoking among eighth graders increased in the early
1990sandthendeclinedfromapeakof21.0%(95%CI,19.6%-
22.4%)in1996to7.1%(95%CI,6.2%-8.0%)in2007.Trend
analysis indicated that current smoking declined by an av-
erage of 1.3 percentage points (95% CI, 1.2-1.4) each year
after 1996.
Comment. There has been a significant decline in both
movie smoking in top US box-office hits and annual assess-
ments of smoking among US eighth graders since 1996. These
trends are consistent with a causal hypothesis and reported
attributable risk figures. During the first 6 years of the pe-
riod, movie smoking declined but youth smoking in-
creased. This could be the result of a lagged effect for the
relation between newly released movie smoking and ado-
lescent current smoking, a possibility we could not assess
because our data on movie smoking only go back to 1989.
Additionally, movie smoking represents only one of several
factors that contribute to youth smoking trends, including
the marketing of tobacco, price of cigarettes, restrictions im-
posed by the Master Settlement Agreement in 1999, and state
tobacco prevention programs. The main limitation of this
study is that it is an ecological analysis and can only dem-
onstrate association. Nonetheless, the downward trend in
movie smoking is consistent with an influence on down-
ward trends in adolescent smoking.

Firearm Use in G- and PG-Rated Movies,
2003-2007
To the Editor: In 2005, 1453 firearm deaths occurred among
children in the United States, accounting for 8.2% of deaths
among persons aged 1 to 17 years.1 Mass media have been
reported to influence children's behavior toward violence.2
From 1995 to 2002, 34% of the G- and PG-rated movies with
the highest US box-office gross revenues depicted use of fire-
arms.3,4 We examined movies released during 2003 through
2007 to determine whether depiction of firearms in movies
marketed for children had changed.
Methods. The study used the original protocol from the
1995-1997 study.5 We identified the 25 G- or PG-rated mov-
ies for 2003-2007 with the highest annual domestic box-
office gross revenues for a total sample size of 125 movies.6
Movies or scenes were excluded if they were animated, were
not set in the present day (within 10 years of a movie's re-
lease), or were documentaries. The coding unit was person-
scene, defined as a scene in which 1 person was involved in
an activity with a firearm. Possession or handling of fire-
arms was recorded only for characters with speaking roles.
Standardized data-collection forms were used, and movies
were watched in DVD format. Each movie was viewed si-
multaneously by 1 of 2 pairs of reviewers. A pilot was con-
ducted to ensure consistency and interrater reliability. Com-
parisons between previous studies and 2003-2007 data were
analyzed by 2-sided 2 test for trend using EpiInfo version
6 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, Geor-
gia) and Wilcoxon rank sum test using SAS version 9.1 (SAS
Institute, Cary, North Carolina). Clustering of person-
scenes within movies was controlled for using SAS version
9.1; because this had minimal effect, unadjusted results are
presented. Differences were considered significant if P.05.
Results. Of 125 movies, 67 (54%) met the inclusion cri-
teria for the study with 5 G-rated movies (7%) and 62 PG-
rated (93%). Eighteen movies (27%) depicted characters with
firearms (TABLE). One hundred six person-scenes depicted
characters with firearms, with a median of 4.5 person-
scenes per movie (range, 1-22). Median (interquartile range)
numbers of person-scenes per movie were 2 (1-8.2), 3 (1-
11), and 4.5 (2-8.8) for 1995-1997, 1998-2002, and 2003-
2007, respectively (P=.92). Two movies accounted for 37%
of the person-scenes with firearms.
Of characters with firearms, 105 (99%) were adults and
1 (1%) was a child; 95 (90%) were male. Fifty-six charac-
ters (53%) with firearms were involved in law enforcement
(eg, police officers or security guards); 38 (36%) were crimi-
nals; and 12 (11%) were other characters (eg, homeown-
ers). Seventy-two person-scenes (68%) depicted charac-
ters handling firearms, and 56 person-scenes (53%) depicted
characters making a threatening gesture with a firearm.
