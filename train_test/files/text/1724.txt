Abstract
Background: The number of international medical graduates (IMGs) entering family medicine in the
United States of America has steadily increased since 1997. Previous research has examined practice
locations of these IMGs and their role in providing care to underserved populations. To our knowledge,
research does not exist comparing professional profiles, credentials and attitudes among IMG and United
States medical graduate (USMG) family physicians in the United States. The objective of this study is to
determine, at the time when a large influx of IMGs into family medicine began, whether differences existed
between USMG and IMG family physicians in regard to personal and professional characteristics and
attitudes that may have implications for the health care system resulting from the increasing numbers of
IMGs in family medicine in the United States.
Methods: This is a secondary data analysis of the 1996­1997 Community Tracking Study (CTS) Physician
Survey comparing 2360 United States medical graduates and 366 international medical graduates who
were nonfederal allopathic or osteopathic family physicians providing direct patient care for at least 20
hours per week.
Results: Compared to USMGs, IMGs were older (p < 0.001) and practised in smaller (p = 0.0072) and
younger practices (p < 0.001). Significantly more IMGs practised in metropolitan areas versus rural areas
(p = 0.0454). More IMG practices were open to all new Medicaid (p = 0.018) and Medicare (p = 0.0451)
patients, and a greater percentage of their revenue was derived from these patients (p = 0.0020 and p =
0.0310). Fewer IMGs were board-certified (p < 0.001). More IMGs were dissatisfied with their overall
careers (p = 0.0190). IMGs and USMGs did not differ in terms of self-rated ability to deliver high-quality
care to their patients (p = 0.4626). For several of the clinical vignettes, IMGs were more likely to order
tests, refer patients to specialists or require office visits than USMGs.
Conclusion: There are significant differences between IMG and USMG family physicians' professional
profiles and attitudes. These differences from 1997 merit further exploration and possible follow-up, given
the increased proportion of family physicians who are IMGs in the United States.

Background
International Medical Graduates (IMGs) comprised
20.8% of the family physician workforce in 1995 [1]. In
2003, this number increased to 22.1% and is expected to
continue to rise, given the large increase of IMGs entering
family medicine residency programmes [1].
Historically, family medicine has a smaller proportion of
IMGs entering residency training than other primary-care
specialties. This relationship is changing as IMGs increas-
ingly filled family medicine residency positions not
selected by United States Medical Graduates (USMGs),
particularly those vacant after the annual Match [2].
In the 2005 Match, 36.5% of PGY-1 positions available in
family medicine residencies were filled by IMGs, an
increase of 97 positions from the previous year [3]. On 1
July 2005, IMGs comprised 39.6% of first-year family
medicine residents, compared to 14.7% in 1998 [3]. This
rise is unique to family medicine, as the number of IMGs
entering other primary-care fields has remained relatively
stable over the past eight years [4].
Earlier research documented that certain residency pro-
grammes have become "dependent" on IMGs, who
occupy most or all of their positions [2,5]. It is possible
that differences in training backgrounds may translate to
important differences in the practice of medicine relating
to issues such as health care costs and access to care. As the
United States relies heavily on family physicians to serve a
large portion of its population [6], it is important to con-
sider what, if anything, this influx of IMGs might portend
for the future of the specialty and health care in the
nation.
IMG's geographical and specialty distributions, their con-
tribution to meeting the needs of the medically unders-
erved, and the value of Conrad-20 and other visa-waiver
programmes that integrate them into the United States
physician workforce have been examined in past studies
[7-10]. A few studies have focused on IMGs performance
at the residency training level and their post-training med-
ical practices [11-13]. Although several of these studies
evaluate IMGs in primary-care specialties, none of them
focus solely on the field of family medicine. Previous
research has neither described the attributes and influ-
ences of IMG medical practices nor characterized IMGs'
professional credentials and attitudes beyond the resi-
dency level in family medicine.
In this paper we examine personal, professional and prac-
tice characteristics and attitudes of IMG and USMG family
physicians in order to provide insight into practice differ-
ences that may affect the health care system. We use data
from a nationally representative survey collected in 1996­
1997, a time when major increases in the proportion of
IMGs in family medicine residency training began, to
answer the question: "Do significant differences exist
between IMG and USMG family physicians that warrant
further investigation?"
We compare physician-reported personal, professional
and practice characteristics, attitudes regarding clinical
care, assessments of various influences on the delivery of
medical care, referral patterns and responses to clinical
vignettes between the two groups. Beyond forming a base-
line comparison and characterization for future analyses,
this analysis highlights findings that may have implica-
tions for the health care system as a whole resulting from
the increasing numbers of IMGs in family medicine in the
United States.
Methods
Data sources
Data used in this study were collected through the Com-
munity Tracking Study (CTS) Physician Survey, a project
of the Center for Studying Health System Change, in
Washington, DC, and obtained from the Inter-University
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR), in
Ann Arbor, Michigan [14]. The CTS is a biannual survey
sponsored by the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation to
study changes in the health care system and their impact
on individuals. The sample frame consisted of nonfederal
MDs and DOs who provided direct patient care for at least
20 hours per week.
The 1996­1997 CTS is the most recent source of a nation-
ally representative sample containing special provisions
to examine practice characteristics and tendencies in addi-
tion to the responses to 12 clinical vignettes. Primary-care
physicians were oversampled, and of the 2726 family phy-
sicians who participated, 2360 were USMGs and 366 were
IMGs. Residents and fellows were not surveyed. The over-
all response rate was 65% and the response number to
each individual item is listed in each table. The CTS does
not identify the specific response rates between IMG and
USMG participants.
Study variables
We compared responses to survey items between IMG and
USMG family physicians. The CTS defined International
Medical Graduates as graduates of medical schools out-
side the United States, Canada and Puerto Rico. The CTS
also included the responses from general practitioners in
the family physician group.
We examined several survey items relating to personal and
professional characteristics including age, years in prac-
tice, net income and board-certification status. We
assessed various practice characteristics including practice

location (large metro, small metro, non-metro as defined
by the 1995 United States Census), practice type (solo or
two physicians, group practice, health maintenance
organization (HMO), hospital-based, medical school,
other), net income and percentages of income from vari-
ous sources (Medicare, Medicaid, HMO, bonuses). We
also compared the number of new Medicare and Medicaid
patients each physician was accepting into his or her prac-
tice.
The survey items queried physicians' agreement with
statements regarding clinical care using a five-point Likert
scale ("disagree strongly", "disagree somewhat", "neither
agree nor disagree"," agree somewhat", or "agree
strongly"). There were few "neither agree nor disagree"
responses. In order to compare each group, we eliminated
the category and collapsed the remaining groups into two
response groups: "agree" or "disagree", as has been done
with analysis of these data in other research [15].
The physicians were similarly asked about career satisfac-
tion ("Thinking very generally about your overall career in
medicine, would you say that you are currently very satis-
fied, somewhat satisfied, somewhat dissatisfied, very dis-
satisfied, or neither satisfied or dissatisfied?"). These
responses were collapsed to "dissatisfied" or "satisfied"
for our analysis.
We compared survey items that assessed various influ-
ences on the physicians' practice of medicine. These items
include the effects of using computers to obtain patient
data and treatment guidelines, using preventive treatment
reminders and formal written guidelines, and the effects
of practice profile results and patient satisfaction surveys.
In order to compare referral patterns among physicians,
we analysed responses to survey items regarding the
number of patients the physicians referred to specialists,
the complexity of the medical conditions of those patients
they did not refer to specialists, and the complexity of
medical conditions the physicians felt specialists expected
them to care for without referral. These survey items asked
each physician to state whether each item had "decreased
a lot", "decreased a little", "stayed the same", "increased a
little", or "increased a lot" over the previous two years.
The 1996­1997 CTS contained 12 clinical vignettes that
queried physicians about medications, tests and referrals
they would order for various clinical scenarios.
Analytic strategy
USMG and IMG practice characteristics, professional atti-
tudes and satisfaction were contrasted by means of chi-
square and t-tests. SUDAAN software, version 8.0
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park,
North Carolina, United States of America) was used for
statistical comparisons and making national estimates.
SUDAAN adjusted variance due to non-response and CTS
survey design complexities. Statistical significance was set
at p-values less than 0.05.
Results
Of the 2726 family physicians surveyed, 2360 were
USMGs and 366 were IMGs. We found that IMGs were
older than USMGs, but significantly more likely to have
been in practice for fewer years (Table 1). IMGs were more
likely to practise in metropolitan areas than in non-met-
ropolitan areas, with 82% of IMGs in metropolitan areas
compared to 75% of USMGs (p = 0.0454). A greater per-
centage of IMGs were full owners of their practices and
more often in solo or two-physician groups. Only 67% of
IMGs were board-certified, compared to 87% of USMGs
(p < 0.001). More IMGs were accepting all new Medicare
(67% versus 60%, p = 0.0451) and Medicaid (49% versus
40%, p = 0.0018) patients than USMGs. They also derived
a greater percentage of their revenue from Medicare and
Medicaid than their USMG counterparts. IMGs served as
"gatekeepers" and were required to provide permission to
see specialists for a greater percentage of their patients
than USMGs. Differences between IMGs and USMGs
regarding net income, hours in direct patient care, per-
centage of revenue from managed care, and percentage of
income from bonuses were not significant (data not
shown).
IMGs were more likely to report having adequate time to
spend with patients (73% versus 66%, p = 0.0041) and
being able to develop continuing patient relationships
(83% versus 78%, p = 0.0096) than USMGs, yet more
IMGs were dissatisfied with their overall medical careers
(20% versus 16%, p = 0.0190) than USMGs (Table 2).
There were no significant differences between IMGs and
USMGs regarding perceived ability or freedom to provide
high-quality care, to communicate with specialists and to
make clinical decisions without reducing income. IMGs
reported that preventive treatment reminders, formal
written guidelines and patient satisfaction surveys had
more influences on their practice of medicine than
USMGs (data not shown).
There were no significant differences between IMGs and
USMGs on the effects of using computers on obtaining
patient data and treatment guidelines and the effects of
practice profile results (data not shown). Small but signif-
icant differences existed between IMGs and USMGs with
regard to referral patterns, but no meaningful trends were
identified (data not shown).

The responses to the 12 clinical vignettes are listed in
Table 3. For many clinical scenarios, IMGs were more
likely to order tests, refer patients to specialists or require
office visits than USMGs.
Discussion
This study suggests that IMGs and USMGs who practise
family medicine differ in important ways. Professionally,
fewer IMGs are board-certified, compared to USMGs.
Their practices differ from those of USMGs in terms of
practice location and service of the Medicare and Medic-
aid populations. Significantly fewer IMGs report being
satisfied overall with their medical careers than USMGs.
Furthermore, subtle differences exist between the groups
in regards to patient referral patterns and in their
responses to several clinical vignettes. These differences, if
they continue to exist, may affect important aspects of the
health care system, particularly access to care and health
care use and costs.
Fewer IMGs are board-certified than USMGs
The CTS survey data do not allow us to ascertain the etiol-
ogy of this profound difference. Prerequisites for becom-
ing board-certified in family medicine include unlimited
licensure to practise medicine, completion of a three-year
residency programme in family medicine, with the last
two years being at the same location, and a passing score
on the American Board of Family Practice Board Certifica-
tion Exam.
Physicians surveyed in this study were practising medicine
prior to the implementation of the Clinical Skills Assess-
ment (CSA) requirement for IMGs to enter United States
residency programmes. This requirement was imple-
mented by the Educational Commission for Foreign Med-
ical Graduates (ECFMG) in July 1998 to evaluate IMGs'
clinical and communication skills [16]. Since the imple-
mentation of the CSA, the United States Medical Licensing
Exam (USMLE) Step 1 and 2 passage rates of IMGs receiv-
ing ECFMG certification have increased. We may also see
increases in the percentage of board-certified IMG family
physicians in the future with this new requirement.
It is uncertain how board certification and exam-passing
rates correlate to quality outcomes in clinical practice. An
extensive literature review performed in 1997 revealed
that insufficient evidence existed to support or refute the
use of board certification as a proxy for physician quality
[12]. More recent studies suggest that board certification
and maintenance of certification may be linked to
improved clinical outcomes [17]. Furthermore, the public
places a high value on board certification and would
potentially change behaviour to ensure their physician is
board-certified[17]. The difference between IMGs' and

USMGs' board certification status is important, as more
emphasis is being placed on this credential. It is also
important to address the proposed link between board-
certification status and physician quality in future studies.
Significantly more IMG family physicians are practising in
more urban areas as opposed to rural areas
Previous studies found that IMGs comprise a larger por-
tion of the primary-care physician workforce in rural areas
with physician shortages than USMGs, but these studies
lumped primary care as a single workforce [9,10]. Our
study and another national study both reveal that IMGs in
family medicine, the primary-care specialty most likely to
distribute like the United States population, are less likely
to practise in rural areas than USMGs [8].
Although a greater percentage of new physicians entering
Health Professional Shortage Areas (HPSAs) are IMGs, the
majority of these physicians are temporary visa holders
[18]. It is uncertain if this commitment to the underserved
is long-term. Furthermore, previous research has revealed
that IMGs are more likely to practise in markets with
higher concentrations of established IMG physicians [19].
If this trend continues, one may expect IMGs to continue
to locate in urban versus rural practices.
The CTS physician survey did not identify HPSAs or visa
status, so we were unable to assess the relative placement
of IMGs and USMG family physicians in regard to treating
the underserved, or their long-term commitment to serv-
ing these areas. Additionally, the CTS data do not allow us
to perform a more refined analysis of exactly where in
urban areas these physicians are located, as other studies
looking at IMGs of all specialties have done [7,20].
More IMG practices are open to all new Medicaid and
Medicare patients, and a greater percentage of their
revenue is derived from these patients
This trend has also been established in comparing IMGs
and USMGs in psychiatry [21]. The greater service of
Medicare and Medicaid populations by IMG family physi-
cians suggests they have a greater dependence on publicly
financed programmes and that they plan an important
role in providing access to care for Americans covered by
these federal programmes.
More IMGs are dissatisfied with their overall medical
careers
Previous studies have linked career dissatisfaction with a
perceived inability to provide high-quality care [15].
Although more IMGs in this study are dissatisfied than
USMGs, they report no less ability to deliver high-quality
care to their patients. Furthermore, more IMGs report hav-

ing adequate time and ability to develop continuing rela-
tionships with their patients than their USMG colleagues.
Given the link between career satisfaction and quality of
care, it is important to consider what potentially increas-
ing the percentage of dissatisfied physicians means for the
future of family medicine and the patients they serve.
While it is beyond the scope of this study, it is important
to further examine this difference in order to discern
potential etiologies and solutions to improve physician
satisfaction.
In reviewing the clinical vignettes, we noted several situa-
tions in which IMGs order more tests, refer more patients
or require more office visits than USMGs. These differ-
ences were statistically significant for half of the vignettes,
but it is uncertain whether this reflects appropriate care or
if the differences were clinically significant. To our knowl-
edge, no research has been published examining the refer-
ral patterns and service use practices of IMGs and USMG
physicians in the United States. This area deserves further
examination, as there may be important health care cost
and utilization effects to consider if differences between
the groups do exist.
As previously stated, it is important to note that there are
no significant differences between IMGs and USMGs
regarding their self-rated ability to deliver high quality
care to their patients. A greater percentage of IMGs feel
that they have adequate time to spend with their patients
and that they are able to develop continuing relationships
with them.
There are several limitations to our study. The cross-sec-
tional nature of this study precludes our ability to demon-
strate causal relationships between variables in addition
to the potential for selection effects and the inability to
assess possible maturation effects. Reporting error and
recall bias are always potentials when examining survey
data. Furthermore, the data in this study are subjective
reports given by physicians themselves, as opposed to
objective practice analyses and clinical outcomes.
We are also unable to differentiate between IMGs who
were born in the United States and those who were for-
eign-born. Since United States-born IMGs and "Fifth Path-
way" students account for increasing numbers of PGY-1
family practice residents [3], it would be important to
determine whether differences exist between this group
and their foreign-born counterparts.
The linkage of general practitioners with family physicians
by the CTS may affect some of the results of this paper.
Although we know the participants were self-reported
family physicians or general practitioners, we do not
know the primary focus of their practices (traditional
practice, emergency physician, occupational medicine,
etc.).
In addition, the clinical vignettes were designed by the
CTS and their validity is untested. We include them
because they offer a unique viewpoint into clinical deci-
sion-making that is often not available in data sources.
Our data were collected in 1996 and 1997. This is the
most recent nationally representative data source that
oversampled primary-care physicians and examined the
specific clinical information we needed, including the
clinical vignettes. Although the CTS has collected physi-
cian survey data in subsequent years (1998­1999, 2000­
2001), neither of these data sets include the pertinent clin-
ical information provided in the vignettes of the 1996­
1997 data set. In addition, this time frame allows us to
obtain a snapshot of family practice physicians at the time
when USMG interest in family medicine was peaking and
the number of IMGs entering the field was poised to
increase, thereby providing a baseline with which to com-
pare more recent studies on this issue.
IMGs were just 13.4% of the CTS sample ­ less than their
percentage in the overall family medicine workforce. We
cannot know whether there was a disproportionately
lower response rate from IMGs or if IMGs were a smaller
proportion of the workforce within the sampled areas.
While this may affect external validity, we don't anticipate
that non-respondent IMGs would be more satisfied, or
less likely to serve Medicare and Medicaid patients. The
characteristics reported in this study may have changed
over the past nine years.
Conclusion
At a time when family medicine began a new trend of
becoming more populated with IMGs, we found impor-
tant differences between the professional and clinical
attributes and attitudes of IMG and USMG family physi-
cians that may affect the health care system. Unlike previ-
ous studies, the practice locations of the IMG family
physicians in this study were more urban than those of
their USMG peers. IMG family physicians tend to own
their practices more often, practise in smaller groups and
be more open to serving Medicare and Medicaid patients
than their United States-trained colleagues. The lower rate
of board certification among IMG physicians is important
to consider as more emphasis is being placed on this cre-
dential. There were small but significant differences in
career satisfaction and referral patterns that are worth
exploring both to understand whether they continue to be
true, and to understand if they may change the scope and
practice of family medicine. Given that the United States
relies on family physicians to serve a large portion of its
population and the persistent lack of interest in family
