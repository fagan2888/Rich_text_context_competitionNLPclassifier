Introduction
There is no doubt that the increase in life expectancy in
Nigeria from 47 in the 1990s to 52 today is largely from the
reduction in infant and under-5 mortality over the same
period. Cutler, Deaton, and Lleras-Muney (2006) argued that
falling mortality has also meant better health for the living, so
that people are also living better, healthier, and longer lives
than did their forebears. Their study noted that cross-country
evidence does not suggest economic growth will improve
health without deliberate public action. Akachi and Canning
(2010) argued that in addition to the direct welfare gains from
improved health, healthier workers tend to be more produc-
tive. Currie (2009) argued that health in childhood affects
human capital accumulation and health and labor market sta-
tus in adulthood. Apouey and Geoffard (2013) found housing
conditions, nutrition, and clothing to have large independent
effect on child general health. Past studies have found strong
association between mothers' educational attainment and
reduction in infant and child mortality (Caldwell, 1979;
Kabagenyi & Rutaremwa, 2013; Mosley & Chen, 1984).
Cutler etal. (2006) argued that there is a positive relationship
between income and health within countries: low-income
people live shorter lives than high-income people in a given
country. They suggested that health inequalities, also known
as gradients, are part of a wider pattern that relates mortality
to measures of socio-economic status. They called for further
studies on the decline in mortality over time, differences in
mortality across countries, and differences in mortality across
groups within countries.
Akachi and Canning (2010) argued that the decline in
infant mortality in sub-Saharan Africa may have resulted
from medical intervention measures and broad-based reduc-
tions in exposure to infectious diseases that prevent infant
deaths rather than improved nutrition and childhood morbid-
ity. Antai (2010) argued that the rich geographical, cultural,
ethnic, and socio-economic diversity of Nigeria implies that
immunization uptake varies between and within geographical
regions. The study further posits that these differences may
result in some segment of children not vaccinated and thus

Abstract
We analyze infant and under-5 mortality trends in Nigeria using data from the demographic and health surveys (DHS) of 2003
and 2008. We use pooled data to enable us carry out logistic regression analysis at the state level and allow for robustness
of our results. Our analysis shows wide disparities in both infant and under-5 mortality rates in the six geopolitical zones of
Nigeria and the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. Furthermore, the results show highly significant differences
in infant and under-5 mortality rates among the six geopolitical zones and among the 36 states of Nigeria. Our result shows
that urban advantage over rural areas in under-5 mortality rate only exist among the richest quintiles in Nigeria. We find
no evidence of statistically significant difference between the urban poorest and poorer quintiles and the rural poorest and
poorer quintiles in both infant and under-5 mortality in Nigeria. We find wealth, educational attainment of the mother, the
use of health facility, religion, gender of a child, and number of births in the last 3 years to be highly correlated with infant and
under-5 mortality in Nigeria. Both infant and under-5 mortality rates declined between 2003 and 2008 in Nigeria.

expose the rest of the population to major outbreaks of vac-
cine preventable diseases. United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF; 2009) reports that west and central Africa region
has the highest regional under-5 mortality rate in the world.
The report showed that under-5 mortality for west and central
Africa was 186 per 1,000 live births compared with 160 per
1,000 for sub-SaharanAfrica as a whole and 131 per 1,000 for
eastern and southern Africa. The literature on infant and child
mortality rate is robust for developed countries. Houweling
and Kunst (2010) noted that it is only recently that research in
inequalities is being studied more systematically in relation to
low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). One of the key
findings in The National Population Commission (NPC &
ICF Macro, 2009) study showed a wide disparity in under-5
mortality within Nigeria. The difference between the south-
west zone and north-east zone is 2.5 times, 89 deaths per
1,000 live births in south-west zone and 222 deaths per 1,000
live births in north-east zone. Adedini, Odimegwu, Imasiku,
Ononokpono, and Ibisomi (2013) argued that residence in a
particular region of Nigeria is a major determinant of infant
and child mortality in the country. Antai (2011) found that the
risk of under-5 deaths were almost twofold higher for chil-
dren of mothers residing in the north-east and south-south
regions compared with children of mothers in the south-west
region.
However, very few studies have focused on the regional
differences in Nigeria with specific emphasis on the role of
wealth and maternal educational attainment in explaining
disparities on infant and child mortality rate. This article,
therefore, helps to fill the void that currently exists in the
literature by using the demographic and health surveys
(DHS) data to examine the impact of wealth, education,
beliefs, and location on infant and child mortality rates in the
six geopolitical regions of Nigeria. It is evident from the rel-
evant literature above that there is a strong need for an empir-
ical investigation of the source of disparities in infant and
child mortality in Nigeria. In Nigeria, most of the decreases
in infant and child mortality occurred among the rich just as
most of the gains in infant and child mortality took place
among the rich developed countries of the world (UNICEF,
2012). Nigeria is one of the least successful countries in
Africa in achieving improvements in child survival over the
past four decades (Ngowu, Larson, & Kim, 2008). Several
public health policies have been under taken at various points
in Nigeria. However, the complex nature of the proximate
determinants of under-5 and infant mortality has made it dif-
ficult to ascertain the exact effectiveness of these policies.
Previous studies identified location as highly correlated
with both under-5 and infant mortality in sub-Saharan
Africa. The urban­rural difference in under-5 and infant
mortality has been documented in sub-Sahara Africa (SSA)
(Anyamele, 2009; Cai & Chongsuvivatwong, 2006; Cleland,
Bicego, & Fegan, 1992; Fotso, 2006; Knobel, Yang, & Ho,
1994; Kuate-Defo & Diallo, 2002; Lalou & LeGrand, 1997).
Given the diverse geographical and cultural nature of
Nigeria, we propose to study the differences in infant and
under-5 mortality among the six geopolitical zones as well
as the 36 states and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja.
Given the above backdrop, we test the hypothesis that dis-
parity in infant and under-5 mortality rates in the six geopo-
litical zones and the different states is correlated with
mothers' educational attainment, wealth, and location.
Understanding these differences if any will enable policy
makers and practitioners to design programs that will effec-
tively address the high levels of infant and under-5 mortality
rates that are prevalent in Nigeria. To achieve this, we use
pooled 2003 and 2008 DHS data for Nigeria. Pooling the
data gives us enough data points at the state level for the
robustness of the result and generalization from the results.
This study marks the first time that infant and under-5 mor-
tality has been studied at state level in Nigeria, thus contrib-
uting to our understanding of the differences in infant and
under-5 mortality in Nigeria. Past studies have found strong
association between poverty and infant and child mortality
(see Anyamele, 2011; Cleland et
al., 1992; Fotso, 2006;
Hong, 2006; McMichael, 2000; Todd, 1996; Victora, Bryce,
Fontaine, & Monasch, 2000; Victora etal., 2003; Wagstaff,
2000). Houweling and Kunst (2010) concluded that child
mortality is systematically and considerably higher among
lower socio-economic groups within countries.
Methods
The analyses were done on Stata 13.1 (2013). The complex
nature of the survey design of DHS data meant that we apply
the sampling weights to correct for the bias in probability
selection. Logistic regression analysis technique is used to
examine the effect of wealth quintiles, educational attain-
ment, geopolitical zones, states, the use of health facilities,
and urban and rural areas on the probability of infant and
child mortality in Nigeria. Using logistic regression tech-
nique, we are able to obtain the odds ratio of which group has
lower or higher odds of infant and child mortality in Nigeria.
The DHS data used in this study are the children's file data.
The model is given by a linear probability model (LPM)
measure of a household experiencing infant or child mortal-
ity. If the household has lost a child before or at the 59th
month, child mortality Y = 1, otherwise, Y = 0. If the house-
hold has lost a child before or at the 12th month, infant Y = 1,
otherwise, Y = 0.
Y = + + u,
 X (1)
Y is a binary variable that takes the values of 1 or 0. X is a
vector of independent variables, and  is the intercept term, 
is the vector of coefficients to be estimated while u is the
error term. The problem with the LPM is that the error terms
are heteroskedastic. Also, u is not normally distributed since
Y takes only two values of 1 or 0. The predicted probabilities
can be greater than 1 or less than 0. In light of the above
Anyamele et al. 3
problems of LPM, we see the logistic regression as adequate
for this study where the outcome variable takes the values of
1 or 0. Thus we can write the logistic equation to be esti-
mated as
Log P 1 P
i i
/ -
( ) = + +
 X u (2)
Logistic regression with multiple predictor variables is
well suited for this study. Each of the  coefficient estimated
is a measure of the expected change in the log odds of a
household experiencing infant or child mortality for a unit
increase in the corresponding predictor variable holding the
other predictor variables constant at certain value. The theo-
retical framework of our article is based on the work of
Mosley and Chen (1984) which suggested combining social
science and medical science approaches to study child sur-
vival in developing countries. We make no attempt to distin-
guish between proximate and distal variables in this study.
Data
The sample size for this study is 34,676 households from
2003 and 2008 DHS survey of Nigeria. Our data is made up
of 886 primary survey units (PSU). The rural population is
made up 71.9% (24,945/34,676) of the sample while 28.1%
(9,731/34,676) of the sample is from urban households. 2003
DHS data constitute 17.35% while 82.65% of the sample is
from the 2008 DHS data. The zonal composition of the data
shows that 17.48% (6,061/34,676) came from the north-
central region of Nigeria, 23.20% (8,046/34,676) came from
the north-east region, 28.17% (9,768/34,676) is from north-
west region, 8.58% (2,974/34,676) of the sample is from
south-east region, 11.21% (3,887/34,676) of the sample is
from the south-south region, and 11.36% (3,940/34,676) of
the sample is from the south-west region of Nigeria. This
study utilized 2003 and 2008 DHS pooled data of Nigeria.
DHS selected participants for the study through probability
sampling procedures. Pooling data from different surveys
requires that we account for the differences in survey years
and regions. This is achieved by creating a strata identifica-
tion using year and region as the stratification factor. DHS
selected participants for the study through probability sam-
pling procedures. It separated urban and rural strata to pro-
vide valid samples of urban and rural populations at the
national level.
The DHS surveys were conducted in single rounds with
two main survey instruments: household schedule and indi-
vidual questionnaire for women of reproductive age 15 to 49
years. Whereas the household schedule collects a list of
household members and basic household demographic infor-
mation and is used to select respondents who are eligible for
individual survey, the individual survey provides informa-
tion on household assets, reproductive histories, health, and
nutritional status of the women's young children.
The DHS surveys use the following assets and services in
constructing the wealth index. DHS wealth index is made up
of the following items: flooring, water supply, sanitation
facilities, electricity, radio, television, telephone, refrigera-
tor, vehicle, persons per sleeping room, ownership of agri-
cultural land, domestic servant, and some country-specific
items. Principal components analysis (PCA) is used for the
DHS wealth index. The DHS procedure uses SPSS factor
analysis method. First, the indicator variables are standard-
ized by calculating z-scores, then factor coefficient scores
are calculated for each household's index value. The result-
ing sum is itself a standardized score with a mean of zero and
a standard deviation of one.
Rutstein and Johnson (2004) argued that wealth as a mea-
sure of economic status has several advantages. It represents
a more permanent status than does either income or con-
sumption. A pooled model represents data on different coun-
tries pooled together without regard to differences that may
result in different coefficients. Houweling and Kunst (2010)
suggested future studies to examine the comparability of the
wealth indices, and to complement these by measures based
on educational level, ethnicity, geography, and other dimen-
sions of social position. Wooldridge (2013) stated that an
independently pooled cross section is obtained by sampling
randomly from a large population at different points in time,
usually, but not necessarily, different years. Ware (1984)
concluded that women who have been to school lose fewer
of their children in childhood and infancy than their
unschooled peers. Schultz (1984) concluded that empirical
study of the biological and behavioral determinants of child
survival may proceed in two directions: either to estimate the
reduced-form unconditional relationships between child sur-
vival and individual and community level variables that are
assumed to be exogenous to the many demographic, con-
sumer, and producer choices a household makes over time or
to estimate both the demand equations for health inputs and
the production function linking health inputs to child sur-
vival by simultaneous structural equation methods. Child
survival should be viewed as one among many endogenous
household variables that are modified by economic and
demographic choices (Schultz, 1984).
Description of Variables Used
The categorical and socio-economic and socio-demographic
variables used for the multivariate analysis are in Table 6:
mother's educational attainment (no education, primary, sec-
ondary, and higher), place of residence (urban/rural resi-
dence), wealth quintiles (poorest 20% is assigned the lowest
quintile and the richest 20% is assigned the highest quintile),
geopolitical regions or zones of six (north-central, north-
east, north-west, south-east, south-south, and south-west),
religion (Christians, Islam, Traditionalist, Other), child sex
(male or female), birth in the last 3 years, (less than or equal
to two births, or more than two births), birth order (less than
4 SAGE Open
or equal to four or more than four), place of residence (rural
or urban), and use of health facility (use or not use health
facility in the last 12 months).
Statistical Models
Table 6 is the multivariate logistic regression that shows the
odds ratio of infant and child mortality based on mother's
educational attainment, wealth quintiles, zonal place of resi-
dence, religion, child sex, number of births in the last 3 years,
birth order less than four, place of residence either rural or
urban, and use of health facility.
Model 1 is multivariate logistic regression of infant mor-
tality in Nigeria for 2003 and 2008 DHS data. Model 2 is also
multivariate logistic regression of infant mortality in Nigeria
for 2003 and 2008 DHS data. However, we test the effect of
place of residence for urban/rural on infant mortality in
Nigeria in Model 2. Model 3 is multivariate logistic regres-
sion of child mortality in Nigeria for 2003 and 2008 DHS
data. Model 6 is multivariate logistic regression of child
mortality in Nigeria with urban/rural place of residence as an
independent variable to account for differences in place of
residence for 2003 and 2008 DHS data.
Descriptive Statistics
Trends in Infant and Child Mortality in Nigeria
Figure 1 presents the change in infant mortality in the 36 states
of Nigeria and the Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja
between 2003 and 2008. Among the 36 state, 11 states and the
FCT Abuja saw an increase or no change in infant mortality
between 2003 and 2008. Infant mortality declined in 25 of the
36 states between 2003 and 2008. Figure 1 also shows that
Oyo State, Imo State, and FCT Abuja, with 118%, 116%, and
77% had the highest increase in infant mortality respectively
between 2003 and 2008. Among the 25 states where infant
mortality decreased, Nassarawa State, Ondo State, and Osun
State recorded the highest decrease in infant mortality (64%,
47%, and 45% respectively) between 2003 and 2008. Overall,
infant mortality decreased from 100.7 to 81.6 per 1,000 live
births or by 18.97% between 2003 and 2008 in Nigeria.
Figure 2 shows under-5 or child mortality in the 36 states
of Nigeria between 2003 and 2008. Child mortality increased
in 8 of the 36 states and in FCT Abuja between 2003 and
2008. Abia State, Imo State, and Anambra State had an
increase of 93.54%, 75%, and 33.76% respectively between
2003 and 2008. Child or under-5 mortality decreased in 28 of
the 36 states of Nigeria between 2003 and 2008. Among the
28 states that recorded decreases in child mortality,
Nassarawa State, Zamfara State, and Osun State saw declines
of 58.88%, 48.74%, and 46% respectively between 2003 and
2008. From 2003 to 2008, Nigeria recorded a decline of
19.93% in child mortality. Child mortality decreased from
139.5 to 111.7 per 1,000 live births during this period.Among
the 36 states, Zamfara State had the highest under-5 mortal-
ity rate of 230.8 per 1,000 live births in 2003, whereas Kwara
state had the lowest under-5 mortality rate of 34.1 per 1,000
live births in 2003.
Figure 3 presents the change in urban under-5 mortality
rates in the six geopolitical zones of Nigeria. From Figure 3
we see that south-west geopolitical zone had the highest
decline in child mortality. South-west zone recorded a
decline of approximately 30% in child mortality during this
period. South-south and north-west geopolitical zones each
recorded a decline of 21% in child mortality. North-east geo-
political zone saw a decline of 14% in child mortality
whereas south-east geopolitical zone had a decline of 11% in

child mortality. The only geopolitical zone that recorded an
increase in child or under-5 mortality in all the zones was the
north-central geopolitical zone. North-central geopolitical
zone had an increase of 14% in child or under-5 mortality
rate in her urban areas. Figure 4 is the change in child or
under-5 mortality in rural Nigeria among the six geopolitical
zones. Figure 4 shows south-east geopolitical zone as the
only geopolitical zone with increase in child mortality in the
rural areas of Nigeria. Among the other five geopolitical
zones where child or under-5 mortality decreased in the rural
areas, north-east geopolitical zone had the highest decrease.
North-east rural geopolitical zone recorded a decrease of
31%. South-south geopolitical zone was second in reducing
rural child mortality with a decrease of 29% between 2003
and 2008. North-central, north-west, and south-west geopo-
litical zones followed in child mortality reduction of 25%,
20% and 4% respectively.
Table 1 shows the distribution of risk of infant and child
mortality in the six regions of Nigeria. Table 1 shows the
proportion of wealth quintiles, mothers' education, number
of births in the last 3 years, religion, and other variables that
explain the disparities in infant and child mortality in Nigeria
in the six regions. Table 1 shows that among the poorest
wealth quintiles, the risk of infant and child mortality is
12.76 times higher (10.46/.82) in the north-east region com-
pared with the south-west region. However, among the rich-
est wealth quintiles, the risk of infant and child mortality is
(4.57/.70) is 6.53 times higher in the south-west region com-
pared with the north-east region of Nigeria.
Table 2 shows the distribution of the risk of infant mortal-
ity in the six regions of Nigeria. The risk of infant mortality
is (2.58/0.72) 3.58 times higher for the poorest wealth quin-
tiles compared with the richest wealth quintiles in Nigeria.
The risk of infant mortality between the poorest wealth quin-
tiles in the south-west region and the poorest wealth quintiles
in the north-east region shows a disparity of (4.75/.48) 9.9
times higher for the north-east region. Within the north-east
region, we see a very high degree of disparity between the
richest wealth quintile and the poorest wealth quintile. The
difference in risk of infant mortality is (4.75/.08) 59.4 times
higher for the poorest wealth quintile in north-east region.
Table 3 shows a similar pattern that we saw in both Tables
1 and 2. Wealth and education show a gradient in child mor-
tality in Nigeria. North-west region has the highest risk of
child mortality among mothers with no education. The risk
of child mortality is (11.24/1.19) 9.4 times higher for moth-
ers with no education in north-west compared with mothers
with no education in the south-west region of Nigeria. The
risk of child mortality is (9.21/2.45) 3.76 times higher in
rural Nigeria compared with urban Nigeria. Also, Table 3
shows that the risk of child mortality in Nigeria is (8.72/2.94)
2.97 times higher for those who did not use health facility
over the last 12 months compared with those who used it
over the same period. The distribution of risk of child mortal-
ity is almost consistent across the six regions for households
that made use of health facilities. However, the risk of child
mortality between the south-west region and south-east,
south-south, north-central, north-east, and north-west is 1.93
times, 2.16 times, 2.15 times, 2.73 times and 3.10 times
respectively.
Table 4 is the unweighted infant mortality in the 36 States
of Nigeria and Federal Capital Territory (FCT) Abuja. Table
4 shows the actual survey counts in both 2003 and 2008.
Table 4 also shows the mean mortality rate per 1,000 live
births in the two DHS surveys. We calculate the percentage
change in the rate of mortality for each state by the follow-
ing: [Mean mortality rate of 2008 - Mean mortality rate of
2003] / Mean mortality rate of 2003 × 100. For Under-5 or
child mortality, we applied the above method in Table 5. As
discussed elsewhere, the results are consistent with Figures 1
and 2.
Estimation Results
Table 6 shows the summary of the different logistic regres-
sions on infant and under-5 mortality rates in Nigeria. Model
1 is the pooled infant multivariate logistic regression. Model
1 shows an inverse relationship in infant mortality with pri-
mary, secondary, and higher educational attainment. However,
only higher education is significant in lowering the risk of
infant mortality. The richer and the richest wealth quintiles
show the risk of infant mortality falling. Compared with the
north-central geopolitical zone as the referent point, north-
east geopolitical zone has an odds ratio of 1.05. Basically, the
odds of experiencing infant mortality increase by 5% in
north-east geopolitical zone than in north-central geopolitical
zone. The odds of infant mortality increase by 2% in north-
west geopolitical zone than in north-central geopolitical zone.
The odds of child mortality increase by 15% in south-east
geopolitical zone than in north-central geopolitical zone. The
odds of infant mortality increase by 6% in south-south geopo-
litical zone compared with north-central geopolitical zone.
The odds of infant mortality decrease by 19.2% in south-west
geopolitical zone. This is the only geopolitical zone with
lower odds of infant mortality than north-central geopolitical
zone among the six geopolitical zones in Nigeria.

When we examine the effect of religion on infant mortality,
we see that those who practice traditional religion has odds of
1.11 times higher in infant mortality than those who practice
Christian religion in Nigeria. The odds of infant mortality for
those who practice Islam is 5.23% lower compared with those
who practice Christian religion. Although this result is not sig-
nificant, however, the odds of infant mortality is 1.75 times
higher for Other religions compared with Christian religion
and are statistically significant. Table 1 show that female chil-
dren have higher odds of surviving than male children in
Nigeria. The odds of infant mortality decrease by 13.75% for
female infant compared with male infant in Nigeria. The odds
of infant mortality increase by 5.1 times for mothers who had
more than two births in the last 3 years.
Higher birth order is positively associated with under-5
mortality in Nigeria. The odds of infant mortality decrease
by 83.67% for birth order lower than four. The odds of infant
mortality decrease by 12.65% for those who use health facil-
ity and the result is highly statistically significant.
Model 2 is the logistic regression of infant mortality in
Nigeria with place of residence as an explanatory variable.
The results are similar to the results in Model 1. From Table
6 we see that living in urban Nigeria results in lowering the
risk of infant mortality by 13.75%. When we examine infant
mortality in the six geopolitical zones with north-central as
the referent zone, we find a similar pattern as in Model 1.
Model 3 is the logistic regression for child mortality in
Nigeria. As evident in the result, educational attainment is
now significant at both secondary and higher level. The signs
performed as expected. Both the richer and richest wealth
quintiles are highly associated with reduction in under-5 mor-
tality in Nigeria. The odds of child mortality for the richest
wealth quintile decrease by 37.67% compared with the poor-
est wealth quintile. The odds of child mortality for the richer
wealth quintile decrease by 20.05% compared with the poor-
est wealth quintile. The odds of child mortality increased in
the six geopolitical regions with the exception of south-west
geopolitical region when compared with the north-central
Anyamele et al. 7
geopolitical zone. The odds of child mortality in the six zones
of north-east, north-west, south-east, and south-south
increased by 17.44%, 20.63%, 15.94%, and 12.49% com-
pared with north-central zone respectively. The odds of child
mortality in south-west geopolitical zone decrease by 21.10%
compared with north-central geopolitical zone. On religion,
we find the odds of child mortality in Nigeria increase by
22.79% for traditional religion compared with Christian reli-
gion. The odds of child mortality in Nigeria increase by
79.74% for Other religion. The odds of child mortality in
Nigeria decrease by 2.81% for Islam compared with Christian
religion.
The variable representing lower than or equal to two
births in the last 3 years is highly inversely associated with
decrease in under-5 mortality rate in Nigeria. The odds of
child mortality in Nigeria decrease by 80.71%. Birth order
lower or equal to four decreases child mortality in Nigeria
and is highly significant. The odds of child mortality in
Nigeria for female child falls by 11.72% compared with a
male child in Nigeria. The variable for health use is signifi-
cant in explaining child mortality in Nigeria.
Model 4 is the logistic regression of child mortality in
Nigeria with place of residence included as an explanatory
variable. Educational attainment is highly significant in
reducing child mortality at secondary and higher levels. The
odds of child mortality in Nigeria decrease by 2.26%,
15.83%, and 39.22% for mothers with primary, secondary
and higher education respectively compared with mothers
with no education. The wealth variable is highly significant
for the richest quintile and barely significant for the richer

quintile. Among the six geopolitical zones, only south-south
geopolitical zone is not significant compared with the north-
central zone. Although the south-east is barely significant at
10% level of significance, the north-east and north-west
zones have higher odds of child mortality compared with the
north-central zone and are statistically significant. Only the
south-west zone has a lower odds of child mortality com-
pared with the north-central zone in Nigeria. On religion, we
see a similar pattern with the results of Model 3. Again, simi-
lar to the result on infant mortality with place of residence in
Model 2, we find the odds of child mortality in urban Nigeria
to be 15.34% lower compared with child mortality in rural
Nigeria.
Discussion
This study showed that both infant and child mortality was
significantly associated with region of residence in Nigeria.
The risk of infant mortality is significantly higher for moth-
ers in north-east and north-west regions of Nigeria after
adjusting for wealth and mothers' education compared with
mothers in south-west and north-central regions of Nigeria.
This result is similar to the findings of Antai (2011). The
results in Table 6 Models 1 to 4 seem to confirm the high
proportions in Table 1 of mothers with no education and pri-
mary education in the three northern regions compared with
the three southern regions of Nigeria.

Table 1 also shows a high proportion of the poorest and
poorer wealth quintiles resident in the northern regions of
Nigeria compared with the proportion that is resident in the
southern regions of the country. Higher proportions of the
richer and richest wealth quintiles are resident in the south-
ern regions of Nigeria compared with the proportion resident
in the northern regions of Nigeria. The findings in this study
indicate that the south-west region has the lowest infant and
child mortality in Nigeria. Obviously, this is an indication of
the fact that more health facilities, social amenities, and edu-
cational institutions are available in the south-west region
than in any other region of Nigeria.
These facilities provide an enabling environment that
reduces the risk of infant and child mortality. Table 1 shows
that 70.45% did not make use of health facility, and only
29.55% used health facility in Nigeria. However, compared
with Nigeria, the proportion in the south-west region who
did not use health facility to those that used it is almost the
same, with those who used it 5.76% slightly higher than
those who did not use it (5.60%). The two other southern
regions of Nigeria, south-east and south-south regions, show
a smaller difference between those who used health facility
and those who did not use it. In the south-east region, the
proportion who used health facility is 2.95% compared with

5.63% who did not use health facility. In the south-south
region, the proportion is 4.18% who used it compared with
7.03% who did not use health facility.
In north-central region, the proportion that used health
facility is 5.60% compared with 11.88% who did not use
health facility. In the north-east region, the proportion that
used health facility is 5.80% compared with 17.41% who did
not use health facility. In the north-west region, the propor-
tion that used health facility is 5.27% compared with 22.90%
who did not use health facility. The proportion of mothers
having two or more births in the last 3 years is higher in the
northern regions of Nigeria than in the southern regions of
Nigeria. The above findings are consistent with the conclu-
sions reached by Adedini etal. (2013).
The results from multivariate logistic regressions of Table 6
show that mothers with higher level of educational attain-
ment has lower odds of infant mortality and it is statistically
significant. For child mortality, the odds are even better.
Mothers with both secondary and higher levels of educa-
tional attainment have lower odds of child mortality in
Nigeria and these results are statistically significant at both
5% and 1% level respectively. This finding gives credence to

previous studies (Anyamele, 2011; Caldwell, 1979;
Kabagenyi & Rutaremwa, 2013; Mosley & Chen, 1984).
Table 6 shows that household wealth is statistically signifi-
cant at both richer and richest wealth quintiles in reducing
infant mortality as evident on both Model 1 and Model 2
respectively. Models 3 and 4 on Table 6 show that richer and
richest wealth households in Nigeria have lower odds of child
mortality. These results are similar to the findings of past stud-
ies (Anyamele, 2011; Fotso, 2006; Hong, 2006; Houweling &
Kunst, 2010; McMichael, 2000; Todd, 1996; Victora etal.,
2000; Victora etal., 2003; Wagstaff, 2000). The multivariate
logistic regressions of Table 6 on Model 1 show that geo-
graphical place of residence is only statistically significant in
reducing infant mortality in the south-west region of Nigeria.
Furthermore, this result is similar to the result of Model 2 that
used urban/rural residence as an explanatory variable. Models
3 and 4 show that north-east and north-west has higher odds of
child mortality in Nigeria.Also, Model 4 shows that the south-
east region has higher odds of child mortality and it is statisti-
cally significant only at 10% level of significance. Again, the
results from both Models 3 and 4 show that the south-west
region has lower odds of child mortality in Nigeria. From
Model 4 we see that households that live in urban areas have
lower odds of child mortality than households that live in rural
areas of Nigeria. This is also the result on infant mortality in
Model 1 from Table 6. These results are similar to previous
findings on rural/urban residence (Anyamele, 2009; Cai &
Chongsuvivatwong, 2006; Fotso, 2006; Kuate-Defo & Diallo,
2002). The limitation of this study comes from not being able
to include the 2013 DHS data.
Conclusion and Policy Implications
This study has established strong disparity in infant and
under-5 mortality rates between the six geopolitical zones of
Nigeria and in the 36 states. Furthermore, our findings show
that urban Nigeria continues to have advantage over rural
Nigeria in infant and under-5 mortality rates. Educational
attainment, wealth, the use of health facility, and religion
appear to be strongly associated with both infant and under-5
mortality rates in Nigeria.
Some of these findings are in agreement with previous
studies on the topic (Adedini et
al., 2013; Antai, 2011;
Anyamele, 2009, 2011; Ettarh & Kimani, 2012; Houweling
& Kunst, 2010; Van de Poel, O'Donnell, & Doorsaer, 2009).
The policy implications of these findings are that policies and
programs should be implemented to target poverty alleviation
in both rural and urban areas of Nigeria. It is also evident
from our results that increasing educational attainment and
literacy levels in all the states will greatly reduce infant and
under-5 mortality rates in Nigeria. It is obvious from our
results that Nigeria continues to have high infant and under-5
mortality rates. This finding gives credence to previous work
by (Ngowu etal., 2008). However, the trends show a steady
decline in both infant and under-5 mortality rates in Nigeria.
The intervention measures in infant and children immuni-
zation of 2003 in most of the north-west and north-east geo-
political zones seem to have helped in the reduction of infant
and under-5 mortality rates in the two zones. Such efforts
should continue in all the zones of Nigeria.
