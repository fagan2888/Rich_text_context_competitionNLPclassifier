Research
Cadmium is a toxic and carcinogenic metal
widely distributed in the environment [Agency
for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry
(ATSDR) 1999; International Agency for
Research on Cancer (IARC) 1993; Nordberg
et al. 2007). In the general population, the pri-
mary sources of cadmium exposure are ciga-
rette smoke, food intake (shellfish, offal,
certain vegetables), and ambient air particu-
larly in urban areas and in the vicinity of
industrial settings. Cadmium exposure induces
hypertension in animal models (Satarug et al.
2006; Schroeder and Vinton 1962). In occu-
pationally and environmentally exposed popu-
lations, cadmium is nephrotoxic, inducing
tubular and glomerular dysfunction (Åkesson
et al. 2005; ATSDR 1999; Jin et al. 2004).
Epidemiologic studies of the association of
environmental cadmium exposure with blood
pressure end points are inconsistent. Although
some studies found positive associations
(McKenzie and Kay 1973; Pizent et al. 2001;
Vivoli et al. 1989; Whittemore et al. 1991),
other studies found null or even inverse associ-
ations (Beevers et al. 1976; Kagamimori et al.
1986; Staessen et al. 1984, 1991). Some epi-
demiologic studies have several strengths
including prospective designs (Staessen et al.
2000); many studies, however, have been lim-
ited by small sample sizes, lack of adjustment
for potential confounders, lack of standardiza-
tion of blood pressure measurements, or other
methodologic limitations.
The objective of our study was to investi-
gate the association of blood and urine cad-
mium levels with blood pressure levels and with
the prevalence of hypertension in a representa-
tive sample of U.S. adults who participated in
the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES). Urine and
blood cadmium are biomarkers of ongoing and
long-term cadmium exposure. The biological
half-life of cadmium is very long (15­30 years),
and it progressively accumulates in the kidneys
and other organs (ATSDR 1999; Nordberg
et al. 2007). Urine cadmium is considered the
biomarker of choice to assess chronic exposure
because cadmium in urine more readily reflects
cadmium concentrations in the renal cortex
(ATSDR 1999; Nordberg et al. 2007). Blood
cadmium also reflects long-term exposure, but
it is more influenced by recent exposure
(ATSDR 1999; Elinder et al. 1988; Jarup et al.
1983; Nordberg et al. 2007).
Methods
Study population. NHANES 1999­2004, con-
ducted by the U.S. National Center for Health
Statistics [NCHS; Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, GA], used a
complex multistage sampling design to obtain a
representative sample of the civilian noninstitu-
tionalized U.S. population. For the present
analysis we used data from 15,332 adults  20
years of age who participated in the NHANES
1999­2004 interviews and physical examina-
tions. The overall participation rate was 70.3%
(NCHS 2007a). We further excluded 833
pregnant women, 1,719 participants missing
blood cadmium, 582 participants missing
blood pressure measurements, 100 participants
with diastolic blood pressure levels equal to
zero, and 1,107 participants missing other vari-
ables of interest, leaving 10,991 eligible partici-
pants for analyses based on blood cadmium.
NHANES 1999­2004 measured urine metals
in a third random sample of the study popula-
tion, leaving 3,496 participants available for
analyses based on urine cadmium. NHANES
1999­2004 interviews, physical examinations,
and written informed consents were approved
by the NCHS Institutional Review Board.
Blood and urine cadmium. Blood
and urine cadmium were measured at the
Environmental Health Sciences Laboratory of
the CDC National Center for Environmental
Health (NCEH) after confirmation of no
background contamination in all collection
and storage materials and using extensive
quality control procedures (NCHS 2006a,
2007b, 2007c).
Cadmium levels in whole blood were meas-
ured on a Perkin-Elmer model SIMAA 6000
(PerkinElmer, Norwalk, CT) simultaneous

INTRODUCTION: Cadmium induces hypertension in animal models. Epidemiologic studies of
cadmium exposure and hypertension, however, have been inconsistent.
OBJECTIVE: We aimed to investigate the association of blood and urine cadmium with blood
pressure levels and with the prevalence of hypertension in U.S. adults who participated in the
1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES).
METHODS: We studied participants  20 years of age with determinations of cadmium in blood
(n = 10,991) and urine (n = 3,496). Blood and urine cadmium were measured by atomic absorption
spectrometry and inductively coupled plasma­mass spectrometry, respectively. Systolic and diastolic
blood pressure levels were measured using a standardized protocol.
RESULTS: The geometric means of blood and urine cadmium were 3.77 nmol/L and 2.46 nmol/L,
respectively. After multivariable adjustment, the average differences in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure comparing participants in the 90th vs. 10th percentile of the blood cadmium distribution
were 1.36 mmHg [95% confidence interval (CI), ­0.28 to 3.00] and 1.68 mmHg (95% CI,
0.57­2.78), respectively. The corresponding differences were 2.35 mmHg and 3.27 mmHg among
never smokers, 1.69 mmHg and 1.55 mmHg among former smokers, and 0.02 mmHg and
0.69 mmHg among current smokers. No association was observed for urine cadmium with blood
pressure levels, or for blood and urine cadmium with the prevalence of hypertension.
CONCLUSIONS: Cadmium levels in blood, but not in urine, were associated with a modest elevation
in blood pressure levels. The association was stronger among never smokers, intermediate among
former smokers, and small or null among current smokers. Our findings add to the concern of renal
and cardiovascular cadmium toxicity at chronic low levels of exposure in the general population.

with Zeeman background correction (NCHS
2004a, 2005a, 2006b). The limit of detection
was 2.67 nmol/L in NHANES 1999­2002
and 1.78 in NHANES 2003­2004. Of the
study participants, 21.6% and 13.4% had
blood cadmium levels below the limits of
detection in NHANES 1999­2002 and
NHANES 2003­2004, respectively. National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)
whole-blood standard reference materials were
used for external calibration (NCHS 2006a,
2007b, 2007c). The interassay coefficients of
variation ranged from 4.1% to 9.4%.
Cadmium levels in spot urine specimens
were measured by inductively coupled
plasma-mass spectrometry (PerkinElmer/
SCIEX model 500; PerkinElmer, Shelton,
CT) using a multielement analytical tech-
nique (NCHS 2004a, 2005a, 2006b). In
NHANES 1999­2002, cadmium levels in
urine were corrected for interference from
molybdenum oxide. A total of 3.3% of partic-
ipants had urine cadmium levels below the
limit of detection (0.53 nmol/L). NIST urine
standard reference material 2679 was used for
external calibration, and spiked pools pre-
pared at the laboratory were used for internal
quality control. Quality control samples
included both bench and blind samples
(NCHS 2006a, 2007b, 2007c). The inter-
assay coefficients of variation ranged from
1.2% to 4.7%. For blood and urine cadmium
levels below the limit of detection, NHANES
reported a level equal to the limit of detection
divided by the square root of 2.
Blood pressure. A specific protocol was
used to measure blood pressure in NHANES
1999­2004. Two physicians and two health
technologists were trained to measure blood
pressure using a standardized protocol that
followed the American Heart Association
guidelines (NCHS 2002a, 2004b, 2005b).
Three and sometimes four systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure determinations were
taken on the same day in a sitting position.
Blood pressure determinations were taken
after 5 min rest using a mercury sphygmo-
manometer, with an appropriate size cuff (five
sizes available) placed on the bared right arm.
Quality control and assurance procedures
included extensive initial training, quarterly
recertification, procedural checklists, and con-
tinuous review of data for systematic error
(Ostchega et al. 2003). Mean systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure were computed discarding
the first reading, except when only one reading
was available (NCHS 2002a, 2004b, 2005b).
Hypertension was defined as a mean systolic
blood pressure  140 mmHg, a mean diastolic
blood pressure  90 mmHg, a self-reported
physician diagnosis, or medication use.
Other variables. Information on age, sex,
race/ethnicity, education, smoking, and alco-
hol consumption was based on self-report

Blood cadmium Urine cadmium
(Table 1, Figure 1). Body mass index (BMI)
was calculated by dividing measured weight
in kilograms by measured height in meters
squared. Serum cotinine was measured by an
isotope-dilution high-performance liquid
chromatography/atmospheric pressure chemi-
cal ionization tandem mass spectrometric
method (NCHS 2006a, 2007b, 2007c).
Serum creatinine was measured by the modi-
fied kinetic method of Jaffé and corrected for
NHANES 1999­2000 as recommended in
the study protocol (NCHS 2006a, 2007b,
2007c). Estimated glomerular filtration rate
was calculated from calibrated creatinine, age,
sex, and race/ethnicity using the Modification
of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula
(Stevens et al. 2006). Blood lead levels were
measured simultaneously to blood cadmium
levels using multielement atomic absorption
spectrometry with Zeeman background cor-
rection (NCHS 2006a, 2007b, 2007c). Urine
creatinine was determined using a Jaffé rate
reaction measured with a CX3 analyzer
(NCHS 2006a, 2007b, 2007c).
Statistical analysis. All statistical analyses
were performed using the survey package in
the R statistical language to account for the
complex sampling design and weights in
NHANES 1999­2004 and to obtain appropri-
ate standard errors for all estimates (Lumley
2007). Cadmium levels in blood and urine and
lead levels in blood were right skewed and log-
transformed for analyses. We estimated
adjusted mean differences in blood pressure
levels or adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the
prevalence of hypertension comparing quartiles
2 to 4 of cadmium to the lowest quartile using
linear and logistic regression, respectively.
Quartile cutoffs were based on weighted distri-
butions in the whole study sample. In addition
to quartiles, we also used linear and logistic
models to compare the 90th with the 10th per-
centile of cadmium distribution, assuming a
log-linear relationship. Statistical models were
initially adjusted for age (restricted cubic spline
transformation), sex, race/ethnicity and educa-
tion. We further adjusted for smoking (never,
former, current, and serum cotinine), alcohol
intake (never, former, current), BMI, use of
antihypertensive medication, menopause sta-
tus, and lead exposure. Adjustment for esti-
mated glomerular filtration rate did not affect
the conclusions (data not shown). For urine
cadmium, all models were adjusted for urine
creatinine to account for variations in dilution
in spot urine samples (Barr et al. 2005).
p-Values for linear trend were obtained by
including log-transformed cadmium levels as
continuous variables in the regression models.
We also evaluated the association of blood
and urine cadmium with blood pressure end
points for subgroups defined by sex and
smoking status. p-Values for the interactions
between blood and urine cadmium with par-
ticipant characteristics were obtained from
adding an interaction term between log-
transformed cadmium (blood, urine) and the
corresponding participant characteristic (sex,
smoking status).
Results
The geometric means of blood and urine cad-
mium were 3.77 nmol/L (0.42 µg/L) and
2.46 nmol/L (0.3 µg/L), respectively (Table 1).
The Pearson correlation coefficient between
blood and urine log-cadmium levels was 0. 42
(p < 0.001). Blood and urine cadmium levels
were higher in older participants, in partici-
pants with lower education, and in current
and former smokers (Figure 1). By smoking
status category (never, current, former), blood
and urine cadmium levels were generally
higher in women than in men. Blood cad-
mium levels were more strongly correlated
with current smoking and with serum cotinine
than were urine cadmium levels. The weighted
prevalence of hypertension in the study sample
was 35%.
After multivariable adjustment, the aver-
age differences in systolic and diastolic blood
pressure comparing the highest to the lowest
quartiles of blood cadmium were 1.50 mmHg
(95% CI, ­0.24 to 3.24) and 1.23 mmHg
(95% CI, 0.11 to 2.35), respectively (Table 2,
model 2). Compared with participants in the
10th percentile of the blood cadmium distrib-
ution, participants in the 90th percentile had
1.36 mmHg (95% CI, ­0.28 to 3.00) higher
systolic blood pressure levels and 1.68 mmHg
(95% CI, 0.57 to 2.78) higher diastolic blood
pressure levels. No association was observed
for urine cadmium.
The multivariable adjusted OR for hyper-
tension comparing the highest to the lowest
quartile of blood cadmium was 1.03 (95%
CI, 0.77 to 1.36) (Table 3). The correspond-
ing OR comparing participants in the 90th
with the 10th percentile of the blood cad-
mium distribution was 1.14 (95% CI, 0.89 to
1.45). Similarly, no association was observed
between urine cadmium and the prevalence
of hypertension.
By sex, the associations of blood and urine
cadmium with blood pressure end points
were markedly similar for men and women,
and none of the interactions were statistically
significant (Table 4). By smoking status, the
average differences in systolic and diastolic
blood pressure levels comparing participants
in the 90th with the 10th percentile of the
blood cadmium distribution were 2.35 mmHg
and 3.27 mmHg, respectively, among never
smokers; 1.69 mmHg and 1.55 mmHg
among former smokers; and 0.02 mmHg and
0.69 mmHg among current smokers. The
modification of the associations between
blood cadmium levels with systolic and dias-
tolic blood pressure levels were statistically
significant for current smokers compared with
never smokers. For urine cadmium, the
associations by smoking status were similar
for all subgroups.

Discussion
In a representative sample of U.S. adults who
participated in NHANES 1999­2004, cad-
mium levels in blood, but not in urine, were
associated with a modest elevation of blood
pressure levels. There was no association
between cadmium levels and the prevalence
of hypertension. By smoking status, the asso-
ciation for blood cadmium and blood pres-
sure levels was stronger among never smokers,
intermediate among former smokers, and
small or null among current smokers. Both
urine and blood cadmium are biomarkers of
long-term and ongoing cadmium exposure,
although blood cadmium reflects recent expo-
sure better than urine cadmium (ATSDR
1999; Elinder et al. 1988; Jarup et al. 1983).
In our study, this was confirmed by a stronger
association of blood cadmium compared with
urine cadmium with current smoking status
and serum cotinine, a biomarker or recent
smoking. Our findings of a positive associa-
tion of blood cadmium, but not urine cad-
mium, with blood pressure may indicate that
blood pressure levels are affected by recent
rather than long-term cadmium exposure.
Alternatively, it is possible that blood cad-
mium reflects biologically active cadmium
better than urine cadmium.
Few epidemiologic studies have measured
both blood and urine cadmium levels. In
Belgium, the CadmiBel study assessed the
health consequences of environmental cad-
mium contamination (Staessen et al. 1991,
2000). In a prospective analysis of 336 men
and 356 women residing in the two rural areas
of the CadmiBel study (Staessen et al. 2000),
changes in blood cadmium levels between
1985­1989 (baseline) and 1991­1995 (fol-
low-up) were positively associated with
changes in systolic and diastolic blood pres-
sure, although the association was statistically
significant only for diastolic blood pressure
among women. Similar to our study, no asso-
ciation was found between urine cadmium
and blood pressure levels. The relative risk for
developing definite hypertension for a dou-
bling of baseline blood cadmium levels was
1.28 (95% CI, 0.87 to 1.88), and for a dou-
bling of baseline urine cadmium levels it was
1.16 (95% CI, 0.84 to 1.62) (Staessen et al.
2000). Because blood or urine cadmium were
not associated with increased blood pressure
levels in cross-sectional analyses of all
CadmiBel study participants (n = 2,086)
(Staessen et al. 1991) and the prospective asso-
ciation was only statistically significant for
diastolic blood pressure among women
(Staessen et al. 2000), the prospective associa-
tion between changes in blood cadmium and
blood pressure found in this study were
considered uncertain.
Other studies of cadmium and blood pres-
sure have measured only urine or blood cad-
mium, with inconsistent findings. In the
United States, a subsample of 951 adults who
participated in NHANES II (1976­1988)
found a positive but modest association of
urine cadmium with blood pressure levels
(Whittemore et al. 1991). Other studies have
been smaller and their findings were subject to
substantial random variability (Beevers et al.
1976; McKenzie and Kay 1973; Pizent et al.
2001; Vivoli et al. 1989; Whittemore et al.
1991). Finally, in a cadmium-polluted area in
Japan, 52 women with Itai-Itai disease had
lower systolic and diastolic blood pressure lev-
els compared with 104 age-matched women
living out of the cadmium-polluted area
(Kagamimori et al. 1986). Indeed, despite
important nephrotoxicity, hypertension has
not been reported as a typical finding in Itai-
Itai disease patients in the cadmium-polluted

area of Japan (Nordberg et al. 2007). The pos-
sible relevance of findings from populations
heavily exposed to cadmium to explain the
null or even possible inverse association
between urine cadmium levels and blood pres-
sure end points in our study is unknown.
Cadmium exposure induces hypertension
in animal models (Satarug et al. 2006),
although the mechanisms for cadmium-
related hypertension remain unclear. A pri-
mary mechanism for cadmium toxicity is
depletion of glutathione and alteration of
sulfhydryl homeostasis (Valko et al. 2005),
thus indirectly increasing oxidative stress
and lipid peroxidation (Yiin et al. 1999).
Cadmium induces renal proximal tubular
injury, salt retention, and volume overload
which may produce hypertension (Satarug
et al. 2006). Other potential mechanisms
include partial agonism for calcium channels
(Varoni et al. 2003), direct vasoconstrictor
action, activation of the sympathetic nervous
system, and inhibition of vasodilator sub-
stances such as nitric oxide (Bilgen et al.
2003; Varoni et al. 2003). Because cadmium
levels used in experimental models are much
higher than exposure in the U.S. general pop-
ulation, the relevance of these mechanisms to
human hypertension is uncertain.
Cadmium is absorbed through the respira-
tory and digestive tracts. Under conditions of
chronic exposure, cadmium is transported in
blood bounded mainly to metallothionein.
Metallothionein is a low-molecular-weight
metal-binding protein induced by cadmium
exposure that plays an important role in
cadmium metabolism and toxicokinetics
(Nordberg et al. 1992, 2007). Induction of
metallothionein depends on the dose and fre-
quency of cadmium exposure. For instance,
smokers may be more likely to induce metal-
lothionein because they are repeatedly exposed
to cadmium from cigarette smoke. By binding
cadmium, metallothionein may protect the kid-
neys and other organs from the toxic effects of
cadmium (Nordberg et al. 1992). In the renal
cortex, cadmium­metallothionein compounds
are stored in tubular cells with only a minor
proportion of the body burden being excreted
through urine (ATSDR 1999). As a result, cad-
mium progressively accumulates with age in the
kidney and other organs, although autopsy
studies have shown that cadmium concentra-
tion in the kidneys decreases after 45­50 years
of age (Nordberg et al. 2007; Satarug et al.
2003; Travis and Haddock 1980). Although
fluctuations in cadmium exposure result in
blood cadmium fluctuations, few changes are
observed in urine cadmium which, in the
absence of tubular damage, reflects cadmium
accumulation in the body over time (Nordberg
et al. 1992). Experimental studies at low expo-
sure levels are needed to determine the impact
of short- versus long-term cadmium exposure
on blood pressure and the relevance of metal-
lothionein induction.
The findings of our study must be inter-
preted with caution. First, single blood and
urine cadmium measurements may be limited
to fully assess cadmium exposure and cad-
mium internal dose. Cadmium levels in blood
were low, close to the instrument limit of
detection and with most participants having
levels over a small number of values. For
urine cadmium, the use of spot urine samples
and the limitations of using creatinine to
adjust for urine dilution (Barr et al. 2005)
may have amplified this problem. Blood and
urine cadmium levels are thus subject to sub-
stantial within-person error and may also be
affected by other participants' characteristics.
Given that cadmium is a well-established
nephrotoxicant even at low levels of chronic
exposure (Åkesson et al. 2005), underestima-
tion of the potential effects of cadmium on
blood pressure and hypertension is a concern.
Metallothionein levels, which could explain
part of the variability of the association of
cadmium with blood pressure end points,
were not determined in NHANES.
Second, additional limitations of our
study include the cross-sectional design and
the difficulty in adjusting for some potential
confounders, including socioeconomic status,
education, or other exposures that may occur
in the same environmental settings. However,
our results persisted after adjustment for edu-
cational level, race/ethnicity, smoking status,
serum cotinine levels, and blood lead levels.
Finally, the modification of the associa-
tion of blood cadmium with blood pressure
levels by smoking status was the result of a
post hoc analysis. Potential explanations
include markedly different sources, routes,
and patterns of cadmium exposure for smok-
ers versus nonsmokers, unknown differences
in participant characteristics or co-exposures
by smoking status, and random variability.
Among smokers, blood cadmium is likely to
be a marker of smoking intensity, and other
components in tobacco smoke could con-
tribute to these differences. Indeed, smokers
have generally lower blood pressure levels
than do nonsmokers (Green et al. 1986;
Mikkelsen et al. 1997), and among smokers,
higher levels of serum cotinine have been
associated with lower blood pressure levels
(Benowitz and Sharp 1989).
Conclusion
At the low levels of cadmium exposure
observed in NHANES 1999­2004, we found
a modest but positive association between
blood cadmium and blood pressure levels.
The association of blood cadmium but not of
urine cadmium with elevated blood pressure
could be related to recent cadmium exposure
having a short-term effect on blood pressure
levels. Also, blood cadmium could more read-
ily reflect biologically active cadmium. These
interpretations require testing in experimental
settings at the relevant levels of exposure. Our
findings add to the concern on renal and car-
diovascular cadmium toxicity at chronic low
levels of exposure (Åkesson et al. 2005;
ATSDR 1999; Jin et al. 2004; Navas-Acien
et al. 2004, 2005; Nordberg et al. 2007), and
support the need for efforts to reduce envi-
ronmental cadmium exposure in the general
population.
