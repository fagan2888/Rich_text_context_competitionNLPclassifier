Concern Regarding the HIV/AIDS epidemic and
Individual Childbearing:
Evidence from Rural Malawi
Claire M. Noël-Miller 1
Abstract
I examine if and how rural Malawians alter their childbearing as a consequence of
concern regarding the HIV/AIDS epidemic. The paper is motivated by the debate which
opposes two ideas regarding the childbearing effect of high HIV infection rates and
heightened AIDS mortality: one, the acceleration of childbearing as individuals find
themselves under time pressure to meet their reproductive goals and two, the decrease
in childbearing as parents opt to avoid the risk of transmitting the virus. I find some
evidence to support the hypothesis of reduced childbearing in the presence of high
levels of worry regarding HIV/AIDS. However, this finding does not seem to apply to
younger women, who are perhaps subject to relatively stronger childbearing promoting
norms.

1. Introduction
The HIV/AIDS epidemic has had a devastating impact on the mortality and life
expectancy of communities in which prevalence remains high (Boerma, Nunn, and
Whitworth 1998; Ainsworth and Over 1997; Nicoll, Timaeus, Kigadye, Walraven, and
Killewo 1994). Despite the difficulty of accurately measuring deaths from AIDS, the
mortality and life expectancy consequences of the epidemic have dominated
demographic research on the topic. This paper considers a perspective that has so far
received much less attention from the research community by focusing on the
relationship between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and childbearing. I examine whether and
how rural Malawians alter their childbearing as a consequence of concern about the
HIV/AIDS epidemic in a setting where an estimated 16% of the adult population carries
the HIV virus (Note 1) (UNAIDS and WHO 2000).
The present research is embedded in a larger debate, which opposes two
competing ideas for the childbearing effects of the HIV/AIDS epidemic. On one hand,
researchers have raised the possibility that men and women at high risk of becoming
infected with HIV or already infected may attempt to increase their pace of childbearing
(Temmerman et al. 1994; Gregson 1994). This hypothesis is based on the defining role
played by reproduction in shaping adult personal and social identities, particularly in
the African context. The speculation has been that upon becoming aware of a
heightened risk of infection, individuals would attempt `to accomplish unmet
reproductive goals, knowing that they will not live a normal life span' (Setel 1995:
Abstract). However, interest has also been expressed for the idea that the HIV/AIDS
epidemic will exert a downward pressure on childbearing as individuals faced with the
disease opt to reduce their fertility out of fear for a possible transmission of the virus
and concern for their children's future care (Gregson, Zhuwau, Anderson, and
Chandiwana 1997; Aka-Dago-Akribi, Desgrees Du Lou, Msellati, Dossou, and
Welffens-Ekra 1999; Setel 1995; Ntozi and Tashobya 1998; Rutenberg, Biddlecom, and
Kaona 2000). Under a `natural fertility regime' where childbearing is assumed non-
volitional and conscious control of fertility does not exist, explanations for the fertility
reducing effect of HIV/AIDS rely on the classical proximate determinants, primarily
coital frequency.
This debate is relevant insofar as it points to one of the three broader theoretical
pathways for a relation between the HIV/AIDS epidemic and childbearing (Note 2),
namely individual behavioral changes. Childbearing and the HIV/AIDS epidemic may
for instance be related through insurance and replacement strategies, a delayed age at
marriage or start of sexual activity, increases in divorce or separation rates,
modifications in levels of condom use and increased abstention from sex, all resulting
from the fear of infection (Zaba and Gregson 1998). The second theoretical pathway is
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 321
through biological determinants. There exists convincing evidence based on population
surveys that those who are sero-positive are less likely to bear children than those who
are sero-negative (Gray 1997; Gregson, Zaba, and Hunter 2002). These biological
determinants include increased partner mortality, increased menstrual disorders,
decreased production of spermatozoa and reduced coital frequency due to decreased
libido (Zaba and Gregson 1998). Finally, changes in the age structure at the population
level due to excess mortality among high-risk groups can potentially add to the
childbearing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic (Zaba and Gregson 1998).
Characteristics of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on childbearing have a
number of consequences for comprehending aggregate demographic trends in affected
areas. Particularly, knowledge of the childbearing impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic is
important because of the latter's close relationship to the rate of population growth. A
change in the population age structure due to age-selective mortality of individuals in
their reproductive years is likely to result in a slight initial decline in the crude birth rate
(assuming that the proportional decline in the number of births is greater than the
proportional decline in the total number of person years lived). However, this trend will
be sustained in the long run only if reductions in the underlying total fertility rates are
also sustained. In addition, childbearing changes due to the HIV/AIDS epidemic are
likely to influence the process of fertility transition and to complicate our
conceptualization of it (Caldwell, Caldwell, and Quiggin 1989).
This paper explores the implications of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on individual
childbearing. The dataset on which this research is based does not contain information
on HIV status or on AIDS deaths. Nonetheless, the respondents are well aware of the
epidemic: most are familiar with the symptoms of AIDS, know someone who has died
of AIDS (i.e. with these symptoms), are aware of how HIV is transmitted, and know
their own behavior and enough about their spouse's behavior to understand whether or
not they are at risk (Watkins 2003; Smith and Watkins 2003; Smith this issue; Zulu and
Chepngeno this issue; Schatz 2002). As I show later, when asked whether they were
worried that they might `catch AIDS' (the distinction between HIV and AIDS is blurred
in the rural Malawian context) only a small fraction of all respondents reported that they
were not worried at all, and nearly two thirds said they were `worried a lot'. Some of
those who are worried may well be infected: since few are tested for HIV, however,
they do not have clinical confirmation. Others, infected or not, may perceive they are
already infected, either as a result of their own sexual behavior or what they know or
suspect about their spouse. They may also perceive that they are at great risk of
infection and death in the future. And still others perceive that they are not at risk,
perhaps because they have not themselves engaged in extramarital sex and believe their
husband has been faithful. It is reasonable to hypothesize that these differences in worry
would have an effect on childbearing (for a similar argument that perceptions of levels
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
322 http://www.demographic-research.org
of child mortality rather than the actual levels are primary in influencing childbearing,
see Montgomery and Casterline 1996 and Montgomery 1999).
The following sections summarize the evidence to date for the interaction between
HIV/AIDS and childbearing and propose a methodology for analyzing the association
between individual childbearing and heightened concern about HIV infection and AIDS
death in rural Malawi. I conclude with a discussion of my results.
2. What do we know about the association between HIV/AIDS and
childbearing?
The now emerging body of literature exploring the childbearing effects of the
HIV/AIDS epidemic has most commonly been summarized according to the basic
distinctions in interactive pathways already mentioned: effects of the epidemic (1) at the
individual biological level, (2) at the individual behavioral level and (3) at the
compositional level (UN Population Division 2002). In the following review of the
literature I adopt a similar approach while distinguishing between individual biological
and individual behavioral mechanisms through which the HIV/AIDS epidemic might
affect fertility. I also distinguish between studies in which HIV status is known to
researchers only, those in which HIV status is also known to respondents, and those in
which HIV status is known to neither researcher nor respondent.
It is important to know that overall, there is little empirical evidence on the impact
of heightened mortality from AIDS on childbearing in sub-Saharan Africa. In fact,
demographic modelers of the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic have too commonly
assumed no childbearing response to HIV/AIDS. For instance, a report titled The AIDS
Epidemic and its Demographic Consequences (UN and WHO 1991) presents seven
mathematical models for the demographic consequences of the spread of the HIV/AIDS
epidemic, none of which include a fertility response.
Biological mechanisms are thought to account for most of the fertility effect of
HIV/AIDS on already infected individuals. In a review of the evidence for the fertility
impact of the epidemic in Uganda, Zambia and Tanzania, Zaba and Gregson (1998)
conclude that in non-contracepting populations, the fertility of HIV-infected women is
substantially lower than that of HIV-negative women. From the studies reviewed
(Carpenter et al. 1997; Gray et al. 1998; Fylkesnes, Ndhlovu, Kasumba, Musonda, and
Sichone 1998), the authors estimate a 25-40% loss in fertility among infected women
and a reduction of approximately 0.4% in the total fertility rate with each percentage
point increase in female HIV prevalence figures. Similar results were found by other
researchers in the Democratic Republic of Congo (Ryder et al. 1991), in Uganda
(Sewankamboo et al. 1995) and in Rwanda (Allen et al. 1993). In addition, they find
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 323
that the fertility of HIV-positive women varies with age: young HIV-positive women
do not seem to experience any loss in fertility and the reduction in cumulated fertility
becomes more severe as women age. An interesting result of this research points to the
primary role of fetal losses through miscarriages, spontaneous abortions and stillbirths
resulting from infection with HIV and co-infection with other sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs), particularly syphilis (Bracher and Santow 2001; Gregson et al. 1997;
De Cock, Zadi, and Adjorlolo 1994; Langstone et al. 1995). Moreover, HIV-infected
women typically experience reductions in their sexual drive as well as reductions in
fecundability and a possible decrease in the production of spermatozoa or damage to
sperm morphology and function in their infected male partners (Gray et al. 1998;
Crittenden, Handelsman, and Stewart 1992; Krieger et al. 1991; Gresenguet, Belec,
Herve, Massanga, and Martin 1992).
While researchers recognize biological effects as being primarily responsible for
reduced fertility among HIV infected individuals, there remains some uncertainty
regarding possible confounding behavioral effects (Zaba and Gregson 1998). The bulk
of the research on the childbearing-related behavioral effects of HIV infection reflects
the basic fact that in sub-Saharan Africa, most who do become aware of their
seropositive status will do so late in the progression of AIDS symptoms. They are thus
not likely to remain well long enough to significantly alter their childbearing-related
behavior. By and large, the research supports the hypothesis that childbearing-related
behavior of HIV infected individuals does not depend on their knowledge of being
seropositive (Heyward et al. 1993). A number of studies have found that condom use
for instance is not altered after individuals become aware of their HIV infection (Lutalo
et al. 2000; Temmerman et al. 1990). A qualitative study conducted by Aka-Dago-
Akribi and colleagues (1999) in Côte d'Ivoire concludes that HIV positive women who
are aware of their condition report no intention of modifying their sexual behavior.
Finally, there exists no convincing evidence that periods of breastfeeding and of post-
partum abstinence are modified by the awareness of an HIV positive status. Because of
the difficulties associated with measuring direct behavioral changes due to an HIV
positive status, researchers have focused their attention on variations in childbearing
intentions. This segment of the literature reports on the ambiguity in changes of
childbearing desires that accompany knowledge of one's HIV positive condition. The
study by Aka-Dago-Akribi and colleagues (1999) is partially representative of a small
set of studies highlighting women's desire to continue childbearing after they are
informed of being HIV infected (Lutalo et al. 2000; Temmerman et al. 1990;
Rutenberg et al. 2000). In this study, a pregnancy was thought to symbolize a woman's
own health or at least her capacity to bear a healthy child (Ankrah 1991). Fear of
abandonment by husband and community was frequently cited as a motivation for
avoiding any suspicion of HIV infection (Maman 1999). Even among HIV-discordant
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
324 http://www.demographic-research.org
couples in which both partners were aware of each other's status, couples chose to have
more children, despite the risk of transmission to the uninfected partner and the child, in
order to avoid the danger of rejection by the community (Aka-Dago-Akribi et al. 1999).
However, more common are studies which report on the negative or inexistent effects
of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on childbearing desires (Gregson et al. 1997; Setel 1995;
Ntozi and Tashobya 1998; Rutenberg et al. 2000). Rutenberg and colleagues (2000)
summarize the main motivations for desiring fewer children as being related to fears
that continued reproduction will worsen one's health and that the virus will be
transmitted to the child. Additional worries have to do with parents' ability to insure
children's social and material well-being once they are no longer able to care for them
(Setel 1995).
While the studies of differences in fertility between those who are aware of their
HIV positive status and known to be so by the analyst versus those who are HIV
negative provide us with important background, it is particularly important to explore
fertility and HIV/AIDS in contexts where sero-status is not known to the researcher and
is unlikely to be known to the respondent--the typical situation in sub-Saharan Africa.
In these contexts, although they may not know this with certainty, most individuals are
HIV-negative and thus remain exposed to the risk of contracting the virus, therefore
potentially experiencing some degree of worry associated with this risk.
Several studies have suggested that even in areas where HIV prevalence is
relatively high and individuals perceive a high risk of infection, such as Tanzania,
social and economic forces remained the primary motivation for continued childbearing
(Setel 1995). In Zimbabwe, where HIV prevalence is also relatively high, empirical
findings do not support the idea that the HIV/AIDS epidemic has been leading to an
acceleration of childbearing. Gregson and colleagues (1997) found that close to half of
their respondents opted for delaying their next pregnancy because of HIV/AIDS and in
order to facilitate the body's recovery from previous childbearing (a behavior not
necessarily related to HIV/AIDS).
Regarding the sexual exposure of non-infected individuals researchers have
focused on issues of formation and dissolution of marital or stable unions. While
contradictory results have been found for the effects of the epidemic on the timing of
marriage, the bulk of the empirical evidence is in support of a postponement of age at
marriage due to the fear of engaging in sexual activity and possibly contracting HIV
(Asiimwe-Okiror et al. 1997; Mukiza-Gapere and Ntozi 1995). A competing hypothesis
which has received less support points to the possibility of earlier marriage with the
intent of reducing risks of HIV transmission due to pre-marital sexual promiscuity. This
is primarily because marriage is not generally perceived as a reliable guarantee of
sexual fidelity, particularly by women. Both the hypothesis that separation or divorce
would be used as protection against an infected partner or avoided as part of a trend
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 325
towards more fidelity and stability have been raised, but research on this topic remains
inconclusive (Mukiza-Gapere and Ntozi 1995). However, some agreement seems to
have been reached that the epidemic is exerting downward pressure on probabilities of
remarriage following either widowhood or divorce, due to fears that the new spouse
may be infected (Caldwell 1997).
In addition, there exists very limited and disputed evidence of a decline in extra-
marital sexual activity and changes in contraceptive use due to the threat of HIV
infection (Ng'weshemi et al. 1996). In spite of the methodological difficulties associated
with attributing condom use to the threat of HIV infection alone, researchers have
established a link between self-evaluation of the risk of infection or HIV/AIDS
awareness and increased condom use (Gregson et al. 1997; Lutalo et al. 2000; Agha
1998; Agha, Kusanthan, Longfield, Klein, and Berman 2002; Meekers, Klein, and
Foyet 2001; Mehryar 1995). The effect on childbearing, however, is still to be
established since, as Gregson and others find, increased condom use could partially be
in replacement of previously preferred contraceptive methods and/or limited only to
unstable sexual relations (Gregson et al. 1997; Meursing and Sibindi 1995).
3. Data source and context
The present analysis is based on the ongoing Malawi Diffusion and Ideational Change
Project's (MDICP) longitudinal dataset collected by Watkins and collaborators from the
University of Pennsylvania in 1998 and 2001 (Note 3). The MDICP goal is to explore
the ways in which social networks change beliefs and behavior regarding childbearing,
family planning and the HIV/AIDS epidemic in rural Malawi (Watkins et al. 2003). The
project is based on the idea that social interaction and ideational diffusion are important
determinants of reproductive attitudes and behavior.
The study took place in three rural Traditional Authorities (local administrative
units) of Malawi: (1) Rumphi district, located in the Northern part of the country, (2)
Balaka district, located in the Southern region and (3) Mchinji District, situated in the
Central part of the country. The rural districts were selected with the aim of overlapping
with the sites of several previous surveys in order to insure comparability over time. In
each Traditional Authority, villages were randomly selected and exhaustive listings of
all households in these villages were established. From these households, eligible
female respondents and their husbands or partners were randomly selected.
The MDICP interviewed ever-married women of childbearing age (15-49) and
their husbands or partners divided equally across the three regions. This analysis
focuses solely on the 1200 female respondents of the study who were interviewed both
in the first data collection round (Malawi 1) and in the second data collection round
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
326 http://www.demographic-research.org
(Malawi 2). The data were obtained in face-to-face interviews conducted by Malawian
interviewers in the home of the respondent. Interviewers used paper questionnaires
administered in the language in which the respondent felt the most comfortable
answering. For further information on the characteristics distinguishing the rural
communities where the data were collected as well as aspects of sample selection and
data quality, the reader is referred to the introduction to this volume.
4. Methods and models
I use conditional probabilities and multivariate ordered cumulative logit regression to
estimate the relationship between worry regarding HIV/AIDS and the number of
children born to a respondent between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.
The number of children that were born to a woman between rounds of data
collection was determined by using the woman's responses to the following question
asked in both surveys: "Can you give me the total number of children you have given
birth to?". The number of births between 1998 and 2001 was obtained by subtracting
the figure indicated in Malawi 1 from that indicated in Malawi 2. Because this process
produced unrealistically high and low values (Note 4), I opted for limiting the possible
range for the number of births to values between 0-3 and set all other data points to
missing (the frequency missing was 172 or 14.3% of the sample). In other words, a
woman was `permitted' to have had from no to three additional children between data
collection rounds (Note 5). Table 1 summarizes the distribution of the sample according
to the respondent's number of births between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.
Table 1: Sample distribution of respondents by number of births between Malawi
1 and Malawi 2.

Total 1028 100
The measure of the explanatory variable of key interest, i.e. a respondents concern
regarding HIV/AIDS, was obtained by using the answers to the question `How worried
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 327
are you that you might catch AIDS' posed in Malawi 1. The respondent was given a
choice between four possible answers: `not worried at all', `worried a little', `worried a
lot' and `don't know'. Table 2 presents the sample distribution according to the
responses that were obtained for this question in Malawi 1. Six respondents did not
provide an answer (0.5% of the sample).
Table 2: Sample distribution of respondents by degree of worry about HIV
infection in Malawi 1.
Degree of Worry Number of women Percent
Not worried at all 206 17.25
Worried a little 251 21.02
Worried a lot 735 61.56
Don't know 2 0.17
Total 1194 100
The first three options in the table above were transformed into a set of dummy
variables and the `not worried at all' option was set as the reference category.
Three important notes must be made regarding the respondent's reported level of
concern relative to HIV/AIDS. First, this is a worry variable and not a risk variable
(Note 6). In the 2001 MDICP round of data collection, respondents were asked about
their risk: how likely they thought it was that they were already infected with HIV.
Those who responded that it was not likely, were further asked how likely they thought
it was that they would be infected in the future i.e. their worry regarding HIV infection.
The questions about risk were closely related to the questions about worry. `Worry' is
preferable here because it is a more emotional concept, and thus arguably closer to the
emotions and psychological factors that would lead women to delay, or hurry up
childbearing. Second, a caveat must be made regarding the issue of reliability of the
respondents' answers. Due to the sensitivity of the topic, virtually all questions related
to HIV/AIDS are bound to suffer from misreporting. Third, for reasons of simplicity,
intensities of concern regarding a possible HIV infection are assumed to be independent
of childbearing between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.
Tables 3 and 4 present proportions having a given number of births between 1998
and 2001 by age of the respondent in 1998 and proportions reporting a given degree of
worry in 1998 by age of the respondent in 1998 respectively. These proportions are
obtained by using a sub-sample of 1021 respondents with data on all three of the age,
number of births and worry regarding HIV infection variables.

The data reported in Table 3 indicates that the number of births obtained between
Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 varies with age. Specifically, the number of births obtained
between 1998 and 2001 is inversely related to age such that the older the respondent,
the larger the probability of having had no additional children between both rounds of
data collection.
Table 4 on the other hand displays strong intensities of worry across all ages. The
proportion having some level of worry fluctuates roughly between 81% and 85% across
the four age groups, indicating that only a minority of women are not worried at all. In
addition, it seems to be the case that with increasing age low intensities of worry evolve
into higher levels of worry.
Table 5 describes relationships between number of births during 1998-2001 and
degree of worry about HIV/AIDS by age category. It presents estimates of the
conditional probability of having a given number of births for each age group. The
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 329
probabilities reported are conditional on a particular worry level. The age variable is
chosen here as a control because it appeared as important in determining a woman's
additional number of births in the preliminary analyses just presented.

Sample size 333 357 246 85
If the hypothesis of increased childbearing were to be supported by the analysis of
conditional probabilities, one would expect to see a decrease in the conditional
probability of having no children as worry about HIV/AIDS increases. On the other
hand, if the hypothesis of reduced childbearing were to be confirmed, one would expect
to find that the conditional probability of having zero births increases with the level of
worry.
An analysis of the conditional probabilities presented in Table 5 indicates that
different intensities of worry are associated with different probabilities of having a
given fertility outcome between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. Generally speaking, the data
seems to support the hypothesis of a reduced number of births with increased worry.
Particularly in the age ranges 25-34 and 35-44, the conditional probability of having no
births increases as the level of worry increases. Conversely, the conditional
probabilities of having 1, 2 or 3 births tend to decrease with increases in the degree of
concern. These results seem to indicate that, particularly between ages 25 and 44,
higher worry regarding HIV/AIDS is associated with lower probabilities of having
additional children between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. It must also be noted that the
reduction in childbearing associated with relatively high levels of worry seems to be
very strong. In the middle age groups, movement from `no worry at all' to `worried a
lot' results in a 25-30% decrease in the conditional probability of having at least one
child, a strikingly strong effect.
The conditional probabilities displayed in the 15-24 age panel of Table 5 carry a
very different message. While worry seems to be negatively associated with the number
of births occurring to older women during 1998-2001, it does not seem to matter to the

fertility outcome of women in this youngest age group. Conditional probabilities of
having had no children between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 remain roughly constant across
all degrees of the worry condition, suggesting that the reduction in childbearing
associated with increased worry is not characteristic of this youngest group. This result
may at least partially be explained by the existence of powerful childbearing promoting
social and personal demands on women at lower parity.
Finally, I should note that, given the small sample size of the 45+ age group, I
have chosen to ignore the results in the corresponding age panel, but have displayed
them here for completeness.
Table 5 should not be taken as definite evidence for a causal relation between
intensity of worry regarding HIV infection and number of births in the interval between
Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. Both `childbearing' and `worry' may be associated because of
their common link to another trait of the respondent which is not considered in this
analysis, for instance the behavior of the husband. Women suspicious of their husband
engaging in extra-marital sex might be subject to higher worry of contracting the HIV
virus. At the same time they might experience a lower frequency of intercourse due to
reduced sexual interest in them, which would explain their lower fertility.
In the following paragraphs of this paper, I use multivariate ordered cumulative
logit regression to model the association of worry about the HIV/AIDS epidemic with
the number of births during 1998-2001 with an aim to confirm the preliminary evidence
in support of the childbearing-reducing hypothesis.
Table 6 presents the results of the regression analysis. The dependent variable is
the number of births obtained between 1998 and 2001. Seven models are displayed,
each one controlling for an additional set of factors derived from standard theoretical
understandings of the determinants of fertility. All control variables are Malawi 1
variables since the models measure the effect of characteristics present in Malawi 1 on
subsequent childbearing. The figures reported in Table 6 are odds ratios modeled over
the higher end of the 0-3 scale for the potential number of births obtained between 1998
and 2001.
Model 1 displays exclusively the variables of interest, namely the worry variables.
While this model undoubtedly suffers from omitted variable bias (Note 7) it, however,
provides results consistent with those previously obtained. Indeed, the presence of
worry seems to be associated with a statistically significant decrease in the number of

births obtained. In addition, as previously predicted, the reduction in between-surveys
fertility associated with worry is fairly large. For any dividing point we choose on the
0-3 scale for the possible number of children born to a respondent between Malawi 1
and Malawi 2, there is a 100*(0.674 ­ 1) or 32.6 percent decrease in the odds of being
above versus being below that dividing point for individuals reporting moderate or high
levels of worry as compared to individuals reporting no worry at all. The reported p-
value for the chi-square test of the proportional odds assumption (i.e. the restriction
imposed on the data in order to fit a cumulative ordered multinomial logit model)
supports the assumption that the effect of worry on the logit is identical, regardless of
the point of dichotomization.
Subsequent models attempt to control for potential additional confounding effects
on the number of births between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. Model 2 controls for a
woman's exposure to the risk of pregnancy by using a linear form of the age variable
(Note 8), the woman's parity, an indicator that she was married or in a stable
relationship in both Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 and an indicator that her husband or partner
was present in both Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. The last two variables serve as a rough
proxy for exposure during the interval. The significance, signs and the order of
magnitude of the worry variables are conserved in Model 2. Except for `husband
present in both data collection rounds', all of the controls for exposure to the risk of
pregnancy seem to affect the number of births obtained between 1998 and 2001. The
effect of age is consistent with the results of Table 3 and of the analysis of conditional
probabilities.
Model 3 controls for social and cultural variables including religion, tribe and
region. However, due to high correlation between these variables, I choose to retain
only the religion variables. Indeed, roughly speaking, the Southern region consists of
five ethnic groups, the two predominant ones being the Yao and the Chewa. Most
inhabitants of this part of the country are Moslem and/or practice indigenous religions.
The central part of Malawi is populated mainly by Chewa who practice a wider range of
religions, including Catholicism. Finally, Northern Malawians tend to be Tumbuka and
typically practice Protestantism. Table A1 (Appendix A) presents a correlation matrix
for the religion and tribe variables. The results of Model 3 show that the Moslem
variable is highly significant and has a strong positive effect on the number of births
between surveys. In this model, the coefficients on the worry variables remain
significant and retain their negative sign. Note, however, that Model 3 presents a
noticeably stronger effect of `being very worried' (45.5% reduction in the odds of being
at the higher end of the scale for the number of births versus being at the lower end of
the scale) than of `being a little worried' (35.4% reduction).
Model 4 controls for the educational experience and the opportunity cost of a
woman's time by including a variable tracking whether she ever attended school.
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 333
School attendance has a negative effect on the odds of having a higher number of births
versus having a lower number of births, but is not significant. The coefficients of the
worry variables remain virtually identical to those in Model 3.
Model 5 controls for the effect of family planning by including variables for the
general usage in the woman's community and for a woman's usage in Malawi 1. Again,
this last variable was the best available proxy for usage during the interval. As would
have been expected, women using family planning in 1998 experienced a reduction (-
11.5%) in the odds of having a relatively large number of births between surveys versus
having a relatively small number of births between surveys. Importantly, while both the
worry variables have retained their sign and their magnitude, only the `very worried
variable' remains marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value 0.06).
Model 6 controls for the availability of and integration in HIV/AIDS social
networks. The MDICP dataset contains information on whether or not the respondent
has talked with her husband or partner about HIV and on the number of people she has
`chatted with about HIV'. In addition, I create an HIV/AIDS network index which
tracks the number of positive responses to questions inquiring whether the respondent
has ever a) heard a talk at the clinic/hospital about protection against HIV/AIDS, b)
heard a radio program about protection against HIV/AIDS, and c) been visited by health
personnel in her home with information about protection against HIV/AIDS. Because
the AIDS network index is strongly correlated with the `talked with husband about
HIV' variable (see Table A2 in Appendix A), I drop the latter variable in Model 6. The
control variables introduced in this model do not seem to have much of an effect on the
number of births Malawi 1 and Malawi 2. In addition, the `very worried' variable
remains strongly associated with a reduction in the odds of being at the higher end of
the number of births scale as opposed to being at the lower end of this scale (37.1%
reduction) and is marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value 0.06). On the other
hand, the `worried a little' variable remains statistically insignificant with, however, a
relatively large magnitude.
Model 7 is the full model. In addition to the classical control variables previously
introduced, it takes into account a woman's income and her household's asset value.
Besides variables tracking whether or not the respondent earns some income and is
financially independent, I create an index for the household's asset value. This items
index is a count of the number of positive responses to a series of questions inquiring
whether the household possess a bed with mattress, a radio, a bicycle, a pit latrine and a
paraffin lamp. Once again, the effect of these control variables is not statistically
significant. Nevertheless, the `very worried' and the `worried a little' variables of
interest have retained their magnitude and sign characteristics in this last model. Higher
intensities of worry are associated with strong decreases in the odds of having a larger
number of births between 1998 and 2001 as opposed to having a smaller number of
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
334 http://www.demographic-research.org
births in the same time frame (the decrease in the odds is 28.7% and 38.9% for the
`worried a little' and `worried a lot' variables respectively). Finally, while the `worried
a little' variable does not reach statistical significance, the `very worried' variable is
marginally significant at the 0.05 level with a p-value of exactly 0.05.
The results just presented are at least partially confirmed when the worry and
childbearing variables are modified or measured in a slightly different fashion. Table 7
presents odds ratios obtained from fitting multivariate ordered cumulative logit
regressions (Models A and B) and logistic regression (Model C) to three different
models where such alternative measures of worry and childbearing are considered. For
all three of these models, the control variables are identical to those considered in
Model 7 (see Table 6). Models A and B in Table 7 also retain the outcome variable
considered so far, i.e. the number of births obtained between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.
Model A considers the association between a dichotomized version of the worry
variable and the number of births between survey rounds. In this model, the worry
variable, thus opposes `no worry' to `some worry'. The results indicate that `some
worry' is associated with a 36.8% decrease in the odds of having a relatively large
number of children in 1998-2001 versus having a relatively small number of children in
that interval. Again, this coefficient is marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value
0.05). Model A thus provides some support for the results obtained using the original
set of worry variables (see Model 7, Table 6).
Model B measures a woman's worry through her level of concern regarding her
husband's extra-marital relationships. Dummy variables were created tracking whether
the woman: a) knows, b) suspects, c) can't know and d) does not think that her husband
has sexual relations with other women. The last variable (`does not think that her
husband has sexual relations with other women') is used as a reference category.
Interestingly, knowing, suspecting and not being able to know that one's husband has
sexual relationships with other women are all associated with a negative effect on the
odds of being at the higher end of the number of births scale versus being at the lower
end of the scale (the odds are reduced by 16.1%, 29.8% and 9.1% for the `know',
`suspect' and `not able to know' variables respectively). However, none of these three
variables appears to be significant. The finding that the `know' variable is of a smaller
magnitude than the suspect variable is not contradictory with the hypothesis that high
levels of worry negatively influence the number of births between Malawi 1 and
Malawi 2. In fact, knowing that one's husband has sexual relations with other women is
not necessarily synonymous to being worried about HIV/AIDS since these sexual
partners are likely to be trusted co-wives. On the other hand, the finding that the
`suspect' variable matters relatively more indicates that less legitimate extra-marital

of births obtained between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.
b In Model B worry is measured as a woman's level of concern regarding her husband's extra-marital relations. The outcome variable
is the number of births obtained between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2.
c In Model C worry is measured with the original worry variables (see Table 6). The estimated outcome variable is a dummy variable
tracking whether or not the respondent has had at least one birth since Malawi 1. The model predicts a value of 1 on the dummy
variable (i.e. the respondent had a child since Malawi 1)
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
336 http://www.demographic-research.org
sexual relationships, -- which are likely to involve unknown and mistrusted women and
are thus potentially more worrisome to the wife--, have a greater effect on the number
of births obtained between data collection rounds.
Finally, a third model (Model C) measured a woman's between-survey
childbearing based on retrospective estimates of the timing of her latest birth. Using the
Malawi 2 question: `When was your last child born' I created a dummy variable
tracking whether or not the respondent had had at least one birth since Malawi 1. In
Model C I revert back to the original measurement of a woman's level of worry. The
results of Model C indicate that women who were moderately worried in 1998 had
28.7% lower odds of having at least one child between surveys (note that the coefficient
is not statistically significant). Similarly, being very worried in 1998 is associated with
a reduction of 38.9% in the odds of having had at least one birth between Malawi 1 and
Malawi 2. This effect is marginally significant at the .05 level (p-value 0.05). In sum,
the direction of the relationship between worry and between-survey childbearing in
Model C is again consistent with the hypothesis of reduced childbearing in the presence
of concern regarding HIV infection elicited by previous results.
5. Discussion: Pathways for the association between HIV/AIDS
worry and childbearing
Two main results emerge from this study. First, rural Malawian women's chances
of having had a given number of births between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2 are related to
their worry regarding a possible HIV infection. In accordance with the expectations of
the hypothesis of reduced childbearing in the presence of fears related to the HIV/AIDS
epidemic, I have found some evidence suggesting that women who are worried about
HIV infection have smaller odds of having a relatively large number of births between
data collection rounds as compared to women who reported no worry. This finding is
particularly true in the case of women who indicated strong levels of concern regarding
their future HIV status. The present research does not provide any support for the
hypothesis of increased childbearing in the presence of worry regarding HIV infection.
Second, the finding that moderate and high levels of worry seem to be associated
with reductions in childbearing should be differentiated by age. Women in the 15-24
age range seem to be less subject to the childbearing depressing effect of increased
worry regarding HIV/AIDS than women in the older age categories. An ordered
multinomial logit regression of the number of births between 1998 and 2001 on worry
differentiating by age reveals that young women's worry is associated with increases in
the odds of having a relatively large number of between-survey births while older
women's worry is associated with a decrease in the same odds (results not shown). I
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
http://www.demographic-research.org 337
have speculated that a possible explanation lies in the presence of strong childbearing
promoting social norms and personal behavior among women in their early years of
childbearing. It is possible that such fertility enhancing forces might include the desire
for children, the socially defining role of motherhood or the inability to resist a
partner's desire for children (Acsadi and Johnson-Acsadi 1990).
Given the current state of knowledge on the relationship between worry regarding
HIV infection and childbearing, it is difficult to make conclusive remarks on the
mechanisms underlying the reduction in childbearing associated with concern for a
possible HIV infection. More research is needed in order to explore the channels
through which worry affects childbearing and to establish its direct as well as indirect
influences on the underlying proximate determinants of fertility.
Among all proximate determinants of fertility, concern regarding future HIV
infection is most likely to lead to a lowered frequency of intercourse while individuals
attempt to protect themselves against the virus. The MDICP datasets did not collect
information that would allow me to specifically test this hypothesis. However, some
insight can be gained from assuming that women's suspicion regarding their husband's
extra-marital sexual relations serves as a predictor of their frequency of intercourse.
While such an assumption ignores issues of distribution of power and social pressures
in the decision to engage in sexual activity, suspicion that one's husband is unfaithful
can nevertheless be thought of as a reasonable rough proxy for frequency of intercourse
for the purpose of this preliminary analysis. Only 14% of those respondents interviewed
in Malawi 1 who indicated not being worried about a possible HIV infection also
reported knowing or suspecting that their husbands were sexually unfaithful. On the
other hand, 30% of respondents with some concern that they may become infected with
HIV in the future indicated that they suspected or knew their husbands to have extra-
marital sexual relations. This data thus seems to indicate an association between worry
regarding HIV infection and knowledge or suspicion of one's husband's extra-marital
affairs which is consistent with the hypothesis of reduced frequency of intercourse in
the presence of concern for becoming infected with HIV.
Other proximate determinants likely to mediate the relationship between worry
regarding HIV infection and childbearing include the use of contraceptives, particularly
condoms. Indeed, as the effects of the AIDS epidemic become increasingly recognized
and as individuals take advice from public education campaigns, increases in the use of
condoms are likely to be observed (Agha 2001; Glor and Severy 1990). Establishing the
link between condom use and childbearing is, however, a delicate matter, since those
most receptive to warnings about the risks of HIV infection may also be those who have
earlier accepted advice regarding the desirability of family planning and births
limitation. In addition, a possible pathway for the effect of worry regarding HIV
infection on childbearing points to an increased number of induced abortions. This
Demographic Research ­ Special Collection 1: Article 10
-- Social Interactions and HIV/AIDS in Rural Africa --
338 http://www.demographic-research.org
hypothesis is built on the fairly common assumption that aborted fetuses are not
reported as children ever born. Increased occurrences of abortions could be related to
fear that the infant will be infected or that the mother and/or relatives will be unable to
provide adequately for the child. Finally, although the MDICP interviewed only ever
married women, it is also possible that among non-married women, high intensities of
worry would result in diminished exposure to the risk of pregnancy through reductions
in the proportions of women every marrying. There is evidence that some women will
respond to the HIV/AIDS epidemic by remaining single (Barnett and Blaikie 1992).
However, it is difficult to isolate the impact of the HIV/AIDS epidemic on decisions to
marry from that of further socio-economic development.

Notes
1. UNAIDS estimated to 800,000 the number of people living with the HIV virus in
Malawi in 1999. The HIV prevalence rate among adults was estimated at 15.96% at
the same date (for further information, see
http://www.unaids.org/epidemic_update/report/Final_Table_Eng_Xcel.xls).
2. It is possible that even a substantial HIV/AIDS impact would be difficult to
distinguish from other influences on childbearing such as urbanization, education,
economic development and changes in gender roles (Notestein 1953; Thompson
1930). These processes are also liable to interact with the HIV/AIDS epidemic in
determining the nature of childbearing-related behavioral changes.
3. The data can be found on the internet at the following address:
http://www.ssc.upenn.edu/Social_Networks/. Additional information regarding the
dataset can be found at the same address.
4. The original dataset that I used to generate the number of births between Malawi 1
and Malawi 2 was not purged of its implausible or improbable responses. In other
words, unrealistic figures for the `number of children ever given birth to' were not
cleaned, set as missing or imputed by the survey team who collected and coded the
data. On the basis of this original dataset, about 14% of figures that I obtained for
the number of births between 1998 and 2001 were judged unrealistic. I checked the
paper questionnaires in order to confirm that these unrealistic figures were not the
result of coding or programming errors.
5. Negative values for the number of births between 1998 and 2001 are obviously not
possible. Therefore, the lower boundary for the between survey childbearing range
was set to 0. In the approximately 36 months between Malawi 1 and Malawi 2,
women were `permitted' 3 children at most. This slightly liberal figure was chosen
taking into account periods of temporary sterility in the form of post-partum
amenorrhea and the possibility of a woman giving birth to twins or to triplets. All
values obtained from the original (raw) dataset which were outside the 0-3 range
were set to missing. No imputation technique was used to remedy the missing data
problem created by forcing the number of births to a 0-3 range. I made this
decision in order to avoid attributing a more or less arbitrary value of replacement
to a deleted data point.
6. Unfortunately, the 1998 round of data collection did not ask respondents about
their HIV/AIDS risk (i.e. their probability of currently being infected with HIV).
However, the topic was explored in Malawi 2.

7. Omitted variable bias refers to a model misspecification error whereby variables
are excluded from the model, although they should in reality be included. It can
potentially have fairly serious consequences since the coefficients are no longer
guaranteed to be unbiased.
8. Non-linear forms of the age variables were tested for. They were, however, not
retained as they appeared not to be significant.
