Abstract: Although health psychologists' efforts to understand and promote health are
most effective when guided by theory, health psychology has not taken full advantage of
theoretical insights provided by evolutionary psychology. Here, we argue that evolutionary
perspectives can fruitfully inform strategies for addressing some of the challenges facing
health psychologists. Evolutionary psychology's emphasis on modular, functionally
specialized psychological systems can inform approaches to understanding the myriad
behaviors grouped under the umbrella of "health," as can theoretical perspectives used by
evolutionary anthropologists, biologists, and psychologists (e.g., Life History Theory). We
detail some early investigations into evolutionary health psychology, and we provide
suggestions for directions for future research.

Introduction
The consequences of poor health are among the most significant challenges
currently facing Western nations. In 2012, health care costs in the U.S. are estimated to be
2.8 trillion dollars. By 2020, they are estimated to surpass 4.6 trillion dollars (Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services, 2011). Investigations into the factors that are associated
with health-enhancing or health-compromising behaviors thus have great practical utility.
Indeed, a commentary recently published in Nature documented the results of a meeting
organized by the U.S. National Science Foundation in which social scientists were asked to
identify "grand challenge questions that are both foundational and transformative." The
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology

number one priority on this list of grand challenges was "How to induce people to take care
of their health" (Giles, 2011).
Health psychology has emerged as a field of inquiry aimed at understanding the
psychological factors that shape health-relevant behaviors. Health psychologists often
appeal to social cognitive models of behavior, and the constructs within them, to
understand, predict, and change behavior. The success of these efforts can be viewed from
a glass-half-full perspective. Meta-analytic reports demonstrate that many of these model
development efforts result in small to moderate amounts of variance in behavior accounted
for (McEachan et al., 2011) and some success at behavior change (Webb and Sheeran,
2006), and interventions that have a basis in these theories are typically more successful
than those that do not (Painter et al., 2008). For example, theory-based interventions to
decrease risky sexual behavior have been shown to increase condom use and decrease
sexually transmitted infections in high risk populations (e.g., Bryan, Schmiege, and
Broaddus, 2009; DiClemente et al., 2009), and interventions to increase physical activity
have had some success, particularly for the initiation of physical activity among sedentary
individuals (Marcus et al., 2007; King et al., 2007).
One could also view the success of these efforts from a glass-half-empty
perspective. Current efforts to change health behavior are, in most domains, unsuccessful.
An obesity epidemic continues in Western countries and is rapidly expanding across the
globe (James, 2008). This, combined with sedentary lifestyle--another epidemic--
contributes to extensive morbidity and mortality from cancer (Calle et al., 2003), heart
disease (Manson et al., 1990), and type II diabetes (Dandona et al., 2004). HIV/AIDS
continues to decimate young people's lives around the world, and more common sexually
transmitted infections (e.g., Chlamydia trachomatis, Neisseria gonnorrhoeae) increase the
risk of sterility and other negative health outcomes (Hillis et al., 1997). Despite public
health efforts, approximately 25% of Americans still smoke cigarettes (Fiore et al., 2008),
and only 5% of Americans achieve recommended levels of physical activity (Troiano et al.,
2008). Even when interventions change behavior initially, behavioral change is difficult to
maintain (King et al., 2009; Johnson et al., 2010). In sum, current approaches to
understanding and improving health behavior have substantial room for improvement
(McBride et al., 2012).
We propose that, just as evolutionary theory has significantly influenced the way
that psychologists understand topics such as morality (DeScioli and Kurzban, in press),
sexuality (Thornhill and Gangestad, 2008), and cooperation (Cosmides and Tooby, 1992),
it can add critical insights into how we understand, predict, and change health behavior. In
this paper, we first comment on the evolved psychology of health. We then provide
examples of theoretical perspectives and research programs used by evolutionary
psychologists that may help generate novel hypotheses for understanding health behavior
and, ultimately, construct novel interventions.
Evolution and Health
Since 1948, the World Health Organization has defined health as "a state of
complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology

infirmity." Major lines of inquiry within health psychology thus investigate a broad range
of behaviors, including smoking, exercise, diet, cancer screening, and safer sex. In our
review of theory and findings related to health, then, we address varied aspects of human
evolved psychology that could influence each of these areas.
At first blush, it may seem reasonable to suggest that humans should have an
evolved motivation to be healthy. After all, individuals in good health would be expected to
survive longer and reproduce more than individuals in poor health. Such assumptions of
domain general psychological mechanisms that function to avoid disease and death or
pursue health implicitly or explicitly underlie existing theoretical perspectives within health
psychology (e.g., terror management health model, health belief model; Goldenberg and
Arndt, 2008; Rosenstock, 1974). However, natural selection is not expected to favor traits
that maximize "survival" or "health." Indeed, under many conditions, selection may favor
phenotypes that are uncorrelated with or even negatively correlated with longevity and
health (Getty, 2002; Kokko et al., 2002). Life history theory has developed to describe and
understand the manner in which organisms allocate finite energetic resources and time to
fitness-relevant systems such as somatic development and maintenance, intrasexual
competition, courtship, child-rearing, etc. (these are sometimes categorized into domains of
"somatic" and "reproductive" efforts; see Charnov, 1993; Stearns, 1989). Selection should
not favor the development of phenotypes that maximally invest in "health" processes,
because the costs of these investments come at the expense of lifetime reproductive
success.
Motivating Health is Not a Plausible Evolved Psychological Function
Instead of evolving to motivate general adaptive behavior such as "avoid death,"
"reproduce," or "be healthy," psychological adaptations are designed to take specific
information from the environment, process that information, and output behaviors that were
probabilistically adaptive in the environments in which they evolved (e.g., Tooby and
Cosmides, 1992, 2005; Barrett and Kurzban, 2006). Selection is expected to favor modular,
domain specific information processing systems over abstract, domain general systems for
several reasons. We mention two. First, just as organs that are specialized to perform
distinct tasks (e.g., circulate blood, filter wastes, produce gametes) have evolved instead of
a "master organ" that generally functions to "survive," psychological systems that are
functionally specialized have a selective advantage over domain general systems. The
systems that detect kinship and motivate incest avoidance, for example, use a different set
of cues and lead to different behavioral outputs than the systems that detect infectious
microbes and motivate pathogen avoidance (Lieberman et al., 2007; Tybur, Lieberman,
Kurzban, and DeScioli, in press). It is implausible that a master drive to pursue "health"
governs all (or, indeed, any) of the myriad health relevant behaviors in the modern
environment. Instead, the psychological mechanisms that influence some health-relevant
behaviors (e.g., drinking alcohol) likely operate distinctly from the systems influencing
other health-relevant behaviors (e.g., getting regular cervical exams).
Second, to fulfill domain general functions such as "avoid death" or "promote
health," psychological mechanisms would require what has been referred to as "fitness
teleology" (Tooby and Cosmides, 1992, 2005; Symons, 1989). That is, organisms would
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -858-
need to know the long-term health outcomes of specific behaviors, and they would need to
act in the specific manners that optimize such outcomes. This is certainly not the case with
other fitness relevant behaviors. For example, no psychological mechanism functions to
motivate "reproduction"--otherwise, men would be strongly motivated to donate sperm,
women would be motivated to donate eggs, and both sexes would be stridently opposed to
any form of contraception. Instead, in the mating domain, functionally specific mechanisms
assess qualities that have reliably correlated with mate value in conspecifics and output
attraction to those conspecifics (e.g., if I am a man, be attracted to females with cues to
fertility and genetic quality and compatibility; if I am a woman, be attracted to men with
cues to genetic quality and compatibility and intrasexual competitive ability), which in turn
enacts the series of behaviors that probabilistically led to conception in the environment in
which the psychological adaptations evolved.
The existence of (preventable) health epidemics related to obesity, sexually
transmitted infections, and lifestyle oriented cancers is difficult to reconcile with a
perspective positing the existence of a quasi-teleological motivation to engage in "healthy"
behaviors. Instead, it suggests that we have an evolved psychology that, while influencing
health in the 21st century, does not primarily function to motivate good or bad health.
Rather than flipping a master "health" switch, different types of health behaviors likely
respond to different inputs, and, critically, different types of interventions. Applying this
perspective may meaningfully advance how we understand health behavior and how we
might encourage change. We now explore a few examples of theoretical perspectives and
hypothesized psychological systems that may be useful in understanding health-relevant
behavior.
Life History Theory and Health
As stated previously, life history theory aims to understand the manner in which
organisms allocate finite energy budgets toward different fitness-relevant systems. Based
on environmental and phenotypic conditions, individuals may follow different life history
strategies--that is, different strategic resource allocations. This perspective may be useful
for understanding, predicting, and changing a number of health behaviors. Here we address
physical activity (exercise), a health behavior that directly addresses strategic uses of
energy.
In modern Western societies, which are largely sedentary, physical activity is
associated with a variety of positive health outcomes (Warburton, Nicol, and Bredin, 2006).
In the calorie-limited environments in which the psychological systems influencing
exercise evolved, however, rigorous or sustained physical activity entailed substantial
direct energetic costs, as well as costs related to the development and maintenance of
metabolically expensive muscle tissue. Some exertion provided offsetting benefits, such as
running down prey, migrating and foraging over long distances, and protecting self and kin
from predators and violent conspecifics. Hence, the psychology of physical activity should
lead humans to be selectively active, with activity varying as a function of ecological and
phenotypic conditions.
One of the major costs of exertion is increased vulnerability to long-term calorie
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -859-
deficit. When individuals develop in environments indicative of relatively high risk of
calorie deficit, they may conserve energy by reducing activity. Human and non-human
animal literature is consistent with this perspective. For example, in a meta-analysis of 13
Scandanavian birth cohorts, lower than normal birth weight--potentially a cue to caloric
stress in adulthood--was related to lower leisure time physical activity later in life
(Andersen, 2009). In another study, low birth weight was not associated with
cardiorespiratory fitness, but was related to a higher energy cost of running (Baraldi et al.,
1991). In rats, mothers' undernourishment--potentially a cue to resource availability in the
environment--predicts offspring physical activity regardless of post-natal food availability,
with offspring of malnourished mothers being less active (Vickers et al., 2003). Taken
together, this suggests that life history strategies calibrated during early development may
influence physical activity in adulthood. This framework could be used to predict who will
be at risk for low activity later in life. Moreover, future work in this area could develop
different interventions for increasing exercise depending on calibrated life history strategy.
This framework can also elucidate sex differences in the psychology of exercise.
Given the higher metabolic demands associated with pregnancy and lactation (up to 700
more kcals/day) physical activity in women is associated with higher trade-offs with
reproductive effort. Indeed, research has shown that women's fecundity decreases with
increased energy expenditure (Ellison, 2003), and that the postnatal period of lactational
amenorrhea is sensitive to energy expenditure (Ellison, 2008). Men's reproductive
physiology, on the other hand, is generally less energetically costly and more robust in the
face of reductions in energy availability or increases in energy expenditure. The quantity
and quality of sperm production, for example, appears to be insensitive to short term
changes in energy availability (Bribiescas, 2006). Epidemiological data on current exercise
behavior are consistent with a higher cost for women of being physically active, as women
reliably report lower levels of physical activity than men (Buckworth and Dishman, 2007).
Interventions targeting increased exercise may thus be maximally effective if they tailor
interventions to evolved, sex-specific psychologies.
Life history theory may also inform individual differences in a variety of other
health-relevant behaviors. Human life history strategies vary along a continuum. Some
individuals allocate effort in a "slower" manner, with a focus on investment in embodied
capital, maintenance, and delayed reproduction, and some individuals allocating effort in a
"faster" manner, with greater allocations toward earlier reproduction and mating effort
(Ellis et al., 2009). Early life experiences hypothesized to shape life history strategies (e.g.,
environmental instability) relate to a number of indices of risk in early adulthood, including
age of sexual debut, number of sexual partners, and criminal activity (Belsky, Schlomer,
and Ellis, 2012; Simpson et al., 2012). Other early life experiences (e.g., family
socioeconomic status) appear to shape the manner in which people respond to ecological
threats later in life, with individuals from lower socioeconomic backgrounds responding to
cues to mortality threat by taking more financial risks, discounting the future, and reporting
wanting children earlier (Griskevicius et al., 2011a,b). If certain health behaviors reflect
greater investment in slow versus fast life history strategies, interventions could target
individuals likely to engage in such behaviors based on relevant risk factors (e.g., stability
of childhood environment), and could tailor intervention content to slow versus fast
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology

strategists (Ellis et al., 2012). Further, such an appreciation for the role of early
developmental context could provide a more coherent understanding of the co-morbidity of
a number of health risk behaviors (e.g., early sexual debut, substance abuse, impulsive
behavior) than perspectives that assume such behaviors are associated simply because
adolescents seek to be "deviant" or are the result of association with deviant peers (c.f.
Jessor et al., 1995).
Psychological Systems for Courtship and Competition
Under a life history theory framework, investment in mating often comes at the
expense of investment in maintenance, survival, and, ultimately, health. Such tradeoffs
between fertility and mortality can reflect behavioral tradeoffs--tactics used to improve
intrasexual competitive ability. A collection of research demonstrates shifts toward costly
mating tactics during periods of life in which intrasexual competition is high (e.g., Wilson
and Daly, 1985) or after experimental primes indicative of mating opportunities (e.g.,
Griskevicius et al., 2009). These costs may extend to behaviors that enhance courtship or
intrasexual competitive ability at the expense of health. Hill and Durante (2008) describe
evidence supporting this perspective. Women who were primed with intrasexual
competition reported a greater willingness to tan and take diet pills, both of which
presumably increase women's intrasexual competitive ability at the expense of health.
However, this shift in health risk intentions did not extend to other health risks presumably
unrelated to courtship and competition (taking cough syrup as a sleeping aid and painting in
an unventilated room).
Psychological mechanisms underpinning intrasexual competition have also been
proposed as influencing eating disorders (see Ferguson et al., 2011). This hypothesis
generally takes two forms. One suggests that women may strategically suppress their own
fertility when intrasexual competition is intense by under eating, because such competition
may be associated with lowered offspring viability. The other suggests that restricted eating
in Western societies may be a strategy for increasing physical attractiveness and
outcompeting others for mates. Both hypotheses have received some empirical support
(e.g., Li et al., 2010; Salmon et al., 2008)
The psychological systems underpinning courtship and intrasexual competition may
also increase some healthy behaviors. In U.S. samples, men and women exercise in ways
that target physical attractiveness in a sex-specific manner (Jonason, 2007; Mealy, 1997).
Interventions could capitalize on the connection between exercise and mating psychology,
particularly during periods of life associated with intense competition for mates. Further, if
courtship and intrasexual competition psychology influences both unhealthy (e.g., tanning)
and healthy (e.g., exercising) behaviors, future research could investigate methods for
encouraging one strategy over the other.
Psychological Systems for Neutralizing Pathogens
Recent studies concerning the "behavioral immune system"--psychological
adaptations that function to neutralize pathogens--have addressed topics ranging from
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -861-
personality to xenophobia and social cognition (see Schaller and Park, 2011, for a review).
Given that many of the issues tackled by health psychologists concern infectious diseases
(e.g., HIV) or behaviors that are regulated by pathogen-avoidance mechanisms (e.g.,
eating), an application of this literature and theory may prove useful to health psychology.
We consider two such behaviors below: eating and sexual decision making.
The mouth is a vulnerable point through which pathogens can enter the body and
wreak havoc. Each act of eating puts an individual at risk for ingesting pathogens housed
within food (e.g., roundworms in pork) or on food (e.g., food that has been coughed on by a
contagious conspecific). Hence, some of the psychological mechanisms influencing dietary
decisions likely function to neutralize pathogens (Fessler and Navarrete, 2003; Flaxman
and Sherman, 2000; Rozin and Fallon, 1987). Tybur et al. (in press) suggest that pathogen-
avoidance behaviors are triggered when systems weighing several factors (e.g., likelihood
of pathogen presence; expected costs of infection; expected benefits of engaging in the
potentially infectious behavior) estimate the net expected value of contact with an object as
especially low. Dietary interventions could target some of these putative inputs, such as
likelihood of pathogen presence. For example, interventions designed to reduce
consumption of meats processed by industrial farming could create a link between the food
product and a pathogen cue, such as fecal contamination (e.g., Pollan, 2006).
Like eating, sexual intercourse allows microorganisms a route through which to
enter and colonize the body. Some microorganisms--sexually transmitted infections
(STI's)--have evolved to take advantage of this route of transmission. Given sufficient
education on the risks of STI's, an optimal strategy for those who wish to minimize STI
risk would be to simply abstain from intercourse. The enduring prevalence of sexual
interactions in the face of such information suggests that the psychological systems that
motivate sexual behavior are not governed by such rational infection concerns. Barrier
methods (e.g., condoms) have been developed to mitigate the most infectious aspects of
penile-vaginal intercourse (i.e., exchange of sexual fluids) while accommodating the
evolved psychological systems that motivate sex. Nevertheless, people use condoms at a
suboptimal level for avoiding STI's, and increasing condom use is a major goal within
health psychology.
Condoms are not used for a variety of reasons, including the social stigma
associated with purchasing, carrying, and using condoms, and the smell and sensation of
sex with condoms (Bryan, Schindeldecker, and Aiken, 2001). They are used to some extent
because people are able to associate their use with decreased risk of STI transmission and,
perhaps even more, appreciate their pregnancy prevention effectiveness (Cooper, Agocha,
and Powers, 1999). To increase condom use, then, interventions must either attenuate the
costs associated with condoms (e.g., increasing sensation), or increase the net benefits of
using condoms. Such benefits could conceivably be increased by increasing perceptions of
vulnerability to HIV and other STI's. However, rational perceptions of vulnerability to
STI's relate weakly and inconsistently to condom intentions (Gerrard, Gibbons, and
Bushman, 1996), and having previously had an STI and receiving STI education are
negatively related and unrelated to condom intentions, respectively (Sheeran and Taylor,
1999). Moreover, decades of research have demonstrated that increasing fear of STIs is not
an effective intervention strategy for motivating safer sexual behavior (Albarracín et al.,
Evolutionary perspective on health psychology
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(5). 2012. -862-
2005). Tybur et al. (2011) recently suggested that, although attempts to manipulate
objective fear of STI's may not influence condom use, the psychological systems
functioning to neutralize pathogens--and, critically, the ecological cues indicating
pathogen presence--might. They found that participants exposed to olfactory cues to
pathogens (notably, pathogens that are not specific to STI's) reported greater intentions to
use condoms over the next six months than participants in a control condition. These
findings suggest that psychological systems that evolved to detect pathogens--part of a
"behavioral immune system"--may play an important role in decisions relevant to sexual
health. Future interventions designed to increase condom use--or to encourage other sexual
health behaviors that may be influenced by pathogen-avoidance psychology--may
capitalize on this connection.
Future Investigations into Evolutionary Health Psychology
A marriage between evolutionary psychology and health psychology can yield
substantial benefits to both areas. Evolutionary psychologists interested in topics such as
courtship, intrasexual competition, energy allocation, and pathogen-avoidance may gain
critical insights into the psychology of these domains by incorporating health-relevant
measures into their investigations. Health psychologists interested in maximizing the
explanatory power of theories and the utility of interventions over disparate arrays of health
problems may find the modular perspective used by evolutionary psychologists helpful.
We generally suggest that these efforts can take two forms. First, although it is
increasingly recognized that the "one-size-fits-all" interventions commonly utilized in
health psychology are suboptimal (Seefeldt, Malina, and Clark, 2002), health psychologists
have not been terribly successful in uncovering the critical factors that will define which
interventions have maximal utility for which groups (Cahill, Lancaster, and Green, 2010).
An evolutionary perspective can be used to categorize individuals into such groups, and to
inform what types of interventions would be effective for these groups. Second,
evolutionary perspectives can identify which specific inputs (e.g., cues to intrasexual
competition; cues to pathogens) may affect which health behaviors. These inputs are
critically important in the development of intervention content.
In this paper, we have offered a few suggestions of how lines of research pursued
by evolutionary psychologists have informed health behavior and can inform health
behavior further. This is only the tip of the iceberg. Though we have not reviewed in any
detail behaviors such as smoking, dental care, cancer screening, binge drinking, substance
abuse, and adherence to medications, all of these are strongly related to health outcomes
and could be informed by an evolutionary perspective. Our attempts at increasing health
behavior and decreasing risk behavior may have reached something of a glass ceiling of
effectiveness. It is now time to apply innovative methods and novel perspectives if we hope
to shatter that glass ceiling and have meaningful and sustained impact on morbidity and
mortality. An evolutionary psychological perspective, with its carefully articulated theories
of evolved psychological structure and function, is likely to be a highly fruitful avenue to
pursue as we seek to promote optimal physical, mental and social well-being, and not
simply the absence of disease.
