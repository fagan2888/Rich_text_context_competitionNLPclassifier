Abstract
Purpose in life predicts both health and longevity suggesting that the ability to find meaning from life's experiences,
especially when confronting life's challenges, may be a mechanism underlying resilience. Having purpose in life may
motivate reframing stressful situations to deal with them more productively, thereby facilitating recovery from stress and
trauma. In turn, enhanced ability to recover from negative events may allow a person to achieve or maintain a feeling of
greater purpose in life over time. In a large sample of adults (aged 36-84 years) from the MIDUS study (Midlife in the U.S.,
http://www.midus.wisc.edu/), we tested whether purpose in life was associated with better emotional recovery following
exposure to negative picture stimuli indexed by the magnitude of the eyeblink startle reflex (EBR), a measure sensitive to
emotional state. We differentiated between initial emotional reactivity (during stimulus presentation) and emotional
recovery (occurring after stimulus offset). Greater purpose in life, assessed over two years prior, predicted better recovery
from negative stimuli indexed by a smaller eyeblink after negative pictures offset, even after controlling for initial reactivity
to the stimuli during the picture presentation, gender, age, trait affect, and other well-being dimensions. These data suggest
a proximal mechanism by which purpose in life may afford protection from negative events and confer resilience is through
enhanced automatic emotion regulation after negative emotional provocation.

Introduction
Growing evidence from epidemiological research suggests that
self-reported psychological well-being is important for both health
and longevity, potentially through mechanisms promoting resil-
ience in the face of adversity (see [1,2] for recent theoretical
reviews). Ryff defined psychological well-being in terms of six key
dimensions: autonomy (capacity for self-determination), environ-
mental mastery (ability to manage one's surrounding world),
personal growth (realization of potential), positive relations with
others (high-quality relationships), purpose in life (meaning and
direction in life), and self-acceptance (positive self-regard) [3,4].
Higher levels of purpose in life, personal growth, and positive
relations have been linked to lower cardiovascular risk (lower
glycosylated hemoglobin, lower weight, lower waist-hip ratios, and
higher ``good'' cholesterol (high-density lipoprotein (HDL)) as well
as better neuroendocrine regulation (lower salivary cortisol
throughout the day) [5]. Higher profiles on purpose in life and
positive relations with others have also been linked to lower
inflammatory factors: interleukin-6 (IL-6) and its soluble receptor
(sIL-64) [6], providing empirical support linking these well-being
dimensions to better health profiles.
Recent evidence suggests that relative to other dimensions of
well-being, purpose in life appears to be particularly important in
predicting future health and mortality. In a prospective, longitu-
dinal, epidemiological study of community-dwelling older persons
without dementia (Rush Memory and Aging Project), greater
purpose in life was associated with better ability to perform day-to-
day activities and less mobility disability in the future [7]. Those
who reported greater purpose in life exhibited better cognition at
follow-up, had a reduced risk of mild cognitive impairment, and a
slower rate of cognitive decline [8]. In fact, people who reported
high levels of purpose in life (90th percentile or higher) were 2.4
times more likely to remain free of Alzheimer Disease than people
who reported low levels (10th percentile or lower). Moreover, on
postmortem examination of the brain for Alzheimer Disease-
related pathology, purpose in life modified the associations
between cognition and both global pathologic change and plaque

accumulation [9], suggesting that having greater purpose in life
may protect against the detrimental effects of aging-related
changes in the brain that have been linked to Alzheimer Disease.
Finally, greater purpose in life was associated with a reduced risk
of mortality from all causes [10]. Collectively, these findings
suggest that the ability to find meaning and direction in life may
help buffer or slow the effects of aging and even the ultimate
outcome: death.
Besides healthier biomarker levels, slowed effects of aging, and
increased longevity, higher levels of psychological well-being have
also been associated with lower rates of depression [3,4,11], with
the dimension of purpose in life consistently showing negative
relations with depressive symptomatology. In fact, people in their
50s who report low psychological well-being are more than twice
as likely to suffer from depression when in their 60s, even after
controlling for previous depression history, personality, demo-
graphic, economic, and physical health variables [12], suggesting
that low well-being is a substantial risk factor for future depression.
Depression is characterized by high levels of brooding, and often is
associated with a ruminative thinking style, and attentional biases
suggesting impaired attentional disengagement from negative
information (see [13,14] for review), which may contribute to
the prolonged responses to negative emotional stimuli that have
been observed both in psychophysiological and neuroimaging
measures, such as prolonged pupil dilations and amygdala
activation [15­18]. The link between low psychological well-being
and the dysregulated emotion observed in depression is further
supported by findings from the neuroimaging literature: those
reporting higher levels of purpose in life show better regulation of
the amygdala (a brain region involved in fear and anxiety-related
processes) by the ventral anterior cingulate cortex, such that
activity in the amygdala is reduced and the ventral anterior
cingulate cortex is activated to a greater extent for negative relative
to neutral pictures [19]. Moreover, high purpose in life was
associated with slower judgments of the valence of negative
relative to neutral pictures, suggesting that persons having goals
and a sense of direction in life appraised the negative pictures as
less salient and potentially less threatening than did persons with
lower levels of purpose in life. Finally, whereas depressive
symptomatology has been linked to decreased gray matter volume
in the insula [20], purpose in life (as well as the other well-being
dimensions of personal growth and positive relations with others)
are positively associated with right insular gray matter volume
[21].
How might purpose in life protect against depression, the body
and brain ravages of growing older, and the accumulated toll of
stress and challenges over the years? Based on the accumulating
evidence, we hypothesize that one mechanism through which high
purpose in life may protect against depression and the wear and
tear of life stress is by providing a buffer from negative events,
promoting reappraisal and motivated coping processes, decreasing
brooding and ruminative thinking styles, supporting faster and
better recovery, and thus increasing resiliency. Therefore, we
hypothesize that higher levels of self-reported purpose in life will
be associated with laboratory measures of emotional recovery,
specifically, better automatic regulation of negative emotion as
exhibited by better recovery from negative emotional stimuli.
Importantly, this hypothesis combines phenomenologically-expe-
rienced aspects of well-being with objectively measured laboratory
assessments of the time course of emotional responses, as this
combination may offer unique windows on adaptive human
functioning.
Heterogeneity is the rule in emotion research, characterized by
large individual differences in how people react to the same
emotional event or stimulus, and in how quickly and easily they
recover from that stimulus (see Figure 1 for a hypothetical
characterization of different emotional time course profiles to the
same stimulus). While one person may briefly feel the effect of an
unpleasant event, another may suffer a lingering and pervasive
effect on mood. These individual differences in emotional
reactivity and regulation constitute a person's affective style (see
[22,23] for theoretical reviews), may be critically influenced by a
person's sense of life purpose, and may also shape how much
purpose and meaning one feels, suggesting bi-directional influ-
ences between these constructs
Affective psychophysiological research provides tools to measure
an individual's affective state without many of the demand
characteristics biasing self-report (for review see [24,25]), allowing
for objective characterization of the time course of an individual's
emotional reactivity to and recovery from an emotion-eliciting
stimulus [26]. Eyeblink reflex magnitude (EBR) measured to an
acoustic startle probe from the orbicularis oculi muscle is emotion-
modulated, such that activity is potentiated in the presence of an
aversive stimulus and is diminished in the presence of a pleasant
stimulus [27,28]. Just as facial musculature recordings reflect a
person's affective state and their emotional response to stimuli, the
temporal resolution possible with the EBR allows for differenti-
ation of aspects of the emotional response from regulation of that
response [26,29,30], providing objective estimates of both the
magnitude and time course of emotional responses during and
following incentives and challenges.
In the current paradigm, EBR measurements were obtained
during the picture presentation period and after picture offset. We
define emotional reactivity as reflected in measurements during the
affective picture presentation when the emotionally evocative
stimulus is present, and emotional recovery as measurements
obtained after picture offset when the stimulus is no longer present.
Parsing the time course in this way allows us to investigate
individual differences in both reactivity and recovery. By including
both the measures of reactivity and recovery in the same analytic
models, we can examine individual differences in our measures
during the recovery period unconfounded by variations in
reactivity. Referring back to Figure 1, imagine two people who
show similar reactions to the negative stimulus when it is present.
One person's regulatory capacities may facilitate quick recovery
from a negative stimulus after it is removed (hypothetical subject
B), while another may perseverate and show delayed recovery
(hypothetical subject A), such as that observed in depression and
dysphoria [15,17,31]. In this way, we can investigate the
differential relationships between emotional reactivity and recov-
ery with higher levels of purpose in life. We predicted that those
subjects who reported higher levels of purpose in life would exhibit
greater emotional recovery from the negative pictures, controlling
for their initial reactivity to these pictures, thereby indicating a
more adaptive emotion regulatory profile.

Review Board at the University of Wisconsin ­ Madison and all
participants provided written consent.
Participants
The Survey of Midlife Development in the United States
(MIDUS) began in 1995 with a national sample of Americans
(N = 7,108) aged 25­74 years [32]. The majority (59.71%) was
recruited through random digit dialing (RDD). The remaining
respondents included siblings of the RDD sample and a large
sample of twins (N = 1,914). Data collection focused on socio-
demographic and psychosocial assessments obtained through
phone interviews and self-administered questionnaires. In 2004,
these survey assessments were repeated (MIDUS II). The retention
rate from MIDUS I to MIDUS II was 75% (adjusted for
mortality).
Psychophysiological data were collected on a subset of MIDUS
II participants living in the Midwest who were able and willing to
travel to our laboratory. The psychophysiology experiment
followed the survey assessment on average over two years later
(mean (SD) = 881 (26) days). A total of 331 (183 female)
participants (age range 36­84 yrs, mean (SD) = 55.41 (11.12)
yrs) agreed to participate in our experiment. For a variety of
technical, responsivity, and other data quality issues, 253 (147
female/106 male; 185 singletons/68 twin or sibling) participants
(age range 36­84 yrs, mean (SD) = 54.68 (10.97) yrs) are included
because they completed the psychological well-being questionnaire
in the survey assessment and provided a total of 10 or more
quantifiable eyeblink responses to the startle probes during the
psychophysiological paradigm.
Data and documentation for MIDUS I and II, including all
MIDUS projects, are publically available at the Inter-university
Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR; www.icpsr.
umich.edu/icpsrweb/landing.jsp).
Well-being
Given the growing focus on purpose in life as a key predictor of
long-term health outcomes and underlying neurophysiology, our
hypotheses targeted this particular dimension of well-being,
although we included examination of all six scales of well-being
collected in the survey assessments in MIDUS II (Scales of
Psychological Well-Being; [3,4]). Purpose in life refers to the
tendency to derive meaning from life's experiences and possess a
sense of intentionality and goal directedness that guides behavior.
The other five dimensions of psychological well-being included
autonomy, environmental mastery, personal growth, positive
relations with others, and self-acceptance. Each scale had seven
items (internal consistency for these scales ranged from.69 to.85).
Other Covariates
Other variables used in the analyses included age at the
psychophysiological session, gender, the total number of valid
eyeblink responses to the startle probes over the course of the
psychophysiology experiment, the lag between the survey and
psychophysiological assessments in days, trait positive and negative
affect measured with the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule
(PANAS; [33]), and subjective well-being measures including the
Satisfaction with Life Scale [34] and an abbreviated version of the
Gratitude Scale [35] asking participants to rate the following two
statements: ``I have so much in life to be thankful for'' and ``I am
grateful to a wide variety of people.'' The affect and subjective
well-being measures were collected at the time of the psychophys-
iology session.
Figure 1. Hypothetical emotional response time courses from four different individuals to an emotionally provocative stimulus,
such as a negatively-valenced picture displayed for 4 s as in the present study. Note that although subjects A and B have similar initial
reactivity during the 4 s picture presentation period, after picture offset they differ in emotional recovery. Subject A shows a prolonged poor recovery,
whereas Subject B recovers more rapidly. Subject C demonstrates greater initial reactivity with rapid recovery, whereas Subject D exemplifies an
individual who may show smaller, blunted emotional reactivity but severely impaired recovery.

Stimuli
A total of 90 International Affective Picture System pictures
(IAPS; [36]) were presented in a randomized sequence. According
to the IAPS normative ratings, 30 negative (mean (SD) = 2.89
(0.61)), 30 neutral (mean (SD) = 5.14 (0.52)) and 30 positive (mean
(SD) = 7.24 (0.44)) pictures were selected, with the positive and
negative pictures matched on arousal (negative pictures mean
(SD) = 5.35 (0.54); neutral mean (SD) = 3.22 (0.73); positive mean
(SD) = 5.23 (0.73)). All valences were matched on luminosity,
complexity, and number of pictures with social content.
Psychophysiological Procedure
The psychophysiological procedures have been described
previously (see [30] for additional details). After informed consent
was obtained, the participant completed questionnaires. The
participant watched the positive, neutral, and negative pictures,
and heard acoustic startle probes (50 ms, 105 dB, white noise
bursts with very rapid onset time) presented through headphones.
Each picture had either a yellow or purple border around it during
the first 500 ms of the picture presentation, and participants
responded as quickly as possible to the color of the border by
pressing one of two keyboard buttons marked with the color with
either their index or middle finger of their dominant hand. This
color border identification task was used to keep subjects' attention
on the task and ensure they looked at the pictures. Pictures were
presented on the screen for 4 s and were preceded by a 1 s fixation
screen (see Figure 2 for a schematic of the psychophysiological
paradigm's design). Acoustic startle probes were inserted at three
time points (randomized across trials to maintain an average inter-
probe interval of , 16 s). One probe occurred during the picture
presentation (2900 ms following picture onset), a 2nd probe
occurred 400 ms after picture offset (4400 ms following picture
onset), and a 3rd probe occurred 1900 ms after picture offset
(5900 ms following picture onset). A total of nine probes at each of
the three time points were presented for each picture valence
category, resulting in three non-probed trials for each picture
valence. Because preliminary data analysis revealed reduced
magnitude EBRs at the 2nd probe (across all valences), these data
were dropped from all further analyses because it suggests the 2nd
probe was affected by prepulse inhibition due to too close temporal
proximity to the picture offset [37]. Participants who did not
respond with a perceptible EBR on 10 or more of the 81-probed
trials were excluded from EBR analyses as they were considered
non-responders to the startle probe.
Analytic Strategy
Manipulation check. We used a linear mixed-effects model
to test the expected valence (negative, neutral, positive) modulation
effect, a main effect of probe time (reactivity, recovery), and a
valence x probe time interaction on EBR magnitude. The model
included a family-specific random effect to account for within-
family dependence between twins and siblings, as well as a
participant-within-family-specific random effect to account for the
within-person dependence between EBR measurements. Pairwise
comparisons between valences (negative, neutral, and positive) and
probe times (reactivity, recovery) were adjusted for multiple
comparisons using the Bonferroni correction.
Tests of purpose in life and the other psychological
well-being dimensions predicting EBR measures of
emotional reactivity and recovery to negative stimuli.
First, zero-order correlations were calculated between purpose in
life and the other five psychological well-being dimensions with
EBR magnitude measures obtained (1) at the reactivity probe, (2)
at the recovery probe, and (3) with a recovery residual reflecting
EBR magnitude at the recovery probe regressed on EBR
magnitude at the reactivity probe to remove variation due to
differences in reactivity (EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe
and the recovery probe are inversely correlated, r = ­0.15,
p = 0.02).
Because age and gender have previously been shown to
influence measures of emotional reactivity and recovery [29,30],
linear mixed-effects models were used to test the ability of each of
the psychological well-being dimensions to predict EBR magni-
tude at the reactivity probe as well as EBR magnitude at the
recovery probe on negative trials, while controlling for EBR
magnitude at the reactivity probe (only included in the recovery
models), age, gender, the total number of valid eyeblink responses
to the startle probe over the course of the psychophysiology
experiment, and the lag between the survey and psychophysio-
logical assessments in days (A Models). The total number of valid
eyeblinks was included as a covariate so that the results were not
confounded with the reliability of the estimated EBR magnitude.
Then to ascertain the specificity of purpose in life's ability to
predict recovery, we added the other five psychological well-being
dimensions, both trait positive and negative affect (PANAS: mean
positive affect and mean negative affect) and subjective well-being
measures (Satisfaction with Life Scale mean and abbreviated
Gratitude Scale mean) as covariates in one linear mixed-effects
model (B Model) while including all of the covariates included in
the earlier models. All models included a family-specific random
effect to account for within-family dependence between twins and
siblings. Finally, we used linear mixed effects models to control for
data dependencies due to twins and siblings being included in the
sample rather than randomly pick one person from each family
cluster because the latter reduces the sample size, thereby
compromising effect size estimates and power.
Results
Manipulation Check
Emotion significantly modulated EBR magnitude. A significant
main effect of valence was found across probe times, F(2,1527)
= 8.96, p,0.001, such that EBR magnitude was greater across
probe times on negative (mean (SE) = 0.08 (0.03)) compared to
both neutral (mean (SE) = ­0.04 (0.03)) and positive (mean (SE)
= ­0.06 (0.03)) trials. A significant main effect of probe time was
found across valences, F(1,1527) = 13.25, p,0.001, such that EBR
magnitude was greater across valences during the recovery probe
time after picture offset (mean (SE) = 0.05 (0.02)) than the
reactivity probe time during the picture presentation (mean (SE)
= ­0.06 (0.02)), consistent with previous reports that startle
responses are larger for humans in darkness than in light [38],
reflecting the change in room light levels between a picture on the
screen compared to a black computer screen. The valence x probe
time interaction was marginally significant, F(2,1527) = 2.42,
p = 0.09. See Figure 3 for the EBR averages by valence and probe
time.
Effects of Purpose in life and the other Psychological
Well-being Dimensions
The zero order correlations between each of the psychological
well-being dimensions with EBR magnitude measures obtained (1)
at the reactivity probe, (2) at the recovery probe, and (3) with a
recovery residual reflecting EBR magnitude at the recovery probe
regressed on EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe to remove
variation due to differences in reactivity are presented in Table 1.
These correlations reveal that both purpose in life and positive
relations with others predicted larger EBR magnitude during the

picture presentations indicating greater reactivity to the negative
pictures. Both purpose in life and self-acceptance also predicted
significantly smaller EBR magnitude at the recovery probe, but
only purpose in life predicted significantly smaller recovery
residuals, when EBR magnitude at the recovery probe is regressed
on EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe, controlling for
Figure 2. Psychophysiology paradigm. 30 positive, 30 negative, and 30 neutral pictures were displayed individually on separate trials.
Participants responded as quickly as possible to the border color (purple or yellow) presented during the first 0.5 s of the picture presentation in
order to maintain attention during the task. Startle probes were presented at 2900 ms after picture onset (assessing reactivity) and 1900 ms after
picture offset (assessing recovery). Note: to avoid publication of an IAPS picture, the example negative picture was selected from the author's personal
collection to be representative of a prototypical IAPS picture. As the mother of the baby in the photograph, she has given written informed consent,
as outlined in the PLOS consent form, to publication of their photograph.

Figure 3. Manipulation check. Emotion modulation was observed in the EBR measures with a significant main effect of valence: EBR magnitude
was greater on negative compared to both neutral and positive trials across probe times. A main effect of probe time showed larger EBR magnitude
across valences in response to the recovery probe after picture offset when the computer screen was black than to the reactivity probe during the
picture presentation (consistent with findings of larger responses to startling stimuli in darkness than in light). Mean EBR magnitude was significantly
greater on negative than both neutral and positive trials at the reactivity probe, and greater on negative than positive trials at the recovery probe.

differences in reactivity. See Figure 4 for a scatterplot of the linear
relations between purpose in life and the EBR recovery residual.
When demographic and data quality variables were included as
covariates, the linear mixed-effects models testing the ability of
each of the well-being dimensions to predict reactivity were not
significant (all bs,0.009, all ps . 0.13). However, the estimates
presented in Table 2 show that when demographic, data quality,
and EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe were included as
covariates in the models with EBR magnitude at the recovery
probe, purpose in life still predicted smaller EBR at the recovery
probe; A Models: b = ­0.016, t(230) = ­3.02, p = 0.003. Personal
growth and self-acceptance also predicted EBR magnitude at the
recovery probe in the A Models, however only purpose in life
remained at trend level when all of the above covariates were
included as well as all of the psychological well-being dimensions,
trait positive and negative affect, and subjective well-being
variables in the same model, b = ­0.017, t(216.90) = ­1.86,
p = 0.064 (see Table 2). Thus, the findings from the linear
mixed-effects model, which adjusts for the potential dependencies
in the data from twins and siblings, show that when all of the
psychological well-being dimensions, subjective well-being, and
trait positive and negative affect are included in the same analytic
model, purpose in life still predicts at trend level lower EBR
magnitude at recovery. Therefore, higher levels of purpose in life
are associated with better recovery from negative emotional
stimuli even with the effect of the other well-being dimensions and
positive and negative trait affect removed.
Finally, as seen in Figure 4, there was one outlier on EBR
magnitude at the recovery probe. All of the analyses reported
above include the outlier. When the outlier participant's data is

transformed and then z-scored within each participant. (2) The EBR recovery measure here reflects EBR magnitude at the recovery probe regressed on
EBR magnitude at the reactivity probe, removing variation due to differences in reactivity. (3) The relation remains significant if the outlier is removed:

excluded from the linear mixed-effects models, purpose in life still
significantly predicted EBR recovery in each of the models: A
Model linear mixed-effects model: b = ­0.014, t(229) = ­2.64,
p = 0.009; and B Model linear mixed-effects model: b = ­0.017,

none of the other well-being dimensions predicted EBR recovery

included or not, all ps . 0.43.
Discussion
Higher levels of purpose in life, self-reported on average over
two years prior, predicted better recovery from a negative stimulus
measured with the eyeblink startle response (EBR), such that those
persons reporting greater life purpose exhibited smaller EBR
magnitude after picture offset. The significant association between
purpose in life and EBR magnitude measures of recovery were
observed even when differences in EBR magnitude at the
reactivity probe during the stimulus presentation were statistically
removed. Moreover, the relations between purpose in life and
emotional recovery from negative stimuli were still significant
when controlling for participants' age, gender, the five other
psychological well-being dimensions, self-reported trait positive
and negative affect, and measures of their subjective well-being.
The better recovery exhibited after stimulus offset by those with
high life purpose reflects a more healthy emotional time course
profile. Davis has demonstrated a crucial role of the central
nucleus of the amygdala in the fear potentiation of the startle
response in rats [39], and human studies suggest a similar role for
the amygdala in emotion-modulated startle [40­42]. Thus the
current finding of reduced startle during recovery is consistent with
previous reports from our laboratory [19] showing better
regulation of the amygdalar response to negative pictures in
people with high levels of purpose in life.
Purpose in life stood out among the well-being measures in its
ability to predict EBR measures of recovery, suggesting that feeling
purpose and meaning in one's life may contribute to a more
healthful and adaptive regulation of negative emotional responses.
Taubitz, Robinson, and Larson (2013) recently examined the time
course of EBR emotion-modulation in dysphoric women by
examining both reactivity to the picture presentation and recovery
after picture offset [33]. Dysphoric females, compared to non-
dysphoric females, exhibited blunted EBR for negative relative to
neutral pictures during the picture presentation (less reactivity), but
heightened EBR for negative relative to neutral pictures after
picture offset (poorer recovery), as demonstrated by hypothetical
Participant D in Figure 1. In other words, dysphoric females
exhibited a recovery profile comparable to that which persons with
low purpose in life exhibited in the current study. However, it is
important to point out that in the current study, the significant
relations between purpose in life and recovery were observed even
when gender and both trait positive and negative affect were
controlled.
Poor recovery from negative stimuli has been observed in
depressed individuals who display sustained pupil dilation and
amygdala activation to negative words [15­17]. While nonde-
pressed individuals increase dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activa-
tion and decrease amygdala activation when reappraising emo-
tional pictures, depressed persons do not [18]. Depression is also
characterized by working memory and attentional biases, includ-
ing increased elaboration of negative information, problems
disengaging from negative material, and deficits in cognitive
control when processing negative information [13,14]. Individuals
with depression usually report high levels of rumination [43] and
greater use of emotional suppression [44]. Both rumination and
suppression are ineffective emotion regulation techniques that can
actually increase negative emotions [45] and the associated
sympathetic nervous system activity [46,47], suggesting a potential
mechanism underlying the physical burden of the dysregulated
negative affect characterizing the disorder. According to the
World Health Survey, depression has a greater impact on overall
health than arthritis, diabetes, angina, and asthma [48]. Because
lower levels of psychological well-being, including lower levels of
purpose in life, are correlated with higher rates of depression
[3,4,11,12,49], the psychological well-being and depression
literature further supports the linkage between emotional regula-
tory skills and purpose in life.
How might higher levels of purpose in life contribute to the
ability to recover from aversive and unpleasant events? Additional
research is needed. However, having greater purpose in life may
provide motivation to constructively learn from and reappraise
negative events in an adaptive manner and avoid brooding and
ruminative tendencies, so as to quickly refocus on one's goals and
purpose. Possessing higher levels of well-being, especially purpose
in life, may provide a wealth of resources one can use to cope with
the current situation, motivating an adaptive and proactive
handling of the situation, buffering the effect of adverse
experiences, and thereby facilitating and fostering the learning
and development of even greater emotion regulation skill over
time. This idea is supported by reports that purpose in life is a key
factor associated with better recovery from trauma in at-risk
African American populations [50] as well as Pakistani earthquake
survivors [51], such that those reporting higher levels of purpose in
life had decreased rates of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)
after suffering trauma. Purpose in life might be a ``resilience
factor,'' protecting against the development of psychopathologies
such as PTSD and depression after stress and trauma exposure, or
even the repeated minor stresses experienced over the course of a

for each of the psychological well-being dimensions predicting EBR magnitude
at the recovery probe.

lifetime. The current study suggests a mechanism through which
purpose in life may confer protection is by facilitating automatic
emotion regulation after negative emotional provocation.
In turn, the reverse may also be true, to experience high well-
being and purpose, individuals may need to be able to flexibly
modify their emotional responses depending on the situation [52]
whether it is to (i) temporarily up-regulate and increase a negative
emotion to empathize with another or (ii) quickly down-regulate
and decrease a negative emotion to refocus attention and
concentrate on a task after experiencing an unpleasant event.
Thus, people more skilled and adept at emotion regulation may
have advantages in work and family life that nurture greater life
success, including a greater sense of mastery, growth, and
especially purpose in life. Moreover, the connections between
purpose in life and emotional recovery/regulation are likely
reciprocal in nature over time. Those with a greater sense of
purpose in life may be better prepared to respond to emotional
challenges more quickly and efficiently as our data show.
However, better emotional recovery from negative stimuli,
particularly cumulatively through development, might also lead
to greater purpose in life. Our study tested the ability of purpose in
life, measured about two years prior, to predict emotional
recovery, underscoring the need for additional studies to test
whether the relationship between purpose in life and emotion
regulatory abilities are uni- or bidirectional, especially at different
stages in the life span.
In conclusion, this longitudinal investigation combined phe-
nomenologically-experienced aspects of well-being with automatic,
objectively measured assessments of emotional reactivity and
recovery obtained in the laboratory over two years after the well-
being assessment. The MIDUS study features a remarkably large
sample with a wide age range, unique for an experiment utilizing
psychophysiological measures. Our findings suggest that higher
levels of self-reported purpose in life predict a person's future
ability to recover from exposure to negative stimuli. Persons with
higher purpose in life showed a facilitated recovery with smaller
eyeblink startle responses after negative stimuli offset, suggesting a
healthier overall emotional time course. Additional research
testing potential mechanisms by which purpose in life may be
related to emotional recovery skills [12] and confer resilience from
trauma [50,51], as well as how better emotional recovery skills
may contribute to purpose in life is warranted. Purposeful life
engagement has increasingly been linked to better health
outcomes, including assessments of morbidity and mortality
[7,10] as well as intervening biological mechanisms [9,53].
Understanding brain-based emotion regulation processes that
contribute to these outcomes are important next steps.
