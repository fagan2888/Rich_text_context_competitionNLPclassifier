Abstract
Objective: To quantify the health and economic outcomes associated with
changes in folic acid consumption following the fortification of enriched grain
products in the USA.
Design: Cost-effectiveness analysis.
Setting: Annual burden of disease, quality-adjusted life years (QALY) and costs
were projected for four steady-state strategies: no fortification, or fortifying with
140, 350 or 700 mg folic acid per 100 g enriched grain. The analysis considered
four health outcomes: neural tube defects (NTD), myocardial infarctions (MI),
colon cancers and B12
deficiency maskings.
Subjects: The US adult population subgroups defined by age, gender and race/
ethnicity, with folate intake distributions from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Surveys (1988­1992 and 1999­2000), and reference sources for
disease incidence, utility and economic estimates.
Results: The greatest benefits from fortification were predicted in MI prevention, with
16862 and 88172 cases averted per year in steady state for the 140 and 700mg
fortification levels, respectively. These projections were between 6261 and 38805 for
colon cancer and 182 and 1423 for NTD, while 15­820 additional B12
cases were
predicted. Compared with no fortification, all post-fortification strategies provided
QALY gains and cost savings for all subgroups, with predicted population benefits
of 266649 QALY gained and $3?6 billion saved in the long run by changing the
fortification level from 140mg/100g enriched grain to 700mg/100g.
Conclusions: The present study indicates that the health and economic gains of folic
acid fortification far outweigh the losses for the US population, and that increasing
the level of fortification deserves further consideration to maximise net gains.

Health policy
Increasing the intake of folate or folic acid during
preconception and early in pregnancy can significantly
reduce the risk of neural tube defects (NTD) in new-
borns(1,2). Increased intake may also reduce the risk of
myocardial infarction (MI) and colon cancer(3­16) and
increase the risk that symptoms of vitamin B12
deficiency
are masked(4,5,7,12), thereby allowing the neurological
manifestations of the disease to progress(4).
In 1998, the US Food and Drug Administration man-
dated that manufacturers add 140 mg of folic acid per
100 g of enriched cereal-grain product(11,13,14), and several
studies have shown that such fortification provides
substantial health and economic benefits(6,8,9,13,14,17­21).
However, the potential economic and health effects of
this and alternative fortification policies have not been
evaluated using national post-policy data adjusted for
measurement error, while considering all four relevant
health outcomes among population subgroups.
Accordingly, the present analysis quantifies the pro-
jected health and economic outcomes for NTD, MI, colon
cancers and B12
maskings associated with the changes
in folic acid consumption following fortification in the
USA, as well as for alternative fortification levels.
Methods
Overview
Population-wide disease burden and the associated costs
and quality-adjusted life years (QALY) were projected
under four scenarios: no fortification, or fortification with

140, 350 or 700 mg of folic acid per 100 g enriched grain.
The no-fortification strategy reflects the pre-fortification
levels of folate intake, the 140 mg strategy reflects the
current post-fortification intake in the USA, and fortifying
with 350 and 700 mg are hypothetical scenarios(13,19,20).
The four scenarios differ only in terms of the distribution
of folate intake in the population, which we model in four
categories: #200, 201­300, 301­400 and .400 mg/d.
For each scenario, we projected the steady-state num-
ber of NTD, MI, colon cancers and B12
maskings among
a US population of non-institutionalised, non-Hispanic
white (heretofore referred to as `white'), non-Hispanic
black (`black') and Mexican-American persons aged 15
years or older. Other racial/ethnic subgroups were not
included because of insufficient sample size on which to
base folate intake estimates. For each folate intake category,
we estimated age-, gender- and race/ethnicity-specific
risks of developing each of the four health outcomes. We
then assigned lifetime QALY losses and disease-related
net costs for each health outcome, using either published
estimates or a Markov modelling approach, to calculate
the population-wide impact of each strategy.
Folate intake distributions
Estimates of population-based folate intake distributions
were previously derived using food and dietary supple-
ment data from two periods of the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES)(22). Briefly, data
from NHANES III (1988­1994) were used to estimate pre-
fortification food folate intake, and those from NHANES
1999­2000 were used to estimate both dietary supplement
intake and post-fortification food folate intake. Because
nutrient intake data are based primarily on one 24 h dietary
recall measure, which does not represent an individual's
average long-term daily intake, population distribution
estimates of dietary folate intake were corrected for mea-
surement error using a sub-sample of NHANES III subjects
who had provided two 24 h recalls. Total folate intake
distributions before and after the fortification policy, cor-
rected for measurement error, are shown in Fig. 1 and
in the Appendix. Folate intake for the two hypothetical
scenarios was estimated as the product of the pre­post
differences in corrected food folate intake and the ratio of
the higher to the current levels (e.g. 350/140 for the 350mg
strategy), plus the post-fortification supplement intake.
Disease incidence
Annual incidence of the four disease outcomes prior to
fortification was estimated as a function of age range,
gender and race/ethnicity (Table 1). When data were not
available for the Mexican-American population, the rates
for the Hispanic population were used.
All women between the ages of 15 and 44 years(23­26)
were considered at risk for an NTD-affected pregnancy.
NTD incidence as a function of race/ethnicity was based
on estimates from the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) of 10?6 cases of spina bifida and anen-
cephaly per 10000 live births(9,27). Live birth rates from the
National Center for Health Statistics(28) were used to calcu-
late NTD incidence per 100000 women aged 15­44 years.
MI incidence was based on calculations by gender and
age from the Framingham Risk Equations(29). The relative
racial/ethnic distribution of MI incidence was assumed to
be the same as that of CHD-specific death among each
age and gender-specific subgroup(30). Subgroup-specific
annual colon cancer incidence rates were derived from
the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results Program
(SEER) of the National Cancer Institute(31­33).
Vitamin B12
masking was defined as the delayed
diagnosis of B12
deficiency followed by the development
of neurological complications. Estimates of masking risk
incorporated the probability of consuming greater than
1000 mg folate/d(22) ­ the `tolerable upper intake level' for
folic acid(10,11) ­ and the risk of pernicious anaemia (PA) ­
a common cause of B12
deficiency(19,34,35).
Folate-specific incidence of each disease was calcu-
lated by using data on the percentage of the population in
each folate intake category (Fig. 1) and the relative risks
of disease by folate intake to split out the subgroup-
specific disease rates. The risk of NTD was reduced by
50 % for women with folate intake levels of greater
than 400 mg/d(1,2,13,14,19,20), and the relative reduction of
MI risk for individuals with folate intake greater than
400 mg/d was 24 %(36). The risk ratios for colon cancer
diagnosis by folate intake were 0.92, 0?79 and 0?69 for
201­300, 301­400 and .400mg/d, respectively, compared
with #200 mg/d(37). Relative risks for MI and colon cancer
were assumed to be the same for men and women.
Valuing outcomes
The number of disease events associated with each
strategy were estimated as the product of incidence and
national population estimates for each subgroup(38). The
numbers of events were multiplied by the associated
QALY lost and net costs per event (Table 2) to estimate
the net health and economic impact of each fortification
strategy. All QALY and cost estimates were discounted by
3 % per year.
Health related quality-of-life
Estimates of QALY lost for NTD and B12
masking out-
comes were based on a CDC cost-effectiveness analy-
sis(20) that used the Quality of Well-Being Index(39). To
estimate the QALY lost associated with MI and colon
cancer we used a Markov modelling approach in which
we incorporated disease-specific mortality, health-related
quality-of-life weights and mortality from other cau-
ses(40­42). For MI, we assumed the same utility for patients
with coronary artery disease (CAD) of 0?84, calculated
from previous analyses as the mean of mild and severe
angina, weighted by the proportion of angina patients
with CAD(43­45). For colon cancer, life expectancy after

diagnosis was weighted by stage-specific mortality and
we assumed a stage-weighted utility of 0?76(46).
Costs
All costs were adjusted to 2005 dollars using the Consumer
Price Index. For costs incurred with NTD, estimates from
a published analysis(21) were used, weighted for relative
proportions of spina bifida and anencephaly(9). Costs
incurred with MI events incorporated short-term care(43)
as well as annual outpatient, medications and diagnostic
costs for a typical CAD patient(45,47,48), which were
assumed to be applicable to MI patients. Costs incurred
with colon cancer incorporated stage-weighted estimates
from the Institute of Medicine(49­56), and those associated
with cases of masked B12
deficiency were based on cal-
culations by the CDC(20). Estimates of annual fortification
costs for the 140 mg fortification strategy ($3?3 million)
were based on those used by Grosse and colleagues(21),
and those for the two hypothetical scenarios ($6?0 and
$10?6 million for 350 mg and 700 mg fortification strate-
gies, respectively) incorporated the fixed cost estimates
from Grosse et al. and the CDC's estimates of bulk folic

fortification costs were doubled in sensitivity analysis.
Results
Incidence
Figure 2 shows the projected per cent decline in annual
disease incidence for NTD, MI and colon cancer, compar-
ing the post-fortification scenarios with pre-fortification.
For NTD-affected pregnancies, average annual incidence
for all racial/ethnic groups was predicted to decrease by
5%, 24% and 39% for the 140, 350 and 700 mg/100g for-
tification scenarios, respectively. Mexican-Americans were
consistently projected to have the largest per cent declines
and blacks the lowest. Average annual MI incidence was
predicted to decrease by 2%, 8% and 14% for the lowest-
to-highest post-fortification levels, while projected declines
of colon cancer were 2%, 11% and 15%. The racial/ethnic
subgroups with the greatest predicted benefit were those
with the largest post-fortification increases in per cent
reaching the risk-reduction folate intake thresholds for each
disease outcome. Among older females, for example, whites
were estimated to experience the largest increases in
per cent consuming greater than 400 mg total folate/d,
and were predicted to experience the greatest declines in
disease incidence. On the other hand, older black females
were predicted to experience a 0­1% increase in MI
incidence, due to a decrease in the proportion consuming
more than 400mg/d.

US population. The model predicted that the greatest
benefits would be in MI prevention, with 16 862 cases
averted per year at the 140 mg fortification level and
88 172 at the highest fortification level. Between 6261 and
38 805 annual cases of colon cancer and 182 and 1423
annual NTD would be prevented, while 15­820 new
annual cases of B12
masking would be caused.
Quality-of-life and cost measures
Fortification was predicted to be cost-saving and to pro-
vide positive net QALY gains at all fortification levels, and
the 700mg/100 g strategy was projected to have the largest
health gain and cost savings, with over 320 000 QALY
gained and over $4 billion saved per year (Table 3). The
predicted annual gains of over 26 000 QALY and savings
of over $263 million from NTD prevention alone far
outweighed the QALY lost and costs incurred from B12
masking and fortification itself, which combined were
predicted to result in annual losses of fewer than 260
QALY and $15 million even at the highest fortification
level. QALY gains and cost savings due to MI and colon
cancers averted each year would be even greater, with MI

prevention alone predicted to save 184 000 QALY and $3
billion annually at the 700 mg level.
The model predicted the 700 mg fortification level
to yield the greatest net QALY gains and cost savings for
all age, gender and racial/ethnic subgroups (Table 4).
Benefits were projected to increase with age, with males
predicted to benefit more than females in most popula-
tions. At all fortification levels, the highest gains were
expected in white males aged 65 years and older, with
predicted annual gains of over 13 000 QALY and $190
million at the currently enacted level and over 59 000
QALY and $888 million at the 700 mg level. Among racial/
ethnic categories, whites were projected to experience
the greatest gains and Mexican-Americans the fewest.
Sensitivity analyses
This analysis projected substantial fortification benefits
despite predicting at the currently enacted fortifica-
tion level a 5 % reduction in NTD rates, which is far less
than the 20­30 % declines estimated from observed
data(6,8,9,17). Due to lack of adequate dose­response data,
the model allows only for reduced NTD risk at folate
consumption of .400 mg/d, yet there may be benefits in
NTD risk-reduction at lower levels.
To evaluate the effect of this possibility, three additional
NTD dose­response assumptions were tested (Fig. 3a),
allowing women to benefit from folate intake over
200mg/d(57­60). Curve A assumes a dose­response gradient
similar to that of colon cancer ­ albeit through different

mechanisms ­ while B and C were calculated by decreasing
the risk ratios of function A by 25% and 50%, respectively.
All three functions maintained the base-case assumption of
a 50% reduced risk for intake .400mg/d compared with
#400 mg/d. Given the use of a similar 400 mg/d threshold
for reducing the risk of MI by folate intake and evidence
of potential benefit at lower levels without a threshold
effect(61), an analogous sensitivity analysis on this dose­
response function was performed (Fig. 3b).
When risk reduction benefits for NTD and MI were
allowed at lower folate intakes, the model predicted that
more events would be prevented and there would be
greater reductions in disease incidence. The use of NTD
function B predicted at the 140 mg level a 23 % risk
reduction, the closest approximation to observed data.
When applying these functions for both NTD and MI
dose­response, the 700 mg strategy was predicted to save
370 000 QALY and $5 billion, compared with 320 000
QALY and $4 billion in the base case (Table 5).
To evaluate the effect of the model's other assumptions,
a range of estimates were applied for QALY and costs
(Table 2), relative risk of NTD-affected pregnancy (10% and
90%), masking risk (30­200% of base case), female PA risk
(150% of base case)(34,35,62), and discount rate (0% and
5%). Even with extreme estimates that would bias results
away from fortification, none of these variations ­ applied
individually or concurrently ­ changed the rankings
between strategies or the conclusion that QALY gains and
cost savings would result from fortification up to the highest
level considered. When biasing against fortification overall,
the conclusions remained the same, even though the pre-
dicted QALY gained and costs saved were smaller: for all
subgroups, fortification would remain cost saving, and the
700mg strategy would provide the greatest total QALY gains,
with $486 million saved and over 196000 QALY gained.
Discussion
It was predicted for three post-fortification strategies that
the projected health and economic benefits gained
from preventing NTD, MI and colon cancers in the US
population far exceeded those lost due to fortification itself
and increased B12
masking risk, with significant variations
by age, gender and race/ethnicity. For all health outcomes,
the QALY and cost benefits to whites were projected to be
significantly greater than those to blacks and Mexican-
Americans. With predicted population benefits of 322 940
QALY gained and $4?4 billion saved, fortifying at 700 mg/
100 g enriched grain product ­ the highest level considered
in this analysis ­ strongly dominated all other scenarios.
The benefits of higher fortification levels were predicted to
far outweigh the associated risks for all populations, and in
all sensitivity analyses.

The substantial racial/ethnic differences predicted in
disease outcomes were caused primarily by differences in
total folate intake. Although disease incidence was not
projected to decrease among all populations, this effect
was caused by the unrealistic discontinuous risk func-
tions used to avoid interpolating the epidemiological data
analysed in risk strata. Targeted supplement-use inter-
ventions may be necessary to further mitigate disparities
and reduce disease prevalence, and future research
should aim to identify racial/ethnic differences in intake
of fortified and non-fortified foods.
The results of the present analysis provide evidence for
recommending that fortification be increased to at least
700 mg of folic acid per 100 g of enriched grain product,
corroborating prior research that predicted greater eco-
nomic gains at higher fortification levels(20). The analysis
demonstrates that the benefits of higher fortification
would exceed the risks even in the most unfavourable
subgroups. It also addresses other important considera-
tions by using estimates of folate intake that are national,
subgroup-specific, and corrected for the bias caused by
the use of 1 d dietary intake data.
There are several limitations to consider when inter-
preting these results. The use of limited data on the
dose­response relationships between folate intake and
disease risk may have underestimated the post-fortifica-
tion health benefits. However, even when using
more realistically continuous ­ albeit uncertain ­ dose­
response assumptions for both NTD and MI, the conclu-
sions of positive benefit­risk trade-offs for all subgroups ­
and of greater benefit at higher fortification levels ­ did
not change, and the model predicted that more NTD and
MI would be prevented and that the NTD reduction
would be consistent with that observed post-policy(6,8,9,17).
A related source of uncertainty is that synthetic folic
acid is more bioavailable to absorption by the human
body than is naturally occurring folate. While this factor
can be incorporated using dietary folate equivalents
(DFE) ­ a measure that adjusts intake estimates for these
absorption differences ­ we were unable to include DFE
in our analysis due to data limitations. With fortification
resulting in greater proportions of intake from synthetic
folic acid, the model's use of total folate may thus have
caused the benefits of fortification to be underestimated,
and the risks to be overestimated. Conversely, because
this factor was not considered in estimating folate-specific
risks of MI and colon cancer, the benefits for dietary
sources of folate may be overstated. The model's pro-
jected cost savings associated with fortification may have
been underestimated, as lifetime caregiving costs of NTD-
affected individuals were not included, reduced costs
associated with the proportion of NTD ending in a ter-
minated pregnancy were excluded, and MI costs were
used that may not consider the increased costs of today's
standards of care. By the same token, we may have
overestimated QALY losses due to MI because survival
has been improved by today's standards of care. Taken
as a whole, it is unlikely that any such positive or negative
effects would substantially impact the results of the
analysis, or alter the conclusions of overall benefit.
Given the suggestion of possible insignificant or even
adverse effects of increased folate intake on MI risk and
on colorectal cancer progression among individuals with
pre-existing disease(3,63­67), the benefits to MI as well as to
colon cancer could be less than predicted by our model.
However, recent evidence also indicates a positive folate­
stroke association(68­70) and an overall cardiovascular
benefit(16), and our results may thus underestimate ben-
efits. The potential risk to colorectal cancer progression
may appear to be supported by recent published research
indicating a possible temporary delay in the ongoing
decline in colorectal cancer incidence(71), but this could
be in part an artefact of increased use of colonoscopy. In
addition, a recent report from the National Cancer Insti-
tute indicates that not only is incidence still decreasing at
2 % per year, but also mortality ­ which one would expect
to increase if fortification were accelerating growth of
existing tumours ­ is also declining at an annual rate
of close to 4 %(72). This analysis is thus important for
motivating further trials among people without exist-
ing disease, while simultaneously suggesting caution
among policymakers who may be considering potential
fortification increases.
By not formally allowing competing risks between
disease outcomes while allocating benefit for each dis-
ease event averted, the model may have double-counted
some of the benefits gained because multiple events may
be occurring per individual. The analysis did not incor-
porate potential associations of folic acid intake with
increased twinning(73­76), with other cancers(77­79), or
with cognitive decline(80). Given the lack of consistent
evidence for such outcomes, it is unclear in which
direction their inclusion may impact results, yet the
strength of the findings from our analysis suggests that the
conclusion of overall benefit associated with increased
folate intake would not be changed.
While these benefit­risk estimates assume a steady
state, in reality fortification's effect on NTD and B12
maskings would be relatively immediate, while that for
MI and colon cancer could take up to 5(36) and 15
years(37), respectively. However, not only were fortifica-
tion's benefits for NTD alone predicted to outweigh the
potential B12
masking risk, this risk may in fact have been
overestimated given our use of a conservative risk
threshold of 1000 mg/d despite no evidence of harm
below 5000 mg/d(10). It is also important to note that while
there is conflicting evidence regarding whether masking
has increased since fortification(81­83), current medical
knowledge regarding appropriate screening measures for
B12
deficiency suggests that the fear of delayed diagnosis
by physicians may not in fact be realised. The risk,
however, may be that symptom improvement due to

masking could reduce patients' likelihood of seeking
medical advice until after neurological complications
have occurred(84). Nevertheless, with the low prevalence
of potential masking ­ estimated at 0?09 % in older
women before fortification and 0?61 % after(83) ­ even
with conservative estimates our model predicted that this
risk would be outweighed by the benefits.
Given the uncertainty involved, future research should
clarify the dose­response relationships and benefit­risk
associations between folate intake and disease risk. This is
especially important for outcomes such as MI, colon cancer,
stroke, cognitive decline and B12
masking, for which
causality has not yet been established; there has been
conflicting evidence on potential risks, in particular among
individuals with pre-existing disease; or there remains
debate over the validity of the evidence(3,16,67­70,81­88).
In addition, future policy decisions may consider B12
co-
fortification or a more stringent screen for B12
deficiency
to offset the potentially elevated B12
masking risks due
to higher fortification, and may evaluate a broader range
of fortification levels to better determine the optimal for-
tification strategy.
In summary, folic acid fortification was implemented in
the USA in 1998 to reduce the chance of NTD in new-
borns. While there are potential risks of increased folate
intake to populations with vitamin B12
deficiency, there
may also be benefits in preventing MI and colon cancer.
Overall, in considering the benefit­risk trade-offs of folic
acid fortification, the present study suggests that the
health and economic gains may outweigh the losses
for the US population as a whole, and that additional
studies on the potential benefits and hazards associated
with folate intake ­ as well as an in-depth evaluation of
the level of fortification ­ deserve further consideration in
order to maximise net gains among all racial/ethnic, age
and gender-specific subgroups.
