Does Body Size Account for Gender Differences in Femur
Bone Density and Geometry?*
ANNE C. LOOKER,1 THOMAS J. BECK,2 and ERIC S. ORWOLL3
ABSTRACT
The extent to which greater bone strength in men is caused by proportionately greater bone mass versus
bigger bone size is not clear, primarily because the larger overall body size of men has made direct
comparisons of skeletal measures difficult. We examined gender differences in femur neck (FN) areal bone
mineral density (BMD) values collected from 5623 non-Hispanic whites aged 20 years in the third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III, 1988­1994) before and after correction for mea-
sured height and weight. We supplemented the conventional areal BMD data (Hologic QDR 1000) with
measurements of areal BMD and geometric properties (subperiosteal width, section modulus, and cortical
thickness) made at narrow "cross-sectional" regions traversing the FN and the proximal shaft using a
structural analysis program. Before body size adjustment, men had significantly higher values than women for
all variables at the three measurement sites (p < 0.0001). Adjustment for body size reduced the differences
between the sexes for all variables but had a greater effect on BMD (1­8% higher in men) than on geometry
(5­17% higher in men). When examined by age, the sex discrepancy was significantly greater in the older
group for all variables except subperiosteal widths. We conclude that although body size difference may
account for most of the areal BMD difference between men and women, male bones are still bigger in ways
that suggest greater bone strength. These differences may contribute importantly to lower fracture risk in
men. (J Bone Miner Res 2001;16:1291­1299)

INTRODUCTION
THERE HAS been a recent surge of interest in osteoporosis
in males because the elderly male population is increas-
ing in numbers,(1) as is the incidence of osteoporotic frac-
ture among males.(2) This interest includes a desire to better
understand the basis of the lower fracture rates observed in
men relative to women. One simple explanation for this
difference is that men have higher areal bone mineral den-
sity (BMD) values than women.(3) However, this interpre-
tation fails to account for the fact that the two-dimensional
areal BMD values are only partially corrected for bone
size.(4­10) Men have a larger body size on average than
women, so it is not clear how much of the sex difference in
BMD reflects differences in bone density versus body size.
Several approaches to address the lack of complete cor-
rection of areal BMD measurements for size have been
proposed, which involve incorporating bone area and/or

body weight or height in various ways.(8­10) Such adjust-
ments have been reported to reduce or eliminate differences
in BMD between males and females of the same racial and
ethnic groups(9,11­13); in fact, some have reported that fe-
males have higher proximal femur bone density values than
males after correction for body size.(11,12)
However, focusing on BMD alone may define too nar-
rowly the search for skeletal parameters that underlie the
lower fracture rates in men. Although BMD correlates with
objective measures of bone strength, it does not determine
bone strength by itself; bone size, shape, and dimensional
differences also play important roles in determining bone
strength and fracture risk.(14)
Ultimately, the basis of the gender differences in bone
strength and fracture risk must be addressed using data from
prospective studies that collect information on incident os-
teoporotic fractures from men and women. However, it
should be possible to gain some insight into the question by
comparing BMD values in a large data set after correction
for body size. Here, we have used BMD from hip dual-
energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) scans acquired in the
third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). The conventional region BMD data are
supplemented with measurements made on the same scan
data in narrow "cross-sectional" regions traversing the fem-
oral neck (FN) and the proximal shaft. These latter regions
provide BMD as well as bone geometric properties such as
subperiosteal width, section modulus, and estimates of cor-
tical thickness, which have been shown to be related to
mechanical strength of excised bone specimens.(15)
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
Bone mineral data were acquired in this study as a part of
the NHANES III, which was conducted by the National
Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention between 1988 and 1994. The survey used a
stratified, multistage probability design to select the sample
and collected data via household interviews and by direct
standardized physical examinations conducted in specially
equipped mobile examination centers. The survey has been
described in detail elsewhere.(16) All men and nonpregnant
women aged 20 years and older who received the physical
examination in the mobile centers were eligible for bone
densitometry unless they had fractured both hips previously.
Acceptable bone mineral measurements were obtained on
14,646 men and women aged 20 years and older. However,
structural analysis was not possible for 1031 of the 14,646
scans with acceptable data from the conventional analysis.
Reasons for exclusion from structural analysis were ob-
scured FN margins, incomplete (cut-off) scans, osteoar-
thritic growths, metal artifacts, prosthetics or calcifications,
and excessive anteversion. The total number of scans pro-
viding structural measurements was 13,615, which repre-
sents 59% of the eligible selected sample, 72% of the
eligible interviewed sample, and 82% of the eligible exam-
ined sample.
Race and ethnicity were self-reported in the NHANES III.
The present study was restricted to non-Hispanic whites
(2719 men and 2904 women), because differences in BMD,
bone geometry, and body dimensions between different
racial and ethnic groups(3,6,17) could potentially result in
different relationships between gender and BMD in the
different race/ethnic groups. Ethnic and racial influences on
the relationship between BMD, geometry, and gender will
be examined in a separate study.
Bone densitometry
The left hip was scanned unless there was a history of
previous fracture or surgery; only 1% received a scan of the
right femur. Because their inclusion did not alter estimates,
those who received a scan of the right femur were included
in the analyses. Measurements were obtained with three
Hologic QDR 1000 DXA scanners (Hologic, Inc., Waltham,
MA, USA) located in mobile examination centers. To en-
sure data quality, a rigorous quality control (QC) program,
including use of anthropomorphic phantoms and review of
each QC and respondent scan at a central site, was used
throughout the study.(18) The QC phantom program con-
sisted of repeated measurements of reference spine and
block phantoms that were circulated between the three
instruments, weekly measurements of a local hip phantom,
and daily scans of a local spine phantom. Instrument per-
formance was similar to or better than that of stationary
instruments.(3,18)
Extraction of bone mass and structural properties
We compared data between sexes for one of the five
conventional regions of interest typically analyzed in the
proximal femur, namely, the FN (Hologic FN) region. In the
structural analysis, measurements were made in a narrow
3-mm-wide region traversing the narrowest point of the FN
(Nrw FN) and a second 3-mm-wide region across the fem-
oral shaft (FS), 2 cm distal to the midpoint of the lesser
trochanter. These latter regions were chosen to permit com-
parison of a mixed cortical/trabecular location where osteo-
porotic fractures commonly occur, for example, Nrw FN,
with a purely cortical region where osteoporotic fractures
are rare, for example, FS. These cross-sectional regions of
interest do not correspond to familiar BMD analysis loca-
tions. There are no conventional counterparts to the cross-
sectional region in the shaft, but the Nrw FN either overlaps
or is proximal to the conventional Hologic FN region,
depending on FN length. The relative positions of the three
regions are illustrated in Fig. 1.
At each of the two narrow regions, BMD, cross-sectional
area (CSA), section modulus, and subperiosteal width were
measured, and an estimate of mean cortical thickness was
derived using methods described previously.(19) In brief,
profiles of bone mass traversing the bone in each region
were extracted from the image. Subperiosteal width was
measured as the blur-corrected profile breadth, whereas
CSA is the profile integral divided by the effective density
of mineral mass in bone tissue. Thus, CSA is the surface
area of the subperiosteal envelope after removal of soft
tissue voids, as opposed to the total area enclosed by the
subperiosteal envelope. Estimates of mean cortical thick-
ness assumed that the cross-section is a circular annulus
1292 LOOKER ET AL.
with an outer diameter of the mean subperiosteal width.
Sixty percent of the measured area in the FN was assumed
to be distributed uniformly in the cortex (with the remainder
as trabecular bone), whereas the shaft was assumed to be
entirely cortical bone. The cross-sectional moment of inertia
was derived from the integral of the mass profile (without
assumptions of shape) after determining its center of mass.
Finally, the section modulus was computed as the cross-
sectional moment of inertia divided by one-half of the bone
subperiosteal width. The section modulus is a measure of
bending and torsional strength.(20) Measurement precision
for the method was assessed with replicate hip scans from
474 participants from phase 1 of the NHANES III. Scans
were taken days to weeks apart, often with different scanner
operators. The resulting CVs ranged from 2.4% to 4.7% for
most parameters. The CVs for section moduli were slightly
higher at the neck and shaft: 7.7% and 5.4%, respectively.
In comparison, the CV for Hologic FN BMD measurements
on the same subjects was 3%.(18)
Subperiosteal width also was calculated for the conven-
tional Hologic FN region (Hologic FN width) by dividing
femur neck area by 1.5 cm.
Anthropometric measurements
Body weight was measured with an electronic load cell
scale in kilograms to two decimal places.(21) Standing
height was measured with a fixed stadiometer.(21) The mea-
surement was recorded to the nearest millimeter using pho-
tographs of the measuring bar.
Data analysis
We took two analytic approaches to explore sex disparities
in BMD and bone geometry. In the primary approach, we used
regression models to compare BMD and bone geometry be-
tween sexes in the total sample of non-Hispanic whites after
adjusting for differences between genders in age, body weight,
and standing height. We examined these differences in the total
sample (aged 20 years) and also within two age groups
(20­49 years and 50­69 years), because it has been observed
that BMD declines more rapidly with age in females than in
males.(22,23) In the latter analysis, the older group was confined
to ages 50­69 years to minimize possible confounding by the
larger number of females 69 years of age than males. We
also included a sex*age interaction term in this analysis to
assess whether the relationship between the bone variable and
sex is the same in both age groups.
We performed some secondary analyses to compare Ho-
logic FN bone values between genders using two other
analytic strategies that have been proposed to correct for
bone size: (a) bone mineral apparent density (BMAD),(8,9)
which was calculated as Hologic FN bone mineral content
(BMC)/((d/2)2 h, where d is the estimated diameter of FN
(calculated as FN area/h), and h is the height of the FN
region of interest, which was set to 1.5 cm by the system
software; and (b) Hologic FN BMC adjusted for height,
weight, and FN bone area using multiple regression.(10)
Sample weights were used when calculating point esti-
mates in the primary analyses described previously; these
weights provide estimates that are representative of the
civilian, noninstitutionalized U.S. population at the time of
the NHANES III and also account for oversampling and
nonresponse in the survey. The main analyses were per-
formed using SUDAAN,(24) a family of statistical proce-
dures for analysis of data from complex sample surveys.
To further examine sex disparities, we also did exploratory
analyses in which we examined the differences in BMD or
bone geometry variables in men and women whose body
dimensions matched in various ways. Specifically, for non-
Hispanic whites aged 20­29 years and 60­69 years, we per-
formed separate analyses to examine male-female pairs that
matched either on overall height and weight or on Hologic FN
BMD and body weight. The matching criteria were as follows:
(a) overall height and weight: men and women whose standing
height matched within 1.3 cm (0.5 in) and whose body weight
matched within 0.23 kg (0.5 lb); or (b) Hologic FN BMD value
and body weight: men and women whose Hologic FN BMD
matched within 2% (maximum difference was 0.018 g/cm2
and 0.017 g/cm2 for the younger and older group, respectively)
and whose body weight matched within 0.23 kg. There were
30 matched pairs in each of the two age groups when matched
on overall height and weight and 46 matched pairs in each age
group when matched on Hologic FN BMD and body weight.
In this exploratory analysis, we calculated the difference in
BMD and bone geometry variables between the male and
female in each matched pair and then expressed this difference
as the percent of the female value. We used difference scores
rather than the actual bone variable values in this analysis
because the vast majority of the matched pairs had unique body
dimensions. Because the NHANES III was not designed to
produce estimates from a sample based on individuals who
matched on body size, we did not use sampling weights in this
exploratory analysis, and thus point estimates are not represen-
tative of the U.S. population. The exploratory analyses were
performed using SAS.(25)

BODY SIZE AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN BMD AND GEOMETRY
height after adjusting for age in both the overall sample and
the sample examined by age group. The male-female dif-
ferences were larger for body weight than for height.
To illustrate the overall effects of body size on areal bone
density and geometry, the total sample of non-Hispanic
whites was compared between the sexes after adjusting for
age and body size differences (Table 2). In both the Hologic
FN and Nrw FN regions, areal BMD of males was about
10% higher than that of females before correcting for body
size. Adjusting for body size (weight and standing height)
produced somewhat different results depending on the fe-
mur neck region; in the Hologic FN, it reduced the differ-
ence to a small but still statistically significant 3%, whereas
at the Nrw FN, the difference was essentially nonexistent.
The discrepancy in effect at the femur neck is likely caused
by differences in the shape of these two subregions; the
1.5-cm-long, Hologic FN region encompasses a larger pro-
portion (33%) of the smaller FN length in the female (age-
adjusted mean, 4.56 cm; distance between the intersection
of neck and shaft axes and the center of the femoral head)
than it does in the male (30%; age-adjusted mean neck
length, 4.95 cm), whereas this discrepancy is not seen in the
Nrw FN because, due to its small length (3 mm), it is nearly
one-dimensional. Finally, in the FS region, the uncorrected
areal BMD difference was larger (14%) than either neck
region; moreover, a noticeable sex difference (8%) was still
evident after correction for body size.
The geometry measurements on the two narrow regions
provide further insight into possible mechanisms underlying
putative differences in bone strength between men and
women. In general, the magnitude of the difference between
genders for these variables tended to be greater than for
areal BMD, with men having approximately 9­48% higher
values than women before adjusting for body size. Correct-
ing for body size only reduced these differences somewhat;
men still had noticeably higher (5­17%) values than women
for all variables except cortical thickness at the Nrw FN.
The mechanical significance of these differences in mass
and geometry perhaps are best depicted in the section mod-
ulus, an index of bending strength. It is notable that the
largest sex differences were observed for this important
determinant of bone strength: before body size correction,
the male-female differences in section moduli were about
five times larger than the corresponding differences in BMD
at both the Nrw FN and the FS regions. More importantly,
bending strength at both locations remained 17% higher in
males than in females even after correction for body size.
We also examined the impact of two other analytic strat-
egies proposed to correct for bone size, namely, BMAD(8,9)
or BMC adjusted for height, weight, and bone area.(10)
These strategies resulted in male-female differences at the
Hologic FN that were similar in magnitude (data not shown)
to those found after adjusting for weight and standing height
(shown in Table 2). Furthermore, the direction of the gender
difference was reversed when BMAD was used, with fe-
males having noticeably higher values than males. Thus,
neither of these strategies provided a significant improve-
ment over use of body weight and height in our data set.
When the bone variables were compared between genders
after stratifying by age group, a somewhat more compli-
cated picture emerged (Table 3). First, as seen in the total
sample, adjustment for body size reduces the differences
between the sexes, with a greater effect on BMD than for
geometry. Likewise, sex differences were greatest in mag-
nitude for section moduli in both age groups both before and
after adjusting for body size. Second, a significant sex*age
interaction was observed for all variables in the three femur
regions except subperiosteal widths, which indicates that
the sex discrepancy was significantly greater in the older
group than in the younger group in areal BMD, section
moduli, CSAs, and cortical thickness. For example, in the
younger group, body size correction resulted in Hologic FN
BMD values that were nearly identical between the sexes
and the areal BMD and cortical thickness values actually
were slightly higher in females at the Nrw FN region.
However, a sex difference remains after body size correc-
tion in the older age group: Hologic FN and Nrw FN BMDs
were 6% and 3% lower in females and an even larger
difference was seen in the shaft. Moreover, the magnitude
of the sex difference also is larger in the older group.
Adjusting for body size had little impact on age trends
within gender, so that age patterns observed in the present
study are similar to those reported previously using unadjusted
data.(19) However, the age patterns differed somewhat by gen-
der. For example, mean BMD, CSA, and cortical thickness
were lower in the older age group in both genders, but the
magnitude of these differences was greater in females than
males. Conversely, periosteal widths were greater in older
versus younger individuals by a similar magnitude in both men
and women. Differences in section modulus by age depended
somewhat on skeletal site as well as gender. At the shaft,
means were greater in the older age group in both sexes but
more so in men than in women. However, at the narrow neck,
means were similar in older versus younger men but lower in
older versus younger women.
Results from the exploratory analysis of the male-female
pairs directly matched on various body size criteria were
consistent with the comparisons based on statistical adjust-

ment for body size in Table 2; for example, matching on
overall body size (weight and standing height) reduces sex
differences in BMD more than geometric differences, and
this effect is more evident in the older age group than in the
younger age group (data not shown). Of particular interest
was the finding that directly matching men and women on
BMD and body weight resulted in greater differences in
section modulus and periosteal widths than did matching on
body weight and standing height in both age groups.
DISCUSSION
Our study is among the first to examine in depth the
confounding of body size on femur bone density and ge-
ometry between genders. Previous studies have reported
that accounting for size, either by adjusting for overall body
size or by use of volumetric bone density estimates, resulted
in similar or higher BMD values in women than in
men.(9,11­13) However, with the exception of Kroger et
al.,(12) these studies did not explore the sex differences in
BMD in detail by age, and none included estimates of
skeletal geometry.
Our results extend previous work by showing that body
size has a major influence on the magnitude of the BMD
differences between the sexes whether measured at the
standard Hologic FN region, the Nrw FN region, or across
the FS. Correction for body size reduced the magnitude of
the gender difference in BMD. However, closer examina-
tion of these regions using dimensional information re-
vealed a more complicated picture. First, although the gen-

der difference in BMD essentially was eliminated in the
total sample after adjusting for body size, noticeable differ-
ences in bone geometry remained. More importantly, the
impact of body size correction on gender differences de-
pended on age, with the magnitude of gender differences in
BMD and several aspects of bone geometry being signifi-
cantly greater in those aged 50 years both before and after
body size correction. This latter finding is consistent with
results from Kroger et al.,(12) who also reported that cor-
recting for height and weight failed to remove the sex
difference in FN BMD among those aged 60­69 years.
Finally, the observations that the sex discrepancy in both
BMD and section modulus (which depends on mass distri-
bution and subperiosteal width) increased with age while
the sex discrepancy in widths did not are noteworthy. They
suggest that the smaller BMDs and section moduli in elderly
females are caused by greater rates of bone loss within the
subperiosteal envelope rather than to gender differences in
the rates of subperiosteal bone formation.
The explanation for the greater sex difference in the older
age group may be complex. The greater rate of areal BMD
loss at the hip in women versus men(22,23) is likely caused
by, at least in part, endocrine and paracrine differences
between genders. For example, estrogen plays an important
role in skeletal homeostasis in both genders(26,27) but the
decline in estrogen levels with age is more profound in
women because of menopause.(26) Insulin-like growth fac-
tor 1 (IGF-1) also declines with age in both sexes but it may
be related to indices of skeletal metabolism differently in
men and women.(28) Androgen affects skeletal mainte-
nance in both genders and may contribute to age-related
differences.(29,30) Differences in physical activity also may
contribute; women reported higher levels of inactivity than
men at all ages in the NHANES III, but the discrepancy
widened with age.(31) Finally, endocrine and physical fac-
tors potentially could be working synergistically to enhance
gender differences in the elderly. For example, Frost(32) has
postulated that in addition to its effects on osteoclasts and
osteoblasts, estrogen may influence the bone response to
mechanical load stimuli via a "mediator mechanism" in
bone marrow that controls disuse-mode remodeling in bone
next to marrow.
Several unresolved issues surrounding the body size ar-
tifact in bone measurements exist. One question is how to
adjust appropriately for this artifact within the context of
currently available measurements. We tried various body
size adjustments, including ones that incorporate bone area
by regression or by calculating BMAD,(8­10) but still found
persistent gender differences. Thus, easily obtainable mea-
surements such as body weight, height, or BMAD may not
adequately capture bone size at the femur. It is not clear
what convenient measurement might be possible to achieve
this goal.
Another, more important unresolved issue regarding body
size correction is whether it significantly improves the abil-
ity to explain gender differences in fracture risk. Our results
suggest that it may not, because adjusting for body size,
while reducing or removing BMD differences, did not elim-
inate gender differences in other strength-related variables.
However, the lack of fracture outcomes in the present study
precludes a firm conclusion on this point. The small number
of studies with fracture data that have examined this ques-
tion also suggest that typical body size corrections may not
improve the predictive utility of BMD in groups that differ
in size. For example, BMAD has not been found to improve
fracture risk prediction(33,34) or discrimination between frac-
ture cases and noncases in women.(4) As noted by Genant et
al.,(14) a more complex model that includes body or bone
size adjustments may not necessarily provide better fracture
prediction if the additional measurements introduce more
error or variability. More importantly, the bias produced by
body or bone size confounding may have a positive or
negative impact on fracture risk prediction depending on its
relationship with fracture risk. These findings suggest the
need to measure directly bone size and its independent
effect on fracture risk.
A final related question is whether a given BMD mea-
surement has the same meaning in terms of bone strength in
men and women. This is difficult to answer at present
because of the lack of data from studies that compare
fracture risk and BMD between genders directly within the
same study. The few studies published to date vary in the
skeletal sites at which BMD or fracture was assessed. Most,
but not all, of these studies provide risk estimates per SD
decline in BMD, but unfortunately it often was not clear
whether these were based on the same SD estimate or on
sex-specific SDs. It is not surprising then that results from
these studies are mixed, with relative risks or odds ratios
(ORs) being somewhat (albeit not statistically) higher,(35,36)
lower,(37,38) or the same(39­41) in men compared with
women.
Results from this study suggest that BMD values may not
have the same meaning in terms of bone strength in men and
women; for example, when BMD differences were essen-
tially removed by matching, noticeable gender differences
in other strength-related parameters remained. From a bio-
mechanical point of view, differences in geometric proper-
ties such as section modulus and subperiosteal widths are
likely to be relevant, because the overall structural behavior
of bone depends on both its tissue properties (which cur-
rently cannot be reliably measured in vivo) and its geome-
try.(14) Tests done on excised femoral specimens supported
the validity of the geometric measurements in predicting
strength in vitro.(15) In addition, there have been several in
vivo and in vitro studies that show that the strength of long
bone shafts is predicted by the section modulus (or the
cross-sectional moment of inertia, a component of the sec-
tion modulus).(42­46) Moreover, this parameter is used
widely in anthropological work and animal biology to as-
sess bone strength differences between different animals(47)
or human groups.(48) Thus, it is relatively clear that section
modulus measures strength in long bone shafts.
However, it is less clear whether the section modulus
describes bone strength in regions with some element of
trabecular bone, like the FN, especially if osteoporotic. For
example, DuBoef et al.(49) found no apparent differences
between hip fracture cases and age-matched controls in FN
cross-sectional moments of inertia or neck widths (compo-
nents of the section modulus). One possible explanation for
this lack of difference between fracture cases and controls
may be related to cortical thickness. We recently found(19)
that the section modulus appeared to decline at a much
1297
BODY SIZE AND GENDER DIFFERENCES IN BMD AND GEOMETRY
smaller rate with age than the BMD in both sexes and that
this was likely caused by a consistent increase in the sub-
periosteal width with age. This femoral expansion tends to
offset the loss in mass in an apparent attempt to maintain the
section modulus. However, this may be achieved in the
elderly FN at the cost of having a relatively thin cortex. If
the cortex is critically thin, then the section modulus may
overestimate strength if failure occurs by modes other than
pure bending or torsion. It is worth noting that the most
apparent difference between FN biopsy specimens of frac-
ture cases and nonfractured controls seen by Bell et al. was
in the cortical thickness.(50)
Thus, it is clear that there are strength-related structural
differences in the hip between the sexes that cannot be
eliminated by body size scaling, but without fracture out-
come data, our study cannot fully address the clinical rele-
vance of the observed gender differences in bone geometry
variables. In addition, it is likely that male-female differ-
ences in other variables not examined here, such as body
soft tissue composition or falling, also may be relevant.
These data gaps further underscore the need for large pro-
spective studies on men with incident osteoporotic frac-
tures.
Study limitations have been described previously(19) and
include use of DXA scanners that were not designed to
measure bone geometry. In addition, certain assumptions
about the constancy of the proportion of trabecular versus
cortical bone in the FN and bone shape had to be made to
estimate cortical thickness. In addition, only non-Hispanic
whites were included in this study, and relationships be-
tween body size, gender, and bone density may vary by race
or ethnicity. Finally, the NHANES III sample did not in-
clude institutionalized individuals by design, so our results
may not be applicable to these more frail individuals in
whom bone mass may be lower and geometry may differ
due to presence of other illnesses or bed rest. Furthermore,
not all individuals who were selected for the NHANES III
sample had usable structural data. We previously found no
evidence that differences between those with or without
data for the structural variables introduced major biases in
our estimates, however.(19)
In conclusion, we found that body size has a major
influence on the magnitude of BMD and geometry differ-
ences at several sites in the femur. The impact of body size
correction on gender differences was greater for BMD than
for geometry and also depended on age. In younger adults,
body size correction essentially removed the gender differ-
ence in BMD but not in bone geometry, whereas in older
adults, gender differences in both BMD and geometry were
still evident despite body size correction. Thus, gender
differences in bone size that are related to bone strength are
not reflected in areal BMD measures even after correction
for body size and may contribute importantly to the lower
fracture risk observed in men.
