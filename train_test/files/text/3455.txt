Introduction
One of the most dramatic advancements in this 21st century
is the utilization of information, communication technology
(ICT). This technology has offered opportunities in commu-
nication, among which is e-counseling, which enables coun-
selors to provide supportive online counseling opportunities
through a live webcam session, Internet chatting, messaging,
Internet conferencing, emailing, and telephoning. Ani (2006)
notes that the use of ICT has revolutionized access to infor-
mation of the business world. In advanced nations such as
the United States, the United Kingdom, and Japan, it has
been experimentally found that the use of computer to com-
plement the effort of human labor has brought about
improved performance. In counseling, this shifted drastically
from the conventional face-to-face counseling relationship
approach to a more dynamic, flexible, and more convenient
approach called e-counseling or online counseling
(Ehrenfeld, 2006; Grohol, 2011; Kanini & Regehr, 2003).
E-counseling is one of the counseling opportunities intro-
duced in the recent decades for delivering psychotherapeutic
services. It is defined as therapeutic service delivered by a
helping professional with electronic devices such as the
Internet and audio media. It can exist in real life situations
such as in the use of skype, phone conversation, chatting
online, and e-messaging (Suler, 2000). Literature reveals the

Utilization of E-Counseling in Career
Information Dissemination Among
Undergraduates of Federal Universities in
South East Nigeria

Abstract
This descriptive survey study was designed to find out the utilization of e-counseling in career information dissemination
among the undergraduates of the federal universities in South East Nigeria. Three research questions and three null
hypotheses guided the study. The population of the study consisted of 36 guidance counselors and 64,997 undergraduates
of the federal universities in South East Nigeria. The sample consisted of 1,036 participants. This is made up of all the 36
guidance counselors in the federal universities in South East Nigeria, and 1,000 undergraduates randomly selected from the
various universities. In each university, 200 undergraduates made up of 100 males and 100 females were randomly selected
using balloting by replacement. All the guidance counselors were used due to smallness in number. The instrument for
data collection was the E-Counselling Career Information Dissemination Questionnaire (E-CCIDQ). The reliability of the
instrument was established using Cronbach's alpha statistical analysis, and reliability indices of .91, .85, and .84 were obtained
for the three clusters. Data for the research questions were answered using percentage, mean, and standard deviation, while
the null hypotheses were analyzed using t test statistics tested at the .05 level of significance. The research findings revealed
that the universities in South East of Nigeria have e-counseling facilities and the students are very aware of e-counseling
opportunities in the universities. Also, the counselors and undergraduates to a high extent utilize e-counseling in career
information dissemination. Based on findings, discussions and some recommendations were made.

use of e-counseling in case studies and specific e-counseling
program (Fink & Schoech, 2008).
Most communications through the Internet are in written
form. Therefore, e-counseling, in which the mode of com-
munication is often through writings via emails or a chat
room, allows both the client and the therapist opportunity to
pay close attention to their communication and reflect on
their thoughts and feelings prior to their being expressed.
This probably may be a particularly suitable way of commu-
nicating and expressing of oneself through words. Clients
may also be able to communicate better in this environment
as they are not affected by the therapist's non-verbal cues
(Haberstroth, Duffey, Evans, Gee, & Trepal, 2007).
Nigeria is fast growing into a computerized nation in recent
years. This is seen in the rate at which students and counselors
embark on utilization of e-counseling. This trend invariably
makes Nigeria an Internet-oriented society, particularly in the
federal universities in South East Nigeria. Although, the
majority of students and counselors utilize face-to-face coun-
seling, a good number of others utilize e-counseling. Those
who utilize e-counseling sometimes tend more pressing prob-
lems, needs, and aspirations in their academic pursuits when
compared with their counterparts who utilize face-to-face
counseling (Kraus, Hen, Boniel-Nissim, & Shapira, 2008).
However, insufficient availability of e-counseling facilities
such as computer system, cellular phone, CD-ROM, Internet
connection, web browser, flash drive, virus scanner, backup,
scanner, Internet telephony, diskette, graphic editor, white-
board, and Java might tend to hinder effective utilization of
e-counseling in Nigerian universities just as it is with e-learn-
ing. This assertion would be determined in this study. Other
hindering factors include irregular supply of electricity, inad-
equate procurement of ICT facilities, and poor maintenance of
these facilities (Chiaha, Eze, & Ezeudu, 2013). No wonder
Febbets (1999) remarked that Nigeria needed to up-grade its
ICT facilities and terminals if she must compete effectively in
this fast evolving ICT era.
Nevertheless, despite the limitations of these hindering
factors, e-counseling utilization tends to become an impor-
tant source of communication for therapy to a growing num-
ber of consumers among who are students in Nigerian
universities. It offers mental health professional, which is
another way of providing services to their clients (Cherry,
2014). One of the characteristics or good aspects of e-coun-
seling is its convenience. Both the counselor and the client
have the convenience of corresponding with each other at a
range of variant times (Khasanshina, Wolf, Emerson, &
Stachura, 2008), thus, taking away the hassle of scheduling
and setting appointments, which characterize the conven-
tional face-to-face counseling practice. In addition, e-coun-
seling creates an opportunity for the therapists to extend their
services to more clients, as appointments can be potentially
scheduled over 24 hr and can reach a larger geographical
region through synchronous and asynchronous e-counseling
opportunities (Mallen & Vogel, 2005).
Furthermore, those individuals who are ambivalent
about counseling or who may be uncomfortable with the
traditional models of therapy tend to find e-counseling
more convenient, comfortable, and suitable than the con-
ventional face-to-face counseling communication. This is
because of its unlimited access to information and per-
ceived privacy for clients such as those suffering from
social phobia, agora phobias, or anxiety disorders (Gedge,
2009; Gwinnell, 2003). It also ensures ethical and legal
protection of the counselor and his client (Cherry, 2014,
Mallen & Vogel, 2005). No wonder, Kraus et al. (2008)
notes that the advantages of e-counseling is making it to be
widely acceptable in the counseling field.
It is important to note that although e-counseling has been
considered effective in counseling profession, it has also
been criticized in terms of non-observation of verbal and
non-verbal cues, from both counselor and client, difficulties
in maintaining clients' confidentiality, and security. Other
criticisms include its overall effectiveness, technological dif-
ficulties, and its limits of being able to guarantee the coun-
selor's credibility (Elleven & Allen, 2004). Based on these,
the researchers are concerned with determining the extent of
utilization of e-counseling in career information dissemina-
tion among undergraduates of the federal universities in
South East Nigeria.
Career information refers to any type of fact about jobs,
business, occupation, profession, trade, or work obtained for
use in career planning to earn a living. It is a valid and useful
information given to an individual to enable him become
purposeful and effective in his career-oriented profession
(Omeje, 2010). Consequently, the aim of career information
is to help individuals to understand themselves and the world
of work better so as to function effectively in and outside it
(Iwuama, 1999). In other words, it helps individuals imbibe
to strategies for proper choice and management of careers so
that they can have a very sound career development.
Although the imperatives of e-counseling calls for its uti-
lization in dissemination of career information to undergrad-
uates in the universities, the researchers are uncertain about
the extent of its utilization in dissemination of career infor-
mation among university undergraduates in South East
Nigeria. Hence, the researchers are poised to ask the follow-
ing: Do counselors utilize e-counseling in dissemination of
career information to undergraduates in the universities? If
they do, to what extent is this obtained? It is in view of these
concerns that the study is being carried out.
Research Questions
In line with the above, these research questions were posed
to guide the study.
Research Question 1: What are the e-counseling facili-
ties available for career information dissemination in the
federal universities in South East Nigeria?
Omeje et al. 3
Research Question 2: What are the students' awareness
levels of e-counseling opportunities for career informa-
tion dissemination?
Research Question 3: What is the extent of utilization of
e-counseling in career information dissemination by the
counselors and undergraduate students?
Hypotheses
The following null hypotheses postulated were tested at the
.05 level of significance.
Hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference between
the mean scores of undergraduates and counselors on
availability of e-counseling facilities for dissemination of
career information.
Hypothesis 2: There is no significant difference between
mean scores of male and female undergraduates on aware-
ness level of e-counseling opportunities for career infor-
mation dissemination.
Hypothesis 3: There is no significant difference between
the mean scores of undergraduates and counselors on
extent of utilization of e-counseling in dissemination of
career information.
Method
The study was carried in the federal universities in South East
Nigeria. South East Nigeria has five states, namely, Enugu,
Ebonyi, Imo, Abia, and Anambra states. The federal universi-
ties in South East Nigeria are University of Nigeria, Nsukka
(UNN); Federal University of Science and Technology
Owerri (FUTO), Michael Okpara Federal University of
Agriculture Umudike, Nnamdi Azikiwe University Awka,
and the Federal University Ndufu-Aike Ikwo.
The population of the study comprised all the 65,033 uni-
versity guidance counselors and undergraduates in the five
federal universities, South East of Nigeria. This is made up
of 36 guidance counselors (12 males and 24 females) and
64,997 undergraduates (38,251 males and 26,746 females;
source: academic planning unit of various federal universi-
ties in South East Nigeria for the 2013/2014 academic ses-
sion). The sample of this study was 1,036 participants made
up of all the 36 guidance counselors and 1,000 undergradu-
ates selected randomly through balloting by replacement. In
each of the federal university, 200 undergraduates made up
of 100 males and 100 females were randomly selected from
the final year students in the faculties of education, agricul-
ture, and social sciences, while all the guidance counselors in
the whole federal universities were used for the study due to
the smallness of their number.
The instrument that was used for data collection
was the E-Counselling Career Information Dissemination
Questionnaire (E-CCIDQ) designed by the researchers. This
instrument has two sections, A and B. Section A is designed to
elicit bio-data information of the respondents while Section B
contains 34 items put into three clusters. Cluster 1 elicits infor-
mation on various e-counseling facilities available for dissem-
ination of career information in universities. The items were
placed on two-point rating scales of available (AV) and not
available (NA), which were weighted 1 and 0. Cluster 2
focuses on students' awareness level of e-counseling opportu-
nities for career information dissemination, while Cluster 3
elicits information on extent of utilization of e-counseling in
career information dissemination. The items in Clusters 2 and
3 were placed on a four-point rating scale of very aware (VA),
moderately aware (MA), rarely aware (RA), and not aware
(NA) for Cluster 2; and very high extent (VHE), high extent
(HE), low extent (LE), very low extent (VLE) for Cluster 3.
They have assigned weight of 4, 3, 2, and 1 points, respec-
tively. Clusters 1, 2, and 3 were completed by the undergradu-
ate students, while the guidance counselors completed only
Clusters 1 and 3.
The reliability of the instrument was established using
Cronbach's alpha analysis to ascertain the internal consis-
tency of the items and reliability. The analysis of data gave
alpha coefficient values of .91, .85, and .84 for the three
respective clusters.
The data collected from the study were analyzed using
frequency, percentage, and mean to answer the research
questions generated for the study. A criterion mean score of
2.50, which is the average of the weighted responses per item
was used as decision rule for agreement or disagreement of
an item. As the items of the questionnaire were positively
framed, any score from 2.50 to 4.0 was an indication of
agreement with the item of the questionnaire, while below
2.50 was an indication of disagreement.
Results
Research Question 1: What are the e-counseling facili-
ties available for the career information dissemination in
the federal universities in South East Nigeria?
Table 1 shows the percentage ratings of counselors and
undergraduates on the availability of e-counseling facilities
for career information dissemination in the federal universi-
ties in South East Nigeria. The analysis reveals that the per-
centage ratings of both counselors and the undergraduates on
the availability of Items 1 to 15 are more than 50 percent-
ages. This, by implication, shows that all the 15 items are
available e-counseling facilities for career information dis-
semination in the federal universities in South East Nigeria.
Research Question 2: What are the students' awareness
levels of e-counseling opportunities for career informa-
tion dissemination?
Data analysis in Table 2 shows the mean and standard
deviations of the awareness level of male and female
4 SAGE Open
undergraduates on e-counseling opportunities for career
information dissemination. The data analysis result shows
that the mean ratings of both male and female undergradu-
ates to Items 1, 2, and 3 are within the range of 3.50 to 4.00,
indicating that undergraduates in the federal universities in
South East Nigeria are very aware of those e-counseling
opportunities. The mean ratings of both male and female
undergraduates to Items 4, 5, and 7 are within the range of
2.50 to 3.49 indicating that undergraduates in the federal
universities in South East Nigeria are moderately aware of
those e-counseling opportunities. However, the overall
mean score ratings of 3.54 and 3.56 for male and female
undergraduates, respectively, imply that the students are
very aware of the e-counseling opportunities. Besides, the
overall standard deviations of 0.57 and 0.45 for the male and
the female indicate that the ratings of the undergraduates did
not vary much.
Research Question 3: What is the extent of utilization of
e-counseling in career information dissemination among
counselors and undergraduates?
Table 3 shows the mean and standard deviation of the rat-
ings of counselors and undergraduates on the extent of utili-
zation of e-counseling in career information dissemination
among the undergraduates. The analysis shows that the mean
ratings of both counselors and undergraduates to Items 1, 2,
4, 5, 8, and 12 are within the range of 3.50 to 4.00, implying
that both the counselors and the undergraduates to a very
high extent utilize those e-counseling in career information
dissemination. Also, the mean ratings of both the counselors
and the undergraduates to Items 6, 7, 9, 10, and 11 are within
the range of 2.50 to 3.49 implying that both counselors and
undergraduates to a high extent utilize those e-counseling in
career information dissemination. Similarly, the overall
mean ratings of 3.31 and 3.49, for the counselors and the
undergraduates, respectively, imply that both to a high extent
utilize e-counseling in career information dissemination. The
overall standard deviation scores (counselors = 0.28 and
undergraduates = 0.52) indicate that the two categories of
respondents vary much in their ratings of extent of utilization
of e-counseling in career information dissemination.
Hypothesis 1: There is no significant difference between
the mean ratings of the undergraduates and the counselors
on the availability of e-counseling facilities for dissemi-
nation of career information.
Table 4 shows that the calculated chi-square value of 1.72
has a probability value of .63. Because the probability value
of .63 is greater than the .05 level of significance, the null
hypothesis is accepted. Thus, there is no significant differ-
ence between the ratings of undergraduates and counselors
on the availability of e-counseling facilities for dissemina-
tion of career information.
Hypothesis 2: There is no significant difference between
mean ratings of the male and the female undergraduates
on awareness level of e-counseling opportunities for
career information dissemination.
Table 5 shows that the probability associated with the cal-
culated value of t(­.338) is .74. Because the probability value
of .74 is greater than .05 level of significance, the null
hypothesis is accepted meaning that there is no significant
difference between mean ratings of male and female

Table 6 shows that the calculated value of t(­2.040) has
an associated probability value of .04. Because the probabil-
ity value of .04 is less than .05 level of significance, the null
hypothesis is rejected. Thus, there is a significant difference
between the mean ratings of the undergraduates and the
counselors on the extent of utilization of e-counseling in dis-
semination of career information with the mean ratings of the
undergraduates being higher than that of the counselors. This
implies that the undergraduates utilize e-counseling in dis-
seminating of career information more than the counselors.
Discussion
The e-counseling facilities are available for career informa-
tion dissemination in the federal universities in South East
Nigeria.

availability of e-counseling facilities for career information
dissemination in the federal universities in South East Nigeria.
The analysis reveals that the percentage ratings of both the
counselors and the undergraduates on the availability of Items
1 to 15, which are computer, cellular phone, CD-ROM,
Internet connection, web browser, flash drive, virus scanner,
backup devices Internet telephony, diskette, graphic editor,
whiteboard, and Java are more than 50%. This, by implication
shows that all the items are the available e-counseling facili-
ties for career information dissemination in the federal uni-
versities in South East Nigeria and that these e-counseling
facilities are familiar to the counselors and the undergradu-
ates. This finding is in agreement with the early study of
Febbets (1999), which notes that we live in a fast-changing
world, and if Nigerians must not be left behind, there is need
to up-grade terminals to microcomputer, maintain them to
keep pace with the technological development, which not
only has significant impact on the information industry but
also is an important factor in information planning.
Indeed, the result of Null Hypothesis 1 shows that there is
no significant difference between the mean ratings of the
undergraduates and the counselors on the availability of
e-counseling facilities for dissemination of career information.
It further affirms the Research Question 1 analyses on the
availability of e-counseling facilities among the undergradu-
ates in the universities. This finding is interesting as it tends to
show that both the counselors and the undergraduates can
identify ICT facilities and their uses. Implicitly, with the avail-
abilities of the ICT facilities, e-counseling would be functional
in the universities South East of Nigeria. Consequently, in line
with Ani (2006), the availabilities of these facilities would
enhance dissemination of career information through
e-counseling.
Students' Awareness Level of E-Counseling
Opportunities for Career Information
Dissemination
The result of data analysis with respect to the undergraduates
awareness level of e-counseling opportunities for career
information dissemination presented in Table 2 indicates that
the male and the female students are very aware of e-cous-
nelling opportunities for dissemination of career information
(male overall X = 3.54, SD = 0.57; female overall X =
3.56, SD = 0.45). A global look at the analysis shows that the
male and the female undergraduates are very aware of the
use of e-counseling opportunities such as classroom forum,
e-messaging and chatting, and synchronous and asynchro-
nous e-counseling in dissemination of career information.
However, the male and the female students' awareness of the
use of film modeling, psychometric test instruments stored in
CD-ROM, and WhatsApp opportunities in career informa-
tion dissemination is of a moderate level. The fact that the
undergraduates are aware of these e-counseling opportuni-
ties for dissemination of career information is interesting. It
also shows that Nigerian undergraduates are not ignorant of
these e-counseling opportunities but rather they have com-
plaints with the existing e-counseling opportunities available
for use in this fast evolving ICT era (Febbets, 1999).
The data analysis result in Table 5 reveals that there is no
significant difference between the male and the female stu-
dents' awareness level of e-counseling opportunities for
career information dissemination (t cal = 0.33, sig [2-tailed]
= .74 df = 998, p = .05). This finding is interesting. That the
male and the female undergraduates did not differ in their
awareness level of the e-counseling opportunities for dis-
semination of career information indicates that they are
ICT compliant gender. This finding corroborates with
Khasanshina et al. (2008) that most students limited by the
conventional face-to-face counseling resort now to e-coun-
seling, which is a more convenient and faster means of com-
municating with a counselor.

counselors and undergraduate students presented in Table 3
shows that both groups of respondents utilize e-counseling
in dissemination of career information to a high extent
(counselors: overall X = 3.31; undergraduates: overall X
= 3.49). The result further reveals that in e-counseling, both
the counselors and the undergraduates source and dissemi-
nate career information via mobile phones, Facebook, email,
and Google search. Others include using Twitter, Palmchats,
WhatsApp, and Black Berry Messenger (BBM). That both
the counselors and the undergraduate students utilize
e-counseling to a high extent in disseminating career infor-
mation is encouraging. This finding tends to be in conso-
nance with Ehrenfeld's (2006) and Grohol's (2011) research
findings that e-counseling is drastically overtaking the con-
ventional face-to-face counseling due to its more flexible,
convenient, and accessibility qualities.
This study, in addition, reveals through the hypothesis
testing result in Table 6, that a significant difference exists
between the extent of utilization of e-counseling in career
information dissemination by the counselors and the under-
graduate respondents, with the undergraduates being higher
in the utilization than the counselors (counselors: X = 3.31;
undergraduates: X = 3.49; t cal = ­2.04, sig [2-tailed] =
.042, df = 1,034, p = .05). This result is not surprising because
these undergraduates, final year students, are likely unem-
ployed. So, they are more likely to be engaged in the use of
online social networks in sourcing and disseminating of
career information than the counselors who are already
employed. In addition, the convenience of use and easy
accessibility to career information via e-counseling mode
might have also contributed to their higher utilization of
e-counseling in disseminating career information.
Conclusion and Recommendations
The guidance counselors and the undergraduate students'
respondents have identified 15 e-counseling facilities such as
computer system, cellular phone, CD-ROM Internet connec-
tion, web browser, flash drive, virus scanner, backup, scanner,
Internet telephony, diskette, flash drive, graphic editor, white-
board, and Java as available for career information dissemi-
nation in the universities in South East of Nigeria. Equally,
the study revealed also that the undergraduate students are
very aware of e-counseling opportunities for dissemination of
career information. However, although both respondents are
to a high extent using the identified e-counseling facilities in
career information dissemination, it is also evident that
females use these facilities more than males. Based on these
findings, the following recommendations are made:
1. More e-counseling facilities should be made avail-
able in the various federal universities in South East
of Nigeria for more improvement in dissemination of
career information among undergraduates.
2. That the undergraduates utilize e-counseling in dis-
seminating of career information more than the
counselors tends to suggest that e-counseling facilities
are inadequate for use by the students and the counsel-
ors. Consequently, counselors should be provided with
more and stable facilities to enhance more opportuni-
ties for e-counseling with the undergraduates.
3. Counselors should be provided with opportunities to
attend workshops and conferences where they will be
exposed to more novel opportunities available in
e-counseling utilization. With such exposure, they
would be more knowledgeable and skilled in their
usage in e-counseling opportunities.
