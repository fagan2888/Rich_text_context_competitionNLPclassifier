Introduction
Low back pain is among the most prevalent problems of
workers in various communities and the second top factor for
absence from work after upper respiratory system disorders
(Houglum & Perrin, 2005; Prentice, 2004). Fujishiro,
Weaver, Heaney, Hamrick, and Marras (2005) reported that
12% of health employees in the United States suffered from
occupational injuries mostly in the back and shoulders. As a
result of such injuries, 600,000 workers miss work annually,
45 to 54 billion dollars are spent, and work efficiency
decreases (Malone, 2000; Maul, Läubli, Klipstein, &
Krueger, 2003). Increasing the prevalence of low back pain
in a period of 14 years from 3.9% in 1992 to 10.2% in 2006
reveals a total of 16.2% and 11.6% annual increase. The
prevalence of low back pain is higher in nurses than other
occupational groups as it is reported to be about 73% to 90%
(Ajimsha, Daniel, & Chithra, 2014; Knibbe & Friele, 1996;
Maul et al., 2003). According to some studies, the prevalence
of low back pain among Iranian nurses ranges from 59.6%
(Mohseni-Bandpei, Fakhri, Ahmad-Shirvani, Bagheri-
Nessami, & Khalilian, 2005) to 78.3% (Simozar, Derakhshan,
Sadeghi, & Zare, 1999). Nursing is physically demanding
and is ranked second following industrial occupations, in this
regard (Engels, Landeweerd, & Kant, 1994). Although the
causes of low back pain have not been determined thor-
oughly, physicians believe that inappropriate work condi-
tions, incorrect body positions, and environmental factors as
well as physical activities in such conditions, exposing to
daily routine activities, bending, frequent rotations, carrying
heavy loads, performing repetitive activities, weak abdomen
muscles, and muscle shortening are some causes of low back
pain (Bernard, 1997). Most nurses mention that patient trans-
fer, standing for a long time, and activities that are physically
demanding are the main causes of their low back pain
(Mohseni-Bandpei et al., 2005). According to earlier studies,
more than 40% of the nurses' injuries result from patient

Low Back Pain Preventive Behaviors
Among Nurses Based on the Health Belief
Model Constructs

Abstract
The nursing profession is physically demanding as it is ranked second from the viewpoint of physical activity, following
industrial occupations. Nursing is considered a profession with high musculoskeletal disorders, specifically low back pain.
This article evaluated the nurses' educational needs based on the Health Belief Model (HBM) with focus on the low back pain
and adoption of preventive behaviors. This analytical cross-sectional study was conducted on 133 nurses who were selected
randomly from three public educational hospitals affiliated with Arak University of Medical Sciences. Data collection was
performed with a questionnaire, which included demographic characteristics, questions on HBM constructs, and a checklist for
explaining the performances. The collected data were analyzed using descriptive and analytical tests and Pearson's correlation
coefficient. In this study, among the HBM constructs, the cues to action and the perceived barriers were the main predictors
of optimal performance among the sample subjects (B = 0.09, p < .01). Moreover, there was a significant relationship between
the nurses' performance on adopting the preventive behaviors and the scores of perceived barriers, self-efficacy, and cues
to action (p < .05). However, no significant relationship was observed between the nurses' performance and perceived
susceptibility, severity, and benefits. In this study, as for behavior barriers, the nurses complained about unfamiliarity with
the workplace ergonomics and inappropriate conditions based on ergonomic principles, which requires educational planning
with the aim of overcoming perceived barriers, improving managerial activities, and enhancing the working place conditions.

transfer of which 75.9% cause low back pains (Fujishiro
et al., 2005). Studies in other countries show that the control
and treatment of low back pain are not similar in different
countries, and physicians and health experts adopt different
treatment methods. One of these methods is back health edu-
cation programs or Back School, which consists of programs
such as education and increasing awareness about chronic
low back pain, structure and function of the spine, preserving
the correct posture of the spine, and performing special back
exercises (Heymans, van Tulder, Esmail, Bombardier, &
Koes, 2005). A few studies have focused on the nurses'phys-
ical conditions, workplace ergonomics, received instruc-
tions, and their effects on work problems and musculoskeletal
and occupational injuries (Alexandre, de Moraes, Corrêa
Filho, & Jorge, 2001; Menzel, Brooks, Bernard, & Nelson,
2004; Nakhaei et al., 2006). The value of health education
programs depends on the above-mentioned programs, and
their efficiency depends on appropriate application of the
existing models and programs of health education; in other
words, health education models and programs are more effi-
cient when they possess appropriate theoretical support and
required basic facilities (Ewles & Simnett, 2003). Among
these models is Health Belief Model (HBM), which is a valu-
able and efficient educational assessment model (Figure 1).
It is in fact a behavioral model, which shows the relationship
between health belief and behavior and is based on the prin-
ciple that preventive behaviors depend on the individuals'
beliefs including their vulnerabilities to the disease, the
effect of the disease on their lives, and the effect of health
activities on reducing the disease severity and susceptibility.
The change behavior strategy may be planned using HBM
(Harrison, Mullen, & Green, 1992; Karimi, Ghofranipour, &
Heydarnia, 2009). The model constructs are perceived sus-
ceptibility, severity, benefits, and barriers as well as self-
efficacy. Another construct is cues to action, which refers to
internal and external events, which may stimulate and pre-
pare an individual to conduct an appropriate behavior (Glanz,
Rimer, & Viswanath, 2008; Rosenstock, 1974). The aim of
the present study was to determine the nurses' performance
and preventive behavior concerning chronic low back pain
and its causes, based on the HBM constructs. The results
may be applied in planning for the health promotion of the
nurses and other medical staff.
Method
The minimum sample size was a calculated 126 persons con-
sidering a study conducted by Zakerian et al. (2012), using
the following formula: n

(SD = 1, d = 0.175,
and a confidence interval [CI] of 95%), but we included 133
individuals in the study. The sample included the nurses
working in three educational hospitals in Arak including
Valiasr, Amiralmomenin, and Amirkabir Hospitals. The
nurses were selected with regard to the inclusion criteria
using a simple random method without imputation and
according to each ward's nurses list proportionate to the
whole number. Inclusion criteria were having an academic
degree (BS or higher), full-time employment, at least 1 year
experience as a clinical nurse, no musculoskeletal disorder in
past, and no surgical operation in musculoskeletal limbs, and
providing written consent for participation in the research.
The exclusion criterion of the study was no back pain during
the study.
In this study, the data collection instrument was a ques-
tionnaire consisting of five sections. Section 1 covered
demographic characteristics. Section 2 included some ques-
tions regarding perceived susceptibility such as "nurses are
at a higher risk of suffering chronic low back pain than other
labor groups," and perceived severity such as "In case of
Figure 1. Health belief model.
Sharafkhani et al. 3
suffering chronic low back pain, all the aspects of my life
will be changed negatively." The combination of perceived
seriousness and perceived susceptibility is referred to as per-
ceived threat (Glanz et al., 2008), perceived benefits such as
"I can prevent the effects of chronic back pain through
observing ergonomic principles in my workplace," and per-
ceived barriers such as "I do not conduct necessary measures
to prevent low back pain because I am not familiar with the
related principles." Nineteen questions about low back pain
were prepared on a 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = I totally
agree, 4 = I agree, 3 = no comment, 2 = I disagree, 1 = I
totally disagree). Section 3 consisted of six questions regard-
ing the various internal and external cues to action such as
"have you ever studied about chronic low back pain on the
Internet?" on a 5-point Likert-type scale (5 = very high, 4 =
high, 3 = low, 2 = very low, and 1 = never). The fourth sec-
tion with six questions addressed the nurses' self-efficacy in
low back pain preventive behaviors. The fifth section
included a checklist with the aim of measuring the nurses'
performance in adoption of low back pain proper preventive
behaviors.
To evaluate the checklist questions, a 4-point Likert-type
scale was utilized (0 = never, 1 = seldom, 2 = often, 3 =
always). The questionnaire was prepared based on reviewing
valid resources (Berthelette, Leduc, Bilodeau, Durand, &
Faye, 2012; Janz & Becker, 1984; Nelson, Motacki, &
Menzel, 2009; Occupational Safety Health Administration,
2010). The validity of the questionnaire was confirmed
through evaluating the clarity, simplicity, and relevance of
the questions (content validity). The questions'necessity was
also evaluated through receiving feedback from an expert's
panel consisting of specialists and experts in occupational
medicine, ergonomics, professional health, and health educa-
tion as well as experienced faculty members. Cronbach's
alpha was calculated in 30 nurses with demographic charac-
teristics similar to those of the sample population to measure
the reliability of the questionnaire, which was 0.75 for HBM,
0.73 for self-efficacy, and 0.72 for the performance checklist.
The collected data were analyzed with SPSS-20 using
descriptive statistical tests and Pearson correlation
coefficient.
Ethical Considerations
The project was approved by the Research Committee (num-
bered 854) as well as the Ethics Committee (numbered
91-137-5) of Arak University of Medical Sciences. All par-
ticipants participated in the study voluntarily after receiving
necessary explanations on its objective and method.
Results
In this study, the mean age of the participants was 32.1 ± 5.3.
Moreover, 8.3% of the participants were male and 91.7%
were female with a mean work experience of 5.38 ± 3.6
years. Other demographic characteristics are presented in
Table 1.
The results of the study revealed that the mean score of
the nurse performance was 1.48 ± 0.27 out of 3. Performance
means the proper posture and observing ergonomic princi-
ples at work including refraining from turning around the
waist axis during patient transfer or lifting loads, refraining
from bending on the load (or patient), refraining from hold-
ing the arms higher than shoulders for some minutes, observ-
ing the principles of patient transfer and lifting loads
(including lifting instruments, trolleys, sinks, buckets, and
baskets), refraining from keeping a long distance between
the patient and the nurse when moving a patient, placing the
instruments on a place not higher than the waist level, using
a ladder or stool to get access to objects on high shelves, and
refraining from lifting heavy loads (e.g., moving sedentary
patients). The mean score of nurses in observing the princi-
ples of sitting and standing was 1.16 ± 0.41 out of 3. The
principles included refraining from excessive bending for-
ward or backward, refraining from turning around, and
observing the correct principles regarding sitting on the
chair. The nurses' mean score in observing managerial prin-
ciples for adopting low back pain preventive behaviors was
1.66 ± 0.35 out of 3. The principles included reducing the
frequency of patients' transfer and lifting objects to less than
20 times during a work shift, asking for help when moving
patients who are unable to keep their balance, refraining
from performing activities beyond one's ability, and regard-
ing work time limitations (not working in short interval work

shifts). Finally, the nurses' performance score in performing
exercises to strengthen back muscles was equal to 0.71 ±
0.55, which was too low; 33.8% of the nurses did not exer-
cise at all, 60.9% seldom exercised, and only 5.3% exercised
most of the time. Other findings of the HBM constructs are
shown in Table 2.
According to Table 3, there was no correlation between
perceived susceptibility and severity with the performance
and between perceived benefits and performance. However,
there was a reverse correlation between self-efficacy and
performance, a positive correlation between cues to action
and performance, and a positive correlation between the cues
to action and self-efficacy.
The main barriers that the nurses confronted in adopting
preventive low back pain behaviors were reported as lack of
access to proper hospital equipment, inappropriate work-
place conditions, high work load, excessive fatigue, and lack
of knowledge on chronic low back pain prevention
principles.
Linear regression using stepwise methods was applied to
predict the nurses' optimal performance based on HBM con-
structs. Regression analysis revealed that among these com-
ponents, only perceived barriers and cues to action were
capable of predicting adoption of chronic low back pain pre-
ventive behaviors.
The results of multiple linear regressions are presented in
Tables 4 and 5.
Regarding external cues to action, Respectively from
highest to lowest rating, are presented in Table 6. The recom-
mendations of the nurses with low back pain and the book-
letsandeducationaljournalshavebeenmentionedconcerning
their adoption of low back pain preventive behaviors.
The nurses also reported that the internal cue to action
was fear of suffering from back pain (85.5%). Table 6 shows
a mean score of 2.79 out of 5, which indicates low self-effi-
cacy of the nurses in performing daily exercises for 30 min,
controlling Body Mass Index (BMI), reducing unnecessary
expenses for providing an appropriate mattress and bed for
themselves, preserving the correct body posture at work, and
confronting the risk factors of back pain through observing
ergonomic principles.
Discussion
The findings of the study revealed a reverse correlation
between perceived barriers and the nurses' performance, a
positive correlation between cues to action and performance,
and a positive correlation between self-efficacy and perfor-
mance. The results demonstrate that the nurses' performance
in terms of adopting low back pain preventive measures was
weak, regarding both ergonomic principles' conformity with
the workplace conditions and observing the preventive prin-
ciples such as preserving the proper body posture while sit-
ting or standing in work time. Cilliers (2007) claimed that the
perceived risk factors for suffering from low back pain
among nurses were as follows in order: moving heavy
patients, moving patients without asking for help, perform-
ing repetitive movements, moving patients to bed, and let-
ting them have the appropriate position (Cilliers, 2007).
Despite the reports on the above-mentioned risk factors, the
nurses in this study had a weak performance regarding the
adoption of low back pain preventive behaviors. Moreover,
their mean score of perceived susceptibility was 3.52 out of
5, which demonstrates that most of the nurses agreed that
they were exposed to the risk of low back pain at work, but
they did not take the proper measures. Therefore, one may
conclude that awareness does not lead to behavior change
and many different factors are effective in this regard. Hignett
(2003) reported that musculoskeletal disorders were one of
the most prevalent problems in health care employees. His
findings were confirmed in a study by Li et al in 2004
(Hignett, 2003; Li, Wolf, & Evanoff, 2004). Moreover,
Erikson, Bruusgaard, and Knardahl (2004) introduced low
back pain as one of the prevailing musculoskeletal disorders
among nurses. The nurses' obtained scores in perceived
severity were above the average, which shows that they were
very well aware of the serious effects and consequences of
low back pain on their life. Cilliers quoted from Berlute that
about 80% of the employees suffer from severe low back
pain and the related consequences in their lifetime. Low back
pain is an important reason for specialist visits (Cilliers,
2007). Therefore, low back pain incurs heavy burdens on
individuals and the society; however, there appears to be no
significant relationship between perceived severity and sus-
ceptibility with the nurses' performance in adoption of low
back pain preventive behaviors.
According to the literature, the nurses' mean score of the
perceived benefits of preventive behaviors was above the
average, which is satisfactory. The concerned benefits were
the ability to conduct daily tasks, prevention of economic
burdens resulting from back pain, being physically fit, and
having a pleasant life.
The mean score of perceived barriers was 3.87 out of 5.
According to the participants, the most important barriers
against adopting back pain preventive measures were lack of

sport facilities and appropriate places, very busy schedule of
the nurses, lack of a safe workplace, and lack of knowledge
about work conditions, ergonomic principles, and safety
issues to prevent low back pain. Other studies have intro-
duced lack of knowledge about long-time sitting and
standing and workplace ergonomic principles, lack of proper
equipment at work, inappropriate social places, shortage of
lifting equipment, and lack of physical exercise as the main
causes of low back pain (Berthelette et al., 2012; Lønnberg,
Pedersen, & Siersma, 2010; Samad,Abdullah, Moin, Tamrin,
& Hashim, 2010). Our study showed that perceived barriers
were predictive of the nurses' optimal performance, and that
their reduction would promote the nurses' optimal perfor-
mance. Meanwhile, as for the nurses' performances, cue to
action was the most powerful predictive construct among all
HBM constructs. In the present study, the internal cue to
action to encourage the nurses to adopt low back pain pre-
ventive behavior was reported to be the fear of suffering
from low back pain, and the most important external cues to
action were recommendations of the nurses with low back

pain, and related booklets and magazines. However, accord-
ing to the nurses, the least important external cues to action
were educational workshops and posters because the work-
shops were held infrequently and there were no such
posters.
Cilliers (2007) reported that the nurses' sources of infor-
mation regarding low back pain treatment were physicians
(34%), physiotherapists (25%), nursing faculty members
(20%), mass media (13%), in-service training (6%), and
schools (2%).
Limitations
Because the present research was conducted in governmental
and educational hospitals, the results cannot be generalized
to the staffs in other medical centers.
Conclusion and Suggestion
Although the nurses' perceived susceptibility and severity
were considerable, they were far from adopting appropriate
preventive behaviors. Therefore, it is necessary to increase
safety instructions at the hospitals with the aim of overcom-
ing the barriers of adopting such behaviors. The partici-
pants mentioned that one of the main barriers of adopting
preventive behaviors was lack of knowledge about the
workplace. It is recommended to conduct interventional
studies to promote the nurses' preventive behaviors regard-
ing back pain.
