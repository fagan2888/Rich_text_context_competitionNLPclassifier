This paper examines the effect of social engagement on disability among community-dwelling older adults in
1982­1991. Data were collected from the New Haven, Connecticut, site of the Established Populations for
Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly. Baseline social engagement was measured by using 11 items related to
social and productive activity. Disability data consisted of a six-item measure of activities of daily living, a three-
item measure of gross mobility, and a four-item measure of basic physical functions. Nine waves of yearly
disability data were analyzed by using generalized estimating equations models. After adjustment for age,
gender, race, and physical activity, significant cross-sectional associations (p's < 0.001) were found between
social engagement and all three measures of disability, with more socially engaged older adults reporting less
disability. Social engagement also showed small, but negative interaction effects with follow-up-time outcomes
(p's < 0.01), indicating that the protective effect of social engagement decreased slightly during follow-up. Results
suggest a strong, but not necessarily causal association of social engagement with disability. Promotion of social
engagement may still be important for the prevention of disability.

It is widely accepted that an active lifestyle is associated
with better health and longer life. The beneficial effects of
physical activity, summarized in the first US Surgeon
General's report on physical activity and health (1), are
evident across the entire life span, including older popula-
tions, and apply to a variety of important aging-related health
outcomes, such as mortality (1­5), disability (3, 6­8), and
health care expenditures (9). However, there is a growing
recognition that a much broader spectrum of activity than
just physical or fitness activity may provide significant
health benefits. This finding may have particular relevance
for older adults, for whom participation in vigorous fitness
activities may be constrained or potentially hazardous
because of underlying health problems (10).
Recent studies suggest that participation in leisure activi-
ties unrelated to fitness increases survival and has other posi-
tive health effects for older adults (11­18). Some of these
studies have focused on social and productive activity, the
latter usually being defined as activity that represents an
intrinsic economic value, such as paid employment, volun-
teer work, or gardening. For example, social and productive
activity has been associated with a reduced mortality risk
(13, 14, 19) and a reduced risk of cognitive decline and
dementia (12, 15, 18). The purpose of this investigation was
to build on these findings and evaluate the effect of social

and productive activity on functional decline and disability.
Disability is generally considered a good indicator of overall
health status in older populations. It is thought to arise from
the cumulative damage of the chronic disease processes that
affect humans throughout life and that become manifest in
older age (20, 21).
There have been few systematic studies to date of the rela-
tion between social and productive activity and disability.
One study found a significant cross-sectional association
between social activities and disability in a relatively small
sample (22). Another study reported a prospective associa-
tion between social activity and disability, but this finding
was limited to church attendance (23). In this paper, we test
the degree to which participation in social and productive
activity, which we refer to as social engagement, is associ-
ated with a reduced risk of disability in a community-based
population of adults aged 65 years or older.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
Data for this analysis were collected from the New Haven,
Connecticut, site of the Established Populations for Epide-
miologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) study, one of four
sites funded by the US National Institute on Aging and the
only one with detailed information on social activity. Details
of the New Haven EPESE study design have been described
previously (24). Briefly, to generate a representative sample
of the noninstitutionalized New Haven population aged 65
years or older, a two-stage, stratified probability sample was
obtained covering three housing strata: public housing for
the elderly (age and income restricted), private housing for
the elderly (age restricted), and general community housing.
The rate at which respondents were drawn into the sample
varied by housing stratum and included an oversampling of
men. The response rate for the combined strata was 82
percent. The baseline sample consisted of 1,169 men and
1,643 women, a total of 2,812 subjects.
Data collection and measures
Baseline data collection took place during face-to-face
interviews conducted in 1982 and included questions on
sociodemographic, psychosocial, and health-related charac-
teristics. Follow-up assessment consisted of in-home inter-
views in 1985 and 1988 and brief telephone interviews in the
intervening years (1983, 1984, 1986, and 1987) as well as in
the 2 years (1989 and 1990/1991) following the last in-home
interview, yielding a total of nine waves of data. Disability
status was ascertained at each yearly interview, while ques-
tions on social engagement were included in face-to-face
interviews only.
Social engagement. Social engagement was measured by
asking a series of questions during the baseline interview on
frequency of participation in social and productive activity.
These questions were designed not to refer to some under-
lying "latent" construct of social engagement but rather to
provide a broad characterization of the types of activities
common among older persons. Hence, there were no a priori
assumptions about the intercorrelations between the items.
Information on 11 types of social or productive activities
was included. Eight items (visits to theaters, sporting events;
shopping; gardening; meal preparation; card, game playing;
day or overnight trips; paid community work; and unpaid
community work) were rated according to frequency of
participation (0, never; 1, sometimes; 2, often). Church
attendance was rated on a six-point frequency scale (from
never/almost never to more than once a week), which was
recoded into three categories comparable to the other eight
activity items. Questions about participation in groups and
paid employment were asked in a yes/no format. Participa-
tion in groups was recoded to a value of 1, whereas paid
employment was recoded to a value of 2. A summary
measure of social engagement was derived by summing the
responses across the items. Total social engagement scores
were set to missing if responses were missing for more than
three items (n = 51, 2 percent); otherwise, missing responses
were recoded as 0 (no participation) for that activity. The
baseline interview also included three questions on fitness
activity (active sports or swimming, walking, physical exer-
cise), which were coded in the same way as the other activity
items. Higher scores on the social engagement and fitness
activity measures represented higher levels of activity, and
each measure was centered at the mean for use in the longi-
tudinal analysis.
Disability status. The New Haven EPESE study included
three self-reported measures of disability representing sepa-
rate, but complementary aspects of disability. The first
focused on the ability to perform essential self-care tasks
(e.g., bathing, dressing, eating) and was derived from the
Katz activities of daily living (ADL) scale (25). Consistent
with previous studies (26­28), task-specific disability was
defined as a self- or proxy report of presently needing help
from a person, needing special equipment or a device, or
being unable to perform the activity. A summary score was
computed by adding the number of tasks a person was able
to perform without help (range, 0­6). The second measure
focused on tasks requiring a certain degree of strength and
basic mobility, derived from the Rosow-Breslau Functional
Health Scale measure (29). The three items assessed the
ability (without help) to do heavy work around the house, to
walk up and down the stairs, and to walk half a mile (1 mile =
1.61 km). A summary score was formed by adding the three
items (range, 0­3). The third measure evaluated basic upper-
and lower-extremity function and was based on the work by
Nagi (30). It determined the degree of difficulty in pulling or
pushing large objects, stooping, crouching, or kneeling;
reaching or extending the arms above shoulder level, and
writing or handling small objects. Responses indicating no
or little difficulty were added across items to create a
summary score (range, 0­4). Disability questions were
included in each yearly interview, yielding a maximum of
nine waves of disability data per subject.
Covariates. In addition to age (in years) and gender, we
selected three sets of covariates that are known to be related
to disability outcomes and might influence the association of
social engagement with disability. The first set consists of
indicators of socioeconomic status, represented by measures
of education and income. The second set includes measures
Social Engagement and Change in Disability 635
Am J Epidemiol 2003;157:633­642
of health and the third set a measure of the overall number
and extent of social relationships.
Education was measured in number of years completed.
Income was categorized into two dummy variables
(<$5,000/year for low income; $5,000­$9,999/year for
middle income). To retain subjects who failed to report
income (13 percent), a separate dummy variable was created
for missing values. The high income level ($10,000/year)
served as the referent group. In the analysis, adjustment for
income meant including all three dummy variables in the
model.
Health measures included information on relative weight
and chronic conditions. Relative weight was assessed by
determining body mass index and was then divided into
approximate tertiles to create dummy variables for low (<23
kg/m2), middle (23­27 kg/m2), and high (>27 kg/m2). As for
income, a dummy variable for missing body mass index
values was created to permit inclusion of subjects for whom
values were missing (6 percent). Prevalent chronic condi-
tions were ascertained by using self-reported information on
seven physician-diagnosed medical conditions: myocardial
infarction, high blood pressure, stroke, cancer, diabetes, hip
fracture, and arthritis. A summary measure was created by
adding the number of self-reported conditions. Cognitive
health status was assessed by using the 10-item Short
Portable Mental Status Questionnaire (31). To examine the
influence of poor cognition on the results, analyses were
repeated after excluding subjects whose performance on this
questionnaire was poor, conventionally defined as three or
more incorrect responses (32).
Social networks were measured with a composite index by
using information on the number of social ties that included
visual and nonvisual contact and the proximity of four
groups of ties: children, relatives, friends, and confidants. A
total social network score was constructed by summing the
scores for each of the tie-specific measures. Additional
details of this measure have been described previously (33),
and this measure has been found to be associated with
disability transitions in the same cohort (28). Race was self-
reported and was coded as Black or non-Black (<1 percent of
subjects reported another racial/ethnic identity).
Statistical analysis. Generalized linear modeling was
used to fit the nine yearly waves of disability data. Because
of their skewed distributions, each disability outcome was
modeled by using a logistic link function, and a binomial
error structure was specified. To express each outcome as a
proportion, we recoded the disability variables by dividing
the number of items a subject was able to perform by the
total number of items. The regression coefficients of the
predictor variables in these models represent the linear effect
on the log odds of the proportion of tasks a subject is able to
perform on each measure. A generalized estimating equa-
tions approach was used to account for the correlated struc-
ture of disability data within sampling clusters (24) as well
as within subjects across repeated measurements (34).
A series of models was fitted to test the cross-sectional and
longitudinal effects of social engagement on disability. To
that end, the sequential disability data were modeled as a
function of baseline age, gender, and race, representing the
cross-sectional association of these variables with disability.
Longitudinal effects were represented by follow-up time (in
years since baseline) itself as well as the interactions
between follow-up time and age, follow-up time and gender,
and follow-up time and race. Separate models were
constructed for each disability outcome. We then tested the
main or "cross-sectional" effect of social engagement on
disability by adding baseline social engagement to these
models. The cross-sectional effect represents the degree to
which social engagement is associated with level of
disability, averaged across all yearly follow-up interviews.
We also included fitness activity in each model to adjust for
the effect of this variable. In the second series of models, we
added a term for the interaction between social engagement
and follow-up time to test the longitudinal effect of social
engagement on disability. In these models, the main (or
cross-sectional) effect represents the baseline association of
social engagement with disability, whereas the longitudinal
effect represents the degree to which the effect of baseline
social engagement changes during follow-up.
Sets of covariates representing socioeconomic status,
health status, and social networks were added to these
models one at a time to examine the influence of these vari-
ables on the association of social engagement with disability.
An additional model was fitted that was restricted to those
subjects without significant cognitive impairment at base-
line. Finally, to test the influence of mortality on the esti-
mated relation between social engagement and disability, a
separate model was fitted for those who survived the entire
follow-up period. Only baseline information was used for
each of the predictor variables, including social engagement.
All results were based on weighted analysis, unless other-
wise specified. All longitudinal analyses were performed by
using Statistical Analysis Software (SAS), version 8 (35).
RESULTS
Descriptive details of the New Haven EPESE sample have
been published previously (24, 36). Briefly, the cohort was
on average age 74.0 years at baseline, 64 percent female, and
16 percent Black. The social engagement measure had a
mean (unweighted) of 7.1 (3.2). Table 1 shows that social
engagement decreased with age and was higher among
females, non-Blacks, and those with more years of schooling
and higher income. In addition, older adults with a moderate
body mass index, fewer than two chronic conditions, no
impaired cognition, and higher levels of physical activity
had higher levels of social engagement.
A total of 1,318 (47 percent) subjects had died between the
baseline and final (1990) follow-up interviews. Participation
rates at each yearly follow-up interview ranged from 90.5
percent to 97.3 percent of those remaining alive. Table 2
shows the results of the primary analysis. Subjects were
omitted from the main analysis if information on social
engagement was missing at baseline (n = 51) or fewer than
two waves of disability data were available, which was
mostly due to mortality during the first year of follow-up.
For all three disability measures, disability was significantly
associated with each year over age 65 years at baseline,
being female, being Black, and reporting less fitness activity
(negative coefficients indicated more disability). The longi-
636 Mendes de Leon et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2003;157:633­642
tudinal effects indicated a significant increase in disability
over time and that this increase was greater for each addi-
tional year of age at baseline. Women and Blacks generally
did not show significant differential increases or decreases in
disability over time.
Social engagement was associated with a significant, posi-
tive, cross-sectional effect on each disability measure
(models 1, table 2). The coefficients represented the average
difference in disability across all yearly follow-up interviews
per unit difference in the social engagement measure. The
second series of models indicated that social engagement
was associated with a significant positive effect at baseline
but with a significant negative, longitudinal effect, as indi-
cated by the interaction effects with follow-up time (models
2, table 2). This finding indicates that the protective effect of
social engagement decreased over time. However, it is worth
noting that the magnitude of the longitudinal effects was
small compared with the baseline effects. For example,
about 17 years (0.339/0.020) would be required to
completely eliminate the initial (baseline) advantage in ADL
function due to social engagement. Convergence in
predicted disability scores would require 26 years (0.208/
0.008) and 32 years (0.160/0.005) according to the Rosow-
Breslau (29) and Nagi (30) measures, respectively.
The generalized estimating equations coefficients (table 2)
represent the effect on the ratio of the number of items or
tasks a person is able to perform to the number that he or she
is unable to perform, expressed on a log scale. Hence, the
coefficients lack a direct linear interpretation, especially at
the extremes of each disability measure. To graphically illus-
trate the longitudinal effect of social engagement on
disability, we computed predicted disability scores, based on
the second series of models, at the 25th and 75th percentiles
of the social engagement measure. Graphs were plotted for a
Black female and a White male, both aged 70 years (figure
1). Disability levels at baseline, that is, at age 70 years, were
markedly higher (lower scores) for those whose levels of
social engagement were lower, but differences remained
fairly stable during follow-up. In this figure, the almost-
parallel curves of decline for each group reflect the finding
that the negative interaction between social engagement and
follow-up time was small relative to the main effect. In fact,
disability differences between high and low social engage-
ment tended to increase slightly for ADL disability, the
measure for which the predicted scores were closest to the
upper limit (ceiling). Differences in predicted disability
levels for a White male and a Black female aged 70 years are
a combination of both the gender and race effects.
A secondary series of analyses was aimed at testing the
robustness of these findings across subgroups of particular
interest, including gender and race. The effect of social
engagement was not found to differ among these subgroups
(all p's > 0.20). Other models were fitted to examine the
influence of a series of potential confounders. To compare
the results across models, we refitted the primary models
presented in table 2 (models 2) for the subset of subjects for
whom covariate data were complete. Therefore, the first
"primary" model was the same as those presented in table 2,
except for the change in sample size. Results indicated that
the estimated baseline and longitudinal effects of social
engagement remained essentially unchanged after adjust-
ment for indicators of socioeconomic status or for social
networks (table 3). Controlling for health-related variables
resulted in a decrease of about 10­15 percent in the baseline
effects of social engagement but did not change the longitu-

dinal effects. Similarly small reductions in estimated coeffi-
cients were found when we limited the analyses to those
subjects without cognitive impairment at baseline or to those
surviving the entire follow-up period. This finding suggests
that neither cognitive impairment nor selective survival
substantially influenced the association of social engage-
ment with disability.
DISCUSSION
Increasing evidence suggests that the degree to which
older people are engaged in their social environment is asso-
ciated with a clear survival benefit, whether this engagement
is defined by specific social or productive activities (13, 14,
19) or by the nature and quality of their social relationships
(37­41). However, the exact mechanisms by which this
survival benefit is achieved remain mostly unclear. This
investigation focused on the impact of social engagement on
disability, a common endpoint of various age-related chronic
disease processes associated with reduced survival (42).
Our findings revealed a strong and robust cross-sectional
association between social engagement and disability. When
the data were averaged across all years of observation, more
socially active persons reported considerably lower levels of
disability than their counterparts. The association was
consistent across gender and race and across all three
measures of disability, suggesting that social engagement
affects a relatively broad spectrum of this process. The
results also indicate that the protective effect of social
engagement diminishes slowly over time, suggesting that
social engagement is not necessarily associated with a
slower rate of functional decline. However, the differential
changes in effects were very small relative to the substantial
protective effect at baseline for the more socially active,
yielding a pattern of mostly constant disability differences
during follow-up. In fact, predicted ADL scores suggested a
slight increase in absolute differences in ADL disability
between the more and less socially active.
The lack of a clearer positive longitudinal effect may in
part have been due to the ordinal scaling of the disability
measures, which may have limited their ability to adequately
capture progression of disability over time. For example,
longitudinal effect estimates may be biased to the degree that
differences between individual scores at higher levels of
each measure represent smaller gradations in underlying
disability than equivalent differences at lower levels. Some
evidence exists that specific task difficulties, or the patterns
in which subjects become disabled, do not follow strictly
linear patterns. Losses at lower levels of functional status,
compared with higher levels, may indicate greater progres-
sion of disability (43, 44). However, we know of no
uniformly accepted methods for either rescaling disability
measures or differentially weighting individual items

according to underlying level of disability, which precluded
us from systematically investigating this possibility.
Overall, however, our findings are not consistent with a
clear direct or "causal" effect of social engagement on
disability. An important issue is the temporal order of the
association. One consideration is that social engagement
may be as much a consequence of disability as it is a cause.
However, in a separate analysis, disability at baseline had
only a weak and nonsignificant effect on changes in social
engagement (data not shown). This finding raises the possi-
bility that the association between social engagement and
disability is more complex than a unidirectional causal effect
one way or the other. For example, the findings may be
consistent with a pattern of reciprocal causation, similar to
what has been observed in other studies of psychosocial
factors and change in disability (45). Reciprocal causation
could arise from a process of multiple system deactivation;
that is, losses in physical function and self-care capacities
lead to reduced social engagement, which in turn accelerates
functional decline (also known as "use it or lose it"). This
theme is common in the gerontologic literature, described as
changes in everyday competence and adaptation that follow
a dynamic and recursive process in interaction with age-
related declines in physical or cognitive function (45­49).
Although social engagement may enable older persons to
help maintain their functional abilities, our data do not
provide clear evidence that it leads to a significant slowing of
the disability process itself. The fact that this process is
driven mostly by the progression and acute clinical manifes-
tation of age-related chronic conditions suggests that social
engagement may not be directly involved in these disease
processes. In fact, little evidence to date suggests that social
engagement or related psychosocial factors play a significant
etiologic role in common, age-related chronic diseases (50,
51). Instead, it may be more likely that social engagement is
related to the ability to modify the functional consequences

of these diseases. Social engagement, or more generally the
extent to which persons are meaningfully involved in their
social environment, may provide a sense of purpose and a
sense of control over one's life and efficacy in one's abilities
(46, 52­54). A greater sense of control and self-efficacy, in
turn, has been shown to enable older persons to attenuate the
impact of declining physical health on everyday function and
disability (55­57). In other words, social engagement may
promote or reinforce the personal resources that enhance
resilience in the face of disease processes that become more
severe over time. The exact mechanisms involved in this
process remain poorly understood but likely consist of a
combination of psychosocial and physiologic pathways that
require further study.
Our study may have several weaknesses. For example, we
relied on ad hoc measures of social engagement, assembled
from items designed to cover a broad array of activities that
older adults commonly engage in. Confirmation of these
findings with better validated measures of social engage-
ment will be necessary. Another issue is that some aspects of
social engagement may be conceptually related to functional
abilities, leading to potential measurement confounding.
Some of the items in our social engagement measure (e.g.,
shopping, preparing meals) may be particularly vulnerable to
overlap with measures of instrumental ADL, but this
measure of disability was not used in the present analysis.
There was no content overlap with any of the items related to
the three disability measures used in our study. In addition,
disability is commonly defined in terms of the ability to
complete self-care tasks and other basic functions, whereas
social engagement is defined as actual participation in
activity. Nevertheless, the exact boundaries between lack of
social engagement and onset of disability remain difficult to
define precisely
An important strength of this analysis was the availability
of nine waves of sequential disability data. This design
feature enabled us to estimate the effect of social engage-
ment on change in disability status over time with greater
precision than is possible in studies with fewer data points
and longer intervals between observations. Our analysis
focused on the average, or marginal, disability effects, but it
did not directly address the heterogeneity in change in
disability over time that exists among older adults. Another
limitation of our analytic approach is that it did not take into

account the problem of competing risk. We found previously
that low levels of social engagement are associated with
greater mortality risk (19). Therefore, selective mortality
may have influenced our findings, especially in view of the
high mortality in this cohort during follow-up (48 percent).
However, selective mortality is unlikely to account for the
observed effect of social engagement on disability, given
that the association was only slightly reduced among those
who survived the entire follow-up period. Disability can be
viewed as a stage in the course of chronic disease processes
that will ultimately lead to death. It is possible that the same
mechanisms that enable older adults to reduce the disability
associated with chronic diseases, such as greater resilience,
also allow them to prolong life in the face of declining
health.
Another strength of our study is that we were able to
consider a broad set of other factors that might have
accounted for an association between social engagement and
disability. For example, persons reporting higher levels of
social engagement may also engage in more fitness activi-
ties. Although such activities are strongly related to
disability (3, 6­8), the effect of social engagement was found
to be independent of this type of activity. We further investi-
gated the potentially confounding effects of socioeconomic
status, poor physical or mental health, and social network
ties, all of which were found to be correlated with social
engagement and are also known to be related to disability
and functional decline (20, 49, 58­63). However, the effect
of social engagement was either unaffected or only slightly
reduced after adjustment for these variables.
The present findings are generally consistent with a health
benefit related to social engagement in older populations. A
number of studies have indicated a clear survival advantage
for older adults who are more socially active or who partici-
pate in specific social or productive activities (13, 14, 16,
19), although not all studies have observed a clear survival
benefit (64). Others have reported that social engagement is
associated with reduced levels of depressive symptoms (54)
and might be protective against decline in cognitive function
and onset of dementia (15, 65). These findings suggest that
social engagement forms an integral part of a constellation of
characteristics that have substantial significance for the
overall health, well-being, and functional independence of
older adults. As such, social engagement may be a critical
aspect of successful aging (66, 67).
In sum, we found that higher levels of social engagement
are associated with reduced disability and that this effect was
consistent across three different measures of disability as
well as across gender and racial subgroups. However, the
longitudinal data failed to provide evidence for a clear causal
effect on rate of functional decline. This finding does not
necessarily diminish its potential significance for preventing
disability. Promotion of social and productive activity may
provide both clinicians and policy makers with an additional
strategy to maintain the health and independence of seniors
and to postpone the disabling consequences of age-related
chronic diseases. For most people, being socially engaged,
having meaningful social and productive activity in one's
life, is a worthy goal in and of itself.
