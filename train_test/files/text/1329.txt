Treating Osteoarthritis With
Cyclooxygenase-2­Specific Inhibitors
What Are the Benefits of Avoiding Blood Pressure Destabilization?
Steven A. Grover, Louis Coupal, Hanna Zowall
Abstract--Osteoarthritis and hypertension are highly prevalent among older Americans. Anti-inflammatory medications
can destabilize blood pressure control. We estimated the decreased cardiovascular risk, premature mortality, and direct
health care costs that could be avoided if blood pressure control is not destabilized among hypertensive Americans
taking cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2)­specific inhibitors for osteoarthritis. Data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) provided the distribution of cardiovascular risk factors among American
adults with osteoarthritis and hypertension. The Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model was used to estimate
the impact of a 2.26% increase in systolic blood pressure on the basis of results of a randomized trial comparing
COX-2­specific inhibitors. A similar analysis was completed for American adults with osteoarthritis and untreated
hypertension (140/90 mm Hg). Among 7.3 million Americans with treated hypertension, maintaining blood pressure
control would avoid 30 000 stroke deaths and 25 000 coronary deaths resulting in 449 000 person years of life saved
and $1.4 billion in direct health care cost savings. When an additional 3.8 million Americans with untreated
hypertension are considered, maintaining blood pressure control could prevent 47 000 stroke deaths, 39 000 coronary
deaths, and result in 668 000 person years of life saved and $2.4 billion in direct health care cost savings. We conclude
that even a small increase in systolic blood pressure among hypertensive Americans with osteoarthritis may substantially
increase the clinical and economic burden of cardiovascular disease. Maintaining blood pressure control may be
associated with substantial benefits. (Hypertension. 2005;45:92-97.)
Key Words: blood pressure  cardiovascular disease
Osteoarthritis is highly prevalent in the United States.
Among nearly 116 million US adults 35 years of age,
24 million (21%) have osteoarthritis.1 Nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are commonly prescribed for
osteoarthritis. NSAIDs inhibit the cyclooxygenase-1
(COX-1) and COX-2 enzymes.2 One of the most serious side
effects of nonspecific NSAIDs is upper gastrointestinal ul-
ceration and bleeding resulting from a reduction in the
prostaglandins produced by COX-1.
Recent clinical trials suggest that COX-2­selective
NSAIDs are associated with a reduced incidence of gastro-
intestinal bleeding compared with nonselective NSAIDS.3,4
This reduced gastric toxicity has been primarily responsible
for the growing popularity of these drugs in the United States
and Canada. With this increased use, other issues surrounding
COX-2­specific inhibitor toxicity are now receiving addi-
tional attention. For instance, in the VIoxx Gastrointestinal
Outcome Research (VIGOR) study, whereas rofecoxib was
associated with a lower risk of gastrointestinal events com-
pared with naproxen, myocardial infarctions were more
frequent with this COX-2­specific inhibitor.3 Controversy
continues as to whether rofecoxib is associated with an
increased risk of myocardial infarction or whether naproxen
offers protection against cardiovascular disease.5­10
It has been well recognized that nonspecific NSAIDs may
interfere with hypertension management. A number of meta-
analyses have concluded that this appears to be a class effect,
whereby systolic and diastolic pressure are increased among
previously controlled patients.11,12 Data surrounding the ef-
fects of COX-2­specific inhibitors on hypertension have only
recently become available. Among hypertensive patients with
osteoarthritis, recent head-to-head, double-blind, clinical tri-
als have evaluated the blood pressure changes associated with
COX-2­specific inhibitors. In the SUCcessive Celecoxib
Efficacy and Safety Study (SUCCESS) VI, 810 patients were
randomized to receive 200 mg of celecoxib or 25 mg of
rofecoxib once daily. After 6 weeks of treatment, there was a
significant increase in systolic blood pressure (2.6 mm Hg)
for rofecoxib compared with 0.5 mm Hg for celecoxib.13

treatment arms but was more common among rofecoxib
patients. A similar result was observed in a second but larger
study, SUCCESS VII.14
The prevalence of osteoarthritis increases with age, as does
the risk of cardiovascular disease. The prevalence of high
blood pressure also increases with age. Accordingly, a sub-
stantial number of patients with osteoarthritis are likely to be
receiving concurrent therapy for hypertension. We used the
Cardiovascular Life Expectancy Model,14 a validated Markov
model, and data from the Third National Health And Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (NHANES III)15 to estimate the
impact of small changes in blood pressure. These analyses
focus on American adults with osteoarthritis and hyperten-
sion, treated and untreated, to estimate the potential clinical
and economic impact of blood pressure destabilization after
COX-2­specific inhibitor prescription.
Methods
Using blood pressure data provided by the SUCCESS VI study, we
estimated the impact of blood pressure destabilization among hyper-
tensive patients receiving COX-2­specific inhibitor therapy for the
treatment of osteoarthritis.13 The impact of blood pressure changes
on cardiovascular risk was modeled using the Cardiovascular Life
Expectancy Model.14 This validated Markov model was used to
estimate the increased risk of coronary events, cerebrovascular
events, and premature mortality after blood pressure changes. The
incremental risk observed in the SUCCESS VI study was then
extrapolated to the American adults diagnosed with osteoarthritis and
receiving treatment for hypertension. These analyses were based on
the distribution of risk factors among adults in the NHANES III
survey.15 Finally, we also estimated the impact of blood pressure
destabilization on adults with osteoarthritis and untreated hypertension.
Blood Pressure Changes Observed in
SUCCESS VI
SUCCESS VI was a 6-week randomized parallel group, double-blind
trial in patients with osteoarthritis who were 65 years of age and
were taking antihypertensive agents.13 Patients received 200 mg of
celecoxib or 25 mg rofecoxib once daily. Primary end points
included changes in blood pressure and development of edema.
Approximately 400 patients were entered into each arm of the
study. Baseline characteristics were balanced between the 2 treat-
ment groups, including an average of 74 years of age, female gender
in 66% of participants, baseline systolic blood pressure of 137 to
138 mm Hg, and diastolic blood pressure of 76 mm Hg. During 6
weeks of therapy, mean systolic blood pressure decreased in the
celecoxib-treated patients but increased among those receiving
rofecoxib. The net difference between the 2 treatment arms increased
from 2.4 mm Hg (P0.014) at week 1, to 2.8 mm Hg (P0.006) at
week 2, to 3.1 mm Hg (P0.007) at week 6. Clinically important
elevated hypertension (prespecified as an increase of 20 mm Hg
with an absolute value 140 mm Hg) developed among 66 rofe-
coxib patients compared with 45 patients receiving celecoxib
(P0.03). In summary, systolic blood pressure decreased by 0.36%
among those receiving celecoxib and rose 1.9% among those
receiving rofecoxib. These net changes in blood pressure (2.26%)
were used to estimate the associated change in cardiovascular risk.
Estimating Cardiovascular Events and
Life Expectancy
The Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model was used to
estimate the impact of the differential blood pressure effect of cele-
coxib versus rofecoxib.15 This Markov model estimates the annual
probability of fatal and nonfatal cardiovascular events on the basis of
multivariate logistic regression models developed using the Lipid
Research Clinics Prevalence Study.16 Independent risk factors in-
clude age, gender, blood pressure, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholester-
ol, mean arterial pressure, the presence of cigarette smoking,
diabetes, and diagnosed cardiovascular disease at baseline. The
clinical criteria for cardiovascular events and the odds ratios (ORs)
for the independent risk factors have been reported previously.15
A cohort of patients is entered into the model with specified levels
of risk factors. Each year, subjects can die of coronary heart disease
or of cerebrovascular disease or other noncardiovascular causes.
Surviving subjects age 1 year and re-enter the model for the
following year. Mean life expectancy can be calculated by summing
across the total person years of life experienced by the cohort and
dividing by the subjects at risk at entry into the model. The model
has been described in detail previously and shown to reasonably
estimate events in 9 clinical trials of dyslipidemia or hypertension.15
Estimating Risk of Cardiovascular Events Among
American Adults
The Third National Health and Nutrition Survey (NHANES III) was
used to provide a representative sample of Americans with osteoar-
thritis and hypertension (treated or untreated).17 This study was
conducted in 2 phases between 1988 and 1994.
Cigarette smokers included self-reported current smokers who had
smoked 100 cigarettes in their lifetime or subjects with serum
cotinine levels 13 mg/mL. The presence of cardiovascular disease
was defined as a subject's self-report of a previous physician
diagnosis of heart attack, stroke, congestive heart failure, or symp-
toms consistent with angina (Rose questionnaire) or intermittent
claudication. Presence of diabetes was based on a patient's self-
report of previous physician diagnosis of diabetes or the American
Diabetes Association criteria of a fasting plasma glucose 126
mg/dL (7.0 mmol/L).
Specific weights were assigned to each sampled subject to
estimate the total number of Americans represented by that subject
after adjustment for selection probabilities and nonresponse.
Primary Analyses
Using NHANES III data, the presence of osteoarthritis among adults
50 years of age was based on a positive response to the question:
"Has a physician ever told you that you had arthritis?" They were
then asked whether it was osteoarthritis or rheumatoid arthritis. We
excluded all patients with rheumatoid arthritis. Individuals were
classified as having treated hypertension if they had been told by
their physician that they had hypertension and were taking prescribed
medication for it. Untreated hypertension was defined as a measured
systolic blood pressure 140 mm Hg or diastolic blood pressure
90 mm Hg among individuals who were not taking prescribed
medication.
The Cardiovascular Disease Life Expectancy Model was then used
to estimate the impact of a 2.26% net increase in systolic blood
pressure on the lifetime risk of cardiovascular events. Initially, the
analysis focused only on individuals with treated hypertension. The
analysis was then repeated for individuals with untreated
hypertension.
Initially, we calculated the fatal strokes and coronary events
(undiscounted) that would be avoided if blood pressure is not
destabilized. We then calculated the person years of life saved
because of premature mortality associated with an increased risk of
cardiovascular disease. Finally, we calculated the direct health care
cost savings associated with preventing cardiovascular disease.
Person years of life saved and cost savings were discounted 3%
annually.
Estimating Direct Health Care Costs of
Cardiovascular Disease
The economic perspective adopted in the present analysis is that of
a third-party payer providing comprehensive coverage of all health
care services. Cardiovascular disease treatment costs included the
costs of hospitalizations, physician fees, outpatient care, and emer-
gency services where applicable. Physician fees, outpatient care,
Grover et al Hypertension and COX-2 Inhibitors 93
emergency services, and drug prescriptions also included in the
model have been reported previously in detail.18
American health care costs were derived from published reports.
Hospital costs were based on the National Medicare Provider
Analysis and Review data and the National Sample of the Health
Care Costs and Utilization Project.19,20 Laboratory tests and physi-
cian fees were based on the Medicare Resource-Based Relative
Value Scale.21 Annual medication costs were derived from the 1998
Drug Topics Red Book.22
Role of the Study Sponsor
This investigator-initiated study was supported by a grant-in-aid
from Pfizer Canada, Inc, which manufactures celecoxib. The sponsor
of the study had no role in data analysis, data interpretation, or
writing of the report. Before submission, the study sponsor made
nonbinding suggestions to the study authors.
Results
Using survey data from NHANES III, 26 million individ-
uals were estimated to have physician-diagnosed osteoarthri-
tis. The prevalence of osteoarthritis grew with increasing age
for men and women. The use of antihypertensive medications
also grew with increasing age. A total of 440 adults 50
years of age reported a diagnosis of osteoarthritis and were
taking antihypertensive medication. This represents a popu-
lation of 7.3 million American adults. The prevalence of
cardiovascular disease and associated cardiovascular risk
factors are summarized in Table 1. The average age of this
population was 69 and 28% were male. Coronary heart
disease had been diagnosed previously in 26% of respon-
dents, and 11% had experienced a cerebrovascular accident.
Congestive heart failure was also present in 12% of respon-
dents, and diabetes was reported in 28%. Blood pressure
averaged 144/76 mm Hg among those who were receiving
treatment for hypertension.
Compared with the baseline characteristics of patients
enrolled in the SUCCESS VI study, the NHANES III popu-
lation appears to be at somewhat higher risk of future
cardiovascular events. In SUCCESS VI, the mean age was
74, and 33.5% of participants were male. Coronary artery
disease was diagnosed in 18% of participants and conges-
tive heart failure in 5%. Baseline blood pressure was also
lower than in the NHANES III population, averaging 138/
76 mm Hg. These data reflect the study exclusion criteria
whereby patients had to have a diastolic blood pressure of
95 mm Hg and a systolic blood pressure of 160 mm Hg to
enter the study. Those with New York Heart Association
Class III or IV heart failure were also excluded. Presence of
cigarette smoking, diabetes, and blood lipid levels were not
reported.
In SUCCESS VI, rofecoxib was associated with a 2.26%
net increase in systolic blood pressure compared with cele-
coxib. We therefore estimated the cardiovascular events that
could be avoided if this increase in systolic blood pressure did
not occur (Table 2). Among American men and women 50
years of age, 30 000 stroke deaths and 25 000 coronary
deaths would be avoided among 7.3 million individuals with
osteoarthritis who are also taking antihypertensive medica-
tion. The majority of these events would be prevented in
women among whom osteoarthritis and hypertension are
more than twice as prevalent compared with men. After
discounting future events 3% annually, this would translate
into 449 000 person years of life saved, including 123 000
among men and 326 000 among women (Table 3). When the
direct health care costs associated with treating cardiovascu-
lar disease are also considered, the cost savings of maintain-
ing blood pressure control exceed $1.43 billion, including
$227 million among men and $1.2 billion among women.
The potential benefits of not raising systolic blood pressure
were also considered for 3.8 million Americans with osteo-
arthritis who are not taking antihypertensives but had a blood
pressure of 140/90 mm Hg. The baseline characteristics of
this population are also summarized in Table 1. Compared

with adults receiving antihypertensives, they tend to be older,
are more likely to be male but less likely to have cardiovas-
cular disease or diabetes, and have higher mean systolic blood
pressure. Among these untreated hypertensive adults,
17 000 stroke deaths and 14 000 coronary deaths would be
avoided (Table 4). An additional 219 000 person years of life
saved would be associated with better blood pressure control
as well as $945 million in direct health care cost savings
(Table 5).
Overall, the potential benefits of maintaining blood pres-
sure control in these 2 populations could exceed 47 000
stroke deaths and 39 000 coronary deaths prevented,
668 000 person years of life saved, and $2.4 billion in
direct health care cost savings.
Discussion
These analyses suggest that a small but significant net
increase in the average systolic blood pressure among indi-
viduals receiving COX-2­specific inhibitors could translate
into a substantial increase in cardiovascular risk and prema-
ture mortality. Direct health care costs associated with treat-
ing cardiovascular disease would also increase. One must
acknowledge these results are based on estimates derived
from the Markov model simulation and not a large head-to-
head clinical trial. Nonetheless, there is a substantial body of
evidence to support the conclusion that small changes in
blood pressure among individuals with osteoarthritis and
hypertension will prove to be clinically important and costly
as well.
The benefits of treating systolic hypertension have been
confirmed in such studies as the Systolic Hypertension in the
Elderly Program (SHEP).23 During 4.5 years of follow-up,
active treatment was associated with a 12-mm drop in systolic
blood pressure and a 4-mm drop in diastolic blood pressure.
For individuals 60 years of age, this resulted in a significant
36% reduction in stroke and 27% reduction in clinical
nonfatal myocardial infarction plus coronary death. However,
one must recognize that the blood pressure changes observed
in SHEP were 4-fold greater than those observed in the
SUCCESS VI study.
In the Heart Outcomes Prevention Evaluation (HOPE)
study, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ramipril)
was compared with placebo among patients who were at high
risk for a cardiovascular event.24 Approximately 50% of the
patients had documented hypertension, and the average blood
pressure at entry into the study was 139/79 (nearly identical
to the baseline blood pressure of SUCCESS VI patients). At
the end of the study, systolic blood pressure among the
ramipril-treated group was 3 mm Hg lower than the placebo
group. In spite of this small change in blood pressure,
ramipril significantly reduced the rates of death, myocardial
infarction, and stroke by 20% to 32%. The HOPE investiga-
tors have used epidemiological data to suggest that the blood
pressure benefits observed with treatment could not fully
account for the entire observed reduction in stroke or myo-
cardial infarction.25 However, recent re-analyses of blood
pressure data from the Framingham Heart Study suggest that
the benefits of reducing blood pressure may have been
underestimated previously in observational studies.26
In the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering treatment to
prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT), the doxazosin arm of
the study was terminated prematurely after 3.3 years of
follow-up because of a significantly increased risk of stroke,
combined cardiovascular events, and congestive heart failure

compared with patients receiving the diuretic chlorthali-
done.27 Once again, the difference in blood pressure between
the 2 groups ranged from 2 to 3 mm of systolic blood pressure
during the 3-year follow-up of the study. The recently
published final report of ALLHAT also demonstrated that the
angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor lisinopril versus the
diuretic chlorthalidone was associated with a higher com-
bined rate of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and heart fail-
ure.28 Once again, chlorthalidone was associated with a
greater reduction in systolic pressure of 2- to 3-mm difference
in systolic blood pressure in favor of chlorthalidone.
The results presented herein are also consistent with an
earlier analysis by Cook et al in which the impact of a 2-mm
reduction in diastolic blood pressure was estimated to result
in a 6% reduction in coronary heart disease events and a 15%
reduction in stroke.29 This analysis was based on Framingham
Heart Study data and population survey data from the
NHANES II. A 2-mm reduction in diastolic blood pressure
approximates a 4-mm drop in systolic blood pressure based
on an overview analysis of 14 randomized trials of antihy-
pertensive drugs published by Collins et al.25
In the absence of long-term clinical trial data, the estimates
presented in these analyses have been necessarily conserva-
tive. Only adults 50 years of age are included in these
analyses. NHANES III participants representing 1 million
adults were also excluded from the analyses because of
missing data on cardiovascular risk factors. We also recog-
nize that the diagnosis of osteoarthritis used in NHANES III
was based only on patient self-report. However, this data set
provided the complete assessment of cardiovascular risk
factors necessary for our analyses. Nonetheless, one would
expect that the absolute prevalence of osteoarthritis presented
herein may be somewhat inflated. It should be recognized that
in SUCCESS VI, clinically important blood pressure in-
creases were observed despite the fact that a patient's
antihypertensive medication could be titrated upward as
required by the treating physician.13 Blood pressure changes
were also more likely to be noticed in this clinical trial setting
in which blood pressure was a primary outcome and mea-
sured 3 over 6 weeks. Recent analyses of the NHANES III
data demonstrate that the diagnosis and treatment of hyper-
tension on a national basis is probably less optimal. It is
estimated that 31% of Americans were unaware that they had
hypertension, and only 23% were taking medications that
control their hypertension adequately.30,31 Accordingly, it is
reasonable to expect that blood pressure destabilization is
more likely to go unnoticed in routine clinical practice than
that observed in the SUCCESS VI study. Finally, although
these analyses focused only on COX-2 inhibitors, blood
pressure destabilization has also been observed with many
nonspecific NSAIDs.11,12
SUCCESS VI was not large enough or long enough in
duration to demonstrate a significant difference in coronary
events or stroke. Nonetheless, the significant increase in
peripheral edema among rofecoxib-treated patients (9.5%)
versus celecoxib-treated patients (4.9%; P0.01) and the 4
cases of congestive heart failure all among the rofecoxib
group (P0.058) support the conclusion that small average
changes in blood pressure among a patient cohort are not
benign because they may represent large changes among a
few susceptible patients.13 Whereas a 3-mm increase is the
average change observed in the study, 17% of patients were
significantly (P0.05) more likely to have a clinically
important increase of 20 mm in their blood pressure in the
rofecoxib group compared with 11% in the celecoxib group.
It appears that neither treatment is without any risk
whatsoever.
Additional data from a similar but larger study (SUCCESS
VII) confirms an increased risk of edema and an increase in
systolic blood pressure among patients receiving rofecoxib
versus celecoxib.14 In SUCCESS VII, additional analyses
also suggest that calcium channel blockers or diuretic model
therapy may protect against the blood pressure increases
noted with rofecoxib, suggesting that hypertension is avoid-
able with appropriate detection and treatment.
The results of the 2 large COX-2­specific inhibitor gastric
toxicity trials and 2 observational studies also support the
conclusion that rofecoxib may increase the risk of coronary
events. Cardiovascular outcomes were measured in 2 large,
recently published long-term studies. In the VIGOR trial,
myocardial infarction was observed in 0.4% of the rofecoxib-
treated patients versus 0.1% of the naproxen-treated patients
(relative risk, 0.2; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.1 to 0.7).3
A similar comparison between 400 mg of celecoxib twice
daily versus 800 mg of ibuprofen 3 per day or 75 mg of
diclofenac twice daily demonstrated no significant increase in
cardiovascular events in the celecoxib group (0.9) versus the
combined NSAID group (1.0).4 In a large cohort study
conducted by Ray et al, the users of high doses of rofecoxib
(25 mg) were found to be at increased risk of experiencing
serious coronary heart disease compared with nonusers (in-
cidence rate ratio of 1.7 with 95% CI of 0.98 to 2.95).10
Another large cohort study by Mamdani et al found hospital-
izations for congestive heart failure were more frequent in
rofecoxib users relative to controls not exposed to NSAIDs
(adjusted rate ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.5 to 2.2).32 In this study,
celecoxib users had a risk of congestive heart failure compa-
rable to that of the NSAID­nai
¨ve controls (adjusted rate ratio,
1.0; 95% CI, 0.8 to 1.3). There was also a significantly higher
risk associated with rofecoxib versus celecoxib (adjusted rate
ratio, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.0 to 1.9). Finally, a case-control study of
Medicare beneficiaries by Solomon et al compared the
cardiovascular safety of COX-2­specific inhibitors to un-
treated controls or those receiving nonspecific NSAIDs. In 1
analysis, rofecoxib use was associated with a significantly
increased risk of new onset hypertension relative to NSAIDs
(OR, 1.4), celecoxib (OR, 1.6), or not taking any NSAID
(OR, 1.6).33 In a second analysis of the same data set,
rofecoxib was also associated with an increased risk of acute
myocardial infarction compared with celecoxib (OR, 1.24)
and with not taking NSAIDs.34 Case-control studies cannot be
used to prove causality, but these results and the others
presented herein do suggest that rofecoxib is associated with
blood pressure destabilization, which may result in increased
cardiovascular complications.35
Perspectives
Hypertension and osteoarthritis are common conditions
among middle-aged and elderly Americans. The prescription
96 Hypertension January 2005
of COX-2­specific inhibitors is likely to increase given the
concerns regarding NSAID-associated gastrointestinal toxic-
ity. Increases in systolic blood pressure have been observed
among hypertensive patients receiving NSAIDs and COX-2­
specific inhibitors, and clinically important hypertension may
also occur. These changes may represent clinically important
events among specific patients. They should not be ignored
because they could result in a substantial increase in cardio-
vascular events and associated premature mortality. The
estimated health care costs associated with treating these
cardiovascular events appear to be substantial. Individuals
with hypertension who are also treated with an NSAID are at
increased risk of blood pressure destabilization. This may
lead to an increased risk of cardiovascular events.
