Vitamin and Mineral Supplement Use
by Children and Adolescents in the 1999-2004
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Relationship With Nutrition, Food Security, Physical Activity, and Health Care Access
Ulfat Shaikh, MD, MPH; Robert S. Byrd, MD, MPH; Peggy Auinger, MS
Objective: To determine if vitamin and mineral supple-
ment use among children and adolescents in the United
States is associated with nutrition, food security, physi-
cal activity, and health care access.
Design: Secondary analysis of nationally representa-
tive data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nu-
trition Examination Survey.
Setting: Questionnaires, household interviews, and medi-
cal examinations.
Participants: Children and adolescents 2 to 17 years
of age (N=10 828).
Main Exposure: Vitamin and mineral supplement use
in the past month.
Main Outcome Measures: Demographics, nutrition,
food security, physical activity, and health care access.
Results: Approximately 34% (SE 1.2) used vitamin and
mineral supplements in the past month, with under-
weightsubjectsreportinggreaterintake.Youngerage,non-
Hispanic white race/ethnicity, being born in the United
States, higher milk intake, lower total fat and choles-
terol intake, higher dietary fiber intake, higher income,
greater food security, lower media/computer use, greater
physical activity, lower body mass index, health insur-
ance coverage, better health care access, and better self-
reported health were associated with greater use of vi-
tamin and mineral supplements. Such supplements
contributed significantly to total daily dietary intakes of
vitamins and minerals.
Conclusions: A large number of US children and ado-
lescents use vitamin and mineral supplements, which for
most may not be medically indicated. Such supple-
ments contribute significantly to total dietary intakes of
vitamins and minerals, and studies of nutrition should
include their assessment. Since vitamin and mineral
supplement users report greater health care access, health
care providers may be in a position to provide screening
and counseling regarding dietary adequacy and indica-
tions for supplement use.

SUPPLEMENTAL VITAMIN AND
mineral (VM) use is common
intheUnitedStates.1-3 Therea-
sons for VM supplementa-
tion appear to be multifacto-
rial and such supplements are largely
deemed unnecessary if one has a varied
diet.4-6 Still, almost $2 billion is spent an-
nuallyonVMsupplements,andtheyarethe
third most common category of medica-
tions used in the United States.7 Multivita-
minpreparationsforolderchildrenandado-
lescents are not regulated by the Food and
Drug Administration and may result in ad-
verse effects ranging from nausea, vomit-
ing, and abdominal pain to increased cere-
brospinal pressure, liver abnormalities, and
neuropathy.8 TheAmericanAcademyofPe-
diatrics does not recommend supplemen-
tal vitamin use for healthy children older
than 1 year who consume a varied diet.
Supplemental vitamins are only recom-
mended for certain groups of children, eg,
those with chronic diseases, eating disor-
ders, malabsorption, and liver disease and
obese children in weight loss programs.8
Research focusing on the association of
VM use with nutrition practices and physi-
cal activity has been conducted mainly in
adolescents and adults.1,4,5,9-11 Studies using
a theoretical framework that examine the
relationship of VM use with food secu-
rity and health care access are limited. The
Health Belief Model (HBM) is a theoreti-
cal framework used to explain and pre-
dict health behaviors by focusing on atti-

tudes and beliefs. Constructs of the HBM have successfully
been applied to explain and improve preventive health
behaviors and health care use behaviors in adults, such
as folate consumption for the prevention of neural tube
defects and calcium supplementation for the preven-
tion of osteoporosis.12-15 According to this model, an in-
dividual will take a health-related action if he or she feels
and expects that it will help avoid a negative condi-
tion.16 Constructs of the HBM include perceived suscep-
tibility, perceived severity, perceived benefits, and per-
ceived barriers to performing the action. The HBM may
explain why some individuals may choose to use VM
supplements (perceptions that one's diet is inadequate,
VM deficiency affects health, or using VM supplements
will benefit health or stimulate appetite; individual fi-
nancial ability to afford VM supplements; and health care
provider guidance with respect to the need for VM
supplementation).
Based on theoretical constructs of the HBM, we pos-
ited that VMs might be used to ameliorate the adverse
effects of less healthy nutrition, lower food security, and
lower levels of physical activity or as insurance against
barriers to full health care access. Using data from the
1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), we tested the following hypotheses:
(1) VM use is higher in children and adolescents with
unhealthy nutrition habits compared with those with
healthy nutrition habits, (2) VM use is higher in chil-
dren and adolescents who experience lower food secu-
rity compared with those who experience greater food
security, (3) VM use is higher in children and adoles-
cents with lower levels of physical activity compared with
those with higher levels of physical activity, (4) VM use
is higher in children and adolescents who have lower
health care access compared with those who have higher
health care access, and (5) VM use is higher in under-
weight children and adolescents compared with those who
are not underweight.
METHODS
We analyzed the NHANES 1999-2004, which contains nation-
ally representative data on comprehensive dietary supplement
use in the United States. Sampling weights were used to pro-
duce population estimates, and subgroups oversampled in-
cluded those with low incomes as well as African American in-
dividuals, Mexican American individuals, and adolescents.17 The
survey entailed administration of a questionnaire, a house-
hold interview, and a medical examination. Signed consent was
provided by parents of all children, and adolescents addition-
ally signed an information form.
Our study sample included 10 828 children, aged 2 to 17
years, who had parent- or guardian-reported response to the
VM supplement intake question and measured height and
weight. Aggregate response rates for the NHANES 1999-2004
interview component were approximately 82% and comple-
tion rates for the medical examination component were 77%.17
VM SUPPLEMENT DATA COLLECTION
Intake of VM in the NHANES database was measured by deter-
mining whether the child had used any VM supplements in the
30 days prior to the interview, as well as the frequency and du-
ration of supplement use. Parents were shown a card with ex-
amples of multiple types of VM supplements. Interviewers ad-
ditionally recorded names of supplements from container labels.
If a container was unavailable, the interviewer asked for the ex-
act name of the product. If the exact name was unknown, gen-
eral category of VM supplement was assessed. Trained NHANES
nutritionists subsequently matched and categorized supple-
ment databases on standardized classification rules.17
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC AND FOOD SECURITY
DATA COLLECTION
Demographic characteristics of subjects included age, sex,
race/ethnicity, country of birth, poverty status, and food secu-
rity. We stratified the age variable into the following 3 catego-
ries: 2 to 4 years (preschool age), 5 to 11 years (school age),
and 12 to 17 years (adolescents). We categorized poverty sta-
tus into the following 3 categories: living below the poverty
level (1 poverty income ratio), near poor (1 to 2 poverty
income ratio), and nonpoor (2 poverty income ratio). Food
security data were classified within the NHANES as food
secure, marginally food secure, food insecure without hunger,
and food insecure with hunger. Additional information on
food security in the NHANES relates to receipt of food assis-
tance in the form of Special Supplemental Nutrition Program
for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC) benefits, food
stamps, and reduced-price or free school meals.
HEALTH STATUS AND HEALTH CARE ACCESS
DATA COLLECTION
Medical and health care access factors included current health
status, long-term health problems, health insurance coverage,
access to a routine place for health care, place used most often
for health care, number of times health care was received over
the past year, and length of time since last health care visit. We
used measured height and weight to calculate age- and sex-
specific body mass index (BMI) (calculated as weight in kilo-
grams divided by height in meters squared). We then classi-
fied BMI as underweight (fifth BMI percentile), healthy weight
(fifth to 85th BMI percentile), overweight (85th to 95th
BMI percentile), and obese (95th BMI percentile).18,19
NUTRITION AND PHYSICAL ACTIVITY
DATA COLLECTION
Nutrition behavior was assessed during the NHANES inter-
view by the number of times per week restaurant food was eaten,
number of times per month dark-green vegetables were eaten,
and frequency of milk consumption in the past 30 days. The
frequency of milk consumption was reported as never, rarely
(less than once a week), sometimes (once a week or more but
less than once a day), or often (once a day or more). Nutrient
intake was determined from foods and beverages reported in
the 24-hour dietary recall. Intake of micronutrients com-
monly present in multivitamin and mineral supplements was
additionally considered. The intake of each nutrient variable
was categorized into terciles prior to analysis.
Physical activity was assessed during the NHANES inter-
view by determining the frequency and duration of walking or
bicycling over the past month for those 12 years and older. The
level of self-reported physical activity in the past month was
classified in the NHANES database as vigorous (causing heavy
sweating or a large increase in breathing or heart rate for at least
10 minutes) or moderate activity (causing light sweating or a
slight to moderate increase in breathing or heart rate for at least
10 minutes). Subjects were also asked to compare their level

of physical activity with others of the same age. Sedentary ac-
tivity was assessed by asking about the number of hours per
day of television/video viewing and computer use.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Data were analyzed using SAS for Windows (SAS Institute, Inc,
Cary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN (Research Triangle Insti-
tute, Research Triangle Park, North Carolina), a statistical pack-
age that accounts for the complex survey design of the NHANES.
All analyses were weighted and adjusted for nonresponse to be
representative of the US population. 2 Tests were used to com-
pare the prevalence of VM use by sociodemographic, health sta-
tus, health care access, nutrition, and physical activity charac-
teristics. Multivariable logistic regression was used to examine
associations of VM use with age, sex, race/ethnicity, country
of birth, and poverty. In addition, independent associations with
nutritional factors, food security, physical activity, and health
care access were assessed controlling for race and poverty
interactions.
RESULTS
In the previous 30 days, 34.2% (SE 1.2) of 2- to 17-year-
old children and adolescents in our sample had taken a
VM supplement (Table 1). Almost half of children and
adolescents took VM supplements daily.
BIVARIATE ANALYSES
Sociodemographic Characteristics
and Food Security
Prevalence of VM use was significantly higher in younger
age groups, with the prevalence in 2- to 4-year-olds,
5- to 11-year-olds, and 12- to 17-year-olds being 43.1%,
37.4%, and 26.6%, respectively (P.001). There was no
significant difference in VM use by sex. Non-Hispanic
whiteindividualswerestatisticallysignificantlymorelikely
to be users of VM supplements and non-Hispanic Afri-
can American individuals were least likely to be VM us-
ers. Children and adolescents born in the United States
and those living in households with higher incomes were
more likely to use VM supplements. Users of VM supple-
ments were more likely to live in households that were
fully food secure or experienced food insecurity with hun-
ger than in households that were marginally food se-
cure or food insecure without hunger. Additionally, us-
ers of VM supplements were more likely to live with adults
who were fully food secure or experienced food insecu-
rity with hunger than with adults who were marginally
food secure or experienced food insecurity without hun-
ger. Analysis of child and adolescent food security dem-
onstrated a statistically significant relationship with VM
use; the prevalence of VM supplement use was highest
among those whose food quality and quantity remained
unaffected (36.1%) and declined if children or adoles-
cents were marginally food secure (26.2%), experi-
enced reduced food quality or quantity (23.9%), and ex-
perienced food insecurity with hunger (15%). Users of
VM supplements were significantly less likely to receive
food assistance in the form of WIC benefits, food stamps,
and reduced-price or free school meals (Table 1).
Health Status and Health Care Access
Use of VM supplements was significantly higher in chil-
dren and adolescents whose health status was reported as
excellent (37.1%) or very good (34.7%) compared with
those whose health status was reported as good (26.7%)
or fair/poor (28.3%). There was no association of VM
supplement use with self-reported long-term health im-
pairment. Use of VM supplements showed a statistically
significant relationship with BMI category; the preva-
lence of VM use was highest among those who were un-
derweight (41.6%) and declined in those who were a
healthybodyweight(36.0%),overweight(30.5%),orobese
(28.6%). Those with health insurance coverage were more
likely to use VM supplements compared with those with-
out health insurance. Children and adolescents who re-
ported having a routine place to go for health care were
significantlymorelikelytouseVMsupplementsthanthose
without a routine place to go for health care. Use of VM
supplements was more prevalent in children and adoles-
cents whose usual source of health care was a physician's
office or freestanding health maintenance organization
(38.5%), compared with those whose usual source of care
was a community health center (24.6%) or an emergency
department(18.0%).Analysisofthenumberoftimeshealth
care was received over the past year demonstrated a sta-
tistically significant relationship with VM use; the preva-
lence of VM supplement use was highest among those who
receivedhealthcare4ormoretimesinthelastyear(39.1%)
and was lowest if no health care was obtained in the last
year (25.3%). Children and adolescents who reported re-
ceiving health care services more frequently over the past
year(4timesperyear)alsoreportedmoreVMuse.Those
who reported their last health care visit to have occurred
in the past year were significantly more likely to use VM
supplements than those who had health care visits 2 or
more years ago (Table 2).
Nutrition and Physical Activity
Use of VM supplements was lowest in children and ado-
lescents who never ate restaurant food or ate it less than
weekly (29.3%), compared with those who ate restau-
rant food 1 or more times a week (35.9%). There was no
relationship of VM supplement use with frequency of
dark-green vegetable consumption. Use of VM supple-
ments was significantly associated with frequency of milk
consumption in the past 30 days. When dietary intakes
of specific nutrients were assessed, those with higher di-
etary fiber intake, lower-tercile total fat, and lower- and
middle tercile cholesterol intake reported higher VM use.
There was no difference in VM use with respect to di-
etary intake of energy, protein, carbohydrates, total sug-
ars, and total saturated fat. Those with higher intakes of
micronutrients commonly present in VM supplements,
namely vitamin A, thiamine, riboflavin, niacin, vitamin
B6
, folic acid, vitamin B12
, vitamin C, calcium, iron, and
zinc, all had greater reported VM use.
Subjects 12 years and older who participated in vigor-
ous physical activity in the past month and who reported
that they were more physically active compared with oth-
ers of the same age were significantly more likely to use

VM supplements. In addition, adolescents who partici-
pated in moderate physical activity in the past month and
those more likely to have played or exercised hard showed
a trend toward more VM use, although the association was
not statistically significant. Adolescents who used VM
supplements were statistically significantly more likely to

counting for the interaction of race and poverty.
Frequency of health care visits, diet and physical ac-
tivity patterns, and sedentary behaviors may potentially
vary by age group. Therefore, we constructed 5 separate
regression models to adjust for the effect of age of the child
on each of the following variables: number of health care
visits in the past year, how long ago the last health care
visit occurred, frequency of eating restaurant food, fre-
quency of milk consumption in the past 30 days, and hours
per day of television/video viewing or computer use. The
only variable that became nonsignificant when control-
ling for age of the child was milk consumption (P=.23).
All others variables remained significant at P.01.

VM supplements in the preceding month. Our results sup-
ported our hypothesis that underweight children would
have the highest use of VM supplements. However, in
contrast to what we expected to find, children and ado-
lescents with healthier nutrition, more active lifestyles,
greater food security, and greater health care access were
more likely to use VM supplements.
Published literature supports the high prevalence of VM
use. More than half of all 3-year-olds in the 1991 Longi-
tudinal Follow-up to the 1988 National Maternal and In-
fantHealthSurveyusedaVMsupplement.9 Consistentwith
our study's findings, children who received supplementa-
tiontendedtohaveeatingproblemsorpoorappetites.Moth-
ers who gave their children supplements were more likely
to be non-Hispanic white, married, and older and have
highereducationandgreaterhouseholdincomethanmoth-
erswhodidnotgivetheirchildrensupplements.9 Datafrom
the 1981 Child Health Supplement to the National Health
Interview Survey (NHIS) demonstrate that approximately
50% of children from birth to 6 years of age received a VM
supplement.10 Inastudyusing1986NHISdata,43%ofchil-
dren aged 2 to 6 years received VM supplements in the pre-
vious 2 weeks.1 Results from the Fourth Child and Ado-
lescentTrialforCardiovascularHealthstudydemonstrated
thatoneinfour12thgradersusedVMsupplements.4,11 Con-
sistent with our findings, other studies have demon-
strated that adolescents who use VM supplements tend to
have more healthful diets, lower television viewing, greater
levels of physical activity, greater participation in team and
organized sports, and less obesity than those who do not.4,5
More recently, Picciano et al20 examined dietary supple-
ment use among infants, children, and adolescents in the
United States using the 1999-2002 NHANES data set. Di-
etary supplement use was associated with higher family in-
come, not participating in the WIC program, a smoke-
freeenvironment,lessscreen-viewingtime(television,video
games, and computer use), and lower BMI. The associa-
tion of dietary supplement (specifically VM) use with nu-
trition, food security, physical activity, and health care ac-
cess was not examined.20 Therefore, analyses of other
national data sets show demographic and lifestyle charac-
teristicassociationssimilartothoseinourstudy,withhigher
VM use among non-Hispanic white individuals and those
with higher socioeconomic status, healthier diets, and level
of physical activity as well as those with less obesity.
Dixon et al21 analyzed the Third NHANES to deter-
mine if dietary intakes and serum nutrient levels dif-
fered between adults from food-insufficient and food-
sufficientfamilies.Afteradjustingforfamilyincome,adults
from food-insufficient families had lower intakes of milk
products, fruits and vegetables, energy, calcium, vita-
min E, vitamin B6
, iron, and zinc. Our study did not find
any association between adult or child food security and
VM use after controlling for poverty.
Strengths of our study are that the NHANES yields a
nationally representative sample and provides respon-
dent sampling weights to account for nonresponse and se-
lection bias. The in-person interview and rigorous meth-
odsofclassifyingVMsupplementsenablehigh-qualitydata
collection. We acknowledge the following limitations of
this study: (1) We did not include other dietary supple-
ment use in our analyses; the rationale for focusing on VM
supplementswasthatpublisheddatademonstratethatVMs
are the most commonly used dietary supplements both in
children and adults.2 (2) Analysis of individual compo-
nents of VM preparations was beyond the scope of this
study.(3)TheNHANESdatauseashortreferenttimeframe
of the past 30 days to assess VM supplement use. Al-
though this time frame is used to increase accuracy of self-
report and for comparability with other NHANES data, it
may not provide a complete picture of VM use. For ex-
ample, the short time frame may not capture episodic use
of VM supplements, such as supplemental vitamin C use
during viral upper respiratory tract infections, if the most
recent infection was prior to the 30-day period. (4) Since
NHANES data are cross-sectional, analyses of VM supple-
ment use with the lifestyle and health conditions mea-
sured in NHANES cannot presume causality, but only an
association. In spite of these limitations, we believe that
the results of our study offer guidance to health care pro-
viders on the extent of data gathering and counseling
needed regarding diet, physical activity, and VM supple-
ment use during clinical encounters.
Our study indicates that children and adolescents who
may face the greatest risks for VM deficiencies, such as
those with less healthy nutrition and activity patterns,
greater obesity, lower income, lower food security, poorer
health, and lower health care access, use VM supple-
ments the least. There exist multiple competing de-
mands for limited financial resources in families facing
financial disparities, and purchasing VM supplements to
mitigate the ill effects of a suboptimal diet might not take
precedence for such families. Thus, although individu-
als' perceptions within the framework of the HBM may
play a role in their intentions to use VM supplements,
modifying factors, such as financial ability to purchase
VM supplements, as depicted in the Figure, may super-
sede such intentions. We also note that sociodemo-
graphic factors influencing VM supplement use are simi-
lar to those affecting health behaviors related to

maintaining a nutritious diet, greater physical activity,
and healthy body weight.
Some children and adolescents who are underweight
may potentially benefit from VM supplementation, but for
other groups of VM users, medical benefits are less clear.
Since VM supplements significantly contribute to total nu-
trient intakes in children and adolescents, history of their
use and reasons for using them should be specifically elic-
ited. Because of greater health care access of VM supple-
ment users, health care providers are well positioned to
screen patients regarding nutritional quality of their diet
and VM supplement use. Health care providers can then
counsel parents that the American Academy of Pediatrics
does not recommend use of VM supplements in children
and adolescents with varied and healthy diets. It is impor-
tant to counsel parents of underweight children that use
of VM supplements is not a substitute for a physiologi-
cally appropriate diet. Our study also suggests that since
VM supplements contribute significantly to total dietary
intakes of vitamins and minerals, epidemiologic and clini-
cal studies of nutrition should include assessment of VM
supplement use. Further qualitative research is needed to
explore the relative importance of factors that influence
parental decision to use VM supplements for their chil-
dren, especially in those groups of children who face the
highest risks of VM deficiencies.
