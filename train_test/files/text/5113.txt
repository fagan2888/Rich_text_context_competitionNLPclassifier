ABSTRACT
PMD (Pelizaeus­Merzbacher disease) is a rare neurodegen-
erative disorder that impairs motor and cognitive functions
and is associated with a shortened lifespan. The cause of
PMD is mutations of the PLP1 [proteolipid protein 1 gene
(human)] gene. Transgenic mice with increased Plp1
[proteolipid protein 1 gene (non-human)] copy number
model most aspects of PMD patients with duplications.
Hypomyelination and demyelination are believed to cause
the neurological abnormalities in mammals with PLP1
duplications. We show, for the first time, intense microglial
reactivity throughout the grey and white matter of a
transgenic mouse line with increased copy number of the
native Plp1 gene. Activated microglia in the white and grey
matter of transgenic mice are found as early as postnatal
day 7, before myelin commences in normal cerebra. This
finding indicates that degeneration of myelin does not
cause the microglial response. Microglial numbers are
doubled due to in situ proliferation. Compared with the jp
(jimpy) mouse, which has much more oligodendrocyte
death and hardly any myelin, microglia in the over-
expressors show a more dramatic microglial reactivity than
jp, especially in the grey matter. Predictably, many classical
markers of an inflammatory response, including TNF-a
(tumour necrosis factor-a) and IL-6, are significantly up-
regulated manyfold. Because inflammation is believed to
contribute to axonal degeneration in multiple sclerosis and
other neurodegenerative diseases, inflammation in mam-
mals with increased Plp1 gene dosage may also contribute
to axonal degeneration described in patients and rodents
with PLP1 increased gene dosage.
Key words: inflammation, microglia, myelin, Pelizaeus­
Merzbacher disease, proteolipid protein, oligodendrocyte.
INTRODUCTION
PMD (Pelizaeus­Merzbacher disease) is an X-linked neurode-
generative disorder of the CNS (central nervous system)
caused by missense mutations, duplications and deletions of
the PLP1 [proteolipid protein 1 gene (human)] gene.
Duplications/triplications of the native PLP1 gene are most
frequent, accounting for nearly 70% of males that have PMD
(Garbern et al., 1999). Clinically, nystagmus, psychomotor
developmental delay, spasticity, hypotonia and ataxia present
within the first 2 months of life in connatal forms of the
disease (Hodes et al., 1993). Investigators have concluded that
a major biological function of PLP protein is to maintain the
structural integrity of the myelin sheath (Duncan et al., 1987;
Boison et al., 1995). However, the protein has other functions
that include regulation of oligodendrocyte cell death (Knapp,
1996; Yang and Skoff, 1997; Nadon and West, 1998; Cerghet
et al., 2001). There are currently no cures or treatment
options available for this rare disease, and the cellular and
molecular mechanisms that lead to the phenotypes are poorly
understood.
Transgenic rodents with Plp1 [proteolipid protein 1 gene
(non-human)] increased gene dosage are valid models for PMD
because they show the same behavioral deficits that include a
shortened lifespan as PMD patients (Mastronardi et al., 1993;
Kagawa et al., 1994; Readhead et al., 1994; Bradl et al., 1999).
At the cellular level, many different abnormalities have been
described in Plp1 transgenics that include not only defects in

oligodendrocytes but also neurons. Mice with Plp1 increased
gene dosage exhibit major oxidative phosphorylation defects
that include 50% reductions in ATP brain levels and decreased
mitochondrial membrane potentials in neurons as well as
oligodendrocytes (Hu
¨ttemann et al., 2009). Axonal degenera-
tion is also a peculiar feature of rodents that overexpress the
Plp1 gene (Anderson et al., 1998; Griffiths et al., 1998).
However, the sequence of events that begins with increased
Plp1 gene transcription and leads to axonal degeneration is
unknown. In the present study, we describe microglial
activation and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines
in the cerebrum of a transgenic mouse that overexpresses
native Plp1 (Plp1tg). The relevance of an inflammatory
response cannot be underestimated because inflammation is
a known major contributor to axonal damage and subsequent
neurological sequelae in many neurodegenerative diseases.
Microglial cells are considered resident macrophages of the
CNS that act as immune defence cells. In normal mature
brains, microglial cells are responsible for immune surveil-
lance (Block and Hong, 2005) and exhibit a distinctive
morphology in normal mammals. Microglia can also become
activated and turn into motile, amoeboid cells and play a
major role in initiation and progression of neurodegenerative
diseases (Dickson et al., 1991; Thomas, 1992; McGeer et al.,
1993; Kreutzberg, 1996; Gonzalez-Scarano and Baltuch,
1999). These cells undergo dramatic morphological altera-
tions upon brain injury or immunological stimuli transform-
ing from resting microglia into activated amoeboid microglia
(Kreutzberg, 1996). For example, in the demyelinating
disorder multiple sclerosis, microglia proliferate and increase
lysosomal activity around active sites of demyelination
(Matsumoto et al., 1992).
This is the first study that shows microglial activation in a
transgenic mouse that overexpresses native Plp1. Microglial
activation in the spinal cord of the jp (jimpy) mouse, a mouse
with a Plp1 missense mutation, characterized by its severe
hypomyelination has been described (Vela et al., 1995). The
optic nerve and spinal cord of Plp1tg mice are characterized
by demyelination, but the striatum and cortex are surprisingly
normal (Readhead et al., 1994). Therefore it would not be
expected that microglia exhibit intense reactivity in areas of
the cerebrum if microglial activation is based solely on
hypomyelination/demyelination. To our surprise, we found that
microglial activation begins before myelination commences in
the normal cerebrum. Accordingly, interactions between
oligodendrocytes and axons rather than frank demyelination
and/or hypomyelination must lead to axonal degeneration
(Garbern et al., 2002). Thus strategies to modulate oligoden-
drocyte function in vivo are necessary to alter the course of
PMD if myelin abnormalities are not the direct cause of certain
debilitating diseases (Garbern et al., 2002).
To support the hypothesis that an immune response is
occurring in Plp1tg mice, we found extensive microglial
activation accompanied by an increase in many cytokines
that are also elevated in CNS disorders. For example, TNF-a
(tumour necrosis factor-a) and IL-6 (interleukin-6) are
elevated in several CNS disorders (Navikas and Link, 1996;
Vladic et al., 2002; Baraczka et al., 2004). Recent studies
demonstrate that TNF-a exacerbates focal ischaemic brain
injury and that blocking endogenous TNF-a is neuroprotec-
tive (Barone et al., 1997). What role these cytokines play
in exacerbating oligodendrocytes and neuronal dystrophies in
animals with Plp1 increased gene dosage is yet to be
determined.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male and female 7, 19­27, 50 and 70 DPN (day postnatal)
B6CBA mice (Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, U.S.A.) and
male and female Plp1tg mice (Readhead et al., 1994) were
used for genotyping, immunocytochemistry, cytokine assays
and electron microscopy. Plp1tg mice aged 30 days and older
were first identified by tremors and seizures followed by
extraction of DNA from tails with the Qiagen DNA easy kit
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA, U.S.A.). DNA from both tremoring
Plp1tg mice and presumptive Plp1tg mice younger than 30
days were used to measure copy number. Copy number was
calculated with the DDCt
(Ct
is threshold cycle value) method
using a wild-type male with one Plp1 gene as the calibrator
(Regis et al., 2005). Plp1tg mice that had at least two extra
copies of the native Plp1 gene and exhibited tremors and
seizures were studied. QPCR (quantitative PCR) was per-
formed with an Eppendorf Realplex PCR system using SYBR
Green (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, U.S.A.). Seventeen­19 DPN jp
mice (jp+/+Ta; Ta is tabby) were obtained from our breeding
colony housed in the Division of Laboratory Animal
Resources, a federally approved animal facility. Plp1/jp/Ta
female carriers (jp+/+Ta) and males (+Ta) were purchased
from Jackson Laboratory. jp mice at 17­19 DPN were
identified by tremors and seizures and then genotyped by
PCR following the procedure in Hu
¨ttemann et al. (2009). All
mice were housed in DLAR animal facilities that are under the
direct supervision of IACUC, a federally approved institutional
committee; all procedures were approved by the Wayne State
University IACUC.
Immunocytochemistry
Mice were anaesthetized with an intraperitoneal lethal dose
of chloral hydrate. All animals were perfused intracardially
with 4% (w/v) paraformaldehyde and their brains were
removed and placed in buffer. Then, 50 mm sections were cut
with a Vibratome, washed with PBS, treated with 10% Triton
for 1 h, treated with 3% H2
O2
for 25 min, blocked with 10%
(v/v) goat serum for 30 min, and incubated in polyclonal anti-
Iba1 (ionized calcium-binding adaptor molecule 1) antibody
(Wako, Richmond, VA, U.S.A.) diluted 1:500 overnight in 0.1 M

PBS at room temperature (20°C). The next day, sections were
rinsed in PBS and incubated in goat anti-rabbit IgG HRP
(horseradish peroxidase; Jackson ImmunoResearch)-conju-
gated antibody diluted 1:100 and detected using 0.5 mg/ml
DAB (diaminobenzidine) without or with 0.2 mg/ml cobalt
chloride (Sigma­Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.).
For combined Iba1 and BrdU (bromodeoxyuridine)
immunostaining of 8 DPN mice, mice were injected with
100 mg of BrdU/g of body weight intraperitoneally and
perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde 40 h later. The interval
from injection to sacrifice permits microglia/microglial
precursors to divide and differentiate. Then, 50 mm sections
were cut with a Vibratome, washed in PBS, treated with 2 M
HCl for 30 min at 37°C, incubated in 0.1 M sodium borate
twice for 30 min at room temperature, treated with 3% H2
O2
,
incubated in PBS-blocking buffer (PBS containing 0.2% BSA,
0.2% milk and 1.0% Triton) for 30 min and incubated with
anti-BrdU (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, U.S.A.) diluted 1:100
at 4°C overnight. Sections were rinsed in PBS, incubated in anti-
mouse HRP (Jackson ImmunoResearch) conjugated and
developed with DAB. Sections were then rinsed in PBS and
processed for Iba1 immunocytochemistry as previously described
and developed using DAB without cobalt.
An F4/80 antibody (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was used to
detect macrophages in 3 months Plp1tg cervical spinal cords.
Then 50 mm sections (prepared as described above) were
rinsed in PBS, treated with 3% H2
O2
for 20 min, blocked with
10% goat serum for 1 h and incubated in polyclonal anti-F4/
80 antibody diluted 1:100 overnight in 0.1 M PBS at 4°C. The
next day, sections were rinsed in PBS and incubated in goat
anti-rat IgG HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson Immuno-
Research) diluted 1:100 and detected using 0.5 mg/ml DAB
(Sigma­Aldrich). As a positive control, spinal cord sections
from EAE (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis) mice
injected with MOG (myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein)
were stained alongside Plp1tg sections.
Quantification of microglia
Microglia in the cortex and striatum of Plp1tg 19­27 DPN
and B6CBA 23­27 DPN brain sections were counted using a
Leitz (Wetzlar, Germany) Laborlux microscope. Only cobalt
enhanced sections were used for counting. Cells were
counted with a 650 oil objective and a 610 eyepiece
containing a 1 cm2 grid divided into 1 mm squares. The grid
was placed over the dorsal cortex, immediately superior to the
corpus callosum and adjacent to the interhemispheric sulcus,
the ventral­lateral cortex, adjacent to the most ventral tip
of the corpus callosum, and the striatum, immediately inferior
to the corpus callosum and adjacent to the lateral ventricle
(Figure 6). For each animal, three matched transverse sections
at the level of the anterior commissure were used. The number
of cells for each area was summed and the averages
determined. Microglia were only counted if the nuclear
membrane was completely intact as visualized by focusing
completely through the section.
Plastic embedded tissue
Animals were perfused intracardially with 4% paraformalde-
hyde and 0.5% glutaraldehyde. Cerebra were dissected and 200
mm thick sections were embedded in Araldite plastic following
routine laboratory procedures (Bessert and Skoff, 1999). Semi-
thin sections (1 micron) were stained with Toluidine Blue.
Ultrathin sections were cut, stained with uranyl acetate and
lead citrate and examined with a Jeol 1010 transmission
electron microscope. Negatives were scanned at 1600 dpi (dots
per inch) using Adobe Photoshop.
Mouse inflammatory cytokines and receptors
PCR array
The Mouse Inflammatory Cytokines and Receptors RT2
ProfilerTM PCR Array (SABiosciences, Frederick, MD, U.S.A.)
that profiles the expression of 84 key genes involved in a
focused inflammatory pathway was run to screen for
inflammation in a Plp1tg mouse. Total RNA was isolated
from the brain of a Plp1tg mouse and a C57BL/6 control at 27
DPN using TRIzolH reagent (Invitrogen). RNA was purified
using RNeasyH Min EluteTM cleanup columns (Qiagen). RNA
(0.5­1 mg) from each sample was used to synthesize
the reverse transcriptase (cDNA) first strand following the in-
structions of RetroScript (Ambion, CA, U.S.A.). The cDNA is
used as a template in the RT profilerTM PCR Super Array, and
QPCR was performed following a two-step cycling pro-
gramme on Eppendorf MastercyclerH Eppendorf Realplex. The
fold change in gene expression was calculated using the DDCt
Data Analysis Method; the Plp1tg mouse used had four copies
of the Plp1 gene and showed tremors and seizures.
Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of cytokines
and chemokines
CCL3 (CC chemokine ligand 3), CCL8 (CC chemokine ligand 8)
and CRP (C-reactive protein) (Table 1) were determined by
QPCR. Reverse transcriptase was obtained as described above
and the reverse transcript was subjected to real-time PCR on
the Eppendorf MastercyclerH Eppendorf Realplex in the
presence of SYBR Green I dye (Stratagene). A two-step
QPCR was performed for 40 cycles (10 min at 95°C, 15 s at
95°C and 1 min at 60°C). Product identity was confirmed by
melting point analysis. GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
dehydrogenase) served as an internal reference gene in all the
experiments. Real-time PCR was performed in triplicates for
both the target gene and GAPDH. The level of gene expression
was calculated after normalizing against GAPDH in each
sample and is presented as relative mRNA expression. The
total cDNA subjected to amplification was calculated using
the DDCt
method.

RESULTS
Microglial morphology of Plp1tg compared with
B6CBA mice
Iba1 is a polyclonal antibody that recognizes an ionized
calcium-binding adaptor molecule that is only expressed in
microglia in the brain (Imai et al., 1996; Graeber et al., 1998;
Ito et al., 1998). This antibody has been used to identify
microglia in many mammalian species (Tonchev et al., 2003;
Yamada et al., 2006). Iba1 immunostained microglial cells are
present throughout the grey and white matter of both the
normal B6CBA and the Plp1tg mouse cerebrum (Figure 1).
Typical microglia in normal cerebra, often referred to as
ramified, have characteristic long and thin processes of even
calibre (Figure 1A). Their primary processes are usually twice
as long as the long axis of the perikaryon. Secondary processes
branch acutely from primary processes, and sometimes tertiary
processes are distinguishable. Perikarya are characteristically
oval-, pear- or triangular-shaped and are easily distinguished
from the smoothly contoured round oligodendroglia perikarya
and the larger, irregularly shaped astroglial perikarya. The
ramified morphology is similar across all age groups that we
studied in normal B6CBA mice.
Low-magnification pictures show that the distribution of
microglia in normal cerebra is evenly spaced, with minimal
contact between processes of neighbour microglia in both
the cortex (Figure 1B), striatum (Figure 1C) and corpus
callosum (Figure 1D).
In the Plp1tg mice, the morphology and dispersion of these
cells in the cortical, striatal and callosal regions of cerebra
drastically differ from the B6CBA controls (Figures 2A and 2B) in
all age groups analysed (Figures 2C­2F). Activated microglia in all
Plp1tg age groups are distinguished by coarse and short
processes, a notable increase in the amount of these processes,
and an enlargement of the cell body within the cortical
(Figures 2C and 2E) and striatal (Figures 2D and 2F) regions. In
the cortices, microglia are often clustered together with an
entanglement of brush-like processes. This arrangement has been
previously described and is due to actively proliferating microglia
cells as an early response to neurodegeneration (Dissing-Olesen
et al., 2007). This pattern is most easily observed between the
cortex and the white matter in the ventral cortex. In the striatum,
microglial processes run parallel with each other with long
straight processes, as if they are following axonal trajectories.
Corpora callosa of normal B6CBA mice appear to have
fewer microglia than grey matter (Figure 1D). When com-
pared with controls (Figures 1, 2A and 2B), white matter in
Plp1tg have an abundance of activated microglia
(Figures 3A­3C), with coarse, straight processes that parallel
the trajectory of callosal axons.
Microglial morphology of Plp1tg mice changes as
the mice age
With age, the activation of microglia increases in the Plp1tg
cerebra. In the cortices and striata at 30 DPN (Figures 2E and 2F),
microglia have stubby processes and are found in clusters with
other brush-like microglia. At 19 DPN (Figures 2C and 2D), the
transition from a ramified morphology to a reactive morphology
is noticeable as processes shorten in length and diameter. In the
striatum at 19 DPN (Figure 2D), cell processes do not follow a
particular path as do the 30 DPN (Figure 2F) processes.
In both white and grey matter at 7 DPN, the earliest age
studied, activation of microglia has already begun in the Plp1tg
cerebra (Figures 4C­4E). While many microglia have a normal
morphology, others exhibit shortened and numerous processes.
Individual microglia appear to have long, thin processes typical
of ramified microglia on one side of the cell and shortened,
numerous processes typical of reactive microglia at the opposite
side of the cell. Microglia in normal brains at this age (Figures 4A
and 4B) are similar to microglia at older ages, having long
processes that often end in an expanded ball. At 7 DPN in the
normal brain, myelinated fibres are not yet detectable in 1 mm
plastic sections (Figure 4F). Myelinated axons have dark rings
surrounding an opaque centre and easily visible in semi-thin
plastic sections. Therefore the activation of microglia at this age
is not due to abnormal myelin structure or demyelination.
Generation of new microglia in 8 DPN Plp1tg
mice
In addition to microglia activation beginning at 7DPN,
microglia are stimulated to divide at this young age.
Combined Iba1 and BrdU immunostaining was performed
on Plp1tg cerebra with two or more copies of Plp1. Mice were
injected intraperitoneally with BrdU on 6 DPN and killed 40 h
later on 8 DPN. Generation of new microglia is abundant
because Iba1+/BrdU+ microglia are present in the cerebrum
(Figures 5A­5D). Microglia in the metaphase stage of mitosis
(Figure 5B) have been detected, indicating that microglia

divided approx. 40 h earlier at the time of the BrdU injection
and shortly before killing. Figure 5 also shows many BrdU+
cells that are not Iba1+; these cells serve as a control to show
that the BrdU-labelled cells are not non-specifically labelled
with the Iba1 antibody. Some of these BrdU+ cells are Olig1+,
indicating that oligodendrocyte progenitors are stimulated to
divide (results not shown).
The number of microglia is increased in Plp1tg
mice
Plp1tg mice with increased gene dosage lead to an increase in
microglia cell number in both white and grey matter of the
cerebrum when compared with B6CBA mice. A low-
magnification micrograph (Figure 6A) shows a hemi-section
at the level of the anterior commissure at 30 DPN of the mice.
For quantification, only cobalt-enhanced sections were used
for both control and Plp1tgs. The number of Iba1+ microglial
cells was counted directly through the microscope with a
650 oil objective and a 610 eyepiece (see the Materials and

High magnification of a typical ramified microglial cell (A) shows several
long, thin processes emanating from an ellipsoid cell body. These primary
processes branch into secondary processes (arrows). In areas of the cortex (B)
and striatum (C), resting microglia are evenly dispersed throughout grey
matter with typical ramified morphology. In the corpus callosum (D),
microglia are less abundant than in grey matter, but retain their ramified
morphology. The cingulum is at the top of the Figure. Scale bars: (A) 10 mm

transgenics
Microglia from B6CBA mice at 50 DPN have similar morphology to microglia
at younger ages. Activated microglia are often clustered together with their
cell bodies having a fuzzy appearance due to numerous, short, thick
processes. In the striatum, more elongated and straighter processes are
visible, possibly following axonal trajectories. Microglia exhibit more
processes at 30 DPN (E, F) than at earlier ages (C, D). Scale bar, 50 mm.

methods section). It can be seen that 19­27-day-old Plp1tg
have significant increases (P,0.0001; Figure 6B) in all three
areas counted: dorsal cortex immediately superior to the
corpus callosum and adjacent to the inter-hemispheric sulcus,
the ventral­lateral cortex adjacent to the most ventral tip of the
corpus callosum, and the striatum immediately inferior to
the corpus callosum and adjacent to the lateral ventricle. The
results indicate that the density of microglia cells is higher in
Plp1tgs (Figure 6B), with a 76% increase in the dorsal cortex,
a 95% increase in the ventral­lateral cortex and 85%
increase in the striatum. It is likely that the increase in
microglia in Plp1tg mice is even greater than the cell counts
because microglia are clustered together and sometimes it is
difficult to determine the exact number.
Ultrastructure of microglia
Microglia in Plp1tg mice (Figures 7A and 7B) exhibit the same
nuclear and cytoplasmic features as ramified microglia in
normal mice. The chromatin forms a dense layer immediately
beneath the nuclear membrane and the density of the
cytoplasm is intermediate to that of oligodendrocytes and
astrocytes (Skoff, 1975). However, the activated microglia in

trajectories of callosal axons
At 30 and 50 DPN, microglia are more activated in the white matter
compared with the 19 DPN. Scale bar, 50 mm.

Microglia in the cortices (A) and striatum (B) of normal mice already display
the characteristic morphology of microglia at older ages. Their long processes
sometimes terminate in boutons (arrows) that are less prominent in microglia
from older mice. In the cortex (C), striatum (D) and corpus callosum (E), some
microglial cells in Plp1tg mice are already activated at this young age,
indicated by short, numerous processes emanating from microglia with large

Plp1tg mice often contain degenerating material of unknown
origin. They tend to have larger perikarya and thicker
processes than ramified microglia. These features probably
correspond to the larger cell body and thick coarse processes
visualized with Iba1 immunostaining. In addition to the
activated microglia present in Plp1tg, small, dark cells are also
occasionally present (Figures 7C and 7D). These cells have too
little cytoplasm to permit definitive classification. The cell in
Figure7(C) has the nuclear features of an oligodendrocyte
progenitor; the cell in Figure 7(D) has the nuclear features of
a microglial cell or oligodendrocyte as these cell types often
directly abut the perikarya of neuronal somata. Conversely,
they may be immune cells that have invaded the CNS.
Microglial response in jp mice
jp mice have a missense mutation in the Plp1 gene, and they
exhibit an intense astrocytic hypertrophy and hyperplasia
that accompanies the virtual lack of myelin (Skoff, 1976). In
contrast with the Plp1tg mice, microglial reactivity in jp is
restricted mainly to the white matter (Figures 8A and 8B).
Furthermore, the Iba1 immunostaining in jp does not appear
to be as intense as in the Plp1tgs.
Up-regulation of cytokines
Based on the intense reactivity of microglia in Plp1tg mice,
we predicted the up-regulation of classical inflammatory
markers. qRT­PCR (quantitative reverse transcription­PCR)

expression of different inflammatory markers showed
significant increases in two classical inflammatory markers,
TNF-a and IL-6; they were significantly increased by 24- and
7-fold respectively at 7­8 weeks after birth compared with
controls (Table 2). However, there was no increase in IL-1b or
iNOS (inducible nitric oxide synthase) at 7­8 weeks of age.
Based on a Mouse Inflammatory Cytokine and Receptor RT2
ProfilerTM (SABiosciences) that profiles the expression of 84
key genes, we selected the chemokines CCL3, CCL8 and
inflammatory marker CRP for qRT­PCR. Expression of CCL8
was significantly increased by 3.5-fold at 3 weeks and then
significantly increased by 15-fold by 8 weeks postnatal.
Expression of CCL3 was increased by 4-fold at 3 weeks and
only slightly increased by 4.8-fold at 8 weeks postnatal.
Similarly, CRP increased modestly from 3 to 8 weeks postnatal
compared with normal mice. These results indicate that
activation of inflammatory markers is well advanced by 3
weeks of age, and even increases for some markers as the
disease progresses.
The qRT­PCR data shown above confirm the results of a
cytokine and receptor Super Array profile performed on a Plp1tg
and a wild-type mice at 27 DPN that showed similar increases in
message levels for these chemokines (Table 3).
The cell types expressing these inflammatory markers and
their receptors are unknown but are likely to involve a
combination of macroglia, microglia and, possibly, immune
cells because markers of T and B immune cells have been
detected in the Plp1tg mice (Ip et al., 2006). We investigated
whether macrophages invaded the CNS in the Plp1tg mice.
The F4/80 surface antigen was easily detected in spinal cord
sections of C57BL/6 mice with EAE injected with MOG-(35­
55) (Figure 9A). However, spinal cord sections from Plp1tg
mice processed alongside the EAE sections showed non-
specific staining, mainly in axons (Figure 9B). The picture
shown here represents the most intense staining we found in
the overexpressors.
DISCUSSION
The coding region of the PLP1 gene in humans is identical with
the Plp1 gene at the amino acid level in rodents (e.g. Stoffel
et al., 1985; Macklin et al., 1987), suggesting that the
same mutations in rodents as in humans might exhibit
the same cellular abnormalities and behavioural deficits.
Indeed, increased gene dosage of the PLP1 gene in humans
and Plp1 gene in transgenic rodents exhibit many similar
behavioural abnormalities that include ataxia, tremors and
often a shortened lifespan (Garbern et al., 1999). At the tissue
level, both rodents and humans with increased gene dosage
exhibit demyelination and/or hypomyelination. At the cellular
level, death of oligodendrocytes and axonal degeneration have
been described in humans and in rodents with higher copy
number (Gow et al., 1998; Griffiths et al., 1998; Anderson et al.,
1999; Cerghet et al., 2001; Skoff et al., 2004a, 2004b). The
molecular and cellular sequence of events that cause the tissue
and behavioural abnormalities is poorly understood. Since PLP
is expressed at high levels only in oligodendrocytes, it is
generally assumed that oligodendrocytes and/or abnormal
structure of myelin must directly cause all the abnormalities,
including axonal degeneration. However, in many neurode-
generative diseases, secondary microglial activation and an
inflammatory response have been described in many human
diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis (Wojtera et al., 2005). In these neurodegen-
erative diseases, the contribution of microglia to inflammation
and neuronal destruction is a subject of intense investigation.
Hints that an inflammatory response was present in a human
case of PMD have been described because a young male
patient positively responded to corticosteroids (Gorman et al.,
2007). In rodents with higher copy number, markers of
immune and macrophage cells have been described (Ip et al.,
2006; Edgar et al., 2010), but whether, and to what extent,
inflammatory molecules are activated has not been examined.
Here, we describe for the first time intense microglial
reactivity in Plp1 transgenic mice and the up-regulation of

microglial cell is characterized by dense heterochromatin lining the nuclear

oligodendrocytes have much more electron-dense cytoplasm. Long, thin
strands of endoplasmic reticulum (arrows) with scattered ribosomes on their
surface are likewise a distinguishing feature of microglia. A large inclusion
(asterisk), as well as the remnants of an engulfed nucleus (arrowhead), is
present in the cytoplasm. (B) A microglial cell with a long, thickened process

classical inflammatory markers. Although it remains to be
determined whether and how the inflammation contributes
to the neural degeneration in the Plp1tg mice, the well-
known role of cytokine and chemokine activation in other
neurodegenerative diseases makes it likely that microglial
activation contributes to disease progression.
We find that increased Plp1 gene dosage in line 66 of the
Plp1tg mice (Readhead et al., 1994) leads to dramatic
morphological changes of microglia. The morphological
changes in microglia are as dramatic in the grey matter, if
not more so, than in the white matter. From 3 weeks
postnatal, shortening and thickening of microglial processes
became progressively more pronounced in grey matter, and
the number of microglial processes was increased. In the
striatum and corpus callosum, microglial processes were
increased, but they were longer and followed axonal
trajectories. Whether they are interposed between oligoden-
drocyte processes and axons or directly abut axons is unclear.
In active grey matter lesions in multiple sclerosis, activated
microglia appose and ensheath apical dendrites, neurites and
neuronal perikarya (Peterson et al., 2001). In the cerebral
cortex in multiple sclerosis patients, more recent studies have
demonstrated microglial activation associated with extensive
demyelination (Bo et al., 2003; Kutzelnigg et al., 2005;
Vercellino et al., 2005; Gray et al., 2008) but, more
interestingly, microglial activation was noted in regions that
are not demyelinated (Kutzelnigg et al., 2005). Following an
experimentally induced axonal lesion in C57BL/6 mice,
activated microglia were proliferating within 3 days and
most of the proliferating microglia were aggregating into
multicellular clusters (Dissing-Olesen et al., 2007), similar to
that observed in our study. Previous studies have examined
the distribution and morphology of microglia cells in diseased
or injured spinal cord and noted greater microglia activation in
white matter as opposed to grey matter (Vela et al., 1995; Vela
et al., 1996; Zhang et al., 2008). In jp, the numbers of white
matter microglia were 3­5-fold greater than in normal animals
but only 60% greater in grey matter than normal animals . We
found nearly a doubling of microglia in the grey matter of the
Plp1tg mice and, as noted in the Results section, these
numbers are likely to be underestimates because microglia are
densely clustered together. These and our present study (see
below) suggest that microglial activation is caused by other
factors/molecules besides degeneration of myelin.
Most importantly, by the first postnatal week, transforma-
tion of resting microglia into activated microglia has begun in

grey and white matter. Some microglia retain a normal
morphology, whereas others are retracting and thickening
their processes. The presence of myelin was examined in 1 mm
plastic sections of complete transverse cerebral sections, in
which individual myelinated axons can be resolved. At this
age, axons are still unmyelinated in normal cerebrum. This ob-
servation demonstrates that microglial activation is neither
due to demyelination nor due to hypomyelination. Of course,
the primary cause of the microglial activation must be
overexpression of the Plp1 gene, but not necessarily defects in
myelination. Both Plp1 mRNA and the protein are detectable
in mouse cerebra at this age (Macklin et al., 1991). While the
principal function of PLP is often considered to be that of an
adhesive molecule in myelin (Boison et al., 1995; Gudz et al.,
2002), numerous studies show that PLP and DM20 have other
functions (Nadon and West, 1998; Skoff and Knapp et al.,
1990; Knapp et al., 1993; Campagnoni and Skoff, 2001)
including regulation of cell death (Skoff et al., 2004a, 2004b).
Recently, we described major oxidative phosphorylation
defects in the Plp1tg mice that lead to 50% reduction of
tissue ATP and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. The
cause of these metabolic defects is likely due to the insertion
of PLP into mitochondria when the gene is overexpressed
(Hu
¨ttemann et al., 2009). Activation of microglia by increases
in extracellular or exogenous ATP has been described in
numerous studies (Lambert et al., 2010; Gyoneva et al., 2009;
Monif et al., 2009; Puthussery and Fletcher, 2009). Exogenous
ATP, in turn, activates microglial purinergic receptors.
However, as presented above, total ATP levels in tissue
homogenates are reduced in these mice. The possibility that
ATP or its degradation products are secreted into the
extracellular space at higher-than-normal amounts by
neuroglia is under investigation in our laboratory.
In Plp1tg mice, the number of Iba1+ microglia is doubled
by the third postnatal week, due to their endogenous
proliferation. Injection of BrdU on 6 DPN and killing 40 h
later on 8 DPN followed by Iba1 immunostaining show BrdU+/
Iba1+ microglia with long, branching processes characteristic
of resting microglia and microglia with short, slightly
thickened processes characteristic of activated microglia.
The cell proliferation studies, carried out between 6 and 8
DPN, lend further support to the hypothesis that microglial

activation is not due to demyelination/dysmyelination. Our
findings agree with the data from jp mouse studies that show
that endogenous microglia proliferate. In jp, activated
microglial cells in the grey matter of the spinal cord were
not associated with neurons, but were intermingled with
nerve fibres crossing the grey matter laminae (Vela et al.,
1995). The origin of additional microglia cells is unknown,
but it is suggested that the main source of macrophage/
reactive microglia cells in jp is the proliferation of
endogenous microglial cells (Vela et al., 1995).
The intense microglial reactivity in Plp1tg mice suggests
activation of multiple cytokines and chemokines. Not
surprisingly, mRNA expression of classical inflammatory
markers TNF-a and IL-6 were elevated 24- and 7-fold
respectively in 2-month-old animals. Since TNF-a and IL-6
are activated by other regulatory molecules, we performed a
multianalyte PCR analysis of inflammatory chemokines and
their receptors from a 27 DPN Plp1tg mouse. mRNA levels of
nine chemokines were elevated by more than 3-fold and
several were down-regulated. For some of these chemokines
such as CCL3/MIP-1a (macrophage inflammatory protein), its
receptor (CCR1) is also up-regulated.
Many types of immune and glial cells secrete the
chemokines and cytokines listed above. CCL3 and its receptor
CCR1 have been identified on astrocytes, oligodendrocytes
and radial glia after spinal cord injury (Knerlich-Lukoschus
et al., 2010). CCL3 has also been identified in microglial cell
lines of Sandhoff disease model mice (Kawashita et al., 2009).
CRP, usually associated with susceptibility to stroke (Di Napoli
et al., 2005), suppresses EAE, suggesting that it has a
protective effect in this experimental model of multiple
sclerosis (Szalai et al., 2002). CXCL13 (CXC chemokine ligand
13; BCA-1), a chemo-attractant for B lymphocytes, is down-
regulated in these mice, suggesting that B-lymphocytes may
not be attracted to the CNS. However, lymphocyte and
macrophage markers (CD8+ and CD11b+) have been detected
in aged heterozygous Plp1tg mice (Ip et al., 2006). We failed
to find evidence of macrophages in the Plp1tg mice using the
classical F4/80 antibody that we do not think is due to
technical issues because in the same immunostaining
experiment we identified F4/80+ cells in EAE mice. Our
failure to find vascular derived macrophage cells may be due
to the differences in age of the transgenic mice used in the
different studies. Increases in CD11b+ cells were first detected
at approx. 4 months in Plp1tg heterozygous mice and their
numbers increased with age (Ip et al., 2006); in contrast, we
used 1­2-month-old homozygous mice as they die at approx.
2 months of age. Because the CD11b+ marker is also
expressed by endogenous microglial cells (Clausen et al.,
2008; Santos et al., 2010; Bokhari et al., 2009), many CD11b+
cells may be microglia. Other studies have shown that
microglial precursors derived from embryonic stem cells
co-label with Iba1 and CD11b, CD45, F4/80 (Napoli et al.,
2009) and other immune cell markers, making it difficult to
distinguish between resident and invasive immune cells. Since
presentation of antigens by microglia to T-cells requires a
period of time (Brown and Neher, 2010), a combination of
both microglia and immune cells is likely present in Plp1tg
mice, the ratios of innate to humoral cells changing as
the rodents age. More important than identifying all the cell
types that contribute to inflammation in the Plp1tgs, the
molecular events that cause the inflammation and how
the different cytokines modulate neuronal function need to
be investigated. Importantly, the extent and type of
inflammation in PMD patients needs to be examined and
compared with rodents that overexpress Plp1.
