Introduction
The connection between stress and disease has been part of
folk wisdom for a long time and has even made its way
into our language with phrases such as `scared to death'
and `a broken heart'.1 Takotsubo syndrome (TS) is very
strongly connected to stressful events. Identified stressors
are mostly emotional, such as the death of a relative or a
quarrel, but can also be physical, such as the use of cocaine
or a subarachnoid haemorrhage.2 The complete pathophys-
iology of TS is unknown, but the leading hypothesis is that
overstimulation of the myocardium by catecholamines
elicited by a stressful trigger leads to the development of
severe contractile dysfunction, resulting in the characteristic

Abstract
Background: The connection between stress and disease has been part of folk wisdom for a long time and has even
made its way into our language with phrases such as `scared to death' and `a broken heart'. Takotsubo syndrome is a form
of acute, reversible heart failure characterized by ballooning of the left ventricle. Post-menopausal women are primarily
affected, but cases have been described in both sexes and at all ages. The complete pathophysiology is unknown, but
the disease has been connected to psychological or physical stress and a surge in catecholamines. Despite the strong
connection with stress, knowledge about the life of patients before the onset of Takotsubo syndrome is lacking.
Aim: The aim of this study was to describe and interpret patients' narratives about long-term stress experienced before
the onset of Takotsubo syndrome.
Method: Nineteen people diagnosed with Takotsubo syndrome were interviewed. The narrative interviews were
recorded and transcribed verbatim. The resulting texts were analysed using phenomenological hermeneutics.
Results: The analysis revealed that the interviewees lived under stressful circumstances, characterized by feeling
burdened by responsibilities, injustice and uncertainty, long before the onset of Takotsubo syndrome. This long-term
stress wore down the defences of the interviewees to the degree that their capacity was exhausted and the smallest
stressor could `tip them over the edge'. The findings indicated that the social structure of gender possibly contributed
to the interviewees' condition.
Conclusions: These findings indicated that long-term stressful circumstances may cause vulnerability to acute
psychological or physical stressors and, subsequently, to the onset of Takotsubo syndrome.

apical akinesia in the left ventricular muscle.3 In the acute
phase, TS mimics myocardial infarction and it is thought
that 1­2% of all patients with the clinical symptoms of a
myocardial infarction actually have TS. The mean age
range of patients with TS is between 58 and 75 and about
90% of cases occur in women.2 The large discrepancy in
the prevalence of TS between men and women has long
been established,2,4,5 but explanations of this are contradic-
tory and no clear pathophysiological explanation has been
established.6­8 Stress events are a common part of everyday
life9 and most people are not affected by TS, so these alone
cannot explain the syndrome, although there are factors
that may make some people more susceptible to a stress
trigger. Risk factors such as hormonal processes, endothe-
lial dysfunction, genetic factors and a lifetime prevalence
of depression have been suggested.10
The concept of stress is not always clearly defined and
the term is commonly used to describe both stressors and
the response to stressors.11 Selye12 defined stress as a non-
specific response of the body to any demand placed on it;
he assumed that all positive and negative things that create
a stress reaction are stressors and that the body's response
to different stressors is the same.12 Another widely used
definition is that by Lazarus and Folkman,13 who viewed
stress as a relationship between a person and the environ-
ment that taxes or exceeds the person's resources and
endangers their well-being.13 A distinction is often made
between acute stress, such as an earthquake or the sudden
death of a relative, and long-term or chronic stress, such as
caring for a sick loved one or stress at work.11 In medical
research, the concept has been adopted as a basis for exam-
ining the role of psychological factors in the causation and
progression of disease.9 In this study, stress is defined as a
taxing environment or event. The reaction of the body to
this environment or event is defined as the stress response.
Despite the strong connection between acute stress and
TS, there is a lack of research on how patients perceive
their life situation before the onset of TS and whether they
are subject to long-term stress. The aim of the study was to
describe and interpret patients' narratives about long-term
stress experienced before the onset of TS.
Methods
Design
To fulfil the aim of this study, we chose a qualitative
method, namely phenomenological hermeneutics, with an
explorative design. Narrative interviews were used to gain
knowledge about the informants' personal experiences.
The phenomenological hermeneutical method was devel-
oped to explore lived experience, which made it suitable
for this study.14
Participants and settings
Participants were selected after coronary angiography and
the following inclusion criteria were used: (a) an established
diagnosis of TS according to the Gothenburg criteria,15
which are used in the participating hospitals in Western
Sweden, in the previous six months; (b) being physically
and mentally capable of participating; and (c) able to speak
Swedish. A strategic sample was used to include partici-
pants of both sexes and of a wide age range. Twenty-five
patients were asked to participate, either at hospital or
by telephone after discharge; three declined, two were
excluded because no narrative could be obtained, and
one was excluded because she was not diagnosed with TS.
The remaining 19 participants were included in this study.
The characteristics and cardiovascular risk factors of these
patients are described in Table 1; there was no difference
between the men and women.
Ethical considerations
The study was approved by the Regional Ethical Review
Board of the University of Gothenburg (Application
No. 275-11 and Amendment T693-11) and conforms to
the Declaration of Helsinki.16 Informed consent was
obtained from each participant.
Data collection
The interviews were conducted during 2011 and 2012,
seven during hospital admission and 12 after discharge.
In two cases, a face-to-face meeting could not be arranged
and the interviews were conducted over the phone. Data
were collected through narrative interviews, which lasted
for 15­120 minutes and were recorded and transcribed
verbatim, resulting in rich descriptions. In total, the tran-
scribed interviews consisted of 165,789 words, equivalent
to 235 pages of text.
Interpretation of data
By analysing the narratives in the form of text, it is possi-
ble to take part in other peoples' experiences, which are
otherwise personal. The phenomenological hermeneutic
approach has been developed over the last two decades to
provide a structured and comprehensive way of interpreting

the meaning of a text. It draws on both phenomenology
and hermeneutics. From phenomenology, it takes its focus
on essential meaning and emphasizes that preconceptions
should be restrained. From hermeneutics, it takes the tra-
dition of interpretation because phenomena conveyed
through text cannot be understood without interpretation.
The analysis entails a circular stepwise process, back and
forth between understanding and explaining the text. It
consists of three intertwined phases: naïve reading, struc-
tural analysis and interpretation of the whole.14
Naïve reading and structural analysis. In the naïve reading,
the text is read through and an impression of the meaning
of the text is formed. In the structural analysis, the text is
divided into meaning units; those parts of the text that are
not relevant to the aim are considered, but are not included
in the analysis. The meaning units are abstracted and
formed into sub-themes. The sub-themes are formed into
themes and possibly a main theme. The whole process of
analysis is a dialectical movement between focusing on the
individual parts and the overall impression of the text. The
structural analysis is a validation of the naïve reading;
it may be in concordance with it, but it may also reveal
new aspects of what was initially formulated as a guess or
idea of what the text is about (i.e. naïve reading). Several
structural analyses may be performed to explore aspects of
the phenomena.14
Interpretation of the whole. In the final part of the analysis,
the pre-understanding, naïve reading and structural analysis
are taken into consideration when interpreting the overall
meaning of the text. To achieve a more profound under-
standing of the text, theoretical literature is consulted and
reflected upon simultaneously with the interpretation of
the text.14 For this study, gender theory was chosen and
the interpretation of the whole has, in this paper, been
combined with the discussion.
Findings
The first impression of the text was that, in patients
where a stress trigger had occurred, this trigger was not
experienced as traumatic or very stressful. Instead, the
interviewees reported being subjected to low intensity
stress for a long time before the onset of TS and they expe-
rienced this as more burdensome. All of the interviewees
described that the circumstances had been present for a
long time and most described situations dating back years
or even decades. Furthermore, the naïve reading revealed
that the interviewees worried a lot, both about practical
things and for the people around them. The interviewees
did not seem at peace with their situation in life or how
their life had turned out.
The structural analysis confirmed the first impressions
of the naïve reading that long-term stress was more bur-
densome for the interviewees than stress triggers. For this
reason, the structural analysis focused on the meaning of
living under long-term stressful circumstances and not an
eventual stress trigger. The analysis represents the body of
text as a whole and every one of the 19 interviews is repre-
sented in all of the themes.An overview of the main theme,
themes and sub-themes can be found in Table 2.
Worn down to the bone
The analysis revealed the presence of a stressful life situ-
ation long before the onset of TS. This situation was
characterized by feelings of injustice and powerlessness
to change the situation. The interviewees felt that there
was no possible way to act that could ease their burden.
Feelings of injustice regarding the situation and other peo-
ple's behaviour were present. Moreover, mistrust in other
peoples'ability to perform tasks and take responsibility led
to a constant state of readiness to help relieve other peo-
ples' worries and problems. Despite this, the interviewees
wanted to be able to trust other people, to relax and not be
constantly ready to act. Continual dwelling on the past, on
the unsatisfying situation and worrying about the future
rendered a barrier to living in the present. In addition, feel-
ings of inner stress, loneliness, not feeling part of a wider
context and a feeling of being misunderstood were present
at the same time as the interviewees built walls around
themselves and did not ask for help. The hopelessness
and lack of power over the situation wore down personal

resources. This was a prolonged process that slowly peeled
away individuals' resources until they balanced on the
verge of illness. These experiences were the result of a
combined burden and not tied to specific events: `Yes,
tired and weak as if I can't fight anymore' (patient 3).
Everlasting responsibilities.The interviewees felt a need to
protect, help and worry about others: `I probably worry a
lot and I should sort of protect our daughter' (patient 15).
Instead of burdening others with their own problems, the
interviewees chose to keep them to themselves. For exam-
ple, one interviewee did not tell their family about a long
period of illness. Moreover, a strong façade and always
being there for others was also important. Having lots of
responsibility was experienced as both a burden and enjoy-
able in the sense that it entailed appreciation from others,
which was desired. Busyness was a wanted burden because
it provided the satisfaction of being needed and asked
to help, but it was a burden when the influx of tasks and
responsibilities could not be controlled ­ for example, by
caring for a dependent family member. Furthermore, others
always asked for help with new tasks, such as painting,
cleaning or watching children: `And it fell on me to prepare
it. As it usually does. Partly I want to make the food and I
find it fun'(patient 2). Satisfaction was also found in being
proficient, with the concomitant assumption that everyone
else should be equally proficient and active. When people
were not, or were less concerned with details, the inter-
viewees found this irritating. Their activity made them feel
different from other people and not totally accepted. This,
together with the influx of eternal responsibilities, culmi-
nated in a sense of powerlessness.
Recurring injustice. Not having needs met led to feelings of
loneliness and abandonment. Furthermore, the interviewees
reported receiving less appreciation than they thought they
deserved, and feeling that when appreciation was given it
was too little, too late. Living in an unhealthy relationship
was one circumstance where needs were not meet. Inter-
viewees gave a lot of themselves and were disappointed
that others did not appreciate that they did not want to spend
all their time servicing others ­ for example, by helping
with choirs. To be hardworking and attentive was consid-
ered a virtue and this was expected from others. When
these standards were not lived up to, it was a disappoint-
ment to not get the same consideration in return. The inter-
viewees felt that others should notice their needs and that
their own responsibility in asking for and receiving help
and support was lost, which resulted in a sense of power-
lessness: `I expect it to be in order when I come to do
things because I always leave everything in order ... I
don't understand why I waste energy on it because I know
it won't be in order' (patient 17). To always be considerate
to others and not receive the same in return was seen as a
great injustice. Having to live with recurrent conflicts that
could not be avoided was one example. This frustration to
not be able to influence the situation led to feelings of
powerlessness, hopelessness and injustice: `No, he sold
everything online. I called the police ... I called the insur-
ance agency, nobody does anything' (patient 18). Remem-
brance of events in the past that had led to disappointment
resulted in feelings of sadness over how things turned out.
The interviewees had always worked hard and done the
right thing, but they were still not rewarded. They had
experienced a lack of control over these events and they
were stained by unjust treatment. The choice to keep things
active by dwelling on the past, which could not be accepted,
made it impossible to live in the present and find peace:
`Yes, I became so sad in a way that I hadn't done, taken
care of it before' (patient 7).
Perpetual uncertainty.This theme is characterized by a
sense of powerlessness over the situation, which was seen
as static and impossible to change. Endurance of the situa-
tion was a survival mechanism and a way of diminishing
the situation. The acceptance of the life situation and the
sense of powerlessness became an almost self-imposed
inability to change the life situation. The interviewees
often diminished the severity of their problems. One way
of maintaining a capacity of endurance was to try to turn
every situation into something positive, even though there
was nothing positive in the situation. One interviewee said
that a positive thing that came out of their daughter falling
ill was that they could help her. The diminishment of
problems and always trying to see the positive aspect of
situations were survival mechanisms to gain some control
over the situation and to facilitate endurance. Furthermore,
it was very important to be appropriate and keep up appear-
ances. Things should be done in the correct way and a
feeling of doing things a little better than other people was
apparent. Help was not asked for because the interviewees
did not want to complain or be bothersome. Moreover,
asking for help may have resulted in refusal, which was
feared: `I tinker a lot, it must be in a certain order, place
demands on myself. Actually perfect' (patient 13). An
inner insecurity or fear of being insufficient was almost
constantly present. This worrying was not directed towards
anything specific. Instead, some interviewees described it
as part of their personality. If one worrying thing was
resolved, it was immediately replaced by something new:
`I stress myself when it's something even though I don't
need to do it I do it internally and it's tiresome. Why do
you do that? I wish I could be calm' (patient 11).
Interpretation of the whole and
discussion
The analysis of the text showed that the interviewees lived
under stressful circumstances long before the onset of TS.
These stressful life circumstances were characterized by
526 European Journal of Cardiovascular Nursing 15(7)
experiences of everlasting demands and responsibilities,
being unjustly treated, not getting what they were entitled
to, and not being able to control or get out of the situation.
Long-term stress before the onset of TS has also been
found in previous studies. Kastaun et al.17 showed that
patients with TS had had more stressful life events, such as
abuse, severe injury or spousal loss, than both patients
with myocardial infarction and healthy controls. A higher
frequency of long-term stress ­ for example, recurrent
conflicts or a dependent family member ­ than patients
with myocardial infarction was also found by Delmas
et al.18 The findings in our study show that the same or
similar situations ­ unhealthy relationships, a dependent
family member or recurrent conflicts ­ led to long-term
stress that wore down the resources of the interviewees.
The presence of long-term stressful circumstances is in
agreement with a previous interview study.19 Our findings,
together with the previously reported studies, give a clear
indication that the patients' life situation was perceived as
stressful in agreement with the definition of Lazarus and
Folkman13 and should therefore create biological responses
to the taxing environment.12 Moreover, the connection
between long-term stress and heart disease, primarily car-
diovascular, is long established.11,20 Psychosocial stress,
such as described in this study, leads both to an increased
risk of myocardial infarction20 and a poorer prognosis after
an infarction.21 Long-term stress should be considered a
risk factor for TS.
To examine the sex discrepancy in the prevalence of TS
further and to gain an understanding of why the interview-
ees may be exposed to long-term stress, our findings were
analysed from a gender theory perspective. Gender theory
does not view disease as a passive unfolding of biology,
but instead tries to understand how culture and social
structures affect the biological body and therefore contrib-
ute to disease.22 The different life circumstances, such as
different amounts of long-term stress, of women and men
take their toll on the human body and, at least partly, deter-
mine what diseases people are affected by,23 which is in
line with the described definition of stress.12,13 For exam-
ple, although men have a shorter life expectancy, women
report more strain and psychological symptoms, such as
stress.9 The intrinsic power gradient in the gender structure
of society ­ in which women as a group have less power,
control and influence over their situation and life than men
as a group ­ is thought to be one reason that mental illness
is more prevalent in women than in men. This is a social
structure, which we are all co-creators of and which is not
the result of individual actions.22
To gain a more complete explanation of how inequality
is structured and reproduced in formally and judicially
equal societies, we can use love as an analytical tool.
According to Jónasdóttir,24 the dominating form of socio-
sexual relations is love power, generally given voluntarily
by women and exploited by men. Men gain access to the
resources, care and love of women without returning these
resources. This happens under stipulations that make
women incapable of building emotional reserves and
authoritative social powers. This is possible as a result of
the different stipulations for women and men. Women
need to love and be loved to be socio-existentially con-
firmed ­ that is, to become a person. However, women do
not fully control how and under which conditions they
may legitimately use their capacities. The consequence of
this exploitation is an exhaustion of capacities.24
The findings from this study are concordant with gen-
der theory22 and the theoretical writing of Jónasdóttir.24
Both the female and male interviewees adopted or were
assigned female roles, such as taking care of and worrying
about others, organizing and being responsible for their
home life. The findings showed that the interviewees gave
a lot of themselves and did not feel that they received the
same in return. They also needed to be busy, helpful and
not be cumbrous to feel confirmed and validated as per-
sons. Jónasdóttir24 writes that women need to love to be
confirmed; the interviewees needed to help and protect ­
that is, love ­ others to feel accepted. Moreover, the intrin-
sic power gradient in gender structure is evident in these
findings. The interviewees could not control the stipula-
tions of how and when they assisted others, which was
frustrating. The findings show that the interviewees did
not fully feel a part of society, which was also described by
Jónasdóttir.24 Furthermore, the interviewees felt trapped
and that they could not change their circumstances. These
circumstances slowly drained the interviewees of power
and resources and carved away their resilience. Living
under these circumstances wore the interviewees down to
the degree that they felt their capacity was exhausted and
the smallest stressor could tip them over the edge.
Further research is needed to investigate whether there
is a higher prevalence of stress among patients affected by
TS than among patients with other heart diseases or the
general population. This could be achieved by using ques-
tionnaires. A sense of coherence, depression and anxiety
are other aspects that may influence the perception of
stress and could therefore give further insights if they were
investigated.
According to Lincoln and Guba,25 the trustworthiness
of qualitative studies consists of four parts: credibility,
dependability, confirmability and transferability. One sin-
gle truth is not sought in phenomenological hermeneutics
because there is always more than one way of interpreting
the text.26 However, not all possible interpretations are
equally probable. The timing of the interviews in relation
to the onset of TS can be seen as a limitation. This could
have caused some recall bias, but because the primary
focus of the study was how the interviewees lived long
term before the onset of TS, this was not considered to be
a major drawback. Some of the narratives described events
that happened years or, in some cases, decades, before the
Wallström et al. 527
interview, so a couple of months of lag from the diagnosis
of TS to the interview probably did not greatly affect the
participants' memory. The analysis of the text was dis-
cussed by SW, KU, SM and IE until agreement was met to
guarantee as truthful and reproducible an interpretation as
possible. The first interview was conducted by IE and
the remaining by SW. IE has long experience of clinical
cardiac care, whereas SW has none. This was assumed to
offer a more unbiased interview process. Transferability is
always a delicate matter in qualitative studies.
A second limitation of the study was the sample size
compared with quantitative studies. Nineteen interviews
are considered to be a large sample for a qualitative study
and the great mass of text is an indicator of rich interviews.
In addition, only two men were included. Although more
men would have been desirable, the sex distribution of the
participants is in line of that of the disease.2 Given the rela-
tively large sample size, the large body of text and the
diversity in the age of the interviewees, the findings should
be transferable to other settings when the few narratives
from men are taken into account.
Conclusions and clinical implications
These findings indicate that stressful circumstances, such
as gender structures in society and the entailing social
roles, may cause vulnerability. This vulnerability, in turn,
contributes to an increased susceptibility to acute psycho-
logical or physical stressors, which triggers TS. This
study showed that long-term exposure to stress could be
an important predictor of why a minority of people are
affected by TS following an acute stressor.
In conclusion, this study indicates that prolonged per-
ceived psychosocial stress is a component in the onset
of TS. Prolonged psychosocial stress, enhanced by the
identities ascribed by society's gender structure, wears
down defences and creates vulnerability to an acute
stressor. The acute stressor is not the sole cause of TS, but
rather the `last straw that breaks the camel's back'.
Implications for Practice
·
· Long-term stress was present long before onset
of Takotsubo syndrome, which may have worn
down the defences of the interviewees and
caused a vulnerability to this syndrome.
·
· Gender structure and its division of labour
means that women and men are exposed to
different types of strains ­ for example, stress
­ which take their toll on the body.
·
· Health care professionals need to be aware
that the gender structure in society may influ-
ence health.
