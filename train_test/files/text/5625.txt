ABSTRACT
Glutamate excitotoxicity is a major pathogenic process
implicated in many neurodegenerative conditions, includ-
ing AD (Alzheimer's disease) and following traumatic brain
injury. Occurring predominantly from over-stimulation of
ionotropic glutamate receptors located along dendrites,
excitotoxic axonal degeneration may also occur in white
matter tracts. Recent identification of axonal glutamate
receptor subunits within axonal nanocomplexes raises the
possibility of direct excitotoxic effects on axons. Individual
neuronal responses to excitotoxicity are highly dependent
on the complement of glutamate receptors expressed by
the cell, and the localization of the functional receptors. To
enable isolation of distal axons and targeted excitotoxicity,
murine cortical neuron cultures were prepared in com-
partmented microfluidic devices, such that distal axons
were isolated from neuronal cell bodies. Within the com-
partmented culture system, cortical neurons developed to
relative maturity at 11 DIV (days in vitro) as demonstrated
by the formation of dendritic spines and clustering of
the presynaptic protein synaptophysin. The isolated distal
axons retained growth cone structures in the absence of
synaptic targets, and expressed glutamate receptor sub-
units. Glutamate treatment (100 mM) to the cell body cham-
ber resulted in widespread degeneration within this chamber
and degeneration of distal axons in the other cham-
ber. Glutamate application to the distal axon chamber
triggered a lesser degree of axonal degeneration without
degenerative changes in the untreated somal chamber. These
data indicate that in addition to current mechanisms of
indirect axonal excitotoxicity, the distal axon may be a
primary target for excitotoxicity in neurodegenerative
conditions.

INTRODUCTION
Glutamate excitotoxicity has been implicated as a major
pathogenic process in many neurodegenerative conditions,
including AD (Alzheimer's disease), motor-neuron disease and
following traumatic brain injury (Arundine and Tymianski,
2004; Hynd et al., 2004). Excitotoxicity occurs by over-
stimulation of excitatory amino acid receptors, resulting in
calcium influx and consequential pathological changes
triggering neuronal loss (Carriedo et al., 1996; Doble 1996;
Van Den Bosch et al., 2000). The response of an individual
neuron to excitotoxicity is dependent on a number of factors,
including the intensity and duration of the excitatory in-
sult, and the profile of excitatory receptors or downstream
signalling molecules expressed by the cell (Arundine and
Tymianski, 2003). Pathologically, excitotoxicity can result in
apoptotic cell death that may be preceded by dendritic beading.
Excitotoxicity has also been implicated in axon degeneration,
and in cultured cortical neurons degeneration is preceded by
neurofilament loss (Chung et al., 2005). Furthermore, excito-
toxicity has been shown to result in a distal axonopathy in
retinal ganglion cells (Saggu et al., 2008) and cultured motor
neurons (King et al., 2007). It is currently unknown as to how
excitotoxicity results in axonal degeneration.
Neuronal glutamate receptors, the mediators of excito-
toxicity, are found on postsynaptic densities where they are
involved in synaptic transmission. However, immunohisto-
chemical techniques have demonstrated the presence of
glutamate receptors at numerous extrasynaptic sites includ-
ing the soma, dendrites and spines (reviewed in Newpher and
Ehlers, 2008) and presynaptically (Tovar and Westbrook,
2002). Importantly, electrophysiological techniques have also
indicated that these receptors can be functional (Andrasfalvy
and Magee, 2001; Bardoni et al., 2004). Dendritic extrasynaptic
receptors, and specifically NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate)

receptors, have been particularly implicated in excitotoxicity
(Sattler et al., 2000). Current evidence supports the notion that
synaptic receptor activation promotes neuroprotection
through activation of survival genes and suppression of
apoptotic genes, whereas extrasynaptic stimulation promotes
cell death (Hardingham et al., 2002), although this may be due
to differences in receptor subunits (Liu et al., 2007). Thus, the
distribution of synaptic and extrasynaptic NMDA receptors,
rather than total calcium load, influence neuronal suscepti-
bility and responses to excitotoxicity (reviewed in Hardingham
and Bading, 2010).
Although excitotoxicity is considered primarily a neuronal
somatodendritic insult, glutamate toxicity has also been
demonstrated to occur in white matter tracts lacking
neuronal cell bodies. This type of toxicity, often associated
with brain injury, ischaemia and glaucoma (Stys and Li, 2000;
Saggu et al., 2008), has been attributed to glial cells known to
express functional glutamate receptors (Micu et al., 2006;
Matute, 2007). Oligodendrocytes are directly vulnerable to
AMPA (a-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methylisoxazole-4-propionic
acid) mediated Ca2+ excitotoxicity resulting in demyelination
and secondary axonal pathology (Yoshioka et al., 1995;
Bannerman et al., 2007). However, the recent identification
of axonal glutamate receptor subunits within axonal inter-
nodal nanocomplexes, raises the possibility of direct axonal
excitotoxicity (Ouardouz et al., 2009a, 2009b). The functional
status of these receptors remains disputed; they may be
involved in local regulatory mechanisms within the internodal
nanocomplexes they reside in.
Investigation of the expression of glutamate receptors in
different neuronal compartments and their role in excito-
toxicity is difficult under standard culture conditions due to
the inability to specifically target excitatory agonists. Simi-
larly, in vivo investigations are complicated by the presence
of glial cells. To overcome this, we have utilized microfluidic
devices (Taylor et al., 2005) to establish compartmented
embryonic cortical neuron cultures. Such devices allow fluidic
isolation of distal axons from cell bodies, thus allowing focal
exposure of the axon or soma to excitotoxins. In this study,
we have examined the maturation of primary mouse cortical
neurons within a microfluidic device, in addition to immuno-
cytochemical and Western blot analysis of the expression
of glutamate receptor subunits in both the somal and dis-
tal axon compartments. To determine if excitotoxin-induced
axon degeneration can result from somal or axonal exposure
to excitotoxin, we also examined the effect of a chronic
(24 and 72 h) exposure of glutamate to either the somal or
axonal chamber.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
All animals experiments used were reviewed and approved by
the Animal Ethics Committee of the University of Tasmania.
Primary cell culture
Primary cortical neurons were dissected from the superficial
layers of cerebral cortex of gestational day 14 embryos,
obtained from pregnant C57Bl/6 mice and prepared as
previously described (Dickson et al., 2000; King et al., 2006).
Cells were dissociated in `initial' plating medium: Neurobasal
medium (Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), 2% B27 supplement
(Gibco BRL, Life Technologies), 10% foetal bovine serum,
0.5 mM glutamine, 25 mM glutamate and penicillin/strep-
tomycin. Cell density and viability was assessed using a Trypan
Blue dye exclusion assay, and the volume adjusted to achieve a
density of 86106 cells/ml. Neurons were plated into prepared
microfluidic devices (450 nm barrier grooves, Xona
Microfluidics, Figure 1A) as outlined below. In contrast to
Campenot compartmented chambers utilizing Teflon divisions
and scratched substrate to guide axonal growth, microfluidic
devices are fabricated from PDMS using a photoresist template
to create microchannels for axonal growth between compart-
ments (Taylor et al., 2005). Devices were attached to 22 cm2
glass coverslips (Livingstone), coated with 0.001% poly-L-lysine
and incubated overnight. Microfluidics were rinsed with initial
plating medium, which was removed immediately prior to
addition of cells into the somal chamber. Plated neurons were
incubated for 10 min to facilitate adhesion, followed by
addition of initial plating medium. Cultures were incubated
under standard conditions (37°C, 5% CO2
), with the medium
changed to 'subsequent' growth medium (Neurobasal medium,
2% B27 supplement, 0.5 mM glutamine and penicillin/
streptomycin), at 1 and 7 DIV (days in vitro).
Labelling of live cells in microfluidic chambers
Not all neurons extended axons through to the distal
chamber, therefore, to identify neuronal soma with isolated
distal axons, the lipophilic membrane stain CM-DiI (1 mg/ml,
Molecular Probes) was added to the distal axon chamber.
Microfluidic isolation between the treated and untreated
sides was achieved by maintaining a lower fluid volume on
the treated side (Taylor et al., 2005). Microfluidic devices were
incubated for 4 h under standard growth conditions,
followed by media change. Subsequent experimentation
was performed the next day, as required.
In some experiments, neurons were transfected with a
plasmid expressing GFP (green fluorescent protein; pmax GFP,
Lonza) to allow morphological analysis of neuronal pro-
cesses. Briefly, 800 ng plasmid DNA was applied to the somal
chamber using the LipofectamineTM 2000 reagent (Invi-
trogen) for 6 h, under standard growth conditions, according
to the manufacturer's instructions. This was followed by
complete media change. Transfected neurons were visualized
by fluorescence microscopy after 24 h.
Excitotoxicity
Excitotoxicity was initiated in mature (11 DIV) compart-
mented cultures (n55 repeats) by a single application of

100 mM glutamate in culture medium (Chung et al., 2005) to
either the distal axon or somal chamber of the microfluidic
device for 24 h (Figure 1B). Microfluidic isolation was
performed as above. Additional cultures were treated with
100 mM glutamate for 72 h to the axonal chamber, beginning
at 10 DIV. Treated cultures were maintained under standard
growth conditions for 24 or 72 h, followed by fixation.
Inhibition of caspase activity
The pan-caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK (R&D Systems) was
added to either the distal axon or somal chambers to inactivate
caspase activity. Cultures were pre-incubated in 10 mM Z-VAD-
FMK in culture medium for 2 h and excitotoxicity induced as
described above.
Cell fixation and immunocytochemical labelling
Cortical neuron cultures were fixed with 4% PFA (para-
formaldehyde) for 30 min at room temperature, then
permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 for 2­5 min. For NR1
(NMDA receptor subunit 1) visualization, coverslips were fixed
in ice-cold methanol for 10 min at 220°C, omitting
permeabilization (note: AMPA receptor immunoreactivity
was not affected by the method of fixation). This was
followed by incubation with primary antibodies diluted in
PBS, for 1 h at room temperature followed by 4°C overnight.
Antibodies used in this study include those directed to GluR1
(1:100 Chemicon), GluR4 (1:500 Chemicon), MAP2 (micro-
tubule-associated protein-2; 1:1000 Millipore), NF-M (1:1000
Serotec), NR1 (1:10,000 BD Pharmingen), synaptophysin
(1:200 Millipore). All antibodies are commercially available
and optimum concentrations were individually determined
for each antibody. Species and isotype appropriate fluor-
escent AlexaFluor secondary antibodies (1:1000, Molecular
Probes) were applied for 2 h at room temperature. The
filamentous actin dye, phalloidin (1:200, AlexaFluor 488,
Molecular Probes), was applied for 30 min during the
secondary antibody incubation. All antibodies have been
used in our previous studies (King et al., 2006, 2011). No cross
reactivity for the primary antibody's isotype or secondary anti-
body non-specific binding have been observed. Following
antibody labelling, coverslips were stained with Nuclear Yellow
(0.0001%, Sigma) to identify nuclei.
Western blot
For Western blot analysis, the somal or distal axon chambers
were harvested from 10 microfluidic devices (n52 repeats) in
ice-cold Tris­Trion buffer (10 mM Tris, pH 7.4; 100 mM NaCl;
1 mM EDTA; 1 mM EGTA; 1% Triton X-100; 10% glycerol;
0.1% SDS and 0.5% deoxycholate) supplemented with
CompleteTM (protease inhibitor cocktail, Roche). Samples
were separated by SDS/12.5% PAGE. Coomassie Brilliant Blue
staining was also performed on a gel from each experiment.
Protein gels were transferred to a PVDF membrane.
Membranes were blocked overnight in 5% non-fat dried
skimmed milk powder, followed by an overnight incubation in
primary antibodies, including a combination of GluR1 (1:200,
Chemicon), GluR2 (1:500, Chemicon), GluR3 (1:500,
Chemicon) and GluR4 (1:500, Chemicon) for AMPA receptors
and NR1 (1:1000, BD Pharmingen) for NMDA receptors.
Membranes were washed in TBS-Tween. Species appropriate
HRP (horseradish-peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibod-
ies (1:1000, Dako) were applied and visualized with
chemilluminescent peroxidase substrate (Sigma).

Quantification of axon degeneration
Treated cultures were immunolabelled for neurofilaments and
images for analysis were obtained using a Leica (DM LB2)
fluorescence microscope fitted with a cooled CCD camera
(Magnafire Optronics). Image acquisition and subsequent
analysis was performed blinded to experimental conditions.
Four 6400 images were randomly captured from each distal
axon chamber. A 465 50 mm2 grid (Figure 1C) was super-
imposed on each image using Adobe Photoshop (CS5). Axons
in each square of the grid were scored as either whole,
beaded (distinguishable swellings connected by sections of
axon) or fragmented (disconnected swellings) (Figure 1D).
Overall degeneration was calculated as the sum of beaded
and fragmented axons. Values were expressed as a percentage
of total axons. Total values from each square were averaged
for each coverslip and analysed using Student's t-test. P-
values ,0.05 were considered significant. A minimum of five
separate culture repeats were analysed. Data are represented
as means¡SEM.
RESULTS
Developmental characteristics of
compartmented cortical neuronal culture
Mouse cortical neuron cultures were established within
compartmented microfluidic culture devices (Taylor et al.,
2005) and their growth characteristics were examined over a
time course (Figures 2A­2E). Initial neuronal development (1­
3 DIV) was restricted to the somal chamber (Figure 2A). By 5
DIV, the neurons had extended multiple neurites within the
somal chamber (Figure 2C) and axons were present within the
microchannels (Figure 2D). At 7 DIV long, relatively
unbranched axons were present extending from the micro-
channels into the distal axon chamber, forming an exten-
sively branched network at 11 DIV (Figure 2F). Isolated axonal
health declined from 14 DIV, with extensive distal axon
degeneration present at 15 DIV (Figure 2H). Degeneration of
axons within the distal axon chamber from 15 DIV was not
accompanied by degeneration within the somal chamber
(Figure 2G).
Double immunolabelling verified that axons (NF-M
immunoreactivity) were present in the distal axon chamber,
with neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (MAP2 immuno-
reactivity) restricted to the somal chamber (Figure 2I), as
previously described by Taylor et al. (2005). NF-M immunor-
eactive axons were also present in the somal chamber.
Neurons with axons extending into the distal chamber were
identified by incubating the distal axon chamber with CM-DiI
prior to treatment. CM-DiI was taken up by the axons and
transported to the cell body (Perlson et al., 2009) (Figure 2J).
DiI retrograde labelling from the distal axon chamber
indicated that approximately 30% of neurons extended
axons to the distal chamber.
Neuronal maturity in compartmented cultures was deter-
mined by examining the presence of growth cones, synapses
and spines. Previous investigations have demonstrated that
under standard conditions, immature neurons prior to the
development of synapses have numerous growth cones (Haas
et al., 2004). As neurons mature, punctate synapses and
mushroom-shaped spines are formed on the dendrites
accompanied by the loss of growth cones (King et al.,
2006). In the current study, the presence of growth cones in
compartmented cultures was examined by phalloidin staining
for filamentous actin and synaptic puncta were visualized by
immunolabelling with the presynaptic marker synaptophysin
in addition to the dendritic marker MAP2. Dendritic spine
morphology was determined by examination of neurons
transiently transfected with a GFP expression construct. In
the somal chamber at 11 DIV, few growth cones were present
and synaptophysin positive puncta were immunolabelled
along MAP2 immunopositive dendrites (Figure 3A), with the
number and density of puncta varying between cells,
congruent with previous investigations (King et al., 2006).
Furthermore, GFP expression revealed short, mushroom-
shaped spines (Figure 3B) on the dendrites in addition to a
number of long filopodial spines (Figure 3C). These data
indicate that, in the somal chamber, synapses were present in
accordance with neuronal maturity in standard cultures (King
et al., 2006). However, in the distal axonal chamber at this
developmental stage, large growth cones were present at
the ends of axons (Figure 3D), indicating a stage of im-
maturity not usually seen in standard cultures at this time
point in vitro.
Glutamate receptor expression in
compartmented cultures
To examine whether components of the machinery required
for functional glutamatergic signalling, and therefore
excitotoxicity, were present, the expression of glutamate
receptor subunits was determined. Expression of both NMDA
and AMPA receptors was examined within the somal and
distal axon chambers of mature (11 DIV) cultures by immu-
nocytochemistry using glutamate subunit specific antibodies.
The expression profiles of the receptors varied between
neurons within each culture. Within the somal chamber, im-
munoreactivity for AMPA (GluR1) and NMDA (NR1) receptor
subunits was present throughout the soma, with punctate
expression along the dendrites (Figures 4A and 4B). Within
the distal chamber, AMPA subunit labelling (GluR4) was
frequently present and punctate along distal axons and
within the growth cone (Figure 4C). Immunoreactivity for
NMDA receptors was occasionally present within distal axon
growth cones (Figure 4D).
To confirm the presence of glutamate receptor subunits
in the somal and distal axon chambers, protein was harvested

from each chamber and glutamate receptor subunit express-
ion determined by Western blot analysis. Coomassie staining
of SDS/PAGE gels demonstrated a good yield of protein from
both chambers (Figure 4E). Western blots confirmed the
presence of NMDA (NR1 labelling at 120 kDa) and AMPA
(GluR1 GluR2, GluR3 and GluR4 labelling at 100 kDa)
receptors in the somal chambers (Figure 4F). Interestingly,
Western blot analysis also demonstrated the presence of
AMPA receptors in protein harvested from the distal axon
chamber (Figure 4F). NMDA receptors, however, were not
detected in the distal axon chamber (Figure 4F). Together,
these data indicate differential expression of glutamate
receptors subunits on both the somatodendritic compart-
ment and distal axon of the cortical neuron, with strong
evidence for the presence of AMPA receptor subunits in the
axon.
Functional contribution of expressed glutamate
receptors to focal excitotoxicity
To determine the role of the axon in mediating excitotoxi-
city, mature (11 DIV) mouse cortical neurons were treated
with 100 mM glutamic acid or vehicle control, applied to
either the somal or the distal axon chamber of the
microfluidic device, and maintained for 24 h post-treat-
ment. Following treatment, distal axon degeneration was
assessed based on neurofilament immunoreactivity for
axonal integrity.
Figure 2 Neuronal growth in compartmented culture
Initial neuronal growth in compartmented culture (2 DIV) (A) is restricted to the somal chamber with axons extending into the distal cham-
ber to form a branched network at 11 DIV (B). At 5 DIV neuronal growth is characterized by branched neurites within the
somal chamber (C) and neurites visible within the microchannels (arrow) (D). At 11 DIV neurites within somal chamber (E)
were densely branched, and axons within the distal axon chamber (F) had formed extensive branched networks. Neurons
retained normal healthy morphology within the somal chamber at 15 DIV (G) despite severe deterioration of isolated axons
(H). Immunolabelling of 11 DIV neurons (I) demonstrates cell bodies (MAP2, green) restricted to the somal chamber and
axons (NF-M, red) present within the somal chamber and extending to the distal axon chamber. Neurons (Nuclear Yellow,
blue) with isolated axons were identified by CM-DiI (red) retrograde labelling from the distal axon chamber (J). Arrowhead

Glutamate applied to the somal chamber resulted in
extensive neuronal degeneration, both within the treated
chamber and at the unexposed distal axon. Specifically, axons
in both chambers frequently showed a beaded morphology
and additionally complete axon fragmentation was present in
some axons. Quantitative analysis of neurofilament immuno-
reactivity in the untreated distal axon chamber demonstrated
that somal glutamate treatment resulted in a significant
(P,0.01) 3-fold increase in total axon degeneration,
including the sum of both beaded and fragmented axons
(80.5%¡2.9). Beading (32.2%¡2.4) and fragmentation
(49.5%¡3.3) were significantly (P,0.01) increased relative
to untreated controls (26.9%¡2.8 total damage; 13.5%¡1.7
beading; 14.3%¡1.5 fragmentation) (Figure 5A). Widespread
axonal degeneration was also present in the treated somal
chamber (not quantified) (Chung et al., 2005).
We next determined if specific targeting of excitotoxicity
to the distal axon chamber could also result in degenerative
changes. Twenty-four hour glutamate exposure also resulted
in beading and fragmentation of the distal axon. Quantitative
analysis of neurofilament immunoreactivity demonstrated a
significant (P,0.01) 1.5-fold increase in total degeneration
(46.7%¡3.2), axonal beading (21.3%¡1.0) and axonal
fragmentation (25.5%¡2.3) when compared with untreated
controls (26.9%¡2.8, total damage; 13.5%¡1.7 beading;
14.3%¡1.5 fragmentation) (Figure 5A). The degenerative
changes in distally treated cultures was significantly (P,0.01)
1.5-fold less than the distal degeneration recorded from
somal treatment, assessed as both axonal beading and
fragmentation.
The neuron-wide effects of somal and axonal excitotoxin
exposure were examined to determine the extent of neuronal
damage. In addition to distal axon morphology (neurofila-
ment immunoreactivity) (Figures 5B­5D), we examined
changes to dendrites (MAP2 immunoreactivity) (Figures 5E­
5G) and overall cell health, using Nuclear Yellow to assess
nuclear integrity (Figures 5H­5J). Somal excitotoxicity
resulted in severe dendritic beading at 24 h post-treatment
(Figure 5E), as has been described previously (Park et al.,
1996). There was a significant (20%¡3.2, P,0.01) increase in
apoptotic (condensed) nuclei following somatodendritic
excitotoxicity (Figure 5I). In contrast with somal exposure,
the unexposed somal chambers of distally treated cultures
had no change to dendritic morphology relative to controls
(Figure 5G). The nuclear morphology of CM-DiI-stained
neurons was assessed; however, there was no difference in
the percentage of apoptotic nuclei between axonal excitotoxicity
at 24 h and untreated controls (25.4%¡2.0 24 h excitotoxi-
city; 22.7%¡1.3 control).
To investigate whether delayed apoptosis occurred,
through dying-back from the axon, cultures were treated
with 100 mM glutamate to the distal axon chamber for 72 h
at 10 DIV and axon degeneration and cell death assessed.
Seventy two hour-treated cultures demonstrated a significant
(P,0.01) increase in total axon degeneration from untreated
controls (52.5%¡4.3 and 32.5%¡2.6, respectively); however
this was not significantly (P.0.05) different to cultures treat-
ed for 24 h (46.7%¡3.2) (Figure 6A). Additional cultures were
labelled with CM-DiI to the distal axon chamber prior to
treatment to specifically label neuronal soma with axons in the

distal chamber. Following treatment, the nuclear morphology
of DiI positive soma was assessed with no significant (P.0.05)
change to the percentage of apoptotic nuclei relative to
controls (13.9%¡1.9 72 h glutamate, 17.8%¡1.4 controls)
(Figure 6B).
Mechanisms of focal excitotoxin-induced axonal
degeneration
To investigate whether axon degeneration following soma or
axonal excitotoxicity involved activation of caspases and
apoptotic pathways, 11 DIV cultures were pre-incubated with
10 mM Z-VAD-FMK pan caspase inhibitor to either the somal
or distal axon chambers. Cultures were subsequently treated
with 100 mM glutamate for 24 h to induce excitotoxicity in
the two compartments. The efficacy of the inhibitor was
confirmed by a significant (P,0.05) decrease in apoptotic
nuclei following somal excitotoxicity when compared with no
inhibitor (16.06%¡3.93 glutamate only; 3.93%¡3.15 inhi-
bition+glutamate).
Figure 5 Axon degeneration following excitotoxicity
Somatodendritic excitotoxicity resulted in a significant (P,0.01) 3-fold
increase in distal axon degeneration (A). Distal axonal excitotoxicity resulted
in a significant (P,0.01) 1.5-fold increase in distal axon degeneration (A).
Immunocytochemical analysis of control and treated cultures (B­J). Distal
axons demonstrated increased beading and fragmentation between control
(B), somal-treated (C) and distal axon-treated (D) cultures, visualized with
NF-M immunoreactivity. Arrows indicate whole axons, arrowheads indicate
fragmented and beaded axons. Within the somal chamber, MAP2
immunoreactive dendrites demonstrated increased beading between control
(E) and somal-treated (F) cultures. Distal axon-treated cultures (G) did not
demonstrate changes to dendritic morphology. Arrows indicate soma,
arrowheads indicate dendrites. Similarly, nuclear health (Nuclear Yellow)

significantly (P,0.01) decreased distal axon degeneration
(31.3%¡3.2) when compared with somal treatment alone
(54.5%¡2.3) (Figure 7A). Axonal caspase inhibition com-
bined with somal excitotoxicity also significantly (P,0.01)
reduced axon degeneration (36.4%¡2.1) (Figure 7A). Somal
caspase inhibition and axonal caspase inhibition similarly
significantly (P,0.01) decreased axon degeneration in
conjunction with axonal excitotoxicity (2.5%¡4.0 and
9.9%¡2.4, respectively) compared with axonal excitotoxicity
alone (20.6%¡3.2) (Figure 7B). For both axonal and somal
excitotoxicity, there was no significant (P.0.05) difference
between somal and axonal application of caspase inhibition.
DISCUSSION
In this study, we have grown primary cortical neurons in a
compartmentalized microfluidic device to determine the
expression of glutamate receptors in specific neuronal
compartments and to investigate degenerative responses
following chronic targeted distal axon excitotoxicity. Of
relevance to the current study, our previous investigations
(King et al., 2006), and those of others (Choi et al., 1987; Liu
et al., 1996) have demonstrated that neuronal vulnerability
to excitotoxicity is dependent on neuronal maturity and
expression of glutamate receptor subunits, which is variable
between cell types. Thus, for the current study it was im-
portant to determine the maturity of neurons within the
microfluidic culture chambers.
Under standard growth conditions, development of pri-
mary murine cortical neurons occurs via a sequence of
predetermined steps that include neurite outgrowth, polar-
ization and elongation followed by movement of glutamate
receptors into the synapses and loss of immaturity markers
such as growth cones (Dotti et al., 1988, Haas et al., 2004).
The timing of these developmental stages is dependent on
culture density (de Lima et al., 1997; Rao et al., 1998).
Assessment of neuronal growth of cultures in microfluidic
chambers indicates that development occurs in a similar
manner to standard cortical culture within the somal
chamber, including the presence of mature spines and
punctate glutamate receptor subunits at 11 DIV. However,
in the axonal chamber, even at relative culture maturity (11
DIV), numerous axonal growth cones remained present. The
presence of growth cones is likely to be due to the inability of
presynaptic neurons to find postsynaptic partners in this

Application of glutamate to the distal axon compartment for 72 h
significantly (P,0.01) increased percentage axon degeneration from
untreated controls, however, it did not significantly (P.0.05) alter the
percentage of axon degeneration from 24 h treated cultures (A). Application
of glutamate to the distal axon chamber for 72 h did not significantly
(P.0.05) alter the percentage of apoptotic nuclei between untreated, 24 h
and 72 h treated cultures (B).

culture system and may affect the axonal expression of
glutamate receptor subunits.
Our data indicate that, in addition to the well-documented
expression of glutamate receptor subunits on the somato-
dendritic compartment of cultured primary cortical neurons
(King et al., 2006), glutamate receptors, and in particular
AMPA receptors, were also present on axons. Excitotoxic
stimulation of axonal glutamate receptors resulted in axonal
degeneration, which, unlike somatodendritic exposure, was
confined to the exposed segment of the axon and did not
cause retrograde degeneration or apoptotic cell death, even
at extended time-points of 72 h. These data also suggest the
presence of functional glutamate receptor complexes on
the axons in this chamber.
Axon degeneration and excitotoxicity
Axon degeneration following glutamate receptor stimulation
has been previously reported in a number of studies. In vitro
studies have indicated that axon degeneration occurs as a
result of chronic excitotoxicity in cultured motor (King et al.,
2007) and cortical (Chung et al., 2005) neurons. In these
studies, however, glutamate or other agonists were globally
applied to the cells and so it is unclear if axon degeneration
occurred from toxicity to somatodendritic glutamate recep-
tors, or receptors present on axons, growth cones or
presynaptic terminals. In vivo studies have allowed focal
excitotoxin exposure of neuronal compartments. Somal
glutamate exposure to retinal ganglion cells resulted in a
degeneration of the distal axon (Saggu et al., 2008),
confirming excitotoxic axonal degeneration in the unexposed
axon segment, consistent with the current study in cortical
neurons. In vivo glutamate exposure to myelinated axons also
resulted in axonal damage to the optic nerve (Matute, 1998)
and external capsule (Fowler et al., 2003). The vulnerability of
myelinating oligodendrocytes to excitotoxicity has been well
documented and myelin has been demonstrated to play a role
in axonal excitotoxicity (Fowler et al., 2006). However, studies
using myelin-deficient Shiverer mice show that compact
myelin is not required for AMPA toxicity to axons (Pitt et al.,
2010).
A study by Underhill and Goldberg (2007) utilized a
Campenot style compartmentalized culture system to directly
examine the role of glutamate receptor activation in axon
degeneration in the absence of glial cells. Their data
demonstrated that brief (2 h) axonal exposure to glutamate
receptor agonists, NMDA or AMPA, did not result in sig-
nificant axonal degeneration. Conversely, the current study
using a compartmentalized microfluidic culture system,
demonstrates the novel finding that chronic (24 h) glutamate
exposure results in axonal blebbing and fragmentation in a
proportion of axons. The reasons for these conflicting results
may be the length of time of the exposure, the agonists used
or differences in the culture systems, which may select for
isolation of axons from specific cell types. Interestingly, in
vivo studies also suggest difference in chronic versus acute
excitotoxic axonal exposure (Matute, 1998). These data
suggest that excitotoxicity can be mediated through
glutamate receptors expressed on the axon.
Excitotoxicity and glutamate receptor expression
In the current study excitotoxicity could be mediated through
glutamate receptors expressed either on the axon shaft or on
the growth cones. Glutamate receptors can be trafficked to the
axonal compartment and in particular their presence within
growth cones during neuronal development has been well
documented (King et al., 2006), with a proposed involvement
in pathfinding (Zheng et al., 1996). Recently, subunits for
AMPA and kainate receptors have been shown to be present on
myelinated axons (Ouardouz et al., 2009a, 2009b), although
the functional activity of these receptors is currently disputed.
Our data confirm the presence of AMPA receptors in the
axonal compartment of cultured axons by immunocytochemi-
cal labelling and Western blot analysis. The role of these axonal
glutamate receptors is unclear; however, the expression of
functional NMDA and non-NMDA receptors on glial cells (Gallo
and Russell, 1995; Verkhratsky and Kirchhoff, 2007) raises the
possibility that axonal glutamate receptor subunits may
facilitate glutamatergic signalling between axons and myeli-
nating oligodendrocytes or astrocytes.
A limitation of the current study is that cultured distal
axons were unable to synapse on other neurons, prevent-
ing the formation of the presynaptic terminal. This excludes
the possibility that excitotoxicity was mediated through
presynaptic receptors. In vivo, both NMDA and AMPA
receptors are found presynaptically, where they are thought
to regulate glutamate release (recently reviewed in Pinheiro
and Mulle, 2008) and could potentially be targets for
excitotoxic stimulation. Although the expression pattern of
axonal glutamate receptors may differ in vivo, the current
study suggests that excitotoxicity can be mediated through
extrasynaptic glutamate receptors expressed on the axon.
The demonstration of the extrasynaptic expression of
glutamate receptor subtypes (Passafaro et al., 2001; Tovar
and Westbrook, 2002; Kane-Jackson and Smith, 2003; van
Zundert et al., 2004) suggests a wider role for glutamate than
solely as an inter-neuronal excitatory transmitter (Araque
and Perea, 2004). Glutamate receptor subunits at non-
synaptic sites on dendrites and spines are thought to act as a
reserve supply of synaptic receptors (for recent review see
Newpher and Ehlers 2008). However, electrophysiological
recordings indicate that these extrasynaptic receptors are
functional (Andrasfalvy and Magee, 2001) and a modulatory
role has been suggested, through activation by glutamate
spillover from the synapse or glial derived glutamate (Dia-
mond and Jahr, 2000; Jourdain et al., 2007). In terms of
pathological stimulation of glutamate receptors, extrasynap-
tic and synaptic receptors have been reported to play a
significantly different role in excitotoxicity. Stimulation of
synaptic NMDA receptors is neuroprotective, whereas activa-
tion of extrasynaptic NMDA receptors triggers neuronal

degeneration (Hardingham et al., 2002), although some
authors demonstrate that preferential expression of receptor
subunit types at extrasynaptic sites is responsible for this
effect rather than localization itself (Liu et al., 2007).
Mechanisms of axonal glutamate excitotoxicity
and implications for disease
Mechanism of axonal degeneration, including potential
differences between axonal and somal glutamate stimulation,
cannot be fully determined in the current study; however, the
protective effect of a pan-caspase inhibitor suggests the in-
volvement of pathways associated with apoptosis. It is of parti-
cular interest to note that application of inhibitors to either the
soma or axon provided protection from degeneration. The role
of axonal caspases in axonal degeneration is being increasingly
recognized and has been reported in a number of models
(Schoenmann et al., 2010, Smith et al., 2011). The study also
suggests that retrograde signalling to the soma is involved in
axon degeneration following axonal excitotoxicity, without
inducing frank apoptosis. Further elucidating the mechanisms
of excitotoxin-induced axon degeneration will be the subject of
future studies using this model.
The findings of the current study have a number of
implications for our understanding of neurodegenerative
disease. Excitotoxicity within the white matter has been
shown to occur in a number of degenerative conditions
including glaucoma (Saggu et al., 2008) and multiple sclerosis
(Pitt et al., 2003), and is also common following injury
(reviewed in Lau and Tymianski, 2010). Furthermore, axonal
excitotoxicity may be involved in any condition involving exci-
totoxic pathogenesis including, potentially, ALS (amyotrophic
lateral sclerosis) (van Damme et al., 2005) and AD (Hynd et al.,
2004), with local regions of excitotoxicity triggering axon
degeneration and synaptic loss. At present, excitotoxic damage
is attributed to neuronal soma and glial cells, and secondary
axon degeneration via axon­glia signalling. The current study
suggests that axon degeneration could occur from direct
exposure of the axon to excitotoxins. However, axonal
excitotoxicty did not result in a dying back, even 72 h
following exposure. The relative immaturity of the axons
through lack of presynaptic targets and therefore retrograde
signals from postsynaptic cells may be a factor in the lack of
die back in this study. It is currently unknown as to how
axonally mediated excitotoxicity affects a cell's survival in
mature cells in vivo in the long-term. However, this may have
therapeutic implications as intervention may need to be
directed specifically to induce axon protection.
