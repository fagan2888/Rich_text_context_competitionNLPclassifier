754 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 23, NUMBER 6, JUNE 2000
Considerable attention has been gar-
nered by the concept that health care
access and utilization are major deter-
minants of health outcomes for patients
with diabetes. For example, the Diabetes
Quality Improvement Project was created
in 1998 because of the perception that dia-
betes care in America is suboptimal and
that patients with diabetes are not receiving
care thought to be beneficial (1). This
major project, sponsored by many organi-
zations involved with diabetes, is designed
to increase the level of care provided to
patients with diabetes and to improve the
accountability of health care systems.
Health outcomes for patients with
diabetes do appear to be suboptimal, in
that blindness, renal failure, lower-extrem-
ity amputations, ischemic heart disease,
and stroke are common in these patients
(2). However, these end-stage complica-
tions result only after a long duration of
diabetes and thus, are occurring in patients
who were diagnosed and received much
of their medical care many years ago.
The current contribution of health care
access and medical care to the develop-
ment of adverse health outcomes in dia-
betes versus the contributions of patient
self-care practices, provider care prac-
tices, and inherent biological factors
remains to be determined.
Certain data indicate that health care
access may not be a major determinant of
the health status of patients with type 2
diabetes. In a representative group of U.S.
patients, there was no relationship of
glycemic control to having health insur-
ance or number of physician visits per year
(3). In the U.K. Prospective Diabetes Study
(UKPDS), only a small difference in mean
HbA
1c
was achieved between the group of
patients who were intensively treated com-
pared with the group less intensively
treated (4). Physician specialty, particu-
larly whether the physician is an endocri-
nologist, was reported to have little impact
on quality of care, as measured by
glycemic control, blood pressure control,
or microalbuminuria (5).
To investigate the current relationship
between medical care and health status
and outcomes, we analyzed questionnaire,
clinical, and laboratory data for a repre-
sentative sample of patients with type 2
diabetes in phase 2 of the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III). The health outcomes stud-
ied were those that would be expected to
be influenced by recent medical care, such
as hyperglycemia, albuminuria, hyperten-
sion, and dyslipidemia.

Health Care and Health Status and
Outcomes for Patients With Type 2
Diabetes
O R I G I N A L A R T I C L E
OBJECTIVE -- To evaluate access and utilization of medical care, and health status and out-
comes that would be influenced by recent medical care, in a representative sample of patients
with type 2 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A national sample of 733 adults with type 2
diabetes was studied from 1991 to 1994 in the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey. Structured questionnaires and clinical and laboratory assessments were used to
determine the frequencies of physician visits, health insurance coverage, screening for diabetes
complications, treatment for hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia; and the propor-
tion of patients who met treatment goals and established criteria for health outcome measures
including hyperglycemia, albuminuria, obesity, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
RESULTS -- Almost all patients had 1 source of primary care (95%), 2 or more physician vis-
its during the past year (88%), and health insurance coverage (91%). Most (76%) were treated
with insulin or oral agents for their diabetes, and 45% of those patients taking insulin moni-
tored their blood glucose at least once per day. The patients were frequently screened for
retinopathy (52%), hypertension (88%), and dyslipidemia (84%). Of those patients with hyper-
tension, 83% were diagnosed and treated with antihypertensive agents and only 17% were
undiagnosed or untreated; most of the patients known to have dyslipidemia were treated with
medication or diet (89%). Health status and outcomes were less than optimal: 58% had HbA
1c
7.0, 45% had BMI 30, 28% had microalbuminuria, and 8% had clinical proteinuria. Of
those patients known to have hypertension and dyslipidemia, 60% were not controlled to
accepted levels. In addition, 22% of patients smoked cigarettes, 26% had to be hospitalized dur-
ing the previous year, and 42% assessed their health status as fair or poor.
CONCLUSIONS -- Rates of health care access and utilization, screening for diabetes com-
plications, and treatment of hyperglycemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia in type 2 diabetes are
high; however, health status and outcomes are unsatisfactory. There are likely to be multiple rea-
sons for this discordance, including intractability of diabetes to current therapies, patient self-care
practices, physician medical care practices, and characteristics of U.S. health care systems.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Phase 2 of NHANES III
was conducted from September 1991 to
October 1994 and included a stratified
probability sample of the U.S. population.
Participants were interviewed in their
homes and were given a standardized set of
examinations and laboratory measurements
in an examination center. There were 8,420
participants 25 years of age or older, of
whom 804 had been diagnosed with dia-
betes before the survey. Women with dia-
betes diagnosed only during pregnancy (n =
55) and subjects with type 1 diabetes,
defined as those with age at diagnosis 30
years who had continuous insulin use since
diagnosis (n = 13), were deleted from the
analysis. The remaining 733 subjects were
considered to have type 2 diabetes.
Information was obtained by structured
questionnaires on health insurance, use of
physician services, diabetes therapy, self-
monitoring of blood glucose levels, fre-
quency of dilated eye examinations,
frequency of blood pressure and blood cho-
lesterol screening, self-assessed health sta-
tus, hospitalizations, and cigarette smoking.
Use of medications for treatment of hyper-
tension and dyslipidemia was ascertained
by self-report and by examination of pre-
scription medicine containers and recording
of the name of the medicine by the inter-
viewer. Measurements of height, weight,
HbA
1c
, urine albumin and creatinine, blood
pressure, lipids, and homocysteine were
made during a separate clinical examination
in which 90.5% of the interviewed subjects
participated. HbA
1c
was measured by a
high-performance liquid chromatographic
assay as used in the Diabetes Control and
Complications Trial. Urine albumin was
measured by a solid-phase fluorescent
immunoassay (6). Urine creatinine was
measured by a Jaffe rate reaction in which
creatinine reacts with picrate in an alkaline
solution to form a creatinine-picrate com-
plex, which was read with an ASTRA clini-
cal analyzer (Beckman Instruments,
Fullerton, CA). Microalbuminuria was
defined as a urinary albumin-to-creatinine
ratio of 30­300 µg/mg; clinical proteinuria
was defined as a urinary albumin-to-creati-
nine ratio of 300 µg/mg. Blood pressure
was measured with a standard mercury
sphygmomanometer. Up to 3 measure-
ments during the household interview and
up to 3 measurements during the physical
examination were made, with the partici-
pant in the sitting position after 5 min of
rest. The means of all systolic and diastolic
blood pressures were used to evaluate
hypertension. Hypertension was defined as
systolic blood pressure 140 mmHg or
diastolic blood pressure 90 mmHg or
treatment with antihypertensive medica-
tion. Serum total cholesterol was measured
enzymatically (7) using a commercially
available reagent mixture (Cholesterol/HP;
Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indi-
anapolis, IN). HDL cholesterol was mea-
sured in supernatants after the precipitation
of apolipoprotein B­containing lipoproteins
with heparin-manganese chloride and the
removal of excess manganese by precipita-
tion with sodium bicarbonate (8). Triglyc-
erides were analyzed enzymatically using
commercially available reagents (Agent
Triglycerides Reagent Set; Abbott Laborato-
ries, Chicago). LDL cholesterol was calcu-
lated using the Friedewald equation for
those subjects with triglyceride 400 mg/dl
(9); dyslipidemia was defined as LDL cho-
lesterol 130 mg/dl or treatment with pre-
scribed diet or medication.
Definitions of treatment goals and
abnormal values for HbA
1c
, proteinuria,
obesity, blood pressure, blood lipids, and
homocysteine are those recommended by
the American Diabetes Association; the Joint
National Committee on Detection, Evalua-
tion, and Treatment of High Blood Pressure;
the National Cholesterol Education Pro-
gram; the National Kidney Foundation; and
the American Heart Association (10­14).
Statistical analyses were carried out
using SAS (Cary, NC) with appropriate
sampling weights to adjust for the stratified
sample design. Standard errors were calcu-
lated and logistic regression was performed
using SUDAAN (Research Triangle Insti-
tute, Research Triangle Park, NC), a com-
puter program that adjusts for the cluster
sample design in computing variance.
RESULTS
Health care access and medical care
practices
Measures of health care for patients with
diabetes are shown in Table 1. Almost all of
the patients had 1 primary source of ambu-
latory medical care, described as a physi-
cian's office, clinic, or health center. Most of
these patients consistently saw 1 specific

Health care and health status
physician at this source; 88% had at least
semiannual visits and 65% had at least
quarterly visits. Patients taking insulin had
a higher visit rate (median 5.2 per year)
than patients treated with oral agents or
diet alone (median 3.8 per year).
Almost all of the patients (91%) had
health insurance of some type with 66%
covered through private insurance, 46% by
Medicare, 15% by Medicaid, and 7% by
Champus or the Veterans Administration
(VA). Approximately 40% had multiple
types of health insurance coverage. Of those
patients covered by private insurance, 44%
had Medicare coverage and 9% had Medic-
aid or Champus/VA. Among the patients
with Medicare, 63% had private insurance
and 24% had Medicare and/or Cham-
pus/VA; and among those with Medicaid,
13% had private insurance and 63% had
Medicare.
The majority of patients were treated
with insulin or oral agents for their diabetes
(Table 1); only 4% were treated with both
insulin and oral agents. Insulin use
increased from 18% among the patients
with 5 years since diagnosis of diabetes to
56% among those with 15 years' dura-
tion. Concomitantly, use of oral agents
declined from 60 to 25%. Of insulin-
treated patients, 60% took at least 2
injections per day. Use of prescription med-
icines was common; more than half of the
patients took 3 or more prescribed med-
ications, and 20% took 6 or more.
Self-monitoring of blood glucose was
more common among insulin-treated
patients, of whom 68% monitored at least
once per week and 45% monitored at least
once per day, than among those who were
not treated with insulin (26 and 7%,
respectively). Self-monitoring at least once
per week was also more common among
those with HbA
1c
8% (47%) than among
those with HbA
1c
8% (32%). Urine glu-
cose testing, at least once per week, was
performed by 14% of the patients taking
insulin and 8% of those not taking insulin.
Two-thirds of the patients had a dilated
eye examination during the previous 2 years
and one-half had an examination during
the past year. Almost all of the patients had
their blood pressure checked within the
past 6 months, and most had their choles-
terol measured (Table 1).
Clinical hypertension was present in
63% of patients. Of those patients with
hypertension, 82% were being treated with
antihypertensive medication, and hyper-
tension was undiagnosed or untreated in
only 18% (Table 1). Dyslipidemia was pres-
ent in 67% of patients; of those with dys-
lipidemia, 60% were diagnosed, almost all
of whom were being treated with medica-
tion or a prescribed diet, but 40% of those
with dyslipidemia were undiagnosed.
Health status and outcomes
Health status and outcome measures for
patients with diabetes are shown in Table 2.
At least 58% had an HbA
1c
value 7.0%,
which is the recommended treatment goal
for blood glucose control, including 73% of
the insulin-treated patients, 61% of the
patients taking oral agents, and 35% of
those treated with diet alone. Mean HbA
1c
was 7.8%; this was 5 SD above the mean
value of 5.2% for nondiabetic adults with
normal fasting glucose (110 mg/dl).
Mean HbA
1c
was similar for those treated
with insulin (8.3%) or oral agents (8.0%)
and was lower for those who were treated
with diet alone (6.7%).
The majority of patients were over-
weight: 44% of men and 47% of women
had BMI 30, and only 18% had BMI
25. More than one-third of the patients
had microalbuminuria or clinical protein-
uria (Table 2).
Of those whose hypertension had been
diagnosed before the survey, 59% were not
controlled to the level of 140/90 mmHg.
Together with those who were newly found
to have hypertension at the time of the sur-
vey, 40% of all patients had uncontrolled
hypertension (Table 2). Most of the uncon-
trolled blood pressure was due to isolated
systolic hypertension (81%), with elevated
systolic and diastolic pressures occurring
together (10%) or elevated diastolic pres-
sure occurring alone (9%) being substan-
tially less common.
An aggressive approach, including
dietary changes and drug therapy, is recom-
mended for diabetic patients who have
LDL cholesterol values 130 mg/dl. In
NHANES III, among those who had previ-
ously been diagnosed with dyslipidemia,
only 41% had LDL cholesterol 130 mg/dl.
In addition, about one-fourth of all of the
patients had undiagnosed dyslipidemia. In
sum, 51% of the patients had LDL choles-
terol 130 mg/dl. The percentage distribu-
tions for total cholesterol, HDL cholesterol,
triglycerides, and LDL cholesterol are shown
in Table 2. Large proportions of diabetic
patients had levels that were above normal
for each lipid variable. Elevated levels of
lipoprotein(a) and homocysteine were
found in 27 and 13%, respectively.
Of the patients, 22% were current
cigarette smokers and 42% assessed their
health status as fair or poor, with only 20%
having excellent or good health. One-
fourth had conditions that required hospi-
talization during the prior year.

The frequency of adverse outcomes was
distributed across the group of patients and
was not clustered in any of the subsets of
patients. For the clinical outcomes of hyper-
glycemia (HbA
1c
7.0), obesity (BMI 30),
albuminuria, uncontrolled hypertension
(140/90 mmHg), and uncontrolled
hyperlipidemia (LDL cholesterol 130
mg/dl), most patients had either 1 (27%), 2
(29%), or 3 (26%) occurrences. In logistic
regression analysis adjusted for age, sex,
race, and duration of diabetes, these out-
comes were not significantly associated with
having a primary source of ambulatory
medical care, number of physician visits
per year, having any type of health insur-
ance, or having private insurance (P  0.2).
CONCLUSIONS -- These data, from
a representative national survey, indicate
that the frequencies of health care access
and utilization, screening for diabetes com-
plications, and treatment of hyperglycemia,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia in patients
with type 2 diabetes are high. The patients
had extensive and frequent contact with the
health care system and had health insur-
ance. Most of the patients were treated with
insulin or oral agents for their diabetes,
and many monitored their own blood glu-
cose levels. The patients were frequently
screened for retinopathy, hypertension, and
dyslipidemia. Only a small proportion of
those with hypertension were undiagnosed
or untreated. Most of the patients known to
have dyslipidemia were being treated with
medication or diet.
The NHANES III data also indicate,
however, that health status and outcomes
are far from optimal. Glycemic control was
poor, many patients were obese and had
albuminuria, much of the hypertension and
dyslipidemia was not controlled, one-fourth
of patients had to be hospitalized during the
previous year, and one-fifth of patients
smoked cigarettes. In sum, there appears to
be discordance between health care access
and health outcomes in type 2 diabetes.
If access and utilization of medical care
is not an issue in the health status of patients
with diabetes, what factors might be deter-
mining the poor outcomes in diabetic
patients? The disease may simply be inher-
ently resistant to current treatment methods.
Diabetes is perceived to be significantly more
difficult to manage than other common
chronic conditions (15). The NHANES III
data indicate that control of hyperglycemia,
hypertension, dyslipidemia, and other risk
factors for diabetes complications is com-
plex. Even in the setting of the UKPDS clin-
ical trial of glycemic control of patients with
type 2 diabetes, fasting glucose increased
markedly over 9 years of follow-up, reflect-
ing progressive failure of islet function (16).
The intractability of obesity in diabetic
patients to treatment is well recognized.
There may be inadequate use or under-
utilization of medications to treat hypergly-
cemia, hypertension, and dyslipidemia.
Monotherapy with diet, sulfonylurea, or
insulin becomes increasingly less effective
with time, and the majority of patients
require multiple therapies to achieve
glycemic control over the long term (16). In
NHANES III, the proportion of patients tak-
ing oral agents decreased with longer dura-
tion of diabetes and the proportion taking
insulin increased, implying that patients
were being transferred from oral agents to
insulin rather than adding a second therapy.
Only 4% used both insulin and oral agents.
Some under-utilization of medication
may be due to failure by patients to take the
medications they have been prescribed. For
example, among patients who were pre-
scribed oral agents to take twice per day, on
only 66% of days was this regimen followed
(17). Difficulties with medication occur
more often among older patients and those
taking multiple medications, which were
characteristics of the NHANES III patients.
Inadequate patient skills, knowledge,
and motivation about self-care are impor-
tant determinants of adverse health out-
comes. Daily self-care is a central element in
the management of diabetes, and semian-
nual or quarterly visits to physicians, such
as those of the NHANES III patients, are
insufficient for this daily care. Although
many NHANES III patients did not monitor
their blood glucose levels as frequently as
might be deemed optimal, the efficacy of
self-monitoring in type 2 diabetes is ques-
tionable (18). Physicians routinely indicate
that noncompliance by patients with dia-
betes is the most common barrier to care
(19), but there can be a marked gap
between patients' receipt of information
about self-care from their physicians and
the patients' absorbing or retaining this
information (20).
Physician practice behaviors and set-
tings are influential in determining health
outcomes in diabetes. Most primary care for
diabetes is delivered by internists and gen-
eral and family practitioners. Physicians
who see more than the average number of
patients per unit of time tend to have lower
rates of testing for HDL cholesterol and pro-
teinuria and of referrals for ophthalmic
examination (21). Even though diabetes is a
common condition, physicians may not see
many patients with diabetes; in 1 large staff-
model health maintenance organization,
90% of the primary care physicians had
60 patients with diabetes (22). Many pri-
mary care physicians do not have organized
systems for care of chronic illness (23).
Adequate co-involvement of the med-
ical care team, the patient, and the family
appears to be sentinel in effective manage-
ment of diabetes. Clinical trials have demon-
strated that health care systems that use
nurses and other nonphysician personnel as
case managers and those with telephone-
based contact are efficacious in improving
glycemic control, blood pressure, and lipid
levels (24­27). A key element in the success
of the Diabetes Control and Complications
Trial was the frequent clinic visits involving
nurses and dietitians, and the extensive tele-
phone access to these health care practition-
ers afforded to patients in the intensive
intervention group in which HbA
1c
remained low throughout the study (28).
Availability of social support, such as that
provided by nurse case managers, appears to
be a major factor that contributes to adher-
ence by diabetic patients to such behaviors
as following a diabetic diet, weight loss, tak-
ing prescribed medications, checking blood
glucose, and checking feet (29).
In summary, although rates of health
care access, screening for diabetes compli-
cations, and treatment of hyperglycemia,
hypertension, and dyslipidemia in type 2
diabetes are high, health status and out-
comes are unsatisfactory. There are likely to
be multiple reasons for this discordance,
including intractability of diabetes to cur-
rent therapies, patient self-care practices,
physician medical care practices, and char-
acteristics of U.S. health care systems.
