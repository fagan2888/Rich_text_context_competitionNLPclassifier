Exploratory factor analysis tested the extent to which measures of incivilities
and measures of both crime perceptions and victimization had distinct factor
loadings in one- and two-factor models. Confirmatory factor analysis tested
the fit of one- and two-factor structural equation models. Exploratory and
confirmatory factor analysis showed that perceptual incivilities measures and
victimization reports tended to load on distinct factors, offering evidence of the
discriminant validity of perceptual incivilities measures relative to victimization
reports. Exploratory and confirmatory analysis of perceived incivilities measures
and measures of perceptions of crime provided equivocal results. In exploratory
factor analysis, perceived incivilities measures and measures of crime percep-
tions did not always load on distinct factors and confirmatory factor analysis
models did not meet the specified thresholds for good model fit across all fit
criteria.

Introduction
The potential link between public incivilities and crime was popularized by
Wilson and Kelling in their seminal work Broken Windows. Subsequently, the
hypothesized link between incivilities and crime has had a major influence on
both popular thinking about the causes of crime, and public policy intended to
address crime (Kelling, 1997; Skolnick, 1997). Concomitant with this influence,

INCIVILITIES DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY 281
public incivilities have been an important part of theory and research on both
ecological explanations of crime and explanations of citizen fear of crime.
Incivilities are typically divided into two primary dimensions: social and
physical. Physical incivilities often include such things as broken windows and
vacant lots, while social incivilities include loitering, loud parties, drug sales
and prostitution. Within contemporary theories highlighting the importance of
incivilities, social and physical incivilities are unique characteristics of neigh-
borhoods causally linked to a number of important outcomes including crime
(Taylor, 2001; Wilson & Kelling, 1982), fear of crime (Hunter, 1978; Lewis &
Salem, 1986), and neighborhood decline (Skogan, 1990).
Recently, the research incorporating measures of incivilities have been called
into question. Taylor (1999) notes that the discriminant validity of measures of
public incivilities has not been established in the literature. Despite this impor-
tant challenge only two studies have directly addressed the discriminant validity
of incivilities measures. These include Taylor's (1999) own work and a recent
test by Worrall (2006). While each of these studies represent an important
contribution, the discriminant validity of incivilities measures remains at issue.
Here we contribute to this limited body of research by offering an additional
test of the discriminant validity of physical and social incivilities measures.
The Relationship between Incivilities, Crime, and Fear of Crime
Public incivilities or disorders have been linked to a number of outcomes includ-
ing fear of crime, crime and neighborhood decline. Early work emphasizing
incivilities argued that citizen fear of crime was partially determined by incivil-
ities (Wilson, 1975) or a sense of urban unease (Garafalo & Laub, 1978). Hunter
(1978) theorized that signs of incivilities and crime have a reciprocal relation-
ship with each in turn influencing fear of crime. The interactive influence of
incivilities and crime and fear of crime was further emphasized by Lewis and
Salem (1986) who argued that citizen fear of crime will be particularly
pronounced when both crime and incivilities are high, and low when either fear
of crime or crime itself is low.
Other theoretical models ascribing an important causal influence to incivili-
ties have focused on the explanation of crime. In their Broken Windows theory,
Wilson and Kelling (1982) argue that public incivilities have an important
influence on crime through informal social control. Incivilities are thought to
lead to citizen withdrawal from public spaces, reducing informal social control
and emboldening offenders. This in turn leads to fear of crime, additional
withdrawal and an increase in serious offenses. Extending the scope of
outcomes influenced by incivilities, Skogan (1990) incorporates incivilities in an
explanation of urban decline. In this model, incivilities influence urban decline
though three primary mediating processes: (1) informal social control, (2)
community morale, contributed to by concerns about neighborhood safety or
fear of crime, and (3) instability in the housing market.
282 ARMSTRONG AND KATZ
Not all scholars agree that incivilities cause crime. In work largely devoted to
developing and argument against order maintenance policing, Harcourt (2001)
summarily rejects the link between incivilities and crime specified by Wilson
and Kelling. In a more moderate dissenting voice, Sampson and Raudenbush
(1999) acknowledge incivilities have important implications for neighborhood
development, while arguing both incivilities and crime are a result of the same
explanatory process. In this process, community structural characteristics,
including concentrated disadvantage and residential instability, impact neigh-
borhood collective efficacy, a mix of informal social control and social cohesion.
This general process then influences both incivilities and crime.
The Validity of Incivilities Measures
Support for a link between incivilities and crime and the link between incivili-
ties and fear of crime can be found in a growing number of studies (reviews and
recent studies include Brown, Perkins, & Brown, 2004; Covington & Taylor,
1991; Harrell & Gouvis, 1994; Perkins, Meeks, & Taylor, 1992; Robinson,
Lawton, Taylor, & Perkins, 2003; Rountree & Land, 1996a, 1996b; Sampson &
Raudenbush, 1999, 2004; Skogan, 1990; Taylor, 2001). However, there is some
question as to the validity of incivility measures used in studies testing the link
between incivilities and crime.
Taylor (1999) argues that theories specifying a link between incivilities and
crime "propose that incivilities represent a construct separate from other
related features of the individual, street block and neighborhood. But research-
ers have not yet examined the discriminant validity of incivilities indicators"
(p. 65). Discriminant validity, popularized through Campbell and Fiske's (1959)
multitrait-multimethod matrix technique for assessing construct validity, holds
that measures of multiple constructs taken with a single measurement method
should be empirically distinguishable from each other.
Its not hard to imagine why it might be difficult to distinguish measures of
incivilities from measures of fear of crime or measures of crime itself. As it is
typically defined in the literature, incivilities have much in common with crime.
Some of the indicators of incivilities such as drug sales and prostitution, typically
incorporated in incivilities measures, are less serious forms of crime. In theoret-
ical models it is anticipated that these less serious forms of crime, which are
conceptualized as an element of a larger incivilities construct, will lead to serious
crime. While conceptually distinct, it remains to be seen of indicators of incivil-
ities, including forms of less serious crime can be empirically distinguished from
measures of serious crime. It may be that perceptions of incivilities and percep-
tion of crime are both driven by a more global impression of one's neighborhood.
Concerns regarding discriminant validity of incivilities measures are particu-
larly relevant when measures of crime and incivilities are measured with a
single survey. When addressing research on the relationship between incivilities
and fear of crime, Taylor (1999) notes that the strong association between fear
INCIVILITIES DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY 283
and incivilities may be in part attributable to shared method variance. Shared
method variance occurs when two constructs are measured with the same
method, and this shared measurement method increases the strength of
relationship between these constructs (Campbell & Fiske, 1959). Taylor's (1999)
concerns regarding the influence of shared survey method variance on the
relationship between incivilities and fear can be extended to the relationship
between incivilities and crime, further highlighting the need to establish the
discriminant validity of incivilities measures.
A handful of studies have addressed the discriminant validity of perceptual
incivilities measures. Perceptual incivilities measures typically refer to incivili-
ties measures based on citizen perceptions of incivilities through a survey.
Studies providing results relevant for a discussion of the validity of perceptual
incivilities measures include work testing the association between incivilities
and other non-crime neighborhood characteristics and work with a direct focus
on testing the discriminant validity of perceptual incivilities measures by assess-
ing the extent to which incivilities measures can be empirically distinguished
from perceptual crime measures.
Work exploring the relationship between incivilities measures and other non-
crime neighborhood characteristics provides mixed evidence regarding the
discriminant validity of perceptual incivilities measures. Taylor (1995) found
that the racial composition of a neighborhood had a heavy influence on
residents' perceptions of graffiti prevalence. Other work by Taylor, Koons,
Kurtz, Greene, and Perkins (1995) has found perceptions of incivilities loaded on
separate factors than land-use features, but were not distinct from measures of
territorial signage and defensible space.
Sampson and Raudenbush (2004) explored the neighborhood characteristics
that influence resident perceptions of incivilities using data describing approxi-
mately 500 block groups from 196 census tracts in the city of Chicago. Among
potential predictors of perceived incivilities, the authors included measures of
socio-demographic characteristics and an observation measures of incivilities
(for a full description of this measure see Sampson & Raudenbush, 1999).
Results showed that the observational measure of incivilities predicted
perceived incivilities, but "racial and economic context matter more" (p. 319).
Collectively the work of Sampson and Raudenbush and that of Taylor show that
it is difficult to discriminate between citizen perceptions of incivilities and
other neighborhood characteristics including indicators of race, economic
context, territorial signage and defensible space.
Recently two studies have offered direct assessments of the discriminant
validity of incivilities relative to crime. These studies are particularly important
as they test the validity of measures of the incivilities construct. The incivilities
construct has played a central role in causal models that have served as the
theoretical underpinning of order maintenance policing. Should the results of
these studies show that measures of incivilities are indistinguishable from
measures of crime it would undermine weight that may be given the causal
models that have been used to support order maintenance policing.
284 ARMSTRONG AND KATZ
As part of a broad assessment of theory measurement and policy regarding
incivilities, Taylor (1999) assessed the relationship between perceived incivili-
ties and official measures of crime using neighborhood level data from five
cities. Indicators of incivilities included vandalism, rowdy teens and abandoned
buildings. Crime measures included rates of robbery and assault. Exploratory
factor analysis found incivilities measures and official crime rate measures
loaded on separate factors. These results suggest that at the neighborhood level
incivilities measures may be discriminable from official crime rate measures.
Worrall (2006) offers the sole test of the discriminant validity of measures of
perceived incivilities relative to measures of perceived crime and reports of
victimization. For this test, analyses were based on survey data from approxi-
mately 14,000 respondents across 12 cities where police departments were
practicing community policing.1 Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses
provided mixed results. Survey respondents were able to distinguish their
perceptions of physical incivilities from their reports of victimization; however,
they were unable to distinguish their perceptions of social incivilities from their
reports of victimization.
Results for the discriminate validity of incivilities measures relative to
respondents' perceptions of crime did not support the discriminant validity of
incivilities measures. Confirmatory factor analysis found that crime measurers
and incivilities measures did not always load on distinct factors. Exploratory
factor analysis based on structural equation models yielded model fit statistics
that indicated that both factor models provided a poor fit to the data. Worrall
(2006) concludes "Thus additional research is called for before it can be known
for sure whether people can separate perceptions of crime from perceptions of
incivilities" (p. 379).
Method
Despite its importance for ecological theories of crime and for police policy,
relatively little attention has been paid to the discriminant validity of measures
of incivilities used in tests of neighborhood characteristics associated with
crime. In the current work we extended the limited literature on the discrimi-
nant validity of perceptual incivilities measures by building on the work of
Worrall (2006). Our analysis was based on data from a major Southwestern city.
Importantly these data have a key methodological feature distinguishing them
from the data used by Worrall (2006). The data used herein include indicators of
perceived incivilities and perceived crime gathered with ordinal response
categories, while indicators of incivilities, and crime used in Worrall's (2006)
study were dichotomous. We anticipate that this difference might lead to
different results. Ordinal response categories preserve information lost in
1. Data collected with the Bureau of Justice Statistics Survey entitled "Criminal Victimization and
Perceptions of Community Safety in 12 United States Cities, 1998" (ICPSR Study No. 2743).
INCIVILITIES DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY 285
dichotomous response categories. This additional variation may make it possible
to discriminate between responses to two closely linked but conceptually
distinct constructs such as incivilities and crime.
Sample
Analyses are based on data from Mesa, Arizona. Mesa has a relatively low level
of unemployment (2.2%) and high median household income ($33,676), although
a number of its residents still live below the poverty line (10%). Mesa experi-
enced substantial growth between 1990 and 2000. In 2000, about 405,000
individuals resided in the city compared with 288,000 in 1990. The ethnic
composition of the community is diverse, with Caucasians making up approxi-
mately 78.9% of the community; Hispanics, 15.5%; African Americans, 2.3%;
Asians, 1.6%; and American Indians, 1.2%. Mesa's crime rate is somewhat higher
than that of some Southwestern cities (e.g., Las Vegas, Los Angeles, San Diego),
but lower than that of others (e.g., Albuquerque, Phoenix).
Data were gathered with a survey of citizens residing in Mesa, Arizona. The
survey sample consisted of 800 randomly selected respondents.2 Survey data
were collected using a telephone survey conducted in September and October
2002. Households included in the sample were drawn at random, with any
member over the age of 17 eligible to complete the interview. The survey took
approximately 20 minutes to administer. It included questions about the respon-
dents' perceptions of physical and social incivilities, perceptions of crime, and
reports of victimization. Sample characteristics are presented in Table 1.
Variables
Data included indicators of respondents' perceptions of incivilities and crime as
well as respondent reports of victimization.
Perceived incivilities
Respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which 14 indicators of incivil-
ities were prevalent in their neighborhood. Responses were: "not a problem,"
"somewhat of a problem," and "big problem." Incivilities measures included
seven indicators of physical incivilities and six indicators of social incivilities.
Indicators of physical incivilities included broken windows, unkempt property,
2. About 75% of those contacted agreed to participate in the survey. Just fewer than 2% were unable
to complete it due to language barriers; all others who refused stated that they were not available
to complete the survey at the time, or asked that the interviewer call back at another time. Our
sample contained slightly more Whites and included a greater number of older persons and women
when compared with the city's general population.
286 ARMSTRONG AND KATZ
vandalism/graffiti, vacant lots, vacant houses/buildings, abandoned cars and
trash. Indicators of social incivilities included groups of loitering teenagers,
drunks or tramps, harassment, people fighting or arguing, noisy neighbors, and
drug dealing.
Perceived crime
Respondents' perceptions of crime in their neighborhood were based on
responses to questions regarding the prevalence of four crimes: burglary, car
theft, robbery and assault. Response categories were: "not a problem," "some-
what of a problem," "a big problem." For each crime type respondents were
asked two questions. The first addressed respondents' perceptions regarding
non-gang related crime, the second addressed respondent perceptions regarding
gang related crime. For example, the first question addressing respondents'

perceptions of robbery in their neighborhood asked "in your neighborhood is
non-gang related robbery, not a problem, somewhat of a problem, or a big
problem." The second question asked how much of a problem gang related
robbery was. To create a single indicator of respondent perceptions of each
crime type, responses to both questions addressing a single type of crime were
summed and then returned to their original metric.
Victimization
Victimization measures included general indicators of direct personal victim-
ization and indirect vicarious victimization. Personal victimization was
measured with a question asking the respondent to indicate whether or not in
the past 12 months they have been "verbally harassed, physically intimi-
dated, assaulted, robbed or had their property vandalized or stolen." Indirect
victimization was measured by asking respondents to indicate whether or not
someone in their household or a neighbor had been "verbally harassed, physi-
cally intimidated, assaulted, robbed or had their property vandalized or
stolen."
Analysis
Following Worrall (2006), we conducted a two-stage test of the discriminant
validity of measures of perceived incivilities. The first stage was an exploratory
factor analysis based on traditional factor analytic techniques. The second stage
was a confirmatory factor analysis based on structural equation measurement
models. This approach is widely used in fields with an emphasis on the demon-
stration of the discriminant validity of key constructs (for examples and key
studies, see Anderson, 1987; Kenny & Kashy, 1992; Kumar & Dillon, 1990; Marsh,
1989; Marsh & Bailey, 1991). Prior to our test of discriminant validity we split
the overall sample into two randomly selected subsamples (Hayduk, 1987).
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses were each based on a distinct
subsample.
In the first stage of analysis, traditional factor analytic techniques were used
to determine whether or not measures of incivilities loaded on a factor distinct
from measures of perceived crime and reports of victimization. In this stage,
measures of perceptions of incivilities have discriminant validity relative to
measures of perceived crime when each set of measures loads on a distinct
factor.
In the second stage of analysis, structural equation measurement models
were used to confirm the results of exploratory factor analysis. Fit statistics
from structural equation models evaluate the overall fit of distinct factor struc-
tures. In this stage, discriminant validity is indicated when a model specifying
two distinct factors, for example perceived incivilities and perceived crime, has
288 ARMSTRONG AND KATZ
adequate model fit and represents an improvement in fit over a one-factor
model.
In each stage of our data analysis, we use analytical techniques that can
accommodate ordinal and dichotomous measures. Traditional factor analysis and
structural equation modeling techniques assume that indicators are continuous.
Our measures of perceived incivilities and perceived crime were ordinal and our
measures of reported victimization were dichotomous. When data are measured
at the ordinal level, factor analysis and structural equation models can be based
on the polychoric correlation matrix. Similarly, when data are measured at the
dichotomous level, factor analysis and structural equation models may be based
on the tetrachoric correlation matrix.3 Both the tetrachoric and polychoric
correlations approximate the Pearson correlation that one would obtain if data
were measured continuously. For the current analysis, tetrachoric and poly-
choric correlations were obtained using LISREL 8.80.
An initial review of the data revealed that across all measures of respon-
dents' perceptions of crime in their neighborhood just over 22% of the sample
did not provide a valid response to at least one of the crime measures. Across
the other types of measures included in our data--social and physical incivilities
and reports of victimization--missing data were much less common ranging from
3.25% to 8.36%. Among measures of respondents' perception of crime missing
data were largely attributable to responses of "don't know" to queries regard-
ing the prevalence of different types of crime.
To assess the potential impact of missing data on the generalizability of our
results, we compared those having missing data for any crime measure to those
with responses for each crime measure across a number of demographic charac-
teristics. Those missing data for any crime measures were not significantly
different from those with complete data for crime measures with regard to
homeownership, income, marriage, and age; however, those missing data for
any crime measure were more likely to have reported a higher level of educa-
tion, had lived in their neighborhoods longer and were more likely to be White.
Results
Descriptive statistics for measures of perceived incivilities, perceived crime and
reported victimization are presented in Table 2. For measures of perceived
social incivilities mean values were highest for noisy neighbors and loitering.
Across indicators of perceived physical incivilities unkempt property and vandal-
ism/graffiti had the highest mean values. Mean values for perceived crime show
that perceptions of property crime were elevated relative to perceptions of
violent crime. With regard to victimization, means for these measures show that

reports of indirect victimization were more common than reports of personal
victimization.
Exploratory Factor Analysis
The discriminant validity of measures of perceived incivilities was assessed with
an exploratory factor analysis, where measures of physical incivilities and
measures of perceived crime were initially constrained to load on a single
factor. Subsequently, these measures were allowed to load on two factors.
Results for these factor analyses are presented on the left half of Table 3. The
first column of coefficients are factor loadings for both physical incivilities and
perceived crime on a single factor, the second and third columns of coefficients
are factor loadings for physical incivilities and perceived crime for two distinct
factors.
In an exploratory factor analysis of this type discriminant validity is indicated
when measures of physical incivilities and measures of perceived crime load on
two distinct factors. Results show that this was largely the case for our
measures of perceived physical incivilities and perceived crime. Six of seven,

measures of perceived physical incivilities had elevated values for the first
factor in the two-factor model (second column of coefficients) and had low
values for the second factor (third column of coefficients) in the two-factor
model. In a single noteworthy exception to this general pattern, the indicator of
respondent perceptions of vandalism/graffiti had a lower loading on the first
factor.
Measures of perceived crime had low values for the first factor in the two-
factor model (second column of coefficients) and high values for the second
factor in the two-factor model (third column of coefficients). Overall, these
results indicate that with the exception of perceptions of vandalism/graffiti the
indicators of physical incivilities included in our factor analysis had discriminant
validity relative to measures of crime perceptions.
The procedure outlined above was also applied to measures of social incivili-
ties and measures of crime perceptions. Results are presented in the right half

incivilities were all elevated for the first factor and lower for the second factor.

contrast, factor loadings for respondent perceptions of assault are similar across
the first (.62) and second factor (.59). These results show that measures of
social incivilities are discriminable from measures of burglary, car theft and
robbery.
Exploratory factor analysis was also used to test the discriminant validity of
indicators of perceived incivilities relative to reports of personal and indirect
victimization.4 Results are presented in Table 4. In the two-factor model for
perceived physical incivilities, six of seven measures of perceived physical
incivilities have large factor loadings on the first factor and relatively small
factor loadings for the second factor. A single indicator of perceived physical
incivilities, vandalism/graffiti, has a factor loading that is slightly lower on the
first factor than on the second factor. Victimization reports have small factor
loadings on the first factor and large factor loadings on the second.
4. For the exploratory factor analysis of perceived incivilities and reported victimization measures,
indicators of perceived incivilities were dichotomized to match the level of measurement of victim-
ization reports.

the first factor and lower factor loadings on the second factor. This pattern is
reversed for victimization reports. This pattern suggests that measures of social
incivilities have discriminant validity relative to reports of victimization.
Confirmatory Factor Analysis
Structural equation models used in our confirmatory factor analysis are
presented in Figures 1 and 2. When we explore the factor structure of measures
of perceived physical incivilities relative to measures of perceived crime, there
are 11 observed in indicators (from X1 to X11). These observed indicators are our
seven indicators of perceived physical incivilities and four indicators of
perceived crime. In the first model, depicted in Figure 1, each of the observed
indicators is jointly determined by a single underlying latent factor (), in
combination with a unique error term (from 1 to 11). The magnitude of
expected change in each of the observed indicators attendant to change in the
latent factor is indicated by lambda ().

Model fit and identification
In confirmatory factor analysis, discriminant validity is indicated when two-
factor models provide a fit to the data that is better than the fit of the one factor
model and above the threshold for adequate fit. There are a number of indices

INCIVILITIES DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY 293
of fit for structural equation models. In assessing model fit no single statistic
necessarily indicates the fit of a structural equation model. Rather model fit is
by assessing values on a number of distinct fit statistics (Hu & Bentler, 1999;
Jaccard & Wan, 1996; Kline, 1998). Here we utilize the same four measures of fit

used by Worrall (2006). These measures are the ratio of Chi-square to the degrees
of freedom (CMIN/DF), the adjusted goodness-of-fit index (AGFI), Hoelter's
(1983) Critical N, and the root mean square error of approximation (RMSEA).
These measures represent a reasonable cross-section of available fit statistics
and will jointly allow a comprehensive assessment of model fit.5
Though there is some variability in the literature, it is generally accepted that
CMIN/DF ratios smaller than three indicate that the model provides a good fit to
the data (Carmines & McIver, 1981; Kline, 1998). The AFGI ranges from 0 to 1.0.
Typically values over .9 are regarded as having good fit (Bentler, 1990).
Hoelter's (1983) Critical N represents the largest sample size at which you would
fail to reject the hypothesis that the model provides adequate fit. Critical N
values over 200 are indicative of good fit. The RMSEA is described by Browne and
Cudeck (1989) as asking the question "How well would the model, with unknown
but optimally chosen parameter values, fit the population covariance matrix if it
were available?" (Browne & Cudeck, 1989, pp. 137Â­138). Generally it is thought
that RMSEA values less than .05 are indicative of good fit (MacCallum, Browne, &
Sugawara, 1996), but recently Hu and Bentler (1999) have argued that this crite-
ria should be relaxed with values below .06 indicating good fit.
In confirmatory factor analysis, the unmeasured latent variables, perceived
physical incivilities for example, have no predetermined scale. As a conse-
quence, it is necessary to specify structural equation models in such a way as to
determine the scale of the latent factor(s). The most straightforward and
common method for determining the scale of a latent factor is to constrain the
value of one-factor loading to one for each latent factor included in the
structural equation model. In our confirmatory factor analyses there is a single
latent factor in the first model, and therefore one-factor loading constrained to
be one, and two latent factors in the second model and therefore two-factor
loadings constrained to be one.
Confirmatory factor analysis results
Results for the confirmatory factor analyses based on indicators of perceived
physical incivilities and indicators of perceived crime are presented on the left
hand side of Table 5. Fit statistics show that the one-factor model provided a
mediocre fit to the data. Some fit indices indicated adequate model fit (CMIN/
DF and Critical N), while others indicated model fit is unsatisfactory (AGFI,
RMSEA). When a two-factor model was used, model fit improved somewhat but
the AGFI was still relatively low. A similar pattern of results was found in
structural equation models testing the factor structure of perceived social
incivilities indicators relative to perceived crime indicators. Again some fit
5. With four fit statistics we meet the recommendation of Jaccard and Wan (1996) who recommend
the use of at least three fit statistics and the more stringent recommendation of Kline (1998, p. 130)
who suggests the use of four or more.
INCIVILITIES DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY 295
indices indicated adequate model fit, while others indicated model fit is unsat-
isfactory. Model fit improved with the two-factor model but the AGFI remained
low.
Next, we explored the extent to which model fit for the two-factor models
presented in Table 5 could be improved by allowing errors to correlate. The
two-factor models specified in Table 5 assumed error terms were uncorrelated.
However, it seems reasonable to suggest that the unmeasured characteristics
that determine respondents' perceptions of the prevalence of vacant lots may
also influence respondent perceptions of vacant houses, or in structural
equation modeling terms, the errors terms for the indicators of perceptions of
vacant lost and perceptions of vacant houses are correlated. For readers

unfamiliar with the use of structural equation models in confirmatory factor
analysis, it may be necessary to note that this is an entirely common procedure
that is frequently used in confirmatory factory analysis (see e.g. JÃ¶reskog &
SÃ¶rbom, 2001).
Results for two-factor models allowing correlated errors are presented in
Table 6. In each of these models, errors were allowed to be correlated if
modification indices were four or greater. Modification indices are the
improvement in model fit, as measured by decrease in model Chi-square,
that would be realized by allowing two error terms to correlate. Errors were
only allowed to correlate within factor, in other words errors for perceived
physical incivilities indicators were only allowed to correlate with other
errors of perceived incivilities indicators. At no time was an error term for an

incivilities indicator allowed to correlate with an error term of an indicator
of crime perceptions.
In the two-factor model testing the factor structure of perceived physical
incivilities indicators relative to perceived crime indicators, there were two
correlations among error terms for perceived incivilities and two correlations
among error terms for crime measures.6 Model fit statistics show that these
models provided an adequate but less than spectacular fit to the data, as AGFI's
are still a bit low, as values above .9 are generally held to be unambiguously
indicative a of good fit.
The two-factor model testing the factor structure of perceived social incivili-
ties indicator relative to perceived crime indicators allowed one correlation
among error terms for physical incivilities indicators and one correlation among
error terms for crime perceptions.7 Again model fit statistics indicated
an adequate fit but were still less than perfect, as the AGFI was improved but
still low.
Table 7 presents the results for confirmatory factory analysis based on indica-
tors of perceived social incivilities and reports of victimization. Across both sets
of incivilities measures we find that three of four fit indices showed that a one-
factor model provided a good fit to the data with the single exception being the
RMSEA. When two-factor models were estimated, model fit improved and fit
statistics indicated that these models provided a good fit to the data. The
RMSEA for the two-factor model incorporating indicators of perceived physical
incivilities reached the cut off point advocated by Hu and Bentler (1999) and the
RMSEA for the two-factor model incorporating indicators of perceived social
incivilities meet the more stringent criteria advocated by others (MacCallum,
Browne, & Sugawara, 1996).
Discussion
The results of exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis provide mixed
evidence regarding the discriminant validity of measures of perceived incivilities
relative to measures of perceived crime and victimization reports. Overall, we
find fairly consistent evidence that measures of incivilities enjoy discriminant
validity relative to victimization reports. Our results for the discriminant validity
of perceptual incivilities measures relative to respondents' perceptions of crime
were less consistent. Below we first discuss our results for analyses testing the
discriminant validity of measures of perceived incivilities relative to victimization
6. Correlations among error terms for physical incivilities measures were between error terms for
broken windows and unkempt properties and between error terms for unkempt property and vacant
lots. Correlations among error terms for perceived crime were between error terms for burglary and
assault and between error terms for car theft and robbery.
7. The correlation among error terms for social incivilities measures was between error terms for
loitering and drunks/homeless. The correlation among error terms for perceived crime indicators
was between the error term for car theft and the effort term for burglary.

reports. We then discuss results for analyses testing the discriminant validity of
measures of perceived incivilities relative to measures of perceived crime.
Perceptual Incivilities Measures and Victimization Reports
The majority of results for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis showed
that perceptual incivilities measures and victimization reports loaded on distinct
factors. The single exception to this general pattern came in exploratory factor
analysis where an indicator of physical incivilities--vandalism/graffiti--had a
factor loading opposite of other indicators of physical incivilities and consistent
with victimization reports. Regarding the discriminant validity of social incivili-
ties measures relative to victimization reports exploratory and confirmatory

factor analyses both indicated incivilities measures and victimization reports
loaded on distinct factors.
Perceptual Incivilities Measures and Perceptions of Crime
Exploratory and confirmatory analysis of perceived incivilities measures and
measures of perceptions of crime provided equivocal results. Exploratory factor
analysis showed that perceived incivilities indicators and crime perceptions
indicators loaded on distinct factors with two important exceptions. A single
indicator of physical incivilities--vandalism/graffiti--had a higher factor loading
on the factor favored by each of the crime perceptions indicators. As noted
earlier, factor loadings for this same indicator of physical incivilities were also
reversed when indicators of perceived incivilities were included in exploratory
factor analyses with victimization reports.
In the second exception the pattern outlined above, exploratory factor
analysis showed that one of our crime measures, perceptions of assault, had a
factor loading consistent with loadings from social incivilities measures. This
result shows that respondents were unable to discriminate perceptions of
assault from perceptions of social incivilities. Respondents may be unable to
discriminate perceptions of assault from perceptions of social incivilities due
to the content of some of the social incivilities measures. One measure in
particular, fighting/arguing seems to index a range of behaviors that overlaps
considerably with the behaviors that would qualify as assault in the eyes of
those responding to the survey.
In confirmatory factor analysis of perceived incivilities measures and
measures of perceived crime, we were able to estimate two-factor models that
provided what can be regarded as an adequate fit to the data by allowing a
limited number of correlations among errors for perceived incivilities measures
and among errors for perceived crime measures.
Comparing Our Results with those of Worrall (2006)
In our analyses we extended Worrall's (2006) work by using perceived incivili-
ties measures and perceived crime measures taken at the ordinal level. As a
whole, our results are more supportive of the discriminant validity of percep-
tual incivilities measures. At this time it seems reasonable to attribute this
difference, at least in part, to differences across the two studies in the level of
measurement for incivilities measures. We use ordinal level data, while
Worrall's (2006) analysis was based on binary data. Therefore when contrasted
with the work of Worrall (2006), our results suggest that the measures of
perceived incivilities taken at higher levels of measurement will provide stron-
ger evidence of discriminant validity. We recognize, however, that other
differences between our study and that of Worrall (2006) may also play a part
300 ARMSTRONG AND KATZ
in explaining differences in results across the two studies. Other important
differences include differences in measures of incivilities and differences in
measures of crime perceptions.
In both studies, the measures of perceived physical incivilities included indi-
cators of abandoned cars/buildings, unkempt property, trash and vacant lots.
Unique indicators of perceived physical incivilities included in our study were
broken windows, vandalism, and vacant houses. Unique indicators of perceived
physical incivilities in the work of Worrall (2006) were poor lighting and over-
grown shrubs/trees.
Indicators of perceived social incivilities held in common by the respective
studies included drug sales, loitering, drunks/tramps, and harassment. Items
used to measure perceived social incivilities in the current work but not
employed in the measure of perceived social incivilities used by Worrall (2006)
were fighting and arguing and noisy neighbors. Items used by Worrall (2006) to
measure perceived social incivilities, but not included in the measure of
perceived social incivilities employed in the current work were vandalism/
graffiti, prostitution, and truancy/skip school. It is important to note, differ-
ences across the results presented here and those of Worrall (2006) may be
influenced by the differences in measurement outlined above. Similarly,
differences in results across the two studies may also be influenced by differ-
ences in the types of crime assessed by perceptual crime measures.
Though still best described as equivocal, the results of our exploratory and
confirmatory factor analysis of perceived incivilities measures and perceived
crime measures suggest that these two sets of measures load on distinct factors.
In contrast, Worrall (2006) concluded that the poor fit of two-factor models
indicated "respondents were unable to distinguish between perceived crime and
either physical or social incivilities" (p. 376).
While some of the differences between the results of our factor analysis
and those of Worrall's (2006) may be attributable to differences in level of
measurement and differences in incivilities measures, differences may also be
attributable to the type of crime perceptions measured in the two respective
studies. Worrall (2006) included measures of respondents' perceptions of auto
theft, theft of property, breaking and entering, violent attacks, gun crime, and
sexual assault/rape. In our study we included measures of respondent percep-
tions of burglary, car theft, robbery and assault.
Worrall's (2006) exploratory factor analysis showed that respondents were able
to clearly distinguish perceptions of theft of property and breaking and entering
from both physical and social incivilities. Perceptions of violent attacks and gun
crime were also distinct from both but to a lesser degree. In our exploratory factor
analysis, respondents were able to distinguish perceptions of burglary, car theft
and robbery from perceptions of both physical and social incivilities.
Differences across the two sets of results under consideration here can also
be found for exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis of perceptions of inci-
vilities relative to victimization reports. Our results showed that measures of
both physical and social incivilities and reports of victimization tended to load
INCIVILITIES DISCRIMINANT VALIDITY 301
on distinct factors. Worrall (2006) reported that "exploratory and confirmatory
factor analysis revealed that perceptions of incivilities (of the physical variety)
loaded on factors separate from personal victimization" (p. 360), but found
two-factor confirmatory factor analysis models for measures of social incivilities
and victimization reports provided a poor fit to the data.
To summarize, our results advance the literature by testing the discriminant
validity of perceptual incivilities measures with ordinal data, while previous
work relied on binary data. Contrasting the results of our work with that of
Worrall (2006) suggests that ordinal measures of perceptual incivilities provide
stronger evidence of discriminant validity than binary measures. We also
advance the literature by testing the discriminant validity of perceptual incivili-
ties measures relative to a different set of crime measures than that used in
earlier research. This proves to be an important extension of the earlier litera-
ture when exploratory factor analysis shows that our measure of perceptions of
robbery, a measure not included in earlier work, is distinct from measures of
perceptions of both physical and social incivilities. Finally, we find that
evidence for the discriminant validity of perceptions of incivilities is strongest
when these measures are contrasted with victimization reports rather than
measures of crime perceptions. We should note that this finding is consistent
with the work of Worrall (2006), suggesting that future work incorporating
perceptual incivilities measures should also incorporate measures of crime that
include victimization reports.
Conclusions
Overall, the pattern of results discussed above suggests that the answer to the
question, "Do measures of perceived incivilities have discriminant validity
relative to measures of perceived crime," depends on just what we mean by
perceived incivilities and perceived crime. To the extent to which these
measures tend to overlap conceptually, we may anticipate that they will also
lack discriminant validity. This is illustrated in our data by the fighting/arguing
indicator of social incivilities and of respondents' perceptions of the prevalence
of assault. Conversely, we may anticipate that conceptually distinct measures
may provide stronger evidence for discriminant validity.
What is used as an indicator of incivilities and what is used as an indicator of
crime is a particularly nuanced issue among theories specifying a relationship
between incivilities and crime. In what is perhaps the foremost of these theo-
ries, Wilson and Kelling (1982, 2006) argue that incivilities include pubic order
crimes such as drug dealing and prostitution can lead to more serious crime.
Wilson and Kelling go so far as to specify that robbery is the crime that should
be most influenced by variation in incivilities. If this is the case we should antic-
ipate that incivilities and robbery, though related, should enjoy discriminant
validity relative to each other. Indeed our analysis provides some evidence that
this is indeed the case (see factor loadings for robbery Table 3).
302 ARMSTRONG AND KATZ
Wilson and Kelling (1982, 2006) also allow that perceived incivilities may
influence other forms of serious crime including burglary/breaking and enter-
ing. Results from exploratory factor analysis and those of Worrall (2006) suggest
that respondents are able to distinguish between perceptions of burglary and
breaking entering and perceptions of incivilities. These results, in contrast with
results showing respondents have a difficult time distinguishing other measures
of crime from perceptions of incivilities, underscore the extent to which the
discriminant validity of perceptions of incivilities relative to perceptions of
crime depends heavily on what are included as indicators of crime and what are
included as indicators of incivilities. This variability in turn underscores
the need to further assess the extent to which we can use exploratory factor
analysis to inform confirmatory factor analyses.
When we use exploratory factor analyses to inform confirmatory factor
analysis, perceived crime measures with factor loadings inconsistent with
discriminant validity are dropped when we estimate confirmatory factor analy-
sis models. Such an analysis moves beyond testing the discriminant validity of
existing sets of indictors of crime perceptions and perceptions of incivilities, in
an attempt to develop guidance regarding the creation of measures that actu-
ally have discriminant validity.
Recently scholars have called into question the discriminant validity of
measure of perceived incivilities (Sampson & Raudenbush, 1999; Taylor, 1999).
While far from closing the question, results to date suggest respondents'
perceptions of physical incivilities are distinct from their reports of victimiza-
tion. Results regarding the extent to which respondents are able to distinguish
between social incivilities and victimization reports and between incivilities in
general and crime are far less conclusive.
Exploratory factor analyses presented here and in the work of Worrall (2006)
show that the relationship between perceptions of incivilities and perceptions
of crime varies across different crime types. Further, analyses presented here
provide modest evidence for the discriminant validity of incivilities measures
relative to particular types of crime. Future research should employ additional
confirmatory factor analyses outlined above in an attempt to determine
whether or not more conclusive evidence for the discriminant validity of
perceptions of incivilities relative to perceptions of crime may be developed.
