Psychiatric Correlates of Gambling
in Adolescents and Young Adults
Grouped by Age at Gambling Onset
Wendy J. Lynch, PhD; Paul K. Maciejewski, PhD; Marc N. Potenza, MD, PhD
Background: Gambling is a prevalent behavior, yet few
studies have investigated its mental health correlates. Al-
though early-onset engagement in behaviors with addic-
tive potential has generally been associated with more
severe problems, direct investigation of a nationally rep-
resentative sample of gamblers grouped by age at onset
of gambling has not been performed.
Objective: To identify differences in psychiatric corre-
lates of gambling and gambling-related attitudes and be-
haviors in adolescents (aged 16-17 years) and in young
adults (aged 18-29 years) with early-onset (before age 18
years) and adult-onset gambling.
Design: Logistic regression analysis.
Setting: Public access data set derived from random-
digit-dialing telephone surveys.
Patients: The study analyzed data from adolescent
(n=235), early-onset adult (n=151), and adult-onset
(n=204) past-year gamblers and adolescent (n=299) and
adult (n=187) nongamblers in the Gambling Impact and
Behavior Study.
Main Outcome Measures: Gamblers and nongam-
blers were compared within each group on measures of
sociodemographics and psychiatric health. Adolescent,
early-onset adult, and adult-onset past-year gamblers were
compared on measures of gambling attitudes and behav-
iors.
Results: Adolescent gamblers were more likely than ado-
lescent nongamblers to report alcohol and drug use and
abuse/dependence and depression. Elevated rates of al-
cohol and drug use and abuse/dependence were ob-
served in early-onset adult gamblers vs adult nongam-
blers, and only elevated rates of alcohol use were observed
in adult-onset gamblers vs adult nongamblers. Substan-
tial differences in reasons for and patterns of gambling
were observed among the 3 groups of gamblers.
Conclusions: Adolescent-onset gambling is associated
with more severe psychiatric problems, particularly sub-
stance use disorders, in adolescents and young adults.
More research is needed to investigate the relationships
and inform prevention and treatment strategies.

ACCESS TO GAMBLING HAS
increased dramatically in
the past several decades.1
Approximately 68% of the
US adult population has
gambledlegallyinthepastyear.2 Although
mostadultsgamblewithoutapparentprob-
lems,approximately9millionareclassified
asproblemgamblersandanother3million
as pathological gamblers.3 Adult problem
and pathological gambling are associated
with substance use problems, depression,
psychiatrictreatment,poorsubjectivegen-
eral health, arrest, and incarceration.1,4
Data suggest that adolescents may be
more vulnerable than adults to gambling-
related problems. Although gambling
among adolescents is largely illegal, 50% to
90% of youths aged 12 to 17 years report
gambling within the past year.5 These high
rates underscore the need to investigate the
psychiatric correlates and social conse-
quences of adolescent gambling. Surveys
have consistently found high rates of at-
risk,problem,andpathologicalgamblingin
adolescents.6 Regional surveys7-12 have re-
vealed that heavy or disordered gambling
in adolescents is associated with adverse
health and social consequences, including
substance use/abuse and depression.
Adverse consequences associated with
adolescentgamblingmaypersistintoadult-
hood. Retrospective studies12,13 of adult
problem and pathological gamblers reveal
that age at gambling onset is typically be-
fore adulthood. The extent to which early
onset of gambling is associated with more
severe gambling problems, as has been sug-
gested for substance use disorders, has not
been adequately studied (eg, in longitudi-

onset of gambling is associated with more severe gam-
bling problems.2,13 Most studies of adult gamblers do not
assess differences related to age at gambling onset. Given
that there exist age-at-onset and treatment-related differ-
ences in the characteristics of individuals with alcohol de-
pendence,14 a disorder frequently co-occurring with patho-
logical gambling15 and linked at a genetic level,16 further
examination of the effect of age at gambling onset on adult
gambling and substance use behaviors is warranted.
Few studies have directly compared adolescent gam-
blers with adult gamblers, particularly on a national level.
Criteria used to define disordered gambling frequently
vary between studies, and they are generally less strin-
gent in studies of adolescents, complicating compari-
sons of gambling in adolescents and adults.5,6 The 1998
Gambling Impact and Behavior Study (GIBS) surveyed
adults and adolescents to examine their gambling atti-
tudes and behaviors. The present study sought to inves-
tigate the characteristics of adolescent (aged 16-17 years)
and young adult (aged 18-29 years) past-year gamblers
on measures of psychiatric health and gambling. The
young adult group of gamblers was separated into early-
onset (gambling onset at age 18 years) and adult-
onset (gambling onset at age 18 years) groups. We hy-
pothesized that (1) each group of gamblers would report
more psychiatric problems than nongamblers, (2) ado-
lescent and early-onset gambling would show stronger
associations with adverse measures of psychiatric health
compared with adult-onset gambling, and (3) adoles-
cent, early-onset adult, and adult-onset gamblers would
differ on reasons for and patterns of gambling, with ado-
lescent and early-onset adult gamblers demonstrating
greatergamblingseverity(higherquantity/frequency)than
adult-onset gamblers.
METHODS
SAMPLE
Data analyzed were obtained from the GIBS, a national US ci-
vilian household survey conducted by the National Opinion
Research Center (NORC). The goal of the GIBS was to exam-
ine the impact of gambling in the United States.17,18 Partici-
pants were interviewed through the use of random-digit-
dialing (RDD) surveys (534 adolescents and 2417 adults) and
face-to-face interviews at selected gambling venues (530 adults
only). Because face-to-face interviews were not conducted with
adolescent gamblers and different questionnaires were used for
the gambling venue and RDD adult samples, only data from
the RDD surveys were analyzed in the present study.
Data for the adult RDD survey were obtained using a list-
assisted approach and one-plus sampling (selecting from banks
of 100 telephone numbers with at least 1 listed telephone num-
ber), as is typical for the NORC, and they are described else-
where.17 Telephone numbers purchased from Survey Sampling
International (Fairfield, Conn) were stratified by state lottery sta-
tus, and working residential telephone numbers were identified
in part through screening by Survey Sampling International.17
The individual interviewed from the contacted household was
determined via a variant of the Troldahl/Carter/Bryant method.17
The adolescent population screened in the GIBS consisted
of 16- and 17-year-olds, a population representing less than 7%
of US households. In an effort to increase access to this popu-
lation, adolescents were recruited using not only the RDD tele-
phone lists like those used for adults17-19 but also "enriched"
lists that had a higher probability of providing access to ado-
lescents.17,18 Screening of adolescents required consent from the
adolescent's parent or guardian and the adolescent.
The adolescent and adult RDD samples were weighted to
be representative of the US population for 16- and 17-year-old
adolescents and adults 18 years and older, respectively. The
weighting procedure has been described previously for ado-
lescent17,18 and adult17-19 populations (see http://cloud9.norc
.uchicago.edu/dlib/ngis.htm). Sample weights for the adoles-
cent and adult RDD samples were scaled to sum to the actual
sample sizes for these surveys (534 adolescents and 2417 adults),
and sample sizes reported refer to sums of sample weights.
Studies involving analysis of publicly accessible GIBS data
were presented to the Yale Human Investigations Committee
and were exempted from review. Only participants aged 16 to
29 years, inclusive, were studied to minimize recall bias with
respect to age at gambling onset and confounding of cohort ef-
fects. Participants were categorized by age (16-17 vs 18-29 years),
past-year gambling status (yes vs no), and age at gambling on-
set (18 years vs 18 years) to form 5 groups: adolescent gam-
blers (n=235), adolescent nongamblers (n=299), early-onset
adult gamblers (n=151), adult-onset gamblers (n=204), and
adult nongamblers (n=187). Past-year gambling was defined
as "placing a bet [during the past 12 months] on the outcome
of a race or game of skill or chance, or playing a game--
including for charity--in which one might win or lose money."17
Data from individuals missing data on gambling status (n=13
adults) and adults missing data on age at gambling onset (n=7
adults) were excluded from analyses. Sample weights were ad-
justed for individuals included in the analyses.
MEASURES
Variables were derived from questions in the GIBS,17,18 as de-
scribed previously.20 Alcohol and drug use and abuse/
dependence measures were based on DSM-IV criteria as imple-
mented in the National Household Survey on Drug Abuse.17
Past-year alcohol use was defined as use of alcohol at least once
or twice per month for a minimum of 12 days in the past year.
Past-year drug use was defined as use of an illicit drug for a
minimum of 5 days in the past year. Respondents needed to
meet a threshold criterion of use of a substance (not including
nicotine or caffeine) for nonmedical purposes on at least 5 days
in the previous year to be asked follow-up questions that as-
sess DSM-IV criteria for abuse/dependence (eg, questions about
tolerance, withdrawal, and adverse physical or social effects of
use). Substance abuse/dependence variables assessed abuse/
dependence of alcohol; marijuana and hashish; cocaine and
crack; stimulants such as methamphetamine, amphetamines,
and speed for nonmedical reasons; and tranquilizers such as
diazepam and alprazolam for nonmedical reasons.
TwoscreeningquestionsfromtheDiagnosticInterviewSched-
ule measured depression, assessing a lifetime history of 2 weeks
when the respondent either felt sad, empty, and depressed all
the time or lost interest in most things previously found enjoy-
able. As with drug and alcohol use measures, screening ques-
tions were designed to capture most respondents with a history
of major depression while minimizing respondent burden.
Most gambling measures (reasons for gambling, age at gam-
bling onset, and quantity/frequency measures) were adapted di-
rectly from the GIBS.17,19 At-risk or problem gambling was de-
fined as a lifetime NORC Diagnostic Screen score of 1 or more
DSM-IV inclusionary criteria for pathological gambling. Al-
though large-scale, population-based psychometric tests of the

bling were grouped into categories of strategic, nonstrategic, ma-
chine, casino, and noncasino, as described previously.19,20
DATA ANALYSIS
Adolescent, early-onset adult, and adult-onset past-year gam-
blers were compared with similarly aged nongamblers on so-
ciodemographic and psychiatric measures. Some sociodemo-
graphic variables were not included in the analysis for adolescent
gamblers because they were judged to be of limited heteroge-
neity (age, marital status, and employment) or reliability (house-
hold income). A logistic regression procedure implemented in
SAS (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) was used to determine odds
ratios (ORs) adjusted for between-group differences as fol-
lows. Odds ratios associated with past-year alcohol use and
abuse/dependence, past-year drug use and abuse/dependence,
any past-year substance abuse, and lifetime depression were ad-
justed for sociodemographic factors. Adolescent, early-onset
adult, and adult-onset past-year gamblers were compared on
gambling measures. Odds ratios corresponding to gambling mea-
sures were adjusted for sociodemographic variables, past-year
substance abuse/dependence, and lifetime depression.
RESULTS
SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS
Compared with adolescent nongamblers, adolescent past-
year gamblers were more likely to be Hispanic and less
likely to be girls (Table 1). Compared with adult non-
gamblers, early-onset adult past-year gamblers were more
likely to never have been married and less likely to be
women, to earn less than $24000 annually, and to ac-
knowledge nonwhite race/ethnicity. Adult-onset gam-
blers were less likely than adult nongamblers to be Af-
rican American, to report less than full-time employment,
and to earn less than $24000 annually.
PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH
All groups of gamblers were more likely than nongam-
blers to report past-year alcohol use (Table 2). Adoles-
cent gamblers and early-onset adult gamblers compared
with adolescent and adult nongamblers, respectively, were
more likely to report past-year alcohol abuse/depen-

stance abuse/dependence. Adolescent gamblers were more
likely than adolescent nongamblers to report lifetime de-
pression. Relationships between psychiatric health mea-
sures and gambling status for adolescent gambling com-
pared with those for adult-onset gambling (ie, [adolescent
gamblers vs adolescent nongamblers] vs [adult-onset gam-
blers vs adult nongamblers]) were significant for alco-
hol abuse/dependence (adjusted OR, 4.39; P  .001), drug
abuse/dependence (adjusted OR, 4.96; P=.01), and sub-
stance abuse/dependence (adjusted OR, 3.01; P=.01). Re-
lationships between psychiatric health measures and gam-
bling status for early-onset adult gambling compared with
those for adult-onset gambling (ie, [early-onset adult gam-
blers vs adult nongamblers] vs [adult-onset gamblers vs
adult nongamblers]) were significant for alcohol use (ad-
justed OR, 1.73; P=.01), alcohol abuse/dependence (ad-
justed OR, 3.43; P.001), drug use (adjusted OR, 4.02;
P.001), drug abuse/dependence (adjusted OR, 4.39;
P.001), and substance abuse/dependence (adjusted OR,
3.25; P.001). There were no such differences in rela-
tionships between psychiatric health measures and gam-
bling status for adolescent gambling compared with those
for early-onset adult gambling.
GAMBLING ATTITUDES AND BEHAVIORS
Reasons for Gambling
Compared with both groups of adult gamblers, adoles-
cent gamblers were more likely to report gambling for
social reasons and less likely to report gambling for the
personal services received (ie, friendly or respectful treat-
ment from staff) or to win money (Table 3). Early-
onset adult gamblers were more likely than adult-onset
gamblers to gamble for excitement.
Patterns of Gambling
Compared with both groups of adult gamblers, adoles-
cent gamblers were more likely to usually gamble with
someone and less likely to experience large wins or losses
(Table 3). Adolescent gamblers were also less likely than
early-onset adult gamblers to gamble weekly or daily and
more likely than adult-onset gamblers to report at-risk
or problem gambling. Early-onset gamblers were more
likely than adult-onset gamblers to report usually gam-
bling with someone and largest wins of $100 or more.
Types of Gambling
Adolescent gamblers were less likely than both groups
of adult gamblers to report past-year nonstrategic,
machine, and casino gambling (Table 3). Adolescent
gamblers were more likely than adult-onset gamblers to
report past-year strategic gambling. Compared with
adult-onset gamblers, early-onset gamblers were more
likely to report past-year strategic and noncasino gam-
bling and less likely to report past-year casino gambling.
COMMENT
This study examined psychiatric health and gambling-
related attitudes and behaviors in adolescent, early-
onset adult, and adult-onset past-year gamblers using data
from younger age groups in a recent national survey. Al-
though gambling was associated with psychiatric prob-
lems (eg, substance abuse/dependence) in adolescents and
young adults, these relationships were largely confined
to the groups reporting an early age at gambling onset.
Between-group differences in reasons for and patterns of
gambling were observed, with some measures suggest-
ing that early-onset adult gamblers display heavier pat-
terns of gambling than do adult-onset gamblers. Taken
together, these results suggest that gambling during ado-
lescence may influence adult psychiatric functioning.
DEMOGRAPHICS
The finding that adolescent and early-onset adult past-
year gamblers were more likely than adolescent and adult
nongamblers, respectively, to be male is consistent with
findings from other studies21-23 of adolescent and young

adult gambling. A study23 of 21297 students in grades 8
to 12 in Vermont found male sex to be associated with
past-year gambling and past-year problem gambling. Data
suggest that of adult problem gamblers, women begin
gambling later in life, but once they begin gambling, they
develop gambling problems more rapidly than men.20,24
Thus, the findings suggest that gambling prevention in-
terventions that target youth groups should preferen-
tially focus on boys. However, given the sex-related dif-
ferences in adult gambling and problematic gambling
behaviors,20,24 more research is needed to investigate sex-
related differences in the characteristics of adolescent gam-
blers to inform youth gambling and adult problem gam-
bling prevention efforts.
PSYCHIATRIC HEALTH
Strong associations with alcohol and other drug use and
abuse/dependence were observed with gambling in ado-
lescent and early-onset adult gamblers, and these associa-
tionswere,exceptforalcoholuse,notobservedintheadult-
onset gamblers. In part, these findings may reflect aspects
of adolescent risk taking, decision making, and experien-
tial learning.25 Studies26 support the notion that risky be-
haviors (eg, drug use) often begin in adolescence, peak in
early adulthood, and diminish over time. Moreover, risky
behaviors often co-occur during adolescence.27 For ex-
ample, past-year gambling has been shown to be associ-
ated with alcohol consumption, tobacco smoking, drug
use, seat belt nonuse, aggressive behavior, and sexual ac-
tivity in adolescents.25,27 These findings not only suggest
that gambling and other risky behaviors be considered
within a neurodevelopmental framework,28 but they also
highlight the importance of age-appropriate public health
guidelines for gambling.29 The findings also suggest that
screening and treatment efforts for a variety of adolescent
riskbehaviors,includingthoseinvolvinggamblingandsub-
stanceuse,shouldbeintegrated.However,thepresentfind-
ing of a similar pattern of differences in psychiatric mea-
sures in the adolescent and early-onset adult gamblers
suggeststhattheseeffectsarenotdueexclusivelytoasimple
effect of age but rather are related to the onset of gam-
bling during or before adolescence.
Adolescent gamblers were more likely than adoles-
cent nongamblers to report lifetime depression. Depres-
sion has been reported15,29 in association with recre-
ational and problem or pathological gambling in adults.
As in studies of adults, the nature of the association be-
tween depressed mood and gambling in adolescents can-
not be easily discerned from association studies such as
the present investigation. The extent to which de-
pressed mood leads to increased gambling (eg, to es-
cape), gambling leads to depressed mood (eg, through
financial losses or other adverse consequences), or a mu-
tual factor leads to both (common environmental or ge-
netic factors) requires direct examination.
GAMBLING-RELATED ATTITUDES
AND BEHAVIORS
Adolescent and adult gamblers reported differences in mo-
tivations to gamble. Compared with adult gamblers, ado-
lescent gamblers more frequently acknowledged gam-
bling for social activity and less frequently for personal

services and to win money, and these differences may,
in part, reflect the types of gambling performed. Com-
pared with adult gamblers, few adolescent gamblers re-
ported casino gambling, a finding presumably reflecting
legal efforts to restrict adolescent casino gambling or de-
creased availability (eg, restricted or limited access to au-
tomobile transportation). Previous research22 suggests that
adolescent gambling is socially oriented, similar to sub-
stance use behaviors in adolescents. Adolescents more
frequently than adults acknowledge past-year gambling
in private settings (28.5% vs 11.0%) and report compa-
rable or lower rates of past-year gambling on other forms
of gambling.17 The importance adolescents place on so-
cializing during risk behaviors has implications for teen
gambling prevention strategies, for example, money may
not represent the major motivating factor for adolescent
gambling. As such, prevention efforts that focus on in-
creasing the availability of nongambling social activities
warrant consideration.
Compared with adults, adolescents less frequently ac-
knowledge large wins or losses. These differences may
largely reflect the financial situation of adolescents, who
generally earn much less than adults. The high rates of
at-risk and problem gambling in adolescents despite low
quantity/frequency measures warrant notice. Because the
most widely used screen for adult problem gambling, the
South Oaks Gambling Screen,31 heavily scores items re-
lated to finances (ie, debt), more research is needed into
the suitability of specific measures for identifying ado-
lescents with gambling problems.

forboththeadolescentandearly-onsetadultgroupsofgam-
blers, an element of competitive risk taking seems to exert
a stronger influence on the reasons for gambling and the
types of gambling performed. Adult-onset gamblers were
least likely to report usually gambling with someone, sug-
gesting that the social element present in adolescent gam-
bling persists for adult gamblers who began gambling dur-
ing adolescence. As with the alcohol and drug abuse/
dependence measures, the most pronounced differences in
rates of at-risk and problem gambling and strategic and ca-
sino gambling variables were observed in the compari-
sons between adolescent and adult-onset gamblers. Early-
onset adult gamblers differed from adult-onset gamblers
on the measure of large wins, which suggests that early on-
set may be associated with "heavier gambling," similar to
previous research2,13 demonstrating an association be-
tween age at gambling onset and gambling severity. Con-
sistent with this notion, early-onset gamblers were more
likely than adult-onset gamblers to report high-frequency
gambling (at least weekly; OR, 1.72), although this differ-
ence did not reach statistical significance.
CONCLUSIONS
This study is the first, to our knowledge, to compare ado-
lescent, early-onset adult, and adult-onset gamblers sys-
tematically on measures of psychiatric health and gam-
bling-related attitudes and behaviors. The strengths of
the study include a representative sample of the US popu-
lation acquired through an RDD method using a struc-
tured interview. One limitation involves the psychiatric
health measures. These measures were limited to depres-
sion and alcohol and drug use and abuse/dependence and
were assessed by a limited number of questions. These
questions did not include complete diagnostic criteria,
a limitation in part mitigated by incorporation of diag-
nostic criteria into the survey questions, following the
precedent of other national surveys.17,32 Another limita-
tion involves survey differences, particularly in the screen-
ing process for gambling pathology. The adolescent and
adult surveys were conducted separately, introducing the
possibility of selection bias, and the screening measures
used differed. All adolescents who had ever gambled were
asked the NORC Diagnostic Screen; in contrast, only
adults who acknowledged ever losing $100 or more in a
year were surveyed on the NORC Diagnostic Screen. This
difference may contribute to lower levels of at-risk and
problem gambling in the adult population. The use of
the age of 18 years to distinguish adolescents and adults
has pros and cons because states vary regarding ages at
which specific forms of gambling become legal. How-
ever, 18 years is generally the youngest age at which in-
dividuals may gamble legally. Other limitations include
use of a small sample size relative to statewide surveys
and limitations inherent to cross-sectional surveys in gen-
eral, including the potential for recall bias, cohort ef-
fects, differences in respondents' interpretations of ques-
tions, and the inability to discern cause and effect in the
observed associations. Attempts were made to mini-
mize the effect of recall bias and cohort effects by study-
ing a narrowly defined age group of young adults (aged
18-29 years). The findings of differences in adolescent
and early-onset adult gambling compared with adult-
onset gambling in relation to measures of psychiatric
health, and of differences in gambling attitudes and be-
haviors among groups of adolescent, early-onset adult,
and adult-onset gamblers, hold multiple implications for
youth gambling health guidelines and prevention and
treatment strategies. The observation that the associa-
tions of gambling with substance use and abuse/
dependence measures were most pronounced in groups
reporting early-onset gambling suggests that gambling
during adolescence may substantially impact adult func-
tion. These findings highlight the need for longitudinal
studies to examine the effect of gambling on younger age
groups, particularly as the availability and social accep-
tance of legalized gambling increases. Information gath-
ered from such studies could be of great value in gener-
ating health guidelines for gambling in adolescents and
adults.
