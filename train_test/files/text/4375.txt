Introduction
Several studies have found that the pace of life in cities is much
fasterthaninlesspopulatedareas.Inaclassicalstudy,Bornstein
and Bornstein (1976) found that the rate of pedestrian locomo-
tion varies in a regular fashion with the size of the local popula-
tion, regardless of cultural setting. Levine and Norenzayan
(1999) studied how pace of life measures such as the work
speed among postal clerks and accuracy of bank clocks varied
between countries and which attributes of a location's "person-
ality" (including population and population density) were cor-
related. Such findings demonstrate that lifestyle differs
qualitatively and quantitatively in different locations according
to the nature of the place. Moreover, as Gieryn (2000) argues,
"we make places," an allusion to our social construction of
place--partially mediated by architecture and design.
Bettencourt, Lobo, Helbing, Kühnert, and West (2007)
more recently considered macroscopic quantities that are
indicators of the creation of wealth and of new ideas as func-
tions of city population size. These indicators include new
patents, inventors, private R&D employment, "super-cre-
ative" employment, R&D establishments, R&D employment,
total wages, total bank deposits, gross domestic product
(GDP), total electrical consumption, new AIDS cases, and
serious crime. All were found to grow superlinearly with city
population, and mathematical models of social interactions
have been proposed to explain these findings (Bettencourt,
2013; Bettencourt et al., 2007; Pan, Ghoshal, Krumme,
Cebrian, & Pentland, 2013). However, measures of city infra-
structure such as number of gasoline stations and road surface
area grow sublinearly with city population, indicating econo-
mies of scale (Bettencourt et al., 2007).
Beyond productivity and innovation measures, one may
also consider other sociological indicators of city personality
such as prosocial behaviors that promote social well-being,
including volunteering, giving money, donating blood, or vot-
ing. Arbesman and Christakis (2011) found that whereas
political contribution rates and volumes increase per capita
with city population (like productivity and innovation), vot-
ing rates and organ donation rates do not seem to change with
city size, and census return rates decrease per capita. If the
amount of effort to add another person to a population requires
less prosocial effort--by the person or by the collective--
than the previous person, then one might expect prosocial
behavior to decrease per capita. Arbesman and Christakis
(2011) suggest that whether a given behavior scales superlin-
early, linearly, or sublinearly may depend on whether a behav-
ior is limited to interacting with nearby individuals or allows

Pace of Life in Cities and the
Emergence of Town Tweeters
Alexander Jones Gross1, Dhiraj Murthy2, and Lav R. Varshney3
Abstract
Long-standing results in urban studies have shown correlation of population and population density to a city's pace of life,
empirically tested by examining whether individuals in bigger cities walk faster, spend less time buying stamps, or make greater
numbers of telephone calls. Contemporary social media presents a new opportunity to test these hypotheses. This study
examines whether users of the social media platform Twitter in larger and denser American cities tweet at a faster rate than
their counterparts in smaller and sparser ones. Contrary to how telephony usage and productivity scale superlinearly with city
population, the total volume of tweets in cities scales sublinearly. This is similar to the economies of scale in city infrastructures
like gas stations. When looking at individuals, however, greater population density is associated with faster tweeting. The
discrepancy between the ecological correlation and individual behavior is resolved by noting that larger cities have sublinear
growth in the number of active Twitter users. This suggests that there is a more concentrated core of more active users that
may serve an information broadcast function for larger cities, an emerging group of "town tweeters" as it were.

interaction with anyone and whether a behavior has positive
or negative feedback in the sense one person's actions make
another's actions more or less likely.
With the emergence of computational social science
(Lazer et al., 2009), there are opportunities to consider larger
data sets of social interaction at finer levels (Chang,
Kauffman, & Kwon, 2014). For example, billions of tele-
phone call records were used to determine the scaling of call
volume, number of calls, and number of connections with
city population size, finding growth faster than linear
(Schläpfer et al., 2014). Twitter provides an opportunity to
examine whether there is variation in the pace of life across
cities through metrics derived from social media data at the
microscopic level, a method generally found to be lacking in
the social sciences (Burrows & Savage, 2014).
The social media platform Twitter allows users to share
messages restricted to 280 characters--tweets--among an
ecosystem of over 300 million monthly active users (Twitter,
2017). As a highly active marketplace of virtually mediated
communication and ideas, particularly from 2010 to 2013,
Twitter has drawn the interest of social science researchers as
both a subject of study in itself as well as a rich qualitative
and quantitative data source to discern microsocial and mac-
rosocial, economic, political, and health interactions (e.g.,
Arceneaux & Schmitz Weiss, 2010; Burrows & Savage,
2014; Chen, 2011; Chunara, Andrews, & Brownstein, 2012;
Golder & Macy, 2011; Hutchins, 2011; Lassen & Brown,
2011). Twitter has faced monetization and user adoption
issues recently (Lynley, 2017), but the data we have collected
and analyzed are from 2012, which many argue was the hey-
day of Twitter as a platform for mass information exchange
and represents the platform's run up to its 2013 initial public
offering. Ultimately, Twitter at that time was a good represen-
tative of general social media phenomena (see, for example,
Buettner & Buettner, 2016; Murthy, 2013; Olteanu, 2016).
Our research seeks to explore and identify tweeting trends
across cities by examining the behaviors of individuals
within them. The goal is to identify characteristics of social
media behavior and usage patterns that are connected with
population. We aim to understand whether social-psycholog-
ical and community characteristics of cities identified in
classical pace of life studies manifest themselves in virtual
environments. Twitter provides detailed data regarding usage
behavior that enables meaningful data-driven analysis. The
study presented herein is based on a collection of tweets
tagged with geo-data from 50 American cities. Our research
begins to understand some of the complex dynamics of
Twitter use in urban America. One may wonder whether
Twitter, a service for technological intermediation, is
delinked from geography and so notions of physical place
like user city are irrelevant to behavior (Takhteyev, Gruzd, &
Wellman, 2012). Moreover, drawing from previous work
which found evidence of more frequent log ins to social
media among rural rather than urban users (Gilbert,
Karahalios, & Sandvig, 2010), we hypothesize the opposite.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): The physical phenomenon of pace of
life in cities manifests in tweeting behavior.
As we will show, although a smaller fraction of the popula-
tion tweets in larger cities, this core of tweeters has a faster
pace. In some sense, these active tweeters may act as an
information broadcast infrastructure for their city, an emerg-
ing social group of "town tweeters" analogous to historical
town criers. Others have argued that local community-based
services including support of "local products and educational
awareness" and pace of life may be linked (Mayer & Knox,
2009). Given the possibility of Twitter serving as an informa-
tion broadcast infrastructure for cities, we make a further
hypothesis on aggregate Twitter usage in cities as a function
of population.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): Aggregate tweet volume scales sub-
linearly with city population, according to a power law.
Our research validates this hypothesis. As population grows,
tweet volume does not increase linearly. Unlike productivity,
innovation, or mobile telephony measures, our findings are
reminiscent of infrastructure scaling (Um, Son, Lee, Jeong,
& Kim, 2009) like the number of gas stations or certain pro-
social behaviors such as census return rates. We further
refine this in H3 as follows.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Deviations from a power-law scaling
can be explained, in part, by aspects of city demographics,
culture, and/or personality.
The temporal tweeting behavior of regularly active individu-
als in urban America, whom we term town tweeters, could be
affected by socioeconomic and other aspects of a city. As
Shah, Kwak, and Holbert (2001) suggest, new media use is
not homogeneous and seeks to "satisfy different goals, result-
ing in varied patterns of effects" (p. 142). Indeed, Barabási
(2005) has suggested that most observable social, techno-
logical, and economic phenomena are driven by the dynam-
ics and interactions of individual actions and has provided a
mathematical model that generates experimentally observed
bursty, heavy-tailed statistics of such human activity. Others
have previously observed the burstiness of tweeting
(Chalmers, Fleming, Wakeman, & Watson, 2011) and related
social media activity (Zhao & Zhou, 2012). In particular, we
hypothesize a power-law distribution for the distribution of
intervals between tweets for individual users.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): The distribution of intervals between
tweets for individual town tweeters is well-described by a
power law.
Using formal statistical methods (Clauset, Shalizi, &
Newman, 2009), we falsify this hypothesis and find that
power-law behavior is not the best description of observed
Gross et al. 3
data. Rather, other parametric forms which have finite mean
for interevent intervals provide a better fit to data. The power
law with exponential cutoff distribution and other distribu-
tions typically provide satisfactory fits, rather than power
law. These distributions have finite mean but also suggest
tweeting is a bursty activity, which echoes previous work
that finds topics in Twitter bursty (Diao, Jiang, Zhu, & Lim,
2012) as well as posting of tweets (Raghavan, Ver Steeg,
Galstyan, & Tartakovsky, 2014).
The actions and interactions of individuals are often said
to generate city-level phenomena (Arbesman & Christakis,
2011; Bettencourt, 2013; Bettencourt et al., 2007; Pan et al.,
2013), such as the sublinear scaling of tweet volume with
city size that we observed. As we have access to Twitter data
at the individual level, we are able to investigate the relation-
ship between tweeting behavior of individual users and a
population-centric notion of how they experience their city
environment, informing our next hypothesis.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): The time between tweets for indi-
vidual users decreases as a function of their city's popula-
tion density.
We verify this hypothesis. The effect is weak but strongly
significant statistically. This indicates that individuals in
denser cities tweet more frequently, which may seem con-
trary to the infrastructure-like tweet volume scaling we had
observed. To explain this apparent contradiction between
individual behavior and the ecological correlation, we make
the following hypothesis on the number of people who tweet.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): A reduced number of people tweet in
larger cities.
Contrary to telephony, which is point-to-point, Twitter has
been designed to facilitate multicasting: the broadcasting of
many to many (Murthy, 2013). Since people have limited time
(Aral & Van Alstyne, 2011) and must allocate it to various
activities that may be substitute goods with tweeting rather
than complementary goods (Miritello et al., 2013), the general
increase in pace of life in larger cities may, counterintuitively,
inhibit participation by larger fractions of the population.
Time, Pace of Life, and Town Criers
Time and Pace of Life
Time has been important to classical social scientific work
and has been studied by Simmel (1950), Durkheim (2004),
and Weber (Segre, 2000). Though Weber did not have a spe-
cific theory of time, he did observe how pace was socially
constructed (Segre, 2000). For example, Segre (2000)
describes how Weber saw factory workers change their pace
based on solidarity with fellow workers or changes in institu-
tional regulation. Unsurprisingly, scarcity of time in urban
Western centers is correlated with pace of life (Garhammer,
2002). Simmel (1950) viewed the metropolis as having a
constant flow of strangers. City life, from his perspective,
breeds a rhythm of life which fosters detachment (Simmel,
1950). Veblen argued that constructions of time are associ-
ated with social structure (Southerton & Tomlinson, 2005).
Societally, gauging pace of life remains important as "being
busy is symbolic of a `full' and `valued' life" in many cul-
tures (Southerton & Tomlinson, 2005, p. 219). Durkheim
famously argued that "Every disturbance of equilibrium,
even though it may involve greater comfort and a raising of
the general pace of life, provides an impulse to voluntary
death" (Durkheim, 2004, p. 99). Ultimately, the notion of
pace of life is a fundamental social question.
Indeed, Chicago School sociologist Robert E. Park (1929)
classically measured urbanization by newspaper circulation.
Park argues that "culture, since it is based firmly on communi-
cation, is always more or less a local phenomenon." Park's
thesis is that towns and villages were losing their "independent
character" and becoming "satellites of the cities." We are more
interested in sublinear versus superlinear distributions rather
than "independent character." However, Park's argument that
communication is local is important. Specifically, Simmel
emphasizes locality when he argues that "The City is not a
spatial entity with social consequences, but a sociological
entity that is formed spatially" (Simmel, Featherstone, &
Frisby, 1997). Of course, this formation of the urban spatially
isalsoaffectedbylocalizedsocialcommunication.Historically,
places such as community clubs and neighborhood centers, for
example, served this purpose (Guest & Oropesa, 1984).
Town Criers and Information Flow
Even with the pervasiveness of information flow in Twitter,
we retain the need for some anchored locality in the city,
even if that is relatively vague and blurred. With previous
states of relatively sparse information, the town crier quietly
died and disappeared from our cognitive space, replaced by
broadcast media. Though the current state of surplus infor-
mation has not resurrected the town crier as such, an oppor-
tunity for core groups of criers to virtually ring the bell and
make proclamations has emerged as audiences appreciate a
crier making noise over the rest of the crowd.
Hoshikawa (1994) argues that mass communication
media has led to a "deterioration" away from the "commu-
nity bell and town crier." The town crier has been globally
resurrected for ceremony. For example, Tony Appleton, town
crier from Romford, proclaimed "Oyez, Oyez . . . the first-
born of their royal highness, the Duke and Duchess of
Cambridge" (Wright, 2013) at the birth of Prince George on
July 22, 2013. In a state of information plenitude, the crier
can provide a direct cognitive hook, as can be seen in
Appleton's case. Furthermore, the town crier has an almost
haptic role, allowing us to be closer and perhaps touch and
feel the news via its embodiment in the crier.
4 SAGE Open
MacDougall (2011) argues that "the tradition of the town
crier" has a "phenomenological feel" which can be seen in
modern broadcast forms such as podcasting. Murdoch (2010)
has also drawn a line between the town crier and bloggers,
tracing an evolution of journalism. Twitter continues in this
line. Miragliotta (2012) argues that Twitter is important to
the political public sphere; Bruns, Burgess, Highfield,
Kirchhoff, and Nicolai (2011) conceive Twitter as part of a
networked public sphere; and Ausserhofer and Maireder
(2013) conceptualize a "national public Twittersphere."
Ultimately, the medium exhibits pace of life as well as
notions of localized public life.
In terms of the latter, some aspects of urban life have been
found to foster perceptions of anonymity and disassociation.
New social media technologies may be encouraging geo-
graphically based connections. In the context of larger urban
studies debates, this sheds light on the argument that the
place itself matters and local information from the place
therefore should be communicated. Studies of influence and
Twitter tend to measure influencers, "alpha users," by exam-
ining the most followed or mentioned users at the national or
international level (e.g.,Anger & Kittl, 2011). However, very
active local Twitter users may be affirming dynamics of
localized public life, ringing a bell like Appleton to draw in
those in the local area to protests, people's assemblies, or to
read relevant local news stories.
The Importance of Twitter to Urban Life
Twitter has been important both in shaping articulations of
the urban but also influencing urban life socially, politi-
cally, and economically. This was seen in the Arab Spring
with the platform broadcasting images of Neda Agha-
Soltan dying in the streets of Tehran (Couldry, 2012, p. 26).
Social movements such as Black Lives Matter (BLM) have
used Twitter as a public sphere for youth of color (Carney,
2016), and previous work credited the platform as a key
means of communication by localized urban black stake-
holders (Freelon, Mcilwain, & Clark, 2016). Moreover, the
platform has been used to broadcast important "hyper-
local" urban news that does not generally cross to main-
stream outlets (Agarwal, Vaithiyanathan, Sharma, & Shroff,
2012). The medium has been used by major U.S. city gov-
ernments to engage with citizens (Mossberger, Wu, &
Crawford, 2013) and has been regularly used during disas-
ters in concentrated urban spaces (Kogan, Palen, &
Anderson, 2015). In urban spaces, where individuals are
not necessarily interacting with each other in specific com-
munity places, such as community centers, farmers mar-
kets, swap meets, or other local municipal spaces (Putnam,
2001), Twitter has been found to help facilitate a "net-
worked public" (Tierney, 2013). Moreover, in everyday
urban life, users produce and consume locally geotagged
tweets, which constitute "new ways of interacting with . . .
cities" (Shelton, Poorthuis, & Zook, 2015, p. 199).
Ultimately, the platform is viewed as fundamentally
important to urban life, given its historical utility in being an
event-driven space where a community does not have to be
consistent but can be formed around particular events, ad-
hoc issues, or happenings affecting an urban population.
Furthermore, Twitter use is part of larger processes involving
social technologies and the "socially conscious urban citi-
zen" (Foth, 2012, p. x) or, more playfully, through urban
flash mobs (Brejzek, 2010).
Technology to Mine Twitter
It has been said that "we have, in Big Data, a vast new natural
resource, as well as the means to mine it for value" (Rometty,
2013), and Twitter is one of the greatest such resources for
insight into human behavior. Unlike many other social media
services, Twitter provides a high level of access to its data.
Collecting small amounts of data is straightforward and can
be done via off-the-shelf free software, but collecting large
amounts of data is not. Twitter has licensed several third-
party organizations to provide serialized access to large
amounts of filtered Twitter data, including the possibility of
full access to the complete Twitter message stream, termed
"Firehose."
Data Model and Collection Framework
As per the recommendation of previous studies using geo-
tagged tweets (Cheng, Caverlee, Lee, & Sui, 2011; Cranshaw,
Schwartz, Hong, & Sadeh, 2012; Kamath, Caverlee, Lee, &
Cheng, 2013), we rely on the Twitter Streaming API (appli-
cation programming interface) to collect data. We collected
Twitter data from major U.S. cities. In particular, we com-
bined a list of the 45 U.S. cities with the most tweeting activ-
ity (Tweet Grader, 2012) with a list of the 50 most populated
cities (according to the 2010 U.S. census) and selected 50
cities to cover a range of population sizes and geographic
locations. Twitter allows specification of a set of unique
locations using latitude­longitude bounding boxes. We cre-
ated 10 individual collection scripts, each set to capture
tweets from five of the 50 selected cities. The distribution of
cities to scripts was guided by geographic location, popula-
tion, and expected tweet volume (see Appendix A). This dis-
tribution provides some robustness to any temporary outages
of collection scripts, as streams are designed to collect data
continuously over time. This framework allowed us to col-
lect between 400,000 and 1,000,000 tweets per day from
these cities. Data collected with each tweet include the time,
user's name, and Twitter handle, the application used to post
the tweet (web, Twitter for iPhone, Foursquare, etc.), loca-
tion, user profile at time of tweet, number of friends and fol-
lowers for the user, total number of tweets made by the user,
and the text of the tweet itself. We store this data in a tabular
data format (.csv) and analyze it using data analysis tools,
primarily MATLAB.
Gross et al. 5
Potential Limitations
Twitter-based research has innate limitations, and it is impor-
tant to be aware of how these limitations affect the quality
and robustness of the data collected. The Twitter API may
sometimes experience data outages. Furthermore, our local
collection database maintenance procedures required collec-
tion streams to stop for varying amounts of time. Twitter also
makes no guarantees or estimates on the volume of tweets it
will forward via Streaming data collection, only indicating
that users should always expect to receive less than 1% of all
tweets, and some fraction of tweets that match their query
dependent on the strength of the chosen query filters. Since
the process by which Twitter selects tweets to deliver on any
individual stream is proprietary, it introduces unknown
biases into the data. Our own experiments with a trial of the
complete Firehouse as well as the results of others (Kamath
et al., 2013), however, indicate that this sample is representa-
tive. There is also a potential procedural bias when using the
Twitter Location Stream as tweets are collected only from
users who use Twitter's geo-location service, which is an
opt-in feature. There are certain small but statistically sig-
nificant biases in the Twitter users that elect to report their
location (Graham, Hale, & Gaffney, 2014; Sloan & Morgan,
2015). Urban users often use geo-location-based apps such
as Foursquare (Cranshaw et al., 2012; Seeburger, Foth, &
Tjondronegoro, 2012), and there is greater rate of geocoding
among urban users than rural users (Hecht & Stephens, 2014;
Malik, Lamba, Nakos, & Pfeffer, 2015). Notably for our
study, it has been found that when controlling for other fac-
tors, population has no effect on the number of geotagging
users (Malik et al., 2015). Last, though query-based tweet
sampling rates scale with total tweets, they may be influ-
enced by factors such as tweeting frequency, retweet rates, or
other criteria within Twitter's API parameters.
Tweet Volume as a Function of City
Population
The first step in our study is to look at total tweet volume
in the various cities as a function of their population; we
used approximately 2.5 million tweets collected between
April and June of 2012. Using 2010 U.S. census data for
metropolitan statistical area population, Figure 1 illus-
trates the relationship between tweeting volume and city
population. Using least-squares regression, we find that
tweeting volume grows sublinearly as a function of city
population or, in other words, the per capita tweet volume
decreases with city population. In particular, the power-
law exponent from the least-squares fit is 0.952 (see
Appendix B for formulas for least-squares fit of power
law), which is between results for infrastructure indicators
such as length of electrical cables and household electrical
consumption in German cities, that have scaling exponents
0.87 and 1.00, respectively (Bettencourt et al., 2007), and
is similar to results for the prosocial behavior of census
return rates in American cities, with scaling exponent
0.988 (Arbesman & Christakis, 2011). These sublinear
scaling results are contrary to superlinear scaling results
for productivity, innovation, and telephony.
This result, by itself, validates H1 since it shows that
geography influences aggregate tweeting behavior of a city
population. It specifically validates H2.
Examining deviations from the scaling behavior provides
insight into the personality of cities (Bettencourt, Lobo,
Strumsky, & West, 2010; Garcia-Gavilanes, Quercia, &
Jaimes, 2013). Figure 2 plots the regression residuals (see
Appendix B for explanation of residuals). We observe that
Los Angeles has a significant positive deviation from the
power-law model. That is to say, there is more tweet volume
in Los Angeles than would be expected from the population-
based model. Other cities that deviate positively include San
Francisco, Las Vegas, Boston, Austin, and Atlanta. Cities
such as Washington, DC, Dallas, Tampa, Detroit, and Miami
deviate negatively from the power-law model. There are sev-
eral potential features of cities we can consider to explain
deviations from the power-law model.
One potential explanation for deviations could arise from
the role of media and entertainment in peoples' lives and
careers in a given city. It is plausible that cities with a strong
media focus may produce greater cultural relevance of
Twitter. Among our set of cities, New York, Los Angeles,
Chicago, San Francisco, and Boston have been deemed top
global media cities (Krätke, 2003). Technology adoption
rates may also be a factor in city personality: some of the
residuals may be explained by the time at which adoption of
Twitter achieved critical mass in the cities and the percentage
of users who were early adopters in the city (Toole, Cha, &
González, 2012).
Figure 1. Tweet volume as a function of city population size
in urban America. A power-law fit shows sublinear scaling, with
exponent 0.952.
6 SAGE Open
A third possibility is that Twitter usage in cities may be
influenced by demographic factors such as age, race, and
sex. In particular, survey results suggest that African
Americans tweet more often than others, and areas with large
percentages of African American residents tend to have
higher tweet volume (Smith & Brenner, 2012). Furthermore,
Twitter and other Internet-based social media platforms tend
to have disproportionately young user bases.Age of city resi-
dents might be another factor explaining deviations from the
observed relationship between tweet volume and population.
Women are more likely to be social media users (Perrin,
2015), ceteris paribus, and individuals who have a serious
interest in sports and entertainment are more likely to use
Twitter (Hargittai & Litt, 2011, 2012). In addition, it has
been suggested that Internet skill matters in Twitter adoption,
even after controlling for age, race, and sex (Hargittai & Litt,
2011, 2012).
Performing an ordinary linear least-squares regression
on the power-law residuals with the following explanatory
variables does in fact explain some of the variation: binary
indicator of global media city (Krätke, 2003); Twitter crit-
ical mass achievement time (Toole et al., 2012); fraction
of early adopters (Toole et al., 2012); age distribution in
city (fractions of under 5, 5-14, 15-24, 25-34, 35-44,
45-54, 55-64, 65-74, 75-84, and over 85); race distribu-
tion in city (White alone, Black or African American
alone, Asian alone, American Indian and Alaska Native
alone, and Native Hawaiian and Other Pacific Islander
alone); Hispanic or Latino origin percentage; and males
per 100 females. The age, race, and sex data for each met-
ropolitan statistical area are from the 2010 U.S. census. In
particular, the r2 value in the multivariate linear regression
using all 20 features listed above is .558. The full regres-
sion table is given in Table 1. Although all the features do
contribute, the most predictive feature in the presence of
all others is the fraction of early adopters in a city, whose
relationship to deviations from the power-law model is
shown in Figure 3(a)--more early adopters predict posi-
tive deviations. Thus, we have verified H3.
Figure 3(b) shows the relationship between the fraction of
a city population that is Black or African American only and
the deviations from the power-law model. Contrary to
national survey results (Smith & Brenner, 2012), once city
population is taken into account through the power-law
model, the tweet volume actually decreases as the fraction of
Black or African American population increases. This is
indicative of a "town tweeter" effect. These observations are
an ecological effect rather than an individual one. Figure 3(c)
shows the relationship for the fraction of young people (those
between the ages of 15 and 24 years). Here, the tweet volume
does increase as the fraction of young people increases, as
expected.
We have seen that aggregated tweet volume scales sublin-
early with city population. Moreover, much of the remaining
variation is explained by factors of city personality, such as
media centrality, technology adoption, and demographics. It

is important to note that tweet volume is an aggregate quan-
tity consisting of entire cities and their generated tweets.
Since our data are actually disaggregated to the individual
level, the next step of our study is to investigate the tweeting
dynamics of individual users in various cities.
Individual Tweet Dynamics
Returning to the roots of pace of life studies where the tem-
poral dynamics of individuals in cities are examined
(Bornstein & Bornstein, 1976), we now study the tweeting
behavior of individual urban users. This provides a comple-
mentary view to the city-wide aggregated phenomenon we
investigated in the previous section.
The temporal dynamics of various human activities have
previously been found to obey bursty, heavy-tailed statistics
for the time between events; models based on the prioritiza-
tion of human attention specifically generate power-law dis-
tributions for interevent times (Barabási, 2005; Walraevens,
Demoor, Maertens, & Bruneel, 2012). Specifically, the time
between tweets has previously been argued to be governed
by power-law distributions (Chalmers et al., 2011). Here, we
draw on formal statistical methods (Clauset et al., 2009) to
study the distribution of intervals between tweets for indi-
vidual users in urban America. Rather than looking at all 50
cities in our data, we focus on users in nine cities with a
range of populations and geographic locations: New York,
Chicago, Los Angeles, Orlando, Minneapolis, Austin,
Rochester, Louisville, and Boulder, as detailed in Table 2.
Though all tweets from a given user may not be collected,
we can use information about the number of tweets made by
a user to determine whether there were any uncollected
tweets during a given interval between two collected tweets.
For regularly active users, we have a fairly high number of
identified true consecutive tweets (around 50% on average).
For less active users, we see a lower percentage of observed
true interval tweets. Intervals in which there was exactly one
unobserved tweet are slightly longer than expected, and tri-
ple intervals are longer still. Shorter true intervals between
tweets may make them more likely to be observed, that is, we
may be collecting more tweets from regularly active users
than from users who tweet less often.
Intervals Between Tweets Analysis Methodology
We utilize a statistical methodology developed by Clauset
et al. (2009) to determine the statistical distribution of events
- here, the intertweet interval (ITI) of a given user. We con-
sider regularly active users, that is, users from whom we
have collected at least 200 total tweets, and select 16 users
for each city at random from this group; in Boulder, we con-
sider the 16 most active users since there were not enough
regularly active users. We further restrict our ITI sample to
data for true intervals rather than trying to infer ITI length
from recorded double intervals, triple intervals, and so on.
Following Chalmers et al. (2011), we considered whether
the ITI distribution of a given user is governed by power-law
statistics. A power-law distribution has two parameters: 
which represents how quickly the tail of the distribution
decays and xmin
which is a lower cutoff for data points that
defines where the power-law tail starts. The statistical meth-
odology tests empirical data against power-law distributions
with ranges of  and xmin
values, using the Kolmogorov­
Smirnov goodness-of-fit test to find the best fitting (, xmin
).
A significance test is then used to determine whether this
best fit is plausible for the empirical data. The same basic
methodology is used to find the best fits for other parametric
distributional forms and determine their plausibility. To com-
pare various possibilities that pass the significance test
above, we use log likelihood ratio (LLR) tests in a pairwise
manner to see which distribution is a closer fit to the observed
data. LLR tests yield two values: the LLR statistic and a p
value. The LLR statistic indicates which of the two models is
better, and the p value indicates the confidence in determin-
ing which is better. For each of the 144 users (16 users in
nine cities), we applied this method.
Intervals Between Tweets
Starting with our working hypothesis of power-law distribu-
tions, we find that it is plausible for 96% of the active users

to have power-law ITI behavior. However, the LLR tests
show that other distributions are more likely. In particular,
the majority of users have better fits with power-law with
exponential cutoff distributions, and others have better fits
with lognormal, Weibull, and Yule distributions. Results for
the 144 users are summarized in Table 3. Note that of the
users, 113 were individuals with more than 50 true intervals
and were determined not to be automated "bot" accounts.
Given the variety in distributional forms that are most
likely for the various regularly active users, there is no "typi-
cal" tweeting behavior, contrary to previous human dynam-
ics findings (Barabási, 2005; Chalmers et al., 2011). This
falsifies H4. Indeed, we find several natural groupings of
temporal tweeting behavior. The prominence of power law
with exponential cutoff and lognormal distributions, how-
ever, seems to indicate approximate power-law behavior
with thinning in the tail of the distribution. To understand
these dynamics further, we visually examine the empirical
ITI distributions and see whether the shape of user distribu-
tions might indicate natural groupings of similar users.
The first natural grouping of users includes those that
have power law with exponential cutoff forms, as shown in
Figure 4(a). One possible interpretation for this group is that
the underlying phenomenon is such that long gaps between
tweets become unlikely. An alternative explanation is that
biases in the capture of tweets may arise due to the finiteness
of the collection period and the large gaps in tweeting behav-
ior, causing reduced true tweet interval capture.
The second major grouping of users we observe have
good power-law fit in the head, followed by a significant
hump from the power-law line, and finishing with a cutoff
around the same location as many of the distributions from
the first grouping. Examples are shown in Figure 4(b). A
hump might arise due to periodic tweeting behavior. If a per-
son often tweets in the morning but then is unable to tweet
again until midday or evening and this behavior repeated
over the working week, a hump at 4- or 8-hr intervals would
arise. This is similar to the time it takes for someone to
respond to an e-mail or a phone call. The identification of
this pattern is significant as it signals a hybrid that is not a
fully Poison nor power-law distribution. Such bimodal distri-
butions have been found in various forms of human commu-
nication that has an "interplay between processes of different
time scales" (Wu, Zhou, Xiao, Kurths, & Schellnhuber,
2010). This also further emphasizes the importance of time
and gaps in time to understanding social media behaviors.
There is also a third grouping of ITI behavior which dif-
fers from power-law behavior, exhibiting strong periodicity
(as shown in Figure 4(c)). These types of users are generally
automated Twitter bots set to send certain messages at fixed
intervals. For example, Minneapolis User 12's tweet inter-
vals are very nearly either ~600 or ~1,200 s, with some small
variation. This corresponds to 10- and 20-min tweet inter-
vals. Indeed, this user is a bot programmed to tweet weather
updates every 10 min; the 20-min intervals may be the side
effect of the bot missing its regular tweeting time slot.

Disaggregating Tweet Volume
In the previous section, we saw that the tweeting behavior of
regularly active individual urban American Twitter users is
often well-modeled by distributions other than power law,
contrary to what we would expect based on the literature
(Barabási, 2005; Chalmers et al., 2011). Distributions such
as power law with exponential cutoff, lognormal, Weibull, or
Yule, unlike power law, have a finite first moment, which
justifies the use of the average ITI.
In this section, we look at relationships between mean ITI
and city characteristics such as population. To calculate
mean ITI for users, we find the first and last tweets for each
user with at least two tweets. The difference in timestamps
and the difference in total tweet count at the time of the
tweets yield the mean ITI for a given user. Note that the mean
ITI metric is unaffected by potential biases in per-user tweet
sampling rate or by problems of unobserved tweet intervals.
We can therefore consider a much larger pool of users. We
experimentally determined that for a 3-month collection

window, a 10-day observation envelope is sufficient to have
a significant number of users in each city, while controlling
the variance in user ITIs. We limited our analysis to users
who were observed to have tweeted at least twice and the
difference in time between their first and last observed tweets
was between 80 and 91 days.
In the "Tweet Volume as a Function of City Population" sec-
tion, we had looked at the aggregate volume of tweets for all
users in a city, as a function of city population. Some have
raised the issue of whether ecological fallacies (Robinson,
2009) are present in pace of life studies (Fleiss, 1990), espe-
cially when interpreting results for individuals. Previous stud-
ies only had access to aggregated behavioral statistics
(Arbesman & Christakis, 2011; Bettencourt, 2013; Bettencourt
et al., 2007; Bettencourt, Lobo, & West, 2008; Pan et al., 2013),
but our data can be disaggregated to the level of individual
behavior. In this section, we consider mean ITI at the individual
level. Furthermore, in this section, we first consider population
density, rather than population as in the "Tweet Volume as a
Function of City Population" section. This is because popula-
tion density is locally experienced by people, as compared with
population which is harder to experience. Note that Pan et al.
(2013) have developed a generative model for innovation and
productivity indicators in cities based on social interaction,
which is parameterized by population density.
Using metropolitan statistical area population density
data from the U.S. census, we look at the mean ITI for each
individual user. Figure 5 shows a standard linear regression
(despite being depicted on logarithmic axes using box plots),
which indicates that as the population density increases, the
mean ITI of an individual user decreases. In other words, the
denser a city, the more individuals tweet. This is an individ-
ual correlation rather than an aggregated ecological correla-
tion and is seemingly contrary to what we had observed
about cities as a whole in the "Tweet Volume as a Function of
City Population" section, where greater population led to
less per capita tweeting. This verifies H5.
We understand this phenomenon and connect the results
here to results from the "Tweet Volume as a Function of City
Population" section. Even though individual users are tweet-
ing more frequently in more populated cities, there are fewer
of them. Figure 6 illustrates the number of users who are
tweeting in the various cities, as functions of population and
of population density, together with power-law fits. The
power-law exponent is 0.944 for population and 0.791 for
population density, which is strongly sublinear.
Though individuals in denser cities tweet more often, the
aggregate volume of tweets decreases in larger cities because
there are fewer people tweeting. This verifies H6 and con-
tributes to the literature in terms of furthering our under-
standing of social media use in large urban environments. It
also renders visible differences in urban life as not all urban
people are the same in their social media habits or even their
use or adoption of social technologies.
We may interpret this concentrated core of tweeters within
denser and more populated cities as the emergence of a social
group we term "town tweeters" that serves an information
broadcast function. One might also conjecture that in dense
Gross et al. 11
populations, there may be desires to strongly affiliate with
some subidentity to preserve individuality and yield guide-
lines for who is within the homophilous group. People may
be more drawn to specific fandoms or race/ethnicity and reli-
gious affiliations. Microcommunities may need more syn-
chronous communication similar to "naturally occurring
talk" among members to sustain themselves (Giles, 2006).
Of course, these processes can be understood through a
social constructivist view.
Conclusion
We analyzed tweeting behavior and found it to be an indica-
tor of pace of life. The temporal dynamics of tweeting are
bursty rather than periodic, displaying a few different kinds
of statistical distributions. Tweeting volume per capita
decreases with city population size. This indicates the pres-
ence of economies of scale with Twitter, much like with city
infrastructure. Remaining variation unexplained by city pop-
ulation is partially explained by aspects of city demographics
and personality. However, an individualized (rather than eco-
logical) look at tweeting behavior indicates that individuals
in denser cities generally tweet more frequently. This appar-
ent contradiction is explained by the fact that there are fewer
active tweeters in larger cities, and, indeed, one may say that
this active core of users acts as a broadcast infrastructure for
a city, an emergent, concentrated group, we term "town
tweeters." This echoes the town criers in Spanish America
who made public announcements via repetition (sometimes
up to 30 times; Rappaport & Cummins, 1994). Ultimately,
Twitter is a sociotechnical system which affords important
forms of local communication that we might think are over-
shadowed in an age of information abundance. Our findings
about people in cities of different sizes indicate that popula-
tion is not the only factor. People post to Twitter in some
cities in ways that deviate from expected statistical models.
This tells us that the culture and demographics of a city do
matter. Whether urban citizens are part of strong media or
digital technology cultures could be influencing city-level
dynamics on Twitter. Particular demographic factors such as
disproportionately young citizens or unique racial composi-
tion also likely shape a city's aggregate tweet personality.
Although tweeting is a significant aspect of Twitter, it is
not all that Twitter is used for. Twitter has experienced
"declining person-to-person communication", with users
opting to retweet more than reply (Liu, Kliman-Silver, &
Mislove, 2014). It is difficult to judge how these types of
behaviors contribute to the overall nature of Twitter's social
networking among various users, groups, and geographic
areas. Further understanding of Twitter must include analysis
of reading behavior, especially since Twitter is often said to
be an important source for news.
Studies of the motivations behindTwitter usage have divided
its population into three types: information sharing, information
seeking, and friendship-wise relationship (Java, Song, Finin, &
Tseng, 2009). Certain users have a high reputation that is not
only contingent on how often they tweet but also on whether
what they tweet is perceived as valuable. Such users who are
important information sources would likely be "town tweeters."
Since Twitter is more concerned with information aggregation
and dissemination than specifically with productivity or innova-
tion, it is interesting to note the distinct scaling behavior with
city size encountered in previous studies (Arbesman &
Christakis, 2011; Bettencourt, 2013; Bettencourt et al., 2007;
Pan et al., 2013). Twitter is perhaps a multicast communication
infrastructure with economies of scale, rather than an emergent
phenomenon like innovation, as measured through patents.
To further understand the distinction between the conversa-
tional point-to-point and the information-sharing broadcast pos-
sibilities of Twitter, one might look more deeply at the amount
of @-mention tweets and retweets. Tweets with @-mentions
may be more conversational, whereas retweets may lead to

function of city population density; a power-law fit indicates a strong sublinear scaling.

greater information dissemination. Individuals who are not
heavy Twitter users may be less likely to see and use @-men-
tions; instead, they may choose to post undirected tweets and be
less concerned with tweet visibility by their followers.
Beyond investigating the notion of pace of life and describ-
ing the emergence of a core set of town tweeters, this study
also concludes that urban American Twitter users exhibit
bursts of activity on Twitter rather than continued engage-
ment throughout the day. This helps counter mainstream
media arguments that Twitter is "taking over our lives"
(Meade, 2010). Rather than indicating a Twitter stranglehold,
bursty behavior reveals that for some users, the medium has
become a "normal" activity and an important part of one's
life. Of course, what is considered to be excessive use of
Twitter varies by sociocultural contexts and bursty distribu-
tions may be at a time scale appropriate to their contextual-
ized use. Users without a pattern of bursty behavior use
Twitter in a fundamentally different way, most likely because
they are spam-based or bots. These users could also be part of
an increasing group who are not tweeting but are on Twitter to
read the tweets of users they follow, particularly celebrities,
news outlets, professional contacts, and family/friends.
There is high variation in tweeting behavior, perhaps due
to the emergence of distinct social groups within the Twitter
community. It should be noted that due to privacy concerns,
some have multiple Twitter accounts to create a division
between their professional and personal use of the platform
(Vitak, Blasiola, Patil, & Litt, 2015). Others become more
engaged or even have several different active accounts in
operation. In addition, there is an increasing trend of short-
lived parody/comedy accounts. Other bursty behavior could
also be attributed to the fact that Twitter is used in lieu of
blog posts by some users (Huston & Weiss, 2011).
Twitter activity has continued to grow as users find some
level of social gratification from tweeting, which has been
seen to be correlated with the average number of @-replies per
week as well as the number of active months spent on the
medium (Chen, 2011). Though users adopt different tweeting
behaviors, the normalcy of bursty activity on Twitter suggests
that our online social communication in this medium adds to
our diverse forms of social communication, rather than domi-
nating it. Ultimately, our social behavior on Twitter sheds light
ontheclassicquestionofcitylifeandpaceoflife.Unexpectedly,
it also indicates the continuing power of spatially anchored
"town tweeters" as well. Though we do not empirically study
notions of community and Twitter, the presence of "town
tweeters" does speak to the ways in which social media may
be contributing toward localized (albeit globally networked)
information distributors. Simmel (1950) saw the metropolis as
having a constant flow of strangers and city life breeding a
rhythm of life which fosters detachment. Perhaps the town
tweeters are a response to this perceived detachment.

Statistical Analysis in a Nutshell
In this appendix, we describe the basics of our statistical
methodology for readers that may be unfamiliar with such
procedures for inference from data. For more details, please
see, for example, Clauset et al. (2009) or any survey-level
literature.
To fit data to a power law hypothesis, we must find the
least-squares estimates of the presumed parametric form. In
particular, given a function of the form,

Once data are fit to a model, we can look at the unex-
plained variation in the data. This is done by subtracting the
power-law model predictions from the true data. These sub-
tracted values are called the regression residuals. If there are
features, for example, of city personality, that might explain
these residuals, one can perform an ordinary least-squares
regression to investigate. This tries to find a linear combina-
tion of the various factors to explain the variable of interest.
Another kind of analysis is concerned not with modeling
a relationship as a power law but modeling the statistical dis-
tribution of some random variate according to a given para-
metric form, such as power-law distribution or power law
with exponential cutoff. That is to say, the relationship
between the variate value and its probability density function
(or probability mass function if discrete-valued) is governed
by a power law or some other parametric form. The main text
explains statistical tests for such an investigation.
