Abstract
Objective: To examine the relationship between risk factors for cardiac disease and erectile
dysfunction (ED) in men from Xi'an, China.
Methods: Participants were patients with cardiovascular disease who visited the Cardiovascular
Medicine Department of Xi'an Jiaotong University First Affiliated Hospital between September
2011 and March 2012. Two hundred and fifty patients were issued with questionnaires and
underwent a physical examination and blood test.Risk factors for ED were identified using
univariate and multivariate analyses.
Results: In total, 222 participants returned valid questionnaires (89% response rate), underwent a
physical examination and blood test, and were included in the study. The most common
cardiovascular diseases were hypertension (n ¼ 142; 64%), coronary heart disease (n ¼ 90; 41%)
and angina pectoris (n ¼ 78; 35%). Most patients (n ¼ 144; 65%) had two or more cardiovascular
diseases. Age, smoking, body mass index, total cholesterol level, hypertension and the ratio of total
cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol were significantly associated with ED. Domestic
location, level of education, participation in physical activity, diabetes and drinking alcohol were not
associated with ED.
Conclusions: Common risk factors for cardiovascular disease are associated with ED in patients
with cardiovascular disease. This study furthers understanding of the risk factors for ED in Chinese
patients with cardiovascular disease and paves the way for further research into the prevention of ED.

Introduction
Cardiovascular diseases are diseases of the
heart and vascular system1 that have similar
aetiologies, clinical development and general
treatment principles.2 A prospective, popula-
tion-based, cohort study conducted between
1985 and 2009 found the mortality rate of
male city residents due to cardiovascular
disease was >34%.3 Internationally recog-
nized major risk factors for cardiovascular
disease include age, family history, smoking,
obesity, unhealthy diet, lack of physical
activity, dyslipidaemia, hypertension and
diabetes.4 These are also significant risk
factors for cardiovascular disease in a
Chinese population.5
Erectile dysfunction (ED) is diagnosed
when a man cannot reach or maintain a full
erection and is unsatisfied with his sex life.6
Cardiovascular disease and ED often coex-
ist, and they share common risk factors.7 In
ED, the damage that occurs to the penile
artery within the corpus cavernosum is the
same as that which occurs in the cardiovas-
cular or endothelial system in cardiovascular
disease; thus, ED is a complication of car-
diovascular disease or is secondary to arter-
ial disease.8 The occurrence of ED is higher
(31%) in patients with cardiovascular risk
factors than in patients without cardiovas-
cular risk factors (20%).9
The aim of this study was to examine the
relationship between ED and risk factors
associated with cardiovascular disease in
men from Xi'an in China. This research
provides data on the relationship of these
interrelated diseases from a fast developing
city in China.
Patients and methods
Patients
This study recruited patients with cardio-
vascular disease who visited the inpatient
Department of Cardiovascular Medicine at
the Xi'an Jiaotong University First
Affiliated Hospital, Xi'an, China between
September 2011 and March 2012. The study
sample size and power were not predeter-
mined as this was a time-specified study. All
participants had at least one of the following
cardiovascular diseases: hypertension (con-
trolled by medication); coronary heart dis-
ease (diagnosed by cardiac catheterization
study and treadmill); arrhythmia (confirmed
by electrocardiogram); angina or myocar-
dial infarction. All participants had normal
thinking ability, independent judgement,
clarity of thought, ability to answer ques-
tions and were willing to co-operate in the
study. Patients were excluded if they abused
alcohol, were diagnosed with a psycho-
logical disease including psychological ED,
had high lactation hyperlipidaemia, primary
gonadal syndrome, a pituitary tumour,
bilateral or unilateral cryptorchidism, tes-
ticular inflammation, severe anaemia, a
prostate tumour, a genital mutilation
deformity, a spinal cord injury, urinary
genital mutilation, sexual maldevelopment,
sex hormone disease, thyroid disease, an
endocrine system disease such as hyperthy-
roidism, systemic lupus erythematosus, a
connective tissue disease, a malignant
tumour, a blood system disease, severe
liver or renal damage or a sexually trans-
mitted disease. Patients were also excluded if
they were critically ill or were unable to
independently complete the investigation.
Study procedures
Participants answered a questionnaire, pro-
viding information on their age (18­35
years, 36­49 years, 50­65 years or >65
years), marital status, level of education,
economic situation, lifestyle, occupation,
family, smoking status, alcohol consump-
tion, level of physical activity and medical
history (presence of hypertension, diabetes,
hyperlipidaemia, coronary artery disease,
arrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease and
cerebrovascular illness). All participants
underwent a general examination at which
Chaudhary et al. 719
blood pressure, height, weight, waist and hip
circumference and other indicators were
measured; routine blood and urine labora-
tory examinations were also performed to
determine liver and kidney profile, total
cholesterol level, ratio of total cholesterol
to high-density lipoprotein (HDL) choles-
terol, fasting plasma glucose level, random
blood glucose level and blood glucose level
2 h after an oral glucose tolerance test. Body
mass index (BMI) was calculated from
height and weight data. Blood pressure
was classified as normal, mild hypertension,
moderate hypertension or severe hyperten-
sion according to the 2010 Guidelines for the
Prevention and Treatment of Hypertension
in China.10 Diabetes mellitus (DM) was
diagnosed according to the American
Diabetes Association11 as a fasting plasma
glucose !7.0 mmol/l, a random blood sugar
!11.1 mmol/l or glucose !11.1 mmol/l 2 h
after an oral glucose tolerance test.
Erectile dysfunction was diagnosed if
patients reported that they were unable to
reach the erectile level necessary to perform
sexual intercourse or had difficulty main-
taining an adequate erection, and were
unable to attain a satisfactory sex life for
!6 months prior to the date of diagnosis. As
part of the questionnaire, participants com-
pleted the International Index of Erectile
Function 5 (IIEF-5).12 ED was classified as
severe if the IIEF-5 score was 7, moderate
if the IIEF-5 score was 8­11, moderate to
mild if the IIEF-5 score was 12­16 and mild
if the IIEF-5 score was 17­21.
Ethics statement
Before the study began, the Xi'an Jiaotong
University Ethics Committee approved the
study plan, the method of obtaining
informed consent from all participants and
the statement of written informed consent.
The study met all ethical principles for
medical research involving human partici-
pants and did not invade the patients'
privacy. Written informed consent was
obtained from all participants and all par-
ticipants were provided with free access to
the study results.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses were performed on the
obtained data to calculate the significance of
risk factors of cardiovascular disease on ED.
Odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals for
ED was calculated using Statistical Package
for Social Sciences (SPSSÕ version l3.0;
SSPS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA) software for
univariate and multivariate analyses.
Statistical significance was defined as a
P-value <0.05.
Results
In total, 250 patients were enrolled in the
study and issued with a questionnaire. Valid,
completed questionnaires were recovered
from 222 patients, giving a response rate of
89%. Twenty-two respondents (10%) were
aged 18­ 35 years, 69 (31%) were aged 36­
49 years, 73 (33%) were aged 50­ 65 years,
and 58 (26%) were aged >65 years. The
prevalence of cardiovascular disease was
lower in the 18­ 35 year age group than in
any other age group. Hypertension was the
most prevalent cardiovascular disease (pre-
sent in 142 of 222 patients; 64%), followed by
coronary heart disease (90 of 222 patients;
41%) and angina pectoris (78 of 222 patients;
35%) (Figure 1). Over half of all patients
(144; 65%) had more than one cardiovascu-
lar disease (n ¼ 80 had two diseases and
n ¼ 64 had more than two diseases). The
prevalence of hypertension and ED signifi-
cantly increased with age (Tables 1, 2 and 3).
Univariate logistic regression analysis
showed that age (odds ratio [95% confi-
dence interval, CI]) 3.12 (2.04, 4.78); BMI
1.26 (1.11, 1.43); hypertension 1.72 (1.11,
2.66); coronary artery disease 2.24
(1.17, 4.28); total cholesterol level 1.77

(1.34, 2.34); ratio of total cholesterol to
HDL cholesterol 1.72 (1.35, 2.18) and
smoking 1.77 (1.20, 2.58) were significantly
associated with increased odds of ED (Table
4). Residence, level of education, physical
activity, alcohol consumption and DM were
not significantly associated with ED.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis con-
firmed that age, smoking, BMI, economic
situation and the ratio of total cholesterol to
HDL cholesterol were independent risk fac-
tors for ED (Table 5).
Discussion
This study was performed in men with
cardiovascular disease, attending the First
Affiliated Hospital of Xi'an Jiaotong
University. The data obtained from hospi-
talized patients have high stability and
accuracy, thus the use of hospitalized
patients is an effective way to avoid infor-
mation bias.13 In addition, standardized
survey processes were used, with uniform
diagnostic criteria and reliable data filtering
to reduce the risk of mixed bias and to
increase the validity of these results.
A previous report suggested that the
incidence of ED in patients with cardiovas-
cular disease was similar in urban and rural
areas.14 With the ongoing development of
the Chinese economy, the difference between
urban and rural areas will continue to
decrease, and cardiovascular disease will

no longer be a `rich man's disease' specific to
economically developed regions or cities.15
A further study used multivariate logistic
regression analysis to indicate that economic
situation was an independent risk factor for
ED in patients with cardiovascular dis-
ease.16 People across China now have rea-
sonable standards of living and leisure, and
an increasing intake of high protein, high
cholesterol foods, but undertake less phys-
ical activity. A low level of physical exercise,
obesity and high blood cholesterol are all
risk factors for ED.17
As societies develop, the average lifespan
increases,18 and the health-related quality of
life as individuals age becomes of increasing
concern.19 ED shows a close relationship
with old age.20 The perception among the

general population is that as people age,
decline in sexual function is a natural phe-
nomenon. Although the news media provide
excessive publicity about treatments avail-
able for sexually related diseases and sexual
dysfunction, individuals who experience a
decline in sexual function are embarrassed
to seek medical help.21
In this study, most of the participants had
at least two types of cardiovascular disease
and a number of factors contributing to
ED.22 The prevalence of ED increased with
age, supporting previous reports that the
prevalence of ED is higher in individuals
aged !50 years than in individuals aged 50
years.23 Univariate and multivariate logistic
regression analyses showed that age was a
risk factor for ED. This supports previous
studies in China and abroad, such as the
Zhang Qingjiang survey of 2,226 men in
three cities in China, which reported that the
prevalence of ED was 15.6% in men aged
30 years, 24.5% in those aged 3 l­40 years,
26.1% in those aged 51­60 years, 43.4% in
those aged 61­70 years and 65.3% in those
aged >70 years.24
Smoking is a major risk factor for car-
diovascular disease25 and the incidence of
hypertension, coronary heart disease and
myocardial infarction is markedly higher in

smokers than in nonsmokers.26 Nicotine
causes vascular endothelial dysfunction,
reduces sex hormone secretion, increases
dysfunction of sperm, reduces the grade-b
sperm count, causes abnormal sperm
morphology and reduced motility, resulting
in infertility.27 Smoking also affects blood
circulation and reduces genital blood flow,
which can lead to sexual dysfunction.28
Results from the present study indicate
that smoking was an independent risk
factor for ED. This is consistent with the
results of existing research results in China
and abroad. A meta-analysis by Tengs and
Osgood showed that smoking was an
important factor in ED,29 and the Zhang
Qingjiang study reported that the incidence
of ED was 42.3% in individuals who
smoked >20 cigarettes/day.24 In this study,
no statistically significant relationship was
found between alcohol consumption and
ED, which supports the report of Nicolosi
et al.30
Obesity increases the risk of cardiovascu-
lar disease and can also affect the function of
the endocrine system.31 BMI is a simple
height-to-weight ratio, which, with the body
fat percentage content, has major relevance
to CHD.32 Obesity is an independent risk
factor for coronary heart disease and
stroke,33,34 and a BMI ! 24 increases the
risk of coronary heart disease in patients
with high blood pressure, diabetes and
dyslipidaemia.35 Here, BMI was signifi-
cantly associated with ED in patients with
cardiovascular disease. There are several
mechanisms by which obesity may increase
the risk of ED. The high blood pressure,
high blood sugar and high blood cholesterol
associated with obesity will accelerate the
formation of atherosclerotic plaques, which
will have an effect on penile artery endothe-
lium and blood flow dynamics.36 Endocrine
factors, such as reduced testosterone ketone
secretion, and increased female hormone
secretion can also impact ED.37 Obesity

can also cause psychological inferiority and
lead to poor social adjustment, which can
cause psychological obstacles to sexual per-
formance. In addition, a large amount of fat
in the abdominal area and around the fat
pad at the base of the penis can be an
obstacle to sexual performance.38
Studies on the relationship between
metabolism of blood lipids and erectile
function are common both in China and in
other countries.39 Gholami et al.40 concluded
that hyperlipidaemia not only affects the
vascular smooth muscle tissue of the penis,
but also affects the peripheral cavernous
nerve. Seftel et al.41 reported that between
1995 and 2002, 42.4% of ED patients in the
USA had hyperlipidaemia-related ED.
A decrease in high density lipoprotein an
elevation of total cholesterol/HDL are both
correlated with ED42 and are important risk
factors for ED.43 Results of the present study
further indicate that the ratio of total chol-
esterol to HDL cholesterol is a risk factor
for ED.
Hypertension may also be caused by
mental and neurological factors,44 problems
with the renin-angiotensin system,45 sodium
retention (which leads to increased extracel-
lular water and increased heart output
volume),46 or genetic factors.47 Results of
the present study showed that 76.1% of
patients with essential hypertension had ED
and that hypertension was a risk factor
for ED.
Univariate logistic regression analysis
showed that DM was not significantly
associated with ED, which may have been
due to the good control of blood sugar levels
by the patients with DM involved in this
study.
One limitation of this study was that the
sample size and power were not
predetermined.
In conclusion, this study confirms
that risk factors for cardiovascular disease,
i.e. economic situation, smoking, hyperten-
sion, coronary heart disease, diabetes and
total cholesterol are also risk factors for ED.
This study furthers our understanding of
the risk factors for ED in Chinese patients
with cardiovascular disease and paves the
way for further research regarding preven-
tion of ED.
