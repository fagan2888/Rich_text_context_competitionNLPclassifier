Management of Substance Use Disorders
in Ambulatory Care in the United States,
2001-2009
An estimated 22.5 million Americans meet crite-
ria for a substance use disorder diagnosis.1 Opi-
oid use, in particular, has attracted attention re-
cently because overdose deaths due to opioid analgesics
have increased nearly 4-fold in the past decade.2 Effec-
tive treatment options have also increased during this pe-
riod.3 The impact of these developments on the delivery
of substance abuse treatment in traditional ambulatory
care settings is not known. Further change is expected
as recent federal legislation is implemented.4 Therefore,
we sought to describe the prevalence and management
of substance use disorders in ambulatory care in a na-
tionally representative sample.
Methods. We analyzed data from the National Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) and the National Hos-
pital Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS) from
2001 through 2009. The NAMCS and the NHAMCS are
nationally representative cross-sectional surveys of am-
bulatory visits administered by the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS).5,6 Survey data include up to 3
diagnoses coded using the International Classification of
Diseases, Ninth Revision, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM) and up to 3 reasons for the visit coded using the
NCHS Reason for Visit Classification. We identified vis-
its by individuals 18 years or older in which a diagnosis
or complaint of an alcohol or drug use disorder (de-
fined as dependence, abuse, withdrawal, or intoxica-
tion) was recorded. We defined pharmacotherapy as the
provision of any 1 of 5 medications approved by the US
Food and Drug Administration for alcohol or opioid use
disorders: buprenorphine, methadone, acamprosate, di-
sulfiram, and naltrexone.3 We defined psychosocial
therapy as the provision of psychotherapy, mental health
counseling, or stress management. We evaluated differ-
ences in proportions with the 2 test and trends with the
Cochran-Mantel-Haenszel test. We used multivariable lo-
gistic regression to identify predictors of management,
adjusting for patient- and practice-level characteristics
as well as time period. We performed analyses using SAS
version 9.3 (SAS Institute Inc) and SAS-callable SUDAAN
release 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Institute) to account
for the complex survey design.
Results. We analyzed 8930 visits, representing an esti-
mated 42.2 million adult visits involving substance use
disorders in ambulatory settings between 2001 and 2009.
Visits increased 70% over this period, from 10.6 million
in 2001 through 2003 to 18.0 million in 2007 through
2009 (P=.006; Figure). Visits for opioid use disorders
increased 6-fold from 772 000 in 2001 through 2003 to
4.4 million in 2007 through 2009, accounting for 7% of
all substance use disorder visits in 2001 through 2003
and 25% of visits in 2007 through 2009 (P=.004).
Physicians prescribed pharmacotherapy in 6.3 mil-
lion visits, representing 15% of all substance use disor-
der visits. These visits increased more than 6-fold, from
an estimated 643 000 visits in 2001 through 2003 to 3.9
million visits in 2007 through 2009 (P.001). Physi-

cians prescribed buprenorphine or methadone in 4.8 mil-
lion visits and acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone in
1.5 million visits. Physicians provided psychosocial
therapy in an estimated 24.9 million visits, representing
59% of all visits. This proportion did not change signifi-
cantly over time (P=.87). In multivariable models, time
period was independently associated with pharmaco-
therapy (odds ratio [OR], 3.3 for 2007-2009 vs 2001-
2003; 95% CI, 1.7-6.1) but not psychosocial therapy (OR,
0.8 for 2007-2009 vs 2001-2003; 95% CI, 0.5-1.3). How-
ever, neither therapy was provided in 15.4 million vis-
its, accounting for 36% of visits and not varying signifi-
cantly over time (P=.76).
Comment. In this nationally representative sample of adult
ambulatory visits, visits involving a substance use dis-
order increased substantially between 2001 and 2009. Opi-
oid use disorders accounted for a markedly increased share
of visits over time. This finding is consistent with trends
in substance use disorder­related utilization at the na-
tion's community health centers and emergency depart-
ments and, sadly, use of its morgues.2,7,8 Our study pro-
vides reason for optimism, however. Visits involving
provision of pharmacotherapy increased as well, likely
driven by the use of buprenorphine. Increasing recog-
nition of previously undiagnosed disorders, improving
familiarity with and use of available medications, and more
frequent ambulatory care by individuals with substance
use disorders all likely contribute to the trend of increas-
ing visits over time. As millions of visits did not involve
treatment, there remains both an opportunity and a need
for further expansion of treatment within ambulatory
settings.
Our study has several limitations. First, the cross-
sectional, visit-based nature of the data precludes causal
inferences. Residual confounding is possible, and un-
derdiagnosis is likely. Finally, the NAMCS/NHAMCS lacks
detailed clinical information, so we could not assess the
appropriateness of management decisions by health care
providers.
The Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
of 2008 (Pub L No. 110-343) and the Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act of 2010 (Pub L No. 111-148)
will provide increased support for the management of sub-
stance use disorders in ambulatory settings.4 Our study
provides an important assessment of the national im-
pact of substance use disorders in ambulatory care at a
time when these laws have the potential to transform the
US health care system's ability to care for the millions of
Americans struggling with these disorders.
