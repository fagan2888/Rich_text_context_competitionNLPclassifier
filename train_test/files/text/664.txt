Data from the 1992 wave of the Health and Retirement Study are used to examine the
incidence of job displacement among workers ages 51 through 60. The average displaced
worker experiences a loss in earnings of 39%. Households which contain a displaced worker
have incomes 24% lower than the household of an average worker. Little of these lost
earnings are replaced through pension income. The rate of health insurance coverage is 16%
lower among displaced workers. As with other labor market outcomes, non-Whites on
average are the most economically vulnerable following displacement.

Late Life Job Displacement
Kenneth A. Couch, PhD1
Although recent evidence indicates that the over-
all rate of job displacement has not changed since
the early 1980s (Farber, 1993; Herz, 1991), the inci-
dence of job displacement among workers ages 55
to 64 has increased in the past decade from being
the lowest of any cohort to being the highest (Gard-
ner, 1995). Prior studies also report that rates of
reemployment following displacement are lower
among older than younger workers (Flaim & Sehgal,
1985; Gardner, 1995; Herz, 1991; Horvath, 1987).
Despite these increasing rates of displacement and
relatively poor experiences afterwards, no paper
has specifically investigated displacement among
older workers. The research presented here builds
on the prior literature by investigating the inci-
dence and impact of job displacement among work-
ers ages 51 through 60.
One reason for examining this specific age cohort
is that none of the workers are age-eligible for
social security retirement benefits and many would
not yet qualify for other sources of long-term in-
come replacement such as private pensions. This
means that older displaced workers must rely pri-
marily upon themselves and their households in
adapting to the loss of employment. While many
displaced workers will be reemployed quickly, prior
research indicates that even those workers will
experience long-term losses in their earnings.
Moreover, there is reason to believe that the earn-
ings losses associated with displacement will be
larger for older workers. Older workers typically
have more seniority, and if they leave a job where

they have built up specific knowledge which is not
easily transferable to another employer, they would
be expected to experience larger losses of earnings
than younger, less experienced workers. The loss of
health care and other employer provided benefits
might also expose older workers to more financial
risk than a younger worker due to the association of
aging with the onset of physical problems.
Another concern for older workers who are dis-
placed prior to normal retirement ages is how this
will affect their accumulation of assets for retire-
ment. If a displaced worker has difficulty being
reemployed at their prior level of earnings, planned
saving for retirement may not occur and the worker
may be forced to consume assets which had initially
been accumulated for retirement.
However, the higher rates of nonemployment
among older workers following displacement may
reflect something other than economic hardship.
Displaced workers could be receiving private pen-
sion income, and this may explain why many exit
the labor force. Although private pension eligibility
and receipt will be examined here, previous research
suggests that relatively few of the individuals who
qualify for private pensions would elect to receive
them at these ages (Burkhauser, Couch, & Phillips,
1996).
Most of the prior research regarding displaced
workers has used the Displaced Workers' Surveys
(DWS), a supplement to the January Current Popula-
tion Survey (CPS) at two year intervals since 1984.
Using those data, it is common to define displace-
ment as the loss of a job in which the worker had
been employed for at least three years due to plant
closure or layoff. Those data provide sufficient sam-
ples to examine the average displaced worker, but
the sample sizes available for examining specific age
groups, as will be done here, are prohibitively small.
As an alternative, data from the first wave of the
Health and Retirement Study (HRS) allow individu-
als who have lost jobs due to plant closure or layoff
Vol. 38, No. 1,1998
to be identified. Because of the emphasis of the
HRS on an older (ages 51 through 61 in 1991) cohort,
the number of observations available is larger than
would be the case if the DWS were used (see
Appendix, Note 1). Also, the HRS was designed to
obtain measures which are more important for
older workers such as their household's net worth.
Because the HRS data provide a larger sample size
and more information than the DWS for older
workers, they are used here.
To place the experiences of older Americans and
their families following job displacement in context,
a brief review of the existing literature will be pro-
vided. Then, the data will be described followed
by a discussion of a series of tables regarding the in-
cidence of job displacement and its impacts. Among
the topics discussed will be the incidence of job
displacement and its correlates, the reemployment
experiences of displaced workers, the losses in
earnings that occur for the individual and their
household, the availability and use of pensions as
a substitute for earned income, changes in health
insurance coverage, and differences in the net
worths of the households of displaced workers rela-
tive to others.
Prior Literature
The literature regarding job displacement and its
subsequent impacts has grown substantially since
the early 1980s. The major findings of that literature
will be discussed here. More detail may be found in
a recent survey (Fallick, 1996). Two topics have dom-
inated the literature which examines job displace-
ment. First, what is the incidence of job displace-
ment and has it changed over time? Second, how
are employment and earnings affected by job dis-
placement?
As each DWS has been released, papers have
been published which document the incidence of
job displacement in the current survey and contrast
it with findings from prior surveys (Flaim & Sehgal,
1985; Gardner, 1995; Herz, 1991; and Horvath, 1987).
From these as well as integrative studies by Farber
(1993) and Gardner (1995) which make use of data
from several of the DWS, a picture emerges of the
incidence of job displacement and its evolution
during the decade of the 1980s.
Throughout the period covered by the DWS, the
overall rate of displacement has not increased (Far-
ber, 1993; Gardner, 1995). The composition of those
displaced, however, has changed. In cross-sections
from the first few DWS, young workers have a
higher rate of displacement than older workers. In
the most recent survey, the rate of displacement
among all workers is actually lower than among
workers ages 55 and older (Gardner, 1995).
Another compositional change has occurred
since the first DWS. Gardner (1995, p. 46) reports
that "During the 1981-82 period, more than half of
all displaced workers had lost manufacturing jobs."
By the 1992 DWS, this proportion had fallen to 22%.
This decline was mirrored in a reduction of the con-
centration of displacement among blue collar work-
ers during the same period.
These studies have also detailed the proportion
of the affected workers who are reemployed, unem-
ployed, or exit the labor force following displace-
ment. Horvath (1987) reports that among workers
who had 3 years of tenure prior to displacement
and who had lost their job in the preceding two
years, in January of 1986, 73% of those ages 25 to 54
were reemployed versus 47% of those ages 55 to 64.
Lower rates of reemployment among relatively older
workers are common in all of the studies based on
the DWS.
These descriptive studies also document the de-
cline in earnings which is experienced by a typical
displaced worker. Several examine the proportion
of workers whose wages decline by more than a
threshold amount, such as 20%. Herz (1991, p. 8)
reports that among displaced workers who find a
new job, 25% experience a decline in earnings of
20% or more but that 29% experience an increase of
20% or more. For a similar set of workers in 1986,
Horvath (1987) reports that 27% experience a de-
cline in earnings of 20% or more but that 27% also
experience an increase of 20% or more. Gardner
(1995) examines the change in median weekly earn-
ings and reports a decrease from $515 to $473, or
8%. One weakness of these studies is that they only
provide these calculations for those who are reem-
ployed and possibly understate the impact of dis-
placement on earnings.
A set of studies which use a multivariate approach
have also examined the impact of displacement on
subsequent employment and earnings. Rather than
describing the incidence of job displacement per se,
these studies focus on identifying covariates associ-
ated with either reemployment or earnings changes.
Two studies have examined what factors are asso-
ciated with cross group or industry differences in
reemployment shortly after displacement (Farber,
1993; Ruhm, 1991a). Another has examined the dura-
tion of the effects (Ruhm, 1991b).
Farber (1993) considers job losses which have
occurred in the previous two years among workers
with at least three years of job tenure. He reports
that women, minorities, and older workers (ages 55
to 64) are less likely to be reemployed using the
DWS data. This examination, however, contrasts
rates of reemployment across the population of dis-
placed workers. In contrast, Ruhm (1991a) uses data
from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID)
and compares the experiences of displaced workers
to a control group of similar individuals at risk of
displacement. Ruhm (1991a) concludes that dis-
placement does "not have particularly adverse im-
pacts on the employment levels of non-Whites, blue
collar occupations, or long tenure workers" (p. 521).
He argues that once a control group is used, many of
the cross-group differences in post-displacement
reemployment observed in studies which do not
use a similar methodology become statistically in-
significant.
Ruhm (1991b) also examined the long-term reem-
The Gerontologist
ployment prospects of displaced workers. Ruhm
(1991b, p. 322) concludes that, "Four years after dis-
placement, job losers are out of work only one
week more than their nondisplaced counterparts."
Thus, while all groups are adversely impacted by
job displacement in the short run, displaced work-
ers are employed at rates similar to those who were
never displaced within several years.
The multivariate analyses which have focused on
the earnings losses associated with job displace-
ment examine both the gross loss as well as how
much of it may be attributed to factors such as age,
general experience, specific experience, and transi-
tions across industries following displacement (Car-
rington, 1993; Carrington & Zaman, 1994; Farber,
1993; Jacobson, LaLonde, & Sullivan, 1993; Kletzer,
1989; Madden, 1988; Neal, 1995; Ong & Mar, 1992;
Ruhm, 1991b). Ruhm (1991b) also examines whether
the earnings losses are only temporary or are per-
manent in nature.
The average earnings loss reported by these stud-
ies ranges from 10 to 25% (Carrington, 1993; Car-
rington & Zaman, 1994; Farber, 1993; Kletzer, 1989;
Jacobson et al., 1993; Ruhm, 1991b). The smallest
earnings loss is found by Ruhm (1991b) who exam-
ines their size four years after displacement. Earn-
ings losses appear to be greatest immediately fol-
lowing displacement, are moderated over time, but
do not disappear. As with the descriptive studies,
the calculations described here only include reem-
ployed workers so they potentially underestimate
the impact of displacement on earnings.
Studies which have decomposed the gross earn-
ings loss have often focused on whether specific
industry skills and total years of experience are
rewarded following job displacement (Carrington,
1993; Kletzer, 1989; Neal, 1995; Ong & Mar, 1992). If
earnings are closely related to industry specific
skills, reemployment in the same industry following
displacement should be related to higher earnings.
These studies support the view that individuals
develop industry specific skills which are not easily
transportable to new employers following job dis-
placement. Carrington (1993) and Neal (1995) both
report that those who switch industries following
displacement have the largest earnings losses. Klet-
zer (1989) concludes that the importance of industry
specific skills varies across industries since blue col-
lar workers experience earnings reductions related
to seniority which are larger than those observed
among white collar workers.
Most of these studies do not examine differences
in experiences across race, gender, or age partitions
of the sample (see Appendix, Note 2). Where con-
trols for age, gender, and ethnicity are included,
most report that they are not significantly related to
the observed earnings losses once tenure and edu-
cation are controlled. The only exceptions are in the
research of Farber who finds that age is associated
with reduced post displacement earnings and Ong
and Mar who report that age, being Hispanic, and
being female are each associated with lower post-
displacement earnings.
One study explicitly examines whether minorities
and women have higher or lower earnings losses
than Whites. Madden (1988) concludes that follow-
ing displacement, minority men experience larger
earnings losses than White men but that the earn-
ings losses are larger for White women than Black
women. She suggests that when other researchers
pool minority men and women together, they do
not find these differential impacts due to aggrega-
tion bias. She also reports that age is associated
with larger earnings losses.
Data
Before proceeding to the examination of job dis-
placement among older workers, it is important to
describe the basic sample which will be used
throughout the paper. The HRS contains information
on 9,758 individuals ages 51 to 61. Those who are age
61 would be most likely to alter their behavior in
response to the availability of social security retire-
ment benefits at age 62 so they are excluded from
this study. This reduces the sample size to 8,963.
In order to calculate rates of displacement, the
group of individuals at risk of displacement must be
identified from this age-eligible population. Persons
at risk of displacement are defined to be those who
were employed in 1989 and had been with the same
employer for at least five years. 4,282 of the observa-
tions in the HRS on individuals ages 51 through 60
meet this standard for being at risk of displacement.
From the group of individuals who are at risk of
displacement, those who are displaced must be
selected. To be displaced, a person must report
they lost a job in 1990 or 1991 in which they had at
least five years of prior tenure. This window of two
years duplicates the two year retrospective window
which has been used in much of the prior descrip-
tive research based on the Displaced Worker Sur-
veys (Flaim & Sehgal, 1985; Gardner, 1995; Herz,
1991; Horvath, 1987; Farber, 1993).
The method of determining whether a person
was displaced depends on whether they were
employed at the date of their 1992 HRS interview. If
a person was employed, an examination of their job
history was conducted to determine if they had
exited a job in 1990 or 1991 due to business closure
or layoff in which they had at least five years of
tenure prior to 1990. If so, they were counted as a
displaced worker.
If a person was unemployed, the record of their
most recent employment was examined. If that job
ended in 1990 or 1991 due to business closure or
layoff and they had at least five years of tenure in
the position prior to 1990, the person was counted
as a displaced worker. If a person was unemployed,
their job history was also examined. If they had
exited a job in 1990 or 1991 due to business closure
or layoff in which they had at least five years of
tenure prior to 1990, they were counted as dis-
placed. In total, 204 age-eligible individuals were
found to be displaced from the 4,282 at risk. The
definition adopted in the paper of a permanent job
Vol. 38, No. 1,1998
as one which lasts more than five years is necessi-
tated by the data since jobs must have a minimum
duration of five years to be recorded in the employ-
ment history section of the survey. For prior jobs, a
variety of detail regarding compensation and the
type of occupation is available.
Displacement and Its Effects
The importance of job displacement as both a
social and economic phenomenon depends upon
how often it occurs. Table 1 shows the population
of individuals ages 51 through 60 in the United
States at the date of the 1992 HRS. Of the total pop-
ulation of more than 21 million, 10.4 million, or about
half, were at risk of displacement; i.e., they had held
a job for at least five years prior to 1990. Of those at
risk of displacement, 492 thousand were displaced
in 1990 or 1991. As shown in the last column of the
table, 4.7% of this age group was displaced (see Ap-
pendix, Note 3).
This estimate is made over a window of two years
spanning 1990 and 1991. So, it should be compara-
ble to those from the DWS which have used a two
year window. During the period from 1991 through
1992, Gardner (1995) reports a displacement rate of
4.5% for those ages 55 to 64 who have at least three
years of predisplacement tenure. This compares well
with the displacement rate of 4.7% in Table 1 for
workers ages 50 through 60 with five years of pre-
displacement tenure.
Beyond the total rate of displacement, the final
column of Table 1 allows for comparisons across
groups and for tests of differences in their rates of
displacement. For example, across the aggregate
groupings of men and women, the proportions dis-
placed are equal, .047. Similarly, no clear pattern is
evident in the displacement rates across individual
ages in Table 1. There are also no statistically signifi-
cant patterns across the larger age groupings pro-
vided in the table for women, Whites, and non-
Whites. Males, however, appear more likely to be
displaced from ages 51 through 55 than 56 through
60. Also, the displacement rate among non-Whites
(.062) is 41% higher than for Whites (.044). Using the
standard errors provided, this racial difference is
significant at the 5% level (see Appendix, Note 4).
Prior research has established that higher levels
of education and seniority reduce the likelihood of
layoff. Table 2 shows the average education and job
tenure in 1990 of the group of workers at risk of dis-
placement and of those who were later displaced.
Average education does not vary significantly
across workers at risk of displacement relative to
those who were displaced for any of the demo-
graphic breakdowns provided in the table except

for non-Whites. There are, however, significant cross-
group differences in education if one looks down
the columns of the table to consider either the
group of at-risk workers or those displaced. At-risk
White workers on average had 13.1 years of educa-
tion while minorities had only 11.8. Displaced White
workers had 13.3 years of education on average rel-
ative to 10.7 years for non-Whites. The difference in
education across the White and minority groups for
at-risk workers suggests that minorities should be at
a higher risk for job displacement. Among minori-
ties, it also appears that the less educated have a
greater chance of displacement.
Average job tenure prior to 1990 is 2.6 years
higher for the at-risk group relative to those who
are later displaced. Considering the demographic
groups in Table 2, males, Whites, and non-Whites
who are displaced appear to have significantly
lower job tenure than the at-risk group. No signifi-
cant difference in predisplacement tenure is seen
across displaced and at-risk women workers.
Again, if the groups of at-risk and displaced work-
ers contained in the individual columns are consid-
ered, significant differences in tenure are observed
by race and gender. Men have significantly more
tenure than women and Whites more than non-
Whites. Although there is no difference in the dis-
placement rates of men and women, the lower job
tenure of non-Whites appears to explain, in part,
their higher rates of displacement.
In the early 1980s, displacement was strongly
influenced by the industry of employment and type
of occupation in addition to personal characteris-
tics. Although recent evidence indicates those pat-
terns have moderated among all workers, older
workers may nonetheless be concentrated in de-
clining industries. Table 3 examines the extent to
which job displacement is concentrated among
blue and white collar occupations as well as major
industrial groupings for older workers.
Upon examination, Table 3 indicates that the pro-
portions of blue and white collar workers who are
displaced are similar, .045 versus .048. Across indus-
tries, manufacturing accounts for 22% of the em-
ployment of the at-risk group of workers and a
slightly more than proportional amount of the job
displacement observed, 25%. The components of
service employment (transportation, government,
wholesale and retail trade, finance, insurance, real
estate, and services) employ 67% of the at-risk
group of workers and account for a roughly propor-
tional 63% of the observed displacement.
The incidence of displacement is roughly equal
across occupations and industries. The primary vari-
ations observed in the rate of displacement appear
to be associated with the lower education and job
tenure of minorities. One wonders how successful
displaced workers, and minorities in particular, will
be in finding new employment.
Table 4 considers the labor force status of work-
ers displaced in 1990 and 1991 at the date of their
1992 HRS interview. The columns of the table show
how many workers were initially displaced, what
proportion had paid employment at the date of sur-
vey, what proportion were unemployed, and what
proportion were out of the labor force. Among all
displaced workers in the preceding two years, 73%
were reemployed at the date of survey, 18% were
unemployed, and 10% had left the labor force (see
Appendix, Note 5).
Across the demographic breakdowns by gender
and race, significantly mor? women exit the labor

workers in the cohort (56-60) exit the labor force
than among younger workers (51-55). This pattern is
not statistically significant but is relevant to the later
discussion of pension eligibility and receipt.
The rates of reemployment observed here are
higher for this age cohort than those found in the
DWS. This is most likely because the survey date of
the DWS is January of the year of interview. Some
of the 1992 HRS interviews took place in 1993 which
provides a longer time frame within which dis-
placed workers could subsequently become reem-
ployed. This would be expected to raise the propor-
tion of displaced workers observed reemployed in
the HRS relative to the DWS as seen here.
Beyond unemployment, the most obvious disrup-
tion following displacement is the loss of earned
income. Since about one quarter of those displaced
are not reemployed by the date of the survey, one
would expect a fairly sizable loss in earned income
on average. Also, given the relatively bad experi-
ences of non-Whites, they might also be expected
to suffer somewhat larger losses in earnings on
average.
In the 1992 HRS, information on earnings is col-
lected for the 1991 calendar year. This creates a
problem in making before and after earnings com-
parisons because workers displaced in 1991 would
report earnings at the time of leaving their perma-
nent job and those same earnings would be re-
ported as part of their total earnings in 1991. In
order to make a pure comparison of earnings on
prior jobs relative to earnings in 1991, the figures
presented in Table 5 are calculated only for those
individuals displaced in 1990. The comparison being
made is between annualized earnings at the point
of leaving a permanent job in 1990 to annual earned
income in 1991. Ninety-four observations are used
in these calculations. The calculation for displaced
and reemployed non-Whites uses 15 observations.
All of the other elements of the table are based on
at least 25 observations (see Appendix, Note 6).
Table 5 contains information on the average earn-
ings of all current workers relative to two groups of

displaced workers, those who were displaced and
reemployed and all displaced workers. The average
displaced worker experiences a decline in their
earnings of 39% or $12,497 dollars. For the average
worker who is displaced and reemployed, earnings
decline by 30% or $10,312. As the average displaced
worker earns $32,310 in their prior job, this provides
a rough estimate of the expected earnings loss for
those who are not reemployed.
Considering all displaced workers, women have
significantly lower earnings than men and minori-
ties have significantly lower earnings than Whites
following displacement. What is to be made of this
is unclear. Similar differences existed prior to dis-
placement. Displacement appears to substantially
reduce the earnings of all groups. Racial and gender
pay differentials observed before displacement are
maintained afterwards.
Similar figures are provided in the table for those
workers who are reemployed. When the unemployed
workers are dropped from the calculations, the cur-
rent earnings of White and non-White workers are
only $2,500 apart. The gap between male and female
earnings, however, widens. The negative impact of
displacement on the earnings of minorities appears
to be associated with their relatively low likelihood
of subsequent employment. For women, the nega-
tive impact appears to be related to low earnings in
their new jobs.
One way that older displaced workers might be
able to supplement their earnings is by electing to
receive private pension income if they qualify.
Those who have more generous pensions might
also be expected to exit the labor force and retire
early. This, in part, could explain some of the move-
ment out of the labor force observed in Table 4 (see
Appendix, Note 7).
Table 6 provides information on current pension
eligibility for at risk and displaced workers at the
date of the 1992 HRS. As can be seen in the first row
of columns 1 and 2 of the table, of all workers at
risk, 60% were qualified to receive a private pension
if they elected relative to 37% of those displaced. If
those exiting the labor force are being influenced
by the availability of private pension income, they
must first be qualified for receipt. As a group, those
who left the labor force were least likely to qualify
for a private pension.
Table 7 investigates how many of the eligible
workers elected to take the pension income. As can
be seen in that table, the rates of pension receipt
are basically identical across workers at risk of dis-
placement, all displaced workers, displaced and
reeemployed workers, and displaced and unem-
ployed workers. Those who were displaced and are
out of the labor force take pension income at more
than twice the rate of these other groups, but the
rate itself is only 18%. None of the displaced women
who were not reemployed were receiving pension
income. The same can be said of older non-Whites.
On the other hand, more than half of all males out
of the labor force are receiving pension income.
Table 7 also shows the average amount of pen-
sion income for each of the five groups considered
(see Appendix, Note 8). Conditional on receipt, the
average displaced worker receives $8,545 in pension
income. This amount does not vary dramatically
whether the worker is reemployed or not. Relative
to the average earnings loss for a displaced worker
who is reemployed ($10,312), an early pension ben-
efit would replace most of the lost income. How-
ever, for a worker who was displaced and not reem-
ployed, the average amount of pension income
would probably replace a relatively small fraction of
their prior earnings. Considering the average dis-
placed worker's earnings on the prior job of $32,310,

average pension income for a displaced worker of
$8,545 would replace 26%. This provides a rough
calculation of income replacement for a displaced
worker who is not reemployed.
When the labor force status of displaced workers
was considered in Table 4, those ages 56 through 60
were most likely to leave the labor force. The highest
rate of exit from the labor force was for the older
group of non-Whites. Table 7 shows that this older
group (56-60) is not more likely to receive pension
income and that none of the older minority displaced
workers are electing to receive pension income.
Based on this evidence, the receipt of private
pension income does not appear to be a sizable
influence on decisions to exit the labor force except
for males. The low rates of pension receipt among
women and minorities and the modest amounts of
income involved are inconsistent with the high
rates at which they exit the labor force.
Although personal earnings fall significantly and
are not offset to a great degree by the receipt of
pension income, the overall impact of displacement
should be offset to some extent by income received
by other members of the household. Table 8 exam-
ines the average incomes of households which con-
tain current workers, all workers displaced in 1990,
and those displaced in 1990 and reemployed (see
Appendix, Note 9). The figures presented are for
total household income from all sources. The aver-
age household income for current workers in 1991
was $59,924. Households of displaced workers on
average had total incomes which were $14,530
lower. The difference is somewhat smaller for
households where the displaced worker was reem-
ployed, $11,000. These comparisons suggest that the
typical household that contains a displaced worker
experiences a sizable (24%) loss in income.

It should be pointed out that this is an ex post
comparison which assumes that the households
containing a displaced worker had similar total
incomes to those that did not prior to the displace-
ment. This appears to be a reasonable assumption.
The average displaced worker experienced a reduc-
tion in labor earnings of $12,497. The difference in
the household incomes of the average current
worker and the average displaced worker is similar
to this amount ($14,530).
Across the demographic groups in Table 8, house-
holds which contain a female displaced worker
receive less income than households containing a
male displaced worker. Similarly, households con-
taining a non-White displaced worker receive less
income than households containing a White dis-

seen in the at-risk group. Attributing these differen-

Another area where family members may be of
assistance is in the replacement of health care cov-
erage. Table 9 examines rates of health care cover-

from their own employer relative to 80% from their
own employer or their spouse's. Prior to displace-
ment, rates of health insurance coverage from one's
own employer are not significantly different be-
tween Whites and non-Whites although women
appear to be less likely to have their own coverage
than men. Minorities are less likely to have spousal
coverage than Whites.
For displaced workers, the rate of health insurance
coverage from their own employer is 32%. The group
with the lowest rate of coverage is non-Whites at
26%. Considering coverage from their own em-
ployer or their spouse, 59% of displaced workers
have health insurance, 21% points less than for all
workers. Minority workers also have the lowest rate
of coverage including spousal policies, 38%.
Given the drop in personal and household in-
comes associated with job displacement and the
need of households to replace other nonwage ben-
efits such as health insurance, households of dis-
placed workers would be expected to slow down
their rate of asset accumulation towards retirement
and to perhaps begin spending down assets in
order to maintain their lifestyles. Table 10 provides
information on the household net worths of all
workers who were at risk of displacement, all work-
ers who were displaced, and those who were dis-
placed and reeemployed. The households of work-
ers who were displaced and reemployed on average
have a net worth which is $68,422 lower than the
at-risk group. When all displaced workers are con-
sidered, the difference in average net worths be-
come larger ($86,310). Households containing a
non-White displaced worker have an average net

worth ($115,196) which is 46% less than for similar
Whites ($228,438) (see Appendix, Note 10). How-
ever, a similar pattern is observed in the group of
at-risk workers so the differences following dis-
placement should be interpreted with caution. Also,
since these are ex post comparisons, it should be
borne in mind that an implicit assumption is that
households containing displaced workers had simi-
lar assets to those which do not prior to displace-
ment. Nonetheless, Table 10 shows that the average
minority household is not in as strong a financial
position to deal with the impacts of displacement as
the average White household.
Conclusion
In many respects, the evidence regarding the inci-
dence of job displacement and its economic impacts
upon older workers provided in this article mirror
the findings of the broader literature on job dis-
placement. Job displacement appears to be spread
proportionately across occupations and industries.
Prior job tenure and education both appear to play a
role in determining who is displaced.
Vol. 38, No. 1,1998 15
Following displacement, the average loss in earn-
ings for displaced and reemployed workers (30%)
lies at the upper end of the range of equivalent esti-
mates reported by prior studies (10 to 25%) as
would be expected given the greater seniority of
the age cohort examined. When displaced workers
who are not reemployed are included, the esti-
mated loss in earnings rises to 39%. At the time of
survey for the 1992 HRS, a sizable fraction of those
displaced in 1990 and 1991 were not reemployed
(27%), and this suggests that studies which exclude
these individuals when measuring the impact of job
displacement understate its effects. There is also lit-
tle evidence that the 10% of the sample who leaves
the labor force after being displaced are replacing
lost earnings through pension income as only 13%
of them qualify for private pensions and, of that
group, about one fifth take the benefit.
Although the typical displaced worker experi-
ences a sizable loss in personal earnings, their fam-
ily circumstances appear to buffer the decline in
their economic well-being. Labor earnings for the
typical displaced worker decline by 39%, while their
total family income appears to decline by about
24%. Families also play an important role in increas-
ing the availability of health insurance to displaced
workers as they do for nondisplaced workers; 27%
of displaced workers obtain their health insurance
through their spouse.
While the decline in earnings of the individual is
typically buffered by other sources of income in the
household, an average reduction of 24% is still
quite large. The study offers some evidence that
asset accumulation among the families of displaced
workers is impacted heavily by this loss of income.
This topic merits further research.
These large reductions in personal and family
income and the resulting effects on assets are trou-
bling and may have important implications for the
post retirement well being of all displaced workers.
An additional concern is the apparent pattern ex-
hibited throughout the analysis of disproportionate
hardship experienced by the non-White members
of the sample. Relative to Whites, the non-White
group experiences a greater incidence of displace-
ment, a lower probability of reemployment, lower
personal earnings, lower household incomes, and
lower rates of health insurance following displace-
ment. It is also apparent that the non-White families
have less asset holdings to serve as a buffer until
social security income becomes available. While
these patterns are explained in part by lower educa-
tion and job tenure, minorities, as a group, are none-
theless worse off in every dimension examined fol-
lowing displacement. Examining the impact of
displacement across these groups following retire-
ment will be the subject of future research.

1. Individuals in the sample who were age 61 were not
included. If displaced at age 61, they would be most
likely to forego a job search and wait to collect social
security benefits. Due to their close proximity to
social security eligibility, they are not included in the
study.
2. It should be recognized that the measures included
for tenure and work experience are highly collinear
with age. This explains the omission of that variable.
The studies all find that workers with greater tenure
prior to displacement suffer larger earnings losses.
This is similar to saying that older workers would be
expected to have larger earnings losses.
3. When the numbers in the tables are reported as pro-
portions, I will refer to them at times as rates or per-
centages and accordingly multiply them by 100.
4. The formula for making these comparisons assuming
independence of the table elements is the difference
in two table elements divided by the square root of
the sum of their squared standard errors. For the
remainder of the article, significance will refer to the
.05 level.
5. The totals and proportions do not sum exactly be-
cause labor force status could not be assigned to
three observations. Thus, the total is slightly larger
than the sum of the components.
6. This sample of workers displaced in 1990 is also used
in the comparisons of total household income found
in Table 8. The sample sizes described here for Table
5 are the same as those used in Table 8.
7. Other possibilities considered were receipt of Sur-
vivors and Disability benefits as well as lump sum
severance payments. Less than 2% of the sample of
16 The Gerontologist
displaced workers received any of these types of pay-
ments. Coresidence with children and cash transfers
were also considered as a family response. Again, less
than 2% of the sample of displaced workers resided
with a child or received a cash transfer.
8. These calculations are not provided at a more disag-
gregated level because the low takeup rate for pen-
sion benefits leaves few positive observations.
9. The subgroup of workers displaced in 1990 which is
considered here is the same as was used in the calcu-
lation of individual earnings contained in Table 5. By
considering only those workers displaced in 1990,
their total household incomes in 1991 can be assured
not to reflect any earnings from the job from which
they were displaced. A description of the underlying
number of observations available is provided in the
text with the discussion of the contents of Table 5.
10. One concern with the information contained in Table
10 is that among some of the demographic groups,
displaced workers who are reemployed have lower
average net worths than among all displaced workers.
However, in each instance where this occurs, the
associated standard errors indicate that the two fig-
ures are not significantly different.
