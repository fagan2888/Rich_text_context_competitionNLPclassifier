SUMMARY
Short sleep duration is associated with excess body mass among
adolescents and young adults. The mechanisms theorized to drive that
association suggest that persistent exposure to short sleep should be
associated with greater accumulations of body mass. We use prospec-
tive cohort data from four waves of the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent to Adult Health (1994­2009; n = 14 800) to examine asso-
ciations between cumulative exposure to short sleep throughout
adolescence and early adulthood and obesity and elevated waist
circumference outcomes. We compare several clinical and distribution-
based standards of short sleep to assess which measures are associ-
ated most strongly with body mass. Cumulative exposure to short sleep
exhibits dose­response associations with obesity and elevated waist
circumference. Relative to respondents with no instances of short sleep,
those who slept À0.50 standard deviations or less than the age and sex-
specific average sleep hours in all four waves had 1.45 [95% confidence
interval (CI): 1.03, 2.04] times the odds of being obese and 1.45 (95% CI:
1.02, 2.06) times the odds of having an elevated waist circumference.
Our findings suggest that cumulative exposure to short sleep during
adolescence and young adulthood may play an important role in the
etiology of obesity and elevated waist circumference during this
important developmental period.
INTRODUCTION
A growing body of evidence finds that shorter sleep durations
among children and adolescents are associated with higher
body mass, adverse cardiovascular and metabolic outcomes
and unhealthy diets (Javaheri et al., 2008; Kruger et al.,
2014; Larkin et al., 2005; Magee and Hale, 2012; Patel and
Hu, 2008; Reither et al., 2014; Taheri et al., 2004). Some
researchers have linked declines in average sleep time
among US children and adolescents to the increasing
prevalence of obesity (Calamaro et al., 2009; Chen et al.,
2008), and others promote additional sleep to help youth
maintain healthy weights (Taheri, 2006). However, most
research on the association between sleep and body mass is
cross-sectional (Magee and Hale, 2012; Patel and Hu, 2008).
Existing longitudinal studies often focus on young children
(Lumeng et al., 2007; Reilly et al., 2005; Taveras et al.,
2008; Touchette et al., 2008) or adults (Chaput et al., 2008;
Patel et al., 2006), rather than on adolescents who experi-
ence developmental changes in sleep duration, height and
weight, and who have growing control over their sleep,
physical activity, diet and sedentary behaviours. Further,
longitudinal studies sometimes rely on small, regional sam-
ples (Agras et al., 2004; Landhuis et al., 2008; Taveras
et al., 2008; Touchette et al., 2008), and rarely consider long-
term exposures to short sleep.
Our first aim is to examine associations between cumula-
tive exposure to short sleep duration throughout adolescence
and early adulthood and body mass outcomes including
obesity and elevated waist circumference in early adulthood.
Short sleep duration may be linked to increased body mass
and adverse metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes through
pathways including hormonal dysregulation (Hitze et al.,
2008), changes in the quality and quantity of food consumed

J Sleep Res. (2015) 24, 629­638 Cumulative short sleep and body mass
(Beebe et al., 2013; Kruger et al., 2014) and reduced energy
expenditure (Mcknight-Eily et al., 2011). Each of those
pathways implies that persistent exposures to short sleep
over long time-periods will be associated more strongly with
body mass than short-term exposures.
Longitudinal studies often use sleep duration at one point
in time or average sleep duration from several time-points to
predict subsequent body mass (Agras et al., 2004; Landhuis
et al., 2008; Lumeng et al., 2007; Magee and Hale, 2012;
Patel and Hu, 2008; Reilly et al., 2005; Snell et al., 2007;
Suglia et al., 2014; Taveras et al., 2008), which obscures
heterogeneity in sleep duration over time. As a result,
longitudinal studies find inverse associations between sleep
duration and body mass among adolescents and young
adults (Lumeng et al., 2007), although that association is not
significant in several studies (Snell et al., 2007; Suglia et al.,
2014). We know of only one paper that specifically considers
cumulative exposure to short sleep. Touchette et al. (2008)
find that 5% of children in a representative sample from
Qu
ebec province, Canada are persistent short sleepers
between the ages of 5 months and 6 years; those children
have higher odds of overweight and obesity at age 6 than
intermittent short sleepers. We extend prior research by
examining cumulative exposure to short sleep through
adolescence and early adulthood.
Our second aim is to explore how various measures of
cumulative exposure to short sleep duration are associated
with body mass outcomes. Standards that distinguish
adequate sleep from short sleep among adolescents and
young adults are informed insufficiently by a robust evi-
dence base. Longitudinal studies of children and adoles-
cents that assess sleep duration with single continuous
(Agras et al., 2004; Lumeng et al., 2007) or categorical
measures (Reilly et al., 2005; Snell et al., 2007; Suglia
et al., 2014) offer little consensus about how much sleep is
necessary at different ages to help prevent weight gain and
obesity. Indeed, Matricciani and colleagues assert: `sleep
recommendations are still being issued in the acknowledged
absence of meaningful evidence' (Matricciani et al., 2012:
553).
We compare multiple standards for adequate sleep. First,
we consider the National Sleep Foundation's (NSF) recom-
mendations of at least 9 h of sleep for those aged 6­13, at
least 8 h of sleep for those aged 14­17 and at least 7 h of
sleep for those aged 18­25 (Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). NSF
standards derive from expert panels' reviews of the literature,
but have not been validated in longitudinal studies of body
mass. Secondly, we consider a 7-h threshold for adequate
sleep. Many studies of adults define short sleep as fewer
than 7 h per night (Cappuccio et al., 2008; Chaput et al.,
2008). The NSF report provides a rationale for using the 7-h
standard among youth by cautioning that the harm associ-
ated with sleeping fewer than 7 h among children aged 6­17
outweighs any benefits, and is `not recommended'
(Hirshkowitz et al., 2015). Finally, we consider measures
derived from age- and sex-specific distributions of sleep
duration in the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to
Adult Health (Add Health)--a nationally representative cohort.
DATA AND METHODS
We employ prospective cohort data from all four waves of
Add Health, collected in 1994­95 (wave 1, mean
age = 15.9), 1996 (wave 2, mean age = 16.9), 2001­02
(wave 3, mean age = 22.3) and 2008­09 (wave 4, mean
age = 28.8). In wave 1, Add Health conducted brief inter-
views with a nationally representative sample of more than
90 000 students enrolled in grades 7­12 in US schools, and
then selected a much smaller subsample for detailed
longitudinal follow-up (Chantala, 2006). Add Health conducts
physical examinations of adolescents, as well as in-home
surveys with parents and adolescents, on topics including
health, academics, romantic and friend relationships, employ-
ment and family formation. Our analyses focus on the 14 800
young adults aged 24.3­34.7 years who were interviewed in
wave 4, and their data from prior survey waves. The
response rate for eligible respondents was more than 77%
in each wave, but retention was reduced temporarily by the
intentional exclusion of high school seniors in wave 1 from
wave 2. Wave 4 data were reweighted to be nationally
representative of the population of adults in 2008­09 who
were enrolled in grades 7­12 during 1994­95 (wave 1)
(Chantala, 2006).
Outcome variables
Outcome variables are measured in wave 4 (Entzel et al.,
2009). Body mass index (BMI) is calculated from measured
heights and weights, and is dichotomized as obese
(kg m2  30) and non-obese (kg m2 < 30). Waist circumfer-
ence is measured at the superior border of the iliac crest, and
is dichotomized as those who are at or above the 75th
percentile, by gender, and those who are below the 75th
percentile. We estimate the 75th percentile of waist circum-
ference separately for Asians and non-Asians (Grundy et al.,
2005). Models that predict waist circumference also adjust for
height at wave 4. We dichotomized the body mass measures
because we sought body mass thresholds that have estab-
lished associations with adverse outcomes.
Cumulative short sleep duration
Sleep duration is self-reported. In waves 1 and 2, respon-
dents report their usual sleep duration in hours. In waves 3
and 4, respondents report the hour and minute they usually
go to sleep and then awake on (a) days that they attend work
or school-related activities (`weekdays') and (b) days that
they do not have to wake up at a certain time (`weekends').
We multiply sleep hours on weekdays by 5/7 and on
weekends by 2/7, and then add the resulting figures to
create a daily weighted average of usual sleep hours. Waves
3 and 4 data yield negative sleep hours or implausibly high
ª 2015 European Sleep Research Society
630 P. M. Krueger et al.
sleep hours (e.g. 16+ h) for 3 and 5% of respondents,
respectively. Most misreports occur among respondents who
report `12' as the hour of waking or sleep onset, suggesting
that they confused 12:00 hours (noon) and 12:00 hours
(midnight). By correcting these misreports, we obtain similar
correlations in sleep hours across each pair of consecutive
waves.
We create the following measures of cumulative exposure
to short sleep duration from usual sleep hours in each wave.
NSF standard
Respondents receive a 0 in each wave if they meet the NSF
age-specific standard for adequate sleep (at least 9 h for
those aged 6­13, at least 8 h for those aged 14­17, and at
least 7 h for those aged 18­25), and 1 otherwise (Hirshkowitz
et al., 2015). Summing across waves provides a count of the
number of waves in which respondents fail to meet the NSF
standard for adequate sleep.
Seven-hour standard
Respondents receive a 0 in each wave if they sleep 7 h or
more, and 1 otherwise. Summing the four items provides a
count of the number of waves in which respondents fail to
sleep at least 7 h.
Distribution-based measures
We use standardized residuals to indicate how much less a
given respondent sleeps compared to the average for age-
and sex-specific peers, based on the distribution of sleep
hours in the Add Health data. We begin by estimating a
hierarchical linear model (with wave-specific observations
nested within respondents) that predicts average sleep
duration with age, sex and the wave of observation. We
include quadratic splines for age, with knots at ages 15, 20
and 25 in the best-fitting model (Marsh and Cormier, 2002),
and include interactions between sex and the age variables.
Our model, shown in Appendix S1, finds that residual
variability in usual sleep duration increases from ages 11­
14 to 19­22, and then declines throughout ages 31­34.
Ancillary analyses found that sex differences in residual
variability were trivial in magnitude, and were thus excluded
from our final models.
We square the within-individual and between-individual (by
age) residual standard deviations, sum them, and take the
square root to calculate a standard deviation (SD) for
sleep duration, conditional on the variables included in the
model (e.g. conditional SD for ages 11­14 = 1.28 h =
[0.602 + 1.132]). Then we sum the within-individual and
between-individual residuals and divide them by the age-
specific conditional standard deviations to create a standard-
ized residual (Snijders and Bosker, 2011). A standardized
residual of ­1 indicates that a respondent's usual sleep
duration is 1 SD below peers of the same age and sex.
We use the age- and sex-specific standardized residuals to
consider the À0.25 SD, À0.50 SD, À0.75 SD and À1.00 SD
standards. In each wave, we create four dichotomous
variables (one for each standard) that equal 1 if the residuals
are À0.25 or smaller, À0.50 or smaller, À0.75 or smaller or
À1.00 or smaller, respectively. The dichotomous variables
equal 0 if respondents have residuals that are above the
threshold for a given standard in a given wave. Summing the
dichotomous variables creates a count of the number of
waves that respondents fail to meet a given standard for
adequate sleep.
Confounders
Numerous variables are associated with sleep duration, but
the causal ordering of those variables is unclear (Krueger and
Friedman, 2009). Thus, we focus on confounders that are
most clearly exogenous. All models adjust for demographic
variables. Age in years in wave 4 is coded continuously. We
do not find evidence of a non-linear association between age
and body mass for the ages examined. Sex is coded
dichotomously. Race/ethnicity is coded categorically as
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic, Asian,
Native American and other.
Subsequent models adjust for additional potential con-
founders. Nativity is coded dichotomously as US versus
foreign-born. Among women, a categorical variable indicates
those who were never pregnant, previously pregnant or
currently pregnant at wave 4. Models that exclude women
who are currently pregnant are virtually identical to those
shown herein. Years of education among mothers and
fathers are measured continuously and range from 0 (never
attended school) to 18 (any post-baccalaureate education).
Total family income in 1994 is measured continuously; we
add 1 and take the natural log to account for the diminishing
association between income and health as income increases
(Krueger and Burgard, 2011). Parental marital status at wave
1 is coded categorically as never married, married or
previously married. Dichotomous variables indicate whether
mothers or fathers ever smoked cigarettes [`Has your
(mother/father) ever smoked cigarettes?'] or were obese
[`Respondent's (mother/father) has obesity?'] at wave 1. Like
other proxy reports, adolescent reports of mothers' and
fathers' smoking and obesity may be measured with error
and, thus, might account incompletely for confounding of the
association between cumulative exposure to short sleep and
body mass outcomes. We use information about biological
parents where available; otherwise we use information about
the current mother or father figure in the household.
Sensitivity analyses exclude adolescents who are obese at
baseline. Obesity in wave 1 is determined by comparing BMI
to age- and sex-specific standards provided by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Kuczmarski
et al., 2002). To correct potential biases in self-reported
heights and weights in wave 1, we employ wave 2 data that
include both self-reported and measured heights and

self-reported and measured items by age, race/ethnicity and
sex, and adjust our wave 1 measures accordingly.
Analyses
When arraying our data such that there is a row for each
respondent in our analyses, and a column for each variable,
only 5.2% of the cells have missing values. Despite this small
percentage of missing data, listwise deletion of missing data
would result in the exclusion of more than one-third of our
sample because many respondents are missing on only one
of the numerous variables in our analyses. Respondents may
have missing data due to wave non-response (i.e. non-
participation in a given wave of the study) or item
non-response (i.e. refusal to respond to an item when
respondents participated in a given wave). All the respon-
dents in our analyses participated in both waves 1 and 4.
Thus, in terms of wave non-response, 100% of eligible
respondents participated in at least two waves, 94% of
eligible respondents participated in three waves and 63.7% of
eligible respondents participated in all four waves. Item non-
response is rare for our key variables. In wave 4, only 0.5% of
respondents are missing on sleep duration, 0.1% are missing
on BMI and 1% are missing on waist circumference.
We use multiple imputation to preserve our sample size
and to reduce the potential for biased estimates due to
missing data. Multiple imputation fills in each piece of missing
data with multiple values that are drawn from a distribution of
probable values. Multiple imputation methods assume that
data are missing at random (MAR), conditional on observed
covariates. In contrast, the listwise deletion of missing values
relies on a less plausible assumption that data are missing
completely at random (MCAR), unconditional on observed
covariates (Little and Rubin, 2002). The MAR assumption is
most plausible when numerous variables are included in the
imputation model. We include more than 60 variables in our
imputation model (including sleep and body mass variables,
as well as variables associated with sleep and body mass) to
provide information about the probable distribution of missing
values (Moons et al., 2006). We create 100 imputations
using chained equations methods. Because all respondents
in our study are interviewed in at least two waves, we use
both cross-sectional and longitudinal variation to impute
sleep duration within individuals and over time. Simulation
studies show that multiple imputation results in less biased
results than listwise deletion of missing data (Lee and Carlin,
2010). In our data, estimates that use multiple imputation
rather than listwise deletion provide similar point estimates
but narrower confidence intervals due to enhanced statistical
power.
We use multivariate logistic regression models to estimate
associations between measures of cumulative short sleep
duration and the wave 4 measures of obesity and elevated
waist circumference. We pool males and females in all
models--although average sleep duration varies by sex, we
found no sex differences in the association between cumu-
lative exposure to short sleep and obesity or waist circum-
ference. We use Taylor-series expansion to obtain robust
standard errors, given the complex sampling frame employed
by Add Health (Korn and Graubard, 1999). We use STATA
software for all analyses (StataCorp, 2013).
Ethics committee approval
Staff at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill
received Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval for the
Add Health data collection and attained consent from survey
respondents. The IRB at the University of Colorado Denver/
Anschutz Medical Campus further approved our use of the
de-identified version of the Add Health data for the current
project.
RESULTS
Table 1 presents age- and sex-specific average sleep
durations in Add Health, as well as the distribution-based
thresholds for short sleep (derived from the model in
Appendix S1). Average sleep duration among females decli-
nes from 9.3 h at age 11 to 7.7 h by age 18, hovers around
7.7 h between ages 18 and 28, and then declines to 7.3 h by
age 34. Compared to females, males have slightly longer
sleep durations before age 18, and have somewhat shorter
sleep durations after age 19.
Table 2 shows that, by wave 4, only one-third of respon-
dents are normal weight and slightly more than one-third of
respondents are obese. By definition, approximately one-
quarter of respondents have waist circumferences at or
above the 75th percentile. Few respondents have short sleep
durations in all four waves. Approximately 3% of respondents
report short sleep in all four waves according to the NSF
standard, 5% report short sleep in all four waves according to
the À0.25 SD standard and fewer than 2% report short sleep
in all four waves according to the 7-h and À0.75 SD
standards. Further, few respondents meet standards for
adequate sleep hours in all four waves. Just 28% of
respondents meet the NSF standard in all four waves and
45% meet the 7-h standard in all four waves. A majority of
respondents (62%) report adequate sleep in every wave only
when considering the À1.00 SD standard.
Compare measures of short sleep
Table 3 presents models for the odds of obesity (models 1
and 2) and elevated waist circumference (models 3 and 4).
Each panel reports results for a different measure of short
sleep. Each measure of cumulative exposure to short sleep
has a graded association with the odds of being obese
(model 1) or of having an elevated waist circumference
(model 3) in wave 4. The trend is statistically significant for
each sleep measure, but those who are short sleepers in one
wave based on the NSF (a) or À0.25 SD (c) standards do not
ª 2015 European Sleep Research Society

have significantly higher odds of elevated body mass than
those who are not short sleepers in any wave.
Models 2 and 4 in Table 3 examine whether short sleep
occurs prior to body mass outcomes by excluding respon-
dents who were obese at wave 1. Compared to the first
model for each outcome, the odds ratios for the cumulative
sleep variables are slightly attenuated, although two or three
of the indicator variables remain significant for the 7-h (b),
À0.50 SD (d) and À0.75 SD (e) standards.
Cumulative exposure to short sleep and body mass
Table 4 shows models that predict the odds of obesity and
elevated waist circumference with the NSF, 7-h, À0.50 SD
and À0.75 SD standards, while adjusting for additional
confounders. We exclude the À0.25 SD standard because
it had the weakest association with the elevated body mass
outcomes of all the distribution-based measures, and we
exclude the À1.00 SD standard because repeated exposure
to extremely short sleep is rare (see Table 1). Each measure
of cumulative exposure to short sleep has a graded associ-
ation with the odds of obesity (models 1­4) and elevated
waist circumference (models 5­8), although two or three of
the indicators for the NSF and À0.75 SD standards fell from
significance.
Figure 1 illustrates the dose­response association
between the predicted probability of being obese and
cumulative exposure to short sleep. We calculate the
predicted probabilities from model 2 (7-h standard) and
model 3 (À0.50 SD standard) of Table 4, when the covari-
ates are set to their mean values. Consistent with the results
in Table 4, the association between cumulative exposure to
short sleep and the probability of being obese is slightly
stronger for the 7-h standard than for the À0.50 SD standard,
but the 95% confidence intervals are somewhat wider.
DISCUSSION
The hypothesized hormonal (Hitze et al., 2008) and beha-
vioural (Beebe et al., 2013; Mcknight-Eily et al., 2011)
mechanisms suggest that persistent exposures to short
sleep will have stronger associations with body mass than
short-term exposures. We find a dose­response association
that is consistent with the hypothesis that sleep duration is
associated causally with body mass, although we cannot rule
out the possibility of unobserved confounders with observa-
tional data. After adjusting for numerous confounders, those
who report short sleep in all four waves, compared to those
who do not report short sleep in any wave, have increased
odds of obesity and elevated waist circumference that are

Cumulative exposure to short sleep 633
comparable in magnitude to the odds ratio for obesity when
comparing blacks to whites.
Two measures of short sleep perform similarly well. The 7-
h standard that is often used among adults (Cappuccio et al.,
2008; Chaput et al., 2008) is also predictive of obesity and
elevated waist circumference when applying that standard to
adolescents. Although the 7-h standard fails to consider the
potential for changing sleep needs throughout adolescence
and early adulthood, it is easy to use in clinical settings as a
marker for obesity risk. Our findings affirm the NSF report,
which asserts that sleeping fewer than 7 h per night is
particularly harmful for children aged 6­17 (Hirshkowitz et al.,
2015). Failure to meet the ­0.50 SD standard is also
associated persistently with body mass outcomes in early
adulthood, and reflects smoothly changing sleep needs
throughout the ages examined.
Our distribution-based approach has limitations similar to
other approaches that classify individuals based on the
distribution of their peers (e.g. the CDC's definition of
overweight and obesity among children). In our case,
definitions of `short sleep' are based on an empirical
distribution, even though the average child may not be
getting adequate sleep (Calamaro et al., 2009; Chen et al.,
2008). Nevertheless, we tested various distribution-based
thresholds and found that children who occasionally sleep
À0.25 SD or less than the average for their age and sex do
not have consistently elevated body mass outcomes. Thus,
adolescents and young adults who report the average sleep
duration for their age and sex group appear to have adequate
sleep--at least in terms of body mass outcomes. Further,
distribution-based methods provide a smoothly-changing set
of values for adequate sleep, rather than the sharp changes

Health provides repeated measures of sleep duration and
objective measures of height and weight. Separate analyses
(not shown) show similar results when adjusting for `current'
sleep duration at wave 4. Ancillary analyses (not shown) also
find similar results when examining the waist-to-height ratio
as an outcome. Our study is limited by relying upon self-
reported sleep duration. However, respondents with higher
BMIs who are most likely to experience sleep apnea may be
most likely to overstate their sleep durations (Weaver et al.,
2004), which would tend to bias our results towards smaller
associations.
In sum, cumulative exposure to short sleep appears to be
an important risk factor for obesity and elevated waist
circumference. The dose­response association between

repeated (rather than one-time) exposures to short sleep
duration provides evidence that is consistent with a causal
association between sleep duration and body mass out-
comes in adolescence and early adulthood. Our findings are
particularly important given mixed results in existing longitu-
dinal studies of adolescents (Lumeng et al., 2007; Snell
et al., 2007; Suglia et al., 2014). Adolescence is a period
marked by rapid changes in weight and sleep duration, which
may presage adverse cardiovascular and metabolic out-
comes throughout adulthood. Our findings strengthen the
case for clinical, public health and policy interventions that
focus upon ensuring adequate sleep throughout adoles-
cence.
