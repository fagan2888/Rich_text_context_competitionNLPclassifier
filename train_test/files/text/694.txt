Abstract: Although the importance of exercise as a public health issue is increasingly
recognised, little attention has been paid to exercise in very old people. We examined
exercise patterns in 1788 subjects aged 70 years and over who were participating in the
Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing. In the two weeks before interview,39 per cent
of subjects had taken no exercise and only four per cent had exercised vigorously. When
compared with those who took no exercise, exercisers were more likely to be male and
younger, to self-report better health, to be former smokers and regular alcohol users.
Mortality rates at two years follow-up were inversely related to the level of exercise at
baseline. This research indicates that exercise is important for the very old as well as
younger groups. (Aust iV ZJPublir Health 1997;21: 155-8)
N impressive list of health benefits accrues to
elderly people who exercise regularly. They
include better cardiovascular function,l.?
lower morbidity and mortality from cardiovascular
less body fat,' better lipid profile," slowed
progression of osteoporosis,'-" better balance and
coordination,"' better functional capacity,"," and
possibly better nutrition and sleep.'" Regular exer-
cise in older people also reduces anxiety,depression
and other psychological disorders."-'" There is some
evidence that cognition improves," but this is not a
consistent finding.I6Exercise also improves quality
of life.':'," Despite the convincing evidence of its
benefits, exercise levels tend to fall with age" and
this trend accelerates after retirement.'!' Two
decades ago, relatively few elderly Australians exer-
cised regularly."' Since then, the promotion of
health and fitness through exercise has become an
important public health issue in Australia as else-
where and there is some evidence to suggest that
exercise patterns are now changing for the better."'
Most of the descriptive and intervention studies
on exercise in older people have focused on the
'young old' (those aged under 70 years) while
neglecting older people. The exclusion of people
aged over 70 years is inappropriate for two reasons.
First, the size of this group is rapidly expanding in
both relative and absolute terms. Second, many of
the problems that can be attenuated by exercise are
most prevalent in this age group.
We studied exercise patterns and their correlates
among people participating in the Australian
Longitudinal Study of Ageing (ALSA),a large study
of the determinants of health and wellbeing in peo-
ple aged over 70 years. We correlated exercise pat-
terns with demographic and life-style characteristics
at the time of entry to the study. Participants were

followed up for two years, thereby allowing us to
relate exercise patterns at baseline to subsequent
mortality.
Methods
The Australian Longitudinal Study of Ageing is a
large epidemiological study which aims to identify
the determinants of health and social wellbeing in
old age. The study is described in detail elsewhere."
In brief, a stratified random sample of people aged
70 years and over and living in the Adelaide Statis-
tical Division (the wider City of Adelaide), South
Australia, were interviewed in detail at their normal
place of residence (either in the community or in
residential care) about their demographic, medical,
psychological,social and economic characteristics.
A random sample was initially drawn from the
database of the South Australian electoral roll. From
this sample, eligible persons (defined as those per-
sons 70 years and over as at 30June 1992,who were
at the time resident in the Adelaide Statistical
Division) and their spouses (aged 6
.
5 and over), as
well as other household members aged 70 and over,
were asked to participate. The electoral roll sample
was stratified to provide estimated equal numbers in
five-yearage and sex cohorts from 70 years upwards.
Males were deliberately oversampled to compensate
for higher mortality over the period of the study.
A total sample of 3263 people was drawn from the
electoral roll, of whom 2705 were eligible for inclu-
sion in the study and 1477 agreed to participate.
From within the households of those eligible for
inclusion in the study,879 spouses were also eligible
for inclusion and of them 597 agreed to participate.
Of 24 other eligible household members, 13 agreed
to participate. Thus, 55 per cent of the primary sub-
jects identified through the electoral roll and 67 per
cent of the spouses and other household members
agreed to participate in the study. In total, 2087
interviews were conducted from September 1992 to
February 1993.
Face-to-face interviews were carried out by a team

of interviewerswho were all trained in intensivework-
shops before interviewing. More than half of the
interviewers also worked as interviewers for the
Australian Bureau of Statistics. Two supenisors regu-
larly accompanied interviewers to ensure the stan-
dardisation of interviews. Interpreters were employed
as needed to assist with foreign language inteniews.
A 12-month follow-up interviewwas conducted by
telephone, and among the eligible participants, a 91
per cent response rate was achieved. At 24 months,
a full re-interviewwas carried out and among surviv-
ing participants the response rate was 94 per cent.
This paper deals with the 1799 community-dwelling
respondents aged 70 years or over who were first
interviewed in 1992-93.
Of the 733 items in the baseline questionnaire,
nine related to exercise that the person had under-
taken in the two weeks before the survev.These ques-
tions were developed by Australia's National Heart
Foundation for use in a 20- to 69-year-old popula-
tion."' Four questions dealt with the type of exercise
and five with the quantity of exercise undertaken.
Specifically, respondents were asked if they had: 1.
engaged in vigorous exercise which was defined as
`exercisewhich made you breathe harder or puff or
pant, such as tennis,jogging, etc.';2. engaged in `less
vigorous exercise for recreation, sport or health/fit-
ness purposes which did not make you breathe
harder or puff or pant'; 3. `walked for recreation or
exercise';or 4. engaged in `tasksaround the house ...
involving moderate to heavy physical exertion which
made you breathe harder or puff and pant'. In the
analysisof the responses, those answeringyes to ques-
tion 1 were classified as `vigorous exercisers'; those
answering no to question 1 and yes to 2, 3 or 4 were
classified as `lessvigorous exercisers';those answering
no to all four questions were classified as `nonexercis-
ers'.Those who answered yes to one or more of ques-
tions 1 to 4 were asked supplementary questions
about the frequency of exercise undertaken. The
respondents who answeredyes to question 1were also
asked about the duration of exercise sessions.
To assess subsequent mortality, we searched
South Australia'sdeath records, taking 31 May 1995
as the censoring date. If a respondent was still alive
at the censoring date, the time in days from the date
of their baseline interview was calculated. If the
respondent had died in the intervening period, the
number of days he or she had survived after the
baseline interview was computed. A Cox regression
taking survival in days as the response
variable, was fitted to the data. Initially, only exer-
cise status and the interaction between exercise sta-
tus and time were included in the model so that the
assumption of proportional hazards for exercisers
and nonexercisers over the course of the study
could be Subsequently, a second Cox
regression model incorporating a number of inde-
pendent variables was fitted to the data. The inde-
pendent variables used were sex, age, marital status,
self-rated health, number of chronic medical condi-
tions, smoking status, alcohol consumption, age at
leaving school and exercise status.
All analyseswere carried out using SPSS."-`x
Results
Of the 1799respondents, 1788people indicated the
extent to which they had exercised in the two weeks
preceding the interview. Using the criteria
described, there were 1092 exercisers, of whom 71
(4.0 per cent) were `vigorous exercisers' and 1021
(57.1 per cent) were `less vigorous exercisers'. The
remaining 696 (38.9 per cent) were `nonexercisers'.
The vigorous exercisers had undertaken a mean of
6.7 (standard deviation (SD) 0.6) sessions of vigor-
ous exercise in the previous two weeks with an aver-
age duration of 56.2 (SD 7.2) minutes per session.
The average number of sessions undertaken by the
less vigorous exercisers was 8.9 (SD 0.2); no data
were collected on the average duration of these ses-
sions.
Exercisers had a mean age of 77.6 (SD 5.6) years;
this was significantlyless than the mean age of 79.5
(SD 6.1) years among nonexercisers (t17*,,
= 6.9;
P < 0.001). Other demographic and lifestyle charac-
teristics of exercisers and nonexercisers are com-
pared in Table 1. Males were more likely to exercise

than females; there were no differences for other
demographic variables such as marital status and
level of schooling. The relationship between self-
rated health and exercise status was positive and
highly significant.
With regard to life-stylefactors, there was a signif-
icant positive relationship between smoking and
exercise status,with former smokers rather than cur-
rent or never smokers being most likely to exercise.
People who had never smoked were least likely to
exercise; this was in part due to the higher number
of women who were both sedentary and had never
smoked. A significant positive association between
exercise and frequency of alcohol consumption was
also found.
At two-year follow-up, 189 (10.6 per cent) of the
study group had died. These comprised two (2.8 per
cent) of the 'vigorous exercisers', 78 (7.6 per cent)
of the 'less vigorous exercisers' and 109 (15.7 per
cent) of the 'nonexercisers'. The difference in mor-
tality rates between nonexercisers and others was
highly significant (x'= 31.24, 1 df, P < 0.001).
Survival analyses compared the pooled group of
vigorous and less vigorous exercisers with nonexer-
cisers. The pooled group of exercisers was used
because the small number of vigorous (compared to
less vigorous) exercisers could result in unreliable
parameter estimates for the vigorous group. The
first Cox regression model fitted to the data revealed
a significant difference in the surcival function
between exercisers and nonexercisers. Figure 1
shows the cumulative survival function for the fitted
model. Survival curves for exercisers and nonexer-
cisers started to diverge at about three months and
progressively diverged thereafter. Table 2 gives the
significant predictors of the survival function as
identified by the second Cox regression model, as
outlined in the methods section. An estimate o
f the
hazard ratio for mortality for each variable, along
with the 9
.
5 per cent confidence interval, was
extracted from this model. The first level of each cat-
egorical variable was taken as a reference category.
Table 2 shows that respondents who were female,
who reported excellent or very good health, who for-
merly or never smoked, or who exercised, had a

greater number of chronic medical conditions were
associatecl with a diminished probability of survival.
The hazard ratio for death for those respondents
undertaking no exercise was 1.7 times that for the
respondents who exercised.
Discussion
Despite the recognised benefits to health of exer-
cise, many elderly people exercise infrequently, if at
all. In this study, almost 40 per cent of those sur-
veyed had not exercised in the previous two weeks
and only 4 per cent had exercised vigorously.
Comparable data from large samples of elderly peo-
ple from Australia or elsewhere are lacking. How-
ever, in a study of middle-aged Australians, it was
estimated that only 15per cent took enough exercise
for cardiovascular protection and that 30 per cent
were totally sedentary." In this latter study, exercise
levels declined with age so that less than 8per cent of
people aged over 50 years were aerobically active.
Those least likely to exercise in our surveywere older
women. This finding is similar to that of other stud-
ies from Australia2'and elsewhere."' However, others
have found that men take more outdoor exercise
while women exercise more indoor~.'~".~''
We found a strong association between exercise
status at baseline and subsequent mortality such that
2.8 per cent ofvigorous exercisers and 15.7 per cent
of nonexercisers were dead at two-year follow-up.
However,association does not imply causality,and in
a cross-sectionalstudy such as this, confounding fac-
tors may operate. Those who exercised were
younger and had better self-reported health so that
better survival characteristics are to be expected. It
may be that short-term recall of exercise activity
reflects lifetime exercise patterns, and this could be
an important predictor of diminished risk of mor-

tality. In addition, our research identifies elderly
people who do not exercise to be a high-risk group
among whom one in six fail to survive two years.
Now that the benefits of exercising and the penal-
ties for not exercising are becoming clear, a strong
public health message is starting to emerge. Exercise
is important for everybody, even for those who are
well past the traditional retirement age. The Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention and the
American College of Sports Medicine have recently
revised earlier guidelines when recommending that
adults should accumulate 30 minutes or more of
moderate-intensity exercise on most and preferably
all, days of the week." One way to meet these stan-
dards is to walk 3 kni briskly;other examples of mod-
erate-intensity exercise include cycling, swimming,
calisthenics, racket sports, golf, fishing, canoeing,
home care, lawn mowing and home repair. Less
demanding programs may also be of value, and a
twice-weekly, six-month progressive walking pro-
gram has been shown to improve the fitness of
elderly women.''
The World Health Organization recently empha-
sised the importance of exercise for people of all age
groups 'including the oldest citizens' and stated that
'the responsibility for personal health ultimately lies
with the individual and family, but ... the promotion
of physical activity must be a part of public policy
because the implications are important and far-
reaching'.":' Owen and Bauman identified inability
and apathy to be the main barriers to exercise in
elderly people."4Now that the benefits of exercise in
old age are established, the next challenge is to
devise strategies to overcome these barriers and
then to implement and evaluate them.
