Economic models of life cycle behavior suggest that expectations about future events may affect savings, insurance,
and retirement planning. This article uses data from the first wave of the Health and Retirement Survey (HRS) to
examine how personal characteristics and health conditions influence expectations of nursing home use. Subjective
expectations of nursing home use are quite close to known probabilities of lifetime use. There are marked differ-
ences in the determinants of expectations for women and men that also conform to actual behavior. There is strong
evidence that women and men incorporate what is known about nursing home risk into their own expectations,
even many years prior to the time when they are most likely to need long-term care.
THERE is a growing body of literature on the incidence
of nursing home use and on the health and economic
determinants of nursing home entry. Persistent changes in
living arrangement patterns of elderly persons (Holden,
1988) and predicted changes in longevity and health (Crim-
mins, Hayward, and Saito, 1994; Crimmins and Ingegneri,
1992), suggest that the lifetime probabilities of nursing
home use will continue to rise for future cohorts of elderly
persons. Although it is important to understand the deter-
minants of nursing home entry among those currently at
risk of entering a nursing home, it is perhaps even more
important to understand whether individuals are able to ac-
curately assess the relative risks of their entering a nursing
home sometime in the future and incorporate this informa-
tion into their savings and insurance decisions. If individu-
als who are more likely to enter a nursing home in the
future can identify their own higher risk some years before
nursing home entry, financial incentives may encourage
those most at risk to purchase nursing home insurance or to
cover their higher risk through higher savings. On the other
hand, if expectations of nursing home use do not conform
to who is most likely to use nursing home care in the
future, market incentives may not be sufficient to enable in-
dividuals to insure against the costs of nursing home care.
Previous research on savings and insurance behavior has
not incorporated information on how expectations of nurs-
ing home care shaped behavior because information on
these expectations did not exist.
In this study we are interested in understanding the dis-
tribution of perceived risk and the information that individ-
uals consider when estimating their risk. To explore this,
data from the 1992 interview of the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS) are used to test the hypotheses that (a) the ex-
pectation of nursing home entry for respondents is consis-
tent with observed frequencies of lifetime use of nursing
homes, and (b) respondents form expectations about future
nursing home use in rational ways, that is, they use what is
known about observed risk factors to form expectations.
Because the primary respondents in the sample were only
51-61 years of age, we expect that most individuals will
have a high degree of uncertainty about future nursing
home use. Our approach is to take from the literature vari-
ables that are known to influence actual nursing home entry
and estimate their influence on the expectations for this co-
hort of nursing home entry. Of particular interest are the
variables that influence the expectations of women and
men, because historically there have been striking differ-
ences in nursing home risk between women and men. The
literature on lifetime nursing home use has shown that
women are much more likely to enter a nursing home than
men. This difference in nursing home use by gender is due
in part to the higher nursing home risk faced by unmarried
individuals, and women are more likely to outlive their
spouses. In constructing life cycle models, it is important to
understand whether women, both those now married and
those who are not, perceive their lifetime risk of nursing
home use as relatively high.
Over time it will be important to follow changes in
expectations as health and family characteristics change.
Additional waves of the HRS will enable us to examine
the relationship of early expectations of nursing home use
to other behavior including actual rates of nursing home
entry. However, only in the first HRS were questions asked
in a one-time module about nursing home expectations.
This analysis demonstrates the value of gathering data on
expectations and of examining the effect on behavior of
expectations in general and of nursing home expectations
in particular.

EXPECTATIONS OF NURSING HOME USE S241
Previous Literature
We use the literature on actual nursing home use as a
benchmark against which to judge the meaning of the ex-
pectations data and as a guide for variable selection. While
there is a large literature that investigates the factors that in-
fluence the risk of nursing home entry among elderly per-
sons currently at risk of nursing home care, only a few stud-
ies attempt to measure lifetime nursing home use. Because
individuals in our sample are asked about nursing home use
at some time in the future, lifetime risk measures are the
most appropriate comparison measure. Of the studies that
attempt to measure lifetime risk, only one study (Kemper
and Murtaugh, 1991) measures lifetime risk using a dataset
where lifetime risk is uncensored, i.e., where the respon-
dents had all died and lifetime nursing home use could be
observed. Using data from the National Mortality Follow-
back Survey (NMFS), a sample of next-of-kin of persons
who died in 1986, this study finds that the lifetime nursing
home use of persons who died after age 65 was 37 percent.
A consensus has emerged in the long-term care literature
about the most important characteristics that influence nurs-
ing home entry (see, for example, Coughlin, McBride, arid
Liu, 1990; Garber and MaCurdy, 1989; Greene and Ondrich,
1990; Headen, 1989, 1992, 1993; Kemper and Murtaugh,
1991; Liu, Coughlin, and McBride, 1991; Liu, McBride, and
Coughlin, 1994; McBride, Coughlin, and Liu, 1994), and,
therefore, may. be expected to shape expectations as well.
The conceptual model developed by Anderson and >New-
man (1973), which distinguishes factors that affect,Health
utilization as "need" factors, "enabling" factors, or "predis-
posing" factors, provides a useful organizing model for our
own variable selection.
Foremost on the list of risk factors for nursing home
entry are "need" factors or those characteristics that indi-
cate that a person is no longer able to live independently
because of declines in their health status. Typically, these
factors include measures of functional impairment -- e.g.,
activities of daily living (ADLs) or instrumental activities
of daily living (IADLs) -- since the presence of these limi-
tations likely suggests that a person cannot care for him-
or herself.
The long-term care literature has identified factors that
"enable" a person's nursing home decision (either enabling
them to stay out of a nursing home or enabling them to
enter a nursing home). Foremost among these is the avail-
ability and use of close substitutes to nursing home care:
forrnal and informal community-based services. Many
studies have identified the key role played by the availabil-
ity and use of informal caregivers, which will usually in-
clude the person's spouse if he or she is present in the
household, but could also include other family members
(primarily children but also siblings and grandchildren). Fi-
nancial resources are hypothesized .to be "enabling" vari-
ables as well and surely should be closely linked to the de-
velopment of expectations. However, it is not always clear
how resources affect the decision. In particular, higher lev-
els of income and assets improve the affordability of nurs-
ing homes, but also allow persons to afford formal commu-
nity-based care to stay out of a nursing home. On the other
hand, low levels of income and assets may show that a per-
son is eligible for Medicaid, the public insurance program
of last resort, improving the access of low-income persons
to nursing homes. Economists have concentrated on the
potential role of market conditions as an enabling factor in
the decision to enter nursing homes (Headen, 1992; Liu,
McBride, and Coughlin, 1994; Palmer and Vogel, 1983;
Scanlon, 1980). Key characteristics of markets that are im-
portant are the price and supply of nursing home beds and
the price and supply of home health care. In addition, pub-
lic policies that affect the conditions of the market, for
instance, controls on bed supply and Medicaid eligibility
rules and reimbursement rates, will also affect a person's
ability to enter a nursing home.
The third set of risk factors, those that are thought to
"predispose" a person toward nursing home care, include
increasing age but may also include education and race or
ethnicity. Increasing age may reduce the ability of individu-
als to cope with specific disability conditions. To the extent
that educational attainment increases a person's knowledge
of alternative long-term care options, this might also influ-
ence a person's choice of a nursing home as an option.
While some share of the lower rate of nursing home use
among Blacks may be explained by economic, health, and
disability differences, their nursing home use is consistently
lower even after controlling for these and other factors
(Headen, 1992). The nursing home utilization literature is
consistent in finding a higher risk of nursing home entry for
females than men, for Whites as compared to non-Whites,
and for never married as compared to married or previously
married persons.
In discussing marginal effects on the lifetime probability
of a nursing home entry, Liu, McBride, and Coughlin (1994)
point out that these probabilities are the net result of two im-
portant risks: the risk of mortality and the risk of nursing
home entry, conditional on survival. Thus, a characteristic
that increases (decreases) nursing home risk will be rein-
forced in its effect on the lifetime probability of nursing
home entry if it is also associated with a lower (greater)
mortality risk. For instance, that women have a far greater
chance of living to ages of highest nursing home entry risk
may explain an important part of the difference in lifetime
probabilities of nursing home entry between men and
women. However, even controlling for individual differ-
ences in mortality, men are more likely to be married, thus
ensuring the presence of a primary caregiver should they
need long-term care. Women at all ages are more likely to
be left without a caregiving spouse. In addition, even when
both members of a couple are alive, it has been found that
women are more likely to be the caregiver than are married
men. This could reflect differences in caregiving skills or
differences in social expectations about the responsibilities
of wives and husbands for care of a disabled spouse.
Hypotheses. -- The purpose of this study is to explore
the expectations of nursing home use among a cohort of re-
spondents to the Health and Retirement Study (HRS). Be-
cause the primary respondents in the sample were only
51-61 years of age, we expect that most individuals will
have a high degree of uncertainty about future nursing
home use. Nevertheless, we explore several hypotheses:
S242 HOLDENETAL.
(a) The expectation of nursing home entry for respon-
dents is consistent with observed frequency of life-
time use of nursing homes found in other studies;
(b) Respondents form expectations about nursing home
care in rational ways, that is, they use the informa-
tion available to them to form expectations, and this
information is used in ways that are consistent with
what has been found in the nursing home literature
about observed risk factors;
(c) The nursing home expectations for men and women
will differ and the factors that influence these ex-
pected risks will differ as well.
METHODS
Data from Wave 1 of the Health and Retirement Study
(HRS) are used to test the hypotheses explored here. The
HRS is a nationally representative sample of persons aged
51-61 first interviewed in 1992. If applicable, their spouse/
partner (who could be any age) was also interviewed. The
12',654 HRS respondents are distributed across 7,703
households. Current plans are for this cohort to be inter-
viewed every two years. Several methodological modules
in the first interview offered a set of experimental questions
to subsamples. A "Health Risk" module (Module J) in-
cludes the nursing home expectation question and was ad-
ministered in 754 different households.
The first question asked in Module J provides the focus
of this analysis:
"On a scale where 0 equals absolutely no chance and 10
equals absolutely certain, what do you think are the chances
that you will need long-term care in a nursing home at some
point during your lifetime?" [Question MJ1]
Module J was administered after the main questionnaire,
which included other expectation questions (Hurd and Mc-
Garry, 1995). Thus, when the module was administered, re-
spondents (who could be either the sampled member or, if
married, the spouse) had already been asked several expec-
tation questions using the same format and scale. Respon-
dents to the HRS were allowed to give responses ranging
from 0 to 10 to the expectation question. There were no ex-
plicit options for a "don't know" answer.
A response of 0 or 10 indicates absolute certainty that the
respondent will not (or will) enter a nursing home, and a
response of 5 suggests a high degree of uncertainty about
future nursing home use. Responses that range from 1 to 4
(6 to 9) suggest that while respondents recognize the uncer-
tainty of their nursing home entry, they have assessed this
probability as somewhat less (more) certain than is indi-
cated by a response of 5. To compare these responses with
actual probabilities, we report them as probabilities, divid-
ing each response by 10.
For the purposes of the multivariate analysis, we separate
these responses into five distinct groups based on the sub-
jective probability of nursing home use: 0, 1-4, 5, 6-9, and
10. We grouped the subjective probabilities in part to facili-
tate an analysis that distinguished among these distinct but
ordered values and in part because of the nonlinearity of the
responses (the relatively small number of individuals who
chose any of the single values 1-4 and 6-9 and the larger
numbers choosing 0, 5, or 10). Our ordered groupings re-
quire a method that accounts for the categorical and or-
dered dependent variable. An ordered logit model is
appropriate for estimating the relationship between the
probability group and individual characteristics, especially
given the bunching of respondents in certain categorical re-
sponses (Greene, 1993). We tested other model specifica-
tions, including a Tobit model, which treats the dependent
variable as a continuous but constrained variable. The un-
derlying relationships between the explanatory variables
and the categorical response were not sensitive to the
model specification.
Predictors of nursing home use. -- One purpose of our
study is to discover whether personal characteristics associ-
ated with nursing home entry at older ages may also be as-
sociated with expectations of nursing home use among the
younger cohort in the HRS. Thus, we select as predictors of
nursing home expectations those found in previous studies
of nursing home use. One problem with this reasoning is
that the formation of expectations by the HRS cohort must
be based on the information available to them at the time of
the interview. In providing a nursing home expectation,
HRS respondents must also be predicting risk factors that
may develop as they age. While predicting future health
conditions may be difficult for persons age 51-61, it may
be less difficult to predict caregiver availability and finan-
cial resources at the age they will be most at risk of nursing
home entry. In addition, already evident are some health
conditions that are predictive of future mortality or
long-term care needs. Without direct information on why
respondents assess their risk of nursing home entry as rela-
tively high or low, we start with the assumption that the
same sets of predictors that determine nursing home entry
are important in assessing future use. Taking account of the
fact that HRS respondents were using information available
to them in 1992 to assess probabilities, we supplement the
list of known risk factors with variables that we hypothe-
size reflect additional sources of information to respondents
about their likely risk of future nursing home entry. We
draw this list of risk factors from the literature on nursing
home utilization described above. Thus, we focus on need,
enabling, and predisposing risk factors, following the
model proposed by Anderson and Newman (1973). In addi-
tion, we keep in mind that the lifetime probability of nurs-
ing home use, and therefore its expectation, is the net result
of two important risks: the risk of mortality and the risk of
nursing home entry, conditional on survival.
As described above, "need" factors include those charac-
teristics that indicate a person is no longer able to live inde-
pendently because of declines in their health status. The ul-
timate effect on lifetime nursing home risk of the presence
at younger ages of these same health conditions is ambigu-
ous and depends on the magnitude of the likely impacts on
both the risk of mortality and the risk of nursing home
entry. This ambiguity is also present. To disentangle these
different health effects on expected probabilities of nursing
home use, we distinguish between "early mortality" and
"long-term disability" health conditions: "Early mortality"
health conditions lower the probability of future nursing
EXPECTATIONS OF NURSING HOME USE S243
home use by increasing the probability of early death,
whereas "long-term disability" conditions increase the
probability of future nursing home use by increasing the
likelihood of functional impairment while having little ef-
fect on mortality risk. Because not all health risks may be
observed in the HRS, we include an indicator of whether
the HRS respondent's parent ever used (including cur-
rently) a nursing home. While this may also measure infor-
mation and attitudinal effects, we hypothesize that it cap-
tures unmeasured genetic factors and health expectations
that the survey did not ask about.
Among the "enabling" factors that might influence ex-
pectations, we concentrate on the availability and use of
close substitutes to nursing home care: formal and informal
community-based services. It is important to keep in mind
that when establishing expectations, respondents must as-
sess not only the current availability of alternative sources
of care but also the likelihood that they will be able to ac-
cess that care in the future. Financial resources are also hy-
pothesized to be "enabling" variables and surely should be
closely linked to the development of expectations. How-
ever, it is not always clear how resources affect the deci-
sion: Medicaid coverage enables lower income persons to
gain access to nursing homes, whereas higher income re-
spondents use their own financial resources. The contrasts
between these effects led us to categorize respondents into
three distinct wealth groups: those with less than $4500 in
financial and property assets excluding the primary resi-
dence; those with greater than $90,000 in assets; and the
group between. The lower cut-off was selected to distin-
guish those for whom nursing home costs were not a finan-
cial constraint because they are probably now and are likely
to remain eligible for Medicaid. The higher cut-off was se-
lected to distinguish those whose assets were sufficient to
pay for the average stay for all but short-stay patients of
just over 2.0 years. Those with assets above this amount
have sufficient resources to enable a nursing home stay
(Holden and Smeeding, 1990; Moon and Smeeding, 1989).
Those who fall between these two asset thresholds are most
likely to have nursing home expectations shaped by their
expected financial constraints. Although we have insuffi-
cient geographic detail on respondents' residences to iden-
tify market conditions that might enable respondents to
enter nursing homes, we do identify residence in a standard
metropolitan statistical area (SMSA) or in the South as a
crude aggregate indicator of these geographic (and perhaps
discrimination) effects.
Among the risk factors thought to "predispose" a person
toward nursing home care, we include gender, age, educa-
tion, and race or ethnicity. One main goal of this study is to
compare the nursing home expectations of men to the ex-
pectations of women. We will explore whether these
expectations differ even after controlling for other factors.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides descriptive data on expectations of
nursing home use among the HRS respondents. The aver-
age expected risk of nursing home use is .402 with very
little difference in the expected rate between women and
men. Blacks report lower probabilities than Whites (com-
pare .357 to .413). In addition, married persons are less
likely than non-married persons to expect to enter nursing
homes (compare .389 to .438), although this difference is
much more dramatic for males (compare .386 to .529) than
it is for females (.393 compared to .403).
As noted above, we use the literature on actual nursing
home use as a benchmark against which to judge the mean-
ing of the expectations data and as a guide for variable se-
lection. The overall expected nursing home risk of 40 per-
cent is consistent with the 37 percent probability of any use
estimated by Kemper and Murtaugh (1991) in the one study
that measures lifetime risk using a dataset where lifetime
risk is uncensored, i.e., where the respondents had all died
and lifetime nursing home use could be observed (Table 2).

"National Mortality Followback Survey (NMFS) data cited from Kem-
per and Murtaugh (1991), Table 3. HRS data are weighted responses from
HRSWave 1.
The NMFS was drawn from a sample of deceased persons, so age of
death is available; the HRS sample is a sample of live respondents, so age
at death is not available.
cn.a. = not applicable.
There are some important conceptual differences be-
tween probabilities reported in Kemper and Murtaugh's
study on actual use and the HRS reported expectation data.
First, the HRS question does not specify the reason for
nursing home entry, an age of entry, nor a time period ex-
pected to remain there. Thus, it is not clear how the respon-
dent interpreted the meaning of the phrase, "long-term care
in a nursing home." Respondents may have focused on the
"nursing home" part of the question, perhaps classifying all
nursing home stays, including relatively short stays (e.g.,
less than 3 months) as "long-term care." Alternatively, re-
spondents may have focused on the "long-term care" part
of the question, perhaps reporting expectations only for rel-
atively long nursing home stays (e.g., more than 3 months).
As shown in Table 2, Kemper and Murtaugh report that
while 26 percent of elderly persons used nursing homes for
3 months or more, another 11 percent used nursing homes
for at least a day, but for less than 3 months.
Second, to interpret the HRS expectations variables, we
make the assumption that people understand how to trans-
late their expectations about the future into a 0-10 scale.
However, this assumption may not be valid for some re-
spondents. In particular, a response of "5" may indicate that
the respondent does not understand probabilities and has
chosen the midpoint of the scale as a focal response. If this
were true, one would expect these individuals to choose 5
in response to all other probability questions that preceded
the nursing home expectations question in the survey. To
test whether the 5s are informed responses, we examined
the answers to the identically phrased questions about the
chances of living to age 75 and 85. Among the 235 individ-
uals who responded 5 to the nursing home risk question,
only 24 of them answered 5 or did not answer both the
mortality expectations questions. Although this is only a
crude test, we conclude that the large number of 5s do not
reflect ignorance about probabilities. Using similar tech-
niques for assessing the validity of the responses, others
reach the same conclusions as we do here (Honig, 1996;
Hurd and McGarry, 1995). Rather, we argue that the 5s re-
flect real uncertainty about future nursing home use, and
that movements toward zero (or 10) reflect some informa-
tion about factors that would reduce (increase) the prob-
ability of entering a nursing home. Similarly, we were
concerned that responses of 0 and 1 were provided with ig-
norance of probability, rather than based on absolute cer-
tainty. Again, there was sufficient dispersion in answers to
other probability questions to suggest that certain persons
did understand the concept of probability. Interestingly, in-
dividuals who were certain that they would not enter a
nursing home were more likely to have responded that their
chance of living to 85 was zero.
The distribution of responses is consistent with the inter-
pretation that many persons are uncertain about their risks.
The modal response, given by about 35 percent of all re-
spondents, is 5. In contrast, about 23 percent were certain
about their use of nursing homes (19% certain they will not
use nursing homes, 4% certain they will). The remaining
third of the sample gave responses that lie between the ex-
tremes of complete certainty and complete uncertainty.
Predictors of nursing home use. -- Table 2 presents
some characteristics associated with lifetime nursing home
use and, therefore, that may be expected to shape expecta-
tions as well. The results suggest that while HRS respon-
dents' expectations do vary in ways that are comparable to
actual use rates, the variation is much smaller for expecta-
tions than actual use. For instance, HRS females estimate a
risk that lies between the short- and long-term nursing
home use (40% as compared to 30-42%) while males
clearly overestimate their risk (41% as compared to 21-
32%). Expected rates for Blacks and Whites are above
actual rates, particularly for Blacks, but Whites and Blacks
do perceive correctly that their use rates are different.
While married individuals overestimate their chances (most
likely a product of the overestimates by the mostly married
males), expectations of unmarried individuals almost ex-
actly mirror actual chances.
Table 3 presents, for women and men separately, the
means of characteristics that we hypothesize influence
nursing home expectations. Although the mean number of
children is about the same for women and men, women are
less likely to be living with a spouse or partner. Hence,
even at this relatively early age, women have fewer poten-

tial family caregivers than men. Women are somewhat
younger and report lower education levels and fewer assets
than males. However, assets are for the family so that this
difference is primarily because women are more likely to
be widowed than are males in the HRS sample.
Because health is a strong predictor of actual nursing
home use, we include both subjective and "objective" mea-
sures of health, although all health measures are self-
reported. About 18 percent of the full sample reported fair
or poor health status, with males somewhat more likely to
do so. There is no difference between women and men in
the percentage reporting that their health has become worse
over the past year.
While subjective measures of health may capture percep-
tions regarding general health status, previous research sug-
gests that specific health conditions affect nursing home
entry in different ways. As discussed above, we distinguish
between health conditions likely to predict death ("early
mortality" conditions), and health conditions that are likely
to predict long periods of functional limitation ("long-term
disability" conditions). In the list of early mortality condi-
tions we include histories of high blood pressure, heart at-
tack, and cancer. High blood pressure is predictive of future
heart disease that is associated with high mortality and a
limited period of disability. In the list of long-term disabil-
ity conditions we include histories of arthritis, diabetes,
asthma, persistent pain, stroke, kidney or stomach prob-
lems, difficulties with activities of daily living (ADLs), and
mental illness. We include three "life style" characteristics
that threaten health problems but currently may not be
linked with a health condition. These are whether the per-
son is a current smoker, drinks more than three drinks per
day on average, or is obese (the person is categorized as
obese if the ratio of body weight in kilograms to height in
meters squared is greater than 33).
The results presented in Table 3 indicate that while an
early mortality condition is more often reported by men
(.478 as compared to .439), men are less likely to have a
long-term disability condition (.552 as compared to .645, a
difference that is statistically significant). Although not
shown here, the higher incidence of long-term disability
conditions among women arises from a higher incidence of
arthritis and psychiatric disorders. The greater prevalence
of early mortality health conditions among men than
women may contribute to the higher mortality rates of men
and the consequent disparity in the actual lifetime risk of
nursing home use between men and women. In contrast, the
presence of more long-term disability conditions may oper-
ate in the opposite direction. A question is whether men and
women recognize these future disparities much earlier in
life and, consequently, whether men have lower nursing
home use expectations.
Multivariate Analysis
In this section we seek to identify how personal charac-
teristics are related to variations in the expectations of nurs-
ing home use. As described above, we group responses for
the multivariate analysis. Table 4 presents variable means
for each of the five probability groups. In some cases, this
table suggests a strong relationship between a variable and
nursing home expectations. For instance, the average num-
ber of children falls as reported chances of nursing home
use rise. Urban location and residence in the South appear
to be associated with lower expectations of nursing home
entry -- of those reporting a 0 probability, 70 percent re-
side in an urban community, whereas of those reporting
certain entry, only 58 percent are urban residents. Table 4
also suggests that respondents' estimates of probabilities
also reflect greater or lesser "certainty" on the part of re-
spondents about their chances of nursing home entry, given
their current characteristics. This does not contradict the
underlying assumption of a monotonic ordering of proba-
bilities; higher stated probabilities still reflect higher chances
of entry which are themselves expressions of uncertainty.
What Table 4 suggests is that as individuals move away
from "uncertainty" defined in the probabilistic sense as an
even chance of using a nursing home, their estimates reflect
underlying processes that are consistent with known entry
behavior. For example, worse and worsening health reduces
uncertainty about future nursing home entry, increasing
those chances. While those who are absolutely certain to
use a nursing home on average have 2.3 long-term disabil-
ity conditions and .8 early mortality conditions, those who
estimate an even chance of future nursing home use have
only 0.97 and 0.5 conditions, respectively. On the other
hand, those who indicate there is no chance they will enter

a nursing home also have more early mortality and long-
term disability conditions. Health deterioration clearly pre-
disposes individuals toward greater certainty of nursing
home entry: Forty-one percent of those who are absolutely
certain to use a nursing home reported worsening health
compared to only 10 percent of those who are the most un-
certain about future nursing home use.
Multivariate regression model. -- While Table 4 sug-
gests interesting relationships, it is only through a multi-
variate analysis that the marginal effects of each variable
can be determined. To test the hypotheses outlined here, we
include measures of health status, marital status, family
structure, economic status, and family history of nursing
home use as explanatory variables.
Table 5 presents results from the estimation. The factors
affecting nursing home expectations for men are very dif-
ferent from the factors affecting expectations for women.
While the coefficient on the Male variable in the estimates
using the full sample is insignificant, a result which reflects
the almost identical mean expectations shown in Table 1 for
male and female, the separate estimates for males and fe-
males suggest that different processes underlie the forma-
tion of nursing home expectations for women and men. The
effects of other variables suggest that HRS respondents are
basing expectations primarily on "need" factors and ex-

pected available caregivers, but that men and women at this
early stage in life recognize likely differences that will exist
between them when they are at risk of needing long-term
care. The expectations of males are shaped by current mari-
tal status -- if married, their expectations of nursing home
use are lower. This is not the case for women who, we con-
clude, realistically assess their chances as very small of still
being married when the nursing home decision will be
made and are more influenced in forming their expectations
by the availability of children rather than by the current
presence of a spouse. Interestingly, women are also influ-
enced by their parents' nursing home entry with more likely
entry anticipated when a parent has been in a nursing home.
This positive effect may arise from (a) the information
S248 HOLDENETAL.
gleaned from their parents' experience about the conditions
that lead to nursing home care, even when children are pre-
sent; (b) family expectations about the obligations of chil-
dren to care for parents; (c) acquaintance with the quality of
nursing home care, thereby eschewing the common percep-
tion of substandard care; or (d) unmeasured genetic health
conditions that individuals expect to develop in the future.
The last is a real possibility, as health conditions appear to
influence women's nursing home expectations.
To try to better understand the effect of health status on
nursing home expectations, a set of alternative regression
models were run. Table 5 reports the results of our pre-
ferred model using early mortality, long-term disability, and
"life style" health variables as subjective measures of
health status. Alternatively, it might be assumed that re-
spondents would use "subjective" health status measures
(health status excellent, fair, or poor) to assess their risk of
entering a nursing home, since these are likely to directly
impact subjective expectations. Table 6 reports the results
from a test of this hypothesis, reporting the coefficients on
the subjective health measures; other coefficients were not
sensitive to the health measure chosen. Including specific
health conditions (results not shown) did not add insight
into health effects beyond that from the Table 5 specifica-
tion. The results of the alternative specification in Table 6
indicate that self-reported health measures do not con-
tribute to explaining nursing home use expectations, al-
though worsening health, included in our preferred model
as well, does have a strong positive influence for both
women and men. This is not to say that expectations are not
influenced by individuals' own global assessment of their
health status. It is more likely that the HRS subjective
health indicator combines medical conditions that increase
the chances of early mortality as well as those that increase
the risk of nursing home entry, conditional on survival,
leading to an indeterminate sign on the subjective health
coefficient. The model estimated in Table 5 attempts to sep-
arate these two types of health conditions.
The results of our preferred model (Table 5) suggest that
males consider the type of health condition, with "early
mortality" conditions diminishing expectations of nursing
home use and "long-term disability" conditions increasing
expectations. Men with more early mortality conditions
may predict early death and therefore discount the probabil-
ity of nursing home use, while men with greater numbers of
long-term disability conditions may predict future disability
and therefore increase their probability of nursing home
use. This contrast is not apparent among women, although
the opposite and significant effects of being overweight and
a smoker may indicate similar processes. The positive in-
fluence of deteriorating health on the expectations of both
women and men is maintained. Their own worsening health
and parents' nursing home use appear to signal their chances
of future health deterioration.
The coefficient on the variable Black, which measures
differences in the intercept, is large and statistically signifi-
cant only at the 10 percent level for males but is smaller
and insignificant among females. The influence of urban
and southern residence may be picking up the effect of
either quality of institutions, access, or alternative long-
term care options. We included wealth and home ownership
as measures of expected long-term economic well-being.
Neither wealth nor home ownership seem to influence nurs-
ing home expectations, which may indicate that these
wealth measures are poor predictors of the effect of wealth
on long-term care choices at probable ages of nursing home
entry. Including continuous wealth measures did not alter
this result. The education variables, which are significant
only for women, may be picking up a couple of different
effects. On the one hand, they may be measuring long-term
expectations about the ability to pay for future nursing
home care among the more highly educated (not captured
by the wealth variable) and, therefore, their access to higher
quality nursing homes. On the other hand, this coefficient
may be capturing the better acquisition of information
about nursing home risks by more highly educated persons,
including their children's willingness to provide care.
Age is not a significant predictor of nursing home expec-
tations. While this may seem counterintuitive, this finding
likely reflects the lack of variation in age in the HRS sam-
ple. In other words, since the age of most respondents falls
within a 10-year age range, with older and younger respon-
dents all married to persons within that range, expectations
would not be expected to vary by age. Moreover, the
well-known relationship between age of death and use of
nursing homes (reflected in the findings cited in Table 2)
most likely captures persons who survive acute episodes,
but become more susceptible to chronic illnesses over time.
Since health conditions are controlled for in the models
presented here, it is likely that respondents are forming ex-
pectations of their mortality and internalizing that in their
nursing home expectations. Thus, the relationship between

age and nursing home expectations is most likely reflected
here through other explanatory variables.
While it is tempting to draw conclusions directly from the
signs and magnitudes of the coefficients in the ordered logit
model, their effects on probabilities cannot be easily inter-
preted (Greene, 1993). While a positive (negative) sign indi-
cates that a person is more likely to be in the highest (lowest)
ordered group, it does not necessarily increase the likelihood
of being in all of the higher groups. For example, a positive
sign increases the probability of observing a non-zero re-
sponse to the expectations question, but does not necessarily
increase the probability of giving any non-zero response ex-
cept for 10. To facilitate interpretation of these results, we
use the ordered logit to derive predicted probabilities of fall-
ing into each of the ordered categories, estimated separately
for women and men. The predicted probabilities presented in
Tables 7 and 8 were calculated by setting all of the explana-
tory variables at their means and then calculating the proba-
bility of falling into each of the ordered categories, using the
relative odds formula from the ordered logit model (Greene,
1993). This allows us to isolate the effect of one variable at a
time, by changing its value and then recalculating the proba-
bilities while holding all other variables at their mean values.
The first row of Tables 7 and 8 shows the predicted distri-
bution of women and men, respectively, across the probabil-
ity groups. The other rows show how the probability distri-
bution changes as the value of some specific variable
changes. For example, the results indicate mat the predicted
distribution of nursing home use among women shifts to-
ward lower expectations as the number of children increases,
perhaps reflecting their expectations that children will pro-
vide care if needed. Alternatively, when a respondent sees
that their parents have used a nursing home, the distribution
of perceived nursing home risks shifts to the right. Persons
living in an urban area or outside the South perceive a higher
nursing home risk, perhaps reflecting greater access to nurs-
ing homes or unmeasured health differences in these areas.
Black men and married men perceive that they face lower
nursing home risks. More education, which was significant
for women but not men, increases uncertainty about nursing
home care; that is, more educated persons are more uncertain
about future nursing home use.

The role of health factors is also reflected in Tables 1 and
8. Women perceive that they are at greater risk for nursing
home entry if they are overweight, are not a current
smoker, or if their health has recently worsened. The pre-
dicted probabilities for men illustrate the differential effects
of "early mortality" and "long-term disability" conditions:
A greater number of early mortality conditions moves the
distribution away from uncertainty toward certain nonuse,
while a greater number of long-term disability conditions
and worsening health increases perceived risk for men.
While the results described above are informative, they
do not show how nursing home expectations are influenced
by the presence of multiple risk factors. To illustrate the im-
portance of combined risk factors, we construct two hypo-
thetical individuals -- one with characteristics that are
likely to make them a "high risk" individual and the other
with characteristics that are likely to make them a "low risk"
individual -- and compare their predicted nursing home ex-
pectations. Low- and high-risk cases have variables set at
mean, except for the following. A low-risk case is described
as a person who has five children, has less than a high
school education, lives in the South, has parents who did not
use nursing homes, whose health is not getting worse, and
who is not obese. A high-risk case is a person who has no
children, has some college education, does not live in the
South, has parents who used a nursing home, whose health
is getting worse, and is obese. The results of this exercise
are reported in the last rows of Tables 7 and 8. The results
show dramatically that an individual with fewer risk factors
is likely to have lower expectations of nursing home use.
While only illustrative, this exercise indicates that nursing
home expectations may vary across individuals as the num-
ber of risk factors varies, and in ways that we would expect.
DISCUSSION
This study finds support for all three hypotheses posited
here. It is found that respondents to the Health and Retire-
ment Study (HRS) form expectations that are roughly consis-
tent with observed frequency of lifetime use of nursing
homes found in other studies, although respondents also indi-
cate considerable uncertainty about these expectations. In ad-
dition, respondents form expectations about nursing home
use in rational ways, using information available to them to
form expectations that are consistent with their characteristics
and especially with characteristics found in the nursing home
literature to be important risk factors for nursing home entry.
Finally, the nursing home expectations for men and
women differ in ways that are consistent with their proba-
ble determinants of actual future use. In particular, while
expectations on nursing home use are on average the same
for women and men, the underlying process that shapes
those expectations takes account of different factors. Both
EXPECTATIONS OF NURSING HOME USE S251
men and women appear to incorporate differential mortality
risk into their nursing home expectations. Married men, who
are likely to die before their spouses, have relatively low ex-
pected probabilities of nursing home use. In contrast, the
current availability of a spouse does not appear to influence
the nursing home expectations of women. Instead, women
take into account the number of children when forming ex-
pectations. While health conditions influence expectations
for men, health conditions have a smaller effect on the nurs-
ing home expectations for women. Instead, other factors,
such as family history of nursing home use, family structure,
and education, appear to be the strongest predictors of nurs-
ing home expectations for women. This probably reflects the
unpredictability at this early stage of life of the onset of
chronic, age-related conditions (e.g., Alzheimer's disease,
incontinence) that lead to nursing home entry late in life.
These results are important for several reasons. First, ex-
pectations of nursing home use are likely to influence sav-
ings for retirement, insurance purchase, and the allocation of
assets (Hubbard, Skinner, and Zeldes, 1995). If nursing
home use is widely anticipated, individuals may attempt to
save during their working years in order to ensure the ability
to pay for quality care. Anticipating the need for long-term
care, individuals may respond to the availability of long-
term care insurance, purchase Medicaid-exempt assets (e.g.,
buying and retaining more expensive housing), or give inter
vivos transfers to children as part of an intrafamily care con-
tract. Understanding expectations of nursing home use is re-
quired in order to predict both the demand for formal
long-term care services and the effect of public policy aimed
at ensuring adequate provision of alternative forms of care.
This study's analysis is exploratory and there are some
limitations of these findings. The data have been available
only recently, and further investigation is expected. Since it
appears that respondents are reflecting considerable uncer-
tainty in their responses to the expectations questions, ex-
ploring the origins of this uncertainty with further detailed
questions seeking further elaboration would be very useful.
The responses to the question on expected long-term care
use appear reasonable and reflect factors that are known
from the literature to affect actual use. Thus, we also con-
clude that these expectation questions -- even about an
event far into the future -- may provide potentially useful
information about how expectations about nursing home
use and costs may be linked to savings and retirement
preparation. We propose that the HRS ask this question of
the full sample in a future wave. Insight into the influence
of these expectations on savings, insurance purchase, and
living arrangements requires a far larger sample than is
available from an experimental module. If these questions
are asked several times over the HRS period (though not
necessarily in each interview), investigators will be able to
track how these expectations change as the sample ages,
how changes in expectations influence retirement planning,
and the predictive accuracy of these questions over time as
we observe individuals entering long-term care facilities.
