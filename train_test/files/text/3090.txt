WHEN PEOPLE SURVIVE TO
old age, fear of death is
often joined by fears of
disability or institution-
alization. Morbidity and disability be-
fore death have a tremendous impact
on such persons, their families, and the
health care delivery system. Health care
use increases substantially as people
draw closer to death.1 In 1993, 73% of
all deaths in the United States oc-
curred among persons 65 years and
older and 23% among those 85 years
and older.2 It is therefore important to
have a clear description of the health
status and quality of life before death
for this population. The theory of com-
pression of morbidity3 posits that most
persons would survive to the end of
their biologically endowed life span and
die of natural causes. The prevalence
of disability and the proportion of life
lived with disability would therefore de-
crease. Although this may be an ideal
personal goal that could also reduce the
burden on the health care system, other
commentators predict that in the face
of continued increases in total life ex-
pectancy, an extension of the period of
disability prior to death may be an in-
evitable consequence of living to an ad-
vanced age.4-5 United States residents
may instead be living a longer life with
worsening health.6
Although no consensus exists,
many studies have described the pat-
tern of change in morbidity and dis-
ability among the general US popula-
tion of older adults.6-11 Quality of life
prior to death has been studied less
thoroughly.12 This study used data
from the 1986 and 1993 National
Mortality Followback Surveys to
examine the changes in the use of
formal medical care, disability, and
overall quality of life in the year
before death among older persons
living in the United States and to
examine how this change varied by
sex and age at death.

Context The population is aging and life expectancy is increasing, but whether mor-
bidity and disability late in life also increase is unknown.
Objective To examine whether the use of health care services, disability and cog-
nitive function, and overall quality of life in the year before death among older adults
has changed over time.
Design and Setting The 1986 and 1993 National Mortality Followback Surveys,
which were probability samples of all deaths in the United States with response rates
of next of kin of 90% and 88% for those aged 65 years and older.
Participants Next of kin were asked to report the health status of a total of 9179
decedents who were 65 years and older in 1986 and 6735 in 1993, representing 1.5
and 1.6 million decedents aged 65 years and older.
Main Outcome Measures Days of hospital or nursing home stays, number and
length of disability in 5 activities of daily living, duration of impairment in 3 measures
of cognitive function, and an overall sickness score among individuals aged 65 through
84 years and those aged 85 years and older.
Results Women used significantly fewer hospital and nursing home services in the last
year of life in 1993 vs 1986 (mean reduction, 3.3 nights for both age groups for hospital
services; mean reduction 18.4 nights for nursing home for women aged 65-84 years and
42.3 nights for women 85 years). Men had no changes except those aged 85 years and
olderhadadeclineinnursinghomenightsof32.6.Theproportionofwomenaged85years

creased and the mean sickness score decreased, but those with at least 2 activities of daily
livingimpairmentsincreasedandtheoverallqualityoflifedeclined.Asimilarpatternofchange
was found in the oldest-old men except that cognitive function worsened. Most param-
eters for men aged 65 through 84 years did not change significantly.
Conclusions Men and women at least 85 years old in the US experienced a better
overall quality of life in the last year of life in 1993 than those in 1986. Most measures
for men and women aged 65 through 84 years improved or did not change.

Deathcertificatesweredrawnfromthe

atic sample of the death certificates of
the 50 states, the District of Columbia,
andtheindependentregistrationareaof
New York City. Because of respondent
consentrequirements,OregonandSouth
Dakota were not included in the 1986
and 1993 survey, respectively. From
these certificates, a complex sampling
design was used to ensure that enough
decedents from certain strata would be
selected.Somepopulations(eg,blacks)
and some diseases (eg, cardiovascular
diseaseandexternalcauses)wereover-
sampled. The final sample represents a
national 1% probability sample of all
deathsinthesurvey-specifiedageranges,
ie, 25 years and older in 1986 and 15
years and older in 1993.
The next of kin, identified on the de-
cedent'sdeathcertificate,wascontacted
by personalized letter and asked to par-
ticipate in the survey. For cases with no

tively, for decedents 65 years and older.
Proxy respondents were asked to re-
port the decedents' total lengths of over-
night stay in each hospital or nursing
home during the last year of life. Infor-
mation was obtained on the dece-
dent's ability to perform 5 self-care ac-
tivities: walking, bathing or showering,
using the toilet (including getting to and
from the toilet), dressing, and eating.
If the decedent had difficulty in doing
any of the activities, respondents were
asked to indicate the length of time the
decedent experienced difficulty for each
activity. Cognitive function in the last
year of life was evaluated by asking
whether the decedent had trouble un-
derstanding where he/she was, remem-
bering what year it was, and recogniz-
ing family members or good friends.
The impairment of each function was
classified by 4 categories: never or
hardly ever, only in last few hours or
days before death, some of the time, and
all or most of the time.
Data Analysis
Decedentsincludedinthisanalysiswere
those 65 years and older at death.
Analyses were performed by sex and by
2 age groups, those aged 65 through 84
years, and those 85 years and older. Use
of health care services and numbers of
disabilities in the last year of life of de-
cedents were compared between the 2
survey years with several approaches.
First, we compared the length of hos-
pital or nursing home stay and the pro-
portion of decedents with limitation in
each of the 5 ADLs and in each of the
3 cognitive measures. Then we con-
structed 2 opposite-extreme catego-
ries for each of the following indica-
tors: use of service, less than 1 week of
total hospital and nursing home stay
(minimum use) vs 6 months or longer
combined hospital and nursing home
stays (extensive use); ADL, no diffi-
culty in all 5 ADLs or limited for less
than 30 days if any (minimally re-
stricted) vs difficulty in at least 2 ADLs
for 6 months or longer (severely re-
stricted); cognitive function, no im-
pairment in all 3 domains of function
or in only the last few hours or days be-
fore death if any (normal) vs having im-
pairment in at least 2 functions all or
most of the time (severely impaired);
and overall quality of life in the last year,
minimal use of service and minimal re-
striction in ADL and normal cognitive
function (good quality) vs at least 1
indicator described above that was in
the unfavorable extreme (severely
impaired).
Finally, we created a summary sick-
ness score for each decedent jointly con-
sidering the severity and length of each
service used, disability, and impair-
ment. We began by assigning scores for
each group of indicators: service use,
ADL, and cognitive function. Each in-
dicator consisted of a various number
of disability items, and different dis-
abilities may not represent the same ex-
tent of sickness (eg, difficulty in eat-
ing vs walking). It was therefore
necessary to weight different items and
to standardize the scores of the 3 indi-
cators. For service use, the score is the
total days of all hospital and nursing
home stays. For ADL and cognitive
function, assuming severity of a dys-
function and its prevalence are nega-
tively related, the score was calculated
as Wi
Ti
/Wi
, where Wi
is the inverse
of the prevalence rate of disability i
in
the combined data, Ti
is the duration
(days) of disability. We assigned 0, 5,
30, and 270 days for the 4 categories
of impairment in cognitive function, re-
spectively. The scores for service use,
ADL, and cognitive function were then
summed up to derive a single measure
of overall sickness. This score ignores
the interrelationships among 3 indica-
tors but should correctly order dece-
dents according to severity of disabili-
ties. A higher score (with day as the
unit) represents a worse quality of life
compared with a lower score.
The National Mortality Followback
Survey is a stratified random sample
that allows for projections of national
estimates from the sample. Data were
weighted by SUDAAN software16 to be
representative of the age, sex, and ra-
cial composition noted on all death cer-
tificates and for factors determining the
probability of selection. The response
rate of informants was also adjusted in
the weighting process. The t test was
used to compare the age-specific dif-
ference between the 2 survey years and
the difference in change from 1986 to
1993 between the 2 age groups. Nights
of hospital or nursing home stay were
log-transformed in the statistical tests.
Multivariate regression analysis was
performed to adjust for changes be-

tween the 2 survey years in the distri-
bution of the relationship between
proxy respondents and decedent
(spouse, child/parent, sibling/other rela-
tive, or other) and the living arrange-
ment of the decedents before death
(lived alone or lived with spouse, or
nonspouse). To examine whether the
changes in sickness score were signifi-
cantly different by age, the interaction
term year Ã age was tested in the re-
gression model.
RESULTS
Basic demographic data for the US de-
cedents in 1986 and 1993 are shown in
TABLE 1. The available survey sample
sizes were 9179 in 1986 and 6735 in
1993,representingabout1.5and1.6mil-
lion decedents 65 years and older who
diedduringthe2surveyyears,1986and
1993. Age and race distributions were
comparable betweenthe 2years within
the same age groups (65-84 years;85
years).Amongyoungerwomen(aged65-
84 years) the percentage of widows de-
creasedfrom55.3%in1986to50.4%in
1993 (P.05). No significant distribu-
tionchangeinmaritalstatuswasfound
in other groups. The proportion of de-
cedents who lived alone in the last year
of life decreased from 1986 to 1993
among women in both age groups
(P.05). The proportion of spouses
completingthesurveydecreasedin1993,
whichwasstatisticallysignificantformen
aged65through84years.Agreaterpro-
portionoftherespondentswerethede-
cedents' children among men aged 65
through 84 years (P.05).
The year before death, hospital stays
for men did not change from 1986 to
1993, but significantly more women in
both age groups had no hospital stays
in the year before death in 1993 than in
1986. More men and women aged 65
through84yearswerehospitalizedthan
those85yearsandolder(TABLE2).Nurs-
ing home stays decreased significantly
in older men and in both age groups of
women.Oldermenandwomenhadlarge
increases in never staying in a nursing
home and declined in the number of
nursing home stays than the younger
group (P.05).
TABLE 3 presents percentages of de-
cedents with difficulty carrying out the
5 ADLs regardless of the length of dis-
ability. Walking and bathing were the
most common disabilities. For the same
age group women had a greater pro-
portion with disability than did men.
Older men and women experienced
fewer disabilities in 1993 than in 1986,
although most differences were signifi-
cant only for women.

Percentages of subjects with im-
paired cognitive function in at least
some portion of the last year of life
are shown in TABLE 4. The rates of
cognitive impairments reported in
both sexes declined from 1986 to
1993 but were not statistically signifi-

Individuals at the extremes of health
measures are compared in TABLE 5.
Among the oldest men and both age
groups of women, percentages requir-

users decreased significantly from 1986
to 1993. Among the parameters that

all trends were in the direction of im-

COMMENT
Data from this large national represen-
tative sample demonstrate that women
in their last year of life in 1993 used less
in-patient medical care (hospital and
nursing home stay) than those in 1986.
The oldest women also experienced less
disability in ADL and decline in cog-
nitive function. The overall quality of
life in their last year of life improved
among all women but was most promi-
nent in those 85 years and older. Simi-
lar patterns of changes were also ob-
served in the oldest men but not in men
aged 65 through 84 years.
InthegeneralUSpopulation,between
1986and1993,thedischargerateinnon-
federal short-stay hospitals decreased
from 367 to 342 per 1000 persons 65
years and older.17 The average length of
staydecreasedfrom8.5to7.8days.Older
patients are also not entering nursing

cantly to diverting older persons from
nursing home care, which can and may
be because they prefer to receive care at
home.18 Medical technology developed
foruseinthehomewiththeuseofassis-
tive devices and housing modifications
has sharply increased. Both the levels of
care and the mix of long-term care ser-
vices available concomitant with the
improving health and increased use of
assistive devices, social conditions, and
desire for independence among older
adults may shift care for older patients
to a community-based approach.19

to better health.

The information provided in these 2
surveys was obtained from proxies,
which is a potential limitation; how-
ever, some carefully designed studies
have found no evidence of a difference
between reports by proxies and those by
patients themselves.29-31 A major objec-
tive of the 1993 National Mortality Fol-
lowback Survey was to replicate critical
components of the 1986 survey to ex-
aminethesecularchangesamongtheUS
decedents. To this end, considerable ef-
fort was made to maintain comparabil-
ityofthe2surveys,includingdesignand
data collection. Imprecision as a result
of proxy report is subject to large uncer-
tainty for a given year but less variabil-
ity in measuring changes over time. This
is because many errors in the estimates
are likely consistent across respondents
and hence tend to "cancel" in compari-
sons. We have used multivariate analy-
sis techniques and subgroup analysis to
accountfortheshiftsinrespondentcom-
positions and living arrangements in the
2 survey years. A minor (2%) change in
age-specific response rate between the
2 surveys was adjusted in the analyses
as well.
