Abstract
Objective: To understand methodological concerns related to dietary intake collection
in transitional societies.
Design: Three days of household weighing and measurement of all food used and
repeated 24-hour recalls.
Setting: Eight Chinese provinces.
Subjects: Five thousand nine hundred and fifty-two and 5152 adults aged 20­45 years
in 1989 and 1997, respectively.
Results: Great variance exists in the types and quantity of animal products used in
common recipes. For example, the proportion of pork from lean cuts in `stir-fried
fresh pepper and pork' varies between 14 and 24% in urban and rural areas and the
total pork content for 100 g (dish) varies by 15 to 19 g between rural and urban areas
in each of eight provinces. Another challenge relates to the variation in the edible
vegetable oil content added during food preparation. Reliance on standard
recipes for each fried dish would miss the variations in oil use over time, space
and socio-economic status.
Conclusions: Dietary change is rapid in transitional countries. Reliance on recipes
standardised for animal food and edible oil contents will lead to very large
systematic errors in the measurement of energy, fat and protein intakes.

Diet assessment
Research on dietary behaviour and trends in rapidly
changing transitional economies must be able to
measure increased dietary diversity, large variance in
the composition of common dishes, increased use of
edible oil, shifts in the structure of consumption within
and between food groups, and increased consumption
of processed foods1,2. Also, as the epidemiological and
nutrition transition progresses, concern for malnutrition
and the classic maternal and child health focus has to
shift towards a broader-based focus of diets appropriate
for both undernutrition and overnutrition and their
relation to non-communicable diseases. Our research in
China illustrates the challenges and the methods used to
address them.
The challenges in studying nutrition in a developing
country are understood. They include incomplete food
composition tables and lack of extensive research and
experience with individual measurement of dietary intake
for children and adults. For instance, the Institute of
Nutrition and Food Safety in China had never collected
individual food intake in a large-scale study prior to our
1989 survey. Also, research experience in cultures where
consumption is directly from common dishes was
minimal. In addition, with few processed and packaged
foods, individual consumption patterns might be expected
to be more heterogeneous.
There are, of course, important ways that dietary
research is facilitated in transitional economies such as
China. There is no sophisticated understanding of good
and bad dietary patterns as they relate to disease, and so
there is little sense of `good' and `bad' foods. Thus there
are fewer problems related to systematic recall biases that
affect diet research. However, we are seeing the
emergence of `Western ideals' for body image that might
lead to biased responses to questions about diet in the
future (Bentley, personal communication).
The first part of the paper presents some of the ways we
addressed the measurement of dietary change in China.
Included is an evaluation of the decision to obtain
ingredients for each composite dish from our respondents
and not to use recipe files. Another was our measurement
of fats and condiments used in household food
processing.
The second part presents some of the dietary shifts

coupled with related cross-national studies that provide a
sense of selected key dimensions of dietary change in the
developing world.
The China Health and Nutrition Survey
The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) follows
the human subjects approval procedures of both the
University of North Carolina School of Public Health and
the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine.
The sample comprises the 1989, 1991, 1993 and 1997
panels of the CHNS. The CHNS covered eight provinces
that vary substantially in geography, economic develop-
ment, public resources and health indicators (Guanqxi,
Guizhou, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangsu, Liaoning and
Shandong) for the first three panels, replacing Liaoning
with Heilongjiang in 1997. A multi-stage, random cluster
process was used to draw the sample surveyed in each of
the provinces. Counties in the eight provinces were
stratified by income (low, middle and high) and a
weighted sampling scheme was used to randomly select
four counties in each province (one low-income, two
middle-income, one high-income). Within each county,
the town where the county government is located was
selected, and three villages were chosen randomly. In
addition, each provincial capital and a lower-income city
from each province were selected. Within each city, urban
and suburban neighbourhoods were selected randomly.
The sample design consisted of 188 primary sampling
units, including 3870 households and covering about
16 000 individuals. Except for part of the samples from
Guangxi and Guizhou provinces, most persons studied
had a Han background (85%).
Methods of dietary assessment
Measurement of household food inventory
Household food consumption was determined on a daily
basis by calculating changes in food inventory. Chinese
scales with a minimum and maximum limit of 20 g and
15 kg, respectively, were used. All foods in stock at the
initiation of the survey (including edible oils, sugar and
salt), foods purchased and/or produced at home during
the survey period, and food preparation waste (including
spoiled rice and food fed to animals) were weighed and
considered in the calculation of household food con-
sumption. This was the only method that was used by the
Institute for national and large-scale surveys prior to the
CHNS.
Measurement of individual intake
Individual dietary data for the same three consecutive days
were recorded for all household members, regardless of
age or relationship to the household head. This was
achieved by asking each individual, except children aged
below 12 years, each day, to report all food consumed
away from home on a 24-hour recall basis. For the
younger children, the mother or a mother substitute who
handled food preparation and feeding in the household
was asked to recall the child's food consumption. The
same daily interview was used to collect at-home
individual consumption. Using food models and picture
aids, trained field interviewers recorded the types,
amounts, type of meal and place of consumption of all
food items during 24 hours of the previous day.
Respondents were prompted about snacks and shared
dishes. Food items consumed at restaurants, canteens and
other locations away from home were systematically
recorded. Housewives and other household members
were encouraged to provide additional information to use
in determining the amounts of particular food items in
dishes consumed in the household. The amount of each
dish was estimated from the household inventory, and the
proportion of each dish consumed was reported by each
person interviewed. Thus, the amount of individual
consumption was determined by the total amount in the
dish and the proportion of the dish that each person
consumed.
There are clear reasons for collecting 24-hour dietary
intake data. China has conquered the problems of food
scarcity at the national level and has undergone a
remarkable transition in the structure of food consump-
tion. This has gone hand in hand with marked changes in
eating behaviour. For instance, away-from-home (AFH)
food consumption has increased in response to the
dynamic changes in real disposable income and market
labour force patterns. Within-household variations in food
intake and eating patterns appear to be expanding3. Food
and nutrition policy is focusing less on food security
needs and more on the health-related needs of selected
age­gender groups. As this occurs, individual dietary
intake becomes more important.
The major concern is that the traditional eating pattern
in China involves the preparation and serving of a limited
number of complex dishes. These dishes consist of staple
and side foods. The former includes all food made of
grains and served in a separate bowl to each person, and
the latter consists of all meat and vegetable dishes cooked
and placed in the centre of the table in big bowls or
plates for all people to share. This pattern of household
consumption from common plates increases the difficulty
of obtaining accurate measurement of individual food
consumption. In addition, snacks and food eaten away
from home are dependent on respondent's memory.
These limitations have hindered the development of
collection of individual dietary intake data in China, as
they were felt to reduce the validity and precision of the
individual 24-hour recall method. The combination of the
two methods developed for the CHNS allowed us to lessen
the errors associated with this eating method. Both total

quantities available for consumption as well as ingredients
are understood prior to editing the 24-hour recall for each
family member.
Recipe names and contents were measured by asking
the name of the recipe consumed and recording for each
individual the quantities of separate foods found in the
recipe.
Conversion to nutrients: the Chinese food
composition table
When the 1989 CHNS began, the food composition table
(FCT) for China was limited to 660 foods and was not
poised for the rapid shift in Chinese food supply that
occurred with the introduction of multinational food
companies and modern processed foods. Also, the
available FCT of China was based on food as purchased
and grown and consisted of raw food items. It did not
measure processing and preparation wastage4. This FCT
has been expanded to encompass closer to 2000 foods and
now includes adequate representation of processed foods.
However, there is one gap. The Chinese FCT does not
include any recipes, so measurement of AFH food intake
must rely on knowledge of the ingredients used in food
preparation. Studies are underway, including work with
the CHNS, to collect adequate recipe data to provide at
least an understanding of the average components of
current dishes consumed in China.
Assessment of oil and other condiment use
In China, an additional problem relates to the measure-
ment of cooking oil and other condiments used in the food
preparation process, since the Chinese FCT is based on
food as purchased and not as cooked. For this reason,
measurement of cooking oil would have been omitted
from the traditional 24-hour recall undertaken in China.
Stir-frying is a major cooking method for Chinese dishes
and there is no standard recipe available for most dishes.
Any combination of vegetables and meat is regarded as a
dish. As we shall show, the amount of cooking oil used
with each dish varies considerably from family to family.
Since the amount of each dish consumed by each
individual within the household varies significantly, a
method of allocating oil between household members was
developed that is based on meat and vegetable consump-
tion. The proportion of meat and vegetables consumed by
each individual from the total household consumption of
these food groups is calculated. This proportion is used to
allocate household cooking oil to each individual.
Underlying this is the knowledge that Chinese households
utilise frying of foods predominantly for dishes containing
vegetables (including tofu and beans), beef, pork,
chicken, fish and seafood. They combine edible oils,
normally soyabean, peanut and vegetable oils, with these
dishes, but rarely with staple foods containing rice, wheat
flour and other grains.
Following this approach, individual daily consumption
of cooking oils and condiments was estimated from the
household dietary data. These data, based on the food
inventory method and partial weighing and measuring of
the dishes, are a very accurate measure of total household
intake of edible oil. The proportion of these household
oils consumed by each individual, based on their
proportion of the household consumption of vegetable
and meat foods, was added to the 24-hour dietary recall to
measure individual nutrient intakes.
Food grouping system
A variety of ways exist to describe patterns of food
consumption. One might describe single foods, food
groups or foods by level of processing. One might also
describe food use by the place where foods are purchased
or consumed (at home vs. away from home), by time of
day or by specific meal or snack patterns. These
possibilities led a working group of University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill (UNC-CH) and Chinese Institute of
Nutrition and Food Safety (INFS) researchers to develop a
food grouping system that summarises intakes of foods in
a nutritionally meaningful way. The complexity of eating
behaviour has led most researchers to use simple food
grouping systems such as those measuring intakes of 8­10
food groups such as starchy staples (cereal-based foods),
meats, dairy products, and so forth. We feel that this
approach aggregates foods into too few food groups to
pick up important shifts in eating behaviour and misses

key food trends that have important implications for
health. For instance, many studies have examined overall
dairy or milk consumption whereas the health effects of
consuming higher- and lower-fat milks, or butter and
margarine, are quite different.
The food grouping system that we have used separates
all foods into 39 descriptive and nutrient-based groups.
Initially major food groups were based on food
groupings used by the INFS. Then fat and b-carotene
compositions were used to develop more refined food
groupings, and nutrient thresholds were used to separate
major food groups into more distinct, nutrient-based
food groups.
Results
Recipes
There was a large number of recipes consumed, most of
which are not found in any Chinese restaurant. Rather the
common dishes are stir-fried dishes such as zhu rou chao
qing jiao containing fresh pepper and pork and xi hong
shi chao ji dan containing tomato and eggs.
It would be possible to replace ingredients with recipes
if there were minimal nutritionally important differences in
the composition of recipes between persons from various
geographic entities (urban vs. rural, between provinces)
and socio-economic groupings (e.g. income levels). As we
show this is not the case. The most interesting difference is
seen by examining Table 1. We selected one of the most
common recipes, a stir-fried pork and pepper dish, used
by our sample households. Each adult consumed about
110 g of this dish, half of which was pork. The fatty pork
found in less than 2% of the recipes contains over 90% fat
and has an energy density double that of normal pork
and over five times that of lean pork. The normal pork,
used in 77% of the recipes, is very high in fat and energy
density also. Not only are there large variations in the
distribution of pork in this dish, but, as the first two rows
show, the amount of pork varies between urban and
rural areas.
As shown in Table 2, stir-fried tomato and eggs, another
common recipe, also varies widely in consumption with
rural adults consuming much more than those in urban
areas. There are differences of about 10% in the
proportion of eggs in this dish.
The energy density of these dishes and the total fat
they contributed to the diet varied considerably
between each province and between urban and rural
areas in all provinces (unreported results). For instance,
in one province (Hubei), urban residents consumed an
average of 46 g of pork and rural residents consumed
an average of 59 g of pork (n ¼ 311 persons) in the
dish zhu rou chao qing jiao. In another higher
consumption province (Guizhou), among 693 persons,
an average of 61 g of pork was consumed per 100 g of
the dish in urban areas and 65 g of pork among the
rural residents.
A second methodological issue related to use of a recipe
relates to AFH consumption. For this component of the
diet, the absence of a recipe file may be deleterious.
Without a recipe file, consumers are asked to remember
the food content of these dishes prepared and cooked by
others. There is potential for systematic error if people
underestimate components of AFH food.
Little research has been undertaken on the proportions
of food consumed away from home in China. Even in
1997, AFH food intake in China represents a low
proportion of total energy intake (Table 3). Yet, as these
results show, AFH food consumption is associated with
income and urban residency. China is urbanising rapidly
and also continues to experience a very rapid growth in
income per capita. Thus, we would expect AFH intake to
grow as a proportion of overall consumption. What is
remarkable is that in 1989 there was virtually no

meaningful food intake from food stalls and restaurants,
and for the total sample this has grown to 4% of energy by
1997. This is still a very small figure compared with studies
we did in the Philippines and elsewhere in Asia (e.g.
Bisgrove and Popkin5).
Assessment of oil allocation
As noted above, the CHNS measures oil consumed
separately for each household. Table 4 illustrates the mean
of daily intakes of selected nutrients by the traditional
24-hour recall and the modified 24-hour recall method
used by the CHNS. The mean intake was separated into
households with and without guests plus AFH intake. The
most relevant group is the no guest and no AFH group. In
this group, the mean intake of fat was 55.5 g for the
modified method and 27.0 g for the traditional 24-hour
dietary recall method, respectively. This is a very large
difference and is reflected in large differences in the
energy and percentage of calories from fat measures. It is
important to note that the adjustment methods change the
protein measure only slightly and have their major effects
on fat intake as we show elsewhere6.
The dietary transition in China
Using the UNC-CH­INFS food grouping system, we
summarise the change from 1989 to 1997 for Chinese
adults aged 20­45 years in a number of components of
their diet.
In Table 5, we present data on food diversity. We
counted the number of food groups consumed by each
person and present mean intake and the proportion with
high, medium and low numbers of food groups
consumed. There is a marked increase in diversity of the
Chinese diet across all groupings of socio-economic status.
The urban increase is particularly noticeable. Over time,
the proportion of Chinese of all income groups who
consume less than eight food groups has declined while
those who consume more than 10 food groups has
increased considerably.
The shift in foods consumed is considerable. We
highlight a few points in Table 6. One is the reduction in
grain intake and its replacement by other foods. This
includes large reductions in coarse grain intake in rural
areas (these same declines occurred earlier in urban areas)
and declines in refined grain intake. A second is the
reduction in vegetable intake in rural areas with no change
in urban vegetable intake. Related are increases in edible
oils, meat and meat products, and eggs.
The effect of these shifts towards a more diverse diet,
and one with a marked shift away from traditional low-
energy-density high-fibre foods toward more meat, oil and
other higher-energy-density foods, is linked with two
important nutritional effects. One is greater overall
nutrient density as is shown in Table 7. The overall
increase in energy density of the Chinese diet is from 2.20
to 2.42 kcal g21. This is a considerable increase as reviews
on the subject note7,8.
Thesecondeffectisa markedreductionintheproportion
of Chinese people with low-fat diets and much greater
consumption of a higher-fat diet. In fact, Table 8 shows that
less than 4% of the Chinese adults in the CHNS sample
consumed a low-fat diet in 1997, down from over 18% in
1989. The higher-fat diet is nowconsumed byover a third of
all Chinese adults aged 20­45 and over 60% of adults
residing in urban areas. The new Chinese FCT do not have
saturated fat measures for all foods so we present fat from
animal sources as a crude proxy. This shows the large
increase in animal fat intake, particularly in urban areas.

Asian and international dietary shifts
Other research has shown a number of other key points
about dietary change. We just note each of these here.
They include the following.
. A rapid increase in the proportion of sweeteners and
vegetable oil as key markers of urbanisation among
lower-income countries. There is no research on the
composition of edible oils as they might affect national
health, but there are some data to indicate that red palm
oil might be more healthy whereas edible oil with high
trans-fatty acid content would be more unhealthy. For
instance, one study has found trans-fatty acid levels of
about 50% in dalda, a vegetable ghee widely consumed
in India (Willett, personal communication).
. A shift in food sources of energy across most developing
countries that is comparable to China, but that has
usually changed at a much lower pace. Edible vegetable
oil intake predominates as a marker of dietary change in
Asia and Africa.
. There are many variants in the types of staples that are
consumed at each stage of the transition, as well as in
the relative position of meat and meat products, poultry,
fish and seafood, and dairy and dairy products at each
stage of dietary change between countries as well as
within countries. For instance, India is a high dairy
consuming country. This is important since eggs and
dairy products are such an important source of saturated
fats in the diet. Indian consumption of ghee, a
particularly high saturated fat product, is important in
that a high consumption of saturated fat is closely
related to chronic diseases.
Discussion
Unique features of transitional economies require special
methods to capture accurately dietary change. China is
used as an example. The traditional eating pattern in China
involves the preparation and serving from a common plate
of a limited number of complex dishes. These dishes
consist of main dishes of mainly staples together with side
dishes of meat and vegetables, placed in the centre of the
table in big bowls or plates for all people to share. This
pattern of household consumption from common plates
increases the difficulty of obtaining an accurate measure-
ment of individual food consumption. This mode of eating
has hindered the development of individual dietary intake
data collection methods in China, as they were felt to
reduce the validity and precision of the individual 24-hour
recall method.
One of the more important factors differentiating classes
as well as transitional countries is edible oil intake. The
collection of household use of edible oil, and the
development of a method specific to each country to
allocate this oil to each individual in the family, appears
to be important as a means of improving the quality of
24-hour recall data. The large differences found between
the 24-hour and household inventory methods when the
adjustment for cooking oil was removed demonstrate this
clearly. The large variation in recipe composition was
demonstrated for China and it is clear that recipe methods
need to be used in limited ways. It is also clear that edible
oil intake is so responsive to income and prices, and varies
so greatly, that it must be measured separately.

At the same time, the rapid increases in AFH intake,
particularly among urban residents, means that an
increasingly larger proportion of each person's diet will
comprise dishes and foods processed in restaurants and
stalls. A recipe file must be developed to capture this
component of the diet. At this time such recipe files, if they
exist, are not based on samples of such dishes from many
food stalls and restaurants.
Some of the methods used to study dietary change in
China appear to represent methodological issues that are
relevant to all developing countries, or most certainly
those in Asia and Africa. One is the measurement of
household intake of edible oil and the development of a
way to allocate this among household members. Other
methods, such as dealing with consumption from a
common plate and the need to link individual recall and
household measurement to ensure accurate measures, are
important for many countries but not all.
A third method, the collection of recipe ingredients at
the household level, may be required quite generally.
However, little research on the composition of complex
dishes exists so we cannot generalise from our findings.
A fourth issue, the increase in AFH consumption in
restaurants and food stalls, may be much more important
in other countries. In one large study of urban Filipino
women, it was found that about 25% of their energy intake
and about 45% of their fat intake come from AFH
consumption5. There is extensive anecdotal evidence on
the importance of AFH intake, but few rigorous large-scale
analyses9.
The changes in diet are so rapid in transitional
economies as presented here for China, and elsewhere
for Brazil, South Korea and other countries, that greater
attention must be paid to methodological issues such as
those noted in this paper10,11.
