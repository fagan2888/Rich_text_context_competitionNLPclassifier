Introduction
Immunoglobulin A (IgA) nephropathy (IgAN) is the most
common glomerulonephritis worldwide,1­4 progressing to
end-stage renal disease (ESRD) within 10 years of diagno-
sis in approximately 15%-25% patients.5 A series of rand-
omizedcontrolledtrialsdemonstratedthatrenin-angiotensin
system (RAS) blockade using angiotensin-converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and angiotensin-receptor
blockers (ARBs) decreased urinary protein6­10 and sup-
pressed progression of IgAN.6,7 RAS blockade is regarded
as a major treatment strategy to prevent the progression of
IgAN.11,12
Recent studies reported that intrarenal expression of
angiotensinogen, a key regulator of RAS activity, is
enhanced in IgAN patients13,14 and is correlated with uri-
nary angiotensinogen level, a surrogate marker of intrare-
nal RAS activity.14 Urinary angiotensinogen level predicts
renal prognosis in patients with chronic kidney disease,15
including IgAN.16 RAS blockade is likely to suppress

Abstract
Introduction: Little is known about genetic predictors that modify the renoprotective effect of renin-angiotensin
system (RAS) blockade in IgA nephropathy (IgAN).
Materials and methods: The present multicenter retrospective observational study examined effect modification
between RAS blockade and three RAS-related gene polymorphisms in 237 IgAN patients, including ACE I/D (rs1799752),
AT1R A1166C (rs5186) and AGT T704C (rs699).
Results: During 9.9 ± 4.2 years of observation, 63 patients progressed to a 50% increase in serum creatinine level. Only
ACE I/D predicted the outcome (ACE DD vs ID/II, hazard ratio 1.86 (95% confidence interval 1.03, 3.33)) and modified
the renoprotective effect of RAS blockade (p for interaction between ACE DD and RAS blockade = 0.087). RAS blockade
suppressed progression in ACE DD patients but not in ID/II patients (ACE ID/II with RAS blockade as a reference; ID/II without
RAS blockade 1.45 (0.72, 2.92); DD without RAS blockade 3.06 (1.39, 6.73); DD with RAS blockade 1.51 (0.54, 4.19)), which
was ascertained in a model with the outcome of slope of estimated glomerular filtration rate (p = 0.045 for interaction).
Conclusion: ACE I/D predicted the IgAN progression and the renoprotective effect of RAS blockade in IgAN patients
whereas neither AT1R A1166C nor AGT T704C did.

intrarenal RAS activity and therefore improve renal prog-
nosis of IgAN patients. Accordingly, the patients with
higher intrarenal RAS activity potentially reap the greater
benefit of RAS blockade. Strong candidates affecting
intrarenal RAS activity are RAS-related gene polymor-
phisms, including angiotensin-converting enzyme ACE
insertion/deletion (I/D) polymorphism (rs1799752).
Compared with ACE II/ID subjects, ACE DD subjects
have higher circulating and tissue ACE level,17­19 suggest-
ing that they may be amenable to treatment with RAS
blockade.
The objective of the present multicenter retrospective
observational study was to examine whether three major
RAS-related gene polymorphisms modify the renoprotec-
tive effects of RAS blockade in IgAN patients. This study
is one of the largest genetic studies of IgAN (n = 237) and
involved the longest observational period (9.9 ± 4.2 years),
thus providing pivotal information for establishing a thera-
peutic strategy of RAS blockade in IgAN patients.
Materials and methods
Participants
Genetic and clinical data of 237 IgAN patients included in
the present study were derived from our previous study,
Polymorphism REsearch to DIstinguish genetic factors
Contributing To progression of IgA Nephropathy
(PREDICT-IgAN).20­22 Briefly, between January 1990 and
December 2005, 1132 patients aged 15 years were diag-
nosed with IgAN by kidney biopsy at the Osaka University
Hospital, Osaka General Medical Center and Osaka Rosai
Hospital in the Osaka prefecture, Japan. Among 482
patients who visited these hospitals between April 2006
and March 2008, 429 patients participated in PREDICT-
IgAN. Of 281 patients aged 18 years with 0.3 g/day of
urinary protein and 15 ml/min/1.73 m2 of estimated glo-
merular filtration rate (eGFR), 40 patients with RAS
blockade (ACEIs (n = 31) and ARBs (n = 10)) at kidney
biopsy were excluded, because RAS blockade at kidney
biopsy might influence baseline prognostic confounders
and potentially lead to the biased estimates of associations
between RAS blockade and IgAN progression (prevalent
user bias).23 After excluding one patient with malignant
hypertension at kidney biopsy and six patients with miss-
ing baseline data, a final 237 IgAN patients were enrolled
in the present study. The study protocol was approved by
the ethical committee of Osaka University, Osaka General
Medical Center and Osaka Rosai Hospital.
Measurements
Based on previous genetic studies of RAS-related gene
polymorphisms, we selected three major RAS-related gene
polymorphisms as possible predictors of the renoprotective
effect of RAS blockade: ACE I/D (rs1799752),17 angioten-
sin II type 1 receptor AT1R A1166C (rs5186)24 and angio-
tensinogen AGT T704C (rs699).25 Clinical characteristics
collected at kidney biopsy included age, gender, smoking
status, mean arterial pressure (diastolic blood pressure +
[systolic blood pressure ­ diastolic blood pressure]/3),
hypertension (defined as systolic blood pressure  130
mmHg, diastolic blood pressure  80 mmHg or use of anti-
hypertensive agents including calcium channel blockers,
-blockers, -blockers and thiazides), serum creatinine
level, eGFR based on the Japanese equation (eGFR (ml/
min/1.73m2) = 194 × serum creatinine [mg/dl]­1.094 × age
[year]­0.287 (× 0.739 if female))26 and urinary protein level
and urinary occult blood. The values of eGFR and urinary
protein were stratified into four categories (<45, 45­59,
60-89, and 90 ml/min/1.73 m2) and three categories
(<0.50, 0.50-0.99 and 1.00 g/day), respectively. The val-
ues of urinary occult blood were measured using dipstick
and were stratified into three categories (negative or trace,
1+ or 2+ and 3+ or more). Smoking status was based on a
questionnaire completed at admission for kidney biopsy.27
Nonsmokers and past smokers were combined into a single
category (non- or past smokers) because the number of past
smokers was very small (n = 7). Therapeutic interventions
assessed were RAS blockade, including use of ACEIs and/
or ARBs, and use of immunosuppressants, including corti-
costeroids and other immunosuppressive agents. As long-
term survivors might have more opportunities to receive
therapeutic interventions in an observational study, thus
potentially biasing their effectiveness (survivor treatment
selection bias),28,29 we confined the therapeutic interven-
tions to those initiated within one year of kidney biopsy.
The observational period was defined as the time from
kidney biopsy to incidence of ESRD or the last measure-
ment of the serum creatinine level before September 2009,
whichever came first. The study outcomes were an irre-
versible 50% increase in the serum creatinine level at kid-
ney biopsy and the slope of eGFR (ml/min/1.73 m2 per
year), which was calculated based on serum creatinine lev-
els at kidney biopsy and the end of the observational
period. To clarify the clinical course of blood pressure and
urinary protein after initiating RAS blockade, we assessed
blood pressure and dipstick urinary protein at one and two
years after kidney biopsy. Measurements closest to year 1
and 2 within a caliper width of 60 days were collected.
Statistics
Clinical characteristics of patients with and without RAS
blockade within one year of kidney biopsy and clinical
courses of blood pressure and dipstick urinary protein
within two years of kidney biopsy were compared using
the Student's t test, Wilcoxon's rank sum test and 2 test as
appropriate. Genotype frequencies of three polymorphisms
in the Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium were compared
Teranishi et al. 635
between the patients with and without RAS blockade, by
using the 2 test. Each gene polymorphism had three geno-
types: major homozygote, heterozygote and minor
homozygote. The associations between each polymor-
phism and the outcomes were examined using dominant
models (homozygote of nonrisk allele vs heterozygote/
homozygote of risk allele) and recessive models (homozy-
gote of risk allele vs heterozygote/homozygote of nonrisk
allele). Based on previous studies, we classified the fol-
lowing as risk alleles: ACE D allele of ACE I/D,30­32 C
allele of AT1R A1166C24 and C allele of AGT T704C.25 We
did not analyze dominant or recessive models with <10%
frequencies of minor homozygotes because a small sample
size would hinder any meaningful statistical analysis.
Genetic predictor of IgAN progression were identified
using facility-adjusted Cox proportional-hazards (CPH)
models and multivariate CPH models adjusting for facility
and clinically relevant factors. To identify genetic predic-
tors of the renoprotective effectiveness of RAS blockade,
we examined the effect modification between each RAS-
related gene polymorphism and RAS blockade in a multi-
variate CPH model. Because a test for interaction is
generally conservative, p for interaction <0.1 was regarded
as statistically significant.33 To clarify the effect modifica-
tion, patients were classified into four categories based on
gene polymorphisms, and RAS blockade and their hazard
ratios were calculated in multivariate CPH models. As a
sensitivity analysis, the effect modifications of each gene
polymorphism and RAS blockade were examined using
multivariate linear regression model with the slope of
eGFR as the outcome.
Normally distributed continuous variables were
expressed as mean ± SD, and non-normally distributed
continuous variables were expressed as median (interquar-
tile range). Categorical variables were expressed as num-
ber (proportion). Statistical significance was defined as
p < 0.05, if not specified. All statistical analyses were per-
formed using STATA version 11 (STATA Corp., College
Station, TX, USA).
Results
The baseline characteristics of 237 IgAN patients are pre-
sented in Table 1. Within one year of kidney biopsy, 124
patients (52.3%) received RAS blockade, including ACEIs
(n = 95 (76.6%)) and/orARBs (n = 43 (34.7%)). Compared
to those without RAS blockade, patients with RAS block-
ade were significantly male predominant (57.3% vs 33.6%,
p < 0.001), hypertensive (58.1% vs 45.1%, p = 0.047) and
had a higher serum creatinine level (median 0.9 (interquar-
tile range 0.7, 1.1) vs 0.8 (0.6, 1.0) mg/dl, p = 0.002).
Genotype frequencies of the RAS-related polymorphisms
were not significantly different between patients with and
without RAS blockade. Because of the small sample size
(<10%) of minor homozygotes, a recessive model of AT1R
A1166C (CC; n = 1 (0.4%)) and a dominant model of AGT
T704C (TT; n = 6 (2.5%)) were not assessed in subsequent
analyses.
The predictors of a 50% increase in serum creatinine
level were assessed using facility-adjusted and multivari-
ate CPH models (Table 2). During 9.9 ± 4.2 years of the
observational period, 31 (25.0%) patients with RAS block-
ade experienced a 50% increase in serum creatinine level
and 12 (9.7%) progressed to ESRD. In comparison, 32
(28.3%) patients without RAS blockade experienced a
50% increase in serum creatinine level and 13 (11.5%)
developed ESRD. In facility-adjusted CPH models, ACE
DD was significantly associated with a 50% increase in
serum creatinine level (vs ID/II, hazard ratio 1.97 (95%
confidence interval 1.15, 3.40), p = 0.014), along with
older age, male gender, current smokers, lower eGFR level
and higher urinary protein level (Table 2). After adjusting
for clinically relevant factors, ACE DD (vs ID/II; 1.86
(1.03, 3.33), p = 0.038), current smokers (vs non-/past
smokers; 2.41 (1.38, 4.20), p = 0.002) and lower eGFR (vs
eGFR 90 ml/min/1.73 m2; 60-89 ml/min/1.73 m2 1.02
(0.46, 2.23), p = 0.969; 45-59 ml/min/1.73 m2, 1.32 (0.51,
3.41), p = 0.562; <45 ml/min/1.73 m2, 5.02 (1.94, 12.9), p
= 0.001) were identified as significant predictors of a 50%
increase of serum creatinine level. No other genotype was
associated with a 50% increase of serum creatinine level
(Table 3).
To identify genetic predictors that modify the renopro-
tective effectiveness of RAS blockade, effect modifica-
tions between each RAS-related gene polymorphism and
RAS blockade were examined in multivariate CPH mod-
els. A significant interaction was observed in a recessive
model of ACE I/D polymorphism (p for ACE DD * RAS
blockade = 0.087) but not in other models (Table 3). To
clarify the effect modification between ACE I/D and RAS
blockade, patients were categorized into four groups based
on ACE I/D and RAS blockade (Figure 1). The hazard
ratio of ACE DD patients with RAS blockade was remark-
ably lower than that of ACE DD patients without RAS
blockade; however, this trend was not observed in ACE
ID/II patients (ACE ID/II without RAS blockade as a refer-
ence; ID/II patients with RAS blockade, 1.45 (0.72, 2.92),
p = 0.292; DD patients without RAS blockade, 3.06 (1.39,
6.73), p = 0.006; DD patients with RAS blockade, 1.51
(0.54, 4.19), p = 0.432). RAS blockade approximately
halved the risk of a 50% increase in serum creatinine level
in ACE DD patients, whereas it did not in ACE ID/II
patients.
A sensitivity analysis effect modification between ACE
I/D and RAS blockade was also ascertained, with the slope
of eGFR as the outcome. The slopes of eGFR of ACE ID/
II patients without RAS blockade, ID/II patients with RAS
blockade, DD patients without RAS blockade and DD
patients with RAS blockade were ­1.2 (interquartile range
­2.6, ­0.2), ­1.4 (­2.9, 0.0), ­2.3 (­4.8, ­0.6), and ­1.7
636 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(3)
(­2.8, ­0.2) ml/min/1.73 m2 per year, respectively. A mul-
tivariate linear regression model adjusting for the clini-
cally relevant factors determined a significant effect
modification between ACE I/D and RAS blockade (p for
ACE DD * RAS blockade = 0.045). A similar effect modi-
fication was observed in the multivariate linear regression
model (Figure 1(b)).
Similar effect modification between ACE I/D polymor-
phism and RAS blockade was observed in dipstick urinary
protein within two years of kidney biopsy (Figure 2). At
one year after kidney biopsy, the proportion of negative or
trace urinary protein of ACE DD patients with RAS block-
ade was significantly higher than that of ACE DD patients
without RAS blockade (56.2% vs 15.8%, p = 0.012). At
two years after kidney biopsy, proportions of negative or
trace urinary protein and also 1+ of urinary protein were
significantly different between ACE DD patients with
RAS blockade and those without RAS blockade (negative
or trace urinary protein, 60.0% vs 22.8%, p = 0.027; 1+
of urinary protein 86.7% vs 50.0%, p = 0.026), even though
six (33.3%) patients without RAS blockade within one
year of kidney biopsy received RAS blockade two years
after kidney biopsy. In contrast, proportions of dipstick
urinary protein were not significantly different at one and
two years after kidney biopsy between ACE II/ID patients
with RAS blockade and those without RAS blockade,
except a small difference in 1+ of urinary protein one
year after kidney biopsy (76.0% vs 59.7%, p = 0.021). The

findings described above were hardly ascribed to blood
pressure control because mean arterial pressures at one and
two years after kidney biopsy were comparable between
the patients with RAS blockade and those without RAS
blockade (Figure 3).
Discussion
The present study showed that the ACE I/D predicted
IgAN progression and the renoprotective effectiveness of
RAS blockade in 237 IgAN patients. Compared with ACE
II/ID patients, ACE DD patients were at higher risk of
IgAN progression and RAS blockade halved their risk,
mitigating their genetic disadvantage (Figure 1). These
findings suggest that ACE I/D is a potentially useful
marker to identify patients who will clinically benefit from
RAS blockade. Compared with the previous studies assess-
ing the associations between RAS-related gene polymor-
phisms and IgAN progression, this study is the third largest
genetic study with 237 IgAN patients, following two larger
studies (n = 52734 and 26735), and has the longest observa-
tional period (9.9 ± 4.2 years). Furthermore, we performed
a comparative assessment of three major RAS-related
gene polymorphisms and carefully controlled for several

with 50% increase in serum creatinine level (a) and slope of eGFR (b) were assessed using Cox proportional-hazards model and
linear regression models, respectively, after adjusting for facility, clinical characteristics at kidney biopsy (age, gender, smoking status,
hypertension, eGFR, urinary protein and urinary occult blood) and use of immunosuppressants within one year of kidney biopsy.
ACE: angiotensin-converting enzyme; I: insertion; D: deletion; RAS: renin-angiotensin system; eGFR: estimated glomerular filtration rate.
Figure 2. Urinary protein by dipstick test at kidney biopsy and one and two years after kidney biopsy. ACE DD patients with RAS
blockade had higher proportions of negative or trace urinary protein at one year after kidney biopsy (p = 0.012) and negative or
trace urinary protein and 1 of urinary protein at two years after kidney biopsy (p = 0.027 and 0.026, respectively), compared with
those without RAS blockade. In contrast, no significant difference was observed at one and two years after kidney biopsy between
ACE ID/II patients with RAS blockade and those without RAS blockade, except 2+ of urinary protein at one year after kidney
biopsy (p = 0.021).

critical biases in observational studies, which no previous
study took into consideration.
Although multiple studies have described the associa-
tion between ACE I/D and IgAN progression, including
several systematic reviews identifying ACE I/D as a pre-
dictor of IgAN progression,32,36,37 few studies assessed
whether ACE I/D modified the renoprotective effect of
RAS blockade. One exception was the largest genetic
study by Suzuki and colleagues, which included 527
patients with IgAN.34 Their study found that ACE I/D
was not associated with the composite outcome of 100%
increase in serum creatinine level or ESRD in all patients
(n = 527) as well as in patients without RAS blockade
during the entire observational period (n = 333), suggest-
ing that ACE I/D did not modify the renoprotective effect
of RAS blockade. In contrast, the present study revealed
that RAS blockade remarkably improved renal prognosis
in ACE DD patients, but not in ACE II/ID patients
(Figure 1). These conflicting results may be owing to
several biases such as the prevalent user bias23 and survi-
vor treatment bias,28,29 which were deliberately controlled
in our study. Interestingly, a randomized controlled trial,
the Ramipril Efficacy in Nephropathy (REIN) study,
including mostly nondiabetic proteinuric patients,
described an effect modification between ACE I/D and
RAS blockade similar to the present study.38 The inci-
dence of ESRD was significantly suppressed by ramipril
in ACE DD patients, but not in II/ID patients, which cor-
roborates our study findings.
The present study clarified that RAS blockade exerted a
renoprotective effect in ACE DD patients, but not in ID/II
patients. ACE I/D affects the level of circulating and tissue
ACE.39 Serum ACE level was higher in ACE DD subjects
compared with ID/II subjects.17,18 Furthermore, the local
expression of ACE in T-lymphocytes40 and cardiac tissue19
were higher in ACE DD subjects compared with ID/II sub-
jects. A Japanese study of 50 healthy kidney donors
revealed that tubular and glomerular ACE messengerRNA
(mRNA) signals measured using in situ hybridization were
higher in ACE DD subjects than in ID/II subjects,41 indi-
cating that intrarenal RAS was more activated in DD
patients compared to ID/II patients. Although its precise
biological mechanism remains unknown, a recent study
reported that ACE I/D regulated the transcriptional activity
of ACE promoters,42 providing new insight into the direct
influence of ACE I/D on ACE activity. Therefore, ACE DD
patients, who likely have higher activity of intrarenal RAS,
might reap more renoprotective benefits from RAS block-
ade, compared to ID/II patients, as evidenced in the pre-
sent study and REIN study.
The present study had several limitations. First,
indication of RAS blockade was dependent on each
physician and RAS blockade was not uniform in the
present study because of its observational study design.
Figure 3. Mean arterial pressure at kidney biopsy and one and two years after kidney biopsy. No significant difference was
observed between the patients with RAS blockade and those without RAS blockade at one and two years after kidney biopsy in
ACE DD and II/ID patients, although ACE ID/II patients with RAS blockade had higher mean arterial pressure, compared with those
without RAS blockade (95 ± 14 vs 90 ± 11 mmHg, p = 0.011).

Nevertheless, our results were compatible with the
REIN study,38 which is the largest randomized control
trial assessing the efficacy of RAS blockade mainly in
nondiabetic proteinuric patients. The similar findings
support the validity of the present study. Second, minor
genotype frequencies of AT1R A1166C and AGT T704C
were too small to examine their clinical impact on
effectiveness of RAS blockade. A larger cohort is
essential for further investigation. Third, our study
used the candidate gene approach and examined only
one of a large number of gene polymorphisms in ACE.
A previous study of 267 IgAN patients reported an
effect modification between ACE A2350G and RAS
blockade, though this was not ascertained in a multi-
variate model adjusting for clinically relevant factors.35
A broader investigation of RAS-related gene polymor-
phisms is required to identify genetic predictors of the
renoprotective effect of RAS blockade. Fourth, the pre-
sent study assessed the associations between RAS
blockade and RAS-related gene polymorphisms but did
not measure systemic or intrarenal RAS activity. The
precise biological mechanism of effect modification
between the renoprotective effect of RAS blockade
and ACE I/D-dependent RAS activity needs further
clarification. Fifth, a lack of information on the histo-
pathological lesion, one of the conventional prognostic
factors, might affect the results of the present study. A
slightly higher hazard ratio and lower  coefficient of
ACE ID/II with RAS blockade compared with ID/II
without RAS blockade might be due to the unmeasured
histopathological lesion (confounding by indication).
Conclusions
The present study clarified that ACE I/D predicted renal
outcomes and the renoprotective effectiveness of RAS
blockade in IgAN patients. Recognition of ACE I/D poten-
tially provides pivotal information for treatment optimiza-
tion to prevent further progression of IgAN. Further studies
are required to establish a therapeutic strategy based on
both genetic and clinical evidence.
