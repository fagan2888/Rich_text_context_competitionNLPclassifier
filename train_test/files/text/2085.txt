AN APPLICATION OF PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION
TO CONTROL FOR INSTITUTIONALIZATION AT
FOLLOW-UP IN STUDIES OF SUBSTANCE
ABUSE TREATMENT PROGRAMS1

Participants in longitudinal studies on the effects of drug treatment and
criminal justice system interventions are at high risk for institutionalization
(e.g., spending time in an environment where their freedom to use drugs,
commit crimes, or engage in risky behavior may be circumscribed). Methods
used for estimating treatment effects in the presence of institutionalization
during follow-up can be highly sensitive to assumptions that are unlikely to
be met in applications and thus likely to yield misleading inferences. In this
paper we consider the use of principal stratification to control for institution-
alization at follow-up. Principal stratification has been suggested for similar
problems where outcomes are unobservable for samples of study participants
because of dropout, death or other forms of censoring. The method identifies
principal strata within which causal effects are well defined and potentially
estimable. We extend the method of principal stratification to model insti-
tutionalization at follow-up and estimate the effect of residential substance
abuse treatment versus outpatient services in a large scale study of adoles-
cent substance abuse treatment programs. Additionally, we discuss practical
issues in applying the principal stratification model to data. We show via sim-
ulation studies that the model can only recover true effects provided the data
meet strenuous demands and that there must be caution taken when imple-
menting principal stratification as a technique to control for post-treatment
confounders such as institutionalization.
1. Introduction. Each year almost 1.8 million Americans receive alcohol and
other drug treatment services. Efforts to improve these services through research
or provider profiling are hindered by drug treatment clients' high rates of post-
treatment institutionalization, defined here as spending a day or more in a con-
trolled environment (e.g., a jail, prison, hospital, residential treatment or group
home setting) where the possibility of drug use and criminal activity is substan-
tially diminished. By reducing the potential for substance use, institutionalization
masks the potential effects of substance use treatment programs. For example, out-

comes of clients from both effective and ineffective treatment programs will look
the same when they have no access to drugs or alcohol.
The confounding of treatment effects due to institutionalization cannot be
ignored when evaluating substance abuse treatment programs, because institu-
tionalization is so pervasive among drug treatment clients. For instance, in the
Drug Abuse Treatment Outcomes Study [Hubbard et al. (1997)], 40% of the
2,966 clients in substance abuse treatment programs interviewed 12-months af-
ter discharge reported being institutionalized for some part of the preceding year
[U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services, National Institute on Drug Abuse
(2004)]. Among those with any institutionalization, the average number of days
institutionalized out of the past 365 was 115 [U.S. Dept. of Health and Human
Services, National Institute on Drug Abuse (2004)]. Similarly, about 52% of the
sample from the National Treatment Improvement Evaluation (NTIES) [U.S. Dept.
of Health and Human Services, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment (2004), NORC and RTI
(1997)] were institutionalized during the study's 12-month post-treatment evalua-
tion, many for the entire length of the evaluation period.
The confounding effects of institutionalization are not, however, limited to sub-
stance abuse treatment programs. Criminal justice system clients are also at great
risk for being institutionalized following an intervention. Moreover, patients in-
volved in many health studies are at risk for hospitalizations which can limit or sup-
press the measurement of primary outcomes of interest in those studies (e.g., daily
physical activities for a general population or falls for geriatric patients). In all
of these cases, a post-treatment factor (e.g., institutionalization or hospitalization)
whose value is determined after the start of treatment consequently determines the
potential range of the outcome that can be observed, thereby suppressing or cen-
soring the outcome of primary interest. In many situations, inferences are further
complicated by the fact that the confounding factor can take on many levels giving
rise to outcomes which are observed at different values of the confounding vari-
able and invalidating the comparability of outcomes in the treatment and control
groups.
In a recent paper McCaffrey et al. (2007) developed a statistical model to de-
scribe the different possible estimates of the causal effect of treatment in the pres-
ence of institutionalization and the potential confounding effects of institutional-
ization on these estimates. The paper identifies commonly used analytic methods
for estimating treatment effects in the presence of institutionalization and demon-
strates that the estimated treatment effects can vary greatly depending on which
method is employed. The paper also identifies assumptions under which the var-
ious approaches yield unbiased estimates of the treatment effects of interest. Un-
fortunately many of the assumptions required appear unlikely to hold in most real
world applications.
Institutionalization is similar to the problem of incomplete compliance in drug
trials. In both problems, cases assigned to treatment have multiple potential out-
comes that can vary depending on a variable not controlled by the experimenter:
1036 B. A. GRIFFIN, D. F. McCAFFREY AND A. R. MORRAL
dose of the drug (i.e., level of compliance) in drug trials or days institutionalized in
our example. Hence, methods for estimating the dose-response curve from partial
compliance data [Efron and Feldman (1991)] might apply to the institutionaliza-
tion problem. However, these methods make substantial use of the fact that treat-
ment is a complete dose of the drug, whereas, in our example institutionalization
is not related to the amount or type of treatment received but is an external event
that curtails use censoring the outcomes of interest.
The problem of institutionalization is more similar to the problems addressed by
the methods of principal stratification. Developed by Frangakis and Rubin (2002)
for problems where outcomes are unobservable for samples of study participants
because of dropout, death or other forms of censoring (e.g., failure to find employ-
ment in a jobs program), the method identifies principal strata within which causal
effects are well defined and potentially estimable. Roughly speaking, Frangakis
and Rubin (2002) noted that in data with censoring, cases that receive treatment
and have observed outcomes are a mix of cases that would have observed outcomes
under control and those that would not. Similarly, cases that receive the control
condition and have observed outcomes are a mix of cases that would have observed
outcomes under treatment and those that would not. A study participant's censor-
ing statuses under the treatment and control conditions define the strata within the
population, called principal strata. Analyses that condition on cases in the stratum
where participants would be observed under both treatment and control can pro-
vide unbiased treatment effect estimates for that stratum assuming no other biasing
factors. The key innovation to the work of principal stratification is the recognition
that conditioning on censoring statuses under treatment and control is sufficient to
allow for unbiased estimation of treatment effects.
Principal strata notions extend to the problem of institutionalization at follow-
up with only slight modifications to the methods for censored data. In particular,
modifications are necessary because institutionalization can take on more than the
two levels of censored and uncensored. Also, outcomes are observed at all levels
of institutionalization and treatment effects at various levels may be of interest.
Using data from the Adolescent Treatment Models (ATM) study, fielded be-
tween 1998 and 2002 by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Admin-
istration, Center for Substance Abuse Treatment, we aim to examine the effects of
treatment modality (residential versus outpatient) on the 12-month substance use
outcomes for adolescents who participated in the ATM using principal stratifica-
tion. In the ATM, high rates of institutionalization clearly confound the effects of
treatment modality. Adolescents in residential treatment have significantly higher
rates of institutionalization and lower mean drug use frequency outcomes at the
12-month follow-up. Given that institutionalization in the sample can be shown
to yield lower drug use outcomes [McCaffrey et al. (2007)], it is unclear whether
adolescents in residential treatment truly have lower mean values of the outcome
because the treatment is more effective than outpatient treatment or because they
tend to be institutionalized more often.
AN APPLICATION OF PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION 1037
The goal of this paper is to extend principal stratification to control for the con-
founding effects of institutionalization and to evaluate the sensitivity of the ex-
tended model to various assumptions about the data. Section 2 describes the data
from the ATM study and illustrates the confounding effects institutionalization is
likely to have when examining treatment effects in this study. Section 3 describes
the method of principal stratification and its extension in more detail and applies
the method to the ATM data to examine the effects of substance use treatment
modality (residential versus outpatient) on drug use outcomes for adolescents in
the study. Section 4 evaluates the principal stratification method presented using
a series of simulation studies and Section 5 provides a discussion of our findings
and recommendations for practice and future research.
2. Adolescent treatment models study and the institutionalization con-
found. The number of adolescents receiving substance abuse treatment has in-
creased by over 65% in the last 10 or so years and policy makers, clinicians and
parents want to know if treatment is effective and for whom it is effective, as
well as what treatment modalities are best. We address these questions through
a study of the effects of treatment modality (residential versus outpatient) on the
12-month substance use outcomes for adolescents who participated in the ATM
study. The ATM study collected treatment admission and 12-month outcomes data
for new admissions to 10 community-based treatment programs in the United
States, including six residential programs and four outpatient programs [Stevens
and Morral (2003)].
The sample used in the present analysis includes all new admissions to the 10
programs in the main ATM analytic dataset, which was produced in March of
2002. Of these 1,384 cases, 1,256 (91%) completed a 12-month follow-up survey
and provided data on the outcomes of interest. Only cases with follow-up data are
included in the analysis presented below.
For purposes of the illustrations presented in this report, we examine the effects
of treatment modality on the Substance Frequency Scale (SFS), a widely used scale
from the Global Appraisal of Individual Needs (GAIN) [Dennis (1999)], the survey
instrument used at every site for baseline and 12-month outcome assessments. The
SFS averages responses to a series of questions on the frequency of recent drug
use, intoxication and drug problems in the 90 days prior to the 12 month follow-
up.1 It is scaled so that higher values indicate greater substance use and more drug
problems. Days of institutionalization at follow-up is assessed with the maximum
number of days--in the past 90--which the respondent reports being in any of
several different types of controlled environments (e.g., inpatient psychiatric or
medical hospitals, residential treatment facilities, juvenile halls or other criminal
justice detention facilities, etc.).
1In this illustration we multiplied SFS by 90 to make it scale with use in the past 90 days rather
than use per day.
1038 B. A. GRIFFIN, D. F. McCAFFREY AND A. R. MORRAL
Figure 1 shows a scatter plot and smooth of mean SFS versus the number of
months institutionalized for adolescents enrolled in residential and outpatient care
treatment modalities in the ATM. As shown, more adolescents in residential treat-
ment have months of institutionalization greater than 0. In fact, 52% of adolescents
in residential care were institutionalized for at least one day in the past 90 at the
12-month follow-up, while only 38% of adolescents in outpatient care were insti-
tutionalized at follow-up (see Table 1). Figure 1 also reveals the suppression effect
that institutionalization can have on SFS. As the number of months institutional-
ized increases, the observed values of SFS in the ATM data appear to decrease.
This relationship can be seen more clearly in the smooth of SFS versus days insti-
tutionalized also shown in the figure.
In addition to the suppression effect of institutionalization, Figure 1 also clearly
reveals the potential selection effects that exists in this data between adolescents
with and without any days of institutionalization. The mean value of SFS for ado-
lescents who are not institutionalized at follow-up (represented by the black X
above 0 days institutionalized in Figure 1) is markedly lower than the mean val-
ues for adolescents with only a few days of institutionalization (shown along the
smoothed line in Figure 1). The difference in mean SFS between these adolescents
suggests that adolescents who were institutionalized in the 90 days prior to the
12 month follow-up tended to be more difficult cases with higher levels of drug
use than those adolescents not entering institutional settings.

residential and outpatient treatment modalities with smooth of mean SFS by months institutionalized

ization.

Both the suppression and selection effects of institutionalization in the ATM
data could distort inferences about the effects of treatment on SFS. Table 1 on
page 1039 provides weighted descriptive statistics (see below for more details on
weighting) for SFS and institutionalization at follow-up by treatment modality. As
shown, adolescents in residential treatment have higher rates of institutionalization
and lower mean SFS. Given that institutionalization appears to suppress substance
use in this sample, it is unclear whether adolescents in residential treatment have
lower mean values of SFS because they have decreased their substance use in
response to residential treatment or because they tend to be institutionalized more
often.
Unfortunately, as described in McCaffrey et al. (2007), current methods for han-
dling institutionalization are not adequate and require strong assumptions which
are unlikely to hold in practice. In light of these findings, we propose the use of
principal stratification to obtain policy-relevant treatment effects on this data which
appropriately control for the suppression and selection effects institutionalization
can have on SFS.
3. Principal stratification. Principal stratification was developed by Fran-
gakis and Rubin (2002) as a method for accounting for post-treatment confounds
within the context of the Neyman­Rubin causal model. Hence, we begin by ex-
tending the Neyman­Rubin causal model to account for institutionalization and
then turn to describe the specific innovations of the principal stratification ap-
proach.
3.1. A causal model for treatment effects in the presence of institutionalization.
We start by considering the treatment effect of a single intervention versus a control
in the simple case without any institutionalization. In this case, the Neyman­Rubin
causal model [Holland (1986), Pearl (1996)] considers two potential outcomes and
one random variable for each case in the study. The potential outcomes are Y0, the
outcome after receiving the control condition, and Y1, the outcome after receiv-
ing the treatment condition. Throughout we assume that the Stable Unit Treatment
Value Assumption (SUTVA) [Rubin (1990)] holds so that for each case the poten-
tial outcomes are unique and well defined.
1040 B. A. GRIFFIN, D. F. McCAFFREY AND A. R. MORRAL
The treatment effect for each individual is Y1
-Y0. Typically this is summarized
by its mean across study participants. However, we cannot directly estimate the
treatment effect for individual cases or the mean across cases because cases cannot
be observed under both the treatment and the control conditions. The condition un-
der which each case is observed is determined by the random treatment assignment
variable T , which equals 1 for treatment and 0 for control. When T = 1, we ob-
serve Y1, otherwise Y0 is observed. This results in the random variable Yobs
= YT .
Unbiased estimation of the average treatment effect is possible if cases with
T = 1 have the same expected values of their potential outcomes as cases with
T = 0. Under this assumption, E(Yobs
|T = 1) = E(Y1) and E(Yobs
|T = 0) =
E(Y0), where expectation is over the participating cases. Hence, the difference
in the observed treatment and control means yields an unbiased estimate of the
average causal effect of treatment.
Consistent estimation is also possible in situations where treatment assignment
might depend on observable characteristics, such as observational studies where
study participants self-select into the treatment programs being studied. In such
circumstances, consistent estimates can be obtained by comparing the means for
cases with the same probability of treatment and using propensity score weights
to adjust for selection effects into a particular treatment [Rosenbaum and Rubin
(1983)].
In the presence of institutionalization, the Neyman­Rubin causal model de-
scribed above must be expanded to allow for cases to have potential levels of insti-
tutionalization, which we denote by Z0 and Z1 for the control and treatment con-
ditions, respectively. The model must also allow for different potential outcomes at
each level of institutionalization. For example, a case might have a different poten-
tial outcome when institutionalized 0 days, compared to 1, 2 or 3 or more days. We
let Zmax equal the maximum possible value for institutionalization. Then, for treat-
ment, T = 1, we label the potential outcomes for a case as Y1
[z], z = 0,...,Zmax
so that Y1
[0] is the potential outcome if assigned to treatment and not institution-
alized during the follow-up period and Y1
[1] is the potential outcome if assigned
to treatment and had 1 day of institutionalization, and so on to Zmax. The potential
outcomes for control are Y0
[z], z = 0,...,Zmax.
Now, for each case, we can define different treatment effects for each of the
different levels of institutionalization, for example, D[z] = Y1
[z] - Y0
[z] such that
D[z] might change with z. While there are multiple causal effects that might be
of interest, not all may be estimable from the data without strong assumptions. We
might, for example, be interested in the average causal effect of D[0], the average
causal effect had no one been institutionalized, which McCaffrey et al. (2007)
refer to as the "unsuppressed treatment effect." Additionally, we might also want
to estimate the average causal effect for cases at each of the observed values of
institutionalization as was considered when the notion of principal stratification
was derived [Frangakis and Rubin (2002)]. We now turn to that concept.

3.2. Principal stratification. To estimate the causal effects of treatment using
the notions of principal stratification, we need a model for both the outcomes and
institutionalization. Specifically, we assume that institutionalization can take on
only a discrete set of values 0,1,...,Zmax for both treatment and control. For
example, if the follow-up interval for observing outcomes is 90 days, then Z1
and Z0 can only take on a value from 0 to 90.
Under this assumption, we can in turn define Zmax
 Zmax principal strata as
shown in Table 2. We define the probability that an individual falls into stratum
(z0,z1) by pz0,z1
= Pr{Z0
= z0,Z1
= z1
} and define a density function for the
potential outcome Yt
[zt
]|Z0
= z0,Z1
= z1 if a person falls into this stratum by
f (y;z0,z1,t) for z0,z1
= 1,...,Zmax, where z0,z1,t denotes the parameter vector
for the assumed underlying density function f and t denotes whether or not an
individual received treatment (t = 1) or control (t = 0). We note that the proba-
bilities, pz0,z1
, do not depend on treatment status because Z0 and Z1 are potential
outcomes and a case's principal stratum remains the same regardless of which
treatment he/she receives. Conversely, the distribution of the potential outcomes,
f , is determined by the principal strata and treatment status of an individual. For
example, if we can assume the potential outcomes are normally distributed, then
we might have separate means and variances in z0,z1,t for each possible pair of
values of (z0,z1) for both treatment and control.
The primary treatment effects of interest in this model are E[D[z]|Z0
= z,
Z1
= z], that is, the treatment effects for individuals with the same level of in-
stitutionalization under both treatment and control. These treatment effects do not
confound changes in institutionalization with other effects of treatment and allow
policy-makers, stake holders and caregivers to evaluate treatment independent of
the potentially costly and undesirable effects on institutionalization. Each average
effect is restricted to cases from a principal stratum. Generalizations to other strata
require additional assumptions.
1042 B. A. GRIFFIN, D. F. McCAFFREY AND A. R. MORRAL
We let Szt ,t denote the set of all cases in condition t whose observed value of
institutionalization equals zt . Then if yi denotes the observed outcome for the ith
case, the likelihood for the observed data is given by
L(Y,Z,T,) =
z1 iSz1,1
z0
f (yi
;z0,z1,1)pz0,z1
(3.1)
×
z0 iSz0,0
z1
f (yi
;z0,z1,0)pz0,z1
.
This mixture distribution results from the fact that only Z1 or Z0 is observed for
each case. A similar likelihood was presented for an application of principal strat-
ification methods for estimating the causal effect of a jobs program [Zhang, Rubin
and Mealli (2005)]. In their model, Zmax was 1 and the potential outcomes Yt did
not exist when Zt
= 1. In our case, outcomes can exist at every level of institution-
alization.
Weights can be easily incorporated into the likelihood function in equation (3.1),
allowing for maximization of a weighted likelihood function. A natural applica-
tion of such a weighted likelihood includes the maximization of the likelihood
when comparing propensity score weighted clients in one treatment program to
unweighted clients in another, as will be illustrated in Section 3.3 below.
For many common distributions, mixture likelihoods like (3.1) can be opti-
mized using the EM algorithm. Theoretically, we can use the EM algorithm to
estimate causal effects with any set of data. However, in practice, the solution is
unlikely to be so simple. First, if there are many levels of Z to model, there will
be many possible levels of institutionalization; then, without any additional struc-
ture, there will be a very large number of parameters to estimate. To diminish the
dimensionality of the problem, one can consider modeling z0,z1,t as low order
polynomials in z0 and z1. For example, we might assume E(Y1
|Z1
= z1,Z0
=
z0) =  + 1z1
+ 0z0
+  z1z0. Second, it is well known that the convergence
of likelihood optimizers for mixture models can be sensitive to the starting values
[Biernacki, Celeux and Gerard (2003), Karlis and Xekalaki (2003), McLachlan
(1988), Seidel and Sevcikova (2004)]. Given the large numbers of mixtures in-
volved in this likelihood and the fact that identification of the parameters will de-
pend on matching the mixing proportions/probabilities across groups, sensitivity to
starting values is likely and careful consideration of these values will be required.
We examine these issues more carefully in Section 4.
3.3. Application of principal stratification to estimating modality effects on SFS
in the ATM. To tease out the effect of treatment modality on SFS in the presence
of institutionalization, we fit a four strata principal stratification model to our data
from the ATM study, where Z0 and Z1 can only take on two values, namely, 0
AN APPLICATION OF PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION 1043
and 1. Thus, we dichotomized days institutionalized such that Zt
= 0 if an indi-
vidual had 0 days of institutionalization and Zt
= 1 otherwise for t = 0,1. We
let t = 1 and = 0 denote residential and outpatient care treatment modalities, re-
spectively. This model allows us to compute treatment effects among adolescents
who would not be institutionalized under both treatment and control and among
adolescents who would be institutionalized under both treatment and control.
Because SFS has a very skewed distribution with many observed zeros (see
Figure 1), we assumed the underlying distribution for Y within each stra-
tum was tobit [Maddala (1983), e.g., f (y;z0,z1,t) = G(0;t
z0z1
,2
t
)1(y0)×
g(y;t
z0z1
,2
t
)1(y>0), where G(y;,2) and g(y;,2) denote the distribution
and density functions, resp., for a normal random variable with mean  and vari-
ance 2]. The parameters t
z0z1
and 2
t
depend on treatment to allow for treatment
effects. As parameterized, t
z0z1
and 2
t
are not the mean and variance of the tobit
distribution but of the truncated normal which defines the tobit.
Because the ATM is an observational study, there were observable differences
in the pretreatment characteristics of youths entering residential and outpatient
care. Given these pretreatment differences, any observed differences in treatment
group outcomes could result either from differential effectiveness of the treatment
modalities, or because of differences in how hard their respective populations are
to treat. In order to isolate just the treatment effects of interest, we must compare
treatments on equivalent cases. Thus, for the case study, we compare the effec-
tiveness of the two modalities on cases like those in the ATM sample who entered
the residential modality. We achieve this comparison by weighting the outpatient
sample so that it closely matches the residential sample in terms of the distribution
of 86 pretreatment variables expected to be related to substance use and treatment
assignment [Morral, McCaffrey and Ridgeway (2004)]. Details on the weighting
and comparison of the weighted groups can be found in McCaffrey et al. (2007).
In the remainder of the analysis reported in this example, we compare the un-
weighted residential sample (n = 770) to the weighted outpatient sample (n = 486,
effective sample size = 125), a comparison designed to examine whether the resi-
dential modality produces better 12-month outcomes than outpatient care for cases
with pretreatment characteristics like those of clients who usually enter residential
care. We maximize the weighted likelihood in (3.1) using the EM algorithm. Pre-
liminary results suggested that estimates could be very sensitive to starting values
used with the EM algorithm. Consequently, we developed the following approach
for selecting starting values.
First, among the residential cases observed to have Z1
= 0, we fit a mixture
model of two normal distributions using a simple EM algorithm [Dempster, Laird
and Rubin (1977)] to obtain initial estimates of the two means and their corre-
sponding mixing proportions for this group. We labeled the two means 1
0,A
and
1
0,B
. Under our model, we know that the observed means for residential cases
with Z1
= 0 is a mixture of 1
00
and 1
01
, so 1
0,A
is an estimate of one of these
1044 B. A. GRIFFIN, D. F. McCAFFREY AND A. R. MORRAL
means and 1
0,B
is an estimate of the other; however, we do not know which is
which. We thus used starting values which allow for both possible mappings in
this group.
We repeated this procedure for residential cases with Z1
= 1 and outpatient
cases for both Z0 equal to 0 and 1. These steps, in turn, yielded preliminary es-
timates of the eight mean parameters of the model and their associated mixing
proportions. All that remained was to determine how the eight means mapped to
the model parameters. There are 16 possible mappings from the preliminary esti-
mates of the simple mixture models to the parameters of the model. For example,
one mapping assumes that (1
0,A
, 1
0,B
, 1
1,A
, 1
1,B
, 0

mates (1
0,0

0,1
, 1
1,0
, 1
1,1
, 0
0,0
, 0
1,0
, 0
0,1
, 0
1,1
). The remaining 15 mappings
are obtained by switching the mapping of A and B for each observed value of
Z1 and Z0 to 0 and 1 exhaustively.
To obtain the final parameter estimates of the model, we ran the EM algorithm
to maximize (3.1) separately for each of the 16 possible mappings of the esti-
mates from the simple mixture models and used as final estimates the solution that
maximized the log likelihood among all 16 runs. Simulations described below sug-
gested that this procedure can successfully recover the global maximum from the
many local maxima.
It is critical that multiple starting values are utilized when applying principal
stratification to data. Figure 2 shows the sensitivity of resulting parameter esti-
mates from the 16 different starting values used in our analysis. The results from
each set of starting values are plotted as vertical bands and denoted by a number
from 1 to 16. Each of the 8 estimated model means is denoted by a row and the
resulting estimated values for each mean are plotted for each set of starting values
using vertical bars. The first row plots the percentage increase in the negative log-
likelihood for each solution compared to the value that minimized it across all sets
of starting values (estimate 11 in Figure 2). Each set of starting values leads to a
different possible solution, all of which represent a local minimum of the negative
log-likelihood in the data. Although the resulting log-likelihood values are very
similar (differing by no more than 2 percent), each solution gives very different
inferences about the estimated strata means and treatment effects that exist within
each stratum. As shown, the solution which gives the minimum negative log like-
lihood value (denoted by estimate 11 in Figure 2) is distinctly different even from
the next best estimate of the model parameters (estimate 6 in Figure 2) which as-
signs the estimated values of the means for 1

in reverse of how they are assigned in the solution. More
generally, it is clear that the alternative solutions tend to find similar values for the
various mean values but "flip" the strata labels associated with those labels.
The mixture of tobit models appears to fit the data well, as shown in Figure 3
which plots the histogram of fitted probabilities for each observed condition in our
data. Goodness of fit can be noted by the grouping of fitted probabilities at 0 and 1

for the cases of each observed condition. These groupings imply that the majority
of our cases have a high probability of falling into one of the two strata of which
their observed condition is a mixture. If there had been a more even spread of
these values, we would worry about the goodness of fit of the model. Moreover,
Table 3 shows that the principal stratification model maintains the marginal means
and probabilities of this model.
The estimated treatment effects from the mixture model are shown in Table 4.
In contrast to the patterns shown in Table 1, when we control for the confound-
ing effects of institutionalization using principal stratification, residential treatment
leads to significantly worse outcomes among adolescents who would experience
the same level of institutionalization under both treatment modalities. The effect

of residential treatment is larger among adolescents who are not institutionalized
under both treatment modalities.
The standard errors for treatment effects within each stratum can be adjusted for
the effects of clustering (e.g., here adolescents are clustered within treatment sites)
by using a Huber­White sandwich estimate of the variance­covariance matrix for
the parameters in the likelihood function [Skinner, Holt and Smith (1989)]. When
we control for clustering within the ATM data, the treatment effects are no longer
significant within the two strata with the same levels of institutionalization under
both treatment modalities.
4. Evaluation of principal stratification. Estimating the treatment effects of
treatment modality via principal stratification requires identification of latent vari-
ables from complex mixture data using mixture proportions. In particular, means
for cases from different principal strata are identified from the mixing proportions

within observed groups. Given that our exploration of starting values suggested
that the identification of strata is potentially weak and that label swapping might
be possible, we felt it important to explore the properties of the principal stratifica-
tion method before interpreting our findings on substance abuse treatment. To our
knowledge, there have been very few studies using either real or simulated data
sets to explore the convergence of the estimation algorithms, the identification of
desired parameters, and the precision of the estimates with varying sample sizes
for treatment effects from mixture models like model (3.1).
4.1. Methods. To evaluate the method of principal stratification, we began by
examining the performance of the four strata model where Z0 and Z1 can only
take on two values, namely, 0 and 1. Additionally, we assumed that the underly-
ing distribution of the outcome, f (y;z0,z1,t), within each strata is normal with
mean t
z0z1
and variance 2
t
, where the means and variances can depend on treat-
ment so that treatment effects can exist. We conducted a simulation study of the
properties of parameters estimated by maximizing (3.1) under this assumed para-
metric model.
First, data was simulated under this model and the impact of sample size, the
value of the principal strata probabilities, and the dispersion of the means within
each level of t and Zt on model performance was examined. Second, data was sim-
ulated under heavy tailed and skewed distributions and analyzed using the normal
model to examine the sensitivity of the normal model to model misspecification.
In each case, we maximized the likelihood using the methods described above and
compared the resulting estimates to the values used in generating the data.
4.2. Results. First, we examined the performance of the estimators for the
four strata model under various assumptions about the sample size per treatment
arm (N), the strata probabilities and the dispersion of the means between strata
within the same level of t and Zt . Figures 4, 5 and 6, respectively, plot the esti-
mated means for the control group, the estimated means for the treatment group
and the estimated probabilities for each strata versus their true values under the
various cases considered. As shown, the method did not begin to perform well un-
til the means within a given level of t and Zt were at least 1.6 standard deviations
away from each other and the sample size within each treatment arm was at least
N = 1000. See supplementary material for tabulated results [Griffin, McCaffrey
and Morral (2008)].
The performance of the estimators was relatively invariant to the true strata
probabilities unless the probabilities were uniform, as shown in the third column
of Figures 4 and 5. Specifically, we examined three cases for strata probabilities,
one in which all four strata had reasonably large probabilities, another in which one
strata had a particularly small probability of 0.05, and a third in which the proba-
bilities were equal. Performance was similar in the two cases where the probabili-
ties were not all equal, as shown in the first and second columns of Figures 4 and 5.

FIG. 4. Simulation results. Plot of fitted means (black dots) versus true values (indicated by dashed
lines) for the four strata in the control group with means for other strata (indicated as dotted gray
lines) for N = 100, 1000 and 5000, different dispersions of the means, and different assumptions
about the strata probabilities.
When the probabilities were equal, the method could not identify the correct map-
ping of the mixture components to the principal strata values because the model
was under-identified. Consequently, the maximum likelihood estimation was un-
able to recover the model parameters.
We also examined the sensitivity of the four strata model to model misspec-
ification [Griffin, McCaffrey and Morral (2008)]. As expected, the method was
sensitive to extremely heavy tailed and skewed distributions. The algorithm ap-
peared to perform well when the data had only moderately heavy tails or moderate
skew.
Unfortunately, our simulation study results suggest that our results for the ATM
study must be interpreted with caution. While the dispersion of means within each
level of institutionalization in the ATM data is 3.04, the effective sample size in the
weighted control group is quite small, only 125, drawing into question the ability

of this model to converge to the correct solution if the principal stratification model
holds in our data.
Our simulation study analysis was repeated for a nine strata model in which Zt
can take on three values, namely, 0,1 and 2. However, a number of problems were
encountered. First, the number of possible sets of starting values (e.g., mappings
between the parameters of the full model to estimates from simple mixture models
fit to data) increased significantly, leading to 2192 possible sets of starting values.
Given the computational demands of such a large number of starting values, we
did not run the EM algorithm for all possible mappings. Instead we calculated
the likelihood at each possible mapping and then tried two techniques for select-
ing reasonable starting values: (i) choosing the 30 starting values which gave the
30 greatest values of the log-likelihood and (ii) choosing the 30 starting values
which represented a spread of the log-likelihood surface. We found that option (i)

yielded the best solution (i.e., the solution which gave the highest value of the log-
likelihood). However, even with a dispersion of means equal to 2.5 and N = 5000
per treatment arm, the best solution from option (i) was unable to recover the model
parameters used to simulate the data (results available upon request).
It is likely that adding more parametric assumptions into the nine strata model
would help improve the fit of the model. For example, one could consider mod-
eling the means within each stratum and treatment group as a linear function of
the value of Z1 and/or Z0. However, as the number of strata increases, more as-
sumptions will be required which may or may not be likely to hold in practice. In-
evitably, extending principal stratification to more strata becomes intractable and
unidentifiable beyond the simple four strata model.
5. Discussion. Institutionalization during the follow-up poses serious chal-
lenges to estimating treatment effects on outcomes following substance abuse
AN APPLICATION OF PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION 1051
treatment because it restricts opportunities to use drugs or partake in other prob-
lem behaviors (e.g., criminal activity or risky sexual activity). If unaccounted for,
it can confound treatment effects and lead to incorrect inferences about the ability
of treatment to produce desirable outcomes. Similar problems can occur in many
other settings, such as criminal justice and mental health outcomes studies where
study participants are also at high risk for institutionalization during the follow-up
period.
Because institutionalization occurs post-treatment, treating it as a covariate in
analyses can lead to biased results since cases with various levels of institutional-
ization might differ in terms of their potential outcomes [McCaffrey et al. (2007)].
Most common approaches to the problem require strong assumptions and the re-
sults can be very sensitive to which assumptions are made and which methods are
used [McCaffrey et al. (2007)]. For example, use of a joint or composite outcome
which looks at the effects of treatment on institutionalization and SFS together
conflates the effects that treatment has on institutionalization with the effects it
has on SFS. Principal stratification allows us to directly model how the treatment
effects on SFS may vary within different levels of institutionalization.
Principal stratification provides a framework for developing causal effects on
outcomes in the presence of post-treatment institutionalization. The key idea is
that causal effects can be obtained by conditioning on cases with equal values for
the observed level of institutionalization for the observed treatment status and the
unobserved level of institutionalization for the unobserved treatment status. In sit-
uations where institutionalization can take on discrete values, the latent principal
strata result in finite mixture models and the parameters of interest can potentially
be estimated. When applied to adolescent substance abuse treatment data in the
ATM study, the method suggests that residential treatment may be less effective
for youth who are likely to experience the same level of institutionalization un-
der both conditions (residential and outpatient). However, the effect is strongest
among those youth who are unlikely to be institutionalized following treatment--
that is, the least problematic users. Alternative analyses [McCaffrey et al. (2007)]
found a similar result which improves our confidence in these findings, despite the
challenges of the method cited above.
As discussed in the Introduction, stakeholders, like parents, want to know if
treatment is effective and for whom it is effective. The principal stratification ap-
proach estimates causal effects for youth in different principal strata. Thus, we aim
to know if treatment is effective for youth within each principal stratum where in-
stitutionalization is constant across treatment conditions. However, the principal
strata do not necessarily provide meaningful classification of adolescents to stake-
holders. An important follow-up to our analysis is to determine if principal strata
membership can be described using measurable and meaningful baseline variables
so that stakeholders might have a better idea about which youths will be best served
by treatment or different treatment modalities.
1052 B. A. GRIFFIN, D. F. McCAFFREY AND A. R. MORRAL
Beyond this application, our investigation of principal stratification suggests
that the potential of principal stratification may be impossible to realize in many
empirical studies. Our study shows that the differences in outcome means among
the principal strata must be quite large (1.6 standard deviation units or larger)
and that the sample sizes must also be very large (N  1000) for estimated ef-
fects to correctly identify which means belong to each principal stratum. Unfortu-
nately, such dispersion of means and sample sizes are much greater than those that
are likely to arise in many applications. With smaller samples sizes and less dis-
persed means, group labels are often switched; for instance, the means of the Z1
=
Z0
= 0 stratum might be incorrectly labeled as the means for the Z1
= 1 and
Z0
= 0, stratum yielding incorrect inferences about treatment effects. Addition-
ally, the switched mean values may be very plausible so that there would be no
indication of misleading results. The limitations of principal stratification must be
considered carefully before using the method in all but the most ideal settings.
As the possible values for institutionalization grow, the problem quickly be-
comes more unmanageable. The number of parameters for the principal strata
and the number of mixtures that need to be identified grow rapidly; even finding
starting values becomes an extremely challenging task as the possible values for
institutionalization grow. Estimation in these contexts will require additional as-
sumptions about the relationship between outcome and institutionalization (e.g.,
outcomes decline linearly with increased institutionalization) and assumptions
about the joint distribution of institutionalization under treatment and control to
make the problem more tractable.
Given the challenges of principal stratification when we consider many values
for institutionalization, a possible option may be to ignore the outcomes from in-
stitutionalized cases and try to estimate an unsuppressed treatment effect restricted
to cases that would not be institutionalized under either treatment or control. Our
approach to starting values could be used and trustworthy estimates might be ob-
tained in some real world settings. The limitation of this approach would be the
inability to generalize the estimates beyond cases that are likely never to be insti-
tutionalized. That is, we could not estimate the unsuppressed effect for all cases
nor could we determine treatment effects on institutionalized youth.
Using a Bayesian approach might address some of the computational problems
with maximizing the likelihood since integrating over a prior helps to reduce sen-
sitivity to the starting values. However, special care would be needed when us-
ing Markov chain Monte Carlo methods to sample the posterior to avoid label
switching of the mixtures within the observed values of institutionalization [Jasra,
Holmes and Stephens (2005)]. Strata label switching will occur because the data
provide only very indirect information about the joint distribution of potential in-
stitutionalization. Use of an informative prior would be one means of overcoming
this limitation of the data via Bayesian analysis. However, this approach is unap-
pealing because analysts are unlikely to be able to make good informed guesses
about the joint distribution so that informed priors would be difficult to choose.
AN APPLICATION OF PRINCIPAL STRATIFICATION 1053
Obtaining sufficient information about the joint distribution of the potential in-
stitutionalization outcomes is a clear challenge to using the framework of principal
stratification to provide useful estimates of treatment effects. One approach to ob-
taining more information about this distribution would be to collect data at base-
line that might be strongly related to the principal strata and use the information
as covariates in the model for the strata probabilities. For institutionalization fol-
lowing substance use treatment this information might include criminal activity,
detailed information about involvement with the criminal justice system, history
with substance abuse treatment, the availability of various types of substance about
treatment and sources of payment for the treatment.
Another approach for increasing the information about the principal strata is to
jointly model multiple outcomes such as multiple indicators of substance use and
criminal activity. Because principal strata are defined by institutionalization and
not by other outcomes, principal strata designation should not depend on which
outcome is modeled. Combining multiple outcomes can therefore provide more
information about the latent principal strata membership and should improve es-
timation of treatment effects for every outcome. A downside of this approach is
the necessity of specifying the joint distribution for multiple outcomes, but the ad-
ditional modeling might be very beneficial for identifying the principal strata and
the accuracy of the resulting treatment effect estimates.
We might consider simply using the principal stratification framework for sen-
sitivity analyses. For example, rather than trying to model the joint distribution of
Z0 and Z1, we might specify the joint distribution in terms of the parameters of the
marginal distributions of Z0 and Z1 and a parameter specifying their correlation.
The value of the correlation parameter could be manipulated to study the sensi-
tivity of the treatment effect estimates to different assumptions about the principal
strata. For example, when institutionalization can take on just two values, we could
specify the correlation by the interaction from a log-linear model. For continuous
institutionalization, we could specify the correlation parameter.
Principal stratification is an important tool for approaching the problem of insti-
tutionalization during the follow-up, because it provides a framework for defining
estimates of interest and possible methods for estimating them. However, it is also
clear that it is not a panacea to the problem because the model parameters are at
best weakly identified and it does not extend easily to problems with many possi-
ble values for institutionalization. The extensions described above provide useful
areas for future research that may significantly improve the application of principal
stratification in real world settings.
