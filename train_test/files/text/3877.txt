Introduction
The popularity of cloud computing is increasing by the day,
it is not just a promise or something only discussed at semi-
nars and conferences anymore. It is the reality to fast, auto-
mated, and inexpensive management of IT resources that
have combined to make information technology a compel-
ling paradigm for greater efficiency and enhanced productiv-
ity. There is an increasing perceived vision that cloud
computing will make computing the fifth utility after water,
electricity, gas, and telephone that will provide the basic
level of computing services considered essential for fulfill-
ing daily life routines (Buyya, Yeo, & Venugopal, 2008).
Cloud computing uses the Internet as its backbone to provide
flexible on-demand and dynamically scalable computing
infrastructure for many applications using any of its four
deployment models: private, public, community, or hybrid
cloud and its three-service delivery models: Software as a
Service (SaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and
Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).
The cloud technology harnesses the web as the ultimate
platform to serve all kinds of users: individuals, businesses,
institutions, the industry, and others. It provides computing
resources on demand on a pay-per-use basis via a cloud ser-
vice provider and is a powerful tool that can deliver sustain-
able advantage (Shimba, 2010). To simply say that cloud
computing can increase productivity is an understatement;
cloud computing can effectively re-design the way busi-
nesses and organizations approach and accomplish their
tasks on daily basis, it is more of a comprehensive infrastruc-
ture that allows for increased streamlining of inter-office
activities (Mell & Grance, 2010).
In the academia, cloud computing is a powerful tool that
offers great scalability and flexibility, making it possible for
students, staff, faculties, administrators, and other campus
users access file storage, databases, and other university
applications anywhere anytime (Jain and Pandey, 2013). The
cloud computing technology has been termed as the "silver

Cloud Computing Adoption Model for
Universities to Increase ICT Proficiency
Safiya Okai1, Mueen Uddin1,2, Amad Arshad1, Raed Alsaqour3,
and Asadullah Shah2
Abstract
Universities around the world especially those in developing countries are faced with the problem of delivering the level
of information and communications technology (ICT) needed to facilitate teaching, learning, research, and development
activities ideal in a typical university, which is needed to meet educational needs in-line with advancement in technology and
the growing dependence on IT. This is mainly due to the high cost involved in providing and maintaining the needed hardware
and software. A technology such as cloud computing that delivers on demand provisioning of IT resources on a pay per use
basis can be used to address this problem. Cloud computing promises better delivery of IT services as well as availability
whenever and wherever needed at reduced costs with users paying only as much as they consume through the services
of cloud service providers. The cloud technology reduces complexity while increasing speed and quality of IT services
provided; however, despite these benefits the challenges that come with its adoption have left many sectors especially the
higher education skeptical in committing to this technology. This article identifies the reasons for the slow rate of adoption
of cloud computing at university level, discusses the challenges faced and proposes a cloud computing adoption model that
contains strategic guidelines to overcome the major challenges identified and a roadmap for the successful adoption of cloud
computing by universities. The model was tested in one of the universities and found to be both useful and appropriate for
adopting cloud computing at university level.

bullet" in the field of educational technology (Mell & Grance,
2010). Hence, some universities especially in more devel-
oped and advanced countries have adopted this technology
for many reasons ranging from reduced cost of hardware
acquisition and maintenance to greater access of web 2.0
applications for teachers and learners and ultimately better
academic outputs (Ercan, 2010). Through the adoption of
cloud computing to support their virtual computing lab, the
North Carolina State University, United States, saves a lot on
software licensing costs. Eastern Washington University in
the United States and Lakehead University in Canada have
also saved plenty of money by outsourcing their email ser-
vices. Also, the University of Washington uses the cloud to
effectively implement collaborative learning for students at
different locations and the Pennsylvania State University,
United States, uses cloud computing to share resources
among its numerous campuses and colleges (Cappos,
Beschastnikh, Krishnamurthy, & Anderson, 2009).
According to James Holt, the vice president and chief infor-
mation officer (CIO) of the University of Virginia, United
States, cloud computing is the real opportunity for the aca-
demia to rethink and re-craft services (Thomas, 2011). The
popularity, advancement in information and communications
technology (ICT) and the use of the Internet has made com-
puting resources more readily available, but the adoption and
implementation level of the cloud technology especially in
developing countries is still very low. Hence, this article
explores into the area of cloud computing to identify the
challenges and reasons for the slow rate of its adoption by
universities and proffers solutions to the problems along with
a roadmap for its successful adoption.
Problem Background
Advancement in technology is evolving at a very fast pace
that is difficult to match, this puts universities around the
world and those in developing countries in particular under
pressure to meet up with latest IT trends such as cloud com-
puting in the educational sector. Cloud technology is still
evolving, and the use of ICT in some developing countries
like Nigerian universities is growing at a rather slow rate,
which is largely due to the cost involved in the purchase and
maintenance of ICT equipments and the poor power supply
in the country (Ume, Bassey, & Ibrahim, 2012).Adopting the
cloud computing technology will help to manage the limita-
tions to the slow pace of ICT growth better because the cloud
technology reduces the cost of delivering IT services and
takes away the burden of having to purchase and provide
maintenance to the high tech equipment needed to meet the
IT needs of students and staff, it is essential for better service
delivery (Gital & Zambuk, 2011).
In the current system in most Nigerian universities, it is
the responsibility of the IT department to meet the needs of
all students as well as academic and administrative staff of
the university, whatever service is needed is directed to the
IT department. The department provides and manages
students and staff email accounts, handles installations, and
upgrades on PCs in the computer labs, cafes, and staff com-
puters. Generally, all IT needs whether minor or major of
students and staff of the university are met directly by the IT
department (Ume et al., 2012). With the adoption of cloud
computing, students and staff can meet their needs directly
from their computers and other devices as long as they are
connected to the Internet. Also, having such a technology
provides a better way to handle disasters as it provides easy
backup and recovery because everything may be thousands
of miles away and will only be provided as a service by a
cloud service provider who's backup and recovery plans are
way better than anything the universities can provide. Even
though the concept of cloud computing is getting more popu-
lar in recent times and quite a number of research has been
done on its benefits to higher institutions of learning, most of
which involves the opportunity to save on the huge cost
involved in the purchase and maintenance if IT devices and
availability of resources housed in the cloud whenever wher-
ever, its adoption rate is still very slow due to the challenges
encountered and issues that come with adopting it.
Challenges of Cloud Computing and Reasons for
Low Rate of Adoption by Universities
Despite the huge benefits of cloud computing; concerns on
the security and confidentiality of data stored in the cloud,
privacy and regulatory compliance, vendor lock-in, location
of the data, legal jurisdiction, and reliability of the cloud ser-
vice provider have been identified as the barriers to cloud
adoption in higher education by Low, Chen, and Wu (2011)
and Mircea and Andreescu (2011), which are similar to the
findings of the survey carried out by researchers of Carnegie
Mellon University. The survey further revealed that for
higher institutions, the challenges of cloud adoption are not
just limited to the risks listed above, but the relative newness
and underdevelopment of cloud services is also one of major
concerns for cloud adoption. (Sultan, 2010). Security and
privacy is a major concern for cloud adopters because valu-
able data reside outside the institutions firewalls, therefore
any hacking or other forms of attack on the cloud vendor's
infrastructure will affect all clients whose data are stored on
the infrastructure. According to Rittinghouse and Ransome
(2010), lack of compliance to the SLA (Service Level
Agreements) by cloud service providers is another reason
behind the slow rate of adoption, because if cloud vendors do
not meet the requirements of the SLA and attend to down-
times prompt performance will be greatly affected.
Legal and jurisdiction issues also pose reasons for con-
cern because legal issues can bind an institution into
unwanted or unsatisfactory conditions, thereby, leading to
legal disputes that can run into years due to laws of the loca-
tion where the data are located. Once the services of cloud
vendors are employed, the institutions no longer have control
over the physical infrastructure where their data are stored;
the average user may not be concerned with where their data
Okai et al. 3
are sitting, but universities hold very vital information of
thousands of people and processes such as research results
and findings that require high levels of confidentiality and
privacy (Cegielski, Jones-Farmer, Wu, & Hazen, 2012). An
example of an institution facing legal issues due to the adop-
tion of Google's public cloud is the Lakehead University,
Canada. The faculty union of the university filed a grievance
with the university complaining that the email system out-
sourced to Google does not protect their privacy and aca-
demic freedom because Google is a U.S. company and
therefore subject to the American law which compels Google
to hand data to the U.S. government if required even without
informing the university (Todd, 2008). Issues like this pose
threats to the privacy of data and hinder the interest of higher
institutions of learning to migrate to the cloud. In developing
countries, however, the rate of adoption of the cloud technol-
ogy is still quite low; hence, universities in this part of the
world will mostly work with copyright laws of the chosen
cloud vendors and that of the location where the vendors'
infrastructures are located; therefore, one of the yardsticks of
choosing vendors will be based on how favorable the copy-
right laws are to the universities.
Problem Statement
Quite a number of works have been done on the benefits,
challenges, and adoption strategies of cloud computing;
however, despite these works, the hype, and predictions on
the increase in the rate of adoption of the cloud technology,
the acceptance level is still very low. In a recent survey con-
ducted by TechTarget from September 2012 to March 2013
on the actual rate of adoption and usage of cloud computing,
the results show that the adoption rate is not rising as expected
with security concerns being the most prominent reason for
the reluctance in the acceptance of the cloud technology. In
view of this, this article attempts to answer the following
research questions:
Research Question 1: How can the challenges of cloud
computing be overcome to increase the acceptance level
and rate of adoption by universities in developing
countries?
Research Question 2: What measures can be put in
place to ensure a safer and more reliable transition to the
cloud?

Saidhbi in the research Cloud Computing Framework for
Ethiopian Higher Education Institutions proposed the imple-
mentation of a central hybrid cloud computing infrastructure
that combines both the current local infrastructure of the uni-
versities as the private cloud and public cloud to enable the
sharing of educational resources and collaboration within
all universities in Ethiopia and the global educational
community, so that Ethiopian higher institutions can enjoy
the benefits of ICT in an efficient and affordable way
(Saidhbi, 2012). The research further states that by deploying
the proposed hybrid cloud model, the risks of privacy and
other security challenges can be avoided as critical and sensi-
tive data will be housed in a private cloud.
In a study on Cloud Computing in Higher Education in
Jordan by Massadeh and Meslah (2013) suggested that
Jordanian universities consider adopting cloud computing as
a way of meeting the growing demands of IT services and
managing the tight budget due to very limited financial sup-
port from the government. The researchers believe that
implementing cloud computing will be a strategy to offer
good business models for the Jordanian universities as they
do not have sufficient resources to manage the required IT
support for development, educational, and research activities
that should be provided in an ideal higher education environ-
ment. Suryawanshi and Narkehde (2012) outlined a cloud
implementation strategy for migrating from the traditional IT
system to the cloud for higher technical institutions. Their
strategy includes having a committee to supervise the imple-
mentation activities and to develop a knowledge base by
attending cloud computing conferences and seminars and
also discussing with cloud vendors.
Tout conducted a study on cloud computing adoption and
transitioning to the cloud by higher institutions; in the study,
the author outlined greater benefits of cloud computing
beyond the traditional advantage of cost reduction of IT
infrastructure and maintenance. Cloud computing adds value
to capital expenses and services provided by universities
and, at the same time, protects the environment through the
use of green technologies (Tout, 2011). Mathew (2012) high-
lights that cloud computing is a revolution in the educational
sector that makes it possible to migrate sensitive data either
to private cloud by using existing resources or the educa-
tional cloud provided and managed by a service provider.
The cloud technology enhances teaching, learning, quicker
more reliable access to information, and gives the ability to
focus more on strategic goals. Ercan (2010) has reviewed the
concept of cloud computing in his study on the Effective use
of Cloud Computing in Educational Institutions and pro-
posed a model to meet the needs of students and staff. In the
proposed model, the author identifies compute resources that
can easily be accessed by users with any devices of their
choice provided on a pay per use model to meet users'
demands as demands scale up and down with appropriate
security that filters the contents being accessed by the users.
Babu, Sarma, Vijaylakshmi, and Kalyankar (2012) in
their research on improving the confidentiality of data stored
in the cloud proposed the master­slave paradigm that calls
for end-to-end encryption and decryption of data to ensure its
integrity from source-provider of the cloud service to the
users' destination to prevent privacy leakage and maintain
the integrity of educational data. When the decision to adopt
the cloud technology has been made, cloud adopters should
4 SAGE Open
consider creating a campus cloud computing roadmap to
guide the institutions' decisions on whether or not to operate
on premises or off premises and a risk assessment guide to
guide the policy makers through the risk assessment and
analysis of cloud-based portfolios (Thomas, 2011).
Proposed Solution
The cloud technology is here to stay; despite its challenges,
the benefits of its adoption greatly outweigh the risks. From
the above discussions, it was very much obvious to develop
a model for proper adoption of cloud computing to provide a
safer and more enjoyable experience for users at the univer-
sity level. To get the best of the cloud technology paradigm,
this article proposes a cloud computing adoption model as
shown in Figure 1, which consists of the following:
1. Strategic guidelines to overcome security and pri-
vacy concerns
2. Strategic guidelines to overcome reliability concerns
of the Cloud Service Providers
3. A roadmap for the successful adoption of cloud
computing
The strategic guidelines should be followed when the
decision to adopt the cloud technology has been made so as
to reduce to the barest minimum the negative impact that
comes with the adoption of the cloud technology of which
security and privacy concerns and reliability of the cloud ser-
vice provider concerns were top of the list in the survey
conducted.
Overcoming the Barriers of Cloud Adoption
From both secondary and primary data collected, it was gath-
ered that the main barriers to cloud computing adoption are
security and confidentiality of data concerns, privacy and
regulatory compliance concerns, and reliability of the service
provider. Overcoming these concerns requires not just pre-
ventive and immediate solutions but also proactive and for-
ward thinking approaches; therefore this article has put in
place the following techniques to help in overcoming these
challenges.

that come with the adoption of cloud computing. Due to the
importance and confidentiality of educational data, the fol-
lowing techniques and guideline should be implemented to
help in overcoming these concerns:
Encryption. This is the process of changing or transform-
ing information into a form that cannot be understood by
any unauthorized person. By using this technique, the data
are translated into a secret code that cannot be understood
by anyone else except those who have the code or password
to decrypt the encrypted information. This will protect the
data and ensure its authenticity and integrity, and further pre-
vent the improper disclosure of confidential educational data
stored in the cloud. Encryption is the main method used to
ensure the security of data stored in the cloud.
Digital signature. Security and privacy concerns can also
be overcome by using digital signatures, an electronic sig-
nature used to authenticate the identity of the user of the ser-
vices provided over the cloud, by using this technique, the
user must provide the appropriate login or access credentials
before they can have access to the information or application
they want to use. This will help to ensure the authenticity,
accountability, and integrity of data in the cloud.
Direct contact with the service provider.A direct contact
should be created between the university and cloud service
provider without the services of an intermediary, because the
more the levels or stages that the data have to pass from the
vendor to the user, the more the chances of the data being
compromised. Direct contact will ensure that data are moved
in one way direction, from the cloud vendor to the university.
Gradual sequence of migration.The migration toward
cloud should not be done all at once, as much as the cloud
offers cost savings, increased agility and efficiency caution
should be taken and the movement gradual with low risks
applications going first. This will give the university time to
see whether the cloud project or the chosen vendor is wor-
thy--if so, then the other applications can be moved step
by step. In overcoming the barriers of security and privacy
concerns, it is important to ensure compatibility between the
university and cloud service providers' systems; by mov-
ing gradually, the compatibility of both parties would have
been ascertained before more sensitive data are moved to the
cloud.
Investigating cloud vendors.The chosen cloud provider(s)
security measures and the kind of security mechanisms,
infrastructure and configuration in place to ensure the
safety of data stored on their cloud, should be thoroughly
investigated. Also, the plan for security events by the ser-
vice provider detailing the responsibilities and actions to
be taken in the event of a security breach should be under-
stood, analyzed, and ensured to be in line with the required
standards set by cloud computing bodies like the NIST
(National Institute of Standards and Technology) and the
CSA (Cloud Security Alliance) to ensure that the right level
of security is provided by the cloud vendors to their clients
and there are appropriate backups in place in case of any
problems or the occurrences of disasters like fire, flood, or
earthquake (CSA, 2010). This investigation is necessary by
adopters of the cloud technology in the educational sector
to ensure constant availability and confidentiality because
of the level of privacy that is required to preserve research
results and other confidential information.
Data splitting.This technique requires the use of more
than one service provider; the data to be stored in the cloud
should be split across different clouds, in a way, that pre-
serves the confidentiality, availability, as well as integrity of
the data. The use of two or more cloud services improves
performance, avoids vendor lock-in, and reduces the risks
of data loss and downtimes as security concerns such as data
integrity, intrusion, and service availability can be controlled
using fault-tolerant protocols across the multiple clouds. The
data splitting technique avails the universities the opportu-
nity to use different clouds for different purposes because
some clouds are better than others for some applications;
for example, the public cloud from Google might be best
for email services whereas Microsoft Azure can be used to
provide both PaaS and IaaS services. As the cloud technol-
ogy advances, synchronizing data across multiple clouds is
easier with the availability of migration solutions and the ser-
vices of cloud-based service providers such as countability
that make it easier to manage multiple cloud providers at the
same time. Similarly, the cost of splitting data on multiple
clouds should be carefully considered, the cost implications
differ depending on the particular pricing scheme; applica-
tions frequently used and kept running for extended periods
may have lower costs than those run for short periods.
Despite the emphasis to ensure that the right deployment
and most suitable service delivery models along with repu-
table cloud service providers are chosen for a safe and reli-
able cloud, it is only natural that sometimes failures will
occur; hence, using the multi-cloud strategy is a better and
more reliable way to handle failures when they happen as it
is most unlikely that services from different providers will be
down at the same time. This technique also avails the univer-
sities the opportunity to shift easily; if suddenly any of the
service providers decide to increase their prices or change
their terms of business, the institutions will simply shut down
from those providers and move to others with more favorable
pricing and terms of business.
Strategic guidelines to overcome reliability of the service provider
concerns.The reliability of the service provider, in other
words trust, is a major obstacle and barrier to the adoption of
cloud computing. Cloud service providers needed to be reli-
able and trusted so that adopters of the cloud technology can
6 SAGE Open
be confident to entrust their vital information to them for
safekeeping. The need to look up, properly research, and
make a comparison between different cloud vendors to
ensure reliability of the chosen vendor(s) cannot be overem-
phasized. This is because information is the live wire of uni-
versities, and all efforts should be put in place to ensure that
moving to the cloud brings true relief, solutions, and
improved services. These can only be achieved, and the
promises of the cloud enjoyed if the cloud vendor used is
reliable and trustworthy. To achieve this and overcome the
barrier posed by lack of trust and reliability of cloud service
providers, the following guidelines should be followed:
Reliability and availability.To ensure that the services in
the cloud are reliable and up and running well at all times,
reliable cloud vendor is required. The chosen cloud service
provider should be one that guarantees service level, uptime
and availability 99% of the time. The chosen vendor should
have redundancy of power, cooling systems, security sys-
tem, servers, storage, excellent Internet connection, and fire
suppression systems among other things to ensure that the
required services are consistently and constantly available.
Reputation of good track record. The chosen cloud vendor
should be one with good track record; this can be ascertained
by how well their services function properly without frequent
downtimes and when they occur, how long they last before
service is fully restored. The reasons behind downtimes and
frequency of occurrence should be considered, this informa-
tion can be gotten by finding out who their customers are and
how well they have enjoyed or not enjoyed the services of
the vendor. This should be carefully considered before data
are moved to any vendors' data center.
Providing security in the cloud.The university must be
assured of tight, well-defined security services in the cloud
before they employ the services of any vendor. These secu-
rity services include identity management, access control
as well as authorization and authentication mechanisms
to ensure the right level of control within the cloud envi-
ronment and that only authorized personnel can make any
changes or additions to the data and applications in the cloud
as a way of ensuring the security, privacy, and confidentiality
of data. The service provider should have a comprehensive
security infrastructure in place at all levels of the services
they provide.
SLA management.The cloud vendors should give guar-
antee by providing service levels for all services they are
offering and ensure to meet the requirements of the SLA.
The SLA should be negotiated to meet the expected level of
service quality and should include refund guarantees or some
kind of penalties if the promised service level is not deliv-
ered. This will keep the service providers on their toes to
meet up with the terms and requirements of the SLA and the
clients assured of quality service delivery.Also, the copyright
laws as contained in the vendors' SLA and that of the loca-
tion where the vendors' infrastructures are located should be
carefully considered before commitments are made.
Transparency and code of practice. The choice of the cloud
vendor should be one that is transparent in their dealings
with clients and follow the code of practice unique to them
as an organization and also that provided by cloud regulatory
bodies to ensure the provision of highly secured and effi-
cient services to their customers and be willing to explain
any ambiguities and provide clarity to their clients when
needed. The service provider's chosen should be ones that
are accountable and live up to their claims and promises.
Roadmap for the successful adoption of cloud computing.The
proposed roadmap as shown in Figure 2 has seven stages:
planning, choosing the right deployment model, choosing
the most suitable service models, vendor selection, negotiat-
ing the SLA, migration, and integration.
Stage 1: Planning.After the decision to adopt the cloud
technology has been taken, the first step is to have a planning
team in place to plan and oversee the cloud project. The team
should have staff of the university's IT department who will
offer advise based on what is currently in place in the uni-
versity and at least one external cloud expert who will give
professional, expert, and practical advice as that is their area
of expertise. Having the right people in place from the very
beginning is necessary, because it will save a lot of costly
mistakes from happening as the journey to the cloud contin-
ues. At the planning stage, the team should do a background
study, identify the advantages and possible disadvantages of
adopting cloud computing to the university, the university's
readiness to move to the cloud based on available infrastruc-
ture, and any other factors that may be considered important.
Finally, the team should identify a system with best prac-
tices to benchmark against; this is because for any project or
change to succeed, it has to be benchmarked against simi-
lar processes that have succeed; doing this will give a better
reflection of the current processes, policies, and standards
and how the best practices that have been identified can be
achieved.
Stage 2: Choosing the right deployment model.Choosing
the right deployment model is key to having a successful
cloud platform, each of the four models of cloud computing
have their strengths and weaknesses. For instance, the public
cloud model offers full utilization of computing resources;
it is more cost efficient and scalable than the other models
but has greater security concerns whereas the private cloud
though not as cost efficient as the public cloud offers better
security. Therefore, to enjoy the full benefits and promises
of adopting cloud computing, the hybrid model is recom-
mended as the best deployment model because it combines
Okai et al. 7
the strengths of the public and private clouds and handles
their weaknesses more efficiently. The hybrid cloud provides
scalability without boundaries; it is more cost-effective,
gives the needed security, and offers great flexibility by giv-
ing its users the opportunity to explore different operational
avenues.
Stage 3: Choosing the most suitable service models. Just like
the deployment model, it is important to know which of the ser-
vice models is most suitable to meet the needs and achieve the
objectives of migrating to the cloud. For instance, using IaaS
delivers everything: servers, storage, space, and networking
equipments as a service. PaaS provides the platform for appli-
cation developers to build and host their applications whereas
SaaS provides complete applications to the end user of the
cloud service; it only requires that the user has a web browser
and is connected to the Internet. The choice of the delivery
model is dependent on need. For a typical university setting,
each of these three models will be useful as they all have their
unique features relevant to the needs of the university.
Stage 4: Vendor selection.As stated in "Strategic Guide-
lines to Overcome Reliability of the Service Provider Con-
cerns" section above, the importance of choosing the right
vendor cannot be overemphasized. This is because the suc-
cess or failure of the cloud project lies strongly with the ven-
dor delivering the service; hence, it is extremely important
to investigate into the selected vendor before outsourcing.
After investigating the reliability of the service provider,
the next line of consideration is the location where the data
will be stored; this is important because of legal compli-
ance that comes with different locations. Different countries
have different laws on the right to information in the land,
information security, privacy, data protection, and different
levels of restrictions; therefore, it is important to understand
the local data protection requirement of the country or loca-
tion where the data will be housed before commitments are
made.
Stage 5: Negotiating the SLA.The SLA is a very impor-
tant document; it is a binding contract between the university
and the cloud service provider. The terms of the SLA should
be negotiated and agreed upon by the university and chosen
vendors before the deal is signed. Among other things, the
agreements should include the following:
·
· Planned downtimes by the vendor to check bugs, do
maintenance, and updates should be scheduled at
times when the impact will be least felt. For example,
at midnight of the university's location and preferably
over the weekends; such times should be communi-
cated to the university beforehand.
·
· In the case of service transfer to another vendor, a
seamless transfer without delay, downtime, and data
loss should be assured.
·
· Besides the service costs, all hidden costs within the
documents for extra charges of any kind and terms
and conditions written in tiny fonts should be made
clear and properly understood by the university before
the SLA is signed to avoid any misunderstandings in
the future.
·
· The chosen vendor should assure 99.9% availability
and have an immediate data recovery plan in case of
any disaster.
Stage 6: Migration.At this stage, the chosen deployment
model and processes to be hosted on the service delivery
models are mapped out.

The hybrid cloud. This article proposes the hybrid cloud
as the most suitable deployment model for universities.
Deploying the hybrid cloud will offer cost benefits to the
management of the university; it will also make it easier for
staff to share resources not just within the same university
but also with other universities around the world. Likewise,
lecturers do not have to carry their notes around as it can be
easily accessed through any device because it is available in
the cloud. Also with the hybrid model, the fear of privacy
and other security-related issues are avoided, as very criti-
cal and sensitive data whose confidentiality cannot be com-
promised will be hosted on premise in the university's data
center, which serves as a private cloud. This article further
proposes that the public cloud should combine the services
of different cloud service providers to serve students and
staff of the university more efficiently as well as avoid the
problem of vendor lock-in.
The SaaS layer. The SaaS layer represents the top layer
of the cloud. It offers its services in a software model of
web-based applications and serves a large number of users.
All that is required from the user of the application is a con-
nection to the Internet. With SaaS, the user does not need
to install or run any applications on their devices or worry
about maintenance, upgrades, and support. Applications
such as e-learning systems, admission process, research,
faculty and student corners, admin, digital library, email,
account and financial processes, student life cycle and infor-
mation system, classroom management system, and other
administrative processes can be hosted on the SaaS layer for
easy access and convenience for students, academic as well
administrative staff of the university. This can be on the pub-
lic as well as a private cloud, the most sensitive applications
such as the admission process, account and financial ser-
vices, and any other services considered critical and requires
very high confidentiality should be hosted on a private cloud.
The SaaS services on the public cloud can be provided by
cloud vendors such as Salesforce.com, Google, and Sky-
Drive. Using SaaS will help to overcome the problems of
limited modern teaching and learning resources and lack of
e-learning scalability.
The PaaS layer.The PaaS layer is the middle layer
between the SaaS and IaaS. It is an environment for web
developers to create, store, and host their applications over
the Internet. The services on this layer eliminate the need to
create and manage instances of virtual machines. The PaaS
layer facilitates the development and deployment of appli-
cations without the developers worrying about the cost and
complexity of buying, managing, or configuring the under-
laying layers needed for developing applications because
the development tools are already hosted in the cloud and
provided by the cloud vendor. This layer provides access
to different platforms and programming languages, thereby
making it possible for developers and programming students
to easily do their work by simply connecting to the cloud.
This layer can be hosted on a public cloud using Force.com,
Microsoft Azure, Google App Engine, and so on.
The IaaS layer. The IaaS also referred to everything as a
service layer provides basic computing resources including
servers, storage, hardware, and networking equipments. This
layer delivers computing IaaS in a virtualized environment. It
could also include the operating system, bandwidth, and vir-
tualization technology needed to manage the resources. It all
depends on need and negotiation with the cloud service pro-
vider. IaaS offers everything as a service; it helps to address
the problem of limited learning resources and the e-learning
scalability. One of the key players in the IaaS layer isAmazon
E2C (Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud), it reduces the time
needed to get and bootup new servers to minutes, it allows
quick scaling capacity back and forth as demands change and
provides a computing environment and resources that quickly
and cost-effectively process large amounts of research data.

Stage 7: Integration.A successful integration is the key
to realizing the full potential of the entire cloud investment.
Lack of proper integration of the cloud with existing on-
premise applications has been identified as one of the key
reasons why cloud projects fail in the survey conducted;
therefore, to avoid this from happening, a proper integration
is needed to harmonize processes across the hybrid model.
Integration can be done using any of the three common tra-
ditional approaches like on-demand integration tools that
connect multiple clouds together mainly adopted by small
companies that have low-cost integration options or by
implementing complex on-premise software platforms also
called the traditional middleware solutions, which provide
sophisticated functionalities and are mainly used to meet
the integration needs of large enterprises; the third type of
the traditional approach is by writing custom codes. Besides
these traditional approaches, other approaches to integrating
the cloud with on-premise applications is by using applica-
tions like WebSpace cast iron by IBM, Oracle cloud integra-
tion by Oracle, Boomi Atmosphere by Dell, or any of the
other integration platforms available.
Testing of the Model
Both interview and questionnaire survey were conducted by
this study as means of primary data collection. Table 1 shows
the summary of the responses gotten from the
questionnaire.
Based on the responses above, the model was created and
sent to experts who have adopted and implemented the cloud
technology in one of the renowned universities (Asia Pacific
University of Technology and Innovation [APU], Malaysia)
for testing, so as to evaluate the effectiveness of the model in
Okai et al. 9
meeting the needs of its users. APU has had a successful
implementation of the cloud technology. The university uses
the hybrid cloud model by combining a private cloud on
campus and public clouds of external cloud service providers
to meet the needs of its students and staff. By adopting the
hybrid module, the university can deploy cloud services on
varying scales on the three-service delivery models depend-
ing on need, frequency of access, and level of security
needed. For instance, the university uses the SaaS services
on both private and public clouds with more sensitive appli-
cations left behind the university's firewalls on premises.
Also, the researcher found that the university through its
adoption of the cloud technology achieves savings of 95% in
the number of servers used as 10 servers were effectively
used to do the same job of 200 servers. Overall, the adoption
of cloud computing not only saves APU from spending more
in providing quality cloud services to her students and staff
but also saves on storage space, cooling facilities, and reduc-
tion in the amount of carbon footprint generated as well as a
more robust, secured, and high-performance network.
Conclusion
The advent of cloud computing sparked the interest of many
universities around the world to opt for the cloud as an alter-
native means of delivering quality IT services to students,
staff, and the educational community at reduced cost.
However, the failures experienced by early adopters of the
cloud technology and challenges that come with its adoption
have left many skeptical in committing to it. This article dis-
cussed those challenges peculiar to higher institutions of
learning and proffered solutions that can be followed to
reduce to the barest minimum the issues of cloud computing
adoption so as to ensure a safer and more reliable transition
to the cloud for users at the university level.
