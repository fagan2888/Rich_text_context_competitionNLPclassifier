Abstract
Background: African American youth are more likely than other racial and ethnic groups to be obese. African American youth are
also more likely to live in disadvantaged neighborhoods which increase their victimization, observation, and fear of violence.
Objectives: This study tested if victimization, observation, and fear of violence in the neighborhood during adolescence predict
trajectory of body mass index (BMI) in the 3rd decade of life in African Americans.
Patients and Methods: Data came from an 18-year community-based cohort. We used multi-group latent growth curve modeling
for data analysis, considering neighborhood violence at age 15 (i.e. victimization, observation, and fear) as predictors, and the linear
slope for the average change in BMI from age 21 to 32 as the outcome, with age and socioeconomic status (i.e. intact family and
parental employment) as covariates.
Results: Fear of neighborhood violence at age 15 was predictive of an increase in BMI from age 21 to 32 among female but not male
African Americans. Victimization and observation of violence at age 15 did not predict BMI change from age 21 to 32 among female
or male African Americans.
Conclusions: Fear of neighborhood violence is a contributing factor to increased risk of obesity for female African American youth
who live in disadvantaged areas. This finding has implications for prevention of obesity among African American women who are
at highest risk for obesity in the United States. Initiatives that enhance neighborhood safety are critical strategies for obesity pre-
vention among African American women.

1. Background
For young people who strive to achieve financial, res-
idential, emotional, and social independence, transition
to adulthood is one of the most stressful developmen-
tal periods, marked by multiple transitions (1, 2). In ad-
dition to the normative developmental stressors that ev-
ery individual experiences, African Americans are also ex-
posed to several stressors related to social disorder and un-
safe neighborhoods that cumulatively deteriorate health
and well-being (3). As African Americans tend to live in
economically disadvantaged areas, neighborhood-related
stress is a main source of daily hassles for them (4, 5).
Although exposure to stress in multiple life domains, in-
cluding those related to the social environment, increases
risk for poor physical and mental health outcomes among
African American emerging adults (3), the effects of neigh-
borhood stress on health may be gender specific (4, 5).
African American youth who live in low-income neigh-
borhoods are more likely to witness shootings, stabbings,
and killings in their neighborhoods compared to White or
middle class peers (6, 7). This is especially true for African
American male youth (6, 7). For African Americans who
are in transition to adulthood in the inner cities, perceived
unsafe environment, neighborhood fear, and exposure to
violence are significant daily challenges associated with a
wide range of undesired health outcomes (4, 5, 8-15).
A growing body of evidence suggests that exposure
to violence may increase risk of obesity and metabolic
syndrome (16, 17). This is consistent with the literature

on the relationship between exposure to chronic stress
and risk of obesity among adolescents and young adults
(18). The mechanisms underlying such a link may include
lifestyle changes such as decreased physical activity, in-
creased food intake, depression, as well as altered activ-
ity of the hypothalamic­pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis (18).
Gender is also shown as an important factor in the stress-
obesity link (18).
Even in the absence of direct exposure to violence
(violence victimization), living in unsafe neighborhoods
engenders fear and anxiety (19-21). Among residents of
economically and socially deprived neighborhoods, per-
ceived neighborhood fear predicts high depressive symp-
toms (22), low outdoor physical activity, and poor physi-
cal health (23, 24), both among adolescents (19) and adults
(21). High propensity for crime, disorder, and violence in
low-income communities is a direct consequence of struc-
tural racism, as well as social inequities, lack of availability
of jobs, and blocked opportunities (21, 25).
High rate of violence in the communities affects phys-
ical and mental health of African American youth during
their transition to adulthood (26, 27). African Americans
who cannot afford moving to suburban areas and must
continue living in low income urban neighborhoods are
at an increased risk of exposure to crime and unsafe con-
ditions associated with the constrained economic oppor-
tunities and limited social resources in such context (28).
Despite a desire to craft occupational, educational, and re-
lational aspirations for their lives, living in high crime and
unsafe neighborhoods increases African American youths'
day-to-dayexposuretoviolenceorperceptionof fearwhich
adds to their already high levels of financial stress (27, 29,
30). In such unsafe neighborhoods, survival maintenance
becomes a priority for many African American youth (4, 31,
32).
Using a life course epidemiological approach (33, 34)
and built on the socio-ecological model of development
(35), this longitudinal study followed African American
youth who were living in economically disadvantaged and
unsafe urban areas for 18 years to test if victimization, ob-
servation, and fear of neighborhood violence at age 15 pre-
dict the development of obesity during their 3rd decade of
life, and if male and female African American youth differ
in such a prediction.
2. Objectives
This study tested if victimization, observation, and fear
of violence in the neighborhood during adolescence pre-
dict trajectory of body mass index (BMI) in the 3rd decade
of life in African Americans.
3. Patients and Methods
This study used data of the Flint adolescent study (FAS),
1994 to 2012. The FAS is an 18-year longitudinal study of
youth who were transitioning from adolescence to early
adulthood (36, 37). The study protocol was approved by the
local Institutional Review Board and all participants pro-
vided consent or assent before each interview.
Participants were sampled from four local public high
schools. The study sampled ninth graders who had a grade
point average (GPA) of 3.0 or lower (in eighth-grade). Di-
agnoses of developmental disability or emotional impair-
ment were exclusion criteria.
For the current analysis we used demographic and
socio-economic data collected at age 15 (Wave 1), neighbor-
hood violence at age 15 (victimization, observation, and
fear), and BMI at ages 23 to 32 (Waves 5, 8, 9, 11, 12). A total
number of 681 African American youths (335 males and 346
females) participated in the current study. The retention
rate was 90% from Waves 1 to 4; 75% from Waves 4 to 8.
3.1. Procedure
Data were collected using face-to-face structured inter-
views conducted either at school or at alternative commu-
nity locations. Each interview lasted about 60 minutes on
average. This study followed participants regardless of stu-
dents' dropping out of school.
3.2. Measures
3.2.1. Covariates
Demographic data (age and gender) and two mea-
sures of family socio-economic status (parental employ-
ment and family structure) were measured at baseline
(year 1994). Parental employment status was operational-
ized as a dichotomous variable (both parents employed
versus any other conditions). Family structure was also
measured as intact (youth living with both biological par-
ents versus any other condition) or others.
3.2.2. Fear of Neighborhood Violence
The following two items were used to measure individ-
ual perception of fear from violence in the neighborhood:
1, I am afraid of the violence in my neighborhood; and 2,
I worry that someone in my neighborhood will physically
hurt me. Both items used a 4-point Likert scale, ranging
from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). We used a
mean score with higher score indicative of more fear if vi-
olence in the neighborhood (r = 0.44, P < 0.05), (Appendix
1).

3.2.3. Observation of Violence
Participants were asked for the last 12 months, how of-
tentheyhad1,seensomeonecommitaviolentcrimewhere
a person was hurt; and 2, seen someone get shot, stabbed,
or beaten up. Both items used a 5-point Likert scale, rang-
ing from 1 (o times) to 5 (4+ times). The two items were pos-
itively correlated. We used a mean score, where a higher
scorewasindicativeof morefrequentviolenceobservation
(r = 0.52, P < 0.001), (Appendix 1).
3.2.4. Victimization of Violence
The following three items were used to measure indi-
vidual exposure to violence: During the last 12 months,
how often have you 1, had someone threaten to hurt you;
2, had someone physically assault or hurt you; and 3, had
someone take something from you using physical force.
All three items used a 5-point Likert scale, ranging from
1 (o times) to 5 (4+ times). We used a mean score, where
higher score was indicative of higher victimization of vio-
lence, (Appendix 1).
3.2.5. Body Mass Index (BMI)
The BMI was calculated based on self-reported weights
and heights, which were originally collected in pounds (1
pound = 0.453 kilograms) and feet (1 foot = 0.3048 me-
ters)/inches (1 inch = 0.0254 meters), respectively. The
BMI calculated based on self-reported weight and height
is closely correlated with BMI based on direct measures of
height and weight (38).
3.3. Data Analysis
The current study only included African Americans, as
only 17% of the original sample was composed of Whites.
Univariate and bivariate analysis were done in SPSS 20.0.
Bivariate associations were tested using Pearson's correla-
tion test. AMOS 20.0 was used for multivariable analysis
(39, 40).
Multi-group latent growth curve modeling (LGCM) -a
type of structural equation modeling (SEM) (41) - was used
for multivariable data analysis, where groups were defined
based on gender. In the first step, we ran unconditional
models, which suggested no covariate and no constraints
on any paths across the groups. In the next step, we added
our predictors of interest and covariates. We implemented
full information maximum likelihood (FIML) to account
for missing data.
Fit statistics included p more than 0.05, Chi square, the
comparativefitindex(CFI)[> 0.90], therootmeansquared
error of approximation (RMSEA) [< 0.06], and X2 to de-
grees of freedom ratio (42-44). Standardized regression co-
efficients and standard errors (SE) were reported.
4. Results
4.1. Univariate Analysis
Table 1 provides descriptive statistics for demograph-
ics, violence (fear of neighborhood violence, violence ob-
servation, and violence victimization), and BMI in the
pooled sample, and based on gender. From Wave 5 to 12,
BMI increased gradually among both male and female par-
ticipants (P < 0.001 for trend). Females had higher BMI
than males at all waves with the last wave being an excep-
tion (P < 0.001 for all significant associations). While fear
of neighborhood violence, violence observation, and vio-
lence victimization at Wave 1 were high for both genders,
fear of violence in neighborhood was marginally higher
for females, and violence observation was significantly
higher for males. Violence victimization at wave 1 did not
differ between male and females (Table 1).
4.2. BivariateAnalysisofViolenceandControlVariablesbyGen-
der
AsTable2suggests, livinginanintactfamilyatbaseline
was marginally associated with less violence observation
and correlated with violence victimization for boys. Intact
family at baseline was not associated with any of the vio-
lence measures for girls. Number of parents working was
negatively associated with violence victimization for boys.
Such association could not be found among girls. For boys,
violence victimization was negatively associated with the
amount of BMI increase from Wave 5 to Wave 12. For girls,
violence victimization was positively but marginally asso-
ciated with BMI increase from Wave 5 to Wave 12.
4.3. Multivariable Model
The fit of our multi-group LGCM was very good [2 =
233.991, df = 91, P < 0.001, 2/df = 2.571, CFI = 0.936, RMSEA
= 0.048, (90% CI = 0.041, 0.056)], (Figures 1 and 2).
As depicted in Table 3, baseline violence observation
had a marginal negative association with baseline BMI
among females ( = -0.12, P = 0.055) and parent employ-
ment was negatively associated with baseline BMI for fe-
males ( = -0.20, P = 0.003). Among females, baseline fear
of neighborhood violence was associated with the linear
slope of the BMI ( = 0.18, P = 0.026), suggesting that the
BMI increase in the 3rd decade of life is larger for females
who had high levels of fear of neighborhood violence at
baseline. This path was not significant for males ( = -0.01,
P = 0.941), (Table 3).

5. Discussion
Fear of violence in the neighborhood at age 15 is pre-
dictive of an increase in BMI from age 21 to 32 among fe-
male but not male African American youth. Thus for fe-
maleAfricanAmericanyouthwholiveindisadvantaged ar-
eas, fear of violence in the neighborhood is one of the con-
tributing factors of their increased risk of obesity.
This study makes a unique contribution to the litera-
ture by suggesting a mechanism for higher rates of obe-
sity among African American females who live in unsafe
neighborhoods. African Americans are more likely than
any other ethnic groups to develop the negative outcomes
associated with living in high-risk neighborhoods (45-47).
Our study offers insights about potential social and cogni-
tive processes that contribute to the trajectories of obesity
among African American females during the transition to
adulthood.
The current study builds on past research by noting
that for African American females, it not the exposure to
violence per se, but the perceived fear of violence in the
neighborhood which has subsequent and lasting effects
on obesity 18 years later. Perceived fear of violence may
be one of the ingredients by which poor environments
change human behavior (24, 31). Perhaps this fear con-
tributes to a lack of engagement in outdoor physical activi-
tiesduring thetransition toadulthood thatcontinuesover
a lifetime, which has implications for future obesity. Our
findings are also consistent with other studies indicating
that exposure to physical violence is associated with obe-
sity (16, 17). Given the fact that fear is a type of stress (48),

our finding is in line with the literature on the effect of
psychologicalstressonobesity(18), withsomeinteractions
with gender and economic status (18).
Supporting our findings, it has been previously shown
that psychosocial stress plays an important role in devel-
opment of excess body fat and obesity (49-51). Although
the exact mechanism of the effect of stress on obesity is
still unknown (51), as suggested by McEwen and Seeman
(51) long-term stress has the potential to induce long last-
ing changes to the stress reaction through physiological
pathways that have well-established roles in obesity and
metabolic syndrome (52-54). A number of studies have
shown that chronic psychosocial stress is a risk factor for
obesity, and causes excess body fat accumulation, espe-
cially in the abdomen (49-51, 55).
Based on social disorganization theory originally de-
veloped by Shaw and McKay in 1942 (56), specific social
processes mediate the effect of living in unsafe neighbor-
hoods on health, behaviors, and well-being of individuals
and populations. In this view, a neighborhood is a com-
plex system that shapes exposures and resources, includ-
ing peers and families (26). Our findings confirms and ex-
tends this theory by suggesting that perceived neighbor-
hood fear may be one of the mechanisms that may explain
how the social environment may adversely affect individ-
ual physiological changes.
Although previous researchers have investigated psy-
chosocial risk factors of obesity, few have tested the role of
exposure to violence for African American youth. African
American adolescents who reside in disadvantaged neigh-
borhoods are often exposed to high levels of physical vio-
lence as victims, witnesses and, to a lesser extent, as perpe-
trators. Among urban youth, 50% - 100% report witnessing
violence in their community (9, 45, 57), with African Amer-
ican boys at higher risk for witnessing violence (4, 45).
Youth from lower SES families are also more likely to reside
in poorer, urban neighborhoods characterized by higher
crime levels among other disadvantages (26, 47). A recent
qualitative study by Smith on 40 Black men (aged 18 - 24
years) applied life history calendar tools to provide a com-
prehensive history of loss and also identified the develop-
mental timing of deaths. On average, participants knew 3
homicide victims who were overwhelmingly peers. Partic-
ipants had started experiencing homicide death in early
childhood, which peaked in adolescence and persisted
into emerging adulthood. The researchers concluded that
young black men frequently experienced traumatic loss of
peers to homicide (32). Although our findings support this

literature, we found that fear of violence operates differ-
ently by gender and has more noxious effects for females
than males when linked to obesity in young adulthood.
Our findings are important considering the fact that
youth, particularly African American youth, witness or be-
come victims of physical assaults, use of weapons, sex-
ual victimization and harassment, property victimization,
maltreatment, and other violent acts (58, 59). According to
the national survey of children's exposure to violence, in a
one year period, 61% of the adolescents are victims or wit-
nesses to physical violence and 7% are threated or injured
with weapons (60). Compared to other racial and ethnic
groups, riskof experiencingmultipleformsof violencehas
been shown to be twice as high among African American
youth compared to other race/ethnic groups. High level of
exposure of African American youth to violence is mostly
duetoresidenceindisadvantagedareaswithundesired so-
cial and economic conditions in the neighborhood (61). It
has been shown that among African Americans, living in
high-risk neighborhoods is a strong predictor of exposure
to violence (62). Gender is known to influence pattern of
exposure to violence, as boys are more likely to experience
assaults while girls are more likely to be exposed to sexual
violence (60).
Our finding that high levels of fear of neighborhood
violence at age 15 was associated with a larger increase in
BMI in early adulthood among African American females
advocates for prevention of violence and related fear in
economically disadvantaged areas where African Ameri-
can females may develop obesity due to fear of violence.
Thisisparticularlyimportantduetohighestrateof obesity
among African American women in United States (63).
Policies should reduce violence against all youth in
homes, schools, and neighborhoods (59). This is particu-
larly needed for adolescents who reside in disadvantaged
neighborhoods and may be exposed to high levels of phys-
ical violence as victims, witnesses and, may experience fear
of violence. Among urban youth, 50% - 100% witness vi-
olence in the neighborhoods (45), with African American
youth at highest risk for witnessing violence (4, 45). This
risk is highest for African American youth from lower so-
cioeconomic families who reside in poor urban neighbor-
hoods characterized by high crime rates among other so-
cial disadvantages (26, 47).
Similar to the results of the current study, gender dif-
ferences on the health effects of fear of neighborhood and
neighborhood safety have been previously shown. In a re-
cent study by Assari et al. in 2015 (4), an increase in fear
of neighborhood violence was associated with an increase
in depressive symptoms for African American male but
not for female young adults who were living in poor ur-
ban areas. Based on that study, even incremental increase
in fear of neighborhood violence among African Ameri-
can among 21 - 22 year old males was predictive of an in-
crease increase in depressive symptoms two years later (4).
In another study on a racially diverse sample, Assari et al.
found that perceived neighborhood safety at age 15 pre-
dicted subjective health at age 33; however, as with fear in
this study, the effect was found only among females (5).
Our findings suggest that interventions, programs,
and policies that increase sense of safety in the commu-
nities should be considered as a strategy to prevent obe-
sity during emerging adult African American females. Fu-
ture research that tests if programs and policies that lower
neighborhood crime and violence rate also reduce the bur-
den of obesity among African American females would
be useful. Programs that increase availability of psycho-
educational resources in the communities where African-
Americans live may also help African American females
better cope with fear of violence in their high risk neigh-
borhoods. Most importantly, more initiatives are needed
toincreasesafetyinurbanneighborhoods. Policiesthatad-
dress this issue at the structural level (e.g. more policing,
betterstreetlights, noabandonhousing, etc.) willenhance
sense of safety at the community.
Our study has a few limitations that are necessary to
acknowledge. Our sampling strategy was not random, so
the results may not be generalizable to all African Ameri-
cans in the U.S. We used few items to measure fear, obser-
vation, and victimization of violence. Future studies that
apply more comprehensive measures of violence, fear, and
exposure are needed. Our study relied on self-report vari-
ables and was limited to individual level characteristics.
Examining how neighborhood level violence is associated
withsubsequentriskof obesitywouldbeausefuldirection
for future research (64). Finally, our study did not measure
medical and behavioral risk factors of obesity including di-
abetes, exercise, diet, as well as HPA function. Despite these
limitations, our longitudinal design and long term follow
up both represent significant contributions to the litera-
ture.
To conclude, perceived fear of neighborhood violence
during adolescence predicts change in BMI in the 3rd
decade of life among African American females. Our find-
ings provide further evidence of the connection between
stressors associated with violence and obesity, and in this
instance a connection between prevention in criminal jus-
tice and public health systems. Programs and policies that
prevent violence and enhance perceived safety may be use-
ful strategies for obesity prevention among female African
American young adults.
