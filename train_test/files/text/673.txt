Do Consumers Know How
Their Health Plan Works?
Consumers tend to overestimate plan restrictions, especially regarding
access to medical specialists.
by Peter J. Cunningham, Charles Denk, and
Michael Sinclair
Allowing consumers greater choice
of health plans is seen by many as the
key to both higher quality and lower
costs. A basic assumption behind this view is
that consumers can and do make informed
choices about the types of health plans they
enroll in. In the past, informed choice required
knowledge of the specific services covered by
the plan as well as copayments and deduct-
ibles. Today, however, consumers must also
understand health plans as care delivery sys-
tems, including rules for selecting providers
from a specific network or going outside of
the network, the role of primary care provid-
ers, and procedures for obtaining referrals for
specialty care.
Previous research has shown that many
consumers lack a basic understanding of key
managed care concepts and features, although
it is not clear whether this lack of knowledge
also extends to their own health plan.1 Failure
to understand the delivery-system aspects of
their own plan could result in confusion and
frustration, which may ultimately affect satis-
faction and quality of care.
In this paper we use unique data from the
1996­97 Community Tracking Study (CTS)
to compare consumers' responses to ques-
tions about their health plan attributes with
information obtained from the actual plans in
which they are enrolled. We examine how ac-
curately consumers report on basic plan fea-
tures related to choice of providers and access
to specialists, including (1) whether they
must choose from a list or network of provid-
ers; (2) whether the plan covers any of the
costs for going outside of the network; (3)
whether they are required to sign up with a
primary care provider; and (4) whether they
are required to get a referral or plan approval
for specialty care.

Expanding consumer choice of plans
is beneficial only to the extent that consumers
make informed choices. Using data from the
1996­97 Community Tracking Study (CTS), this
study compares consumers' responses on four
key attributes of their health plan with informa-
tion provided directly by the plan. Plan attributes
relate to choice of providers and access to spe-
cialists. Although the accuracy of reporting some
individual attributes was fairly high, fewer than
one-third of consumers accurately reported all
four health plan attributes. In general, consum-
ers tended to overreport plan restrictions, espe-
cially the need for approval to see specialists.

The CTS household survey was designed to
produce nationally representative estimates
for the U.S. population as well as for each of
the sixty communities in the CTS.2
The survey involved a sample of house-
holds using both random-digit dialing as well
as a small field sample to represent house-
holds without telephones. Families were de-
fined to include all persons eligible for cover-
age under a typical private health insurance
policy. Separate interviews were conducted
for each family in the household.
For each family interview, an individual
considered to be knowledgeable about the
health, health insurance coverage, and health
care use of family members was selected as
the "family respondent" (usually a parent for
families with children). In addition, respon-
dents were asked about the specific attributes
of the private insurance plans they and other
family members were enrolled in, namely, the
plan's requirements for selecting providers
from a network, rules for going outside of the
network, and "gatekeeping" requirements
(Exhibit 1).3
Respondents also were asked to identify
the health plans that family members were
enrolled in, which were then contacted by
telephone in a "follow-back" survey. Plans
were asked to report on the same attributes
that were asked of household respondents, as
well as other plan features not asked about in
the household survey. Respondents to the
follow-back survey generally included mar-
keting directors or other persons knowledge-
able about plans' characteristics.4
n Methods. The unit of analysis in this
study is the family health plan. For each plan
reported on by the family respondent (up to
three per family), responses to the questions
on plan attributes were linked to plans' re-
sponses to these same questions in the follow-
back survey. By linking responses in this man-
ner, we estimate the percentage of health
plans for which there was agreement between
the family and health plan respondents. Plans
that had missing values on the attributes for
either the family or plan respondent were ex-
cluded (less than 3 percent of plans for each
attribute). Thus, lack of agreement between
family and health plan reports reflects inaccu-
rate reporting on the part of the family re-
spondent, not failure to answer the question.
The sample for this analysis is about 11,600
health plans that included both family and

plan respondent information.5 These plans
were reported on by a total of 10,884 family
respondents. About 7 percent of family re-
spondents (751) reported on more than one
health plan (mostly two).6 The sample in-
cludes only private health insurance plans.
Public coverage--including Medicare,
Medicaid, and Medigap plans--was not in-
cluded. Almost all respondents were between
the ages of eighteen and sixty-four. Only
about 100 family respondents--about 1 per-
cent of the total--were age sixty-five or older.
Attributes were divided into network-
relatedattributes andgatekeeperattributes (see
Exhibit 1). The former include whether plan en-
rolleeswererequiredto selectfrom anetworkor
list of providers, and whether the plan covered
any of the costs for going outside the network.
The latter include whether enrollees were re-
quired to select a primary care provider, as well
as whether members needed a referral or ap-
proval from the plan to see a specialist.
Results
n Frequency of plan attributes. Estimates
of the percentage of plans that have restric-
tions on provider choice and access differ de-
pending on whether the information was re-
ported by the family respondent or the plan
respondent. Estimates of the percentage of
plans that have a network of providers are
lower based on family reports than they are
based on plan reports (Exhibit 2), although
estimates of the percentage of plans that have
no out-of-network coverage are roughly simi-
lar. On the other hand, estimates of the per-
centage of plans that require referral for spe-
cialty care based on family respondent reports
are more than twice as high as those based on
health plan reports, which suggests a very high
degree of overreporting by family respondents.
The percentage of plans that require patients
to sign up with a primary care provider was
also higher based on family reports.7
n Agreement between family and plan
respondents. Overall, family respondents
were most accurate in reporting on whether
the plan had a network of providers and least
accurate about whether referrals were re-
quired to see specialists (Exhibit 3). In gen-
eral, agreement rates tended to be much
higher when plans had restrictions on
provider choice and access than when they
did not have them. This is most apparent in
the case of referral requirements for specialty
care, where family and health plan respon-

dents were in agreement 86 percent of the
time when the plan actually required referrals
for all specialty care. However, the agreement
rate was only 47 percent when the plandid not
require specialty referral, which indicates that
overreporting the need for specialty referral is
a much bigger problem than underreporting.
The high degree of overreporting the need
for specialty care approval may be due in part
to differences in the questions asked of family
and health plan respondents. Because family
respondents were not asked whether the plan
pays for any of the costs for self-referrals to
specialists (as health plan respondents were
asked), they may have answered the question
in terms of what the plan required for full
coverage (see Exhibit 1). This is most likely to
occur for those enrolled in open-access plans,
such as point-of-service (POS) plans, in
which self-referrals for specialty care are usu-
ally allowed at reduced coverage. About one-
fourth of the plans in which the need for spe-
cialty referral was overreported were POS or
open-access health maintenance organization
(HMO) plans. Thus, even if we assume that
most of the misreporting for this subset of
plans was due to differences in the questions
rather than lack of knowledge, overall agree-
ment rates for this attribute would still be
lower than for the other attributes.8
Agreement was also higher when the plan
had a network and when a primary care
provider was required. The one exception was
that family respondents tended to be more
accurate about reporting that the plan had
coverage for out-of-network services (75 per-
cent) than when there was no coverage for
these services (61 percent).

respondents were asked to identify whether
their plan was an HMO, which could then be
verified with the information provided by the
health plan respondent. The results show that
about three-fourths of family respondents ac-
curately reported whether their plan was an
HMO, which is a higher rate of agreement
than for three of the four attributes (the net-
work attribute being the exception). Unlike
the plan attributes, overreporting HMO plan
type did not appear to be more of a problem
than underreporting it.
It is unknown whether consumers are any
more accurate in reporting other plan types,
such as fee-for-service (FFS) plans, preferred
provider organizations (PPOs), or POS plans.
However, it is likely that consumers' recogni-
tion of these terms is lower than for HMOs,
especially considering the extensive media at-
tention HMOs have received.9
n Overall accuracy of reporting. Al-
though the accuracy of reporting on some in-
dividual attributes was fairly high, fewer than
one-third of respondents (30.3 percent) cor-
rectly reported all four attributes.10 In addi-
tion, just over half of respondents (56 per-
cent) accurately reported both network
attributes, while just under half (48.8 per-
cent) accurately reported both gatekeeper at-
tributes. However, among the most restrictive
plans, agreement between the family respon-
dent and plan respondent on all four restric-
tions was somewhat higher (50 percent).
n Factors affecting family respon-
dents' accuracy. There were no differences
in the accuracy of reporting all four attributes
by amount of experience with HMOs, but
there were some differences depending on
level of plan choice, health status, and level of
education. However, the accuracy of report-
ing all four attributes did not exceed 36 per-
cent for any characteristic we examined.11
Experience with HMOs. One might expect
that greater experience with managed care
plans--especially HMOs--would lead to
more accurate reporting of these attributes.
Although agreement rates on all four attrib-
utes are slightly higher for respondents with
more than one year's experience with HMOs,
these small differences were not statistically
significant (Exhibit 4). Differences in agree-
ment rates for network and gatekeeping attrib-
utes by level of experience with HMOs were
also small and not statistically significant.
Choice of healthplans. Respondents who have
a choice of employer plans may be more accu-
rate in reporting plan attributes, either be-
cause employers provide more information
about plans or because employees make more
of an effort to understand plan differences
when they have a choice. We found that the
accuracy of reporting all four attributes was
highest among respondents who had a choice
of HMO and non-HMO plans (36 percent)
and lowest among those offered only a single
HMO plan (25 percent). These differences ap-
pear to be attributable mostly to the accuracy
of reporting gatekeeping attributes.
One exception to the general trend is that
respondents offered only a single non-HMO
plan had the second-highest overall rate of
agreement (30.4 percent) and had agreement
rates on network attributes that were similar
to those offered a choice of HMO and non-
HMO plans (about 53 percent). It is possible
that having a single plan offering with few
restrictions is often easier to comprehend
than when plans or plan offerings are more
complicated, or it may be due to other respon-
dent characteristics that are also associated
with relatively higher agreement.
Health status. One might also expect greater
accuracy in reporting among respondents
with significant health needs, both because
plan restrictions may be ofgreater importance
to them and because they are likely to have
more direct experiences in knowing how
their plan works. Surprisingly, respondents
who reported their health as poor were
slightly less likely to accurately report all four
attributes than were persons who reported
their health as excellent, good, or fair, al-
though these small differences were not sta-
tistically significant. The less accurate report-
ing may reflect having fewer choices or other
characteristics associated with lower accuracy
in reporting (such as socioeconomic status).
Education. As one might expect, respon-

dents with at least a high school education
had greater accuracy in reporting all four at-
tributes than did respondents with less than a
high school education. These differences ap-
pear to be a combination of accuracy of re-
porting both network and gatekeeper attrib-
utes. However, only about one-third of
respondents with a college degree accurately
reported all four attributes, which is only
slightly higher than for respondents who had
only completed high school.
Discussion
Enabling consumers to have a greater role in
choosing their health plan is an explicit or
implicit goal of many policy proposals, in-
cluding those that would provide tax subsi-
dies to purchase insurance in the nongroup
market, create or expand purchasing coopera-
tives, allow individuals to buy in to the Fed-
eral Employees Health Benefits Program
(FEHBP), and mandate employers to offer a
choice of plans. These proposals may differ in
their primary objective, but they all empha-

size the role of the consumer in making plan
choices and will be much more effective if
consumers are able to make informed choices.
Previous research has indicated that con-
sumers do not understand many of the key
concepts of managed care; our study results
indicate that this lack of understanding also
applies to their own health plan. Although the
accuracy in reporting some individual attrib-
utes was relatively high, only about one-third
correctly identified all four attributes related
to the use of networks and gatekeepers.
n Overreporting of restrictions. In addi-
tion, overreporting of plan restrictions on ac-
cess and physician choice appears to be more
of a problem than underreporting is. That is,
consumers enrolled in plans that restrict en-
rollees' access and choice generally appear to
have greater awareness of these restrictions
(with the exception of not being able to go out
of network), while consumers who are not
restricted often believe that they are.
This overreporting may be the result of
consumers' being influenced by media reports
on managed care practices--which they in-
correctly assume also apply to their own
health plan--or negative experiences with
their own health care that they incorrectly at-
tribute to plan restrictions.
n Implications for satisfaction and ac-
cess. A lack of understanding of how one's
health plan works also has implications for
consumer satisfaction and access to care.
Consumers may experience greater barriers to
care if they are unaware of plan restrictions
regarding provider choice and access, or they
may delay getting care because they mistak-
enly believe that their plan requires them to
get authorization or approval to visit a certain
doctor or receive certain services. The CTS
data show that consumers who mistakenly
believed that they needed a referral for spe-
cialty care were somewhat more likely to re-
port delays in getting care than were consum-
ers who accurately reported that plan
approval was not required (25 percent versus
22 percent overall). On the other hand, con-
sumers who were unaware that their plan re-
quired referrals for specialty care were less
likely to report delays in getting care than
were consumers who accurately reported that
plan approval was required (19 percent versus
25 percent). As other findings from the CTS
household and follow-back surveys have
shown, these findings suggest that people's
perceptions of plan restrictions may be more
important in influencing their assessments of
care than the actual plan attributes are.12
n Need for more consumer informa-
tion. The results suggest the need for more
consumer information and education about
how health plans work, particularly the
"managed care" features that are more typical
of health plans today. A considerable body of
evidence indicates that early efforts to edu-
cate consumers have not been very effective
and that simply providing consumers with
more information about plans will not neces-
sarily improve their decisions.13 In particular,
more effective methods for explaining plans as
care delivery systems are needed, as well as
information that allows consumers to evaluate
the trade-offs among access, cost, and quality.
Moreover, the delivery-system aspects of
health plans may become more complex as a
result of recent trends toward more "open-
access" models of care and patients' rights leg-
islation that mandates greateraccess to physi-
cians both inside and outside of a plan's net-
work. In other words, many plans that
previously had no coverage for out-of-
network services or self-referred specialty
care may loosen these restrictions by imple-
menting complex rules for when these restric-
tions do not apply or for when there is full or
partial coverage. These changes are likely to
increase the importance of consumer educa-
tion, since they may greatly increase the com-
plexity of plan rules as well as the need for
consumers to be aware of changes to their
own health plan and the health plan market in
general.

3. The question on specialty referral in the house-
hold survey was originally designed for use in the
Agency for Health Care Policy and Research
(AHCPR) Consumer Assessment of Health
Plans (CAHPS). All other attribute questions
asked in the household survey were originally
designed for use in the 1996 Medical Expendi-
ture and Panel Survey (MEPS) conducted by the
Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ). Some questions were modified prior to
their inclusion in the CTS household survey.
4. Since many health plans offer multiple health
insurance "products" that differ on the key at-
tributes of interest in this study, it was necessary
to identify the specific product in which house-
hold survey respondents were enrolled. Health
plan respondents identified the specific product
based on the name of the plan, the community of
residence for the family respondent, and the
name of the employer offering the plan, all of
which were obtained from family respondents
during the household survey interview. Only
those "products" that were identified with a high
degree of certainty by the health plan respondent
were classified as a "match" and included in this
study. Plan respondents reported on the attrib-
utes for each specific product that was matched.
5. Fifty-three percent of all family-reported plans
linked to plans reported on in the follow-back
survey. While statistical imputation and weight-
ing procedures were used to correct for nonre-
sponse in the follow-back survey to produce na-
tionally representative estimates of the U.S.
population in various types of plans, we use only
the 53 percent of family health plans that actu-
ally linked directly to a plan obtained in the fol-
low-back survey. Therefore, the estimates in this
report were weighted to correct for the cluster-
ing of the CTS sample in sixty communities,
multiple selection of familieswithin households,
and nonresponse on the CTS household survey.
However, the weights do not correct for nonre-
sponse in the follow-back survey, nor do they
correct for the selection of the family respondent
for use in this analysis. Therefore, caution should
be used in making inferences about the total U.S.
population in this analysis.
6. There was virtually no difference in the accuracy
of reporting health plan attributes between fam-
ily respondents who reported on only one plan
and those who reported on several plans.
7. It is noteworthy that there were more plans that
required primary care provider sign-up than
there were plans that required specialty referral
(42.8 percent versus 27.9 percent based on plan
reports). While one might expect these percent-
ages to be roughly the same, the discrepancy is
largely due to point-of-service (POS) plans that
require primary care providers but also allow
self-referrals for specialty care.
8. If we assume that three-fourths of those enrolled
in POS plans who overstated the need for spe-
cialty referral would havecorrectly answered the
question if it had been identical to the question
asked of health plans, then the agreement rate for
this attribute would increase to 54 percent for
plans that did not require a referral, and an over-
all agreement rate of 64 percent. While higher
than the actual agreement rates reported in Ex-
hibit 3, they are still well below agreement rates
for other attributes.

10. Since some of the low level of agreement on all
four attributes may be due to differences be-
tween the household and plan versions of the
specialty referral question, we also calculated
overall agreement rates excluding the specialty
referral attribute. Overall agreement on the other
three attributes combined was 43 percent.
11. Some of the variation in agreement rates by re-
spondent characteristics may be due to correla-
tion with other respondent characteristics or the
type of plan they are enrolled in. Therefore, cau-
tion should be used in making causal inferences
as to the effect of these respondent charac-
teristics on the accuracy of reporting.
