Abstract
MONDA, KERI L. AND BARRY M. POPKIN. Cluster
analysis methods help to clarify the activity­BMI
relationship of Chinese youth. Obes Res. 2005;13:
1042­1051.
Objective: To use cluster analysis to create patterns of
overall activity and inactivity in a diverse sample of Chinese
youth and to evaluate their use in predicting overweight
status.
Research Methods and Procedures: The study populations
were drawn from the 1997 and 2000 years of the longitu-
dinal China Health and Nutrition Survey, comprised of
2702 and 2641 schoolchildren in the 1997 and 2000 cross-
sectional samples, respectively, and 1175 children in the
longitudinal cohort. Cluster analysis was used to group
children into nonoverlapping activity/inactivity "clusters"
that were subsequently used in models of prevalent and
incident overweight. Results were compared with tradi-
tional models, with activity and inactivity coded separately,
to assess whether further insight was gained with the cluster
analysis methodology.
Results: Moderately and highly active youth were shown to
have significantly decreased odds of overweight in both
cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses using cluster anal-
ysis. In incident longitudinal models, youth in the high
activity/high inactivity cluster had the lowest odds of over-
weight [odds ratio  0.12 (0.03, 0.44)]; in contrast, results
from traditional models failed to show any significant rela-
tionship between overweight and activity or inactivity.
Discussion: Cluster analysis methods allow researchers to
simultaneously capture activity and inactivity in new ways.
In this comparative study, only with the clustering method-
ology did we find a significant effect of activity on incident
overweight, furthering our ability to examine this complex
relationship. Interestingly, no effect of increasing levels of
inactivity was observed using either method, indicating that
activity seems to be the more important determinant of
overweight in this population.

Introduction
Research on physical activity, including studies evaluat-
ing physical activity patterns and obesity, typically sepa-
rates measures of activity during work and leisure time and
measures of inactivity such as television viewing and video
game playing. Clearly for many individuals, physical activ-
ity and sedentary behavior covary in meaningful ways and
are not randomly distributed; that is, they are correlated
within the same individual. In studying these factors sepa-
rately, we may miss major overall dimensions of activity
and inactivity that affect obesity. While consideration of
multidimensionality or patterning of health behaviors has
been used regularly in other disciplines, the physical activ-
ity field has not yet embraced methodologies to deal with
this issue. This paper presents one method for examining
these co-occurring behaviors in a joint manner rather than as
independent factors and examines how this approach differs
from the more traditional method of studying the activity-
inactivity-obesity nexus.
Underlying the concern for this study is the worldwide
obesity pandemic. Obesity is particularly common among
adults but is increasingly found among children and ado-
lescents (1­8). Reduction in physical activity is ascribed as
one of the major causes for the increased energy imbalance
among children (9,10), yet because of the paucity of longi-
tudinal data on youth physical activity patterns in develop-
ing countries, this hypothesis remains relatively unstudied
in these locations. Furthermore, with the exception of a few
studies examining television viewing and obesity, results of
studies evaluating activity and/or inactivity and their rela-
tionship to youth obesity are inconsistent and are far from

clearly defined. Cross-sectional and longitudinal studies
have shown that obese children spend less time in moderate
and vigorous physical activity and that children who engage
in the least vigorous physical activity or the most television
viewing tend to be the most overweight (11­18). While it
may seem intuitively obvious to combine the roles of ac-
tivity and inactivity or to examine them together, the focus
instead has been on examining each dimension separately,
usually in separate studies. Thus, an important methodolog-
ical consideration is to evaluate the use of methods that
combine activity and inactivity in new ways.
This study uses longitudinal data on Chinese youth to
examine alternate ways of representing physical activity and
inactivity patterns as exposures for child obesity. Cluster
analysis can be used to place children in mutually exclusive
groups delineated by both their activity and inactivity be-
haviors. This technique has been used frequently in health
behavior­health outcome research, particularly in studies of
dietary patterns and relevant health outcomes (19­22);
however, thus far in our knowledge, non-hierarchical clus-
tering methodologies have not been similarly used to create
patterns of activity and inactivity. Data reduction method-
ologies such as factor analysis have been used in past
studies using activity and inactivity data to try to limit the
number of explanatory variables and, thus, provide a more
reliable measure of overall activity (23), but this method
does not give each child a unique pattern and is more
difficult to interpret and use as a basis for developing
overall patterning measures. For further information spe-
cific to pattern analysis methodology, see studies by Hu (24)
and Togo et al. (25). For this paper, we used select measures
of activity and inactivity to form patterns, or clusters, po-
tentially addressing an important methodological consider-
ation and evaluated their ability to predict overweight sta-
tus.
Research Methods and Procedures
Study Population
The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS)1 is a
longitudinal monitoring survey with data collections in
1989, 1991, 1993, 1997, and 2000 (26­29). The study
population represents a diverse mixture with respect to
socioeconomic factors such as income, employment, and
education, as well as other health, nutritional, and demo-
graphic factors. Additional details are available on the In-
ternet (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china). This paper
focuses on data collected in the survey years of 1997 and
2000. Detailed physical activity data on children and ado-
lescents were first collected in 1997, with the first follow-up
data collected in 2000.
The analysis sample of children and adolescents con-
sisted of subjects between 6 and 18 years of age who were
enrolled in school at the time of data collection. The 1997
and 2000 cross-sectional samples were comprised of 2282
and 2174 subjects, respectively. A total of 1175 individuals
between 6 and 18 years of age who were surveyed in both
years made up the longitudinal cohort. Children not attend-
ing school were excluded before analysis because of differ-
ences in the survey questions asked of those respondents
attending school vs. those not attending school. Further
exclusions were made on the basis of incomplete or incon-
sistent height, weight, demographic, and activity data.
Variable Creation
Respondents attending school were asked to report hours
and minutes per week spent in each of a number of active
and inactive pursuits; active pursuits were queried sepa-
rately for time spent outside of and during school hours,
whereas inactive pursuits were queried only regarding time
before and after school. Descriptive analyses showed that
the majority of school-aged youths did not participate in
physical activity outside of school hours. For those activi-
ties completed while at school, the questionnaire did not
distinguish between organized physical education and in-
formal activities at recess or lunchtime. Activity variables
were categorized as 0, 0 to 30, and 30 min/d; inac-
tivity variables were categorized as 0, 0 to 60, and 60
min/d. For further descriptive details regarding activity and
inactivity measures in the CHNS, see Tudor-Locke et al.
(30).
Four physical activity variables (gymnastics in school,
team sports in school, track or swimming in school, and
active commuting) and two physical inactivity variables
(television/video watching, and reading/writing/drawing/
homework) were used in final cluster formation. We did not
use the remaining activity/inactivity variables because of
the low prevalence in the sample, where the overwhelming
majority of respondents indicated 0 min/wk participation.
Initially, all activity and inactivity variables were included
in cluster formation because we thought there might be an
important subset of children who participated in these spe-
cific less prevalent activities; inclusion, however, did not
illuminate such a pattern and increased the noise of the
resulting clusters to a degree that made them difficult to
interpret. Thus, we limited our usage to variables that had
10% prevalence within the analysis sample. The majority
of the excluded variables were those representing physical
activity and not inactivity. Specifically, because the major-
ity of youths did not engage in physical activity outside of
school hours, these activities were excluded from cluster
formation. Similarly, the variables querying the inactive
pursuits "board games" and "listening to the radio" were
excluded from cluster formation.

Height and weight were measured directly by trained
health workers following a standard protocol. Body weight
was measured in lightweight clothing to the nearest 0.1 kg
and height to the nearest 0.1 cm. BMI was calculated as
weight (kilograms) over height squared (meters squared).
Individual BMI percentile was computed by standardizing
to the Centers for Disease Control 2000 age- and sex-
specific growth charts for individuals (31). For this paper,
overweight was considered to be 85th percentile.
Cluster Analysis Strategy
Cluster analysis methods attempt to find natural group-
ings in data by clustering respondents into groups (clusters)
based on their variable values (24,32). Partition, or non-
hierarchical, cluster analysis methods break the data into a
user-specified number of nonoverlapping groups. Compu-
tationally, the goal is to minimize variability within clusters
and maximize variability between clusters. Cluster variabil-
ity is measured with respect to their means for classifying
variables such that when more than one variable is used, the
distances between clusters are measured in multidimen-
sional space. After generation, cluster membership becomes
a variable with which to perform further analyses--in our
case, the primary exposure variable.
We created physical activity/inactivity clusters using the
1997 data, specifying three-, four-, five-, and six-cluster
solutions. There was little benefit in using the less parsimo-
nious five- or six-cluster solution over the four-cluster so-
lution. Inspection of the resulting clusters revealed that the
inactivity variables were more apt to differentiate between
clusters than activity variables. Thus, to enable further dif-
ferentiation on the activity level, we reran the clustering
methods using only the four activity variables and achieved
substantial differentiation with a three-cluster solution. The
four inactivity clusters were cross-tabbed with the three
activity clusters, and relevant categories based on level
(low, moderate, high) of activity and inactivity were
grouped to form a final seven-cluster solution. The cluster
analysis algorithms provide the researcher with a set of
clusters that are internally consistent but completely driven
by the data and somewhat complex to interpret. From earlier
studies, we learned that a critical final step is to use the
clusters to design groupings--in this case, based on the
variables involved in the cluster analysis--that are readily
interpretable (19,20,22,33). It is important to note that clus-
ter analysis will always produce a classification solution
whether or not it makes any intuitive sense or has any
predictive benefit. Thus, the predictive validity of the clus-
ters was assessed cross-sectionally using overweight status
as a criterion variable that is expected to vary across cluster
but was not used in cluster generation. All clusters were
originally created with the use of PROC FASTCLUS algo-
rithms (version 8.1; SAS Institute, Cary, NC); however, to
track activity patterns longitudinally, we manually recoded
the computer-generated clusters so that respondents could
be assigned to clusters using the same protocol in both
survey years.
Data Analyses
Physical activity/inactivity clusters were entered as indi-
cator variables into the model. We first conducted cross-
sectional analyses among children 6 to 18 years of age for
both 1997 and 2000 to examine the association between
overweight status and activity/inactivity cluster. Second, we
conducted longitudinal analyses to examine whether activ-
ity/inactivity cluster membership in 1997 significantly pre-
dicted overweight status 3 years later. Third, to evaluate
whether further insight was gained using cluster analysis
methods, we ran logistic regression models in which total
minutes per day spent in active and inactive pursuits were
entered as separate variables into the model (called herein
the "traditional" model). Both continuous and categorical
coding schemes were evaluated. To test for interaction of
the activity and inactivity variables, we performed a likeli-
hood ratio test of the interaction terms. For both the cross-
sectional and longitudinal models, we failed to reject the
null hypothesis that the coefficients of the interaction terms
equaled zero, and, thus, we removed the interaction terms
from the models and proceeded with the reduced (main
effects) models as our final models. All cross-sectional
logistic regression models were adjusted for age, sex, and
urban/rural residence; longitudinal models of incident over-
weight were further adjusted for baseline overweight status.
Results
Selectivity Analysis
The cross-sectional analysis sample from 1997 comprised
1440 boys and 1262 girls. Complete height, weight, demo-
graphic, and activity data were available for 1060 (84.0%)
girls and 1222 (84.9%) boys, bringing the final total to 2282
individuals. For 2000, the analysis sample was comprised of
1400 boys and 1241 girls. Complete height, weight, demo-
graphic, and activity data were available for 1158 (82.7%)
boys and 1016 (81.9%) girls, bringing the final total to 2174
individuals. Of the children with complete anthropometric
and demographic data in 1997 and 2000, 412 and 310 were,
respectively, excluded because they were not in school. In
both time periods, children not in school were significantly
older, more rural, of lower income, and, in 1997 only, less
likely to be overweight. In the longitudinal sample, of the
1678 schoolchildren between the ages of 6 and 18 in both
collection periods, 503 were excluded because of missing or
inconsistent height, weight, or demographic data, bringing
the final total to 1175. Individuals in the longitudinal anal-
ysis sample were younger than those in the cross-sectional
sample, but no other significant differences were found.

anthropometric characteristics of the 1997 and 2000 cross-
sectional analysis and excluded samples and those of the
combined longitudinal sample. Age group was defined as
12 years and 12 years, a cut-point that has been used in
earlier analyses on this sample of Chinese youth (30). It is
at this age that Chinese children leave primary school and
enter middle school. Between 1997 and 2000, mean height,
weight, BMI, and percentage overweight increased,
whereas percentage underweight decreased, although none
of these differences was significant.
Cluster Breakdown
After clustering, we needed a simple way to identify and
represent the clusters in our analyses. Because the clusters
did not differentiate on type of activity (e.g., there was not
a "gymnastics" cluster), we chose to differentiate on overall
amount of time spent in active and inactive pursuits (Figure
1; Table 2). Thus, "low" activity refers to the clusters of
children who did not participate in gymnastics, team sports,
or track/swimming but did actively commute to school.
Furthermore, the differentiation between "moderate" and
"high" activity levels was based on a child's participation in
team sports and slightly higher average levels of time spent
in track/swimming. Inactivity was also more easily de-
scribed using amount of time spent rather than type of
inactive pursuit. All children with either moderate or high
levels of inactivity spent time both watching television/
videos and reading/homework; they merely differentiated in
the average amount of time spent. Oddly, we discerned no
"low" inactivity cluster; rather our sample distinguished
those individuals who reported no time spent in inactive
pursuits. We acknowledge that there is likely something
unique about these children, that it is unlikely they spend no
time in inactive pursuits, but that we failed to capture them
with the relevant explanatory variables available to us. In
models using activity/inactivity cluster as the exposure vari-
able, clusters were entered in as indicator variables with the
low activity/no inactivity cluster serving as referent. We
selected this cluster as the referent because not only did it
have the lowest mean level of overall physical activity, but
also its members showed the highest levels of prevalent
overweight. We felt that these characteristics would aid in
the meaningful interpretation of results.

seven clusters these analyses are based on. Cluster break-
down did not change drastically among the three samples;
the moderate physical activity/moderate inactivity cluster

ical activity/high inactivity cluster comprised the least in
all three. Figure 1 is a representation of the mean levels
of each of the six used activity and inactivity variables
per cluster within the longitudinal sample. As seen in
Figure 1, the majority of time captured was in inactive
pursuits, especially reading and homework, and the most
common activity was walking or biking to school. Dis-
tribution of the active and inactive variables did not differ
substantially for the 1997 or 2000 cross-sectional sam-
ples (data not shown).

Logistic Analyses of Overweight Status using Activity/
Inactivity Cluster
Logistic regression models were used to explore the
relationship between activity/inactivity cluster and over-
weight status both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. All
models were controlled for age, sex, and urban or rural
residence; incident models were additionally controlled for
baseline overweight. Table 3 summarizes these findings.
Using the 1997 data in cross-sectional analyses, we found a
significant reduction in the odds of overweight among those
individuals who were either moderately or highly active
compared with those with low levels of activity and no
reported inactivity (low physical activity/no inactivity).
Those with low levels of activity and either moderate or
high levels of inactivity (low physical activity/moderate
inactivity and low physical activity/high inactivity) were not
different from the referent group. Activity level seems to be
driving this relationship because we see no noticeable effect
caused by level of inactivity. Results for the cross-sectional
relationship between activity/inactivity cluster and over-
weight in 2000 were similar to those seen in 1997, although
none were significant (data not shown). Longitudinal mod-
els used to predict prevalent overweight in 2000 from ac-
tivity/inactivity cluster in 1997 among a cohort of school-
children revealed reduced odds of overweight for those
moderately or highly active regardless of level of inactivity.
Additionally, children in the low physical activity/moderate
inactivity cluster were significantly less likely to be over-
weight than those in the low physical activity/high inactivity
cluster, who were not significantly different from the refer-
ent cluster. Note, however, that these two clusters are not
significantly different from each other; thus, we cannot
ascribe the reduced odds of overweight within those who
have low activity to decreased inactivity. Nonetheless, this
difference is meaningful because the low physical activity/
moderate inactivity cluster had, on average, higher mean
levels of active commuting than the low physical activity/no
inactivity cluster (Figure 1), although they are both labeled
as "low" active. The longitudinal results did not change
when predicting incident overweight in 2000 from 1997
activity/inactivity cluster by controlling for baseline over-
weight in the models.
Logistic Analyses of Overweight Status using Traditional
Modeling Techniques
To evaluate whether there was any benefit to clustering
activity and inactivity, we ran traditional logistic regression
models where total times spent in active and inactive pur-
suits were modeled as separate exposure variables within
the same model. We summed the total times spent in the
four physical activity variables and the two inactivity vari-
ables and tested their respective associations with over-
weight using both continuous and categorical coding strat-
egies. Total activity was categorized as 30, 30 to 60, and
60 min/d; total inactivity was categorized as 1, 1 to 3,
and 3 h/d. Categorizations were based on the univariate
distributions of the summary variables. Results are summa-
rized in Table 4. Analyses of the cross-sectional relationship

(1997) among physical activity, inactivity, and overweight
revealed decreased odds of overweight with increasing
amounts of activity, in both categorical and continuous
models, although in categorical models, there was no sig-
nificant difference between the 30 to 60 and 60 min/d
levels. Curiously, increasing amounts of inactivity also
showed an inverse relationship with odds of overweight;
however, these relationships were not significant using ei-
ther categorical or continuous coding. The cross-sectional
results did not particularly deviate from those seen using
cluster analysis methods. In longitudinal models predicting
prevalent overweight, we saw a similar decrease in the odds
of overweight with increasing activity, although this rela-
tionship was significant only at the 60 min/d category.
Additionally, we again saw the curious, although nonsig-
nificant, inverse relationship between increased inactivity
and odds of overweight. Arguably, it is incident overweight
that we are most concerned with in modeling this relation-
ship, and, thus, it is an important methodological finding
that incident longitudinal models, in contrast to similar
models using cluster analysis, failed to show any relation-
ship of activity or inactivity, coded in either manner, and
overweight.
Discussion
Profound social and economic developments in China
over the last 20 years have resulted in shifts in nutrition and
physical activity, predominantly in the urban areas, that
undoubtedly play a role in the emerging obesity problem
(34). Although researchers intuitively understand the energy
in­energy out equation, teasing out the relationship among
activity, inactivity, and overweight is complex because of
its multifactorial nature and many modifying factors, par-
ticularly during the growing years of childhood and adoles-
cence. The rapid economic and acculturation transforma-
tions in China include increases in motorized transport,
which we have shown elsewhere to be associated with
increases in adult overweight and obesity (35); thus, indi-
vidual patterns of activity and inactivity would be expected
to vary and be quite heterogeneous depending on a number
of socioeconomic and other factors. Respondents were que-
ried about home production activities including cleaning,
childcare, gardening, and other chores, and we might expect
their values to differentiate among socioeconomic strata;
however, although these are important sources of physical
activity in other developing countries (36), they do not have
the same relevance in China, with a majority of respondents
reporting that they do not perform these activities.
Activity and inactivity in Chinese youth take on different
forms than in developed countries such as the United States.
Chinese children spend very little time in before- or after-
school sports and other physical activities; the majority of
this time is spent in the rigors of preparing for school

because they are under extreme pressures in this regard (30).
The most frequently reported energy-expending activities
for Chinese schoolchildren are in walking or biking to and
from school and sports and exercise that take place during
school hours. For example, 76.9% of the longitudinal sam-
ple reported participating in physical activity during school,
whereas only 8.8% reported participating in any physical
activity before or after school hours. In terms of sedentary
behaviors, although 90% of households in China own a
television set, time spent watching television and videos is
still more constrained than in the United States, where there
is greater opportunity and allowance for these types of
behaviors. However, American-style satellite programming
has only recently been introduced on a large scale, and we
expect future research by this group and others to find
television viewing rapidly increasing among children and,
furthermore, to have the type of impact on overweight found
in Singapore, Thailand, and Mexico (15,37,38). Further-
more, as television viewing displaces other forms of inac-
tivity (e.g., homework) in the before- and after-school hours
of Chinese youth, subsequent research should additionally
inform the question on the specificity of television viewing
on overweight status.
Using cluster analysis techniques in our longitudinal
analyses, we were able to uncover an effect of activity/
inactivity patterns on childhood prevalent and incident over-
weight over and above that which we found using tradi-
tional multivariate regression. With clustering techniques,
we found that, regardless of level of inactivity, moderate or
high levels of activity resulted in reduced prevalence and
incidence of overweight in our longitudinal cohort. We were
unable to reproduce this relationship using traditional meth-
odologies. Interestingly, we found no measurable increases
in benefit with high levels of activity over moderate levels
of activity within any strata of inactivity. Lack of an effect
at this level could be caused by cluster definition and lack of
variability between the two levels. Furthermore, we were
unable to distinguish any differentiation in overweight prev-
alence or incidence on the basis of inactivity level. Earlier
cross-sectional studies done by this group also found lack of
an effect caused by inactivity in 6- to 11-year-old Chinese
children (39). In the analyses herein, lack of an effect may
be caused, in part, by the lesser variability seen within
inactivity variables; thus, our clusters tell us more about,
and are driven in formation by, activity. It is notable that we
found activity level to be protective against overweight
regardless of level of inactivity. In fact, the lowest odds of
incident overweight were observed in the cluster of youth
with the highest levels of both physical activity and inac-
tivity. In a population that is likely to increase their seden-
tary behaviors as the economic transformation goes for-
ward, continued dominance of school-based physical
activity and active commuting may provide an important
hindrance to increasing levels of overweight and obesity.
Some limitations of this study warrant consideration. We
had a substantial number of children lost to follow-up (n 
344). Those lost to follow-up were more likely to be older,
more urban, and of higher income (data not shown). While
overweight prevalence decreased with increasing age in this
sample, there were also increases in overweight in urban,
higher-income populations. Thus, it is difficult to predict
what effect losing these data points might have had. Addi-
tionally, because the physical activity/inactivity clusters that
were generated are sample-specific, our results are some-
what limited in overall use and specifically limited to
schoolchildren. Another limitation is that the data collection
method left an amount of time unaccounted for, and we
were unable to assess what type(s) of inactivity our cluster
of low physical activity/no inactivity children engaged in.
Fortunately these children clustered together and formed a
relevant group; however, without being able to define the
ways in which they were inactive, we are unable to infer
behavioral traits and draw logical conclusions based on
these characteristics. Finally, all measures of activity and
inactivity were self-reported, and, thus, they are susceptible
to the weaknesses of such data collection techniques. Fur-
thermore, parents assisted younger children (10 years of
age) with the survey and may have provided a proxy report
of their physical activity and inactivity habits. Although the
validity of proxy reports is uncertain, their use is widespread
and bypasses the biases that may be associated with recall in
younger subjects.
There are also many strengths of this study. We were able
for the first time to analyze physical activity and inactivity
data in a longitudinal cohort of diverse children from eight
provinces in China, an understudied population that is un-
dergoing rapid transition that will likely affect their nutri-
tional status. We were able to show that the cluster analysis
methodology is useful in capturing extant behavioral pat-
terns of activity and inactivity, their predictive ability was
established by association with overweight status, and we
were able to find an effect of activity longitudinally where
we could not if restricted to traditional regression method-
ologies. By examining activity patterns as they relate to
overweight status cross-sectionally and longitudinally in an
exposure-subsequent outcome or exposure-incidence man-
ner, this paper advances the science in ways previously
unstudied. Cluster analysis allows us to simultaneously cap-
ture activity and inactivity, dimensions of behavior that are
clearly linked, and we have shown for this sample of Chi-
nese youth that the proposed approach of creating overall
patterns of activity and inactivity offer major advantages
over earlier approaches, where distinct categories of activity
and inactivity are examined separately. Employing these meth-
ods has furthered our ability to examine the relationship be-
tween activity patterns and child overweight status in China
and is a potentially valuable approach for others to explore.
