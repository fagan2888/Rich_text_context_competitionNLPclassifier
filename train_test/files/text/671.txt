Datafrom the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men were used to estimate economic inequality within three 5-
year cohorts as they moved from midlife to later life. The Gini index of inequality increased steadily after age 59,
supporting the hypothesis that within-cohort inequality increases in late life. However, a transition analysis found
considerable mobility in relative statusfor individuals over a 15-yearperiod. These results suggest the need to develop
a longitudinal perspective on later-life economic status which distinguishes between individual-level and population-
level outcomes and identifies the life events and characteristics of individuals thatpredict changes in economic status.
Further research is needed on the processes which lead to later-life inequality, and on the distributional impact of
public and private pension policies.
ECONOMIC well-being in later life is a central concern
for gerontological social policy and is the object of
extensive income transfer and benefit systems. However, the
determinants of economic well-being in later life, and the
distribution of outcomes which ensue, are insufficiently
understood. It is generally accepted that mean income peaks
in midlife and declines in late life, but analyses vary as to the
age at which income peaks and the typical size of the
subsequent decline. An important question is whether eco-
nomic inequality increases or decreases with advancing age.
No consensus exists with respect to this apparently straight-
forward question (Crystal and Shea, 1990a), which we
address in this article with longitudinal data.
Understanding income distribution among older Ameri-
cans has a variety of important implications for policy.
Later-life income distribution varies considerably among
developed countries (Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwater,
1993), and is shaped not only by the numerous vicissitudes
of individual life events and choices, but also by policy
choices implicit in the design and regulation of retirement
income systems (Crystal, 1984). While working-age adults
receive most of their income from the labor market, most of
the income of older persons in the United States derives from
transfer payments aimed at assuring adequate retirement
income, funded either directly from governmental sources or
from government-regulated, tax-advantaged private pension
systems. Individually purchased retirement accounts, also
government-regulated and tax-advantaged, play an increas-
ingly important role in the retirement income stream as well.
Policy decisions concerning the rules of public and private
retirement income systems have important distributional
consequences; in making such decisions, information about
the net distributional impact of the present system as well as
the probable consequences of specific elements or changes
therein is an important starting point.
Reflecting public and legislative concerns about adequacy
and equity of outcomes, the Social Security system incorpo-
rates explicit "leveling" provisions which return a higher
percentage of preretirement income, and a higher rate of
return on contributions to the system, for lower-income
workers than for higher-income workers. However, cross-
sectional analyses suggest that the effects of these mildly
redistributive Social Security rules on total income are out-
weighted by the unequalizing effects of other retirement
income sources (Crystal and Shea, 1990a). Considering the
scale of governmentally sponsored or regulated income
transfers to older Americans and their cost to working-age
individuals, it is important to understand as much as possible
about issues of equity in the retirement income system and to
understand the net pattern of financial outcomes it produces
for the older age group. Analyzing change in the level of
income inequality within a cohort as its members move from
their working years to their retirement years provides a
picture of the pattern of net outcomes produced by the
retirement income system in later life, as compared to the
pattern of outcomes produced in midlife largely through the
direct consequences of the labor market. This article pro-
vides distributional analyses at the aggregate level and anal-
yses of transitions at the individual level; such analyses are
complementary, providing different perspectives on later-
life outcomes. While needing to be supplemented by other
information, income distribution outcomes are a significant
and under-researched piece of the puzzle that needs to be
assembled to adequately understand the impact of policy
choices on financial outcomes for older individuals.
Empirical estimates of income distribution in relation to
age have varied, and are affected by a variety of conceptual,
methodological, and data choices and problems (Crystal,
1986). Most published analyses of later-life economic well-
being have relied on cross-sectional age comparisons, which
confound within-cohort trajectories and between-cohort dif-
ferences (Jianakoplos, Menchik, and Irvine, 1989). While a
few longitudinal studies have followed cohorts into at least
the earlier years of old age, there has been little use of such
data to estimate what happens to the level of inequality
within a cohort as it ages. There has been somewhat more
S307
S308 CRYSTAL AND WAEHRER
attention to the predictors of individuals' economic status at
different ages and of transitions in economic status, often
across relatively brief time spans. In one significant study,
for example, Leon (1985) analyzed the determinants of
income before and after retirement using Panel Study of
Income Dynamics (PSID) data, suggesting that preretire-
ment economic status is largely perpetuated in postretire-
ment status. Leon's analysis focused only on the year before
and the year after retirement, with a sample of 285 house-
hold heads who did not experience a change in household
composition.
Later-life economic outcomes for individuals involve a
complex set of relationships over time among employment
history, program structure and eligibility, and life events
such as disability and widowhood. There is a shift of princi-
pal income sources from the labor market to public and
private retirement income systems. The pattern of outcomes
which ensues as these shifts take place reflects the structure
of retirement income systems in interaction with the conse-
quences of individual events and choices over the life
course. In analyzing these outcomes, a number of studies
have taken an "event-based" approach to later-life eco-
nomic status, focusing on the relationship between experi-
encing a substantial decline in economic well-being in later
life (e.g., falling into poverty) and events such as retirement
and the death of a spouse (Burkhauser, Butler, and Holden,
1991; Burkhauser, Butler, and Wilkinson, 1985; Burkhauser
and Duncan, 1988, 1989; Burkhauser, Holden, and Feaster,
1988; Hurd and Shoven, 1988). The death of a spouse
appears to substantially increase the probability that an
elderly woman will fall into poverty, but has less impact on
the risk of poverty for men. While public and private pension
programs often moderate the impact of retirement, dramatic
income changes sometimes take place at this time:
Burkhauser and Duncan (1989) found that in 7 percent of
cases, retirement is associated with at least a 50 percent
decrease in economic well-being. Changes in health status
are also associated with downward changes in economic
well-being (Burkhauser, Butler, and Wilkinson, 1985).
"Event-based" studies have been important in beginning
to understand the impact of major life events on economic
outcomes, and more such is needed. Less attention has been
paid to change in overall income distribution within cohorts
as they age. As a cohort progresses from midlife to late life,
shifting from the labor market to the retirement income
system as the principal source of income, does inequality
increase or decrease? Information on inequality is only one
of the relevant criteria by which a nation's retirement income
institutions can be evaluated; we also need to know more
about the types of income changes experienced by differ-
ently situated individuals and the way in which these
changes drive observed changes in income distribution.
Before interpreting within-cohort changes in income distri-
bution, however, we need first to estimate these distribu-
tional changes.
Results of such analyses can shed light on the applicability
of alternative theories of later-life income dynamics. Be-
cause of the important role of Social Security pensions in the
retirement income stream, it has often simply been assumed
that post-retirement economic resources are more equally
distributed than those before retirement age. A theoretical
perspective with different implications, the "aged heteroge-
neity" perspective, notes that in the latter part of the life
cycle, aging is associated with a tendency to increased
heterogeneity with respect to a wide variety of psychologi-
cal, social, biological, and other characteristics (Dannefer
and Sell, 1988). This would suggest that economic differ-
ences as well might tend to increase in later life, at least in
the absence of strongly redistributional policies. Thus, it is
not clear a priori what the net effect of aging on income
distribution in later life would be expected to be. Empirical
studies have variously characterized the process as one of
leveling (Fuchs, 1984; Hurd and Shoven, 1985; Pampel,
1981), status maintenance (Henretta and Campbell, 1976;
Leon, 1985), and cumulative advantage/cumulative disad-
vantage (Crystal and Shea, 1990a, 1990b).
The leveling hypothesis posits that the increased later-life
role of public benefit programs is particularly beneficial to
lower-income individuals and leads to a narrowing of the
income distribution. Fuchs (1984), for example, stated that
" . . . income is more equally distributed after age 65 than
before that age. . . . The principal reason for the narrowing
of inequality after age 65 is that Social Security benefits
become more important and labor income less important,
and the former is distributed much more equally than the
latter.'' Hurd and Shoven (1985), using data from the Social
Security Administration's Retirement History Survey, re-
ported that during the 10 years of the survey, " . . . real
income of the lower tail of the distribution has increased.
This is due to the sharp increase in SSI, Medicare, and Social
Security for this population. . . . " This finding appears to
result in significant part from the study's attribution of the
per capita cost of Medicare to each individual as though it
were cash income, an approach which is controversial (Rad-
ner, 1992).
The "status maintenance" position was articulated by
Henretta and Campbell (1976). Based on findings from a
repeated cross-section ("pseudo-cohort") analysis, they ar-
gue that " . . . the factors which determine income in retire-
ment are the same ones that determine income before retire-
ment." A "status maintenance" interpretation would
suggest that retirement income institutions perpetuate indi-
viduals' preretirement relative economic status, and would
predict a relatively limited degree of turnover in relative
position. The prediction of a "status maintenance" position
as to the overall extent of inequality in the later-life income
distribution is not entirely clear; the assertion that the relative
status of individuals is maintained, with the same factors
predicting preretirement and postretirement status, would
appear to be consistent with either narrowing or widening of
the income distribution.
The cumulative advantage/cumulative disadvantage hy-
pothesis suggests that some effects of early head starts and
handicaps may cumulate over the life span through a variety
of mechanisms; for example, "better" jobs may be even
more sharply distinguished from "worse" jobs by their
benefits than by their salaries (Crystal and Shea, 1990a). To
the extent that these effects outweigh any redistributional
effect of Social Security and means-tested benefits, this
would predict an increase in the overall level of economic
LATER-LIFE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY S309
inequality within a cohort as it ages. A "cumulative advan-
tage" position would imply that individuals with economic
disadvantages that begin early in the life course, such as
limited education or minority-group membership, would not
on average improve their relative or absolute economic
position in later life. However, such a view is not necessarily
inconsistent with turnover in the income distribution. For
example, a scenario in which modestly paid teachers and
ministers with good pension plans were to improve their
relative position after retirement, where commercial fisher-
men and welders without pension plans were to experience
declines, would be entirely consistent with a "cumulative
advantage" model.
In characterizing the dynamics of economic well-being in
later life, an important and often-neglected conceptual dis-
tinction is between individual and population dimensions of
the process. Collectively, the dispersion of income may
decrease, stay the same, or increase as a cohort ages. An
entirely distinct question is the extent to which individuals
do or do not maintain their relative positions within the
distribution. Addressing this question requires data which
follow individuals over time. The distinction between indi-
vidual and population dimensions of income dynamics can
easily be missed in interpreting studies based on cross-
sectional data. For example, findings by Henretta and Camp-
bell (1976) and by Crystal, Shea, and Krishnaswami (1992)
that such social background characteristics as education are
as predictive of income after age 65 as before do not directly
address the question whether individuals remain at the same
relative economic status position, although Henretta and
Campbell interpreted such findings as implying "status
maintenance."
While longitudinal data are essential to a satisfactory
understanding of later-life income dynamics, such data are
scarce, expensive to collect, and suffer from problems of
their own such as sample attrition. Thus, most work on
income distribution in relation to aging has utilized cross-
sectional data. Some cross-sectional studies have shown that
income inequality, as measured by the Gini coefficient, is
higher for older individuals than for younger age groups
(Crystal and Shea, 1990a; Deaton and Paxson, 1994; Rad-
ner, 1987;Taussig, 1973). Such results tend to contradict the
leveling hypothesis. Crystal and Shea (1990a), for example,
constructed a measure of economic well-being that took
account of household composition, assets, and underreport-
ing of some income types, using data from the 1984 panel of
the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). In
this cross-section, inequality decreased with age up to ages
35-44 and increased with age at older ages, with a Gini
coefficient of .415 at ages 75 + . These high levels of
inequality are a concern since they suggest that despite mean
incomes for older Americans which compare favorably with
those of nonelderly persons (Crystal and Shea, 1990b), those
elderly persons in the lower part of the income distribution
share in this bounty only to a very limited extent; at ages
75 + , the less well-off 40 percent snared less than 15 percent
of their age group's total income.
Since elderly and nonelderly individuals in this study were
members of different birth cohorts, however, one cannot
unambiguously attribute cross-sectionally observed differ-
ences to age rather than to cohort effects. The older individ-
uals among whom observed inequality was higher may
represent a "high-inequality cohort," characterized by a
high Gini coefficient at earlier ages as well. Further, the
comparison of population distributions by age tells us noth-
ing about the stability of relative position for individuals. An
additional problem is the effect of differential survival on
income distributions by age. If, for example, individuals in
the upper and lower extremes of the distribution were more
likely to survive than those in the middle, differential mortal-
ity might account for an apparent increase in inequality with
age. In cross-sectional studies, one cannot observe and
correct for the effects of differential survival, since it is
unknown which of the individuals observed at younger ages
will survive to older ages.
Despite these methodological problems with analyses
from cross-sectional data, however, such work, along with
studies suggesting that income inequality among older per-
sons in the U.S. is substantially higher than is the case in
most developed countries (Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwa-
ter, 1993), leads us to hypothesize that inequality within a
cohort will increase with age as the cohort moves from
midlife to later life. This hypothesis is also consistent with
the "aged heterogeneity" perspective suggested by Danne-
fer and Sell (1988) and discussed above. In a similar vein, it
has been suggested by some economic theorists that the
permanent income hypothesis, predicting that consumption
and income from year to year follow a "random walk"
pattern, implies that economic inequality should grow with
age (Deaton and Paxson, 1994). This theoretical perspec-
tive, like the more sociological and epidemiological "aged
heterogeneity" perspective suggested by Dannefer and Sell
(1988), focuses on the effects of individual life-course
events over time, suggesting that the effects of luck will tend
to lead to increasing differences. Linking such perspectives
with analyses of retirement income policies, the "cumula-
tive advantage" model suggested by Crystal and Shea
(1990a) would suggest that in the absence of strongly redis-
tributive retirement income institutions (such as high mini-
mum Social Security benefits), the vicissitudes of life events
would lead to higher inequality in later life. Research on the
distribution of income from non-public retirement income
systems such as private pensions suggests that these income
sources tend to be received disproportionately by more
advantaged members of the labor force (Crystal, 1984), also
supporting the hypothesis that inequality may increase
within a cohort as it enters its later years.
In order to adequately test this hypothesis, long-term
longitudinal data are required. In the present analysis we use
data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Older Men
(NLSOM) to characterize income and inequality trajectories
for three 5-year cohorts of men followed from midlife to late
life. We also use these data to investigate the extent of
movement of individuals within the income distribution over
an extended (15-year) period of time.
METHODS
Data and Measures
Baseline interviews for the NLS Older Men cohort were
S310 CRYSTAL AND WAEHRER
conducted in 1966, providing data on 5020 men aged 45 to
59 in that year. The survey used a multi-stage probability
sample designed to represent the civilian noninstitutiona-
lized population of the United States for men of the specified
ages and their households (Parnes, 1981). Respondents were
drawn from 235 primary sampling units representing every
state. We used data collected in 1966, 1971, 1976, and 1981
personal interviews on income during the previous year.
Representing a 15-year span of ages at baseline, the respon-
dents were divided for analytic purposes into three 5-year
cohorts, each followed for a 15-year period. The overlap-
ping trajectories of these three cohorts provide a perspective
which extends from ages 45-49 (Cohort 1 at baseline) to
ages 70-74 (Cohort 3 in 1980).
The basic measure of income in the NLSOM data is
family income of sample individuals. Use of family income
to measure economic status requires an adjustment for the
number of individuals who must share that income. An
adjustment that is sometimes used is to divide family income
by the size of the family to obtain per capita family income.
However, this approach does not consider economies of
scale in household expenses. A two-person home does not
need twice as many kitchens, refrigerators, or square feet as
a one-person household. We use a fairly standard poverty
line (Orshansky scale) based adjustment which is intermedi-
ate between no adjustment and per capita family income
(Crystal and Shea, 1989; Danziger et al., 1984a, 1984b;
Moon, 1977; Ruggles, 1990; Smeeding, 1977). The adjust-
ment factor is calculated by taking the ratio of the poverty
level for a given household's size to that of a one-person
household.
A potential problem in the analysis is top-coding. Family
income reported for 1965 and 1970 was top-coded at
$50,000 (current dollars). Two percent or fewer of the
reported incomes in these years were top-coded. Family
income reported for 1975 and 1980 was top-coded at
$120,000 and $121,000, respectively. Only one observation
in each of these years was reported at these cutoff levels. In
1987 dollars, the cutoff level for the last time point, 1980, is
quite similar to the cutoff level for the first time point, 1965
($146,289 and $158,100, respectively). Our primary mea-
sure of income inequality, the Gini coefficient, is potentially
sensitive to top-coding. In order to exclude the possibility
that our results are artifacts of top-coding, we also performed
similar analyses using a number of other measures of in-
equality that are unaffected by top-coding at these levels,
with similar results.
Survey attrition and item nonresponse are a substantial
problem in longitudinal surveys of such long duration, and
the NLSOM is no exception. Our measure of income could
be missing for two reasons: item nonresponse or unit nonre-
sponse (respondent not interviewed at a particular wave).
Item nonresponse occurs when a respondent fails to answer
the questions regarding family income or family size (both of
which are necessary in order to calculate our measure of
adjusted family income). In each of the years 1966, 1971,
1976, and 1981, approximately 20 percent of respondents
failed to report family income or family size. The number of
missing values due to noninterview increased as time went
on: 845 in 1971, 1533 in 1976, and 2188 in 1981. By 1981,
60 percent of all missing observations were due to the death
of the respondent.
In order to assess and mitigate potential biases caused by
unit or item nonresponse, we have computed the results
separately for two samples, "survivors" and "everyone."
In the "survivors" analysis, we drop any observation that
has a missing value at the first or last observation (that is,
missing in the 1966 or the 1981 interviews). Since missing
values could arise due to either attrition or item nonresponse,
some observations dropped from the survivors sample are
due to item nonresponse in 1966. In the "everyone" analy-
sis, the results for a given period represent all of the data
available for that period.
To the extent that changes in the composition of the
"everyone" sample match the changes in the population,
the "everyone" sample will provide a good estimate of
inequality changes at the population level. Therefore, the
results from the "everyone" sample are the most relevant
for understanding income adequacy and needs within the
population actually surviving to the 65 + age. However, if
attrition and item nonresponse in the "everyone" sample
differ substantially from changes in the true population, then
our estimates of income inequality could be subject to the
criticism that they are caused by these changes in the sample
over time. Therefore, we also present results from the
"survivor" sample since the "survivor" sample, for the
most part, follows the same individuals over time and, thus,
measures changes in the distribution of income of this
"fixed" sample. The "survivor" analyses filter out the
effects of differential mortality or loss-to-followup on in-
come distribution within a cohort over time. The major aim
of analyzing inequality trends in both ways is to determine
whether these observed trends are robust with respect to
alternative definitions of the population in question. If
results are similar in both kinds of analyses, as they turn out
to be, the inference is strengthened that there is a true within-
cohort increase in inequality over time, which is not ac-
counted for simply by compositional change in the cohort
and which describes the level of inequality among those
surviving to various ages.
Measurement of Income Inequality
Measures of income inequality are essentially dispersion
measures of the distribution of income. Most analyses of
income inequality rely on single-value measures such as the
commonly used Gini coefficient, since measures that cannot
be summarized by a single value provide only an incomplete
ranking of income distributions. The measurement of in-
come inequality involves a number of problems. The con-
cept of inequality has been operationalized in several differ-
ent ways, with the Gini coefficient one of the most widely
used. Unlike quintile-based measures, which are also com-
monly used, the Gini coefficient is independent of the units
used to measure income. Any mean-preserving spread ap-
plied to a distribution will cause the Gini coefficient for that
distribution to increase.
Analyses utilizing Gini coefficients have often lacked
confidence intervals or hypothesis tests for differences in
coefficients, since these calculations are somewhat difficult
(particularly for weighted data, which do not necessarily
LATER-LIFE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY S311
represent a well-defined distributional form). Even though
variance estimators for the Gini coefficient from unweighted
data have long been available (Glasser, 1962; Hoeffding,
1948), tests relating to the sampling distribution of the Gini
coefficient are, according to Yitzhaki (1991), "seldom"
performed due to the complexity of the variance estimators.
In the present study, we used a bootstrap resampling method
to perform rank tests on the estimated Gini coefficients. This
procedure also addresses the possibility that estimates are
sensitive to measurement error at the extremes of the distri-
bution. If a small number of observations have a large
impact on the Gini coefficient calculation, the resampling
method will detect this by estimating a wider sampling
distribution for the coefficient. The present study uses sam-
ples of quite substantial size and, as will be noted, most
observed differences are statistically significant.
Estimation of Gini coefficients and their confidence inter-
vals with this data set must take account of the weighted
sampling in the NLS. Let i = 1,. . . , k index individual
observations in the data such that the data are in ascending
order by income (k denotes the number of observations). The
income and sampling weight for the ith observation are n,
and wif
respectively. The formula for the Gini coefficient for
weighted data can be written as
Gw = 1 +
When the sampling weights w, are constant across observa-
tions, the above expression reduces to the formula for the
Gini coefficient given by Sen (1973).
Cowell (1989) provides an unbiased estimator for the Gini
coefficient calculated from a weighted sample. However,
Nygard and Sandstrom (1989), in a Monte Carlo comparison
of explicit variance expressions and resampling estimates of
the sampling distribution of the Gini coefficient, find no
statistical basis to prefer either technique. In this application,
we opted to use a resampling technique for hypothesis
testing on the estimated Gini coefficient. A bootstrap sample
was constructed by randomly sampling with replacement
from the original sample until the sum of the weights in the
bootstrap sample was (approximately) equal to the sum of
the weights in the original sample. A Gini coefficient was
then calculated from the bootstrap sample. We repeated this
procedure 1000 times. The resulting set of 1000 Gini coef-
ficients is an empirical estimate of the sampling distribution
of the Gini coefficient from the original sample and is used to
test the significance of differences in coefficients from one
wave to the subsequent wave. A rank test is used to evaluate
the hypothesis that the two empirical distributions were
drawn from the same underlying distribution. Let F, and F2
represent the cumulative distribution functions of the two
sampling distributions. The test assumes that F,(x) =
F2
(x + a). The null hypothesis is that a = 0, and the alterna-
tive hypothesis is that a =
£ 0.
A potential weakness of the Gini coefficient is its sensitiv-
ity to changes in the tails of the distribution. Such sensitivity
may be a problem if the data are top-coded or if there is
measurement error in the tails. To demonstrate that our
conclusions are robust, we confirmed our results with similar
analyses using three other measures of income inequality:
the coefficient of variation, the lower quartile of income as a
percentage of the upper quartile, and the interquartile range
as a percentage of the lower quartile. While the coefficient of
variation is sensitive to small changes in the tails of the
distribution, our other two measures will be unaffected.
To help inform our analysis of income inequality, we
present a number of results relating to the degree of individ-
ual mobility within the distribution of income. While related
to inequality, high degrees of mobility can persist in the
presence of increasing, decreasing, or constant inequality.
For example, if two individuals switch incomes, then in-
equality remains unchanged but mobility exists within the
income distribution.
RESULTS
Figures 1 and 2 report average real adjusted income by
cohort. Figure 1 depicts the results for the "everyone"
sample, and Figure 2 depicts the results for the "survivors"
sample. The "survivors" group includes all individuals with
nonmissing observations of income at the first and last wave.
For the "survivors'' group the sample size is the same for the
first and last wave for each cohort, but at the second and third
waves the sample sizes are slightly smaller. This occurs
because some of the individuals with nonmissing observa-
tions at the first and last waves have missing values on the
intervening observations. In the "everyone" sample all of
the nonmissing observations in a given wave were used to
calculate the average. The sample sizes in the "everyone"
analysis are substantially larger than in the "survivors"
analysis.
For cohorts 1 and 2, adjusted real income peaks at 55-59
years of age for both "survivors" and "everyone." For
cohort 3 adjusted real income peaks at 60-64 years of age.
This difference in the peak earning years may be due to a
period effect. Note that cohorts 1 and 2 had large increases in
average income from the first to the second observations
(from 1965 to 1970). The period between 1965 and 1970
was one of strong real income growth in the United States,
which may have resulted in a later age peak for the oldest
cohort.
Income Distribution
Within each cohort, Gini coefficients were calculated at
each wave. Because of the identification problem among
age, cohort, and year of observation (any two of these define
the third), it is not possible to identify age, cohort, and year
effects on the level of inequality unambiguously and simul-
taneously. However, one can make comparisons with such
data two dimensions at a time: in particular, one can com-
pare the level of inequality within each cohort as it reaches
different ages, and one can compare the level of inequality
by age group at each time of observation. For survivors,
these results are depicted in Figure 3. Because we wished to
test the hypothesis that inequality within each cohort in-
creased as the cohort aged, we focused particularly on
comparing within-cohort inequality as the cohort reached
different ages (reading down the columns of Figure 3).
However, since each 5-year cohort was observed at 5-year
intervals, the results form a matrix which can also be read

across (comparing cohorts with respect to inequality at a
given age), or diagonally (showing cross-sectional compari-
sons by age at each year of observation). Read diagonally, as
indicated by the shading, Figure 3 shows a higher level of
inequality among older respondents; this pattern was ob-
served at each time of observation. For example, in 1980 the
Gini coefficient was .369 among persons 60-64 and consid-
erably higher, .452, among persons 70-74. These cross-
sectional comparisons both for "survivors" and for "every-
one' ' indicate that the Gini coefficient was higher at the older
ages, at each time of observation, consistent with the cross-
sectional findings reported by Crystal and Shea (1990a)
using SIPP data.
Reading across the rows of Figure 3, we can compare
cohorts with respect to the level of inequality experienced at
the point that the cohort reaches a given age (which was
attained at different calendar years by each cohort). At ages
55-59 and 60-64, where we can compare all three 5-year
cohorts, the level of inequality was higher in the oldest than
in the youngest 5-year cohort, with the middle cohort experi-
encing an intermediate level of inequality. At ages 65-69,
where we can compare the older two cohorts, there was
essentially no difference between them (Gini coefficients of
.422 and .425, respectively).
When within-cohort change in income distribution was
examined, a pattern of increasing inequality over time was
evident, both in "survivors" and in "everyone" analyses.
Figures 4 and 5 provide a graphic depiction of the "trajec-
tory of inequality," as indicated by the Gini coefficients
within each cohort as the cohort aged. For each cohort in

both types of analyses, there was a significant and substantial
increase in the Gini coefficient from the first observation to
the last. In the "survivors" analysis of the oldest cohort, for
example, the coefficient increased from .391 at ages 55
through 59 to .452 at ages 70 through 74. These results show
that inequality did increase within each cohort as it aged.
In order to test for significant differences between the Gini
coefficients, an empirical sampling distribution of 1000
resamplings was constructed for each Gini coefficient pre-
sented in Figures 4 and 5 using the bootstrap technique
discussed above. We then used a rank test to evaluate
changes in income inequality over time for each cohort. We
also tested for differences in income inequality across co-
horts at each time period and at each age. The null hypothe-
sis that there is no change was rejected in every case (at a
95% level) except in the comparison of the "everyone" Gini
coefficients for cohort 1 at ages 45-49 and 50-54.
We also measured inequality using the coefficient of
variation, the lower quartile of income as a percentage of the
upper quartile, and the interquartile range as a percentage of
the lower quartile. The last two of these measures are
insensitive to errors in the tails of the distribution of income.
These alternate measures indicate an increase in inequality
from the 1966 interview to the 1981 interview for all three
cohorts and both samples. For instance, in the survivors
sample the interquartile range as a percentage of the bottom
quartile increased from 1.4 to 1.8 for Cohort 1, from 2.0 to
2.4 for Cohort 2, and from 2.0 to 2.3 for Cohort 3.
Individual. Mobility
To understand the implications of these patterns of in-
equality over time, it is also important to determine the
extent of individual mobility within the income distribution.
Studies of such shifts have often focused on the proportion of
cases which experience transition from one status to another,
such as from nonpoor to poor. It is useful, however, to
utilize approaches which distinguish large changes from
small ones and which provide information on the size of
shifts. The median size of transitions upward and down-
ward, and the probability of transition from one income
quintile to another, provide complementary perspectives on
the extent of income mobility. Table 1 shows the number of
cases experiencing increases and decreases in income among
survivors in each cohort as the cohort aged by 5-year incre-
ments, and the median size of the changes. The sum of the
n's in Table 1 for each cohort represents the total number of
survivors with data in each pair of years. Changes in income
as cohorts aged from 45-49 to 50-54 and from 50-54 to 55-
59 were more likely to be upward than downward in each
cohort, and the median size of upward changes was larger.
Change in income from 55-59 to 60-64 varied somewhat by
cohort and year of observation, involving frequent change in
both directions. Changes in income from ages 60-64 to ages
65-69, and from ages 65-69 to ages 70-74, were about
twice as likely to be downward as upward, and downward
changes tended to be somewhat larger than upward changes.
In Table 1, even a small increase or decrease counted as a
positive or negative change. However, the typical magni-
tude of changes was substantial: the median absolute per-
centage change in real income ranged from 27 percent to 41
percent, with the largest changes occurring as individuals in
Cohort 2 went from ages 60-64 to ages 65-69 and as they
went from ages 65-69 to ages 70-74.
While Table 1 illustrates changes in real income, which
reflect both the changing fortunes of the cohort and move-
ment within it, Tables 2 and 3 focus on individual shifts
within each cohort's income distribution, that is, change in
status relative to one's peers. Shifts were computed for 5-
year, 10-year, and 15-year periods. Table 2 shows the matrix
of transition probabilities, for the full 15-year period, from
one quintile in the income distribution to another.
Quintiles are numbered from 1 (best-off) to 5 (worst-off);
baseline quintiles are defined on the basis of an individual's
adjusted family income in 1965, and ending quintiles are
defined on the basis of an individual's adjusted family
income in 1980. Rates of transition were substantial. In
Cohort 1, for example, members of the poorest quantile at
baseline had a 46.6 percent chance of being in the poorest
quintile in 1980, so that more than half had shifted from this
disadvantaged position. Probabilities along the diagonal of
the matrix correspond to no change in quintile. Except for
the upper left-hand comer and the lower right-hand comer of
each matrix, the probabilities along the diagonal are gener-
ally less than .30. That is, if an individual was in either the
second, third, or fourth quintile at the baseline observation,
then he had less than a 30 percent probability of being in the
same quintile at the last observation. The higher stability
rates in the upper left-hand and lower right-hand are in-
fluenced by ceiling and floor effects, i.e., movements from
the best-off quintile can only be downward and vice versa.
In order to show 5-year as well as 15-year patterns of
transition and to distinguish transitions to adjacent quintiles
(which could be caused by small shifts) from larger changes,
Table 3 collapses the transition matrix to show the probabili-
ties of a change upward or downward of more than one
quintile. Such changes represent sizable movements in rela-
tive position within the distribution of income. To simplify
the interpretation, increase cell sizes, and include shifts up to
the 65-74 age range, Cohorts 2 and 3 were merged and

Cohort 1 was not included. The first three columns of Table
3 label the quintile at the beginning of the transition and
provide the sample sizes. The last four columns of the table
present the results; the dates across the top label the period of
transition. The first two lines represent (downward) move-
ment of more than one quintile from positions in the best-off
two quintiles. The third line contains two probabilities, one
pertaining to movements down of more than one quintile and
one pertaining to movements up of more than one quintile.
The fourth and fifth lines represent (upward) movement of
more than one quintile from positions in the worst-off two
quintiles.
Table 3 shows that even when attention is restricted to
substantial changes in position (more than one quintile), a
considerable proportion of respondents changed their posi-
tion over a 15-year period. For example, among those in the
top quintile in 1965, 28 percent were in the third quintile or
below in 1980. Of those in the lowest quintile in 1965, 19
percent were in the third quintile or higher in 1980. When
movements from the highest and lowest quintile are corn-

pared, it is evident that in the first two transition periods,
movement from the top quintile substantially downward (by
more than one quintile) is more prevalent than substantial
movement from the bottom upward. However, in the last
transition period, from an average age of 65 to an average
age of 70, more individuals in the lowest quintile substan-
tially improved their position than individuals in the highest
quintile moved downward.
DISCUSSION
Variations in age of retirement, pension coverage, health
and marital status, and many other intervening variables
shape the distribution of later-life economic outcomes and
the distribution of income in later years. Through this re-
search we aim to characterize the overall extent of inequality
and mobility within the income distribution that is the net
result of these processes in later life. The results support the
hypothesis that income distribution within each cohort in-
creases as the cohort passes into later life. This pattern was
found both in "survivors" and "everyone" analyses, sug-
gesting that the pattern is robust and that the increase is not
simply the result of changes in cohort composition such as
disproportionate mortality at the extremes of the distribu-
tion. The high level of economic inequality in later life and
the pattern of increase with age suggest that there may be a
need to reexamine the degree of protection which retirement
income policies provide to less-advantaged elderly individ-
uals and to those who experience adverse life events that can
threaten their economic well-being.
Over this relatively restricted range of cohorts, represent-
ing a 15-year span of birth years, the oldest of the three 5-
year cohorts appears to have experienced higher inequality
than the younger cohorts at a given age for ages under 65.
However, by age 65-69, convergence was seen both in
"everyone" and "survivors" analyses between the level of
inequality of the oldest and the middle cohorts, the two
cohorts which reached that age during the period of observa-
tion. Indeed, the two younger cohorts appear to have experi-
enced a sharper within-cohort increase in inequality after age
59 than was the case for the older one. Because of the within-
cohort increases, inequality reached a very high level (Gini
higher than 0.4) after age 65 for both 5-year cohorts that
were followed to that age range.
By themselves, of course, the distributional findings pro-
vide only part of the picture needed to understand the
consequences of policy choices. The characterization of
these distributional outcomes needs to be followed up with
more work on the processes which produce these levels of

inequality. Two important lines of work involve longitudinal
analyses of outcomes experienced by differently situated
individuals, and of the distributional impact of specific
income sources. Employment income received by individ-
uals over age 60 and especially by those over age 65 appears
to be one unequalizing factor (although it should be noted
that inequality in our study was even higher after age 70,
when few individuals were still working). Private pension
income is another major unequalizing factor: such income is
received mostly by individuals with the highest incomes
from Social Security and other sources (Crystal and Shea,
1989, 1990a). Social Security income is more equally dis-
tributed than is total income (Crystal and Shea, 1990a), but
the redistributive elements in Social Security formulas do
not appear to be sufficient to produce a ' 'leveling effect'' for
total income after retirement age.
Another perspective on the processes which may be lead-
ing to the observed high level of inequality observed at the
later ages can be gained by comparing inequality indices for
elderly persons across countries with differing retirement
income systems, using cross-sectional census data. Benefits
(both public and private) that are directly related to the level
of preretirement contributions play a larger role in the U.S.
than in most developed countries for which comparative data
are available, while public flat-rate benefits, minimum
benefits, and means-tested programs play a smaller role.
Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwater (1993), in a comparison
of eight developed countries, found that minimum benefits
in the U.S. were the smallest among the countries in propor-
tion to median income for people of all ages. Social insur-
ance such as Social Security retirement pensions and means-
tested income combined accounted for 58 percent of the
income of elderly people in the U.S., a lower figure than for
any of the other countries. The relatively limited role of flat-
rate, minimum, and means-tested benefits in the U.S. retire-
ment income system, and the prominent role of private
pensions, seems to be related to the high level of income
inequality among older persons in the U.S. These structural
features may interact with individual life events in such a
way as to produce outcomes that are problematic from the
point of view of equity and adequacy for less-advantaged
elderly individuals. Smeeding, Torrey, and Rainwater found
that for both the 65-74 and the 75 + age ranges, inequality
as measured by the Gini coefficient was higher for the U.S.
than for the seven other countries studied.
By their nature, cohort studies provide direct information
only on particular cohorts entering old age during particular
historical periods. The extent to which the pattern of increas-
ing within-cohort inequality projects to later cohorts can
only be answered empirically. What the results do indicate is
that over a 15-year period of considerable real income
growth for older people, for the cohorts which make up
today's 75 + population, within-cohort inequality increased
with time. Members of these cohorts benefited from consid-
erable increases in the real value of Social Security benefits
during the early 1970s, but this "rising tide" did not lead to
reduced disparity in economic outcomes as cohort members
moved into their sixties and seventies.
Our analysis of individual transitions suggests the impor-
tance of distinguishing between population-level and
individual-level dimensions of the pattern of economic out-
comes. These distinctions are often obscured in studies
based on cross-sectional data, in which inferences about
individual-level outcomes must be made from population-
level data. Comparison between cross-sectional and longitu-
dinal results helps to define the several distinct empirical
questions which need to be addressed in order to develop a
better understanding of later-life economic outcomes. First,
what happens to the overall level of inequality within a
cohort as that cohort ages? This is a population-level ques-
tion which describes the distribution of resources within the
cohort at a given time as it reaches various ages. A high and
increasing level of inequality implies a "two worlds of
aging" pattern of outcomes (Crystal, 1984), but does not tell
us whether economically advantaged elderly persons are the
same individuals who were economically advantaged earlier
in the life course. The present longitudinal analysis of NLS
data is consistent with cross-sectional analyses of SIPP data
(Crystal and Shea, 1990a) in suggesting that the level of
population inequality increases after age 65. A second and
distinct set of questions concerns the extent to which eco-
nomic status is maintained over time for individuals. Here,
the longitudinal results suggest a fairly substantial level of
turnover in the distribution, suggesting that individual status
is not necessarily maintained.
Measuring the degree of stability through transition matri-
ces adds another dimension to the picture provided by the
distributional analysis and suggests several further questions
as a focus for future research. The results tend to disconfirm
the claim that later-life outcomes are characterized by "sta-
tus maintenance.'' It could be argued (as it has for economic
mobility at younger ages) that these results mitigate the
problematic nature of the high level of inequality observed
among older people in the U.S. Certainly, they suggest the
absence of a rigid social stratification system by which
retirement income institutions perpetuate the economic posi-
tion occupied by an individual at midlife. However, the
implications of large changes in relative status may differ
when these changes occur late in life, and depend on who
experiences upward and downward changes. Economic mo-
bility in late life, as compared to such mobility earlier in the
life course, is less likely to result from the exercise of
entrepreneurial initiative, ambition, and talent (or lack
thereof) and more likely to result from other factors. Such
factors may include, on the one hand, adverse life events
such as widowhood, severe illness, or the onset of functional
dependency, and on the other hand such aspects of "luck"
as good health, good fortune with investments, remarriage,
or inheritance. For individuals whose life style was comfort-
able at midlife, large downward transitions can represent a
wrenching readjustment, and we found that such changes
(downward transitions of more than one quintile) were not
uncommon. For example, among those at the middle level of
economic status at baseline at ages 45-59 (those in the third
quintile), who were experiencing fairly comfortable circum-
stances at midlife, 19 percent were in the worst-off quintile
15 years later, representing a poverty or near-poverty life
style. These results suggest the need for further research on
the life events associated with such transitions, and the
degree to which social insurance and other retirement in-
LATER-LIFE ECONOMIC INEQUALITY S317
come institutions protect individuals who experience health
crises, loss of a spouse, and other catastrophes to which
individuals are vulnerable in late life. It has been said that
"old age is not for sissies"; social policy usually cannot
protect older people from such events, but it can provide
some protection from their financial consequences.
In the context of relatively high income mobility in later
life, what is the significance of the high level of inequality at
these ages and the widening of the income distribution
within cohorts? Widening of an income distribution over
time tends to magnify the size of transitions within that
distribution. Shifts from the middle to the extremes of the
distribution will on average be larger than those from the
extremes to the middle, producing "big winners" and "big
losers" in life's sweepstakes. The Gini coefficient's large
size at ages over 65 suggests that there is a wide gap in
economic well-being between those older people who fall at
different positions in the income distribution. Thus, for
example, going from the middle to the bottom quintile is a
more wrenching transition than would be the case in a
narrow income distribution which becomes further com-
pressed as a cohort ages. Similarly, upward transitions in
relative status are magnified in a distribution that is widening
over time. Indeed, an interesting and under-researched story
in gerontology involves understanding the circumstances of
those who make large improvements in their relative and
absolute economic position after retirement.
From the point of view of equity, adequately interpreting
the implications of this set of findings will depend on further
research on the circumstances of individuals who ultimately
land in the penury represented by the low end of the income
distribution or the prosperity represented by the top end.
High inequality would not be as much of a concern if the
individuals who wind up at the lower end of the distribution
were healthy individuals with strong potential support sys-
tems, who may not have needed or qualified for public
benefits. However, we know from cross-sectional studies
that individuals who end up low in the income distribution
after age 65 tend to be in poorer health; to have more
functional impairments; to have minimal or no financial
assets; and to have other characteristics suggestive of long-
term economic disadvantage, such as less education and
histories of lower-status occupations (Crystal, 1996; Crystal
and Shea, 1989, 1990a; Henretta and Campbell, 1976).
Crystal, Shea, and Krishnaswami (1992) found that years of
education, typically completed before age 30, were more
predictive of income after age 65 than earlier in the life
course. Mobility in position in the income distribution, as
observed in our current study, does not necessarily mitigate
the implications of high levels of later-life inequality. In-
deed, there is some evidence to suggest that those individ-
uals who are most economically vulnerable (because of
limited education, poor health, or other factors) experience
the full consequences of their vulnerability only in late life,
while those with more advantaged backgrounds benefit dis-
proportionately from "reserve resources" such as health,
pension entitlements, and investments at that time (Crystal,
1984; Crystal and Shea, 1990a; Crystal, Shea, and
Krishnaswami, 1992).
To understand the extent to which such a scenario is
typical, more longitudinal research is needed on which
individuals are experiencing what kinds of income changes.
What characteristics and life events predict major upward or
downward changes in economic status? To what extent, for
example, are such changes the result of changes in health
and functional status or changes in marital status? Under
what circumstances and to what extent does the "social
safety net'' buffer such changes? To what extent can they be
seen as the result of choices made earlier in life, on the one
hand, or the result of unpredictable hazards of life, on the
other? To what extent do permanent or early-established
social characteristics of individuals such as race, gender,
parental socioeconomic status, and education predict
postretirement-age income? Results of the present study
indicate the importance of these research agendas, which
require longitudinal data that combine good-quality eco-
nomic measures with considerable detail on health status,
health care costs, functional status, and changes in social
circumstances.
This empirical analysis highlights a seeming paradox:
increasing inequality at the population level within a cohort
as it ages, accompanied by a considerable degree of turnover
in relative position. To understand the implications of the
individual-level changes, and to inform public policy, more
longitudinally based research is needed on the determinants
of individual change in economic status, and on the way in
which life events and the structure of the retirement income
system interact in shaping these outcomes.
