Introduction
Common practices to support elite student athletes (ESA)
can be identified in different countries and cities around the
world (Radtke & Coalter, 2007; Stambulova & Ryba, 2013).
As athletic performance and career development of elite ath-
letes are closely linked, it is important to implement and sup-
port research into elite athletes and their careers, particularly
ESAs' psychosocial determinants of dual career develop-
ment, as highlighted by sociologists and psychologists
(Stambulova, Engström, Franck, Linnér, & Lindahl, 2014).
An athletic career, as defined byAlfermann and Stambulova
(2007), is a succession of stages and transitions that includes
childhood, adolescence, adulthood, and older ages. During all
stages, an individual needs to reach his or her full athletic
potential to maximize the benefits of participating in sports
while dealing with other aspects of his or her life. This is espe-
cially significant as an athlete enters adolescence, when they
need to be educated in school and participate in sports at the
same time. Therefore, the concept of dual career concerns the
integration of an athletic career with education or work to
attain a balance during multiyear sports activities. The notion
of dual career provides a suitable solution for elite athletes to
balance their sport with education or work, and prepare for
their future after sport. This can reduce the risk of unintended
athletic termination or dropout (Conzelmann & Nagel, 2003;
Donnelly & Petherick, 2004; Wylleman & Reints, 2010).
Balancing an athletic career and education or work can be a
challenging task for elite athletes due to the increasing high
pressure and continuous demands for elite performances.
Regarding the different phases of elite athletes' career
development and transition, researchers have proposed differ-
ent conceptual "transition models," such as Sussman's (1972)
analytical model, which stressed the role of personal, social,
and environmental factors; Schlossberg's (1981) model of
human adaptation to transition, which emphasized the ath-
lete's perception, attributes, and environmental characteristics;

Abstract
Previous research has encouraged a cultural specific framework to be developed through research in Asian countries,
such as China, to help internationalize the findings and help athletes to adapt them to their society and culture. Based
on a socioecological framework, this study investigated how social-ecological determinants affect elite student athletes'
(ESA) experience of the socialization process of dual career development in Hong Kong and Taiwan. We interviewed
eight ESAs who trained at the national level, studying simultaneously at universities in Hong Kong and Taiwan. Grounded
theory techniques and procedures were used to analyze the data. Results revealed that ESAs are affected by interrelated
determinants at different levels: individual (career aims, identities, roles, characters, self-efficacy, and motivation), micro-level
(coaches, teammates, parents, siblings, physical education [PE] teachers, other teachers, alumni, seniors, and classmates),
meso-level (interrelations between individual and micro-level), exo-level (government, financial, policy, academic, medical,
and parent­teacher association), macro-level (attitudes, norms, values, beliefs, resources, and culture), and chrono-level
(transition).

while the Hopson and Adams (1977) and Kubler-Ross (1969)
models described the stages and emotional implications
of retirement (Wylleman, Alfermann, & Lavallee, 2004).
Stambulova (1994) developed the athlete career transition
model through her investigation of Russian athletes. She sug-
gested that the transition was a process of coping with demands
and challenges that resulted in either a successful or crisis tran-
sition. Stambulova's transition model emphasized the impor-
tance of adaptation in a successful transition process.
Wylleman et al. (2004) pointed out that the interventions sug-
gested were developed in parallel with the transition concept,
such as strategies using projective techniques (Bardaxoglou,
1997), psychoanalytic approach (Chamalidis, 1995), and an
information processing approach (Lavallee, Nesti, Borkoles,
Cockerill, & Edge, 2000). Based on these approaches, there
have been athlete life-skills programs or career development
programs managed by different sports governing bodies,
Olympic Committees, sports federations, and nongovernmen-
tal organizations, which have drawn on the transition approach,
to help athletes develop postsporting careers. In addition,
Cabrita, Rosado, Leite, Serpa, and Sousa (2014) reported that
elite athletes with higher athletic identity have a higher level of
career decision-making self-efficacy and higher levels of opti-
mism for the future, and are particularly more likely to choose
a sports-related profession.
Although there have been extensive researches published
about sports career development and transition (Lavallee
et al., 2000; Stambulova & Ryba, 2013; Wylleman et al.,
2004), these studies have been mainly carried out in the
United States, Canada, Europe, and Australia. Since the
1990s, researchers have been exploring the perceived social
and psychological conditions of adjustment during turning
phases in the career development of elite athletes (Swain &
Ballard, 1991). These studies concluded that preparation,
establishment of coping strategies, and goal-setting are
needed to succeed at different transition stages. In addition,
Stambulova, Alfermann, Statler, and Côté (2009) and
Stambulova and Ryba (2013) also encouraged the develop-
ment of cultural specific frameworks through research in
Asian countries, such as China, to internationalize these
studies and help athletes adapt within their own society and
culture. Particularly, it is important that in the study of the
career development of ESAs in Hong Kong and Taiwan,
Chinese culture, social, political, and historical factors
should be taken into account.
Career Development of ESAs in the Greater
China Region
The Greater China Region comprises four cross-straits
places. These are Mainland China, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and
Macau. Studies related to elite athletes' career development
conducted in Mainland China and Taiwan are mainly in the
Chinese language. No research study has been found in
Macau. As to the Hong Kong context, a recent study con-
ducted by Zhang, Chung, Si, and Gucciardi (2016) reported
that experiential avoidance mediated an inverse association
between mindfulness and ESAs' burnout in their career
development. Another study (Sum & Ma, 2014) examined
the support given to ESAs in Hong Kong secondary schools.
The results suggested that further study is required to under-
stand the current situation of ESAs and to explore how key
determinants affect the ways in which ESAs manage their
dual (academic and athletic) careers. Chow (2001) used the
life history approach to examine the ways in which female
ESAs feel and think about the career transition from compe-
tition to retirement. The study revealed that female ESAs
experienced their career development in sport together with
pursuing an education, which affected their transition to
retirement and lifestyle after their sports career.
There are limited studies relating to career development
in the Greater China Region. Moreover, because of funding
paid by taxpayers allocated to elite athletic development, this
should be used to maximum effect so that elite athletes per-
form to their best ability and bring good repute to their coun-
tries.Asaresult,thereisaneedtounderstandthedeterminants
of ESAs'dual career development, particularly at the univer-
sity level, as they approach the mastery stage (Wylleman &
Reints, 2010). In particular, the multiple, interrelated social
and contextual determinants that affect ESAs' career devel-
opment should be considered.
A Social-Ecological Perspective
Li and Sum (in press) employed a qualitative metasynthesis
method to review the literature on dual career experiences
of elite athletes from 1996 to 2015. Results indicated that
elite athletes underwent some individual issues (involving
psychological, physical, and emotional impact on the ath-
letes), interpersonal issues (concerning elite athletes' inter-
actions or relationships within their families, schools, or
training), and external issues (involving practical support,
conditions, and environment) in their career development
(Li & Sum, in press). In the context of ecological systems
theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1994), the above metasyn-
thesis review study disclosed some substantial determi-
nants of elite athletes' dual career development, which are
explicitly social-ecological in nature.
Likewise, Golden and Earp (2012) drew upon the social-
ecological model on five levels, namely: (a) intrapersonal
(individual), (b) interpersonal, (c) institutional, (d) commu-
nity, and (e) public policy in their health education study.
When applied to ESAs' career development, such a social-
ecological model locates the individual ESAat the center and
classifies the overlapping and interrelating systems that
influence the individual ESAs. This model is helpful for
exploring individual ESAs'career development by recogniz-
ing that the ESAs are situated in a complex social context.
Sum et al. 3
We, thus, conceive that ESAs' career development is
socially situated and affected by multiple social and individ-
ual factors. ESAs' career development is not merely due to
the individual input alone, but also due to aspects of their
social contexts, such as schools, families, training places,
policy, and environment.
Purpose
The purpose of this study was, therefore, to provide an initial
investigation of the social-ecological determinants that help
to explain how ESAs experience dual career development,
using ecological systems theory (Bronfenbrenner, 1977,
1994) as a theoretical framework.
Method of the Research
The main research question of this study was, "How do
social-ecological determinants affect ESAs' lives and career
development?" The following specific research questions
were addressed:
Research Question 1: What are the career aims of ESAs?
Research Question 2: How do ESAs describe their ath-
letic and academic experiences?
Research Question 3: How do ESAs describe and con-
ceptualize their career development?
Research Question 4: What are the individual, interper-
sonal, and external determinants, and how do these deter-
minants affect ESAs' career development?
With more than 15 years of qualitative research experi-
ence, the research team employed individual and focus group
interviews to collect relevant data. The grounded theory
techniques and procedures outlined by Strauss and Corbin
(1998) were used to explore the exuberance and multiplicity
of experiences of ESAs conveyed in their own words. Details
of the research plan and data collection procedures are shown
in what follows.
Participants
Using the snowball or chain sampling method (Patton,
2002), the researchers identified suitable participants for the
study. ESAs were requested to help identify other individu-
als from whom the researchers could extract or generate
data. Selection of the next interviewee was based on what
was found during the previous round of data collection and
analysis.
ESAs selected for this study were from a variety of
backgrounds. Eight ESAs (four males, four females; four
from Hong Kong, four from Taiwan) between the ages of
19 and 25 years were purposively recruited from a variety
of backgrounds to enrich the contextual analysis. Their
years of experience as ESAs were between 5 and 12 years
(see Table 1).
Data Collection
To build up mutual trust and rapport between participants
and researchers, the researchers contacted the participants
directly to explain the aims of the study. The informants were
contacted by telephone and followed up by e-mail, whereby
the researchers sent a written consent form to participants to
explain how data were to be collected, processed, and used.
Interviews were conducted in participants' universities at
their available time slots.
The researchers used one-on-one semistructured inter-
views (Wragg, 2002) followed by focus group interviews
(Krueger & Casey, 2000). Interview questions were devel-
oped from previous literature on the dual career development
of elite athletes. One ESA was invited for interview as a pilot
study to check whether the interview questions were appro-
priate to answer the specific research questions.

Barbour and Kitzinger (1999) stated that combining focus
group research tools with other qualitative methods can be
fruitful and that some respondents were more likely to answer
questions through a researcher-convened group with consid-
eration of the group context. The aim of the focus group inter-
views was to summarize the one-on-one interview data to
participants so that they could reflect on them and make com-
parisons between themselves and their counterparts. The
researchers conducted two focus group interviews in each
region wherein each group comprised four ESAs.
Both the one-on-one and focus group interviews were
audiotaped and transcribed by the researchers. Interview
material was transcribed verbatim as soon as it was collected.
With regard to the quality, consistency, and accuracy of data
collection and analysis, the researchers were responsible for
data collection, transcription, and interpretation. Examples
of raw data and themes are shown in Table 2.
Data Analysis
Following grounded theory techniques and procedures out-
lined by Strauss and Corbin (1998), the transcribed inter-
views were analyzed by using coding procedures. Transcripts
were fractured sentence by sentence in the opening coding
stage. During the coding process, we frequently discussed
the code list and added codes that emerged through the
process. The codes were then sorted to generate categories
and subcategories. Analysis focused on the relationships
between categories and their subcategories. Constant com-
parison analysis and categorization aimed to categorize
codes into higher-order themes.
Protection of Human Rights and Establishing
Trustworthiness
Written consent forms were signed by the respondents before
the interviews. ESAs' participation was strictly voluntary.
Confidentiality of information was affirmed. ESA partici-
pants were identified only by a pseudonym in all records.
Credibility, transferability, dependability, and confirmability
(Lincoln & Guba, 1985) were implemented through provid-
ing a summary of the participant's responses immediately
after each interview to enable member check. Systematic
record-keeping and continuing evaluation of theories and
findings was an essential part of the process. Approval for
use on human subjects was obtained from the University
Survey and Behavioural Research Ethics Committee.

dual career development revealed that the participants were

situated in a complex social context where career development
was not solely determined by ESAs individually, but was also
affected by their social contexts, such as schools, families,
training places, policies, and environment. Throughout their
dual career development, ESAs experienced time-consuming
athletic and academic lives and had to strike a balance between
sports and studies. Frustration from both academic and athletic
aspects was dealt with regardless of its source, and ESAs'dual
career development was prevailed over by several individual,
micro-level, meso-level, exo-level, and macro-level determi-
nants per se (see Figure 1). All the different levels of determi-
nants are interrelated and together affect the ESAs'dual career
development (Table 2).
Individual Determinants
Individual determinants were comprised of ESAs' career
aims, identities, roles, characters, self-efficacy, and motiva-
tion. The career aims of ESAs varied from having a clear
athletic goal to having a loss of direction in their future career
development. Young (R3) had clear short- and long-term
career plans:
In the next few years, I want to compete in the Enterprise
Volleyball League in Taiwan. As for long term, I want to acquire
a teaching qualification or to become a professional coach. (R3)
In comparison, Henri (R2) had shifted his focus to his
studies:
When I became a university student, I began to realise the
prospects of a korfball player were relatively limited. As such, I
thought of pursuing other alternatives, like studying. I want
more time to do other things in university. (R2)
Salena (R4) demonstrated somewhat different career plan-
ning experiences in her dual career development:
I want to focus more on my studies. However, if I cannot excel
in my academic results and get a good job, I don't know what I
can do in the future. I know I can't earn a living playing tug-of-
war, but I am presently training full-time and have no time to
carefully plan my future. (R4)
In connection with ESAs' career aims, their identities and
roles shift according to their experience at different stages of
their dual career development. Athletic identity was dis-
cussed by Brewer, Van Raalte, and Linder (1993). They
stated that this related to the degree to which an individual
identifies with their athletic role. In this regard, Bel (R6)
expressed that her personal identity shifted more toward her
student identity when she was in her first year of university:
Back then, I would try my best to maintain my role as a student.
Despite the fact that I needed to spend a great deal of time on
swimming, I still saw myself as a student. In fact, I still see
myself as a student, as I tend to put even more effort in my
studies. (R6)
Bel (R6) added that her roles had clashed when she was in
secondary school:
The class might not be able to accommodate you, and some
might even label you as "those who are falling behind." In fact,
my secondary school would sort students into different classes
according to their abilities. Some classes were packed with top
athletes, for example. So the sense of being labeled was quite
strong. I did not face much difficulty with swimming in and of
itself, but I did feel the clash between my two roles as student
and as athlete. This included a clash in the social aspect. (R6)
Echoing Bel (R6), Yvonne (R1) shared that her athletic and
academic roles conflicted:
I led a routine and repetitive life when I was training in the
national team. I did not like their way of training. I preferred my
Figure 1. Different levels of social-ecological determinants.
6 SAGE Open
school life because I had more freedom. However, I needed to
obey the routines of the national team. Otherwise, I would be
kicked out from the national team. (R1)
In terms of character, self-efficacy, and motivation,
Yvonne (R1) claimed that with her sports skills, she was able
to demonstrate proper form during physical education (PE)
lessons in front of her classmates:
Yes . . . I do a better job at PE lessons than others and I am able
to learn new sports faster than others. This makes me confident
of myself. (R1)
As one of the Hong Kong team members who broke the 4 ×
100 m relay Asian record, Hardy (R7) affirmed his capabilities
in his track training compared positively over his counterparts:
I think I am much stronger and have greatly improved my
performance in exercises like dumbbell lifting in the gym. When
I checked out some videos online, however, I found that some
people in the West can effortlessly achieve what I strove very
hard to do. I do think they enjoy some natural advantages over
us.As a runner, however, I firmly believe that I can make a name
for myself, at least in Asia, if I go for it. (R7)
The ESAs had a strong personal motivation to strive for
perfection. This could be a prominent determinant in their
dual career development (Aghdasi, 2014). The ESAs' char-
acter also included commitment, dedication, being hard-
working and driven, versatility, and ability (Miller, Homan,
& Miniutti, 2006). Moreover, to motivate ESAs to persevere
in their dual career, ESAs' problem-solving abilities and
achievement can motivate them to continue in their challeng-
ing dual career lives. Snow (R5) contended,
From being a nobody to getting into a national team and competing
in five competitions a year, this then all went back to zero when I
had to concentrate on my studies. I am the kind of athlete who
needs to train a lot to gain progress. So I did think of quitting
swimming after secondary school. I had repeated my F5 year and
attempted the public examination twice. I had left the national
team and then rejoined it. However, I still find it rewarding. The
medals that I have earned are not just pieces of silverware, but
they also give me a sense of accomplishment. (R5)
Despite the fact that diligent elite athletes were more
likely to plan for their future career because they set higher
goals and are more confident (Demulier, Le Scanff, &
Stephan, 2013), Burlot, Richard, and Joncheray (2016, p. 14)
stated that elite athletes prioritized different activities while
striving to maintain a balance between themselves and the
different social worlds in which they interact.
Micro-Level Determinants
Micro-level determinants include a multitude of professionals
and stakeholders (Bronfenbrenner, 1994), such as ESAs'
coaches, teammates, parents, siblings, PE teachers, other teach-
ers, alumni, seniors, and classmates that ESAs interact with.
Over the course of ESAs' dual career, coaches were not
only the "significant others" who reinforced athletes' psy-
chological and physical investment in the sports role (Stephan
& Brewer, 2007), but they also influenced them at every
stage of their career decision.
Young (R3) vividly remembered that
. . . my coach in junior high school taught me everything from
the very beginning and helped me to lay the foundation for my
future career. He not only taught me volleyball but also lessons
about life. (R3)
In contrast, Bel (R6) had a different experience with her
coaches:
As to time allocation for studies and sports, they [coaches]
would not comment much. Back in secondary school, my then
coach would not even care about my attendance at training.
However, I did have a coach who was dictatorial and would tell
me to swim more. (R6)
When Snow (R5) identified influential figures in her
career development, she expressed that her coach was quite
democratic:
My foreign coach was my influential figure. He was rather laid-
back. If I did not feel like swimming, he would not push me to
do so. However, the decision to join the national team was
actually made by both of us. (R5)
This reflects findings from previous research, which
claimed that ESAs began their careers during their adoles-
cent years and through the encouragement of others, such as
coaches and parents (Allison & Meyer, 1988).
Teammates were also an important determinant for ESAs'
decision to stay with the team. Henri (R2) and Salena (R4)
confirmed this, stating,
My teammates gave me guidance on future career planning, the
benefit of korfball, and how to better perform in my studies.
(R2)
My teammates--they make me stay in this team. (R4)
In addition, parental influence on competitive youth
sports socialization has received considerable attention
(Holt, Tamminen, Black, Sehn, & Wall, 2008; Wuerth, Lee,
& Alfermann, 2004). ESAs' parents may be agents to assist
or resist their dual career development. Based on the devel-
opmental model (Wylleman & Lavallee, 2004), parents may
likely be the most influential group for ESAs. One typical
experience was shared by Henri (R2):
At the start, they (my parents) did not support me in pursuing
korfball. They did not think that playing korfball can be a career.
Sum et al. 7
Later on, when I went to Holland, they began to realise that
korfball could be a springboard for better development. Now,
they give me verbal encouragement, but I do feel that, in their
heart, they do not really support my decision. (R2)
With the full support of parents, ESAs can extract their
potential both in athletics and academics. Young (R3)
stressed that his parents had done a lot to support him:
My biggest supporters are my parents . . . they are not athletes.
They will always stand by me because volleyball is what I am
interested in. My parents will come to watch every game I play.
They take photos at my games to keep a record of my growth at
every stage. When I suffer an injury, they take care of me. I share
all the happenings in school with them. (R3)
Conversely, Kennard (R8) received no support from his
parents:
I have often been frustrated. My parents did not like that I played
basketball. They thought that basketball was a waste of time and
that it affected my studies. Actually, I did not study well before
I played basketball. Before I began to do well at basketball
competitions, I often felt upset because I had to bear the pressure
from both my studies and training. I was at a loss. (R8)
Parental involvement substantially contributes to ESAs'
affective experience of sport participation both positively and
negatively (Knight, Neely, & Holt, 2011). In particular, parents
can affect their children's enjoyment or anxiety about their
sport participation (Anderson, Funk, Elliott, & Smith, 2003).
Studies on siblings'influence on elite athletes'dual career
development is lacking. This study revealed that siblings'
support can be a determinant that affects ESAs' dual career
development. Hardy (R7) demonstrated this claim:
I did not get much financial support from my parents. I was in
great need of money from Form 2 to Form 6 for both my studies
and training. It was my elder brother who sponsored me during
that period. (R7)
Separately, Hardy (R7) had experienced negative feed-
back from other subject teachers. He disclosed,
A teacher at my school once told me that I should give up
running and concentrate on my studies because I would never
achieve remarkable results like one of my seniors did. I turned a
deaf ear to the teacher and kept on practicing. We met again
when I became a successful athlete a few years later. The teacher
admitted that he was wrong. (R7)
Physical education teachers were significant in positively
influencing ESAs' dual career development. Salena (R4)
stated that
My teacher in junior high school made me realise that my
abilities in tug-of-war can get me admitted into a good senior
high school. He was a PE teacher, not a coach for a specific
sport. However, he was interested in tug-of-war as a sport, so he
traveled around to learn about it and came back to teach us. (R4)
In addition, PE teachers can also play crucial roles in
helping ESAs' dual career development in terms of counsel-
ing them to achieve excellence in their chosen sport and pro-
vide additional support, such as injury prevention and
physical training and conditioning (Sum & Ma, 2014).
Meso-Level Determinants
Meso-level determinants refer to two or more micro-level
interrelated determinants that influence ESAs at the meso-
level (Bronfenbrenner, 1994; Figure 1). In most cases, there
were two determinants that interacted together. Indeed,
Yvonne (R1) stated,
In my high school, I was allowed to take a "make-up" exam with
a consensus reached between my coach and my subject teachers
. . . My teacher set another paper for me to have an exam . . .
Other student athletes were also allowed to take "make-up"
exams if they had to compete during the exam season. Teachers
would give necessary assistance in our studies after training. We
were free to join these after-class study sections. (R1)
Coaches and subject teachers can facilitate ESAs' dual
career development. A typical case of this was expressed by
Young (R3):
An arrangement was made by the coach and other subject
teachers of the school. They planned for us to study together for
about an hour a day. (R3)
This positive interaction between parents and coaches is
crucial for ESAs' athletic and academic achievement. Hardy
(R7) asserted that
My coach once advised me that I should assure my parents that
I can work hard at both my studies and sports. I followed what
he said and let my parents know my coach's expectations,
sharing with them my progress in my studies and my sport.
Later on, when I won prizes at competitions, my parents began
to feel proud of me. They started to talk about my achievements
in running. (R7)
Vella, Oades, and Crowe (2010) commented that a posi-
tive relationship and good communication between coach
and parents can provide ESAs with a healthy environment to
develop their dual career. In particular, parents' attitudes and
behavior are associated with ESAs' perceptions of their abil-
ity, positive and negative effect, motivation orientation, atti-
tudes toward and attraction to sport participation (Brustad
et al., 2001; Fredricks & Eccles, 2004).
Because all the ESAs had studied in high schools and uni-
versities while simultaneously training as elite athletes, PE
8 SAGE Open
teachers, alumni, seniors, and classmates play significant
roles in assisting them in their career growth in the school
environment. Henri (R2) stated,
My PE teacher led me into this field. My classmates also played
a part and I was influenced by them. Seniors and alumni of the
team were always very supportive of my studies and sport. They
always meet together with a mission to improve the sports
culture of the school. (R2)
Deliberately finding a workable balance among meso-
level determinants such as coaches, subject teachers, parents,
PE teachers, alumni, seniors, and classmates may lead ESAs
to excel academically (such as graduating with a degree) as
well as achieve highly in athletic performance (Simiyu,
2010).
Exo-Level Determinants
The exo-level comprises social structure, activities, and pro-
cesses in two or more settings (Bronfenbrenner, 1994), such
as government, financial, policy, academic, medical, and
parent-teacher association (Figure 1), which affect ESAs in
their immediate environment. Yvonne (R1) stressed how the
government, policies, and financial support affected her dual
career development:
The school waives the miscellaneous fee for student athletes,
which means that we only have to pay the tuition fee. XXX is a
private school and is much more expensive than the public ones.
In addition, we can apply to the government for scholarships
when we win titles in games. The government offers big
incentives to native Taiwanese athletes like me. (R1)
Special academic admission schemes tailor-made for
ESAs were evident in Yvonne's (R1) case:
There are also favorable offers in admission tests. After gaining
some certificates, athletes can be admitted into high school or
university with scores lower than the common standard. Some
universities also have a specific track for athlete admission. Student
athletes have to pass theTaiwan college entrance exam as well as an
athletic performance exam such as a Taekwondo test. (R1)
In terms of medical determinants, Henri (R2) stated that
I would find the athletic trainers in the infirmary first. If it is a
serious injury, they would send me to the hospital at once. There
is a collaborating Orthopaedic Hospital right beside my school.
(R2)
In Hong Kong, as a Special Administration Region (SAR)
in China, there is a parent­teacher association in almost
every secondary school. In the focus group interview, ESAs
expressed that the parent­teacher association gave them a
negative impression because they always appeared to push
students to study. However, Bel (R6) expressed a different
view:
Unlike other parent-teacher associations, meetings are held
periodically for the development of students, particularly
schools with a long tradition of sports development. The
association arranges training and sponsors some sport equipment
for ESAs. (R6)
Snow (R5) echoed that
My school does not have enough budget to operate its parent-
teacher association. The activities are low-cost ones, like book
recycling and selling of second-hand school uniforms to ESAs
in need of them. (R5)
There is no official parent­teacher association in Taiwan.
Regarding full tuition waiver in private schools in Taiwan,
Henri (R2) disclosed that
The parents of private schools are usually very wealthy and
more generous with donations to the school. The principal finds
sponsorship from parents. A Parent Fund is formed accordingly
for ESAs who are not as wealthy to apply. (R2)
Consistent with the holistic athletic career model
(Wylleman, Reints, & De Knop, 2013), ESAs experienced a
combination of elite sports and higher education academic
challenges, as well as financial development with family and
government determinants in their dual career development,
at the exo-level.
Macro-Level Determinants
The macro-level forms the social structure and activities in
the micro-, meso-, and exo-levels (Bronfenbrenner, 1994).
The macro-level determinants comprise the relationship
between attitudes, norms, values, beliefs, resources, and cul-
ture (Figure 1). These determinants influence ESAs within
the different levels to make decisions on their dual career
development. We sought the ESAs' perspectives on how
macro-level determinants influence their attitudes, norms,
values, and beliefs. In this regard, Snow (R5) shared her
experience:
I find that XXXX University respects my decisions. XXXX
University would expect athletes to perform well, and that is
also my goal. XXXX University shares my values, as they
would want me to represent Hong Kong to take part in games
like Universiade Games and do well there. That is also what I
am aiming for. (R5)
Bel (R6) shared further,
My school places an all-rounded development as their core
value. This is a great source of motivation to me. I therefore try
Sum et al. 9
hard to do well in both sports and academics. My values are
aligned with that of my school. (R6)
In contrast, Henri (R2) shared his experience in partici-
pating in a nonfocus sport identified by the university. He
expressed that
The dean and the teachers of the faculty wanted to cut the
number of recommended korfball players in the university as
korfball was not a focus sport in the university. I felt a bit
embarrassed when they talked with us about this. (R2)
Uneven funding allocated to focus and nonfocus sports
seemed a normal practice that affects the support of ESAs'
for training and competition. Young (R3) studied at the same
university as Henri (R2). He had the following claims:
It is normal that a larger part of the subsidy is given to players of
popular sports. It is the university's responsibility to help those less
popular sports teams to raise funds using its social connections. (R3)
Regarding how institutions value ESAs in athletic and
academic performance, and in return to benefit the institu-
tions, Hardy (R7) expressed that
For me, I felt that I was protected and cared for. In return, I
would like to contribute to the good of my school. For example,
I would see if I can do anything to help with the school track and
field team, and with other students. (R7)
Kennard (R8) echoed that
XXX College value my contribution. I am glad that the principal
knows me, and I was given a chance when I failed in the public
examination. I think they [the college] appreciate me. I can feel
that they have high expectations of both my academic studies
and my performance at competitions. I think they have a good
impression of me. (R8)
Morgan (2001) affirmed that student athletes will be more
content when there is congruence between an individual and
their learning environment. As such, when student athletes
perceived their learning environment to be more supportive
of their academic and social needs, they tended to have an
above-average academic performance compared with the
normal student population (Kuh, Cruce, Shoup, Kinzie, &
Gonyea, 2008; Umbach, Palmer, Kuh, & Hannah, 2006;
Yusof, Chuan, & Shah, 2013).
In accordance with the above, ESAs enjoy sufficient
resources both from their athletic and academic institutions.
Hardy (R7) stressed that the government has increased its
support a lot after some national level medals were won in
some focus sports:
The support can only be given to athletes with existing
achievements. An example can be found in the East Asian Games.
At the time, basketball and football enjoyed great support from the
government because they won medals in the Games. Afterwards,
they were given very good venues and other resources, which
significantly helped progress their performance. (R7)
In academic institutions, Snow (R5) and Hardy (R7) con-
tended that
XXXX University has a lot of decent resources to support
athletes. But most of their scholarships take your family's
financial situation into account. (R5)
XXX [school] did invest a lot in sports facilities. XXX is very
well-equipped. It invested a lot in sports resources. (R7)
In terms of academic support, Salena (R4) expressed that
We had extra English tutoring sections after training in high
school. Our school sent an experienced English teacher to help
us improve our English. Our school also emphasised Maths
education. In XXXX, we have foreign teachers to teach us
English. (R4)
ESAs may be deeply influenced by the institutions where
they are being socialized. Hardy (R7) remarked that
Self-confidence is part of the XXX [school] culture. A XXX
student always knows what he wants. We dedicate ourselves to
specific fields, academic studies or other areas, to manifest our
value. In XXX, many students have been brought up for specific
life goals from a very young age. Thanks to their goal-based
trajectory, many of them succeed in realising their goals. This is
possibly a justifiable reason behind the self-confidence of the
XXX people. (R7)
As culture is generally shared distinctive attitudes,
norms, beliefs, values, and resources of members among
their group, Stambulova et al. (2009, p. 406) affirmed that
"culture specific approaches should be encouraged to make
career development and transition studies more socio-
culturally informed."
Chrono-Level Determinants
Chrono-level denotes that ESAs' dual career development
changes over time (Bronfenbrenner, 1994), which affects
their access to athletic and/or academic careers. From the
results of this study, some "significant others" at the micro-
level played important roles at the beginning of ESAs' dual
career development. However, as time goes by, they seemed
to have less of an influence on ESAs' lives.
Bel (R6) recalled that her parents' roles were diminishing:
My parents' roles are less important nowadays. That could be
caused by the fact that I am swimming less now that I am in
university. We were closer when I was in secondary school, and
10 SAGE Open
they have been respectful of my opinions since I was young.
When it comes to decision making, I did successfully convince
them to let me go my way on a few occasions. However, for
most of the time, I would simply follow my parents' directions.
I am after all quite an obedient child, and would respect their
opinions, too. (R6)
Similar to this is the perception of coaches' roles. Salena
(R4) reflected that
Normally, we follow what our coaches say.We seldom challenged
our coaches when we were younger. After we entered university,
however, we were more likely to retort. (R4)
Apart from the above, Wylleman and Lavallee (2004)
stated that to remain at an elite level during a long career
development period until termination, ESAs not only invest
at different levels of physical, social, and financial determi-
nants, but also in their close environment with parents,
coaches, peers, and teachers. Student athletes are required to
cope with changes within the social environment at the ter-
tiary level, which strongly differ from those at the secondary
level (Wylleman & Lavallee, 2004).
Conclusion
Findings concerning the social-ecological determinants of
athletes' dual career development are revealed at different
levels of the ecological system (Bronfenbrenner, 1977,
1994). Concerning the main research question--How do
social-ecological determinants affect ESAs' lives and career
development?--in spite of the fact that career aims, identi-
ties, roles, characters, self-efficacy, and motivation are indi-
vidual determinants, ESAs' coaches and parents play a
significant role (Sheridan, Coffee, & Lavallee, 2014) at
micro- and meso-levels. Also, available resources, such as
government support, financial assistance, academic, and
medical care, can be found at an exo-level. However, how
ESAs develop their dual career is highly dependent on their
institutional culture at a macro-level. Finally, the chrono-
level, encompassing the interrelationship of different levels
of determinants including critical incidents that emerge in an
ESA's life, emphasizes that career development of each tran-
sitional stage may be varied.
Through employing ecological systems theory
(Bronfenbrenner, 1977, 1994) as a theoretical framework, this
study has explored how social-ecological determinants affect
ESAs'lives and career development. The explorations under-
taken in this study have contributed to understanding of the
culturally specific experiences of ESAs in the context of
Taiwan and Hong Kong.
