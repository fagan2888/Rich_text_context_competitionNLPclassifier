The value of sponsorship-linked marketing is brought into
question when false recognition of foils suggests confusion
regarding true sponsors. While an indicator of confusion,
recognition false alarms do not tell the entire story regarding
memory for sponsor­event relationships. In two experiments
using press release announcements about sponsored events,
free recall results show relatively good memory for spon-
sors, and that under certain conditions, the mention of direct
competitors can actually facilitate recall of true sponsors and
events. The findings point to the importance of understand-
ing the memory-based characteristics of measurement as
well as to the memory-supported decision-making tasks that
sponsorship information might eventually influence. Need-
less to say, these findings also raise several interesting future
research questions. In particular, the findings suggest a role
in sponsorship-linked communications for "episodic-seman-
tic constellations" that may naturally arise as exposure to
sponsorship-linked communications is combined with
semantic knowledge.
Marketing practitioners, in response to increasingly
fragmented media markets, are rapidly evolving a set of
marketing communication strategies that have been labeled
indirect marketing (Cornwell, 2008). These indirect market-
ing communications are typically embedded in consumer
experiences and include sponsorship of sports and events;
brand placement in programs, movies, and computer games;
ambient marketing; and various forms of electronic
communication (de Pelsmacker & Neijens, 2012). Of these,
sponsorship currently takes the largest share of communica-
tions spending, at more than 48 billion US dollar in 2011
(International Events Group, 2011). Moreover, this figure
most likely underestimates the importance of sponsorship in
attempting to reach consumers because it does not include
the traditional advertising and promotion that is themati-
cally tied to sponsorship. Given that marketers expect that
consumer awareness is influenced by sponsorship commu-
nications, and that marketers also believe that image and
goodwill toward their brand can be influenced by learning
about sponsor­event relationships, we need to understand
how consumers remember these communications.
Unfortunately, in this loosely coupled relationship between
event and brand, confusion may arise. Indeed, the business
press is awash with disconcerting reports of sponsor mis-
identification. The objectives of this article are to examine
how it is that memory confusion is currently addressed in
the sponsorship literature, to learn what is typically held in
memory, and to consider the influence of competitive men-
tions on recall for sponsorship relationships.

Abstract
Corporate sponsorship value is brought into question when false recognition of foils suggests confusion regarding true
sponsors.While an indicator of confusion,recognition false alarms do not tell the entire story regarding memory for sponsor-
event relationships. Two free recall experiments show relatively good memory for sponsors and also that under certain
conditions, the mention of direct competitors can actually facilitate recall of true sponsors and events.The findings point to
the importance of understanding the memory-based characteristics of measurement as well as to the memory-supported
decision-making tasks that sponsorship information might eventually influence.

comprehensive review; rather the studies were selected to
demonstrate the range of memory measures in use, to
document the nature of memory for these communications,
and to explore the relationship between memory measure-
ment and memory findings. Table 1 will be a reference for
the following sections.
Ambushing
One of the most important strategic sources of potential
confusion in sponsoring is ambushing by another company,
oftentimes a direct competitor. Sandler and Shani (1989)
defined ambushing as the efforts of an organization to asso-
ciate itself with an event in the hope of reaping the benefits
of an official sponsor. The success of ambushing attempts in
terms of outcome variables of interest (e.g., awareness of
ambusher brand stemming from the ambushing activity),
although richly discussed in the business press and academic
writings, offers less in terms of clear empirical support.
Many field studies do not have adequate control over expo-
sure to allow ambushing to be documented as the source of
memory confusion. Table 1 offers two experimental studies
of the memory effects from ambushing advertisements.
Kinney and McDaniel (1996) pitted early sponsorship-
linked advertising for the true sponsor of the Olympics
against actual ambusher advertising by direct competitors.
Their findings demonstrated that sponsors (with a clear
Olympic association) and ambushers (with an implied
Olympic association) were equally well recalled and ascribed
as sponsors. In their research, study participants were not
made aware within the experiment of the true sponsorship
status, thus participants were easily duped by marketing
communications into believing that the ambushers were true
sponsors.
Humphreys, Cornwell, et al. (2010) examined the mem-
ory effects of counterambushing communications. On one
hand, transgressed true sponsors are known to invoke a
"name and shame" strategy (Farrelly, Quester, & Greyser,
2005) to discredit ambushers; on the other hand, Cornwell,
Weeks, and Roy (2005) have suggested that the often whim-
sical and fun nature of ambushing may lead to positive affect
for ambushers and potentially distinctive memories.
Importantly, counterambushing messages are an additional
instance when links between the event and the ambusher are
communicated. Humphreys, Cornwell, et al. found that
counterambushing communications, after a short delay,
worked to improve the memory of the relationship between
the event and the ambusher. It is possible that the gist of
who's who (ambusher or sponsor) was lost and the relation-
ship of the event to the ambushing brand was strengthened.
Ambushing is a strategic activity that holds many interesting
memory questions. It is perhaps less worrisome to marketers,
however, given current legislative protection for true spon-
sors, than is simple confusion.
False Recognition
One phenomenon of consistent interest in studies of spon-
sorship is that of false recognition. Although perhaps not
discussed as false recognition, many studies have docu-
mented the tendency of sponsorship audiences to recognize
foils as sponsors (see Table 1). For example, in a study set in
a motor sport context, Quester's (1997) use of what she
referred to as pre­post aided recall (asking if a list of brands
were event sponsors) showed foils with awareness levels
sometimes surpassing those of true sponsors. Interestingly,
nonsponsoring brands Castrol motor oil and Fuji film not
only had high recognition as sponsors initially (67% and
42%) but also retained these levels after the passage of the
event (63% and 41%). Notably, these foil brands were direct
competitors of true sponsors: Agip (motor lubricant) event
sponsor and Kodak (film) sponsor­supplier. At the same
time, respondents were able to identify true sponsors of the
event as well or better than foils in some instances after the
event (Regional government sponsor 85%, Agip 46%, and
Kodak 46%). An important point to note for the current
research is that simply because a foil congruent with the
event may be falsely recognized as a sponsor does not neces-
sarily indicate destructive interference for recognition of
true sponsors for an event. In fact, there is substantial evi-
dence in recognition research that destructive interference
does not occur (Dyne, Humphreys, Bain, & Pike, 1990;
Metcalfe, 1990).
This tendency to falsely recognize competing brands as
sponsors is presumably driven in part by similarity between
competing brands. Given that brands such as Powerade and
Gatorade are consumed in a similar way, for a similar pur-
pose, and marketed in conjunction with similar events, is it
any wonder that consumers might mistake one for the other
when asked about their sponsorship of an event? To suggest
that brand parity is leading to brand confusion would not be
new (Clancy & Trout, 2002); however, simple similarity of
brands per se has not been investigated in the literature on
sponsorship. In addressing the communication challenge
posed by brand similarity, the broader marketing and adver-
tising literature is fragmented with many contextually spe-
cific studies, for example, similarity due to comparative
advertising (Gorn & Weinberg, 1984), similarity related to
perceptions of brand origin (Loken, Ross, & Hinkle, 1986),
and similarity due to inferences about service providers
(Matta & Folkes, 2005). In this instance, for communication
contexts such as sponsorship and brand placement, prior lit-
erature has not identified the range of variables that might be
relevant and the paradigms that might be applied to

Bennett (1999), Interviews
conducted before and after a
soccer match outside stadia
Sponsor awareness on exit was
based on a measure of free
recall for "any firms or brands
advertised on perimeter
posters." Subsequently,
awareness was cued by product
category and then by a "fully
aided" cue, which asked if
attendees recalled specific
brands (including foils).
Depending on the regularity of
attendance, recall of sponsors
ranged from 0% to 26% and
fully aided memory of specific
brands ranged from 8% to 88%.
Claimed recall for foils was low
(3% to 6%).
While the measures taken
on exit were discussed as
"unprompted," they were
collected outside the stadia
directly following the conclusion
of games.

 Aided awareness or recognition

Aided awareness or recognition
measures found that foils were
incorrectly identified by as high
as 65% of respondents.

Tripodi, Hirons, Bednall, and
Sutherland (2003),Telephone
survey prior to the Sydney
Olympics using different
approaches to memory
measurement
Respondents were asked one
of the following cued recall
questions: (a) "When you think
of [Event Z], which sponsors
come to mind? (b) "When
you think of [Brand X], what
sponsorships come to mind? (c)
"When you think of [Category
Y, for example, banks] what
sponsorships come to mind?"
and then a recognition question
(d) I am going to tell you some
of Brand X's current or recent
sponsorships. For each one,
could you tell me whether you
were aware, before today, of
Brand X sponsoring that event?
A total of 32% of people
in the "event sponsorship
prompt" group recalled the
target sponsor, whereas only
16% of people in the "brand
sponsorship prompt" group
recalled the event when the
recognition prompt further
supported memory for the
correct sponsor, particularly for
those in the "brand sponsorship
prompt" group (49%).
The target sponsor was the
smallest of four large banks
known to sponsor sport events
and this may have contributed
to the lower recall with the
brand prompt. It should be
noted that participants in the
brand sponsorship prompt
group where only given the
brand and asked to recall the
event.
Participants were assigned to
one of three conditions (event
sponsorship prompt; brand
sponsorship prompt; category
sponsorship prompt). Each
condition included a series of
questions

Wakefield, Becker-Olsen, and
Cornwell (2007), Survey
collected prior to baseball game
at end of season
Respondents were shown a list
of brands and foils and were
asked if each was an actual
sponsor. Half of the participants
were cued with the size
and location of the sponsor
communications (e.g., concourse
walls, left field).
Overall prominent and related
brands were correctly identified
as sponsors 70% of the time
whereas prominent and related
foils were incorrectly identified
as sponsors in 57% of the
responses. Cueing tended
to reduce accuracy for all
sponsors but particularly anchor
sponsors.
Although termed recall this is a
recognition measure.

understand the memory of these simple yet complexly
embedded communications.
Measure of Memory for Sponsorship
Most past studies of memory for sponsorship communica-
tion have employed cued or aided recall (see Table 1). One
study specifically considering the variation in cueing is that
of Tripodi, Hirons, Bednall, and Sutherland (2003). Using
telephone survey data collected about the time of the 2000
Olympics, they considered four approaches to measuring
recall: (a) event sponsorship prompt ("When you think of
[Event Z], which sponsors come to mind?"), (b) brand
sponsorship prompt ("When you think of [Brand X], what
sponsorships come to mind?"), (c) category sponsorship
prompt ("When you think of [Category Y, for example,
bands] what sponsorships come to mind?") and (d) brand
recognition recall ("I am going to tell you some of Brand
X's current or recent sponsorships. For each one, could you
tell me whether you were aware, before today, of Brand X
sponsoring that event?"). Not surprisingly, Tripodi et al.
found that these different approaches to measurement
yielded different estimates of memory. Free recall was not
utilized but had it been, one could only suspect it too would
have yielded yet a different picture of memory.
An example of a study using free recall is that of Bennett
(1999) who measured consumer awareness of sponsorship
information, both before and after the viewing of a soccer
6 SAGE Open
match. On exit, awareness was based on a measure of free
recall for "any firms or brands advertised on perimeter post-
ers" (Bennett, 1999, p. 301). Subsequently, awareness was
cued by product category and then by a "fully aided" cue
(which transformed the task into a recognition task). That is,
attendees were presented with specific brands (including
foils) and asked which ones they recalled (recognized). Note
that the initial task is classified as free recall study in that no
explicit cues for individual brands were supplied. However,
a cue was provided in that participants were asked to recall
brands and firms and the general context of the sporting
event may have also served as a cue. In a very different
approach, Johar and Pham (1999) utilized an open-ended
sure recall measure following exposure to press release
sponsorship announcements. With each participant reading
four press releases followed by a rating task and a filler task,
participants were cued with the event for the sponsor. In this
task, 32% reported feeling sure that they recalled the sponsor
and 56% of these had indeed identified the true sponsor.
Although the studies in Table 1 show a great deal of vari-
ety in measurement, several empirical consistencies can be
identified. First, when recognition measures are utilized
(consider Johar, Pham, & Wakefield, 2006; Quester, 1997;
Wakefield, Becker-Olsen, & Cornwell, 2007), there is huge
potential for foils to be identified as sponsors. This is most
likely due to what Johar et al. (2006) called "general plausi-
bility" of named brands as sponsors (p. 190). In contrast,
research using recall measures finds very little spontaneous
interference from nonsponsors (Bennett, 1999; Grohs,
Wagner, & Vsetecka, 2004). This is the case even when these
nonsponsors are direct competitors active in the field envi-
ronment (Oakes, 2003) or presented for the study in an
experimental context (Cornwell, Humphreys, Maguire,
Weeks, & Tellegen, 2006). Finally, and important to the cur-
rent research, is the fact that oftentimes good recognition of
true sponsors is found at the same time as high incorrect rec-
ognition of foils (Johar et al., 2006; Quester, 1997; Wakefield,
Becker-Olsen, & Cornwell, 2007).
The Assumption of Destructive Interference
It is safe to say that the standard assumption in research on
sponsorship communications is that competitive mentions
are problematic. This assumption is often accompanied by
another subtler theoretical one that assumes that memories
overwrite. That is, if you learn more about the competitor
you will forget more about the sponsor. Evidence for
destructive interference in the basic memory literature is
actually quite weak and finding it depends on the task used
(recognition vs. recall). Recent research suggests that mem-
ory errors that could be interpreted as errors induced by
interference might rather be described as a failure to access
a particular bit of information (Humphreys, Tangen et al.
2010). Given a different cue, or in a different context, a cor-
rect response may be available (Tulving & Pearlstone,
1966). In recall, when two targets come to be subsumed
under the same cue, such as when an event associated with
a sponsor is also then associated with a competitor, a person
may report the competitor not the sponsor when asked about
event sponsorship. The issue that occupied early researchers
in psychology was whether this "mistake" occurred because
learning the association between a cue and a new word
caused the "unlearning" of the prior association or whether
the participant was confused as to which of the two alterna-
tives was correct (Barnes & Underwood, 1959). Using recall
tasks, evidence was found for both positions, though the
evidence for confusion is stronger (Postman & Stark, 1969).
More recently it has been shown that at the time of retrieval,
the two targets subsumed under a cue can block each other
so that neither is produced (Humphreys, Tehan, O'Shea, &
Bolland, 2000). Postman and Starks's (1969) evidence for
"unlearning" does not discriminate between destructive
interference and this type of response competition. The evi-
dence for interference when memory was tested by recogni-
tion, however, was equivocal.
Ideas about recognition being a matching operation in
which the recognition response is driven by a calculation of
the similarity between the "to-be-recognized" item and the
contents of memory led Dyne et al. (1990) to reexamine the
role of associative interference in recognition. Using very
similar tasks, they showed that associative interference had
differential effects on cued recall and pair recognition. That
is, they showed that associating the same cue with two dif-
ferent responses hurt recall but increased both the hit rate
(correct identification of old items) and the false alarm rate
(false recognition of new items) in recognition. Dyne et al.
did not address the situation where a similar cue is associated
with the same item (e.g., a competitor is also associated with
the event); however, Metcalfe (1990) analyzed this situation
from a theoretical perspective, which was essentially the
same as the Dyne et al. perspective. On the basis of the
Metcalfe analysis (also see Humphreys, Pike, Bain, & Tehan,
1989), it seems likely that Dyne et al.'s findings will also
apply to the situation where two similar cues are associated
with the same item. This in turn applied to sponsorship sug-
gests that in recognition, the association of a similar com-
petitor of the sponsor to an event is likely to increase the
probability of identifying the competitor and the sponsor as
being associated with the event. Thus, in recognition, the
probability of being able to discriminate between the sponsor
and its similar competitor is reduced. At the same time, in
cued recall, a presented competitor can be expected to result
in interference if recall of the sponsor is cued with the event.
Further evidence against destructive interference comes
from a short-term cued recall paradigm by Tehan and
Humphreys (1996). These researchers showed that interfer-
ence occurred when the cue subsumed both the target and the
interfering item but not when it only subsumed the target.
If sponsorship is examined by free recall, there are also
task-based characteristics at work. For example, premature
Cornwell et al. 7
cessation of recall (i.e., stopping further recall attempts once
one item has been recalled) is less likely to occur in free
recall than in cued recall. Therefore, interference found in
cued recall studies is less likely because the participant will
not stop recalling when an alternative is found. However, it
is true that in free recall, the recall of one member of a cate-
gory tends to reduce the probability of recalling other mem-
bers from that category (for discussion of how remembering
can cause forgetting see Anderson, Bjork, & Bjork, 1994).
Thus, the recall of one brand (either sponsor or competitor)
may reduce the probability of recalling the other.
The gist of this basic memory research for sponsorship is
that many popular measurement approaches may suggest
high levels of destructive interference. For example, forced-
choice recognition studies may look like destructive interfer-
ence but a different picture may emerge with yes/no
recognition measurement where the hit rate and the false
alarm rate allow a more straightforward examination of
memory. Furthermore, with recall, the results may depend on
whether cued recall or free recall is used. Thus, the approach
to measurement is decidedly important.
The Possibility of Role Reversal
In contrast to the destructive view, there are at least three
ways a competitive mention might improve memory for the
true sponsor. First, the presentation of an event and related
sponsors and their competitors may be organized into a cat-
egory (e.g., Olympic-type alliances). Second, the competitor
may serve during recall as another retrieval cue. Third, dur-
ing the encoding process, one may pay more attention to the
true sponsor when a competitor is present. Each of these
possibilities will be discussed in turn.
Organization and categorization. Studies of the organization
of memory have shown that materials having some provided
structure (e.g., words from a category such as a fish, an insect)
result in associative clustering in memory (Bousfield, Cohen,
& Whitmarsh, 1958). That is, items from the same category
tend to be recalled in adjacent output positions. There is evi-
dence that this increase in clustering and the accompanying
increase in free recall result, at least in part, from organiza-
tional processes occurring during the study. That is, Einstein
and Hunt (1980) showed that instructions to sort list items
into categories improved free recall, especially when the
organized structure of the study list was not that obvious. Pre-
sumably, what is happening is that preexisting semantic rela-
tionships combine with new episodic learning in a manner
that is not fully understood (e.g., Schwartz & Humphreys,
1973). This associative clustering not only explains organiza-
tion in memory but it is also the case that organization sup-
ports recall. While memory researchers have been primarily
interested in the organization of memory and the extent to
which individuals depend on available structure or develop
their own subjective structure (e.g., Schwartz & Humphreys,
1973; Tulving, 1962), the findings readily apply to the spon-
sorship context. If an event is named and congruent sponsors
for the event and their direct competitors are mentioned (e.g.,
marathon event, New Balance as sponsor, and Reebok as
competitor), a category of sorts may form, especially if this
information is contrasted with another, different event (e.g.,
biking event, Cannondale as sponsor, and Schwinn as com-
petitor). The juxtaposition of such information could readily
be found in a general sports magazine like Sports Illustrated.
Thus, the memory for each category and the elements in it
will be supported by preexisting associations among the ele-
ments as well as by the exposure episode.
Associates as cues. In addition to memory effects related to
exposure or study processes, memory research is also con-
cerned with processes operating at the point of recall or test.
For example, Tulving and Pearlstone (1966) provided a dem-
onstration of the power of providing category names as
retrieval cues at test. Shuell (1968) and Strand (1970) dem-
onstrated that they could selectively interfere with category
recall (the probability of recalling at least one member of a
category) and item recall (the probability of recalling a par-
ticular item from a category) given that the category label
was present as a retrieval cue. More recently, Nelson and
colleagues (Nelson, McEvoy, & Schreiber, 1990) have pro-
vided an impressive amount of evidence showing that asso-
ciatively related words can serve as effective retrieval cues
even though they were not present at study. That is to say that
if the competitor brand, Reebok, comes to mind at test, for
whatever reason, it may support recall of New Balance as the
true sponsor of a marathon.
Attending to differences. As an alternative to a new integra-
tion of semantic knowledge and episodic learning, it is pos-
sible that a competitive mention simply directs attention to
the true sponsor and thus enhances the learning of who the
true sponsor is. This is in keeping with work on similarity
judgments showing that distinctive features are helpful in
discerning between two options (Tversky, 1977). That is,
particularly in the case of ambushing, it seems reasonable
that ambushers draw attention to the designation of true
sponsor. For example, an ambusher flying a blimp over the
stadium sponsored by a direct competitor is bound to draw
attention to the true sponsor and the ambusher and poten-
tially create better recall for both and for the event itself.
While in this context, the possible role of competitive men-
tion facilitating memory is clear, it may also be complicated
by individual attitudes toward the act of ambushing. Corn-
well et al. (2006) considered the mention of direct competi-
tors within a press release and found that traditional
interference was not particularly great. They note that study
participants may have used the format of the press release to
make an inference that the particular competitor mentioned
was not the true sponsor and this clarity may have supported
memory for the true sponsor. In experimental studies, the
presence of a competitor without the role of ambusher may
simply make a person read the materials more carefully for
understanding.
In summary, we do not yet understand what is typically held
in memory from sponsorship-linked marketing communications

because we have not yet explored all of the ways that mem-
ory can be probed. Moreover, there is a need in measurement
to understand the impact of interference from competitive
mentions in general without engaging participants with
issues arising from ambushing. We will now turn to a discus-
sion of the materials developed for this study.
Design and Procedure for Experiments
For word economy, an overview of the design and procedure
for both experiments is given here and only variations from
this format introduce Experiment 2. A paradigm used by
Johar and Pham (1999; see also Pham & Johar, 2001) is
utilized in the current research. In their studies, participants
read simulated press releases naming a company and a spon-
sored event. The adaptation of this paradigm by Cornwell et
al. (2006) will also be adopted for introducing a competitor
to avoid the affectively charged issue of ambushing. While
simulated press releases offer an appealing context for the
study of sponsorship communications due to their ecological
validity (these announcements appear regularly in the busi-
ness press) and flexibility (they are easily manipulated in an
experimental setting), their construction is a complex under-
taking and will thus be described in detail.
Twelve sets of press releases were developed for the
experiment--one set for each of 12 events. All brands uti-
lized in the study were well-known international or national
brand names and all events were fictitious. Given that articu-
lation of the relationship between sponsor and event and
their congruence has been shown to influence memory
(Cornwell et al., 2006), all versions of the press release were
for a congruent sponsor­event relationship and all had an
articulating sentence that explained why this brand would
sponsor this event.
Each press release was a passage of text, four sentences
in length, announcing a sponsorship deal between a
company and event. The first sentence included the name of
the company, a brief description of the company in relation-
ship to the industry (to ensure participants were familiar
with the company's domain), and the name of the event. In
the competitor-present condition, this first sentence also
mentioned that a competitor had vied for but lost the spon-
sorship contract. The second sentence described the event.
The third and final sentence described and reinforced the
reason for the sponsorship. In each press release, the spon-
sor and event names were mentioned 3 times across the four
sentences. Every attempt was made to match the content of
the press releases within a set and across sets. For a sample
of the stimuli used in the experiment, see Table 2.
The experiment was administered via computer. At the
beginning of the experiment, participants were instructed
that they would be required to read a series of press releases
about upcoming events and their sponsors. They were
informed that each event had a unique sponsor. Participants
were not informed that they would be tested on their memory
for the sponsor­event pairings.
Each participant received 12 press releases. The press
releases for the 12 events were presented in a random order
for each participant. The version of the press release appear-
ing at exposure for each event was counterbalanced across
participants. The exposure phase was self-paced with par-
ticipants pressing the space bar following the presentation
of a press release to indicate they had finished reading the
passage of text. Following exposure, participants spent 10
min engaged in a visuospatial puzzle task, which served to
create a delay between the exposure and test phases of the
experiment, and to reduce possible rehearsal or additional
processing of the sponsorship information. In reporting the
experimental results, the recall values are discussed as prob-
abilities and stem from the raw recall in each cell of the
designs.
Experiment 1
In this free recall task, participants are asked to recall all
items in a network. As discussed, the presence of a similar
competitor might improve free recall if the competitor helps
to form a category and if it functions as a cue for other mem-
bers in a network. Thus, in free recall, an individual's recall
of a highly similar competitor may serve as a cue for the

Event Pairings in Experiments
Congruent and articulated press release with competitor: Energizer and Remote ControlVehicles Race
After a lengthy competition for sponsorship rights with Duracell, Energizer, a leading manufacturer of dry cell batteries and flashlights,
announced a 3-year sponsorship deal with the Remote ControlVehicles Race.The Remote ControlVehicles Race will be restricted
to vehicles that have been made by their controllers and should include entries of all shapes and sizes. Energizer will be providing the
batteries to power the vehicles on the day, which will demonstrate how their products "never say die," as the race will span 30 laps.
Energizer hopes this sponsorship deal will demonstrate the utility and durability of their products.
Congruent and articulated press release without competitor: Sony and Moonlight Music Festival
Yesterday, after months of intense competition among some of the most comprehensive entertainment brands in the world, Sony
announced the beginning of a 3-year sponsorship deal with the new Moonlight Music Festival.The festival will run each year in summer
and will feature a variety of rock bands playing from dusk until dawn. Sony explained that the sponsorship of the Moonlight Music
Festival is ideal, as it will strengthen the company's image of delivering quality means for entertainment. Sony is excited about the move
to target young adults and view this sponsorship opportunity as the perfect starting point.

sponsor. The competitor may also serve as a cue for the
brand category, which may in turn serve as a cue for the
sponsor and the event. It thus seems probable that the sup-
portive cueing function of the competitor, including the pos-
sibility that the presence of a competitor will increase
attention to the designation of true sponsor, would outweigh
any interfering effect of the competitor and produce net
facilitation. This prediction depends on the assumption that
the competitor and the sponsor are highly similar. Because
the brands utilized in the study were identified from industry
databases as direct competitors (e.g., BP and Shell, Kodak
and Fuji, Gatorade and Powerade, adidas and Puma), we can
assume some level of similarity, but we do not know
whether they are similar enough to produce facilitation in
free recall. Experiment 1 thus becomes a test of this similar-
ity assumption. In addition, it allows for a direct comparison
between the recall of the sponsor and recall of the competi-
tor. This experiment will allow us to learn the extent to
which sponsor and competitor information are available,
with the expectation that the presence of a direct competitor
will support recall.
Hypothesis 1: Facilitation can occur in free recall
when a similar competitor is mentioned in the press
release.
Method
Participants. Twenty participants were drawn from a paid
participant pool at a large state university. Each person par-
ticipated in an individual session, received AU$10, and
spoke English as their first language.
Design. Experiment 1 involved a within-subjects design.
Competitive mention (competitor present; competitor
absent) was the independent variable and free recall for the
sponsor, event, and competitor served as the dependent
variables.
Procedure and materials. The instructions specified that
participants were to list, in the space provided, the name of
the events that they read about in the press releases. More-
over, they were to provide the name of each event's sponsor.
If participants believed that there was an additional brand
mentioned, they were instructed to write the name of that
brand in the final space. An example was provided to illus-
trate the task requirements. Participants were instructed to
fill in as many spaces as possible, even if they had to leave
some only partially complete.
Results
The free recall probabilities for Experiment 1 are presented
in Table 3. In the competitor-present condition, the probabil-
ity of recalling the sponsor (M = .73) was significantly
greater than the probability of recalling the competitor
(M = .54), F(1, 19) = 38.96, p < .001. In addition, a greater
number of sponsors were recalled from the competitor-
present (M = .73) as opposed to the competitor-absent (M =
.58) conditions, F(1, 19) = 5.94, p < .05. Similarly, a margin-
ally greater number of event names were recalled from the
competitor-present (M = .64) as opposed to the competitor-
absent (M = .52) conditions, F(1, 19) = 4.30, p = .05.
Debriefing of study participants suggested that instructions
were easily followed.
Discussion
Overall, higher recall of the sponsor than the competitor
indicates that the sponsor was more available than the com-
petitor and/or better integrated into the associative network.
Given that the materials mention the sponsor 3 times and the
competitor only once, this is expected. Most importantly, the
predicted facilitation occurred. That is, the probability of
recalling the sponsor was higher in the competitor-present
condition as was the probability of recalling the event. This

may have happened because the presence of a similar
competitor was a good retrieval cue for the sponsor and
may even be a weak retrieval cue for the event. Thus, the
competitor's similarity to the sponsor facilitated an
episodic-semantic relationship among the elements in
memory.
This interpretation of facilitation as related to sponsor­
competitor similarity would be further enhanced if facilita-
tion could be shown not to occur when the sponsor and
competitor were less similar (e.g., if they came from differ-
ent-industry categories). In sum, categorization and associ-
ate-based cueing would be less likely to occur when an
out-of-industry competitor is mentioned in the press release.
Experiment 2 is designed to test this interpretation and thus
Hypothesis 2.
Hypothesis 2: An out-of-industry competitor will not
produce the facilitation found for a within-industry
competitor.
Experiment 2
Method
Participants. A new group of 56 participants was drawn
from the university's paid participant pool. Each person par-
ticipated in individual sessions, received AU$10, and spoke
English as their first language. Each participant was ran-
domly assigned to one of two conditions (within-industry
condition, n = 28; different-industry condition, n = 28).
Design. In each condition, participants were assigned to a
within-subjects design where competitor mention (competi-
tor present; competitor absent) was the independent variable.
In the within-industry condition, the competitor was within
the same-industry category (e.g., "Sony defeated Panasonic
in a bid for sponsorship"). In the different-industry condi-
tion, the competitor was not within the same brand category
(e.g., "Sony defeated Smirnoff in a bid for sponsorship"). In
both conditions, free recall for the sponsor, event, and com-
petitor were the dependent variables.
Procedure and materials. A different set of 12 press
releases was required for Experiment 2 so that the sponsor
and the out-of-industry competitor were congruent with the
event. Thus, there were 12 sponsors, 12 within-industry
competitors, and 12 out-of-industry competitors, each of
which was congruent with 1 of 12 events. In the within-
industry condition, each participant viewed 12 press releases
with 6 press releases having mention of a competitor within
the same brand category and 6 containing no competitive
mention. In the different-industry condition, each partici-
pant viewed 12 press releases with 6 press releases having
mention of an out-of-industry competitor and 6 having no
competitive mention. All other aspects of the procedure
were the same as in Experiment 1.
Results
Given that our experimental design resulted in a distribution
of participants to cells that is not straightforwardly analyzed
using ANOVA, t-test results are presented in the following
section. As in Experiment 1, in the competitor-present
condition, the probability of recalling the sponsor was
higher than the probability of recalling the competitor. This
result held in both the within-industry condition, t(27) = 5.76,
p < .001, Ms = .70 and .48 for the sponsor and competitor,
respectively, and the different-industry condition, t(27) =
5.86, p < .001, Ms = .65 and .37 for the sponsor and com-
petitor, respectively. Again, this was an expected finding.
Although the trend was again for greater sponsor recall in
the competitor-present condition (M = .70) over the compet-
itor-absent condition (M = .64) in the within-industry condi-
tion, the result was not significant, t(27) = 0.99, ns. In the
different-industry condition, as predicted by Hypothesis 2,
there was no facilitation effect, t(27) = 0.54, ns; Ms = .67 and
.65 for the competitor absent and present conditions, respec-
tively. Table 3 presents the free recall probabilities for
Experiment 2. While the findings support the lack of facilita-
tion in the different-industry condition, the within-industry
condition of Experiment 2 failed to replicate the finding of
facilitation from Experiment 1. An explanation for this lack
of predicted facilitation follows.
During the debriefing of Experiment 2, several partici-
pants identified three sponsors contained within the press
releases (Sony, Dolby, and Kodak) as belonging to "film and
sound" and in a sense to the same-industry category.
Although this was unexpected, it is reasonable given that
participants might have been inspired by fictitious events
such as a music festival and a film festival to form, what we
might call, an "episodic-semantic constellation." This epi-
sodic-semantic constellation is presumably similar to the use
of weakly related items to organize recall. One can observe
the use of these weak links if the items have been chosen so
that more obvious links are not present (Schwartz &
Humphreys, 1973). It was decided that a post hoc analysis
could explore the influence of an episodic-semantic constel-
lation on the results.
Post hoc analyses. In Experiment 2, as mentioned above,
the version of the press release appearing at exposure for
each event was counterbalanced across participants. For half
the participants, the press releases containing these three
sponsors (Sony, Dolby, and Kodak) appeared in the compet-
itor-present condition. For the other half of participants,
these three sponsors appeared in the competitor-absent con-
dition. As a result of the link between these sponsors and
their fictitious events, the initial recall of just one of these
sponsors might facilitate recall of one or both of the other
two, especially when no other within-industry competitor to
support sponsor recall has been provided within the original
press release (i.e., the competitor-absent condition). In other
Cornwell et al. 11
words, for some of the items, we may have inadvertently
provided an industry member that served to support sponsor
recall in the competitor-absent condition, thus weakening
our manipulation. This possibility leads to the following test-
able hypotheses:
Hypothesis 3: In the within-industry condition, the
deletion of these three items should result in a drop
in sponsor recall when the competitor is absent
compared with when the competitor is present,
resulting in significant facilitation.
Hypothesis 4: In the different-industry condition, the
deletion of these items should result in no differen-
tial change when the competitor is present and when
it is absent, resulting in no significant facilitation.
The results following the deletion of the three press
releases identified by participants as being subsumed under
the same-industry category are presented in Table 4. For
comparison purposes, the predeletion results are also pre-
sented. The results of the deletion were as predicted. For the
within-industry condition, the probability of recalling the
sponsor dropped when the competitor was absent and
remained essentially the same when the competitor was
present. The result was a significant difference in sponsor
recall as a function of whether the competitor was present or
absent, t(27) = 2.52, p < .05, M = .70 and .56, respectively.
In contrast, deletion resulted in only minimal changes in
sponsor recall in the different-industry condition. The result
was that there was still no significant difference in sponsor
recall as a function of whether the different-industry com-
petitor was present or absent, t(27) = 0.09, ns; M = .66 and
.67, respectively. Thus, an arising episodic-semantic constel-
lation had masked the predicted facilitation. Therefore, the
post hoc analysis of Experiment 2 supports the findings of
Experiment 1, namely, in free recall, the presence of a simi-
lar competitor can facilitate recall.
Final Discussion and Future Directions
These results demonstrate that contrary to popular discus-
sion of the detrimental effects of competitive mention
largely driven by studies of false recognition, competitors
can produce facilitation as well as interference. That is,
results from these free recall experiments find that competi-
tive mentions can support recall of the sponsor and event.
We can say with some confidence that memory organization
and categorization plays a role in sponsorship recall for
these materials. Both the experimental results contrasting
within the industry with different industries of competitive
mention and the post hoc analysis support the notion that
individuals form episodic-semantic constellations and that
these are used in recall. Although these findings consider
several events, the results may generalize to other aspects of
organization and categorization in sponsorship. For instance,
the nature of an event roster (or number of event sponsors)
has been examined for its potential influence on attitudes
(Ruth & Simonin, 2006), but facilitative memory effects
arising from the nature of other sponsors for an event have
not been considered. If the various sponsors for an event
form an episodic-semantic constellation that facilitates (or
does not facilitate) recall for the elements in the constella-
tion, marketers may want to know. In addition, if a consis-
tent roster of sponsors for an event were to be maintained it
could be argued that, over time, memory for the episodic-
semantic constellation could strengthen and/or become less
dependent on the specific context and thus support long-
term memory. Likewise, although the findings here are not
directly applicable to the firm's formation of a sponsorship
portfolio (e.g., the combining of various art, charity, and
sport sponsorships), the findings do suggest that the organi-
zation and categorization of sponsorship portfolios might
influence recall as well as perceptions of image.
Although we cannot examine individuals' cue chains,
presumably in these experiments, recall of the competitor
was cueing recall of the sponsor either directly, via the indus-
try category, or via the event. This is decidedly important as
sponsorship-linked marketing is manifest within contexts
rich with direct competitor and noncompetitor mentions.
Likewise, retail environments where sponsorship-linked
marketing communications may be relevant in decision
making are often also rich with direct competitor cues; how-
ever, these cues might not be detrimental, especially if true
sponsor cues are available on packaging. At the moment, the
most we can say is that marketers should attempt to be aware
of important associates as cues and not to presume that they
result in destructive interference for sponsorship-linked mar-
keting communications.

12 SAGE Open
In the current experiments, press releases in the competitor-
present condition allowed the proposition "not a sponsor" to
be encoded. This contrasting information is presumed to have
supported a distinction (Tversky, 1977) and influenced mem-
ory. One can only suspect that exciting and memorable
ambushing events such as when runner Linford Christy wore
Puma logo contact lenses at the 1996 Olympics (where adidas
was the official sponsor, Barrett, 1996) would be even more
influential on memory than the manipulations used here.
Because intentional and inadvertent ambushers are a regular
part of the sponsorship landscape, the power of propositional
statements to influence information processing may be impor-
tant to marketers as well as legislators. Aside from memory,
future research will eventually have to consider the potentially
positive affective response to ambushing.
Moreover, these facilitation findings resulting from an
episodic-semantic constellation are important as they might
help to understand other unexplained facilitation findings.
For example, in studies investigating the role of interference,
Kumar and Krishnan (2004) showed that contextual adver-
tising elements (e.g., advertising photos) can be a source of
interference and facilitation. Specifically in their Experiment
2, when a picture label (e.g., beach scene) served as the
retrieval cue, brand claim and brand name recall with similar
visual scenes were less than those with dissimilar visual
scenes. When product class served as the retrieval cue, brand
claim and brand name recall were higher with similar visual
scenes than with different visual scenes. The authors suggest
that the product class cue was enabling participants to recall
brand name via a retrieval path not encountering contextual
interference. An explanation that is compatible with the
Kumar and Krishnan explanation, but which is also more
specific, is that the study of two beach scenes made either the
label "beach scene" or a composite image of a beach scene
more available. This label or image would be highly con-
nected to the product category (sun tan lotion) and to the
specific highly familiar brand name used (Coppertone). The
result is that two exposures to a beach scene create an avail-
able alternative retrieval pathway to the direct link between
the product category and the brand name. This appears to be
similar to the alternative retrieval pathway created by the
presence of a similar competitor in Experiments 1 and 2 of
the present research.
Several findings here suggest the need for future research.
Included is the possible influence of propositional informa-
tion. This is consistent with other calls for research on con-
sumer inference making (Kardes, Posavac, & Cronley,
2004). With respect to another aspect of inference making, if
statements regarding a competitor are placed outside the
press release where the sponsor­event link is initially
formed, do they result in the incidental ambushing described
by Quester (1997)? Because almost any sports program or
publication would exhibit a pattern of sponsor­event infor-
mation followed by product advertising from, if not direct
competitors, competitors able to form an episodic-semantic
constellation, the resulting memory is of decided interest to
marketers. In sum, many unintentional or incidental ambush-
ing communications take place in conjunction with legiti-
mate sponsorship communications. How detrimental or
facilitating is increased competitor availability when it is
accomplished via independent and unrelated competitive
mentions?
In conclusion, the advent of embedded communications
in sponsorship and areas such as brand placement and ambi-
ent marketing brings with it the requirement to investigate
these communications, as best we can, in situ. We must
consider information processing tasks as they are presented
to consumers. Although this seems in contrast to controlled
experimental work, this research has shown that a system-
atic investigation of somewhat complex or even "messy"
press releases (from an experimental paradigm perspective)
can yield insights. In summary, we found that even a brief
press release can produce a relatively strong memory for a
sponsor­event relationship. While these types of communi-
cations may be naturally vulnerable to confusion when
direct competitors are mentioned, significant memory for
each communication element is possible even under these
cluttered conditions. Finally, this research showed that indi-
viduals form episodic-semantic constellations and that these
constellations can support memory, at least in the short
term. Such constellations are, therefore, potentially impor-
tant in many aspects of sponsorship where collaborating or
competitive sponsors are communicated.
