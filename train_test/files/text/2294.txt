Abstract
Objectives: A period of economic recession may be particularly difficult for people with mental health problems as they
may be at higher risk of losing their jobs, and more competitive labour markets can also make it more difficult to find a new
job. This study assesses unemployment rates among individuals with mental health problems before and during the current
economic recession.
Methods: Using individual and aggregate level data collected from 27 EU countries in the Eurobarometer surveys of 2006
and 2010, we examined changes in unemployment rates over this period among individuals with and without mental
health problems.
Results: Following the onset of the recession, the gap in unemployment rates between individuals with and without mental
health problems significantly widened (odds ratio: 1.12, 95% confidence interval: 1.03, 1.34). This disparity became even
greater for males, and individuals with low levels of education. Individuals with mental health problems living in countries
with higher levels of stigmatizing attitudes regarding dangerousness of people with mental illness were more vulnerable to
unemployment in 2010, but not 2006. Greater agreement that people with mental health problems have themselves to
blame, was associated with lower likelihood of unemployment for individuals with and without mental health problems.
Conclusion: These findings study suggest that times of economic hardship may intensify social exclusion of people with
mental health problems, especially males and individuals with lower education. Interventions to combat economic
exclusion and to promote social participation of individuals with mental health problems are even more important during
times of economic crisis, and these efforts should target support to the most vulnerable groups.

Introduction
Several studies have demonstrated large disparities in unem-
ployment rates between people with and without mental illness.
Although most people with mental illness want to work [1], they
have higher unemployment rates than people without mental
illness and compared to people with other chronic diseases [2­4].
High unemployment rates among individuals with mental illness
are a major contributor to the substantial societal impact of these
disorders [4­6]. Unemployment has an impact upon the course
and outcome of mental illness [7] and excludes individuals from
social participation. A period of macro-economic recession may be
particularly difficult for people with mental health problems as
they may be at higher risk of losing their jobs and more
competitive labour market conditions may make it more difficult
for them to find a new job in the first place [8]. This is especially
important as research suggests that unemployment could present a
specific barrier to recovery from mental illness [9,10].
Unemployment among people with mental illness may be
aggravated during times of economic hardship [7,11,12]. Negative
attitudes towards marginalized groups (e.g., ethnic minorities or
immigrant groups) which often increase during an economic
recession [13] are one possible factor influencing this trend.
Recent research from Germany suggests that the German public's
unwillingness to recommend an individual with depression for a
job increased between 2000 and 2011 (i.e., during the period of
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 July 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 7 | e69792
the economic recession) compared to 1990­2000 [14]. A synthesis
of public attitude trends in the US between the 1950s and 1990s
showed improvements and declines which mirrored the economic
and employment context of the country [7]. Findings regarding
the impact of economic recession on disparities [15] and the
mechanisms involved, however, are mixed [15­18] and we need to
better understand the complexity of this relationship. Interestingly,
one study [16] did not show that individuals with severe mental
illness were at earlier risk of unemployment during times of
economic contraction; however, this study specifically investigated
individuals with severe mental illness who received occupational
rehabilitation services and these results may not be broadly
generalizable to the wider population of people with mental illness.
Furthermore, the effects of the recession since 2008 on disparities
are yet to be determined.
In addition to research which suggests that mental health
problems increase during times of economic recession, we
investigate the impact of the economic recession on people with
mental health problems and how this may be mediated by stigma.
This paper investigates the impact of economic hardship on
unemployment rates of people with mental health problems using
Eurobarometer survey data collected from 27 EU countries in
2006 and 2010. We test the hypothesis that the European macro-
economic crisis since 2008 has had a greater impact on
employment of people with mental health problems compared
to people without mental health problems. We also hypothesise
that the impact on individuals with mental health problems is
greater for people living in regions with greater public stigma
towards people with mental illness, after controlling for regional
unemployment rates. Additionally, as some research suggests that
certain population subgroups, such as men or individuals with low
levels of education [19], may be particularly vulnerable during
times of economic recession, we investigate whether there is a
differential impact of the recession on these subgroups in relation
to unemployment.
Materials and Methods
Data Source
Full details of the design and sampling for the Eurobarometer
surveys (Eurobarometer Mental Well-being 2006 and Eurobarometer
Mental Health 2010) are given elsewhere [20,21]. Data were
collected via face-to-face interviews among European Union (EU)
citizens (n = 29,248 in 2006 and n = 26,800 in 2010) residing in the
27 member states (approximately 1,000 individuals per country
per year). For our analysis we restricted the sample to adults of
working age (i.e., 18­64) (n = 20,368 in 2006 and n = 20,124 in
2010).
The initial mental health Eurobarometer survey was conducted
in 2006 (fieldwork carried out between 7 December 2005 and 11
January 2006). A second survey assessing attitudes toward mental
illness and treatment-seeking was administered to a new sample of
respondents in 2010 (between 26 February and 17 March 2010).
All participants were recruited via multistage random probability
sampling. Participants were representative of residents aged 15 or
older in the participating countries.
Assessments
Mental health problems were assessed via the Mental Health
Inventory (MHI-5), a well-validated and reliable measure derived
from the Short Form 36 (SF-36) [22,23] As a validated cut-point
has not been established for the MHI-5 [22], for the purposes of
this study, individuals scoring one standard deviation higher than
the standardised mean score were categorised as having mental
health problems.
Stigmatising attitudes towards individuals with mental health
problems were assessed in Eurobarometer 2006 using four
questions about various stigmatizing beliefs: (1) People with
psychological or emotional health problems constitute a danger
to others; (2) People with psychological or emotional health
problems are unpredictable; (3) People with psychological or
emotional health problems have themselves to blame and (4)
People with psychological or emotional health problems never
recover. Participants were asked how much they agreed with each
statement. Response options were on a 4-point Likert scale from
`totally disagree' to `totally agree'. Participants who responded
`totally agree' or `tend to agree' to each statement were considered
as agreeing with that statement. Responses were aggregated within
each country to obtain a country-level measure of stigmatizing
attitudes.
Socio-demographic information included age band (18­29, 30­39,
40­49 and 50­64 years), gender, education level (age at which
individuals finished full-time education), and urbanicity (i.e., size of
locality of respondent residence: large town, small or middle sized
town or rural area/village). Current employment was assessed via
the question: `What is your current occupation?' Individuals could
endorse the following categories: (1) responsible for ordinary
shopping and looking after the home, or without any current
occupation, not working (referred to throughout the paper as
`home-maker'), (2) student, (3) unemployed or temporarily not
working, (4) retired or unable to work through illness, or (5) in paid
employment.
National level unemployment rates
National unemployment figures for the years 2006 and 2010
were taken from the Eurostat yearbook (http://epp.eurostat.ec.
europa.eu/statistics_explained/index.php/ Europe_in_figures_-
_Eurostat_yearbook). Eurostat is a Directorate-General of the
European Commission and the statistical office of the European
Union. The Eurostat figures for 2006 were moderately highly
correlated with the national unemployment rates calculated from
the Eurobarometer data (r = 0.76 and 0.70, respectively).
Statistical Analysis
Four separate multivariable logistic regression models were used
to examine predictors of unemployment for individuals with and
without mental health problems in 2006 and 2010. Independent
variables included age, gender, urbanicity, country-level attitudes
regarding dangerousness, recovery, blameworthiness, and unpre-
dictability of people with mental illness. Country-level variables
were computed as an average rating for each country and each
variable was standardized. Eurobarometer post-stratification
weights, based on sex, age, region and size of locality, were used
in all analyses to estimate the country-level averages. We used
generalized estimating equations (GEE) with the robust variance
estimates to model within-country correlations. In the absence of
theoretical reasons for specifying a correlation matrix structure, we
used an unstructured correlation matrix [24]. In order to
investigate whether individual unemployment status differed by
population subgroups of interest (i.e., men, individuals with low
levels of education and younger individuals) following the
recession, we first tested the interaction between survey year and
these variables and then tested a three-way interaction between
survey year, mental health problems and these variables. All
analyses were carried out using SAS version 9.3.

Results
Socio-demographic characteristics (Table 1)
Compared to individuals without mental health problems,
individuals with mental health problems were disproportionately
women (x2 = 125.2, df = 1, p,0N001 in 2006 and x2 = 87.9, df = 1,
p,0N001 in 2010) and older (x2 = 316.9, df = 3, p,0N001 in 2006
and x2 = 93.9, df = 3, p,0N001 in 2010). The majority of people
with and without mental health problems had completed
education at least to 16 years of age; however, more of those
without mental health problems finished education at age 20+ or
were still studying (x2 = 210.1, df = 1, p,0N001 in 2006 and
x2 = 237.8, df = 1, p,0N001 in 2010). A higher proportion of
people with mental health problems had no formal education or
only finished education at 15 years of age (x2 = 313.8, df = 1,
p = p,0N001 in 2006 and x2 = 213.7, df = 1, p,N0001 in 2010).
Individuals with mental health problems were less likely to be in
paid employment or to be a student or home-makers and more
likely to be unemployed or disabled/retired, (x2 = 452.6, df = 4,
p,0N0001 in 2006 and x2 = 109.4, df = 4, p,0N0001 in 2010).
Trends in unemployment among people with mental
health problems
Unemployment rates were higher among people with mental
health problems compared to those without in both survey years
(Table 1). Overall unemployment rates were also higher in 2010
compared to 2006. The gap in unemployment rates between
individuals with and without mental health problems widened in
2010 compared to 2006 (Figure 1). The differential trend was
statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] for the interaction term for
mental health problems by year = 1.12, 95% confidence interval
[CI]: 1.03, 1.34. We performed several types of sensitivity analyses
to test the robustness of this relationship. We investigated
additional cutpoints for individuals scoring in the top ten and
the top five percent of mental health problems and their likelihood
of unemployment relative to the rest of the population. The
differential trend was also statistically significant for these groups:
the p-value for the interaction term for mental health problems by
year for the top ten percent was 0.020 and the top five percent was
0.018. We also conducted additional sensitivity analyses applying
an instrumental variable approach in which individual mental
health problems were considered to be endogenous to the model
and this also showed a significant relationship and the interaction
term for year and mental health problems was also significant
(p,0.001).
Relationship between unemployment and mental health
status
In each of the survey years, local unemployment rates
ascertained by Eurostat were strongly associated with the odds
of being unemployed among participants both with and without
mental health problems in Eurobarometer (Table 2). Among
people with mental health problems, males were more likely to be
unemployed than females in 2010 (OR: 1.58, 95% CI: 1.30, 1.92,
p,0.001) and marginally more likely to be unemployed than
females in 2006 (OR: 1.24, 95%CI: 0.99, 1.57, p = 0.067). The
interaction term for gender and year was statistically significant for
the entire sample (p,0.001) and among individuals with mental
health problems (p,0.01), but not among those without mental
health problems. In 2010, 21.7% of men with mental health
problems were unemployed, compared to 13.7% in 2006. For
women with mental health problems, the difference in unemploy-
ment rate between 2010 (15.6%) and 2006 (11.9%) in 2006 was
narrower.
In both 2006 and 2010 individuals in the youngest age band
(18­29 years), with and without mental health problems, were
more likely to be unemployed than individuals in the oldest age
band (50­64 years). However, age patterns of unemployment in
both survey years varied among those with and without mental
health problems in that the younger age was more strongly
associated with unemployment among those without mental
health problems (p,0.001). Indeed, the unemployed with mental
health problems were significantly older than those without mental
health problems (mean age = 4.3 vs. 36.1, t-test = 10.16,
p = 0.001).
Fewer years of education was significantly associated with
unemployment among individuals with and without mental health
problems; however, education was more strongly associated with
unemployment among individuals with mental health problems
compared to those without these problems (p = 0.001). The impact
of education on employment was also more substantial during
2010 compared with 2006 among individuals with mental health
problems only (p = 0.010). This interaction was also significant
among the entire sample (p = 0.020), but not among those without
mental health problems.
Urbanicity (i.e., size of the town where participants were
recruited) did not play a major role in likelihood of unemployment
except that individuals with mental health problems who lived in a
large town relative to a rural area were more likely to be
unemployed (Table 2), which could be interpreted as implying that
a larger labour market disadvantages those with mental health
problems.
During 2010, but not 2006, among individuals with mental
health problems only, living in a country where a higher proportion
of the general public agreed that people with mental health
problems are dangerous was associated with a higher likelihood of
being unemployed (Table 2). During 2006, individuals with mental
health problems living in a country where a lower proportion of the
general public agreed that people with mental health problems
have themselves to blame were more likely to be unemployed.
This relationship was maintained in 2010. Living in a country
where a higher proportion of the general public agreed that people
with mental health problems will never recover was associated
with a marginally higher likelihood of being unemployed among
individuals with mental health problems (p = 0.097).
Discussion
Economic recession has had enormous impacts across much of
Europe; however, little information is available about the specific
impact of the recession on groups who are already vulnerable to
social exclusion, specifically individuals with mental illness. This is
the first study to demonstrate that the European economic crisis
had a greater impact on people with mental health problems,
compared to people without mental health problems, as measured
by exclusion from employment. Our study also identified
important sub-groups which experienced greater impacts of the
economic recession in terms of unemployment, specifically men
and individuals with low levels of education. Overall, males and
individuals with lower levels of education appear to have been
affected disproportionately by the recession; both groups had a
significantly greater increase in likelihood of being unemployed
following the recession. Moreover, for individuals with mental

health problems, gender and level of education were particularly
important determinants of employment status as the recession
seemed to have a disproportionately higher negative impact on
their likelihood of being employed for men and those with less
education. This may be due to shifts in labour markets: other
studies have suggested that men may be more vulnerable to
unemployment during the current recession in Europe as they are
more likely to work in construction and manufacturing jobs which
are more vulnerable to decreases in demand and job loss [25],
while other research suggests that this disparity is only evident
during the initial stages of a recession [11].
This study also showed that stigmatizing attitudes, specifically
beliefs regarding dangerousness of individuals with mental health
problems, could be an important mediator in the relationship
between unemployment and mental health problems following the
recession. Living in a country where a higher proportion of
individuals believe that individuals with mental illness are
dangerous was associated with a higher likelihood of unemploy-
ment for people with mental health problems, but did not
influence employment rates for those without mental health
problems. Moreover, this became significant in 2010, following
the economic recession. Other studies have emphasised the
persistence of attitudes related to dangerousness and their
association with community rejection [26]. Research on racial
discrimination suggests that stereotype amplification in relation to
risk and fear of victimisation plays an important role in the

Mental Health Consequences of the Recession

persistence of racial inequalities and community segregation [27].
These attitudes may be internalised by the stigmatised group.
Recent international work underscores the prevalence of experi-
enced and anticipated discrimination among people with depres-
sion in relation to employment, suggesting that this is a critical
barrier to achieving employment integration [28]. A recent
analysis of trends in public attitudes toward people with mental
health problems in England and older research from the U.S. also
suggested that attitudes to people with mental health problems
may harden during periods of economic crisis [7,29]; however,
there is a gap in research around this topic. Surprisingly, a higher
proportion of the public endorsing blameworthiness was consis-
tently associated with lower rates of unemployment among people
with mental health problems. Previous research has found that
stigmatizing attitudes are highly specific in their relation to impact
on people with mental health problems. For example, living in a
community with stronger beliefs about blameworthiness of
individuals with mental illness is associated with lower rates of
willingness to seek professional help [30] but also lower levels of
perceived discrimination among people with mental health
problems [31]. Other research has shown that world views such
as stronger just world beliefs for self may be a double edged sword
as they are associated with greater blameworthiness; but also lower
self stigma among people with mental illness [32]. It could be that
environments with greater endorsement of blame and controlla-
bility of symptoms and/or illness also engender a context where
the guilt and blame associated with those who are not working is
increased. Thus, any intervention would need to carefully consider
the complexity of cultural factors and beliefs underlying individual
and public attitudes.
Previous studies have demonstrated the impact of the recession
on public health more generally [33­35], however, the selective
impact of recession on people with mental health problems,
especially males or individuals with lower levels of education,
should be acknowledged through both research and policy.
Analysis of general government policy responses in Europe
following the crisis reveals deficiencies and problems and suggests
that governments should allocate resources toward keeping and
reintegrating people into employment in addition to initiating
programmes that help people cope with the negative effects of job
loss to counteract the adverse health effects of the recession [33].
Highlighting the population subgroups who are most vulnerable to
economic shocks and identifying ways to mitigate the effects of
these shocks is also important. It may be that investment in
targeted programmes such as debt advice for people with mental
health problems may improve their mental health and financial
circumstances [36,37]. Given the cuts in mental health services
across Europe, the impact of the recession is likely to be felt among
a growing number of individuals alongside dwindling resources.
Lack of resources may strain mental health services during times of
higher need leading to decreased access in the face of increased
need. In Spain where the impact of the recent recession has been
among the greatest, the prevalence of mental disorders diagnosed
in primary care settings is increasing. These increases are
associated with increases in unemployment and also present
among individuals whose employment is threatened and also those
who are struggling to make payments on their mortgage [38].
Recent findings from both England and Spain suggest that the
recession is associated with a deterioration in population mental
health [19,38]. In addition to people with mental health problems
generally, it is important to acknowledge specific subgroups with
mental health problems, such as males and those with lower
education. In addition to having a higher likelihood of unemploy-
ment, these subgroups have lower rates of help-seeking and more
negative attitudes about mental illness [29,39] and thus, may
require specific forms of outreach.
Limitations
This study presents new and important information about the
impact of macroeconomic downturn on people with and without
mental health problems in Europe using nationally representative
data from 27 countries in Europe surveyed over two time points,
before and after the onset of the current recession. Nevertheless,
the data were not collected with the specific aims of this study in
mind and were not longitudinal in nature as the same individuals
were not interviewed in the two surveys. Mental health status was
determined via a brief self-report measure and thus mental health
problems were not verified by a clinician. Additionally, type and
severity of problems were not assessed. Most previous research on
employment of individuals with mental health problems and also
on mental illness stigma has focused on those with severe mental
disorders which could not be identified in the Eurobarometer data.
Additionally, data on potentially important characteristics such as
ethnicity and immigration status or survey response rates were not
available. The investigation was limited to two time points only
and although the impact of economic recession was clearly evident
in 2010, long term effects could not be investigated. Relatedly, as
these are observational data, our analyses could not rule out
reverse causality, and the potential that people who were
unemployed were more likely to develop mental health problems
in 2010. Other research has suggested that a large proportion of
the consequences of unemployment such as mortality are due to
mental health related selection prior to becoming unemployed
[40] suggesting that this is an important mechanism to investigate.
Our main outcome of interest was unemployment; however, there
may be other important effects of the economic crisis in terms of
social exclusion which we were not able to examine. As
Eurobarometer recruited individuals by household, we were not
able to investigate individuals who may have transitioned into
more extreme types of exclusion i.e., individuals who became
homeless, were in care or hospital settings or were imprisoned.
Finally, attitudes about people with mental illness were only
collected at one time point in 2006 which precludes assessment of
changes in public attitudes over time and its potential impact on
unemployment trends. However, the assessment of attitudes
preceded the economic crisis and so was not confounded by the
effects of the recession.
Past research has consistently shown that people with mental
health problems tend to be excluded from employment, housing
and social relationships, and that this exclusion has negative social
and economic consequences [8]. This study suggests that times of
economic hardship are likely to heighten such exclusion for people
with mental health problems. The study also provides some
preliminary clues as to which groups of individuals with mental
health problems are especially vulnerable during times of
economic hardship, and what societal factors might moderate this
adverse relationship. Use of both individual-level and aggregate-
level data to explore this relationship provides new and important
evidence about the impact of the macro-social context on
individuals during times of economic recession and facilitates
micro-macro research in relation to mental health and exclusion
[41,42]. Findings suggest that programmes to combat exclusion
and to promote mental health may be more important during
times of economic crisis. Future research should examine the long
term effects of the economic recession on people with mental
health problems and the relationship between different types of
employment and social welfare policies and unemployment rates
for people with mental health problems.
