Rebuilding Babel: finding common
development solutions using cross-contextual
comparisons of multidimensional well-being*
James R. Hull**
Gilvan Guedes***
In this paper the theoretical tradition of coping strategies and capital portfolios is used as
the basis for adaption and combination of existing methodologies to analyze well-being
in rural households. Special attention is given to comparisons among different contexts.
First we estimate a multidimensional measurement of poverty based on fuzzy logic for two
areas of rural frontiers: Nang Rong, Thailand, and Altamira, in the Amazon Basin in Brazil. To
enable a cross-contextual comparison we calculated a second estimate using a subset of
shared measurements in the two areas. The findings suggest that the pattern of responses
on a range of numerous key variables ­ including education, income and demographic
dependency ratio ­ is robust for the model specification. It is concluded that comparative
generalizations, usefulin formulating cost-effective publicpolicyinterventionsacrosscontexts,
could be satisfactorily identified in many situations. More generically, this approach provides
researchers and policymakers with a frameworkfor understanding the interaction of contexts
with the subjective construction of well-being. The understanding of this interaction is useful
for distinguishing stable corollaries of poverty from those that are volatile across contexts.

Introduction
The concept of poverty has received renewed theoretical attention and revision in recent
years (SEN; 1985, 1999; KAKWANI; SILBER, 2008a; ALKIRE, 2007). The result has been
the emergence of a large literature seeking to identify specific dimensions of poverty that
are argued to better capture the complex paths to well-being than existing unidimensional
measures of monetary income (BIBI; 2005). However, the literature on Multidimensional
Poverty (MDP) presently does a poor job of acknowledging the new challenges that high-
information measures of MDP present to comparative cross-contextual studies of MDP. Using
these more refined and data-intensive measures has the potential to reduce the ability to
assess and compare poverty across contexts for reasons that range from mundane but
important restrictions imposed by data collection and the use of secondary data sources to
significant questions about the meaning, relevance, and significance of various dimensions
to the overall assessment of poverty across contexts.
Methodologically, differences across the data sets used in studies of MDP ­ in data
collection strategy, rigor, and substantive purpose ­ create a host of challenges, some of
which are error-related, and others of which take on theoretical importance. Based informally
upon our own experience in attempting to construct high-information MDP measures for
comparative work, the relationship between the number ofindicatorsusedin an MDP measure
and the availability of that measure (or taking it to the next level, of any measures of a given
dimension) in all study areas is a negative one. In short, the likelihood that all relevant
measures exist across all comparison contexts is low, and any success in obtaining such a
match is due mostly to good fortune rather than systematic coordination.
This creates an unpleasant choice for researchers: forego cross-contextual comparisons
of MDP altogether due to a lack of suitable data, or accept a largely unknown degree of
bias due to the omission of important variables or dimensions of poverty in one or more
sites. Of further concern is the likely possibility that specification and measurement of MDP
exhibit a dependency on context rendering cross-contextual comparison difficult even with
complete substantive coverage in the data. Much more work is needed to address these
issues systematically, particularly the empirical exploration of context-dependence with
high-information MDP measures. In this paper, we suggest an approach which represents a
compromise between the two options described above.
We address the methodological challenges of comparing high-dimensionality MDP
measures across contexts through the identification of multidimensional profiles (so-called
"extreme profiles") of poverty and well-being that are determined through a hybrid process
that incorporates both data reduction and researcher judgment rather than pure, or naïve,
data reduction strategies. Once these extreme profiles exist, we proceed to use fuzzy logic
to assign whole or partial membership to each profile for every unit in the sample for each
sample of comparative interest (GUEDES et al., 2012). The result is a summary measure of
relative well-being that allows for the differential contribution of specific dimensions to the
273

overall measure of well-being, both across samples and within samples. Known asvagueness,
this property enables us to move from seeking strict cutoff points to identifying gradations of
poverty (CHELI, 1995; CHELI; LEMMI, 1995; CHIAPPERO-MARTINETTI, 2004).
We address the theoretical challenge of cross-contextual poverty comparisons using
a sequential process in which we sort all available measures of poverty for all contexts of
interest into two groups. The first, termed plenary measures, consists of all those measures
of any dimension of poverty that are available for all contexts. The second, termed idiomatic
measures, consists of all additional measures which are unique to one or more contexts or
datasets. We then construct two models of poverty ­ one which includes only the plenary
set and a second which includes both the plenary and the idiomatic indicators. Doing so
enables us to identify the effect, within a single context, of moving from a lower-information
to a higher-information (site-specific) measure of MDP on overall MDP estimates within that
context. While this approach still does not enable us to determine the level of poverty in
other contexts under the counterfactual scenario in which these other factors were measured,
it does serve as a rudimentary form of sensitivity analysis, capable of alerting researchers
to instances in which comparative statements are not supportable, or in need of careful
interpretation and scrutiny.
In the analysis that follows, we identify a large set of plenary poverty measures (P) and
an equally large set of idiomatic poverty measures (I) for two distinct contexts: ­ one in
Northeastern Thailand and a second in what is known juridically in Brazil as "Legal Amazon,"
Using a Bayesian approach, we determine that the best fitting models are indeed those
containing the most parsimonious set information (in our terminology, the models including
variable set "P", the shared measures). Indeed, on a wide range of important and policy-
relevant individual measures, the observed relationship is robust to the use of either model
P +I or model P, suggesting that stronger comparative statements based upon model P may
be acceptable, with the standard caveats about unmeasured variables and their complex,
qualitative association with the shared indicators. In our example, we find the pattern is
consistent for a variety of forms of capitals, ranging from financial to human to social, and
for a variety of livelihood activities. The methodology also enables us to quickly assess which
factors display a common distribution across contexts and which show a more complex
relationship. These results represent a major first step in the unraveling of the relationship
between contexts generally and MDP using high-information measures.
Our suggested approach seeks to overcome three important limitations of the current
empiricalandmethodologicalliterature on MDP: 1) we derive our scalar measure ofwell-being
from multi-thematic survey data at the local level, taking a bottom-up like perspective on how
families experience deprivation in its multiple dimensions; 2) we focus on the ability of our
MDP scalar to be robustto cross-contextualcomparisons, and3) our MDP measure represents
an alternative to other proposed scalars at the household/family level, such as the Family
Development Index (FDI) or the Human Poverty Index (HPI) (BARROS; CARVALHO; FRANCO,
2003, 2006). Instead of directly adding up variables independently and then assigning a

weighting scheme, as done in the FDI and HPI indices, we depart from the observed, data-
driven multivariate correlation structure of well-being dimensions at the household level to
then compare itto a theoreticalpattern ofwell-being.Thisiskeyto tackling the problem ofhow
to assign the weighting structure of a summary scalar: instead of creating a post-estimation
weight matrix, we use the distance of the multivariate correlation structure from the real data
to this theoretical pattern as the weighting scheme.
We begin in Section II by drawing attention to the lack of studies attempting to make
quantitative cross-contextual comparisons of MDP using highly dimensional measures and
briefly summarizing the literature on MDP assessment. Section III presents our fundamental
framework and describes the specific contexts, data, and methods employed. The case
studies used in this article are intended to test the robustness of our approach. Thus, we
spend more time in this section describing the limitations of current literature on MPDs
and how to tackle them by combining different methodologies and theoretical approaches,
instead of focusing on a rich description of the Altamira and Nang Rong contexts. Descriptive
results are reported in Section IV. We conclude in Section V with a discussion of the future
of cross-contextual examinations of MDP, and offer additional practical suggestions
to researchers struggling to colonize the middle ground between the rich, single-site
examinations and the fairly shallow cross-contextual comparisons that characterize the
present state of MDP research.
Background
Cross-contextual comparisons of multidimensional poverty
Research identifying independentdimensionsofpovertyandconstructing summarymulti-
dimensional poverty (MDP) measures constitutes a large and diverse literature (KAKWANI;
SILBER, 2008a; 2008b). Such research benefits from improved depth and breadth of
poverty-relevant survey research in recent decades across a wide range of contexts (BETTI et
al., 2005). But despite the greater availability of secondary data sources supporting detailed
poverty assessments, the MDP literature as a whole displays a reasonably strong bifurcation.
On the one hand are numerous studies using large multi-thematic datasets to construct
high-information, high-dimensionality poverty measures (e.g. BELLIDO et al., 1998; LUZZI
et al., 2008; RAMOS et al., 2008). The chief price paid for such detailed measurement is
reduced external generalizability, a limitation acknowledged in many of these single-context
studies. At the other extreme are comparative studies of poverty across contexts (e.g. CHEN;
RAVALLION, 2007; KRISNAKUMAR, 2008; CHAKRAVARTY;SILBER, 2008; BRADY; FULLERTON;
CROSS, 2009). While these also compare poverty multidimensionally across a large sample
of contexts (most often, nations), they rely upon a much smaller number of dimensions and
specific indicators. The latter are also generally carried out at the macro-level, which while
shedding light on certain aspects of the poverty experience may simultaneously leave other
aspects of MDP, including cross-scale interactions, hidden or obscure.

Between these extremes lies a challenging task: developing the methodology and the
supporting datasets needed to make cross-contextual comparisons of multidimensional
poverty based upon high-information measures of MDP. To better demonstrate this
bifurcation in the literature, and the corresponding gap, we undertook a survey of recent
empirical studies of MDP. We selected a recent peer-reviewed edited volume (KAKWANI;
SILBER, 2008b) and supplemented it with additional articles found using ISI and JSTOR
searches on the term "multidimensional poverty". In all, we examined 21 studies between
2004 and 2008 that measure multidimensional poverty using various methodologies ­
latent class, fuzzy set, structural equation, and axiomatic approaches. Figure 1 presents
our classification of these studies according to two measures: 1.) the number of unique
indicators used in each MDP measure, and 2.) the number of unique contexts over which the
MDP measure was employed. The pattern that emerges is an abundance of low-information,
high-comparison studies and many high-information, low comparison studies. There is
little activity in the "middle territory" representing high-information and many-comparison
studies of MDP (Figure 1). Given the continued importance for both policy and scientific
aims of the comparison of poverty ­ degrees of poverty, shares of the impoverished
population, and rankings within and across context ­ we find this observation about the
current literature troubling.

Superimposed on Figure 1 are two possible paths forward to high-information cross-

the scope of current cross-contextual comparisons to include additional measures. The
challenge with this approach is the extreme difficulty in obtaining reliable data on additional
dimensions of poverty for the full sample of countries used in such studies. In all likelihood,

current studies of this type (e.g. CHAKRAVARTY; SILBER, 2008) may already be approaching
the upper bound on the number of poverty indicators it is possible to compile for many
dozens of countries at around 5 or 6 (typically GPD per capita, expenditure estimates, life
expectancy at birth, food expenditure estimates, and literacy rates or school enrollment
levels). Path B represents, for us, a more tractable set of challenges. This path corresponds
to increasing the number of contexts involved in high-information MDP comparisons.
Doing so requires that we address a number of concerns, discussed in detail in the
following section.
Theoretical obstacles to cross-contextual comparisons of MDP
Depth studieshelp usto understandthe dimensionalstructure ofMDP in specificcontexts,
andprovide detailedunderstanding ofitsconstituentelements. Buttheyprovide questionable
basis for cross-contextual comparison on a theoretical level. Chief among these is that not all
entities that contribute to well-being are A.) monetizable or B.) commensurable. To become
monetized, a service, object, or other valued entity must have its value to potential users
fixed with reference to a monetary unit of account, such as dollars, pesos, or conch shells.
Despite centuries of attempts to fix value in human societies to a single base unit, many
valued entities that influence both subjective and objective measures of MDP remain non-
monetized, for example: a.) the value of child care and housework when provided by family
members (ZELIZER, 1989; 1997; CHASE-DUNN; KAWANO; BREWER, 2000), b.) the value of
land that has been passed down over generations (CARNEIRO 2001; VANWEY; CEBULKO,
2007; GUEDES; QUEIROZ, 2008; GUEDES; QUEIROZ; VANWEY, 2009; LUDEWIGS et al.,
2009; VANWEY; GUEDES; D'ANTONA, 2011), or c.) the monetary value of scholarly advice
and editorial services rendered between colleagues (PRENDERGAST; STOLL, 1996). Even if
the monetary value of such entities can be determined in principle, there are several reasons
why researchers should be cautious in doing so. In cases like those above, humans generally
are not simply lacking the ability to monetize a good or service, but actively resisting such
pecuniaryvaluation in deference to cultural norms, mores, and social institutional restrictions
that researchers are wise (if not ethically bound) to honor.
The challenge imposed by monetization and commensurability is especially important
when one wants to study material rural well-being. In rural settings, the possession of money
may be of little importance for certain goods and services, for whose markets are imperfect
or nonexistent. Reciprocity rules are a good example of quasi-economic institutions that
promote well-being among rural households without the need to assess traditional market
for tangibles, such as food, clothing or farm work (BEBBINGTON, 1999; DE SHERBININ et al.,
2008). Place-specific capital is also ignored as an important component of well-being in most
MDP measures, such as HDI, which focus exclusively on formal educational attainment. In
this regard, an urban-bias among current aggregate MDP indices seems to prevail.
277
Rebuilding Babel

R. bras. Est. Pop., Rio de Janeiro, v. 30, n. 1, p. 271-297, jan./jun. 2013
Just as important, humans also continue to stubbornly impose a complex web of non-
economicvaluations and concerns overtop of exchange transactions.These protectedvalues
(BARON; SPRANCA, 1997) restrict the range of goods and services that are commensurable,
and raise concerns about how to quantify values that humans themselves actively resist
quantifying. These concerns are both ethical and pragmatic. Ethically, if a respondent states
that no monetary price can or should be affixed to vital services rendered by friends and
family, it may not be justifiable for the researcher to assign monetary value to them anyway.
Pragmatically, in avoiding attaching an arbitrary monetary value to various constituent
elements of well-being, we encounter commensurability in a different form. In a specific
context like Altamira, Brazil, for example, land is valued based upon many complex factors,
only some of which are directly monetizable, and to complicate matters further, land is not
bought and sold with a regularity sufficient to establish a reliable price standard for land.
Yet the natural capital embodied in the land is a central component of household well-being
in this context (GUEDES et al., 2012). Thus, the practical challenge is how to include land
in a measure of MDP along with per capita income, for example, without forcing the value
and contribution of the former to be artificially computed in the units of the latter. One
approach is to explicitly reject single-unit calculations of wealth. Such approaches, while
avoiding the need to make financial capital and natural capital directly commensurable,
are limited by the difficulty in making overall comparisons across units of analysis when
each unit may have multiple differing "scores" for poverty ­ one for each class of valued
entities assessed.
An alternative approach is to consider each indicator as having an underlying distribution
of some sort and calculate the position in that distribution for each subject. By "adding up"
the relative positions of subjects on each dimension, one comes closer to a measure of MDP
that assesses the value of a bundle of goods, capitals, and other valued entities that are not
strictlycommensurable.Thisapproach hasbeen proposedbyBrazilian researchersatthe IPEA
Institute for Applied Economic Research (IPEA). Both the Family Development Index(FDI) and
the Human Poverty Index (HPI) render summary multidimensional scalars of poverty at the
family/household level that are easily collapsed up and down to different levels of interest
(BARROS; CARVALHO; FRANCO, 2003, 2006). Although representing an important advance
to previous multidimensional indices, such as the HDI (UNDP, 1990), such an approach still
fails to consider the interactive potential of a household possessing sufficient amounts of
two capitals, such as land and labor, that provide much greater levels of wealth and well-
being in conjunction with each other than separately. That is, the weighting scheme applied
to these scalars lacks the ability to capture the joint functioning of multiple dimensions that
are frequently idiosyncratic to each household.
Our answer to this problem is to utilize Grade of Membership (GoM) modeling, which
belongs to a class of latent class models which can simultaneously consider the relative
position of a household on each distribution and assign that household an overall score
278 R. bras. Est. Pop., Rio de Janeiro, v. 30, n. 1, p. 271-297, jan./jun. 2013

Hull, J.R. e Guedes, G.
of belonging to each of a set of "extreme profiles" measuring MDP. These profiles articulate
the specific responses given by a hypothetical model household that would be considered
as impoverished or as wealthy as possible. Our resulting measure, the distance between
a household and each extreme profile, represents not an absolute measure of total
assets, well-being, or poverty, but rather a relative measure which can be interpreted
as a household's (or other unit's) location on a distribution of distances from "maximal
wealth" or "maximal poverty." Importantly, the vagueness of a fuzzy approach to poverty
measurement ensures that the relative contribution of each separate constituent member
is permitted to vary across households and across contexts. If land ownership, for example,
represents a different relationship to total MPD in two different research locations, this
method permits the accurate estimation of the contribution of land to MDP in each location,
while maintaining overall comparability. In the next section, we describe this approach in
greater detail.
In addition to incorporating a flexible weighting scheme, allowing for the structure
(composition) of the household's portfolio of capitals in each context, our tentative
methodology seeks to address an "urban bias" present in other MDP measures, basing our
reference group (the maximum well-being profile) on solid theoretical frameworks, such as
the livelihood strategies approach as well as the capital portfolios' perspective. This way,
an important part of the methodological proposition relies on identifying what defines a
reference group. As a heads-up, we alert for the need to adapt the theoretical comparison
group in urban contexts, for instance, when some of the capitals may reach high levels of
incommensurability or contextual irrelevance.
Data and methods
Data and context
We selected two sites at different stages of transitioning from frontier to established
agricultural regions to illustrate our approach (VANWEY; HULL; GUEDES, 2013). Nang Rong
District, Thailand, began to witness dramatic population growth attributable to an influx of
frontier settlers in the 1950s. Altamira, located in the Brazilian state of Pará on the threshold
of the Amazon, also experienced a large influx of settlers following the opening of the Trans-
Amazon highway in the 1970s. In both cases, extensive field work has been paired with
longitudinal data collections to produce a detailed picture of relative household poverty
over time (for detailed descriptions of methodology, see RINDFUSS; ENTWISLE; WALSH,
2009 for Nang Rong and BRONDÍZIO et al., 2002; VANWEY; D'ANTONA; BRONDIZIO, 2007;
VANWEY; GUEDES; D'ANTONA, 2011; GUEDES et al., 2012 for Altamira). As a result, we have
two socioeconomic survey instruments which have undergone extensive field-testing over
many years to improve the validity of individual items and the overall breadth of domains
represented in the questions.

R. bras. Est. Pop., Rio de Janeiro, v. 30, n. 1, p. 271-297, jan./jun. 2013
In our Altamira study site, 402 households and farm properties were sampled.
The stratified sample of farm units by cohort of settlement is representative of the
farm units in the region. Both heads of the households were interviewed, along with
any other females aged fifteen and over. Males responded to an economic and land
use questionnaire, while females answered questionnaires covering family socio-
demography, reproductive history, and the use of contraceptive methods. For poverty
measures using multidimensional variables, we restricted our sample to the 1997/1998
owners who had complete information on income and additional selected characteristics
(N=307 observations).
In our Nang Rong study area, we use data collected during the year 2000 non-
agricultural season. A complete census was conducted in 92 villages. Household
interviews were conducted with key informants on a wide range of subjects, including
demography, life histories for some household members, migration histories, economic
measures, agricultural production, and land use. Community-level interviews were carried
out with key informants in every village in the district, which were used to construct some
measures in the present analysis. In total, 8,583 out of 8,638 households provided
usable responses for this analysis.
Selecting indicators
Recent research suggests that a hybrid approach to constructing MDP measures
involving both systematic data reduction and expert judgment can be as effective as
unsupervised methods alone (ALKIRE, 2007). We use a hybrid approach focused on
indicators rather than dimensions in order to remove measurement errors that may be
introduced by differing linkages between indicators and dimensions. To do so, we begin
by grouping all indicators from each dataset into two categories. The first, termed plenary,
or shared, poverty measures (P), includes all poverty indicators existing in all datasets
which also have relevance in all contexts. The second, termed idiomatic, or unique, poverty
measures (I), are all other poverty indicators of interest which are not available for all
datasets or relevant in all contexts.
Boxes1 and2 listthe plenaryandidiomaticindicatorsusedin thisanalysis. Box1 isa side-
by-side comparison of indicators judged to be similar enough to allow for a direct comparison
across study sites. Box 2 lists all indicators for which no corresponding measure is available
in the other dataset. The existence of such idiomatic measures is likely to be common when
working secondarily with two or more data sets collected for different purposes in different
contexts. While it is extremely important that researchers continue to press for new multi-
context, multi-thematic datasets, the abundance of single-site multithematic datasets makes
the development of a methodology capable of supporting the measurement and analysis of
MDP with existing data an important goal.

General comparative framework
We utilize a fuzzy approach known as Grade of Membership (GoM), described in detail
in the next section, combined with traditional axiomatic measures of poverty (Foster-Greer-
Thorbecke indicators), to create a summary MDP measure. We estimate two models, first
with only the plenary poverty measures (P), and second incorporating variables from both
the plenary and the idiomatic sets of indicators (P +I). This procedure allows us to compare
MDP between contexts using the plenary measures common to both contexts, while enabling
us to determine the effect of excluding the idiomatic poverty measures from the first model.
The latter provides an answer to the question of what happens to MDP within context as the
set of indicators used in measurement is altered, essentially a sensitivity test that conditions
the nature, strength, and generalizability of the conclusions drawn from the first set of cross-
contextual comparisons. This comparative framework is summarized graphically in Figure 2.

We expect that in many contexts the results of the first (P) and second (P +I) models will
diverge in non-trivial ways. This is an important consequence of using this approach. When a
researcher requires the most accurate measurement possible of poverty in a single context,
numerous existing approaches may prove adequate. But if the aim is to understand the
interaction of context and poverty measurement, then our simple heuristic may be of great
value in helping researchers to identify potentially invalid comparisons. In the absence of
a single, common metric for the determination of all value, the best one can do is compare
those thingsthatare common first, andthen attemptto gauge the impactofadding in the rest.
Grade of Membership modeling applied to multidimensional scalars
We utilize Grade of Membership (GoM) modeling, a fuzzy logic methodology (MANTON;
WOODBURY; TOLLEY, 1994), to generate a single continuous measure of the extent to

which a household is multidimensionally poor, while avoiding the direct commensuration
of various household assets. To do this, we compare empirical profiles of each household
in each sample to theoretical profiles of maximal well-being, generating a measure of the
distance between the household's lived experience and a sociological ideal type of maximum
well-being (GUEDES; CARMO, 2012; GUEDES et al., 2012). Following Garcia; Soares-Filho;
Sawyer (2007) we call this approach the hierarchical latent scalar approach, differing from
a traditional exploratory latent class approach where profiles of well-being would freely arise
from empirical correlation structure of the data.
Instead of using initial random probability matrices for the locational parameters
estimation within GoM environment, as done is most of the applied literature (SAWYER; LEITE,
ALEXANDRINO,2002;GUEDES;QUEIROZ;VANWEY,2009),wedefineamodelwithtwoextreme
profiles, K = 2, where for each variable, j, in profile k =2, the category representing the most
well-off, will receive probability equal to one (kjl
= 1,000), and zero for the others. For profile
k= 1 the opposite is done, that is, for the least well-off category of a variable j, the probability
equalsone andzero for allthe others.With thisstrategy, the fuzzypartition parameter (gik=2
, or
simplygi2
) measuresthe observedmultidimensionalintensityofwell-being for each individual
in the sample. An example of such a matrix is presented in Table 1. Once the fuzzy partition
gi2
is estimated, we use it as the empirical function of multidimensional well-being. We use
this function to estimate various traditional poverty and inequality indices, which hold the
same axiomatic properties as the original measures, but are based on a multidimensional
scalar rather than monetary income.

Multidimensional poverty and inequality assessment
We use three summary measures of poverty and two measures of inequality in order
to assess differences between models P and P+I. FGT (Foster-Greer-Thorbecke) metrics
correspond to a set of indices based on headcounts and poverty gaps. These indices are
widely applied in poverty studies and used to measure several aspects of poverty such
as proportion, intensity and severity (STEWART, 2006). Instead of substitutes, they can be
seen as complementary, since they respond to different aspects of poverty (FOSTER; GREER;
284 R. bras. Est. Pop., Rio de Janeiro, v. 30, n. 1, p. 271-297, jan./jun. 2013
Rebuilding Babel
Hull, J.R. e Guedes, G.
TORBECKE, 1984; HOFFMANN, 1998).The three FGT measures used are: the headcount ratio
(HC), the poverty gap index (PGI), and the squared poverty gap index (PGI). FGT measures are
traditionally used to estimate poverty based on per capita income level, but we extend them
to our scalar measure of multidimensional well-being in order to assess both the change
in MDP levels using model P and P+I and the distribution of composite well-being across a
variety of individual indicators.
We applytwo ofthe mostcommon income inequalitymeasuresin the empiricalliterature:
Gini and L Theil. Gini coefficient can be derived from the synthetic well-being distribution or
from the Lorenz Curve. Gini coefficient graphically represents the increase in the cumulated
proportion of income due to the cumulated proportion of population over the i-th person.The
closer to unity, the higher the inequality of the population (DORFMAN, 1979). Interpretation
of LTheil is similar to the Gini coefficient, although it has a wider range of scalar variation and
is bound to 0 and infinity. The closer to zero, the lower the inequality is. Different from Gini,
L Theil is not applicable to households with no income (HOFFMANN, 1998).
Plotting proportions of poor across the range of key variables
Once the summary MDP measures are calculated for models P and P+I, we plot the
proportion of households in each sample that are considered multidimensionally poor
over a ranges of individual indictors. Doing so enables us to quickly assess changes in the
relationship between overall MDP and individual components for multiple contexts when
one moves from the ideal site-specific model (P+I) to one appropriate for cross-contextual
comparisons (P). This lets us answer the question of how the relationship between the
individual indicator and the overall MDP measure changes when the total amount of
information in the model is altered. To guide interpretation, we introduce a three-part
heuristic, summarized in Figure 3. The first possibility is no observed change in the level or
distribution of poverty across a variable's range comparing models P and P+I. This indicates
that inclusion of additional variables in model P+I has no impact. The second scenario is
a change in the levels of poverty across different levels of a variable, without a change to
the functional form of the distribution. This implies that it is defensible to talk about the
patterned relationship between MDP and that variable in a comparative sense using
either model, so long as numerical comparisons of poverty are avoided. The third class
consists of variables for which both the level and the overall shape of the distribution
of MDP across levels of a given variable change markedly between models P and P+I.
For this group, the extra dimensions and information included in model P+I are highly
correlated with other variables in model P, introducing bias when they are omitted and
fundamentally altering the conclusions reached about the relationship between that
variable and overall MDP.
This process yields a determination about which of these three conditions holds for each
key variable. If the first holds, then one can generalize about both levels and patterns for
285

R. bras. Est. Pop., Rio de Janeiro, v. 30, n. 1, p. 271-297, jan./jun. 2013
that variable across contexts. If only the second is true, some generalizations across context
still make sense, but only those that pertain to general patterns. Generalizations about the
level of poverty in this case are unreliable because the estimates of poverty levels are highly
sensitive to the inclusion or exclusion of factors that are highly specific to that single context.
If the third obtains, no generalizations are warranted, as both the level and the pattern of
relationships between specific variables. In this case, additional qualitative investigation
is called for to understand how the intersection of dimensions affects the overall poverty
experience (LAWSON; MCCKAY; OKIDI, 2006).

Model fit
Table 2 reports fit statistics for each model. It is important that we confirm the
improved fit of model P for both contexts according to the AIC. Decreased model fit in
the higher-information model indicates that idiomatic information for each context is not
adding valuable additional explanatory power to the selected indicators available in both
contexts (that is, in model P). In substantive terms, model P+I represents a redundant
set of estimates in comparison with model P, adding an excessive amount of information
to the core of compared measures. This redundancy arises from two main sources of
noise: a) imperfect proxies for a specific dimension; b) the existence of a more complex
correlation structure between the shared and unique measures within context that is
not being fully represented by the empirical measures, requiring qualitative scrutiny. To
better understand the numerical nature of this degradation as additional information is
added, we look at what happens to the estimates for each of the FGT measures and the
two inequality measures.

Comparing levels of MDP and inequality
Figure 4 presents estimates for the FGT measures by model and context. In Nang Rong,
head count poverty estimates jumps from 20 percent to 23 percent when one moves from
the idiomatic to the plenary model. Despite the change in absolute terms, the proportion
of poor is quite similar for both models. In Altamira, the same jump is more substantial ­
from 22 to 34 percent, implying that idiomatic measures may have a greater influence on
estimates of poverty in Altamira than in Nang Rong.The same pattern is seen with the PGI and
squared-PGI. As previously suggested, the sensitivity to levels and patterns may be reflective
of various sources of noise: a) imperfect proxies, b) more complex correlational structure of
dimensions than the one expressed by the survey-based measures. A similar result obtains
for the Gini and L Theil measures of inequality, except that the greater increase from model
P+I to model P occurs in Nang Rong, where inequality on the Gini measures jumps from
0.24 to 0.33 when one moves to the lower information model. The corresponding jump in
Altamira is from 0.22 to 0.26.
Based on the AIC coupled with results from Figure 4 and Figure 5, we can conclude that
use of model P will lead to a more efficient, parsimonious, and conservative picture of poverty
and inequality, since it satisfactorily summarizes the structure of well-being with the shared
measures, at the same time that it avoids bias from limited information about the source of
idiomatic noise. The sensitivity test supports our stated intention of determining whether any
conclusionsaboutpovertyanditsassociationwithspecificfactorsofinterestmaybewarranted
across multiple contexts. The potential for interaction between context-specific indicators of
poverty and our overall measure renders the comparison of models containing substantially
different idiomatic measures potentially suspect, a classic apples-to-oranges comparison if
ever there was one.

Distributions of MDP over the range of select variables
Figure 6 presents the distribution of our summary MDP measure across a set of five
variables selected for their correspondence to the five capitals identified in the sustainable
livelihoods framework ­ financial capital, physical capital, natural capital, social capital,
and human capital (BEBBINGTON, 1997; 1999; CARNEY, 1998; DE SHERBININ et al.,
2008). These selected variables enable us to take a rapid summary view across each of
these five capitals in two contexts and observe the extent to which the choice of model
impacts the observed relationship. Generally Figure 6 provides little support for the
conclusion that interpreting the lower-information model (gray lines) would result in a
288 R. bras. Est. Pop., Rio de Janeiro, v. 30, n. 1, p. 271-297, jan./jun. 2013

different set of interpretations from those obtained using the optimal model (black lines).
In some instances, as with natural capital measure in Altamira, we do observe a shift in
the estimated level of poverty for each quintile group. But the shift occurs across the
board and appears to show no more complicated interaction with this measure of area
used for agriculture.
The observation that the functional forms of MDP distributions across variables are
consistent between models permits us to interpret these patterns substantively. One piece of
contextual information that is extremely relevant for interpreting these results in both sites
is that the Nang Rong study site occupies a later stage of a general frontier transition than
the Altamira research area (VANWEY; HULL; GUEDES, 2013). Interpreting the present results
in light of this observation, natural capital displays a simple monotonic positive relationship
with well-being (proxied by area in agriculture). This is consistent with a broad literature
citing the significance of natural capital in frontier contexts. Physical capital as proxied by
irrigation investments shows a similar relationship, with households that possess irrigation
equipment showing lower levels of MDP. Moving to social capital as proxied by the number
of migrants remitting cash or goods, however, we observe another interesting difference.
While households with more migrants display a greater level of multidimensional well-being
in Nang Rong, those households in Altamira with the greatest level of well-being occupy an
intermediate set of values on the number of remitting migrants. The data suggest important
differences in the significance and success of migration as a strategy for poverty alleviation
in these two sites, with Nang Rong presenting a more mature and integrated frontier with
greater opportunities for migrants. Discrepant patterns are likewise evident across sites for
financial capital (per capita income) and human capital (education attainment of household
head). While each incremental increase in the quintile of per capita income is associated
with a reduction in the proportion poor for Nang Rong, in Altamira the association takes a
curvilinear form. Among households in the lowest quintile of financial capital we observe
lower overall levels of MDP than for the next two higher quintiles. This observation again
speaks to the youth of this frontier context, in which it is possible for households to achieve
well-being in the absence of large stocks of financial capital.
We can conduct the same sort of analysis using a second set of measures that
roughly proxy a variety of significant livelihood strategies in both contexts. As with
Figure 6, we are limited to the plenary set of indicators. From this set, we selected four
theoretically interesting livelihood practices and one additional measure that proxies
the stage of the household lifecycle (MCCRAKEN et al., 2002). These four livelihood
practices ­ off-farm labor, operation of a small business or market stall, livestock raising
(large stock like cattle), and participation in the monetized labor exchange economy
rather than relying upon in-kind exchange ­ represent prominent (and often interlocking)
strands in complex and diverse livelihoods in both the Thailand and Brazil study site, but are
not exhaustive. In Nang Rong, perhaps even more than Altamira, households engage in a
289

wide array of occupations, pursuits, and enterprises directed at obtaining greater well-being
(THOMAS, 1988; GRANDSTAFF, 1992; HULL, 2007). Gaining a complete picture of household
livelihoods is challenging because of the temporary and fleeting nature of some livelihood
practices (RIGG, 2003), but where the impact of livelihood diversity on development has been
examined, the effect of greater diversity has been positive in contexts similar to Altamira and
Nang Rong that are or were historically agricultural (ELLIS, 1998). The long-term investment
required to successfully incorporate these practices in a household livelihood strategy and
the involvement of multiple broad capital classes in their execution makes them useful as
indicators. As one example, the use of paid labor for the rice harvest in Nang Rong requires
numerous adjustments by households who must acquire sufficient cash for payments, setting
them on a very different path of household labor allocation, economic activity, and livelihood
compatibility than those exchanging labor in kind (HULL, 2010).

A broad pattern of consistency across models is observable with these livelihood
measures, suggesting that generalizations about the relationship of overall MDP with these
selected indicators are again supported. We do, however, observe changes in the level
of estimated poverty across the range of many of these variables, making it necessary to
restrict the interpretation to statements about the general pattern of association between
each livelihood strategy and overall MDP if we want to be conservative. All four livelihood
factors ­ involvement in off-farm employment, ownership of a small business, participation
in livestock raising, and the use of monetized agricultural labor ­ represent alternatives
to a traditional smallholder subsistence livelihood. Thus, it comes as no surprise that we
observe a comparative reduction in MDP among households that are involved in these
livelihoods in both Thailand and Brazil. In each case, the effect of including additional
information in model P+I is to attenuate slightly the magnitude of this improvement,
suggesting that a more nuanced measure of poverty reveals additional routes to well-being
compared to a more limited measure. A similar pattern is apparent in Nang Rong, though
the degree of the mitigation is slighter. The demographic dependency ratio, our proxy of
household lifecycle stage, displays a consistent pattern of increasing MDP levels as the
share of dependents relative to working age individuals increases. However, the greatest
decline in well-being associated with dependency ratio occurs at lower levels in Nang Rong
than in Altamira, indicative of contextual differences in how such demographic burdens
translate into poverty.
In all, differences across contexts may be reflective of multiple causes: context, levels of
commensurability and monetization, protectedvalues, stage of frontier development. Rather
than a causal model of MDP, our proposal methodology, empirically illustrated with two
agricultural frontiers located in different time scales over frontier development, represents

a way to picture overall differences and similarities that can only be fully understood by a
deeper exercise of contextual characterization. In any circumstance MDP summary measures
can be meaningfully compared without a close eye on temporal and spatial characterization
of the territories of poverty and inequality.
Discussion and conclusions
We have presented a frameworkfor comparison of micro-level MDP across different social
and economic contexts. Our systematic approach enables researchers to compare relative
MDP levels among households in settings where the constituent elements of household well-
being may not be identical, as long as there is some shared set of common measures. With our
methodological strategy, researchers compare a model that uses the full extent of information
about each locale to a more limited model that can support useful comparative inferences. We
believe our approach innovates in three important ways: 1) by deriving a synthetic scalar of
well-beingfrommulti-thematicsurveydataatthelocallevel,takingabottom-uplikeperspective
on how families experience deprivation in its multiple dimensions; 2) by rendering an MDP
measure robust to cross-contextual comparisons, and 3) by providing an alternative to other
proposed scalars at the household/family level, such as the Family Development Index(FDI) or
theHuman PovertyIndex(HPI),thatdo notexplicitlyincorporateabuilt-insensitivityanalysisor
cross-site comparison and are tied to the arbitrariness of a weighting structure of dimensions.
Our methodological strategy is not intended to replace existing approaches to poverty
measurement and analysis (what we term depth and breadth approaches), but rather to
provide researcherswith a meansofmaking meaningfulhigh-information comparisonsacross
relevant contexts of interest. Because our method incorporates built-in sensitivity analyses,
it helps direct attention to the nuances and qualifications that are often necessary when
making valid cross-contextual comparative statements.
Our primary concern in this paper has not been the explanation of poverty, or even simply
the measurement of poverty, though both of these are related. Instead, we have attempted to
open the door to improved studies of the influence of context on poverty measurements. As
we have shown, such cross-contextualcomparisons can providevaluable generalizationsthat
support both policy refinements and the development of other types of theory. In particular,
our emphasis on the returns to various sorts of assets, whether human capital, physical
capital, social capital, or others, advances ongoing efforts to characterize development and
household well-being in frontier contexts, especially in tropical and subtropical regions. Our
approach allows us to gauge in a more precise, quantitative way the strength of comparative
statements about MDP, explicitly addressing strategies to deal with commensurability and
comparability under contextual, idiomatic noise.
Our approach also encourages researchers to use site-specific knowledge derived from
multiple methods ­ quantitative and qualitative ­ to inform the process of constructing MDP
measures rather than relying solely on data reduction techniques. While this may seem at

first glance to open the door wider to subjective bias, we argue that the present approach
to MDP is already rife with subjectivity which becomes readily apparent when one attempts
comparative work. Judgmentisroutinelyexercisedanytime research foci are chosen, measures
are selected, or concepts are mapped onto indicators. While the most effective strategy for
achieving better comparative measurement of MDP must obviously include systematization
of these earliest stages of research planning and execution, particularly between studies, a
pragmatic approach is also needed in the present moment that enables researchers to take
advantage of the many large datasets already in existence. Vital to the usefulness of any
such approach is that it must focus attention directly on the limitations of existing sources
of data and indicators used in assessing MDP, which our approach does explicitly, opening
the door wider to the high-information comparative study of MDP cross-contextually while
preserving scientific integrity.

Resumo
Reconstruindo Babel: comparando o bem-estar multidimensional de diferentes contextos
culturais em busca de soluções comuns para o desenvolvimento
Com base na tradição teórica relativa a estratégias de sobrevivência e portfólios de capitais, propõe-se
uma adaptação e combinação de metodologias existentes para análise do bem-estar em domicílios
rurais, com especial atenção à comparação entre diferentes contextos. Em primeiro lugar, estimou-se
uma medida multidimensional de pobreza, baseada em lógica nebulosa, para duas áreas de fronteira
agrícola: Nang Rong, na Tailândia, e Altamira, no Brasil. Para que a comparação entre os contextos
fosse possível, uma segunda estimativa foi obtida, utilizando-se um subconjunto das medidas
presentes nas duas áreas de estudo. Os resultados sugerem que o padrão de resposta em relação a
várias características-chave ­ por exemplo, educação, renda e razão de dependência demográfica ­ é
robusto à especificação do modelo. Conclui-se que generalizações comparativas, úteis na formulação
de políticas públicas que sejam custo-eficientes quanto à intervenção em contextos distintos, poderiam
ser identificadas em diversas situações. Mais genericamente, a presente abordagem fornece aos
pesquisadores e gestores de políticas um arcabouço que possibilite entender a interação do contexto
com a construção subjetiva de bem-estar. A compreensão dessa interação é útilpara distinguir corolários
estáveis de pobreza daqueles que são voláteis em contextos distintos.
