Learning to read has long been held as a necessary ingredient
for success in school and in life. Starting children on the path
to reading begins early. Children learn about the function and
process of reading long before they pick up a book and
decode the text. These early skills, known as Emergent
Literacy (EL), include the knowledge and abilities related to
the alphabet, phonological awareness, symbolic representa-
tion, and communication. The comprehension of these con-
cepts builds over time beginning when children are very
young, typically between birth and age 5. The idea of EL was
introduced by Marie Clay (1966) in the 1960s. It developed
further in the 1980s to challenge the then-current notion that
children were not ready to become literate until reaching a
specific point in time, determined by the child's age and
maturity (Fosnot, 2013; Razfar & Gutiérrez, 2003; Yaden,
Rowe, & MacGillivray, 2000). Since then, EL has been rec-
ognized as a vital content area in preschool curriculum, with
a strong research base supporting its use (Blank, 2012;
Connor, Morrison, & Slominsk, 2006; Watson & Wildy,
2014).
Existing models of EL tell only part of the story; they
focus on discrete skills but without a perspective of the envi-
ronment surrounding them. Yet, understanding these skills of
EL--along with how they relate to one another--and recog-
nizing the importance of the setting and context, is critical in
ensuring that children gain all of the preliminary skills and
awareness they will need to become successful readers and
writers. Research findings since the development of early
models of EL have led to a fuller appreciation of the com-
plexities of EL, resulting in a need for the new, more compre-
hensive model introduced here. The new model, described in
this article strives to explain how EL can be viewed as an
interactive process rather than simply a series of individual
components ( Rohde, 2011).
The concept of EL evolved through the 1980s and 1990s
and is now recognized as a combination of developmentally
appropriate practice (DAP; Copple & Bredekamp, 2009)
with an intentional focus on providing opportunities for chil-
dren to learn about literacy (International Reading

The Comprehensive Emergent Literacy
Model: Early Literacy in Context
Leigh Rohde1
Abstract
The early skills of Emergent Literacy include the knowledge and abilities related to the alphabet, phonological awareness,
symbolic representation, and communication. However, existing models of emergent literacy focus on discrete skills and
miss the perspective of the surrounding environment. Early literacy skills, including their relationship to one another,
and the substantial impact of the setting and context, are critical in ensuring that children gain all of the preliminary skills and
awareness they will need to become successful readers and writers. Research findings over the last few decades have led
to a fuller understanding of all that emergent literacy includes, resulting in a need for a new, more comprehensive model.
A new model, described in this article, strives to explain how emergent literacy can be viewed as an interactive process of
skills and context rather than a linear series of individual components. Early literacy learning opportunities are more likely
to happen when teachers have a solid knowledge base of emergent literacy and child development. Research has shown that
preschool teachers with limited knowledge about literacy development are significantly less able to provide such experiences
for children. Teachers will be better able to facilitate all of the components of emergent literacy if they have access to, and
understanding of, a model that describes the components, their interactions, and the importance of environmental factors
in supporting children.

2 SAGE Open
Young Children, 1998). DAP is a research-based framework
of practices used to design educational experiences for young
children. It serves as a foundation for the work of the National
Association for the Education of Young Children (Copple &
Bredekamp, 2009). However, research has shown that
although there is strong evidence of the effectiveness of EL
support and instruction, it is rarely practiced in early child-
hood programs (Powell, Diamond, & Koehler, 2009). In
addition, research has shown that some Early Childhood
Education (ECE) professionals are limited in their awareness
and knowledge of EL (LoCasale-Crouch et al., 2007; Powell,
Diamond, Bojczyk, & Gerde, 2008) and that little instruction
in EL, or any of the individual components of EL, is happen-
ing in preschool classrooms (Justice, Mashburn, Hamre, &
Pianta, 2008). There is clearly a gap between research and
practice of EL in ECE programs. This disparity may be due
to a lack of resources or knowledge in providing high-quality
EL learning opportunities in ECE classrooms.
Many early childhood educators have recognized the
importance of providing more explicit instruction for their
students asking for training and support (Dickinson &
Caswell, 2007; Nitecki & Chung, 2013; Winsler & Carlton,
2003). Recent work by Nitecki and Chung (2013) also indi-
cate tension between teaching EL, using DAP, and address-
ing the new curriculum standards. These challenges may, at
least in part, be attributed to a lack of educators' understand-
ing of how these factors can work in harmony. Early literacy
learning opportunities are more likely to happen when teach-
ers have a solid knowledge base of EL and child develop-
ment. Conversely, preschool teachers with limited knowledge
about literacy development are significantly less able to pro-
vide such experiences for children (Burgess et al., 2001;
Dickinson, Freiberg, & Barnes, 2011; Justice et al., 2008).
Teachers will be better able to facilitate all of the components
of EL if they have access to--and comprehension of--a
model that describes the components, the interaction between
the components, and the importance of environmental fac-
tors in supporting children. This article describes such a
model.
This article will first review the history and current mod-
els of EL. Next, the comprehensive emergent literacy model
(CELM) will be introduced and described, illustrating the
important interactions between these components. The con-
text of EL learning will be explained and its importance to
learning will be considered. Finally, potential uses of the
model, both in professional development and the lives of
young children, will be discussed.
Early Research in EL
Much of the early research in EL provided support for the
proposition that "growth in writing and reading comes from
within the child as a result of environmental stimulation . . .
the growth that has been observed occurs without the neces-
sity for formal teaching" (Teale & Sulzby, 1986, p. xx). Yet,
a close look at this research reveals that children's ability to
develop EL skills depends on their access to rich literacy
experiences and expert partners from whom they can learn
(Connor et al., 2006; Dickinson & Sprague, 2001; Gayan &
Olson, 2001; Morrow, 1990). This preliminary research was
centered on how children build knowledge and skills about
literacy starting very early in life. EL is founded on the the-
ory that literacy emerges from children before they are for-
mally taught to read. In addition, its definition goes beyond
decoding--encompasses the processes of reading, writing,
speaking, and listening. The child's point of view and active
involvement with literacy constructs are highlighted during
EL learning; similarly, the social setting in which children
are learning about literacy is addressed (Mason & Sinha,
1993).
The initial work on the social implications of communica-
tion and literacy was built on the conceptual framework of
EL. During the first half of the 1980s, EL researchers joined
together to challenge the traditional way of thinking about
the way children gain literacy skills (Teale & Sulzby, 1987).
Research emphasized two basic trends: first, a focus on the
cognitive processes that influence learning; and second, a
renewed research interest in the sequencing of children's
development (Fosnot, 2013; Teale & Sulzby, 1987). A care-
ful examination of young children and their development led
these researchers to a new way of thinking about children
learning literacy.
Early research resulted in a pendulum shift away from a
maturationist view of "attaining literacy" as a construct and
toward a more "academic" approach to early literacy (Gesell,
1925; Morphett & Washburne, 1931; Teale & Sulzby, 1987).
Some educators and others claimed that the naturalistic and
maturational view of EL--in which the teaching approach
was to wait for children to develop--resulted in a delay or
lack of direct instruction. The outcome was many children
failing to learn to read, or at least failing to gain the necessary
early literacy knowledge to be successful in early elementary
school (Durkin, 1978; Gates & Bond, 1936; Shea, 2011).
This realization by researchers and early childhood educa-
tors acknowledged a need for a different approach to literacy
learning for young children.
Early Models of EL
Two models are found in the research literature that concep-
tualize the common skills related to early perceptions of lit-
eracy prior to conventional literacy and their relationship to
one another (Sénéchal, LeFevre, Smith-Chant, & Colton,
2001). The two, the outside-in, inside-out model and the
four-component model, include language development as
part of EL and are described in detail below.
Rohde 3
Outside-In, Inside-Out Model
Whitehurst and Lonigan's (1998) model of EL describes two
interdependent domains ("Outside-In" and "Inside-out") of
processes and skills. It is represented as a continuum with the
knowledge of context at one end and understanding of rules
of letters and their sounds at the other. The term Outside-In
processes is used to describe conceptual knowledge, such as
the function of print, particularly in the context of narrative.
Children's processing of the overall text, according to the
authors, is where the "understanding of the context in which
they are trying to read (or write) occurs" (p. 854). Whitehurst
and Lonigan recognized that "comprehension of all but the
simplest of writing depends on knowledge that cannot be
found in the word or sentence itself" (p. 854). The outside-in
end of the literacy continuum recognizes that reading is inef-
fective without comprehension strategies, including the use
of background knowledge, to decipher the message of the
writer to the reader.
The term Inside-Out processes describes procedural
knowledge related to skills of literacy. This includes under-
standing how to match the smallest components of literacy,
sounds, and print units (e.g., letters) together, moving toward
larger units of words (Sénéchal et al., 2001).
The outside-in, inside-out model is a continuum of skills
and concepts. In the middle of the model are "language
units" (e.g., words) that demonstrate the merger of skills
(e.g., putting letters and sounds together into words) and
conceptual knowledge (e.g., inferring meaning from text).
Whitehurst and Lonigan (1998) posited that to successfully
transition into conventional reading, children must have both
procedural and conceptual skills of literacy.
Four-Component Model
A second model, developed by Mason and Stewart (1990),
also includes both conceptual and procedural knowledge of
EL learning. The four-component model consists of four
blocks: (a) concepts and functions of literacy, (b) writing and
composing, (c) knowledge about letters and words, and (d) lis-
tening comprehension and word understanding (Sénéchal et
al., 2001). Concepts and functions of literacy are the broad
understandings and behaviors related to reading and writing.
These do not include specific skills but rather an overarching
perception of literacy. For instance, children understand that
print is static and remains consistent over time. The writing
and composing component focuses on words and sentences in
terms of composition, but not specific letter formation or
"drawing." Knowledge about letters and words includes
alphabet knowledge and phonological awareness, including
letter­sound relationships. This component comprises much
more specific knowledge and skills than the first two compo-
nents. Last, listening comprehension and word understanding
relates to language, specifically narrative knowledge and
vocabulary.
The four-component model contains the broad, overarch-
ing concepts of literacy (e.g., that print carries meaning), as
they are interpreted by young children. It also includes spe-
cific skills that young children learn about text, language,
and the intricacies of literacy (i.e., the shapes of letters).
However, each of the four blocks is presented individually
with little mention by the author of how the components
interact with one another.
Both models have similar EL components although they
are presented in different orientations. They both include
conceptual knowledge about the function of reading and
writing, beginning procedural knowledge of how literacy
works, oral language skills, including vocabulary, and meta-
linguistic skills such as phonological awareness (Sénéchal et
al., 2001). In addition, both models include the importance of
considering knowledge beyond EL skills, for instance, back-
ground knowledge and awareness of semantics (e.g., the
meanings of language) and pragmatics (e.g., the situational
context of language).
The Development of EL Skills
Each individual component of EL is comprised of complex
developmental sequences. EL has been referred to as a devel-
opmental continuum (Sénéchal et al., 2001; Teale & Sulzby,
1987; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 2001) but research suggests
that, additionally, each component of EL is on its own trajec-
tory of development and the components are not strictly
related to one another as part of a consecutive sequence
(Clay, 1998; McGee & Richgels, 2003). Researchers have
long recognized and documented that young children develop
oral language skills using consistent patterns and sequences
(von Tetzchner, Merete Brekke, Sjothun, & Grindheim,
2005). Phonological awareness skill development follows a
sequence as well, with rhyming and alliteration as the begin-
ning and segmenting and blending phonemes later on
(Goswami, 2001). Similarly, children's emergent writing
develops through a series of stages from scribbling to pseu-
doletters to inventive spelling (Sulzby, 1989). There is not
one clear path of EL development but rather a series of asso-
ciated and concurrent experiences that result in the building
of knowledge and skills related to the literacy process. For
instance, a child's emergent writing development may be
enhanced by, though not necessarily dependent on, his or her
level of phonological awareness. Recognizing these stages of
development within each component of EL is important in
providing appropriate learning opportunities and scaffolded
support.
The two recognized models (Mason & Stewart, 1990;
Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998), described above, do not
address the complexities of EL. Based on new research, a
4 SAGE Open
comprehensive model of EL is proposed. It describes each of
the components of EL, the interrelationships between the
components, and the importance of culture and community.
A New Model of EL
The CELM goes beyond a set of skills to bring four addi-
tional considerations to these existing models: (a) Each EL
component has its own developmental sequence; (b) each
component supports the development of other components
as part of a holistic appreciation, rather than in a linear way
as found in early models; (c) the importance of recognizing
the environment in which children and their families live;
and (d) this model connects EL components with the recom-
mendations of three national authorities on ECE and EL
learning. These distinctive aspects of CELM provide clarity
to the value of each EL component as well as the interactive
nature of the components.
Three national organizations have provided published
guidelines and recommendations of strategies to promote EL
learning in preschoolers that were used in the development
of the CELM. In 1998, the International Reading Association
and the National Association for the Education of Young
Children produced a joint position statement on EL
(International Reading Association & The National
Association for the Education of Young Children, 1998).
Thisdocument,LearningtoReadandWrite:Developmentally
Appropriate Practices for Young Children, is still dissemi-
nated widely as a reputable source of recommended prac-
tices. The third organization, Head Start, released their Child
Outcomes framework containing recommendations for all
areas of child development, including EL learning
(Administration on Children, Youth and Families/Head Start
Bureau, 2001). Each of these organizations' guidelines was
used as a means to evaluate the soundness of this new model
of EL.
The CELM represents all of the components of EL in a
Venn diagram of circles (see the appendix) set in a context of
environmental indicators. The intersections and overlaps of
the model demonstrate the holistic nature of EL learning for
young children. As is true for all children's learning, EL is
best learned, and understood, as knowledge that affects all
parts of a young child's life. The CELM illustrates a different
way of looking at the contexts children live in, and the skills
and understandings they gain as they move toward conven-
tional literacy.
The CELM model is loosely based on the work of James
Cunningham (1993) and his Whole-to-Part Literacy
Assessment. This assessment focuses on three components of
reading. Each component is a distinct and separate ability that
is necessary for successful reading; each component is also
made up of parts that can be assessed to determine why chil-
dren may be struggling to learn to read. The three components
are (a) Word Identification, (b) Listening Comprehension,
and (c) Silent Reading Comprehension. Each component
consists of specific skills that emergent readers must learn
and understand before they can acquire conventional
literacy.
The CELM model contains three similar components,
each a precursor to the components listed above. First, print
awareness leads to word identification. Print awareness
includes alphabet knowledge and concepts of print (e.g.,
book handling skills). Second, phonological awareness is
closely related to listening comprehension. Phonological
awareness includes skills like rhyming and segmenting
sounds. The third component, oral language, leads to silent
reading comprehension. Oral language includes under-
standing and using vocabulary, background knowledge,
and semantics. There are also skills that overlap these com-
ponents. Print awareness and phonological awareness over-
lap with skills such as understanding the relationship
between letters and sounds and inventive spelling. The
overlap between oral language and print awareness includes
skills like using grammar and understanding syntax. The
overlap between oral language and phonological awareness
includes skills related to lexical restructuring, a mental
organization of words using sounds rather than the meaning
of words.
In addition, the CELM recognizes and emphasizes the
relationship and the overlap of skills and knowledge between
the major components.Afourth component, writing, includes
all of the pieces of the model. Writing has a strong reciprocal
relationship with the other three components (Teale &
Sulzby, 1987). The skills of composition and the mechanics
of writing support the skills of language development, print
awareness, and phonological awareness. These components
are also critical in supporting the development of the skills
and conventions related to the writing process.
Writing is situated in the center of the model as it is where
children can often demonstrate their knowledge of literacy
concepts. Through emergent writing, children can manipu-
late alphabet letters, word choice, and letter/sound relation-
ship in authentic and purposeful ways. Creating their own
messages and stories, children can create deeper awareness
of the components more closely related to reading. Writing is
where all the pieces come together and are used to produce a
new message--The children are now the initiators of literacy
rather than the receivers.
The components of EL include the skills that children
develop prior to conventional reading and writing as well as
the conceptual knowledge of print and how it functions.
There is some debate as to the specific skills to be included
in EL (Sénéchal et al., 2001). It is universally understood that
the theory of EL promotes learning literacy as a process
(Guo, Justice, Kaderavek, & McGinty, 2012; Helland, Tjus,
Hovden, Ofte, & Heimann, 2011; Lanter, Watson, Erickson,
& Freeman, 2012; Sylva, Melhuish, Sammons, Siraj-
Blatchford, & Taggart, 2010; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 2001).
Rohde 5
In the next section, the four specific components of EL are
described, as illustrated in the CELM, and cited by the major
documents described above.
Language Development
Oral language development is a critical aspect of literacy
learning (Roskos, Tabors, & Lenhart, 2004; Whitehurst
&Lonigan, 2001). Children depend on language for social
interaction and communication, demonstration of ability and
knowledge, and acquiring new concepts (McGee & Richgels,
2003). A child's familiarity with language and vocabulary is
strongly linked to his or her later literacy success (Lane &
Wright, 2007). Despite the recognized importance, opportu-
nities for children to develop oral language skills can be lim-
ited in preschool (Snow, Burns, & Griffin, 1998; Tabors, &
Snow, 2001). This may be due to curriculum or instructional
decisions made by educators, such as requiring children to
raise their hands before speaking or teachers primarily ask-
ing yes/no questions of their students.
Researchers have suggested that there is a need to con-
sider a wider range of oral language skills, beyond vocabu-
lary and phonological awareness, to better understand the
connection between oral language and literacy (Roth, Speece,
& Cooper, 2002; Traw, 1993). In their research, Roth et al.
(2002) concluded that the variables associated with early oral
language development provided an initial advantage in gain-
ing conventional literacy skills. However, much of that
advantage could be mediated by effective instruction in both
oral language development and early literacy skills.
Phonological Awareness
Phonological awareness is the ability to detect, identify, and
manipulate the sound structure of language, along with being
one of the strongest predictors of later reading success
(DeBaryshe & Gorecki, 2007; Dickinson, McCabe,
Anastasopoulos, Peisner-Feinberg, & Poe, 2003; Ehri et al.,
2001). The importance of acquiring phonological awareness
cannot be overstated. It is closely linked with most specific
learning disabilities in reading (Brady & Shankweiler, 2013;
Melby-Lervåg, Lyster, & Hulme, 2012). There is great sig-
nificance in a child's awareness of the relationship between
letters and sounds; according to Adams, it has very strong
"predictive power" to identify students who may struggle
with learning to read (Adams, 1998, p. 2). As Goswami
(2001) determined, awareness of phonemes may need to be
directly taught to some children as they may not develop that
skill on their own.
Demonstrating the concept of rhyme is seen as the first
indicator of phonological awareness in young children
(Justice & Pullen, 2003). Rhyming, for many children, is the
first time they shift their focus from the meaning of words to
the sounds of language (Goswami, 2001). This may be dif-
ficult for some children as "this sensitivity to the sounds of
the phonemes and the differences between them is not con-
scious. It is deeply imbedded in the subattentional machin-
ery of the language system" (Adams, 1998, p. 3). It is not
automatic for some children to discriminate between the
sound of language from the meanings of words (Goswami,
2001), perhaps because most children learn language as
communication first and only later learn to attend to the
sounds.
Lexical Restructuring--Overlap Between Oral
Language and Phonological Awareness
The reorganization of language by sound rather than by defi-
nition requires children to know about oral language as well
as phonological awareness. This new type of organization
has been referred to as "lexical restructuring" in the research
(Stadler, Watson, & Skahan, 2007; Walley, Metsala, &
Garlock, 2003). Lexical restructuring "is based on the prem-
ise that in the normal course of development, children's pho-
nological representations become increasingly segmental
and distinctly specified in terms of phonetic features with
age" (Goswami, 2001, p. 113). It is represented in the CELM
graphic as the overlap between the language and phonologi-
cal awareness components.
There is great interest in determining why some children
have difficulty gaining phonological awareness, primarily
because it relates so closely to later reading success (Anthony,
et al., 2011; Duff, Hayiou-Thomas, & Hulme, 2012). It could
be argued that children with speech and language disabilities
struggle because of limited vocabulary rather than an inabil-
ity to learn to distinguish between the sounds of language. If
a major premise of the theory of lexical restructuring is that
children's ability to build this organizational structure
depends on the size of their vocabulary, particularly spoken
words, it follows that children with limited vocabularies,
because of oral language disabilities, will have further diffi-
culty building a system of phonemes and morphemes.
Further research in examining the phonological awareness
skills of children with oral language disabilities who have
access to high levels of receptive and expressive vocabulary
could provide insight to this query.
Print Awareness
Print Awareness is typically divided into the two primary cat-
egories of alphabet knowledge and concepts of print. Both
categories contribute to awareness of how written language
is constructed and used.
Alphabet knowledge.Becoming literate depends both on
knowledge of language and an understanding of text systems
6 SAGE Open
and symbols. In the English language, the foundation of text is
based on the 26 letters of the alphabet. Alphabet knowledge
consists of being able to recognize and name letters (Foulin,
2005), identify the sounds of letters (Invernizzi & Purcell,
2003), produce the letters (Stachoviak, 1996), and match text
letters with their sounds (Invernizzi & Purcell, 2003; Juel,
Griffith, & Gough, 1986). Specifically, the alphabetic princi-
ple, "the basic concept that letters represent segments of their
own speech" (Moats, 2000, p. 10), refers to written letters and
their corresponding phonemes. Letter name knowledge has
also been shown to be a strong predictor of later reading suc-
cess in multiple studies over the past two decades (Foulin,
2005). It is a critical skill in acquiring the alphabetic princi-
ple (Adams, 2001).
Concepts of print.The term "Concepts of Print" refers to a
knowledge base about print and how it works (Strickland &
Schickedanz, 2004). These concepts range from appreciating
that print has different functions and that print carries a mes-
sage to knowing the differences between words and letters.
As with phonological awareness and alphabet knowledge,
concepts of print comprehension follow a basic developmen-
tal continuum. Acquiring the concepts of words involves
beginning phonological awareness along with alphabet
knowledge by learning to separate speech into words and to
match sounds with letters (Mason & Allen, 1986).
Comprehension Strategies--Overlap Between
Oral Language and Print Awareness
Print awareness relates to oral language learning with regard
to syntax, grammar, and the similarities and differences
between the spoken and written word. Comprehension strat-
egies of predicting, inferring, and reasoning are used both
when listening and reading. Children learn that the setting
and context matters when they are speaking and reading.
Code-Based Knowledge--Overlap Between
Phonological Awareness and Print Awareness
Phonological awareness and alphabet knowledge are both
used in code-based knowledge (Connor et al., 2006). Phonics,
the later developing skill of matching letters with their
sounds, is the first step in learning to decode text. Decoding
requires knowledge of the alphabet and the sounds of
language.
Writing
Emergent writing, or a child's first attempt to put marks on
paper to create a message, begins long before any recogni-
tion of letters or words may be seen. At first, children are
simply realizing that making marks can create meaning.
Emergent writing is a process that requires the integration of
phonological awareness (being able to hear and isolate the
sounds of "bat" to /b/-/a/-/t/), print awareness (being aware
that text carries the message), and language (being aware
that the meanings of words portray a message). The seminal
work of Elizabeth Sulzby (1986) first illustrated that children
acquired many early writing skills and developed knowledge
about the process of writing long before they were conven-
tional readers. This was in direct opposition to how many
children were learning to write in the early elementary
grades. It is now understood that children can express their
awareness of EL through writing.
Emergent writing is supported by all the other compo-
nents of EL--language, print awareness, and phonological
awareness. Children move from writing primarily through
drawing and illustration, often accompanied by a spoken
description of their work, to the inclusion of letters (or pseu-
doletters) as they gain alphabet skills. These letters will
more closely represent words as children gain phonological
awareness and knowledge of letter­sound relationships.
Research has indicated that children who spend time writ-
ing, or in "code-focused activities," have higher levels of
alphabet knowledge and word recognition than children
who spent more time in "meaning focused activities"
(Connor et al., 2006). Other studies point out the literacy
skills children gain from writing activities during dramatic
play as a way to learn about the functions of print
(Einarsdottir, 1996). Through their grasp of early writing,
children deepen their awareness of the other components of
EL too.
Impact of Context on EL
The three, interlinked components are situated in the context
of culture, community, and demographics. A child's ability
to gain EL skills is influenced by these environmental fac-
tors as they dictate access to EL opportunities, the impor-
tance associated with EL, and the support children will
receive from people around them to learn about reading and
writing.
The previously described models (Mason & Stewart,
1990; Whitehurst & Lonigan, 1998) present children's EL as
a combination of conceptual knowledge (e.g., understanding
the functions of print and text and emerging [or "pretend"]
reading and writing), and procedural knowledge (e.g., match-
ing alphabet letters and their sounds and book handling
skills). However, recognition of the role of the environment,
and in particular social and cultural experiences, were not
well captured in the earlier models. Educators in the early
2000s realized the importance of the environment in ensur-
ing children had sufficient opportunities to interact with lit-
eracy. The learning environment could "support and extend
literacy" by providing activities as well as materials beyond
Rohde 7
just providing a place for this learning to occur (Roskos &
Neuman, 2001, p. 282).
In examining environmental factors on literacy skill
development, the role of culture and community must be
considered. There is a strong body of evidence describing the
correlations between social and cultural experiences and suc-
cess in school and learning to read and write (McLachlan,
2007; von Tetzchner, Brekke, & Sjothun, 2005). Pellegrini
(2001) argued that the role of social contexts, in particular
through relationships, is critical in developing "literate lan-
guage" in young children (p. 59). The seminal study of Hart
and Risley (1995) clearly demonstrated the effect of environ-
ment, particularly the impact of poverty, on language acqui-
sition and learning. Through these studies and others, the
role that the environment plays on EL is now recognized as
critical in supporting literacy growth in young children
(Fosnot, 2013).
EL is learned within a context of culture, community,
and demographics. As indicated in the CELM model, these
three constructs are important to consider as supports or
barriers to young children's access to EL learning experi-
ences. How early learning of literacy is viewed within the
culture of a child will have an impact on the availability
and acceptance of EL in that community. For instance, cul-
tures in which children are "seen and not heard," are likely
to provide fewer opportunities that encourage expressive
language skills. Similarly, a family that does not prioritize
reading, for any number of reasons, is less likely to have a
wide variety of children's books in the home. Outside the
child's immediate home, the community also influences
EL growth. Community refers to the surrounding neigh-
borhoods and the decisions made by local boards and orga-
nizations, such as the provision of toddler story hours at
the library or access to high-quality ECE programs.
Demographics reflect the background experiences and
lifestyles of both the children and their teachers. Each of
these constructs has an impact on children's abilities to
gain EL.
Practical Implications of the CELM
The CELM presented here provides a framework for teach-
ers, researchers, and other professionals to understand and
explore the components and contexts of EL in a comprehen-
sive and organized way. There are four practical uses for the
CELM model in ECE settings, two related to working with
young children, one for professional development, and one
for further research.
First, the CELM may be used as a way to structure ECE
curriculum and instruction. Consistent with recommended
practice in ECE, the CELM portrays a holistic view of how
children learn about the many parts of EL, including the
development of each part, which must be addressed.
Because the CELM sets the learning of EL skills and
knowledge in a culture and a community, it provides a con-
text to the learning. Second, it may be used in determining
areas of strength and need, through assessment of chil-
dren's use and recognition of EL skills. Students can be
assessed on individual components of EL to determine
where they may need additional support or experience. On
a larger scale, the CELM can be used to evaluate if the
child's home context is likely to support EL learning by
providing learning experiences in all areas of EL indicated
by the model.
Third, the CELM can serve as a format for providing
professional development to ECE teachers who need a
deeper knowledge of EL. Learning can focus on particular
components of EL or on the entire model depending on the
needs of the audience. Beyond the EL components, the
model provides a structure to help teachers learn how
to support students' learning in the classroom and
community.
Fourth, the model may also be used in guiding research
of not only the components of EL but also the relationship
between the components and how best to support young
children's learning. Because it describes each component,
the components' interaction with one another, and the set-
tings that impact learning, the CELM can provide a frame-
work to design research not only on how children learn
about EL but how that learning impacts their later school
success. It can also be used in research examining how a
teacher can best support children's learning. For example,
the structure of the model can help to examine the relation-
ship between teachers' efficacy and confidence in providing
EL learning opportunities and children's success in gaining
EL skills.
The CELM provides the fields of ECE and Literacy with
a new, evidence-based understanding of how young children
become literate. It incorporates not only the skills and under-
standing of the individual components of EL but also the
context in which children come to this knowledge. By pro-
viding ECE teachers with a clearer picture of EL, they will
be better able to provide learning opportunities that engage
children in gaining that emergent knowledge of letters,
words, and sounds. In turn, children will become successful
readers, writers, and learners.
