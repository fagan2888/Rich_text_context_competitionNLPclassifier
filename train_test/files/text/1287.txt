Abstract
Background: Thyroid hormone plays a crucial role in the growth and function of the central
nervous system. The purpose of the study was to examine the relationships between the status of
subclinical thyroid conditions and cognition among adolescents in the United States.
Methods: Study sample included 1,327 adolescents 13 to 16 years old who participated in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Serum thyroxine (T4) and
thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured and subclinical hypothyroidism, subclinical
hyperthyroidism, and euthyroid groups were defined. Cognitive performance was assessed using
the subscales of the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) and the Wechsler
Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised (WISC-R). The age-corrected scaled scores for arithmetic,
reading, block design, and digit span were derived from the cognitive assessments.
Results: Subclinical hypothyroidism was found in 1.7% and subclinical hyperthyroidism was found
in 2.3% of the adolescents. Cognitive assessment scores on average tended to be lower in
adolescents with subclinical hyperthyroidism and higher in those with subclinical hypothyroidism
than the score for the euthyroid group. Adolescents with subclinical hypothyroidism had
significantly better scores in block design and reading than the euthyroid subjects even after
adjustment for a number of variables including sex, age, and family income level.
Conclusion: Subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with better performance in some areas of
cognitive functions while subclinical hyperthyroidism could be a potential risk factor.
Background
Thyroid hormone plays a crucial role as a regulator of
nervous system myelination, of growth and puberty, and
of metabolism and organ functions [1]. It has been well
recognized that hypothyroidism at early stages of life,
such as congenital hypothyroidism, can cause various
abnormalities including mental retardation and delayed
myelination [2,3]. Disorders affecting the thyroid gland
represent the most common endocrine pathology in
childhood [4]. Pediatric Graves' disease, the most com-

mon cause of hyperthyroidism in children, can adversely
alter growth and development including poor weight gain
and hyperactivity [5].
Thyroid function disorder is a graded phenomenon. There
is mounting evidence to suggest that mild (subclinical)
thyroid disorders may be potential contributors to signif-
icant clinical conditions [6]. However, the relationship
between subclinical hypo-hyperthyroidism and cognition
among adolescents has been studied much less. In the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), serum total thyroxine (T4) and thyroid
stimulating hormone (TSH) were measured, and cogni-
tive function was assessed for adolescents 12 years or
older. Using the data from NHANES III, this study exam-
ined the relationship of subclinical hypo-hyperthy-
roidism with cognitive performance among adolescents
in the United States.
Methods
Data and study sample
Data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES III) were used for this study.
Using a stratified multi-stage probability sampling design,
NHANES III collected data representative of the non-insti-
tutionalized civilian U.S. population, aged two months or
older, in the 50 states and District of Columbia, 1988­
1994 (n = 39,695). Detailed information on the sample
design and operation of NHANES III can be found else-
where [7,8].
In the youth sample of NHANES III, there were 2,216 chil-
dren 12 to 16 years old at the time of the interview.
Among them, 1,444 (65.2%) had measurements of both
serum thyroxine and thyroid stimulating hormone. Ado-
lescents who did not participate in the cognitive assess-
ment were excluded from this study. One subject who
reported use of medication for thyroid disorder was also
excluded. Consequently, the sample used in this study
consists of 1,327 adolescents.
Variables of interest
T4 was the sum of the free and protein bound forms in
serum and measured by radioimmunoassay. The refer-
ence range of T4 was 4.5 to 13.2 µg/dL. Serum TSH was
measured by a chemiluminescence immunometric assay
utilizing a mouse monoclonal antibody to TSH immobi-
lized on a polystyrene bead and a goat polyclonal anti-
body to TSH conjugated with an acridinium ester. The
reference range of TSH was 0.39 to 4.6 mIU/L. The meas-
urements of T4 and TSH were detailed in NHANES III [9]
and elsewhere [10]. Hyperthyroidism was defined as clin-
ically significant if TSH <0.1 mIU/L and T4 > 13.2 µg/dl
and as subclinical when TSH <0.39 mIU/L and T4  13.2
µg/dl. Hypothyroidism was defined as clinically signifi-
cant if TSH > 10 mIU/L and T4 < 4.5 µg/dl and subclinical
when TSH > 4.6 mIU/L and T4  4.5 µg/dl.
Cognitive function was evaluated using the subsets of two
tests: the Wide Range Achievement Test ­ Revised (WRAT-
R) and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children ­
Revised (WISC-R) [11,12]. Two subsets of the WRAT-R
test, arithmetic and reading, were administered. Two sub-
sets of the WISC-R test, a verbal component (Digit Span)
and a performance exam (Block Design), were also
administered. The WISC-R test was administered first and
was followed by the WRAT-R test. Raw scores were
recorded. Standardized scores were determined using the
calculations provided in the WRAT-R and WISC-R manu-
als. The age-corrected scaled scores for the subsets, which
are comparable between WRAT-R and WISC-R, were pro-
vided in NHANES III data set and were analyzed in this
study. The cognitive assessments were performed accord-
ing to a standard protocol described in the NHANES III
documentation [13].
Other variables of interest included sex, race/ethnicity,
age, poverty income ratio, language used, and the exam-
iner who conducted the cognitive assessment. These vari-
ables were based on the operational definitions set forth
in the NHANES III. Race/ethnicity referred to the follow-
ing four categories as reported by the primary respondent
in the screening and family interview portion of the sur-
vey: non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic African American,
Mexican American, and other (i.e., Hispanics not of Mex-
ican origin or non-Hispanics from racial groups other
than white or African American). Age used in this study
referred to chronological age (in completed months) at
the time of the NHANES III examination and was con-
verted (divided by 12) to years for analysis. The poverty
income ratio was the ratio of the reported family incomes
divided by the poverty threshold, which is produced
annually by the Census Bureau and adjusted for changes
caused by inflation. The variable was categorized into <1,
1­2, >2, and a missing category was also created for anal-
ysis. Families were below the poverty line if their poverty
income ratios were less than one. In the cognitive assess-
ment, Spanish was used as alternative language to English.
Codes for the examiners who conducted the cognitive
assessment were recorded in the NHANES III data set.
Data analysis
Descriptive statistics including proportions and means
were used to describe the characteristics of the study sam-
ple. General linear models were used to compare mean
levels of cognitive assessment scores among adolescents
with the subclinical hyperthyroidism and with subclinical
hyperthyroidism to the mean score among the euthyroid
group. The cognitive assessment scores among the differ-
ent groups were further analyzed with adjustment for sex,

race/ethnicity, age, poverty income ratio, language used,
and examiner in the cognitive assessment by including
these variables in the models. To account for sampling
strategy, such as over-sampling and clustering in the
NHANES III, all the general linear models were performed
using SPSS Complex Samples (an add-on module for
SPSS for Windows) for complex sampling design with
application of the weights established for the NHANES III
exam sample [14].
The NHANES III data sets are accessible at the US Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's website. Because our
study was a secondary analysis of the data existing in the
public domain, it was exempt from review by the East Ten-
nessee State University Institutional Review Board. The
study was carried out in compliance with internationally
recognized guidelines on ethics.
Results
The study sample consisted of similar numbers of males
and females. For a small number of adolescents, cognitive
function was assessed in Spanish. African Americans,
Mexican Americans, and adolescents from low-income
families were over-represented in the sample as indicated
by the percentages (Table 1), reflecting the design feature
of NHANES III. A total of ten examiners performed the
cognitive assessments for the study sample.
Twenty two subjects (1.7%) were classified as having sub-
clinical hypothyroidism and 30 subjects (2.3%) as having
subclinical hyperthyroidism. There was no clinical hyper-
thyroidism or clinical hypothyroidism identified by our
criteria. Three subjects had TSH levels above 10 µg/dL but
T4 levels all were within the reference range.
Mean scores of each cognitive assessment tended to be
lower in adolescents with subclinical hyperthyroidism
and higher in adolescents with subclinical hypothy-
roidism than that in the euthyroid group (Table 2). For
example, mean scores of block design were 8.36 for the
subclinical hyperthyroidism group, 9.19 for the euthyroid
group, and 11.62 for the subclinical hypothyroidism.
Mean scores in reading and block design were signifi-
cantly higher in the adolescents with subclinical hypothy-
roidism than the scores in the euthyroid group.
Table 3 shows the results from the general linear model
adjusted for age, sex, ethnicity, poverty income ratio, test
language, and examiner. Even after the adjustment, ado-
lescents with subclinical hypothyroidism had signifi-
cantly higher mean scores in reading and block design
than euthyroid adolescents (the reference group).

Discussion
This study of a national sample of adolescents in the
United States found that adolescents with subclinical thy-
roid dysfunctions could have different cognitive perform-
ance. Our analysis found a higher average cognitive score
in mild hypothyroidism and a lower average cognitive
score in mild hyperthyroidism in adolescents in compari-
son to the euthyroid group. Mean scores in reading and
block design were significantly higher in adolescents with
subclinical hypothyroidism than the scores in the euthy-
roid group.
In children, contrary to congenital hypothyroidism, sig-
nificant correlations between low thyroid hormone value
and higher achievement in psychoeducational tests at
diagnosis were observed in pediatric endocrinologists'
practices. Behavior problems and decline in school per-
formance after initiation of treatment for juvenile
acquired hypothyroidism were recognized [15]. It was
hypothesized that these children were overachievers in
the thyroid-deficient state because of the decreased activ-
ity levels and lower arousal. We demonstrated that sub-
clinical thyroid status was correlated with cognitive
function. Cognitive performance tended to be better for
adolescents with subclinical hypothyroidism. It is possi-
ble that these children were overachievers due to
decreased activity levels and lower arousal also. Although
our data does not support poor cognitive function in
acquired juvenile subclinical hypothyroidism, it is possi-
ble that prolonged and severe forms of hypothyroidism
might have negative effects on cognitive functions. Treat-
ment of subclinical hypothyroidism in children with psy-
chiatric disorders, behavior problems, and learning
disabilities is not an uncommon practice. The benefit of
such treatment is controversial. Our findings suggest that
treatment decisions of subclinical hypothyroidism in chil-
dren should be very cautious.
Mean scores of the cognitive assessments tended to be
lower for adolescents with subclinical hyperthyroidism
than that for adolescents with normal TSH levels,
although the differences in the cognitive assessments did
not reach statistical significance in this study. This may
suggest that hyperthyroidism may be a potential risk fac-
tor affecting the cognitive performance among adoles-
cents, though the effect could be indirect. Children with
hyperthyroidism usually present with behavioral distur-
bances such as attention problems, difficulty in concen-
tration, and hyperactivity, which may lead to poor
cognitive performance [16]. Attention disturbances in
children with hyperthyroidism become attenuated once
euthyroidism is achieved through treatment [17].
Routine screening for thyroid disease with thyroid func-
tion tests is not recommended for asymptomatic children
or adults [18]. The clinical impact of subclinical thyroid
disease is not fully known. In this study, subclinical thy-
roid condition might be associated with cognitive per-
formance; therefore monitoring thyroid function in
adolescents with cognitive disorder could be helpful. The
importance and timely diagnosis and treatment of sub-
clinical thyroid disease, however, continue to be conten-
tious research topics at this time.
This study used data from a national sample of adoles-
cents residing in the United States, thus study findings
could be applicable to the adolescents on a population-
wide basis. However, the study has several limitations.
First, the number of adolescents with T4 and TSH values
beyond the reference ranges was rather small in this study.
Thus, the study might have insufficient power to detect
the differences between the groups in certain subscales of
cognitive function. This might explain that compared to
the euthyroid group, adolescents with subclinical hyper-
thyroidism appeared on average having a lower score in
each of the cognitive subscales, but the difference did not
reach statistical significance. We were also unable to per-
form meaningful analyses stratified by race/ethnicity or
social economic status due to the limited sample size. Sec-
ond, cognitive performance was assessed using the subsets

of the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R)
and the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children-Revised
(WISC-R). The clinical significance of the differences in
the cognitive assessments observed among adolescents
may be limited by the lack of standards for the partial
assessment scores. Furthermore, the NHANES III cogni-
tive assessment scores were on average much lower than
the standardized data for the subscales of WRAT-R and
WISC-R even among the healthy adolescents. This has
raised questions on the appropriateness of using NHANES
III data to assess cognitive outcomes [19]. We realized that
in NHANES III, the cognitive assessments were performed
by trained technicians (not psychologists) and in a less
controlled testing environment, which might not be com-
parable to the standard situation. However, the cognitive
tests were applied to adolescents in NHANES III indiffer-
ently regarding their thyroid status. We believe that the
assessment scores for the different groups would indicate
the relative levels of cognitive function among the groups.
The NHANES cognitive data has been used to examine the
effects of environmental tobacco smoke, food insuffi-
ciency, and blood lead levels [20-22]. Therefore, our esti-
mates on the relationships between the subclinical
conditions and cognitive function were thus not likely dis-
torted.
Conclusion
Subclinical hypothyroidism was associated with better
performance in some areas of cognitive functions while
subclinical hyperthyroidism could be a potential risk fac-
tor.
