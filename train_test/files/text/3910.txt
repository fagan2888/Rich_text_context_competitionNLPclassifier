and Super-K in a Predominantly Urban
Sample of Young Adults

Abstract
Recent research suggests human life history strategy (LHS) may be subsumed by multiple dimensions, including mating compe-
tition and Super-K, rather than one. In this study, we test whether a two-dimensional structure best fit data from a predominantly
urban sample of young adults ages 18­24. We also test whether latent life history dimensions are associated with environmental
harshness and unpredictability as predicted by life history theory. Results provide evidence that a two-dimensional model best fit
the data. Furthermore, a moderate inverse residual correlation between mating competition and Super-K was found, consistent
with a life history trade-off. Our findings suggest that parental socioeconomic status may enhance investment in mating com-
petition, that harshness might persist into young adulthood as an important correlate of LHS, and that unpredictability may not
have significant effects in young adulthood. These findings further support the contention that human LHS is multidimensional and
environmental effects on LHS are more complex than previously suggested. The model presented provides a parsimonious
explanation of an array of human behaviors and traits and can be used to inform public health initiatives, particularly with respect
to the potential impact of environmental interventions.

Evolutionary life history theory (LHT) originally explained
between-species variation in maturational and reproductive
traits that define the life course, such as developmental tempo,
reproductive timing, offspring number, body size, and long-
evity (Stearns, 1976). During the past 30 years, LHT has been
extended to explain variation within humans, first to observable
biological variables (e.g., pubertal timing) and later to psycho-
social traits (Belsky, Steinberg, & Draper, 1991; Chisholm,
1999; Draper & Harpending, 1982). More recently, Figueredo
and colleagues developed a psychometric approach to the study
of human life history that is rooted in the notion that evolution
by natural selection produced clusters of coadapted psychoso-
cial traits that function as coherent reproductive strategies
(Figueredo et al., 2006, 2014). In this view, adaptations that
allocate resources between somatic (e.g., bodily maintenance)
and reproductive effort and also between mating effort and
parental/nepotistic effort are executed in coordinated fashion,
producing reproductively coherent phenotypes in terms of per-
sonality, psychosocial characteristics, and outward behaviors.
The term fast life history strategy (LHS) has been used to
denote scores on traits and behaviors that cohere with early
reproduction and mating effort, while slow LHS represents
scores that cohere with somatic and parental effort.

Many discussions of human LHS have assumed a single
fast-to-slow dimension and consistent with this; a number of
psychometric studies have found that a second-order K-factor
subsumed indicators including planning and control, social
contact and support, attachment, religiosity, and altruism (for
a review, see Olderbak, Gladden, Wolf, & Figueredo, 2014).
LHS has also recently been broadened to a third-order Super-K
factor that subsumes the second-order K-factor, along with
covitality (i.e., health and mental health) and the general factor
of personality (which encompasses the Big Five; Olderbak
et al., 2014). These findings suggest that on some level, a single
source might give rise to the covariation among a suite of life
history indicators.
Despite evidence of a K dimension and some consensus that
there is a fast­slow life history continuum within humans (e.g.,
relating to developmental tempo; Belsky et al., 1991; Chisholm
et al., 1993); it is not clear that a single dimension subsumes the
wider documented variation in human life history traits (Cop-
ping, Campbell, & Muncer, 2014a; Richardson, Sanning, et al.,
2016). In particular, it is not clear that a single higher order K
dimension subsumes mating competition (e.g., mating effort,
dominance seeking, and risk-taking). According to LHT, the
finite nature of resources induces phenotypic trade-offs (see
Mace, 2000; Stearns, 1989) such that investments in somatic
and parental effort occur at the expense of mating competition
(Figueredo et al., 2006). This does not necessarily imply that
these aspects of human LHS reflect a single factor. Indeed,
some research indicates that although K-factors have subsumed
neuroticism and health, altruism, conscientiousness, parental
investment, and earning potential (Figueredo, Vasquez, Brum-
bach, & Schneider, 2007), they have not also subsumed mating
effort (Gladden, Figueredo, & Jacobs, 2009; Olderbak & Fig-
ueredo, 2012; but see Figueredo et al., 2005). Recently, Old-
erbak, Gladden, Wolf, and Figueredo (2014) also found that
mating effort did not reflect four of five K-factors subsuming
five different measures of LHS (i.e., Super K-1, Arizona Life
History Battery, Mini-K, and High-K Strategy Scale, but not
Super K-2).
Consistent with the above, Hampson, Andrews, Barckley,
Gerrard, and Gibbons (2016) reported that a life history dimen-
sion subsuming risky sex and substance use in Grade 10 was
only slightly and negatively related to a dimension that sub-
sumed sociability, health, and mental health 1-year post high
school. Similar, Brumbach, Figueredo, and Ellis (2009) found
two uncorrelated social deviance (impulsivity, substance use,
delinquency, and Machiavellianism) and slow LHS (health,
resource accruing potential and sexual restrictedness) dimen-
sions of young adult LHS. Importantly, however, sexual
restrictedness had only a small effect (b ¼ .23) on sexual
behavior and the structural model also did not fit according
to current standards (e.g., the comparative fit index [CFI] was
observed at .83, well below the standard threshold of .95; for
discussion of fit indices, see model fit). This evidence of misfit
is consistent with an omitted effect of social deviance on sexual
behavior; future research could test alternative models that
include this specification. Richardson, Chen, et al. (2014) and
Richardson, Chen, et al. (2016) reported similar evidence that a
factor subsuming delinquency, substance use, and number of
sexual partners did not also subsume indicators of covitality.
Other research has suggested that mating effort might be sub-
sumed by latent variables named psychopathic and aggressive
attitudes (Figueredo, Gladden, & Hohman, 2011) or perhaps
the Dark Triad (Jonason, Li, Webster, & Schmitt, 2009). Taken
together, the findings reviewed suggest that human LHS is
likely multidimensional and mating competition might be
unique from the K dimension that has subsumed aspects of
somatic and parental effort.
Stemming from the above, Richardson, Sanning, et al.
(2016) recently tested the possibility that human LHS is two-
dimensional using a nationally representative middle adulthood
sample and a broad selection of life history indicators. The
authors found that indeed, two independent dimensions sub-
sumed middle adult life history indicators--mating competi-
tion and Super-K. Mating competition subsumed life history
indicators such as risk-taking, aggression, substance use, num-
ber of sex partners, and disagreeableness, while Super-K sub-
sumed indicators such as social contact/support, pair-bonding,
health and positive affect, agreeableness, conscientiousness,
openness, extroversion, education, and emotional stability.
These findings suggest that LHS is not only multidimensional
at the first-order level of traits such as conscientiousness (as
described in Figueredo et al., 2015), but also at higher order
levels. In other words, while there might be a within humans
fast­slow life history continuum, there may be no single LHS
dimension that can be scored to capture life history speed.
More research is needed to confirm the two-dimensional
structure found by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) and test
whether it extends to other developmental stages. This is cru-
cial because LHT has been increasingly used in evolutionary
studies of human variation as well as applied areas of research
and theory. As examples of the latter, LHT has recently been to
psychopathology (e.g., Del Giudice, 2014a; Del Giudice &
Ellis, 2016), risk-taking propensity and externalizing behaviors
(e.g., Ellis et al., 2012; Richardson & Hardesty, 2012; Richard-
son et al., 2014; Richardson, Castellano, Stone, & Sanning,
2016; Richardson, Chen, et al., 2016; Richardson, Dai, et al.,
2016; Wang, Kruger, & Wilke, 2009), public health (e.g., Kru-
ger, 2011), medicine (e.g., Nesse et al., 2010), and criminology
and criminal justice (e.g., Boutwell, Nedelec, Lewis, Barnes, &
Beaver, 2015). Many researchers who want to measure LHS
are interested in the theory because of its potential to shed light
on the covariance among broad array of traits and behaviors.
One big payoff, from an applied perspective, is that if we can
map LHT onto human variation, the theory can be leveraged to
elucidate how broad arrays of reproductively relevant traits and
behaviors relate to environment throughout development.
To achieve this payoff, we must first determine whether it is
more useful to model latent variables that underlie suites of life
history indicators or to instead focus on the individual indica-
tors. While latent variables have the potential to provide parsi-
mony and simplify our view of human variation, they also have
the potential--particularly from a realist perspective--to
2 Evolutionary Psychology
impede scientific progress if they are not themselves good
proxies for one or more real psychological mechanisms (for
further discussion, see Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). We
must first address the following question to determine whether
it is useful to model dimensions of LHS: How many dimen-
sions are plausible? To answer this question, we must establish
which higher order structure, if any, fits the life history indi-
cator data. We must also test whether latent variables that are
found relate to environmental conditions as predicted by LHT,
or in other words, assess the validity of latent LHS constructs
through their linkage to external criteria.
Current Study
In this study, we test whether the two-dimensional structure
documented by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) also fits
data from a predominantly urban sample of young adults
ages 18­24. We also test whether the two latent vari-
ables--mating competition and Super-K--are associated
with environmental harshness and unpredictability as pre-
dicted by LHT. As described in Richardson, Sanning, et al.
(2016), the utility of the psychometric approach to human
LHS is largely a function of the ability of factors to explain
the dependence among life history indicators as well as their
associations with aspects of environment. This study
addresses these issues directly to shed additional light on the
utility of the psychometric approach. It also builds upon
prior research (e.g., Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016) by
using a more extensive selection of indicators of mating
competition, environmental harshness, and environmental
unpredictability, as well as more proximate measures of
harshness and unpredictability. We used more proximate
measures of harshness and unpredictability because most life
history research has assumed that childhood conditions are
most robustly associated with LHS. Few studies, however,
have examined the magnitude of these associations later in
development. Finally, this study follows Richardson, San-
ning, et al. (2016) by including multiple aspects of environ-
ment so as to estimate their relative importance.
Method
Data
This study received institutional review board approval (both
at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health and
the University of Cincinnati). All participants provided
written consent before participating. The data were from a
purposive sample of 126 HIV negative, never married, 18- to
24-year-old (
x ¼ 21.3, SD ¼ 1.9) women (n ¼ 70) and men
(n ¼ 56; for sample demographics, see Table 1). Quota sam-
pling was used to balance the sample on age, biological sex,
and race. Participants were sampled from an urban city with
high sexually transmitted infection and HIV, drug use, and
crime prevalence, and also surrounding counties marked by
fewer risk outcomes. Females were oversampled in an effort
to offset attrition due to pregnancy. Inclusion criteria were
being aged 18­24 years, never married, HIV negative,1 pro-
ficient in English reading and writing, and not currently

pregnant (females). Participants were recruited through local
newspaper and online social media advertisements, public
flyers, and peer referrals (from enrolled participants). The
data supporting these analyses were collected at baseline of
a larger parent study.
Instruments
We used LHT to select 11 indicators of young adult LHS and 3
retrospective indicators of childhood and recent environmen-
tal conditions. We selected a broad set of indicators that have
been observed to reflect LHS in prior research (see Olderbak
et al., 2014, for a review) and also chose environmental com-
ponents that have been previously studied (for a review, see
Ellis, Figueredo, Brumbach, & Schlomer, 2009). Based on the
literature to date, we note the hypothesized valence of each
LHS indicator loading on mating competition and Super-K in
Table 2. We used numerous standardized and validated scales
to measure most of our LHS indicators. A full list of the items
and scales used is presented in Table 3 along with their cor-
responding construct labels, item contents, response options,
and citations to validation studies. Detailed information about
the items used to construct the environmental components is
displayed in Table 4.
Below we describe all indicators used to measure young
adult LHS and index environmental conditions. Because this
study used established indicators of LHS, we do not provide
a detailed theoretical rationale for the inclusion of each one
in this report. Instead, we provide citations to reviews of life
history measures or other publications in which the use of
each indicator is substantiated. We also do not present psy-
chometrics associated with each indicator in this section.
Because our sample size was fairly small relative to the
number of parameters we planned to estimate (i.e., less than
the minimum 10:1 ratio often recommended for structural
equation modeling [SEM] studies; Bentler & Chou, 1987),
we assessed items for unidimensionality and computed
scores for use in our structural models. These procedures are
described in Analyses section, and the psychometric proper-
ties of our indicators are presented in Results section and in
Tables 3 and 4.
Indicators of young adult LHS
Super-K. To locate latent Super-K, we used measures of life
history domains including health and symptoms of depres-
sion (Figueredo & Rushton, 2009; Olderbak et al., 2014;
Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016), harm avoidance (Del Giu-
dice, 2014b), agreeableness (Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figuer-
edo, Vasquez, Brumbach, & Schneider, 2004, 2007;
Olderbak et al., 2014; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016),
valuing of children,2 and liability to substance use (Richard-
son & Hardesty, 2012; Richardson, Chen, et al., 2014;
Richardson, Chen, et al., 2016; Richardson, Dai, et al.,
2016; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). As a reminder, the
specific items and scales we used to measure these domains,
along with item contents, response options, and citations to
validation studies are presented in Table 3.
Mating competition. We located latent mating competition
using measures of life history domains including sensation
seeking and reward responsiveness (Copping, Campbell, &
Muncer, 2013, 2014b), attitudes toward risk (Ellis et al.,
2012; Figueredo et al., 2005; Richardson, Sanning, et al.,
2016), delinquency (Boutwell et al., 2015; Brumbach, Figuer-
edo, & Ellis, 2009; Richardson et al., 2014; Richardson, Chen,
et al., 2016), liability to substance use (Richardson et al., 2014;
Richardson, Chen, et al., 2016; Richardson & Hardesty, 2012;
Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016), harm avoidance (Del Giu-
dice, 2014b; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016), and agreeable-
ness (Dunkel & Decker, 2010; Figueredo et al., 2004, 2007;
Olderbak et al., 2014; Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). We
also included an item that assessed total number of same and
opposite sex partners in the past year (Brumbach et al., 2009;
Ellis et al., 2009; Richardson et al., 2014; Richardson, Chen,
et al., 2016, Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016; see Table 3 for
more information).
Environment
Unpredictability. Environmental unpredictability was indexed
by summing 9 items similar to those previously used to form
this construct (see, e.g., Brumbach et al., 2009; Simpson, Gris-
kevicius, Kuo, Sung, & Collins, 2012). The items were drawn
from the Life Events Scale (see Table 3; D'Imperio, Dubow, &
Ippolito, 2000) and assessed past 12-month experience of
events such as family moving to a new home or apartment;
parental separation or divorce, or one of the parents leaving
the family; one of the parents losing their job; and the family's
property wrecked or damaged due to fire, burglary, or disaster.
These items were categorical and participants endorsed ``no''
or ``yes'' on each. See Analyses section for a description of
how we constructed the unpredictability index and Table 4 for
information about internal consistency.
Harshness. Environmental harshness was indexed with 16
items similar to those used in prior research (see Ellis et al.,
2009; Simpson et al., 2012). The items were also drawn from
Table 2. Valence of Hypothesized Loadings on Mating Competition

the Life Events Scale (D'Imperio et al., 2000) and assessed
experiences in the past 12 months such as seeing someone
beaten, shot, or really hurt by someone; seeing or being around
people shooting guns; being upset by neighborhood violence;
and experienced the death of a family member, relative, or
close friend. Participants endorsed ``no'' or ``yes'' on each
item. See Analyses section for a description of how we con-
structed composite harshness.
Parental socioeconomic status (SES). SES has been used in past
research as an index of environmental harshness (i.e., extrinsic
mortality; Ellis et al., 2009; Sheppard, Pearce, & Sear, 2015) as
well as the degree of that extrasomatic resources are available
to be invested in mating competition and/or parenting
(Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). SES is traditionally
indexed by forming a composite of indicators such as parental
income, educational attainment, and occupational status
(National Center for Education Statistics, 2012). In this study,
we indexed parental SES using the highest degree earned by
participants' mothers and fathers (ranging from ``less than high
school'' to ``doctoral'') and an item assessing whether or not
participants were eligible for or recipients of free or reduced
cost lunch as minors. Below we describe how we constructed
composite SES.
Analyses
We used exploratory factor analysis (EFA) to assess the valu-
ing of children, delinquency, harm avoidance, liability to sub-
stance use, and agreeableness items for unidimensionality and
compute scores for use in our structural models. We also scored
several standardized scales (for scale descriptions and citations,
see Table 2). For our EFA analyses, we used MPlus 7.11 and
the robust weighted least squares (WLSMV) estimator, delta
parameterization, and oblique rotations (Geomin). We used the
WLSMV because we included categorical and ordinal Likert-
type items. Following convention, we conducted all signifi-
cance tests at the p < .05 level. Finally, we used principle
components analysis (PCA) to form composite harshness and
parent SES and summed over the unpredictability items to
compute total unpredictability.
This study used SEM to test the structure of young adult life
history indicators, along with the extent to which latent LHS
variables explained associations between these indicators and
aspects of environment. For our SEM analyses, we also used
MPlus 7.11 and the WLSMV estimator because we needed to
treat number of sex partners as ordinal. We considered treating
this variable as a count but decided to treat it as ordinal because
our models assumed a linear effect of mating competition on

the number of partners and it did not seem plausible that a unit
increase in mating competition would have the same meaning
across the distribution of the number of partners (e.g., in mov-
ing participants from say, 0­1 vs. 20­21 partners). This
approach was also reasonable because 92.7% of participants
had six or fewer sexual partners and all counts greater than six
were endorsed by only one or two participants. Thus, we
recoded the original variable, which ranged from 0 to 25, into
a new variable that ranged from 0 (no partners) to 6 (6 or more
partners).
Goodness-of-fit criteria. This study used a variety of fit indices in
order to obtain a robust assessment of model fit. We considered
the substantive meaningfulness of the model and regarded
Tucker­Lewis index (TLI) and CFI greater than .95 (Byrne,
2001; Hu & Bentler, 1999), along with root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA) values of less than .05 (Browne &
Cudeck, 1993), as evidence of acceptable fit to the data. We
also considered significant w2 likelihood ratio statistics as evi-
dence that the hypothesis of exact fit should be rejected (Bol-
len, 1989).
Hypothesized models. We hypothesized a measurement model in
which a two-dimensional structure (Super-K and mating com-
petition) subsumed our life history indicators. We compared
the fit of this model to one specifying a single Super-K factor
that subsumed all the indicators. In addition, we hypothesized a
full structural model in which latent Super-K and mating com-
petition explained the effects of environmental harshness,
unpredictability, and parental SES on their indicators. We
tested our models and observed fit and modification indices
for evidence of misfit suggesting we should reject the two-
dimensional model. We also observed fit and modification
indices for evidence suggesting that the latent variables did not
fully explain the effects of environment on their indicators.
Results
Dimensionality of Scales
To assess our life history measures for unidimensionality, we
used EFA to test measurement models for the valuing of chil-
dren, delinquency, harm avoidance, liability to substance use,
and agreeableness items. Fit indices for each model are dis-
played in Table 5. Consistent with prior research (Thompson,
Davidson, & Williams, 1983), a three-factor solution fit the
valuing of children items best. We termed the factors ``pur-
pose,'' ``burden,'' and ``community standing'' (for item con-
tents, see Table 2). Loadings ranged from b ¼ .33 to .89 in
magnitude across the factors (for all loadings, see Table 2) and
higher scores implied lesser perceived purpose, lesser per-
ceived burden, and lesser perception that children are critical

to acceptance or standing in the community. We then saved
scores on the three factors and applied PCA to them in order to
construct composite valuing of children. A single component
solution emerged and explained 62% of the variance in the
three facets. Their loadings were observed at À.68, .90, and
.78, respectively. Higher scores on the composite, therefore,
implied greater perceived purpose, lesser sense of burden, and
lesser perception that children are critical to acceptance or
standing in the community (i.e., greater valuing of children).
Because we observed very low base rates on the delin-
quency items (60.3­98.6% endorsement of zeros across the
items), we bucketed participants into ``no instances of the beha-
vior'' and ``one or more instances of the behavior'' and then
conducted our EFA. We dropped 2 items because only 1 person
endorsed the first (delinquency last 12 months: breaking in) and
only 2 endorsed the second (delinquency last 12 months: use
weapon). A single-factor model fits the data reasonably well
(see Table 5). Loadings ranged from b ¼ .49 to .98, and we
saved scores on latent delinquency for our SEM. Next, we fac-
tored the harm avoidance items and found that a two-factor
solution best fit the data. We termed the first factor ``confi-
dence'' and retained the label, ``harm avoidance,'' for the sec-
ond. Loadings ranged from b ¼ .54 to .94 across the factors, with
higher scores implying greater confidence and harm avoidance.
We saved scores on harm avoidance for our SEM. We did not
include confidence because as far as we know, this construct has
not been theoretically or empirically linked to LHS. Moreover,
due to sample size limitations, we were limited in the number of
variables we could include in the model.
We fit a second-order factor model to the liability to sub-
stance use items. These items were counts and we recoded
them into ordinal variables3 for the same reasons as the number
of sexual partners. This was also acceptable in this specific case
because across the items, more than 70% of participants
endorsed the first four counts and many of the higher counts
were endorsed by only one participant. Moreover, 1 item was
bimodal (30/day tobacco) and another exceeded the maximum
for counts in MPlus (tobacco/week). In the model, daily,
weekly, and past month alcohol use loaded on a first-order
alcohol use factor. Similarly, daily, weekly, and past month
nicotine use loaded on a first-order nicotine use factor. These
two first-order factors and also the breadth in illicit substance
use and past cannabis use items were then loaded onto second-
order liability to substance use. Second-order factor loadings
ranged from b ¼ .67 to .77. We applied EFA to the agreeable-
ness items and a single-factor model had an excellent fit to the
data. Loadings ranged from b ¼ .49 to .77. As mentioned
previously, the other life history domains were measured with
scale scores or single items (for more information, see Table 2).
For the environmental components, we first applied PCA to
environmental harshness, imposing a single component solu-
tion on the data, and found that it explained 38% of the variance
in the items. We then used PCA to analyze the parent SES
items and found that a single component explained 68% of the
variance. Finally, we summed over the unpredictability items
to compute total (composite) unpredictability because sources
of unpredictability may not be systematically related.
Hypothesized Model I: Dimensionality of LHS
We tested the hypothesized two-factor model and it fit the data
very well, w2 ¼ 38.82 [40], p ¼ .52; CFI ¼ 1.00; TLI ¼ 1.00;
RMSEA ¼ .00. We set the metrics for the two factors by fixing
the health loading on Super-K and the sensation seeking load-
ing on mating competition to one. The effects of Super-K on its
indicators were all statistically significant (ps < .05) except for
the effect on liability to substance use (p ¼ .070). Given that
marginal p value for this loading, we constrained it to 0 to test
the hypothesis that it was nil. We found that with this constraint
imposed, model fit was significantly worse, Dw2 ¼ 4.45 [1],
p ¼ .035. Thus, we proceeded by retaining and interpreting this
loading along with the others. All significant effects of Super-K
were larger than b (standardized) ¼ .50 except for the effects
on valuing of children (b ¼ .27) and liability to substance use

(b ¼ À.20). The effects of mating competition on its indicators
were all statistically significant except for the effect on harm
avoidance (p ¼ .067). Given that marginal p value for this
loading, we constrained it to 0 and found that this constraint
significantly worsened model fit, Dw2 ¼ 4.56 [1], p ¼ .032.
Thus, we proceeded by retaining and interpreting this loading
along with the others. All significant effects of mating compe-
tition were larger than b ¼ .50. The correlation between Super-
K and mating competition was observed at r ¼ À.55 (p < .001).
For the liability to substance use and harm avoidance indica-
tors, which cross-loaded on Super-K and mating competition,
the R2 estimates were .43 and .20, respectively. Finally, we
tested a single-factor model of life history indicators and
found that it fits the data poorly, w2 ¼ 94.83 [44], p < .001;
CFI ¼ .72; TLI ¼ .65; RMSEA ¼ .10, and significantly worse
than Model I, Dw2 ¼ 38.91, p < .001. Thus, we accepted
hypothesized Model I as the best reproducer of the associa-
tions among the indicators.
Hypothesized Model II: Associations With Environment
We next incorporated environmental variables into our final
measurement model (Model I) and found that the result fit the
data well, w2 ¼ 79.49 [67], p ¼ .14; CFI ¼ .95; TLI ¼ .94;
RMSEA ¼ .04. The effects of Super-K and mating competition
on their indicators mirrored those observed for Model I (see
Table 6 and Figure 1). Consistent with Model I, the correlation
between the residuals of the two life history dimension was
observed at r ¼ À.43 (p < .001). Parent SES had a moderate
positive effect on mating competition (b ¼ .31, p < .01) and no
significant effect on Super-K. Harshness had a moderate pos-
itive effect (b ¼ .46, p < .001) on mating competition and a
large negative effect on Super-K (b ¼ À.56, p < .001). Unpre-
dictability had no significant effect on the life history dimen-
sions, although its effect on mating competition neared
significance (b ¼ .18, p ¼ .09). A moderate positive correlation
was observed between harshness and unpredictability (r ¼ .45,
p < .001), while a moderate negative correlation was observed
between parent SES and harshness (r ¼ À.34, p < .001). Parent
SES and unpredictability were uncorrelated (p ¼ .66) condi-
tional on harshness.
No relatively large modification indices (MIs) were
observed (all MIs < 5) for Model II suggesting that no areas
of strain existed. Given this and the other observed fit infor-
mation, we concluded that no covariances between our life
history indicators or between our environmental components
and the indicators had likely been omitted. This implied that the
assumptions of local independence of the life history indicators
conditional on mating competition and Super-K held. In addi-
tion, the assumption of local homogeneity held given the
absence of paths from the environmental components to the
indicators and the nonsignificant w2 and other fit information
(i.e., the latent LHS variables provided all the relevant infor-
mation about their indicators). The first finding is consistent
with the notion that the life history indicators share two under-
lying common causes. The latter is consistent with the notion

Discussion
Overview of Findings
Using SEM, this study tested the hypothesis that two dimen-
sions subsumed life history indicators in a predominantly urban
sample of young adults. We reproduced the two-dimensional
structure suggested by Richardson et al. (2014) and documen-
ted by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016). The two dimen-
sions--mating competition and Super-K--fully explained
any associations among the life history indicators as well as
their associations with environmental conditions. These find-
ings suggest that mating competition and Super-K may func-
tion as underlying common causes that explain the covariance
among a broad swath of life history parameters (e.g., number of
sexual partners), psychosocial traits (e.g., sensation seeking
and agreeableness), and behaviors (e.g., delinquency). Thus,
it may be useful for evolutionary scientists, including those
interested in informing public health efforts, to focus on the
relationships between aspects of environment and these under-
lying factors. This kind of research may produce a more parsi-
monious picture of the linkage between environment and
variation in human traits and behaviors, one that could inform
the development of public policy initiatives that produce broad
returns in terms of physical and mental health, risky behavior,
and education. For instance, this work could shed new light on
the etiology of comorbidity and inform efforts to prevent men-
tal disorders. Our model and the one reported by Richardson,
Sanning, et al. (2016) both suggest that holding harshness con-
stant, higher parental SES has a positive mating competition
mediated effect on risky behavior, but no effect on health or
depression. Thus, it is possible that interventions that increase
SES, but do not decrease harshness as a consequence, will
increase risky behavior. Similar, interventions that decrease
harshness but do not increase SES, if they are possible, would
be expected to reduce internalizing symptoms without increas-
ing risky behavior as a byproduct.
Dimensionality of Life History Indicators
We found that all indicators of mating competition functioned
as theorized, with the exception of agreeableness. Those who
scored higher on mating competition endorsed greater sensa-
tion seeking, less negative attitudes toward risk, greater respon-
sivity to reward, less harm avoidance, more delinquent
behavior, greater substance use, and larger numbers of sexual
partners. There was a significant positive effect on agreeable-
ness. This should be interpreted as an effect within levels of
Super-K, or for those with the same scores on Super-K. Indeed,
when Super-K and its unique indicators are removed from the
model, the mating competition effect on agreeableness is no

longer significant. Still, we expected significant negative effect
on agreeableness on the basis of theory and past research (e.g.,
Richardson, Sanning, et al., 2016). Therefore, the current find-
ing is surprising.
For Super-K, all indicators except harm avoidance reflected
their factors as theorized. Also, the effect on substance use,
although in the expected direction, was small. Those high on
Super-K endorsed better health and fewer symptoms of depres-
sion, greater agreeableness, and greater valuing of children. To
our knowledge, this is the first evidence that Super-K is asso-
ciated with greater attribution of value to offspring prior to
parenthood. Interestingly, higher levels on Super-K implied
less harm avoidance. Perhaps this is due to the items used to
measure harm avoidance. The content of the Character and
Trait Inventory items in this subscale seem to tap into intoler-
ance of ambiguity, discomfort in response to uncertainty, and/
or anxiety (e.g., ``I often feel tense and worried in unfamiliar
situations, even when others feel there is little to worry about,''
and ``It is extremely difficult for me to adjust to changes in my
usual way of doing things because I get so tense''). Given that
Super-K has reflected lesser environmental harshness and also
subsumed social connectedness and support (Richardson,
Sanning, et al., 2016), perhaps it should not be surprising
that participants scoring highly on this factor feel less tense
when faced with unfamiliar situations. Their external social
environments have been relatively safe and thus they may
feel secure in new situations. In contrast, the negative harm
avoidance loading on mating competition might be attribu-
table to low levels of sensitivity to threat. Consistent with
this, we found that mating competition subsumed aspects of
reward sensitivity (e.g., reward dependence), and reward
and threat sensitivity have been inversely related in past
research (Richardson, Freedlander, Katz, Dai, & Chen,
2014). That is, those with high levels of mating competition
may not find new situations unnerving because of internal
characteristics that bias their attention toward cues to
reward and away from cues to threat. This may enable them
to better find and acquire new mates. Future work should
confirm which forms of harm avoidance reflect mating com-
petition and Super-K.
In combination with previous research, this study helps to
characterize the dimensionality of life history indicators. LHS
does not appear to be unidimensional--a single-factor model
did not fit our data nor those examined in Richardson,
Sanning, et al. (2016). Instead, there appear to be at least two
unique factors--mating competition and Super-K. These find-
ings are also consistent with the Brumbach et al.'s (2009)
finding of two uncorrelated dimensions in young adulthood.
Given that the two dimensions were independent or uncorre-
lated in other studies, and moderately correlated here, we
contend that they should not be aggregated and interpreted
as life history speed. Each unique dimension of LHS seems to
require attention. Finally, although other studies suggest there
may not be a direct trade-off between the two LHS dimen-
sions, as LHT would have us believe, this study detected a
moderate negative residual correlation that is consistent with
a direct phenotypic trade-off. More research is needed to
identify the conditions under which mating competition and
Super-K are inversely related.
Combining the findings reported here and in Richardson,
Sanning, et al. (2016), we conclude that although the nature
of the trade-off between the two LHS dimensions is not yet
resolved, it seems that mating competition clearly manifests as
sensation seeking, risk-taking, and behaviors that can enhance
fitness in the short term but are costly in the long term. Con-
sistent with LHT, mating competition also manifests as greater
numbers of sexual partners, which would have likely led to
greater quantities of offspring prior to the advent of modern
birth control and the demographic transition (for related dis-
cussions of fertility and the demographic transition, see Sear,
2015; Sear & Coall, 2011). We also conclude that Super-K
clearly manifests as facets of connectedness to peers, intimate
partners, and offspring, as well as covitality. These findings
suggest the human life history continuum is composed of
unique mating competition and Super K dimensions that sub-
sume mating effort and somatic and parental effort, respec-
tively. We note that these findings should not be seen as
limiting human life history to two dimensions of investment.
Much more work is needed to determine how many dimensions
are plausible and also whether trade-offs between them are
occurring as suggested by LHT.
Associations With Environment
Our LHS dimensions explained the associations between life
history indicators and aspects of environment. Greater harsh-
ness predicted higher levels of mating competition and lower
levels of Super-K, unpredictability did not have significant
effects on either dimension, and parental SES had a moderate
positive effect on mating competition. Richardson, Sanning,
et al. (2016) documented similar environmental effects in
middle adulthood, except they detected an effect of unpredict-
ability on Super-K. This study used more proximate (past
12-month) measures of environmental harshness and unpre-
dictability than past studies. The effects of harshness were
larger than observed in past research, consistent either greater
importance of proximate cues to harshness and/or an emer-
ging gene­environment correlation. The effects of unpredict-
ability were nonsignificant. This could be because later
unpredictability is not as important as early unpredictability,
consistent with psychosocial acceleration theory (e.g., Belsky
et al., 1991) and recent evidence (Simpson et al., 2012). This
could also be partly due to the fact that some of our young
adults were no longer living with their parents (about 38%)
and some of the unpredictability items tapped aspects of par-
ental experiences or behavior.
We also found a parental SES effect on mating competi-
tion similar to that reported in Richardson, Sanning, et al.
(2016), consistent with gene­environment correlation and/
or a reliable influence of access to resources on life history
dimensions. It is important to note that some past research
(e.g., Simpson et al., 2012) used SES as the only index of
Richardson et al. 11
harshness. Our findings suggest that the SES effect on mating
competition (or its indicators) may be more likely to emerge
when more direct cues to extrinsic mortality (e.g., seeing
someone shot) are controlled, while the association between
SES and Super-K may be attributable to experienced harsh-
ness. This implies that relying on SES as the sole index of
harshness is likely inadequate. Thus we suggest that in the
future, researchers control for SES and also more direct indi-
cators of environmental harshness. This may allow them to
better disentangle the effects of SES and access to resources
from the effects of cues to mortality risk.
Overall, these findings are consistent with LHT. Harshness
had the expected effects on the two LHS dimensions and was
associated with faster LHS overall. Unpredictability did not
predict the LHS factors but this may be due to a restriction
of its effects to childhood. Parental SES had what might be
seen as a surprising effect on mating competition, but this
effect was also found by Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016)
and is consistent with evidence of elevated risk-taking in sam-
ples of affluent youth (Luthar & Barkin, 2012). It is also con-
sistent with evidence that greater access to resources is
associated with higher levels on r and also K strategies between
species (Sibly & Brown, 2007, 2009). The idea is that with
greater access to resources, organisms can increase their play
in all reproductive games. In the case of within-human varia-
tion, it seems that higher SES may be directly related to greater
mating competition and also indirectly related to higher Super-
K through decreased experience of cues to harshness (e.g.,
seeing someone shot).
Limitations
This study is limited by the use of self-report data, and it is
widely recognized that such data can be affected by error in
the retrieval processes associated with memory and self-
presentation bias. This limitation applies most significantly
to the retrospective measure of SES. However, the measure
we used is the standard in the field and this limitation should
also apply less young adults compared with middle adults
given the smaller time lag since childhood. Second, causal
inferences based on the results presented here should remain
tentative given that past studies have shown that the influence
of genetic factors is ubiquitous (Turkheimer, 2000). Future
research can use genetic information to address this limita-
tion. Finally, we used environmental measures and several
life history indicators (e.g., number of sexual partners and
valuing of children) that can be seen as helpful in establishing
the validity of our latent constructs. Future studies should test
whether mating competition and Super-K are related to addi-
tional criteria such as pubertal timing, first birth, parental
investment, and longevity. For mating competition, specifi-
cally, effects on indicators such as mate poaching, intrasexual
competitiveness, attitudes toward partner infidelity, and per-
ceptions of infidelity risk should also be tested. Future stud-
ies should also examine the stability of mating competition
and Super-K over time.
Strengths/Contributions
One major contribution of this study is the heterogeneous sam-
ple of youth, representing many demographic characteristics
(e.g., parental SES, current educational attainment, age, race,
and ethnicity). The data set is rich in variables and constructs to
support analyses like these. This study reproduced the two-
dimensional structure of LHS indicators documented by
Richardson, Sanning, et al. (2016) in this unique and hetero-
geneous sample of young adults. It also helped to better estab-
lish the identity of the mating competition factor using a more
extensive selection of indicators as well as more extensive and
proximate measures of environmental harshness and unpredict-
ability. The latter casts light on the possible role of environ-
ment in LHS development. Finally, our inclusion of multiple
aspects of environment allowed us to produce a nuanced view
of their associations with young adult LHS.
Conclusion
Taken together, our results reinforce the Richardson, Sanning,
et al.'s (2016) finding that human LHS at least two-
dimensional. In this study, a moderate inverse residual correla-
tion was observed between mating competition and Super-K,
consistent with a direct trade-off between these two dimensions
of LHS. Moreover, we have shown that SES may enhance
investment in mating competition, that harshness might persist
into young adulthood as an important correlate of LHS, and
that unpredictability may not have significant effects in young
adulthood. These findings reinforce the contention that human
LHS is multidimensional and environmental effects on LHS
are more complex than previously suggested. They also pro-
vide a parsimonious model of an array of human behaviors and
traits that can be used to inform public health initiatives, par-
ticularly with respect to the potential impact of environmental
interventions that target harshness versus SES.

Notes
1. The larger parent study was designed to examine youth risk-taking
and decision-making from biosocial perspectives. Because
decision-making was a primary focus, participants were screened
for HIV, stroke, epilepsy, traumatic brain injury, and other condi-
tions that can compromise brain function. During an in-person
screening visit, a trained test administrator conducted an HIV rapid
test to verify self-reported negative HIV status--all participants
tested negative.
2. We used valuing of children as a hypothesized indicator of Super-K
because we theorized that attribution of greater value to offspring
should be a reliable precursor to greater parental investment (for
related discussion, see Chisholm et al., 1993).
3. For 30/day binge drinking, categories were 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 or
more. For drinks/week, they were 0, 1, 2, 3­9, and 10 or more. For
30/day tobacco use, they were 0, 1­29, and 30. This variable was
bimodal, with most participants endorsing no days or 30 days--
only 10% endorsed the counts in between. For tobacco/week, the
categories were 0, 1­2, and 3 or more. For tobacco/day, they were
0, 1, and 2 or more. For 30 day/cannabis, they were 0, 1­10, and 11
or more.
