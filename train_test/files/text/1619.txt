ABSTRACT
Background: Snacking is common in adolescents; however, it is
unclear if there is an association between snacking and overweight
or obesity within the context of the overall diet.
Objective: This study examined the associations of snacking with
weight status and abdominal obesity in adolescents 12­18 y of age
(n = 5811).
Design: We conducted secondary analyses of 24-h diet recalls and
anthropometric data from the National Health and Nutrition Exam-
ination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2004. We classified adolescents
by frequency of snack consumption (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 snacks/d)
and by the percentage of energy intake from snacks (0%, ,10%,
10­19%, 20­29%, 30­39%, and 40%). We classified adolescents
who had a body mass index (BMI) 85th percentile of BMI-for-age
as overweight or obese. We defined abdominal obesity as a waist
circumference 90th percentile. We determined covariate-adjusted
prevalences of overweight or obesity and abdominal obesity and
odds ratios with SUDAAN software (release 9.0.1; Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC).
Results: Mean values of all obesity indicators studied were in-
versely associated with snacking frequency and percentage of en-
ergy from snacks. The prevalence of overweight or obesity and of
abdominal obesity decreased with increased snacking frequency and
with increased percentage of energy from snacks. Odds ratios (95%
CIs) for overweight or obesity and for abdominal obesity ranged
from 0.63 (0.48, 0.85) to 0.40 (0.29, 0.57) and from 0.61 (0.43,
0.86) to 0.36 (0.21, 0.63) for 2 to 4 snacks/d, respectively. Re-
duced risks of overweight or obesity and abdominal obesity were
associated with snacking.
Conclusion: Snackers, compared with nonsnackers, were less likely
to be overweight or obese and less likely to have abdominal obe-
sity. Am J Clin Nutr 2010;92:428­35.
INTRODUCTION
Adolescence is a time of rapid growth and development, which
makes this a period of nutritional vulnerability. Adolescents also
gain increased control over their own food choices (1) and often
acquire poor dietary patterns such as skipping breakfast (2, 3) and
rely on eating fast foods (4, 5) or regularly eating meals outside
the home (4). These habits could translate into consumption of
energy-dense or nutrient-poor diets (6) that potentially contrib-
uted to overweight.
Data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 2003­2006 showed that 34.1% of adolescents
were overweight and 17.6% were obese (7). In adolescents,
obesity increases the risks of diseases that were previously seen
mostly in adults, including hyperlipidemia (8), hypertension (9),
metabolic syndrome (10), and type 2 diabetes (11). Overweight in
adolescence may serve as a harbinger of adult disease (8). Thus, it
is important to understand the factors associated with overweight
in adolescents.
Few studies have looked at broad eating patterns, such as
snacking, and their associations with weight. Snacking was
shown to be associated with increased energy intake (12), par-
ticularly in adolescents (13). Snacking may be an important
strategy for meeting energy needs for increased physical activity
and for meeting recommended intakes of shortfall nutrients that
cannot be met with the consumption of only 3 meals/d (14),
particularly in populations at nutritional risk (15). Snacking
contributed an estimated 25% of dietary energy and contributed
significantly to nutrient intake (12, 14, 16) and the improvement
of diet quality; snacking also increased the likelihood of meeting
selected national food recommendations (12, 14). However, the
increased energy intake associated with snacking may reflect the
energy density and portion sizes of foods and beverages con-
sumed as snacks (13, 17, 18). Snacks tend to be lower in fat and
higher in carbohydrates than meals (19­21); however, snacking
may contribute to energy-dense, nutrient-poor diets (22).

The relation between snacking and the risk of overweight is not
clear. The Booth hypothesis (23) states that "grazing," or multiple
eating episodes between meals, rather than the traditional pattern
of 3 meals/d is a major factor that contributes to obesity. Contrary
to the Booth hypothesis, Fabry et al (24) showed that the con-
sumption of food more frequently throughout the day by adults
was negatively associated with body fatness compared with the
association for subjects who restricted their intake to 1or 2 meals/d.
More research is needed to establish the role of snacking in the
energy balance and maintenance of body weight. Results from
cross-sectional (12) and longitudinal (22) studies are equivocal.
Some research suggested that an increased snack frequency was
negatively associated with body weight (25); however, others
have shown that snacking was not associated with weight (12, 22)
and was not an independent predictor of weight gain (26). More
studies are needed to understand if snacking plays a role in
overweight within the context of the overall diet. The aims of this
study were to examine the associations of snacking frequency
with overweight and abdominal obesity in adolescents.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS
Study population
Data from adolescents 12­18 y of age who participated in the
1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 NHANES were com-
bined for these analyses. Pregnant or lactating girls were ex-
cluded from the analyses. This study was exempted by the
Institutional Review Board of the Louisiana State University
Agricultural Center.
Dietary assessment
Dietary data were obtained from 24-h recalls. Detailed
descriptions of the dietary interview methods are provided in the
NHANES Dietary Interviews Procedure Manual, which includes
pictures of the computer-assisted dietary interview system
screens, measurement guides, and charts used to collect dietary
information (27). Adolescents whose 24-h recall data were
judged to be incomplete or unreliable by staff of the National
Center for Health Statistics (Hyattsville, MD) were excluded
from these analyses.
Eating occasions were defined as a group of foods or beverages
consumed at the same time (hour:minute). The self-reported
name of the eating occasion type was used to identify eating
occasions that were called a snack in either the English version or
Spanish translation of the questionnaire. The Spanish translation
of a snack included the following: merienda (afternoon snack or
tea), entre comida (between meals), tentempie (snack or bite to
eat), botana (snack), or bocadillo (snack or bite). Although each
of the different named occasion types, including both snacks and
drinks, were given separate codes in NHANES 2003­2004 in the
earlier data sets, drinks were combined with snacks and given
the same code. Therefore, to manually separate snacks from
drinks in the NHANES 1999­2000 and 2001­2002 data sets,
each occasion (a group of foods or beverages consumed at the
same time) that was called a snack or drink was classified as
a snack that consisted of food accompanied by a beverage,
a snack that consisted of food consumed with no beverage, or
a drink that consisted of a beverage consumed with no food.
The snacking frequency (ie, a count of the number of snacks
consumed per day) and the percentage of total daily energy intake
contributed from snacks were measured. Adolescents were
classified by snacking frequency and the percentage of energy
from snacks to form 2 sets of snack consumption groups as
follows: 1) adolescents who ate 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4 snacks/d, and 2)
adolescents who ate snacks that contributed 0%, ,10%, 10­
19%, 20­29%, 30­39%, or 40% of their total daily energy
intakes.
Anthropometric assessment
The Anthropometry Procedures Manual (28) used in the
1999­2000, 2001­2002, and 2003­2004 NHANES provides
information about equipment, calibration, methods, quality
control, and survey procedures. Body mass index (BMI) was
calculated as body weight (kg) divided by height (m) squared.
The percentile of BMI-for-age was calculated with the Statistical
Analysis Software program for Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) Growth Charts (Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention, Atlanta, GA). Adolescents who had a BMI
85th percentile of BMI-for-age according to the CDC Growth
Charts were classified as overweight or obese. Reference per-
centiles of waist circumference for the adolescent's year of age
and sex were obtained (29), and abdominal obesity was defined
as a waist circumference 90th percentile.
Demographic and lifestyle factors
Survey questionnaire data were used to describe the distri-
bution of demographic and lifestyle factors in the adolescent
population. Adolescents were classified by age, and for each
demographic or lifestyle variable, the following categories were
defined: sex, ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Hispanic, or other), poverty-income ratio (100%, 101­185%,
186­350%, or .350% poverty), physical activity (none, light,
moderate, or vigorous), hours of television or videos watched or
computer use (,2, 2­3, or 4 h), cigarette smoking (smoker or
nonsmoker), and whether weight loss was attempted in the past
year (yes or no).
Statistical analyses
Sample-weighted data were used, and all analyses were per-
formed with SUDAAN software (release 9.0.1; Research Tri-
angle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) to adjust the
variance for the complex sample design (30). For the 6-y from
1999 to 2004, a 6-y Mobile Examination Center (MEC)­
examined sample-weight variable was created by assigning two-
thirds of the 4-y MEC-examined sample weight for 1999­2002 if
the person was sampled in 1999­2002 or one-third of the 2-y
MEC-examined sample weight for 2003­2004 if the person was
sampled in 2003­2004. The 6-y MEC-examined sample weight
was used in analyses of snacking, energy intake, body weight, and
other anthropometric data.
Demographic profiles, sample-weighted percentages (and SEs
of the percentages) of adolescents in snack-consumption groups,
and chi-square statistics were calculated with the PROC
CROSSTAB procedure of SUDAAN software. Mean snacking
frequency, and percentage of energy from snacks measured for
demographic/lifestyle groups without controlling for covariates,

the SEs of the means, and t test statistics for differences between
means were calculated with the PROC DESCRIP procedure of
SUDAAN software. Tests for mean differences between de-
mographic and lifestyle groups were performed by using the
Bonferroni method to adjust the significance level for multiple
comparisons. For example, if there were 3 comparisons of
groups, the 0.05 level was divided by 3, and the means of the
groups were significantly different only if the P value of the
contrast was ,0.0167.
To control for covariates in an analysis of variance, least-
square mean energy intake and least-square mean weight and
adiposity measures, SEs of the least-square means, and tests for
trends were calculated with the PROC REGRESS procedure of
SUDAAN software. The adjusted prevalence of a risk factor was
measured by calculating the least-square mean of a dichotomous
variable with the PROC REGRESS procedure. In the first set of
linear regression analyses (model 1), least-square means were
calculated to adjust the between-group differences for age (y),
sex, and ethnicity. In model 2, effects on the snacking-weight
relation of additional covariates that might be operating down-
stream, such as income, physical activity, television and com-
puter use, and smoking, were tested along with the basic
demographic covariates age, sex, and ethnicity. To control for the
possibility that an observed association of snacking with weight
may be due to reverse causality, whether the adolescent had tried
to lose weight was entered in model 3 along with all of the other
covariates (ie, age, sex, ethnicity, income, television and com-
puter use, and smoking).
Odds ratio for overweight or obesity and abdominal obesi-
ty were calculated with the PROC LOGISTIC procedure of
SUDAAN software. Again, the 3 regression models were tested
as the basic demographic covariates, additional demographic/
lifestyle covariates, and the attempted weight loss covariate were
entered in blocks. With groups defined by either snacking fre-
quency or percentage of energy from snacks, compared with
nonsnack consumers (the reference category), the statistical
significance of risks associated with each increasing snack-
consumption group was measured by testing whether the 95% CI
around the odds ratio overlapped with the value 1.0 (the odds ratio
given to the reference category).
RESULTS
On average, adolescents consumed a mean (6SE) of 1.64 6
0.03 snacks/d, and energy intake from snacks contributed 21.1 6
0.4% of daily energy intake (Table 1). Girls consumed a greater

number of snacks than boys (1.69 6 0.04 compared with 1.59 6
0.04 snacks/d, respectively; P , 0.05). The frequency of snack
consumption was higher in non-Hispanic black adolescents
than in non-Hispanic white adolescents (1.73 6 0.03 compared
with 1.63 6 0.04 snacks/d, respectively; P , 0.05), and the
percentage of energy from snacks was higher (P , 0.05) for
non-Hispanic blacks (24.7 6 0.4% of energy) than for either
non-Hispanic whites (20.3 6 0.4% of energy) or Hispanics (19.9
6 0.6% of energy). Television, video, or computer use was
positively associated with snacking; adolescents who sat 4 h/
d in front of a television or computer screen consumed a greater
percentage of energy from snacks than adolescents who had
screen times of ,2 h/d (22.2 6 0.6% compared with 19.8 6
0.6% of energy, respectively; P , 0.05). A lower percentage of
energy from snacks was consumed by adolescents who reported
that they had tried to lose weight (19.2 6 0.9% compared with
21.5 6 0.4% of energy, respectively; P , 0.05).
Adolescents were classified into groups defined by frequency
of snack consumption and by the contribution of snacks to daily
energy intake. The population distribution and mean energy
intakes of both sets of snack consumption groups are shown in
(Table 2). The number of snacks per day and percentage of
energy contributed from snacks were both positively associated
(P , 0.01) with total dietary energy intake.
Covariate-adjusted mean weight, BMI, percentile of BMI-for-
age, and waist circumference were all inversely associated with
snacking frequency and percentage of energy from snacks
(Tables 3 and 4). The prevalences of overweight and abdominal
obesity also decreased with increased snacking frequency and
with increased percentage of energy from snacks.
Odds ratios from logistic regression analyses are shown in
Tables 5 and 6. A decrease in the odds ratio with an increase in
the snacking frequency indicated that snack consumers who ate
2, 3, and 4 snacks/d were less likely than nonsnackers to be
overweight. Similarly, as snacking frequency increased from
0 to 2 snacks/d, risks for abdominal obesity were also reduced.
In addition, reduced risks for overweight and abdominal obesity
were shown to be associated with snacking that contributed
20% of energy.
Three regression models showed similar results. Covariates
with snacking and potential confounders of their association with
overweight and abdominal obesity included age, sex, and eth-
nicity in model 1; household income, physical activity, television,
video, or computer use, and smoking were added to the basic
demographic covariates in model 2; and whether the adolescent
had tried to lose weight was included in model 3. Energy intake
was considered a mediator between snacking and the outcome
variables and was not included in the models shown. However,
results of analyses in which the report of energy intake was
considered a potential confounder of the association between
snacking and weight were similar (data not shown). When
adolescents who had tried to lose weight were excluded from the

DISCUSSION
Many biological and environmental factors have likely con-
tributed to the current epidemic of childhood obesity; however,
successful prevention strategies must focus on the factors most
amenable to change. The role of specific eating patterns in the
promotion of overweight in the pediatric population represents
one potential intervention approach and is the subject of much
debate. Snacking is one eating pattern that has been understudied.
The findings that relate snacking patterns to weight are in-
consistent, which makes them difficult to interpret. More studies
are needed to understand more fully if snacking plays a role in
childhood obesity.
From 1977 to 1996, the percentage of adolescents who
reported snacking in a US national survey increased from 76% to
88% (13). During this period, the mean number of snacks
consumed daily by adolescents increased from 1.60 to 1.97 and
represented 21% to 25% of total daily energy intake, respectively.
In this most recent analysis of a 1999­2004 national survey,
a mean number of 1.64 snacks were consumed, and 21% of total
energy was from snacks. Although it appears that the mean
number of snacks consumed and percentage energy from snacks
may have decreased in the past several years, it is difficult to make
comparisons between the 2 studies because the datasets used
and the snacking definitions were different. Beverage breaks
(between-meal drinks with no solid food) were combined with
snacks before NHANES 2003­2004, and in the most recent
analysis, beverage breaks were separated from snacks. In
NHANES 1999­2004, on average, adolescents had 0.64 beverage
breaks/d, and 6.1% of their energy intake came from these
beverage breaks (data not shown).
The most compelling findings from this study were the con-
sistent inverse associations of snacking with overweight and
abdominal obesity in adolescents after controlling for appropriate
covariates. Snacking frequency was inversely associated with all
6 weight and obesity measures examined. These 6 weight
measures were also inversely associated with the percentage
energy coming from snacks. Logistic regression models showed

that adolescents who consumed 2 snacks/d were less likely
than nonsnack consumers to be overweight, and eating 2
snacks/d was also associated with reduced risks for abdominal
obesity. These analyses used 3 sequential regression models to
examine effects on the outcome measures with and without the
entry of demographic or lifestyle factors that could have been
operating downstream from snacking behaviors.
The debate over snacking and its association with weight
continues (12, 25, 26). We hypothesize that energy intake is
a mediating variable in this snack-weight association. There are
several reasons to suggest that snacking might increase energy
intake and promote weight gain. First, snacking might increase
energy intake beyond the needs for energy expenditure if there is
no compensation for additional energy from snacks in subsequent
meals. Second, if snack foods derive a substantial amount of
energy from fat, and because fat at 9 kcal/g is more energy-dense
than carbohydrates or proteins (4 kcal/g), the unregulated con-
sumption of snack foods could increase energy intake beyond the
needs for energy expenditure and promote weight gain. In
contrast, studies have shown that snack foods, compared with
foods consumed at meals, are actually lower in fat and higher in
carbohydrates (19­21); therefore, individuals who snack regu-
larly may be more successful at managing weight by the re-
placement of fat with carbohydrates (19, 31). Research has shown
that a higher eating frequency can assist with weight management
as well (19, 31, 32).
An inverse association between snacking and weight was also
shown by other authors, despite the increased energy intake
associated with snacking (14, 33). Snacking was shown to be
associated with improved diet quality (12, 17, 33) and increased
intakes of fruit, whole grains, and fiber (12, 17), which could
promote satiety and reduce risks for obesity. Snacking was also
associated with increased vigorous physical activity (14, 34);
thus, the increased energy intake associated with snacking may
have been compensated for by increased energy expenditure
during physical activity. It is possible that there could be an
inverse association between snacking and weight if snackers
exercise more than nonsnackers because exercise promotes
weight loss. An inverse association of snacking with weight could
also be explained if overweight individuals who try to lose weight
avoid eating snacks. Although an assessment of physical activity
and whether the respondent had tried to lose weight were each
included as covariates in subsequent analyses, there may have
been some residual confounding. There were no statistical
controls for improvements in diet quality, which could explain the
inverse association of snacking with weight.
It is possible that the inverse association of snacking with
weight is a result of underreporting, particularly snacks, in
overweight individuals (25, 31). Although this may be the case,
data from this study and others have shown that there was an
increase in energy intake with reported snacking (12, 14, 33).
Although energy intake was initially considered a mediating
variable between snacking and weight and, therefore, not in-
cluded as a covariate in the model, and because lower energy
intake could be a marker for underreporting that potentially
confounds the association between snacking and weight, sub-
sequent analyses did include energy intake as a covariate.
However, the same inverse association observed without energy
intake in the model continued to persist. More studies are needed
to examine whether the increased energy intake reported for those
who snack is an artifact of underreporting or is due to increased
compensation for physical activity or a lack of compensation at
subsequent meals.
Television viewing appears to be associated with snacking.
Adolescents snacked, on average, 3.5 times/wk while watching
television (35). The results from this study extend these findings
by showing that the percentage of energy from snacks was higher
in adolescents who spent 4 h in front of a television, video, or
computer. Television viewing may be a contributing factor to
obesity in youth (19, 36, 37) through several possible mecha-
nisms that include the influence of food advertising on food-
consumption patterns, snacking while watching television, and
displacement of physical activity. However, these pathways are
complicated and poorly understood, and studies that examined
the relation between television and BMI produced mixed results
(12, 36, 37). One longitudinal study showed a positive relation

between energy-dense food consumption and television viewing;
however, energy-dense food consumption did not influence
weight status or a change in fatness over the adolescent period
(22). More research is needed to better understand the relation
between snacking and television, video, or computer use.
The lack of consistency among studies may be due to dif-
ferent definitions being used to define snacking or different
assessment methods (38, 39). Moreover, the survey year in
which the study was conducted, other lifestyle factors associ-
ated with snacking, and the number of covariates controlled for
in the analyses varied across studies and may be important to
interpret the results.
This study has several limitations. As with all cross-sectional
studies, no cause-and-effect relations could be determined. Data
from 24-h dietary recalls may not reflect usual intake (40) be-
cause they rely on memory, and subjects may underreport or
overreport (41, 42). Energy-dense, nutrient-poor foods and
beverages tend to be underreported (41, 43); however, reported
energy intakes in this population were plausible for adolescents.
In conclusion, data from this study suggest that increased
snacking was inversely associated with overweight and ab-
dominal obesity in adolescents. Because of inconsistent evidence
in the literature, longitudinal studies are needed to further
evaluate whether snacking prevents weight gain in adolescents.
