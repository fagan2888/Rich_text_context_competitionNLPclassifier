ABSTRACT
In peripheral nerves, Schwann cell development is regulated
by a variety of signals. Some of the aspects of Schwann
cell differentiation can be reproduced in vitro in response
to forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator elevating intracel-
lular cAMP levels. Herein, the effect of forskolin treatment
was investigated by a comprehensive genome-wide expres-
sion study on primary mouse Schwann cell cultures. Addi-
tional to myelin-related genes, many so far unconsidered
genes were ascertained to be modulated by forskolin. One
of the strongest differentially regulated gene transcripts was
the transcription factor Olig1 (oligodendrocyte transcription
factor 1), whose mRNA expression levels were reduced in
treated Schwann cells. Olig1 protein was localized in myeli-
nating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells within the sci-
atic nerve as well as in primary Schwann cells, proposing
it as a novel transcription factor of the Schwann cell lin-
eage. Data analysis further revealed that a number of differ-
entially expressed genes in forskolin-treated Schwann cells
were associated with the ECM (extracellular matrix), under-
lining its importance during Schwann cell differentiation
in vitro. Comparison of samples derived from postnatal sci-
atic nerves and from both treated and untreated Schwann
cell cultures showed considerable differences in gene ex-
pression between in vivo and in vitro, allowing us to sepa-
rate Schwann cell autonomous from tissue-related changes.
The whole data set of the cell culture microarray study is
provided to offer an interactive search tool for genes of
interest.

INTRODUCTION
Schwann cells are the glia cells of the PNS (peripheral nervous
system). Throughout the entire Schwann cell lineage, both
an autocrine mechanism and axon­glia interaction control
the survival, proliferation and differentiation of Schwann
cells (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky, 2005). Schwann cells
derive from neural crest cells, and migrate tightly associ-
ated with axons to reach distal targets. At approximately
E17, Schwann cell precursors become immature Schwann
cells ensheathing large axon bundles. The transition en-
tails an orchestrated change in response to survival sig-
nals and growth factors. Around birth in rodents, imma-
ture Schwann cells differentiate into either myelinating or
nonmyelinating Schwann cells. This step from an immature
to a mature Schwann cell coincides with major changes in
their cellular architecture. Generally, axons with a diame-
ter larger than 1 m are segregated to form a one-to-one
relation with a Schwann cell, and thereafter will be myeli-
nated (Peters and Muir, 1959; Voyvodic, 1989). On the other
hand, small caliber axons remain engulfed by nonmyelinat-
ing Schwann cells. In addition to fiber diameter, recipro-
cal signaling between Schwann cells and neurons influence
the Schwann cell fate; neurotrophins and growth factors,
such as neuregulin1 type III were identified as regulators
for Schwann cell differentiation (reviewed in Salzer, 2012).
Transition into myelinating Schwann cells is also mediated
by cAMP (cyclic adenosine monophosphate), which acts as a
second messenger. Upon ligand binding, the intracellular het-
erotrimeric G protein complex activates the adenylyl cyclase,
converting ATP into the second messenger cAMP (Hanoune
and Defer, 2001). The PKA (protein kinase A) is activated in
the presence of cAMP, which in turn stimulates the CREB

D. Schmid and others
(cAMP-response-element-binding protein) signal transduc-
tion pathway (reviewed in Meijer, 2009). The Gpr126 (G-
protein-coupled receptor 126) is the so far only receptor
identified to drive Schwann cell differentiation by elevating
cAMP levels (Monk et al., 2009). Mutation in Gpr126 causes
hypomyelination and retarded axonal segregation in the PNS,
and cAMP elevation by forskolin treatment was sufficient to
restore myelination (Monk et al., 2009; Monk et al., 2011).
Elevation of intracellular cAMP has been shown to induce
myelin-related gene expression such as Mpz/P0 (myelin pro-
tein zero), Krox20 (Egr2) and Galc (galactosylceramidase) in
rat and human Schwann cell cultures (Lemke and Chao, 1988;
Monuki et al., 1989; Parkinson et al., 2003; Monje et al., 2009).
Furthermore, activation of the cAMP pathway decreases ex-
pression of proteins implicated in immature or nonmyeli-
nating Schwann cells, such as the low-affinity neurotrophin
receptor p75NTR, Gfap (glial fibrillary acidic protein), Gap43
(growth-associated protein 43) and cJun (Morgan et al., 1991;
Monje et al., 2009). The effect of cAMP elevation was hitherto
analyzed in respect to transcriptional induction of particu-
lar genes known to be important in differentiation, but its
precise effect on mouse Schwann cells is not known yet.
Herein, we performed a comprehensive genome-wide ex-
pression study on primary mouse Schwann cell cultures
treated with the adenylyl cyclase activator forskolin. A de-
tailed knowledge of the effect of forskolin on Schwann cells
in vitro is decisive, since the cAMP signaling pathway was
suggested to interfere also with other signaling pathways
such as the PI3-kinase and the MAP (mitogen-activated
protein)-kinase pathways (Stewart et al., 1996; Kim et al.,
1997; Cohen and Frame, 2001; Grimes and Jope, 2001; Ogata
et al., 2004; Monje et al., 2006; Monje et al., 2010). Our com-
prehensive analysis identified transcriptional changes of so
far disregarded genes induced by elevated cAMP levels in
primary mouse Schwann cell cultures. The functional roles
of most of these genes are not yet known in the Schwann
cell lineage, but they might be new candidates to be consid-
ered. Furthermore, we compared the expression pattern of
differentially expressed transcripts from naive and forskolin-
treated cultured Schwann cells with those from sciatic nerve
samples of particular postnatal developmental stages. The
whole data set of the microarray study on primary mouse
Schwann cell cultures is provided to offer an interactive
search tool for genes of interest, analyzing their expression
pattern in cultured Schwann cells upon forskolin treatment.
MATERIAL AND METHODS
Mice
C57BL/6 mice were kept under standard SPF-conditions,
housed and treated according to the guidelines for care and
use of experimental animals of the veterinary office of the
Canton of Basel.
Primary mouse Schwann cell cultures
Schwann cells were prepared from P1 (postnatal day 1)
mouse sciatic nerves, and dissociated with 0.4% (w/v) colla-
genase and 0.125% (w/v) trypsin. DMEM (Dulbecco's modi-
fied Eagle's medium; D6546, Sigma-Aldrich) supplemented
with 10% (v/v) FBS was added, and cells were seeded
onto 24-well plates (PrimariaTM, BD Bioscience). A day af-
ter, Schwann cells were treated with 10 M cytosine -D-
arabinofuranoside (AraC) twice for 24 h to reduce fibroblast
proliferation. Schwann cells were passaged, and cells were
pooled and cultured in DMEM containing 10% (v/v) FBS.
For mRNA expression analysis, primary Schwann cells were
seeded at a density of 25000 cells/well. For immunofluores-
cence analysis, 10000 Schwann cells were seeded on poly-D-
lysine and laminin-coated glass coverslips in a 50 l drop.
For Schwann cell differentiation assay, cells were stimu-
lated with 20 M forskolin (Sigma-Aldrich) in DMEM sup-
plemented with 10% (v/v) FBS for 24 h. Purity of mouse
Schwann cell cultures determined by immunofluorescent
stainings for p75NTR and S100 revealed more than 85%
enrichment.
qRT­PCR expression analysis
Schwann cells were washed with PBS, and total RNA was
isolated using RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to
the manufacturer's protocol. For the in vivo analysis, 54
sciatic nerves were pooled to nine experimental samples
(n = 9) at P0, 36 nerves were pooled to nine experimental
samples (n = 9) at P3, P9 and P21, and 16 nerves were
pooled to eight experimental samples (n = 8) for adult mice,
and total RNA was isolated using ZR RNA MicroPrepTM Kit
(Zymo Research). For both in vivo and in vitro studies, first
strand cDNA synthesis was performed using GoScriptTM
Reverse Transcriptase (Promega) and random hexamer
primers (Roche). Primers for qRT­PCR were designed with
NCBI PrimerBLAST (Supplementary Table S1; available
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm).
Primer pairs were chosen to overlap exon/intron junctions
to prevent amplification of genomic DNA. qRT­PCR was
performed on the ViiATM 7 Real-Time PCR System (Applied
Biosystems) with KAPA SYBR Fast Master Mix (Kapa Biosys-
tems) or Power SYBR Master Mix (Applied Biosystems). The
acquired mRNA copy numbers were normalized to the one
of the 60S ribosomal protein subunit L13a. In vitro data
represent the mean of 12 samples per condition derived
from five independent experiments, and error bars indicate
the S.D. (standard deviation). In vivo data represent the
mean of at least eight experimental samples per time point,
and error bars indicate the S.D.. Statistical quantification
was performed by a Student's t test for unpaired groups.

Effect of forskolin on mouse Schwann cells
Whole-genome expression profiling
Schwann cells were stimulated with or without 20 M
forskolin for 24 h as described above. Eighteen cultures were
investigated, complied by nine cultures per condition, de-
rived from five independent experiments. The in vivo microar-
ray expression analysis was performed with 28 sciatic nerves
pooled to seven experimental samples (n = 7) at P0 and P10,
20 nerves pooled to five experimental samples (n = 5) at P4
and P7 and six nerves pooled to three experimental sam-
ples (n = 3) at P60. Total RNA was isolated using the RNeasy
Micro Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer's proto-
col. All RNA samples had an RIN (RNA integrity number) of
above 8, verified with the Agilent Bioanalyzer system (Agi-
lent Technologies). RNA amplification, biotinylation, in vitro
transcription and cRNA hybridization was performed as de-
scribed before (Kinter et al., 2013). MouseWG-6 v2.0 Expres-
sion BeadChips from Illumina were scanned using the iScan
Reader (Illumina), and global median normalization of gene
expression was performed with the GenomeStudio software
(version 2011.1, Illumina). One coding DNA sequence may
be represented by several distinct oligonucleotides (called
probes). For all examinations, probe-specific analysis was
performed, allowing to identify differentially expressed tran-
scripts with high confidence. All data passed the quality con-
trol analysis as assessed by the Illumina on-board software
(GenomeStudio, version 2011.1) and by PCA (principal com-
ponent analysis; Partek Genomics Suite, version 6.6, Partek
Inc.). Statistical analysis was performed using Partek Genomic
Suite software (version 6.6, Partek Inc.). Differentially ex-
pressed transcripts were identified by a two-way ANOVA,
and P-values were adjusted using the FDR (false discovery
rate) method to correct for multiple comparisons (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995). Significantly differentially expressed
genes were further analyzed with the IPA (Ingenuity Pathway
Analysis) software (Ingenuity Systems), the DAVID (Database
for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery (ver-
sion 6.7) Bioinformatics Resources (Huang da et al., 2009)
and TransFind (Kielbasa et al., 2010). We provided the gen-
erated database as an interactive search tool to analyze
the expression pattern of genes of interest upon forskolin
treatment.
Antibodies
The following primary antibodies were used: anti-MBP
(rat, 1:800, Chemicon), anti-neurofilament (mouse, 1:800,
SMI31, Covance), anti-Olig1 (rabbit, 1:1000, Abcam), anti-
p75NTR (rabbit, 1:500, Promega), anti-S100 (rabbit, 1:500,
Dako).
The following secondary antibodies were used:
donkey-anti-rabbit AlexaFluor488, donkey-anti-mouse Dy-
Light549, donkey-anti-rat AlexaFluor647 (all 1:500, Jack-
son ImmunoResearch Laboratories), DAPI (4 ,6-diamidino-2-
phenylindole) (1.25 g/ml; Molecular Probes) was used as
cellular counter stain.
Immunofluorescent microscopy
10 m sections of fresh frozen torso of P7 mice were
mounted on gelatin/chrome alum-coated slides, dried at
room temperature, and fixed for 15 min in 4% (w/v) PFA
(paraformaldehyde) in PBS. Sections were washed three times
for 15 min in PBS, and unspecific binding sites were im-
peded by incubation with blocking buffer containing 1%
(v/v) normal donkey serum (Chemicon Int.), 2% (v/v) cold
fish skin gelatin (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.15% (v/v) Triton X-100
(Sigma-Aldrich) in PBS for 1 h at room temperature. Pri-
mary antibodies were incubated in blocking buffer at 4C
overnight. Fluorochrome-conjugated secondary antibodies
were diluted in blocking buffer, and incubated for 1 h at room
temperature. Stained sections were embedded in FluorSave
(Calbiochem). For stainings of Schwann cell cultures, cells
were rinsed with PBS, and fixed with 4% (v/v) PFA in PBS
for 15 min. Further procedure was performed as described
above. Fluorescence microscopy images were acquired with
the confocal microscope Nikon A1R (40× objective, numeri-
cal aperture 1.3) or Zeiss LSM 710 (63× objective, numerical
aperture 1.4), using photomultiplier tube detectors. Image
quantification was performed with Imaris software (version
7.6.4, Bitplane) and processing with ImageJ 1.47b software
and Adobe Photoshop software (version CS5.1).
RESULTS
Forskolin induced transcriptional regulation of
genes involved in Schwann cell development
One key signaling pathway for Schwann cell differentiation
and peripheral myelination is mediated by cAMP levels. This
signal transduction pathway can be activated in vitro by
forskolin, an adenylyl cyclase activator. Since primary rat and
mouse Schwann cells in cultures react distinct upon particu-
lar stimulation reagents (Yamada et al., 1995), we examined
in detail the effect of forskolin on gene transcriptional regu-
lation in primary mouse Schwann cell cultures. Schwann cells
isolated from sciatic nerves of P1 mice were cultured in the
presence or absence of forskolin for 24 h. We ascertained the
optimal forskolin concentration of 20 M, which resulted
in robustly induced transcription of Mpz/P0, a commonly
used marker for Schwann cell differentiation (D. Schmid, T.
Zeis, M. Sobrio and N. Schaeren-Wiemers, unpublished work).
A whole-genome expression assay was performed to iden-
tify transcriptional changes induced by forskolin treatment
in mouse Schwann cells in vitro, and about 22000 tran-
scripts were consistently expressed in cultured Schwann cells.
The generated database is provided as an interactive search
tool to analyze the expression pattern of genes of interest
upon forskolin treatment (Interactive Excel file; available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm). First,

forskolin-dependent transcriptional expression of genes that
are implicated in Schwann cell development, differenti-
ation and myelination were analyzed (Table 1). For il-
lustration, selected genes were schematically grouped ac-
cording to their temporal expression in the Schwann
cell lineage (Supplementary Figure S1; available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm).
Analysis of transcription factors revealed a strong induc-
tion upon forskolin treatment for the mRNA expression levels
of Egr3 and Oct6 (Pou3f1), a major target of cAMP signal-
ing in Schwann cells (Monuki et al., 1989) (Table 1A). In-
creased transcription was also detected of Krox24 (Egr1),
the Egr1-binding protein 2 (Nab2) and the inhibitor of DNA
binding 2 and 4 (Id2, Id4). Reduced mRNA expression levels
were present for the transcription factors AP2 (Tcfap2a) and
cJun (Jun), which is in accordance to their down-regulation
during development in vivo (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky,
2005). For Krox20 (Egr2) and Sox10, which was strongly ex-
pressed in primary Schwann cells, no significant forskolin-
dependent regulation was observed. Investigation of recep-
tors, which were implicated in Schwann cell signaling, re-
vealed that the expression levels of the tyrosine kinase re-
ceptors ErbB2, TrkB (Ntrk2) and TrkC (Ntrk3) were signifi-
cantly increased by forskolin (Table 1B). Forskolin treatment
led to a small reduction of the neurotrophin receptor p75NTR
(Ngfr), in accordance to previous reports on rat Schwann
cell cultures (Morgan et al., 1991; Monje et al., 2009). It re-
sulted also in increased transcription of the myelin-related
genes Mpz, peripheral myelin protein 22 (Pmp22) and lipin1
(Lpn1) (Table 1C). No transcriptional regulation could be de-
tected for 2 ,3 -cyclic nucleotide 3 phosphodiesterase (Cnp),
the myelin-associated glycoprotein (Mag) and the myelin and
lymphocyte protein (Mal), and reduced expression levels of
plasmolipin (Pllp) and myelin basic protein (Mbp) were de-
tected in treated Schwann cells. However, sequence analysis
of the Mbp probes revealed that they code also for Golli
Mbp variants, having a distinct expression pattern and func-
tion during glia development compared with classical MBP
isoforms (Campagnoni et al., 1993; Pribyl et al., 1996).
During myelination, the synthesis of large amounts of
lipids is important for accurate myelin formation. For this
reason, the effect of forskolin treatment was investigated
on the regulation of genes involved in lipid biosynthesis in
Schwann cells (Table 1D). Significantly increased transcrip-
tion levels were detected for the stearoyl-coenzyme A desat-
urase 1 (Scd1), the UDP-glucose ceramide glucosyltransferase
(Ugcg, Gcs) and the UDP galactosyltransferase 8A (Ugt8a,
Cgt, mCerGT), the rate-limiting enzyme of the cerebroside
biosynthesis (Morell and Radin, 1969).
Our data analysis revealed that forskolin treatment of cul-
tured mouse Schwann cells led to up-regulation of a number
of transcripts which are important during Schwann cell dif-
ferentiation in vivo, and to reduced transcription of genes
known to be expressed in neural crest cells and Schwann
cell precursors in vivo (reviewed in Jessen and Mirsky,
2005).
Forskolin-induced transcriptional regulation in
Schwann cells
To further investigate the effect of forskolin on tran-
scriptional regulation in cultured mouse Schwann cells,
microarray data were analyzed more stringently using an
FDR-adjusted P-value of <0.05. This study revealed that
forskolin treatment resulted in increased expression of 330
transcripts by at least 1.5-fold, and in decreased expression
of 305 transcripts (Supplementary Table S2; available
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm).
Among the 25 strongest induced genes, Mpz was the solely
typical so far known myelin-related gene (Table 2A). Strong
transcriptional induction was detected for the sclerostin
domain containing 1 (Sostdc1), the pleckstrin homology
domain containing family A (Plekha4) and the ECM (ex-
tracellular matrix) protein spondin 2 (Spon2). Furthermore,
increased transcription was detected for the transcription
factor Egr3, as already stated before (Table 1A), the fibro-
blast growth factor 7 (Fgf7), the endothelin receptor type B
(Ednrb) and the proteoglycan decorin (Dcn), to name a few.
Strongest down-regulation upon forskolin treatment was
detected for the mRNA expression levels of protocadherin
20 (Pcdh20, also known as Pcdh13), phosphodiesterase
1B (Pde1b) and leucine-rich repeats and transmembrane
domains 1 (Lrtm1), each represented by two transcripts
(Table 2B). Olig1 was the only transcription factor identified
among the 25 strongest reduced transcripts. Strong tran-
scriptional reduction was also identified for the chondroitin
sulfate proteoglycan 4 [Cspg4, better known as neuron-glial
antigen 2 (NG2)], the proteoglycan aggrecan (Acan), the
secreted matrix Gla protein (Mgp) and the platelet-derived
growth factor subunit B (Pdgfb). qRT­PCR of these highly
differentially expressed transcripts validated our microarray
for the one which were significantly increased upon forskolin
treatment (Figure 1A) as well as for the ones which were
down-regulated upon forskolin treatment with the sole
exception of Nme7 (Figure 1B).
In summary, cAMP elevation led to differential expres-
sion of more than 600 transcripts in primary mouse Schwann
cell cultures. Among the 25 strongest induced genes, Mpz
was the only well-known myelin-related gene, disclosing the
possibility that new genes important for Schwann cell dif-
ferentiation were identified by this microarray analysis.
Olig1 expression in the PNS
The transcription factor Olig1 was identified to be strongly
down-regulated in forskolin-treated mouse Schwann cells.
Although Olig1 is known to play an important functional role
in differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells (Li et al.,
2007), its expression in the Schwann cell lineage is not known.
For this reason, the expression of Olig1 protein was investi-
gated on sciatic nerves of P7 mice. Colocalization analysis
revealed Olig1 immunofluorescent signal primarily in MBP-
negative areas consisting of small diameter axons identified
by neurofilament (Figure 2B, inset and Figure 2D, arrows).

The differential expression of the strongest increased (A) and decreased (B)

treated primary mouse Schwann cells. Data were normalized to the ex-
pression of 60s. The columns represent the mean value of 12 experimental
samples, and the error bars indicate the S.D. *: P 0.005, **: P 0.0001,

identified to be Olig1 positive (Figures 2A and 2C, arrow-
heads). To determine Olig1 transcription during peripheral
nerve development, its mRNA expression levels were inves-
tigated by qRT-PCR in sciatic nerves at P0, P3, P9, P21 and
in adult mice (Figure 2D). Expression analysis of Olig1 mRNA
levels during peripheral nerve development revealed progres-
sively increased transcription correlating with Schwann cell
maturation. In contrast to Mpz, Olig1 mRNA expression levels
remained high in adult nerves. Confocal immunofluorescence
microscopy identified Olig1 localization in the cytoplasm as
well as in the nucleus of Schwann cells (Figure 2E). Quantifi-
cation of the average immunofluorescent signal revealed a
significant higher intensity in the cytoplasm compared with
the nucleus (results not shown). From our analysis, we con-
clude that Olig1 is expressed in Schwann cells although at
lower levels than in the CNS (central nervous system) (results
not shown).
Analysis of possible forskolin-dependent
upstream regulators
Putative forskolin-dependent upstream regulators were
identified by IPA (Ingenuity Pathway Analysis), based on the
highly significantly regulated transcripts (Supplementary
Table S2). The highest significantly proposed upstream
regulator was identified as `forskolin' (Table 3). Furthermore,
three kinases playing a role in regulating the NF-B
(nuclear factor B) pathway were suggested as upstream
regulators, namely the inhibitor of NF-B kinase subunit

Figure 2 Expression of Olig1 in sciatic nerves and cultured Schwann cells
Immunofluorescent stainings of transversal (A) and longitudinal (C) tissue sec-
tions of sciatic nerves from P7 mice revealed Olig1 immunofluorescence in
Remak bundles (arrows), identified by a bundle of unmyelinated (MBP-neg-
ative) small diameter axons, and in a subset of myelinating Schwann cells
(arrowheads). (B) Remak bundle localization was confirmed by the expression
of p75NTR. (D) A progressive increase of Olig1 mRNA expression levels was de-
tected during peripheral nerve development by qRT­PCR. Data were normalized
to the expression of 60s, and values at P0 were set to 1. Each data point repre-
sent the mean value of at least eight experimental samples, and the error bars
indicate the S.D. (E) In vitro, Olig1 expression was predominantly detected in
the cytoplasm of cultured Schwann cells (E, arrows), whereas nuclear staining
was significantly weaker (E, arrowheads). NF: neurofilament. Bar: A: 100 m;

 (CHUK), the I-B kinase subunit  (IKBKG) and the I-
B kinase subunit  (IKBKB). In addition, the signal trans-
ducer and activator of transcription 3 (Stat3) and Sox10
were proposed to be involved in the regulation of some
of the differentially expressed genes. Notch1 was proposed
as the most significant inhibited upstream regulator, well
in line with the negative effect of Notch signaling on pe-
ripheral myelination (Woodhoo et al., 2009). In addition,
inhibitory modulation was proposed for the small GTP-
binding protein Rac1 and the MAPK-kinase MEK 1 and 2
(MAP2K1/2).
An important question to solve is whether there are
putative transcription factor binding sites in promoter re-
gions of co-regulated genes, allowing to identify transcrip-
tion factors that might cause some of the observed al-
terations. Using TransFind, a web-based software tool, the
affinity of a transcription factor to the putative promoters
of the genes ( - 300 bp upstream to + 100 bp downstream
of transcription start site) was predicted in silico (Kielbasa
et al., 2010). First, genes with induced mRNA expression lev-
els due to forskolin treatment were analyzed (Table 4A). The
most significant prediction was for the transcription fac-
tor matrix of the KROX family, containing Krox24 (Egr1),
Krox20 (Egr2), Egr3 and NGFI-C (Egr4) and the distally re-
lated Wilms' tumor 1 (Wt1) (Chavrier et al., 1988; Lemaire
et al., 1988; Call et al., 1990; Gessler et al., 1990; Patward-
han et al., 1991; Crosby et al., 1992). In addition, genes with
a binding site for the transcription factors spermatogenic
leucine zipper 1 (Spz1) and Wt1 were significantly over-
represented in forskolin-induced genes. We could further
identify that several genes with reduced mRNA expression
levels in treated Schwann cells contain a binding site for the
transcription factor HEB (also known as transcription fac-
tor 12, Tcf12) or the myocyte enhancer factor-2 (MEF-2)
(Table 4B).
GO-annotations in differentiated Schwann cells
The usage of GO (gene ontology) annotations allows an-
alyzing differentially expressed transcripts by means of a
controlled vocabulary, in respect to the categories of cel-
lular components, molecular functions and biological pro-
cesses (Figure 3 and Supplementary Table S4; available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm). Ana-
lysis of molecular functions revealed that forskolin-induced
transcripts were associated with cytoskeletal protein bind-
ing, actin binding and ECM binding, as well as with cytokine
and chemokine activity. Investigation of GO-annotations on
cellular components revealed a high association of both
sets of transcripts with the ECM, the extracellular region
and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, genes with re-
duced mRNA expression levels in treated cells showed en-
richment for the annotations basement membrane and inte-
grin complex. Analysis of the category `biological processes'
revealed that increased and decreased transcripts were often

Figure 3 GO-annotations of differentially expressed genes due to forskolin treatment
Analysis of molecular functions revealed that several transcripts increased with forskolin are associated with cytoskeletal protein and
actin binding. Both sets of transcripts either increased or decreased due to forskolin manifested association with the cellular com-
ponent of ECM and with the plasma membrane. The term of basement membrane and integrin complex was exclusively enriched in
forskolin-reduced transcripts. GO-annotation analysis of transcripts decreased with forskolin showed an enrichment of genes impli-
cated in intracellular signaling cascade and in the MAPKK cascade. Raw data are provided as Supplementary Table S4 (available at
http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm).

this analysis revealed that several forskolin-induced
gene transcripts were associated with the ECM­receptor
interaction (Table 5A). Pathway analysis of transcripts, which
were reduced upon elevation of cAMP levels revealed the
strongest enrichment for the focal adhesion pathway (Ta-
ble 5B). In line with induced transcripts, ECM­receptor inter-
action was also proposed as a putative pathway for the set
of genes with decreased mRNA expression levels in treated
Schwann cells. Furthermore, the MAPK (MAP-kinase) signal-
ing pathway was identified to be overrepresented in this set
of transcripts. Based on the pathway analysis, we conclude
that a number of differentially regulated transcripts were

Effect of forskolin on mouse Schwann cells
associated with the ECM­receptor interaction as well as with
the focal adhesion pathway, implicating that a major effect
of forskolin might be the modulation of the ECM and the
cytoskeleton.
Forskolin-dependent regulation of components
of the ECM
To determine the effect of elevated cAMP levels by forskolin
on transcriptional regulation of components of the ECM and
the basal lamina, a list of selected genes associated with
the ECM was compiled and schematic illustrated (Figure 4).
Most of the investigated components of the basal lamina
showed differentially expressed mRNA expression levels upon
forskolin treatment of cultured Schwann cells. One of the
strongest reductions could be detected for -dystrobrevin
(Dtna), a member of the DGC (dystrophin­glycoprotein com-
plex). Furthermore, the transcription of syntrophin acidic 1
(Snta1), also a component of this complex, was significantly
reduced upon forskolin treatment, although expression levels
of the other syntrophin isoforms were not changed. The DGC
is linked to the basal lamina by interaction with agrin (Agrn),
whose mRNA expression levels were also reduced in treated
Schwann cells, or with laminin. A reduced expression was
identified for laminin 2 (Lamc2), whereas increased expres-
sion levels were detected for laminin 1, 2 (Lama1, Lama2)
and laminin 1 (Lamc1) upon treatment. Investigation of the
laminin receptor integrin manifested that forskolin treatment
reduced the transcription of integrins such as the integrin
1, 2, 5, 1 and 5 (Itga1, Itga2, Itga5, Itgb1 and Itgb5)
in primary mouse Schwann cells. In contrast, forskolin treat-
ment induced the transcription of integrin 4 and 8 (Itgb4
and Itgb8), in agreement with a study reporting elevated
integrin 4 expression during development and upon
forskolin treatment in rat Schwann cells (Feltri et al., 1994).
Collagen fibers are another major component of the ECM.
Elevation of cAMP levels by forskolin resulted in induced
transcription of collagen type II 1 (Col2a1), in line with a
previous report on rat Schwann cells (D'Antonio et al., 2006),
and collagen type IV 2 (Col4a2). Forskolin treatment led to
reduced transcription of collagen type IV 5 (Col4a5), colla-
gen type V 2 (Col5a2) and of collagen type VI 3 (Col6a3).
Additional analysis of basal lamina components revealed sig-
nificantly increased mRNA expression levels of nidogen1 (en-
tactin, Nid1), nidogen2 (entactin 2, Nid2) and of the proteo-
glycan perlecan (Hspg2).
From these data, we conclude that forskolin treatment
has a strong impact on transcriptional regulation of a va-
riety of ECM-associated genes in cultured mouse Schwann
cells, probably reflecting the morphological changes occur-
ring upon Schwann cell differentiation.
Correlation analysis between in vivo and in vitro
samples
Elevation of intracellular cAMP by forskolin is often used as
an in vitro model for Schwann cell differentiation. There-
fore the expression data from naive and forskolin-treated
Schwann cells and from sciatic nerve tissues taken from P0,
P4, P7, P10 and P60 mice were examined by a PCA to visualize
similarities or differences between the experimental samples
(Figure 5A). Well-defined clusters could be identified for both
untreated and treated Schwann cell cultures (Figure 5A, red
and blue dots, respectively). Additional distinct clusters could
be detected for samples of the different developmental time
points of peripheral nerves (Figure 5A, green dots). The PCA
for the developmental in vivo samples at P0, P4, P7 and P10
showed that the time points closely neighbor each other.
P60 nerve samples formed an individual cluster, reflecting
that their expression is distinct. The PCA also illustrated that
the expression pattern identified in cultured Schwann cells
did not overlap with those of the peripheral nerve tissues,
which is reflected by the dendrogram analysis of hierarchical
clustering (Figure 5B).
The effect on elevated cAMP levels on the Schwann cell
lineage was further investigated by analyzing only transcripts
which were differentially expressed with an FDR-adjusted
P-value <0.05 due to forskolin treatment (Figures 5C and
5D). By PCA, distinct clusters could be visualized for samples
of treated or untreated Schwann cell cultures (Figure 5C).
Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed further that forskolin-
treated Schwann cell samples associate within the same
branch as samples derived from the nerve tissues (Figure 5D,
arrow), indicating some corresponding expression pattern.
Still, the majority of differentially expressed transcripts
elicited by forskolin treatment do not resemble the in vivo
situation.
DISCUSSION
Accurate peripheral myelination depends on a variety of
signals and growth factors. Elevation of intracellular cAMP
levels by either db-(dibutyryl-)cAMP or forskolin is the clas-
sically used stimulation assay to reproduce some of the as-
pects of Schwann cell differentiation in vitro, reflected by
induced expression of myelin-related genes (Monuki et al.,
1989; Morgan et al., 1991; Parkinson et al., 2003; Schworer
et al., 2003; Monje et al., 2009). The effect of forskolin treat-
ment on primary mouse Schwann cells was analyzed by a
comprehensive microarray study. Comparison between our
microarray data and a study on rat Schwann cells treated
with forskolin revealed a number of overlaps such as in-
creased expression of inositol triphosphate receptor subtype
3 (Itpr3), laminin 2 and 1 (Lama2, Lamc1) and reduced ex-
pression of agrin (Agrn), fibroblast growth factor 5 (Fgf5) and
focal adhesion kinase pp125 (Ptk2) (Schworer et al., 2003). In
addition to the myelin-related genes known to be regulated
by forskolin in vitro, we identified many so far disregarded
genes to be expressed by cultured Schwann cells. The gener-
ated database and interactive search tool for genes of inter-
est provides a new insight into the molecular mechanisms of

Schwann cell differentiation (Interactive Excel file; available
at http://www.asnneuro.org/an/006/an006e142add.htm).
First, we focused on genes that were reported to be
expressed at a distinct stage of the Schwann cell lineage
(Supplementary Figure S1). In line with previous studies, we
observed induced transcription of genes expressed in dif-
ferentiated Schwann cells, such as the myelin-related genes
Mpz and Pmp22 (Lemke and Chao, 1988; Morgan et al., 1991;
Schworer et al., 2003; Monje et al., 2009). However, no in-
crease on mRNA expression levels could be detected for Mag.
This observation is in contrast to reports on rat Schwann
cells showing increased protein levels upon db-cAMP addi-
tion (Monje et al., 2009; Monje et al., 2010), respectively,
increased Mag transcription after forskolin treatment (Ogata
et al., 2004). This discrepancy of Mag expression compared
with published literature might be explained by the fact
that Schwann cells derived from mice were investigated in
our study, compared with Schwann cells derived from rats
in the other studies. Indeed, we found no report analyzing
Mag transcription upon forskolin treatment in primary mouse
Schwann cell cultures. We suggest that the effect of forskolin
in respect to Mag transcription might be distinct between rat
and mouse Schwann cells.
Induction of myelin-related gene transcripts was also re-
ported in cultured Schwann cells upon adenoviral infec-
tion with an Egr2-expressing construct (Nagarajan et al.,
2001). In comparison with their study, we also identified
a down-regulation of genes expressed in neural crest cells,
Schwann cell precursors and immature Schwann cells, such
as the transcription factors AP2 (Tcfap2a) and cJun or the
adhesion proteins Cdh2 (NCad) and Cdh19. These observa-
tions suggest that Egr2-dependent differentiation drives the
Schwann cells predominantly into the myelinating pheno-
type, whereas treatment with forskolin additionally leads
to down-regulation of gene transcripts expressed at earlier
stages of the lineage.
Upon forskolin treatment, we identified significantly in-
creased expression for the transcription factor Egr1 (Krox24),
a major transcription factor in nonmyelinating Schwann cells.
The induced transcription might be due to the Egr1 promoter
containing a CRE (cAMP-response element) (reviewed in Thiel
et al., 2010). Furthermore, increased transcriptional activity
of Egr1 by forskolin is in line with detected transactivation of
Egr1 by CREB signaling in gonadotophs (Mayer et al., 2008;
Mayer and Thiel, 2009). Besides Egr1, also the related tran-
scription factor Egr3 was significantly increased by around
7-fold in treated Schwann cells. Enforced expression of both
Egr1 and Egr3 by adenoviral infections led to increased p75NTR
transcription in immortalized rat Schwann cells (Gao et al.,
2007), in contrast to our data of reduced p75NTR expres-
sion despite increased Egr1 and Egr3 mRNA expression levels.
However, the forskolin-induced increase of Egr1 transcrip-
tion was modest compared with enforced expression by ade-
noviral constructs, speculating that a certain expression level
and/or a distinct stoichiometry of Egr1 and Egr3 is required
to modulate p75NTR expression. Analysis of tyrosine kinase
receptors revealed that transcripts coding for ErbB2, TrkB
and TrkC were increased in treated Schwann cells, suggesting
that forskolin treatment not only activates CREB signaling
but also might influence other intracellular signaling path-
ways mediated by tyrosine kinase receptors in Schwann cells
as previously suggested (Stewart et al., 1996; Kim et al., 1997;
Cohen and Frame, 2001; Grimes and Jope, 2001; Ogata et al.,
2004; Monje et al., 2006; Monje et al., 2010).
Olig1 as a new transcription factor in Schwann
cells
Among the 25 gene transcripts, which were strongly de-
creased in forskolin-treated Schwann cells, we identified the
transcription factor Olig1. In the CNS, Olig1 is essential for
the differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into
mature oligodendrocytes (Xin et al., 2005; Li et al., 2007). In
the oligodendrocytes lineage, Olig1 activates Mbp transcrip-
tion by interaction with the transcription factor Sox10 (Li
et al., 2007), which is also expressed throughout the entire
Schwann cell lineage. However, the role of Olig1 in the PNS
is not known yet. Although investigations of Olig1-deficient
mice did not reveal major abnormalities of the PNS (Charles
D. Stiles, personal communication), a functional role of Olig1
during peripheral nerve development or in regeneration can-
not be excluded. In cultured mouse Schwann cells, a signifi-
cantly higher Olig1 expression was detected in the cytoplasm
compared with the nucleus. In the CNS, Olig1 was also local-
ized in the cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes, whereas nuclear
localization was only detected for a short time period during
early development (Arnett et al., 2004; Othman et al., 2011).
The cytoplasmic function of Olig1 is not yet entirely under-
stood, but it was demonstrated to be crucial for elaboration
of cell processes and membrane expansions in oligodendro-
cytes precursor cells (Niu et al., 2012). Since glial development
in the PNS precedes the one in the CNS, Olig1 expression in
the nucleus might be present at very early embryonic stages.
Besides early development, nuclear Olig1 expression in oligo-
dendrocytes was also reported upon remyelination (Arnett et
al., 2004). In Olig1-deficient mice, remyelination failed due
to impaired differentiation of progenitors, underlining its es-
sential role in oligodendrocyte differentiation (Arnett et al.,
2004). In line, we propose Olig1 playing an important role
also in Schwann cell differentiation, indicated by its strong
differential transcription upon differentiation with forskolin.
In the PNS, Olig1 was recently reported to be up-regulated
in injured nerves (Arthur-Farraj et al., 2012), suggesting its
expression in Schwann cells during denervation and regen-
eration. Our immunofluorescence analysis on sciatic nerves
revealed that Olig1 was localized in regions correlating to
nonmyelinating Schwann cells, which is well in line with the
decreased mRNA expression level upon forskolin treatment.
In addition, Olig1 could be detected in a subset of myeli-
nating Schwann cells, but the immunofluorescent signal was
very weak. Furthermore, Olig1 mRNA levels slightly increased

Effect of forskolin on mouse Schwann cells
during development, reflecting maturation of both myeli-
nating and nonmyelinating Schwann cells. From our data, we
introduce Olig1 as a new transcription factor of the Schwann
cell lineage, whose expression is negatively regulated by ele-
vation of intracellular cAMP levels by forskolin.
Regulation of ECM components is
forskolin-dependent
Data analysis revealed that a set of differentially expressed
transcripts due to forskolin treatment are associated with
components of the ECM. Highly significantly increased mRNA
expression levels could be identified for the secreted ECM
protein spondin 2 and for decorin, a chondroitin sulphate
proteoglycan known to be expressed in Schwann cells (Hane-
mann et al., 1993). These data are in agreement with previ-
ous reports showing an up-regulation of decorin during em-
bryonic Schwann cell development (Buchstaller et al., 2004;
D'Antonio et al., 2006). Also the proteoglycan thrombomod-
ulin was increased in treated Schwann cells, in line with
induced expression of thrombomodulin in endothelial and
leukemia cell lines after elevation of intracellular cAMP lev-
els (Ito et al., 1990; Maruyama et al., 1991; Archipoff et al.,
1993). To investigate whether differentially expressed gene
transcripts might have a common function, they were an-
alyzed in respect to their GO-annotations. Indeed, also this
analysis identified the term of `extracellular matrix' for both
sets, either transcripts increased or decreased after forskolin
treatment. In addition, pathway analysis revealed that the
interaction of ECM with its receptors was enriched in differ-
entially expressed genes.
During Schwann cell differentiation and radial sorting
in vivo, considerable modifications of the plasma membrane
occur. The sole axon­glia interaction transforms into a glia­
glia interaction on one side, and an axon­glia interaction on
the other side of the same membrane elongation. Hence, ex-
pressional changes of adhesion molecules and components
of the ECM are vital for proper function and polarization
in vivo. From our data, we conclude that one of the major
effects of forskolin is the regulation of the ECM, indicating
that changes of the ECM also occur in Schwann cell differ-
entiation in vitro.
Highly significantly differential gene expression
induced by elevated cAMP
Schwann cell development and differentiation are also in-
fluenced by accurate levels of growth factors. Indeed, Fgf7,
also known as keratinocyte growth factor, was identified
as one of the strongest forskolin-dependent increased tran-
scripts in primary mouse Schwann cells. This finding is
in accordance with studies showing that stimulation with
forskolin led to increased Fgf7 expression in other cells,
such as dermal papilla cells and primary fibroblasts (Iino
et al., 2007; Scott et al., 2012). The strongest induced
gene transcript was Sostdc1 (ectodin, wise), an inhibitor of
BMP (bone morphogenetic protein) and modulator of the
Wnt signaling pathways (Itasaki et al., 2003; Laurikkala et al.,
2003). In the CNS, BMP and Wnt signaling pathways inhibit
differentiation of oligodendrocyte precursor cells into ma-
ture oligodendrocytes (Feigenson et al., 2011), leading to the
hypothesis that also in the PNS, forskolin-dependent induc-
tion of Sostcd1 expression consequently positively regulates
glia cell differentiation. Another significantly induced gene
was the endothelin receptor type B. This receptor is cou-
pled to the adenylyl cyclase and was already shown previ-
ously to be expressed in immortalized Schwann cells (Wilkins
et al., 1997). This increased transcription does not correspond
to the forskolin-dependent regulation of its ligand endothe-
lin, which was reduced in treated Schwann cells. However,
reduced transcription of endothelin is in line with its pro-
posed function as a negative regulator of the transition
from Schwann cell precursors to immature Schwann cells
(Brennan et al., 2000). The strongest forskolin-dependent re-
duction was detected for the transcription of the protocad-
herin 20 (Pcdh20). This cell adhesion molecule belongs to
non-clustered protocadherins, and its expression was ana-
lyzed particularly in the CNS (Pribyl et al., 1996). To our
knowledge, Pcdh20 expression has not yet been investigated
in the PNS. In primary mouse Schwann cells, we detected
high expression levels of both transcripts in naive Schwann
cells. Upon forskolin treatment, transcription of Pcdh20 was
highly significantly reduced, maybe reflecting morphologi-
cal changes of the cells in conjunction with differentially
expressed adhesion molecules. Forskolin treatment resulted
also in strongly reduced transcription of the calcium ­ and
calmodulin-dependent phosphodiesterase 1B (Pde1b). As for
Pcdh20, gene transcripts of Pde1b were strongly expressed
in untreated Schwann cell cultures. This enzyme hydrolyzes
the second messengers cAMP and cGMP, consequently reg-
ulating their cellular levels (reviewed in Bender and Beavo,
2006; Omori and Kotera, 2007). Hence, elevated intracellular
levels of cAMP by forskolin treatment might directly sup-
press the expression of Pde1b. The third transcript which was
strongly reduced in forskolin-treated Schwann cells was the
leucine-rich repeat and transmembrane domain-containing
protein 1 (Lrtm1). In naive Schwann cells, a strong expression
of both transcripts could be detected. The functional role of
the Lrtm1 protein is not known, but leucine-rich repeat pro-
teins in general were shown to be involved in cell adhesion
and polarization, cytoskeleton dynamics and neural develop-
ment (reviewed in Kobe and Kajava, 2001), proposing Lrtm1
as a new candidate gene in cell adhesion in Schwann cells.
Also for PDGF, reduced expression was detected in differ-
entiated Schwann cells, in accordance with reports showing
the functional role of PDGF in cell migration and prolif-
eration (De Donatis et al., 2008; Monje et al., 2009; Jiang
et al., 2013). Our result of decreased PDGF in differenti-
ated Schwann cells is also in agreement with the finding
that exogenous PDGF led to suppression of the expression
of myelin-related proteins in rat Schwann cells (Ogata et al.,
2004).

D. Schmid and others
Transcripts with reduced expression upon
forskolin treatment were associated with the
MAPK pathway
Elevation of intracellular cAMP levels went also along with
reduced transcription of the transmembrane protein 158
(Tmem158, Ris1). Previously, Tmem158 was shown to be
up-regulated in response to activation of the Ras path-
way (Barradas et al., 2002; Iglesias et al., 2006; Birch et
al., 2008), hence the reduced Tmem158 expression might
be a consequence of decreased pathway activity. Since the
Ras/Raf/Mek/Erk signaling pathway blocks Schwann cell dif-
ferentiation (Harrisingh et al., 2004; Ogata et al., 2004), a
decreased activity of this pathway is plausible upon differen-
tiation with forskolin. The hypothesis of reduced activity of
the MAPK cascade was validated by an analysis of putative
pathways, revealing that gene transcripts reduced in treated
Schwann cells were often associated with the MAPK path-
way. In addition, the MAPK-kinases Mek1/2 could be iden-
tified as possible inhibitory target regulators upon forskolin
treatment. In line, Rac1 that was proposed as a putative nega-
tive target regulator of differentially expressed transcripts in
treated Schwann cells, was recently identified as a negative
regulator of Schwann cell differentiation by up-regulating
cJun and down-regulating Krox20 through the JNK (c-Jun
N-terminal kinase) pathway (Shin et al., 2013). Upstream
analysis further revealed that three members of the NF-B
pathway are putative target regulators. This is in accordance
with the observation, that the activation of NF-B is vital for
peripheral myelination (Nickols et al., 2003). NF-B was also
shown to be phosphorylated and activated by the PKA (Yoon
et al., 2008).
Distinct gene expression between Schwann cells
in vitro and developing peripheral nerves
PCA demonstrated well-defined clusters of developing pe-
ripheral nerves in vivo, represented by the time points P0, P4,
P7 and P10. Samples of mature sciatic nerves at P60 consti-
tuted a separate cluster, indicating distinct gene expression
compared with earlier time points. Distinct clusters could
also be visualized for treated as well as untreated Schwann
cells. Comparison of gene expression between samples de-
rived from primary mouse Schwann cells and samples of de-
veloping sciatic nerves revealed significant differences. The
differences in gene expression between in vivo and in vitro
might be explained by the fact that there is a constant inter-
action and reciprocal signaling between axons and Schwann
cells in vivo, which is absent in primary mouse Schwann
cell cultures. Furthermore, the in vivo system is more com-
plex, since other cells such as endothelial cells and fibro-
blasts are present in the nerve as well. Cultured Schwann
cells are more synchronized, in contrast to Schwann cells in
peripheral nerves, where an overlap of distinct Schwann cell
stages can be observed during early development. These data
indicate that caution has to be exercised when comparing
primary Schwann cell cultures with in vivo analysis, despite
the finding that forskolin-treated Schwann cells associate
within the same branch of the dendrogram as the nerve
samples.
Conclusion
This work aims to improve the knowledge of intracellular
signaling in mouse Schwann cells. Forskolin treatment of
primary Schwann cells confirmed the increased transcription
of genes involved in Schwann cell differentiation and the
reduced transcription of genes known in neural crest cells
and Schwann cell precursors. Comprehensive data analysis
of a whole-genome microarray further identified a number
of differentially regulated transcripts which have not yet
been reported in Schwann cells. We identified the expression
of both Olig1 protein and mRNA in myelinating and non-
myelinating Schwann cells, proposing it as a novel transcrip-
tion factor in the Schwann cell lineage. From our study, we
further conclude that a major effect of forskolin treatment
is the regulation of components of the ECM, underlining its
importance during Schwann cell differentiation. In addition,
transcripts that were reduced upon treatment were often as-
sociated with the MAPK and Rac1 signaling pathways, vali-
dating previous studies. We provide the whole data set of the
microarray study to offer an interactive search tool for genes
of interest.

Figure S1 Schematic illustration of genes implicated in the Schwann cell lineage
Selected genes of Table 1, which are specific for a distinct Schwann cell stage, were schematically grouped. Genes implicated in neural
crest cells, Schwann cell precursors or immature Schwann cells showed reduced mRNA expression levels upon forskolin treatment (blue
arrows), whereas increased expression could be detected for myelin-related genes (red arrows). Dashed arrows indicate only slightly
differentially expressed transcripts. Red line: basal lamina. NCC: neural crest cell, SCP: Schwann cell precursor, iSC: immature Schwann
cell, mSC: myelinating Schwann cell, nmSC: nonmyelinating Schwann cell. Schematic drawing was adapted from Jessen et al. (2005).
