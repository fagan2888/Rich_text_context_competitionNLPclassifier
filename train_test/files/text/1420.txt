Kidney Stone Cases in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey

ABSTRACT
Concern that people who form kidney stones may have reduced bone mineral density (BMD) and increased
fracture risk has motivated clinical and population-based studies, but findings are inconsistent. In this
cross-sectional study, we use the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) to
determine whether a history of kidney stones (n  793) is associated with lower femoral neck BMD and
whether the association is similar for men and women. We further ask whether dietary calcium modifies the
association between kidney stone history and BMD and whether there is an association between kidney stone
history and prevalent spine or wrist fracture. We find that men with kidney stone history have lower femoral
neck BMD than men without kidney stone history after adjusting for age, body mass index (BMI), race/
ethnicity, and other potential confounders. The effect of kidney stone history on BMD is weaker for women.
Men with kidney stone history also are more likely to report prevalent wrist and spine fractures. Dietary
calcium, represented by usual milk consumption, is associated positively with BMD for both men and women
and modifies the effect of kidney stone history on BMD for men. For men who form kidney stones, milk
consumption is associated more strongly with femoral neck BMD than for men without such a history. The
effect modification is such that the difference in BMD between men with and without kidney stone history is
observed only at lower levels of milk consumption. (J Bone Miner Res 2001;16:1893­1898)

INTRODUCTION
CONCERN THAT people who form kidney stones, particu-
larly those with hypercalciuria, may have reduced bone
density has motivated a number of clinical studies.(1­7)
Using bone assessment technologies available over the past
25 years, generally, they have found evidence of reduced
bone content among kidney stone patients or among kidney
stone patients with hypercalciuria. Results, though, are not
completely consistent with respect, for example, to which
skeletal sites are affected, whether the effect is seen in
women, or whether only patients with hypercalciuria (and
which type) are affected. Inconsistent findings may be
caused by random variability associated with generally
small sample sizes or the potential difficulty of assembling
a comparison series that is representative of the target
population. In one study, Jaeger et al. compared bone min-
eral density (BMD) of 110 men who form calcium stones
with and without hypercalciuria to that of healthy controls at
several skeletal sites (lumbar spine, femur, distal tibial
diaphysis, and distal tibial epiphysis).(6) Although they
found a tendency for lower BMD for people who form

stones at all sites regardless of hypercalciuria status, BMD
was significantly lower only at the two tibial sites. However,
none of their 235 male controls had ever experienced a
fracture, which raises concern that the controls may have
had unusually high BMD. In contrast, Heilberg et al. did
find significantly lower lumbar spine BMD in 13 male
kidney stone patients with fasting hypercalciuria (but not in
13 with absorptive hypercalciuria) compared with matched
controls.(7) There was no evidence of an effect in 29 female
patients.
A different potential source of heterogeneity among stud-
ies could be an unmeasured confounder or effect modifier,
one more common in some populations than others. Cal-
cium consumption could be such a factor. There is evidence
that dietary calcium is associated with BMD in patients with
kidney stones. Fuss and others found that 60 male patients
with kidney stones who maintained a low-calcium diet had
lower bone mineral content at the distal radius than 63 male
patients with an unrestricted diet.(8) Trinchieri and others
collected 3-day dietary diaries from 48 male patients with a
history of calcium kidney stones.(9) Almost one-half of
patients were classified as having low BMD at the femur or
spine, and these were more likely to report a low-calcium
diet. Thus, if calcium consumption of patients with kidney
stones varies between studies, one might find that BMD is
lower in those case series in which the patients maintained
relatively low-calcium diets but not significantly decreased
in other case series.
Low BMD is a concern primarily because it is such a
strong risk factor for osteoporotic fracture.(10­12) Because
both kidney stones and fractures are relatively rare out-
comes in a general population, large studies are necessary to
investigate whether there is an association between them.
Melton et al., using the Rochester Epidemiology Project,
determined rates of fracture among 624 persons diagnosed
with kidney stones from 1950 to 1974 in Olmstead County,
MN.(13) The risk of vertebral fracture was greatly increased
among men who form kidney stones, with a standardized
morbidity ratio (SMR) of 7.0 and an elevated, although
lower, SMR of 2.4 among women. There was no evidence
of increased fracture risk at the proximal humerus, distal
forearm, pelvis, or proximal femur. In a second population-
based study, Sowers et al. investigated whether there was an
association between either BMD or fracture and kidney
stones in a cohort of 1309 women, 44 of whom had a history
of kidney stones.(14) They did not find lower BMD or
increased fracture among those who form kidney stones.
In this cross-sectional study, we use a national sample,
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III), to determine whether a history of kid-
ney stones is associated with lower BMD at the femoral
neck and whether the association is similar for men and
women. One advantage of using NHANES III is that the
comparison group is representative of the U.S. adult popu-
lation and is accepted as the standard for BMD evaluation.
Because we include the entire sample in the study, we are
able to adjust for potential confounders such as body mass
index (BMI) among both those with and those without a
kidney stone history. We further ask whether dietary cal-
cium modifies the association between kidney stone history
and BMD. Finally, we examine whether there is an associ-
ation between kidney stone history and prevalent spine or
wrist fracture.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
The NHANES III was conducted from 1988 through
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics, of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The NHANESs
are national probability surveys designed to obtain nation-
ally representative estimates of the health and nutritional
status of the population. The study design for NHANES III,
a multistage probability sample, has been described previ-
ously.(15) A total of 39,695 persons were screened for in-
clusion. Of these, 14% did not participate in the household
interview and then an additional 8% did not participate in
the examination at the mobile examination units. Persons
with examination data also have household interview data.
Bone density measurements
A distinctive feature of the NHANES III was the inclu-
sion of bone densitometry in the examination, specifically
measurement of the proximal femur using dual-energy
X-ray absorptiometry. The procedures used have been de-
scribed.(16,17) Briefly, men and nonpregnant women aged 20
years and older were eligible for BMD measurement if they
had not previously broken both hips or had hip pins or
artificial hips. Measurements were taken of the left hip
unless it had been fractured or had surgery, in which case
the right hip was measured. The sample included 7114 men
and 7532 women. BMD is reported for five regions of the
femur. In this study, we focus on one site, the femoral neck.
Three Hologic QDR 1000 densitometers in mobile exami-
nation units were used. Rigorous quality control ensured
consistent data.(18)
Other data
Height and weight were measured using a standardized
procedure.(19) We use height and weight to calculate BMI,
using the formula of kilograms per square meter.
Race (black, white, or other) and ethnicity (Mexican
American, other Hispanic, or not Hispanic) are combined
into a single-response format, which includes categories for
non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican Ameri-
can, and other. The study oversampled blacks and Mexican
Americans. Persons who are neither white, black, nor Mex-
ican American are identified as "other," a heterogenous
group of non-Mexican Hispanics, Asian Americans, and
Native Americans for whom population estimates have no
clear interpretation.
History of kidney stones was ascertained from the ques-
tion, "Have you ever had kidney stones?" Fracture history
was ascertained from the question, "Has a doctor ever told
you that you had broken or fractured your [hip, wrist,
spine]?" Current medication use was recorded based on
household inspection of containers for prescription medica-

tions taken during the previous month. Each medication was
described by up to three drug class codes. Medications that
could potentially confound the association between kidney
stone history and BMD were identified from the broad drug
codes: diuretics, adrenal corticosteroids, androgens/anabolic
steroids, estrogens/progestins, and thyroid/antithyroid.
Dietary data were collected in both the household inter-
view and in the examination. In the household interview,
there was a series of questions about lifetime milk consump-
tion, which asked respondents to remember how often they
drank any kind of milk, including milk on cereal (but not
milk added to tea or coffee), during as many as five periods
of their life, depending on current age: child (5­12 years),
teenager (13­17 years), young adult (18­35 years), middle-
aged adult (36­65 years), and older adult (65 years). We
used milk consumption during the current age category to
indicate level of habitual milk consumption, assuming this
would be correlated with calcium consumption over an
extended time horizon. We categorized responses into
never, less than once per day, once per day, and more than
once per day, which created approximately equal quartiles.
A second measure of calcium consumption was available
from the examination at which interviewers collected 24-h
dietary recall. Twenty-four-hour calcium consumption was
estimated from this. Because it would be difficult to inter-
pret models that included two correlated indicators of di-
etary calcium, we examined which one was associated more
strongly with BMD, as indicated by statistical significance,
and used that one in further modeling.
Age and census region of the country (northeast, south,
midwest, and west) were also used in the analysis.
Analysis
The analysis addressed four questions: (1) Do those who
form kidney stones have lower BMD? (2) Does the associ-
ation vary by sex? (3) Does calcium consumption modify
the association between kidney stone history and BMD? (4)
Are those who form kidney stones more likely to have
experienced fractures of the spine or wrist?
Because of the complex study design, all regression anal-
yses and estimates of population prevalence take into ac-
count sample weights (which account for oversampling and
nonresponse) and design effects.
Because BMD is strongly associated with age and the
nature of the association varies by sex, we determined
age-adjusted residuals for femoral neck BMD. Using sepa-
rate models for men and women, we flexibly modeled the
association with age by predicting BMD as a function of a
series of six age variables: age since 20, age since 30, . . .
age since 70. This approach allows there to be a different
slope for the age effect during each decade of adult life and
for the slopes to be different for men and women. For each
observation, we determined the residual, that is, the differ-
ence between BMD expected based on age and sex and
BMD observed. There was no race/ethnicity adjustment in
these prediction models; thus, for example, blacks have on
average higher age-adjusted BMD residuals. For the entire
male or female population, residuals will have a mean of
zero. These age-adjusted BMD residuals are the outcomes
for all analyses of BMD determinants. Consequently, re-
gression models for BMD do not further adjust for age.
First, we estimated population prevalence for history of
kidney stone. Then, we examined whether a history of
kidney stones was associated with lower BMD using mul-
tivariate regression, adjusting for BMI and race/ethnicity,
and modeling data for males and females separately. We
entered the following additional variables into the model:
milk consumption, current medication use (diuretic, steroid,
androgens, estrogens, and thyroid), and region of the coun-
try. Then we added an interaction term for calcium con-
sumption and history of kidney stones.
To examine whether those who form kidney stones were
more likely to have experienced osteoporotic fracture, we
used logistic regression models predicting history of spine
fracture and wrist fracture. We entered kidney stone history,
age, and race/ethnicity into the models separately for males
and females. We did not model hip fracture because unlike
spine and wrist fracture, osteoporotic hip fracture strongly
predicts both mortality and institutionalization. Because the
fracture information is all collected retrospectively and from
the noninstitutionalized population, selection bias would be
likely to influence the findings for hip fracture. Specifically,
rather than modeling an association for persons who had
experienced hip fracture, we would have modeled an asso-
ciation for persons who survived hip fracture and avoided
disability.
STATA 6 (Stata Corp., College Station, TX, USA) was
used for analyses.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the NHANES III adult sample with
bone densitometry data are presented in Table 1. A history
of kidney stones was reported by 477 men and 316 women,
and the lifetime prevalence estimate of kidney stones is
0.068 (95% CI, 0.057­0.080) for men and 0.044 (95% CI,
0.038­0.049) for women. Table 1 also presents the preva-
lence of wrist and spine fracture and current medication use.
Table 2 presents the coefficients and significance tests
from regression models for men and women in which age-
adjusted BMD is the outcome. Of the two indicators of
dietary calcium that we considered, habitual milk consump-
tion and 24-h calcium estimate, the former is associated
more strongly with BMD (data not shown) and is included
in these models. Adjusting for the other variables in the
models, a history of kidney stones is significantly associated
with lower BMD for men but not women. The effects of
BMI and habitual milk consumption are similar for men and
women. For both men and women, blacks and Mexican
Americans have higher age-adjusted BMD than whites after
adjusting for the other factors, notably BMI. Although the
directions of effects are as expected for the current medi-
cation use (e.g., diuretic use is associated with higher BMD
and corticosteroid use with lower BMD) only estrogen use
for women has a statistically significant effect, increased
BMD. There is evidence of geographic variation in BMD
for women but not men. Adjusting for BMI, race/ethnicity,
and the other factors in the model, women in the south and
1895

northeast have lower age-adjusted BMD than women in the
Midwest (the referent region in the model).
Table 3 presents coefficients from models that test
whether there is a statistically significant interaction be-
tween kidney stone history and level of habitual milk con-
sumption in predicting BMD after adjusting for race/
ethnicity and BMI. The interaction term for kidney stone
history and milk consumption is positive for both men and
women but only statistically significant for men. The direc-
tion of the interaction term is such that increased milk
consumption has a greater positive effect on BMD for
persons with a history of kidney stones than for persons
without such a history. Figure 1 graphically presents how
the interaction term affects the association between level of
milk consumption and age-adjusted BMD for men for each
level of milk consumption. The effect estimates in the figure

and no milk consumption. At low levels of milk consump-
tion, men with a history of kidney stones have a much lower
age-adjusted BMD, while BMD is similar for those who
form kidney stones and others at the highest level of milk
consumption.
Table 4 presents the odds ratios (ORs) for persons with a
kidney stone history, relative to those without, in reporting
wrist or spine fracture. For men, those who form kidney
stones are significantly more likely to report both fracture
types. The point estimates of the ORs for women who form
kidney stones are lower than those for men, and they are not
statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
With a representative sample of the U.S. adult population,
we have found that men with a kidney stone history have
lower femoral neck BMD than men who do not report such
a history after adjusting for age, BMI, race/ethnicity, and
other potential confounders. The effect of kidney stone
history on BMD is weaker for women. Men with a history
of kidney stones also are more likely than others to report
prevalent wrist and spine fracture. Although dietary cal-
cium, represented by usual milk consumption, is positively
associated with BMD for both men and women, it modifies
the effect of kidney stone history on BMD for men. For men
who form kidney stones, milk consumption is associated
more strongly with femoral neck BMD than for men with-
out a kidney stone history. The magnitude of the effect
modification is such that the difference in BMD between
men with and without a kidney stone history is observed
only at the lower levels of milk consumption.
The weaker association for women could be related either
to sex differences in kidney stones or to sex differences in
BMD. A lower proportion of kidney stones among women
are calcium stones and a higher proportion of infection-
related struvite stones.(20) Because the effect on BMD is
assumed to be confined to calcium stones, the effect on
BMD observed for all kidney stones, undifferentiated by
type, consequently, would be weaker for women. Determi-
nants of BMD also differ for men and women. In these
models, more factors are predictive of age-adjusted BMD
for women than men, specifically, current estrogen use and
geographic region. Geographic region likely stands in for
several environmental factors that are correlated weakly
with geography, perhaps factors such as adolescent weight
or lifetime physical activity. We included geographic region
as a potential confounder because geographic variation has
been observed for both kidney stones and hip fractures.
Kidney stones are most prevalent in the southeastern and
south central states and least prevalent in the northwest.(21)
The geographic pattern of hip fractures is somewhat similar,
with high rates in the south central states for both men and
women and in the southeastern states for women.(22,23)
There are important limitations to the use of NHANES III
data for this study. First, lumbar spine BMD is not available.
Kidney stone history is based on self-report and does not
include year of onset, type of kidney stone, or presence of
hypercalciuria. Because age is not available for the first
kidney stone, some wrist and spine fractures may predate
kidney stone occurrence. However, to the extent that kidney
stones reflect an underlying metabolic condition and hyper-
calciuria may begin in childhood,(24) observed temporality
may not be as crucial as for most clinical outcomes. Because
potential confounders such as medication use are assessed at
the time of the interview, after both kidney stones and

for potential confounders beyond current age and race/
ethnicity. Wrist and spine fracture are also self-reported,
and spine fractures, which may be asymptomatic in as many
as one-half of patients,(25) therefore are likely to be under-
reported. Only current medication use is available, and
identification is limited by the coding categories. For exam-
ple, thiazide diuretics cannot be distinguished from other
kinds of diuretics.
Despite these limitations, NHANES III offers the advan-
tage that it is a nationally representative sample of over
14,000 men and women, with racial, ethnic, and geographic
distribution similar to the country as a whole (after the
sample design is taken into account), and with kidney stone
prevalence that also is nationally representative. We are able
to use femoral neck BMD data, which are accepted as the
reference standard, and at the same time adjust for key
confounders such as BMI, which previously has been pos-
sible only with much smaller clinic-based series of cases
and controls. These data confirm an association for men
between kidney stone history and both lower BMD and
higher fracture prevalence. Consistent with previous stud-
ies, we have found that these associations are weaker for
women. These data underscore the importance of dietary
calcium in preventing osteoporosis among male patients
with kidney stones.
