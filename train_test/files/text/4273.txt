Introduction
With an estimated prevalence of up to 1.5% (Alter, 2007;
Hellard, Horyniak, &Aitken, 2009), hepatitis C virus (HCV)
infection is one of the most commonly notified communi-
cable diseases in Australia. While the risk is greatest in peo-
ple with a history of injection drug use (National Centre for
HIV Epidemiological and Clinical Research, 2010), history
of imprisonment has long been independently associated
with HCV (Crofts et al., 1996; Dolan, 2000a; Stark et al.,
1997). HCV transmission has proven to be difficult to study
in prison populations, primarily due to rapid population
turnover, but rates are thought to be high relative to the gen-
eral community (Miller, Bi, & Ryan, 2009) and direct evi-
dence of transmission within Australian prisons has been
reported (Haber et al., 1999; Post et al., 2001).
In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) published
guidelines on the management of HIV in prisons (WHO
Global Programme on AIDS, 1993). A major principle of the
document was to provide prisoners with the same standard of
health care (including access to preventive resources such as
condoms, bleach, and sterile injecting equipment) available
to the communities from which the prisoners were sourced.
While focused on HIV, the guidelines are applicable to HCV
as has been reflected in subsequent WHO documents (WHO,
2007; WHO and Joint United Nation Programme on AIDS,
2006). Evaluations of the extent to which the international
guidelines have been adopted over the ensuing two decades,
however, have yielded disappointing results--particularly
with respect to the provision of syringes and bleach (Bollini,
Laporte, & Harding, 2002). This is despite strong evidence
from around the world for the effectiveness of needle and
syringe programs in the community (Commonwealth
Department of Health and Ageing, 2002) and their successful
implementation in a growing number of prisons in
Switzerland, Germany, Romania, Belgium, Scotland, and
elsewhere (Chu & Elliott, 2009). Although many of the rea-
sons for this are related to legislative and administrative
restrictions, a number of authors have also described a lack of
acceptance among prison officers and other correctional staff
to the introduction of particular harm reduction strategies
(Cregan, 1998; Dolan, Wodak, & Hall, 1998; Godin et al.,
2001; Leh, 1999; Levy, 1999; Niveau, 2006). In Australia,
proposals for new harm reduction strategies within prisons,
including access to clean injecting equipment, have also been
met with various levels of resistance from prison staff (Dolan,
2001). Efforts to understand the attitudes and beliefs of prison
staff could promote a more collaborative approach to intro-
ducing effective strategies in the future (Gollop et al., 2004;
Grol & Wensing, 2004; Mogg & Levy, 2009).
During 2005 and 2006, a study of HCV infection in pris-
oners was conducted in the South Australian (SA) system.

Harm Reduction Behind Bars: Prison
Worker Perspectives

Abstract
We aimed to identify how strategies to reduce the risk of hepatitis C virus (HCV) in prisons could be implemented in a way
that is acceptable to those with the responsibility for implementing them. Prison officer and nurse perceptions of HCV and
attitudes toward a range of harm reduction interventions, including clean needle and bleach provision, were explored. In the
context of highly prevalent feelings of resentment, most of the proposed strategies were perceived by all staff as a threat
for officers and a privilege for prisoners. Addressing the underlying concerns of prison staff is essential in achieving a fully
collaborative harm reduction effort. Ongoing resistance to proposed harm reduction strategies underscores the relevance
of these findings for prison settings in Australia and elsewhere.

This study (Miller et al. 2009) estimated an overall HCV
seroprevalence in prison entrants of around 42%--similar to
the 37% to 58% reported by studies in other Australian pris-
ons (Butler, Boonwaat, & Hailstone, 2005; Butler et al.,
1999; Crofts et al., 1995; Hellard, Hocking, & Crofts, 2004).
The study confirmed that those already infected with HCV at
prison entry were significantly more likely to continue inject-
ing while incarcerated. It was concluded that the few needles
in circulation in the prison were almost certainly contami-
nated with HCV and represent an unacceptable risk for sus-
ceptible prisoners and prison staff. With the exception of an
established opioid replacement program (Cowie & Alberti,
2001), no practical preventive resources aimed at reducing
the harms associated with injecting have been provided to
SA prisoners to date.
During this study, prison officers and health staff working
in the SA prison system took part in small group interviews
and a focus group. The rationale for the interviews was to
assist in the development of recommendations for harm
reduction strategies that would be acceptable to those respon-
sible for implementing them. In this article, we explore their
perceptions and views about hepatitis C and a range of harm
reduction strategies to identify future directions for minimiz-
ing transmission risks within prison. In addition to ethical
approvals obtained for the original project (Miller et al.,
2009), this secondary analysis was specifically approved by
the SA Department of Health Human Research Ethics
Committee and the Deakin University Human Research
Ethics Committee.
Method
In late 2005, three small group interviews with correctional
officers and one focus group with prison health staff were
held at two metropolitan prisons in Adelaide. The included
participants were 18 years of age or older, employed in the
prison system at the time of the interview, and actively work-
ing as in the SA prison system during the period of the larger
study in which this research arm was embedded.
In each semistructured interview, participants were
invited to talk about the importance of HCV as a workplace
issue for them and the adequacy of any infection control
measures then in place. They were then provided with a brief
text paragraph summarizing statistics on the prevalence of
HCV in SA prisons, and asked whether that information
changed their assessment of HCV as a priority issue.
Following this, participants were invited to raise any issues
of interest in relation to communicable disease in general,
before being canvassed for their views on a range of specific
prevention strategies, including increasing education, bleach
provision, clean needle provision--which have been among
the most commonly proposed strategies for prison systems
(Dolan, 2000b).
Prison officer participants responded to posters and flyers
that were placed around the institutions by making contact
directly with the researcher on-site. Nursing staff partici-
pants responded to invitations provided directly to them via
nursing education workshops and through reminders at
handover meetings. Responders were provided with an infor-
mation sheet and signed a consent form several days prior to
the interviews but no participants withdrew. All interviews
were held in private rooms on-site during work time, were
audiotape recorded, and then transcribed verbatim at which
time the tapes were destroyed. Initially, some of the data
were descriptively analyzed and reported to the primary
stakeholders (including the SA Prison Health Service, SA
Department of Health, and SA Department for Correctional
Services) along with the larger study findings, but they were
not comprehensively analyzed or published at that time.
Further analysis involved a recursive cycle of inductive
and deductive reasoning that included descriptive coding, to
highlight emergent themes; determining a point of reference
for examining each theme to interpret key categories; a map-
ping exercise to illustrate and question the information
emerging and to assess what we already know about the
topic; and interpreting and presenting findings (Daly, 2007).
The analysis was undertaken by a researcher who was not
involved in the data collection and without previous experi-
ence in the context or the content area of the study. Although
previously held attitudes to prisoners, prison staff, and com-
municable diseases would remain, it is likely that their
impact on the analytic process may not have been as great as
the potentially more strongly established attitudes held by
persons with expert knowledge of the field.
Participants
Eight prison officers (two females and six males) and seven
prison health service nurses (four females and three males)
were interviewed in their work time within the grounds of
two high security metropolitan male-only prisons in
Adelaide, SouthAustralia. One prison accommodated unsen-
tenced prisoners and the other a mixture of sentenced and
unsentenced prisoners. The eight prison officers took part in
one of three small group interviews (one group of two par-
ticipants, and two groups of three participants) and had lev-
els of experience ranging from what might be described as
`early career' to `veteran.' The seven nurses participated in a
single focus group session that was held in a prison infir-
mary. Their level of experience in prison health also ranged
from relative newcomer to extensive.
Results
The interviews covered three main discussion points and
uncovered a number of associated issues: working in an
environment with a high prevalence of HCV (including
attitudes toward HCV, awareness of prisoner HCV status,
and knowledge about HCV), existing strategies to mini-
mize HCV transmission (including formal protocols and
Miller et al. 3
individual protection), and specific staff responses to the
proposed strategies.
The findings are presented according to the discussion
points and themes emerging from the analytical process,
with verbatim quotes provided to exemplify key points.
Interpretive discussion is presented along with each theme
and final implications are discussed separately.
Working in a High HCV Prevalence Environment
Risk of transmission was the most dominant consideration in
prison officer discussions of working in an environment with
high background prevalence of HCV infection. Transmission
risk was also a major theme in nurse discussions and, for
both groups, all discussion was located within the discourse
of personal risk rather than that of susceptible prisoners or
other prison staff.
Attitudes to HCV:The ever present threat. HCV was considered
an important issue by prison officers and nursing staff. While
both groups indicated some understanding of the infection
risk, harm reduction activities initiated by officers were pri-
marily focused on the potential threat of prisoner-to-staff
transmission. No officers commented on the risk for prisoners,
with one officer explaining that prisoner safety was assumed
to be the responsibility of health staff. Reinforced during their
initial training, officers considered all inmates to be infected
and employed self-protective strategies to reduce disease
transmission. While not part of formal protocol, for example,
officers reported routinely wearing three or four pairs of
gloves and protective goggles for cell inspections, when `pat-
ting down' prisoners (undertaking personal security searches)
or when attending crisis situations involving blood expo-
sure--such as self-harm incidents and altercations.
Yes, [you] assume that everybody, absolutely everybody has hep
C, andAIDS and everything else . . . you just assume everybody's
got it.
It's more about precautions for ourselves than it is about concern
for prisoners, because I think, there is an assumption that the
prisoner health services educates them . . . about that . . . my
focus isn't really on them it's more on universal precautions for
ourselves.
Awareness of inmate HCV status: Knowing the enemy.The
requirement to maintain confidentiality necessarily restricts
the relaying of prisoner health information, yet the self-
defense approach of officers to HCV harm reduction was
further reinforced by officers not feeling fully informed
about the infection status of prisoners. Some officers relied
on individual prisoners informing them of their status with
respect to blood-borne viruses, sometimes in a manner that
potentially reinforced their fears, or legitimized their cau-
tious approach:
I've actually found prisoners are pretty upfront about it . . . [they
tell us] "you'd better watch yourself, I've got hep C" . . .
especially on escorts when we're handcuffed to them . . . I've
had a couple of guys say "you might want to put a towel there"
because I've got exposed arms . . . They're like "you might want
to put something between us because I've got hep C."
Conversely, others suggested they did receive informal
advice about prisoner serostatus from nursing staff--often
occurring when they were present at prisoner entrant health
assessments. For example, one officer stated:
Every time we do look up the inductions [admitting prisoners],
it's hep C, hep C, hep C--the majority of them [have] hep C . . .
The nurses, when they [prisoners] come through . . . they just
sort of say he's got . . . you know . . . we can be aware that
they've got it.
The seroconversion window is known to be long in HCV,
with the appearance of measurable antibodies in the blood
being delayed for up to 6 months following exposure
(Pawlotsky, 2002; Widell et al., 2002). Furthermore, circulat-
ing HCV antibodies may remain after the viral infection has
resolved (Pawlotsky, 2003). The risk posed by a given pris-
oner was determined by HCV antibody assay, the test offered
to prisoners at entry. The possibility of infection (and there-
fore transmission risk) in the absence of a positive antibody
test was not raised by either group, nor was the potential for
overstating the transmission risk posed by prisoners a pro-
portion of whom may have cleared the virus.
Knowledge about HCV:The `known unknowns.'Although offi-
cers took precautionary measures when working with prison-
ers (i.e., treating all situations as high risk situations), most
were unclear about the proportion of prisoners infected with
HCV and the precise nature of the risk this posed. When pre-
sented with recent HCV statistics collected from SA prisons,
many of the officers indicated their surprise that prevalence
of HCV in prisoners was as high (40% of males and 66% of
females­Miller et al., 2006).
I didn't realise it was that high. I knew it was fairly high, but I
didn't think it would be that high.
It is a little bit surprising, exactly why are the females, especially
when our prison population of females, not here at the [male
only prison] but . . . females are so low in our population stats, I
mean I'm thinking, I'm surprised that they are a lot higher--I
mean they are twenty percent higher.
For some, however, the information confirmed their impressions
and served to reinforce their perceptions of risk. It doesn't
surprise me . . . So it doesn't surprise me that those numbers or
percentages . . . because we, every time we do look up at the
inductions, it's hep C, hep C, hep C--the majority of them hep
C, that come through or infectious disease.
4 SAGE Open
We all look at the case files and we actually get the prisoner list
and we can see by the prisoners whose got contagious disease,
so I actually knew it was going to be high.
Because we don't need it [the information]. Cause we assume
everyone's got everything.
Notably absent from officer interviews was discussion of
the implications for prisoner health and welfare despite the
high prevalence of HCV in the prison setting. There was no
discussion about the increased risk for susceptible (HCV
negative) prisoners.
Given their professional education and workplace setting,
prison nurses were confident in their knowledge of HCV and
other communicable disease. They stated they were not sur-
prised by the provided statistics proposing around a 40-fold
increase of HCV in prison populations relative to the general
population. They were also aware of the heightened trans-
mission risk in the context of high background prevalence:
We've been aware of hep B and hep C for a long time now, so
it's just been a further extension of the awareness threat we've
already had I guess.
Everyone . . . [is] high risk . . . even if someone comes in and has
a negative screening that could change at any time during their
stay here.
While HCV was the main focus of this investigation,
other communicable diseases were seen as a more important
issue. Concern was expressed about a range of parasitical,
fungal, and bacterial infections (including scabies and gas-
trointestinal infections) in prisoners--particularly the trans-
mission risk posed to officers. The possibility of passing on
influenza to family and friends was frequently raised.
Officers discussed recent changes to the hepatitis B and
influenza vaccination entitlements for correctional staff,
which were no longer offered routinely in the workplace.
Hepatitis B vaccinations were reimbursed by the Department,
but officers needed to arrange the three required vaccinations
from their own general practitioners (GPs), which was seen
as substantial barrier to complete vaccination:
People don't have time to do that . . . we had a . . . system in
place before that was very effective . . . and the staff were
actually, were very proactive with it. Now I would say that there
are people who wouldn't even know where they are up with,
with their actual inoculation with hepatitis B.
I mean . . . you know to me, it's almost like "Well, we don't care
about you officers. Our main concern is the prisoners, but we
don't care about the people looking after the prisoners."
Officers expressed resentment about changes to the influ-
enza vaccination schedule which meant that officers not
meeting priority vaccination criteria would have to contrib-
ute to their cost.
Why can't the officers get the influenza shots for free, or their
hep B? Why do we have to pay for it? . . . We are just as
vulnerable here for that. And . . . the other thing that's on all the
officer's minds at the moment is the bird flu. Now . . . are we
going . . . to be inoculated for it? If prisoners are all going to get
it, what about the officers? You know, these things are running
across our minds.
While nurses did not express concern about communica-
ble diseases in general, the prison officers appeared to be
highly concerned about this issue, with many expressing
their fears about contracting an infection of some type along
with what they perceived as limited education and insuffi-
cient hand washing facilities for staff.
The provision of an alcohol-based hand gel was fre-
quently proposed as a solution to a problem that appeared to
represent a source of ongoing resentment:
I also think around prison . . . there's a definite lack of hand
washing facilities . . . So you just end up, you just don't wash
your hands half the time. Whereas if it was there [hand gel], I
know damn well I'd wash my hands a lot more.
Hepatitis C is not really that contagious--it's blood-to-blood,
right? So . . . I'm more concerned around here with other skin
diseases and things like that and I'd like to see . . . like all
medical sectors have that . . . like the gel.
Update on training . . . I think that's a huge thing that we don't
get here. And . . . some more, easy, convenient way of washing
your hands. So . . . that's always been an issue for me . . . go
downstairs and hold onto a stair rail and then you get to the
bottom and think "oh, how many hands have been on that rail,"
you know?
Existing Strategies to
Minimize HCV Transmission
Prison officers and nursing staff described a limited set of
strategies they used to minimize HCV transmission. In all
cases, these were barrier strategies aimed at self-protection
and no strategies for minimizing transmission among the
prison population were nominated by either group.
Formal Protocols and Individual
Protection: Fear, Power, and Resentment
Officers were typically confident in the efficacy of the autho-
rized and voluntary preventive measures routinely used as
part of their operative duties, yet noted that occasionally the
urgency of a situation increased their risk of exposure to
HCV and other diseases. It was acknowledged that in such
cases, officers were obliged to respond to the emergent situ-
ations with less caution:
I think that we have the `blood protocol' in place and we all
know what we have to do. The only problem is we have . . .
Miller et al. 5
instances where you don't have time to put the gloves on . . . I
had an instance where a guy came out of the cell from an unlock
[formal time for unlocking cells] and he slashed up [cut himself
deliberately] whilst doing the unlock. He then took the blade and
went for his neck. Now I thought "I'm not going to run away and
go and get gloves on so I can grab him" . . . if he actually cuts the
neck and blood spurts everywhere its . . . more danger anyway--
so I literally grabbed him [without protective gloves].
In the event of such situations, prison officers might fol-
low the `blood protocol'set out to establish disease transmis-
sion and serostatus. On exposure to blood or other bodily
fluids, serology tests are immediately conducted and then
followed up with further tests at 3-month intervals. As the
protocol is initiated on slightest suspicion, almost all of the
officers had some direct experience of the process and sug-
gested that they were clear on procedure and held it in seri-
ous regard. As stated by the officer involved in the above
incident:
I did the blood protocol . . . I had the blood tests . . . and that was
that . . . it definitely put a different perspective on my sex life at
home.
Some of the officers stated they felt unsupported in such
circumstances when experiencing anxiety associated with the
prospect of being infected. The testing schedule takes 6 months
to rule out transmission, leaving officers feeling `in limbo'
before being `cleared,'as described by one officer:
I had blood protocol . . . there was no counselling support . . . no
intervention from management, no nothing. It was just "well,
take time off, come back when you're ready." . . . I think to send
somebody away from work for a period of time and not provide
them with any support in the meantime, then all you're going to
do is go home and think about it.
Nursing staff were also cautious when treating and screen-
ing prisoners, and discussed their strict adherence to `univer-
sal' precautions (the guidelines also known as `standard'
precautions) as the main strategy used to reduce the possibil-
ity of HCV transmission.
Well it's [universal precautions] something . . . that's drummed
into you at training, you know, from day "dot" really.
The previous statement suggests early legitimizing of their
subsequent concerns and fears. Similar to prison officers,
nurses focused their discussion about HCV transmission on
self-protection, with no reference to harm reduction princi-
ples in relation to prisoner welfare. There did not seem to be
a sense of coordinated effort in regard to prison-wide infec-
tion control, as the following conversation highlights:
We don't know what happens [with laundry stained with bodily
fluids].
We've got those big blue bags haven't we?
The yellow ones, yes. Anything with blood or anything like that
is bagged into a yellow bag automatically . . . they dissolve in
the laundry, so the guys over there don't have to touch it.
Yeah, I'm not familiar with what they do . . . only our side.
All SA prisoners were required to undertake a health
assessment on entry to prison at the time of the study. The
assessment, which was predominantly conducted by nursing
staff, was designed to identify most physical and mental
health problems (as well as drug dependency) and included
referral to the prison opioid replacement program where
indicated. During the assessment, nurses provided informa-
tion pertaining to HCV and other blood-borne viruses, high-
lighting the heightened risk of HCV in the prison setting and
providing information on minimizing transmission risks.
This essentially consisted of advising prisoners not to inject
while in prison. Nursing staff suggested, however, that the
importance of any information provided at this time was
likely to be overlooked by prison entrants given the compet-
ing priorities of the admissions process and the emotional
trauma associated with being newly incarcerated. As one
nurse commented:
From the moment they hit the place they're actually being
confronted with information. But, sadly, that's not the best time,
because they're stressed, they're frightened . . . sometimes
they're just too concerned with their drug withdrawals at that
stage to listen to anything you're saying anyway.
Despite the high HCV prevalence in their working setting,
the nurses provided little insight about their knowledge of,
and practice related to, HCV-infected prisoners. Neither did
they comment on strategies used to reduce transmission of
HCV among prisoners other than the information they pro-
vided at entry. Prison officers and nurses did not appear to
regard each other as theoretical `co-workers' in relation to
prisoner management. They did, however, appear to share a
similar sense of detachment from prisoner welfare in relation
to HCV.
Response to Proposed Harm Reduction Strategies
Discussion on the proposed harm reduction strategies
focused entirely on their impact on officers rather than the
broader aim of reducing HCV transmission in prisons. In all
cases, the strategies were considered in terms of the risk they
might pose to officers (including loss of power and control)
weighted against the privilege they might represent for
prisoners.
Overwhelmingly, the officers expressed a feeling of
being threatened by any action that would provide prisoners
with an opportunity to challenge the hierarchical structure
6 SAGE Open
within the prison setting. Once more, there was little consid-
eration about broader harm reduction aims which might pro-
vide prisoners with an environment that demonstrated
welfare concerns for their physical, emotional, and mental
health.
Despite their level of education and attainment of compe-
tencies required for professional practice, nurses did not
refer to their `duty of care' toward prisoners or to the human
rights of prisoners through ethical practice (Fry, 2007). In
this sense, there was little to separate the dialogue of nurses
and prison officers.
Strategy 1: Bleach provision.The provision of household
bleach to prisoners to clean syringes and other injecting
paraphernalia has been introduced in a number of prisons
in the world, with no documented safety issues so far aris-
ing (Jürgens, Ball, & Verster, 2009). The idea of making
bleach available in SA prisons, however, was not received
favorably by prison officers. Officers perceived bleach as
a potential weapon that could provide inmates with an
advantage in the prison environment. The key concern lay
with the potential transfer of power from officers to prison-
ers, by means of presenting various opportunities for
exploiting the intended uses for the chemical. Providing
bleach to help reduce HCV transmission left officers feel-
ing compromised:
I don't particularly like the idea of giving them any sort of
chemical. Bleach is a pretty strong chemical . . . I don't want to
wear it in the face. Anything you give to prisoners can become a
weapon.
The odour of bleach will actually mask so many other things . . .
I think it would be very detrimental to the whole environment
here in prison.
The potential benefits of the strategy for minimizing hep-
atitis C transmission were not explored. Proposing provision
of bleach to prisoners, despite the aim of the strategy, could
be rejected on the grounds that it was against the rules--
which seemed to underscore the apparently inherent legiti-
macy of the current position:
One of the substances is bleach, they can't have because it's not
allowed.
It still would not be allowed even then because of the chance
that it can be used against the officers.
Nurses also viewed bleaching agents negatively, suggest-
ing that chemicals had the potential to be misused by the
inmates to gain power:
I think they would be more likely to use bleach as a weapon . . .
They can use it as a weapon . . . throw it in the eyes.
Strategy 2: Safe tattooing programs. In an inquiry into HCV-
related discrimination in New South Wales (NSW), the
NSW Anti-Discrimination Board (2004) specifically rec-
ommended that the means for sterile tattoo application be
provided to prisoners. This could be accomplished by
allowing visits from commercial tattooists, or by providing
adequate infection control education to prisoners and sup-
plying single-use ink ampoules and access to autoclaves. In
describing a successful pilot for a safe tattooing scheme in
a Canadian prison, Levy et al. (2007) stated that, in addition
to improved infection control, the program benefits
included "better control of tattooing equipment and
enhanced education opportunities for both inmates and
staff." Neither commercial tattooing sessions nor training
of prisoners was supported by prison officers. These strate-
gies represented a test of power relations within a context
of almost universal feelings of being undervalued within
their workplace and by the broader society (as exemplified
in the first of the following quotes):
And I think if . . . you speak to anyone out of our unit . . . you'll
find . . . that you have, at the same time as you have police,
teachers, people who are always getting pay rises . . . when it
came to us no one wants to know us.
We subsidise their drugs, we subsidise their living . . . Tattooing
is a recreational thing--why should we subsidise, why should
we? They're in jail for what they do to society.
It just seems . . . they want, want, want and we give, give, give.
There's no stopping it.
This strategy was again interpreted as presenting opportu-
nities for abuse and providing prisoners with weapons to
gain power over the prison staff. The resentment also
extended to the proposition of providing training opportuni-
ties for prisoners and allowing them to apply tattoos to other
inmates. Officers strongly opposed the provision of any pris-
oner `liberties,' as this strategy was widely perceived.
You'll generally find the Department's easier to say "Yes" and
"let's show them how to do it," right? Because that's the easy
way around, instead of saying "no, this is not acceptable
behaviour." So instead of rewarding by giving and encouraging
it, do their bloody job and say "no."
The training of prisoners to improve vocational skills and
development was also not accepted by the nursing staff who
perceived a greater risk to other inmates through being tat-
tooed by unskilled and (potentially) unsupervised trainee tat-
tooists. Nurses did not draw on prisoner privilege as a reason
for dismissing this strategy, presenting here a point of differ-
ence in attitude to prison officers. Overall, the notion of hav-
ing prisoners conducting tattooing was principally rejected
on the basis of increased risk for skin infection:
Miller et al. 7
It's the scabbing up afterwards . . . infection, you know, all sorts
of problems.
The strategy of providing subsidized commercial tattooing
was summarily dismissed by nurses for the same reasons.
We're trying to discourage them, as before, because of the
ongoing care of them, so . . .
I think what we said before, that's the same thing.
Strategy 3: Safe injecting programs. Prison officers strongly
rejected any provision of needles and syringes, whether on
request, as part of an exchange program or through the
establishment of a safe injecting room. Again, the officers
identified concerns regarding inmate privileges and wide-
spread concerns about providing prisoners with potential
weapons. Discussion of this strategy highlighted officer
fears of being undermined by inmates, and again under-
scored how such harm reduction strategies were viewed
exclusively from a power paradigm. A safe injecting strat-
egy raised additional issues for officers in regard to the
moral appropriateness of this intervention, particularly as
they perceived their role to be a role that supported the pun-
ishment of illicit drug users:
The system works for us . . . at least while we [can] say "No" ...
we rarely find a needle--very rarely . . . [it is because] they are
hard to get in. If you had them on exchange--God knows where
they would hide them.
That means we are condoning drugs within the system. And I am
totally against that.
At the moment needles are like gold. If they start getting needles,
that becomes a weapon. That's straight away giving them
weapons.
Safe injecting programs in the prison system, of any type,
were also firmly rejected by the nursing staff. Rather, strong
support was expressed for the opioid replacement program
(the only established harm reduction program in place in the
SA prison system at that time), as an alternative to continued
illicit drug use.
But then when we've got other programs in place to take away
that whole needle problem. You know we've got methadone,
and your [buprenorphine], I think we should be pushing that.
In contrast, prison officers commonly expressed signifi-
cant doubts about the usefulness of the opioid replacement
program, with suggestions that the program was being in
appropriately targeted and monitored:
I don't agree with . . . the methadone program . . . Cause there's
too many on it. We had our count the other day--you know
there's nearly four hundred prisoners here and eighty five or
something, ninety of them . . . on methadone.
Methadone, no I don't [agree] either . . . You know, we've got
crims coming in clean, coming into the jail clean, and I know
this is happening . . . They're coming in totally clean. Other
crims are saying "this is good shit, let's sign up."
They cough it [methadone or buprenorphine] into their clothing
or their hands . . . there's lots of ways they can . . . go through a
lot of trouble to get good at, you know.
That's what I think is our big problem with our . . . methadone
program. If the methadone program was actually run and backed
up with . . . full on support and education I think we'd have a lot
more success than what it does . . . as it is now . . . they're just
getting a buzz throughout the day.
According to the nurses, the magnitude of this problem
was greatly overestimated by prison officers, as one nurse
explained:
You hear those stories all the time at all the prisons and I guess
it all boils down to they don't just go straight on. They're
assessed, and they're very thoroughly assessed. Certainly there's
some get through the net . . . And there'd be very, very few--I'm
not saying there's none, but there would be very few.
In agreement with the officers on providing injecting
equipment--and in strikingly similar language--nurses were
concerned about the possibility of condoning drug use and
suggested the provision of any needles might compromise
prison officer safety.
Well the main issue becomes a safety issue for officers. At the
moment . . . needles and syringes that are around are worth their
weight in gold, because there are so few of them . . . so there's no
way they're gonna be wasted by threatening you . . . and if all of
a sudden you can get your hands on them relatively easily, they're
not worth that much more, so they might be used as a [weapon].
It's more or less condoning drug use . . . So it's banned on the
outside, you come to prison . . . It's almost like . . . we're saying
what you're doing is OK.
Strategy 4:Education programs on HCV and other communicable
diseases. Overall, there was a more positive reaction to the
strategy of providing improved education programs and
training around HCV and other communicable disease, par-
ticularly for prison officers. Officers and nurses, however,
lacked a shared understanding of what educational opportu-
nities were already in place for prison staff. Perceptions of
what regulatory steps were required to protect staff and
inmates in promoting harm reduction were unclear across the
two operational sectors. Similarly, nursing staff and prison
officers were not aware of the procedures each group imple-
mented to reduce HCV transmission risk.
8 SAGE Open
Officers suggested that, beyond their initial orientation
training, little continued education on HCV and other com-
municable diseases was provided. Opportunity to attend pro-
fessional development sessions was apparently restricted due
to a shortage of staff to cover prison operations at any one
time. Thus, attendance was subject to staffing rosters and
prison regulations regarding staff prisoner ratios:
You get [staff education] when you first come into the job and
. . . you've got these blue gloves about the place reminding you
all the time . . . it's just an automatic reaction that you reach and
put gloves on. You're grabbing gloves and items to make sure
you're hopefully protecting yourself. It's always there . . . so you
tend to be educated all the time.
The problem is we've got is we have such a turnover [of staff].
And we have training days every four weeks, and in six years
I've had three days of training.
The provision of education to prisoners was discussed
briefly, particularly in reference to prisoner literacy, but not
otherwise in depth. It is possible that this was due to a gen-
eral belief that the provision of such education was primarily
the role of health staff, as well as a lack of clarity about the
information that was or should be provided to prisoners.
I think it [further education] would be very good, because my
understanding is what prisoners get in the way of education now
is only when they go and see a nurse or doctor here. They're not
given any literature as far as I'm aware.
I don't know what the doctor or the nurses tell them, but on their
induction interview the last thing that they sign is a form saying
that they won't share needles, syringes, toothbrushes and razors
. . . shaving equipment. And we tell them to assume everyone's
got hep C . . . but I don't know what happens on the . . . medical
side.
Raising awareness of HCV and other communicable dis-
eases was the one strategy accepted by officers to reduce
harm in the prison environment. As identified previously,
however, responses to the strategy tended to focus on ways in
which the strategy worked toward the protection of correc-
tional staff, with little attention given to reducing HCV trans-
mission in general.
Education and information sessions were welcomed by
nursing staff as an important strategy to raise awareness of
HCV among prison officers and inmates. There was agree-
ment among nurses that health staff were adequately
informed and routinely updated on HCV and other commu-
nicable diseases. As noted previously, nurses questioned the
approaches used to disseminate HCV information on admis-
sion to prisoners. While the officers clearly saw information
provision as the role of health staff, there was evidence that
some nurses assigned that responsibility to the prisoners
themselves:
There's plenty of literature around and things like that . . . but I
suppose it's the enthusiasm of individual prisoners. If they want
to seek it, they'll seek it--they've certainly got access to it.
It's discussed on admission with each prisoner . . . generally
when we talk to them they're pretty au fait on what you're
supposed to do . . . they know, it's whether or not they stick to it.
But they're all made aware. They all know when they come in
. . . they're all adults, at the end of the day they've got to be
responsible for what they do when they get in here . . . to put
themselves at risk . . . well that's a choice.
There were few formal structures described to provide
ongoing education or HCV information to inmates. Nursing
practice was apparently restricted to the provision of clinical
care in the infirmary with little if any responsibility for health
promotion within the broader prison environment. With the
exception of routine information provided at the initial
assessment, discussion about HCV-related issues occurred
primarily when initiated by the prisoner themselves. Nurses
attributed a lack of knowledge among prison officers with
respect to HCV and other communicable diseases, which
they believed was expressed in a tendency to overreact to
assumed risks associated with some situations:
Obviously, we're not getting enough of their story . . . saying
these things, [there is a] misunderstanding of infectious diseases.
They're almost at the opposite extreme . . . we had that one last
week when a fellow slashed up and they came in with the white
suits.
Discussion
The interviews raised many concerns about the prison work
environment, roles and responsibilities of staff members.
The topic of HCV harm reduction was overshadowed by
what appeared to be deep rooted societal values and attitudes
of prisoners and punishment. Thus, the notion of power and
privilege was threaded throughout the statements and con-
versational exchanges within the transcripts. Such ideals
essentially frame the context in which HCV harm reduction
strategies are potentially implemented, yet prison staff
(prison officers in particular) appeared loathe to present
views on such matters. Where prisoner duty of care is posi-
tioned by prison staff should be understood in this context.
The prison officer interviews revealed widespread feel-
ings of being undervalued and resentment about increased
pressures in the workplace, combined with perceptions of
inadequate resources and staffing levels. Officers felt ill
equipped to deal with what they saw as increasing preva-
lence of mental health and drug-related problems in the
prison population. Some of this may have manifested in a
tendency to stereotype prisoners negatively. Nurses too dem-
onstrated considerable frustration about the increasing
Miller et al. 9
prevalence of drug-related harm in the prison setting. There
was a lack of integration between nursing and correctional
staff with little awareness of the others' roles, duties, and
concerns.
Nurses and prison officers perceived hepatitis C as an
important issue in their workplace. Prison officers did
express greater concern about the potential for HCV trans-
mission; however, both groups were confident in the effec-
tiveness of `universal precautions.'While hepatitis C was the
main focus of this inquiry, it was clear that prison officers
were as, if not more, concerned about a range of microbial
agents--with fear of transmission of disease to family and
friends commonly expressed. Improving access to appropri-
ate hand washing facilities, including the provision of alco-
hol-based hand washing gels, were among strategies
proposed and commonly supported by officers.
The `blood protocol' was a common experience among
officers and most reported a lack of departmental support
during the relatively lengthy waiting periods between fol-
low-up tests. At the time of the interviews, requirements for
officer co-payments for influenza vaccinations and self-
directed GP attendance for the hepatitis B vaccination pro-
gram had been imposed. Prison officers expressed resentment
about these perceived barriers to complete immunization--
particularly given prisoner vaccinations programs remained
intact.
Nurses expressed confidence in their knowledge about
HCV and other communicable diseases. Conversely, officers
frequently expressed the need for ongoing training and edu-
cation and were concerned about their current level of under-
standing. The conviction that nurses were providing opiate
replacement therapy to prisoners who had entered `clean'
was widely voiced by prison officers. Nurses described the
ongoing assessment processes followed to ensure only opi-
oid-dependent prisoners entered the opiate replacement pro-
gram, yet these processes were not generally known by
prison officers. Prison nurses were unaware of restrictions to
the officer vaccination program, another major issue for
prison officers. It seems a more integrated approach to pris-
oner management will be required if the well-being of pris-
oners as well as the work environment of both prison-based
staff are to be improved in future.
An increase in HCV education programs was the only
proposed strategy accepted by the prison officers and nursing
staff. Overwhelmingly, officers perceived the introduction of
bleach, subsidized commercial tattoo application or inmate
training in tattoo application, and safe injecting environ-
ments as a threat to officer­prisoner power relations and a
means of providing privileged conditions to inmates. Such
views were reinforced by a hierarchical system apparent in
the prison environment. The proposed strategies were per-
ceived to represent an undermining of their role and status. In
particular, they were threatened by a loss of respect from the
community for working in an environment that benefited
prisoner privilege. Officers voiced concerns about perceived
entitlements they felt had been eroded in recent years, such
as staff hepatitis B and influenza vaccinations. The notion of
shifting power relations compounded by strategies that were
perceived to favor prisoners served to confirm to officers that
they worked in a system that had little regard or value for
their responsibilities and the high risk environment they
existed within.
The context of power struggle and ongoing resentment
colored the officers' assessments of the harm reduction strat-
egies proposed. Hesitation to engage and discuss strategies
regarding health and prisoner welfare appears to have been
driven by widespread perceptions that such topics sat outside
of their working role. Thus, there was a tendency to refer
back to their position rather than engage in the discussion
with confidence to declare authoritative comment.
The remaining strategies, rejected for their perceived
threat to staff, also drew on the power relations and employee
hierarchy of the prison setting. Prisoner privilege was per-
ceived as an indictment on prison officers as they regarded
their role as important in the upholding of community values
and, thus, resented any intervention that appeared to reward
prisoners. Changes to the officer vaccination program and
limited education opportunities were perceived as a lack of
support for improving officer working conditions and safety.
It is possible that this might further exacerbate resentment of
prisoner `privilege' by lowering officer self-esteem and
respect for the correctional system and governance.
Given this context, it is not surprising that officers were
strongly opposed to HCV interventions that have the poten-
tial to improve prisoner welfare. Although nurses did voice
concerns about the threat of skin infection and scarring in
relation to tattooing, they also tended to demonstrate reduced
interest in the welfare of inmates overall, inferring that pris-
oners were disinterested in the health and safety of fellow
prisoners. There was little evidence that nurses perceived a
duty of care toward their clients as might be ordinarily
expected of nurses in other clinical settings. It could be con-
cluded that such attitudes are representative of the context in
which prison officers and nursing staff work. The tensions
and high risk environment in which staff need to respond and
make immediate decisions have the potential to drain com-
passion and observance of a duty of care (Tewksbury &
Higgins, 2006). Similar experiences of frustration and of
being undervalued may have driven some degree of accul-
turation, particularly in what seems to have been the nurses'
selective adaptation and adoption of the value systems of the
correctional workforce (Padilla & Perez, 2003).
The very high risk for hepatitis C in the correctional envi-
ronment, for prisoners and prison staff, presents an urgent
case for the introduction of further harm reduction strategies
in this setting. Strategies such as the provision of bleach to
prisoners and even a clean needle program (given successful
international pilots) are worthy of serious consideration. It
seems highly unlikely, however, that either of these strate-
gies would be accepted within the context described here.
10 SAGE Open
There has been widespread acknowledgment of the prin-
ciple of providing prisoners with the same standard of health
care available to the communities in which the prison is situ-
ated (WHO Global Programme on AIDS, 1993). As Jürgens,
Nowak, and Day (2011) discussed, prisoners may lose their
right to liberty but no other international human right and
privilege. They stated, "The state's duty with respect to
health does not end at the gates of prisons" (p. 17). Yet,
Australia, as with elsewhere in the world, has been very slow
to adopt these guidelines (Bollini et al., 2002). Nonetheless,
against profound political and community opposition, a
prison-based pilot needle-exchange program has recently
been approved in one Australian jurisdiction (Sweet, 2012).
In introducing this pilot, the Chief Minister of the Australian
Capital Territory (Ms. Katy Gallagher) has taken a very
brave political step given almost unswerving adherence to
the `tough on drugs' mantra across the broader community.
As Wodak (2012) stated, "More draconian approaches to
prison are always expensive, rarely effective and often have
severe unintended negative consequences. But draconian
approaches are political viagra while pragmatic and effective
approaches are often considered politically suicidal."
It seems reasonable to assume that community values are
shared by prison officers and nursing staff and would, there-
fore, color their own perceptions of preventive strategies
within the specific context described.
We used a qualitative approach to explore the perspec-
tives of prison staff in this study. Unlike quantitative
approaches, the purpose of sampling is not to achieve repre-
sentativeness but to explore a range of opinions. Thus, the
sample size will differ depending on the issue and the various
perspectives associated with it. Achieving `saturation' is
often put forward as the main criterion assessing the ade-
quacy of sampling for qualitative interview--defined as the
point at which no new themes or concepts are provided on an
issue (Mason, 2010). This is a hotly debated criterion for
quality, however, as the actual method of sampling and the
intensiveness of the interviewing are also put forward as
important modifiers in identifying the saturation point
(O'Reilly & Parker, 2012). The 15 interviewees were self-
selected and this may have limited the range of views
expressed. Nonetheless, the participants were site-specific
staff members who were not homogeneous with respect to
age, sex, duration of employment, or role within the prison.
This, in combination with the near consensus on a range of
views expressed, provides some support for the adequacy of
the sampling procedure used.
That the fieldwork for this study was conducted some
time ago may be considered a limitation of this analysis.
Participation in the interviews was facilitated by conducting
interviews during work hours and on paid time. Yet, the need
for arranging cover for their work roles increased the possi-
bility that participants might be identifiable, and this formed
a key reason for the delay in the secondary analysis. Yet, the
context described remains relevant to the seemingly
intractable position of SA Department for Correctional
Services in relation to harm reduction approaches. For
instance, a suggestion for the national implementation of the
prison-based pilot needle-exchange program (discussed
above) was strongly opposed by prison officers across
Australia for the same reasons discussed in our article.
Ruling out a similar pilot for SA, Department of Correctional
Services of SA claimed it "would put staff and prisoners at
risk because needles could be used as weapons" (ABC News
Online, 2012).
Conclusion
As discussed by Mogg and Levy (2009), an impasse has
now been reached between proponents of the provision of
preventive resources (such as needle and syringe programs)
and their opponents--where no amount of evidence sup-
porting these resources in prisons can overcome the wide-
spread conviction that needles and bleach could be used as
weapons, and that their provision is tantamount to condon-
ing drug use. As our analysis has demonstrated, the power
and privilege paradigm fed by wells of resentment and frus-
tration can only more firmly entrench this deadlock.
Successfully commencing pragmatic dialogue about the
need for further harm reduction approaches may ultimately
depend on directly addressing these contextual factors.
Improving officer education around communicable dis-
eases, providing assistance to achieve appropriate levels of
vaccination coverage, and generally promoting a more inte-
grated approach to the management of communicable dis-
eases and infection control by correctional and health staff
may help to foster a more collaborative approach to future
harm reduction strategies.
