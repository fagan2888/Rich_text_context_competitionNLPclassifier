RECENT REPORTS, INCLUDING 2
by the Institute of Medicine
(IOM) of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences, argue that the
quality of health care in the United
States falls far short of biomedical
knowledge and that this gap in quality
is primarily a failure of organization,
rather than of individual physi-
cians.1-7 The IOM and others have called
for the implementation of organized
processes to improve quality and have
argued that government and large pri-
vate purchasers of health care should
provide physician organizations (POs)
with incentives to implement such pro-
cesses.8-14 The IOM also has advocated
government financial assistance to POs
to improve their clinical information
technology (IT), which is considered
fundamental to organized attempts to
improve quality of care.2,15,16
Despite this attention and despite a
growingbodyofresearchsupportingthe
effectiveness of organized processes in
improving quality of care,17 little infor-
mation is available to answer 4 funda-
mental questions: (1) To what extent do
POs--medical groups and indepen-
dent practice associations (IPAs)--
currently use organized processes to im-
provequality?18 (2)DoPOshaveexternal
incentives to improve quality? (3) What
clinical IT capabilities do POs have? and

IT capabilities associated with in-

Context Organized care management processes (CMPs) can improve health care qual-
ity for patients with chronic diseases. The Institute of Medicine of the National Acad-
emy of Sciences has called for public and private purchasers of health care to create
incentives for physician organizations (POs) to use CMPs and for the government to
assist POs in implementing information technology (IT) to facilitate CMP use. Re-
search is lacking about the extent to which POs use CMPs or about the degree to which
incentives, IT, or other factors are associated with their use.
Objectives To determine the extent to which POs with 20 or more physicians use
CMPs and to identify key factors associated with CMP use for 4 chronic diseases (asthma,
congestive heart failure, depression, and diabetes).
Design, Setting, and Participants One thousand five hundred eighty-seven US
POs (medical groups and independent practice associations) with 20 or more physi-
cians were identified using 5 large databases. One thousand one hundred four of these
POs (70%) agreed to participate in a telephone survey conducted between Septem-
ber 2000 and September 2001. Sixty-four responding POs were excluded because they
did not treat any of the 4 diseases, leaving 1040 POs.
Main Outcome Measures Extent of use of CMPs as calculated on the basis of a
summary measure, a PO care management index (POCMI; range, 0-6) and factors
associated with CMP use.
Results Physician organizations' mean use of CMPs was 5.1 of a possible 16; 50%
used 4 or fewer. External incentives and clinical IT were most strongly associated with
CMP use. Controlling for other factors, use of the 2 most strongly associated incentives--
public recognition and better contracts for health care quality--was associated with
use of 1.3 and 0.7 additional CMPs, respectively (P.001 and P=.007). Each addi-
tional IT capability was associated with 0.37 additional CMPs (P.001). However, 33%
of POs reported no external incentives and 50% reported no clinical IT capability.
Conclusions The use of CMPs varies greatly among POs, but it is low on average.
Government and private purchasers of health care may increase CMP use by provid-
ing external incentives for improvement of health care quality to POs and by assisting
them in improving their clinical IT capability.

creased use of organized processes by
POs to improve the quality of care?
To address these questions, we con-
ducted a National Survey of Physician
Organizations and the Management of
ChronicIllness(NSPO).Weused5sepa-
rate databases to develop the most ex-
tensive census available to date of medi-
cal groups and IPAs with 20 or more
physicians, and we conducted a tele-
phone survey with 1040 of these POs.
WefocusedonPOswith20ormorephy-
sicians because, compared with indi-
vidual and small group practices, these
larger organizations should have more
capacity to invest in the management
time and expertise, clinical IT systems,
and skilled nonphysician staff that are
thought to be necessary for the creation
and maintenance of organized pro-
cesses to improve the quality of care.19-22
Wecalledtheseorganizedprocessescare
management processes (CMPs) and hy-
pothesized that the extent to which a PO
uses CMPs will vary with its IT capabil-
ity and with the incentives for improve-
ment of quality provided by health in-
suranceplansandhealthcarepurchasers.
The NSPO survey focused on 4 types
of CMPs--case management, perfor-
mance feedback to individual physi-
cians, use of disease registries, that is,
lists of a PO's patients with a particular
chronic illness that make it possible for
the PO to organize care for patients with
that particular illness, and use of clini-
cal practice guidelines in conjunction
with physician education and elec-
tronic or chart-based reminder sys-
tems.Supportforself-managementskills
for chronically ill patients was not as-
sessed for the 4 individual chronic dis-
eases surveyed but only for managing
their disease in general (BOX).
We chose these CMPs because evi-
dence is growing that they are effective,
individually and especially in combina-
tion, in improving quality of care.17,23-27
Case management programs repeat-
edly have been shown to improve out-
comes for patients with congestive heart
failure (CHF), diabetes, and mixed co-
morbidities.28 While clinical practice
guidelines alone have not been dem-
onstrated to change physician perfor-
mance,29 a Cochrane review and re-
cently published studies, including a
meta-analysis, have found that guide-
linesinconjunctionwithphysicianedu-
cation or reminder systems do im-
prove physician management of several
chronic conditions and may improve
clinical outcomes.17,30,31 Performance
feedback to physicians has been shown
to improve medical practice in both a
Cochrane review and a separate meta-
analysis, although the effect was
small.17,32 Disease registries have been
shown to be important components of
health care management.33 Patient self-
management education can succeed in
improving clinical outcomes accord-
ing to a Cochrane review of use of this
technique for patients with asthma34
and according to randomized con-
trolled trials of patients with diabe-
tes35,36 and with a variety of other
chronic diseases.37,38
The NSPO survey focused on POs'
use of CMPs for asthma,39,40 CHF,41-43
depression,44-48 and diabetes.26,49,50 These
4 diseases are directly responsible for
approximately 140000 deaths each year
in the United States,51 generate at least
$173 billion in annual costs,52-55 and are
conditions for which evidence sug-
gests that CMPs can improve the qual-
ity of health care.17,23,56
METHODS
Development of a National Census
of Medical Groups and IPAs
To generate as complete a national cen-
sus as possible of medical groups and
IPAs with 20 or more physicians, we
combined databases from the Medical
Group Management Association, Engle-
wood, Colo; Dorland Healthcare Infor-
mation, Philadelphia, Pa; National IPA
Coalition, Oakland, Calif; American
Hospital Association, Chicago, Ill; and
Virginia Commonwealth University
Study of Physician Organizations, Rich-
mond (this database merges data from
6 sources, including a survey of medi-
cal groups by the American Medical As-
sociation, Chicago, Ill) (R.R.G., un-
published data, 2002). The National
Opinion Research Center at the Uni-
versity of Chicago made preliminary
telephone calls to all 3233 organiza-
tions identified to verify their type and
size and to arrange an appointment for
a telephone survey. On the basis of these
calls, 1646 organizations (51%) were
excluded because they were out of busi-
ness or could not be located (21%),
Box. Care Management Processes Surveyed*
Case Management
Case management is available at the request of the physician and/or assigned to
all severely ill patients with the disease.
Physician Feedback
Physicians receive feedback on specific practices (eg, use of anti-inflammatory medi-
cation in asthma, angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors in congestive heart
failure, retinal screening in diabetes). Depression was omitted for this category.
Disease Registry
This is maintained for patients with the disease.
Clinical Practice Guidelines
These are (1) adopted and (2) physicians are trained in the guidelines, and (3) the
guidelines must be present in patient charts or in reminder systems or in order-
entry systems. An answer of yes for use of all 3 is required.
Self-management Skills
Programs to teach chronically ill patients skills for better managing their illness in
general, not for each of the 4 chronic diseases surveyed.
*For each care management process, the organization receives 1 point for each disease for
each affirmative answer (except for feedback to physicians for depression) and 1 point for
use of programs to teach patients self-management skills.

were not a medical group or IPA (20%),
had fewer than 20 physicians (17%),
were duplicates (20%), or were ex-
cluded for miscellaneous reasons
(11%). In addition, we excluded the
10% of POs that were composed of ra-
diologists, pathologists, chiroprac-
tors, podiatrists, ophthalmologists,
anesthesiologists, or emergency depart-
ment physicians.
Study Population
Of the 1587 organizations remaining,
1104 (70%) responded to the survey.
Information on nonrespondents is lim-
ited: they did not differ from respon-
dents by size or by state where they were
located, but response rates were sig-
nificantly higher for IPAs (79%) than
for medical groups (66%; P.001). Of
the 1104 respondents, we excluded 64
organizations that stated that they did
not treat any of the 4 chronic diseases
we surveyed, leaving 1040 POs (693
medical groups and 347 IPAs) in-
cluded in our study.
Survey Development
and Administration
The NSPO survey was developed based
on review of the literature on health care
quality improvement, on dimensions of
the Assessment of Chronic Illness Care
model,57 on feedback from the NSPO's
national advisory committee, and on in-
put from a focus group of 9 medical di-
rectors from POs. The survey was re-
visedafterapilottestwasconductedwith
36medicalgroupsand10IPAs.Thesur-
vey instrument is available from the cor-
responding author.
Organizations that agreed to partici-
pate were sent in advance a packet with
a worksheet to be completed prior to
the interview. Specially trained NORC
interviewers then conducted 60-
minute telephone surveys between Sep-
tember 2000 and September 2001 with
each organization's president, chief ex-
ecutive officer, or medical director, us-
ing Computer Assisted Telephone In-
terviewing.
Outcome Measures
To assess POs' use of CMPs, interview-
ers asked, for each of the 4 chronic dis-
eases, whether the PO used case man-
agement, a disease registry, clinical
guidelines, and feedback to physi-
cians (feedback was not asked for de-
pression) (Box). Organizations also
were asked whether they have general
programs to teach patients self-
management skills for chronic dis-
eases. To avoid positive but overly gen-
eral answers that might not accurately
reflect an organization's use of CMPs
(eg, "Yes, we have guidelines"), sur-
vey questions were designed to probe
for more specific answers (eg, "Are the
guidelines placed in patient charts, re-
minder systems, or order entry sys-
tems?" and "Do you feed back data to
physicians on appropriate use of ACE
[angiotensin-converting enzyme] in-
hibitors for patients with CHF?").
To assess the external incentives for a
PO to improve quality of care, the sur-
vey asked about a range of 7 incentives:
whether the PO received a bonus from
health plans (ie, additional income from
health plans for scoring well on quality
measures), public recognition (eg,
through report cards), or better con-
tracts with health plans for quality and
whether it was required to report Health
PlanEmployerDataandInformationSet
data,58 outcomes data, results of quality
improvement projects, or patient satis-
faction data to an outside organization
(TABLE 1).
The use of clinical IT systems59 was
assessed by asking POs whether they
use an electronic data system and, if so,
whether the IT system includes a stan-
dardized problem list, the majority of
physician progress notes, medications
prescribed, medication decision sup-
port (ie, reminders and/or drug inter-
actions information), laboratory re-
sults, and radiology results (TABLE 2).

We also assessed other organiza-
tional characteristics of POs that may
affect the use of CMPs: the survey pro-
vided demographic information on the
type of PO (medical group or IPA),
number of physicians, practice type,
practice ownership, and US location
(divided by the American Medical As-
sociation census regions) (TABLE 3).
Health maintenance organizations
(HMOs) also might affect POs' use of
CMPs. We used InterStudy data to de-
fine HMO penetration as the number of
people enrolled in HMOs in a PO's
county divided by the county popula-
tion.60 The survey asked whether a PO
took at least some risk for hospital-
ized HMO patients (964 POs an-
swered this question) and whether
HMOs delegate utilization manage-
ment responsibility for hospitalized
HMO patients to the PO (965 POs an-
swered this question) (Table 3).61
Statistical Analysis
We used multivariate linear regres-
sion to measure the association of ex-
ternal incentives, IT capability, char-
acteristics of POs, HMO penetration,
and physician group health plan con-
tracting characteristics with POs' use of
CMPs. The outcome variable in our
main model is a summary measure--a
Physician Organization Care Manage-
ment Index (POCMI)--with a range of
0 to 16. An organization's POCMI score
is the number of CMPs used by the PO
for the 4 chronic diseases: 1 point for
each of the 4 CMPs for each disease
(with the exception of feedback to phy-
sicians for depression, which was not
asked) plus 1 point for use of pro-
grams to teach patient self-manage-
ment support skills for chronic ill-
nesses in general (Box). Omission of the
feedback question for depression meant
that depression was not weighted as
heavily (3 possible points for CMP use
for depression) as the other diseases
(each of which has 4 possible points for
CMP use). Regression results did not
change significantly when depression
was excluded from the model nor when
depression was weighted equally to the
other diseases.
ThePOCMIscoreswerenormallydis-
tributed. The POCMI index exhibited a
high level of internal consistency reli-
abilitywithaCronbachof0.86.Analy-
ses were performed using SAS version
8.2 (SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC).
The POCMI index treats the use of
each type of CMP as equally impor-
tant. Some CMPs may be more effec-
tive in improving quality of health
care than others, but we did not
believe that sufficient evidence existed
to weight them differentially in our
analysis.17 We did, however, run
regression analyses using a variety of
different weightings; the results of
these analyses did not differ signifi-
cantly from our main model.
The 4 external incentives concern-
ing reports to an outside organization
(of Health Plan Employer Data and In-
formation Set data, outcomes data, re-
sults of quality improvement projects,
and patient satisfaction data) are highly
correlated with each other and are in-
cluded in our main regression analy-
sis as a single summary variable with a
range of 0 to 4. The 3 other incentives
are included individually. Results did
not change when all 7 external incen-

tives were included individually, ex-
cept that the reporting requirements
variables, which are significant as a
group, are not significant individu-
ally. We included the 6 IT measures as
a single index variable, with a range of
0 to 6, in our main model. Results did
not differ when the IT measures were
examined individually rather than as an
index in a regression analysis.
Ninety-three POs (9%) stated that
they treated only 3 of the 4 diseases, and
83 (8%) stated that they treated 2 or
fewer diseases. In our main model, we
included these POs and assigned them
scores for each disease they did not treat
equal to the mean score for that dis-
ease for all POs that treated that dis-
ease. We also conducted regression
analyses that included only the 947 POs
that treated at least 3 of the 4 diseases.
Results from these analyses did not dif-
fer significantly from our main model.
RESULTS
The mean POCMI score was 5.1, indi-
cating that the average PO used 32% of
the 16 CMPs (TABLE 4); 15.2% used
none, 49.6% used 4 or fewer, and 5.3%
used 13 or more CMPs. Case manage-
ment was the most commonly used
CMP: that is, the mean percentage of
POs using case management across all
4 diseases was 37.6% (TABLE 5). Clini-
cal guidelines used in conjunction with
reminders placed in charts or in the
electronic medical record were least
commonly used (28.5%) (Table 5).
Care management processes were
implemented most often for diabetes
(42.5% of POs) and least often for de-
pression (17.1% of POs). Few POs used
any one type of CMP across all 4 ill-
nesses (range, 10.5%-18.5%, for clini-
cal guidelines, disease registry, physi-
cian feedback, and case management),
and fewer (3.2%-12.7%, for depres-
sion, asthma, CHF, and diabetes) used
all 4 types of CMP to focus on any 1
illness (Table 5). Self-management pro-
grams for chronically ill patients were
provided by 589 (56.6%) of POs (not
included in Table 5 because the sur-
vey asked about self-management pro-
grams in general, not for each of the 4
diseases).
The results of multivariate analysis
showed that the presence of external in-
centives to improve quality of care was
most strongly associated with use of
CMPs (TABLE 6). When all other vari-
ables, including other external incen-
tives, are held constant, POs that re-
ceived public recognition for scoring
wellonqualityofcaremeasuresused1.3
more CMPs (P.001). Physician orga-
nizations that reported receiving better
contractsforscoringwellused0.74more
CMPs (P=.007). Requiring POs to re-
port quality of care data and activities
to outside organizations also was sig-
nificantlyassociatedwithincreasedCMP
use (P.001). Receiving a bonus for
scoring well on quality of care mea-
sures was not significantly associated
with CMP use (P=.08), possibly be-
cause POs generally reported that the
amounts received were very small.
The mean number of external incen-
tives reported by POs was only 1.7 of the
7externalincentivessurveyed(Table1).
Three hundred forty-one (32.8%) POs
had no incentives, 776 (73.6%) had 2
or fewer incentives, while only 177
(17.0%) had 4 or more incentives to im-
prove quality (data not shown).
Clinical IT also is significantly asso-
ciated with CMP use: each additional
capability is associated with the use of
0.37 additional CMPs (P.001) (Table
6). However, the average PO had only
1.4 (23%) of the 6 clinical IT capabili-
ties surveyed (Table 2). Five hundred

nineteen (49.9%) of POs had none and
816 (78.5%) had 2 or fewer (data not
shown) of the 6 clinical IT capabilities
surveyed.
The strong association of external in-
centives and IT with the use of CMPs
was found in every model we tested, in-
cluding the POCMI model presented in
this article, which evaluates the asso-
ciation with all types of CMPs sur-
veyed as a group, the POCMI model
presented in this article with depres-
sion excluded, the POCMI model with
a variety of weights assigned to indi-
vidual types of CMPs (data not shown),
the POCMI model run for each of the
4 chronic diseases individually (data not
shown), and models in which the as-
sociation is tested for each type of CMP
separately (data not shown).
Healthmaintenanceorganizationpen-
etration, PO size, hospital or health plan
ownership of a PO, and the percentage
of patients for which a PO is delegated
utilization management also are statis-
tically significantly associated (P.05)
with the use of CMPs by POs, but their
impact is small (Table 6). For example,
an increase of 100 physicians in a medi-
cal group is associated with use of only
one fifth of an additional CMP, and an
increase from 0 to 50% in the percent-
age of patients for whom the PO is del-
egated utilization management is asso-
ciatedwithuseofonly1additionalCMP.
COMMENT
Many medical groups and IPAs have
implemented CMPs to improve the
quality of care for their patients. But on
average, POs use 5.1 CMPs, which is
less than one third of the 16 CMPs sur-
veyed. These findings can be inter-
preted as encouraging that POs are us-
ing any CMPs at all. However, the fact
that 50% of POs use 4 or fewer of the
16 CMPs and that POs lacked regis-
tries of patients with a chronic disease
69% of the time suggests that orga-
nized processes to improve the qual-
ity of health care remain relatively un-
common in POs. It is difficult for an
organization to provide proactive health
care for a specific group of patients if
the organization lacks these registries,
that is, it does not know who these pa-
tients are.
Our findings support the IOM and
others8-14 who argue that rewarding POs
for improving quality of care is impor-
tant. Giving POs public recognition and
better contracts for scoring well on
quality measures is associated with the
use of 2.0 additional CMPs--a substan-
tial increase, given that the average PO
uses only a total of 5.1 CMPs. How-
ever, our data also confirm the wide-
spread perception that incentives for
POs to improve quality are uncom-
mon10,20,62: 32% of organizations re-
ported having no incentives and 74%
had 2 or fewer of 7 incentives sur-
veyed to improve quality of care.
Our findings also support the belief
that clinical IT is important, but that
most POs lack clinical IT capabili-
ties.10,20 Each additional IT capability
was associated with the use of 0.37
more CMPs, but 50% of POs had none
of and more than 78% had 2 or fewer
of the 6 IT capabilities surveyed.
The NSPO is the first study, to our
knowledge, to provide national data on
the use of CMPs by POs to improve the
quality of health care and to show that
clinical IT capabilities and external in-
centives to improve quality are each
strongly associated with POs' use of
CMPs. This strong association was pre-
sent in every model for which we con-
ducted statistical analyses, including
models using a variety of weights for
individual types of CMP, models test-
ing the association for individual types
of CMP, and models testing the asso-
ciation for individual diseases.
Our study has limitations, each of
which suggests areas for future re-
search.First,althoughrespondentswere
assured that neither they nor their or-
ganizations would be identified, some
may have overstated their organiza-
tion's CMP use, even though the sur-
vey questions were designed to mini-
mize this possibility. Also, it is possible
thattheremayhavebeenaresponsebias,
such that organizations that use few or
no CMPs were less likely to agree to be
surveyed. For both these reasons, our
datamaysomewhatoverestimatetheex-
tent of CMP use among POs in the

United States. Second, even though POs
were asked what CMPs were used by
their organization as a whole, we do not
know whether each individual practice
site within a PO was in fact using the
CMPs claimed for the organization. It is
possible that some sites may have been
using less and some using more CMPs.
Third, in this cross-sectional study we
demonstrate strong associations be-
tween certain variables and CMP use,
butwecannotshowthedirectionofcau-
sality, which may work to varying ex-
tentsinbothdirections.Forexample,we
suggest that it is plausible that the pres-
ence of external incentives to improve
quality would induce POs to imple-
ment CMPs, but we cannot exclude the
possibility that health plans and pur-
chasers are more likely to provide such
incentivestoPOsthatalreadyhavesome
CMPs in place, that is, that have shown
some capability to manage health care.
Analogously, clinical IT increases orga-
nizations' ability to implement CMPs,
but organizations planning to imple-
ment CMPs may be more likely to in-
vestinclinicalIT.Simplyprovidingclini-
cal IT systems (eg, through government
financial support) to POs that lack both
interest and incentives to improve qual-
ity may be unlikely to have much effect.
Underlying our study is the hypoth-
esis that CMPs improve the quality of
health care. Although evidence to sup-
port this hypothesis is accumulating,
more research is needed to further
explore the relationship between CMP
use and clinical outcomes, specifically
whether certain individual CMPs and
combinations of CMPs are more effec-
tive than others for specific chronic dis-
eases. This research will be difficult.61,63
Our study also assumes that organiza-
tions of 20 or more physicians are more
likely to implement CMPs than smaller
organizations, but the extent to which
physicians who work in smaller prac-
tices use CMPs is unknown. Further
research is needed to identify the extent
of CMP use and its relationship to clini-
cal outcomes as well as the factors asso-
ciated with CMP use in these practices.
Finally, we are able to explain 28% of
thevarianceinCMPuseamongPOs,but
the literature suggests that factors not
evaluated in this study, particularly an
organization's leadership and culture,
also are important and should be a sub-
ject for further research.64-68
The findings from the NSPO have a
number of important implications. For
medicine as a profession, the fact that
the use of CMPs is relatively uncom-
mon in POs raises the question of
whether such processes will be devel-
opedprimarilybyotherentities,suchas
health plans and pharmaceutical com-
panies, without adequate coordination
with physicians. For government and
large private purchasers of health care,
this study provides strong confirma-
tion for the IOM's assertions that orga-
nized processes to improve quality of
care are not common in POs and that
many physicians work in practices that
have neither incentives nor IT capabili-
ties to improve quality. Our data sup-
port policy recommendations by the
IOMandothersthatPOsshouldbegiven
incentives to improve quality and sup-
port for developing clinical IT systems.

ity of care, though still exceptional, are
