OBJECTIVES: Relationships between religion and body weight were examined in a US national sample.
METHODS: Data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in the United States (MIDUS), collected through telephone
and postal questionnaires, were analyzed for 3032 adults aged 25­74.
RESULTS: Religious denomination was significantly related to higher body weight in men after accounting for socio-
demographic controls. Conservative Protestant men had a 1.1 7 0.45 higher body mass index (BMI) than those reporting no
religious affiliation. Other religion variables that initially had significant relationships with greater body weight before adjusting
for control variables became nonsignificant after smoking was controlled. No significant relationships between religion and body
weight were present in women.
CONCLUSIONS: Religious denomination was related to body weight in men. Other dimensions of religiosity showing a
relationship with higher BMI appeared to be because of the lower rates of smoking among more religious individuals.

Introduction
Excess body weight is a global public health issue.1­3 The
most prevalent nutrition problem in many postindustrial
societies,4 obesity is rising in incidence, leading many to
label the current weight patterns as an `obesity epidemic'.5,6
Obesity has physical consequences for morbidity7,8,1 and
social consequences such as stigmatization.9,10 Thus, the
quest for understanding body weight is expanding to seek
new predictors. The current analysis examined a social factor
that has received little previous attention in relation with
body weight: religion.
The empirical evidence linking religion and health has
grown substantially over the last decade to the extent that
even the most skeptical scientists are taking seriously the
myriad of literature identifying religion's association with
better health.11 Numerous longitudinal, multivariate stu-
dies12­14 have found `substantial positive effects of religious
involvement on variousy physical health outcomes, in-
cluding mortality'15 (p 373).
Body weight may be a mediator between religion and
mortality,14 with religion possibly serving as a protective
factor against extreme overweight.16,17 Religion may con-
tribute to decreased body weight in several ways.
Stress or anxiety is related to higher body weight,18­20
particularly in women.21 Stress-induced eating can trigger
onset and relapses of obesity and increase preferences for
high fat and/or sweet foods.18 Religion is a means through
which some people counter and cope with stress,22 and may
decrease body weight through helping adherents cope with
stressors.
Social support provided by religion may be another
mechanism contributing to decreased body weight.23,15,11
Social support predicted lower children's obesity risk in
Denmark24 and in the United States,25 and the weight loss
literature frequently cites social support as a critical compo-
nent in successful long-term weight loss.26,27 Religious social
support may not only promote decreased body weight, but
also provide the social support needed for weight loss and
maintenance.28
Components of religious theology may also discourage
obesity. In historical Catholicism, depriving the body of food
was analogous to purity.29 In Judaism, the human body is
considered to be made in the image of God.30 And among
Conservative Protestants, the body is taught to be the
`temple of the Holy Spirit'.31 Viewing one's body as made
in the image of and the home of deity may promote good
health and thus ideal body weight. Given the greater
emphasis on good health through seeing the body as sacred,
the religious may be more physically active than their
less religious counterparts.32,33 Since physical activity is
associated with healthy weight and moderate weight lossF

particularly long-term weight lossFincreased activity of the
religious may encourage lower body weight.34­36 A religion
viewing the body as sacred may also encourage a healthy
diet: those with more frequent religious practice and
attendance made healthier food choices as measured by
breakfast, green vegetable, and fruit intake.32 Further, certain
denominations, such as Seventh Day Adventists, promote a
vegetarian diet, which has been associated with lower body
weight.37
Religion's relations with body weight has not been
extensively examined. A few studies investigating the
association between religion and health have only used
body mass index (BMI) as a control in multivariate
analysis.12,13 Even fewer studies of religion have considered
body weight and the mechanisms surrounding it as outcome
measures. In two US community samples, denomination
(Protestant vs Catholic) was not associated with obesity,38
although Episcopalians were less obese than Lutherans
in one sample.39 However, it is uncertain whether the
relationship between denomination and body weight was
because of religion, ethnicity, or sampling differences. In
a Dutch sample, men who attended church more than
once a month had a lower BMI than those who attended
church less than once a month,40 but church members
had significantly higher BMIs than nonchurch members
and were more likely to be 20% overweight in a cross-
sectional community sample.41 Analysis of US National data
found that those with more extensive religious practice
tended to be more obese.42 However, the measure of
religious practice in that analysis included predominately
sedentary activities (ie watching religious television) and
thus could have been measuring inactivity more than
religiosity. Given the dearth of research and mixed findings
of studies about religion's relationship with body weight,
this analysis sought to examine religion and body weight in
greater depth.
Given the previous literature finding that religion is
associated with better physical health11­14 and overweight
is associated with poor health,7,8,1 we hypothesized that
greater religiosity (religious practice, application, social
support, identity, and commitment) is related to lower body
weight, with psychosocial and health behaviors as media-
tors. We did not hypothesize religious denomination's
relationship with body weight because the literature regard-
ing religious denomination's connection with body weight is
unclear. Demographic antecedents were hypothesized to
influence, but not fully determine, the relationship between
religion and weight. These hypotheses were examined in a
US national data set.
Methods
Data
Data from the National Survey of Midlife Development in
the United States (MIDUS) were analyzed. A cross-sectional
study conducted in 1995, MIDUS consisted of two parts: a
telephone survey and a mailed questionnaire. Households
were selected with random digit dialing and then one
adult per household was randomly selected. The sample
was nationally representative of the English-speaking,
noninstitutionalized US population ages 25­74 with tele-
phones.
The MIDUS telephone interview lasted approximately
40 min, and those respondents were subsequently mailed a
written questionnaire. The response rate for completing both
parts of the survey was 61%, producing 3032 respondents.
Missing values for the religion variables were treated as
missing for the current analysis.
Independent variables
Religion is a complex, multidimensional construct, and
there is not a consensus about how religion should be
conceptualized and measured. Prior literature43,44 and
relevance to the study's hypotheses were considered in
deciding how religion was conceptualized in the present
study. The religion items in the MIDUS data were grouped
into six categories: denomination, practice/attendance,
application, identification, subjective commitment/impor-
tance, and religious social support.
Denomination questions asked respondents what their
religious preference was, and for this analysis the denomina-
tions were collapsed to maximize a meaningful interpreta-
tion of denomination's possible relationship with body
weight. Given the considerations of previous research-
ers,45,46 religious denomination for this analysis was grouped
into six categories: Catholic, Conservative Protestant, Main-
line Protestant, Jew, Other, and No Religious Preference.
Religious Practice is a standard component of religiosity
that is often analyzed.43,47 MIDUS respondents were asked to
choose from five categories describing how often they attend
religious or spiritual services, with higher scores indicating
greater religious practice.
Religious Application was assessed by asking respondents
how often they asked themselves what their religious or
spiritual beliefs suggest they should do in making daily life
decisions, with higher scores indicating stronger religious
application.
Religious Social Support was assessed through the ques-
tion, `How often do you seek religious comfort', with four
response categories ranging from `never' to `often'.
Religious Identity (a ¼ 0.84) was a continuous multi-item
measure constructed from four single-item categorical vari-
ables. An example of these questions is, `How important do
you think it is for people of your religion to marry other
people who are the same religion.' Higher scores indicated
stronger religious identity.
Religious Commitment (a ¼ 0.88) was a sum of four
questions about how religious and spiritual respondents
considered themselves, and how important they considered
religion and spirituality to be in their lives. Higher scores
indicated greater commitment.

Dependent variable
Weight and height were self-reported in the questionnaire
and used to calculate BMI. The accuracy of self-reported
weight and height is generally seen as adequate for survey
research.48­50 Excluding the cases with missing values and
implausible outliers, the total BMI sample size available for
the weighted analysis was 2882.
Body weight was also conceptualized as weight categories,
where overweight was signified by a BMI greater than
25, and obese as a BMI of greater than 30.1 The
category `underweight' (BMI of less than 18.5) was not
analyzed because there were too few cases (36 women and 5
men) to offer sufficient statistical power for a separate
analysis.
Demographic variables
Demographics of gender, age, socioeconomic status, race/
ethnicity, marital status, region, and geographic density were
assessed.51 Using the mean income of gender, marital status,
education, age, employment, and race, missing values for
income were imputed.52,53 Cases where income was imputed
were not significantly related to BMI.
Health behavior variables
Physical activity was assessed through two continuous scales:
moderate (a ¼ 0.86) and vigorous activity (a ¼ 0.86). Self-
reported activity has been found to correlate highly with
direct measures of activity.54,55
Drinking was assessed through a six category variable as
number of drinks per month, whereas smoking was assessed
as `smoking now' or `not regularly smoking now'. Self-
reported alcohol consumption and smoking status are
considered to be adequately reliable and valid for epidemio-
logical analyses.56­59
Psychosocial variables
Perceived social support was assessed by two scales:
Family (a ¼ 0.79) and friends (a ¼ 0.86). Each continuous
scale was created by summing five questions, for example,
`How much do members of your family (friends) really
care about you?' Higher scale values indicated greater
support. If respondents answered at least 60% of the family
or friends support scales, the remaining items of each scale
were imputed using the mean value of gender, age, and
marriage.52
Perceived stress was measured in four domains:
work stress, home stress, financial stress, and number of
stressors. Each continuous index was constructed to indicate
the extent to which respondents perceived high stress.60
Perceived stress questions included, `Did you have
any serious ongoing problems getting along with some-
one at work', `At home, how often do they have too
many demands made of you,' and `How difficult is it for
you (and your family) to pay your monthly bills?' The
work, home, and financial indexes were then added to
form a total stress index, with a higher score indicating
greater perceived stress. To measure the number of stressors,
respondents were asked whether they themselves or mem-
bers of their families experienced problems in the last year,
including chronic disease, frequent minor illnesses, and
emotional problems.
Social selection vs social causation: size discrimination
analysis
Relations between religion and weight may involve bidirec-
tional causality.61,62 Social causation may occur when
religious involvement influences weight through religious
activities and beliefs that are a part of peoples' lives.
Alternatively, social selection may occur when weight shapes
religious involvement where people who are fatter or thinner
are differentially included or excluded in religious organiza-
tions and activities. To consider the direction of causality
between religion and body weight, differential participation
of individuals in religious groups and activities was exam-
ined by testing whether people who report experiencing
discrimination on the basis of their weight or height were
more or less religious.
Analyses
Frequencies were examined for all variables, then multiple
regression using PROC SURVEYREG from SAS 8.2 was
conducted to test religion's relation with BMI. Since the
etiology of body weight differs greatly between men and
women,63 separate regressions were conducted by gender.
Sampling weights were used in all regression analyses to
provide nationally representative results.64
A series of regression models were run to test the relations
between religion and weight. Religion variables were each
entered separately in assessing their relation to BMI because
the complex nature of religion is such that different
dimensions of religion have different pathways in their
effects on health.23,65 BMI was regressed on the demographic
variables to account for demographic variation in BMI. Then,
controlling for demographics, BMI was regressed on religion
variables in Model 1. To test the role of health behaviors as a
mediator between religion and BMI, health behaviors were
added in Model 2. In Model 3, psychosocial variables were
added to the religionFBMI model to examine their
potential roles as mediators. Model 4 examined religion's
relation with BMI after taking into account demographics,
health behaviors, and psychosocial factors.
Logistic regressions using PROC LOGISTIC were also
conducted for all models with the categorical variables of
overweight and obesity. Demographics were controlled in all
logistic regression analyses.

Results
Frequencies
Slightly more women than men were in the sample, the
average age for both women and men was 47, and the
majority of the sample was white (Table 1). Over half of the
women and men had at least some college education, with
men more likely to have a college education. Women's
reported average household annual income was over
$40 000, and men's was over $50 000. Most of the sample
was married, and represented the different regions of the
United States. About a third of respondents were from large
Metropolitan Areas. The sample represented the US popula-
tion with the exception of education and income, which
were higher than the 1995 national average.66
Most of the sample was either Catholic or Protestant, and a
slightly greater proportion of men than women specified
their religious preference to be either agnostic, atheist, or of
no religious preference. Women reported an overall greater

religiosity than men, especially in the religious social
support item and the importance of religiosity and spiri-
tuality items.
Over half of the men (56%) reported drinking alcohol
more than three drinks a week, compared to only 25% of
women. Nearly, a quarter of the sample currently smoked.
On average, MIDUS respondents reported engaging in
relatively low moderate activity, with women reporting
greater moderate and vigorous activity levels than men.
The sample reported higher levels of vigorous activity than
moderate activity.
Women reported higher friend and family support com-
pared to men. Although the total stress levels between men
and women were comparable, women reported a higher
number of stressors. The mean BMI for both women and
men was 27, and nearly 60% of the sample was classified as
either overweight or obese.
Regression analyses
When BMI was regressed on the demographic variables of
age, race, education, income, marital status, city size, and
region, the results for women and men were consistent with
those found in the existing social epidemiology of obesity
literature.10,51
Controlling for demographics, the religion variables were
then included in regression models as the independent
variable, with BMI as the continuous dependent variable
(Model 1). For men, a significant relationship of BMI with
denomination existed, with Conservative Protestants and
Mainline Protestants having higher BMIs than those indicat-
ing no religious preference, agnosticism, or atheism. Con-
servative Protestant men were about 1.13 BMI units (B5 lb)
heavier than the reference group of no religious preference,
whereas Mainline Protestants were 0.93 BMI units heavier
compared to the reference group (Model 1 of Table 2). There
were also significant relationships of BMI with Religious
Social Support (0.27), Religious Application (0.26), and
Religious Identity (0.11), with more religious men reporting
higher BMIs. For women, no significant relationships of
religious variables to BMI were present (Model 1 of Table 3).
To examine possible mediating effects of health behaviors
in the relationship between religion and BMI in men,
drinking, smoking, and activity were included in regression
models (Model 2 of Table 2). With the addition of health
behaviors, the relationship between the denomination of
Mainline Protestant and BMI was no longer significant for
men, whereas the association between the denomination of
Conservative Protestant and BMI remained significant,
although it decreased in strength (Model 2 of Table 2). With
these health behavioral mediators, the relationships of
Religious Social Support and Religious Application to body
weight became nonsignificant for men, whereas Religious
Identity's relationship with BMI remained relatively un-
changed. In partitioning out how each individual health
behavior affected religion's relationship with BMI for men,
adding smoking alone to the model resulted in the decreased
magnitude and nonsignificance of the religion variables in
their relation to BMI, whereas the other health behavior
variables had little influence when entered alone.
The psychosocial variables of social support and stress were
also examined as potential mediators (Model 3). For men,
adding psychosocial measures appeared to magnify religion's
relationship with BMI, either increasing the magnitude of
the effects or making some formerly not significant terms
significant. The relationship of BMI to religious attendance,
religious commitment, and the denomination of Catholi-
cism became significant for men, whereas the relationship of
body weight to the denomination of Conservative Protestant
increased the relationships in magnitude and significance
(Model 3 of Table 2). Cases where friend social support was
imputed were highly significant (Po0.01).
In the final model (Model 4), demographics, health
behaviors, social support, and stress were included in

examining religion's relation with BMI. Compared to the
model controlling for demographics and health behaviors
for men, including both health behaviors and psychosocial
variables did not significantly change the unstandardized
regression coefficients, although adding the psychosocial
variables slightly attenuated health behaviors' mediating
effects and made religious identity's relationship with BMI
not significant (Model 4 of Table 2). The denomination of
Conservative Protestant remained significantly related to
BMI in these models for men. The mean BMI of Jewish men
compared to men of no religious preference was high,
although not significantly different.
To examine whether religion's relationship with higher
BMI among men was associated with overweight or obesity,
logistic regressions using PROC LOGIT were conducted, with
overweight vs others and obesity vs others as the outcomes.
No significant relationships were present for any of the
models for overweight and obesity, suggesting that religion
variable relationships exist for average weight for the whole
population, not just making some people more extreme in
body weight. Similarly, there were no significant associations
between religion variables and overweight or obesity for
women.
Social selection vs social causation analysis
To address the direction of causality in the religion­body
weight relation, bivariate and multivariate logistic analyses
were conducted with the height­weight discrimination
variable as the dependent variable and the religion items as
the independent variables. The multivariate analysis con-
trolled for age, income, race, education, marital status,
region, and city size. The religion variables were each entered
separately in the logistic analysis and all analyses were
conducted separately by gender. If body weight caused
religion, that is, if religion draws in those who are heavier
rather than causes its adherents to become heavier, then
significant differences would be expected to be present. For
both the bivariate and multivariate analyses, none of the
religion variables were significantly related to the height and
weight discrimination question. This suggests that relations
between religion and body weight are primarily religion
influencing weight (social causation) rather than weight
influencing religion (social selection).
Discussion
In this analysis, Conservative Protestant men were approxi-
mately 5 lb heavier than those men indicating no religious
preference after controlling for demographics, health beha-
viors, social support, and stress. Assuming that those
indicating a Conservative Protestant affiliation were more
likely to be members of a church than those indicating no
religious preference, these results are consistent with Lapane
et al's41 conclusions that church members are heavier than
nonchurch members. The lack of statistical significance of
those indicating a Jewish denomination to body weight may
have been because of the small number of Jewish men in the
sample. Further studies need to be conducted to clarify
whether Judaism is associated with body weight in men.
Measures of religion other than denomination were not
associated with body weights of men or women, once health
behaviors were controlled. Unlike Baecke et al40 and
Ferraro,42 no relationship was found between religious
attendance and body weight, although those studies did
not control for health behaviors. In this analysis, other
religiosity measures associated with body weight in men
were reduced by controlling for health behaviors, particu-
larly smoking.
The magnifying effect of the psychosocial variables on the
religion­body weight connection suggests that social sup-

port and stress could operate as moderators.67 However, the
interactions between religion and social support, and
religion and stress were not significant, suggesting that the
psychosocial variables were not moderators in the religion-
body weight relationship.67 Thus, it is not clear how social
support and stress fitFif at allFinto religion's relationship
with body weight. Given that the psychosocial variables did
not substantially change religion's relationship to body
weight, perhaps social support and stress are not important
factors in the religion­body weight connection.
Although the magnitude of religion's relationship with
body weight is small, the significance of the relationship
offers new insight into the etiology of body weight. Given
the cross-sectional nature of this study, the direction of
causality could not be clearly established. However, the
analysis of height­weight discrimination and religiosity
measures supports the hypothesis that religion causes
increased body weight in men.
Several limitations existed in this study. The cross-
sectional design limits conclusions about the direction of
causality.61 Only a longitudinal study could more defini-
tively show that religion causes body weight, although the
social selection vs social causation analysis addressed this
concern to some extent. Missing values and nonresponse
could have biased the results, although the imputation and
weighting attempted to account for those factors. The lack of
a dietary intake measure leaves open the possibility that part
of the unexplained variance attributed to religion could have
been because of diet. The self-report nature of the measures
could have also missed unexplained variance not captured
by the measures because they were not precise enough, that
is, religion's relationship with body weight could have been
because of residual bias from the demographic variables.
However, the magnitude of the denomination coefficient in
men suggests that it is probably not because of residual bias.
Cultural differences may have also interacted with religion
to result in different relations between religion and weight,
although controlling for race reduces that possibility.
Religious individuals could have been more or less truth-
ful68,69 and thus report different body weights than the less
religious. Given that the MIDUS data did not include
veracity measures and the lack of literature examining the
relation between religion and truthfulness, it is unclear to
what extent, if any, validity of self-reported religion and
weight affected these results.
Finding no relation between religion and BMI among
women was surprising, especially given that women are
generally more religious than men.15 However, most surpris-
ing was religion's positive association with higher BMI in
men. Given the abundance of literature showing religion's
positive effect on health status, religion correlating with
better physical health11­15 and greater body weight41,42
appears to be inconsistent, since being overweight is
associated with poorer health.1­3,7,8 Concurrent with our
findings that increased BMI in religious men did not affect
obesity risk, the heavier body weight of the religious may not
be a strong risk factor for poor health. The risk of higher
BMIs among religious men may also be countered by positive
health behaviors, such decreased smoking and drinking,
through religion serving as a social control for better
health.70
How religion is related to greater BMI in men, however,
remains unclear. Perhaps religion, through offering mean-
ing, acts as a stabilizing institution to protect against
extreme underweight and overweight. Future research
examining religious meaning as an independent and
mediating variable in the religion­body weight connection
may more completely delineate how religion is associated
with higher BMI in men.
