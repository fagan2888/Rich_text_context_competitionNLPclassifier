Abstract
Background: Rheumatoid arthritis(RA) is a chronic inflammatory,
autoimmune polyarthritis, with a prevalence estimated at one per-
cent of the United States(US) population. Serum bilirubin, because
of its antioxidant nature, has been conjectured to exert an anti-in-
flammatory biologic effect. The objective of this study is to discern
whether higher serum Total Bilirubin(TBili) levels are protective
against RA.
Methods: This is a secondary analysis of National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) data collected between
2003-2006. Study participants completed a comprehensive ques-
tionnaire regarding their health history, underwent a physical ex-
amination, and had body fluids collected for laboratory studies. In
NHANES, to assess for the presence of RA, the following questions
were asked: "Doctor ever said you had arthritis?" If so, "Which
type of arthritis". Statistical analysis was performed, using SAS
version 9.1, proc survey methods. Participant data were adjusted
for demographic characteristics as well as risk factors for RA.
Results: NHANES 2003-2006 included 20,470 individuals, chosen
as a representative sampling of the entire US population. Exclu-
sion criteria included age less than twenty years or liver dysfunc-
tion, defined as history of abnormal liver function tests or liver dis-
ease. 8,147 subjects did not have any exclusion criteria and were
included in the data analysis. RA is inversely related to the serum
level of TBili with an odds ratio of 0.679 (95% CI 0.533-0.865)
and remained significant even after adjusting for age, gender, race,
education, and tobacco history, with an odds ratio 0.749 (95% CI
0.575 - 0.976).
  
Conclusions: Our study supports the hypothesis that higher TBili
levels are protective against RA. A plausible mechanism for this
association would be that the anti-oxidant effects of TBili exert a
physiologic anti-inflammatory effect, which provides protection
against RA. This explanation is supported by prior studies which
show that higher TBili levels are protective against stroke, athero-
sclerosis, and vasculitis. Further studies are needed to delineate the
exact nature of the protective properties of TBili.

Introduction
Despite great advances in drug development for Rheumatoid
Arthritis (RA), a large number of patients still tend to rely
on alternative treatments such as antioxidant therapy and
diet, suggesting that their RA is still not being adequately
controlled. New therapeutic approaches targeting the un-
derlying, pathologic inflammation in novel ways have the
potential to bridge this therapeutic gap. In delineating the
etiologies of inflammation in RA, the generation of reactive
oxygen and nitrogen species has been shown to be critical
to the genesis of this disease [1, 2]. Thus, modalities that
decrease production of reactive, oxidative, inflammatory
molecules would have direct disease modifying effects. One
approach that has shown potential is vitamin supplementa-
tion, such as with Vitamin E [3-5]. However, the literature
remains unclear as to whether this theoretical benefit trans-
lates into clinical improvement in RA patients.
Total Bilirubin (TBili) has been studied as a chemical
with similar, anti-oxidant properties. Unlike with Vitamin
E, a growing body of data exists to show that its anti-inflam-
matory properties do translate into decreased human morbid-
ity [6, 7]. Indeed, literature shows that higher TBili levels
correlate with a reduced risk of stroke, atherosclerosis, renal
perfusion injuries, and angiotensin-mediated hypertension
[8-13]. Despite this robust body of literature showing the
benefits of higher TBili levels in varied inflammation-related
morbidities, no literature exists investigating how higher
TBili levels impact RA.

Methods
Survey design
The NHANES survey is a continuous assessment of health
and nutrition conducted by the Centers for Disease Control
and Prevention (CDC) and its subsidiary, the National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS). Findings from this survey are
utilized to determine the prevalence of major diseases and
their risk factors. The NHANES survey consists of house-
hold interviews, physical and dental evaluations, and body
fluid collections, such as blood and urine, of a representa-
tive sample of the non-institutionalized, United States popu-
lation, using a complex, stratified, multistage probability
cluster survey design. Older individuals, children, Mexican
Americans, and African Americans are purposefully over-
represented to insure a pre-specified minimum sample size.
Sampling weights are used to adjust the cohort distribution
so that it more closely models the US population. Between
2003 and 2006, 20,470 subjects participated in the NHANES
survey process. Those individuals less than 20 years old or
with liver disease were excluded from data analysis. A to-
tal of 8,147 subjects did not meet any exclusion criteria and
were included in data analysis.
Laboratory methods
Serum samples were collected and analyzed in a standard-
ized manner from fasting individuals as described in the
White Sands Clinical Laboratory's Collection Procedures
and Specimen Requirements Manual 8. Blood drawn from
the examinee's arm was processed and stored on dry ice at
-70°C. The analyses were performed with a Beckman Syn-
chron LX20. The serum TBili concentration was assayed us-
ing a timed-endpoint diazo method. This chemical assay is
predicated on bilirubin reacting with the diazo reagent, in
the presence of caffeine, benzoate, and acetate as accelera-
tors to form azobilirubin. The assay measurement instrument
detects changes in light absorbance, at 520 nm wavelength,
after the chemical reaction has progressed for a fixed time
interval.
Definition of variables
NHANES survey interviewers completed an extensive two-
week training course prior to conducting interviews. A large
percentage of the interview is conducted in both English and
Spanish. RA was defined based on the subject's response
to the following questions: `Have you ever been told by a

doctor that you had arthritis?' and `What type of arthritis?'
Liver disease was defined based on a subject's response to
the question `Have you had liver disease?' Participants who
answered `yes'to the question regarding liver disease or who
had AST values greater than 50 ng/ml on serum studies, or
ALT values greater than 50 ng/ml on serum studies, were
excluded from data analysis. Other co-variables included
were self-reported age, gender, race/ethnicity, smoking sta-
tus, education status, and marital status. BMI was calculated
from height and weight measurements, and placed into 3 cat-
egories based on the CDC criteria of normal (less than 25),
overweight (25 - 29.9) and obese (greater than 30).
Statistical analysis
NHANES uses a complex, stratified, multi-state probability-
cluster sampling survey design. Due to the complexity of
this survey's design, we used SAS version 9.1's (Cary, NC)
PROCSURVEY methodology. A Jackknife Replacement
method was used to estimate the sample variance. Logistic
regression models were created to look at the unadjusted
association between RA and the TBili. Adjusted regression
models, using the variables age, gender, race, marital status,
education, smoking and BMI, were also derived.
Results
Our analysis showed the data to be normally-distributed,
with a right tail (Fig. 1). The mean TBili level was 11.99
micromoles per liter with a standard deviation of 5.28.
Based on prior studies investigating the disease preven-
tative effects of TBili, our analysis stratified TBili levels as
either less than or greater than 11 micromoles per liter [11].
The demographic characteristics of these two groups were
then compared (Table 1). With respect to the age-adjusted
prevalence, males had higher TBili levels while females
tended to have levels less than 11 micromoles per liter.
Among participants with a BMI less than 30, a higher pro-
portion of subjects had higher TBili levels.
With respect to RA, a greater proportion of subjects who
did not report any history of RA had a TBili above 11 mi-
cromoles per liter (55.93% with SE of 0.92). Although there
was a trend toward more patients in the RA stratification also
having lower TBili levels (less than 11 micromoles per li-
ter), it did not reach statistical significance. However, a sta-
tistically-significant, unadjusted association between higher
TBili levels and RA did exist (OR 0.68, 95% CI 0.53 - 0.87).
The relationship remained statistically significant after ad-
justing for age, sex, race, married status, education (Fig. 2),
BMI and smoking (OR 0.75, 95% CI 0.58 - 0.98).
Discussion
Previous studies have suggested that the antioxidant proper-
ties of TBili have disease preventative effects with respect to
stroke, coronary artery disease and peripheral vascular dis-
ease [8-11]. In this study, we found that this inverse relation
between higher TBili levels and disease prevalence extends
to RA as well.
The exact nature of this protective effect is not clear. We
do know that the inflammation inherent to RA results from
immunological reactions involving the activation of granu-
locytes, macrophages and lymphocytes [1]. These inflam-
matory cells, in the synovial fluid, are in an activated state,
releasing oxygen-derived free radicals that are lethal to the
joint tissue [2]. One possibility for the protective effect of
TBili with regard to RA risk suggests that Bilirubin clears
peroxyl radicals, decreases oxidative stress and by binding
to serum albumin can prevent in-vitro oxidation of albumin-
bound fatty acids [13-15].
Furthermore, unconjugated Bilirubin and Biliverdin
have been shown to exhibit immune protective effects on
murine liver and cardiac grafts. In the case of Biliverdin, this
effect has been shown to be mediated by suppression of IL-2
production, via inhibition of nuclear factor. Recent research
has shown that intracellular redox cycling of bilirubin to
biliverdin, a metabolite of bilirubin, may be important for
cytoprotection [3].
In reviewing the strengths and weaknesses of this study,
this study's large sample size would lend itself to increased
resolution of small differences in the groups studied. Fur-
thermore, use of data from NHANES facilitates investiga-
tion of the interaction among multiple co-variables and its
study design facilitates generalization to the US population,
as a whole. Since our analysis is based on data derived from
a survey, there will be an inherent inability to determine tem-
poral association of higher TBili levels and RA. In addition,
this study is limited by the survey participants self-report

of RA, possibly leading to inaccurate estimates of disease
prevalence based on participant misconceptions regarding
their level of health. The laboratory analysis of participant
blood did not include fractionation of bilirubin levels. Thus,
it is not possible to discern whether the anti-oxidant effects
of TBili are a combined phenomenon versus the sole effect
of Indirect or Direct Bilirubin.
In conclusion, higher serum TBili levels are negatively
associated with RA. These findings introduce the possibil-
ity of a therapeutic role of bilirubin as an anti-inflammatory
agent, alongside pharmacotherapy, to reduce the process of
joint destruction. Further studies, particularly cohort stud-
ies, are needed to confirm this association and to investigate
approaches to manipulate the TBili level for the patient's
benefit.
