Abstract
Background: Reducing salt intake has been proposed to prevent cardiovascular disease in India. We sought to determine
whether salt reductions would be beneficial or feasible, given the worry that unrealistically large reductions would be
required, worsening iodine deficiency and benefiting only urban subpopulations.
Methods and Results: Future myocardial infarctions (MI) and strokes in India were predicted with a Markov model
simulating men and women aged 40 to 69 in both urban and rural locations, incorporating the risk reduction from lower
salt intake. If salt intake does not change, we expect ,8.3 million MIs (95% CI: 6.9­9.6 million), 830,000 strokes (690,000­
960,000) and 2.0 million associated deaths (1.5­2.4 million) per year among Indian adults aged 40 to 69 over the next three
decades. Reducing intake by 3 g/day over 30 years (20.1 g/year, 25% reduction) would reduce annual MIs by 350,000 (a
4.6% reduction; 95% CI: 320,000­380,000), strokes by 48,000 (26.5%; 13,000­83,000) and deaths by 81,000 (24.9%; 59,000­
100,000) among this group. The largest decline in MIs would be among younger urban men, but the greatest number of
averted strokes would be among rural men, and nearly one-third of averted strokes and one-fifth of averted MIs would be
among rural women. Only under a highly pessimistic scenario would iodine deficiency increase (by ,0.0001%, ,1600
persons), since inadequate iodized salt access--not low intake of iodized salt--is the major cause of deficiency and would
be unaffected by dietary salt reduction.
Conclusions: Modest reductions in salt intake could substantially reduce cardiovascular disease throughout India.

Introduction
Ischaemic heart disease (IHD) and stroke are leading causes of
death in India, and hypertension is thought to be their main risk
factor [1]. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that
nearly half of these deaths occur among adults aged 30 to 69 years
old [2]. The prevalence of hypertension has risen exponentially in
India over the past three decades, from less than 5% of adults to
over 25% of urban and 10% of rural adults today [3].
High salt intake is associated with increased risk of myocardial
infarction (MI) and stroke [4], principally because salt intake
significantly affects blood pressure [5,6]. Although the WHO
recommends that adults consume less than 5 grams (g) of salt per
day in order to reduce hypertension-associated cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular disease, Indian adults consume between 8.5 g and
15 g per day on average [7,8] (as compared to an average 8.9 g
per day among Americans [9]).
Several Western countries including the UK and Finland have
implemented regulations on salt content in food, experiencing
associated declines in per capita salt intake and heart attacks,
strokes and deaths [10,11,12]. Whether and how to reduce India's
high level of dietary salt intake is currently being debated [13].
Several commentators have suggested that the reductions in salt
intake necessary for lowering cardiovascular mortality in develop-
ing countries like India are unrealistically large, that benefits would
accrue only among urban populations exposed to Western diets,
and that the rural poor would experience higher disease rates
related to iodine deficiency because of inadequate intake of iodized
salt [14,15,16,17].
To explore these assertions, we constructed a mathematical
model of MI and stroke in India.
Methods
We constructed a Markov (state-transition) model of MI and
stroke among India's population following conventional standards
for decision-analytic modeling [18]. The detailed model is
specified in Text S1 to permit full replication of our results; here,
we outline the general structure, critical assumptions and
validation of the model.

Model structure
The model simulates Indian adults organized into twelve
cohorts, defined by gender, age (grouped into 40­49, 50­59,
and 60­69 year old cohorts) and location (urban versus rural) from
1998 to 2050. The age groups were limited to 40 through 69 years
old because consistent prospective data from multiple Indian
studies were available from which to estimate MI and stroke risk
among Indian populations in these age groups [19,20]. We used
an ``open cohort'' approach, meaning that aging was explicitly
simulated between the age groups; new entries into the 40­49 year
old age class were incorporated into every time step of the
simulation, based on Indian census projections (Figure S1) [21].
Urban-rural migration was not specifically modeled with a
separate variable, but inferred from the Census estimates.
In each monthly time step of the model, an individual can be in
one of seven possible states, as depicted in Figure 1: a state with no
history of IHD or stroke; a state of having had an acute MI during
that month; a state of having had an acute stroke during that
month; a state of having survived a MI; a state of having survived a
stroke; a state of having died from either an MI or a stroke; and a
state of having died from a non-MI/non-stroke event.
Data sources for transition probabilities
As detailed below, the impact of reduced salt on reduced blood
pressure, and reduced blood pressure on the relative risk of MI
and stroke, were taken from international sources; the baseline risk
of MI and stroke as well as estimates of blood pressure in each
cohort were obtained from India-specific sources (see Table 1 for
parameters, data and sources). Monthly risks of MI and stroke
among each cohort were taken from a WHO analysis of estimates
among Indian adults, organized by age, gender and urban versus
rural location (Table S1) [22]. We incorporated the time-trend in
these risks (Table S2), to account for how rates of MI and stroke
are changing among the population.
The risk of recurrent MI/stroke and death from acute MI/
stroke among each cohort was also adopted from the WHO
analysis (Tables S1, S2 and S3) [22]. The risk of death from non-
MI/non-stroke causes was incorporated in the model using a
standard competing risks algorithm [23], which applies cause-
specific mortality rates (Table S4) and time-trends in non-MI/non-
stroke deaths (Table S5) from the WHO to each cohort in the
model [24]. To ensure face validity of the model results, we
compared the model's disease-specific mortality estimates against
independent estimates of mortality that had not been used as input
data sources (Figure S2).
Salt reduction simulations and underlying assumptions
To simulate the impact of salt reduction, we performed a two-
stage calculation: first, given a particular hypothetical level of
reduction in salt intake, we estimated how much blood pressure
would be reduced (assuming a continuous linear relationship
between salt reduction and blood pressure reduction, as in prior
models, [25,26]); then we estimated how much the relative risk of
incident MI and stroke would be reduced by this reduction in
blood pressure. We used the most conservative multi-country
meta-analysis data available to estimate the reduction in systolic
blood pressure from salt reduction [27]; this corresponds to a
reduction of 3.6 mmHg in systolic pressure (95% CI: 2.8 to 4.4)
among hypertensive persons and 1.8 mmHg (95%CI: 1.0 to 2.6)
among normotensive persons from a 3 g/day decline in dietary
salt intake. Blood pressure among each Indian cohort was taken
from the WHO SAGE study [28], a nationally-representative
household survey in which blood pressure was established by
examination, using the average of three readings (Table S6). The
Smith-Spangler equations were then used to estimate the age-
Figure 1. Model diagram. Health states are further divided into age-, gender- and location-specific (urban and rural) submodels. Deaths from non-
cardiovascular events are calculated from each compartment of the model at each time point in the simulation (not drawn). The transition
probabilities between health states in the model are detailed in Tables S1, S2 and S3. Dietary salt reduction in the model lowers the risk of incident
and recurrent myocardial infarction and stroke events. MI: myocardial infarction.

specific relative risk reduction for incident MI and stroke from
each millimeter mercury reduction in systolic pressure [26]; these
equations (see Text S1) provide estimates of relative risk from a
multi-national meta-analysis [19]. Based on a prior review [29],
we simulated that stroke risk reduction would be achieved
gradually at a linear rate over three years, while for myocardial
infarctions, two-thirds of the benefit would occur at a linear rate
over the first three years and the rest would occur at a linear rate
over the subsequent seven years.
We considered a reduction in per capita salt intake of 3 g/
person/day achieved over 30 years (at a linear rate of 20.1 g/year
from the year 2013 through 2043). As described in Box S1, we
additionally ran the model under varying assumptions and
analyzed the risk of iodine deficiency associated with dietary salt
reduction. We conducted further multivariate uncertainty analyses
to produce confidence intervals around our model's results via
10,000 simulations in each scenario (Box S1), and varied the salt
reduction from 1 g to 4 g (Text S1).
Results
Without changes to current levels of dietary salt intake, our
model projects that Indians in the 40 to 69 year old age group will
experience an annual rate of approximately 8.3 million new and
recurrent myocardial infarctions (95% CI: 6.9­9.6 million),
830,000 new and recurrent strokes (95% CI: 690,000­960,000)
and 2.0 million deaths (95%CI: 1.5­2.4 million) from either cause
on average during each of the next 30 years.
A population-wide reduction in dietary salt intake of 3 g/day
achieved over 30 years (at a linear rate of 0.1 g/year, the rate
achieved in Finland) is projected to reduce the rate of MI by about
14.6 per 10,000 (from 196.9 to 182.3 per 10,000), stroke by 2.1 per
10,000 (from 19.4 to 17.3 per 10,000), and deaths from either
cause by 3.4 per 10,000 (from 47.3 to 43.9 per 10,000; Table 2).
Given the projected population size of India, this amounts to
preventing an annual average of approximately 350,000 MIs
(95% CI: 320,000­380,000), 48,000 strokes (95% CI: 13,000­
83,000), and 81,000 deaths (95% CI: 59,000­100,000). A lesser
reduction of 1 g/day of dietary salt intake achieved over 30 years
is projected to avert approximately 120,000 MIs (95% CI:
110,000­130,000), 16,000 strokes (95% CI: 4,500­28,000) and
27,000 deaths (95% CI: 20,000­35,000) annually, while a greater
reduction to 4 g/day achieved over the same 30 year duration is
expected to prevent about 460,000 MIs (95% CI: 430,000­
500,000), 64,000 strokes (95% CI: 17,000­110,000) and 110,000
deaths (95% CI: 78,000­140,000) annually.
Both sexes and persons in both urban and rural zones were
likely to benefit from reductions in salt intake according to our
model (Figure 2). However, the anticipated benefits were largest
among young urban men. Urban men in the 40 to 49 year old age
cohort experienced the greatest reduction in the rate of MI
(28.8%+/21.4%), stroke (212.3%+/22.0%) and overall deaths
(28.8%+/22.0). However, the percentage decline in MIs, strokes
and deaths among all cohorts was within 3% of the changes
among this young urban male cohort (Table 2), such that all
groups received at least a 6.6% decline in events, and the overall
population reduction in MIs was 7.6% (+/21.3%), in strokes was
10.7% (+/21.8%) and in deaths was 7.9% (+/21.7%).
To determine the actual number of averted events in each
group, these percentage declines must be weighted by the absolute
rate of events and the relative population sizes of each cohort.
When accounting for population size projections and the absolute
risk of events in each cohort, the largest number of MIs prevented
in India would be among urban men in the 50­59 year cohort
(96,000 MIs averted per year, +/216,000); this group would also
experience the greatest number of averted deaths (22,000 deaths
averted per year, +/25,000). The greatest number of strokes
averted would be among rural men in the 60­69 year age cohort
(6,800 strokes averted per year, +/21,100).
Overall, rural populations accounted for 27% of averted MIs
(+/24.3%), 57% of averted strokes (+/29.5%), and 32% of
averted deaths from MI or stroke (+/27.6%, Figure 2). Women
constituted 37% of averted MIs (+/26.1%), 53% of averted
strokes (+/28.7%) and 23% of averted deaths (+/25.4%). More
strokes and overall deaths per year were averted among rural than
among urban women (4,600+/2750 strokes and 3,000+/2660
deaths among rural women versus 3,100+/2510 strokes and
2,500+/2560 deaths among urban women), while more MIs per
year were averted among urban women than among rural women
(24,000+/24,000 MIs among urban women versus 21,000+/
23,300 among rural women). As shown in Figure S4, the number
of MIs and strokes averted per year increased among all
populations with every additional year of the simulation,
suggesting that benefits accrue over a long time course.
Iodine deficiency
Under a highly-pessimistic set of assumptions (Box S1), a
reduction in dietary salt intake of 3 grams would be anticipated to
produce at most 1,600 new cases of iodine deficiency (defined as
any low level of blood iodine) that would otherwise be averted
(95% CI: 660­2,300) which would correspond to a ,0.0001% rise
in iodine deficiency based on current estimates from India [30].

The worst-affected province would be Andra Pradesh, experienc-
ing 95% of those excess cases (1500; 95% CI: 650­2,200) because
more than any other state, a substantive portion of the population
receives salt iodized at low levels of iodine per gram of salt (Figure
S3), such that the dietary salt reduction program could reduce
overall iodine intake from just above required levels to just below
required levels among some populations in that province.
Sensitivity Analyses
If lowering hypertensive blood pressures through reduced salt
intake is not as beneficial as having always maintained a lower
blood pressure (see Box S1 for relative risk change), the expected
health benefits of salt reduction would be decreased by approx-
imately 15% (Table 2). If salt reduction produced greater blood
pressure reduction for each gram salt reduced (also a relative risk
modification, Box S1), as suggested by some clinical trials showing
greater salt sensitivity among older persons than younger people
[31,32], the predicted systolic blood pressure changes would be
about four times that of the baseline meta-analysis results (e.g., a
55 year old urban man would be predicted to experience a
0.8 mmHg decline in systolic pressure in the baseline scenario for
each 1gram salt reduction, but a 3.3 mmHg decline in this
optimistic scenario), and the benefits of salt reduction in the model
correspondingly would increase by approximately a factor of four
over the baseline simulation (Table 2). Additional sensitivity
analyses involving only a 1 g/day salt reduction, or as much as a
4 g/day salt reduction over 30 years were also performed, and
showed essentially linear changes to MI and stroke deaths (Tables
S8 and S9 and Figures S5 and S6).
Discussion
Using a mathematical model of dietary salt intake, blood
pressure and subsequent MI and stroke events in India, we found
that dietary salt reduction of 3 grams over 30 years would be
anticipated to avert nearly 400,000 cases and about 81,000 deaths
from MI and stroke in India. These reductions correspond to
between 6.6% and 12.3% reductions in the rate of MIs and strokes
among different subpopulations of the country, averting between
6.7% and 8.8% of MI and stroke-related deaths. Males, and urban
men of working age in particular, would experience the greatest
predicted benefits from dietary salt reduction. However, the
benefits would accrue across both men and women, in both urban
and rural populations. Over half of strokes, for example, would be
averted among women, and one out of every three deaths averted
would be among rural populations. Only under highly pessimistic
assumptions would salt reduction at these levels increase risks of
iodine deficiency by ,0.001% percentage point, corresponding to
about 200 new cases of iodine deficiency (95% CI: 120­273).
Before analyzing the policy implications of these findings, we
must note several important limitations. First, we simulated the
effects of salt reduction on blood pressure using the most
conservative meta-analysis results available to date. These studies
mostly derive from Western nations, but Intersalt and related
studies suggest that the relationships between salt and blood
pressure, and between blood pressure and cardiovascular disease
are universal among humans [19,27,33]. However, there have
been some studies suggesting that individuals in South Asian
communities might be genetically predisposed to hypertension and
various cardiovascular diseases [34,35]. Although salt intake will
likely benefit these individuals, it remains unclear if these persons
will see a similar reduction in hypertension and the associated risks
as the rest of the population; this is a limitation of our predictions.

pressure level [42].
**While the baseline simulation implements the results of a meta-analysis that does not reveal greater salt sensitivity among the elderly [27], we also simulated the case
in which each gram reduction in salt intake leads to a greater reduction in blood pressure among older cohorts, as per some clinical trials [31,32], in which the change in
systolic pressure = 20.0598 * (mmol salt reduction)20.0431 * (age-48)) (see Text S1) [26].

Second, we assumed that the impact of salt reduction on
cardiovascular disease was linear and entirely mediated by the
relationship between salt and blood pressure, although some
experts have argued that additional mechanisms may contribute to
further mortality benefits [36] and that the salt-hypertension
relationship may be non-linear [31,37] in a direction that would
render our results conservative. Additionally, in the UK, a 0.9 g/
day reduction in salt intake was achieved over 4 years (,0.225 g/
day per capita per year) [12,38]--more than twice as large as our
modeling approach based on the Finnish North Karelia experi-
ence, further suggesting that our baseline model scenario may be
conservative. Fourth, we focused on the 40 to 69 year old groups

given the higher reliability of data available for this age range from
India, the rise of hypertension among young males may indicate
benefit in other age cohorts [2]. Fifth, we did not explicitly
simulate migration but rather inferred migratory effects using
Indian Census data; this may limit the applicability of our
model in future years when migration patterns may change.
Finally, we did not assess ages beyond 40 to 69 years old, or
additional diseases related to hypertension such as renal
disease or gastric cancer.
Our model produced estimates of benefit consistent with models
of salt reduction in Western countries [25,26], suggesting robust
findings among independent researchers and alternative models.
Our model contributes significant new information in that it
directly incorporates new data from a key developing country to
investigate whether salt reduction would accrue benefits outside of
urban populations eating Western diets, and whether perverse
outcomes are likely to occur. We included time-trends in MI/
stroke risk as well as in mortality rates from other diseases (Table
S2), to account for the rapid change in disease risk over time as
infectious disease rates decline and chronic disease rates rise. Our
results are highly relevant to other countries, as similar rates of salt
intake and associated hypertension have been reported in China,
Colombia and Mexico [39]. Given that hypertension has now
become the leading modifiable risk factor for death in the world
[40], India's path to controlling salt intake may define a paradigm
for rapidly-developing countries.
However, the projected benefits in our model were smaller than
one older analysis of salt intake [41], in part because we relied on a
more recent meta-analysis [27] estimating a more limited benefit
of salt reduction (the older analysis used more optimistic studies
conducted prior to 1991) [42]. The older study also lacked
population-representative hypertension data, requiring the authors
to extrapolate data from a small single-locale survey to the entire
South Asian region; we were fortunate to access the WHO SAGE
study to reflect population-representative levels of blood pressure
and associated risk in both urban and rural regions, stratified by
age and gender [43].
Potential unintended consequences, like iodine deficiency, were
found to be very small, even under a worst-case scenario
assuming extremely high iodine requirements and low levels of
iodine intake. Most iodine deficiency in India occurs in areas
without adequate access to iodized salt (not due to inadequate
intake of iodized salt); reductions in salt intake would therefore
not affect the likelihood of iodine deficiency in such areas [44]. In
some regions, however, salt is inadequately iodized, such that
dietary salt reduction could induce new iodine deficiency.
However, we found that because of the minimal amount of
iodine required to meet nutritional needs, dietary salt reduction
programs are unlikely to produce substantial new iodine
deficiency in such regions, consistent with a recent World Health
Organization review [45,46].
How to optimally implement salt reduction initiatives in India
remains unclear. Regulatory interventions such as substituting
potassium for sodium or reducing ``hidden'' sodium in processed
foods may be more effective than educational interventions
[12,17,47]. While concerns have been raised over the economic
impact of regulatory approaches, experience in the UK resulted in
population-wide reduction in dietary salt intake without reduction
in food product sales, problems with food preservation or
consumer complaints about food taste [38]. Further work is being
initiated to gather data to study the cost-effectiveness of alternative
salt reduction approaches [29,39].
Overall, our findings indicate that moderate reductions in
dietary salt intake in India, similar to salt reductions achieved in
Western populations [10], could substantially reduce cardiovas-
cular morbidity and mortality in both genders, among both
middle-aged and older age groups, and among both urban and
rural populations in the country.
