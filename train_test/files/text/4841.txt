Abstract
Objectives: The aims of this study were to investigate the incidence of Kru
¨ppel-like factor 6
(KLF6) protein staining in patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma and examine its potential
relevance to clinicopathological characteristics and tumour cell proliferation.
Methods: Clinicopathological data from patients with cutaneous malignant melanoma were
analysed retrospectively. Presence of KLF6 and the antigen Ki-67 in malignant melanoma and
healthy tissue samples from each patient was detected by immunohistochemistry. The proliferation
index was calculated on the basis of Ki-67 expression. The relationship between KLF6 and
clinicopathological characteristics was also analysed.
Results: KLF6 was detected more frequently in normal healthy skin tissue compared with
cutaneous malignant melanoma lesions (n ¼ 40). There was a negative correlation between the
presence of KLF6 and the proliferation index. The presence of KLF6 was also significantly
correlated with tumour diameter, lymph node metastasis, tumour­node­metastasis stage and
3-year survival rate.
Conclusions: KLF6 protein is downregulated in human cutaneous malignant melanoma lesions
compared with healthy skin tissue. KLF6 may be involved in tumour progression and may be a
tumour suppressor and prognostic marker for cutaneous malignant melanoma.

Introduction
Malignant melanoma originates from
naevus cells and melanocytes; it is associated
with poor prognosis and high mortality due
to its high degree of malignancy, early blood
and lymphatic metastasis and resistance
to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.1

The occurrence, development and metasta-
sis of melanoma are complex and multi-
phased biological processes that are
controlled by many genes.2 Kru
¨ ppel-like
factor 6 (KLF6) is a nuclear transcription
factor that inhibits tumour cell growth,
promotes apoptosis and participates in the
regulation of cell senescence.3 Research has
shown that, consistent with its function as a
tumour suppressor, KLF6 expression is
downregulated or absent in astrocytomas,
and in prostate, liver, colorectal and naso-
pharyngeal cancers.4­8 There are no pub-
lished reports on the role of KLF6 in
malignant melanoma. The present study
aimed to investigate the presence of KLF6
protein in patients with cutaneous malig-
nant melanoma and to examine the
relationship between KLF6, clinicopatholo-
gical characteristics, cell proliferation and
survival.
Materials and methods
Tissue samples and clinical
data collection
Complete pathological data were retrospect-
ively collected from consecutive patients
with cutaneous malignant melanoma, trea-
ted at the Department of Dermatology and
Pathology, Qilu Hospital, Shandong
University, Jinan, China between January
2000 and December 2007. None of the
patients had received preoperative antic-
ancer treatment. There were no other spe-
cific inclusion or exclusion criteria for the
study. Tissue samples were obtained from
included cases: samples were fixed in 10%
neutral formalin and embedded in paraffin
wax before sections of 3-mm thickness were
cut and transferred onto slides. The diagno-
sis of cutaneous malignant melanoma was
confirmed by histological analysis, accord-
ing to the World Health Organization
classification of skin tumours;9 tumour­
node­metastasis (TNM) stage was also
confirmed.10 Control specimens were
obtained from areas of healthy unaffected
skin tissue, taken from the same patients
(healthy tissue sites were 3 cm away from the
melanoma tissue).
The study protocol was approved by the
Ethics Review Committee of Qilu Hospital,
Shandong University and all patients pro-
vided written informed consent.
Immunohistochemistry of KLF6 and Ki-67
The presence of KLF6 in malignant melan-
oma tissues was analysed by immunohisto-
chemistry. The proliferative rate of tumour
cells was determined by immunohistochem-
istry analysis of the nuclear antigen Ki-67.
Sections (3 mm thick) were deparaffinized
twice (10 min each) in dimethylbenzene and
rehydrated through graded concentrations
of ethanol. Slides were incubated in
0.001 mol/l ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid
(pH 8.0) and underwent high-pressure steam
antigen retrieval for 5 min. Tissue sections
were then incubated in rabbit antihuman
KLF6 monoclonal antibodies (Abcam,
Cambridge, UK; 1 : 100 dilution) and
mouse antihuman Ki-67 ready-to-use mono-
clonal antibodies (ZhongShan Golden
Bridge Biotechnology Company, Beijing,
China) for 1 h at 37C. The slides were
then washed three times in 0.01 M phos-
phate-buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.3). Slides
were incubated with a secondary antibody
(horseradish peroxidase goat antimouse,
used without dilution; supplied by DAKO,
Glostrup, Denmark]) for 1 h at 37C. The
slides were then washed three times in PBS,
pH 7.2. Immunohistochemistry was per-
formed using the EnVisionTM method
according to the manufacturer's instructions
(DAKO). Diaminobenzidine-treated slides
were counterstained with Giemsa staining,
to mask yellow-pigmented granules in the
melanoma cells; this was undertaken to
avoid them obscuring the immunohisto-
chemistry staining.

Grading standards of
immunohistochemistry
The presence of KLF6 and Ki-67 was
determined by light microscopy (BX51,
Olympus Optical, Tokyo, Japan) and was
observed by yellow-to-brown staining in the
cytoplasm and nucleus. KLF6 staining was
evaluated in five randomly-selected high-
power (Â 400) microscope fields with the
most intense staining, in which the total
number of cells and the number of posi-
tively-stained cells were counted. The total
number of cells from five fields was ! 200;
the percentage of cells staining positive was
calculated and the results were graded as
follows: 1, 5%; 2, 6À25%; 3, 26À50%;
4, > 50% of cells stained positive. Grade 1
was defined as negative for staining and
grades 2­4 were defined as positive. The
proliferation index was calculated according
to the method of Bologna-Molina et al.11
Briefly, the percentage of cells staining
positive for Ki-67 was calculated using
photomicrographs (one per case) obtained
using a high-power objective (Â 100) of 10
randomly-selected fields of view, where
tumour cells were predominant; the prolif-
eration index ¼ cells staining positive for Ki-
67/total number of tumour cells Â 100.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ statistical software, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. Relative levels of KLF6 in
malignant melanoma lesions and healthy
skin tissue, and the relationship between
KLF6 and clinicopathological parameters,
were analysed using the 2-test. The associ-
ation between KLF6 and the proliferation
index was analysed using Spearman's rank
correlation coefficient. Cumulative survival
rate was determined using the Life Table
method.12 Univariate survival analysis was
performed by the Kaplan­Meier, method
with the log-rank test applied for compari-
son; a survival curve was used to represent
the accumulated survival rate. Multivariate
survival analysis was performed using logis-
tic regression. A P-value of < 0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
Data from 40 patients (12 women and 28
men) with a mean age of 49.2 years (range:
25­70 years) were analysed. A total of 30
patients had lymph node metastasis while
the remaining 10 patients had no evidence of
metastasis.
The protein KLF6 was found in normal
tissues and malignant melanoma lesions:
positive staining of a yellow-to-brown
colour was mainly observed in the epithelial
prickle and basal layers in normal tissues; in
malignant melanoma lesions, yellow stain-
ing was observed in the cuticular layer.
Malignant melanoma tissue from 11
patients was positive for KLF6, giving a
positive rate of 27.5%, which was signifi-
cantly lower compared with control tissues
(2 ¼ 45.5, P < 0.001, Table 1).
Staining for Ki-67 was mainly detected in
the nucleus. Sporadic staining was observed
in normal tissues compared with a more
diffuse staining in malignant melanoma tis-
sues: the proliferation index was signifi-
cantly higher in malignant melanoma
compared with normal tissues (72.7 Æ 11.31
versus 3.06 Æ 1.02; t ¼ À38.79, P < 0.001).
Spearman's rank correlation coefficient ana-
lysis demonstrated a negative correlation
between the presence of KLF6 and the
proliferation index (r ¼ À0.7, P < 0.01).
The presence of KLF6 in cutaneous
malignant melanoma was correlated with
tumour diameter, lymph node metastasis
and TNM stage10 (P < 0.05, Table 2). There
was no significant correlation between
KLF6 and other clinicopathological fea-
tures such as age or sex (Table 2).

Detailed follow-up information was
available for all 40 patients. Kaplan­Meier
survival analysis demonstrated that the
3-year survival rate in patients with low
levels of KLF6 protein was significantly
lower than that in patients with high levels
of KLF6 (2 ¼ 4.871, P < 0.05).
Discussion
The mammalian KLF gene family includes
15 proteins (KLF 1­15), each with a similar
Cys2/His2 zinc-finger structure at their
C-termini, that are involved in the regula-
tion of transcription.13,14 KLF6 (also known
as zinc-finger transcription factor-9 or core
promoter-element binding protein) is a ubi-
quitously expressed nuclear transcription
factor, located on chr10p15, consisting of
four exons: exon two of KLF6 encodes the
domain with transcription activity.15 Unlike
the other members of the KLF family, the
N-terminal domain of KLF6 has abundant
proline and serine residues in addition to the

C-terminal Cys2/His2 zinc-finger struc-
ture.16 KLF6 binds specifically to GC
box-promoter motifs and upregulates or
downregulates the expression of target
genes, thereby controlling cell proliferation
and differentiation, apoptosis and signal
transduction.17­19
Many important transcription factors are
KLF6 targets.4,18,19 These include placenta
glycoprotein, collagen a(I), transforming
growth factor (TGF)-b1, TGF-b1 receptor-
I and receptor-II, urokinase-type plasmino-
gen activator and p21/WAFl. Activation of
key cell-cycle regulator genes by the tran-
scription factor E2F is inhibited by phos-
phorylation of the retinoblastoma (Rb)
gene. By blocking phosphorylation of Rb,
p21 regulates expression of E2F and thereby
arrests the cell cycle by preventing G1
/S
transition.20 KLF6 is a p53-independent
activator of p21 and may have an effect
similar to p53 in the regulation of p21
expression, through which it suppresses cell
proliferation.4,21­24 Tumour cell growth is
also inhibited by KLF6 through other mech-
anisms. An antiproliferative effect of KLF6
through upregulation of the cyclin-depen-
dent kinase inhibitor p27 has been demon-
strated in lung cancer.25 In addition, KLF6
has been shown to interact with c-Src pro-
tein, leading to the inactivation of Erk and
Akt (which are critical for cell proliferation
and survival) and the suppression of oestro-
gen receptor-mediated cell growth in breast
cancer.26 Research has also suggested that a
KLF6-related epigenetic mechanism may be
involved in tumour cell proliferation.27
Data from the present study indicate that
fewer cutaneous malignant melanoma
lesions had evidence of KLF6 immunohis-
tochemical staining compared with healthy
control tissues, taken from the same patient.
In addition, the presence of KLF6 protein
was shown to be negatively correlated with
tumour cell proliferation. The present study
also demonstrated that KLF6 was asso-
ciated with tumour diameter, TNM stage
and lymph node metastasis. Therefore,
KLF6 expression levels might reflect the
degree of malignancy of cutaneous malig-
nant melanoma. More patients with positive
KLF6 staining had tumours in TNM I/II
stages compared with TNM III/IV, and
more had no evidence of lymph node metas-
tasis. Furthermore, shorter survival rates
were determined in patients with no evi-
dence of KLF6 staining. Taken together,
these data support an essential role for loss
or downregulation of KLF6 in the develop-
ment and progression of cutaneous malig-
nant melanoma.
The authors acknowledge that there were
some limitations to the present study. First,
because malignant melanoma is rare in
China, the number of patients included in
the study was small. Secondly, this was a
retrospective analysis of archived patient
data; larger, prospective studies are needed
to clarify these initial study findings.
In conclusion, the present study revealed
that KLF6 expression is downregulated in
tissue samples of cutaneous malignant mel-
anoma compared with healthy control sam-
ples from the same patients. These data
indicate that KLF6 may be involved in
tumour progression and may be a tumour
suppressor and prognostic marker for cuta-
neous malignant melanoma.
