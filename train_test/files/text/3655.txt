Job satisfaction is an important determinant of employee
productivity. It has been variously defined as a delightful
sensation experienced by the worker due to the nature of the
job (Locke, 1976), an emotional feeling derived from work
(Cranny, Smith, & Stone, 1992), and a person's outlook
toward his or her job (Brief, 1998). Weiss (2002), while
accepting the argument that job satisfaction is a mental
approach, concluded that this is determined by one's percep-
tions, experiences, and faith. Researchers have investigated
job satisfaction through a large number of predictors.
Time pressure and challenge appraisal have been identi-
fied as important determinants of job satisfaction. Time pres-
sure is the demand on the worker to work faster than usual to
complete the given tasks (Baer & Oldham, 2006; Kinicki &
Vecchio, 1994). Luthans and Youssef (2007) considered
challenge appraisal as a momentary judgment of a situation,
which is more like a state of mind. Challenge appraisal
prompts an individual to initiate efforts to effectively address
a given situation (Skinner & Brewer, 2002).
Time pressure and challenge appraisal have a strong rela-
tionship with a society's work ethic and social concept of
time. Most of the studies on the relationship between time
pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfaction have been
carried out in societies which follow the Protestant work
ethic and mono-chronic concept of time. United States,
Germany, England, France, and Scandinavian countries are
mono-chronic societies. Third world countries, including
Pakistan, represent poly-chronic cultures.
The term "Protestant work ethic" has been coined by
Weber (1930). He explains it in a single phrase: "Time is
money." A mono-chronic society represents the Protestant
work ethic by laying stress on punctuality, sanctity of sched-
ules, and focus on a single activity at a time (Griffin, 2000).
However, a poly-chronic society allows for engaging in mul-
tiple activities simultaneously and maintaining a relaxed atti-
tude toward work schedules (Hall & Hall, 1990).
Ohly and Fritz (2010), in their study on the behavior of
employees in a German automotive plant, reported that work
characteristics such as time pressure and job control can be
experienced as a challenge that is positively associated with
performance-related behaviors. Their findings represent the
dynamics of work characteristics in a highly mono-chronic
society.

Time Pressure and Challenge Appraisal as
Predictors of Job Satisfaction: Empirical
Evidence From Pakistani Universities
Saleem Akhtar Malik1
Abstract
The study has been conducted to investigate the impact of time pressure and challenge appraisal on job satisfaction experienced
by Pakistani university teachers in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi. It is the first study which has investigated the
relationships between time pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfaction in the backdrop of a poly-chronic society
and compared the findings with those of a study carried out in a mono-chronic society. Data were collected through a
survey by administering questionnaires to the respondents. The findings reveal that Pakistani respondents experience a
lesser level of time pressure when compared with the German respondents. Also, there has been lesser variability in time
pressure of Pakistani respondents in comparison with the German respondents. The study also finds that, like their German
counterparts, Pakistani university teachers consider time pressure as a challenge-related stress. The correlation between
time pressure and challenge shows a lower degree of relationship in case of Pakistani respondents compared with a moderate
degree for German respondents.

Mujtaba, Cavico, McCartney, and DiPaolo (2011) consid-
ered moral development as a continuous process to enhance
an individual's ability to differentiate between right and
wrong. The work ethic of poly-chronic societies has been
developed over a period of centuries. Thus, they consider
shirking and violating time schedules as perfectly normal.
This is the reason Transparency International-Pakistan
(2010) rated Pakistan very low in the enforcement and prac-
tices of ethical standards.
The current study attempts at analyzing the interaction of
time pressure and challenge appraisal with job satisfaction
under a poly-chronic overhang by investigating the behavior
of Pakistani university teachers. The aim is to probe how
work characteristics affect employee job satisfaction in a
poly-chronic society. The key questions of the current study
are to investigate how teachers in Pakistani universities
respond to time pressure, and, does it result in feelings of
challenge which lead to job satisfaction? The purpose of this
study was to see if the findings of the earlier studies hold
good in the third world societies, which follow a diametri-
cally opposite work ethic and social concept of time.
Literature Review
Time Pressure and Job Satisfaction
Robinson and Godbey (1996) had found that whereas in the
20th Century Americans had more free time, their time man-
agement and the resultant emotional stability had become
more difficult. The researchers concluded that eventually
people learn to adjust themselves to the demanding pace of
life.
The influence of time pressure on worker performance
has shown paradoxical results. Many researchers have
reported that job satisfaction is negatively predicted by time
pressure. However, quite a number of studies have shown
that time pressure exerts positive influence on job satisfac-
tion. Decker and Borgen (1993) considered time pressure as
a stressor which negatively affects job satisfaction.
Linzer et al. (2000) have focused on finding how time
pressure affects quality of physician care. They have found
that time pressure results in job dissatisfaction. Their results
also show that in non-operational issues, such as patient­
physician relationship, job satisfaction is not affected by
time pressure. However, time pressure affects job satisfac-
tion in operational issues such as patient care. Slobounov,
Fukada, Simon, Rearick, and Ray (2000), while studying if
the demand on the employees to work faster than usual to
complete the assigned tasks influences their behavior, con-
firmed that time pressure, besides reducing the time to per-
form a task, results in increased behavioral errors that lead to
job dissatisfaction.
Workers having less time pressure are more satisfied
(Dhondt, Kraan, & Sloten, 2002). In their report on technology
and work organization in the European Union, Dhondt et al.
have mentioned that whereas time pressure on workers in
European Union countries continues to rise, job control has
stabilized at the level of 1996. This implies that whereas the
demand on the employee to work faster than usual to complete
the given tasks has been increasing, there is no commensurate
increase in the level of freedom allowed him or her to choose
the way to carry out these tasks. This is the reason why the
working conditions in the European Union have become more
stressful, resulting in high health risks for the workers.
According to Dhondt et al., managers are designing the jobs in
a manner that requires workers to put in a greater amount of
work. They suggest using technology to reduce time pressure
on workers.
Nordqvist, Hovmark, and Zika-Viktorsson (2004) have
studied the relationships between perceived time pressure,
estimated goal achievements, team processes (team support,
cooperation, and collective ability), and job satisfaction. The
researchers have found that time pressure casts a negative
influence on job satisfaction. They have concluded that neg-
ativity of time pressure is neutralized through moderation by
team support for the collective goal. Donno and Demaree
(2008) have also reported that time pressure negatively
affects job satisfaction.
Whereas time pressure has been negatively associated
with job satisfaction, Podsakoff, Lepine, and Lepine (2007)
have reported a positive relationship between the two. Maule,
Hockey, Clough, and Bdzola (2000) have carried out a study
involving an experiment based on risk scenarios offering a
choice between safe and risky actions. According to the find-
ings, time-pressured respondents showed more keenness and
energy and applied a number of different strategies to meet
the deadline. These outcomes and the applied strategies var-
ied systematically with task structure, particularly the effort
manipulation. Fay and Sonnentag (2002) maintained that
time pressure may be a facilitator to address job demands.
This is further elaborated by Ohly, Sonnentag, and Pluntke
(2006), according to whom time pressure acts as a trigger to
break the workplace inertia and accelerates performance.
Time Pressure, Challenge, and Job Satisfaction
Why does time pressure cast paradoxical influences on job
satisfaction? Carnegie (1948) opined that time pressure
results in negative stress on people who are bored with their
work. This stress manifests itself in fatigue, both mental and
physical. However, an interesting activity leads to positive
stress, which keeps people riveted to the activity for hours
without feeling fatigued. Carnegie further explains that one's
emotional attitude has a greater impact on producing fatigue
than physical stress. When people are immensely interested
in a job or undertaking, it ceases to be a fatigue and becomes
a pleasure to undertake. In such a situation, the work is not a
burden but feels like effortless movement. Carnegie's thesis
has been empirically confirmed by Lepine, Podsakoff, and
Lepine (2005) who reported that hindrance stressors directly
Malik 3
and negatively influence employee productivity and job sat-
isfaction. Lepine et al. suggested that worker performance
can be enhanced, and job satisfaction increased, by distin-
guishing between challenge and hindrance.
Ohly and Fritz (2010) have found that time pressure, in
conjunction with job control, creates challenge appraisal,
which results in proactive behavior. Hall and Lawler (1970)
reported that job satisfaction results from the pressure exerted
on the employee due to the challenging nature of a task.
Positive tension created by the challenging and difficult tasks
results in a greater degree of job satisfaction than easier and
routine jobs (Ivancevich & McMahon, 1977; Locke, 1976).
Job satisfaction has also been related to personality traits
propounded by Judge, Heller, and Mount (2002).
Ohly and Fritz (2010) presented a conceptual framework
which integrates time pressure, job control, and challenge
appraisal to predict creativity and proactive behavior. These
researchers mention two categories of performance-related
behaviors: chronic and daily. Chronic behaviors are the one
time measurements recorded at random. Daily behaviors are
the averaged ratings of two or more measurements recorded
during the day. Fritz and Sonnentag (2009) cited three reasons
for factoring daily-performance-related behaviors while mea-
suring performance levels: (a) to help zero-in on the exact
situations which trigger these daily behaviors, (b) to facilitate
in finding out if the factors influencing such behavior are the
same or different in case of chronic behaviors, and (3) to
allow for measurements that are closer to the actual experi-
ence and behavior. Ohly and Fritz maintain that there is a lack
of understanding about the processes which transform chronic
work characteristics into daily experiences and affect day-to-
day performance. Butler, Grzywacz, Bass, and Linney (2005)
reported that work characteristics (time pressure and job con-
trol) are not entirely stable. For example, challenge is a
momentary appraisal of a given situation and can be better
captured on a daily basis. Hence, Ohly and Fritz measure both
chronic and daily work characteristics. They theorize that
chronic time pressure and chronic job control result in daily
time pressure and daily job control, respectively. These, in
turn, lead to challenge appraisal, finally predicting proactive
behavior. Ohly and Fritz consider time pressure as a catalyst
for creating a perception of challenge, which prompts the
worker to strive for goal accomplishment.
How do work characteristics result in the perception of a
challenge? A demanding situation creates a challenge that
can be utilized for accomplishment of individual objectives
(Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Skinner & Brewer, 2002). These
researchers relate challenge appraisal with positive response.
Their research findings indicate that there exists a positive
relationship between challenge and job satisfaction. While
investigating the dynamics of stress leading toward positive
outcomes and the variables that act as moderators between
stress and such positive outcomes, Bosewell, Buchanan, and
LePine (2004) have found that challenge appraisal moder-
ates the relationship between job control, time pressure, and
job satisfaction. They also maintain that, whereas hindrance-
related stress predicts negative outcomes and lower job satis-
faction, challenge-related stress leads to positive outcomes
and increased job satisfaction. Bosewell et al. confirm Ohly
and Fritz's (2010) finding that time pressure acts as a catalyst
for creating a perception of challenge, which prompts the
worker to strive for goal accomplishment. They further build
up this argument by maintaining that stress may positively
influence individual, group, or organizational behavior.
Lepine et al. (2005) have conducted a meta-analytic test
of a two-dimensional work stressor framework involving the
relationship between stressors with strains, motivation, and
performance. They have found that hindrance stressors
directly and negatively influence employee productivity and
job satisfaction. However, challenge-related stressors have a
positive effect on job satisfaction, performance, and neutral-
izing indirect effects on performance. These researchers
have suggested that worker performance can be enhanced,
and job satisfaction increased, by distinguishing between
challenge and hindrance.
Podsakoff et al. (2007) have investigated the inadequacies
in previous research pertaining to employee behavior under
pressure due to the limitations of time and nature of work.
Their results reveal that challenge casts a positive influence
on job satisfaction. A challenging situation acts as a catalyst
for worker effort and higher performance leading to job sat-
isfaction (Tomaka, Blascovich, Kelsey, & Leitten, 1993;
Study 2). In their study, Tomaka et al. have discussed the use
of physiological measures as predictors of stress. Their
results indicate that the perceived threat from a given situa-
tion creates a task stress. This task stress generates the feel-
ings of challenge which leads to job satisfaction.
There exists a linkage between personal and professional
satisfaction and challenge resulting from multiple roles
(Carroll, 1997). Andrea and Wallace (2004) have concluded
a positive relationship between challenge and job satisfac-
tion across occupational groups.
Theoretical Framework and Development of
Hypotheses
The theoretical framework of this study partially incorpo-
rates Ohly and Fritz's (2010) conceptual framework (Figure
1), which establishes linkage between time pressure, chal-
lenge appraisal, job control, proactive behavior, and job sat-
isfaction, and findings from studies reporting a direct
relationship between challenge and job satisfaction (Hall &
Lawler, 1970; Lazarus & Folkman, 1984; Skinner & Brewer,
2002). As the study is oriented toward finding if time pres-
sure experienced by Pakistani university teachers results in
challenge appraisal and job satisfaction, and as the researcher
did not intend to investigate the processes which transform
chronic time pressure into daily time pressure, the theoretical
framework (Figure 2) has been kept simple and focuses only
on the relationship between chronic time pressure, challenge
4 SAGE Open
appraisal, and job satisfaction. A relationship between time
pressure and challenge appraisal is to be inferred to find if
time pressure creates a challenge-related stress in the
Pakistani university teachers.
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Chronic time pressure is significantly
and positively related to challenge appraisal.
Feeling of a challenge experienced by a time-pressured
person may not necessarily lead to job satisfaction. Being a
momentary appraisal of a situation, challenge may be a fleet-
ing sensation which may diffuse soon and the individual may
revert to his default emotional state. The level of challenge
appraisal experienced by university teachers should remain
stable enough to lead to job satisfaction.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): There is a significant and positive
relationship between challenge appraisal and job
satisfaction.
To validate, in the context of a poly-chronic society, the
earlier findings that there is a direct relationship between
chronic time pressure and job satisfaction, the third hypoth-
esis has been formulated.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): There is a significant relationship
between chronic time pressure and job satisfaction.
Method
Procedure
The demographic data and information on employee percep-
tions of time pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfac-
tion were collected through a survey method by administering
questionnaires to the respondents.All the questionnaires were
manually administered. The researcher personally visited the
selected universities and briefed the faculty members about
the significance of research and the need for developing a
holistic model explaining the relationships between time
pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satisfaction. It was
highlighted that the research will have profound implications
on improving the quality of teaching in the Pakistani universi-
ties. The researcher wanted to use the probability sampling
method because of its greater degree of accuracy. However,
there was a considerable reluctance by the respective univer-
sity registrars to share the data regarding faculty members.
Generally, the faculty lists were not up to date. Even when the
incomplete faculty lists were provided, many faculty mem-
bers were not available because of various commitments.
This made it nearly impossible to follow the probability sam-
pling method. Hence, reference-chain sampling method was
resorted to where, through networking, a chain of question-
naire administrators and respondents was created. Due to the
above-cited reasons, data collection took more than 4 months.

Participants
Population of the study comprised faculty members of the
universities in the twin cities of Islamabad and Rawalpindi.
Higher Education Commission of Pakistan (HEC; n.d.)
recognizes 22 universities in the Rawalpindi­Islamabad
region, 17 in the public sector, and 4 in the private sector.
These universities have a population of approximately
10,000 faculty members. The population keeps fluctuating,
mainly on account of visiting faculty. The sample con-
sisted of 282 university professors. Both public sector and
private sector universities were included. In all, 400 ques-
tionnaires were distributed. One hundred seventy-nine
questionnaires were not responded to and 39 were rejected,
being incomplete.
Pakistani university teachers, even as their counterparts
in mono-chronic societies, are routinely pressured for time.
However, teaching profession requires creativity and offers
challenges. A significant proportion of these teachers get
opportunities to study in foreign universities where they get
exposure to protestant work ethics. Over time, their person-
alities acquire different shades of an amalgam of mono-
chronic and poly-chronic values. On account of these
characteristics, these people constitute a very good speci-
men for studying the relationships between work character-
istics and job satisfaction in the context of a poly-chronic
society which is undergoing a slow, albeit significant social
transformation.
Measures
Time pressure has been measured using Instrument for
stress-related job analysis (ISTA; Semmer, Zapf, & Dunckel,
1998). The instrument comprises three items related to high
quantitative workload. A sample item is "How often must
you finish work later because of having too much to do?"
ISTA instrument taps time pressure on a 5-point Likert-type
scale. To ensure uniformity of measurement with other
instruments, the Likert-type scale has been modified by rais-
ing it to 7 points (1 = very rarely/never to 7 = very often).
Challenge appraisal has been measured using four items
based on Bosewell et al. (2004): The items capture the degree
to which individuals consider their work is demanding but
not overtaxing their abilities, and bringing them closer to
their personal goals. Specimen item is "my work today
brings me closer to the accomplishment of personal goals."
Challenge appraisal has been measured on a 7-point Likert-
type scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).
Job satisfaction has been measured using the 15-item
measure in the Job Diagnostic Survey developed by Hackman
and Oldham (1974). The instrument has been modified by
reducing the number of items to 12. An example item is
"Generally speaking, I am very satisfied with this job." Job
satisfaction has also been measured on a 7-point Likert-type
scale (1 = strongly disagree to 7 = strongly agree).
A pilot test comprising a sample of 60 responses was con-
ducted to test the reliability of the instruments. Cronbach's
alpha values based on standardized items (Table 2) were .700
for time pressure and .769 for challenge appraisal. These
indicated that the instruments tapping the predictor variables
possessed reliability. However, the items measuring job sat-
isfaction showed lower internal validity (Cronbach's  =
.637). A critical appraisal of the item statistics measuring job
satisfaction revealed that three of the items indicated low
mean: (a) Most of the things I have to do on this job seem
useless or trivial (M = 2.82), (b) I frequently think of quitting
this job (M = 2.18), and (c) I have often trouble figuring out
whether I am doing well or poorly on this job (M = 3.52). It
was considered that the respondents were reluctant to answer
these questions. This would have impaired the internal valid-
ity of these items. Consequently, these items were excluded,
and the instrument was modified to include 12 instead of the
original 15 items. Retest based on the modified instrument
(12 items) indicated Cronbach's alpha coefficient of .772,
thus showing that the items in the modified instrument pos-
sessed internal validity.
Results and Discussion
Descriptive Statistics
Demographics are shown in Table 1. Male and female
respondents constituted 63.1% and 36.9%, respectively, of
the research sample. Females thus constituted approximately
one third of the sample size. The majority of respondents
(53.2%) belonged to 25 to 30 years age group. The survey
also revealed that 52.8% of the respondents were single,
whereas 47.2% were married. The majority of the respon-
dents (46.1%) were in MA/MSc/MBA category, closely fol-
lowed by MPhil/MS (35.5%). PhD respondents constituted
18.4% of the sample. The survey indicated that 53.2% of the
respondents had 1 to 5 years teaching experience, followed
by 23.8% who had 6 to 10 years teaching experience. Only
7.4% respondents had between 11 to 15 years and greater
than 15 years experience. Respondents from management
sciences and engineering sciences constituted 28.7% and
23.4% of the sample. Remaining (47.2%) belonged to other
groups. Permanent faculty members formed 73% of the sam-
ple and almost one fourth (26.2%) were visiting faculty.
Slightly more than half of the respondents (55.3%) belonged
to public sector universities.
Besides Cronbach's alpha coefficient, Table 2 also high-
lights data on arithmetic mean, standard deviation, and
Pearson's correlation coefficient. Arithmetic means were
3.543, 2.741, and 3.473 for job satisfaction, time pressure,
and challenge, respectively. Within the predictors, variability
in time pressure was higher (SD = 0.186) than challenge (SD =
0.044). Seventeen respondents (6%) reported that they were
very often pressed for time, as against 12 respondents (4%)
who rarely/never experienced time pressure. Highest

percentage (30%) reported that they occasionally felt time
pressured. Responding to "How often must you finish work
later because of having too much to do?" 12 respondents
(4%) replied, "very often," while 21 (7%) replied, "very
rarely/never." Only 15 respondents (5%) felt that very often
a fast pace of work was required of them. An equal number
replied that they very rarely/never required a fast pace.
Highest percentage (22%) reported that they often required a
fast pace. In response to the item "I feel challenged," 4% (11
respondents) strongly disagreed, 31% (87 respondents)
agreed with the statement, whereas 11% (32 respondents)
strongly agreed. In response to the question "Generally
speaking, I am very satisfied with this job," 7 (2%) respon-
dents strongly disagreed, 83 (29%) agreed, whereas 35
(12%) strongly agreed.
Table 3 gives the comparison between Pakistani and
German respondents. Mean level of time pressure experi-
enced by the German respondents in Ohly and Fritz's study
was 3.42. Mean level of time pressure experienced by
Pakistani respondents was 2.74. Pakistani respondents were,
therefore, less time-pressured than their German counter-
parts. Variability for time pressure was also lower (SD =
0.186) in case of Pakistani respondents compared with the
German respondents (SD = 0.72). Mean level of challenge
experienced by Pakistani respondents was 3.473 when com-
pared with 4.02 in Ohly and Fritz's study, indicating a lower
level for Pakistani respondents. Variability in challenge was
also lower in Pakistani respondents (SD = 0.044) in compari-
son with the German respondents (SD = 1.28).
Inferential Statistics
H1 propounds that there is a significant and positive relation-
ship between chronic time pressure and challenge appraisal.
Correlation analysis (Table 2) indicates a positive and highly
significant relationship between these two study variables
(r = .234, p = .01). According to Davis (1971), this is a low
degree relationship. In comparison, Ohly and Fritz (2010),
doing their research in Germany, a mono-chronic society,
have reported a moderate degree of highly significant corre-
lation between chronic time pressure and challenge (r = .330,
p  .001). Regression analysis (Table 4) shows that time
pressure explains 5% of variance in challenge appraisal in
Pakistani teachers (R2 = .055). One SD change in time pres-
sure results in 23.4 SD change in challenge appraisal ( =
.234). H1 is, therefore, validated.
According to H2, there is a positive and significant rela-
tionship between challenge appraisal and job satisfaction.
Correlation analysis (Table 2) indicates a highly significant
positive relationship between these two study variables (r =
.318; p = .01). It is a moderate degree of relationship (Davis,
1971). Multiple regression analysis (Table 5) indicates that

challenge appraisal and time pressure explain 17.9% of vari-
ance in job satisfaction (R2 = .179). One SD change in chal-
lenge appraisal results in 25.1 SD change in job satisfaction
( = .251). According to Ohly and Fritz (2010), work charac-
teristics have two components, time pressure and job control.
Challenge is the symbiotic affect of time pressure and job
control, and has a positive relationship with performance-
related behaviors. The findings of this study are also in har-
mony with the findings of Decker and Borgen (1993), Carroll
(1997), Andrea and Wallace (2004), and Podsakoff et al.
(2007) who reported a positive relationship between chal-
lenge appraisal and job satisfaction. The findings reveal that
the teachers in Pakistani universities consider their nature of
work as challenging. H2 is, therefore, accepted.
H3 infers that time pressure correlates significantly with
job satisfaction. The direction of relationship has not been
mentioned as, according to the literature review, time pres-
sure exerts paradoxical influences on job satisfaction.
Correlation analysis (Table 2) indicates a positive and highly
significant relationship between time pressure and job satis-
faction (r = .346, p = .01). The relationship is of a moderate
degree (Davis, 1971). Multiple regression analysis (Table 5)
reveals that 1 SD change in time pressure results in 28.8 SD
change in job satisfaction ( = .288). These findings validate
H3. The findings are in harmony with those of Maule et al.
(2000), Fay and Sonnentag (2002), Ohly et al. (2006), Lepine
et al. (2005), and Podsakoff et al. (2007) who have reported
a positive relationship between the two variables. This posi-
tive relationship has been further explained by Bosewell
et al. (2004), who maintained that whereas hindrance-related
stress predicts negative outcomes, challenge-related stress
leads to positive outcomes. This indirectly implies that time
pressure, through challenge appraisal, leads to job satisfac-
tion among Pakistani university professors.
Conclusion
It is the first study which has investigated the relationships
between time pressure, challenge appraisal, and job satis-
faction in the backdrop of a poly-chronic society, and has
compared the findings with those of a study carried out in
a mono-chronic society (Ohly & Fritz, 2010). The findings
reveal that Pakistani respondents experience a lesser level
of time pressure when compared with the German respon-
dents. Also, there has been lesser variability in time pres-
sure of Pakistani respondents in comparison with the
German respondents. This implies that Pakistani respon-
dents demonstrate conformist behavior, whereas German
respondents are individualistic. The findings were expected
as the former represent a mono-chronic society, whereas
the latter a poly-chronic society. The study finds that, like
their German counterparts, Pakistani university teachers
consider time pressure as a challenge-related stress. The
correlation between time pressure and challenge shows a
lower degree of relationship in case of Pakistani respon-
dents compared with a moderate degree for German
respondents. The theoretical framework investigated by
the study is evolutionary in nature and may be further
expanded by adding job control and proactive behavior
(Ohly & Fritz, 2010) into the matrix. To improve the rigor
of the study, a population where probability sampling is
possible, for example, banking, telecommunications, pub-
lic sector corporations, and so on, is recommended.
