Abstract
We use the method of deficit accumulation to describe prevalent and incident levels of frailty in community-dwelling older
persons and compare prevalence rates in higher income countries in Europe, to prevalence rates in six lower income
countries. Two multi-country data collection efforts, SHARE and SAGE, provide nationally representative samples of adults
aged 50 years and older. Forty items were used to construct the frailty index in each data set. Our study shows that the level
of frailty was distributed along the socioeconomic gradient in both higher and lower income countries such that those
individuals with less education and income were more likely to be frail. Frailty increased with age and women were more
likely to be frail in most countries. Across samples we find that the level of frailty was higher in the higher income countries
than in the lower income countries.

Introduction
Frailty is increasingly common as a result of population aging
[1]­[4]. Assessing levels of frailty in higher versus lower income
countries gives a unique perspective on health status at different
stages of demographic transitions, and the effect of different
policies on functioning and, in turn, on well-being over the life
course. With almost all countries in the world faced with growing
numbers of older persons, and more older persons in lower than
higher income countries, a better understanding of levels of
functioning and predictors of health care utilization will be
necessary for planning purposes.
The important factors will be how to best maintain the health
and functioning of an aging population, thereby preventing or
postponing disease, disability and frailty. These mitigating factors
are not only present at the individual level, but also in the
supporting environment, for example in communities and social
networks [5].
Frailty has significant impacts on individuals and society with
increased risk of dependency, disability, hospitalization, institutional
placement, and mortality [6], [7]. Numerous classifications and
definitions of frailty are currently used in different clinical and research
settings [8]. Although a common metric for measuring and assessing
frailty would be a starting point, it is hard to establish [9]. Two of the
more commonly used definitions are operationalized as: a physical
phenotype [10]; and as a multi-domain count of health impairments
[11]. The latter description of frailty, as a `multidimensional loss of
reserves (energy, physical ability, cognition, health) that gives rise to
vulnerability', was used for this study [12], [13]. This approach
accounts for deficits in many different health domains measured in the
two multi-country studies used here: the Study on Health, Ageing and
Retirement in Europe (SHARE) and the World Health Organiza-
tion's (WHO) Study on global AGEing and adult health (SAGE).
This paper provides evidence on frailty in older adults across 14
higher income countries and six lower income countries, using a
common set of variables to define frailty. The background aging
characteristics of each of the countries in the study are presented in
Table 1.

Data and Methods
The study sample
The data for these analyses come from two multi-country
surveys, SHARE which is supported by the European Commission
(see www.share-project.org), and SAGE which is supported by the
US National Institute on Aging (see www.who.int/healthinfo/
systems/sage). SHARE includes more than 45,000 individuals
aged 50-plus [14] from higher income countries. Currently, four
waves of SHARE are publicly available and fieldwork has started
for the fifth. We focus on the second wave of SHARE, because its
timing coincides (more or less) with the first wave of SAGE. The
second wave of SHARE was conducted in 2006­07 and included
14 countries: Austria, Belgium, the Czech Republic, Denmark,
France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Poland,
Spain, Sweden, and Switzerland. SHARE is representing about
12% of the world's population aged 50-plus in 2011 [15].
SAGE consists of nationally representative samples of older
adults in six low and middle income countries: China, Ghana,
India, Mexico, the Russian Federation and South Africa,
accounting for 42% of the world's population aged 50-plus in
2011 [15]. SAGE includes questions about health and well-being,
risk factors and chronic conditions, socio-economic status and
work, social networks, and health care utilization. Standardized
training and survey materials were used across the countries. The
first (and to date only publicly available) full wave of SAGE was
implemented between 2007 and 2010 and provides information
on over 42,000 individuals aged 18-plus in total, including 34,124
individuals aged 50-plus. Both studies, SAGE and SHARE, are
still ongoing.
Study contents and variables
In addition to socio-economic variables, including education,
assets, income, consumption and transfers data, both data sets
include a large set of health information (self-reported health,
health conditions, physical and cognitive functioning, health
behaviors, and health care utilization), biomarkers (grip strength,
body mass index (BMI), lung function, vision), and well-being
variables (affective health, subjective well-being, life satisfaction).

Education levels in SAGE countries were mapped onto an
international standard in order to improve comparability of the
highest level of education achieved across the countries [16].
Income quintiles in SAGE countries were generated from the
household ownership of durable goods, dwelling characteristics
(type of floors, walls and cooking stove), and access to services such

as improved water, sanitation and cooking fuel. Durable goods
included number of chairs, tables or cars, and if, for example, the
household has electricity, a television, landline or mobile phone, or
washing machine. The results were recoded into dichotomous
variables taking the value of 0 if not present, and 1 if present. The
data set was then reshaped and country-specific ``asset ladders''
were generated. A Bayesian post-estimation (empirical Bayes)
method was used to arrange households on the asset ladder, where
the raw continuous income estimates were transformed in the final
step into quintiles. This dichotomous hierarchical probit model
has been described in detail elsewhere and used in other studies
using similar data [17]­[19].
Grip strength was measured using Smedley's hand dynamom-
eter, with two trials in each hand with the respondent in a seated
position with the arm at a 90-degree angle and elbow close to the
body. A single value was derived from taking the average of the
best result in each hand. Body mass index was based on measured
height and weight, and is equal to weight/height squared.
Frailty index construction
The approach taken for this analysis is the deficits count
approach to construct the frailty index. A frailty index is strongly
associated with worsening health status and higher mortality risk
when at least 30 deficits are included [20]­[22]. As more deficits
are included, the precision of estimates increases, alternately,
estimates become unstable when fewer than 10 deficits are
included.
The actual number of deficits included in this frailty index was
determined by the availability of the same variables in the second
wave of SHARE and the first wave of SAGE, and by the following

shows the 25th to 75th percentile of the frailty index. The horizontal bar
inside the box shows the median value. The upper and lower bars show

inclusion criteria: (1) deficits must be associated with the health
status of the individual; (2) prevalence of deficits must increase with
age; (3) deficits must not saturate too early; (4) when the
accumulated deficits of an individual are considered as a whole,
they should cover a range of systems (for example, not only
impacting cognition).
A set of assumptions accompanied the inclusion criteria: a) a
reasonable proportion of the population would have the charac-
teristic; b) low levels of missing data - not more than 25% missing
for a given variable; and, c) variables were an expression of a
health deficit [20].
Thirty-nine variables from SHARE and 40 variables from the
SAGE dataset were used to generate the frailty index. These
variables included difficulties in functioning (like loss of mobility),
limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs) (such as needing help
with bathing), and diseases (such as depression, stroke, diabetes).
The underlying assumption is that increasing deficits contribute to
a higher likelihood of frailty in an individual [23]. Information
about variable selection and deficit thresholds for constructing the
frailty index were taken from published literature [20], [24].
Table 2 shows the cut-offs of the selected variables and differences
in constructing the frailty index for both SAGE and SHARE.
Previous studies have indicated that frailty indices need not be
based on the same items to yield similar results when taking the
tallying deficits approach [25].
The variables included were binary, ordinal or continuous.
Binary variables were coded as 1 being a deficit and 0 as non-
deficit. For continuous variables, additional categories between 0
(no deficit) and 1 (maximal deficit) were included. For example,
self-rated health can be very good = 0, good = 0.25, moder-
ate = 0.50, bad = 0.75, very bad = 1 allowing for a more flexible
deficit threshold. Setting cut-offs for the ordinal and continuous
variables (walking speed, BMI, grip strength, mobility problems)
followed an approach based on published literature. Cut-offs were
defined based on characteristics of the distribution of the deficits
[20].
The frailty index was then calculated as the proportion of the
number of deficits for an individual to the total number of deficits.
For example, a respondent with reported cancer, hypertension,
trouble sleeping and slow walking speed has a frailty index score of
4/40 (0.10). In this case, frailty could be a pre-disabled state, so an
individual could be frail but without any limitations in ADLs; or
frail persons could have comorbidity and disability (i.e., with
limitations in ADLs).
In addition, besides the differences in some indicators, the data
sets also differ in the cut-off point for some indicators. For
functional activities and activities of daily living, the SHARE data

only provide information whether difficulties exist ( = 1) or not
( = 0), whereas scalable response categories are available and were
used for these variables in the construction of the frailty index for
SAGE (for example, none = 0, mild = 0.25, moderate = 0.50,
severe = 0.75, extreme = 1).
To make the results comparable across countries with different
population structures, the frailty index is weighted using the
standard population distribution based on the WHO World
Standard [26].
Statistical analysis
In a regression analysis we collapse the individual level data and
calculate the average of the frailty index by country, sex and age.
We apply a log transformation to the average age-specific frailty
index and then estimate a simple linear model (OLS) of the
average age-specific frailty index and age for every country and by
sex. The log transformation is justified because we expect the age-
specific frailty index to increase exponentially with age. We only
consider ages between 50 and 85, because for older ages the
country and sex specific samples sizes are too small to calculate the
average age-specific frailty index with sufficient accuracy.
Results
The results are based on weighted samples of persons aged 50-
plus of N = 161,542 from SHARE 2007, and N = 18,566 from
SAGE 2007­10 (see Tables 3 and 4). The shape of the density
plots for SAGE and SHARE (Figure 1) looks rather similar, but
with a slight left shift and lower peak in the case of SAGE.
Amongst the SHARE countries ­ the highest mean frailty index
scores were seen in Italy, Spain and Poland, the lowest in
Denmark, Switzerland and Ireland. In SAGE, the highest frailty
score was seen in the Russian Federation. The lower income
countries had lower frailty levels than those seen in higher income
countries ­ with China having the lowest mean frailty scores
amongst all countries (Tables 3 and 4). Figure 2 shows a box plot
of the frailty index by country.
On average, women and older age groups had higher frailty
levels than men and younger aged adults. The mean frailty scores
demonstrated strong inverse education and income gradients, with
lower levels of education and lower wealth showing higher levels of
frailty. These patterns were consistent in higher and lower income
countries from the two studies.
To visualize the link between frailty and age, scatter plots of the
log of the age-specific frailty index and age with a linear fit and a
95% confidence band were generated by country and sex
(Figures 3 and 4). At most ages, the regression line for females is
strictly above the regression line for males. In general, the slopes
are rather similar for males and females within a country (Table 5).
However in a few countries, such as China, India, Ireland and
Switzerland, the slope is much steeper for males than for females,
causing the regression lines to intersect at older ages.
Discussion
Frailty is being increasingly recognized as a useful construct in
clinical and other settings. While different stakeholders have used
varying definitions to suit their specific purpose, there is an
emerging consensus that frailty is a multidimensional phenomenon
characterized by decreased reserve and diminished ability to
respond to stress. Its assessment should include measures of
physical performance, including gait speed and other measures of
mobility, nutritional status and mental health, including cognition.
However, currently there is no agreement on a single biomarker
for frailty [9], [27].
A recent systematic review on the prevalence of frailty in
community samples showed a consistent increase in frailty with
age and that frailty was more common in women. This review also
noted big differences between countries that were attributed to
differences in the definition used [28]. Despite our use of a frailty
index that was uniformly applied across countries we still have
significant differences between countries. Our observation that
higher frailty scores were seen in the SHARE countries as
compared to the SAGE countries could possibly indicate a
survivor bias, where social support and health systems allow
people in wealthier countries to live longer despite higher levels of
frailty.
Approaches to measuring frailty and constructing a frailty index
have varied considerably. A recent analysis of six different
approaches showed that these measures can, at best, be used to
exclude frailty as their ability to predict functional decline and
mortality remained poor, and their false positive rates were too
high to permit major health care decisions [29]. Measuring frailty
on a continuum as in our study helps in setting thresholds as fit for
purpose. As the SAGE and SHARE studies will produce more
data from future waves and track respondents who develop a need
for long term care or die, the frailty index can be examined to
determine its predictive validity including a sensitivity analysis to
pick the right threshold depending on the country. Also, it would
allow the examination of different trajectories that respondents
may follow over time and an analysis of the factors associated with
these different trajectories.
Frailty is perhaps the end result of a cascade of events from
inflammatory processes to coagulative dysregulation to a range of
alterations in hormones and peptides and a disruption of
homeostatic mechanisms. Understanding this further in a range
of settings will help identify individuals at risk of becoming frail
and refine interventions for prevention and treatment that will
likely range from nutritional therapies to improving physical
activity [30].
