Abstract
Objective: To measure therapeutic inertia by characterizing prescription patterns using
secondary data obtained from the nationwide diabetes mellitus pay-for-performance (DM-P4P)
programme in Taiwan.
Methods: Using reimbursement claims from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research
Database, a nationwide retrospective cohort study was undertaken of patients with diabetes
mellitus who participated in the DM-P4P programme from 2006­2008. Glycosylated haemoglobin
results were used to evaluate modifications in therapy in response to poor diabetes control.
Prescription patterns were used to assign patients to either a therapeutic inertia group or an
intensified treatment group. Therapeutic inertia was defined as the failure to act on a known
problem.
Results: The research sample comprised of 168 876 patients with diabetes mellitus who had
undergone 899 135 tests. Of these, 37.4% (336 615 visits) of prescriptions were for a combination
of two types of drug and 27.7% (248 788 visits) were for a combination of three types of drug.

The proportion of patients in the intensified therapy group who were prescribed more than two
types of drug was considerably higher than that in the therapeutic inertia group.
Conclusion: In many cases in the therapeutic inertia group only a single type of hypoglycaemic
drug was prescribed or the dosage remained unchanged.

Introduction
It has been reported that more than
387 million people worldwide suffer from
diabetes mellitus, and that this figure is
expected to increase to over 438 million by
2030.1,2 Diabetes mellitus is a major challenge
to Asian countries, including Taiwan.3
Despite guidelines that emphasize the import-
ance of glycaemic control among patients with
diabetes mellitus, many patients have glyco-
sylated haemoglobin (HbA1c
) levels outside
the recommended range.4­6 Therapeutic iner-
tia is defined as when a physician does not
begin or intensify treatment when this is
deemed necessary according to current clinical
practice guidelines.7­9 Previous studies have
shown that patients enrolled in the diabetes
mellitus pay-for-performance (DM-P4P) pro-
gramme in Taiwan are more likely to undergo
guideline-recommended tests and examin-
ations.10­13 Because the DM-P4P programme
is a physician-level incentive strategy aimed at
improving care quality, profiling and compar-
ing the quality of care provided by various
physician groups is a valuable strategy to
facilitate this improvement.14 Our previous
study found that 38.5% of the patients were
subject to therapeutic inertia.6 Furthermore,
patients at medical centres were shown to be
more likely to be prescribed with intensified
treatment than patients in primary clinics.6
The primary goal of this study was to
investigate differences between diabetes pre-
scription patterns for patients subject to
therapeutic inertia and those with intensified
treatment.
Patients and methods
Description of the study population
In this retrospective cohort study, all
patients who were categorized according to
the International Statistical Classification of
Diseases and Related Health Problems as
code 250,15 and who had made at least four
outpatient visits each year from 1 January
2006 to 31 December 2008 were enrolled.16
This selection process has been reported to
increase the accuracy of the diagnosis by
99.16 times compared with a selection pro-
cess that included patients with one or fewer
outpatient visits per year.16 HbA1c
results
were used to evaluate the therapy modifica-
tions adopted in response to poor diabetes
control (i.e., HbA1c
values were 7%­11%).
Secondary data did not include changes in
insulin dosage, and therefore the patients
using insulin prior to the HbA1c
tests were
excluded. The influence of comorbidities on
time to intensification was evaluated using
the chronic illness with complexity (CIC)
score.17 A diabetes comorbidity severity
index (DCSI) score was calculated for dia-
betes-related comorbid disease conditions.18
Data sources
The study used several administrative data-
bases detailing health service usage in
1264 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
Taiwan, including the National Health
Insurance (NHI) Research Database
(NHIRD) and the virtual private network
of the DM-P4P database. The DM-P4P
programme was designed by the NHI
Bureau in Taiwan, and it is the most com-
prehensive and mature P4P programme
in Taiwan.12 Participation in the programme
was voluntary, and the DM-P4P database
was constructed to supplement regular NHI
claims data. DM-P4P patient outcome
data such as HbA1c
values were reported
by the hospitals and entered into the
P4P-specific database automatically.12 This
study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of National Taiwan University
Hospital, Taiwan (no. 201203010RIC).
Signed informed consent was not required
because this study used anonymized
data and did not involve any human
experimentation.
Pharmacological management
In this study, pharmacological therapy was
defined as prescriptions filled 120 days
before and after receiving HbA1c
test results.
Antihyperglycaemic agents were evaluated
according to the Anatomical Therapeutical
Chemical Classification Defined Daily
Dose (ATC/DDD) system developed
by the World Health Organization.19
Antihyperglycaemic agents were categorized
as insulin (ATC codes: A10AB, A10AC,
A10AD, A10AE) and the following 17
major classes of oral antihyperglycaemic
agent (ATC codes are listed outside par-
entheses): A10BB (sulfonamides, urea deri-
vatives), including A10BB01 to A10BB12
(i.e., glibenclamide, chlorpropamide, tolaza-
mideglibenclamide, gliquidone, gliclazide,
glimepiride); A10BD02 (metformin and
sulfonamides); A10BA02 (metformin);
A10BA03 (buformin); A10BD03 (met-
formin and rosiglitazone); A10BF01
(acarbose); A10BG02 (rosiglitazone);
A10BG03 (pioglitazone); A10BX01 (guar
gum); A10BX02 (repaglinide); and A10B
X03 (nateglinide).19
Analysis
Medications were quantified by assigning
DDD units to each item from the NHIRD
based on the index of the ATC classification
system.19 When used for the identification of
changes in prescription (Pafter
­Pbefore
), the
prescribed total DDD was generally com-
prised of the 17 major classes. When pre-
scription medications from more than one
class were considered, any increase in the
dosage among any of the drugs was con-
sidered as intensified therapy.
Measurements
In this study, the following prescription
changes that occurred following HbA1c
measurements were classified into four
mutually exclusive groups: group 1, the
addition of one or more new classes of
drug; group 2, an increase in the dosage of
the same drugs used prior to HbA1c
measurements; group 3, no change in the
drug class or a decrease in the dosage
(DDD); group 4, discontinuation of drug
therapy.
Definition of intensified therapy
Any change in prescription according to the
following conditions was defined as intensi-
fied therapy: the prescription of new oral
antihyperglycaemic agents, increasing the
dosage of any current medication, switching
to another medication in a different thera-
peutic class, or the initiation of insulin use.
The study did not treat switches to medica-
tions in the same therapeutic class as therapy
modification unless the DDD of the new
agent was more than that of the previous
agent, because switching medications could
be a response to side effects rather than
intensifying the therapy.

Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Analysis System (SAS) ver-
sion 9.3. (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Descriptive statistical analyses were used to
examine modifications in therapy to identify
therapeutic inertia. 2-test for categorical
variables were used to compare groups
(intensified therapy and therapeutic inertia)
on key variables obtained from the NHIRD
data set. A P-value < 0.05 was considered
statistically significant.
Results
Following the exclusion of ineligible
patients, the research sample comprised of
data from 168 876 patients with diabetes
mellitus. Among the 899 135 tests that
revealed HbA1c
levels ranging from 7% to
11%, 61.65% of the patients (554 320 visits)
had their therapy intensified, compared with
38.35% (344 815 visits) who did not.6
The mean Æ SD age of the patients was
60.5 Æ 10.8 years. The proportion of patients
with HbA1c levels between 7% and 8% was
48.1% (432 305 visits) (Table 1). This study
identified the following clinical characteris-
tics that were significantly different between
the intensified therapy group and the thera-
peutic inertia group: age, HbA1c
levels,
DCSI scores, and CIC count (P < 0.001 for
all four characteristics).
Patients were prescribed new drugs in
42.0% (377 675 visits) of all case visits, and
19.5% (175 239 visits) of the case visits
involved an increase in dosage of the same
drug class. Among the therapeutic inertia
group, 72.5% (250 077 visits) of the pre-
scriptions were for the same medication
despite abnormal HbA1c
results. Regarding
the pattern analysis of antihyperglycaemic
agents, 37.4% (336 615 visits) of the studied
prescriptions were for a combination of two
types of drug, 27.7% (248 788 visits) were
for a combination of three types of drug,
and 13.3% (119 424 visits) were for a
monotherapy regimen (Table 2). Among
the monotherapy prescriptions, sulfona-
mides were the most frequently prescribed
types of medication (64.4%; 76 937 visits),
and insulin monotherapy accounted for only
7.3% (8672 visits) of the prescriptions
(Table 2). Sulfonamides and biguanides
were the most frequently prescribed drugs
for polytherapy involving two types of drug,
accounting for 78.9% (265 563 visits) of all
dual-drug prescriptions.
Among the polytherapy prescriptions
involving three types of drug (248 788 of
899 135 visits; 27.7%), sulfonamide, biguan-
ide, and thiazolidinedione (109 680 of 248
788 visits; 44.1%) were the most frequently
prescribed combination (Table 2). An add-
itional 8.3% (20 597 of 248 788 visits) of the
prescriptions were for a combination of oral
antihyperglycaemic agents and insulin.
The proportion of patients in the intensi-
fied therapy group prescribed more than two
types of drug was considerably higher than
that in the therapeutic inertia group. For
example, 70.7 % (175 989 of 248 788 visits)
of the cases in the intensified therapy group
were prescribed a combination of three types
of drug, whereas only 29.3% (72 799 of 248
788 visits) of the patients in the therapeutic
inertia group were prescribed such a com-
bination (Table 2). In addition, 38.3%
(45 694 of 119 424 visits) of the patients in
the intensified therapy group received
monotherapy, among whom 8672 single
drug prescriptions (of 45 694 visits; 19.0%)
were for insulin. However, 61.7% (73 730 of
119 424 visits) of the patients in the thera-
peutic inertia group received monotherapy
(Table 2).
Discussion
Therapeutic inertia is defined as a lack of
treatment intensification despite a subopti-
mal outcome with the current diabetes
management strategy.9 In the present study
in a real-world Taiwanese population, based
1266 Journal of International Medical Research 44(6)
on data from more than 899 000 visits, the
following patient characteristics were sig-
nificantly different between the intensified
therapy group and the therapeutic inertia
group: age, HbA1c
levels, DCSI scores, and
CIC count. Treatment of type 2 diabetes
mellitus typically begins with lifestyle adjust-
ments and oral antidiabetic drugs.20­23
When blood glucose can no longer be
controlled merely through lifestyle changes,
metformin is typically prescribed as a first-
line medication, particularly for patients
who are also overweight.21­24 However,
because diabetes is a progressive disease,
blood glucose concentration worsens with
time, and most patients with diabetes even-
tually need at least two types of oral medi-
cation or insulin to reach or maintain the
required blood glucose level.22,23 Current
treatment guidelines differ in terms of what
second-line medication should be prescribed
in cases where blood glucose can no longer
be controlled through metformin alone.21,22
Some recommend supplementing metformin

with sulfonylurea or gradually adding other
types of drug. For example, compared with
the UK, Canada, and Australia,23,24 the
NHI regulations in Taiwan are not as strict
and do not differentiate between first- and
second-line drugs, which allowed physicians
to freely choose what drug or combination
of drugs they prescribed as first-line medi-
cation before May 2016.25 Most single-drug
prescriptions in Taiwan are for sulfonamide
rather than metformin. In this present study,
the most frequently prescribed monotherapy
drug was sulfonylurea, and metformin com-
bined with sulfonylurea for polytherapy. In
addition, this present study found that of the
drug prescriptions for patients, 37.4% (336
615 visits) were for two types of drug, 27.7%
(248 788 visits) were for three types of drug,
and 13.3% (119 424 visits) were for mono-
therapy. This present study also observed
that in the intensified therapy group, the
percentage of patients who were prescribed
more than two types of drug was consider-
ably higher than that in the therapeutic
inertia group. For example, for the three
oral drug combination group, 70.7% of the
prescriptions were from patients in the
intensified therapy group. In the therapeutic
inertia group, however, the present study
observed that in many cases only a single
type of hypoglycaemic drug was prescribed,
or that the dosage remained unchanged.
Few studies have discussed switching drug
types in intensified therapy. A retrospective

cohort study involving 253 238 patients was
undertaken to assess the number of cases
where drug treatment had been modified in
the previous 6 months because of a failure to
properly control one or more types of
chronic disease.26 The authors reported
that 66% of the patients with poorly con-
trolled HbA1c
levels had their prescription
medication changed.26 Most changes
involved prescribing other types of drug
(70% to 84% of cases) or increasing the
prescribed dosage (15% to 40% of cases).26
Similar to the results reported by research
conducted in Taiwan,6 this present research
group previously found that 61.5% of pre-
scriptions were modified before and after a
test result of HbA1c
>7%.6 New types of
drug were added in 42.0% of cases (377 675
prescriptions), and dosages were increased
in 19.5% of cases (175 239 prescriptions).
The unique aspect of this present study is
that the prescriptions of patients who had
undergone intensified therapy were com-
pared with those who had not. Most of the
patients in the intensified therapy group
were prescribed a combination of two
types (178 901 of 554 320 visits; 32.3%) or
three types (175 989 of 554 320 visits; 31.7%)
of drug. However, in the therapeutic inertia
group, during 67.1% (231 444 of 344 815
visits) of the visits the patients were pre-
scribed with one or two types of medication.
Academic studies or treatment guidelines for
chronic diseases such as high blood pressure,
dyslipidaemia, and diabetes mellitus, indi-
cate that complications can be prevented
or delayed if the disease is adequately
controlled.27 According to the treatment
recommendations for type 2 diabetes from
the Taiwan Diabetes Society,28 prescribing a
low-dose combination of drugs rather than a
high dose of a single type of drug is
more effective in lowering blood glucose
and alleviating the side-effects of the
medications.
This present study had several limita-
tions. First, the study population was highly
specific, focusing on the DM-P4P popula-
tion rather than the entire population of
patients with diabetes mellitus in Taiwan.6
A previous study reported that patients who
present with comorbidities or severe diseases
are more likely to be excluded from
DM-P4P programmes.12 Secondly, the
study was unable to collect data on patient
adherence to the prescribed therapy.
Thirdly, the study concentrated on whether
physicians chose to intensify treatment for
poorly controlled blood glucose levels
through the use of hypoglycaemic drugs.
Other measures of health care such as the
risk of hypoglycaemia, type of drugs
selected, increase in dosage, dietary habits
of patients, and referral to care teams were
not considered in this study.6 Nevertheless,
the large patient population in the
validated nationwide database should be
considered as a representative sample, and
should thus provide a reliable clinical repre-
sentation of diabetes care in routine practice
in Taiwan.
In conclusion, this is the first study in
Taiwan that has linked HbA1c
results to
antidiabetic drug prescribing patterns. By
analysing changes in prescriptions before
and after HbA1c
test results, this present
study sought to determine whether phys-
icians modified prescriptions within 120
days of receiving abnormal HbA1c
results
(i.e., >7%). These findings suggest that
changes in drug prescriptions for patients
with poorly controlled blood glucose levels
could be used as an indicator of health care
quality. For patients with HbA1c
over 7%,
a high proportion of those in the intensified
therapy group were prescribed a combin-
ation of drugs, indicating that these patients
were receiving adequate clinical care. In the
therapeutic inertia group, however, the
study observed that in many cases only a
single type of hypoglycaemic drug was
prescribed or the dosage remained
unchanged. Further studies are necessary
to clarify the relationship between

therapeutic inertia and efforts to maintain
glycaemic control.
