Clinical Report
The Modified Mayo Clinic
technique: Emphasis
on plausible significant
reduction of colon cancer
Yuk-Ming Mark Lui
Abstract
Objective: To compare the ability to detect colonic polyps using a modified Mayo Clinic (MMC)
barium enema technique with that of the usual gold standard optical colonoscopy (OC).
Methods: Patients considered at an average or increased risk of colorectal cancer were initially
screened using the MMC technique. Patients who refused OC, those who had isolated rectal
lesions and those with incomplete OC were excluded. Patients with mass lesions in the right colon
or left colon were further assessed using OC.
Results: A total of 142 consecutive patients were examined using the MMC technique. Of these,
18 patients were found to have mass lesions in the right or left colon and were further evaluated
using OC. Sensitivity and specificity of the MMC technique for detecting colonic polyps/cancers of
!0.3 cm were 87.5% and 80.0%, respectively. Most significantly, for detecting polyps of !1.0 cm,
the false-negative rate was 0%.
Conclusions: The MMC technique may provide an alternative screening method to OC for the
detection of colorectal polyps, particularly in countries where resources are scarce.

Introduction
When evaluating the effectiveness of an
imaging technique, the result of the detec-
tion of colonic polyps is sometimes reported
as a false-negative rate and occasionally as a
detection rate. The false-negative rate is used
when specificity cannot be obtained in a
reasonable and ethical manner, such as
when an invasive procedure is required to
confirm negative results (i.e. normality) in
the patients being studied. The sensitivity of

a diagnostic test can be deduced by sub-
tracting the false-negative rate from 1.0 (or
100%). The detection rate is the percentage
of patients confirmed to have colonic
polyp(s) out of the entire study group that
was examined. The detection rate is of
limited value if the incidence of colonic
polyps in the population of interest is not
known. However, it is very useful when
comparing the efficacy of two or more
imaging modalities in a single population
or in multiple similar populations. The false-
negative rate of optical colonoscopy (OC)
for detecting colorectal polyps was 28% in a
recent prospective multicentre study.1 There
is evidence to suggest, based on the records
at a cancer registry, that there is an even
higher false-negative rate in the right colon.2
Unfortunately, high false-negative rates
or low detection rates for detecting colorec-
tal polyps/cancers of !1.0 cm also plague
other colonic imaging modalities. For exam-
ple, computed tomography colonography
(CTC) and magnetic resonance colonogra-
phy (MRC) both have a false-negative rate
of 10­12% for detecting polyps of !1.0 cm
and a higher false-negative rate for polyps of
!0.3 cm.3,4 The false-negative rates of the
usual variety of double-contrast barium
enema (DCBE) and high-density DCBE
vary widely. DCBE is generally believed to
be the most sensitive radiological method in
detecting colonic polyps. However, a study
of a group of 104 patients, all of whom had
negative DCBE, reported that >50 sub-
centimetre polyps had been detected and
removed from the patients.5 This was indi-
cative of a false-negative rate for DCBE of
100% for the detection of colonic polyps of
0.9 cm in the patients in this study.5 In
addition, both types of DCBE are very
unpleasant procedures and are poorly toler-
ated by patients. The commonly used variety
of single-contrast barium enema (SCBE)
and high-voltage SCBE have very low detec-
tion rates for polyps of all sizes.6,7
Combined DCBE and SCBE is useful in
only a very small proportion of patients.8
Capsule endoscopy has a sensitivity of 88%
(equivalent to a false-negative rate of 12%)
for detecting colorectal polyps of !1.0 cm.9
The swallowed capsule may not be excreted
for as long as 10 h.9,10 An exception is a little
known technique used at the Mayo Clinic in
Rochester, MN, USA,11 which consists of
an SCBE with continuous fluoroscopy and
vigorous manual palpation of the colon in
the profile projection (with the hand of the
examiner for palpation inside a lead glove).
The false-negative rate of the Mayo Clinic
technique in detecting colonic polyps of
!0.3 cm in 1500 patients was 6% and the
authors reported that ``All 29 polyps 1 cm or
larger were seen on barium enema.''11 This
finding indicated a false-negative rate of 0%
for detecting colonic polyps of !1.0 cm.
In view of the recently established high
false-negative rate of OC1,2 and the draw-
backs of the other colonic imaging modal-
ities, this present study was undertaken to
test the hypothesis that whenever OC cannot
be easily or promptly undertaken, the
modified Mayo Clinic (MMC) technique
can offer a reasonable alternative for the
detection of colonic polyps.
Patients and methods
Patient population
The design of this prospective study followed
the STARD recommendations.12 Consecu-
tive patients examined at Chinatown X-Ray
& Ultrasound, Vancouver, BC, Canada were
enrolled in the study between 9 May 2012
and 13 September 2012. If necessary, trans-
lation from English to the patient's native
language was undertaken by the examiner, a
staff member or a relative who was fluent in
that language. In the first stage of selection,
all adults !18 years old at an average or
increased risk of colorectal cancers were
enrolled in the study (e.g. family history of
colorectal cancer, positive faecal immuno-
chemical test [FIT], change in bowel habits,
Lui 829
rectal bleeding, abdominal pain). No
patients had a known diagnosis of inflam-
matory bowel disease, which would be a
cause for exclusion. Pregnancy and referral
from hospitals/nursing homes/correctional
institutions were also reasons for exclusion.
Ethics permission was not applied for
because the technique (barium enema) is
firmly established and is still currently in use
in many countries worldwide. Written
informed consent was obtained from each
study participant.
Imaging technique
Patient preparation consisted of ingestion of
a clear liquid diet and oral polyethylene
glycol 3350 (ColyteÕ; Alaven Pharmaceuti-
cal, Marietta, GA, USA) colonic lavage on
the day prior to the examination. A barium
suspension of 35% W/V (E-Z-EM Polibar
Plus 105% W/V diluted with water;
E-Z-EM, Lake Success, NY, USA) was
used as the contrast medium. The fluoro-
scopic unit was a GE AdvantxÕ RF system
with a Digital Radiography System (GE
Healthcare, Milwaukee, WI, USA). This
system replaced the use of radiographic
films. Images were stored in and retrieved
from computer systems. The examination
used the MMC technique, which was an
adaptation of the Mayo Clinic technique to
make it less strenuous for the examiner.
More importantly, a limited DCBE that
mainly targeted the rectum was added,
rendering the supplementary proctoscopy
in the original technique unnecessary. The
MMC technique began with an examination
of the left colon (splenic flexure through to
the rectum). A digital rectal examination
was performed with the patient in the left
decubitus position. Barium suspension was
then administered rectally by drip infusion
to just beyond the splenic flexure. Under
intermittent fluoroscopy, meticulous inch-
by-inch deep compression with a radiology
pneumatic compression paddle was applied
to the left colon in the profile projection. The
compression is deep enough that the anter-
ior wall briefly `kisses' the posterior wall.
The sigmoid colon was also compressed in
the oblique projections. A limited DCBE
was later performed targeting mainly the
rectum (see below). For examining the right
colon (caecum through to the transverse
colon), barium suspension was further
administered to just beyond the hepatic
flexure. Inch-by-inch deep compression was
similarly applied to the right colon. In most
patients, there was insufficient barium sus-
pension in the caecum at this stage. Ancil-
lary compression of the caecum was later
performed (see below). Spot images were
obtained for documentation if lesions were
detected or for further viewing if suspicious
changes were seen. The colon was drained
briefly and air introduced until the sigmoid
was optimally distended. Intentional disten-
sion of the right colon was not undertaken.
Oblique spot images of the sigmoid were
optionally obtained. The fluoroscopic table
was tilted to just short of the upright pos-
ition and an en face spot image of the splenic
flexure routinely obtained. This was under-
taken because compressing this segment
can often be difficult. The table was then
lowered to 30 above the horizontal, ancil-
lary compression of the caecum was per-
formed in the profile and oblique
projections. The table was returned to the
horizontal position and the patient turned to
the left decubitus position. Brief fluoroscopy
was used to see if there was excess barium
suspension in the rectum. If present, the
suspension was drained and air reintro-
duced. The patient was then turned to the
prone position for overhead images. These
included a caudad angled view of the recto-
sigmoid, a cross-table lateral view of the
rectum and both decubitus views of the
abdomen with the entire rectum included in
the field of view. A postevacuation image
was obtained at the discretion of the
examiner.
830 Journal of International Medical Research 42(3)
The maximal diameters of any right or
left colonic mass lesions were obtained by
comparing with a 1.0 cm metal bar at a level
10 cm above the table top of the fluoroscopic
unit. All colonic mass lesions were measured
on the spot images. Rectal mass lesions were
measured on the overhead images. When the
lesion was seen in two or more images, the
measurement was made in the image with
the least magnification. In the second stage
of selection, patients who refused OC or
those who had isolated lesions in the rectum
were excluded from the study. Patients with
mass lesions in the right or left colon (except
the rectum) were further assessed using OC
as the gold standard. If the MMC imaging
was indicative of `carcinoma', then the sub-
sequent OC was performed within 2­3 weeks
by the gastroenterologists at either St Paul's
Hospital, Vancouver, BC, Canada or
Vancouver Hospital & Health Sciences
Centre, Vancouver, BC, Canada. If the
MMC imaging was indicative of a polyp
(irrespective of size), the OC was usually
performed within 6 months and very occa-
sionally 9 months. However, patients on the
waiting list for OC who just had a positive
FIT result waited approximately 12­15
months for their OC examination. In the
third stage of selection, patients who had an
incomplete OC were also excluded from the
analysis.
The pain level experienced by the patient
during the procedure was assessed using a 0­
10 verbal pain scale (0 ¼ no pain, 10 ¼ max-
imum pain). The level was ascertained and
recorded by the examiner just prior to
evacuation. Any complaints or positive
comments made by the patient were also
recorded by the examiner.
Statistical analyses
The detection rate of polyp/cancer of
!0.3 cm and the false-negative rate of
polyp/cancer of !1.0 cm were calculated
manually. For statistical analysis regarding
polyp/cancer of !0.3 cm, the MedCalc pro-
gram, version 13.1 (MedCalc Software,
Ostend, Belgium) was used. Diagnostic test
evaluation was undertaken using the
MedCalc program. Fisher's exact test with
Yates' correction was used to compare
frequencies. A P-value <0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 142 patients were examined using
the MMC technique. The median age was 60
years and the mean age was 61.3 years
(range 18­96 years). Forty-four (31.0%)
patients commented there was little discom-
fort and stated they were very satisfied with
the procedure. There were no complaints
from the patients about the procedure.
Twenty-six (18.3%) patients were found to
have colorectal mass lesions of !0.3 cm
using the MMC technique. Four patients
refused OC and three patients with isolated
rectal mass lesions were excluded. One
patient with an incomplete OC was also
excluded. Eighteen patients underwent com-
plete OC (Figure 1). Fourteen of these
patients were confirmed by OC to have
polyp/cancer of !0.3 cm in the colon
(excluding the rectum); this was the equiva-
lent of a 9.9% detection rate (14/142). All
seven polyps of !1.0 cm confirmed by OC
(in addition to two cancers) were detected
with the MMC technique.
It was evident that some of the right
colons had positive results and some had
negative results with the MMC technique;
the same was true for the left colons.
Therefore, a more detailed analysis of the
detection of colonic masses in the right and
left colons in 18 patients (n ¼ 36) using the
MMC technique compared with OC was
undertaken (Table 1). The mean Æ SD
size (i.e. maximum diameter) of the mass
lesions that were detected by the MMC
technique was 1.60 Æ 1.27 cm compared
with a mean Æ SD size of 1.54 Æ 1.43 cm as
Lui 831
measured during OC. It was also evident
from the data in Table 1 that there were 14
true positives and 4 false positives; there
were 2 false negatives and 16 true negatives.
The sensitivity and specificity of the MMC
technique for detecting colonic polyps/can-
cers of !0.3 cm were 87.5% (95% confi-
dence interval [CI] 61.6%, 98.1%) and
80.0% (95% CI 56.3%, 94.1%), respect-
ively. The positive predictive value of the
MMC technique was 77.8% (95% CI
52.4%, 93.5%). The negative predictive
value of the MMC technique was 88.9%
(95% CI 65.3%, 98.3%; P ¼ 0.0001). The
mean fluoroscopic time for the MMC tech-
nique was 3.1 min and the mean number of
images (spots and overheads) was 12.7 per
patient for the entire patient group
(n ¼ 142). There were no complications or
adverse events reported during the MMC
technique. All patients had a preparation
time of 1 day. The recuperation time was
negligible. The median pain level was 1 and
the mean pain level was 1.2 (range 0­6) on
the verbal pain scale, as reported by the
entire group of 142 patients. Incidentally,
approximately 15% of the patients had a
sigmoid loop that resembled a four-leaf
clover rather than a letter S.

colorectal cancers.15 It has been estimated
that it takes 5 years for normal colon to
develop a precancerous polyp and 5 more
years for it to develop into invasive cancer.16
The long time-interval suggests that colon
cancer can be prevented by locating the
colonic polyps followed by removal at a time
before degeneration into invasive cancer.
The size of the colonic polyp is a major
factor associated with malignant poten-
tial.17,18 If the location, size and shape
(sessile or pedunculated) of a colonic polyp
are clearly defined with an imaging method
that has a low false-negative rate, this can
facilitate the selection of the most appropri-
ate diagnostic or interventional procedure as
well as the most fitting time for the patient.
An optimal imaging method should have the
following qualities: (i) false-negative rate of
0% for detecting polyps/cancers of !1.0 cm;
(ii) low cost; (iii) low complication rate; (iv)
short preparation time; (v) no parenteral
medication/contrast agent required; (vi) no
or low radiation; (vii) short recuperation
time; (viii) low levels of discomfort; (ix) well
tolerated by patients; and (x) it can be easily
mastered by junior doctors (i.e. radiology
residents).
In the present study, the false-negative
rate of the MMC technique for detecting
colonic polyps of !1.0 cm was 0% in
patients in whom their right and left colons
were further scrutinized by OC. Thus, the
previously reported false-negative rate of

0% for detecting colonic polyps of !1.0 cm
using the original Mayo Clinic technique has
been reproduced with the MMC technique
used in the present study.11 The detection
rate of the MMC technique was somewhat
lower than the much acclaimed detection
rate of 12.5% (3101/24 783 patients)
achieved using the Malmo
¨ technique,
which was identical to the incidence of
polyps/cancer determined at autopsy by a
study undertaken in Malmo
¨ , Sweden.19
However, the four patients who refused
OC in the present study may have had
polyp/cancer of !0.3 cm. Taking the sensi-
tivity of the MMC technique of 87.5% into
consideration (87.5% of four patient-
s ¼ 3.5), the calculated detection rate is
12.3% (i.e. [14 þ3.5]/142). This is compar-
able with that of the Malmo
¨ technique.19
The estimated total cost of the MMC
technique is about one-eighth of OC and
about one-fifth of CTC in British Columbia;
the actual total cost is not known as the
technical component of the fees paid to the
local hospitals by the healthcare system is
not published and is not readily accessible.
OC, CTC, MRC and capsule endoscopy
may require a 2- or 3-day preparation time,
whereas a 1-day preparation is adequate for
the MMC technique. There is often excess
fluid in the colon after oral polyethylene
glycol 3350 lavage.20,21 Excess fluid in the
colon adversely affects imaging examin-
ations of the colon except dark-lumen
MRC4 and the MMC technique. On the
contrary, excess fluid decreases the density of
the barium suspension in the right colon and
tends to lessen the effort required in examin-
ing the caecum and ascending colon. No
intravenous contrast or parenteral medica-
tion is necessary for the MMC technique.
The radiation dose is estimated to be com-
parable with or lower than low-dose 64-slide
CTC. It is common knowledge that some
patients find colonic examinations unpleas-
ant. Only rarely do they voice satisfaction
about the test. The low score in the verbal
pain scale and the large number of patients
who related positive comments about the
examination provided strong evidence that
the discomfort level was low and the test was
well tolerated by the patients examined using
the MMC technique in this present study.
The MMC technique can easily be mastered
by radiology residents. Many of the exam-
inations using the original Mayo Clinic
technique were performed by radiology resi-
dents. Technically, the MMC technique
should be far easier to master than the
commonly used DCBE or high-density
DCBE. In addition, the MMC technique
may well be the present-day answer to the
question ­ What next? ­ posed in 2008 by
Rex (Indianapolis, IN, USA).22 The ultimate
imaging test for colonic polyp/cancer in the
future may be a variety of positron emission
tomography/magnetic resonance imaging
scan, but the radionuclide will need to have
a suitable half-life and be able to enhance
adenomatous polyps and carcinoids with-
out enhancing normal colonic mucosa
or inflammatory polyps; hyperplastic and
hamartomatous polyps are enhanced
only if high-grade dysplasia is present.
However, the time required to develop a
radionuclide with these properties may be
!50 years.
In conclusion, the MMC technique may
provide an alternative screening method for
the detection of colorectal polyps. This may
be advantageous where there are ever-
increasing healthcare costs and long waiting
lists for OC, as in Canada, as well as in
developing countries where there is a paucity
of gastroenterologists and CT scanners.
Further studies are required, but if a com-
parable false-negative rate for detecting
colonic polyps of !1.0 cm can be repro-
duced consistently, then the widespread use
of this technique might plausibly bring
about a significant reduction in the number
of deaths from colon cancer in North
America, and perhaps in developing coun-
tries as well.
