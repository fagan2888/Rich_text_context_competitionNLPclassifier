Abstract
White matter injury has been frequently reported in HIVþ patients. Previous studies showed that HIV-1 Tat (transactivator of
transcription), a viral protein that is produced and secreted by HIV-infected cells, is toxic to young, immature oligodendro-
cytes (OLGs). Adding Tat to the culture medium reduced the viability of immature OLGs, and the surviving OLGs exhibited
reduced process networks. OLGs produce and secrete autotaxin (ATX), an ecto-enzyme containing a lysophospholipase D
(lysoPLD) activity that converts lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC) to lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a lipid signaling molecule that
stimulates OLG differentiation. We hypothesized that Tat affects OLG development by interfering with the ATX-LPA
signaling pathway. Our data show that Tat treatment leads to changes in the expression of OLG differentiation genes and
the area of OLG process networks, both of which can be rescued by LPA. Tat-treated OLGs showed no change in LPA
receptor expression but significantly decreased extracellular ATX levels and lysoPLD activity. In Tat transgenic mice,
expression of Tat in vivo leads to decreased OLG ATX secretion. Furthermore, co-immunoprecipitation experiments
revealed a potential physical interaction between Tat and ATX. Together, these data strongly suggest two functional
implications of Tat blocking ATX's lysoPLD activity. On one hand, it attenuates OLG differentiation, and on the other
hand it interferes with the protective effects of LPA on OLG process morphology.

Introduction
Neurocognitive complications are frequently reported
in HIVþ patients. Although combined anti-retroviral
therapy (cART) effectively blocks HIV replication in
the central nervous system (CNS) and profoundly
decreases the incidence of severe neurocognitive
impairments, such as HIV-associated dementia, roughly
50% of the HIV-infected population still develop vari-
ous forms of milder neurocognitive deficits, collectively
called HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HAND;
Ellis et al., 2007; McArthur et al., 2010). White mat-
ter injuries in HIV-infected patients are commonly
observed and have been shown to correlate to HAND
pathogenesis (Filippi et al., 2001; Archibald et al., 2004;
Pfefferbaum et al., 2007). Although cART can reduce the
viral load in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to below
detectable levels, white matter damage and HAND

persists (Yilmaz et al., 2006). This implies that toxic fac-
tors released by previously infected CNS cells may inflict
more damage than the virus itself.
One candidate factor for HIV-induced white matter
injury is the HIV-1 viral protein Tat (transactivator of
transcription), which is a key component for efficient
transcription of the HIV genome. Tat has been shown
to be continuously expressed and secreted by infected
CNS cells and can be detected in the CSF (Wang et al.,
2014) of HIV patients, even with cART (Johnson et al.,
2013). Previously, we have reported that Tat significantly
decreases immature OLG viability (Zou et al., 2015).
Moreover, Tat exposure also reduced the process net-
work formed by fine, branching processes that are typical
at this stage, suggesting that Tat may also inhibit imma-
ture OLG differentiation.
OLG development has been extensively studied and
well characterized both in vivo and in vitro. Newly
formed oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) migrate
to their targeted destination to differentiate into pre-
myelinating OLGs, which ultimately evolve into mature
OLGs and myelinate axons. It is also well established that
OLG differentiation is controlled by the fine-tuning of
both intrinsic factors, such as transcriptional control
and epigenetic regulation, and extracellular signals,
including growth factors and mitogens (Zuchero and
Barres, 2013; Mitew et al., 2014). One extracellular pro-
tein that has been shown to play a significant role in OLG
development is autotaxin (ATX), also known as ENPP2,
phosphodiesterase-Ia/ATX, or lysophospholipase
D (lysoPLD). ATX is predominantly expressed and
secreted by OLG lineage cells (Fox et al., 2003; Zhang
et al., 2014) and has been shown to promote OLG devel-
opment along the lineage via its two functional domains
(Dennis et al., 2005; Wheeler et al., 2015). The first
domain, the modulator of OLG remodeling and focal
adhesion organization (MORFO), was found to promote
the morphological maturation of OLGs (Dennis et al.,
2008). The second domain, the enzymatic lysoPLD-
active site, generates the lipid signaling molecule lysopho-
sphatidic acid (LPA; Tokumura et al., 2002; Umezu-Goto
et al., 2002; Nakanaga et al., 2010), which promotes OLG
differentiation by epigenetically regulating the expression
of OLG differentiation genes (Wheeler et al., 2015).
Since both Tat and ATX affect immature OLGs, we
hypothesized that Tat inhibits OLG differentiation by
interfering with the ATX-LPA signaling pathway. Our
studies showed that 18 hr Tat treatment led to a reduction
in OLG process network area and in expression of the
OLG differentiation genes, Ugt8 and Cnp. Although LPA
by itself did not affect OLG morphology, it protected
OLGs from Tat-induced process retraction, and rescued
gene expression down-regulated by Tat. Tat also
decreased both extracellular ATX level and ATX's
lysoPLD activity. In addition, co-immunoprecipitation
(Co-IP) indicated a potential binding between Tat and
ATX, which may account for the reduced ATX secretion
and lysoPLD activity. Together, these results suggest that
Tat may physically bind to ATX, inhibiting both ATX
secretion from OLGs and the extracellular lysoPLD
activity of ATX, and consequently, LPA signaling.
Disrupting interactions between ATX and Tat may be a
potential therapeutic strategy for protecting HIV patients
from white matter injury.
Materials and Methods
All animal procedures were performed strictly in compli-
ance with protocols reviewed and approved by the
Virginia Commonwealth University Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee (IACUC).
Transgenic Mice
For in vivo Tat expression, a Tat-transgenic mouse line
was used as previously described (Bruce-Keller et al.,
2008). In brief, expression of Tat was under the control
of a tetracycline responsive element (TRE), which initi-
ates the transcription of the tat gene once it is bound by a
protein complex formed by the reverse tetracycline trans-
activator (rtTA) and doxycycline (DOX). Both the Tatþ
mice and their TatÀ littermates were genetically engin-
eered to express rtTA under the glial fibrillary acidic pro-
tein promoter. As previously reported by our lab and
others, Tat mRNA can be detected in the CNS of Tatþ
mice within 48 hr DOX treatment (Bruce-Keller et al.,
2008). Three-month-old Tatþ transgenic mice and their
TatÀ siblings, regardless of sex, were fed with DOX-
containing chow (6 g/kg) ad libitum for 10 days.
Pharmacological Compounds
LPA (18:1; Sigma, St. Louis, MO) was dissolved in
DMEM containing 0.1% fatty acid-free bovine serum
albumin. Recombinant Tat1­86
and biotin-conjugated
Tat (biotin-Tat, ImmunoDx, LLC Woburn, MA) were
dissolved in distilled water. In the experiments involving
pharmacological compounds, vehicle controls refer to an
equal volume of the solvent that is used to dissolve the
compounds.
ATX-lysoPLD Activity Assay
ATX-lysoPLD activity was determined using a fluoro-
genic assay previously described (Ferguson et al., 2006;
Wheeler et al., 2015). In brief, primary OLG cultures
were grown in phenol-red-free media and treated with
vehicle or Tat for 18 hr before supernatants were col-
lected and concentrated (40Â) via centrifugal filters
(EMD Millipore, Billerica, MA). The concentrated
2 ASN Neuro
supernatants were then incubated with 2.5 mM FS-3 sub-
strate (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt Lake City, UT) at
37C for 4 hr. Additionally, to determine whether Tat
directly decreases ATX lysoPLD activity, conditioned
medium from untreated primary OLG cultures grown
in phenol-red-free DMEM was concentrated (40Â)
before either vehicle or Tat (100 nM) and 2.5 mM FS-3
substrate were added (Echelon Biosciences Inc., Salt
Lake City, UT) at 37C and incubated for 4 hr.
Changes in fluorescence with time were measured at an
excitation wavelength of 485 nm and an emission wave-
length of 520 nm using a PHERAstar multimode micro-
plate reader (BMG LABTECH Inc. Cary, NC.).
RNA Isolation and Real-Time RT-qPCR Analysis
Isolation of RNA from control and treated OLGs
(Tat Æ LPA) was performed as previously published
(Wheeler et al., 2015). The following unmodified mouse
gene-specific primer pairs were used:

Pgk1: (as reference gene):
forward (50-ATGCAAAGACTGGCCAAGCTAC-30),
reverse (50-AGCCACAGCCTCAGCATATTC-30)
RT-qPCR reactions with at least two technical repli-
cates per sample were performed on a CFX96 real-time
PCR detection system (BioRad, Hercules, CA) using the
iQ SYBR Green Supermix (BioRad, Hercules, CA). PCR
conditions were as follows: 95C for 3 min followed by 40
cycles of 95C for 15 s, 58C for 30 s, and 95C for 10 s.
For all primer pairs, melting curves were used to ensure
specificity. Relative expression levels were determined
using the ÁÁCT method (Livak and Schmittgen, 2001).
Western Blot
Concentration of proteins extracted from cultured OLGs
was determined using a BCA protein assay kit
(ThermoFisher Scientific, Waltham, MA). Equal
amounts of protein samples were loaded on a Criterion
precast 4% to 20% gradient SDS gel (Bio-Rad, Hercules,
CA), electrophoretically separated, and probed with anti-
bodies specific to 20,30-cyclic-nucleotide 30-phosphodies-
terase (CNPase; Abcam, Cambridge, MA). Bound
primary antibodies were detected with appropriate
IRDye secondary antibodies (1:3000, Li-COR, Lincoln,
NE), and imaged using an Odyssey Imager (Li-COR).
Protein bands (sum of CNP1 and CNP2) were quantified
using Li-COR image studio software.
Primary OLG Culture
Immature murine OLGs were cultured as previously
described (Zou et al., 2015). In brief, primary mixed glial
cells isolated from brains of postnatal day 0 to 2 mouse
pups (CD-1, Charles River Laboratory, Wilmington,
MA), irrespective of sex, were plated in Dulbecco's
Modified Eagle's Medium (DMEM; Life Technologies,
Carlsbad, CA) supplied with fetal bovine serum (10%,
Thermo Scientific Hyclone, Logan, UT), glucose (6 g/L,
Sigma, St. Louis, MO), sodium bicarbonate (0.13%, Life
Technologies), and penicillin/streptomycin (1Â, Life
Technologies). Culture medium was refreshed every
other day. At day 8, O2A/glial progenitor cells were col-
lected, as previously described (Zou et al., 2015), from the
mixed cultures and replated on poly-L-lysine coated 12-
well plates or cover slips, at a density of 250,000 cells per
well or 15,000 cells per cover slip, and incubated in
DMEM supplied with CNTF (10 ng/ml, Peprotech,
Rocky Hill, NJ), N-Acetyl Cystein (NAC; 5 mg/ml,
Sigma) and triiodothyronine (15 nM, Sigma) for 2 days
to reach immature status before further experiments.
Time-Lapse Imaging
Time-lapse imaging of individual OLGs was performed
as described by (Zou et al., 2011). In brief, OLGs were
cultured in 12-well plates for 2 days before treatment with
vehicle or Tat. Culture plates were then transferred to the
environmental chamber (37C, 5% CO2
) of a Zeiss Axio
Observer Z1 system (Carl Zeiss Microscopy, LLC,
Thornwood, NY). Individual OLGs were randomly
Wheeler et al. 3
selected and imaged hourly for 18 hr then blindly ana-
lyzed using the Zeiss Axiovision 4.8 software.
Immunocytochemistry and Image Analysis
O4 immunostaining was performed on live, unfixed cells.
All other immunostaining was performed after cells were
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde. O4 monoclonal anti-
bodies (1:20, grown from hybridoma cells in our lab;
Knapp and Hauser, 1996) were applied at room tempera-
ture for 15 min. Goat anti-mouse IgM-Cy3 (1:1000,
Millipore, Billerica, MA) was used to probe bound O4
antibodies. All LPA receptor antibodies (Anti- LPAR1
(Abcam), LPAR2, and LPAR3; Santa Cruz, Dallas, TX;
LPAR4, Alomone labs, Hadassah Ein Kerem, Israel; and
LPAR6, Acris, San Diego, CA) were applied at 1:1000 at
room temperature for 1 hr, and corresponding secondary
antibodies were conjugated to Alexa 488 (1:2000, Life
Technologies). Antibody specific to ATX (Cosmo Bio,
Japan) was also used at 1:1000 at room temperature.
The cell nucleus was stained with Hoechst 33342 dye
(1:2000, Life Technologies). Images were taken on a con-
focal microscope (Zeiss LSM 700, Carl Zeiss,
Thornwood, NY) and processed using Zeiss Zen 2010
software. OLG morphology was assessed by determining
the overall process network (total O4+ area minus the
area occupied by the cell body) as described previously
(Dennis et al., 2008), but using ImageJ software (NIH).
Evaluators were blinded to treatment groups.
Immunohistochemistry
Three-month old Tatþ and TatÀ mice, both female and
male, were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde after they
were fed with DOX-containing chow for 10 days. The per-
fused brain was dissected out and fixed with 4% parafor-
maldehyde overnight before washing three times in PBS and
immersed in 20% sucrose solution for 24hr. The brains
were then frozen in OCT compound (Sakura Finetek,
Torrance, CA), coronally sectioned at 20mm thickness,
and thaw-mounted onto Superfrost-plus slides (Fisher).
The sections were then immersed in acetone at À20C for
20min before they were washed with PBS and blocked with
PBS containing 0.5% Triton and 5% cold fish gelatin
(Electron Microscopy Science, Hatfield, PA) for 15min at
room temperature and probed with Rb anti-ATX (1:250,
Cosmo Bio, Japan) and Ms anti-APC (1:100, Millipore)
overnight at 4C. Images were taken on a confocal micro-
scope (Zeiss LSM 700, Carl Zeiss, Thornwood, NY) and
processed using Zeiss Zen 2010 software.
Co-Immunoprecipitation
Dynabeads Protein G (1.5 mg/50 ml, Life Technologies)
was first mixed with primary antibodies (5 mg):
non-specific mouse IgG (Abcam), mouse anti-V5
(Abcam), rabbit anti-biotin (Abcam), or rabbit anti-
ATX (Cayman Chemical, Ann Arbor, MI) and washed
three times with PBS at room temperature. Concentrated
supernatant (500 ml) from a COS-7 cell line or primary
OLG culture was mixed with 5 mg biotin-Tat and added
to the Dynabeads-bound primary antibodies and gently
rocked overnight at 4C. The next day, Dynabeads (with
bound proteins) were washed three times at room tem-
perature with PBS before being collected and then resus-
pended in loading buffer (2Â Laemmli buffer, Bio-Rad),
heat denatured (95C, 5 min) and loaded (40 ml/sample) to
a 4% to 20% SDS-PAGE precast gel (Bio-Rad) for
Western blotting.
Statistical Analysis
OLG process network and Western blot of CNP were
analyzed using one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc
Bonferroni's testing (Figure 2(b) and 3(b)). Gene expres-
sion (Figure 3(a), (c) and (b)) data obtained by RT-PCR
were analyzed using one-sample t test. Western blot of
intracellular and extracellular ATX in cultured OLGs
(Figure 5(b)), and quantification of ATXþCC1þ cells
and extracellular ATXþ pixels in Tat transgenic mouse
brain sections (Figure 6(b) and (c)), were analyzed using
student's t test. Autotaxin lysoPLD activity assay was
analyzed using two-way ANOVA (treatment, time) fol-
lowed by post hoc Bonferroni's testing (Figures 5(c), (d),
6(a), and 7(d)). For all statistics, a p value .05 was con-
sidered significant.
Results
Tat-Induced Decrease in Immature OLG Process
Networks Is Reversed by LPA
Immature OLGs exposed to HIV-1 Tat show significantly
decreased viability in vitro (Zou et al., 2015). In addition,
surviving cells exhibit abnormal morphology, indicating
that the differentiation of these cells is disrupted. To
investigate the effect of Tat on the morphology of differ-
entiating OLGs in more detail, immature OLGs were
treated with vehicle or Tat for 18 hr before morphological
analysis was performed. OLGs showed loss of fine,
branching processes starting as early as 4 hr following
Tat treatment, and ended up with significantly reduced
process networks after the 18 hr experimental period
(Figure 1).
Previous studies by Nogaroli et al. (2009) have shown
that the addition of LPA to maturing OLGs increased
membrane formation, and thus we examined whether
LPA could reverse Tat-induced reduction of the
OLG process network. Although the addition of 1
or 10 mM LPA seems to promote OLG differentiation
4 ASN Neuro
(Figure 2(a)), it does not affect the total process network
area of immature OLGs (Figure 2(b)). However, when
added concurrently with Tat, LPA protected cells against
Tat-induced process retraction.
Tat-Induced Reduction of OLG Differentiation Gene
Expression Can Be Reversed by LPA
We next investigated whether Tat also affects the expres-
sion of genes related to OLG differentiation such as, Cnp
(20,30-cyclic nucleotide 30-phosphodiesterase) and Ugt8
(UDP-galactose ceramid galactosyltransferase 8). CNP
expression is an early marker of OLG differentiation,
and Ugt8 is responsible for the synthesis of galactosylcer-
amide, the major myelin glycosphingolipid (Kapitonov
and Yu, 1997; Sprong et al., 1998; Marcus and Popko,
2002). An 18 hr Tat treatment significantly decreased the
expression of both Cnp and Ugt8 (Figure 3(a)). Since
LPA protects against the negative effects of Tat on imma-
ture OLG process network area (Figure 2), we further
examined whether LPA rescues the reduced gene expres-
sion in Tat-treated OLGs. Adding LPA concurrently with
Tat completely rescued the expression of Cnp and Ugt8
(Figure 3(c)). Additionally, CNP protein levels reduced
by Tat treatment could be rescued by the addition of LPA
(Figure 3(b)). OLG expression of Cnp and Ugt8 has been
reported to be regulated by the lysoPLD activity of ATX
(Wheeler et al., 2015). However, qRT-PCR analysis
showed that Atx expression itself is in OLGs not affected
by either Tat or LPA (Figure 3(a) and (c)).

stable or growing in vehicle-treated OLGs. (Arrows; Scale bar ¼ 20 mm).

Expression of LPA Receptors Is Not Affected
by Tat Treatment
Since the effects of Tat on immature OLG morphology
and differentiation gene expression can be rescued by
LPA, we hypothesized that Tat interferes with the LPA
signaling pathway. To assess the LPA receptor (LPAR)
expression profile in our system, we performed immunos-
taining with antibodies specific to different LPARs in
immature OLGs. Results revealed the presence of

networks at 18 hr. LPA at 1 or 10 mM rescued the decreased OLG process network induced by 100 nM Tat. LPA by itself at both
concentrations has no effect on OLG process networks. (***p <.001 vs. 100 nM Tat; one-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni's
test, N ¼ 4 independent experiments, !30 cells were counted for each N).

18 hr Tat exposure decreased expression of Ugt8 and Cnp but had no effect on expression of Atx. (b) Western blot showed that 18 hr Tat
treatment decreased CNP levels in immature OLGs, which was also reversed by LPA. (c) qRT-PCR showed that Tat-induced decrease of
Ugt8 and Cnp expression can be rescued by adding LPA to medium. Concurrent addition of Tat and LPA also had no effect on Atx
expression. (b: One-way ANOVA followed by post hoc Bonferroni's testing; a, c: One sample t test; *p <.05 vs. vehicle; N ¼ 4 independent

LPARs 1­4 and 6 on O4þ immature OLGs (Figure 4(a)).
Due to a lack of an effective LPAR5 antibody, we can not
verify the presence of LPAR5 in our OLG culture.
However, LPAR5 mRNA was detected (Figure 4(b)).
Furthermore, qRT-PCR performed on 18 hr Tat- or vehi-
cle-treated OLGs showed that Tat treatment had no
effect on LPAR 1­6 gene expression on immature
OLGs (Figure 4(b)).
Tat Decreases OLG Secretion of ATX and ATX
lysoPLD Activity in vitro
Since LPAR expression was not affected by 18 hr Tat
exposure, we next investigated whether Tat regulates
ATX production. Although ATX is a secreted protein,
immunostaining experiments showed that both vehicle-
and Tat-treated OLGs are ATX positive, suggesting
that a portion of ATX is retained in the cytoplasm,
which could represent the pre-pro-enzyme population of
ATX (Jansen et al., 2005; Figure 5(a)). Further studies by
Western blot showed that the total amount of ATX, col-
lected from both OLG culture media (secreted) and cells
(intracellular), was not altered by Tat treatment.
However, Tat treatment altered the distribution of ATX
by significantly increasing intracellular ATX and lower-
ing the level of extracellular ATX (secreted ATX)
when compared with vehicle treatment (Figure 5(b)).
Furthermore, media collected from OLG cultures treated
with Tat exhibited significantly decreased lysoPLD activ-
ity compared with vehicle-treated cultures (Figure 5(c)),
consistent with reduced ATX in the media. The reduction
of lysoPLD activity in Tat-treated OLG media led to a
$10% overall inhibition across all assay time points
(Figure 5(d)).

value for vehicle-treated OLGs was set to 100% (horizontal line), and values for Tat-treated cells were calculated accordingly. (One sample
t test; N ¼ 4 independent experiments).

Expression of Tat in vivo Inhibits OLG
ATX Secretion
The finding that Tat decreases extracellular ATX levels
and lysoPLD activity in vitro led to further investigation
of Tat's effects in vivo. Protein extracted from the whole
brain of Tat transgenic mice was used to assess the ATX
lysoPLD activity in vivo. There was no significant differ-
ence in ATX lysoPLD activity between Tatþ and TatÀ
mice (Figure 6(a)), suggesting that Tat expression does
not affect overall ATX expression and/or activity
in vivo. Furthermore, immunohistochemistry experiments
showed significantly increased occurrence of cells that are
both CC1þ and ATXþ (Figure 6(b) and (d)) in the brain

ATX in OLGs. Additionally, the amount of extracellular
ATX, quantified by counting ATXþ pixels (green) that
were not concurrently CC1þ (red) or Hoechstþ (blue,
nuclear), was significantly reduced in Tatþ mice (Figure
6(c)). Together, these data suggest that expression of Tat
in vivo affects OLG ATX secretion
Potential Physical Interaction Between Tat and ATX
Decreases ATX Secretion
It has been well established that Tat can cross the plasma
membrane and enter the cytoplasm of several different
cell types (Frankel and Pabo, 1988; Mann and Frankel,
1991; Fawell et al., 1994). Hence, the finding that Tat
reduces the rate of ATX secretion from OLGs, both
in vivo and in vitro, prompted the hypothesis that Tat
may interact with cytoplasmic ATX, and inhibits its
secretion. We first verified the ability of Tat to enter the
cytoplasm of OLGs. Images taken by confocal micros-
copy showed cytoplasmic localization of biotin-
conjugated Tat within 1 hr after Tat was added to the
medium (Figure 7(a)). To assess whether there exists a
potential physical interaction between Tat and ATX, we
performed Co-IP using biotin-Tat and V5-tagged ATX,
collected and concentrated from the supernatant of a
stably-transfected COS-7 cell line (Dennis et al., 2012).
As seen in Figure 7(b), V5-tagged ATX was detected in
Figure 7. Potential physical interaction of Tat and ATX. (a) biotin-Tat was added to OLG culture media for 1 hr before immunostaining
was performed. Fluorescent microscopic images demonstrated that the majority of biotin-Tat was in the OLG cytoplasm and processes.
(b) Concentrated supernatant collected from a stably transfected Cos7 cell line that secretes V5-tagged ATX was mixed with biotin-Tat,
and immunoprecipitated (IP) with antibodies specific to V5 (left panels) or biotin (right panels) and processed for Western blot (WB)
for biotin (bottom panels) or V5 (top panels), respectively. Mouse IgG with no known specificity was used as negative control. While
nothing was detected from msIgG precipitates, V5-tagged ATX was detected in anti-biotin precipitates, and vice versa. (c) Co-IP was
also performed using biotin-Tat and concentrated supernatant collected from primary OLG culture. ATX can be detected in anti-biotin
precipitates, but biotin-Tat can not be detected in anti-ATX precipitates. (d) Adding Tat to the supernatant collected from untreated
primary OLG cultures significantly decreased the ATX lysoPLD activity when compared with vehicle control (*p <.05, vs. Control;
two-way ANOVA (Tat, Time) followed by post hoc Bonferroni's test, N ¼ 4 independent experiments).

anti-biotin precipitates and vice versa. As a control for
non-specific binding, neither V5-tagged ATX nor biotin-
Tat was detected in precipitates collected using a mouse
IgG1 monoclonal isotype control (Figure 7(b)). It has
been previously reported that ATX is synthesized as a
pre-pro-enzyme, whose N-term 27 amino acid residues
are proteolytically removed before secretion (Jansen
et al., 2005). Since we used cell lines cultured in high
density to harvest supernatants with high ATX concen-
tration, and the antibody we used targets the C-term
NUC domain of ATX, the two bands with different
molecular weight ($100 kDa and $125 kDa) seen in
Figure 7(b) likely represent both the pre-pro-enzyme
and the secreted ATX. To further verify the association
between ATX and Tat in OLGs, the same Co-IP proced-
ure was performed using biotin-Tat and concentrated
supernatant collected from primary mouse OLG
cultures. ATX was detected in anti-biotin precipitates
(Figure 7(c)), indicating the existence of a potential phys-
ical interaction between ATX and Tat. Interestingly, in
the same experiment, biotin-Tat was not detected in anti-
ATX precipitates (Figure 7(c)), suggesting this interaction
may be disrupted by the binding between ATX and the
anti-ATX antibody. Additionally, when Tat or vehicle
was added to the supernatant collected from untreated
primary OLG cultures, Tat significantly decreased the
lysoPLD activity in the supernatant (Figure 7(d)).
Since this experimental paradigm bypassed any potential
effect on cells, this result suggests that Tat directly
interrupts the ATX lysoPLD activity, possibly due to
its binding to ATX.
Discussion
White matter injuries are frequently reported in HIV
patients at all stages (Gongvatana et al., 2009; Zhu
et al., 2013; Ragin et al., 2015). The mammalian adult
CNS has been known to maintain a population of OLG
precursor cells, which migrate to lesion sites upon injury
and differentiate into myelinating OLGs to replace injured
OLGs and regenerate lost, damaged myelin (Polito and
Reynolds, 2005; Kang et al., 2010; Zuchero and Barres,
2013). Interestingly, white matter injury persists when HIV
RNA is undetectable in the CSF (Yilmaz et al., 2006;
Ragin et al., 2015). Our studies presented here show that
HIV-1 Tat, which is continuously secreted by infected
CNS cells, with or without viral replication, may physic-
ally interact with ATX. This interaction inhibits the secre-
tion of ATX from OLGs and decreases extracellular ATX
lysoPLD activity and subsequently, LPA production.
Since the Tat-ATX interaction not only attenuates OLG
differentiation, but also disrupts the protective effects of
LPA on OLG process morphology, targeting this inter-
action may be a therapeutic strategy to promote recovery
of white matter injury in HIV patients.
OLG lineage cells are targets of HIV-1 Tat.
Proliferation and migration of OLG precursor cells, via-
bility of immature OLGs, morphology, and myelin-like
membrane production of mature OLGs have all been
reported to be disrupted by Tat (Hauser et al., 2009;
Hahn et al., 2012; Zou et al., 2015). Our previous studies
using doxycycline-inducible Tat transgenic mice demon-
strated that in vivo expression of HIV-1 Tat for 7 days
leads to significantly increased active caspase-3 expres-
sion in O4þ OLGs (Hauser et al., 2009). Follow-up stu-
dies by Zou et al. (2015) further showed that 3-month
expression of HIV-1 Tat in the CNS causes significantly
decreased levels of myelin proteins MBP and MAG, and
increased occurrence of abnormal myelin structures. In
this study, our initial experiments found that immature
OLGs that survived 18 hr Tat treatment exhibit a
decrease in process network area (Figure 1). It is also
plausible that Tat alters the viability of these cells at
this stage represented by process retraction (Zou et al.,
2015). Although LPA by itself does not promote process
outgrowth, it protects against Tat-induced reduction of
the OLG processes network area (Figure 2).
Previously, we have reported that early OLG differen-
tiation is regulated by gene expression changes down-
stream of the ATX-LPA signaling axis (Wheeler et al.,
2015). In this study, we found that Tat down-regulates
OLG differentiation genes, Utg8 and Cnp (Figure 3),
which can be rescued by the addition of LPA
(Figure 3), strongly supporting the hypothesis that Tat
affects OLG differentiation by interfering with the LPA
signaling pathway. Additionally, Atx gene expression
in OLGs treated with Tat or LPA was not significantly
different from control (Figure 3), indicating that the LPA
rescue of Cnp and Ugt8 gene expression was not attrib-
uted to altered Atx expression.
Since OLG Atx expression was not affected by Tat, we
next assessed whether Tat changes the expression of LPA
receptors. There are six bona fide LPARs, all of which are
found on mice OLGs, with LPAR1 being the most abun-
dantly expressed (Zhang et al., 2014). Our experiments
showed that 18 hr Tat exposure did not affect the expres-
sion of any of the known LPAR genes in OLGs. Thus, it
is highly probable that the deteriorating effects of Tat on
OLGs are mediated via altered LPA production, as a
result of decreased ATX lysoPLD activity, or an inhib-
ition in the secretion of ATX from OLGs, rather than
LPAR expression.
Tat did not affect overall OLG Atx gene expression or
overall abundance of ATX. However, our Western blot
results demonstrated a redistribution of ATX localiza-
tion, with a lower amount of extracellular ATX, and a
significantly higher amount of intracellular ATX in OLG
cultures exposed to Tat (Figure 5(b)). This suggests that
Tat may inhibit OLG ATX secretion. Accordingly, Tat-
treated OLGs showed decreased extracellular ATX
Wheeler et al. 11
lysoPLD activity (Figure 5(c)). The extracellular ATX
lysoPLD activity converts lysophosphatidylcholine
(LPC) to LPA (Aoki et al., 2008), which has been
shown to be the predominant source of extracellular
LPA. Since LPA is needed for proper OLG development,
reduced ATX lysoPLD activity may result in decreased
LPA production, thus, leading to downregulated OLG
differentiation gene expression. Hence, these results sug-
gest a novel role for Tat in limiting the secretion of ATX
from OLGs, thus reducing extracellular LPA production.
ATX lysoPLD activity was found unchanged in whole
brain homogenates of Tatþ mice (Figure 6(a)). These pro-
tein samples, however, could not distinguish intracellular
and extracellular ATX, and these data are thus in line
with our in vitro findings, which showed that Tat treat-
ment does not change overall OLG ATX expression.
Furthermore, and consistent with our in vitro results,
immunohistochemistry experiments showed that CNS
expression of Tat significantly increased the percentage
of ATXþCC1þ cells and decreased extracellular ATX
level (Figure 6(b)­(d)), suggesting that Tat reduces the
secretion of ATX from OLGs, and thus limits extracellu-
lar ATX levels.
It has been reported that HIV-1 Tat contains a mem-
brane-penetrating sequence (amino acids 48­57), which
enables it to translocate across the plasma membrane of
various cell types (Mann and Frankel, 1991); however, it
has yet to be reported that Tat can enter the cytoplasm of
OLGs. Due to the relative low affinity of most Tat anti-
bodies, we used biotin-Tat to assess whether Tat enters
OLGs and affects ATX secretion. Immunocytochemistry
and confocal microscopy showed that biotin-Tat was
found clustered in the cytoplasm and major processes
of OLGs within 1 hr after adding to the culture media
(Figure 7(a)). Both Tat and ATX have been reported to
physically interact with other cellular components such as
integrin receptors (Hausmann et al., 2011; Urbinati et al.,
2012), indicating the possibility of a protein complex
formed by Tat and ATX and other cellular components.
Alternatively and more speculatively, the crystal struc-
tures of Tat and ATX reveal that both proteins contain
cysteine-rich domains (Tahirov et al., 2010; Nishimasu
et al., 2011; Gu et al., 2014), indicating the potential
of forming intermolecular disulfide bonds. We thus
hypothesized that cytoplasmic Tat may bind ATX and
limit its secretion rate. Co-IP showed that biotin-Tat
and V5-tagged ATX precipitated together (Figure 7(b)),
indicating a potential physical interaction between Tat
and ATX. Since the V5-tagged ATX used in the Co-IP
was collected from the supernatant of a stably transfected
cell line, the concentration of ATX cannot be effectively
determined and may exceed the physiological concentra-
tion of ATX in vivo. To further validate this interaction
between Tat and ATX in OLGs, Co-IP was also
Figure 8. Proposed model for effects of Tat on immature OLG differentiation. In the CNS of HIVþ patients, extracellular Tat, produced
by productively infected cells such as microglia, enters the OLG cytoplasm and binds to ATX. This interaction between Tat and ATX may
impede ATX secretion and lead to reduced levels of extracellular ATX, and downregulated expression of OLG differentiation genes such as
Ugt8 and Cnp.

performed using ATX collected from supernatant of pri-
mary OLG culture and biotin-Tat. In this setting, we
found that ATX can be precipitated by biotin-Tat but
not vice versa (Figure 7(c)). The anti-ATX antibody we
used in this study recognizes and binds the C-terminal
fragments of ATX. It is possible that this binding may
alter the conformation of ATX, which disrupts the ATX-
Tat interaction. In this case, altered ATX conformation
may also lead to altered lysoPLD activity. Consistently,
we found that Tat significantly decreased the ATX
lysoPLD activity when added directly to the supernatant
collected from untreated OLG culture (Figure 7(d)).
Another possibility is that the Tat binding site on ATX
overlaps the antibody binding site, and thus was shielded
by the bound antibody. Further studies are required to
better characterize the binding site, affinity and stoichi-
ometry of the ATX-Tat interaction, as well as whether
this interaction requires additional adaptor proteins.
Taken together, the studies reported here suggest an
injury mechanism where HIV-1 Tat expressed by infected
CNS cells in HIVþ patients enters the cytoplasm of neigh-
boring OLGs, binds cytoplasmic ATX, and inhibits OLG
ATX secretion. Limited ATX secretion by OLGs reduces
the extracellular concentration of ATX and thereby
reduces its overall ATX lysoPLD activity and the pro-
duction of LPA, which consequently down-regulates
OLG differentiation gene expression and compromises
the protective role of LPA against Tat-induced OLG
injury (Figure 8).
