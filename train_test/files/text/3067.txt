Trends in Hospitalization Associated With
Traumatic Brain Injury

IN THE UNITED STATES, TRAUMATIC
brain injury (TBI) is associated with
the death of 51 000 people each
year, about one third of all injury
deaths.1 Traumatic brain injury is a
cause of long-term disability that an-
nually affects an estimated 70 000 to
90 000 people.1,2 Given these serious
consequences and the large number of
people affected, public health efforts to
prevent the occurrence and mitigate the
consequences of TBI have received in-
creased attention in recent years.3
Some success in TBI prevention and
treatment efforts is suggested by an
analysis of national mortality trends,
which indicates a 22% decline in rates
of death associated with TBI from 1979
to 1992.4 To our knowledge, there is no
published study describing national
trends in TBI-related hospitalizations
over a comparable period, although
comparisons of some studies in se-
lected localities suggest the rate of these
hospitalizations has declined more
steeply.5 The purpose of this study is
to describe long-term trends in TBI-
associated hospitalization in the United
States; to examine trends in the distri-
bution of these injuries by age, sex, level
of severity, and outcome; and to as-
sess the implications of these trends
with respect to public health and health
care delivery.
METHODS
To estimate annual rates of TBI-
associated hospitalization, we ana-
lyzed data collected from 1980 through
1995 by the National Hospital Dis-
charge Survey6 of the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention National
Center for Health Statistics. Each year
during this interval, the number of hos-
pitals participating in the survey ranged
from 400 to 494, and the sample size
ranged from 181 000 to 276 000 hospi-
talizations for all causes. From 1980
through 1995, the annual number of
cases of TBI identified in the sample
ranged from 1611 to 3129. These TBI
cases were identified using the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention case
definition,7 ie, all hospital discharge re-
cords that contained--in 1 or more of

tionalClassificationofDiseases,NinthRe-

Context Traumatic brain injury (TBI) is associated with more than 50 000 deaths in
the United States each year, and recent observations suggest a substantial decline in
TBI-related hospitalizations and deaths.
Objective To analyze long-term trends in TBI-related hospitalization in the United
States.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of existing data from 1980 through
1995 from the National Hospital Discharge Survey, an annual survey representing the
US general population. The number of participating hospitals ranged from 400 to 494.
Main Outcome Measures Annual rates of TBI-related hospitalization, stratified
by age, sex, severity of injury, and outcome.
Results The annual number of TBI cases identified from the sample during the study
period ranged from 1611 to 3129. Overall rates of hospitalization for TBI declined an
estimated 51%, from 199 to 98 per 100 000 per year. When analyzed by severity of
injury, mild TBIs declined most during this period, from 130 to 51 hospitalizations per
100 000 per year (61% decline; P.001 compared with intermediate and severe TBI).
The decline was greatest among those aged 5-14 years (-66%) and least among those
aged 65 years or older (-9%). The ratio of male to female rates showed little variation
during the study period (ratio, 1.8; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.6-2.0), as did the
in-hospital mortality rate (mean, 5.3 per 100 000; 95% CI, 3.6-7.1).
Conclusions Changes in hospital practices may be a major factor in the declining
rates of TBI-related hospital admissions. These practices increasingly appear to ex-
clude persons with less severe TBI from hospital admission and shift their care to out-
patient settings.

ranged from 5% to 8%, were calculated
using methods described by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics.6
To classify the severity of TBIs among
patients who were hospitalized, we used
ICDMAP-90,9 a computer algorithm
that maps ICD-9-CM diagnostic codes
to a 6-level score approximating the Ab-
breviated Injury Scale (ICD/AIS).10 We
then reclassified the ICD/AIS scores for
the head region to a 3-level scale: ICD/
AIS scores of 1 or 2 were defined as
mild, 3 as moderate, and 4 through 6
as severe. We could not perform an ex-
tensive analysis of TBI incidence by
cause of injury, because such data were
incomplete; ICD-9-CM external-cause-
of-injury codes (E codes) were pre-
sent in only 10% to 47% of cases dur-
ing the period of this study.
We used commercially available sta-
tistical software to calculate crude hos-
pitalizationincidenceratesforeachyear,
using as denominators the US Census
estimates for the national civilian popu-
lation at midyears during this interval.
Generalized variance estimation func-
tions that were provided by the Na-
tional Center for Health Statistics were
used to generate confidence intervals
(CIs) for rates. Estimated crude hospi-
talizationincidenceratesbyoutcomesta-
tus, injury severity, sex, and age by year,
aswellasaverageratesfortheentiretime
interval, are presented. We compared
2-year aggregate data from 1980-1981
and 1994-1995 to measure changes be-
tween end points of the entire time in-
terval, using z scores to test for differ-
ences in rates. To test for differences in
percent change of hospitalization rates
between categories of TBI severity, we
calculated z scores using variance ap-
proximation methods.11
To compare estimated rates of TBI-
associated hospitalization with TBI-
associated emergency department (ED)
visits, we used data collected by the Na-
tional Hospital Ambulatory Medical
Care Survey from 1992 (the first year
of the survey) to 1995.12 Because the
variance estimates associated with in-
dividual years of the survey were large,
we calculated the average annual rate
of TBI-associated ED visits for the in-
terval 1992 to 1995 using methods de-
scribed elsewhere.13 As with the analy-
sis of National Hospital Discharge
Survey data, TBI cases were identified
among National Hospital Ambulatory
Medical Care Survey records by search-
ing all 3 diagnostic fields for ICD-
9-CM codes consistent with the Cen-
ters for Disease Control and Prevention
case definition. Traumatic brain injury­
associated ED visits in 1995 that in-
cluded a computed tomography (CT)
scan evaluation of any body region were
identified by the presence of a CT pro-
cedure code in the case record. Our
analyses of National Hospital Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey data in-
cluded only those TBI-associated ED
visits that did not lead to hospital ad-
mission or death.
RESULTS
From 1980 to 1995, the estimated an-
nual incidence rate of hospitalization as-
sociated with TBI declined 51%, from
199to98per100000people(TABLE and
FIGURE 1). The rates for males, which
peaked at 260 per 100000 in 1981, were
consistently higher than the rates for fe-
males over the entire time interval. The
averageratioofmale-to-femalerateswas
1.8 (95% CI, 1.6-2.0), showing little
variation during this time. The in-
hospital mortality rate also showed little
change during this period (Figure 1),
with a mean of 5.3 (95% CI, 3.6-7.1)
deathsper100000.Externalcauseofin-
jury was identified in 27% of TBI-
related hospitalizations during this in-
terval; 13% of injuries were attributed
to motorvehicle crashes, 7% to falls, and
7% to all other known causes.
The decline in rates of TBI-related
hospitalization varied among differ-
ent age groups (Table). The decline was
greatest among persons 5 to 14 years
old and least among persons 65 years
old or older.
The incidence rate of hospitalization
for mild TBI declined significantly
(P.001) compared with the rates of
hospitalization for moderate and severe
TBI (Table and FIGURE 2). From 1980
to 1995, TBIs classified as mild de-
clined 61%, from 130 to 51 hospitaliza-
tions per 100 000 people, TBIs classi-
fied as moderate declined 19%, from 26
to 21 hospitalizations per 100 000, and

TBIs classified as severe increased 90%,
from 10 to 19 hospitalizations per
100 000. In 1995, the total number of
hospitalizations for TBI was estimated at
approximately 260 000.
For 1992 to 1995, the estimated an-
nual rate of TBI-related visits to hos-
pital EDs was 394 (95% CI, 357-430)
per 100 000 people. Among all TBI-
associated ED visits in 1995, the pro-
portion that included a CT scan evalu-
ation was 26%. Among ED visits in
1995 that were associated with TBI
without diagnosis of injury to other
body regions, 27% included a CT scan
evaluation.
COMMENT
Several factors could account for the
major decline in the estimated national
rate of hospitalizations for TBI during
the 16 years of the study period. First,
during almost the same interval (1979-
1992), the TBI-associated death rate
decreasedfrom24.6per100 000people
to 19.3 per 100 000, a development that
has been attributed in part to successes
in injury prevention, especially those
associated with motor vehicles.4 In our
study, because external cause of injury
was not consistently available in the
NationalHospitalDischargeSurveydata,
we cannot directly assess any effects of
injury prevention on trends in TBI-
relatedhospitalizationsduringthestudy
interval.Nevertheless,ifsuccessininjury
preventionweretheonlyfactorcontrib-
utingtothedecreaseinTBI-relatedhos-
pitalization, then we would expect the
decreases in rates of TBI-related hospi-
talization and TBI-related death to be
similar in proportion; we might also
expect a similar decrease in TBI-related
hospitalization rates among all levels of
injury severity. However, in contrast to
the 22% decline in the TBI-associated
death rate between 1979 and 1992, our
data demonstrate a disproportionately
greater decline in TBI-related hospital-
ization rates--51% during the interval
of this study--with the decline found
mainly among injuries of mild severity.
Second, in the United States from 1980
to 1994, the rate of hospitalization for
all causes declined 29%, suggesting a
change in hospital practices for admis-
sions.14 Inastudyofhospitalserviceuti-
lization and expenditures during this
period, a reduction in inpatient ser-
vices was associated with an increase in
outpatient services, a shift attributed to
thegrowinginfluenceofprospectivepay-
ment system reimbursement and man-
aged care.15 Thus, hospital admission
policies may now exclude a larger pro-
portion of patients with mild TBI.
Hospital admission practices for TBI
also may be affected by improved diag-
nostic technology. More frequent ED-
based CT scanning may shift treat-
ment of milder TBIs from hospital
inpatient services to outpatient ser-
vices. However, this effect may be lim-
ited, since only 26% of ED visits for TBI
in 1995 included CT scan evaluations.
A shift in TBI care toward the ED can-
not be measured directly, because
we are unable to compare rates of
TBI-related ED visits with rates of TBI-
related hospital admissions through-
out the study period. However, the esti-
mated rate of TBI-related ED visits in
1992 through 1995--approximately 1
million cases each year in the United
States--indicatesthatabout80%ofper-
sons now evaluated for TBI are not
admitted to hospitals.
The increased rate of TBIs classified
as severe runs counter to all other trends
found in these data. Three factors might
account for this phenomenon. The in-
creased number of cases classified as se-
vere may be influenced by changes in
ICD-9-CM coding practices during this
period that decreased the assignment
of nonspecific codes and increased the
assignment of codes with specific se-
verity information. Also, increased re-
liance on CT scanning and improved
imaging during this study period may
have increased the detection of trauma-
related intracranial lesions, again lead-

ing to the assignment of more specific
ICD-9-CM codes that indicate greater
severity. In addition, improvements in
trauma care during the interval of this
study may have increased the propor-
tion of critically injured persons who
survive long enough to be admitted to
hospitals, thereby increasing the num-
ber of cases classified as severe.
Our analysis has several limitations.
The accuracy of our estimate of trends
in the TBI severity distribution de-
pends on correct ICD-9-CM diagnostic
coding that is consistent over time
among all hospitals in the sample. Limi-
tationsintheaccuracyofdiagnosticcod-
ing performed in hospitals have been
noted since the beginning of this study
period.16 Furthermore, coincident with
the increased use of prospective pay-
ment systems, coding practices appear
to have evolved toward increased use of
codes denoting more specific and se-
vere diagnostic categories.17-19 How-
ever, changes in coding practices docu-
mentedduringthisperioddonotappear
sufficient to account for the very large
decline in rates of hospitalizations for
TBIs classified as mild.
Theaccuracyofourestimateoftrends
in the TBI severity distribution also de-
pends on the accurate classification of
these injuries by ICDMAP-90 soft-
ware. Misclassification of these data
would affect our estimated relative pro-
portions of TBI by level of severity more
than the trends for each level of sever-
ity, because this classification algo-
rithm is applied consistently to the data
across all years examined.
CONCLUSION
Despite a substantial overall reduc-
tion of TBI-related hospitalization rates
between 1980 and 1995, TBI contin-
ues to represent a major public health
problem that calls for the application
of more effective methods of injury pre-
vention. The shift toward treating per-
sons with less severe TBI as outpa-
tients raises additional concerns. The
proportion of those with mild TBI who
experience effects later is unknown, al-
though cognitive and emotional se-
quelae resulting in extended or long-
term disability have been reported in
a minority of cases.20-24 Our data pro-
vide no information about the num-
ber of persons seen in EDs or other out-
patient facilities with such sequelae who
may need follow-up care or evalua-
tion. Assessing these needs and ensur-
ing the availability of appropriate ser-
vices is an important function of public
health; additional studies are needed to
address these issues.
