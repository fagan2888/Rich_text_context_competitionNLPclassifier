Abstract
Prevalence of hypovitaminosis D from previous NHANES reports did not account for assay changes and drifts over time.
Thus, published NHANES reports on vitamin D status for the U.S. population were likely either over- or underestimated.
We investigated changes in vitamin D status in the U.S. using assay-adjusted serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] data
from NHANES, 1988­1994 (n = 18,641) and three cycles of NHANES, 2001­2006 (n = 23,424). Changes in geometric
mean serum 25(OH)D and prevalence estimates for various serum 25(OH)D cut points (,25, ,30, ,40, ,50, and ,75
nmol/L) were determined. From 1988­1994 to 2001­2006, geometric mean serum 25(OH)D significantly decreased by
9% in all participants, 12% in men, 14% in blacks, 16% in 12- to 15-y-old adolescents, 16% in 20- to 30-y-old adults, 13% in
nonsupplement users, and 12% in persons with BMI .80th percentile (P , 0.001). From 1988­1994 to 2001­2006,
prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,30 nmol/L increased from 5 to 10% in all participants, from 3 to 8% in men, from 22 to
38% in blacks, from 3 to 8% in 12- to 15-y-old adolescents, from 5 to 12% in 20- to 30-y-old adults, from 6 to 14% in
nonsupplement users, and from 8 to 17% in persons with BMI .80th percentile (P , 0.001). Previous NHANES reports
overestimated the increase in prevalence of hypovitaminosis D. The recent decline in vitamin D status in the U.S. is more
likely due to increased prevalence of obesity and other lifestyle changes but not to changes in milk consumption. J. Nutr.

Introduction
The NCHS7 has recently advised (1,2) that the data reflecting the
serum 25(OH)D concentrations for certain NHANES may result
in either over- or underestimates of serum concentrations due to
a drift over time in the performance of assay methodology used.
In November 2010, the NCHS released new serum 25(OH)D
data files for public use that contained adjustments for the drifts
in the assay over time. Further, the NCHS issued a data advisory
recommending that the investigators use the updated data rather
than previously available unadjusted data for all analyses of
serum 25(OH)D for NHANES 2000­2006 (2). The NCHS also
recommended that the serum 25(OH)D data from NHANES
1998­1994 be adjusted to assay changes so the comparisons
between NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2000­2006 could
be made accurately. Thus, the previously reported serum 25(OH)D
concentrations and prevalence of low vitamin D status using the
unadjusted serum 25(OH)D data were inadvertently either over-
or underestimated (3­6).
A serum 25(OH)D concentration is a widely used marker of
vitamin D status, because it is considered to be a reasonable
reflection of total body exposure to vitamin D. At this time, the
serum 25(OH)D measurement is the best estimator of vitamin D
status. Circulating 25(OH)D represents both endogenous vitamin
D synthesis in the skin upon exposure to UV-B light and dietary
intake of limited foods containing vitamin D. Serum 25(OH)D is
influenced by several other factors such as sex, age, race, behavior,
outdoor activity, adiposity, and geographical location (1, 7, 8). The
role of vitamin D in the maintenance of calcium homeostasis is well
known (8). Recently, there has been considerable interest in the
possibility of an expanded role for vitamin D in various infirmities
such as depression (9), autoimmune disease (10), metabolic
syndrome (11,12), cardiovascular disease (13­15), diabetes melli-
tus (16), hypertension (17,18), infectious diseases (19,20), and
cancer (21,22). However, strong evidence is lacking for outcomes
beyond bone health (23).
There is no consensus for what is considered an appropriate
cutoff for optimal serum 25(OH)D concentrations. Different cut
points have been used to define hypovitaminosis D, resulting in
different prevalences of hypovitaminosis D being reported. The
prevalence of hypovitaminosis D has been reported to range from

1 to 80% (3,6,24,25). Serum 25(OH)D concentrations ranging
from ,25 to ,75 nmol/L have been used in defining hypovita-
minosis D (3­5,24).
Earlier reports on the prevalence of vitamin D deficiency in
the NHANESs were based on the previously released, unad-
justed serum 25(OH)D data (3­5,24). Previously, Looker et al.
(1) reported mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations for
NHANES 1988­1994 and 2000­2004. There are several differ-
ences between our report and their report. In this study, we
report: 1) the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D using for various
cutoffs for serum 25(OH)D values, including optimal concen-
tration recommended by the IOM; 2) differences in mean serum
25(OH)D and the change in prevalence of hypovitaminosis D
between NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2001­2006 for
various subset populations, including children, adolescents, and
older adults; 3) the geometric mean serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations for NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2001­2006,
because the data were skewed; and 4) the serum 25(OH)D from
3 cycles of NHANES (2001­2002, 2003­2004, and 2005­2006)
in order to increase the precision of the serum 25(OH)D estimate
due to a larger sample size. The overall aim of this study was to
investigate changes in the serum 25(OH)D concentrations and
the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D over time using the recently
released assay-adjusted data from NHANES 1988­2006 for
various demographic characteristics of the U.S. population.
Because there has been no universal consensus on the optimal
concentrations for serum 25(OH)D for estimating prevalence of
hypovitaminosis D, we present several cut points for the purpose
of comparison and clarity in this report.
Methods
Description of surveys. The NCHS conducts large, nationally repre-
sentative, sample surveys known as NHANES on the civilian, noninsti-
tutionalized U.S. population, using a stratified, multistage, probability
sample survey design. Data on demographic characteristics, diet, and
health were collected from personal interviews. Physical examinations
and collection of blood and urine samples are performed in a MEC.
Certain groups such as low-income persons, adolescents, persons $60 y
old, non-Hispanic blacks, and Hispanics/Mexican Americans were
oversampled to yield reliable estimates for these groups. The NHANES
protocols were reviewed and approved by the NCHS Institutional
Review Board. All survey participants signed informed consent before
participating in NHANES.
Beginning 1999, NHANES were conducted as annual surveys and
data are released in 2-y cycles for public use. Prior to 1999, NHANES
were conducted as periodic surveys. NHANES 1988­1994 was
conducted between the years of 1988 and 1994. For the purpose of
this study, we used publically available data from 4 surveys: NHANES
1988­1994 (26­28), NHANES 2001­2002 (29), NHANES 2003­2004
(30), and NHANES 2005­2006 (31). The detailed description of the
survey methodologies and analytic guidelines was previously reported
(32). Briefly, the initial sample for the NHANES 1988­1994 was 36,995.
Of those, 33,994 were interviewed in their homes, 30,818 were
examined in MEC, and 493 were examined in their home, because
they were unable to come to the MEC. NHANES 2001­2002 was
conducted between January 2001 and December 2002 in 11,039
individuals (all were home-interviewed; 10,477 were examined in
MEC), NHANES 2003­2004 was conducted between January 2003
and December 2004 in 12,761 individuals (10,122 were home-
interviewed; 9643 were examined in MEC), and NHANES 2005­2006
was conducted between January 2005 and December 2006 in 12,862
individuals (10,348 were home-interviewed; 9950 were examined in
MEC). The survey response rates for NHANES 1988­1994 were 84%
for the household interview component and 78% for the examination
component, whereas the survey response rates for the examination
component for NHANES 2001­2002, NHANES 2003­2004, and
NHANES 2005­2006 were 76, 80, and 77.4%, respectively.
Periodically, NHANES data files are updated by the NCHS, re-
placing previous data files. One such update occurred very recently in
November 2010 for serum 25(OH)D data because of changes and
drifts in serum 25(OH)D assay over time. Based on the quality control
analysis conducted on surplus sera, the CDC observed shifts in the
means of serum 25(OH)D concentrations over a period of time for
NHANES 2003­2004 and NHANES 2005­2006. This variation in
serum 25(OH)D was most likely due to method variation that resulted
from reagent and calibration lot-to-lot variation. Also, the NCHS
noted that the NHANES 1988­1994 serum 25(OH)D values needed to
be adjusted to allow for the approximation of NHANES 1988­1994
results to the level of the reformulated assay used in NHANES 2000­
2006. A detailed description of this data advisory for serum 25(OH)D
for NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2000­2006 is found else-
where (2).
Description of study sample and variables. For this study, data on
the U.S. population from NHANES 1988­1994, 2001­2002, 2003­
2004, and 2005­2006 were used. NHANES 2001­2002, 2003­2004,
and 2005­2006 were concatenated into one analytic database,
NHANES 2001­2006. Serum 25(OH)D for the NHANES 1999­2000
cycle was measured only in the year 2000. However, these data are not
available publically because of a disclosure risk of confidential informa-
tion. Thus, we were unable to include serum 25(OH)D data from the
NHANES 1999­2000 cycle in this current study.
Of the 30,818 participants in NHANES 1988­1994, 11,034 were
,12 y old. These participants were excluded because serum 25(OH)D
data were not available for them. Of the remaining 19,784 partici-
pants, 1046, 74, and 23 were excluded due to missing values for serum
25(OH)D, BMI, and supplement use, respectively. Thus, the final
sample for the NHANES 1988­1994 consisted of 18,641 persons
(representative of the U.S. population, 196,208,870). Of the 31,509
total participants in the combined NHANES 2001­2006, 30,070 were
examined in the MEC. Children #1 y old were excluded from the data
analysis due to lack of a 25(OH)D measurement. Of the remaining
27,539 persons, 3567, 526, and 22 were excluded due to missing
values for serum 25(OH)D, BMI, and supplement use, respectively.
Thus, the final sample for the combined NHANES 2001­2006
consisted of 23,424 persons (representative of the U.S. population,
245,585,658).
Several variables that are known to affect serum 25(OH)D concen-
trations were included in the data analysis (1,7,8) . These were sex, race-
ethnicity, age, PIR, season of examination, use of supplements, and BMI.
Participants were categorized into 2­5 y, 6­11 y, 12­15 y, 16­19 y, 20­
30 y, 31­50 y, 51­70 y, and .70 y old age groups for the combined
NHANES 2001­2006. For the NHANES 1988­1994, the age groupings
were 12­15 y, 16­19 y, 20­30 y, 31­50 y, 51­70 y, and .70 y, because
the serum 25(OH)D concentration was not measured in children ,12 y
age. Race-ethnicity was self-reported as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Hispanic/Mexican, and others. The "other" category
included persons of mixed race-ethnicity and persons who reported their
race-ethnicity as other than non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Hispanic/Mexican. PIR is the ratio of income to the family's
appropriate poverty threshold (33). PIR values were categorized as
below poverty (,1.0), middle income (1.0­3.0), and higher income
(.3.0). Persons who had missing data for the PIR was categorized as
"not reported." To avoid damage to MEC, in all NHANES, data were
collected during summer (May 1­October 31) in the North and winter
(November 1­April 30) in the South. BMI was categorized into quintiles,
because this classification yielded relatively uniform sample sizes across
the quintiles.
To explore the possible causes for change in vitamin D status from
1988­1994 to 2001­2006, we analyzed the trends in BMI, milk
consumption, and physical activity, because these variables are known
to affect vitamin D status (1). Because BMI is inversely related to vitamin
D status (34), we used BMI as a modifier of serum 25(OH)D. BMI was
calculated based on weight and height measurements. Because milk is a
commonly consumed vitamin D-fortified food and because physical

activity may be a surrogate marker of outdoor activity and sun exposure,
we used these two variables as potential modifiers of serum 25(OH)D
(1). Due to lack of vitamin D intake data for NHANES 2001­2006, we
used milk consumption as a surrogate marker for dietary vitamin D
intake. The detailed description of dietary intake methodology was
described elsewhere (1). In the data analysis, persons who consumed
milk at least 1 time/d were regarded as milk drinkers. Milk consumption
included all milks (whole, 2%, 1%, nonfat, and chocolate) and milk used
with cereal. Participants self-reported their physical activity compared
with their peers of same age and sex. Data were recorded as more, less,
and same. In this study, we used proportion of people who reported that
their physical activity was "more" than the others of the same age and
sex as a marker of physical activity.
Description of vitamin D measurement. Blood was collected by
venipuncture at MEC according to the standard protocol. Detailed
laboratory procedures used in NHANES are reported elsewhere (35­38).
Data on serum 25(OH)D were obtained from the laboratory component
of NHANES. Centrifugation was used to separate serum after blood
samples were held at room temperature for 30­60 min. Frozen samples
were sent to the CDC from MEC (2208C) for biochemical analysis.
Serum 25(OH)D concentrations in NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES
2000­2006 were analyzed at the National Center for Environmental
Health, CDC with the DiaSorin RIA kit. The manufacturer reformulated
the DiaSorin assay kit in 1998 by introducing an antibody that provided
an improved binding and reduced the nonspecific binding by altering the
washing procedure (2). The CDC took steps to address the assay changes
between NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2000­2006 by reanalyz-
ing 150 banked samples from NHANES 1988­1994 using the
reformulated DiaSorin assay (39). These banked serum samples
represented the entire distribution of the NHANES 1988­1994 sample.

This regression equation also takes into consideration the assay drifts
occurred with the reformulated assay during 2003­2004. This adjustment
to the original NHANES 1988­1994 data allowed us to compare the data
from NHANES 1988­1994 serum 25(OH)D concentrations to the serum
25(OH)D data in NHANES 2000­2006 (2). As per this data advisory by
NCHS, in this study, we adjusted publically available NHANES 1988­
1994 serum 25(OH)D concentrations so that the comparisons between
NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2001­2006 were valid.
Statistical analysis. We used the SAS-callable SUDAAN (version
10.0.1; Research Triangle Institute) statistical software package in the
data analysis. Appropriate sample weights were used to produce
statistically reliable estimates and correct for unequal probability of
selection due to oversampling of certain subgroups (described above).
The Taylor linearization method was used to compute variance
estimates. The complex NHANES survey design was taken into account
by including masked variance pseudo-stratum and masked variance
pseudo-primary sampling units in the data analysis. SAS was also used in
conjunction with SUDAAN to manage and analyze data (version 9.2,
SAS Institute). A detailed description of sample weights and variance
estimation methods is given in the NHANES Analytic Guidelines (32).
Combining the data from 3 NHANES cycles (2001­2002, 2003­2004,
and 2005­2006) provided us more stable estimates of means of serum
25(OH)D and prevalence of vitamin D deficiency. Geometric mans were
derived, because serum 25(OH)D data were skewed. Geometric mean is
an nth root of product of individual observations (n

). It is
important to note that the data distribution is not so unusually skewed
that 90th or 10th percentile variables are meaningful. Comparisons of
geometric mean serum 25(OH)D between NHANES 1988­1994 and
NHANES 2001­2006 were performed with Satterthwaite`s approxi-
mate t tests on the logarithm transformed serum 25(OH)D values.
Percent declines in geometric mean serum 25(OH)D from NHANES
1988­1994 to NHANES 2001­2006 were calculated. The significant

and NHANES 2001­2006 was determined with approximate Z-tests for
sex, race-ethnicity, age, PIR, season of examination, supplement use, and
BMI. Serum 25(OH)D concentrations ,25 nmol/L (,10 mg/L), 50
nmol/L (20 mg/L), and ,75 nmol/L (,30 mg/L) are widely used cut
points in defining hypovitaminosis D (3,4,24,40,41). Beauchet et al. (40)
used a serum 25(OH)D concentration of ,25 nmol/L to define vitamin
D deficiency. Dong et al. (42) defined vitamin D deficiency and
insufficiency as a serum 25(OH)D concentration ,25 nmol/L and ,50
nmol/L, respectively. Recently, Vieth (43) suggested that the minimum
desirable serum 25(OH)D concentration should be 75 nmol/L. A serum
25(OH)D concentration of ,30 nmol/L was recommended by the IOM
in defining the risk of vitamin D deficiency and a serum concentration of
,40 nmol/L (,16 mg/L) is consistent with the EAR (23). In light of
various criteria in defining hypovitaminosis D, we used the aforemen-
tioned cut points and determined the prevalence estimates for the U.S.
population. Because of differing serum 25(OH)D concentrations be-
tween men and women, we also performed separate analyses for men
and women. These data are presented as Supplemental Tables 1­5.
Further, we explored the possible causes for changes in prevalence of
hypovitaminosis D by comparing BMI, milk consumption (proportion of
persons who consumed milk $ 1 time/d), and physical activity (propor-
tion of persons who reported that their physical activity was more than the
others of same age and sex) between NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES
2001­2006 with Satterthwaite`s approximate t tests/approximate Z-tests.
This analysis involving milk consumption and physical activity was
limited to adults $20 y old in the youth files of NHANES 1988­1994,
because the data for these variables are not available for persons ,20 y
old. Values are presented as geometric mean 6 SE and percent 6 SE. An
a = 0.05 was considered significant in all analyses.
Results
In this study, women comprised 52 and 51% of the sample
population in NHANES 1988­1994 and NHANES 2001­2006,
respectively. In NHANES 1988­1994, 11% were non-Hispanic
black, 13% were adolescents (12­19 y), 38% were examined in the
winter, and 40% consumed supplements. In NHANES 2001­
2006, 12% were non-Hispanic black, 11% and 12% were in the
age groups of #11 y and 12­19 y old, respectively, 41% were
examined in the winter, and 49% consumed supplements (Table 1).
Overall, the geometric mean serum 25(OH)D concentrations
decreased from 60.7 nmol/L in 1988­1994 to 55.2 nmol/L in
2001­2006 (P , 0.001). This represents an overall decline of
9%. In some subset populations, the mean decrease in the serum
25(OH)D from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006 was much higher
(Fig. 1A,B). For example, the decrease was 12.4% (from 64.6 to
56.7 nmol/L; P , 0.001) in men, 14.1% (from 40.7 to 34.9
nmol/L; P , 0.001) in non-Hispanic blacks, 15­16% (from 64
to 55 nmol/L; P , 0.001) in 12- to 19-y-old adolescents, 16%
(from 63.9 to 53.7 nmol/L; P , 0.001) in 20- to 30-y-old adults,
10.4% (from 55.2 to 49.4 nmol/mL; P , 0.001) in persons with
a PIR ,1.0, 13.1% (from 58.9 to 51.2 nmol/L; P , 0.001) in
nonsupplement users, and 12.1% (from 53.4 to 46.9 nmol/L;
P , 0.001) in persons in the highest BMI quintile (Fig. 2). Sex-
specific data for geometric mean serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tions and percent decline in mean serum 25(OH)D concentra-
tions are presented in Supplemental Table 1.
Overall, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,25 nmol/L
significantly increased from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006 (Table 2).
This increase was ;1-fold (from 2.4 to 4.7%). In some
populations, the increase in prevalence of serum 25(OH)D
,25 nmol/L was much more pronounced. From 1988­1994 to
2001­2006, percent increases in prevalence of serum 25(OH)D
,25 nmol/L were 148% in men, from 1.30 to 3.26% (P ,
0.001); 95% in non-Hispanic blacks, from 11.0 to 21.2% (P ,
0.001); 196% in 12- to 15-y-old adolescents, from 1.12 to
3.31% (P , 0.001); 148% in 31- to 50-y-old adults, from 2.26
to 5.60% (P , 0.001); 139% in nonsupplement users, from 3.75
to 7.14% (P , 0.001); and 166% in persons in the highest
quintile for BMI, from 3.30 to 8.77% (P , 0.001) (Fig. 3).
Although the changes from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006 in the
prevalence of hypovitaminosis D at the ,50 and ,75 nmol/L
concentration levels were not as pronounced, the trends were
generally toward higher prevalence of hypovitaminosis D in
2001­2006 compared to 1988­1994. Briefly, from 1988­1994 to
2001­2006, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,75 nmol/L
increased significantly in all participants, men, non-Hispanic
whites, non-Hispanic blacks, Hispanics/Mexicans, all age groups
except in persons aged $51 y old, persons of all socioeconomic
strata, persons examined in winter and summer, supplements
users and nonusers, and persons of all BMI strata (Table 2).
The prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,30 nmol/L increased
(5.1 to 9.9%; P , 0.001) from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006 (Table

1988­1994 to 2001­2006, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D
,30 nmol/L increased from ;3 to ;8% (P , 0.001) for men
(increased by 138%),;3 to ;8% (P , 0.001) for 12- to 15-y-
old children,;5 to ;12% for 20- to 30-y-old young adults,;6
to ;14% for nonsupplement users, and;8 to ;17% in persons
with BMI . 5th quintile. Also, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D
,40 nmol/L significantly increased for most subset populations
studied (Table 3), but the percent increases were not as dramatic as
that of serum 25 (OH)D ,30 nmol/L (Fig. 4). Trends in prevalence
estimates for serum 25(OH)D ,25, ,50, and ,75 nmol for men
(Supplemental Table 2) and women (Supplemental Table 3),
respectively, and for serum 25(OH)D ,30 and ,40 nmol/L for
both sexes are presented in Supplemental Table 4. Percent
increases in prevalence of hypovitaminosis D from NHANES
1988­1994 to NHANES 2001­2006 for all cut points of serum
25(OH)D concentrations (,25, ,30, ,40, ,50, and ,75 nmol/L)
are presented in Supplemental Table 5.
To analyze possible reasons for lower vitamin D status in
2001­2006 relative to 1988­1994, we determined the changes
in BMI, milk consumption, and physical activity in a selected
subset of the U.S. population (Supplemental Table 6). From

1988­1994 to 2001­2006, the mean BMI increased in all U.S.
population subsets studied (P , 0.001). During the same period,
we report that the prevalence of milk consumption ($1 time/d)
did not decline. In fact, the reported frequency of milk
consumption $1 time/d increased in non-Hispanic blacks from
1988­1994 to 2001­2006 (from 24.9 to 30.7%; P , 0.001).
Generally, the proportion of persons who reported that their
physical activity was more than their peers did not change from
1988­1994 to 2001­2006 except for non-Hispanic black and
Mexican/Hispanic populations who reported that their physical
activity was more than their peers in 2001­2006 relative to those

Discussion
Inthis study,wereport forthe firsttime,toour knowledge,the assay-
adjustedserum25(OH)DconcentrationsintheU.S.populationfrom
NHANES 1988­2006 and the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D
using various cut points of serum 25(OH)D. The previously
publically available serum 25(OH)D data were adjusted to account
for assay drifts over time (method bias and imprecision). This drift in
assayperformancewaslikelyduetolot-to-lotreagentandcalibration
variation. The CDC estimated that serum 25(OH)D in NHANES
2003­2004 and NHANES 2005­2006 were either over- or under-
estimated by ;10% (1,2,39). The adjusted serum 25(OH)D for
NHANES2003­2004waslowerandforNHANES2005­2006was
higher compared to their respective unadjusted serum 25(OH)D
values. Also, we adjusted the serum 25(OH)D for NHANES 1988­
1994 to make valid comparisons with NHANES 2001­2006. This
adjustment was necessary, because the CDC found that the serum
25(OH)DforNHANES1988­1994wereoverestimatedby;12%in
relation to the serum 25(OH)D values obtained using reformulated
assay for NHANES 2001­2006. Hence, the NCHS issued an
advisory note that the adjusted data rather than previously available
unadjusted data should be used (2). After incorporating these
mandated recommendations by the NCHS, we investigated the
changes in serum 25(OH)D concentrations and prevalence estimates
of hypovitaminosis D for various cut points of serum 25(OH)D
concentrations using these newly assay-adjusted vitamin D data.
Recent concerns regarding the increasing prevalence of hypo-
vitaminosis D in the U.S. stem from reports comparing NHANES
1988­1994 with NHANES 2001­2004 (3­6) based on the
unadjusted serum 25(OH)D concentrations. We looked to see
whether this decline in hypovitaminosis D remains consistent with
these assay-adjusted serum 25(OH)D data reported here for
various subsets of the U.S. population. Previously, using two cycles
of NHANES 2001­2004, Ginde et al. (3) reported that the overall
prevalence of hypovitaminosis D [serum 25(OH)D ,25 nmol/L]
tripled from 2% in NHANES 1988­1994 to 6% in NHANES
2001­2004. In our study, taking assay changes and drifts into
account, we report, based on a cut point of serum 25(OH)D ,25
nmol/L, an increase in the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D of ;1
time (97%) from 1988­1994 to 2001­2004. Therefore, the
overall prevalence of hypovitaminosis D (serum 25(OH)D ,25
nmol/L) was overestimated by 1-fold in Ginde et al.'s (3) study.
Also, use of unadjusted vitamin D data from NHANES 1988­
1994 overestimated the prevalence of vitamin D sufficiency as
defined by serum 25(OH)D $75 nmol/L by 46% [30.8% in our
study vs. 45% in Ginde et al.'s (3) study] (data not shown). Thus,
the decline in vitamin D status remains, but that is not as dramatic
as in previous reports using unadjusted serum 25(OH)D data.
Most recently, the IOM of the National Academies issued
DRI for vitamin D. The IOM reported that the risk of rickets,
fractures, and other skeletal abnormalities is higher in persons
with a serum 25(OH)D concentration ,30 nmol/L. The IOM
estimated that a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 40 nmol/L
was the target for a median dietary requirement for children and
adults. A serum 25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L was used
as a level that would cover the bone health needs of 97.5% of
the population. Further analysis of the available evidence for
skeletal health by the IOM indicated that an intake of vitamin D
of 400 IU/d achieves a serum 25(OH)D concentration of 40
nmol/L. Therefore, this intake level was set as the EAR. The
IOM proposed that an intake of vitamin D of 600 IU/d achieves a
serum 25(OH)D concentration of 50 nmol/L under the condi-
tions of minimum sun exposure. Therefore, the IOM set this
intake level for vitamin D as the RDA (23).
In our study, the prevalence of serum 25(OH)D ,50 nmol/L
is almost one-third (;32%) of the U.S. population (NHANES

.40% Hispanics/Mexicans are at risk of low vitamin D status
based on a cut point of serum 25(OH)D ,50 nmol/L, which
corresponds to the RDA amount of 600 IU/d. Based on the IOM

Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D in the U.S. 505

similar to the estimates reported for NHANES 2003­2006 by
the IOM in their report (overall prevalence, ;20% in this study
vs. ;19% in the IOM study) (23). Given the high prevalence of
hypovitaminosis D [serum 25(OH)D ,50 nmol/L] and given
that the average intake of vitamin D is well below the EAR of
400 IU/d (,200 IU/d) (23), it is not known if the recent marginal
increase in the RDA for vitamin D is adequate to achieve a serum
25(OH)D concentration of $50 nmol/L for the U.S. population.
What is concerning is the overall shift of the U.S. population
toward lower serum 25(OH)D concentrations in 2001­2006
compared to 1988­1994 despite accounting for assay changes
and drifts over time. A potential explanation for this is increased
prevalence of overweight and obesity in the U.S.. In this study,
we confirm that the mean population BMI significantly in-
creased from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006. It has been reported
that vitamin D is sequestered in adipose tissue, making it less
available (44). Additionally, overweight and obese children
generally engage in less outdoor activity, leading to less exposure
to UV-B radiation (44). We further explored whether the changes
in vitamin D status was due to declining milk consumption in the
U.S.. Surprisingly, we found that milk consumption did not
decrease in all subpopulations studied. In fact, in blacks, the
milk consumption increased significantly from 1988­1994 to
2001­2006. Therefore, decreased milk intake is not a likely
explanation for lower vitamin D status in 2001­2006. Further,
we found no significant decline in the proportion of persons who
reported that their physical activity was more than their peers
from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006, suggesting that the changes in
the physical activity trends would not be a potential explanation
for declined vitamin D status from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006.
Other possible explanations for the declined vitamin D status are
increased use of topical sunblock lotions (1,7,14). Sunblock
lotions of SPF 15 decrease vitamin D synthesis by 99% in dermis
(45). Looker et al. (1) reported that sun protection was one of
the contributing factors for declining vitamin D status in the U.S.
population in the past 10­15 y. We are unable to ascertain
whether increased sun protection behavior is a potential
explanation for decreased vitamin D status due to lack of data
on sun protection behavior in the NHANES 1988­1994.
In conclusion, this study presents the most accurate preva-
lence estimates for hypovitaminosis D using the newly assay-
adjusted serum 25(OH)D for a variety of cut points to define
hypovitaminosis D (3­6). To date, this is the most comprehensive
study that reports the changes in vitamin D status in various
subsets of the U.S. population. Our intent in this study is not to
endorse any one specific serum 25(OH)D cut point in defining
hypovitaminosis D but rather to present data for various serum
25(OH)D cut points for comparison and highlight the impact of
the assay adjustment on the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D.
Due to lack of consensus over the optimal serum 25(OH)D
concentration, the prevalence of hypovitaminosis D varies by the
cut point of serum 25(OH)D. Due to the cross-sectional nature of
the data, the results of this study should not be viewed in terms of a
cause and effect relationship. Although the vitamin D status
declined from 1988­1994 to 2001­2006, these decreases are not as
dramatic as originally reported using unadjusted serum 25(OH)D
data. Given the widespread prevalence of hypovitaminosis D, the
lifestyle changes leading to decreased exposure of UV-B radiation
from sunlight, and the limited presence of vitamin D in foods,
consideration should be given for supplementation of vitamin D
and/or targeted fortification of foods with vitamin D for popula-
tions who are at greater risk for vitamin D deficiency.
