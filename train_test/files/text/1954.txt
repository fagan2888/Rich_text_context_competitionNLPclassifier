Animal and human research indicates that the early environment can exert effects on hypothalamic pituitary adrenal (HPA) axis
functioning across the lifespan. Using data from the National Study of Midlife Development in the United States and the National
Study of Daily Experience substudy, we identified curvilinear relations between adult reports of parental affection in childhood
and adult diurnal cortisol rhythms. Reports of both very affectionate and very unaffectionate parental relations in childhood were
associated with flatter diurnal rhythms, suggesting potential dysregulation of the HPA axis at both extremes of family environ-
ment. Participants in the bottom tertile showed more signs of HPA axis dysregulation than those in the top tertile. We discuss
processes that may underlie these effects, with reference to the theory of allostatic load.

INTRODUCTION
Both animal and human research indicates that early life
experiences can affect health trajectories across the lifespan.
Converging evidence suggests that the hypothalamic pituit-
ary adrenal (HPA) axis may be critically involved in the
pathways that explain these relations. The HPA axis plays a
central role in managing stress. Corticotropin-releasing hor-
mone, produced in the paraventricular nuclei of the hypo-
thalamus, stimulates the secretion of adrenocorticotropic
hormone (ACTH) by the anterior pituitary, resulting in
the release of glucocorticoids from the adrenal glands (e.g.
cortisol in humans). Although these processes characterize
the normative functioning of the system, frequent and
long-lasting elevations in glucocorticoids, as occur in chron-
ically or recurrently stressful environments or which may
occur in organisms that have developed highly stress-reactive
biological stress regulatory systems, can compromise HPA
axis functioning and ultimately health; moreover, as the
system loses its resiliency in response to chronic or recurring
stress, hypocortisolism, reflecting a reduced ability of the
system to respond to challenges, may occur (McEwen,
1998). In addition to alterations in reactivity, the diurnal
rhythm of cortisol may change in response to repeated chal-
lenge. Cortisol normally rises upon awakening, declines over
the course of the day, flattening out in the late afternoon and
evening, with a rise in the later evening. Dysregulation of the
HPA axis in response to repeated challenge may be mani-
fested in a flatter diurnal pattern.
Animal research indicating life-long beneficial effects
of early environment, in particular maternal licking and
grooming following separation stress in infant rats, suggests
that these beneficial effects are mediated through the HPA
axis. Studies conducted with clinical samples in humans are
also supportive of this pathway. In a review of the effects of
childhood trauma on the neurobiology of mood and anxiety
disorders, Heim and Nemeroff (2001) concluded that early
life stress can induce long-term hyperreactivity of the CRH
system. De Bellis and colleagues (De Bellis et al., 1994) found
attenuated plasma ACTH but robust plasma cortisol re-
sponses to CRH stimulation in sexually abused girls, suggest-
ing a dysregulation of the HPA axis at the level of the
pituitary. Studies have also documented hypocortisolism in
highly stressed populations as well, perhaps as a downstream
consequence of long-term exposure to maltreatment
(Gunnar and Vasquez, 2001; Gunnar and Donzella, 2002).
That is, people exposed to the chronic stress of maltreatment
may initially respond with hypercortisolism, which eventu-
ally gives way to hypocortisolism, as the HPA axis loses its
resiliency (McEwen, 1998).
Much of the research conducted to date has examined
these processes in clinical populations or in populations at
risk for psychopathology. However, evidence is mounting
that similar, if lesser, compromise of HPA axis pathways
may be implicated in `risky families', that is, families char-
acterized by conflict, cold non-nurturant behavior, or neg-
lect, but not by trauma and abuse (Repetti et al., 2002). For
example, a study of 264 offspring from families characterized
by few positive interactions and a high level of negative
interactions found an association between a poor family en-
vironment and abnormal cortisol profiles, which led to di-
minished immunity and frequent illness (Flinn and England,

1997). Bugental et al. (2003) reported that infants who
experienced frequent maternal withdrawal had elevated
basal levels of cortisol. Granger et al. (1998) reported that
children's basal cortisol levels were associated with a family
environment high in aggression, anger and conflict. Spangler
et al. (1994) found that maternal insensitivity to her child
during play was tied to an increase in the child's cortisol
during free play. In a study of responses to laboratory
stress challenges, Taylor et al. (2004) reported that young
adult offspring from risky families were more likely to
show a flat cortisol trajectory across the stress tasks com-
pared to people from more nurturant families, who showed
a lower baseline cortisol level, an elevation in response to the
stress task, and a return to baseline following completion of
the stress tasks. In a review of the evidence, Chorpita and
Barlow (1998) reported that families characterized by low
levels of warmth and/or high levels of restrictive, controlling
parenting had offspring with disruptions in HPA axis func-
tioning in response to stress, leading to increased CRH and
hypercortisolism. As noted, the long-term pattern may be
hypocortisolism, reflected in a muted response to stress or
a flatter diurnal rhythm in response to chronic activation of
the HPA system (McEwen, 1998; see also Gunnar and
Vasquez, 2001; Gunnar and Donzella, 2002). Thus, the ef-
fects of early environment on HPA stress responses may
occur across the spectrum of early environment quality
and involve multiple parameters of the HPA axis, as well
as alterations in its functioning over time.
Much animal and human evidence suggests a linear rela-
tionship, such that a nurturant familial environment fosters
good health and wellbeing and, with increasing conflict, neg-
lect, cold and non-nurturant behavior or abuse, poor mental
and physical health trajectories. The human clinical litera-
ture, however, suggests that overly solicitous and protective
maternal or familial behavior can have adverse effects on
offspring, including a low threshold for fear, limited explora-
tory behavior, a risk of anxiety disorders, and a potential
exacerbation of psychopathology (e.g. Chorpita et al., 1998;
Whaley et al., 1999; Hudson and Rapee, 2001). Findings such
as these suggest that there may be a curvilinear relationship
between early childhood environment and adult stress re-
sponses, with signs of compromise evident at both extremes.
The HPA axis may be implicated in these relations.
HPA axis regulation is important for understanding tra-
jectories of aging across the lifespan. Dysregulation of the
HPA axis is one of the signs of allostatic load (McEwen,
1998), which is believed to represent an accelerated aging
process. That is, older adults show many of the changes
identified early in offspring from poor functioning families,
presumably because of the cumulative effects of stress across
the lifespan. To the extent that accelerated trajectories of
aging can be identified early in life and from specific
early-life indicators, such as family environment, risk factors
for accelerated aging may be better understood and health
disorders associated with allostatic load may be anticipated,
with appropriate diagnostic and preventive efforts underta-
ken with relevant populations.
The National Study of Midlife Development in the United
States (MIDUS) investigations (Midlife in the US) provide
an unparalleled opportunity to pursue the potential role of
the early environment in the functioning of the HPA axis in
adulthood. The sample size is substantial, which permits as-
sessment of potential curvilinear relationships; the childhood
family environments, as reported by respondents, range
from very warm and nurturant to abusive; and, in contrast
to much of the previous literature, the diurnal rhythm of
cortisol was assessed, making possible a fine-grained exam-
ination of HPA functioning. Accordingly, we analyzed data
from the MIDUS, which included salivary cortisol assess-
ments in a sub-study, the National Study of Daily
Experiences (NSDE).
METHODS
The MIDUS study, initiated in 1995, was designed to deter-
mine how social, psychological and behavioral factors
inter-relate to influence mental and physical health. The
first wave (MIDUS I) collected socio-demographic and
psychosocial data on 7108 Americans, aged 25­74 years,
from a representative sample of English-speaking, non-
institutionalized adults residing in the contiguous 48 states,
whose household included at least one telephone (recruited
by random digit dialing), with oversampling of five metro-
politan areas, twin pairs and siblings. Eighty nine percent of
the sample (N ¼ 6329) completed both a phone interview
and a detailed self-administered questionnaire (Brim et al.,
2004).
In the second wave of data collection (MIDUS II), a
random sub-sample also completed short telephone inter-
views about their daily experiences over eight consecutive
days and collected saliva (for cortisol assessments) on four
of the eight days, as part of the second wave of the NSDE. Of
the initial NSDE sample of 1605 participants, 1589 partici-
pants had usable cortisol and sampling time data for 6071
days. Missing data brought the final sample for these ana-
lyses to 1547.
Childhood psychosocial environment
Data on psychosocial conditions in childhood were obtained
in MIDUS I, using a combination of telephone interview and
self-administered questionnaires. This included information
on family composition, parental divorce and death, family
socio-economic status, quality of relationship with each
parent and levels of affection received from each parent.
Participants rated how much (1­4: for `not at all', `a little',
`some', `a lot') each of the following six items was true sep-
arately for each parent: `how much did he/she understood
your problems and worries', `could you confide in him/her
about things that were bothering you', `how much love and
affection did he/she give you', `how much time and attention
did he/she give you when you needed it', `how much effort
Early environment and neuroendocrine regulation SCAN (2011) 245
did he/she put into watching over you and making sure you
had a good upbringing' and `did he/she teach you about life'.
Means over the six items were computed, separately
for mother and father to create maternal affection and
paternal affection scales (Rossi, 2001; Ryff et al., 2004).
We then averaged the two to create a parental affection
variable.
Cortisol
Assessments of diurnal cortisol derive from a saliva sam-
pling protocol that included four samples per day (waking,
þ30 min, before lunch and before bedtime) on each of
4 days. Data on the exact time of each saliva sample
were obtained from nightly telephone interviews by study
staff and on a paper­pencil log sent with the collection kit.
In addition, a quarter of the respondents receive a `Smart
Box' to store their salivettes, with a computer chip that
records the time of box opening and closing. Salivettes
were frozen (at ­608C) for storing and shipping. Cortisol
concentrations (in nmol/l) were measured with a commer-
cially available luminescence immunoassay (IBL, Hamburg,
Germany).
We began with an initial NSDE sample of 1605 partici-
pants with 6383 days of cortisol data. We dropped data from
130 days when participants awoke before 4 a.m., 104 days
when the third cortisol sample was 10 nmol or more higher
than the second sample (since this might reflect a
time-recording error for one of the saliva samples or saliva
sample contamination with food), 49 days when respondents
woke after 11 a.m., and an additional 28 days for respond-
ents who were awake more than 20 h on a given day. This left
us with 1589 participants with 6071 days of cortisol data and
24 284 saliva measurements. After excluding those with miss-
ing covariate data or cortisol values outside of the normal
range (i.e. >60 nmol), we were left with a final analytic
sample of 1547 people, 5698 days and 22 052 saliva
measurements.
Covariates
Age at MIDUS II (in years), ethnicity and gender were
self-reported. Body mass index (BMI) in kg/m2 was calcu-
lated from self-reported weight and height. Participants re-
ported chronic conditions (from a list of 28 major
conditions that included heart attack, stroke, hypertension,
diabetes, cancer), and a simple count of chronic conditions
was created. Depressed affect was measured in terms of a
count of the number of `yes' responses from a list of seven
items (i.e. during two weeks in past 12 months, when you
felt sad, blue or depressed; did you lose interest in most
things; feel more tired out or low on energy than is usual;
lose your appetite; appetite increased; have more trouble
falling asleep than usual; have a lot more trouble
concentrating than usual; feel down on yourself, no good,
or worthless; think a lot about death).
Analysis
Because previous studies indicate that cortisol rhythms are
driven by time elapsed since awakening and less by clock
time (van Couter, 1990; Steptoe et al., 2003; Clow et al.,
2004; Fries et al., 2009), we examined cortisol trajectories
as a function of time since waking. Participants had been
instructed to take the second saliva sample of the day 30 min
after waking, but there was variability in actual timing of the
second sample: 6% < 25 min after waking, 30% more than
35 min after waking and 14% more than 45 min after
waking. There was more variability in the timing of the
third (pre-lunch) and fourth saliva samples (bedtime); we
exploited this variability in collection times to explore mean
cortisol trajectories over the course of the day.
We first plotted mean cortisol and mean of log (corti-
sol þ 1) over the study sample as a function of time since
waking (in 15 min intervals) to examine the general shape
of the daily cortisol trajectory. A visual comparison of the
two plots indicated that the mean log (cortisol þ 1) trajectory
has less variability around straight-line segments (than the
mean cortisol trajectory) and represented a better fit for
piece-wise linear, growth curve modeling. Accordingly, we
chose to model log (cortisol þ 1). We examined mean trajec-
tories over a series of demographic strata (including age, edu-
cation, income, race and sex), waking time (before or after the
sample median waking time, 6:40 a.m.), and bedtime (before
or after the sample median bedtime, 10:30 p.m.), to confirm
that the general shape of the diurnal trajectories did not vary
by basic demographics (e.g. age, sex) and/or waking time and
bedtime. The general form of the diurnal cortisol trajectories
and the location of inflexion points were very consistent
across these groups, with every group showing a morning
peak 30 min after waking, then a rapid decline from the
peak for 4 h, followed by a more gradual decline for 10.5 h,
and a final upturn late in the day. Accordingly, we decided to
model the diurnal cortisol trajectories by growth curves, using
four linear splines with three knots, fixed at 0.5, 4.5 and 15 h.
We used random effects models to fit the cortisol growth
curves and to study associations between the primary pre-
dictor (parental affection) and slopes of the four piece-wise
linear segments, adjusted for age (<50, 50­64 and >64 years),
gender, race (white vs non-white) and weekend day (if em-
ployed). To account for the correlation between repeated
measures of cortisol in the same individual (between 1 and
16 measurements per person), we included random effects
for the intercept (wakening value of cortisol) and all fours
slopes. To allow for correlation between members of the
same family (twin pairs and siblings), we included an add-
itional hierarchical level with random intercept.
Model-predicted intercept and slopes were used to estimate

magnitude of the daily peak, the nightly nadir, and the
total exposure over 20 h, or area under the curve (AUC).

refer to the model-
estimated mean slopes (per hour) for the four piece-wise

for all analyses, with robust error variance estimation.
In order to account for possible non-linearity in relation-
ships between parental affection and cortisol rhythms, we
initially examined rhythm parameters by deciles of affection.
Based on resulting evidence of non-linearity (with poorer
rhythms among those in the top and bottom tertiles), tertiles
of parental affection form the basis for results reported
below.
RESULTS
Table 1 provides descriptive information about the partici-
pants. The age range of participants at the time of the
MIDUS I data collection was 25­74 years, mean 48 years.
By MIDUS II, mean age was 56.8 years. There were more
women than men; the sample was largely White and rela-
tively well-educated (see Table 1). There was substantial vari-
ance in the parental affection scale (range, 1­4): mean was
2.97, s.d.: 0.65. The cutoffs for the bottom and top tertiles
were 2.58 and 3.50, respectively.
Figure 1 shows the mean of log (cortisol þ 1) in the com-
plete study sample, as a function of time since waking (in
15 min time-intervals). Inflexions occur at 0.5, 4.5 and 15 h.
In the complete sample, mean awakening value of log (cor-
tisol þ 1) was 2.67, mean slope for the morning rise was
þ0.73 per hour, mean slope for the first rapid decline
phase was ­0.238 per hour, mean decline in the afternoon/
evening phase was ­0.089 per hour, and the mean slope in
the late evening phase was þ0.030 per hour. Corresponding
mean values for peak, nadir and AUC, as predicted by the
mean growth curve model, are listed in Table 2. After fitting
the mean trajectory, the within-individual residual variance
in log (cortisol þ 1) was 0.189, between-individual random
intercept variance was 0.091, and between-family variance
was 0.043.
In the adjusted models, expected age, race, gender and
workday differences were seen (i.e. higher nadirs and AUC
in older compared to younger participants, non-whites com-
pared to whites, and men compared to women, and higher
waking and peak values on weekdays compared to weekend
days if employed)data not shown. In addition, both low
and high levels of parental affection were associated with
slower morning rise (less positive slope1
), compared to aver-
age levels of affection (see Table 3 and Figure 2). This trans-
lated to significantly lower cortisol peaks in the bottom and
top tertile of parental affection, compared to the middle
tertile (Table 3 and Figure 3). In addition, those in the
bottom tertile of parental affection also had marginally
slower decline from the peak (more positive slope2
) and
significantly slower rises in the late evening (less positive
slope4
). Thus, diurnal cortisol rhythms were flatter (less
morning rise, lower peak and less late evening rise) for
those reporting the lowest levels of parental affection, with

similar though less pronounced patterns also seen for those
in the top tertile of parental affection. These findings were
unchanged by additional controls for reports of parental di-
vorce before age 17 and childhood socio-economic status
(assessed by education level of mother and father) as well
as measures of adult chronic conditions, depressive symp-
toms and BMI.
DISCUSSION
Analyses of the MIDUS and NSDE datasets suggest curvi-
linear relationships between levels of parental affection
and several parameters of the diurnal cortisol rhythm,
namely afternoon/evening decline and late evening rise.
Specifically, respondents who reported either very high or
very low affection in childhood had flatter cortisol rhythms,
compared to those who reported moderate levels of affec-
tion. Although previous animal and human research had
suggested a potential linear relationship between familial en-
vironment and adverse changes in HPA axis functioning, the
suggestion of a curvilinear relationship is supported by the
human clinical literature on overly solicitous, overly protect-
ive maternal hovering and its impact on fear, anxiety and
exploratory behavior in offspring.
Despite the evidence for curvilinear relationships, evi-
dence of HPA axis dysregulation is more evident in the
lowest tertile of family affection than in the highest. Those
participants reporting the lowest levels of parental affection
showed diurnal cortisol rhythms that were flatter, marked by
slower morning rise, a lower peak and less late evening rise,
as well as marginally slower decline from the peak. These
findings are suggestive of a sluggish diurnal rhythm, which
may reflect hypocortisolism. Note that hypocortisolism in
response to maltreatment in childhood has been reported
by other researchers (Gunnar and Vasquez, 2001; Gunnar
and Donzella, 2002). The present study departs from those
samples in important ways, however. Specifically, the current
sample is adults, whereas previous literature has focused on
diurnal rhythms in children. In addition, the current meas-
ures focused on parental affection and support (the positive
side of parental behavior), whereas previous studies from
maltreated samples and from risky families (Taylor et al.,
2004) have focused on degrees of maltreatment (the negative
side of parental behavior). Accordingly, it is possible that the
fine-grained analysis of the effects of negative parental be-
haviors is not well-captured in the present sample, just as a
previous focus on risky families and maltreated children may
not have focused sufficiently on variability in the positive
side of parental behaviors, thus potentially explaining the
failure to find curvilinear relationships. Nonetheless, the sug-
gestion of HPA axis compromise, as reflected in alterations
in diurnal rhythms in maltreated samples, risky families, and
the present study is relatively consistent.
What are the pathways by which early family environment
may alter the functioning of the HPA axis? McEwen
(1998) proposed an allostatic load model, whereby repeated
social challenges in a child's environment disrupt basic
homeostatic processes that may lead to cascading, potentially

irreversible interactions between genetic predispositions and
these environmental factors; over time, stress exposure can
produce large individual differences in susceptibility to stress
and in biological markers of the cumulative adverse effects of
stress, including the HPA axis. As noted, these results suggest
the possibility of accelerated aging, consistent with
McEwen's (1998) allostatic load model. Consistent with
the fact that glucocorticoid receptors are found in the cells
of almost all tissues in the body (resulting in cortisol's having
a range of physiologic effects; Munck et al., 1984; De Kloet,
2004), growing evidence links dysregulations in HPA axis
regulation to a range of negative health outcomes. For ex-
ample, excessive glucocorticoid action has been shown to
have a role in the development of insulin resistance
(Phillips et al., 1998; Reynolds and Walker, 2003), and
is associated with other cardiovascular risk factors such as
central obesity (Rosmond et al., 1998) and hypertension
(Whitworth et al., 1995). Chronically higher levels of cortisol
have also been postulated to result in a reduction of cortisol's
ability to inhibit the action of pro-inflammatory cytokines
(Petrovsky et al., 1998; Kunz-Ebrecht et al., 2003). Evidence
has also begun to link greater cortisol exposure to increased
atherosclerosis (Dekker et al., 2008) with additional data
linking higher wakening cortisol and morning cortisol rise
among women with greater intima media thickness (cross-
sectionally; Eller et al., 2001) and with greater 2-year pro-
gression (Eller et al., 2005).
It may be the case that intrusive and overly solicitous fa-
milial behavior has some of these same effects.
Limitations
A limitation of the present study is the fact that adult re-
spondents reported on their childhood experiences retro-
spectively, raising concerns about the validity of reports.
However, a number of studies have established the reliability
and validity of retrospective reports of parental support and
affection (Parker, 1989; Brewin et al., 1993) and child abuse
(Dill et al., 1991). This evidence may mute concerns about
the reliability and validity of childhood reports. In addition,
we have demonstrated high levels of independent corrobor-
ation from 917 twin pairs in MIDUS for (i) reports of child-
hood events of major significance, such as divorce and
death, (ii) reports of family poverty and residential stability
and (iii) social class, with reliability in the 93­98% range
(A.S.Karlamangla et al., unpublished data).
Moreover, although recollections of childhood environ-
ment certainly include participants' internal reconstructions
of the family environment, it may be the psychological
impact of the family environment that is most important
for affecting biology. Previous research from our laboratories
and those of other investigators indicate that recalled child-
hood variables are strongly related to adult neural responses
to threat (Taylor et al., 2006a), biological variables (Luecken,
1998; Nicolson, 2004; Taylor et al., 2006b; Bloch et al., 2007;
Pollitt et al., 2007; Tyrka et al., 2008; Williams et al., 2008),
cardiovascular risk factors (Brunner et al., 1999; Karlamangla
et al., 2005; Lehman et al., 2005, 2009), coronary heart dis-
ease (Dong et al., 2004; Singh-Manoux et al., 2004), other
adult physical health conditions (Lundberg, 1997; Draper
et al., 2008; Thurston et al., 2008) and mortality
(Smith et al., 1997; Felitti et al., 1998; Tillin et al., 2008),
after controlling for age, gender and adult socio-economic
status. Thus, there is substantial evidence linking retrospect-
ive reports of childhood family environment to altered bio-
logical stress regulatory systems and to related health
outcomes.
CONCLUSION
The early environment has effects on HPA axis functioning
across the lifespan and on corresponding risks of illness. The
present study reports evidence from the MIDUS and NSDE
investigations to suggest that the relationship between par-
ental affection and the diurnal cortisol rhythm may be curvi-
linear. Adult offspring from both harsh and highly solicitous
families have flatter diurnal rhythms, suggesting that the di-
urnal rhythm of cortisol may be dysregulated at both ex-
tremes of family affection. Consistent with previous
research, however, evidence at the lower levels of parental
affection appears in this sample to be more consistently
associated with evidence of HPA axis dysregulation than at
the higher end of familial affection.
