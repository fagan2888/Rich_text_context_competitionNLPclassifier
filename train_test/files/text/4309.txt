Abstract
When searching for a target object in cluttered environments, our visual system appears to
complete missing parts of occluded objects--a mechanism known as ``amodal completion.'' This
study investigated how different variants of completion influence visual search for an occluded
target object. In two experiments, participants searched for a target among distractors in displays
that either presented composite objects (notched shapes abutting an occluding square) or
corresponding simple objects. The results showed enhanced search performance when
composite objects were interpreted in terms of a globally completed whole. This search benefit
for global completions was found to be dependent on the availability of a coherent, informative
simple-object context. Overall, these findings suggest that attentional guidance in visual search may
be based on a target ``template'' that represents a globally completed image of the occluded
(target) object in accordance with prior experience.

Introduction
A ubiquitous obstacle that the visual system encounters in object perception is occlusion. For
instance, parts of the objects in our typically complex, cluttered environments may lack a
visual stimulus correlate, because they are partly occluded by other structures--which may
make it hard to find some searched-for but partially occluded target object. To overcome this
limitation and establish continuity, amodal completion has been described as a mechanism
that fills in missing perceptual information (Michotte, Thine
` s, & Crabbe
´ , 1964/1991).

Object integration across occlusions is usually ambiguous and may, for instance, involve local
or global completion (R. J. Van Lier, Leeuwenberg, & Van der Helm, 1995). For example, as
illustrated in Figure 1, a local completion constitutes a smooth continuation of the visible
contours of the background shape behind the occluding square (Kellman & Shipley, 1991).
Conversely, global completion emphasizes global relations of the occluded object, in
particular symmetry (Buffart, Leeuwenbert, & Restle, 1981). Another alternative might
represent an occluded figure in terms of a ``mosaic,'' that is, without amodal completion.
Previous studies investigating amodal completion using visual search paradigms
demonstrated that, when observers are provided with sufficient time for encoding,
detection of a partially occluded target item relies on a completed object representation
(He & Nakayama, 1992; Rauschenberger & Yantis, 2001; Rensink & Enns, 1998). For
instance, search for a notched target disk abutting an occluding square, in an array of
complete distractor disks and squares, turned out to be relatively inefficient--suggesting
that the notched target is represented as a complete object, that is, as being rather similar
to the distractors (Rauschenberger & Yantis, 2001; Rensink & Enns, 1998). Other studies
showed that distractors in a search display bias the interpretation of a given composite target
figure (Rauschenberger, Peterson, Mosca, & Bruno, 2004), indicating that a given
interpretation of an object depends on the context within which it is presented.
However, in these studies, object completion usually results in an unambiguous

representation (e.g., a circle completed behind a square), whereas in natural scenes, occluded
objects may be ambiguous and local and global processes may lead to qualitatively different
interpretations of the very same visual input (R. J. Van Lier, Van der Helm, & Leeuwenberg,
1995). To address this issue of object ambiguity, this study investigated how different variants
of completion influence visual search for a partially occluded target.
Of note in this context, recent work has shown that visual working memory tends to
represent occluded objects in terms of globally completed wholes, rather than local
completions (Chen, Mu
¨ ller, & Conci, 2016; Chen, To
¨ llner, Mu
¨ ller, & Conci, 2018; for
stimuli, see Figure 1). A benefit of global over local completions was also reported in
studies that used an implicit primed matching task (Sekuler, Palmer, & Flynn, 1994;
R. Van Lier, 1999). Given this pattern of evidence, one might predict that visual search
for an occluded target among (occluded) distractors is likewise governed by global, but
not local, completions. This study was designed to test this hypothesis, by investigating
how various types of completion impact visual search performance. Observers were
required to detect a target among distractors in displays that either presented composite
objects (notched shapes abutting an occluding square) or corresponding simple object
variants that would correspond to global, local, or mosaic interpretations of the composite
objects (see Figure 1). To effectively enforce a given interpretation of the composite objects,
observers were provided with a consistent context of simple-object displays among
ambiguous composite object displays (Chen et al., 2016)--so as to examine whether the
various completion types would differentially affect visual search performance.
Experiment 1
Method
Participants. Sixteen volunteers (six males, two left-handed) with normal or corrected-to-
normal vision participated in Experiment 1 (mean age ¼ 20.94 years), either for payment
of E8.00 per hour or for course credits. All observers were naive as to the purpose of the
study and provided written informed consent. The experimental procedure was approved by
the ethics committee of the Department of Psychology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University,
Munich.
Apparatus and stimuli. The experiment was controlled by a Windows 7 computer, running
Matlab and Psychophysics Toolbox (Brainard, 1997). The stimuli were black line drawings
(0.2 cd/m2) against a gray background (178 cd/m2), presented on a 17-in. CRT monitor
(1,024 Â 768 pixel screen resolution, 85 Hz refresh rate). The stimulus set consisted of
composite and simple objects (see Figure 1), which was adapted from previous studies
(Chen et al., 2016; see also Plomp & Van Leeuwen, 2006; Sekuler et al., 1994). Each
composite figure included a square (2.1 Â 2.1) with a second shape positioned partly
occluded next to the square (Figure 1, composite). Every simple figure was presented in
three variants, corresponding to three possible alternative interpretations of the composite
object: global completion, local completion, and mosaic (see Figure 1, simple). Global
completions presented a symmetrical shape interpretation of the occluded object, whereas
a local completion was based on the smooth continuation of the visible parts of the occluded
shape. A mosaic figure simply presented a 2D cutout outline shape identical to the visible
part of the partly occluded figure. The widest aspect of each simple object touched the
borders of a circular region with a radius of 2.4 of visual angle. For each search display,
three, five, or seven distinct objects from the same completion condition (with a given shape
appearing up to three times in the same display) were presented randomly at nine positions
Chen et al. 3
within a circular region subtending 12.4 of visual angle. Figure 2 shows two example search
displays.
Procedure and design. Each trial started with the presentation of a central fixation cross for
500 ms. Next, participants were presented with a search display of simple or composite
objects until they responded. Their task was to search for a cross-shaped target (i.e., one
of the items displayed in Figure 1(a)), and to indicate, by pressing the left/right mouse key,
whether the target was present/absent, respectively. The target was always a variant of the
cross-shaped stimulus (Figure 1(a)), with the other three object types serving as the distractor
shapes (Figure 1(b)­(d)). Observers were asked to respond as quickly and as accurately as
possible. In case of an erroneous response, feedback was provided by presenting an
``alerting'' sign (``­'') for 1,000 ms at the center of the screen. Trials were separated from
each other by an interval of 500 ms.
The experiment was subdivided into three parts, with each part consistently displaying one
type of simple object shape representations--that is, global, local, or mosaic--in the search
displays. Thus, in each part, half of the trials presented displays consisting of one particular
type of simple objects, which were presented randomly intermixed with the other half of trials
that displayed (ambiguous) search layouts of composite objects (see Figure 2). Thereby, we
were able to enforce a corresponding interpretation of the composite (occluded) objects
within a given experimental part (Chen et al., 2016). The order of presentation of the three
parts was randomized. Within each part, the different configuration (simple and composite),
set size (three, five, or seven items) and target (present and absent) conditions were presented
in randomized order across trials. There was one initial block of 12 practice trials, followed
by 372 trials per part (yielding 1,116 experimental trials in total), with short breaks after every
124 trials in each part.
Results
The analysis of the error rates and reaction times (RTs) focused on target-present trials,
following previous search studies investigating amodal completion (Rauschenberger &
Yantis, 2001; Rauschenberger et al., 2004). Target-present trials were primarily analyzed

because they provide a match between the memory representations of the to-be-searched-for
target with one of the objects present in the display. On target-absent trials, the decision when
to terminate search when no target is found may add substantial variance to the response
times (Chun & Wolfe, 1996), which is why these trials were discarded from the analyses
presented here.
Errors. The mean overall error rate was 3.2%. Errors were examined by means of a repeated-
measures analysis of variance (ANOVA), with the factors object (simple and composite),
interpretation (global, local, or mosaic), and set size (three, five, and seven). This ANOVA
revealed main effects of object, F(1, 15) ¼ 16.41, p ¼ .001, 2
p
¼ .52, and interpretation,
F(2,30) ¼ 6.80, p ¼ .004, 2
p
¼ .31, and the Object Â Interpretation interaction was
significant, F(2, 30) ¼ 3.35, p ¼ .049, 2
p
¼ .18. Error rates were overall comparable for
simple objects (2.5%, 2.3%, and 3.5% for global, local, and mosaic shapes, respectively,
ps > .12); for composite objects, by contrast, fewer errors were made with global (4.8%) than
with local (7.7%) and mosaic (7.7%) interpretations (ps < .02). No other significant effects
were obtained (ps > .28).
Reaction times. Outliers (Æ2 SDs from the individual mean of each observer for each
completion type) and error responses were excluded from the RT analysis (overall 4% of
all trials). Figure 3(a) presents the mean correct RTs as a function of set size, separately for
all possible interpretations of the composite (left panel) and simple objects (right panel).

the mosaic (585 ms), intermediate for the local (535 ms), and fastest for the global (506 ms;
ps < .03) interpretation. For composite objects, by contrast, RTs were faster for global
(572 ms) than for local (617 ms) and mosaic (623 ms; ps < .002) interpretations, without a
difference between local and mosaic interpretations (p ¼ .59). Note that the relatively fast RTs
for the global interpretation in composite objects were nevertheless slower than the
corresponding RTs for simple global objects, t(15) ¼ 9.17, p < .0001. Finally, there was also
a main effect of set size, F(2, 30) ¼ 21.49, p < .0001, 2
p
¼ .59, revealing a 25-ms increase in RTs
from the smallest to the largest set size (ps < .018). No other effects were significant (ps > .12).
Discussion
The results of Experiment 1 demonstrate that simple-object search varied across the different
interpretations of the cross-shaped target, revealing relatively efficient search (in terms of the
mean RTs) with global followed by local and mosaic object types. This indicates that search
varied as a function of the complexity of the objects' shape, with more complex shapes
reducing the search efficiency (see, e.g., Conci, Mu
¨ ller, & Elliott, 2007, 2009). In contrast,
for composite objects, only search for the globally completed target afforded faster (and more
accurate) responses compared to local- and mosaic-type objects (even though the perceptual
input was identical in all cases). However, search for a global interpretation of the composite
object was still less efficient than search for a simple global target, which potentially resulted
from a perceptual difference between these two types of stimuli (e.g., due to the additional,
occluding square in composite objects, see Figure 1(a)). Despite these perceptual differences,
our results show that the context provided by trials presenting simple objects (in a given part
of the experiment) engendered some form of ``priming'' that affected the interpretation of the
concurrent composite objects (Chen et al., 2016, 2018; Plomp & Van Leeuwen, 2006). In line
with previous findings in a working memory task (Chen et al., 2016, 2018), priming by the
simple-object context led to an increased search efficiency for the globally completed
(composite) objects--indicating that the completion of a symmetrical global object can
facilitate search.
Experiment 2
Experiment 2 was performed to further test the above hypothesis that the simple-object
context primed search for (globally completed) composite objects--by examining whether
completion would be evident in composite objects even when no consistent context is
available. This was realized in Experiment 2 by presenting the various types of simple
objects within the same experimental part--separated from another part that presented
composite object trials. If the interpretation of a given composite object is determined
mainly by the context of simple objects prevailing throughout a block of trials (as
suggested by Experiment 1), then removing the informative context should eliminate any
benefit of completion for the composite objects in Experiment 2.
Method
Experiment 2 was essentially identical to Experiment 1. A new group of 16 right-handed
volunteers (eight males, mean age ¼ 27.06) was tested. All participants had normal or
corrected-to-normal vision and were naive concerning the purpose of the experiment.
6 i-Perception 9(4)
Simple and composite objects were presented in two separate experimental parts. In the
simple-object part, participants were asked to report the presence or absence of a cross-
shaped target, which could be either the global, the local, or the mosaic ``interpretation''
of the cross (Figure 1(a), simple) among other simple object distractors of the same
completion type for a given trial (Figure 1(b)­(d), simple). Thus, this part of the
experiment presented one of the three possible target shapes, with the particular shape
selected at random from one trial to the next. In the composite-object part, observers
searched for the composite cross (Figure 1(a), composite) among other composite
distractors (Figure 1(b)­(d), composite). Thus, for composite objects, no differentiation
between global, local, and mosaic object types was possible; accordingly, the composite
object trials were collapsed into a single condition. The experiment started with one block
of 18 practice trials (presenting either simple or composite search displays), followed by five
experimental blocks of 108 trials each within a given part, amounting to 1,116 trials in total
(as in Experiment 1). Participants were presented with the simple- and composite-object parts
in randomized order.
Results
Errors. The mean error rate was 2.4%. A repeated-measures ANOVA with the factors object
and set size revealed no significant effects (ps > .05). A subsequent ANOVA performed only
on the simple objects also revealed no significant difference among the global, local, and
mosaic interpretations (ps > .05).
Reaction times. Outliers and error responses were again excluded from the RT analysis (3% of
all trials). Figure 3(b) presents the mean correct RTs as a function of set size, separately for
the composite (left panel) and simple objects (right panel). A repeated-measures ANOVA,
with the factors object and set size, revealed main effects of object, F(1, 15) ¼ 5.29, p ¼ .036,
2
p
¼ .26, and set size, F(2, 30) ¼ 19.29, p < .0001, 2
p
¼ .56, and a significant interaction, F(2,
30) ¼ 7.09, p ¼ .003, 2
p
¼ .32. This effect pattern shows that search for the composite target
was less efficient than simple object search (mean search slopes of 16 and 8 ms/item,
respectively). Next, an ANOVA on the simple objects with the factors interpretation and
set size again revealed both main effects--interpretation, F(2, 30) ¼ 26.10, p < .0001, 2
p
¼ .64;
set size, F(2, 30) ¼ 18.64, p < .0001, 2
p
¼ .55--and their interaction, F(4, 60) ¼ 3.54, p ¼ .012,
2
p
¼ .19, to be significant. Search was less efficient for mosaic (16 ms/item) than for global
(3 ms/item) and local (5 ms/item) simple object interpretations (ps < .02).
An additional analysis compared search for the composite object target to the various
types of simple objects. This analysis revealed that composite object search was less efficient
than simple global, t(15) ¼ 3.42, p ¼ .004, and simple local, t(15) ¼ 4.32, p ¼ .001, object
search; but search for composite objects was comparable to search for simple mosaic
objects, t(15) ¼ .15, p ¼ .89, indicating a relatively inefficient search for composite objects.
Further analyses compared the simple and composite object conditions between
Experiments 1 and 2 (see Figure 3). First, for composite objects, the search slopes in
Experiment 2 were comparable to the corresponding slopes for mosaic--9 ms/item;
t(30) ¼ 1.49, p ¼ .15--and local--9 ms/item; t(30) ¼ 1.43, p ¼ .16--interpretations of
composite objects in Experiment 1, but they were higher than for the composite, global
object interpretation--5 ms/item; t(30) ¼ 2.41, p ¼ .02.
Second, for simple objects, a mixed ANOVA revealed main effects of interpretation, F(2,
60) ¼ 49.13, p < .0001, 2
p
¼ .62, and set size, F(2, 60) ¼ 30.89, p < .0001, 2
p
¼ .51, and an
interaction between the two factors, F(4, 120) ¼ 5.25, p ¼ .001, 2
p
¼ .15. Search was less
Chen et al. 7
efficient for mosaic (13 ms/item) than for global (4 ms/item) and local (4 ms/item)
interpretations, but without revealing differences between the two experiments (ps > .2). In
other words, searching for the various types of simple objects was overall comparable across
the two experiments.
Discussion
The results of Experiment 2 closely replicated the pattern of results for simple objects in
Experiment 1, showing comparable variations in search across global, local, and mosaic
object interpretations. For composite objects, search was found to be comparable to
simple mosaic objects (but less efficient than for local or global simple objects). Moreover,
the search slopes for composite objects in Experiment 2 were also comparable to local and
mosaic composite object interpretations in Experiment 1 but higher than the global
composite interpretation. This pattern suggests that without simple-object priming, no
completion occurs and search remains inefficient as a result (with search performance
essentially being comparable to the uncompleted mosaic condition). The combined results
of Experiments 1 and 2 thus indicate that a given consistent context can expedite search for
occluded objects.
General Discussion
The present results show that visual search for composite objects can be facilitated by amodal
completion. Experiment 1 revealed faster (and more accurate) search when a composite
object was interpreted as a globally completed whole, while search in physically identical
displays was comparably more inefficient in blocks associated with an interpretation in terms of
a locally completed whole or for an uncompleted mosaic object. Importantly, this effect was
obtained only when the simple-object context supported a coherent interpretation of the
composite shapes (Experiment 1); without any such informative context, searching displays
of composite objects was comparably inefficient to uncompleted mosaic objects (Experiment 2).
A potential explanation to account for the advantage of global object completions appeals
to the internal representation used to guide search, that is, some form of ``attentional
template''. Such templates are thought to hold target representations stored in visual
working memory, top-down biasing search to any objects in the visual array that match
the template (Desimone & Duncan, 1995; Humphreys & Mu
¨ ller, 1993). From this
perspective, our results would indicate that, given a predictive simple-object context, a
globally completed template representation is set up preferentially and this regular,
symmetric specification of the target then in turn expedites performance by directly
guiding focal attention to the (partially matching) target object--which, as a result of the
top-down projection, is then actually interpreted or ``perceived'' as globally completed. This
is consistent with previous findings that have established a link of object completion to
working memory processes (Chen et al., 2016, 2018) and suggests that some imagery
process completes the missing, occluded information, thereby generating an effective,
perceptually simple template (a global ``Gestalt'') that in turn expedites target detection.
Although a symmetric global target representation facilitated search, representations of
mosaic-type or locally completed targets were found not to be comparably efficient in
providing search guidance--likely because they are more difficult to construct and
maintain as a template in visual working memory.
It should also be noted that, in Experiment 2 (without consistent context), search
for composite objects was comparable in efficiency to search for the simple-object
8 i-Perception 9(4)
mosaic condition. This suggests that completion is not automatic but comes into play only
when the context consistently enforces a given interpretation of the composite object (Chen
et al., 2016, 2018; Rauschenberger et al., 2004). Contextual knowledge or prior expectations,
rather than bottom-up grouping, might therefore determine the interpretation of an occluded
object (see also Conci & Mu
¨ ller, 2014)--the implication being that amodal completion, in
fact, reflects a cognitive, rather than a perceptual, mechanism.
One potential limitation of this study is that an effect of completion was demonstrated
with a rather small stimulus set, namely, by comparing search performance for the various
types of the cross-shaped target (Figure 1(a)). That is, the observed effects might be due to
particularities of this shape configuration--where the global object interpretation (of a
symmetric cross) is more familiar than the corresponding local and mosaic variants.
Of note, however, we used the very same stimulus set in a previous study that employed
a change detection task (Chen et al., 2016). In these experiments, the target item (i.e., the
item that exhibited a to-be-detected change) varied from trial to trial, and the various
targets were also variable in terms of their familiarity. Nevertheless, a robust advantage
for the global interpretation was observed, suggesting that the current results based on
a single target shape do generalize to other shapes. Moreover, a study by Shen and
Reingold (2001) showed that more familiar search stimuli might even lead to a
reduction of search performance (relative to an unfamiliar stimulus set). This again argues
that the observed benefit for the global interpretation is not simply attributable to object
familiarity.
In summary, the present findings indicate that amodal completion operations may
enhance search by providing, in particular, a symmetric global shape representation
(template) to guide attention effectively to the target. However, global object completion
does not rely on automatic integration processes but does instead critically depend on the
search environment providing a coherent interpretational context--in line with the notion of
an experience-dependent template that represents a completed search image of the occluded
(target) object.
