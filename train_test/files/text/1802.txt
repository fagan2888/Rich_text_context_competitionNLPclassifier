Abstract
Objectives: This study seeks to determine whether perception of weight status among the
overweight has changed with the increasing overweight/obesity prevalence.
Methods: The perception of weight status was compared between overweight participants (BMI
between 25.0­29.9 kg/m2) from NHANES III (1988­1994) and overweight participants from
NHANES 1999­2004. Perception of weight status was assessed by asking participants to classify
their weight as about the right weight, underweight or overweight. Comparisons were made across
age groups, genders, race/ethnicities and various income levels.
Results: Fewer overweight people during the NHANES 1999­2004 survey perceived themselves
as overweight when compared to overweight people during the NHANES III survey. The change
in distortion between the survey periods was greatest among persons with lower income, males
and African-Americans.
Conclusion: The increase in overweight/obesity between the survey years (NHANES III and
NHANES 1999­2004 has been accompanied with fewer overweight people perceiving themselves
as overweight.
Background
In 2001, The Surgeon General's Call to Action to Prevent and
Decrease Overweight and Obesity was issued in response to
the increasing population prevalence of overweight and
obesity and the resulting public health threat [1]. At the
time of this report, the prevalence of overweight (BMI 25
kg/m2 ­ 29.9 kg/m2) and obesity (BMI  30 kg/m2)
among adults was 34% and 30.5%, respectively, based on
data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 1999­2000 [2] which reflected an
increase from the 32% who were overweight and 22.5%
who were obese during the NHANES III survey period
(1988­1994) [3]. See Figure 1. The most recent over-
weight/obesity prevalence data from NHANES in 2003­

2004 found that 34% of all adults  20 years of age were
overweight and 32% were obese [2]. Clearly we are mov-
ing in the wrong direction. Though a number of different
factors have been attributed to this occurrence, including
fewer opportunities to be physically active and increased
accessibility of food [1]; this study attempts to explore the
potential contribution of alterations in self-perception of
weight. For the purposes of this study, distorted weight
perception occurs when one perceives his/her weight to be
in a different category (underweight, overweight, just
right) than would be determined when making a compar-
ison to the NIH Clinical Guidelines on the Identification,
Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and Obesity in
Adults ­ The Evidence Report [4].
Distorted weight perception is not a new phenomenon
and is actually very well documented [5-16]. Studies in
this area have consistently found that women (regardless
of weight status category) are more likely to perceive
themselves as overweight when compared to overweight
men. Emslie et al found that among British bank and uni-
versity workers, overweight women were more likely to
perceive themselves as overweight than men [15]. This is
also clearly illustrated in a study by Inoue et colleagues
where they compared the agreement between measured
BMI and perceived weight status. They found that 55.3%
of normal weight women perceived themselves as over-
weight [16].
Caucasians are more likely to perceive themselves as over-
weight when compared to African Americans and Mexican
Americans. Overweight people of higher socioeconomic
status (SES) are more likely to perceive themselves over-
weight when compared to those of lower SES. Individuals
with BMIs greater than 30 are more likely to perceive
themselves overweight when compared to those with
BMIs between 25.0­29.9 kg/m2 [13]. This observation
appears to hold true across all races and genders.

The overweight public's failure to accurately recognize
their own overweight status prior to becoming obese may
prevent them from changing behaviors that might con-
tribute to additional weight gain. Therefore, it is impor-
tant to understand the magnitude of weight status
distortion within persons with BMI scores within the over-
weight range.
The intent of the present study was to determine if there is
a trend for more individuals observed in the "overweight"
BMI range to perceive themselves to be of "normal" or
healthy weight by comparing NHANES (1999­2004) to
NHANES III (1988­1994). This study also assessed
whether income, race and gender moderated this effect.
Methods
This study used data from NHANES III (1988­1994) and
NHANES 1999­2004. NHANES is a multi-stage, stratified
probability sample of non-institutionalized U.S. civilians,
ages 2 months and older. The survey is conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and includes
administration of questionnaires, a physical exam, and a
battery of laboratory tests. Details of the questionnaires,
the exam, and the tests have been described elsewhere
[17-20].
Analytic Sample
Adult participants ( 20 years of age) classified as over-
weight, identified by a measured BMI: 25.0­29.9 kg/m2
(NHANES III, n = 5,653, NHANES 1999­2004, n =
4,645), were included in our sample. Respondents were
excluded if they were pregnant or under the age of 20
(children/adolescents). Pregnancy status was determined
using self-reported information as well as results of the
urine test administered during the medical examination.
Measures
Height and weight were measured by trained examiners
during the extensive medical evaluation at the Mobile
Examination Center (MEC). Participants were weighed
using a scale with a digital display readout, and height was
measured using a stadiometer.
Body Mass Index (BMI) was calculated based on these
weight and height measurements and calculated as weight
(kg)/height (meters) squared. Participants were then clas-
sified as obese ( 30.0 kg/m2), overweight (25.0­29.9 kg/
m2), or normal weight (18.5 ­ 24.9 kg/m2), which is con-
sistent with the NIH Clinical Guidelines on the Identifica-
tion, Evaluation and Treatment of Overweight and
Obesity in Adults ­ The Evidence Report [4].
Weight perception was ascertained asking subjects during
the face-to-face interview if they considered themselves to
be overweight, underweight, or about the right weight.
Less than 0.01% of respondents were missing weight sta-
tus data, and these individuals were excluded from analy-
ses examining weight distortion. At the time respondents
were asked to report their weight status, they were also
told that their weight would be measured at a follow-up
session.
Poverty Income Ratio
Respondents were asked to select the category of income
that most accurately reflected their total combined family
income over the last 12 months. Reported income was
then used to develop the poverty income ratio (PIR),
which is the ratio of income to the family's appropriate
poverty threshold. Using the PIR allows income data to be
compared across various survey years. Income was catego-
rized, as suggested by NCHS, using the PIR eligibility cut
points for the United States Department of Agriculture
(USDA) food assistance programs, into the following cat-
egories: low (0.000­1.850), middle (1.851­3.500), and
high (3.501+) incomes [21]. Individuals with missing PIR
data were excluded from all income analyses. This
included 9.7% (551) overweight adults from NHANES III
and 8.6% (399) overweight adults from NHANES 1999­
2004.
Age
Non-age specific estimates were age-standardized to the
2000 Census using the standard population structure as
suggested by NCHS. For specific estimates examining age,
the following categories were used: 20­34, 35­49, 50­64,
and 65+. These categories enable exploration of how
weight perception differs across the age spectrum while
providing a sufficient number of subjects in each group.
Race/Ethnicity
NHANES participants during both survey periods were
asked to select the race and ethnicity that they most read-
ily identified with. Responses were then systematically
collapsed into the following categories of Non-Hispanic
(NH) Whites, Non-Hispanic (NH) Blacks, Mexican-Amer-
icans and Other [21,22]. Only the first three categories are
reported on in this paper.
Statistical Analysis
Analysis of the NHANES data was conducted using SAS
(version 9, SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and SUDAAN
(version 9, Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle
Park, NC) statistical software packages. To account for
unequal probabilities of selection and non-response, all
our analyses incorporated sample weights in order to pro-
vide national estimates of population proportions. Stand-
ard errors were calculated in SUDAAN based on the Taylor
Series Linearization method [23]. Analyses were con-
ducted separately for each survey period (NHANES III

1988­1994 and NHANES 1999­2004). The study popu-
lation was stratified by gender, race, age and income. T-
tests were used to assess differences between each of the
individual groups and the reference population, which
was defined as white males or white females, ages 20­34
or a PIR of 0­1.85. T-tests were also used to test differ-
ences in proportions between the two survey periods. A p-
value < 0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Sixty-two percent of measured overweight (BMI  25 kg/
m2 and < 30 kg/m2) respondents in NHANES 1999­2004
identified themselves as overweight when asked whether
they considered themselves underweight, overweight or
just the right weight compared to 68% who were asked the
same question in NHANES III (1988­1994). In both sur-
veys, the percentage of overweight females who accurately
identified their weight status as overweight was greater
than the percentage of overweight males who accurately
identified themselves as overweight. This was consistent
across all racial/ethnic and age groups. However, those in
the youngest age group (ages 20­34) in both genders
experienced statistically significantly more alteration in
perception of weight status than the older groups between
the survey years with 13% fewer males and females ages
20­34 accurately identifying themselves as overweight in
the 1999­2004 survey compared with the NHANES III
(1988­1994) survey. See Table 1.
Among both genders, Non-Hispanic blacks were least
likely to perceive themselves as overweight during the
1999­2004 NHANES survey. Less than one-third of NH
black males considered themselves to be overweight in
NHANES 1999­2004, compared to 56.4% of NH white
males. Among females for the same survey period
(NHANES 1999­2004) 59.7% of NH blacks had an accu-
rate perception of their weight status whereas 82.1% of
NH white females had an accurate perception. This repre-
sents a shift from the NHANES III (1988­1994) data,
which when compared to the NHANES 1999­2004 data
shows that fewer Non-Hispanic Blacks (males and
females), fewer Non-Hispanic Whites (males and
females) and fewer Mexican American males accurately
perceive their weight status in the latter survey. It is also
important to note that the weight perception of Mexican
Americans of both genders and white males did not
change significantly over the survey years. In addition
among all ethnic groups, NH blacks experienced the great-
est change in weight status perception between the survey
periods. See Table 1.
As PIR increased, the trend was for more people to cor-
rectly perceive themselves as overweight. This trend was
consistent across all racial ethnic groups. However, whites
with lower and middle PIR and blacks with lower PIR real-
ized the greatest growth in distortion between surveys
with 8%, 9% and 18% (respectively) fewer persons accu-
rately identifying themselves as overweight (p < 0.05).
Mexican Americans with lower PIR were more likely than
their NH black counterparts and less likely than NH
whites of the same income level to perceive themselves
overweight. However, there was an insignificant differ-
ence across survey years for the low income Mexican
Americans. See Table 2.

Discussion
The intent of the present study was to determine if the
increasing population prevalence of overweight and obes-
ity has been accompanied by a trend for fewer individuals
categorized in the "overweight" BMI range to perceive
themselves to be overweight when comparing NHANES
(1999­2004) to NHANES III (1988­1994). The results of
the study clearly show that fewer overweight people with
BMIs within the overweight range identified themselves as
overweight in the 1999­2004 NHANES Survey than did
in the NHANES III survey. In order to gain a better under-
standing of the degree of distortion along the BMI contin-
uum, an ad hoc analysis was conducted to examine the
shift in weight perception among males and females with
a BMI of 25.0­<27.5 compared to those with a BMI of
27.5­<30 between NHANES (1988­1994) III and
NHANES 1999­2004. In both males and females, there
was a statistically significant decrease in the number of
overweight adults with an accurate weight perception
among those with a BMI of 25.0­<27.5 (p = 0.004 and p
< 001 respectively). While individuals in the higher BMI
category (BMI 27.5­<30) experienced a decrease in accu-
rate weight perception, this difference was not statistically
significant. Among the individuals with a BMI greater
than 30, there was no change in perception across survey
periods. The majority of males and females with a BMI
above 30 are aware that they are overweight (87.0% and
95.5% respectively). The shift at lower BMI levels suggests
the perception of a healthy weight is expanding to include
those who are mildly overweight.
The findings of our study are consistent with those found
in a 2006 Pew research survey where 9 in 10 Americans
acknowledge that there is a weight problem in this coun-
try and 7 in 10 acknowledge that their family and friends
have a problem, yet only 4 in 10 say they themselves are
overweight. Within the same survey 51% of respondents
whose reports of their own height and weight would
result in them being classified as overweight perceived
themselves to be just right [24]. The findings suggest that
while people seemingly understand the concept of over-
weight, the slide rule by which they conceptually estimate
their own weight status is skewed. This observation may
contribute to the continued increase in prevalence of
obesity. More research is needed to help us understand
not only the reasons for the distorted perception but also
the potential impact.
Conclusion
The results of this study speak to the need to increase the
awareness of the public's perception of weight status. As
the weight status perception becomes more distorted it
lessens the likelihood that individuals will make the rec-
ommended behavioral changes necessary to realize the
health benefits associated with even small weight loss.
