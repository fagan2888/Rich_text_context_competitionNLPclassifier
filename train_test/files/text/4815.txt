AND ITS NEUROENDOCRINE REGULATION: DOSE­RESPONSE
RELATIONSHIP AND PATHOPHYSIOLOGICAL IMPLICATIONS

2 Cellular activities are regulated by intracellular signals initiated by stimulation from the external
and internal environments. Different signal pathways are involved in the initiation of different
cellular functions. In connection with cell proliferation in response to mitogenic stimulation, the
dose­effect relationship of the magnitude of 3H-TdR incorporation into lymphocytes after exposure
to different concentrations of concanavalin A (Con A) showed an inverted U-shaped curve in the
concentration range 2­30 µg/ml. In previous studies it has been observed that the stimulatory effect
of Con A (5 µg/ml) on lymphocyte proliferation was potentiated by whole-body irradiation (WBI) with
low dose (0.075 Gy) and suppressed by WBI with high dose (2 Gy). When different concentrations
of corticosterone, ranging from 10-12 to 10-7 M, were added to the Con A­stimulated lymphocytes,
low-concentration stimulation and high-concentration suppression of lymphocyte proliferation were
demonstrated. In the presence of 5 × 10 -12 M (subphysiological concentration) of corticosterone the
proliferation of thymocytes and splenic T cells in response to Con A was further up-regulated after low-
dose radiation. Low-dose radiation (0.075 Gy) caused lowering of serum ACTH and corticosterone
concentration as well as down-regulated transcription of the hypothalamic proopiomelanocortin gene.
The present paper intends to show that multiple neurohormonal factors, including the pineal gland
and neurotransmitters, in addition to the hypothalamic­pituitary­adrenocortical axis, are involved
in the stimulation of immune responses induced by low-dose ionizing radiation. The complex nature
of the interrelationship between the intracellular signaling of lymphocytes and the neuroendocrine
regulation after WBI is discussed.

INTRODUCTION
Cell proliferation is a basic process constantly going on in the body in re-
sponse to changes in the external and internal environments. In the immune
system, lymphocyte proliferation is often taken as an important parameter
indicating the status of the body's defenses. The stimulatory effect of whole-
body X-irradiation with a low dose (0.075 Gy) and suppressive effect of a
high dose (2 Gy) on concanavalin A (Con A)­induced lymphocyte prolif-
eration have been repeatedly demonstrated (Troup and Anderson, 1982;
James and Makinodan, 1988; Makinodan and James, 1990; Liu et al., 1993;

Liu, 1998). In a previous paper the dose­effect relationship of immunologic
changes following whole-body X-irradiation and some of the mechanisms
of low-dose radiation-induced lymphocyte stimulation were analyzed (Liu,
2003). It was demonstrated that intercellular reactions between the antigen
presenting cells and lymphocytes and the facilitation of the intracellular sig-
naling cascades thus initiated in the lymphocytes were important molecu-
lar mechanisms of T-cell activation induced by low-dose radiation. Among
the signal pathways involved, up-regulation of calcium/PKC signals occupy
a pivotal position in low-dose radiation-induced potentiation of lymphocyte
proliferation. However, in the intact organism, cellular processes are influ-
enced by systemic regulation, especially that from the neuroendocrine sys-
tem (Besedovsky and Sorkin, 1979; Besedovsky and Rey, 1996; Haddad et al.,
2002). The present paper may be considered a continuation of the mechanis-
tic analysis of the augmentation of lymphocyte proliferation in response to
low-dose radiation. The involvement of neuroendocrine factors in the signal
transduction pathways of lymphocyte activation and proliferation induced by
low-dose radiation is reviewed, with emphasis on the possible role of corti-
costeroids, melatonin, and catecholamines.
EFFECT OF CORTICOSTEROIDS ON CELL PROLIFERATION
Cellular activities are regulated by intracellular signals initiated by stimu-
lation from external and internal environment. Different signal pathways are
involved in the initiation of different cellular functions. Lymphocyte prolif-
eration response to Con A is often used as a measure because this is the mi-
togen most studied in the research of activation and proliferation of murine
T lymphocytes (Leon, 1971; Alimkhodzhaeva et al., 2002; Goytia-Acevedo
et al., 2003). The proliferative response of thymic and splenic T lymphocytes
to Con A was measured by 3H-TdR incorporation. The dose­effect relation-
ship of the magnitude of DNA replication represented by incorporation of
3H-TdR into lymphocytes after exposure to different concentrations of Con A
ranging from 2 to 30 µg/ml showed an inverted U-shaped curve (Figure 1,
unpublished data).
The left panel of Figure 1 shows the dose­response relationship of the
proliferation of mouse thymocytes to 2­30 µg/ml of Con A, demonstrating a
peak proliferation at a concentration of 15 µg/ml of Con A. The right panel
of this figure shows the dose­response relationship for the proliferation of
mouse splenic T cells in the range 2­30 µg/ml of Con A, with the peak stimu-
lation occurring at a concentration of 10 µg/ml of Con A. It should be noted
that the amplitude of the maximum stimulation in the case of splenic T lym-
phocytes is much higher, doubling that of the response of thymocytes. It is
interesting to note that by addition of 5 × 10-12 M of corticosterone (CS),
a subphysiological concentration of the hormone (the physiological range
being 10­30 × 10-8 M), the stimulating effect of different concentrations

of Con A on the proliferation of both the thymocytes and splenic T lym-
phocytes is further potentiated, with the most significant augmentation of
proliferation occurring at a concentration of 5 µg/ml of Con A in both cases
(Figure 2, unpublished data). This concentration of Con A (5 µg/ml) is sub-
optimal since the maximal stimulation of thymic and splenic lymphocytes
occurred at the concentrations of 10 and 15 µg/ml, respectively, as shown in
Figure 1.

cases the presence of CS 5 × 10-12 M in the culture further increased the lymphocyte proliferation

EFFECT OF RADIATION ON HYPOTHALAMIC­PITUITARY­
ADRENOCORTICAL AXIS
It has long been recognized that the hypothalamic­pituitary­
adrenocortical (HPA) axis has a profound influence on the regulation of
the immune system (Besedovsky and Sorkin, 1979; Besedovsky and Rey,
1996; Haddad et al., 2002). Under physiological conditions, the HPA axis
exerts a (tonic) repression on the immune system, preventing its overac-
tion, especially on the growth and function of the thymus (Hadden, 1998;
Sheridan et al., 1998). Hyperfunction of the HPA axis would lead to atrophy
of the thymus and correspondingly suppression of immune functions. On
the other hand, a lowering of the hormonal level of the end organ of this
axis (i.e, use of serum corticosteroids) would have an opposite effect. We
tested this by adding different concentration of CS to cultured splenic and
thymic lymphocytes in a medium containing 5 µg/ml Con A. It was found
that a concentration of corticosterone at 10-11 M would stimulate lympho-
cyte proliferation and a concentration of corticosterone at 10-7 M would
lead to its suppression (Figure 3) (Liu et al., 1993, 1994a). There is lowering
of the activities of the HPA axis after whole-body X-irradiation of mice with
0.075 Gy, expressed as lowered serum concentrations of both ACTH and CS
(Figure 4) (Liu et al., 1994b). It can be seen in this figure that the ACTH and
CS levels decreased by more than 30 and 70%, respectively, 1 day after irra-
diation. The mRNA level of the proopiomelanocortin (POMC ) gene in the
hypothalamus decreased early in the first few hours after low-dose radiation
(inset at the upper right corner of Figure 4) (Wan and Liu, 1998). This change
implicates a down-regulation of the hypothalamic control of the hypophyseal

to CS. Thymic and splenic lymphocytes were incubated in the presence of 5 µg/ml of Con A and different
concentrations of corticosterone were added to act for 24 h. orticosterone caused significant stimulation
of proliferation at 10-11 M and suppression at 10-7 M.

function, since the POMC gene in the hypothalamus regulates ACTH and cor-
ticosteroid secretion (Raffin-Sanson et al., 2003; Krude et al., 2003).
GLUCOCORTICOID RECEPTORS AS SIGNAL MOLECULES
An important aspect of the hormonal control of immune functions is
the regulation of signal transduction in the immune cells. The action of
corticosteroids is realized via the cytoplasmic glucocorticoid receptor
(GCR), which binds the hormone to form a complex that is transported
to the nucleus, where it activates gene induction after binding of this com-
plex with the glucocorticoid response element in the DNA molecule. Nor-
mally GCR exists in the cytoplasm as a complex with heat shock protein
(HSP), and binding of glucocorticoid with GCR releases the latter from
HSP (Gehring, 1993; Hutchinson et al., 1993). It was reported that low-
dose radiation increased the level of HSP in mouse lymphocytes (Nogami
et al., 1993). Consequently, there exists the possibility of increased bind-
ing of HSP with GCR after low-dose radiation, which would result in its
decreased entry into the nucleus. At the same time, low-dose radiation de-
creases the number of GCRs in splenic T cells whereas high-dose radiation
increases it (Figure 5) (Duan et al., 1992). This would be another factor
that would further decrease the entry of GCR into the nucleus to activate
transcription.

CALCIUM SIGNALING
Intracellular calcium mobilization occupies an important position in
the signal pathways in Con A­induced proliferation, both under normal
conditions (Isakov and Altman, 1985; Sei and Arora, 1991) and after low-
dose radiation (Liu et al., 1994c; Liu, 2003). Whole-body X-irradiation with
0.075 Gy further accentuates this Con A­induced calcium mobilization
(Figure 6) (Liu, 1998, 2003), which is accompanied by increased expression
of its downstream molecule calcineurin (Figure 6).
The further augmentation by low-dose radiation of both the Con A­
induced increase in calcium mobilization and up-regulated expression of

exposure to 0.075 Gy X-rays. Error bars omitted for clarity; n = 4­6 for each dose point.
Radiation-Induced Change in Lymphocyte Proliferation 239
calcineurin reaches a peak 24 h after low-dose radiation. This coincides with
the up-regulation in CD3 expression and the rise of cGMP content in the
thymocytes (Figure 6), and also with the decrease in serum CS level and cyto-
plasmic GCR number (Figures 4 and 5, respectively) (Liu, 1998, 2003). These
changes imply that intracellular calcium mobilization may act in concert with
other intracellular signal molecules and neurohormonal changes induced by
low-dose radiation.
THE PINEAL GLAND AND MELATONIN
Besides the immunoregulatory effect of the HPA axis, the pineal gland was
found to be an organ exerting profound influence on immunity (Pierpaoli,
1998; Raffin-Sanson et al., 2003). Studies on the influence of melatonin on
low-dose radiation effects have demonstrated that the pineal gland might be
an important regulator and melatonin an important signal molecule in the
mechanism of low-dose radiation-induced hormesis (Liang et al., 1999). It
was found that whole-body X-irradiation with 0.075 Gy caused changes in the
pineal gland, including increases in DNA synthesis, decreases in apoptosis as
well as a rise of melatonin and cGMP content in the gland (Li et al., 2001,
2002). In pinealectomized (with a laser beam) mice exposed to low-dose ra-
diation there was an elevation of serum CS (Figure 7) instead of the decrease
observed in intact mice exposed to low-dose radiation as shown in Figure 4.
At the same time, the proliferative capability of the thymocytes and splenic
FIGURE 7 Effect of whole-body X-irradiation with 0.075 Gy on serum CS level in pinealectomized mice.
Mice were pinealectomized with a laser beam and whole-body X-irradiation was given 3 days after pinealec-
tomy. Groups of irradiated mice (n = 6 for each group) were decapitated at 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 24, and
72 h after irradiation. Serum samples (including those from sham-irradiated intact and pinealectomized
controls) were kept at -70C before determination of CS content using competitive protein binding
assay.
240 S.-Z. Liu
T cells was markedly depressed after exposure of pinealectomized mice to
low-dose radiation. The replacement of melatonin in vivo (injection of mela-
tonin to pinealectomized mice) or in vitro (addition of melatonin to cultured
splenic lymphocytes obtained from pinealectomized mice) could restore the
increase in proliferative response induced by low-dose radiation (Liang et al.,
1999).
NEUROTRANSMITTERS
The influence of neurotransmitters studied includes the effect of
acetylcholine and catecholamines. It is generally believed that epinephrine
(E) and norepinephrine (NE) augment the activity of granulocytes while
acetylcholine enhances the activity of T lymphocytes, since granulocytes bear
adrenergic receptors whereas T cells bear cholinergic receptors (Abo and
Kawamura, 2002). Our experiments showed that acetylcholine increased the
proliferation of normal T lymphocytes in a wide range of concentrations
(1­533 × 10-9 M) and could further increase the already up-regulated T-cell
proliferation induced by low-dose radiation in concentrations above 22 ×
10-9 M (Zhao et al., 1996). However, after in vitro low-dose radiation the
T-cell proliferation was further up-regulated only by the highest concentra-
tion of acetylcholine (533 × 10-9 M).
It was also found that E and NE in concentrations of 10-9­10-7 M could
significantly increase the proliferative reaction of splenic lymphocytes to
Con A, and E and NE at 10-7 M further augmented the up-regulated prolif-
erative activity induced by low-dose radiation (Figure 8) (Liu et al., 1993,
1994a). It was observed that E, NE, and CS, each at a concentration of
10-10 M, showed no effect on proliferation of thymocytes and splenic T cells.
FIGURE 8 Effect of NE on proliferation of thymic (left panel) and splenic (right panel) lymphocytes
induced by Con A. M ± SE, n = 3 for each dose point; in both cases the presence of NE 10-7 M in the
culture further increased the lymphocyte proliferation induced by 5 and 10 µg/ml of Con A (p < 0.01).
Radiation-Induced Change in Lymphocyte Proliferation 241
It is interesting to note that E+CS or NE+CS each in a concentration of
10-10 M could up-regulate the proliferative activity of the thymocytes and
splenic T cells from normal as well as 0.075-Gy-irradiated mice. If E+NE+CS
each in a concentration of 10-10 M were added to thymocytes and splenic
T cells from either normal or low-dose irradiated mice, the proliferative ac-
tivity was stimulated to an even higher degree. The magnitude of augmen-
tation of cell proliferation was higher than that induced by addition of the
calcium ionophore A23187 (1 µg/ml) or the PKC agonist PMA (5 ng/ml)
to cell cultures from normal as well as low-dose irradiated mice, as illus-
trated in Figure 9 (Liu et al., 1994a). Whole-body X-irradiation of mice with

(A) splenic T cells; (B) thymocytes; M ± SD, n = 3 for each time point. Epinephrine (E), norepinephrine
(NE), and corticosterone (CS) each at a concentration of 10-10 M acting together, as well as A23187 at
1 µg/ml and phorbol myristate acetate (PMA) at 5 ng/ml increased the proliferation of lymphocytes
induced by 5 µg/ml of Con A in normal (cells harvested from sham-irradiated mice, "zero time") and
irradiated mice (cells harvested 1, 4, and 7 days after exposure).
242 S.-Z. Liu
0.075 Gy only slightly increased splenic NE (unpublished data). These ob-
servations might imply that, under a subphysiological concentration of CS in
the external environment of thymocytes and splenic T cells, slight changes
in E and NE concentrations could significantly affect the Ca2+ signaling
and PKC pathways in the cells. Such experimental data suggest that systemic
regulation may exert a profound influence on immune activation after low-
dose radiation.
FURTHER WORK NEEDED
The neuroendocrine regulation of immunity is a very complex process.
The concept of a neuro­endocrine­immune axis denotes that each con-
stituentpartoftheaxismayinfluencethefunctionoftheothervianeurotrans-
mitters, hormones, cytokines, and chemokines, and that neuroendocrine
cells may produce cytokines and chemokines, and immune cells may pro-
duce neurotransmitters and hormones under specific conditions (Grimm
et al., 1998; Haddad et al., 2002). Therefore, the whole picture of neuro-
hormonal regulation in radiation-induced immune changes may be much
more complicated than currently believed. More work on the dose­response
relationship of the effect of different mediators of the neuroendocrine sys-
tem on immunity, as well as changes in their tissue content, after exposure
may improve our understanding of the nature of low-dose radiation-induced
hormesis in the intact organism.
