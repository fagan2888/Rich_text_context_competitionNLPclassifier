Association Between Antibiotic Use
and Primary Idiopathic Intussusception
David M. Spiro, MD; Donald H. Arnold, MD; Fabio Barbone, MD, DrPH
Background: Intussusception is the leading cause of in-
testinal obstruction in young children. Antibiotics are the
most frequently prescribed medication in the pediatric
population and have common adverse effects on the gas-
trointestinal tract.
Objective: To determine whether a relationship exists
between primary idiopathic intussusception and antibi-
otic drug use.
Design: Case-control study.
Participants: Ninety-three case patients with intussus-
ception and 353 injury controls younger than 4 years who
were seen at the emergency department of the Children's
Hospital of Alabama between January 1, 1996, and April
30, 2001, were included. Controls were matched to cases
by quarter and year of time of diagnosis, age, and sex.
Main Outcome Measures: Odds ratios and 2-sided
95% confidence intervals were estimated using condi-
tional logistic regression. Prevalence of antibiotic use in
an age-standardized, representative sample of US chil-
dren from NHANES III (Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey) was used for external
comparisons.
Results: Antibiotic use within 48 hours of diagnosis was
found in 23 cases (25%) and 33 controls (9%) (odds ra-
tio, 4.15; 95% confidence interval, 2.17-7.92; attribut-
able risk, 18.7%). Antibiotic use among US children ac-
cording to NHANES III was 10.7%. In cases, the -lactam
class accounted for 78% of all medications used. Ceph-
alosporin use was associated with more than a 20-fold
increased risk of intussusception.
Conclusion: An association between antibiotic drug use
and intussusception was identified.

INTUSSUSCEPTION IS the most com-
mon cause of intestinal obstruc-
tion in children aged 3 months to
6 years.1 John Hunter2 first de-
scribed intestinal invagination in
the 18th century; however, the exact
mechanism is still poorly defined in this
age group, and the etiology is suspected
to be multifactorial. Viral pathogens such
as adenovirus are known to be associated
with intestinal lymphoid hyperplasia and
intussusception,3 but they cannot ex-
plain all cases. Promotility medications and
certain chemical substances such as co-
caine, laxatives, and organophosphates
havebeenidentifiedaspotentialagentsthat
may contribute to the development of in-
tussusception.4-6 Inflammatory media-
tors such as nitric oxide, prostaglandins,
and cytokines have been demonstrated to
increase rates of intussusception by alter-
ing gut motility in laboratory mice.7 An-
tibiotics, the second most widely pre-
scribed medication class in the United
States,8 modify gut motility and intesti-
nal flora.9 To our knowledge, no studies
to date have implicated antibiotics as a po-
tential cause of intussusception. We con-
ducted a retrospective, hospital-based,
case-control study to determine whether
an association exists between antibiotic use
and primary, idiopathic intussusception in
children.
METHODS
DATA COLLECTION
Medical records from the emergency depart-
ment (ED) at the Children's Hospital of Ala-
bama, University of Alabama at Birmingham,
were the source of information for this study.
The pediatric ED has approximately 55000
child visits per year, serving the primary, sec-
ondary, and tertiary care needs of the Birming-
ham Metropolitan Standard Area and the state
of Alabama. This is the only pediatric ED in
the Metropolitan Standard Area (US Census
2000 population aged 0-17 years: n=231225)

and the state (US Census 2000 population aged 0-17 years:
n=1123422). Access to medical records was approved by the
institutional review board of the University of Alabama at Bir-
mingham on May 8, 2001. Between July 2 and August 31, 2001,
the medical records of children registered in the ED between
January 1, 1996, and April 30, 2001, were identified via the hos-
pital medical record system data files.
Children eligible to be cases of intussusception were those
registered in the ED who were younger than 4 years at the time
of diagnosis (International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision, code 560.00). Patients with pathologic lead points listed
as a secondary diagnosis and those whose medical records could
not be found were excluded from the study. Controls were iden-
tified among children registered in the ED and discharged with
a diagnosis of unintentional injury (International Classifica-
tion of Diseases, Ninth Revision, codes 800-994.10). Eligible con-
trols were matched with cases by calendar year and quarter,
age (in years), and sex. Four controls per case were selected
within each set defined by year and quarter, age, and sex. If
more than 4 controls per case were available per set, the first 4
medical records randomly pulled for abstraction were se-
lected. No relaxation in the matching criteria was allowed when
fewer than 4 controls per case were available.
For cases and controls, the following information was
collected using a standardized data collection form: medical
record number, date of abstraction, discharge date, date of birth,
age (in years), sex, race, insurance type, chronic underlying con-
dition(s) (yes or no), history of prematurity, allergies to medi-
cines, patient hospitalization occurrence, immunization sta-
tus (current or not current), medications used (yes or no), and
a list of all current or recent medications recorded. For anti-
biotic use, if the medication was not listed as current, infor-
mation on date of discontinuation before the date of ED reg-
istration was recorded, and an indication for treatment also was
abstracted from the medical records. Generic and proprietary
names of medications were identified and classified by one of
us (D.M.S.) according to the National Drug Code Data Files of
the Food and Drug Administration. Antibiotic indications were
collected (otitis media, upper respiratory tract infection, uri-
nary tract infection, and other), and "other" was defined if avail-
able from the ED record. Gastrointestinal (GI) medications were
defined as antiemetics, intestinal promotility agents, H2
-
receptor antagonists, antacids, and antiflatulents. Gastrointes-
tinal indications were categorized as gastroesophageal reflux,
diarrhea, emesis, or other. Gastrointestinal medications were
defined as medications whose primary purpose is to modulate
clinical effects regarding the GI system. For case patients only,
the method of intussusception diagnosis was recorded (clini-
cal suggestion, surgical, radiographic, or unknown), and the
anatomic location of the intussusception was identified if known.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Analyses were conducted considering use of antibiotics (yes or
no) or use of a specific antibiotic class as the dependent vari-
able. The odds ratio (OR) was calculated to estimate the rela-
tive risk (RR) of disease among users of antibiotics compared
with nonusers. Conditional maximum likelihood estimates in
logistic regression procedures were used to calculate ORs and
2-sided 95% confidence intervals (CIs). The relation between
primary idiopathic intussusception and antibiotic drug use was
evaluated also taking into consideration possible confounding
variables. However, terms for variables other than use of anti-
biotics and GI medications did not affect the results and there-
fore were not kept in the final models. In addition, the study
did not have enough power to test the possible interaction be-
tween use of antibiotics and other variables. To estimate the
proportion of intussusception cases attributable to antibiotic
use, attributable risk was calculated as [(E/D)(RR-1)]/RR,
where E is the number of cases who used antibiotics and D is
the total number of cases. Again, RR was estimated using an
OR obtained from a conditional logistic regression model ad-
justed for use of GI medications.
An external comparison was conducted regarding antibi-
otic use prevalence between our cases and controls and a rep-
resentative sample of American children aged 2 months to 4
years from NHANES III (Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey).10 This survey was conducted by the
US National Center for Health Statistics between 1988 and
1994, and its data can be downloaded from the Internet at
http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/about/major/nhanes/nh3data.htm.
Data from NHANES III (1988-1994) can be used to obtain es-
timates of prescription drug use in the civilian noninstitution-
alized US population. Prescription drug data were obtained by
trained interviewers who inventoried all prescription drugs
used within 1 month by survey participants 2 months and
older. This information can be grouped by age, sex, race or
ethnicity, and other factors of interest. For this study, we ana-
lyzed NHANES III data to estimate age-standardized rates of
use of medications according to the distribution of our case
patients in months. Antibiotic drug use in the United States
during the month before interview can be estimated from
NHANES III using established weights. For comparability
purposes, antibiotic use calculated in the United States during
the previous 2 weeks was approximately equal to half the
prevalence in the previous month.
RESULTS
PARTICIPANTS
A total of 111 intussusception ED cases were identified.
Of these, 13 (12%) were excluded on the basis of being
older than 4 years and 4 (4%) because their medical rec-
ords were not found. Nine patients were excluded with
lead points as a secondary diagnosis, most (8 of 9) being
older than the child's fourth birthday. Thus, 93 cases
(84%) were included in the study. In 3 (5%) of 60 sets
defined by the matching variables, a control-case ratio
of less than 4 was obtained owing to lack of available medi-
cal records for the eligible controls. This led to the in-
clusion of 353 controls in the study.
Most children (n=56) diagnosed as having intus-
susception were younger than 1 year (Table 1). The
male-female ratio was 2.39:1. Cases and controls had simi-
lar insurance coverage (Medicaid vs private insurance).
Intussusception diagnosis was primarily radiographic
(n=59), and 70 children (75%) were diagnosed as hav-
ing ileocolic or ileocecal intussusception. In addition, cases
and controls were similar in age (13.6 vs 13.4 months).
MEDICATION ANALYSES
Table 2 describes the association between intussuscep-
tion and use and type of medications. Antibiotics, anti-
pyretics and analgesics, asthma medications, GI medi-
cations, immunizations, over-the-counter cold and cough
medications, and seizure medications accounted for 97%
of the medications listed for cases and 99% for controls.
A total of 60 antibiotics were used by 23 cases (25%) and
33 controls (9%) (adjusted OR, 4.15; 95% CI, 2.17-7.92).
Amoxicillin was the most commonly used medication

(9 cases and 16 controls), followed by ceftriaxone so-
dium (4 cases and 1 control) and trimethoprim-
sulfamethoxazole (2 cases and 3 controls). Gastrointes-
tinal medications were the second most common
medications in cases (adjusted OR, 9.51; 95% CI,
3.91-23.12). There were 25 children (16 cases and 9 con-
trols) taking a total of 31 GI medications at the time of
ED presentation. Ranitidine (3 cases and 5 controls), pro-
methazine hydrochloride (4 cases), cisapride (3 con-
trols), aluminum hydroxide and magnesium hydroxide
and simethicone (2 cases and 1 control), and simethi-
cone (3 cases) were the most common GI medications
listed from a total of 11 GI medications identified. An-
tipyretics and analgesics, asthma medications, over-the-
counter cold and cough medicines, and seizure medica-
tions all had ORs that were lowered after adjustment and
that were not statistically significant. Most antibiotic use
for cases (21 of 23) and controls (31 of 33) was re-
corded as occurring at the time of ED presentation. Each
group had 2 patients not currently taking antibiotics, hav-
ing discontinued using these medications within 48 hours
of ED visitation. Therefore, neither group had discon-
tinued any listed antibiotics more than 48 hours before
ED presentation.
Table 3 represents the relation between intussus-
ception and use of antibiotics by class using adjusted
ORs. Classes were not mutually exclusive owing to a few
class combination products (eg, erythromycin and
sulfisoxazole). The -lactam medication class, includ-
ing penicillins and cephalosporins, was the most com-
monly used subclass for cases and controls. The risk of
intussusception was more than 20-fold higher among us-
ers of cephalosporins (OR, 22.49; 95% CI, 5.32-95.00).
A significantly increased risk was also found for penicil-
lins (OR, 3.14; 95% CI, 1.35-7.26).
Otitis media was the most common indication for
antibiotic drug use in cases and controls, composing 52%
and 61% of all types of indications, respectively. The next
most common indication for antibiotic use was upper res-
piratory tract infection, accounting for 17% and 9% of
the cases and controls, respectively. The association be-

tween antibiotic use and intussusception varied little re-
garding indication, with similar ORs for otitis media, up-
per respiratory tract infection, and other indications. Other
indications listed were fever (1 case), urinary tract re-
flux (1 case), postlaceration repair (1 case), sickle cell
prophylaxis (1 control), and stomach virus (1 control).
For GI indications, emesis (10 cases) and gastroesopha-
geal reflux (2 cases and 8 controls) each accounted for
40% of all indication types. Diarrhea (1 case and 1 con-
trol) accounted for 8% of all GI indications, and "other"
(3 cases) accounted for the remaining 12%.
For the group of children younger than 4 years pre-
senting to the ED with primary idiopathic intussuscep-
tion, the risk attributable to antibiotic use was 18.7%. This
estimate was based on a RR of 4.15 and a proportion of
antibiotic users of 0.247 (23/93). From NHANES III, an-
tibiotic use among American children during the 2 weeks
before interview was approximately 10.7%, which is simi-
lar to that of the study control group. Use of -lactam
antibiotics from the NHANES III external analysis was
8.3%. Therefore, use of antibiotics in our series of intus-
susception cases was 2.3 times higher compared with the
age-standardized NHANES III data.
COMMENT
Previous case series have evaluated the descriptive epi-
demiologiccharacteristicsofintussusception.11-13 Thefind-
ings of the intussusception cases in our study are simi-
lar to those of previous studies14,15 with respect to age and
sex. Although some studies16,17 have reported little sea-
sonal variation, most18,19 have reported peaks during the
spring and early summer, which is consistent with our
data showing a slight increase in the second quarter
(April-June). We noted no significant differences be-
tween cases and controls regarding chronic underlying
conditions, immunization status, insurance type, his-
tory of prematurity, allergies to medications, or mean age
(in months).
This study found an independent association of
intussusception with antibiotic use. The association of
antibiotics with intussusception became somewhat stron-
ger when the OR was adjusted for use of GI medications,
indicating that the association cannot be explained by con-
founding by use of GI medications. The strong associa-
tion of GI medications with intussusception was ex-
pected, considering the presenting clinical symptoms of
abdominal pain and emesis that occur with significant fre-
quency before proper diagnosis.1 We also directly ana-
lyzed the indication for antibiotic use before ED admis-
sion as it was abstracted from the medical records. No
indications for antibiotic use were for GI symptoms or di-
agnosis; in fact, most were otitis media and upper respi-
ratory tract infection related. These results provide fur-
ther evidence that antibiotic use preceded intussusception
and are consistent with national data indicating that acute
otitis media and upper respiratory tract infections are the
principal diagnoses for US physician visits.8
Of the various antibiotic classes, the -lactams were
found in this study to be significantly associated with in-
tussusception. Users of cephalosporins had more than a
20-fold increased risk of intussusception (OR, 22.49; 95%
CI, 5.32-95.00), and use of penicillins also was associ-
ated with a significantly higher OR (OR, 3.14; 95% CI,
1.35-7.26). The use of antibiotics has been described pre-
viously to cause small-bowel disturbances. Caron et al20
demonstrated in humans that amoxicillin­clavulanate po-
tassium increases the amplitude and duration of duodenal-
jejunal contractions. -Lactams interact directly with the
postsynaptic -aminobutyric acid receptors in the cen-
tral nervous system,21 with such receptors additionally
found in the mesenteric plexus.22 A potential mecha-
nism of -lactam class small intestine dysmotility may
then be -aminobutyric acid, induced either directly or
indirectly with administration of this drug class. Eryth-
romycin, a macrolide class antibiotic, is a known moti-
lin receptor agonist and inducer of the migrating motor
complex in the human GI tract,23,24 which as a promo-
tility agent is a potential mechanism to induce intussus-
ception. Our hypothetical model, therefore, suggests an-
tibiotic dysmotility as a variable factor in the development
of intussusception. The exposure window of all antibi-
otics recorded was taken currently or within 48 hours
of ED presentation. As the half-life of the various anti-
biotics in our series ranges from 30 minutes to 68 hours,25
it is possible that the antibiotic dysmotility effects may
have lasted from hours to days depending on the spe-
cific antibiotic used.
The major limitation of this study is the retrospec-
tive nature of medical record analysis. Handwritten medi-
cal record information is potentially not accurate, poorly
interpretable, or noninclusive. Emergency department rec-
ords reviewed during the study were noncomputer-
ized and were not dictated. The data abstractor was not
masked to the study design or hypothesis. To improve
the accuracy of results and minimize inconsistencies of
record review, the following procedures were used: the
abstractor was trained before study inception; explicit pro-
tocols were used to describe the criteria for case selec-
tion and exclusion; standardized abstraction forms for
cases and controls were applied; periodic meetings were
held during study abstraction to review and monitor cod-
ing protocols; and a second reviewer was used to ran-
domly reabstract 10% of all medical records and data en-
tries to determine interrater reliability for each abstraction
step. Interrater variability was low (6.1% for medical rec-
ord abstraction and 0.4% for data entry). Another po-
tential bias may be the differing nature of information
obtained between cases and controls. Intussusception
records may have been more complete with respect to
recording antibiotic use compared with injury control
records, as many of these children were preoperative dur-
ing the ED course. In addition, all recorded medication
use was abstracted with standardized ED records for cases
and controls, which may minimize this potential bias.
Outpatient injuries were selected as controls par-
ticularly to determine the prevalence of antibiotic use in
the general population at the time of matched case di-
agnosis. We believe that outpatient injuries are the hos-
pital-based series that best represents the general popu-
lation of children in our area. In addition, potential
confounders such as insurance type and chronic condi-
tions were tested in multiple logistic regression models
but were found not to affect the association between in-

tussusception and antibiotic use. A second strength was
the use of NHANES III data as an external comparison
group. Although the NHANES III analysis pertains to a
different period (1988-1994 vs 1996-2001) and popula-
tion (United States vs Alabama), and estimates of use of
medication in NHANES III was based on a calculated use
during the 2 weeks before interview compared with cur-
rent use in our study subjects, the concordance of anti-
biotic use between NHANES III data and our control
series provides external validation to our results.
Intussusception as an entity diagnosis has many eti-
ologies. In older children and adults, a pathologic, well-
defined lead point is usually discovered, such as lym-
phoma, Meckel's diverticulum, or intestinal polyposis.1
In the infant and toddler age groups, multiple viral in-
fections have been implicated as these agents have been
recovered from intestinal lymphoid tissue at the site of
intussusception.26 Adenovirus has been found in up to
50% of intussusception appendixes, significantly higher
than in control populations.27 Lymphoid hyperplasia may
be responsible for the actual lead point in primary idio-
pathicintussusception,butthisdoesnotexplainwhysome
infants develop the condition and others do not despite
exposure to similar environmental conditions, includ-
ing potentially causative viral agents. In addition, it has
been suggested that anatomic or genetic predisposition
may play an important role, as siblings of patients with
intussusception have a reported 15- to 20-fold increase
in incidence compared with the general population.17
Prompted by a frequent history of mild upper respi-
ratory tract symptoms preceding the development of in-
tussusception, physicians suggested a potential role for in-
fection decades before the identification of adenovirus.11
In the United States, pediatricians and family physicians
commonly prescribe antibiotics for viral conditions in chil-
dren28 despite consistent evidence that antimicrobial
therapy has no role in their treatment. Therefore, one ex-
planationfortheantibiotic-intussusceptionassociationthat
we found may not be causality but confounding by viral
infection. Conversely, antibiotics are known to alter gut
motility,9 and, under certain conditions, these drug-
induced changes may contribute to the development of
intussusception. Antibiotics have been implicated in other
GI pathophysiologic states, such as hemolytic uremic syn-
drome,29 irritable bowel syndrome,30 and a more recently
described relationship between infantile hypertrophic
pyloric stenosis and erythromycin therapy.31
We hypothesize that intussusception is a multivar-
iate process that, in young children, may involve a com-
plex interdependent progression of lymphoid hyperpla-
sia combined with dysmotility, induced by the viral agent
itself, the use of antibiotics, or other as yet unidentified
factors, all or some of which may include the release of
local inflammatory mediators. According to a mouse
model for intussusception developed by Nissan et al,7 in-
traperitoneal injections of lipopolysaccharides may in-
teract with other potent inflammatory mediators such as
nitric oxide, ultimately increasing rates of intussuscep-
tion above baseline. Therefore, the process of intussus-
ception development is most likely a dynamic entity and
may involve a series of cellular and intracellular events
for intestinal invagination to occur, with an increased like-
lihood in individuals with an anatomic or familial pre-
disposition.16 Although the exact cellular and biochemi-
cal mechanisms are not clearly defined, antibiotic therapy,
viral processes, or both may contribute individually or
by additive effect to induce intussusception. Although
this study found an independent association between an-
tibiotic use and intussusception, further research is nec-
essary to determine causality.

What This Study Adds
There are few known risk factors for primary idiopathic
intussusception, which is the leading cause of intestinal
obstruction during the first years of life. Antibiotics are
widely prescribed and as a medication class have known
effects on the gastrointestinal tract. This study was con-
ducted to determine whether a relationship exists be-
tween antibiotic drug use and intussusception.
This is the first known study providing evidence of
an association between antibiotic use and intussuscep-
tion. Results of this study suggest that antibiotic medi-
cation use may be identified as a potential contributory
risk factor when the clinician suspects intussusception.
These findings should reinforce the need for judicious
use of antibiotic therapy when caring for young children.
