Abstract
Objectives The purpose of this study was to assess how
changes from different baselines of activities of daily living
(ADL) can be explained by marital status, living arrange-
ment and healthcare.
Methods Using data from the Chinese Longitudinal
Health Longevity Study conducted in 2002 and 2005, 8,099
surviving and 3,822 deceased elderly aged 65 years and
over were evaluated using multinomial logistic regression.
Results After adjusting for demographic, socioeconomic
and health factors, elderly who were either married or
living alone were less likely to encounter ADL decline
compared to their counterparts. This was true only for those
with fully independent ADL at baseline. Notably, once the
functional status of the elderly declined from baseline and
they became dependent on others, the status of living alone
was no longer a significant predictor of the rate of future
decline. On the other hand, elderly who had a spouse,
children or other relatives as caregivers were more likely to
experience a faster recovery and lower likelihood of death,
compared to those who were cared by unrelated live-in
caregivers. In addition, Chinese elderly with health insur-
ance had a lower likelihood of death than their counterparts
lacking health insurance, among those with ADL at the
dependent baseline.
Conclusions Although there has been a change in family
structure and living arrangements, the majority of Chinese
elderly still rely on traditional forms of family support,
especially after acquiring dependency status. As the elderly
have different functional levels, healthcare policies in
China should consider the need for both community and
family support systems.

Introduction
In China, a rapid increase is predicted for the near future in
the proportion of elderly people in the population, due to the
one-child policy. Populations in many countries including
China are aging, and change in family structure and living
arrangements of the elderly is apparent. Some studies [1, 2]
based on sampling data from censuses in China indicated
that Chinese families are turning from a traditional to a
modern structure. For example, an increase in people living
alone, empty-nest households, and nuclear family house-
holds has been observed, while multi-generational family
households have decreased. In addition, growing indepen-
dence of married couples from their older relatives,
democratization of the family relationships, and socializa-
tion of family functions have occurred, due to economic
development, urbanization, and other sociological factors

[2, 3]. These recent changes in critical demographic factors
in China have therefore generated concern for improving the
health status and living circumstances of the elderly.
Studies conducted in western countries have shown that
household structure can affect the incidence of decline in
functional status of the elderly. For example, a study
conducted among urban, non-institutionalized individuals
at least 65 years of age showed that elderly who lived with
children and without spouses had worse health outcomes,
compared to elderly living alone [4]. Another study showed
that people who lived with a partner had lower morbidity
rates than did people who lived alone; after controlling for
the effects of different living arrangements, the risks for all
objective measures of illness of the `never married', wid-
owed and divorced were 40­70% less than the risks for
people who lived with a partner [5]. A more recent, pro-
spective study of women with no severe impairment at a
baseline level suggested that those living alone were less
likely to experience a decline in functional status than were
those living with spouses or other people [6].
Although a few studies have focused on changes in
family support networks for the elderly in China [7], little
is known regarding how the marital status, living
arrangements and healthcare issues may affect changes in
their functional status. Understanding the influence of these
factors is likely to be useful in promoting family support
networks and improving health of the elderly. The purpose
of the current study is to determine whether changes in
activities of daily living (ADL) of Chinese elderly pos-
sessing different baseline ADL levels can be explained
by marital status, living arrangements and nature of
caregivers.
Methods
Database
The Chinese Longitudinal Health Longevity Study
(CLHLS) [8, 9] was conducted in 1998 (baseline), and
follow-up studies were performed in 2000, 2002, and 2005.
The current study used the third and fourth waves (2002
and 2005, respectively) of the CLHLS. The CLHLS was
conducted in randomly selected 50% of the counties and
cities in 22 provinces. The 22 surveyed provinces were:
Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjing,
Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui,
Fujian, Jiangxi, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guang-
dong, Guangxi, Sichuan, and Chongqing, which have a
total population of 985 million and represent 85% of the
total population in China.
The CLHLS survey tried to interview all centenarians
from the above counties and cities who voluntarily agreed
to participate in the study. Starting with the third wave of
the CLHLS in 2002, for each centenarian, the surveyed
elderly included subjects in an age range of 65­79, one
octogenarian (i.e., 80­89 years of age) and one nonage-
narian (i.e., 90­99 years of age) of a pre-designated age
and gender who lived nearby. ``Nearby'' was loosely
defined as the same street, village, town, city, or county.
The predefined age and gender used to identify approxi-
mately equal numbers of male and female in each age
group were randomly determined, based on the code
numbers of the centenarians. One goal of the CLHLS was
to have comparable numbers of male and female of each
age from 65 to 99.
The CLHLS in 2002 comprised a total sample size of
16,057 subjects, of which 4,894 elderly were aged 65­79,
4,210 were aged 80­89, 3,632 were aged 90­99, and 3,321
were aged 100 years and above. The follow-up survey
conducted in 2005 contained data for 8,136 subjects who
were interviewed in the follow-up, and for 4,111 deceased
subjects whose families were interviewed. The population
eligible for our study was defined as subject's C65 years of
age who were interviewed during the follow-up periods in
2002 and 2005. Our total study sample was 8,099 surviving
interviewees and 3,822 deceased interviewees.
An extensive questionnaire (containing 92 questions
pertaining to 180 items) was used in the CLHLS. Data were
collected on demographic factors, socioeconomic factors,
living arrangements, and health indicators, such as the
ADL and the mini-mental state examination (MMSE) etc.
For the CLHLS, an enumerator and either a doctor, nurse,
or medical student conducted an interview and performed a
basic health examination at the interviewee's home [9, 10].
Measures
The six basic activities in the ADL consist of eating,
dressing, indoor mobility, bathing, using the toilet, and
continence. While considering the ADL measurement
method proposed by Katz [11], the following measurement
criteria were developed for the present study. The degrees
of function in ADL were categorized as: fully independent
(FI; i.e., no assistance required); relatively independent
(RI; i.e., requiring assistance for only one or two activi-
ties); relatively dependent (RD; i.e., requiring assistance in
three or four activities); and fully dependent (FD; i.e.,
requiring assistance in five or six activities). In addition,
the change in ADL was also analyzed among the deceased
interviewees as one of the severe forms of decline in
physical functions.
Exposure variables were measured at baseline (i.e., in
2002), except for the frequency of serious illness in the past
2 years among the surviving interviewees (e.g., in 2005).
Marital status was transformed into a dichotomous
Environ Health Prev Med (2009) 14:128­141 129

variable, indicating married versus single (i.e., widowed,
divorced, separated or never married). Living arrangements
were identified through the marital status of the individual,
the household size, and the co-residence members. Thus,
the potential types of living arrangements were ``living in a
nursing home'', ``living alone'', ``living with spouse only''
(specified by a household size of two, a married status, and
the co-resident member being the spouse), and ``living with
others'' (defined by a household size C3 individuals). For
the variable of living arrangements, the term, ``others'' was
defined as a spouse, children, grandchildren, or other rel-
atives. In our study, the category of an elderly person living
with a child or children younger than 18 years of age was
deleted, because the limited number of subjects that fell
into that category made the particular living arrangement
difficult to evaluate.
Our study included the following healthcare questions:
(1) who (spouse, children, relatives, live-in caregivers, and/
or others) usually takes care of you when you are ill? (2)
Can you obtain adequate medical service when you are ill?
(yes or no). (3) ``Who pays your medical bills for you?''
(i.e., having health insurance, family, relatives or others).
This question was asked to identify whether a subject had
health insurance or not.
For accuracy in investigating the role of the factors of
marital status, living arrangements, and healthcare issues
on changes in categories of ADL, we eliminated con-
founding factors including demographic, socioeconomic
and health factors. Health factors included cognitive ability
and frequency of serious illness within the past 2 years.
Demographic and socioeconomic factors included gender,
age, residence, education, occupation, and household
income. The number of years of schooling was used to
represent the educational level of the elderly subjects.
We pre-processed the data on years of schooling into the
following categories, according to their distribution: ``no
education'' (i.e., illiteracy), 1­4 years of schooling, and
C5 years of schooling. We divided occupational data into
agricultural or non-agricultural, according to the subjects'
occupations before they were 60 years of age. This division
was made because nearly two-thirds of the current popu-
lation of elderly people in China were involved in farming
and agricultural production. Household income was pre-
processed into the following three categories according to
distribution:\1,200 RMB per capita per year, 1,201­3,000
RMB per capita per year, and [3,001 RMB per capita per
year.
The international standard of the MMSE questionnaire
used in this study to measure cognitive ability was trans-
lated into Chinese [9]. The same parameters used in the
MMSE international standard were applied here; thus, a
score of 0­30 was possible (i.e., the lower the score, the
more severe was the cognitive impairment). The frequency
of serious illness requiring hospitalization or that which
caused the subject to be bedridden at home within the past
2 years was calculated for the year 2005. We pre-processed
an extended period of time that for which a subject was
bedridden at home as a score of 24, representing 24 months
(2 years). The distribution of frequency of serious illness
requiring hospitalization ranged from 0 to 16. Thus, fre-
quency of serious illness and period of being bedridden at
home were quantitative variables in the analyses.
Statistical analyses
Statistical analyses including a v2 test or Kruskal­Wallis H
test were conducted to analyze the change in ADL and
either the exposure variables (marital status, living
arrangements, and availability of healthcare) or the main
confounding variables (i.e., demographic, socioeconomic
and health factors). Multinomial logistic regression analy-
sis was run using different categories of ADL (including
dead) as a dependent variable. Three multinomial logistic
regression models were used to test the influence of marital
status, living arrangements, and availability of healthcare
on changes in ADL from the different baselines for elderly
subjects in China. The first model estimated the relative
risk factors of progressing from FI to RI, RD, FD, and
dying among those at FI baseline. The second and third
models incorporated the relative factors of progressing
those from RI or RD and FD to FI or FI and RI, RD and
FD, and dying among those at RI or RD and FD baseline,
respectively. Due to a limited number of cases in some
categories, those who were RD and FD were combined in
the analysis; for the same reason, FI and RI were also
combined when the onset of ADL at RD and FD baselines.
Analyses were performed with SPSS Version 16.0 statis-
tical software.

Our total study sample was 11,921 elderly people, Of these,
5,487 (46%) were male, and 6,434 (54%) were female;
6,491 (54%) of subjects resided in the rural countryside of
China, and 5,430 (46%) resided in towns and cities in
China; 7,137 (60%) elderly subjects with no education,

were single (with 1 case missing). The average age of male
subjects was 82.31 ± 10.50 years, and that of females' was
86.40 ± 11.79 years. On the other hand, the average age of
the currently married elderly was 76.79 ± 8.90 years, and
that for the single elderly was 88.81 ± 10.36 years. In
addition, among the 4,174 elderly who were currently
married and living with a spouse, 2,838 (68%) were men
whose average age was 77.92 ± 9.21 years, and 1,336
(32%) were women whose average age was 74.51 ±
7.79 years. Among 2,121 elderly who lived alone, 805 (38%)
were men whose average age was 84.52 ± 9.96 years,
whereas 1,316 (62%) were women whose average age was
85.22 ± 10.95 years.
Characteristics of the study population according to the
changes in ADL among the elderly from 2002 to 2005 are
presented in Table 1. Regarding changes in ADL from
2002 to 2005: 8,857 (75%) elderly subjects were FI, 1,834
(15%) were RI, 398 (3%) were RD, and 832 (7%) were FD
in 2002. Among 8,857 subjects who were FI at baseline,
5,694 (64.3%) maintained FI, 581 (6.6%) declined to RI,
153 (1.7%) declined to RD, 333 (3.8%) declined to FD, and
2,096 (23.7%) had died; while among 1,834 subjects who
were RI at baseline, 402 (21.9%) improved from RI to FI,
315 (17.2%) maintained RI, 250 (13.6%) declined to RD or
FD, and 867 (47.3%) had died; and among 1,230 subjects
who were RD and FD at baseline, 179 (14.6%) improved
from RD or FD to RI or FI, 192 (15.6%) maintained RD or
FD, and 859 (69.8%) had died.
Among subjects who were FI at baseline, significant
correlations with changes in ADL were found with all
categories of demographic variables, socioeconomic fac-
tors, the exposure variables (with the exception of having
health insurance) and factors of health status. However, for
those who were RI at baseline, there were no statistically
significant correlations between changes in ADL and
gender, education or occupation. For those who were RD
or FD at baseline, no significant correlations between
changes in ADL were found with gender and occupation.
In summary, only among subjects who were FI at baseline,
males were more than the females with statistical signifi-
cance in maintaining independence in ADL. Among the
Chinese elderly from 2002 to 2005, subjects who were in
the younger age range among the elderly population, who
had obtained a higher level of education or who lived in
rural areas of China had the highest likelihood of main-
taining independence in ADL when comparing with their
respective counterparts--the older age range among the
elderly population, who had lower education or who lived
in urban areas.
On the other hand, among socioeconomic factors, sig-
nificant correlations were observed between household
incomes and change in ADL from all baseline categories.
A significant association between occupation and ADL
change from baseline were observed only in subjects cat-
egorized as FI at baseline. A trend in those with lower
socioeconomic status possessing a greater likelihood of
maintaining ADL independence was observed. Regarding
health factors, both the frequency of serious illness within
the past 2 years and the MMSE scores were associated with
significant changes in ADL. Among the exposure factors,
significant changes in ADL from all baseline categories of
ADL were correlated with marital status, living arrange-
ments, the type of caregiver when the subject was ill, or
adequate of medical service. In terms of health insurance,
having health insurance resulted in maintenance of inde-
pendence in ADL in subjects who were RI, or RD and FD
at baseline. These findings indicate that almost all of the
exposure factors influenced change in ADL status accord-
ing to different ADL levels at baseline.
Table 2 includes three multinomial logistic regression
models to test the influence of residence, education,
household income, occupation, marital status, living
arrangements, and availability of healthcare on changes in
ADL from the different baselines for elderly subjects in
China, after adjusting for age and gender. The first model
estimated the relative risk factors of progressing from FI to
RI, RD, FD, and dying among the onset of ADL at FI
baseline (We indicated them as RI/FI, RD/FI, FD/FI and
Dead/FI). The second model estimated the relative factors
of progressing from RI to FI, RD or FD, and dying among
the onset of ADL at RI baseline (We indicated them as FI/
RI, RD ? FD/RI and Dead/RI). The third model estimated
the relative factors of progressing from RD or FD to FI or
RI and dying among the onset of ADL at RD or FD
baseline (We indicated them as FI ? RI/RD ? FD and
Dead/RD ? FD).
Table 2 shows that, after adjusting for age and gender,
those who lived in urban areas had a higher risk of ADL
decline from FI to RI (OR = 1.46, 95% CI: 1.22­1.74), FI
to RD (OR = 1.47, 95% CI: 1.06­2.04) than those who
lived in rural areas. Also those who lived in urban areas
had a higher risk of not improving ADL from RI to FI
(OR = 0.48, 95% CI: 0.33­0.75), and RD or FD to FI or
RI (OR = 0.49, 95% CI: 0.36­0.65) than those who lived
in rural areas. On the other hand, living in urban areas was
found to help protect against dying at RI (OR = 0.74, 95%
CI: 0.57­0.96) compared with those living in rural areas.
In addition, lower education was found to help protect
against a decline in ADL from FI to RI (OR = 0.73, 95%
CI: 0.56­0.94), RI to RD or FD (OR = 0.42, 95% CI:
0.25­0.73; OR = 0.37, 95% CI: 0.20­0.68). Also lower
education was found to help improve from RD or FD to RI
or FI (OR = 4.64, 95% CI: 2.21­9.75; OR = 3.57, 95%
CI: 1.56­8.17). However, those who had lower education
had a higher risk of dying at RD or FD (OR = 2.34, 95%
CI: 1.43­3.81), than those with a higher level of education.

Similarly, lower household income was found to help
protect against a decline from FI to RI (OR = 0.63, 95%
CI: 0.51­0.79; OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.60­0.92), FI to RD
(OR = 0.59, 95% CI: 0.40­0.88; OR = 0.54, 95% CI:
0.36­0.82), FI to FD (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 0.52­0.94), and
improve ADL from RI to FI (OR = 1.74, 95% CI: 1.21­
2.51; OR = 1.67, 95% CI: 1.13­2.45), RD or FD to FI or
RI (OR = 1.99, 95% CI: 1.19­3.32), compared with those
who had higher income. Moreover, those who had non-
agriculture jobs before they reached 60 years of age had a
higher risk of ADL decline from FI to RI (OR = 1.27, 95%
CI: 1.06­1.52) than those who were farmers before.
Table 2 also shows that, after adjusting for age and
gender, being married was found to help protect against a
decline in ADL from FI to RI (OR = 0.79, 95% CI: 0.64­
0.99). Moreover, those who had health insurance had a
higher risk of ADL decline from FI to RI, compared to
those who were FI at baseline and lacking health insurance
(OR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.13­1.88). In addition, among
subjects who were FI at baseline, the elderly who were
married or living only with spouse had a lower likelihood
of death, as opposed to those who were single or living
alone (OR = 0.74, 95% CI: 0.65­0.85; and OR = 0.82,
95% CI: 0.68­0.99, respectively). On the other hand, the
elderly who lived in a nursing home, those with health
insurance, or those who experienced inadequate medical
service when ill were found to have a higher likelihood of
death among subjects who were FI at baseline (OR = 1.97,
95% CI: 1.51­2.57; OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.01­1.42; and
OR = 1.43, 95% CI: 1.22­1.66, respectively) compared to
their counterparts.
For those who were RI at baseline, having inadequate
medical services when ill was found to prevent ADL
change from RI to FI, compared to those with adequate
medical services (OR = 2.13, 95% CI: 1.26­3.59), while
having health insurance was found to have a lower rate of
ADL change from RI to FI (OR = 0.55, 95% CI: 0.34­
0.95). Similarly, after adjusting for age and gender, among
those with ADL values of RD and FD at baseline, those
who either had children or other relatives as caregivers or
experienced inadequate medical service when ill were
found to have a higher rate of ADL change from RD or FD
to FI or RI, compared to those with unrelated live-in
caregivers or who experienced adequate medical service
when ill (OR = 3.33, 95% CI: 1.62­6.88; and OR = 1.65,
95% CI: 1.01­2.72, respectively). Having health insurance
was found to have lower rates of ADL change from RD or
FD to FI or RI, compared to those without health insurance
(OR = 0.28, 95% CI: 0.13­0.57). In addition, those who
were married or who lived only with their spouse, children
or other relatives as caregivers during illness, or those
who had health insurance had a less likelihood of death
compared to their counterparts (OR = 0.43, 95% CI:

Multivariate-adjusted ORs for marital status, living
arrangements, and healthcare issues affected changes in
ADL, according to the baseline category of ADL, as is
shown in Table 3. After adjusting for main confounding
variables, married elderly who were FI at baseline were
less susceptible to experiencing ADL change from FI to RI
status or death (OR = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.46­0.91; and
OR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.66­0.97, respectively) than those
who were single. In addition, elderly who lived with just a
spouse or who lived with children and/or others (sometimes
including a spouse) had a 1.73- and 1.35-fold higher risk,
respectively, towards ADL change from FI to RI status,
and a 1.51-fold higher risk of ADL change from FI to FD
status, compared to those who lived alone. Notably, once
the elderly showed dependency in ADL function, living
alone was no longer a significant predictor of future ADL
status. For those who were RD or FD at baseline, after
adjusting for main confounding variables, elderly who
were cared for by children and other relatives during illness
were 4.4 times more likely to experience a change in ADL
from RD or FD to RI or FI, compared to those with
unrelated live-in caregivers. In addition, among those who
were RD or FD at baseline, the elderly who were cared for
by a spouse, or by children and other relatives during ill-
ness, or who had health insurance had a lower likelihood of
death (OR = 0.64, 95% CI: 0.42­0.98; OR = 0.63, 95%
CI: 0.43­0.92; and OR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.19­0.67,
respectively). Other factors did not significantly affect the
change in ADL.
Discussion
Given the paucity of previous research conducted on the
impact of marital status, living arrangements, and health-
care availability on change in ADL among Chinese elderly,
the current study may have important implications for
policy-making regarding community and family support
systems. Specifically, we found that Chinese elderly who
are married are less likely to experience ADL decline and
have a lower risk of death, compared to their single
counterparts. Among those who were FI at baseline, the
Chinese elderly who lived alone were less likely to expe-
rience ADL decline compared to those who lived with their
spouse, or lived with children and/or other people
(including a spouse). Another study of Chinese people
C55 years of age showed similar results; the elderly who
lived with people other than a spouse had a significantly
higher risk of decline in functional status than did elderly
who lived alone or with only their spouse [12].
The following reasons might explain these findings.
First, a recent survey conducted in China found that more
elderly people who were financially and physically inde-
pendent preferred to live either alone or with their spouse.
This trend was especially true for urban elderly with high
levels of education and who had held white-collar jobs
before they reached 60 years of age [2, 13]. Most of these
subjects enjoyed a full life. Thus, continuing to live alone
or with just their spouse seemed to be beneficial in main-
taining ADL, compared to other elderly people who lived
with children or others.
Secondly, public pensions in China currently are
reserved for only a small proportion of the elderly popula-
tion [14­16]. Therefore, in both urban and rural areas, many
elderly people provide their adult offspring with housing,
housework, or care of grandchildren in return for financial
and other material support. The degree to which an adult
offspring would provide financial support to their elderly
parents is dependent on the parents' need [14]. Such family
support compensates for insufficient access to public
resources. For elderly who live with others, including off-
spring, the long-term intergenerational exchange may result
in physical fatigue, leading to a decline in physical
functioning.
Third, according to our data, the average age of married
elderly in China is lower than that of single elderly, and the
majority of married elderly in China are male, while the
majority of those who live alone are female. From our data,
we surmise that married male elderly in China were less
likely to experience deteriorating function in ADL and had
a lower likelihood of death compared to those who are
single. On the other hand, elderly women living alone in
China were less likely to experience ADL decline. Similar
studies in Japan and western countries [17, 18] indicated
that males who lived alone had higher health risks, while
women who lived alone had significantly lower mortality
rates. In sum, further study is required to examine the
benefits of marriage with regard to maintenance of ADL
independence by gender and age in China.
Finally, living alone allows elderly people to learn to
maintain a high level of independence, a phenomenon
referred to as a ``biologically conditioned reflex'' [19].
According to our analyses, compared to those who live
with others, elderly people who live alone are more inde-
pendent in not only the six basic ADL activities (eating,
dressing, indoor mobility, bathing, using the toilet, and
continence), but also in instrumental ADL activities, such
as walking outside, shopping, preparing meals, or cleaning.
Our study revealed that once an elderly person becomes
functionally dependent on others, the status of living alone
is not a significant predictor of further functional decline.
After adjusting for confounding factors in those who are
RD or FD at baseline, the elderly who were cared for by

children and other relatives during illness were 4.4 times
more likely to experience a change in ADL from RD or FD
to RI or FI, compared to those with unrelated live-in
caregivers. In addition, the elderly who were cared for by a
spouse, or children and other relatives had a lower likeli-
hood of death, compared to those with unrelated live-in
caregivers. These findings imply that currently, the
majority of elderly in China still rely on traditional forms
of family support. Compared to the past, a greater pro-
portion of modern-day elderly people in China are single or
live with just their spouse [2], but once the elderly become
functionally dependent, they usually move to live with
their adult offspring and other people [20, 21]. According
to traditional confucian-based family values in China, the
happiest elderly are those surrounded by as many descen-
dants as possible, especially during the last stages of their
lives. Spouses, children, and other relatives who play the
role of caregivers when an elderly relative becomes ill is
considered to be common [13]. Moreover, compared to
having an unrelated, live-in caregiver, having spouses,
children, and other relatives who play the role of caregivers
will better protect the elderly from psychological isolation
and will provide sick elderly people with adequate medical
services. However, according to the studies, even after the
introduction of long-term health care insurance in 2000 in
Japan, the potential supply of offspring caregivers present
varied substantially by gender, marital status, and oppor-
tunity costs of children [22]. Judging by this result found in
Japanese studies, this study also implies that professional
training for live-in caregivers is required due to the rapidly
increasing proportion of the aged within the population in
China, partially as a consequence of the one-child policy.
Our study also indicated that among those who were
RD or FD at baseline, Chinese elderly with health
insurance had a lower likelihood of death. Unfortunately,
in recent decades, the elderly in China have experienced
inadequate medical service or treatment due to reforms in
the medical care system. From 1949 (establishment of
new China) until the end of the first decade of the twenty
first century, the healthcare system in China has experi-
enced the elimination of private medical facilities, the
rural cooperative medical system (i.e., the presence of
``barefoot'' doctors), and the public and private healthcare
systems. Since the economic reform that occurred in the
1980s, public and private healthcare systems have
emerged once again. However, the quality of healthcare
practice has deteriorated due to poor management and
less government regulation of the medical market [23,
24]. Most elderly people in China have experienced
inequality in healthcare, because of their low socioeco-
nomic status and the low quality and availability of health
insurance. Based on our data, only 1,606 (14%) elderly
people in this study had health insurance and most of
them live in urban areas of China; about one-third had a
household income of less than 1,200 RMB per capita per
year, and most of them live in rural areas of China.
However, in this study, residing in rural areas, and
having lower education or lower household income appear
to be a protective factor against dependency on others for
assistance with ADL. On the other hand, residing in urban
areas or having higher education helped protect against
progressing ADL from RI, RD or FD to dying compared
with their counterparts (see Tables 1, 2). In addition,
elderly who experienced inadequate medical service when
ill or lacking health insurance were found to have a lower
likelihood of ADL decline (see Table 2). This could be
explained by the ``select bias'' [10], selecting for those with
a lower socioeconomic status, lower availability of health
insurance, more difficult life experiences, and higher
mortality at younger ages in rural regions of China. As a
result, the selected elderly in rural areas might be with
stronger survival skills than those in urban areas in China.
In addition, due to a massive shift from rural to urban
areas among the younger population, a large proportion of
the elderly population remains with their grandchildren in
rural villages [25, 26]. Number of adult offspring willing to
take on care-giving responsibilities for aging parents is
declining in modern China. As a result, the elderly in China
are once again facing disadvantages in healthcare and
assistance. All of these factors suggest that health insurance
for the elderly should be established and that adequate
medical service or treatment for the Chinese elderly should
be provided as soon as possible.
The present study has several methodological limita-
tions. Some factors of measurement were not sensitive
enough to detect a functionally independent status of the
elderly. For example, those considered to be married
included those currently married and living together as well
as those currently married and living separately. It would
be better to distinguish the difference between these two
groups. However, there were only 295 (6.3% of all married
subjects) elderly subjects who were currently married and
living separated. In addition, the living arrangements in the
present study were only categorized as living in a nursing
home, living alone, living with just a spouse, and living
with ``others'' (``others'' was defined as a spouse, children,
grandchildren, or other relatives). Future studies should
include more detailed classifications of marital status and
living arrangements. Future studies should also assess how
changes from different baselines of ADL can be explained
by the differences between those who experienced physical
decline and changed their living situation from a small
family to a large family, and those who experienced a
decline in functional status, but did not change their family
structure within their household. Moreover, short period of
observation (2002­2005) may be one of methodological

limitation. As a result, reverse causality might occur in
some items.
Interpretation of our findings should consider all of these
limitations. Our study is still unique, however, due to our
application of nationwide data that clarified the impact of
marital status, living arrangements, and healthcare issues
on changes in ADL among the elderly in China. We con-
clude that within the surveyed time period, the majority of
elderly people in China still relied on a traditional type of
family support. As the elderly have different functional
levels, healthcare policies in China should consider both
community and family support systems.
