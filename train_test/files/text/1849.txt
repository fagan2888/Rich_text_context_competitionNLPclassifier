OBJECTIVE -- Distributions of serum concentrations of insulin among adolescents and
young adults are poorly understood in the U.S. The objective of this study was to describe the
distribution of serum insulin across demographic characteristics of U.S. adolescents and young
adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- A total of 1,791 male and female subjects
aged 12­19 years who participated in the National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
for 1999­2002 were included in the analyses.
RESULTS -- Among male participants, serum concentrations of insulin increased from age 12
to 14 years before decreasing. Among female participants, concentrations were highest at age 13
years before decreasing steadily through age 19 years. Among participants aged 12­17 years but
not those aged 18­19 years, females had higher mean log-transformed concentrations than
males (P, Wald, F  0.038 and 0.125, respectively) after adjusting for age and ethnicity. After
adjusting for age and BMI percentile, mean log-transformed concentrations were higher in
African-American females aged 12­17 years than in white or Mexican-American participants. No
significant ethnic differences were found among female participants aged 18­19 years or male
participants aged 12­19 years. Concentrations of insulin increased strongly with increasing
levels of BMI.
CONCLUSIONS -- These results provide detailed information about serum concentrations
of insulin in a representative sample of U.S. adolescents and young adults and may be useful to
monitor future trends of this risk factor for diabetes and cardiovascular disease.
Diabetes Care 29:2605­2611, 2006
The increase in obesity among chil-
dren in the U.S. has generated great
concern about their future health
because of the increased risk of cardiovas-
cular disease and diabetes associated with
obesity (1,2). Obesity is associated with
insulin resistance, a state characterized by
the body's resistance to the actions of in-
sulin, which results in increased insulin
production by the pancreas and hyperin-
sulinemia. Measures of adiposity are gen-
erally strongly related to concentrations
of insulin (3). In children and adoles-
cents, elevated concentrations of circulat-
ing insulin are associated with risk factors
for cardiovascular disease such as high
blood pressure, dyslipidemia, inflamma-
tory markers, endothelial dysfunction,
and cardiovascular reactivity (4 ­12).
Thus, early increases in insulin concen-
trations may promote early vascular
changes that lead to early onset of cardio-
vascular disease. Furthermore, because
high concentrations of insulin may serve
as a surrogate marker for insulin resis-
tance (13), a step on the road to diabetes,
changes in circulating concentrations of
insulin may serve as early indications of
future trends in diabetes incidence and
prevalence.
These considerations suggest that
surveillance of circulating concentrations
of insulin may be of critical importance
during a time in world history when in-
creases in the prevalence of obesity are
occurring in many countries and are ex-
pected to continue (14). Such informa-
tion may be useful in anticipating which
particular population groups may be at
increased risk for developing adverse
events and may help target resources for
intervention programs. In general, how-
ever, such data are not available in most
countries, and even more rarely are such
data available from nationally representa-
tive samples of the population of country,
including the U.S. Our objective was to
characterize serum concentrations of in-
sulin for adolescents and young adults in
the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- We examined data
from National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Surveys (NHANES) for 1999­
2002 for participants aged 12­19 years.
Detailed information about the methods
and procedures of this survey is available
elsewhere (15,16). In brief, representative
samples of the noninstitutionalized civil-
ian U.S. population were selected through
a stratified multistage design. Trained in-
terviewers, using a computer-assisted
personal interview system, interviewed
participants at home. Participants were
asked to attend the mobile examination
center, where they completed additional
questionnaires, underwent various exam-
inations, and provided a blood sample.
The study received human subjects ap-
proval from the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention.

Serum insulin in U.S. youth
2606 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 29, NUMBER 12, DECEMBER 2006
All insulin assays for NHANES 1999­
2002 were performed in the same labora-
tory at the University of Missouri,
Columbia, using the same method. Serum
specimens were frozen at 70°C,
shipped on dry ice, and stored at
70°C until analysis. The serum insu-
lin concentration was measured using a
radioimmunoassay kit (Pharmacia Diag-
nostics, Uppsala, Sweden). Quality con-
trol procedures following modified
Westgard rules were used; these included
both within- and between-assay quality
control measures as well as monitoring of
trend. The coefficient of variation of the
method was 5.0­6.9% during the 4 years
of the study.
We included participants aged 12­19
years who attended the morning exami-
nation and who had fasted at least 8 h. We
excluded females who were pregnant,
and participants with diabetes. We in-
cluded age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI per-
centiles as covariates. We categorized age
into two groups: 12­17 years and 18­19
years. This categorization was done for
several reasons. First, the gap in terms of
maturation between a 12 year-old and a
19 year-old is substantial. Second, the di-
vision was based on sociocultural reasons.
Third, using a cut point of 18 years may
facilitate comparisons of the results from
the present analyses with those of other
studies. Finally, having adequate sample
size for analyses also played a role in de-
termining how many age categories were
feasible. For analyses stratified by ethnic-
ity, we only included whites, African
Americans, and Mexican Americans be-
cause the sample sizes for other partici-
pants were relatively small. We present
means and geometric means with SEM or
95% CIs. For regression analyses, concen-
trations of insulin were log-transformed
to improve the distribution of this vari-
able. To account for the complex sam-
pling design, SUDAAN version 9.0
software was used to calculate means and
to perform linear regression analyses. Per-
centiles were calculated with SAS version

8.2. Sampling weights were used to cal-
culate measures of central tendency, per-
centiles, and regression estimates.
RESULTS -- A total of 1,791 partici-
pants aged 12­19 years who attended the
morning examination had a value for in-
sulin. These included 931 male and 860
female subjects, 488 whites, 507 African
Americans, 666 Mexican Americans, and
130 other participants.
Unadjusted mean and geometric
mean concentrations of serum insulin are
shown in Table 1. The pattern of geomet-
ric mean concentrations of insulin by age
differed somewhat according to sex (Fig.
1). Among male participants, concentra-
tions increased from age 12 to 14 years
before decreasing somewhat. Among fe-
male participants, concentrations were
highest at age 13 years before decreasing
steadily through age 19 years. Selected
percentiles of concentrations of insulin
are shown in Table 2. Among participants
aged 12­17 years but not among those
aged 18­19 years, females had higher
log-transformed concentrations of insulin
than males (P, Wald, F  0.038 and
0.125, respectively) after adjusting for age
and ethnicity.
In unadjusted analyses of participants
aged 12­17 years, ethnic variation was
present among both males (P, Wald, F 
0.006) and females (P, Wald, F 0.001).
No significant ethnic variation occurred
among male or female participants aged
18­19 years. Among participants aged
12­17 years, mean log-transformed con-
centrations did not vary significantly by
ethnicity among males (P, Wald, F 
0.199) but did so among females (P,
Wald, F  0.021) after adjusting for age
and BMI percentile in linear regression
analysis (Fig. 2). African-American fe-
males had higher concentrations of insu-
lin than white or Mexican-American
females. Among participants aged 18­19
years, no significant ethnic differences
were present among male and female par-
ticipants. BMI was strongly associated
with concentrations of insulin among
both male and female participants (Fig.
3).
CONCLUSIONS -- These data rep-
resent the first nationally representative
information about the distributions of
fasting insulin concentrations among
youth in the U.S., and they show signifi-
cant demographic variation. Concentra-
tions were higher among females than
males. Significant ethnic variation was
present among female participants aged
12­17 years but not among those aged
18­19 years.
In many studies conducted in the
U.S., African-American children and ad-
olescents were found to have higher con-
centrations of insulin than white children
(4,6,17­26). Among 2,996 Bogalusa
Study participants aged 5­17 years, the
difference in median concentrations of in-
sulin between whites and African Ameri-
cans was larger among females than males
(3). However, in one study, the ethnic dif-
ference was eliminated after adjustment
for fat mass quantified using dual energy
X-ray absorptiometry (26). Factors that
may account for the difference between
African-American and white children and
adolescents include lower insulin clear-
ance, lower insulin sensitivity, and higher
insulin secretion (24­28). Given the high
prevalence of diabetes among African
Americans and Mexican Americans com-
pared with whites in the U.S. and the high
mortality rates from coronary heart dis-
ease among African Americans compared
with whites, the high concentrations of
insulin among these groups, especially fe-
males, underscore the fact that the roots
for these diseases can often be traced back
to childhood. Our findings also under-
score the wisdom of trying to prevent the
development of disease and risk factors at
an early age.
Fewer studies have compared con-
centrations of insulin among Hispanic

Serum insulin in U.S. youth

and white children and adolescents. In a
study of 403 third graders in Corpus
Christi, Texus, median concentrations
were higher in Mexican Americans than
in whites (29). Among children from the
Los Angeles area, concentrations of insu-
lin were higher among 28 Hispanic chil-
dren than 14 among Caucasian children
(25). In a study of 491 Hispanic children
aged 2­3 years from New York City, con-
centrations of insulin were higher in girls
than in boys (11). In the San Diego Study
of Children's Activity and Nutrition, con-
centrations of insulin were higher in 54
Mexican American children than in 29
white children at age 11 years (30). Al-
though the median concentration of insu-
lin was still higher in Mexican American
children than in white children, 6 years
later the difference was not significant.
Most studies conducted in U.S. youth
have also shown that concentrations of
insulin are higher in females than in males
(31). Among 90 Pima Indian children
aged 5 and 10 years, concentrations of
insulin were similar in boys and girls aged
5 years but were higher in girls than in
boys at the age of 10 years (32). In addi-
tion, many studies conducted in other
countries have also reported higher circu-
lating concentrations of insulin in females
than in males (33­38). However, in some
studies no sex differences were found
(38,39).
Our results showing a large increase
in fasting concentrations of insulin in
those who were overweight compared
with those who were not reiterate some of
the negative physiological consequences
of excess weight. In addition, the signifi-
cant increase in concentrations of insulin
among those who were at risk for being
overweight shows that even this degree of
excess weight produces unfavorable
physiological changes.
A limitation of our study is the lack of
data on pubertal status and serum andro-
gens, estrogens, or growth hormone.
Such information would be helpful to de-
scribe the difference in distribution of in-
sulin concentrations among teens at
different pubertal stages, when elevated
values may reflect either a normal physi-
ological state or a pathological one. For
now, our results suggest that fasting se-
rum insulin concentrations peak earlier in
girls than in boys. The lack of insulin val-
ues for subjects 12 years of age, when
some youth, mostly girls, may enter early
pubertal development, precludes our
ability to comment on the distribution of
insulin among preadolescent children.
Previous NHANES surveys did not collect
serum insulin on adolescents, so compar-
isons to a group of U.S. teens that were
less overweight than this sample are not
possible.
Although the relative merit of surrogate
markers for insulin resistance continues to
be researched, fasting concentrations of
insulin correlate about as well with mea-
sures of insulin resistance determined by
gold standard methods as other surrogate
markers. In four studies, correlation coef-
ficients between fasting concentrations of
insulin and measures of insulin sensitivi-
ty/resistance determined by gold standard
methods ranged from 0.4 to 0.91 (28,40­
42). In three of these studies, the correla-
tion coefficients ranged from 0.8 to 0.91
(28,41,42).
In our analysis, we examined fasting
serum concentrations of insulin, one facet
of a complex physiological picture. Glu-
cose loading or meals elicit a greater insu-
lin response in African Americans than in
whites (17,43). Unfortunately, measures
of stimulated insulin response were not
available in the NHANES data set.
In summary, fasting concentrations of
insulin showed significant demographic
differences. Geometric mean concentra-
tions were higher in females than in males
and peaked at age 14 years in males and
13 years in females. The only ethnic or
racial differences occurred in females
aged 12­17 years among whom geomet-
ric mean concentrations were higher in
African Americans than in whites or Mex-
ican Americans. The increases in obesity
among U.S. youth, the strong links be-
tween obesity and hyperinsulinemia and
insulin resistance, and the effects of hy-
perinsulinemia and insulin resistance on
cardiovascular disease and diabetes sug-
gest that surveillance of concentrations of
insulin in the population, particularly in
children and adolescents, may be useful
to assess early effects of obesity on health
and to allow international comparisons.
For example, a report on the distribution
of serum insulin in Canadian youth col-
lected in 1999 showed median values of
plasma insulin to be lower than those in
comparable groups of U.S youth (35).
The values reported for 13-year-old boys
were lower than those for the 12- to 13-
year-old boys in this study (41.9 vs. 56.4
pmol/l), and values for the 16-year-old
boys were lower than those for the 16- to
17-year-old boys (38.7 vs. 59.58 pmol/l).
These differences may be attributable to dif-
ferences in race or ethnicity or distribution
of obesity. Assay variability may be a signif-
icant reason for these differences, highlight-
ing the need for achieving standardization
in insulin measurements among laborato-
ries (44) to facilitate surveillance.
