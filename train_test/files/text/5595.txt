Introduction
Oral antithrombotic therapy has been used to
reduce the risk of thromboembolic complications.1
On the other hand, it might cause gastrointestinal
bleeding by inducing mucosal damage, impairing
mucosal healing, or by aggravating blood loss from
pre-existing lesions.2 In daily practice, we encoun-
ter antithrombotic drug users with obscure
gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB), and it is often
difficult to diagnose the origin of their bleeding.
Furthermore, some patients suffer from rebleeding
events. OGIB is defined as bleeding of unknown
origin that persists or recurs after esophagogas-
troduodenoscopy, colonoscopy, or the radiological
evaluation of the small bowel.3 OGIB accounts for
5% of all cases of gastrointestinal bleeding, and is
often caused by small bowel lesions.4 In patients
presenting with OGIB, the diagnostic yield of
video capsule endoscopy (VCE) ranges from 38%
to 93%,5,6 and is superior to other diagnostic
modalities, including push enteroscopy, computed
tomography, and angiography.7 Thus, VCE is

Abstract
Background: The clinical outcome of patients with obscure gastrointestinal bleeding (OGIB)
during antithrombotic drug therapy has not been fully investigated.
Methods: Patients who underwent video capsule endoscopy (VCE) for the investigation of
OGIB at Okayama University Hospital from January 2009 to March 2016 were enrolled. We
evaluated the VCE findings, the patterns of OGIB, and the rate of rebleeding within 1 year in
antithrombotic drug users and antithrombotic drug nonusers.
Results: A total of 181 patients were enrolled. Among the antithrombotic drug users, the
rate of VCE positivity in the patients with overt OGIB was significantly higher in comparison
with patients with occult OGIB (45% versus 16%, p = 0.014), whereas there was no significant
difference among the antithrombotic drug nonusers (27% versus 26%, p = 1.0). Among
the antithrombotic drug users, the rate of rebleeding among the VCE-positive patients
was significantly higher in comparison with the VCE-negative patients (50% versus 5.9%,
p = 0.011). Moreover, among antithrombotic drug users who did not receive therapeutic
intervention, the rate of rebleeding among the VCE-positive patients was significantly higher
in comparison with the VCE-negative patients (75% versus 6.3%, p = 0.001). However, among
the antithrombotic drug nonusers who did not receive therapeutic intervention, the rebleeding
rate of the VCE-positive patients was not significantly different from that of the VCE-negative
patients (20% versus 9.4%, p = 0.43).
Conclusion: Therapeutic intervention should be considered for patients with overt OGIB who
are VCE positive and who use antithrombotic drugs due to the high risk of rebleeding.

recommended as the initial investigation to detect
sources of bleeding.6,8
There have been some reports on the clinical out-
comes or risk factors for rebleeding in patients
with OGIB.9­11 Additionally, some authors have
described an increased relative risk of recurrent
OGIB in patients under anticoagulant ther-
apy.12­14 However, the clinical outcome of patients
with OGIB during antithrombotic drug therapy
has not been investigated in detail.
The aim of this study was to elucidate the clinical
outcome of patients with OGIB according to their
antithrombotic drug use.
Methods
Study design and patients
This was a single center, retrospective, observa-
tional study. Patients who underwent VCE for
the investigation of OGIB at Okayama University
Hospital from January 2009 to March 2016 were
enrolled. Patients in whom the source of bleeding
was proven to be outside the small intestine were
excluded. All patients underwent upper and lower
gastrointestinal endoscopy before VCE, and it
was confirmed that the examinations were nega-
tive or insufficient to explain the bleeding.
Balloon-assisted endoscopy (BAE) was carried
out as a therapeutic intervention, or diagnostic
biopsy was performed, as necessary. In patients
who underwent VCE two or more times, only the
first examination was included in the present
study. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients for inclusion in the study. This
study protocol was approved by the Okayama
University Hospital Ethics Committee in April
2017 (approval number 1706-011).
Variables
The clinical parameters of the patients including
age, sex, comorbidities (hypertension, chronic
kidney disease, liver cirrhosis, ischemic heart dis-
ease, and hematologic disease), antithrombotic
drug use (antiplatelet or anticoagulant), concomi-
tant drug use [nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drugs (NSAIDs), proton-pump inhibitor (PPI),
histamine-2 receptor antagonist (H2-RA), and
mucoprotective agent], VCE findings, patterns of
OGIB (overt bleeding or occult bleeding), treat-
ment methods, and rebleeding rate within 1 year
were analyzed. OGIB is often further subclassi-
fied into two types: obscure­occult, characterized
by recurrent iron-deficiency anemia or positive
fecal occult blood testing, and obscure­overt,
characterized by the passage of visible blood,
melena, or hematochezia.3,15
We classified the enrolled patients into the
antithrombotic drug user and antithrombotic
drug nonuser groups, and compared their clinical
outcomes. First, we evaluated the rates of VCE
positivity according to the patterns of OGIB.
Second, we evaluated the rebleeding rates accord-
ing to the VCE findings among the overt bleeding
cases and the occult bleeding cases. Third, we
evaluated the rebleeding rates among patients
who received no therapeutic intervention.
Video capsule endoscopy
VCE was later performed with a video capsule
endoscopy device (PillCam SB2, Given Imaging
Ltd., Yokneam, Israel). The capsule was swal-
lowed with a solution of dimethicone after over-
night fasting, without any other preparation. At
2 h) and 4 h after swallowing the capsule, the
patients were allowed to drink clear liquids and to
eat a light meal, respectively; at 8 h after swallow-
ing the capsule, the sensor array and recording
device were removed. The images were analyzed
on a RAPID 6.5 workstation using with the Rapid
Reader 6 software program (software and work-
station from Given Imaging Ltd.). Two experi-
enced endoscopists made the diagnoses after
reaching an agreement with each other.
The definition of the video capsule endoscopy
findings and rebleeding
The VCE findings were classified according to the
P0-P2 system,16 where P0 are less-relevant lesions
that are definitive but not likely to be the cause of
OGIB; P2 lesions are highly relevant lesions con-
sidered to be the cause of OGIB, such as angioec-
tasia, varix, the presence of active bleeding,
ulceration, multiple (3) erosions, diverticulum
and tumor. Examinations that revealed one or
more P2 lesions were recorded as VCE positive.
An episode of rebleeding was defined as evidence
of bleeding within 1 year after the index bleeding
in cases of obscure­overt bleeding, or within 1
year after VCE in the patients with obscure­occult
bleeding.17 Bleeding was defined as a documented

fall in the Hb level of 2 g/dl from the baseline level,
the need for transfusion, or evidence of melena or
hematochezia.18
Statistical analysis
The sequential data were expressed as the median
and interquartile range (IQR). The categorical
data were compared using the chi-squared test or
Fisher's exact test. Bonferroni correction was per-
formed when comparing more than two groups.
Nonparametric data were compared using the
Mann­Whitney U test. Two-tailed p values of
<0.05 were considered to indicate statistical sig-
nificance. All of the statistical analyses performed
using the JMP Pro for Windows software pro-
gram (version 12).
Results
Clinical characteristics
Figure 1 shows a flowchart of the present study. A
total of 186 patients were diagnosed with OGIB
during the study period. Five cases were excluded
because the sources of bleeding were outside the
small intestine. A total of 181 patients were finally
enrolled in this study.
Table 1 shows the clinical characteristics of the
patients. The median age was 67 years, and the
male-to-female ratio was approximately 1:1.
Hypertension accounted for the highest propor-
tion of the comorbidities. A total of 118 patients
were antithrombotic drug nonusers, and 63 were
antithrombotic drug users. The proportions of
P0, P1, and P2 VCE findings were 46, 26 and
28%, respectively. The incidence of overt OGIB
was 59%, which was higher than that of occult
OGIB (41%).
Table 2 shows the clinical characteristics of the
antithrombotic drug users and the antithrom-
botic drug nonusers. The median age of the
antithrombotic drug users was higher than that
of the antithrombotic drug nonusers (72 years
versus 65 years, p < 0.001). In the antithrom-
botic drug user group, the proportions of male
patients and patients with hypertension,
ischemic heart disease, diabetes mellitus, and
concomitant PPI use were significantly higher
in comparison with the antithrombotic drug
nonuser group. There were no significant differ-
ences between the antithrombotic drug users
and the antithrombotic drug nonusers with
regard to the proportions of the VCE findings,
vascular lesions, erosive or ulcerated lesions,
patterns of OGIB, type of treatment, or the rate
of rebleeding within 1 year.
Difference of obscure gastrointestinal
bleeding patterns according to the variety of
antithrombotic drug
Table 3 shows the difference of OGIB patterns
according to the variety of antithrombotic drug.
The rate of overt bleeding cases in both the anti-
platelet and anticoagulant drug users was signifi-
cantly higher in comparison with that in the
antiplatelet drug users (80% versus 36%, p =
0.029). In contrast, the rate of overt bleeding
cases in both the antiplatelet and anticoagulant
drug users was not significantly higher in com-
parison with that in the anticoagulant drug users
(80% versus 45%, p = 0.12).

with occult OGIB (45% versus 16%, p = 0.014),
whereas there was no significant difference
among the antithrombotic drug nonusers (27%
versus 26%, p = 1.0).

The rate of rebleeding according to the video
capsule endoscopy findings among the patients
with overt and occult obscure gastrointestinal
bleeding
Figure 3 shows the rate of rebleeding according to
the VCE findings among the patients with overt
OGIB. Among the antithrombotic drug users,
VCE-positive patients showed a significantly
higher rate of rebleeding in comparison with the
VCE-negative patients (50% versus 5.9%, p =
0.011). Similarly, among the antithrombotic drug
nonusers, VCE-positive patients tended to show a
higher rate of rebleeding in comparison with the
VCE-negative patients; however, the difference
was not statistically significant (30% versus 10%,
p = 0.064).
Figure 4 shows the rate of rebleeding according to
the VCE findings among the patients with occult
OGIB cases. Among the antithrombotic drug
users, the rates of rebleeding among the VCE-
positive and VCE-negative patients did not differ
to a statistically significant extent (20% versus
3.7%, p = 0.29). Among the antithrombotic drug
nonusers, there were no cases of rebleeding
among either the VCE-positive and VCE-negative
patients.

The clinical outcomes
As shown in Table 2, there were 22 cases of
rebleeding (12%) in total. One patient received
interventional radiology, and four patients under-
went surgery for hemostasis; they all had good
clinical outcomes. Only 6 of 63 (9.5%) antithrom-
botic drug users ceased taking antithrombotic
drugs after the bleeding event; however, there
were no thrombotic complications.
Discussion
This study demonstrated the risk of rebleeding in
OGIB patients according to their use of antithrom-
botic drugs. Among the antithrombotic drug
users, the rate of VCE positivity was significantly
higher among the patients with overt OGIB than
it was among those with occult OGIB, and the
rate of rebleeding in the patients with overt OGIB
who were VCE positive was significantly higher in
comparison with that in the patients who were
VCE negative. Patients with overt OGIB who
were VCE positive and who used antithrombotic
drugs had a greater risk of rebleeding; these fac-
tors are a good indication for a VCE survey and
therapeutic intervention. Among the patients
with occult OGIB who were antithrombotic drug
nonusers, the risk of rebleeding was quite low
regardless of the VCE findings, and no therapeu-
tic intervention was required.
Based on the results of this study, we suggest that
patients with OGIB should be managed accord-
ing to the pattern of OGIB and their use of
antithrombotic drugs (Figure 7). We recommend
therapeutic intervention for patients with overt
OGIB who are VCE positive because of their
high risk of rebleeding, especially if they use
antithrombotic drugs. On the other hand, no
therapeutic intervention is needed among
patients with occult OGIB who are VCE negative
and who do not use antithrombotic drugs because
rebleeding rarely occurs in such cases. Although
the difference was not statistically significant, the
rate of rebleeding was relatively high among
patients with overt OGIB who were VCE positive
and antithrombotic drug nonusers, and among
patients with occult OGIB who were VCE posi-
tive and antithrombotic drug users. Careful fol-
low up should be needed for such cases. We
propose following these patients every 2 or 3
months with a blood test, and by performing an
endoscopic examination such as VCE or BAE if

the patients have anemia, or symptoms of melena
or hematochezia.
With regard to the management of patients with
overt OGIB who are antithrombotic drug nonus-
ers and patients with occult OGIB who use
antithrombotic drugs, the rate of rebleeding
among the VCE-positive patients was relatively
higher in comparison with the VCE-negative
patients, despite the fact that the difference was
not statistically significant. They may have a simi-
lar risk of rebleeding, and may require careful fol-
low up or therapeutic intervention. However, the
number of cases was small, and further study will
be needed to clarify this issue.
There have been few studies on the clinical charac-
teristics of OGIB patients during antithrombotic
drug therapy. Shiotani and colleagues reported
that the incidence of erosion and ulcers was signifi-
cantly higher among patients with OGIB whose
combination treatment included aspirin.19 Our
study showed that the incidence of erosive lesions
in antithrombotic drug users and antithrombotic
drug nonusers did not differ to a statistically sig-
nificant extent. One reason for this was that not all
of the patients in our study received aspirin, which
may induce small intestinal injuries.
Several studies have suggested that the diagnos-
tic yield in patients with overt OGIB is signifi-
cantly higher in comparison with that in patients
with occult OGIB;20,21 others have suggested
that there were no significant differences
between the two groups.22,23 In our study, the
incidence of VCE positivity in patients with
overt OGIB and occult OGIB did not differ to a
statistically significant extent (32% versus 21%
p = 0.13). The controversy resulted from the
different definitions of VCE positivity in these
studies. As for the diagnostic yield of VCE in
the patients with OGIB during antithrombotic
drug therapy, Boal Carvalho and colleagues
reported that anticoagulants, but not antiplate-
lets, were associated with a significantly higher
prevalence of P2 lesions in the small bowel.24
Our study indicated different results, in that
during antithrombotic drug therapy, the diag-
nostic yield of VCE in patients with OGIB
depended on the pattern of OGIB.

There have been some reports on the risk factors
for rebleeding in patients with OGIB. Koh and
colleagues recently reported that there was a sig-
nificant risk increase of rebleeding in patients who
underwent VCE for OGIB while receiving antico-
agulant therapy;5 Kim and colleagues analyzed
the risk factors for rebleeding in VCE-negative
patients and identified warfarin use as an inde-
pendent risk factor.13 Our study did not show that
the use of antithrombotic drugs was a risk factor
for rebleeding, but demonstrated that patients
with overt OGIB who were VCE positive and
who used antithrombotic drugs had a greater risk
of rebleeding, especially if they received no thera-
peutic intervention. This was an innovative
insight in comparison with previous reports.
The present study is associated with some limita-
tions. First, it was a retrospective, single-center
study, and the sample size was not sufficient, espe-
cially with regard to the population of antithrom-
botic drug users. Second, some patients who were
VCE positive did not undergo a specific treatment
because of spontaneous hemostasis. They could
have been at risk of rebleeding; thus, this might
have influenced the rate of rebleeding. Third,
some patients were followed up at other hospitals
after finishing the survey in our hospital.
In conclusion, the clinical features of OGIB
patients differed according to their antithrom-
botic drug use. Since overt OGIB patients who
were VCE positive and who used antithrombotic
drugs had a greater risk of rebleeding, therapeutic
intervention should be considered. The patterns
of OGIB and the use of antithrombotic drugs are
important for treatment strategies to manage
patients with OGIB.
