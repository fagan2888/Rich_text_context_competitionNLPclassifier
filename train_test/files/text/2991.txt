IN 1994, MORE THAN 600 COMMU-
nity health centers provided pri-
mary care to 7.1 million individu-
als nationwide,1 increasing to 8.1
million by 1998.2 This program is the
federal government's primary mecha-
nism for attempting to ensure access to
primary care for populations residing in
medically underserved areas. How-
ever, the Bureau of Primary Health Care
(BPHC), Health Resources and Ser-
vices Administration, Department of
Health and Human Services, estimates
that community health centers provide
services for just 1 in 6 persons who lack
access to a primary care practitioner.1 A
patchwork of locally funded hospital
outpatient departments, physicians' of-
fices, and community clinics therefore
supplies most of the safety net primary
care. This local structure has led to sub-
stantial variation across communities in
the composition and capacity of the pri-
mary care safety net.3,4

Context The US primary care safety net is composed of a loose network of commu-
nity health centers, hospital outpatient departments, and physicians' offices. National
data on how the mix of patients and services differ across sites are needed.
Objective To develop and contrast national profiles of patient and service mix for
primary care.
Design, Setting, and Patients Comparative analyses of 3 national surveys of pri-
mary care visits occurring in 1994: for data on physician's office visits, the National
Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS); for hospital outpatient department data,
the National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Survery (NHAMCS); and for data on
community health centers, the Bureau of Primary Health Care's 1994 Survey of Visits
to Community Health Centers. A time trend analysis also was conducted using the
1998 NAMCS and NHAMCS.
Main Outcome Measures National estimates of primary care visit rates, types of
patient presentation, patient case-mix, disposition of patients, and management in-
terventions in 1994, and compared with 1998 data.
Results The US population made 1.3 primary care visits per person in 1994, which ac-
counted for 43.5% of all ambulatory visits to physicians' offices, community health cen-
ters, and hospital outpatient departments. Primary care visits per person were 20% lower
for Hispanics and 33% lower for black, non-Hispanic persons compared with white, non-
Hispanic persons. Visits to community health centers were more likely to be made by eth-
nic minorities, patients with Medicaid or no insurance, and rural dwellers than visits made
to the other delivery sites. Visits at hospital outpatient departments were made by sicker
populations and were characterized by less continuity than the other delivery sites. Con-
trolling for patient mix, visits made to hospital outpatient departments were more com-
monly associated with imaging studies, minor surgery, and specialty referrals than those
made to physicians' offices. In 1998, the US population made an estimated 3.4 visits per
person, 45.6% of which were primary care visits. National estimates of primary care visit
rates and patient mix and practice pattern comparisons between hospital outpatient de-
partments and physicians' offices were similar in 1998 and 1994.
Conclusions Expanding community health centers will likely improve access to pri-
mary care for vulnerable US populations. However, enhancing access to of physicians'
offices is also needed to bolster the safety net. The greater service intensity and poorer
continuity for primary care visits in hospital outpatient departments that we observed
raises concern about the suitability of these clinics as primary care delivery sites.

vice mix for primary care visits made to
communityhealthcenters,hospitalout-
patient departments, and physicians'
offices. Using data from the 1998
NationalCenterforHealthStatisticssur-
veys,8,9 wealsoassesshowtheseprofiles
have changed over time.
METHODS
Data Sources
Visit data from physicians' offices were
obtained from the National Ambula-
tory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS).5
This survey's target universe included
visits made to nonfederally employed,
office-based physicians in the United
States; hospital outpatient depart-
ments were excluded. Selected physi-
cians completed questionnaires for a
systematic sample of patient visits made
during 1 week.
The 1994 National Hospital Ambu-
latory Medical Care Survey (NHAMCS)
was used for visits to hospital outpa-
tient departments.6 This survey's target
universe included visits made to outpa-
tient departments of nonfederal, short-
stay hospitals. Using patient records,
hospital staff completed question-
naires for a random sample of visits that
occurred during a randomly assigned
4-week reporting period. We excluded
visits made to emergency departments
from the sample.
In 1994, the BPHC replicated the
NHAMCS survey method (as described
above) for a probability sample of visits
madetocommunityhealthcenters.7 The
target universe included visits to com-
munity health centers, including all of
their delivery sites that received funds
through the BPHC grant program un-
der Section 330 of the Public Health Ser-
vice Act (42 USC 2546). Grantee cen-
ters in operation fewer than 2 years were
excluded from the sampling frame.
Additional details of the surveys'
methods are available elsewhere.5-7 The
response rates for in-scope physicians or
clinics were 95% for hospital outpa-
tient departments, 100% for commu-
nity health centers, and 70% for physi-
cians' offices. For the items in this study,
the survey instruments from all 3 data
sources used the same questions, which
were listed in the same order.
We also used the 1998 NAMCS8 and
1998 NHAMCS9 for a 1994-1998 time
trend analysis. Because physicians prac-
ticingincommunityhealthcenterswere
in-scope for the NAMCS, these 2 data
sources provided similar national esti-
mates as the 3 from 1994. The meth-
ods for the 1998 surveys were the same
as for counterparts done in 1994. Re-
sponse rates for in-scope physicians or
clinics in 1998 were 68% for physi-
cians' offices and 98% for hospital out-
patient departments.
Primary Care Visit Samples
Several exclusion criteria were ap-
plied to the data sets to obtain samples
of primary care visits. In the NAMCS
data sets, we selected visits made to gen-
eral pediatricians, family physicians,
general internists, and obstetricians/
gynecologists; in the NHAMCS data
sets, visits to medical, obstetric, and pe-
diatric clinics were selected; and in the
BPHC data set, we selected all visits
because community health centers are
organized to deliver primary care.
We removed visits made to special-
ists or specialized clinics falsely identi-
fied as generalists or general clinics
because self-designated specialty infor-
mation can overestimate the number
of generalist physicians.10 Physicians
in the NAMCS data set who did not
provide any preventive care (defined
by reasons for encounter and diagno-
sis codes) were excluded; similarly,
clinics in the NHAMCS data set that
did not provide preventive care during
at least 10% of their visits were
excluded. Physicians and clinics that
recorded at least 20 visits and gave
diagnosis codes in the same clinical
area (cardiology, endocrinology, etc)
for greater than 50% of these visits
also were excluded from the sample.
Applying these exclusion criteria
yielded unweighted sample sizes for
the 1994 data sets of 2878 (100% of
total) primary care visits made to 48
community health centers, 9853
(29.3% of total) made to offices of 409
physicians, and 10 371 (35.6% of
total) made to 162 hospital outpatient
departments. The exclusion criteria
applied to the 1998 data sets yielded
6913 visits (29.6% of total) made to
the offices of 263 physicians, and
11600 (39.4% of total) made to 175
hospital outpatient departments.
Variable Construction
Diagnosis and reason for encounter
codes were used to identify routine/
preventive care visits. Specific items
from each survey allowed further clas-
sification of patient presentation by new
vs established patients; among new pa-
tients, those referred by another phy-
sician; and among established pa-
tients, those presenting with new health
problems. (These items were not avail-
able in the 1998 surveys.) Higher per-
centages of established patients pre-
senting with new problems suggest
better continuity of care.11
The case-mix index was based on the
Johns Hopkins Adjusted Clinical
Groups (ACG) Case-Mix system.12 The
ACG system assigns all International
Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revi-
sion, Clinical Modification (ICD-9-
CM)13 codes to 1 of 32 morbidity
groups, or diagnostic groups called
ADGs. In all surveys, up to 3 ICD-
9-CM codes were recorded for each
visit; thus, each visit could be as-
signed up to 3 unique ADGs. The case-
mix index was the sum of ADG-
specific resource intensity weights. The
weights were obtained from ADG  co-
efficients derived from regression analy-
ses done for 4 large commercial health
plans in which total patient charges
were regressed on the 32 ADGs. (De-
tails of this method, including the spe-
cific weights used, are available from the
authors.) To simplify interpretation of
the case-mix index, raw scores were
standardized to a mean (SD) of 50 (10)
for the combined sample. Higher case-
mix index scores indicate greater medi-
cal complexity, sicker patients, and
higher expected resource use.
To assess visit intensity, we pre-
dicted the duration of each visit based
on the age and sex of the patient, type
of patient presentation, case-mix in-

ration is a method used previously in

oped in the 1980s using NAMCS data.
Visit duration weights were the  co-
efficients obtained from regressing visit
duration in minutes on the covariates
described above using generalist and
obstetric patient visits from the 1989-
1993 NAMCSs (http://www.cdc.gov

RESULTS
In 1994, approximately 747.8 million
outpatient visits were made to commu-
nity health centers, hospital outpatient
departments, and physicians' offices, a
rate of 2.9 visits per person (TABLE 1).
Of the 747.8 million visits, an esti-
mated 325 million (43.5%) were pri-
marycarevisits,arateof1.3primarycare
visits per person. Obstetric services for
pregnant women, defined by diagnosis
codes, comprised 5.8% of primary care
visits made to community health cen-
ters,3.9%tophysicians'offices,and3.9%
to hospital outpatient departments.
Community health centers consti-
tuted 4.0%, hospital outpatient depart-
ments 6.7%, and physicians' offices
89.3% of all primary care visits (Table
1). The distribution of primary care vis-
its for patients with either Medicaid or
no insurance was 10.6% to commu-
nity health centers, 11.5% to hospital
outpatient departments, and 77.9% to
physicians' offices. A similar distribu-
tion was found for primary care visits
made by ethnic minorities: 11.2% to
community health centers, 11.9% to
hospital outpatient departments, and
76.9% to physicians' offices. How-
ever, a smaller percentage of primary
care visits for ethnic minorities with ei-
ther Medicaid or no insurance were
made to physicians' offices: 19.6% to
community health centers, 17.5% to
hospital outpatient departments, and
62.9% to physicians' offices.
Patient Characteristics
The number, percent distribution, and
annual rates of primary care visits are
shown by delivery site and patient char-
acteristics in TABLE 2. Primary care vis-
its made by either uninsured persons
or those with Medicaid financing ac-
counted for 65.4% of those made to
community health centers, 43.0% to
hospital outpatient departments, and
only 18.5% to physicians' offices. Ru-
ral dwellers comprised 49.6% of com-
munity health center primary care vis-
its, which contrasted with 19.7% in
physicians' offices and 5.1% in hospi-
tal outpatient departments.
Compared with the white, non-His-
panic population, the overall primary
care visit rates to all 3 types of facili-
ties for the Hispanic population were
20% lower and 33% lower for the black,
non-Hispanic population. The Asian/

Pacific Islander and white, non-His-
panic populations had similar pri-
mary care visit rates.
For the Hispanic vs white, non-His-
panic populations, rates of primary care
visits made to community health cen-
ters were 700% higher, 79% higher to
hospital outpatient departments, but
35% lower to physicians' offices. For the
black, non-Hispanic vs white, non-
Hispanic populations, rates of primary
care visits made to community health
centers were 550% higher, 93% higher
to hospital outpatient departments, and
48% lower to physicians' offices.
Visit Complexity
TABLE 3 compares the type of patient
presentation, diagnostic case-mix of pa-
tients, and predicted visit duration of
primary care visits made to the 3 de-
livery sites. Among established pa-
tients, the odds that primary care vis-
its were for new health problems were
significantly higher in community
health centers compared with physi-
cians' offices and hospital outpatient de-
partments. A greater proportion of pri-
mary care visits made to hospital
outpatient departments were for new
patients, many of whom were physi-
cian-referred, than those made to phy-
sicians' offices.
Thecase-mixindexofpatientvisitswas
2.8% higher, suggesting a sicker patient
population,inhospitaloutpatientdepart-
ments than physicians' offices and was
similarbetweencommunityhealthcen-
tersandphysicians'offices(Table3).The
case-mix of primary care visits made by
the elderly population to the 3 types of
delivery sites was similar, whereas the
case-mix index for primary care visits
made by children and adolescents was
1.7% higher in community health cen-
ters and 4.7% higher in hospital outpa-
tientdepartmentsthanphysicians'offices.
Visit intensity is a measure of the pre-
dicteddurationofthevisitbasedonclini-
cal characteristics of the patient and the
type of patient presentation. The over-
all visit intensity of hospital outpatient
departments was 4.5% higher than phy-
sicians'offices(Table3).Thehighervisit
intensity in hospital outpatient depart-
ments translates into visits expected to
be about 40 seconds longer than those
in physicians' offices; visits for children
and adolescents were predicted to be
more than 2 minutes (132 seconds)
longer in hospital outpatient depart-
ments than physicians' offices.
Patient Management
TABLE 4 contrasts patient manage-
ment by primary care delivery site. The
adjusted odds ratio of blood pressure
checks during routine check-ups was
highest in hospital outpatient depart-
ments. Controlling for differences in pa-
tient case-mix and other characteris-
tics, the service intensity of hospital
outpatient department visits was higher
than those made to physicians' offices.

sicians' offices.
Time Trend Analysis:
Primary Care Visits in 1998
In 1998, the US population made an es-
timated 3.4 visits per person, 45.6% of
which were for primary care. Com-
pared with 1994, similar proportions of
visits were made to hospital outpatient
departmentsin1998(6.7%and6.9%,re-
spectively) and made by ethnic minori-
ties (20.9% vs 26.2%). The payer mix of
visits to physicians' offices and hospital
outpatientdepartmentsin1994and1998
was similar. In 1998, the case-mix of pa-
tient visits to hospital clinics was 3.9%
higher than physicians' offices; visit in-
tensity was 5.6% higher. For those man-
agement variables available in data sets
from both years, the trends in practice
patterns between hospital outpatient de-
partments and physicians' offices found
in 1994 held true in 1998.
COMMENT
This study used 3 nationally represen-
tative surveys to contrast primary care
visits made to community health cen-
ters,physicians'offices,andhospitalout-
patient departments. The US popula-
tion made an estimated 1.3 to 1.5
primary care visits per person per year,
which constituted 43.5% to 45.6% of all
ambulatory visits made to these deliv-
ery sites. Most primary care visits oc-
curred in physicians' offices, even for
vulnerable subpopulations identified by
a single personal characteristic, such as
race/ethnicity. However, about 40% of
primary care visits for ethnic minori-
ties with either no insurance or Medic-
aid were made to traditional safety-net
delivery sites, suchas communityhealth
centers and hospital outpatient depart-
ments. This finding demonstrates the
importance of examining the impact of
multiple vulnerable characteristics in
studies on access and service use.
Several caveats should be considered
when interpreting this study's data on
primary care visit rates. Some safety-
net delivery sites were not included. The
Veterans Affairs and Indian Health Ser-
vicenetworkofprimarycareclinicswere
not part of our combined database. Ex-
clusion of these federal delivery sites is
likelytohaveasmallimpactonvisitrates
estimates: it has been estimated that Vet-
erans Affairs clinics provide services to
about 1.7 million low-income veter-
ans.17 Althoughlocallyfundedhealthde-
partments were not explicitly evaluated
in this study, physicians in these deliv-
ery sites were in the sampling frame of
the NAMCS, and visits to them were cat-
egorized in the physicians' offices group.
Second, the sampling frame of the
NAMCS survey of physicians' offices ex-
cluded nurse practitioners and physi-
cian assistants, who are becoming in-
creasingly important in the provision of
primary care.18 Third, we used algo-
rithms to identify primary care provid-
ers in the 3 surveys and then classified
all visits to these physicians and clinics
as primary care. Our methods may have
overestimated the number of primary
care visits to the extent that generalist
physicians and obstetrician/gynecolo-
gists deliver some specialty care ser-
vices. On the other hand, the method
may have underestimated primary care
visits to the extent that specialists pro-
videprimarycare.Toexaminehowthese
potential biases may influence our esti-
mates, we examined the 1998 NAMCS
survey,8 which contained an item that
asked physicians to report whether they
were the patient's primary care practi-

tioner. Analysis revealed that 85.4% of
visits to generalist physicians, 24.6% to
obstetricians/gynecologists, and just
8.8% to specialists were for patients for
whomphysiciansreportedtheywerethe
primary care practitioner. Fourth, dif-
ferences in survey administration be-
tween the NAMCS (physicians com-
pleted the questionnaires) vs the other
2 surveys (medical record abstraction)
could affect the diagnosis coding and
thus the morbidity assessments. Analy-
sis of the ICD codes recorded for each
visit revealed no significant differences
in the mean numbers or the percent-
ages with more than 1 code among the
3 delivery sites.
Primary Care Visits
in Community Health Centers
Continuity of care, one of the hallmark
features of primary care,11 was better in
communityhealthcentersthanotherde-
livery sites. Established patients at com-
munity health centers were more likely
to present with new health problems
compared with the other delivery sites.
Better continuity of care allows practi-
tionerstousemorewatchfulwaitingand
employ health care resources more ju-
diciously, an association that helps ex-
plain the lower likelihood of pre-
scribedmedicationsduringprimarycare
visits to community health centers.
The medical complexity and patient
management of primary care visits in
community health centers compared fa-
vorably with physicians' offices. None
of the measures in this study, however,
assessed the social complexity of pa-
tients, which should be greater in com-
munity health centers because of their
higher burden of low-income patients.
The impact of patients' social risk on the
overall complexity and resultant re-
source intensity of primary care visits is
likely to have a positive effect.

However, for the comparative analyses
of patient mix and service use, no such
adjustmentwasmade.Thebiasthatmay
result from this overlap in sampling
framesislikelytobenegligiblebecause
the number of community health cen-
ter visits possibly included in the phy-
sicians' office sample was very small.
Primary Care Visits in Hospital
Outpatient Departments
The medical complexity of patient vis-
its in hospital outpatient departments
was greater than those made to other
delivery sites. Using a measure of visit
intensity that predicted the visit dura-
tion,weestimatedthatthepatientpopu-
lationvisitinghospitaloutpatientdepart-
ments was 4% to 6% sicker than the
population visiting physicians' offices.
Thisestimateisconsistentwiththestudy
by Lion and Altman14 from the 1970s,
whichusedasimilarmeasureandfound
5% to 15% higher visit intensity at hos-
pital outpatient departments vs physi-
cians' offices. An important clinical
implication of the greater visit intensity
isthatprimarycarevisitstohospitalclin-
ics may last longer than those to physi-
cians'offices--asmuchas2minutesper
visit for children and adolescents.
Even after differences in case-mix and
other patient characteristics were con-
trolled for, the service intensity among
primary care visits in hospital outpa-
tient departments exceeded that of vis-
its made to physicians' offices. Hospi-
tal outpatient department visits were
more likely than visits to physicians' of-
fices to be associated with a specialty
referral, minor surgery, and imaging
studies. These findings are consistent
with studies using Medicaid claims data
that showed patients who use hospital
outpatient departments incurred higher
risk-adjusted expenditures than those

who used physicians' office.19,20 Greater
resource use in hospital outpatient de-
partments could be a consequence of
better availability of ancillary and spe-
cialty services. Furthermore, the poorer
continuity of care among visits to hos-
pital outpatient departments may con-
tribute to a more aggressive practice
style, because of less familiarity with pa-
tients' health histories. Greater ser-
vice intensity and poorer continuity of
care in hospital outpatient clinics com-
pared with other delivery sites also raise
the concern over the suitability of these
clinics as primary care delivery sites.
However, until studies are done that
compare health outcomes across deliv-
ery sites, we can make no conclusions
about which service use rate is best.
Policy Implications
The main findings from this study are
fromdatacollectedin1994.Toassessthe
applicability of these data for current
policy decisions, we conducted sensitiv-
ity analyses using data from 1998. Our
findings showed remarkable similarity
between the 1994 and 1998 results, sug-
gesting that our primary care visit analy-
ses are applicable to current health care
policy. Overall primary care visit rates
andpatient mixwere similar, and higher
service intensity in hospital outpatient
departments compared with physi-
cians' offices was found in both years.
This sensitivity analysis was limited by
notincludingspecificcommunityhealth
centerestimatesandnotexplicitlyevalu-
ating the impact of managed care. Some
safety-net delivery sites have been re-
sponding to the pressures of health care
systemchangebyformingintegratedde-
livery systems and expanding their con-
tracts with managed care plans to at-
tractpayingpatients.21 Despitethesenew
organizational arrangements, the pa-
tientandpayermixatcommunityhealth
centers has remained relatively con-
stant over this time period, according to
BPHC estimates (Jerrilynn Regan, MSN,
MPA, BPHC, Health Resources and
Services Administration, oral commu-
nication, August 2000).
Our estimates indicate that 1 in 25
primary care visits in the nation oc-
curred in community health centers.
The patient population making visits to
community health centers was charac-
terized by larger shares of ethnic mi-
norities, individuals with Medicaid or
no insurance, rural dwellers, and
women receiving obstetric services
compared with the other 2 delivery
sites. An important implication of these
findings is that federal policy that af-
fects the financing or organization of
community health centers will have its
greatest impact on access for these vul-
nerable subpopulations.
This study documented large in-
equalities between ethnic minorities
and whites in primary care visit rates.
Compared with the white population,
the Hispanic population made 20%
fewer primary care visits per person and
the black, non-Hispanic population
made 33% fewer primary care visits per
person. Can expansions in the capac-
ity of community health centers--the
main federal policy lever for improv-
ing nonfinancial access to care for vul-
nerable populations--eliminate these
disparities? If the number of commu-
nity health centers were doubled and
the composition of patient popula-
tions did not change for the delivery
sites, the white-Hispanic primary care
visit disparity would be reduced by
50%, but the white-black disparity
would be reduced by just 24%. These
are significant reductions in access dis-
parities and move our nation closer to
a more equitable primary care system.
However, eliminating race/ethnicity
inequalities in use of primary care will
require policy directed at improving
vulnerable populations' access to main-
stream physicians' offices as well as tra-
ditional safety-net delivery site.
