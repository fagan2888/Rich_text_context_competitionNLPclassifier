Age Trends in Femur Stresses From a Simulated Fall on the Hip
Among Men and Women: Evidence of Homeostatic Adaptation
Underlying the Decline in Hip BMD
Thomas J Beck,1 Anne C Looker,2 Firas Mourtada,3 Maithili M Daphtary,1 and Christopher B Ruff4
ABSTRACT: Age trends in proximal femur stresses were evaluated by simulating a fall on the greater
trochanter using femur geometry from hip DXA scans of 5334 white men and women in the NHANES III
survey. Expansion of femur outer diameter seems to counter net bone loss so that stresses remain similar
across age groups, but stresses are higher in older women than in older men.
Introduction: The age decline in hip BMD is caused by both bone loss and expansion of outer diameter that
increases the region size over which mass is measured in a DXA scan. Because expansion has an opposing
effect on structural strength, it may be a homeostatic adaptation to net bone loss to ensure that load stresses
are kept within a narrow range.
Materials and Methods: Age trends in femur stresses were evaluated with an engineering beam simulation of
a fall on the greater trochanter. Hip geometry was extracted from hip DXA scans using the Hip Structure
Analysis (HSA) software on 2613 non-Hispanic white men and 2721 women from the third National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III). Using body weight as load, stresses were computed on the
inferior-medial and superior-lateral femur neck at its narrowest point and the medial and lateral shaft 2 cm
distal to the midpoint of the lesser trochanter. Stresses and the underlying geometries in men and women >50
years oaf age were compared with those 20­49 years of age.
Results: Compared with men <50 years of age, stresses in older men were 6% lower on both surfaces of the
shaft, 4% lower on the inferior-medial neck, and not different on the superior-lateral neck. In women >50
years of age, stresses on the proximal shaft and inferior-medial neck remained within 3% of young values but
were 13% greater on the superior-lateral neck. Neck stresses in young women were lower on the superior-
lateral than the inferior-medial neck, but lateral stress increased to the level on the medial surface in older
women. Stresses were higher in women than in men, with a greater gender difference in those >50 years of age.
Conclusions: We conclude that femur expansion has a homeostatic effect in men and women that opposes
bone loss so that stresses change little with age. Because expansion preserves stresses with progressively less
bone mass, the process may reduce structural stability in the femoral neck under fall conditions, especially in
the elderly female.

INTRODUCTION
THE CLINICAL COMMUNITY and much of the aging public
are familiar with the way that BMD changes over the
human lifetime. In both men and women, BMD increases
during skeletal growth, peaks in young adulthood, and de-
clines gradually thereafter, somewhat more quickly after
menopause in women. Because low BMD is firmly linked
to osteoporotic fractures, it is broadly believed that the
decline in BMD represents a gradual reduction in mechani-
cal strength that ultimately results in fragility. However, a
gradual decline in strength through adulthood would sug-
gest that homeostasis was generally deficient in adult bones.
However, the biological evidence that bone tissue is self-
renewing and that it dynamically adapts to changing load-
ing conditions throughout life is quite compelling. There-
fore, how can we reconcile the seemingly inconsistent
picture presented by the BMD data and the biological evi-
dence of homeostasis? From a mechanical perspective,
bones can weaken by altering the structural geometry so

that load stresses increase or by degrading the material so
that the tissue fails at a lower level of stress (ultimate
stress). The general consensus is that age changes predomi-
nately alter the amount and distribution of the bone mate-
rial within the bone (i.e., structural geometry), with little
influence on the ultimate stress.(1,2) (We do not imply that
material changes play no role in osteoporotic fragility but
that age changes are mainly geometric; see discussion.) If
homeostasis is actually effective, it must alter the geometry
to keep load stresses relatively constant, but to be consis-
tent with the BMD data, it must do so in a way that permits
a decline in BMD and an increase in fracture risk.
The answer to this quandary may be evident in a closer
look at the trends in femoral neck BMD data from the third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) of the noninstitutionalized U.S. population.
Because the length of the neck region normally takes a
default value, expansion of region area should be caused
by widening of the bone outer margins. We present data
that suggest the downward trend with age in femoral neck
BMD in both men and women is faster than the trend in
bone mass (BMC). These data will suggest that the net
bone loss apparent in BMC trends is opposed by expan-
sion of outer diameter. We previously showed the expan-
sion of bone outer margins in a geometric analysis of the
same data by the Hip Structure Analysis (HSA) method.(3)
The latter effect may be a generalized characteristic of ag-
ing long bones.(3­8) It has been speculated to have a ho-
meostatic purpose, because as diameter is increased, bend-
ing stiffness requires progressively less material in the cross-
section.(4,6,9)
It is not known whether the expansion of diameter is
actually sufficient to offset bone loss so that maximum
stresses do not increase with age. Because we have previ-
ously derived the hip structural geometry on the hip scans
from the NHANES III survey by the HSA method,(3) these
data can be combined with anthropometry to derive an
estimate of mechanical stress so that age trends may be
evaluated in adult men and women. We chose to estimate
stresses in a simulation of a fall on the greater trochanter
because most hip fractures are believed to occur in that
mode.(10) Our working hypothesis was that the expansion
of femur diameter is sufficient to compensate net bone loss
so that stresses change little with age.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
Data were taken from NHANES III, conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics, Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, between 1988 and 1994. The sur-
vey used a stratified, multistage probability design to select
the sample, and collected data through household inter-
views and by direct standardized physical examinations
conducted in specially equipped mobile examination cen-
ters. The survey has been described in detail elsewhere.(16)
Men and nonpregnant women 20 years of age who re-
ceived the physical examination in the mobile centers were
eligible for bone densitometry unless they had fractured
both hips previously. Acceptable hip bone mineral mea-
surements were obtained on 14,646 men and women 20
years of age. As summarized elsewhere, structural analysis
could not be done on 1031 for technical reasons, leaving a
total of 13,615 scans.(3) This represents 59% of the eligible
selected sample, 72% of the eligible interviewed sample,
and 82% of the eligible examined sample. Race and eth-
nicity were self-reported in NHANES III. This study was
restricted to 5334 non-Hispanic whites (2613 men and 2721
women).
Anthropometry and body composition
Upper leg length was measured as the distance between
the inguinal crease and anterior surface of the thigh proxi-
mal to the patella with the respondent seated and with the
right knee bent at a 90° angle.(11)
Bone densitometry and HSA
The left hip was scanned unless there was a history of
previous fracture or surgery; only 1% received a scan of the
right femur. Because their inclusion did not alter estimates,
those who received a scan of the right femur were included.
Measurements were obtained with three Hologic QDR
1000 DXA scanners (Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA), lo-
cated in mobile examination centers. A rigorous quality
control (QC) program was used throughout the study to
ensure data quality.(12)
The HSA method for extracting cross-sectional geometry
from bone mass image data is based on principles first de-
scribed by Martin and Burr.(13) At a site where the cross-
section is to be evaluated, a line of pixel values traversing
the bone axis is extracted from the image. The resulting
profile is a mass projection of the corresponding cross-
section and can be used to describe its geometry relevant to
scan plane stresses. Although current HSA algorithms av-
erage geometry over five parallel profiles, three profiles
were used in the early version on NHANES III. The (blur-
corrected) profile width measures bone outer diameter. Av-
erage pixel value, calibrated in grams per centimeter
squared of hydroxyapatite yields conventional BMD. Di-
viding profile pixel values by the effective mineral density
of fully mineralized bone (1.051 g/cm3)(13) converts them to
equivalent linear thickness of bone tissue in centimeters,
exclusive of soft tissue (trabecular, vascular, etc.) spaces.
The integral of the resulting thickness profile yields the
total surface area of (cortical + trabecular) bone in the
cross-section (CSA). After determining the profile center
of mass, the cross-sectional moment of inertia (CSMI) is
derived as the integral of area times the square of distance
from the center of mass. Section modulus (Z) is computed
by dividing CSMI by the maximum distance from the center
of mass to the medial or lateral outer surface. Note that
CSMI and Z by this method are only relevant for bending
in the image plane unless the cross-section is axially sym-
metric.
Stress analysis
Stresses were computed at two cross-sections in the
proximal femur using a formalism described previously for

a continuum model of the femur in a simulation of a fall
with impact on the greater trochanter.(14) Because of limi-
tations of a 2D image, force vectors were restricted to the
DXA image plane; all stresses were computed using body
weight as equivalent to the ground reaction force. The
ground reaction force was oriented along the bisector of the
neck and shaft axes, and the body load was distributed to
achieve static equilibrium along antiparallel vectors
through the center of the femoral head and the midpoint of
the femoral shaft. Measurements of neck-shaft angle and
distances between load vectors and section positions were
derived from the HSA program; thigh length was incorpo-
rated from external anthropometry. Maximum stresses
were computed at the medial and lateral margins of two
cross-sections: across the narrowest point of the femoral
neck and across the proximal femoral shaft at a point 2 cm
distal to the midpoint of the lesser trochanter (to eliminate
size effects on placement, more recent HSA algorithms
place the shaft region at a distance of 1.5 times the mini-
mum neck width distal to the intersection of the neck and
shaft axes). The HSA program measured the loci of these
sections relative to load vectors within the scan plane.
Using standard engineering beam theory, bending stress
was computed at the outer margin of the medial and lateral
cortices of the cross-section as equation:

b
 My/I
Where M is the bending moment, y is the distance from the
center of mass of the cross-section to the medial or lateral
margin, and I is the CSMI. The bending moment was com-
puted as the orthogonal component of the load multiplied
by distance to the section location, measured parallel to the
neck or shaft axis as appropriate. By convention, y in the
direction of bending is positive and negative in the opposing
direction (lateral and medial, respectively). Axial stress was
computed as:

c
 Fa
/A
Where Fa
is the axial component of the load, and A is bone
CSA.
Statistics
To determine whether age has an effect on stresses, mean
values were compared between 20­49 and 50+ years of age
for men and women separately. To examine gender differ-
ences, mean values were compared between sexes for the
younger (20­49 years) and older (50+ years) age groups.
The same group comparisons were done for conventional
femoral neck BMD, BMC, and bone area, as well as BMD
and geometric properties at the two proximal femur regions
for HSA variables. All group differences were evaluated
with p < 0.05 as significant using an unpaired two-tailed
t-test. Analyses were performed using SUDAAN,(15) a fam-
ily of statistical procedures for analysis of data from com-
plex sample surveys.
RESULTS
Trends in femur neck BMC, BMD, bone area, and
outer diameter
Figures 1A and 1B shows femur neck BMC data by de-
cade in non-Hispanic white men and women, respectively,
after normalizing values to those of young adults so that
cross-sectional patterns by age are easily seen. For compari-
son purposes, Fig. 1 also shows data for BMD, bone area,
and outer diameter (width); the BMD and outer diameter
data have been published previously.(4) Means for these
variables are compared between young and old age groups
in Table 1. It can be seen that the apparent age decline in
bone mass (BMC) is smaller than that in BMD and that this
is caused by higher values for bone area with increasing age.
The expansion of the Hologic neck bone area (FNBA) is
likely explained by the expansion of the outer diameter of
the neck with age as documented by the HSA method.
Stresses
Mean values by decade of medial and lateral stresses are

STRESS HOMEOSTASIS IN THE AGING PROXIMAL FEMUR 1427
for men and women. To evaluate age and gender effects,
the mean stresses for young (<50 years) and old (50 years)
men and women are compared in Table 2. Stresses appear
lower in men than in women at both neck and shaft; differ-
ences were significant (Table 2). At the neck in both men
and women, stresses are lower on the superior-lateral sur-
face than on the inferior-medial surface, and these differ-
ences disappear with age. Medial and lateral stresses are
comparable (within 3% in women and 1% in men) in the
shaft in both genders through the age span. Inferior-medial
neck stresses in women vary little with age (Fig. 2A), and
differences between young and old women are not signifi-
cant. However, superior-lateral neck stresses in women do
increase substantially by 13% between young and old age
groups. Shaft stresses in women are significantly, albeit
slightly, higher in older women on both surfaces. At the
femur neck in men, inferior-medial stresses are on average
4% lower than in younger individuals. At both shaft sur-
faces in men, the apparent decline with age is more evident,
so that stresses in older men are 6% less than in younger
counterparts.
Table 1 shows gender and age group differences in body
weight, conventional DXA parameters at the femoral neck,
and geometry at the femoral neck and proximal shaft. The
men were, of course, heavier than women, but within gen-
der, there was little difference in weight between younger
and older groups. The well-known age differences in con-
ventional BMD in both men and women are evident as are
the opposing age differences in BMC and in FNBA. The
age group BMD differences from the HSA analysis are
consistent with their conventional counterparts at the neck
and are smaller in both genders at the shaft. Note that the
age group difference in bone width is similar at the neck
and shaft and across genders. The effects of the apparent
expansion of diameter on BMD and geometry are complex;
they differ between shaft and neck and across genders. At
the shaft in men, greater width essentially explains why
BMD is lower in the older group; the apparent decline in
the amount of bone (CSA) in the cross-section does not
reach significance. In older women, however, expansion of
diameter is responsible for approximately one third of the
15% lower BMD. At the neck in both men and women,
roughly one third of the age difference in BMD is caused by
an expanded diameter. The effects of diameter differences
on CSMI are nonlinear, because this parameter varies as
the fourth power of the outer radius. In older men and
women, CSMIs in the femoral shaft were significantly
larger by 10% and 6% respectively, compared with the
younger group. At the femoral neck, the CSMI in older
men and women was within 3% of the young value, al-
though an increase was apparent in men and a decline in
women. The strong dependence of CSMI on outer diameter
explains the rather large gender difference in this bending
property; and like most other parameters, the gender dif-
ference was greater in the older age group. At the neck, the
center of mass (centroid position) shifted medially with age
in both genders but significantly more so in women. No
shift was apparent in the shafts of men, and only a slight
medial shift was seen in women.
DISCUSSION
We hypothesized that the expansion of femur diameter
with age represents a homeostatic adaptation that opposes
the effects of bone loss so that load stresses remain con-
stant. Our results are generally consistent with this hypoth-
esis, with one exception: superior-lateral neck stress was
13% higher in older women than in younger women. How-

ever, stresses on the inferior-medial neck and both surfaces
of the shaft in women remained within 3% of young values.
Among men, stresses on the medial neck and both surfaces
of the shaft were actually slightly lower in older men rela-
tive to younger men. Like the pattern in women, stresses on
the lateral neck surface in men were greater in the older
group, but unlike women, the difference did not reach sig-
nificance. In both younger men and women, femoral neck
stresses were lower on the superior-lateral than on the in-
ferior-medial surface, and magnitudes converged after age
50. The apparent age increase in superior-lateral stress that
produced convergence is only significant in females and
seems to be caused by an inferior-medial shift in the femo-
ral neck center of mass (i.e., centroid position; also appar-
ent to a lesser extent in males). Together with the increase
in neck diameter, the shift increases the value of y in Eq. 1,
with a greater effect in females. It is interesting that,
whereas the superior-lateral neck stress shows an apparent
increase with age in women, the magnitude only rises to the
higher level seen on the inferior-medial neck surface. Over-
all, these findings suggest that, in a fall on the greater tro-
chanter, the resulting stresses would differ little between
younger and older individuals, and the only substantial age
difference is on the superior-lateral neck in women.
In contrast to the general lack of differences by age, we
found gender differences worthy of comment. Stresses gen-
erated in a fall are higher in women than in men, and this
effect is greater in older individuals. The changes in cross-
sectional geometry that explain the stress differences with
age and gender are quite clear. The expansion of diameter
does seem to offset bone loss, but there are subtle conse-
quences of the process that may not be advantageous under
the conditions of a fall. In normal upright ambulation, the
femur is bent in the opposite direction than in the fall mode.
This means that in normal ambulatory activity, bending
stresses on the superior-lateral neck surface are in tension
and the thicker inferior-medial cortex is in compression.
The reverse is true in the fall mode, where the thinner
superior-lateral surface is in compression. Physiologic loads
add axial forces that subtract from the tensile stresses
caused by bending on the superior-lateral surface and that
add to the compressive stress on the inferior-medial neck.
Effectively, the lateral neck is relatively unloaded during
normal ambulation(16); thus, peak stresses that drive adap-
tation are concentrated on the medial surface where corti-
ces seem not to thin with age.(17) The resulting redistribu-
tion of material in the aging neck shifts the center of mass
toward the medial surface. Bending stresses (Eq. 1) are
inversely dependent on I/y, where y is the distance from the
center of mass to the medial or lateral surface for the re-
spective stresses. In long bones, y generally increases with
age because of expansion of diameter that displaces the
cortical surface farther from the center of mass. This age-
dependent increase in y is greater on the lateral neck be-
cause of the additional effect of the inferior-medial shift in
the center of mass. The larger medial shift in women is
likely the main reason why superior-lateral neck stresses
are higher in older women, whereas inferior-medial stresses
are not. Mayhew et al.(17) recently described the age shift in
femoral neck center-of-mass in a study that analyzed CT
scans of the femoral neck in a cross-sectional sample of 77
adult cadaver specimens. They conjectured that the shift is
caused by adaptation to habitual patterns of ambulatory
stresses that are less varied in modern inactive populations
than in more primitive ones.
The finding that load stresses vary little with age con-
trasts starkly with the epidemiological evidence of increas-
ing hip fracture rates in old age and with age patterns in
BMD. They are, however, remarkably consistent with the
geometric findings of Russo et al.(18) based on quantitative
CT scans of the tibia in a cross-sectional sample of Italian
adults. In both men and women, they showed an upward
trend in the external dimensions of tibial cross-sections that
seemed to preserve resistance to bending stress.(18) If the
geometric adaptation that underlies declining areal BMD

ensures that stresses remain relatively constant with age,
why do bones become fragile in old age? One explanation
might be that changes in the material strength may reduce
the stress capacity of old bones or at least in those who
suffer fractures.(19) There is a great deal of semantic con-
fusion regarding material properties in the literature be-
cause of differences in their definition. Strictly speaking,
material properties refer to the mechanical behavior of
bone tissue under load and are a function of the tissue
composition (i.e., properties of the organic matrix, osteon
substructure, mineralization, accumulated microdamage).
There are no reliable methods for noninvasive measure-
ment of bone tissue material properties in vivo, and spe-
cialized methods such as nanoindentation are required for
their evaluation from biopsies.(20) Certain practical issues
have resulted in an alternative definition, which is more
properly termed apparent material properties. Traditional
engineering tests of material properties use specimens ma-
chined to standardized geometric dimensions so that and
any differences in load behavior are caused by material
properties and not differences in stress. Bone specimens
machined to typical test sizes, however, vary in porosity,
especially in aging cortical bone and trabecular specimens.
Stresses are really not constant because applied loads are
supported by varying amounts and arrangements of mate-
rial hence measurements reflect only "apparent" material
properties. Work by several investigators showed that age
dependence and osteoporotic differences in apparent prop-
erties are mainly caused by porosity,(1,2,21) with little sys-
tematic change at the tissue level. If bone microstructure is
measured with sufficient resolution, apparent material
properties are unnecessary, and CT methods capable of
doing so in vivo at certain extremity sites(22) have become
available. Finite element analysis (FEA) models evaluate
irregular structures by breaking them into small box-like
elements. Models with millions of microelements small
enough to evaluate the fine trabecular structure have been
developed from CT data. Because computational de-
mands scale with numbers of elements, such high-resolution
models require massively parallel supercomputers and hun-
dreds of hours of computation time (see van Rietbergen et
al.(23) and Eswaran et al.(22) for examples). FEA models
with element sizes of a few millimeters are far more man-
ageable and correspond better to resolution capabilities of
high-end total body CT scanners. However, because the
fine structure cannot actually be resolved, the concept of
apparent material properties is a convenient method way of
handling their effects. Apparent material properties are
also unnecessary in analyses derived from DXA, not be-
cause the microstructure is imaged, but because porosity
effects are eliminated. Only the mineral mass is projected
into the DXA image plane; the surrounding or internal soft
tissues are subtracted out by the dual-energy mathematics.
Effectively, pores within cortical or trabecular bone are col-
lapsed out and are thus not present in the cross-sectional
geometry measured from the mineral mass profiles. Al-
though it does not seem to be a general effect of age or
osteoporosis, degraded material strength may play a role in
some osteoporotic fractures, although current noninvasive
imaging methods are not yet capable of quantifying it.
Age-related loss of bone strength can only be caused by
increased stresses (degraded geometry) or reduced stress
capacity of the material. Here we argue that age-related
strength loss is probably not in the (actual) material prop-
erties and doesn't seem to be in the geometry according to
our calculations. Macroscopic properties such as CSA and
CSMI are integrated over the whole cross-section; however,
under compressive loads, thin-walled structures can exhibit
local failure of a portion of the cross-section, and in such
cases, stresses are underestimated by the CSA and
CSMI.(24) There is little doubt that the aging femoral neck
cross-sections exhibit cortical thinning with age, albeit pref-
erentially on surfaces that are not heavily loaded in normal
ambulation.(17) Together with expansion of outer diameter
and bending the thinning surface in a fall, these geometric
changes should cause strength loss caused by the contribu-
tion of local buckling as speculated by Mayhew et al.(17)
Further work will be needed to determine if this is theoret-
ically likely with geometries that are achieved in osteopo-
rotic bones.
There are a number of methodological limitations to this
work. The DXA-based geometry method restricts cross-
sectional moments of inertia and thus the stress analysis to
the 2D image plane; conclusions cannot be drawn regarding
out-of-plane stresses. Because DXA methods cannot evalu-
ate material effects, the entire analysis assumes that all dif-

ferences are geometric, although this is actually true of
most engineering analyses of bone to date. As we have
pointed out, it is possible that some age changes alter ma-
terial strength at the tissue level, although such effects can
only be reliably evaluated by biopsy methods at present. It
is also important to recognize that the apparent changes in
geometry that are responsible for keeping stresses relatively
constant with age are an adaptive response to loading con-
ditions experienced in normal activity; bones certainly don't
adapt to remain strong under the conditions of a fall on the
hip as evaluated here. Ultimately a stress analysis should be
repeated on a data set that has sufficient information to
simulate physiologic loading configurations and magnitudes
(which are probably not best characterized by body weight)
so that adaptive changes across the age span can be better
evaluated.
Because the NHANES sample is cross-sectional, cohort
effects could confound the age trends described in this
study. Cross-sectional age patterns in femur BMD have
been shown to differ from longitudinally determined age
patterns,(25) so those observed here need to be confirmed
prospectively. Other limitations of the NHANES data in-
clude the exclusion of institutionalized persons from the
sampling frame; they may have lower BMD and potentially
different geometry. Finally, some individuals who were se-
lected for the survey did not participate. However, a pre-
vious analysis suggested that nonrespondents did not differ
importantly from respondents.(4)
We conclude that the expansion of diameter that par-
tially explains the reduction in BMD of the aging proximal
femur represents a homeostatic adaptation that offsets the
apparent net loss of bone mass observed in aging men and
women participating in the NHANES survey. Despite sig-
nificantly lower BMD levels in older men and women,
proximal femur stresses generated in a simulation of a fall
on the greater trochanter were similar in older versus
younger persons. A modestly higher stress on the superior-
lateral surface in older women seems to be caused by a
shift in the center of mass, so that in a fall configuration,
the cortex may experience higher stresses in compression.
When combined with greater cortical thinning with age
in an expanded diameter, that surface may be more sus-
ceptible to fractures initiated by buckling instability in
elderly women if they fall with impact on the greater tro-
chanter.
