Church-Based and Secular Social Support on
Self-Rated Health in Late Life

Objectives. The purpose of this study is to see if emotional support received from fellow church members and
emotional support from secular social networks reduce the effects of financial strain on self-rated health. A second goal is
to determine if church-based social support is a more important coping resource for older Blacks than for older Whites.
Methods. The data come from the second wave of interviews with a nationwide sample of older people. Two groups of
older adults are included in the analyses: Older Christians who go to church more than twice a year (N ¼ 548) and older
people who do not go to church as frequently (N ¼ 238).
Results. The data suggest that support from fellow church members tends to reduce the impact of financial strain on
self-rated health, but support from secular network members fails to exert a similar effect. The findings also reveal that the
stress-buffering effects of church-based support emerge among older Blacks, but not older Whites.
Discussion. The findings from this study suggest that there may be something relatively unique about support that is
provided by fellow church members.
DURING the past several decades, researchers have con-
ducted a number of studies to see if greater involvement
in religion is associated with better physical and mental health
(Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). Taken as a whole, this
literature reveals that religion may serve some health-protective
or health-enhancing function, but it is not clear why this may
be so (Krause, 2004). The identification of a clear causal
mechanism is important because, as Bradley and Schaefer
(1998) convincingly argue, ``. . . a claim of causality is
fundamentally interpretative. Its credibility depends on the
presentation of a mechanism that substantial numbers of people
find compelling'' (pp. 166­167). Some investigators maintain
that the health-related benefits of religion may be traced to the
fact that it helps people cope more effectively with adversity
(Pargament, 1997). But there is still a lot we do not know about
this coping process.
Researchers have argued for some time that informal social
relationships that arise within a church tend to be especially
close and highly supportive (Ellison & Levin, 1998). This is
important because a considerable number of studies that were
conducted in secular settings indicate that older people with
strong social support networks are able to cope more
effectively with stress than are older adults who do not
maintain meaningful social relationships with others (Krause,
2001). Given this extensive body of secular work, it is
surprising to find that the potential stress-buffering role of
church-based social support has been largely overlooked in the
literature. Ellison and his colleagues conducted one of the few
studies on this issue (Ellison, Boardman, Williams, & Jackson,
2001). They were unable to find evidence that church-based
social support reduces the noxious effects of stress on either
psychological distress or psychological well-being. But it is
important to continue work in this area because Ellison and
colleagues focused solely on mental health outcomes. As
a result, we do not know if church-based social support
reduces the effects of stress on other outcomes, such as self-
rated health.
The purpose of the present study is to see if church-based
social support reduces the effects of stress on the self-rated
health of older adults. In the process, two issues are examined
that have not been evaluated empirically by other investigators.
First, the wide majority of older adults maintain close
relationships with family members and friends who do not
worship with them. This raises the possibility that support
provided by either fellow church members or secular social
network members (or both) may help older people cope with
stress. Put another way, we need to know if there is something
unique about the stress-buffering properties of church-based
social support, or whether it has the same effect as support in
the secular world. Second, a growing body of research indicates
that older African Americans tend to receive more support from
their fellow church members than do older Whites (Taylor,
Chatters, & Levin, 2004). This research raises the possibility
that church-based social support systems are an especially
important coping resource for older Blacks. Unfortunately, this
issue has been largely overlooked in the literature.
CHURCH-BASED SOCIAL SUPPORT, STRESS, AND
SELF-RATED HEALTH
The theoretical underpinnings of this study are presented
below in three sections. The potentially unique aspects of
church-based social support are examined first. Following this,
evidence is provided which suggests that older Blacks may
derive greater benefits than may older Whites from church-
based social support. Finally, an effort is made to show why it

is important to explore the effects of church-based social
support with data provided by older people.
Church-Based Versus Secular Social Support
As Ellison and Levin (1998) point out, there are at least two
reasons why church-based social support may be an especially
effective coping resource. The first has to do with beliefs about the
nature of stress and suffering, and the second involves the motives
for helping people who are in need. Individuals who worship in
the same congregation tend to have a shared set of values and
beliefs that are based on a common faith and shared religious
teachings. A good deal of these shared beliefs involve issues
related specifically to stress. In particular, people who worship
together tend to have common views about why there is pain and
suffering in the world. Moreover, there is often a shared sense
that God has a reason for the things that happen in life, and that
adversity may eventually lead to personal growth and de-
velopment (Linley & Joseph, 2003). But perhaps most impor-
tantly, these beliefs and values form the basis for developing and
sharing religious coping responses that are designed to help the
faithful overcome the inevitable problems that arise in life
(Krause, Ellison, Shaw, Marcum, & Boardman, 2001).
Coupled with these stress-specific beliefs is a strong motiva-
tion for helping others that, once again, arises from shared
religious principles. The older people in this study are primarily
members of the Christian faith. This faith encourages a number
of beliefs and behaviors that promote and enhance the help-
giving process. More specifically, sacred texts encourage people
to love one another, help those who are in need, and forgive
others for things they have done wrong. Moreover, help-
providers are taught to give without expecting anything in return.
Research in secular settings helps to show why these
religiously based helping motives are important. In reading
secular research on stress and social support, one is often left
with the impression that people always actively seek out, and
gratefully receive, assistance from others during difficult times.
But as research reviewed by Eckenrode and Wethington (1990)
reveals, this may not always be true. More specifically, these
investigators argue that people may be reluctant to turn to
others for assistance when the event that confronts them is
stigmatizing, embarrassing, or is perceived to be caused by their
own limitations or inaction. The helping motives encouraged by
religion may foster a welcoming and trusting interpersonal
atmosphere that makes it easier for fellow church members to
reach out to each other during difficult times.
Other aspects of congregational life may serve to enhance the
quality of church-based social support. Research by Krause and
Wulff (2005) suggests that some older people have attended
worship services in the same congregation for decades. As
a result, they have shared rituals with fellow church members
that signal major passages in life, such as christenings, weddings,
and funerals. These experiences generate shared memories that
are charged with emotion and valued highly (Wuthnow, 1999).
This shared history may provide fertile ground in which
religiously based helping motives can be put into action.
Some of the attributes associated with church-based support
may be found in the secular world as well. For example,
members of the local Rotary Club may engage in charitable
activities without expecting compensation for what they have
done. But what sets church-based support apart from assistance
in the secular world is that support in religious settings is
imbued with the mantle of religious authority. Simply put, the
basis for helping others, and the nature of the assistance that is
provided, is thought to explicitly emanate from the word of
God. And people who believe this may be more likely to
engage in the sanctioned helping behaviors and take steps to
ensure that these supportive acts are performed in a way that is
consistent with the fundamental tenets of the faith.
Exploring Variations by Race
For more than 100 years, scholars and theologians have
argued that social support networks are especially well
developed in the Black church. Writing in 1887, Du Bois
concluded that, ``The Negro church . . . provides social inter-
course, it provides amusements of various kinds, it serves as
a newspaper and intelligence bureau, it supplants the theater, it
directs the picnic and excursion, it furnishes the music, it in-
troduces the stranger to the community, it serves as a lyceum, li-
brary, and lecture bureau--it is, in fine, the central organ of the
organized life of the American Negro'' (Du Bois, 2000, p. 21).
Although Du Bois made these observations more than a century
ago, more recent evidence indicates that the church continues to
be a major source of social support for African Americans. For
example, the noted Black theologian J. Deotis Roberts argues
that, ``The Black church, as a social and religious body, has
served as a kind of `extended family' for Blacks. In a real sense,
then, thousands of Blacks who have never known real family
life have discovered the meaning of real kinship in the Black
church'' (Goatley, 2003, p. 78). Support for these observations
of Roberts is provided in a study by Krause (2002). His findings
indicate that older Blacks get more emotional support from
fellow church members than do older Whites.
There are both historical and cultural reasons why the church
has assumed such a prominent position in the Black community.
With respect to history, a number of researchers maintain that
the church became the social center of the community because
of centuries of prejudice and discrimination. More specifically,
Black people turned to the church for social as well as spiritual
sustenance because it was the only institution in the community
that was built, funded, and wholly controlled by Black people
(Nelsen & Nelsen, 1975). Cultural factors may come into play
as well. Baldwin and Hopkins (1990) have gone to great
lengths to identify the key elements of the African American
worldview or culture. They argue that African American culture
is characterized by its emphasis on harmony, cooperation,
collective responsibility, ``groupness,'' and ``sameness.'' These
cultural characteristics are likely to permeate the Black church,
giving rise to strong church-based social support systems.
The issues that have been raised up to this point suggest that
social support systems may be more well developed in the Black
church than in White congregations. However, it is important to
show why these support systems are more likely to help older
African Americans cope with the effects of stress. The ana-
lyses provided below focus on one specific type of stressful
experience--chronic financial strain. Initially, it might appear
that when financial problems arise, older Whites and older
Blacks would turn to an array of public assistance programs for
help. But African Americans have had a long history of
encountering difficulty with social welfare agencies (Trattner,
1999). When these experiences are contrasted with the warm and

welcoming social atmosphere of the church, it is not difficult to
see why the church may become the resource of choice for older
African Americans who are faced with economic difficulty.
Church-Based Social Support and Stress in Late Life
There are two reasons why church-based social support
systems are likely to become an especially important coping
resource for older people. First, extensive research by Carstensen
reveals that as people enter late life, they become increasingly
aware that they have relatively few years left to live. This growing
awareness of time is important because it leads older people to
seek out relationships that are emotionally close, and shed social
ties that are more peripheral in this respect (e.g., Fung &
Carstensen, 2004). Similar views are expressed by Tornstam
(1997). He argues that as people age, they become more selective
in the social relationships they maintain. More specifically, his
research indicates that as people grow older, they prefer deeper
relationships with a few people instead of more superficial
relationships with many individuals. Given these developmental
influences, it seems that the tightly knit social support systems
that arise in the church may be especially attractive to older adults.
Perhaps this is one reason why rates of church attendance are
higher among older than among younger people (Barna, 2002).
Second, a number of studies suggest that older people tend to
face different kinds of stressors than do younger adults. More
specifically, this research indicates that even though older
people encounter fewer stressful life events than do younger
people, they are more likely to be faced with stressors that are
continuous and ongoing (i.e., chronic strains) (Krause, 1999).
And when chronic strains arise, older people may have fewer
options than younger people have for dealing with them. This is
especially true with respect to chronic financial strain. A number
of individuals retire from the labor force by the time they reach
age 65 (Schulz, 2001). However, some re-enter the labor force
after retirement (Henretta, 2001). Although there are several
reasons for this, one may be to alleviate current financial
difficulties. But the opportunity to take this kind of direct action
may diminish with advancing age--by about the time people
reach age 75, physical as well as cognitive limitations may
discourage the use of this coping strategy. If direct action cannot
be taken to resolve financial problems, then they may continue
unabated. As a result, religion may become an especially viable
resource for coping with this type of difficulty (Gottlieb, 1997).
The theoretical rationale for this study leads to the following
study hypotheses:
1. Church-based social support reduces the deleterious effect
of chronic financial strain on self-rated health;
2. Church-based social support is a more effective stress-
buffering resource than is social support that arises in
secular settings; and
3. The stress-buffering function of church-based support is
more evident among older African Americans than among
older Whites.
METHODS
Sample
The data for this study come from a nationwide longitudinal
survey of older Whites and older African Americans. The study
population was defined as all household residents who were
either White or Black, noninstitutionalized, English speaking,
and at least 66 years of age. Geographically, the study
population was restricted to eligible persons residing within
the coterminous United States (i.e., residents of Alaska and
Hawaii were excluded). Finally, the study population was
restricted to people who were currently practicing Christians,
individuals who were Christian in the past but no longer
practice any religion, and people who were not affiliated with
any faith at any point in their lifetime. Individuals who practice
a religion other than Christianity (e.g., Jews or Muslims) were
excluded because it would be difficult to devise a set of religion
measures that would be suitable for persons of all faiths.
The sampling frame consisted of all eligible persons
contained in the Medicare beneficiary eligibility list maintained
by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services(CMS). This
list contains virtually every older adult in the United States.
However, some older people are not in the data base because
they do not have a Social Security number. This may be due to
factors such as undocumented immigration. A five-step process
was used to draw the sample from the CMS file. A detailed
discussion of these steps is provided by Krause (2002).
Interviewing for the baseline survey took place in 2001. The
data collection was performed by Harris Interactive (New York,
NY). A total of 1,500 interviews were completed. All interviews
were conducted face-to-face in the homes of the respondents.
The study participants were not screened for cognitive disability
prior to the interview. Elderly Blacks were oversampled so that
sufficient statistical power would be available to fully explore
race differences in religion. More specifically, the sample
consisted of 748 Whites and 752 older African Americans. The
overall response rate for the study was 62%.
The Wave 2 survey was conducted in 2004. A total of
1,024 study participants were reinterviewed successfully, 75
refused to participate, 112 could not be located, 70 were too ill to
participate, 11 had moved to a nursing home, and 208 were
deceased. Not counting those who had died or were placed in
a nursing home,the response rate for the Wave 2 survey was80%.
Data on social support received in secular settings were not
obtained until the Wave 2 survey. Therefore, the analyses
presented below are based on the Wave 2 data only. When the
Wave 2 interviews were conducted, 342 study participants
indicated that they attend church no more than twice a year.
However, it did not make sense to ask people about church-
based social support if they attend worship services no more
than twice a year. As a result, the questions on church-based
social support were administered to a total of 682 Wave 2 study
participants. After using listwise deletion of cases to deal with
item nonresponse, the main analyses presented below are based
on between 538 and 548 cases. Analysis of the group consisting
of 548 older study participants revealed that 44% were older
Whites and 56% were older Blacks. The average age of these
individuals was 76.8 years (SD ¼ 5.8 years), 39% were older
men, and 49% were married when the Wave 2 interviews took
place. Finally, the older adults in this group indicated they
had successfully completed an average of 11.9 years of school-
ing (SD ¼ 3.4 years). These descriptive data, as well as the
results presented below, are based on data that have been
weighted. More specifically, separate weights were devised for
each racial group so that they would correspond to the most

region of the country.
Measures
Table 1 contains the measures that were used in this survey.
The procedures used to code these items are provided in the
footnotes of this table.
Self-rated health. --Global self-rated health status was
assessed with three indicators. A high score on these items
denotes more favorable health ratings. The internal consistency
reliability estimate for the brief composite created from these
questions is .721.
Financial strain. --Ongoing economic problems were mea-
sured with three items. A high score represents greater financial
difficulty. The reliability estimate for this scale is .791.
Church-based emotional support. --As shown in Table 1,
three items that were devised by Krause (2002) were used to
assess emotional support provided by fellow church members.
These indicators were only presented to study participants who
attended church more than twice a year. The questions are
coded so that a high score means more emotional support was
received at church. The internal consistency reliability estimate
for this brief composite is .826.
Emotional support from outside the church. --Three groups
of older people are described in the analyses provided below:
(1) those who go to church more than twice a year; (2) those
who go to church no more than twice a year but have contact
with people in a local church; and (3) those who go to church
no more than twice a year and do not have contact with a local
church. A series of secular support measures had to be devised
for each group.
The majority of the study participants go to church more than
twice a year (N ¼ 548). Because the goal of this study was to
compare and contrast the effects of church-based and secular
support, it was important to devise measures that are not
confounded. This problem could have arisen, for example, if
older respondents worshipped with family members. An
example using the first listed church-based support item in
Table 1 shows how this problem was handled. The questions on
secular emotional support for people in this group were
introduced with the following statement: ``Now I have some
questions about people who do not attend your church.'' Then
the question stems for the first secular emotional support item
was worded to read: ``Not counting your (minister, pastor, or
priest) or fellow church members, how often do family and

friends let you know they love and care for you?'' The same
strategy was used to modify the other two support items,
resulting in a three-item secular support measure for members
of this group.
If people indicated that they attended church no more than
twice a year, a question was asked to see if they, nevertheless,
kept in touch with people from a local congregation. A small
number of Wave 2 participants indicated that they did so
(N ¼ 54). Church-based support items were not administered to
the older adults in this group, but secular support items were
devised for them. These secular support indicators were
introduced with the following statement: ``Now I'd like you
to think about family members and friends who are not in the
church you have contact with.'' Then, as the following example
reveals, the question stems for the emotional support items
were worded to read: ``Not counting your minister or fellow
church members, how often do your family and friends let you
know they love and care for you?'' This same strategy was used
to modify the other emotional support items shown in Table 1,
resulting in a three-item secular support measure for the
members of this group.
The third group of study participants consisted of older people
who do not go to church more than twice a year and who do not
have contact with anyone in a local church (N¼174). Therefore,
these study participants were not asked questions about church-
based support. Instead, they were only asked questions about
secular support. As the following example reveals, the secular
emotional support items were worded to read: ``How often do
your family members and friends let you know they love and
care for you?'' As with the other groups, a three-item secular
support measure was developed using this strategy.
A single set of secular support items was computed by
merging responses to the items across the three groups. A high
score stands for more secular emotional support. Prior to
merging the items, the reliability estimate in the first group is
.787, while the corresponding estimate in the second (.843) and
third groups (.802) are roughly the same.
Religious control measures. --As a number of investigators
have observed, religion is a complex, multidimensional
phenomenon (Ellison & Levin, 1998). Moreover, the correla-
tions among some of these dimensions are fairly large.
Therefore, steps must be taken to ensure that the potential
stress-buffering properties of church-based emotional support
are due specifically to this construct and not to some other
element of religion that is correlated with it. It is for this reason
that measures of two other facets of religion are included in the
analyses presented below. The first is used widely in the
literature and is sometimes referred to as ``organizational
religiousness'' (Krause & Tran, 1989). This construct assesses
the extent to which older study respondents participate in
formal worship services, Bible study groups, and prayer groups.
A high score on this measure represents greater involvement in
formal activities at church. The internal consistency reliability
estimate for this brief composite is .791.
Indicators that assess private religious practices are also
included in this study. These items ask about the frequency of
private prayer, how often older people read the Bible at home,
and how often older study participants watch religious services
on TV or listen to them on the radio. A high score on these
indicators represents more frequent private involvement. The
reliability estimate for the brief composite formed from these
indicators is .748.
Demographic control measures. --The relationships among
religion, financial strain, and self-rated health were assessed
after the effects of age, sex, marital status, education, and race
were controlled for statistically. Age is scored in a continuous
format. Similarly, education is coded in a continuous format
denoting the total number of years of completed schooling.
Finally, sex (1¼men; 0¼women), marital status (1¼presently
married; 0 ¼ not married), and race (1 ¼ White; 0 ¼ African
Americans) are represented with binary indicators.
RESULTS
The findings from this study are presented in four sections.
First, basic descriptive data are provided for the core study
measures. The next section contains findings from the analyses
that compare and contrast the relative stress-buffering effects
of church-based and secular support. Following this, results
involving race differences in the stress-buffering effects of
church-based support are provided. The last section contains
findings from a series of supplementary analyses that have not
been discussed up to this point. These additional analyses were
designed to clarify and extend the results that emerge from tests
of the main study hypotheses. All analyses were performed
with the SPSS statistical software program (version 12).
Descriptive Data for Older Whites and Older Blacks
Table 2 contains the means and standard deviations for the
core study measures that have been broken out by race.
Consistent with previous research, the data suggest that older
Whites rate their health more favorably than do older Blacks,
and older African Americans encounter more financial strain
than do their White counterparts. As research reviewed by
Taylor, Chatters, and Levin (2004) reveals, the means for the
three core religion measures indicate that older Blacks are more
involved in religious activities than are older Whites. In

Church-Based Support and Secular Support
Table 3 contains the findings from the analyses that were
designed to compare the relative stress-buffering effects of
church-based support and support provided by people outside
a respondent's congregation. These analyses are restricted
solely to older people who attended church more than twice
a year. The analyses were performed with a two-step
hierarchical multiple regression model. In the first step, self-
reported health was regressed on financial strain, church-based
support, secular support, the religious control variables, and the
demographic control measures. The second step involved tests
for the proposed interactions between church-based support,
secular support, and financial strain on self-rated health. This
step was executed by adding two multiplicative terms to the
model. These cross-product terms were formed by multiplying
church-based support by financial strain and secular support by
financial strain.
If the regression coefficient associated with one of the
multiplicative terms is statistically significant, then hand cal-
culations described by Aiken and West (1991) are performed to
help interpret the interaction effect. If the theoretical rationale
developed for this study is valid, then the relationship between
financial strain and self-rated health should become pro-
gressively weaker at higher levels of church-based support.
The hand calculations yield two estimates: (1) unstandardized
regression coefficients representing the relationships between
financial strain and self-rated health at select levels of church-
based support; and (2) t tests to see if these coefficients differ
significantly from zero. Following this, standardized regression
estimates for the relationship between financial strain and self-
rated health are computed in the usual manner.
The findings in the left-hand column of Table 2 (see Model
1) were derived from the first step in the hierarchical regression
analysis. The data suggest that more financial strain is
associated with less favorable health ratings (b ¼ À.216; p ,
.001). In contrast, neither church-based emotional support
(b ¼À.091; not significant [ns]) nor secular emotional support
(b ¼ .059; ns) is significantly related to self-rated health. This
would appear to suggest that social support has little effect on
the self-rated health of older people.
Fortunately, the data in the right-hand column of Table 3 (see
Model 2) provide a different view. More specifically, the
findings reveal that the interaction between church-based
emotional support and self-rated health is statistically signifi-
cant (b ¼ .038; p , .01; unstandardized coefficients are
presented for multiplicative terms because standardized esti-
mates are meaningless in this context). However, emotional
support from people outside the church does not appear to
offset the effects of financial strain on self-rated health (b ¼
À.004; ns). The nature of the statistically significant interaction
effect is illustrated by performing the hand calculations
recommended by Aiken and West (1991). This involves
estimating the relationship between financial strain and self-
rated health at select levels of church-based support. Although
any value on the church-based support scale could be used for
this purpose, the following scores were selected: À1 standard
deviation below the mean support score, the mean church-based
support value, and þ1 standard deviation above the average
support score.
The additional hand calculations (not shown in Table 3)
suggest that financial strain is associated with worse self-rated
health for older adults with low levels of church-based support
(À1 standard deviation below the mean; b ¼À.325; b ¼À.290;
p , .001). However, the relationship between financial strain
and self-rated health is not as strong for older people with
average levels of church-based emotional support (b ¼ À.216;
b¼À.193; p , .001). The potentially important stress-buffering
properties of church-based support are even more evident
among older people who receive relatively high levels of
assistance from their fellow church members (b ¼ À.108; b ¼
À.096; p , .01). Simply put, the data suggest that church-based
emotional support significantly offsets the effects of financial
strain on self-rated health in late life.
Exploring Variations by Race
The next set of analyses is designed to see if the relation-
ships among financial strain, church-based support, and health
differ for older Whites and older Blacks. Once again, these
analyses involve only older people who attended church more
than twice a year. This set of analyses is complex because
it calls for a three-way statistical interaction effect between
race, financial strain, and church-based support on self-rated
health. The results from these analyses are presented in Table
4. Four multiplicative terms were added to the model to
properly test for the proposed three-way interaction effect:

strain, Race 3 Church-based support, and Race 3 Financial
strain 3 Church-based support.
Tests for the three-way interaction reveal that the impact of
financial strain and church-based support on self-rated health
may vary significantly by race (b ¼À.064; p , .05). However,
it is difficult to determine the precise nature of these effects.
There are two ways to proceed. The first involves computing
a series of estimates by hand using other formulas provided by
Aiken and West (1991). The second has to do with performing
a subgroup analysis in which the interaction between church-
based support and financial strain on health is estimated in
samples composed solely of older Whites and older Blacks,
respectively. The subgroup approach is taken here (see
Aneshensel, 2002, for a detailed discussion of this issue).
This approach is justified by the fact that the coefficient
associated with the three-way interaction term is statistically
significant. The same control measures are used throughout the
subgroup analysis.
The subgroup analysis (not shown here) reveals that church-
based emotional support tends to offset the effects of financial
strain on self-rated health for older Blacks (b¼ .057; p , .005),
but not for older Whites (b ¼ À.006; ns). Consistent with the
strategy implemented above, additional hand calculations were
performed to illustrate the nature of the interaction effect in the
subgroup comprising older African Americans. These compu-
tations indicate that financial strain is associated with worse
self-rated health for older blacks who receive little emotional
support from the people with whom they worship (i.e., those
at À1 standard deviation below the mean support value; b ¼
À.337; b ¼À.298; p , .001). The effect of financial strain on
self-rated health is reduced for older African Americans with
average levels of assistance from their fellow church members
(b ¼ À.174; b ¼ À.155; p , .01). In contrast, the relationship
between financial strain and self-rated health is no longer
statistically significant for older Blacks who receive relatively
more emotional support from the people in their congregation
(b ¼À.013; b ¼À.012; ns).
Supplementary Analyses
The findings that have emerged up to this point suggest that
church-based social support may buffer or offset the effects of
financial strain on health, but support that arises in secular
networks may be less useful in this respect. However, it is
important to carefully reflect on what the study findings actually
reveal. The data that have been presented so far are based solely
on those older people who attend church more than twice a
year. As a result, the findings say nothing about whether
support arising in secular settings is helpful for people who are
not regular churchgoers. It may be, for example, that secular
support works best for individuals who do not go to church
often, whereas church-based support is more efficacious for
those who are more involved in the church. To better under-
stand the relative efficacy of church-based and secular
support, it is important to bring infrequent churchgoers into
the analyses.
Another regression analysis was performed to see if support
from secular sources buffers the effects of financial strain on
health for older people who attend church no more than twice
a year (N¼228). Private religious practices and the demographic
variables are included as control measures in this analysis. The
data (not shown here) suggest that the interaction between
financial strain and secular support on self-rated health is
not statistically significant for older people in this group (b ¼
À.023; ns).
Although this additional set of analyses is helpful, it does not
go far enough because it is hard to see why secular support
appears to be of little use to those persons who do not go to
church often. Several studies in secular settings suggest that
older people who are faced with ongoing economic problems
tend to receive less emotional support from family members
and friends (e.g., Krause & Jay, 1991). This finding suggests
that financial strain may erode the quality of informal social
support in late life. Hobfoll's (1998) notion of the ``pressure
cooker effect'' helps show why this may be so. When an older
adult experiences economic problems, there is a good chance
that members of his or her support network are also grappling
with the same problem. When this happens, Hobfoll argues
that, ``Since no one in the system is free of threat, individuals
who themselves have great need to depend on others must serve
as supporters and lose precious resources that they themselves
require'' (p. 208). Because of this, the amount and quality of
support they provide will be diminished.
This issue was addressed in the present study with three
additional analyses. First, support from secular network
members was regressed on financial strain, private religious-
ness, and the demographic control variables for those older
people who do not go to church often (i.e., no more than twice
a year; N ¼ 238). The data suggest that more financial strain is
associated with less secular support for the older adults in this

group (b ¼ À.186; p , .010). The analysis was repeated for
older people who go to church on a more regular basis (i.e.,
three or more times a year; N ¼ 567). The data suggest that
financial strain is not related significantly to the amount of
support that these individuals receive from secular sources (b ¼
À.058; ns). Further calculations revealed that the difference
between these two estimates is significant at the .05 level. In the
third analysis, church-based support was regressed on financial
strain, private religiousness, and the demographic control
variables for those who go to church more often. The findings
suggest that financial strain is not significantly related to
church-based emotional support (b ¼ À.020; ns). Taken as
a whole, these preliminary analyses suggest that church-based
support provided to more frequent churchgoers is more
efficacious than is secular support provided to less frequent
churchgoers because it appears to be relatively impervious to
the otherwise corrosive influence of ongoing economic
problems.
DISCUSSION
Three major findings emerge from this study. First, the data
indicate that the relationship between financial strain and self-
rated health is offset for older people who receive relatively
more emotional support from the people at church. Second,
support provided by relationships formed in the secular world
does not appear to have the same effect. Third, the results
suggest that church-based emotional support tends to offset the
effects of financial strain on self-rated health for older African
Americans, but not older Whites. This appears to be the first
time that any of these relationships have been examined
empirically. The findings involving the contrast between
church-based and secular support are especially provocative.
Although the results from this study may contribute to the
literature on church-based social relationships, there is still a lot
we do not know. For example, the data suggest that church-
based support may be an effective coping resource for older
people who are faced with economic problems, but we need to
see if this is true with respect to other stressors, such as the
death of a loved one. In addition, research is needed to find out
why church-based emotional support appears to be more
efficacious for older Blacks than for older Whites. One
possibility is that, instead of turning to fellow church members
for assistance, older Whites tend to rely on either psychological
coping resources (e.g., feelings of personal control), individual
religious coping responses (see Pargament, 1997), or formal
sources of assistance (e.g., social welfare agencies).
In the process of conducting further work in this field,
researchers would be well advised to take the limitations in this
study into account. Three are examined briefly. First, and
perhaps most important, the data in the analyses presented
above were gathered at a single point in time. As a result, the
temporal ordering among the study constructs was based on
theoretical considerations alone. However, one might easily
reverse the proposed causal ordering and instead specify that
older adults with initially poor self-rated health tend to
subsequently experience more economic problems. Clearly
this, as well as other issues involving causality, must be
rigorously evaluated with data that have been gathered at more
than one point in time.
Second, church-based social relationships represent a com-
plex conceptual domain in its own right. Yet, only one type of
church support was examined in this study--emotional support
from church members. It is important to see if other kinds of
church-based support also help older adults cope more
effectively with the problems they face. So, for example, it is
important to know if emotional support from a clergy member
has the same stress-buffering function.
Finally, the analyses in this study were based on responses of
older adults from a wide spectrum of Christian denominations.
This assumes that church-based support systems are just as
effective in some denominations (e.g., Baptists) as in others
(e.g., Catholics). This may not be a valid assumption.
Josiah Royce was a well-known philosopher of his time and
a close friend of William James. Royce wrote a book in 1912
that was designed to overcome what he felt were serious
oversights in the work of James (1902/1997). Chief among these
oversights was the emphasis James placed on the role of the
unconscious processes in the generation of religious feelings and
religious insights. Royce (1912/2001) maintained that, instead
of arising from within the individual, the impetus for religious
experiences and sentiments was decidedly social in nature.
More specifically, he argued that, ``. . . our social experience is
our primary source of religious insight. And the salvation that
this insight brings to our knowledge is salvation through the
fostering of human brotherhood. Such salvation accrues to the
individual in so far as he gives himself over to the service of
man'' (Royce, 1912/2001, p. 58). The findings presented above
provide one way of showing that Royce may have been right.
