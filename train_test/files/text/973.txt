Ethnic Differences in the BMI-Hypertension Relation Bell et al.
Ethnic Differences in the Association between Body Mass Index and
Hypertension
A. Colin Bell, Linda S. Adair, and Barry M. Popkin
Interest in ethnicity-specific definitions of obesity has been hindered by a lack of data clarifying whether or not
obesity-related comorbid conditions occur at different levels of body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg)/height (m)2)
in different ethnic groups. The objective of this study was to examine ethnic differences in the strength of the
association between BMI and hypertension. Cross-sectional data obtained from adults aged 30­65 years in
China (1997, n = 3,423), the Philippines (1998, n = 1,929), and the United States (1988­1994, n = 7,957) were
used. Higher BMI was associated with a higher prevalence of hypertension in all ethnic groups. However, at BMI
levels less than 25, prevalence difference figures suggested a stronger association between BMI and
hypertension in Chinese men and women but not in Filipino women, compared with non-Hispanic Whites. Non-
Hispanic Blacks and Filipino women had a higher prevalence of hypertension at every level of BMI compared
with non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans. These ethnic differences in the strength of association
between BMI and hypertension and in underlying prevalence warrant further investigation into the use of
ethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs in clinical settings to more accurately identify individuals at risk from obesity. Am J

Body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg)/height (m)2) is posi-
tively and independently associated with morbidity and mor-
tality from hypertension, cardiovascular disease, type II dia-
betes mellitus, and other chronic diseases (1). In Caucasian
populations, the association between BMI and mortality is "J-
shaped," and the nadir of the curve occurs between the BMI
levels of 18.5 and 25 (2, 3). On the basis of this association,
the World Health Organization has devised a classification
wherein persons with BMIs below 18.5­24.9 are considered
underweight, those with BMIs above this range are considered
overweight or "at risk," and those with BMIs greater than or
equal to 30 are considered obese (4, 5).
In the effort to quantify the global obesity epidemic, it has
become common practice for epidemiologists to apply these
cutoffs to disparate populations and ethnic groups. A prob-
lem arising from the interpretation of these comparisons is
an assumption that different ethnic groups have similar risks
of morbidity and mortality at similar levels of BMI. There is
no evidence to suggest that this assumption is valid (6).
Indeed, limited evidence that Asians have a higher preva-
lence of disease at lower BMI levels than Caucasians has
prompted an international task force (the World Health
Organization/International Obesity Task Force) to recom-
mend that overweight status for Asian adults be based on a
BMI of 23.0­24.9 (7). Support for these Asian cutoffs
comes primarily from a cross-sectional study of a workforce
population of Hong Kong Chinese in which morbidity risk
for type II diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and albu-
minuria increased at a BMI of approximately 23 (8). A
higher risk of type II diabetes was also observed among
Indian Asians from Mauritius at this BMI level (7). Other
studies have found that Asians have smaller frames than
Caucasians and therefore have higher levels of body fat at
similar BMIs (9, 10). However, each of these studies repre-
sents a distinct Asian ethnic group, and rather than support
the notion of a set of cutoffs that is generalizable to all
"Asian" populations, as has been recommended, they point
to cutoffs for defining obesity and overweight that are spe-
cific to individual ethnic groups.
Ethnic differences in disease morbidity and mortality have
also been recognized in US racial/ethnic groups (11), as have
differences in body composition (12). However, to our knowl-
edge, ethnicity-specific BMI cutoffs for defining overweight
and obesity have not been contemplated in the United States.
There is a renewed focus in the United States on understand-
ing these racial/ethnic disparities in health (13, 14), and
redefining weight status according to ethnicity could dramat-
ically influence how these disparities are viewed.
In this study, we used data obtained from two racial/
ethnic groups in Asia and three racial/ethnic groups in the
United States to examine ethnic differences in the associa-
tion between BMI and hypertension.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Subjects included in our investigation were nonpregnant
participants aged 30­65 years from three different health
surveys: the China Health and Nutrition Survey, the Cebu
Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey from the
Philippines, and the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey from the United States.
The China Health and Nutrition Survey is an ongoing lon-
gitudinal survey conducted jointly by the Chinese Academy
of Preventive Medicine and the University of North
Carolina at Chapel Hill. The survey used multistage random
cluster sampling to select participants from 3,800 house-
holds in eight provinces of China that vary considerably in
terms of geography, stage of economic development, and
health status. Further details on the design of the China
Health and Nutrition Survey have been published elsewhere
(15). In this analysis, we used 1997 cross-sectional data
from 3,423 nonpregnant participants with blood pressure
measurements.
The Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey is an
ongoing study of a cohort of Filipino women who gave birth
between May 1, 1983, and April 30, 1984 (16). Cross-
sectional data from a 1998 follow-up survey of 1,929
women were included in this analysis.
For comparison with the Asian populations, similar data
from 7,957 participants in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey were included. This survey,
conducted by the US National Center for Health Statistics in
two phases between 1988 and 1994, used a multistage sam-
pling design to obtain national estimates of the health and
nutritional status of the noninstitutionalized US population.
Non-Hispanic Blacks and Mexican Americans were over-
sampled. Details on this survey have been published else-
where (17) and can also be found at the National Center for
Health Statistics website (http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.
htm).
Standard procedures for the measurement of blood pres-
sure were used in all surveys (18). Three blood pressure
measurements were taken by trained personnel on the right
arm of each participant, who had been seated prior to mea-
surement. Standard mercury sphygmomanometers were
used with appropriate cuff sizes. Systolic blood pressure
was measured at the first appearance of a pulse sound
(Korotkoff phase 1) and diastolic blood pressure at the dis-
appearance of the pulse sound (Korotkoff phase 5). We used
the average of the three measurements from each of the sur-
veys. Hypertension was defined as a systolic blood pressure
greater than or equal to 140 mmHg and/or a diastolic blood
pressure greater than or equal to 90 mmHg and/or the use of
antihypertension medication.
An important issue related to this definition of hyperten-
sion is the potential for weight loss among persons who had
been prediagnosed (i.e., those on antihypertension medica-
tion). Weight reduction is the primary lifestyle modification
recommended for persons with hypertension. Moreover, this
effect would be different between ethnic groups because of
differences in the proportion of prediagnosed individuals
(see tables 1 and 2). However, after conducting an analysis
stratified by diagnosis, we chose to include persons with
prediagnosed hypertension along with persons who were
discovered to be hypertensive in the surveys, not only to
maximize cell size but also because including them biased
the data towards the null value or had no effect. For men,
Chinese women, and non-Hispanic Black women, persons
with prediagnosed hypertension had higher BMIs, thereby
increasing the strength of the association between hyperten-
sion and BMI in each of the ethnic groups. However,
the impact of including persons with prediagnosed
hypertension in China was minimal, because the
proportion of prediagnosed individuals was very low (6.4
percent for men and 16.2 percent for women; p < 0.001
compared with non-Hispanic Whites). Thus, differences
observed between non-Hispanic Whites and Chinese are
likely to be conservative estimates of the true association
between newly diagnosed hypertension and BMI. For non-
Hispanic White and Filipino women, there were no signifi-
cant differences in mean BMI between hypertensive persons
who had been prediagnosed and those who were discovered
to be hypertensive during the surveys. Including prediag-
nosed individuals simply shifted the prevalence of hyper-
tension upward, and strength-of-association comparisons
between the ethnic groups were unaffected.
In each survey, height was measured in centimeters while
the participant stood without shoes, and weight was mea-
sured in kilograms while the participant stood without shoes
and in light clothing. BMI was calculated as weight in kilo-
grams over height in meters squared. Waist circumference
was measured in centimeters at the midpoint between the
bottom of the ribs and the top of the iliac crest. Hip circum-
ference was measured at the largest posterior extension of
the buttocks.
Data from the three surveys were pooled. All analyses
were stratified by gender and ethnic group. Ethnicity was
self-defined in the Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey and geographically defined in the
China Health and Nutrition Survey and the Cebu
Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. The data were
not weighted because the two Asian surveys were not
designed to be nationally representative.
Two statistical methods were used to compare the associ-
ation between BMI and hypertension across ethnic groups.
First, we used logistic regression to calculate the odds of
prevalent hypertension across a range of BMI categories
within each ethnic group. The category 18.5­22.9 was used
as the referent category. We then constructed a pooled model
that included ethnicity and interaction terms between ethnic-
ity and BMI categories to examine ethnic differences. There
are a number of factors that may confound the relation
between BMI and hypertension. In preliminary analysis, we
tested for confounding of this association by physical activ-
ity, smoking status, and alcohol consumption within each
ethnic group. For all of the gender/ethnicity subgroup mod-
els, the only group for which the BMI cutoff coefficients
changed in any meaningful manner was non-Hispanic Black
women. Even for this group, however, the  coefficients did
not change more than 10 percent, and the significance of the
BMI-hypertension association was not changed. Thus, only
348 Bell et al.

age, as a continuous variable in the range 30­65 years, was
controlled for in the models. Second, we examined the age-
adjusted prevalence of hypertension across the BMI cate-
gories and calculated prevalence differences. Statistical
significance was accepted at p < 0.05, and all analyses were
carried out using Stata software, version 7.0 (Stata
Corporation, College Station, Texas).
RESULTS
Compared with the US ethnic groups, Chinese men and
women had a lower prevalence of hypertension and over-
weight. Filipino women were less overweight but more
hypertensive than non-Hispanic Whites and Mexican
Americans. After adjustment for age differences between
the ethnic groups, Chinese men had a significantly lower
(p < 0.001) mean systolic blood pressure than each of the
US ethnic groups and a significantly lower mean diastolic
blood pressure than non-Hispanic Blacks (table 1). Chinese
men were also significantly less hypertensive ( p < 0.001),
and those who were hypertensive were less likely to be on
antihypertension medication. They had a significantly lower
mean BMI (p < 0.001), a lower (p < 0.001) prevalence of
overweight and obesity (BMI  25), and less central adipos-
ity (p < 0.001 for waist circumference and waist:hip ratio).
A similar pattern was observed for Chinese women,
although they had a higher mean diastolic blood pressure
( p < 0.001) than non-Hispanic White and Mexican-
American women (table 2). There was no difference in
mean blood pressure between Chinese and Filipino women
(p  0.941), but Filipino women had a significantly higher
diastolic blood pressure ( p < 0.001) that was similar to that
for non-Hispanic Blacks. Filipino women were more hyper-
tensive than Chinese, non-Hispanic White, and Mexican-
American women, and, in comparison with Chinese women,
a much higher proportion of Filipino hypertensive women
were on antihypertension medication ( p < 0.001). They
were intermediate between Chinese and US women with
respect to overweight prevalence but no different from
Chinese women in terms of central adiposity ( p  0.976).
There were also differences in hypertension and body
mass between the US ethnic groups. In brief, non-Hispanic
Blacks were more likely to be hypertensive and to receive
medication for their hypertension compared with non-
Hispanic Whites and Mexican Americans. Non-Hispanic
Black men were less obese (BMI  30) than Mexican-
American men, but non-Hispanic Black women had the
highest obesity prevalence of all the ethnic groups.
The odds of prevalent hypertension increased more
steeply with higher BMIs for Chinese men in comparison
with non-Hispanic Whites. Chinese men in the BMI range
23.0­24.9 had hypertension odds of 2.09 (95 percent confi-
dence interval (CI): 1.50, 2.94) as compared with Chinese
men in the BMI range 18.5­22.9 (figure 1). The equivalent
odds ratios for Mexican-American, non-Hispanic White,
and non-Hispanic Black men were 1.23 (95 percent CI:
0.57, 2.64), 0.89 (95 percent CI: 0.54, 1.44), and 1.39 (95
percent CI: 0.86, 2.22), respectively. Adjusting for waist:hip
ratio attenuated the ethnic differences but did not eliminate
them. Among women, the odds of hypertension for Chinese
and Filipino women did not differ significantly from the
odds for non-Hispanic White women at low levels of BMI
(figure 2). However, the odds of hypertension increased
quite steeply for Chinese women with BMIs above 27, to a
level that was not matched by non-Hispanic Whites until
attainment of BMI levels around 30. Non-Hispanic Black

When we examined the age-adjusted prevalence of hyper-
tension across categories of BMI, the pattern was one of
more prevalent hypertension with higher BMIs for all ethnic
groups. However, the slope appeared to be steeper for
Chinese men at lower levels of BMI (figure 3). To confirm
this, we examined prevalence differences between BMI cat-
egories for each ethnic group (table 3). There was a 10.8
percent increase in prevalent hypertension for Chinese men
between the BMI categories of 18.5­22.9 and 23.0­24.9, as
compared with a 1.8 percent decrease for non-Hispanic

prevalence differences for the US ethnic groups occurred at
higher levels of BMI. Mexican-American men had a jump in
hypertension prevalence in the BMI category 25.0­26.9 that
may have been due to the small sample sizes in the preced-
ing two categories. According to the prevalence patterns, the
association between hypertension prevalence and BMI may
also be steeper in Chinese women than in US women (fig-
ure 4), a result that was not obvious in the logistic regression
analysis. Hypertension was 7.6 percent higher for Chinese
women in the BMI category 23.0­24.9 than in the category
18.5­22.9 (table 3). The increase in hypertension over the
same BMI range for non-Hispanic Whites was 4.3 percent.
When age was taken into account, Filipino women had a
higher prevalence of hypertension than the other ethnic
groups across the middle of the BMI range. A fairly sharp
rise (10.8 percent) in hypertension was observed for this eth-
nic group between the BMI categories 23.0­24.9 and
25.0­26.9. Compared with non-Hispanic Whites, non-
Hispanic Black women had a higher prevalence of hyper-
tension at every level of BMI. Moreover, prevalence

increased in a linear fashion across the overweight range

DISCUSSION
Hypertension is an antecedent of heart disease and stroke,
both leading causes of morbidity and mortality in the United
States and developing nations (19­21). In this study, we
found a stronger association between prevalent hypertension
and BMI for Chinese men and women and a higher baseline
prevalence for Filipino women in comparison with US eth-
nic groups.
Positive associations between body mass and blood pres-
sure have been well documented in both cross-sectional and
prospective studies of Caucasian populations (22­24). Cross-

sectional studies have documented an association in East
Asian populations that is similar but may be stronger (8, 25,
26). Our data add to evidence suggesting that the curve is
steeper in Chinese populations. Ko et al. (8) found that the
optimal BMI cutoff for predicting hypertension in Hong Kong
Chinese was 23.8, which is considerably lower than the cutoff
of 25 recommended for Caucasian populations. Optimal cut-
offs for type II diabetes, dyslipidemia, and albuminuria were
also lower than 25. A study from Japan noted that the risk of
hypertension for persons with BMIs greater than or equal to
25 was twice that of persons with BMIs of 22 (7); this is a
higher risk than has been observed for Caucasians. However,
we could not provide evidence to suggest that the association
between hypertension and BMI is stronger in Filipinos.
To explain why these ethnic differences in the strength of
the BMI-hypertension association exist, we need to consider
genetically determined differences in body composition and
metabolic response, as well as clustering of risk factors due
to differences in social and environmental factors (Bell et
al., unpublished manuscript). East Asian populations are
known to have greater levels of total body fat and abdomi-
nal body fat at lower levels of BMI than Caucasians.
Deurenberg et al. (10) have observed ethnic differences in
BMI at similar levels of percentage of body fat. They found
Chinese, Indonesian, and Thai populations to have BMI val-
ues that were 1.9, 3.2, and 2.9 BMI units lower than those of
Caucasians (American, Australian, and European Whites
analyzed as one group) with a similar percentage of body
fat. The distribution of body fat may also differ between eth-
nic groups. For example, Asian Indians have been found to
have more abdominal fat than Caucasians (27). In this study,
adjustment for waist:hip ratio only slightly attenuated the
differences between racial/ethnic groups, and waist:BMI
ratio (centimeters of waist circumference per unit of BMI)
was very similar for Chinese men (3.5 cm per BMI unit) and
women (3.4 cm per BMI unit) as compared with non-
Hispanic White men (3.6 cm/unit) and women (3.2 cm/unit),
respectively. One mechanism through which body fat is
thought to influence hypertension is increased insulin resis-
tance. Body fat, particularly abdominal fat, may lead to an
increase in fatty acids in the portal blood vessels, enhancing
insulin resistance and leading to the development of hyper-
tension and other metabolic complications (28, 29). It is also
possible that Asian populations are more insulin-resistant
than Caucasian populations for reasons other than increased
central adiposity (30). Zimmet et al. (31, 32) summarized
results of a series of studies which showed that relative risk
of insulin resistance and adult-onset diabetes is high in
Asians and Hispanics compared with Caucasians.
Socioeconomic and cultural factors may also contribute
to these ethnic differences. The prevalence patterns reveal
considerable underlying variation in hypertension preva-
lence. Stress and/or other unmeasured risk factors, such as
acculturation in the case of Mexican Americans, may play
an important role in determining this underlying variation.
In other work, we found that unmeasured or poorly mea-
sured risk factors associated with socioeconomic status were
more strongly associated with hypertension in US women
than obesity, physical activity, and alcohol consumption
(Bell et al., unpublished manuscript). A direct comparison of
socioeconomic status was not possible in this study of pop-
ulations from countries at different stages of development.
Our analysis of the relation between BMI and hyperten-
sion was complicated by differences in the baseline preva-
lence of hypertension between ethnic groups. The odds ratio
analysis obscured these differences by assuming that the
odds of hypertension were identical for each of the ethnic
groups in the referent BMI category. This is potentially mis-
leading, because it enhanced the odds of hypertension with
increasing BMI among Chinese men and women and dimin-
ished the odds of hypertension with increasing BMI among
Filipino women and non-Hispanic Blacks. The prevalence
difference analysis allowed for differences in baseline
prevalence but in this case did not lead to different conclu-
sions regarding Chinese men and women. Prevalence differ-
ences tell a different story for non-Hispanic Blacks,
however. They may in fact be at greater risk of hypertension
with increasing BMI than non-Hispanic Whites, rather than
at lower risk as the odds ratios suggested. Filipino women
may also be at greater risk, but there was no evidence of a
greater prevalence difference between the BMI categories
18.5­22.9 and 23.0­24.9, which was the contrast of primary
interest.
This study was limited by the use of cross-sectional data.
To truly test for differences in risk of hypertension with
increasing BMI, one would need to monitor people from
these populations over time. In preliminary analyses, we
tested physical activity, alcohol consumption, and smoking
as potential confounders of the BMI-hypertension associa-
tion. These factors did not appear to be confounders, but the
variables were not identical between the ethnic groups (i.e.,
we used work-related physical activity in China and leisure-
time physical activity in the United States).
Finally, blood pressure is somewhat sensitive to salt
intake, and we did not have adequate measures of salt con-
sumption in any of the populations. Compared with the US
population, the Chinese and Filipino populations probably
have lower salt intakes, and inconsistent associations
between BMI and blood pressure have been found in popu-
lations with low salt intakes (33). However, this study and
other recent studies have shown strong associations (34).
Should there be lower cutoffs to define overweight and
obesity status for Asian populations? Our data suggest that
the new Asian BMI cutoff values are appropriate for Chinese
men and women, on the basis of a stronger association
between BMI and hypertension in comparison with Whites,
and possibly for Filipino women, on the basis of a high base-
line prevalence. Moreover, these data provide some evidence
that the association between BMI and hypertension and
underlying prevalence varies within US ethnic groups. The
utility of having a single international weight classification
based on BMI is the ability to compare populations and mon-
itor changes over time using a simple measure. At this level,
we do not see the advantage of having a separate classifica-
tion for Asians, particularly if it does not apply to all Asians.
In addition, "Asian" ethnicity is very difficult to define. In a
clinical setting, however, the value of ethnicity-specific BMI
cutoffs can readily be seen. They would enable clinicians to
Ethnic Differences in the BMI-Hypertension Relation 353

more appropriately identify individuals at increased risk of
hypertension and other comorbid conditions. Further
research is needed to test the utility of ethnicity-specific BMI
cutoffs for defining obesity in clinical settings.
