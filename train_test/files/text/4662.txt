Introduction
Setting mucosal healing (MH) as a therapeutic
goal has gained increasing attention, stemming
from observations that treatment aimed solely at
resolution of clinical symptoms does not elimi-
nate long-term bowel damage in patients with
Crohn's disease (CD). Evolving evidence indi-
cates that an intensive care strategy aiming at
abrogating intestinal inflammation and endo-
scopic MH might improve long-term outcome of
CD with diminished rates of relapse, hospitaliza-
tions, and the need for surgery.1­3 A post hoc anal-
ysis of the ACCENT-1 trial demonstrated that
using MH as an end point for decision-making
strategy was cost-effective.4
Therefore, MH as the treatment goal and out-
come measure is being increasingly considered
in patients with CD. However, little is known
about the factors associated with the

Abstract
Background: Mucosal healing (MH), the proposed treat to target in Crohn's disease (CD), is
associated with improved disease outcomes. There are still scant data on factors associated
with achieving MH in clinical practice. We evaluated the probability of achieving MH and
identified factors predictive of subsequent MH in patients with CD.
Methods: This was a retrospective, observational cohort study. A total of 272 patients with CD
with serial endoscopy assessment and subsequent therapeutic management were reviewed.
The primary outcome was MH. The cumulative incidence of MH and endoscopic improvement
was estimated using the Kaplan­Meier method. Factors independently associated with MH
were identified using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: Of the 272 patients, 126 (46.32%) achieved MH after a median follow-up period of 33
months (interquartile range: 27­38 months). Factors independently associated with MH by
multivariate analysis were time between endoscopic procedures within 26 weeks (hazard ratio
[HR]: 1.56; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.05­3.39), adjustment of medical therapy when MH
was not achieved (HR: 2.07; 95% CI: 1.26­2.33), prior enteric fistula (HR: 0.22; 95% CI: 0.06­
0.91), perianal disease at CD diagnosis (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35­0.95), and C-reactive protein
normalization within 12 weeks (HR: 3.23; 95% CI: 1.82­5.88). Similar factors have also been
identified for endoscopic improvement.
Conclusions: Performing serial endoscopic procedures at a 26-week interval and subsequent
adjustment in medical treatment are helpful in achieving MH. Endoscopic monitoring plays an
important role in the treating to target of CD.

achievement of MH. Early introduction of tumor
necrosis factor (TNF) antagonists in the course
of the disease, particularly in combination with
immunosuppressives, is one strategy for improv-
ing MH.5,6 Similarly, a subgroup analysis of the
recent EXTEND trial showed a higher rate of
MH among patients who received adalimumab
and had a CD duration shorter than 2 years.7
This is further confirmed by a recent study which
demonstrated that longer duration of CD, previ-
ous surgery, and previous exposure to immuno-
suppressives were associated with poor rates of
MH. However, none of these factors were inde-
pendently predictive of MH in multivariate
models.8
Identifying predictors of MH is of great clinical
significance in guiding treatment strategy to treat
to target of CD.9 The aim of our study was to
evaluate the probability of achieving MH and
identify factors independently predictive of subse-
quent MH in patients with CD.
Methods
Patients and design
This was a retrospective, observational cohort
study of all consecutive patients with CD who
underwent colonoscopy at the Inflammatory
Bowel Disease Center, The First Affiliated
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University between
2008 and 2013. Diagnoses of CD were deter-
mined according to the criteria of Lennard-
Jones,10 based on clinical, endoscopic,
histopathological, and radiological findings.
Disease phenotype was established according to
the Montreal Classification.11
The inclusion criteria for patients enrolled
were: (a) age between 18 years and 80 years;
(b) ulcers detected by (ileo) colonoscopy at the
initial endoscopy procedure; (c) at least one
repeated colonoscopy after the initial colonos-
copy. The exclusion criteria were: (a) patients
with incomplete endoscopic procedures; (b)
age under 18 years; (c) patients with isolated
proximal small bowel involvement at the time
of diagnosis.11
The study protocol was approved by the Clinical
Research Ethics Committee of The First Affiliated
Hospital of Sun Yat-sen University and all
patients signed an informed consent.
Endoscopic documentation
All endoscopic procedures were performed by
skilled endoscopists with the standard protocol.
The static endoscopic picture was recorded in the
patients' pro forma questionnaire sheet and also
saved as a digital version in the endoscopy registry.
The score was assessed retrospectively by a central
endoscopic reading according to the saved endos-
copy images. Of note, the second and subsequent
endoscopic assessments were usually planned
within 6 months by the treating physician to assess
the response to therapy (i.e. the scheduled endo-
scopic follow-up evaluation to assess MH).
Clinical follow up
The clinical follow up and additional pertinent
data in the medical files of the patients, the
Inflammatory Bowel Disease Center register, and
the endoscopy register were reassessed by two
experienced gastroenterologists. A pre-determined
structured data-sheet was used to collect data from
the medical files at the time of each endoscopic
procedure, including the indication for procedure,
type and findings of the procedure, medical thera-
pies being used at the beginning of the study
period, any treatment adjustment after endoscopic
procedures, general wellbeing, and symptoms at
the time of each endoscopic procedure and within
3­6 months after procedure.
Definitions and outcomes
The primary outcome of the study was MH, and
the secondary outcome was endoscopic improve-
ment. The endoscopic score system was adopted
from that of af Björkesten and colleagues.12
Briefly, the endoscopy reports were scored
according to mucosal activity in the most affected
area as: 0 (remission); 1­2 (mild inflammatory
activity: light mucosal erythema or granularity or
aphthous inflammation, without ulcerations);
3­4 (moderate activity: superficial ulcerations);
5­6 (severe activity: deep ulcerations, with a
diameter of under or over 2 cm). The criterion for
endoscopic improvement was a decrease in the
endoscopic score of at least two. MH was deter-
mined as a mucosal activity score of 0­2. The
duration of follow up was calculated from the
time of the index endoscopy up to the time of
MH or endoscopic improvement, loss of follow
up, or end of study (30 December 2013). The
definition of medical treatment adjustment after
endoscopic procedure was adopted from Bouguen
R Mao, Y Qiu et al.

and colleagues8 as follows: the introduction or
switch of immunosuppressives; the introduction,
optimization, or switch within the class or out of
the class of biologics; or change in both immuno-
suppressive agents and biologics.
Statistical analysis
Demographic and clinical parameters were com-
piled and summary statistics were calculated.
Data were described using medians with inter-
quartile range (IQR) for continuous data and per-
centages for discrete data. Fisher's exact test or
chi-square tests were used to compare the non-
parametric categorical data between groups. The
cumulative probabilities of MH and endoscopic
improvement were estimated using the Kaplan­
Meier method. For computing the cumulative
probability of achieving MH, the Kaplan­Meyer
analysis commences at the first endoscopy and is
terminated at the time point of the first procedure
during which MH/improvement was observed
or at the last known follow-up endoscopy.8
Univariate analyses using the log-rank test were
performed to identify factors predictive of each
event. Factors analyzed by univariate analysis
with p < 0.1 were integrated in multivariate Cox
regression. The SPSS 15.0 software (SPSS,
Chicago, IL, USA) was used to perform all appro-
priate statistical analyses. Statistical significance
was set at p < 0.05.
Results
Demographic characteristics
A total of 272 (75.3%) patients (169 males, 103
females; median age 33 years; IQR: 24­41
years) who had ulcers detected by initial endo-
scopic procedure underwent at least two endo-
scopic procedures during the study period at
our center. Of these 272 patients, 154 patients
were in clinical remission at the first following
endoscopic procedure, which comprised the
study population for the final analysis. Baseline
demographic characteristics are shown in Table
1. During follow up, 154 (56.6%) patients were

treated with immunosuppressives. TNF-
antagonists were introduced only in 49 (18%)
patients, and in 28 (10.3%) of these patients
were combined with thiopurines.
Endoscopic assessment.Initial endoscopy of the
272 patients showed deep ulcers in 91 patients
(33%) and superficial ulcers in 181 patients
(67%). An additional 535 endoscopic procedures
were performed subsequently following the index
procedure in the study patients (median follow-
up period of 33 months, IQR: 27­38 months). In
our study, the endoscopic procedures were usu-
ally planned a priori at the time of the previous
endoscopic procedure for the purpose of assess-
ing MH rather than in response to clinical symp-
toms, only 27 of 535 (5.04%) endoscopic
procedures were performed because of a disease
flare. The overall median interval between two
consecutive endoscopic procedures was 24 weeks
(IQR: 17­38 weeks). MH was achieved in 126
patients (46.3%) during follow up (Figure 1).The
cumulative probabilities of MH were 10%, 22%,
46%, 63%, 72%, and 77.6% at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48,
and 60 months from the time of the initial endo-
scopic procedure, respectively (Figure 2). The
cumulative probabilities of endoscopic improve-
ment were 13%, 29%, 53.5%, 72%, 80%, and
83.6% at 6, 12, 24, 36, 48, and 60 months, respec-
tively (Figure 2).
Medical therapy adjustment after endoscopic
assessment. After endoscopic procedures, a total
of 171 patients received adjustments in medical
therapy in treating to target of MH (Figure 1).
The medical adjustments were made based on
comprehensive assessments of patients' symp-
toms, (ileo)colonoscopic findings, therapies
already tried, response to prior therapies, treat-
ment durations, and patients' willingness. As
shown in Figure 1, after endoscopic procedures, a
total of 237 adjustments in medical therapy were
performed as a result of finding ulcers at endos-
copy, whereas 430 endoscopic procedures were
not followed by adjustments in medical therapy
despite the presence of ulcers. TNF antagonists
were introduced in 42 naïve patients, optimized
with dose escalation or interval shortening in four
patients, and three patients switched to adalim-
umab. Immunosuppressive monotherapy (azathi-
oprine [AZA]/6-mercaptopurine [6MP] or
methotrexate [MTX] or thalidomide) was initi-
ated in 122 patients; 28 out of the above 49
patients receiving anti-TNF treatment were on
the combined therapy (AZA/6MP combined with
anti-TNFs).
Overall, MH was achieved in 78/237 treatment
adjustments. Regarding no MH under thiopu-
rines, 30 medical treatment adjustments were
performed based on endoscopic findings and
17/30 (57%) patients achieved MH. Similarly,
24/42 (57.1%) patients achieved MH on the
introduction or optimization of biologics.
Predictors of MH and endoscopy improvement.On
univariate analysis,disease duration of 18 months
or less at the initial endoscopy (hazard ratio [HR]:
1.62; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.07­2.47),
C-reactive protein (CRP) normalization within
12 weeks (HR: 1.72; 95% CI: 1.05­2.86),
repeated endoscopic procedures within 26 weeks
of the previous one (HR: 1.69; 95% CI: 1.14­
2.5), medical treatment adjustment when MH
was not achieved (HR: 2.29; 95% CI: 1.4­3.74),
and immunosuppressive use at follow up (HR:
1.61; 95% CI: 1.05­2.48) were positively associ-
ated with MH. In contrast, perianal disease at CD
diagnosis (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35­0.95), prior
enteric fistula (HR: 0.23; 95% CI: 0.06­0.91),
and prior bowel stricture (HR: 0.65; 95% CI:
0.42­0.99) were negatively associated with MH
(Table 2 and Figure 3). By multivariate
analysis,time between endoscopic procedures of
less than 26 weeks (HR: 1.56; 95% CI: 1.05­
3.39), adjustment of medical therapy (HR: 2.07;
95% CI: 1.26­2.33), prior enteric fistula (HR:
0.22; 95% CI: 0.06­0.91), perianal disease at CD
diagnosis (HR: 0.58; 95% CI: 0.35­0.95), and
CRP normalization within 12 weeks (HR: 3.23;
95% CI: 1.82­5.88) were independently associ-
ated with MH (Table 2).
A similar result was found regarding endoscopic
improvement. Age younger than 40 years (HR:
0.98; 95% CI: 0.96­0.99), endoscopic proce-
dures within 26 weeks (HR: 1.64; 95% CI:
1.14­2.34), adjustment of medical therapy
(HR: 2.21; 95% CI: 1.39­3.53), use of immu-
nosuppressives at follow up (HR: 1.98; 95% CI:
1.25­3.15), and CRP normalization within 12
weeks (HR: 2.17; 95% CI: 1.28­3.70) indepen-
dently predicted endoscopic improvement
(Supplementary Table 1).
Long-term follow up
Sustained MH.The median time of endoscopic
recurrence in patients who achieved MH was
R Mao, Y Qiu et al.
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 457
24.97 months (95% CI: 9.51­40.4 months). As
depicted in Figure 4(a), the cumulative probabil-
ity of maintaining MH was 78.6%, 57.9%, 40.9%,
and 40.9% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years, respectively.
Bowel surgery.Patients who achieved MH
had a decreased rate of surgery when compared
with patients with sustained ulceration with a
median bowel surgery-free survival of 97.8 + 5.2
months versus 52.4 + 5.2 months (p = 0.000)
(Figure 4(b)). Similarly, patients who achieved
endoscopic improvement had fewer bowel surger-
ies (p = 0.000).
Discussion
As demonstrated in the present study, MH was
associated with improved clinical outcomes, i.e.

period. MH, mucosal healing.

decreased rates of bowel surgery when compared
with patients with sustained endoscopic ulcera-
tion. MH is increasingly considered as the treat-
ment target for CD, but the feasibility and the
rate of achievement of MH in clinical practice
remains unclear. Data from 1-year trials, i.e. the
EXTEND trial and ACCENT I trial, indicate
rates of MH ranging from 24% to 31%.13,14 In the
SONIC trial, MH occurred in 43.9% of the
patients who received combination therapy at 6
months.6 Bouguen and colleagues8 found that the
cumulative probabilities of MH were 12.7% and
45.0% at 24 weeks and 52 weeks after adjusting
medical treatment based on a treat-to-target
strategy, respectively. However, data regarding
the MH rate in the long term are limited.
Colombel and colleagues6 reported that 73.1% of
patients receiving early combination therapy
achieved MH at week 104. In the present study,
the cumulative probabilities of MH at 26 weeks
and 52 weeks were 10% and 22%, respectively,
while MH rates rose to 46%, 63%, and 72% at 2,
3, and 4 years, respectively. The reason for the
relatively low MH rate may partly be due to the
limited use of biologics in our study. TNF-
antagonists were introduced only in 49 (18%)
patients. Moreover, a large number of patients
included in our study had experienced complica-
tions and perianal lesions, which may also explain
the relatively lower MH rate, as MH is more
achievable for patients with early CD.7
Little is known about the predictors of MH. Until
now no controlled prospective trials have been
designed to identify predictors of MH. Some
studies reported that shorter disease duration was
associated with higher MH rate.7 In contrast, per-
ianal disease at CD diagnosis and prior enteric
fistula and stricture were associated negatively
with MH.15­24 Our study showed that risk factors
for lower probability of MH were prior enteric fis-
tula and perianal disease at CD diagnosis. The
incidence of internal fistula, perianal disease, and
stenosis implies a type B2/3 disease behavior with
a more aggressive disease progression, which is
consistent with previous studies.20 Moreover, our
study demonstrated that a shorter time between
endoscopic procedures and subsequent medical
treatment adjustment was associated with a
higher rate of subsequent MH. These findings
may be interpreted as patients who are more
closely followed endoscopically also have higher
prospects for attaining MH thereafter. While the
reason for this association cannot be definitively
ascertained from the present study, it is possible
that the result of a higher chance of active inflam-
mation being disclosed by repeated endoscopies
and prompt medical interventions in these
patients, and/or that this subgroup of patients
undergoing more frequent endoscopies was cared
for by more proactive physicians. Recently, the
concept of treat-to-target strategy, which employs
the principles of systematic follow up of patients
and optimization of all available treatments to
reach the target in the treatment of CD, has been
increasingly advocated.9 Bouguen and colleagues
reported that treat to target is achievable by
appropriate endoscopic assessment and treat-
ment adjustment in patients with both CD8 and
ulcerative colitis25. This demonstrated the poten-
tial of adjusting therapy on the basis of an objec-
tive treatment target according to a predefined
Figure 2. Cumulative probability of achieving (a)
mucosal healing; (b) endoscopic improvement.

time frame. However, the follow up of these stud-
ies was only 62 weeks and 76 weeks, respectively.
Our present study evaluated the role of endo-
scopic assessment in treat to target of CD with
long follow up. Based on our result, we formu-
lated an algorithm for the treat to target of the
MH approach in patients with CD based on
endoscopy assessment and subsequent treatment
adjustment (Figure 5).
Introduction of biologics early in the course of the
disease, particularly in combination with immu-
nosuppressive agents, is one strategy for obtain-
ing higher rates of MH, as demonstrated in the
SONIC and step-up/top-down trials.5,6 In our
study, the use of biologics was significantly asso-
ciated with an increased rate of endoscopic
improvement (p = 0.01), but only showed a trend
for higher MH that did not reach statistical sig-
nificance (p = 0.07). This may possibly be due to
the relatively small number of anti-TNF-treated
patients and to the fact that biologics were mainly
used in a step-up fashion in our center, which is
known to be associated with a less favorable
response to biologics.

with MH. Similarly, our results demonstrated
the CRP normalization at week 12 independently
predicted MH and endoscopic improvement.
However, our study failed to demonstrate a positive
association between baseline CRP and subsequent
MH. This may be explained by a discrepancy
between clinical symptoms and objective findings
of inflammation.27 In our study, 10.4% of patients
experienced clinical symptoms despite MH,
whereas 33.5% of patients with significant endo-
scopic lesions presented no clinical symptoms.
At present, there is still some dispute about the
definition of MH. Schnitzler and colleagues2
reported that patients with CD who experienced
endoscopic improvement had similar long-term
clinical outcomes compared with patients who
experienced complete MH. In patients with CD,
endoscopic response could serve as a reliable pre-
dictor of clinical outcome based on a post hoc
analysis of data from the SONIC trial.28 Our
result showed that the cumulative probabilities of
endoscopic improvement were 13%, 29%,
53.5%, 72%, 80%, and 83.6% at 6, 12, 24, 36,
48, and 60 months, respectively. Bouguen and
colleagues8 reported that the rates of endoscopic
improvement were 22.4%, 49.2%, and 61.1% at
24, 52, and 62 weeks, respectively. Results from
the MUSIC trial demonstrated endoscopic
response rates in patients with active CD treated
with certolizumab pegol of 74.4% at week 54.29
Regarding the risk factors, our study demon-
strated that age younger than 40 years, endo-
scopic procedures within 26 weeks, adjustment
of medical therapy, and the use of immunosup-
pressives (AZA/6MP or MTX) during follow up
were independent predictors of endoscopic
improvement, which were consistent with previ-

Our study has certain limitations. Firstly, for the
retrospective nature of our study, one may argue
that the lack of standard endoscopic evaluation
could induce bias towards more endoscopic pro-
cedures in patients with clinical symptoms. To
minimize bias, the endoscopic procedures were
usually planned a priori at the time of the previ-
ous endoscopic procedure for the purpose of
assessing MH rather than being planned at the
time of the subsequent endoscopic procedure in
response to clinical symptoms. Secondly, the
lack of a control group (patients not undergoing
fixed endoscopies, or asymptomatic patients
undergoing endoscopies but without treatment
adaptation in the case of endoscopic lesions) is
another limitation. Further randomized clinical
trials with control groups are needed to confirm
our preliminary result. Last but not least, due to
the nature of the retrospective, observational
design of the present study, not all of the treat-
ment adjustments were followed with endo-
scopic examinations, so we did not calculate the
exact rate of MH for each treatment adjustment.
Further prospective clinical trials are warranted
in this setting.
In conclusion, our results suggest that more fre-
quent endoscopic monitoring, adjustments of

medical treatment after colonoscopy, and CRP
normalization within 12 weeks were associated
with a higher rate of subsequent MH, while prior
enteric fistula and perianal disease at CD diagno-
sis were associated with lower probability of MH.
For patients with identified risk factors, close
endoscopic monitoring and subsequent adjust-
ment of medical treatment are desirable for the
achievement of treat to target of MH in patients
with CD.
