ABSTRACT
InfectionoftheCNS(centralnervoussystem)withasublethal
neurotropic coronavirus (JHMV) induces a vigorous inflam-
matory response. CD4+ and CD8+ T cells are essential to
control infectious virus but at the cost of tissue damage. An
enigma in understanding the contribution of T cell subsets
in pathogenesis resides in their distinct migration pattern
across the BBB (blood brain barrier). CD4+ T cells transiently
accumulate within the perivascular space, whereas CD8+ T
cells migrate directly into the CNS parenchyma. As MMPs
(matrix metalloproteinases) facilitate migration across the
glia limitans, specific expression of the TIMP (tissue inhibitor
of MMPs)-1 by CD4+ T cells present in the perivascular cuffs
suggested that TIMP-1 is responsible for stalling CD4+ T cell
migration into the CNS parenchyma. Using TIMP-1 deficient
mice, the present data demonstrate an increase rather than
a decrease in CD4+ T cell accumulation within the perivas-
cular space during JHMV infection. Whereas virus control
was not affected by perivascular retention of CD4+ T cells,
disease severity was decreased and associated with reduced
IFN (interferon ) production. Moreover, decreased CD4+
T cell recruitment into the CNS parenchyma of TIMP-1 de-
ficient mice was not associated with impaired T cell recruit-
ing chemokines or MMP expression, and no compensation
by other TIMP molecules was identified. These data suggest
an MMP-independent role of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+
T cell access into the CNS parenchyma during acute JHMV
encephalitis.

INTRODUCTION
Immune responses to infections of the CNS (central nervous
system) need to be highly regulated in order to limit tis-
sue damage, which could lead to detrimental and even fatal
consequences as observed during many neuroinflammatory
disorders including multiple sclerosis and viral encephalitis.
To control immune function, the CNS displays specialized fea-
tures, which include lack of lymphatic drainage, parenchymal
dendritic cells and MHC (major histocompatibility complex)
expression, as well as the presence of the BBB (blood brain
barrier) (Galea et al., 2007; Ransohoff and Engelhardt, 2012).
The BBB is a complex and unique structure of the CNS,
which controls leukocyte infiltration into the parenchyma
(Bechmann et al., 2007). Leukocyte migration from the blood
into the CNS parenchyma at the post-capillary venules is a
multistep process (Owens et al., 2008). First, immune cells
cross an endothelial cell layer associated with a basement
membrane to reach the perivascular space. This initial step
involves a succession of interactions between leukocytes
and the BBB endothelium regulated by adhesion molecules,
chemokines and their receptors (Engelhardt and Ranso-
hoff, 2012). Nevertheless, leukocyte accumulation within the
perivascular space is not sufficient to exert effective or detri-
mental responses during CNS infection or neuroinflamma-
tory disorders (Tran et al., 1998; McCandless et al., 2006;
Toft-Hansen et al., 2006). To access the CNS parenchyma,
leukocytes must also cross the glia limitans composed of an-
other basement membrane and astrocyte endfeet. Due to
the distinct composition of these two basement membranes,
molecules regulating leukocyte migration across the BBB en-
dothelium are distinct from the ones involved at the glia

limitans, which requires expression of MMPs (matrix met-
alloproteinases) (Agrawal et al., 2006; Toft-Hansen et al.,
2006). MMP inhibition has been associated with leukocyte
retention within the perivascular space and limiting clini-
cal symptoms (Toft-Hansen et al., 2006). Similarly, decreased
MMP-2 and MMP-9 activity by inhibition of extracellular
MMP inducer is correlated with higher perivascular cuff
density and decreased EAE (experimental autoimmune en-
cephalomyelitis) severity (Agrawal et al., 2012). These data
emphasize the importance of leukocyte migration into the
CNS parenchyma during neuroinflammatory diseases and
suggest that MMPs are potential therapeutic targets to min-
imize disruption of the glia limitans. Nevertheless, intrinsic
mechanisms are already in place to limit MMP activity. Four
TIMPs (tissue inhibitors of MMPs) inhibit MMP proteolytic
activity by interacting with their Zn-binding motif (Brew et
al., 2000). Whereas TIMP-2, -3 and -4 are constitutively ex-
pressed within the CNS, TIMP-1 is induced upon inflammatory
stimuli (Gardner and Ghorpade, 2003) including EAE and viral
CNS infections (Pagenstecher et al., 1998; Khuth et al., 2001;
Zhou et al., 2005b). An imbalance in the MMP/TIMP ratio is as-
sociated with several neuroinflammatory disorders (Gardner
and Ghorpade, 2003). This is evidenced by decreased disease
severity after induction of EAE in transgenic mice with con-
stitutive TIMP-1 expression in the CNS, consistent with leuko-
cyte retention within the perivascular space (Althoff et al.,
2010). Similarly, T cell recruitment into the CNS parenchyma
is increased in TIMP-1 deficient (TIMP-1- / - ) mice infected
with Toxoplasma gondii (Clark et al., 2011). Altogether, these
data suggest that TIMP-1 can control leukocyte recruitment
into the CNS parenchyma by regulating MMP activity at the
glia limitans.
Following CNS infection with the non-fatal neurotropic
MHV (mouse hepatitis virus) strain JHMV, a rapid and well-
defined array of cytokines, chemokines and MMPs regulate
immune cell migration into the CNS parenchyma (Bergmann
et al., 2006). After initial infiltration of innate immune cells
[i.e. NK (natural killer) cells, neutrophils and monocytes], re-
cruitment of adaptive immune effectors is necessary to con-
trol virus replication and protect the host. Both CD4+ and
CD8+ T cells participate in viral clearance, as well as tis-
sue damage (Bergmann et al., 2001; Savarin et al., 2008;
Stohlman et al., 2008). CD4+ T cells provide help for CD8+ T
cell survival and optimal anti-viral functions within the CNS
(Zhou et al., 2005a; Phares et al., 2012). However, CD4+
and CD8+ T cells display differential migration patterns.
Whereas CD8+ T cells are directly recruited into the CNS
parenchyma after crossing the BBB, CD4+ T cells transiently
accumulate within the perivascular space before traffick-
ing into the parenchyma (Stohlman et al., 1998). Previous
analysis of MMP and TIMP expression demonstrated unique
TIMP-1 up-regulation within the CNS during JHMV infection
with no increased expression of TIMP-2, -3 and -4 (Zhou et
al., 2005b). In contrast to other models of CNS inflammation
(i.e. T. gondii infection and EAE), TIMP-1 was not upregu-
lated in astrocytes but was specifically expressed by CD4+
T cells confined to the perivascular space, with rare expres-
sion in CD4+ T cells within the CNS parenchyma (Zhou et al.,
2005b), suggesting that TIMP-1 delays CD4+ T cell migration
across the glia limitans.
The present study thus aimed to determine the role of
TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell recruitment into the CNS
parenchyma, as well as potential functional consequences
of altered CD4+ T cell distribution on JHMV induced en-
cephalomyelitis. Although virus clearance was not altered in
the absence of TIMP-1, disease severity was decreased be-
tween day 7 and 12 p.i. (post-infection), correlating with de-
creased IFN (interferon ) production. However, flow cyto-
metric analysis showed no difference in overall CNS leukocyte
infiltration comparing WT and TIMP-1- / - mice. Surprisingly,
immunohistochemistry revealed that TIMP-1 deficiency cor-
related with increased rather than decreased CD4+ T cell
accumulation in perivascular cuffs. No alterations in the ex-
pression of other TIMPs, MMPs or chemokines were observed
in infected TIMP-1- / - mice, suggesting the absence of com-
pensatory mechanisms. In addition, increased MMP9 activity
suggests during acute viral encephalomyelitis, TIMP-1 facil-
itates CD4+ T cell migration into the CNS parenchyma in a
MMP-independent manner.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Mice and virus
Homozygous TIMP-1 deficient (TIMP-1- / - ) mice on the
C57BL/6 background were kindly provided by Dr P.D. Soloway
(Cornell University, Ithaca, NY, U.S.A.) (Lee et al., 2005) and
bred locally. C57BL/6 control mice were purchased from the
National Cancer Institute (Frederick, MD, U.S.A.). The study
was carried out in accordance with the recommendations in
the National Institute of Health Guide for the Care and Use of
Laboratory Animals. All procedures were performed in com-
pliance with the Cleveland Clinic Institutional Animal Care
and Use Committee approved protocol number 2011-0553
and all efforts were made to minimize animal suffering. Mice
were infected i.c. (intracerebrally) at 6 to 7 weeks of age with
1000 pfu (plaque-forming units) of the glia tropic JHMV-
neutralizing mAb (monoclonal antibody)-derived 2.2v-1 vari-
ant (Fleming et al., 1986). Clinical disease severity was graded
daily according to the following scale: 0, healthy; 1, hunched
back and ruffled fur; 2, partial hind limb paralysis or inability
to maintain the upright position; 3, complete hind limb paral-
ysis, 4; moribund or dead. CNS virus titers were determined
by plaque assay from clarified homogenates of individual
mice as previously described (Stohlman et al., 2008). Briefly,
brains were homogenized in Dulbecco's PBS using TenBroeck
tissue grinders. Following clarification by centrifugation at
400×g for 7 min at 4C, supernatants were stored at - 70C

a murine astrocytoma cell line.
Isolation of CNS-derived cells and flow
cytometry
After centrifugation of brain homogenates, cell pellets were
resuspended in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with
25 mM HEPES (pH 7.2) and adjusted to 30% Percoll (Pharma-
cia). A 1 ml 70% Percoll underlay was added prior to centrifu-
gation at 800 g for 30 min at 4C. Cells were recovered from
the 30/70% interface and washed with the RPMI medium.
CNS-derived cells were then resuspended in FACS buffer (PBS
containing 0.1% (w/v)BSA) and non-specific binding inhib-
ited by incubation with mouse serum and anti-mouse FcIII/II
mAb for 15 min on ice. For surface staining, cells were incu-
bated with anti-CD45 (clone Ly-5), anti-Ly6G (clone 1A8),
anti-CD11b (clone M1/70), anti-F4/80 (Serotec), anti-CD4
(clone GK1.5), anti-CD8 (clone 53-6.7) and anti-I-A/I-E (clone
2G9) (all from BD Biosciences; except when indicated) for
30 min on ice. Cells were washed twice with FACS buffer and
fixed with 2% (v/v) PFA (paraformaldehyde) prior analysis.
Samples were analyzed using a FACS Calibur flow cytometer
(BD Biosciences) and FlowJo Software (TreeStar Inc.).
Histology
After ice-cold PBS perfusion followed by 4% PFA, brains
were dissected, fixed in 4% PFA for 1 h and incubated in
15% (w/v) sucrose for 30 min at room temperature (20C),
20% sucrose for 30 min at 4C and 30% sucrose overnight
at 4C. Tissues were stored in cryoprotection solution un-
til 30 m sections were prepared using a sliding microtome
(Leica Microsystems). Sections were treated with 1% (v/v)
Triton X-100 followed by blocking solution for 30 min each,
and then stained with rabbit anti-mouse laminin (Cedarlane
Laboratories, Ontario, Canada) and rat anti-mouse CD4 (BD
Pharmingen) overnight at 4C. Sections were then incubated
with Alexa Fluor 488 goat anti-rat (Invitrogen) and Alexa
Fluor 594 goat anti-rabbit (Invitrogen) secondary Abs for 1 h
at room temperature, mounted with Vectashield mounting
media (Vector Laboratories) and analyzed using a Leica SP5
confocal microscope. For CD4+ T cell quantification, brains
(at least three per group) were embedded in Tissue-Tek OCT
(Sakura Finetex), flash frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored
at - 70C until 10 m sagittal sections of whole brain were
prepared using a Thermo Shandon cryostat. Sections were
fixed for 10 min in cold acetone. Distribution of CD4+ T cells
was determined by immunoperoxidase staining with Vectas-
tain ABC immunoperoxidase kit (Vector Laboratories) using
purified rat anti-mouse CD4 (BD Pharmingen) as the primary
Ab, mouse adsorbed rabbit anti-rat IgG (Vector Laborato-
ries) as the secondary Ab and NovaRED (Vector
Laboratories) as the peroxidase chromogen. Stained tissue
sections with hematoxylin counterstain were evaluated for
distribution of CD4+ T cells in the perivascular space and
within the parenchyma in three 10× fields (cerebrum, brain
stem and cerebellum). Counts from the three regions were
totaled and expressed as percentage perivascular CD4/total
CD4. For analysis of demyelination, spinal cords were fixed in
10% (w/v) zinc formalin, divided in six sections (from cervi-
cal, thoracic and lumbar regions) and embedded in paraffin.
Sections were stained with LFB (Luxol Fast Blue) to quan-
tify areas of demyelination within the white matter tracks.
Sections at all six levels were analyzed in a blinded manner,
scanned with an Aperio ScanScope (Vista) at 40× and dig-
itally imaged at high resolution. The percentage of myelin
loss within white matter areas was quantified using Aperio
Software.
Gene expression analysis
RNA was extracted from individual brains homogenized
in TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manu-
facturer's instructions, DNase treated and reverse tran-
scribed as previously described (Phares et al., 2011). Semi-
quantitative gene expression was analyzed using a 7500

mRNA. Transcript levels were normalized to the housekeep-
ing gene GAPDH and converted to a linearized value using the
formula [2(CT

is the thresh-
old cycle value.

destained with the destain solution (Bio-Rad) until bands
appeared.

RESULTS
TIMP-1 deficiency decreases clinical disease
without altering virus clearance
To determine a role of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell
access to the CNS parenchyma, as well as functional conse-
quences, WT (wild-type) and TIMP-1- / - mice were infected
with the gliatropic JHMV strain of MHV. Signs of encephalitis,
characterized by hunched back and ruffled fur, were initially
observed around day 6 p.i. with no differences between WT
and TIMP-1- / - mice (Figure 1A). However, as symptoms
progressed throughout day 10 p.i., disease severity was sig-
nificantly decreased in infected TIMP-1- / - compared to WT
mice (Figure 1A). Nevertheless, reduced clinical symptoms
were only transient as both groups displayed similar disease
severity after day 12 p.i. (Figure 1A).
Disease severity during JHMV infection is not only depen-
dent on viral load, but also the balance of T cell activities,
especially IFN secretion (Kapil et al., 2009; Phares et al.,
2010). The complexity of these interactions is highlighted
by studies in mice with altered T cell activities: reduced
clinical disease despite similar virus load, coincided with re-
duced IFN in IL-12 p35 subunit deficient mice (Kapil et al.,
2009), while more severe clinical symptoms, despite acceler-
ated virus control coincident with increased IFN in B7-H1
deficient mice (Phares et al., 2010). The participation of both
CD4+ and CD8+ T cells in JHMV clearance and tissue damage
(Bergmann et al., 2001; Stohlman et al., 2008) and the helper
role of CD4+ T cells provided to anti-viral CD8 T cells within
the CNS (Stohlman et al., 1998; Phares et al., 2012) consti-
tute additional layers of complexity. Finally, the finding that
retention of T cells within the perivascular space is associated
with delayed control of JHMV replication and disease onset
(Savarin et al., 2010) supports the importance of parenchy-
mal T cell localization in determining pathogenic outcome.
Thus, transiently decreased disease severity in TIMP-1- / -
mice may be explained by accelerated parenchymal CD4+
T cell infiltration mediating accelerated local T cell activity
and virus control. However, similar peak virus replication at
day 5 p.i., and decline of virus titers at day 7 p.i. with a drop
below detection levels by day 14 p.i. in both groups, demon-
strated that control of virus replication was not altered by
the absence of TIMP-1 (Figure 1B). Similarly, reduced disease
severity did not correlate with decreased myelin loss in TIMP-
1- / - compared to WT mice, as extent of demyelination was
similar comparing the two groups at days 7, 10 and 14 p.i
(figure 1C).
However, analysis of a potential correlation between de-
creased disease severity and IFN, revealed that IFN mRNA
was reduced in the CNS of TIMP-1- / - compared to WT mice
at days 5 and 7 p.i. (Figure 1D). No differences in IFN were
noted at later times p.i. (Figure 1D) when virus replication was
already significantly reduced. These data demonstrated that
limited early IFN levels within the CNS were associated with
prolonged attenuated clinical disease in TIMP-1- / - mice.
Moreover, reduced IFN implied that local T cell stimulation
by viral antigen was specifically reduced in the absence of
TIMP-1 at the time of maximal T cell migration to the CNS.
TIMP-1 does not regulate overall CNS leukocyte
recruitment
Reduced IFN production during the peak of antigen specific
T cell stimulation within the CNS, suggested limited overall T
cell recruitment and/or limited T cell access to viral antigen.
Although IFN is mainly produced by T cells during JHMV
infection, IFN mRNA expression is more prominent in CD4+
compared to CD8+ T cells at the population level in vivo
(Phares et al., 2010), suggesting that decreased CNS IFN
production in TIMP-1- / - mice was mainly due to limited
CD4+ T cell responses. However, this contradicts our initial
hypothesis that the absence of TIMP-1 would facilitate CD4+
T cell access into, and thereby their effector function, within
the CNS parenchyma. Thus, to initially verify that TIMP-1 does
not affect overall leukocyte recruitment into the CNS dur-
ing JHMV infection, infiltrating CD45hi cells were measured
by flow cytometry (Figure 2). Although CD45hi leukocytes
were higher at day 7 p.i. in the CNS of TIMP-1- / - mice
compared to controls, no differences was noted at any other
time point (Figure 2). The composition of leukocyte infiltrates
was also not significantly altered by the absence of TIMP-1.
CNS neutrophil infiltration followed similar kinetics, with a
peak at day 3 p.i. and a slight, but not significant, increase
in TIMP-1- / - compared to WT mice (Figure 2). This modest
increase in neutrophils was sustained to day 10 p.i. The num-
ber of CNS monocytes in TIMP-1- / - mice was also slightly
increased at early time points, with the largest difference
observed at day 7 p.i. (Figure 2). Increased CD45hi leukocyte
infiltration at day 7 p.i. in TIMP-1- / - mice thus coincided
with a relative increase in monocyte recruitment, although
they decreased to similarly low levels after day 10 p.i. in both
groups (Figure 2). Importantly, neither CD8+ nor CD4+ T cell

recruitment was altered by TIMP-1 deficiency, as both popu-
lations peaked at almost identical levels between days 7­10
p.i. as in WT mice (Figure 2). There were also no differences
in virus-specific CD8+ T cell recruitment (results not shown),
consistent with similar virus clearance between both groups
(Figure 1B). Altogether, these data suggest that TIMP-1 only
exerts a minor influence on acute inflammation and does not
regulate the overall composition of leukocytes recruited into
the CNS following JHMV infection.
CD4+ T cells are retained in the perivascular
space of TIMP-1- / - mice
Specific TIMP-1 expression by CD4+ T cells, coincident with
their prolonged retention in the perivascular space at day
7 p.i. (Zhou et al., 2005b), initially suggested that TIMP-1
delays CD4+ T cell access to the CNS parenchyma by in-
hibiting MMP-dependent glia limitans disruption. However,
decreased IFN, despite similar CD4+ T cell recruitment, sug-
gested reduced CD4+ T cell effector function potentially due
to impaired access to viral antigen presenting target cells in
the parenchyma. This notion was tested by immunohistologic
analysis of the distribution of CD4+ T cells in the perivas-
cular space versus parenchyma (Figure 3A). Total numbers of
CD4+ T cells were similar in the brain of WT and TIMP-1- / -
mice at day 7 and 10 p.i. (Figure 3B), consistent with flow
cytometric analysis. However, CD4+ T cell retention within
the perivascular space was nearly increased by 30% in TIMP-
1- / - mice at day 7 p.i. (Figure 3B). Moreover, despite the
decreased extent of CD4+ T cell cuffs in both groups at day
10 p.i., preferential perivascular accumulation was sustained
to day 10 p.i. in the absence of TIMP-1 (Figure 3B). These re-
sults clearly support a revised notion that TIMP-1 promotes,
rather than limits, CD4+ T cell recruitment into the CNS
parenchyma during JHMV induced encephalitis.
CD4+ T cell retention within the perivascular
space is not associated with compensation by
TIMPs or altered MMP and chemokine expression
While decreased accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the
parenchyma was consistent with reduced antigen encounter

and thus IFN expression, the results were inconsistent with a
T cell retaining role of TIMP-1 noted in other models (Althoff
et al., 2010; Clark et al., 2011). We therefore investigated
whether accumulation of CD4+ T cells in the perivascu-
lar space of TIMP-1- / - mice correlated with dysregulated
chemokine and/or MMP/TIMP expression. However, we could
not detect significant differences in expression of CXCL10
or CCL5 mRNA or protein, two major chemoattractants of T
cells during JHMV infection (Stiles et al., 2006; Stiles et al.,
2009), comparing the two groups at day 7 p.i. (Figure 4), when
TIMP-1- / - CD4+ T cells accumulate within the perivascular
space.
The study of MMP/TIMP functions using gene deficient
animals demonstrated that the lack of a single molecule is
often counteracted by compensatory expression of similarly
functioning proteins in vivo (Dubois et al., 1999; Savarin
et al., 2011). To determine if TIMP-1 deficiency altered other
components associated with T cell trafficking, expression of
MMP inhibitors in the CNS was evaluated in both groups.
Na¨
ive mice express TIMP-1 mRNA at very low levels, but the
levels increased by 100-fold following JHMV infection (Fig-
ure 5A). Moreover, peak Timp-1 mRNA at day 7 p.i. correlates
with CNS CD4+ T cell recruitment (Figure 2). As expected,
TIMP-1 mRNA was undetectable in TIMP-1- / - mice (Fig-
ure 5A). TIMP-2, -3 and to a lesser extent TIMP-4 mRNA
were constitutively expressed at high levels within the CNS
of na¨
ive WT mice, but were not further up-regulated by in-
fection. Similar to the down regulation of TIMP-2 mRNA
expression following activation in vitro (Zhou et al., 2005b),
TIMP-2 mRNA expression in the CNS was reduced after JHMV
infection (Figure 5A); however no differences were observed
comparing WT and TIMP1- / - mice (Figure 5A). Furthermore,
stable TIMP-3 and -4 mRNA expression after JHMV infection
of WT mice was also not altered by the absence of TIMP-1

(Figure 5A). These data suggested that neither TIMP-2, -3 or
-4 compensate for the absence of TIMP-1 following JHMV
infection.
As MMPs regulate leukocyte migration through the glia
limitans (Toft-Hansen et al., 2006), potential alterations of
MMP expression or activity was also considered as a mech-
anisms underlying CD4+ T cell retention in the perivascular
space of TIMP-1- / - mice. Only a restricted number of MMPs
are induced following JHMV infection, including MMP-3 and
-9 by astrocytes and neutrophils, respectively, as well as
MMP-12 by multiple cell types (Zhou et al., 2005b). The ab-
sence of TIMP-1 did not alter the kinetics or levels of MMP-3
and -12 mRNA expression (Figure 5B). Furthermore, MMP-9
activity, measured by zymography, was similar in both groups
at day 3 p.i. (Figure 5C), consistent with identical neutrophil
infiltration (Figure 2). At day 7 p.i. TIMP-1- / - mice dis-
played increased MMP-9 activity (Figure 5C), supporting a
role of TIMP-1 as a major inhibitor of MMP9 activity in WT
mice (Roderfeld et al., 2007). Nevertheless, accumulation of
CD4+ T cells in the perivascular space of TIMP-1- / - mice,
despite increased MMP9 activity, suggests that CD4+ T cell
retention is MMP independent. Thus, decreased migration of
CD4+ T cells into the CNS parenchyma in the absence of
TIMP-1 was not associated with dysregulation of chemokine,

DISCUSSION
Migration of leukocytes into the CNS parenchyma requires
penetration of the endothelial layer as well as the glia lim-
itans. This two-step process is highly regulated at several
distinct levels involving, integrins, chemokines and MMPs
(Owens et al., 2008). Moreover, different infiltrating cell
types appear to contribute to these migration processes by
distinct mechanism, e.g. preferential chemokine responsive-
ness or MMP/TIMP release. A common observation in many
neuroinflammatory disorders is the distinct migration pat-
tern of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells through the BBB (Stohlman
et al., 1998; Siffrin et al., 2009; Ploix et al., 2011). Whereas
CD8+ T cells traverse into the CNS parenchyma efficiently,
CD4+ T cells appear to be transiently retained within the
perivascular space. This pattern is clearly demonstrated dur-
ing JHMV encephalomyelitis, in which both CD4+ and CD8+
T cells are essential in mediating virus clearance accompanied
by tissue damage (Bergmann et al., 2006). Transient retention
of CD4+ T cells within the perivascular space raises both the
question of its functional relevance, as well as the identifica-
tion of molecules regulating T cell access to the parenchyma.
During JHMV infection TIMP-1 is specifically expressed by
CD4+ T cells when present in perivascular cuffs, but not
when located in the parenchyma (Zhou et al., 2005b). These
data suggested that TIMP-1 might control CD4+ T cell reten-
tion within the perivascular space by disrupting MMP activity
at the glia limitans (Toft-Hansen et al., 2006). However, re-
sults presented herein indicate that TIMP-1 promotes rather
than delays CD4+ T cell migration to the CNS parenchyma
as evidenced by increased retention of CD4+ T cells around
the CNS post-capillary venules in the absence of TIMP-1.
Furthermore, similar expression patterns of chemokines and
MMPs and TIMPs in TIMP-1- / - and WT mice, support an
MMP independent function of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T
cell access to the CNS parenchyma.
TIMP-1 was initially characterized as an inhibitor of MMP
activity, with a primary role in remodeling the extracellular
matrix (Brew et al., 2000). TIMP-1-dependent MMP inhibi-
tion is also implicated in several other biological processes, in-
cluding cell growth, angiogenesis and apoptosis (Gardner and
Ghorpade, 2003). However, TIMP-1 also exerts MMP indepen-
dent effects (Stetler-Stevenson, 2008), i.e. apoptosis or cell
proliferation, highlighting its complex and pleiotropic func-
tions. Despite a correlation between imbalanced MMP/TIMP
activity with several neuroinflammatory disorders (Gard-
ner and Ghorpade, 2003), the role of TIMP-1 remains elu-
sive. During EAE, constitutive TIMP-1 exerts a protective
role by maintaining BBB integrity through MMP inhibition
and limiting leukocyte infiltration into the CNS parenchyma
(Althoff et al., 2010). During chronic EAE, TIMP-1 plays an
MMP-independent role (Crocker et al., 2006), potentially by
promoting oligodendrocyte progenitor differentiation and
remyelination (Moore et al., 2011). While our data sup-
port an MMP independent function of TIMP-1 in promoting
leukocyte migration across the glia limitans, the mechanism

remains unclear. Increased proteases may inactivate func-
tion of molecules essential in CD4 T cell migration within the
CNS parenchyma. Another mechanism may involve TIMP-1
interaction with the tetraspanin CD63 (Jung et al., 2006).
CD63 is upregulated by activated human T cells and acts
as a co-stimulatory molecule (Pfistershammer et al., 2004).
Thus, restimulation of CD4+ T cells upon entry into the CNS
might be altered in the absence of TIMP-1 and CD63 com-
plexes, leading to accumulation of insufficiently activated
CD4+ T cells within the perivascular space. Restimulation of
CD4+ T cells after interaction with antigen-presenting cells
within the perivascular space is a prerequisite for disease
pathogenesis in EAE (Greter et al., 2005). Indeed, retention of
CD4+ T cells within the perivascular space of JHMV infected
TIMP-1- / - mice also correlated with decreased disease
severity and IFN production. Whether decreased IFN is a

consequence of reduced antigen presenting cell-T cell acti-
vation in the perivascular space or limited T cell access to
parenchymal antigen presenting cells remains unclear. Nev-
ertheless, CD4+ T cells are potent producers of IFN during
JHMV infection (Phares et al., 2010) and both IFN and CD4+
T cells contribute to disease severity (Kapil et al., 2009; Phares
et al., 2012). IFN activates microglia/macrophages, which
enhance disease severity during JHMV infection (Savarin et
al., 2010) as well as other neuroinflammatory diseases (Ajami
et al., 2011).
CD4+ T cells also promote virus-specific CD8+ T cell re-
sponses both during initial peripheral activation and at the
effector site during JHMV infection (Stohlman et al., 1998;
Phares et al., 2012). Nevertheless, CD4+ T cell accumulation
within the perivascular space did not affect control of virus
replication, suggesting that CD8+ T cells, primary media-
tors of JHMV control, were fully functional in the absence
of TIMP-1. CD4+ T cell helper function to CD8+ T cells thus
appeared to be preserved despite altered CD4+ T cell distri-
bution in the absence of TIMP-1.
Finally, the difference between the MMP-independent
function of TIMP-1 during JHMV infection and its role in lim-
iting leukocyte access through the BBB by inhibiting MMPs in
other neuroinflammatory models (Althoff et al., 2010; Clark
et al., 2011) may correlate with the cellular source of TIMP-1.
Indeed, TIMP-1 is specifically expressed by CD4+ T cells dur-
ing JHMV infection with no parenchymal expression (Zhou
et al., 2005b). By contrast, TIMP-1 is up-regulated in as-
trocytes during both EAE (Pagenstecher et al., 1998) and
toxoplasma infection (Clark et al., 2011), and also limits T
cell access to the CNS parenchyma. Astrocyte endfeet are
part of the glia limitans and are adjacent to the parenchy-
mal basement membrane, which is disrupted by MMPs (Toft-
Hansen et al., 2006). Thus, astrocytic secretion of TIMP-1
may directly inhibit MMP activity at the glia limitans be-
cause of their close proximity. By contrast, during JHMV in-
fection, TIMP-1 may have limited access to the enzymatic
site of MMPs and act in an autocrine fashion (Oelmann et al.,
2002).
In summary, our data demonstrate a novel MMP-
independent role of TIMP-1 in regulating CD4+ T cell migra-
tion across the glia limitans during viral encephalitis. Whereas
reduced CD4+ T cell access to the CNS parenchyma did not
affect viral control, disease severity was reduced. Thus, tar-
geting TIMP-1 may represent a potential therapeutic target
to reduce pathogenesis, without altering virus clearance, dur-
ing viral encephalomyelitis.
