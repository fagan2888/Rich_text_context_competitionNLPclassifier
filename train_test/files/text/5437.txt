Introduction
The concept of centralization was shared among the post-
colonial countries in the 1960s, and the reasons for it were
the need for central development planning and an appeal for
contemporary ways of handling development plans, which
emerged as a result of the growth occurrences because the
society had not become more complex. The alteration from
central to local authority was noticed in Latin America,
Africa, and Asia in the 1970s as a result of the disenchant-
ment with the centralized system of governance (Brillantes
& Cuachon, 2002; Burns, Hambleton, & Hoggett, 1994;
Smoke, 2003). Over the past several decades, many coun-
tries have implemented decentralization as an all-embracing
strategy for government transformation (Smith, 1985).
In developed countries, decentralization was stimulated
as a way of rationalizing government administration and
addressing the frustration of red tape and service provision
(Burns et al., 1994). Although decentralization was moti-
vated to expand service delivery and check on the central
government failures in East Asia (White & Smoke, 2005),
the rationale was different in sub-Saharan Africa due to
increased demand for people participation in decision mak-
ing as a result of multi-party politics (Smoke, 2003), whereas
the desire for the democratization process influenced decen-
tralization in Latin America (Burns et al., 1994).
Many countries that had earlier undertaken decentraliza-
tion are now recentralizing and increasing their number of
administrative units (Malesky, Nguyen, & Tran, 2012). This
trend is not unique to Uganda but Africa in general and other
countries such as Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Brazil, Morocco,

Recentralization of Kampala City
Administration in Uganda: Implications
for Top and Bottom Accountability

Abstract
The government disseminated a new constitution in 1995 with the provision on decentralization of Article 176 2 (b) that
acted shortly before the rebirth of the local government act in 1997. Devolution as a form of decentralization transferred
both political and administrative powers from the center to lower local councils specially to handle the responsibility of
service delivery. Following the approval of the Kampala Capital City Authority (KCCA) Act 2010, the city's administration
reverted to the central government. Detractors of decentralization allege that the conveyance in the policy and legislation
for change of Kampala city administration was timely because decentralization failed to deliver desired services to residents.
This article contends that recentralization of Kampala city administration was a necessary evil, it decreased the autonomy
of sub-national governments in civil service administration, eroded accountability to the electorates, and transferred the
allegiance of the accounting officer from local governments with and for which they work to the central government that
designates and positions. To inflame accountability in local governments, the article champions for the reexamining of the
KCCA Act 2010 to allow power sharing between the mayor and executive director to enhance bottom-up accountability,
checks and balances, and for participation of central government in appointing of executive director to allow financial and
security support. It additionally requests for a reconsideration of the 9th Parliament to lobby for the amendments owing to
challenges in its implementation and impact on accountability.

Although this transformation has significant implications in
the way it alters the comprehensive assortment of power
relations specifically the electorates', the topography,
economic, and community closeness to local representatives
and administrators' contact points for services provision, as
well as local authorities' relationships with the central state,
have been widely ignored by researchers. The emphasis of
this article is that the decentralization led to recentralization
of Kampala city, which later weakened bottom accountabil-
ity to the electorate.
This was supported by Grossman and Lewis (2014), that
the creation of districts leads to "change in the intergovern-
mental balance of power that favors the central government
since the units have low bargaining power and tend to be
highly dependent on the center for resources, planning, and
service delivery" (p. 215), which also facilitates "dependency
in terms of administrative centralization" (Lewis, 2014,
p. 576) and increasing the number of units has many implica-
tions to nations (Malesky, 2009).
Uganda dispersed a new constitution in 1995 (Government
of Uganda [GOU], 1995) with the provision on decentraliza-
tion of Article 176 2 (b) that acted shortly before the rebirth
of the Local Government Act (GOU, 1997). Devolution as a
form of decentralization transferred both political and admin-
istrative powers from the center to lower local councils spe-
cially to handle the responsibility of service delivery. The
elected mayors, chair persons, and councils of sub-counties
in Kampala were locally accountable to the electorate, and
public service was therefore considered to be the mast of
highly decentralized local governance.
The failure for local governments in Kampala to deliver
services resulted into a new Kampala City Council (KCC)
Act where we witnessed partnership arrangements and inter-
governmental relationships (city­sub-county merger) under
the current administration of KCC (herein after referred to as
Kampala Capital City Authority--KCCA1), which was set
up after the approval of the KCC Act (GOU, 2010) and the
appointment of the current executive director as the chief
executive of the authority, the accounting officer, and head-
ship of the central government in the authority. This would
help to restructure, transform, and reposition the authority to
deliver quality services to the people of Kampala.
When President Yoweri Kagutta Museveni took state
power after a protracted war (1980-1986), drastic changes in
local government were witnessed. The president's guiding
principle of participatory democracy through decentraliza-
tion was to delegate tasks, duties, and accountabilities from
the center to the local units (Okumu-Wengi, 1994; Villadsen
& Lubanga, 1996). The policy intention was to enhance the
transfer of scale and scope responsibilities at the lowest pos-
sible administration unit, which has been described as a form
of alteration that is remarkable among developing nations
(Steiner, 2006). From one standpoint, the policy has been
described by Francis and James (2003) as the greatest
wholesale local revolution reorganization program among all
developing countries. Another point of view by Mitchinson
(2003) maintains that Uganda's localization agenda is a
unique, comprehensive delegation inventiveness of any state
in the time release.
After the central government conceding its inability to
provide services because of its big debts and obligations, the
resistance statute was put in place. This was accompanied by
the Local Government Act, which empowered local govern-
ment to deliver services through contracting out (GOU,
1997). The central government adopted the decentralization
policy to empower district governments and lower govern-
ment units with a view of taking services nearer to the peo-
ple. It was the way of involving people in their affairs so as
to give them the best in terms of quality and quantity.
Local government under decentralization embraced con-
tracting out selected public services to private firms. Tenders
were awarded to successful firms to deliver particular ser-
vices to the people, and in the late 1990s and late 2000s, it
had become a fashion for all the districts in Uganda.
Contracting out had proved to be an important method of
prioritizing community social services, which is in the 1997
Local Government Act.
TheUnitedNationsConferenceonTradeandDevelopment
(UNCT; 1995) addressed privatization as a national strategy
of giving mandate to the local people to determine their pri-
orities and also is in line with Article One of the Uganda's
Constitution (GOU, 1995) which states that power belongs
to the people. However, there are some misgivings about
the whole concept of contracting out in the delivery of ser-
vices under the decentralization program. Some of the con-
tracts have been taken over by "`Mafias'Who Hijack Tenders
and Deliver `Air'" (2002; Monitor Newspaper, 2002). These
are accusations and counter accusations of corruption and
substandard work by firms (Monitor Newspaper, 2002). Two
decades later, public services were not desirable. According
to a local newspaper in Uganda (Semujju, 2013), the major-
ity of Ugandans decry of poor service delivery.
The disappointment of private­public partnership and the
accumulation of districts to 117 by 2012 coupled with scarce
resources found many new districts unfortunate. Because the
expansion has not been proportional to the growth of the
resource envelope, infrastructure, and human resources, ser-
vices delivery in many districts has stagnated.
It was envisioned that the authority would become an
institution that would transform the past challenges of inad-
equate and poor quality service, lack of operational guide-
lines and standards, inadequate professionalism, poor
inspection to confirm compliance to approved specifications,
corruption, among many other service delivery issues, into
operations with clearly defined administrative and technical
structures that would enable the government to deliver much
needed services to the residents of Kampala City.
The authority was established with a strong legal frame-
work as detailed in the KCC Act (GOU, 2010) with the
Madinah et al. 3
mandate of providing a territorial boundary for Kampala and
with a view of providing the following: developmental ser-
vices; providing the structure and voting of representatives
of the authority as well as their removal; voting and elimina-
tion of the lord mayor and deputy mayor; the arrangement,
controls, and roles of the executive director and deputy exec-
utive director; to provide for the lower urban councils; the
devolution of tasks and amenities, delivery of services for a
city physical planning authority for Kampala and neighbor-
ing regions, among many other issues. This legal framework
was intended to guide the operations and conduct of the
authority, the administrative staff as well as the political arm
of the authority.
With the onset of the said Act, it became critical to start a
process of reviewing the authority-specific policies and
organizational, structural, and governance issues pertaining
to the effective and efficient operations of this very important
body in the creation and establishment of effective systems,
processes, and controls in its operations. It became impera-
tive to evaluate the realignments and best practices in their
operations and wider civil service to ascertain the implica-
tion of district creation and later recentralization of Kampala
on top-bottom accountability to the electorate.
The article proceeds as follows: First, we explore the intro-
duction of the decentralization reform; second, discuss the
theories underpinning recentralization; and third, methodol-
ogy. We then discuss the recentralization of Kampala City;
fourth, we provide the post-recentralization scenario, and
offer the underpinnings of how recentralization of Kampala
city undermined bottom accountability, as well as the change
in power and control, and also provide the restricted power
for the political wing in KCCA and then conclude with dis-
cussion of our findings in the section "Conclusion."
Theories Underpinning
Recentralization
Basing on the depiction from various initial theories of com-
bined dynamic action, institutional approach, collective
action, democratic representation, intergovernmental rela-
tions, and state building, this article argues that with the
option of decentralization reforms, district unit creation
makes states vulnerable to recentralization of intergovern-
mental authority, which then affects accountability to the
electorate due to "over dependence at the centre" (Lewis,
2014, p. 576). We propose five means through which this can
happen and each suggests a separate domain of intergovern-
mental relations, institution, democratic, change in power
and control, and restricted power for political representatives
that is influenced by the creation of several new district units.
First, there are extras beyond the design of the decentral-
ized system than allocation of revenue and expenditure
responsibilities to various ranks of the state. The argument
by Azfar, Kähkönen, Lanyi, Meagher, and Rutheford (1999)
and Litvack, Ahmad, and Bird (1998) is that, institutions
determine the accomplishment of any program, this may
imply the game rules of the society and limitations that affect
the organization, human behavior, and other means that sup-
port the guidelines. Chanie (2007) and Bahl (1999) argued
that decentralization will capture accountability upwards,
improve transparency, and increase local voice if local lead-
ership is elected rather than appointed by higher level of gov-
ernment, and if this is adhered to, it can improve the
relationship between the center and region.
Second, intergovernmental relationship determines the
complex relationship between different levels of govern-
ments due to mixing power with accountability tasks. This
relationship is regarded as reciprocal, where one relies on the
other to perform certain tasks components (Chanie, 2007).
The relationship is multifaceted due to the variations in the
corresponding roles of both higher and lower local govern-
ments confirmed by cumulative alterations in number and
responsibilities in delivering most of the communal services
appropriate for local demands through over-reliance on the
center through the joining capacity to act collectively.
Third, the partition of units upholds not only transfer of
resources and decision-making power to lower levels of gov-
ernment, but also lowers representatives with authority to be
accountable to the citizens, requests for accountability, and
improves public involvement in the lower local political
practice. The advocates of this argue that, there is nothing
less than total involvement in the process of policy formula-
tion and they insist on full participation of individual inhabit-
ants rather than pseudo-participation (Hart, 1972), which
reduces accountability to the voters.
Fourth is the change in power and control through creat-
ing various channels of reporting. This lessens the span of
control and leads to over-supervision of lower representa-
tives, hence becoming accountable to the center rather than
the electorate because their positions have been made cere-
monial. Finally the restricted power for political reform of
creation of many units has deprived elected politicians and
remarkably weakened mechanism of democracy in favor of
center. This leads to different collusion and contestation
among local representatives because the reforms have under-
privileged their controls and influence.
Although bottom accountability issues are frequently
ignored in prevailing studies on decentralization, it plays a
significant part in center-lower dealings and country struc-
ture in many modern African countries due to weak institu-
tions inherited from the past colonial masters and an
associated susceptibility to sideline revolutions.
To validate these opinions, the article explores chrono-
logical disparity in the scope of recentralization and decen-
tralization in Uganda. Uganda is an appropriate example for
this study because, similar to many African nations, in the
1980s it diverted from a post-independence period branded
by centralized system of governance.
In the initial 1990s, it embraced and commenced
extremely aspiring decentralization transformations and
4 SAGE Open
other national development program efforts, although in the
same period undergoing frequent rural rebellions. In present
years, under the governance of President Museveni and the
National Resistance Movement (NRM), that has controlled
the country for almost three decades, the country has con-
verted gradually to a centralized system of governance
including the units within the capital city Kampala (CCK).
Using original evidence from field interviews, and aca-
demic and policy studies on Uganda, we explored the asso-
ciations between district unit multiplication as a result of
Uganda's ambitious decentralization policy and the center
succeeding, reducing of delegated control of political power
through the use of Act 2010 (GOU, 2010), restricted power
for politicians, and administrative and intergovernmental
control that undermined accountability to the electorate.
Finally, as we contend below, the creation of districts as
administrative units expected to have impacts on intergov-
ernmental stability of authority thus support the develop-
ments of recentralization.
We explore the reduction of delegated control of political
power through use of the Act (GOU, 2010) which restricted
power for politicians, administrative workforce using inter-
governmental control of division unit creation and this has
undermined bottom accountability. Notwithstanding the
occurrence of district creation in emerging nations and its
prospects to significantly form the economic, political, and
social consequences, the prevailing academic works on the
causes of these occurrences are not sufficient that we pursue
to address.
The current literature addresses top-down strategy, politi-
cal incentives, importance, agency of local actors, ethnic
patronage network, fading powers of provincial opposition
powers, and effects of how proliferation shapes the intergov-
ernmental balance of power (Green, 2010; Grossman &
Lewis, 2014; Kasara, 2006; Kraxberger, 2004; Lewis, 2014).
We speculate that the employed justification of district cre-
ation leading to recentralization reform is significant for the
political survival of the NRM regime.
This article makes two significant contributions to the
promising district proliferation literature. One contribution is
the premeditated, planned, and protected efforts by the state
to negate some of the elements for smooth managing of the
policy, and second, the negative impact of recentralization of
Kampala city on bottom accountability and the findings in
this article have implications for several diverse literatures.
Overall, this article participates in building the literature
on decentralization, arguing that even when decentralization
reforms are characterized by creating more districts through
dividing big districts into small ones, it can have far-reaching
effects hence contributing to recentralization of power. The
linkage between district unit creation and intergovernmental
authority is forthright because it is through the relationships
that accountability to the electorates is undermined and this
article builds on Grossman and Lewis (2014), Lewis (2014),
and Ziblatt (2004), who argue that the creation of a large
number of new local governments fragments existing ones
into smaller units with lower intergovernmental power and
weak administrative capacity. Such a situation contributes to
an augment of dependence of local governments on the
resources and technical expertise of the central government
(Lewis, 2014).
In the last part of our study, we offer evidence from inter-
views with mayors, deputy mayors, councilors, senior
administrative staff in KCCA, ministry of public service,
ministry of local government, and ministry of health in the
five sub-counties that settles with our argument that recen-
tralization of districts that shadowed Uganda's decentraliza-
tion transformations backed up the recent recentralization of
power hence undermining bottom accountability. To the best
of our knowledge, no previous study reflects the possibility
that the assumed to be just an indicator of decentralization
program can indeed lessen bottom accountability and affect
the intergovernmental authority.
Method
This qualitative study investigates the consequences of
recentralization of Kampala city administration on top-bot-
tom accountability in a highly devolved country. Data were
gathered through semi-structured interviews with 15 codes
and 35 interviews purposively selected from mayor, deputy
mayors, councilors, senior administrative staff in KCCA,
ministry of public service, ministry of local government, and
ministry of health in the five sub-counties of KCCA in
Uganda. The information was analyzed using thematic and
content analysis. Although the findings are not generalizable
globally, they nuance our understanding of perverse effects
of recentralization of city administration on accountability to
electorates in local governments. This article is an extension
of a few works done as a by-product of recentralization in
Uganda (Lewis, 2014) and the uniqueness of the article is in
recent recentralization and the impact on the electorate in
terms of accountability. Table 1 shows the codes of inter-
viewees, their organizations, and the total number of inter-
viewees interviewed.
Recentralization of Kampala City
Administration
The new Act provided that the authority will be constituted
by technical and the political arm. The technical arm will
constitute the executive director's office and 10 directorates
as provided for by the KCC Act (GOU, 2010) whereas the
political arm will constitute the lord mayor and the divisional
mayors.
In terms of organization structure, KCC was organized
under eight divisions and two units, which included the may-
or's office as indicated in the following functions: administra-
tion, internal audit, education and sports, engineering and urban
planning, finance/treasury, health, legal services, welfare and
Madinah et al. 5
community services, projects unit and mayor's office, and in
terms of human resource deployment and development, as on
31 March, 2011, the authority was operating with 1,055 staff,
excluding casual workers.
The major considerations for recentralization of KCCA
were to revamp the former KCC to turn it into an authority
that revolves around the following:
i. Provide much needed services to the capital city.
ii. Promote the culture of effective customer service and
responsiveness to change.
iii. Develop institutional infrastructure for better gover-
nance in terms of systems and controls.
iv. Promote democratic principles and good governance
in the operations of KCCA.
v. Empower people through a system of governance
that is characterized by transparency, accountability,
and equitable resource allocation and usage, among
others.
It is against this background that we contextually think
that the above concerns can be implicit. Certainly, there was
an urgent need to protect the city's image in terms of sanita-
tion and beautification, there was double-dealing and incom-
petence in the prior management of KCC but this is not
enough justification for central government to defend their
absenteeism for robust support for the sub-national govern-
ments, which usually results into recentralization and chaos
(Mawhood, 1993).
Throughout the geographical disparity, Uganda govern-
ment decided to recentralize only the capital city and not all
municipalities in the country by forming an authority, which
is over and above the city in the illusion of renovating service
delivery.
The intensive attempt to recover potential ways through
the legal instrument reiterates the factual contention that
decentralization as a system of governance can only be effec-
tive and operational if local upper class approves of the deal
with central government (Mawhood, 1993). Similarly, the
reinforcement that central government has given to the new
administrative system is a comprehensible manifestation of
its lack of interest to respond to the cries from the prior
administrators of the city. Central government's decision to
recentralize the city is like, "change horses in the mid-
stream"; a perfect signal that Uganda could not stand the
assessment of time as a comprehensive and role model of
wholesale decentralization system in the developing world.
The scenery started in 1997 through the city development
strategy (CDS) that later proposed the innovative forms of
service delivery and acknowledgment of continuous infra-
structure neglect in the city, this coupled with outstanding
disapproval of the city administration by the central govern-
ment. As a result of heterogeneous electro results in the past
which gave the ruling party, NRM, a leveled opportunity and
argument for a straight and muscular intrusion in the admin-
istration of Kampala took strive. KCCA­NRM councilors
argued that
we have been waiting for right time for them (opposition
politicians) to go and we manage the city, in no time the relevant
ministry will allocate funds required to revamp the roads in
Kampala; it was not our responsibility to do their work but now
it is ours (NRM) and we will live up to the challenge.
This declaration highlights the penetrating political pres-
sure that politicians were nursing under the ruling party to
take over the administration of the city. Other councilors
from Democratic Party (DP) in KCCA argued that
we have been reviewing the performance of this regime critically;
it is coming to three decades of NRM rule but Kampala street
roads have rivers and lakes (pot holes); we know as much as they
do (NRM politicians) that reconstruction can be done if central
government has the willingness but of course not, since we have
been defeating them democratically and city administration is in
our hands. Now they are forcing themselves back into the
administration after passing the new Act to recentralize within
the decentralization reign.
This assertion emphasizes the strong rivalry between
the ruling party and opposition politicians' pressure and
resources spent in competing for the management of the
city. However, there are admissible uncertainties within
the opposition and ruling party camps that the recentraliza-
tion of city administration may respectively alter political
pressure from bottom (local level) to top (central govern-
ment), which is indeed the case.

Third, the justification for the flexible combined effort on
safeguarding democratic principles and good governance in
the operations of KCCA is a local government mandate that
existed since the inception of the first draft of Local
Government Act of 1997, as the mayor asserted that
. . . An Act to alter, merge and rationalize the current law on
devolution in line with the Constitution to provide outcome to
the decentralisation and delegation of roles, controls and
amenities; and to deliver for regionalization at all stages of local
governments to safeguard good supremacy and self-governing
involvement, and regulate resolutions by the voters; and to
arrange for income and the party-political and managerial
arrangements at the local level; and to position for voting of
Indigenous Councils . . .
These assertions climaxed the searching of already exist-
ing wins and used them as a justification for central govern-
ment under the ruling party to take over the management of
the city. One can argue that government is exercising its pow-
ers under delegation of function by the minister to undertake
charge of roles and amenities allocated to the region assembly
and as such, the central government recalls any contributions
relating to any assignment returning to the state (GOU, 1997).
In terms of empowering people through the system of
governance, that is, transparency, according to the constitu-
tion of Uganda 1995, the political objectives specifically out-
line the democratic principles, fundamental rights and
freedoms, and above all the independence of the electorate;
authority has its place among the public and the populace can
show their feelings and agreement on who is capable of
administering them, how, and via systematic, unrestricted,
and fair-minded voting. People empowerment is a right that
should be upheld and not used as a validation for the city
administration.
All interviewees in spite of the political party (councilors
from NRM and other political parties like DP, Forum for
Democratic Change [FDC]) were in agreement that central
government is pocketing people's rights given to them by the
constitution of Uganda in one common fight to retain their
power at the local level. They continued to argue that
all their roles have been hijacked by the executive director, she
does not account to them, yet they are accountable to the
electorate. They have been shelved and condensed to sign
passport forms other than budgets, supervise and evaluate
programs, projects and works in their divisions which they think
is unfair. No wonder some division mayors were behind the lord
mayor during the court sessions in which the executive director
accused the mayor for failure to execute his duties.
This is labeled as "a house divided among itself cannot
stand."
The 1995 constitution of Uganda, the movement political
system conforms to principles, that is, transparency, account-
ability and democracy, participatory democracy, and creation
of organs for equitable resource allocation and usage, among
others. Chapter 11 especially lays the principles of local gov-
ernments as opposed to recentralization and upholds that
. . . devolution will be the norm relating to all stages of local
government and, precisely, from upper to lower local
governments divisions to guarantee peoples' involvement and
representative regulation in resolution production. The structure
will be in a way that guarantees the total realization of
representative supremacy at all indigenous supervision points;
suitable procedures intend to be followed to allow local
governments entities to strategize, begin and implement
guidelines in admiration of all aspects upsetting the populace
within their authorities . . .
According to Manyak and Katono (2010), the ruling party
is assassinating their own child. The processes put in place as
reasons for decentralization are being used by the same
regime as arguments against it but in favor of recentraliza-
tion, hence district creation leads to recentralization. One can
argue that such outlined considerations cannot apply to jus-
tify a reform or for both systems to prevail. Nevertheless, the
camp in support of recentralization finally accomplished the
mission, and Parliament passed the KCC Act (GOU, 2010),
and the responsibility for city administration lies in the hands
of government notwithstanding the fact that opposition par-
ties, that is, FDC, JEEMA (Justice Forum), and DP repeat-
edly retained the places in Kampala during nationwide and
resident voting.
The factions against recentralization argue that power has
been hijacked from the electorate yet the mandate is consti-
tutional. It rather makes sense for government to argue that
"bigger is better" for Kampala city, a familiar argument
developed by Australian merger supporters because of con-
siderable economies of scale in divisions' service delivery as
a result of fundamental compulsory amalgamation. The con-
cept has substituted organizational alteration and suggestions
in Australian local council management (Dollery, Byrnes, &
Crase, 2008).
Promoting the culture of effective customer service and
responsiveness to change as a justification for recentraliza-
tion will take shape if government funds the customer rela-
tionship management tools and designs service level
agreements and call centers which are not only expensive but
need expert knowledge and skills. Thus, this argument is not
only farfetched but it is far from being optimal.
Argument in Favor of Recentralization and
Decentralization a Global View
Nationwide supervisions frequently trust that efficiency can
be better by combining current indigenous divisions into big-
ger native establishments such as, Sørensen (2006) contends
that, bigger divisions can adventure financial prudence; they
have an extra vigorous fiscal foundation and considerable
Madinah et al. 7
supremacy capability, so they can deliver extra challenging
functions, whereas minor indigenous divisions are unable to
take on numerous significant productions due to absence of
supremacy capability to deliver a sum of dedicated commu-
nity amenities.
Cost effectiveness demands for the lowest amount of pro-
duction, and delivery of indigenous communal goods entails
a definite number of residents to realize. In his support,
Dollery et al. (2008) and Dollery and Crase (2004) acknowl-
edged economies of scale and emphasized the necessity to
the amalgamation of minor and fiscally "not capable" coun-
tryside and local committees into bigger combined metro-
politan establishments. Warner and Hebdon (2001) claimed
that the public­public partnership model permits countries to
attain economies of scale when governments retain provision
possession of services in the public sector.
A foundation of public choice theory in favor of smaller
units of government to deliver services effectively
enhances competition, people's preference, and local
voice. Tiebout (1956) argued that greater fragmentation of
government into smaller units increases competitive pres-
sure. Instead, it makes sense to propose that competitively
contracting out of corporate services directly to a private
sector provider will yield a progressive effect on perfor-
mance, as competitive setting energies mean greater effi-
ciency (Savas, 2000). The ruling party NRM has always
argued in line with public choice theory to multiply dis-
tricts in Uganda, and Green (2010) argued that the multi-
plication of districts is for patronage other than service
delivery improvement.
Practice contradicted theory when the new system of
administration was implemented. Precisely, when national
governments think of efficiency and effectiveness in service
delivery, they tend to forget local preference, representation,
local voice, and social equity (Norman-Major, 2011). The
contradiction will wash away the wins of decentralization
system achieved over time, that is, local ideas, community
mobilization, sustainable community evolution, team work,
extended autonomy, center expansion, and sense of belong-
ing. Forced recentralization always leaves behind sentiments
of bad feelings among communities. The best approach was
no-cost-power sharing that would end up in a win­win situa-
tion between central government and the local elites
(Mawhood, 1993)--but leaders have always forgotten the
mistakes of their predecessors.
Within the developing world, devolution of official power
to municipal councils has become a key success factor in
states such as Chile, Letelier and Sáez (2006); South Africa,
Heymans (2006); Indonesia, Eckardt and Shah (2006). For
Uganda's neighbors, the city of Dar es Salam in Tanzania is
still operating a decentralized system with three operating
metropolises under Dar es Salam city council with elected
representatives, and on the contrary, Nairobi in Kenya is still
following an inherited centralized system from the British
though doing better than Uganda and Tanzania--Kenyan
government in 2008 was named as an African world class
metropolitan area (Government of Kenya, 2008).
Post-Recentralization
Following the enactment of the KCC Act (GOU, 2010), it
became clear that management needed to develop a new
organizational structure that seeks to reposition the authority
and deliver quality services to the people of Kampala.
The serious questions among scholars are what is to be
fixed in Kampala and how it can be done? There was need to
fix garbage, potholes, sewer services, construction, traffic
management, corruption, health services, environment, stray
livestock, and management of markets. The KCCA Act was
passed in parliament where NRM has the majority members,
which was the first step toward loss of objectivity.
The final decision to recentralize can be described in three
traditions: consolidation of power, the deteriorating party's
political self-governance, and nervousness of the magnitude
of independence in the decentralized system. Academicians
continue to challenge explanations put forward by central
government as arguments for reform. Section 16 subsection
3(f) of the KCCAAct, offers for appointed standing commit-
tees whose responsibility among many is to make reports to
the authority. To date, a lot of issues are pending following the
mayor's removal from office after rejection of court order, as
Muhumuza (2008) argued that NRM always uses corruption
tendencies as a stooge to accomplish its political intentions.
Academicians continue to argue that NRM is no longer
popular like it was in the 1980s and 1990s. Devolution as a
system of government was identified as remarkable among
developing nations (Steiner, 2006) for two reasons: first,
people were very royal to the one party system at that time
(Makara, Rakner, & Svåsand, 2009) and second, local elites
werewillingtonegotiatewithcentralgovernment(Mawhood,
1993), which is not the case today after NRM opened the
political space for other political parties. It can be recalled
that the former minister Jabeli Bidandi Ssali lost his ministe-
rial job for requesting President Museveni to open up the
political planetary. It is due to the ongoing competition in
the political market that that ruling party has realized that the
democratic means through decentralized approach has turned
out to be unfair to them, hence the justification for reform to
consolidate power. One of the councilors from JEEMA party
was quoted having said that
The city was recentralized because undoubtedly it is associated
to uncertainties around the elections results in Kampala,
numerous influential NRM bureaucrats condemning residential
district commissioners, chief administrative officers NRM chair
persons at the sub counties for being multiparty sympathizers
and do not deserve those positions.
In the comprehensive jeopardy to reduce election mislays,
the president is quoted to have urged the electorates to vote
8 SAGE Open
only those candidates who subscribe to NRM party (Awortwi,
2011). The NRM philosophy does not mainly look at the per-
son and their contribution but just a mere subscription and
loyalty to the party. The staff from ministry of public service
in favor of centralization argued,
Indeed recentralization has separated power (administration)
from politics. It is not good to give elected positions a lot of
power because many things will not work. Voters tend to make
elected persons "vote slaves" through making decisions that
favor them [majority voters] because of a mere vote.
The staff from ministry of local government debated that
in the previous Local Government Act, laws were intended to
give elected persons a lot of powers while in the new KCCAAct,
the intention is to reduce political power of those elected in
order to improve service delivery. After all the past mayors
failed to perform, they did not have capacity and therefore they
were not qualifying for the position. He continued to justify why
there was need for change in the laws which can be termed as;
"the jealous mistress law."
The staff from ministry of health discussed that
the elected leaders always compromise especially for the
majority so that they can be re-elected given that majority of
people in Kampala are poor, they tend to trade along road
reserves which are not right places hence promoting trade
disorder that the opposition tried to take advantage of like the
Kampala mayor.
The health ministry staff continued to argue that
the decentralization system of government is still good but it
was inevitable for government to recentralize for only the capital
city since it proved a failure in terms of changing the face of
Kampala and it was done for the electorate in terms of value for
money.
The senior members in KCCA said that
even the blind can see that there is tremendous improvement in
the city in terms of garbage collection, clean roads, street lights,
and infrastructure development [road construction], trade order
and corruption has reduced in the authority because of reduction
in powers of the mayor and appointing a strong leader (executive
director).
From the above testimonials, one would not be wrong to
assume that, although central government management bar-
gains openly to fund and support a decentralization policy,
they do not have the desire to realize local institutional evo-
lution as it is said that "absolute power corrupts absolutely."
The decentralized system will only be effective if govern-
ment has a stake to bargain for what is good for them
(Mawhood, 1993).
How Recentralization of Kampala City
Undermined Bottom Accountability?
Accountability basically means upholding truthfulness and it
grips assured anticipations on what the individual or institu-
tion must be capable and appreciative to clarify, substantiate,
and own change for what they are assigned to do (Cooper &
Owen, 2007). Entitlement to the answerableness element,
this is where the designate draws much from the principal­
agent theory between correspondence among the principal
and the agent (Laffont & Martimort, 2009). The agent is
mandated to implement some services in the interests of the
other party--the principal, who assumes delegation of some
distinct and decision-making power.
The difficulties painted by the agency model are that,
there will repeatedly be a discrepancy between the genuine
resolutions made by go-betweens (agents) and the resolu-
tions that would exploit the principal's paybacks. This devia-
tion arises because when making a decision, agents too
pursue to exploit their individual self-seeking.
This usually rises among procurement bureaucrats and
elected representatives Ross (1973). This happened in for-
mer KCC and cannot be ruled out in the current KCCA as it
is said "every rose has its thorn." Recentralization of the
Kampala city has seemingly slammed on accountability in
local governments in four major ways: change in power and
control, dual reporting lines, style and loyalty of top manage-
ment in KCCA, and incapacitated politically elected mayors
and councilors. Rendering to the KCC Act that President
Yoweri Museveni endorsed on December 28, 2010, the
authority substituted the council and willpower contained
parallel elected councilors as provided for in the prior
structure.
Change in Power and Control
This is usually represented by flow chart. The office of the
executive director is different from that of the mayor and the
mayor reports to both the minister of local government and
the executive director KCCA, whereas the executive director
reports to the minister for Kampala and president. This has
lessened the span of control and led to over-supervision of
the mayor. Yet, he represents the electorate and is account-
able to them, but his position has been made ceremonial,
hence tying the hands of the headship of the council in
Kampala. Devolution is left in suspense after shifting overall
management of the authority to the executive director. This
deeply explains that the local voice in Kampala is no more
because the resolutions that are passed are not implemented.
Indeed, the table above clearly indicates that the political
wing has been sidelined, eroded, destroyed and the mayor has
no powers to provide political guidance, oversight to the
authority, and monitor the conveyance of amenities to the
populace. Neither does his office seek to champion collabora-
tive engagement, advocacy, and accountability, and promote
Madinah et al. 9
the welfare and quality services to the people of Kampala nor
can he implement his manifesto.
The core functions have been considered directly as pro-
vided for in the KCCAAct (GOU, 2010), but there is need to
re-define the roles and provide a better position to enable
him become accountable to the electorate through verifiable
outputs. Deputy mayors from JEEMA, FDC, DP, and some
senior administrative staff in KCCA against the recentraliza-
tion of Kampala city continued to argue that
we are in a tricky situation since all the political powers that
belonged to mayors and councilors have been given to one
person but such circumstances have their own consequences. A
lot of money has been disseminated to implement various
projects. How is that money being spent, what happens to
councilors'and mayors'oversight roles? There is need to amend
the Act to enable elected mayors and councilors advise on the
focus priorities. It is very hard for us to assess such projects
since everything is in the hands of one person.
Similarly, the new law puts parallel lines of responsibility
which leads to conflicts such as, who heads the authority?
What are the roles, of both the executive director and mayor
ahead of the authority in evolving policies and plans for the
growth of the city (see Table 2). Unclear roles have however
affected the relationship between the two managers hence
hindering service delivery.
The bickering in KCCA is a clear indication of difficulties
in conflicting roles and different channels of reporting for the
same institution to both managers, which has left loyalty of
the mayor in balance. It is unclear on whether to bend on the
side of the electorate or central government while stabilizing
the loyalty of the executive director to central government or
the electorate. The mayor and deputy mayors in spite of the
political party on the aspect of conflicting roles and presenta-
tion of KCCA reasoned that
the confusion and conflict results from lack of involvement of
all stake holders in decision making. Kampala budget is passed
without the input of mayors and councilors. There is a problem
in monitoring, implementation and projections. By letting this
confusion continue, they are bringing the political role down.
The deputy mayor in one of the divisions under NRM
party claimed that
infrastructure development in Kampala started in areas like
Nakasero where the rich people stay, of course 5% elite are
happy but man does not live on bread alone. People need
involvement and their views should be represented for the
effectiveness of the new Act.
He continued with the dispute that
KCCA is busy organizing carnivals which are not a priority for
the city, who are they doing it for? Schools are still in a sorry
state, drainage in slums is still horrible and there is no medicine
in health centers. Mobilizing people for one day to eat and dance
and the next day they go on empty stomachs does not fix the
problems of Kampala.
There is uniform service delivery in Kampala where each
division is a mirror of the other in terms of services and bud-
get allocations. Because there is need for a two-way process,
which allows feedback and feed forward to take place in all
lines of authority, transparency should be emphasized in its
reporting style or else the KCCA administrators run the pos-
sibility of being unsociable to the electorate, ambiguous or
broad, and getting out of trace with those for whom they are
responsible.
The senior members in KCCA maintained that
the proposed amendments of the KCCA Act according to the
Minister for Kampala at the National Leadership Institute,
Kyankwanzi on 15th February 2014 where it is proposed there
be separation of politics and administration, governance
restructuring and review of Kampala boundaries, reduce powers
of councils.
Policy amendments should be done carefully and for the
benefit of social equity if we have not forgotten that "man
proposes but God disposes." Policy suggestions in the find-
ings of this study are on unpremeditated confusion and con-
flicts in the authority for allegiance can be a starting point in
the future debate for the amendments of the KCCA Act that
should be done carefully after investigation, evaluation, and
involvement of all stake holders to enable clarity of roles to
avoid, "missing the wood for the trees."
Recentralization of the city became inevitable because all
circumstances had caused public outcry in terms of service
for which the government planned through knockback to
support prior administrators. Decentralization policy in the
country has been too ambitious and creating many districts
results into over-dependency, hence making the policy vague
because two systems are being run concurrently in KCCA
and one would be right to believe that indeed decentraliza-
tion is dead.
Restricted Power for Political Wing in KCCA
The reform through centralization has deprived elected poli-
ticians, noticeably the diminished mechanism of democracy
in favor of top management in KCCA. Mayors and council-
ors are conflicting with current top management of KCCA
because they have observed that the reforms have underpriv-
ileged them of their controls and influences, elected leaders
confirmed this. Although the mayor is answerable to the
executive director, he is not involved in day-to-day adminis-
tering of the authority and he cannot question.
Some division councilors are excited because the resource
envelope increased due to increased revenue collection and
under such circumstances, a group of councilors are excited,
that is, 20% of revenue collection determines how much
10 SAGE Open
councilors will take home, hence splitting in ideology. In
divergence, prior to recentralization period, the mayor was
the top administrator of KCC whereas division councils had
versed powers although take home was less because revenue
collection was a challenge in the city at that time.
In the present legal framework, the mayors and councilors
are not fully involved in the operational administration of the
city. It is on this basis that the political wing of KCCA cur-
rently feels that the top administration has suspended them
because their roles have been transferred rendering them
destroyed in their political career as the DP, FDC, and
JEEMA councilors continued to say that, "All bodies like
city physical planning authority (CPPA) and public accounts
committee (PAC) are not in place to date, which makes divi-
sions non-serviceable."
The opposition councilors continued to defend their posi-
tions by saying that
as divisions political heads, chance has not been given to us to
budget and assess the performance of the financial plan since
the top administration in KCCA decided to keep us [mayors and
councilors] jobless. The town clerk, who is hypothetically a sub
accounting officer at the division, is jobless, she cannot report
quarterly reviews. All roles are done by the executive director.
The councilors of the opposing political parties, that is, DP,
FDC, and JEEMA, continued to say that "there is a `quasi-
town clerk'. Who (town clerks) knows nothing concerning
how much income tax is collected and spent at the sub-county.
There is lack of `rationalized process of operation.'" In the
same view, one of the deputy mayors from NRM party contin-
ued to support the argument that
presently, the Local Government Financial Regulations Act
1997 is operational, a similar sequence where the sub-counties
are obliged to subscribe to the authority grant development
before it is deliberated at the authority level, then sent to the
centre for execution. The corresponding division committees
need to deliberate the budget proposals. Regrettably, this has
certainly not occurred. Our (Councils) participation in the
budget [production development] is negligible.
The deputy mayors in spite of the political party main-
tained that
at the start of 2011/2012 financial year, we were in harmony
with the executive director, as divisions we were working in
peace with the authority but the last two years (she) has been
implementing her personal plans with her mechanical team and
she has had these plans executed by them . . . councils cannot
even explain.
The deputy mayors continued to argue that
for council meetings, occasionally she attends but if she is not
interested, she delegates and from time to time she does not even
send a representative. This may imply that whatever councils are
discussing is not important since it is never implemented. The
money that was on division accounts was removed with no
report on how it was spent, we now operate a central account as
KCCA with no supervision.

Conclusion
Evidence indicates that recentralization reform is significant
for the political survival of the NRM regime in power. Yet, it
should go further than the national party leadership and
embrace the involvement of local players as Grossman and
Lewis (2014) put it that, the president receives a significant
electoral boost for allowing the creation of new districts. From
the late 1990s, through the CDS, there have been premedi-
tated, planned, and protected efforts by the state to negate
some of the elements from the decentralization policy.
This research has revealed the negative impact of recen-
tralization of Kampala city on accountability to the elector-
ate, yet this is among the major considerations for
recentralization of KCCA. The panacea for reinforcing
accountability should start by returning the supervisory role
to the elected politicians as a means of ensuring checks and
balances so that the top management can be questioned and
is answerable to the electorate's representatives. However,
central government's reinforcement should be noticeable
including appointment of top management of the authority as
public service representative.
Similarly, accountability in all public service institutions
should be enhanced through power sharing, bargaining with
local elites, consultative amendments of the KCCA Act to
safeguard unfair treatments, that is, removal from office and
enforce balanced policies in favor of social equity.
Decentralized political process needs to provide accountabil-
ity to the local populace, and open political participation is
stimulated combined with steady established rules to manage
local affairs.
