Productive measures: Culture and
measurement in the context of
everyday neoliberalism
David Beer
Abstract
This article reflects on how data circulations and data analysis have become a central and routine part of contemporary
life; it does this through the lens of a particular cultural form: the game of football. More specifically, the article focuses
upon the role of data in the production and playing of football, with the suggestion that forms of measurement and
pattern recognition are now central to the performance of footballers and the recruitment and organization of squads.
The article reflects on what this case study reveals about the implications of data, metrics and analytics for contemporary
culture and suggests that we can use examples like football to see how embedded these data-processes are in the social
world. This article presents the concept of productive measures as one means for analysing such developments.

Culture, data, neoliberalism, Big Data, measurement, circulations
There has been much talk recently of `Big Data' and its
implications for both social research and for the social
world itself ­ this is understandable given the scale of
the rhetoric and the potency of their imagined implica-
tions (for a definition and outline of the Big Data
phenomenon see Kitchin, 2014: 67­80). This Big Data
is imagined as both a source of renewed possibility for
social researchers and the basis upon which the very
fabric of the social world is being reconfigured. In the
latter of these cases, Big Data can potentially be seen to
be central to the workings of contemporary capitalism
and, possibly, as a resource, facilitator and mechanism
for the spread of what Brenner et al. (2010) refer to as
the processes of `neoliberalization'. Big Data provides
the measures by which competition and markets can
unfold. Against this backdrop, this article attempts to
see Big Data as an established and integrated part of
contemporary culture. Such an approach allows us to
explore the ways in which these data are already play-
ing a part in shaping and defining the social world.
That is to say, this article is concerned with how
deeply embedded digital data already are in systems
of measurement, in social ordering and in the perform-
ance of the social world.
When we pause to look closely it is possible to reveal
this vast interweaving of new types of data within the
fabric of social processes. This article takes an ordinary
part of popular culture, football, and shows how new
forms of data have steadily redefined this particular
game. Rather than seeing this as a sudden rupture or
moment of change, this example is telling of a longer
scale shift in the use of metrics in sport and the more
general reliance upon statistics and probability calcula-
tions in the `taming of chance' (Hacking, 1990). As I
will describe, these explorations do not suggest that
metrics have suddenly become a central part of culture,
rather it suggests that what we are seeing is an intensi-
fication of processes that have a long history. Through
football, as a global sport played and watched by mil-
lions, we might then begin to see just how significant
these apparently new types of `big' or by-product data

might be for culture on a larger scale. That is to say that
we might see how Big Data, as it is now most often
referred to, is not something out-there but is instead,
inherently, an established presence in our everyday cul-
tural lives. Alongside this, football is a useful example for
two further reasons. First, it is data heavy in the way it
has come to be run and consumed, so it gives us a sort of
archetypal cultural data assemblage with which to work.
Second, the mass-consumption of football, through and
within its changing infrastructures, allows us to explore
how consumer capitalism is being reshaped by data and
how this translates directly into everyday experiences.
We might begin by suggesting that football, as a
contemporary cultural form, exemplifies a kind of
`everyday neoliberalism' (Mirowski, 2013). In his key
book on the survival of neoliberal political formations
after the global economic crisis, Philip Mirowski argues
that part of the reason for the endurance of neoliberal-
ism is its embeddedness in the everyday. Mirowski's
work is highly historically sensitive so this should not
be read as being neoliberalism's unexpected or sudden
moment of glory, rather Mirowski is situating everyday
neoliberalism in a history of political governance which
he argues is now so embedded that it has seeped into
the everyday. Mirowski (2013: 154) points to the
importance of our `brushes with neoliberalism on a
granular scale'. From this perspective the everyday is
infused with neoliberalism. Mirowski (2013: 89) argues
that `a kind of ``folk'' or ``everyday'' neoliberalism has
sunk so deeply into the cultural unconscious that even a
few rude shocks can't begin to bring it to the surface
long enough to provoke discomfort'. For Mirowski
there is no single market or notion of competition
that becomes dominant, but rather neoliberalism is
translated into everyday practices and notions of self.
As such, Mirowski (2013) suggests that we should
attempt to understand the `contours of neoliberal con-
sciousness' and that we should `explore the accretion of
neoliberal attitudes, imaginaries, and practices that
have come to inform everyday life' (pp. 91­92).
The discussions offered in this article have a kind of
subtext: the focus is upon the role of data, metrics and
analytics in culture: but in the background this article
can also be read as an attempt to explore the `contours'
of `everyday neoliberalism' as they play out in particu-
lar social spheres and as systems of measurement and
competition become a routine part of everyday atti-
tudes, imaginaries and practices. In other words, we
have the complex history of neoliberalism (see Gane,
2014) in its various ongoing uneven and specific `recon-
structions' (Peck, 2010: 6) running alongside the history
of the emergence of `statistical thinking' (Porter, 1986)
in culture and sport.
As this would suggest, and although it is sociologic-
ally interesting in its own right, this article is centrally
concerned with football only in so far as it allows us to
understand the role of these new types of digital by-
product data and their wider implications for culture.
Its value as a case study is in allowing us to see the
circulations of these data and to understand how new
forms of measurement and calculation are now inte-
grated into, or will come to be integrated into, everyday
cultural experiences. Matthew Fuller, Lisa Adkins and
Celia Lury (2012: 6) have claimed that data `surpluses
are routinely harvested and put to work in new ways,
including in novel forms of value creation'. They con-
tinue by arguing that `rather than being inert or dead,
in the contemporary social world data is brought into
existence as active or ``alive''' (Adkins and Lury, 2012:
6). Indeed, it has been suggested that there is an emer-
gent `politics of circulation' in which data have come to
recursively fold-back into and reconfigure culture
(Beer, 2013). Football is an example that can be used
to, at least partially, make visible this `politics of circu-
lation'. Plus, aside from noting the importance of sport-
ing analogies in neoliberal rhetoric (Davies, 2014: 43) ­
with the league table proving particularly powerful in
affording neoliberal forms of marketised competition
(Gane, 2012: 79) ­ football is an example that illumin-
ates the generation, accumulation, filtering, archiving
and sorting processes of data in different forms and is
therefore suggestive of how the broader social world is
coming to potentially be reworked and reconstituted by
data and metrics. To sensitise us to such processes, and
to enable us to think through the ways in which meas-
urements produce and cajole as well as capture and
envision, this article will begin to develop the concept
of productive measures. This concept considers not just
what can be measured and how, but it can also be used
to reflect upon how these systems are presented, mar-
keted and understood. The concept of productive meas-
ures is aimed at understanding the exchanges between
emergent systems of measurement and the neoliberal
attitudes, imaginaries and practices to which
Mirowski refers.
Productive measures
It may seem odd to suggest that the way that culture
is produced, or in this case the way a sport is played,
can be reshaped and reworked by data. In fact we can
place such an argument within a long tradition of
work on the history of statistics; in his influential
work in this area, for example, Ian Hacking (1990)
talks about statistics and classifications `making
people up'. This broad line of argument is also actu-
ally entirely in keeping with much of the most reveal-
ing recent work on digital or Big Data. Data and
analytics are often understood to be powerful in
enacting or constituting the social world. This core
2 Big Data & Society
premise has been argued in a variety of ways. There is
a sense that there is an ontological shift at play as
data and analytics become a central part of the func-
tioning of the social. Louise Amoore's recent book is
one particular highlight. In this text, Amoore
explores the way that notions or visions of what is
possible come to shape preemptive decision-making
processes ­ here we find a break from the earlier work
on probability in the move to understand how metrics
predict possible outcomes. Amoore (2013: 9, italics in
the original) describes her book in the following
terms:
The specific modality of risk that I address in the
chapters that follow has an anticipatory logic: it acts
not strictly to prevent the playing out of a particular
course of events on the basis of past data tracked for-
ward into probable futures but to preempt an unfolding
and emergent event in relation to an array of possible
projected futures. It seeks not to forestall the future via
calculation but to incorporate the very knowability and
profound uncertainty of the future into imminent
decision.
Amoore's book is concerned with how data are used
to project imagined futures that are then used to inform
decision-making processes; thus, data and predictive
analytics of different types become a part of practices,
decisions and social outcomes. Again, this is not so
much a rupture as a set of analytic opportunities that
are seen to be found in new types of data. From this
perspective, data analytics do not just shape what is
known, they also shape what is knowable. This is not
about what is probable, but what is possible ­ hence
Amoore talks of `the politics of possibility'.
There are other prominent examples of these types
of constitutive arguments. Scott Lash (2007), for
instance, has argued for the role of data and algorithms
in new types of, what he calls, `post-hegemonic' power.
Elsewhere, in geography, Kitchin and Dodge (2011)
have built a persuasive case for the centrality of data
and code in the functioning of contemporary `code/
space', with software modelling shaping social out-
comes and ordering practices. Adrian Mackenzie
(2006) and others (including Fuller and Goffey, 2012)
have argued for the need for software studies to be part
of broader conceptions of the social world ­ these
include accounts of how software and code come to
order the social in various ways. The list could go on,
but for purposes of brevity we might accept for the
moment that there is an emergent and increasingly
broad interest in the constitutive power of data, software
and analytics.
This wave of interest in the constitutive power of
data, software and code is increasing as it becomes
clear that data are, in a number of ways, central to
the make-up of contemporary social formations of dif-
ferent types. Despite this excellent emergent body of
literature, we are still only at the foothills in our critical
analysis of the role of data in culture and society.
The scale of these changes would appear to far outstrip
the existing analytics; as a result we are likely to feel
that we are playing catch-up. Thanks to the existing
work, and also to other insights into `the social life of
methods' (Ruppert et al., 2013) ­ which argues for an
understanding of how methods and forms of analysis
have moved outside of research practices and into the
social world ­ we are in a position to continue to open-
up these potential social transformations and the impli-
cations of the apparent rise of data and analytics.
As Ajana (2013) has pointed out though, it is not
that these forms of measurement have come from
nowhere. Instead she argues that biometrics of different
sorts have long histories. Ajana suggests that trans-
formations in media and the processes of digitalization
have simply altered the capacity and scope of these
systems of measurement (see also Beer, 2014; Higgins
and Larner, 2010: 14). As Ajana (2013: 21) puts it, we
are actually seeing the `remediation of measure'. Ajana
explains, there is a need:
to challenge the label of newness that is often stapled
on [biometrics] and to draw attention to the fact that
the body has for so long been the subject of control,
measurement, classification and surveillance. The dig-
talisation aspect of biometrics has certainly intensified
such processes and opened up the body to further
dynamics of power and control. (Ajana, 2013: 45)
For Ajana, as a result of a range of developments,
we are seeing an intensification of systems of measure-
ment, yet these systems have a very long genealogy
(see also Crampton and Elden, 2006). Indeed, if we
turn to something like Michel Foucault's 1977­1978
lecture's on Security, Territory, Population (Foucault,
2007) it is clear how historically embedded the connec-
tions are between forms of `calculation', `techniques of
power' and the `art of government'. These connections
feature throughout the lecture series from 1977 to 1978,
but they are dealt with most directly at the beginning
and end of the course ­ most notably in relation to the
use of statistics, measurement and statistical apparatus
in the early lectures and culminating in the final two
lectures with a focus upon questions of competition, the
use of statistics in defining interests and the emergence
of circulation and a `circular ontology' (for a detailed
reading of Foucault's lectures in relation to calculation,
see Elden, 2007). Foucault (2008) notably returns to
and extends these themes in his analysis of the geneal-
ogy of neoliberalism in the following year's lecture
Beer 3
course on biopolitics. What we are dealing with here
then has both a technical and political history (which
has been elaborated in terms of population metrics
by Ruppert, 2011). At the same time though, new
possibilities and opportunities are emerging for the
integration and expansion of such techniques and inter-
ests as a consequence of some key changes in the infra-
structures and mediation of everyday life. When
thinking of productive measures then, we are thinking
of the intensification of systems of measurement along
with the rise of powerful data infrastructures and the
constitutive and productive power that these systems of
measurement might have for the way that the social is
performed. These productive measures do not emerge
from nowhere; we would expect them to be situated in
this technical and social history of emergence and
intensification. To add to this, if we combine the
noted observations about the constitutive power of
data and data analytics together with conceptions of
neoliberal governance then we have a pressing and
potentially profound cocktail of developments with
which to concern ourselves.
Football, data and metrics: Playing
games through data
In the case of football the constitutive powers of data
are highly visible. Even tuning in to a football phone-in
or listening to the commentary on a game we are pre-
sented with innumerous examples of statistical think-
ing. Metrics and statistical insights filter into the way
the game is talked about and reveal a type of everyday
neoliberalism that has sunken into this popular cultural
form. The way the game is discussed and presented is
now very stats heavy, from the mistakes made or cau-
tions handed out by referees to the historical and
comparative performance of managers and on to the
tracking of players' actions and movements. The cover-
age of football and its discourse are full of metric based
differentiations ­ and, of course, football is not the only
sport that is like this. The game of football is undoubt-
edly changing as a consequence of the presence and use
of data. The influences take numerous forms. The way
that metrics influence how the game is understood in
turn fold-back into fan reactions and organizational
decisions in quite complex and interwoven feedback
loops. Data are game changers. What is most difficult
to appreciate is how data are used, like catalysts, in
recursive and recombinant processes and systems.
Data are drawn from the game, which then informs
how the game is played and consumed, which then
finds its way into the data, and so on. . .
To give some sense of the scale and embedded role of
data analysis in the performance of football, we can
turn first to the structures of the clubs themselves.
Just by way of an opening illustration, if we begin
with the top four teams as they finished in the top
division in England in the previous season we find
that all four clubs have embedded teams of data ana-
lysts in their coaching set-ups.1 The club staff profiles
show that these individuals and departments play a cen-
tral part within the clubs' organisation and coaching,
often catering for first team coaching through to their
youth academies. Frequently, these public profiles link
data analytics with performance management and team
improvement. I will speak about the data analysis
company Prozone in a moment, but, as an example,
one of the top four clubs employed a former Prozone
employee for their own in-house data analysis. Another
club had a performance analysis department, with the
express purpose of using statistics to shape team per-
formance. This club even hosted a series of videos of
this data analysis department in action, showing how
they used statistics before, during and after games in
order to refine performance. Half-time even provided
opportunities for the data analysis to be a real-time part
of the game as it unfolded, with interactive white-
boards used to communicate the analysis to the players.
The videos show how players are given the analysis and
how they then use it to shape their performance, with
one player commenting on how he discovers whether or
not he has played well from the post-match statistics.
Indeed, the remaining two clubs both had dedicated
teams of performance analysts. The exact role of
these analysts was less clear for one club but was
more visibly integrated into the coaching techniques
of the other. In this later case there was a team of
analysts with defined roles and management structure.
There is even a notable visual dimension to the ana-
lytics, with statistics often used alongside video ­ and
with one club even employing a specialist in visualiza-
tion to enable the data to be used in different visual
forms. Smartboards, iPads and other devices were
used to provide the players and managers with key ana-
lytics and the means for their communication.
All of the top four teams had data analytics built
into their coaching structures, and all made this visible
through their public profiles ­ with one club even show-
ing exactly how these analytics were used. Data
analytics are not just a part of the actual set-up of
these clubs, they are also a part of how they publicly
present themselves. It would seem that they aim to be
seen to be cutting-edge in their use of analytics. It is
important to add though that data analytics are not
simply the domain of top-level elite clubs. The pattern
continues for other smaller clubs, albeit on an appar-
ently different scale. Selecting two teams from the
fourth tier of English football, based upon their
being located in areas where the author has lived,
both clubs had performance analysts included in their
4 Big Data & Society
coaching staff,2 one of which was expressly involved in
using statistics and data to aid team performance.
Across the sector it would seem that the role of such
analysts is to `boost . . . competitive performance', a role
that Will Davies (2014: 67) suggests is typical of organ-
izations that are defined by the conditions of neoliberal
competition.
On top of this, and extending the reach of such
metricisation beyond professional football, items such
as Adidas' trackable football boots mean that anyone
owning such an item can become their own football
performance data analyst as the `quantified self'
(Lupton, 2013) combines with the codified `permeable
logject' (Dodge and Kitchin, 2009). Similarly, football
data sites, such as StatsBomb, provide the means for
fans to also be data analysts themselves.
StatsBomb.com provides data analysis insights of dif-
ferent types through its group of analysts and writers.
The site provides a range of data analytics; these
include visualisations of individual players' perform-
ances across a range of core metrics (such as goal
conversion rates, through balls, the number of times
they were dispossessed and so on). There are also
dynamic maps that show the movement of players
during matches; here players are represented by dots
that move around the pitch and as they are involved
in the play the size of the dot increases.The glossary of
StatsBomb's data shows that they also use metrics ran-
ging from shot dominance, shooting accuracy through
to assists and other more complex statistics about the
performance of the defence that takes account of ball
possession. This would seem to be an invite to play with
the data and to be your own analyst.
The above is suggestive of the influence of data in the
organisation of football clubs and team performance,
but what about its influence on the players themselves?
This is a more difficult territory to explore, and I will
only touch upon it in this article, but we can turn here
for some sense of the possibilities to the Secret
Footballer, an anonymous professional footballer
who writes for The Guardian newspaper. In an article
published in The Guardian on 13 April 2012, the Secret
Footballer spoke of his experiences of data in the game.
He began by linking the changes he had seen in football
with those that had already taken place in baseball:
The Moneyball philosophy first used by the Oakland A's
general manager Billy Beane is the study of a set of under-
estimated statistics that are then used to find undervalued
baseball players in the transfer market. Soccernomics, the
football equivalent, is the analysis of a similar set of num-
bers used to give teams a competitive edge.
The well-known Moneyball philosophy is based
upon using data to find and uncover what is
understood to be hidden value. The idea being that
players who are either undervalued or who will come
to have value later in their careers can be identified
early on and thus traded below their market rate.
This approach uses whatever metrics are available,
which has drastically escalated in recent years, to illu-
minate potential value (with the speed of decision-
making being crucial, as with the velocity of high
speed trading described by Mackenzie, 2014). The
result is that decision-making processes are altered by
the presence of data. The sense is that data can be used
to inform decisions and that this is seen to be a more
objective and analytically accurate approach to deci-
sion-making. In other words, there is a sense that redu-
cing the need for human intuition, discretion and
agency can lead to decision-making being more accur-
ate and value-generating. There is a faith here in the
numbers, or as Theodor M Porter (1995: 8) has put it, a
`trust in numbers' and `faith in objectivity'. Here we see
the conditions in which such faith and trust are able to
thrive. Indeed, a recent discussion of the role of data in
football on BBC radio 5Live on 2 February 2015
revealed some further details of the integration of
data in the life of the footballer. The discussion,
which involved two recently retired players and one
current player, revealed some of the ways in which
the presence of metrics shaped players' behaviours. It
was suggested that players play the game in order to
improve the metrics and that there was something of a
burgeoning obsession with performance metrics. The
pass completion static in particular was noted as
being important, with players choosing safe short
passes in order to increase pass completion statistics.
Similarly, it was suggested that what was described as
an `intensity' measure ­ which related to prolonged
sprints ­ was also a particularly prominent stat and
something of a bugbear that could be manipulated by
certain movements on the pitch. An existing football
coach suggested that data analysts had a powerful
role in decision-making practices in many clubs, with
their analysis being used to make decisions about team
selection and the like.
Similarly, the Secret Footballer continued by
describing how this type of metric-based approach
and philosophy had come to shape the game they are
part of:
When Liverpool failed in a bid for Gae
¨ l Clichy, it was
reported that Comolli turned to Jose
´ Enrique after dis-
covering that his statistical figures were far more
impressive than Liverpool's scouting report suggested.
He was also much cheaper than Clichy in terms of the
transfer fee and salary. What stood out about Jose
´
Enrique, supposedly, was that he had one of the highest
pass completions and entries into the final third; he
Beer 5
could also be credited with having a direct hand in
many of Newcastle's goals.
Again, this description illustrates how data became
central to highlighting perceived value and in decision-
making. In this case, the data used came to influence
the players who made-up a particular squad. The use of
metrics in this case led directly to an alteration in play-
ing staff. One player was seen in a new light as a result
of data about pass completion rates, field position and
so on. In a separate instance, the Arsenal manager
Arsene Wenger admitted that statistics were used in
the decision over the transfer of Gabriel Paulista
(Pitt-Brooke, 2015). It is interesting to note that the
interview about the Paulista transfer reveals that the
quality of the statistics was important but only in so
far as they reinforced the `eye' of the coaches. It is
interesting to note too, alongside my earlier observa-
tions about the coaching structure of leading football
clubs, that Arsenal have been reported to have
purchased a data analysis company in 2012 (Hytner,
2014) ­ the descriptions of the analytics offered by it
suggest that the analysis is taken beyond things like
goal assists to see if the pass was accurate enough
that the player receiving it did not have to break
stride and so on. Here we have data directly shaping
a financial decision, with economic consequences,
and also directly shaping the game itself. Data analysis
here is used to find what is understood to be hidden
value and to exploit it for market position and a com-
petitive edge.
The above is suggestive of how data are used in the
transfer business; the Secret Footballer also suggests
that these data are used to shape gameplay itself. In
this case, data about football are used to inform how
players are coached and ultimately to reinforce or
change playing practices ­ with echoes of my earlier
observations made about analysts in coaching staff
structures. As the Secret Footballer describes, `[i]n
open play, a huge amount of study, from my own
experience at clubs, is devoted to the calculation of
what are described as final third entries, penalty box
entries and regains of the ball in the final third'. In
this case, data extracted from football games are used
to explore what is successful. Then the patterns that
represent success are used to coach and shape playing
practices. The direct aim is no longer to score a goal,
for example, but instead players are coached to aim for
a certain number of passes or final third entries.
Defensively they might be coached to head the ball to
certain places from crosses and so on. The result is that
players' behaviours are directly shaped by the data
and their uses, sometimes based on the team-play and
other times on individual practices. The picture is of a
game that is managed, and sometimes potentially
micromanaged, by metrics. Players are coached to
follow the patterns of success that are found in the
data. The coverage does not end there, with further
indications that teams are seen to be drawing widely
upon expanding data sets (Hudson, 2013; Siu, 2013) ­
with some even asking if the human agency involved in
football club decision-making might be usurped by
those with the skills to find patterns in Big Data
(Lee, 2014). Of course, not all clubs will be run or
coached in the same way; there is likely to be resistance
or defence of values, as with Wenger's assertion of the
role of the `eye' in decision-making, but this gives a
sense of the scale of influence that data have in the
production of a football matches. Playing the game, it
would seem, is about playing the stats. This leads us to
consider the scale of the data assemblage in football
and the industry of analytics that has emerged.
Productive measures in organisations
and structural decision-making
The above is suggestive of just how deeply this particu-
lar cultural form is implicated by the presence of data
and analytics ­ which in turn is suggestive of how
metrics and biometrics are intensified by digitalisation
processes (as discussed by Ajana, 2013). We can use this
as the base from which to observe the broader industry
of analytics that has emerged in football. Indeed, the
presence of the data solutions industry in sport offers
further insight into the intensification of the role of
metrics in culture. Returning to the central themes of
this article, what is interesting here is not just the data
assemblage itself but how it is described, marketed and
presented.
We can begin with the Football consultancy
company Soccernomics. This particular organisation
is illustrative of the broader emergence of an industry
of data analytics and data solutions (see Beer, 2013:
101­121). Soccernomics, who use the tagline
`Consultancy, Research, Ideas', describe their practices
as follows:
We use data analysis to help clubs and national feder-
ations improve performance and save money. By finding
hidden truths in the numbers, we can determine which
players and coaches are over-performing, helping your
club find value in recruitment. Our penalty analysis,
based on game theory, has been used in FA Cup,
Champions League and World Cup finals. (taken from
http://www.soccernomics-agency.com/ November 2013)
Reflecting the Moneyball approach, here we can see
directly how data and analysis are being presented to
football clubs and how the options they offer might be
deployed. Data analysis here is depicted as the means
6 Big Data & Society
by which greater efficiency might be achieved. It is
presented as the means by which performance is
improved whilst efficiency also increases (echoing the
use of a `performativity' equation as a legitimising
tool as described by Lyotard, 1979). In this instance,
data analysis is charged with finding `hidden truths',
which might then expose where value is to be found.
Again, we have the sense that data analysis has the
capacity to reveal patterns or forms of knowledge
that are not possible with human agency alone. Also
here we see that decision-making is intended to be
swayed and shaped by data analysis ­ which player,
which coach, how to take penalties, and so on. The
image produced is the one in which data analysis tran-
scends the capacities of individuals and provides new
types of agency that can be called upon to get decisions
right (potentially in self-reinforcing ways).
Soccernomics though does not represent an isolated
example, far from it. Perhaps a better-known example
in terms of the media coverage it has received over the
last decade is Prozone. According to their marketing
materials at the end of 2013, Prozone were:
Established in the UK in 1998, Prozone have been
pioneering the use of performance analysis in football
for over a decade and in that time we've worked with
some of the leading coaches in the world of sport. We
now have offices in the USA, Spain, UAE, India and
Japan and offer the world's leading performance ana-
lysis service.
Here we get an impression of both the length of time
in which data analysis has been finding its way into
football and also the apparent global spread of such
practices. Again, their accounts of their services focus
upon the potential for enhanced decision-making and
for finding patterns in data that lead to improved per-
formance and greater efficiency.
Similarly, from the 2013 marketing materials,
Prozone claim that:
From the flexibility offered by our real-time, self coding
analysis products to the depth and accessibility of infor-
mation delivered by our post-match and opposition ana-
lysis services, we're constantly breaking new ground and
setting the standard for what can be achieved with
objective and reliable performance insights.
The suggestion here is that there are new develop-
ments and new types of analysis that are being devel-
oped and honed in order for decisions to be more
`objective' and for performance to be more `reliable'.
Such an approach to data and metrics is seen to offer
objective decision-making which outstrips the more
subjective understandings of individuals. As Porter
(1995: 8) has explained, a `decision made by the
numbers . . . has at least the appearance of being fair
and impersonal'. What Katherine Hayles (2006) has
called the `cognisphere' begins to mesh with decision-
making processes and stretch them out across human
and machine agency. We are also presented here with a
version of Louise Amoore's (2013) `politics of possibil-
ity', with data derivatives being used to imagine futures
and make predictions about what will work and what is
possible. In this instance, Prozone are known for offer-
ing football match analysis, for providing visualisations
of games and performance, for tracking players, and
for tracking team and ball movements through games,
which in turn are then analysed in various ways. These
practices and visualisations can be seen then to be
implicated in this `politics of possibility' to which
Amoore refers, with various possible outcomes being
drawn into current decision-making.
To enhance their credentials, and to also illustrate
what a routine part of football data analysis has
become, various endorsements are used in the market-
ing of these data solution services. These include the
current Derby County and former England Manager
Steve McClaren, as well as other international coaches.
For instance, the following endorsement is illustrative
of how Prozone's analytics are now depicted as a rou-
tine part of the game itself:
PROZONE3 is a very useful tool for me and my staff. In
a short space of time I can acquire key statistical infor-
mation on teams and individuals as well as viewing that
of our rival teams. For these reasons Prozone remains a
product that is critical to the work of my team. (Ernesto
Valverde, Former Manager Olympiacos FC, from
Prozone website)
We have to acknowledge that this is an endorsement
taken from the company's own marketing, but it is
nevertheless highly suggestive, along with the earlier
accounts of coaching staff analysts, of how data ana-
lysis is embedded into the practices and production of
football. Alongside this, it is also illustrative of how
data analysis is presented as a norm and as a progres-
sive move in this cultural sector. It indicates an attempt
to present data analysis as a routine part of cultural
production. Data analytics are used in the preparation
for games, in understanding performance, in finding
successful patterns of play, and it is part of how the
team is coached and organised. We see here that data
about football circulates back into the game itself, a
process of data circulation that fits with broader pat-
terns (see Beer, 2013).
As I have already indicated, the influence of data
and analytics is not limited to the patterns of play on
the field. Prozone also provide analytic services for
Beer 7
shaping decision-making around player recruitment,
thus the make-up of the team becomes a product of
data analytics. As they put it, `Prozone RECRUITER
is a game-changing online solution that enables teams
to make considered technical scouting decisions
informed by objective performance information'.
Again, this is promoted as a more `objective' and
detached form of decision-making that sees beyond
the subjective positions of scouts and coaches to
reveal hidden value. Decisions are presented as being
more `considered' and `technical'. This then is illustra-
tive of how these forms of data and metrics are viewed
and how their capacities are understood. The message
is clear, data analytics lead to more objective decision-
making which in turn leads to the discovery of hidden
value, with the result being greater performance and
efficiency.
In August 2014, it was announced that the video
games company Sports Interactive, who are responsible
for the popular Football Manager series of games,
would allow Prozone to use their games database to
inform their actual player scout analytics (BBC,
2014). The database behind these games was seen to
be so accurate that it could be used to inform actual
football transfer activity. Here the consumption of
football in the form of a video game begins to blur
with the actual production of the game itself, with
those playing the game working from the same metrics
as those producing and organizing the actual football
teams and matches ­ which might conjure the image of
a kind of hyperreal `ludodrome' (Atkinson and Willis,
2007). These types of circulations add further complex-
ity to our understanding of how metrics feedback into
the social and cultural world, with consumption and
virtual game play being integrated into systems of foot-
ball production themselves.
Working on a similar time scale, thus suggesting that
the escalation of metrics in sport intensified from the
mid-to-late 1990s onwards, Opta were formed in 1996.3
As well as providing statistics to professional clubs
Opta also provide data services to broadcasters, pub-
lishers, betting companies, sponsors and fans. This
reveals the way that this data solution industry oper-
ates, providing data and data services for a range of
different types of customers. `Finding beauty in the
detail' is Opta's tagline. It is also notable that they pro-
vide these data services for 40 different sports. We see
here the scale of the use of data in culture, which goes
far beyond football and is global in its reach ­ Opta
have 140 employees across 10 countries ­ and weaves
together the interests of bookmakers, fans and com-
mentators as well as those of the actual clubs them-
selves. Again, the clubs are invited to use this data in
`scouting', `recruitment' and `performance' analysis or
to prepare for upcoming opponents. Echoing the types
of services provided by the other providers, Opta
emphasize the scale and detail of their data, which is
described as both `live' and `archived' as well as being
`fast' and `robust'. Indeed, the focus is upon the speed
of the analysis and how comprehensive the archive of
data is. Opta emphasize the `authenticity' and `credibil-
ity' of the data, which is provided in ways that `illumin-
ate' and `inform' or to provide `sensational facts'.
As well as the detail of the data, again the accessibility
of the visualisations is a core component of the services,
with `graphical overviews' and 3D graphics with `vir-
tual angles' all providing users with variegated visual
insights. Again, media companies and football clubs
fans are also invited to be their own analysts and to
use these `immersive' data, with live match day event
centres that are available on mobile phone platforms.
It would seem that data solutions and analytics in the
cultural sphere are deeply embedded in the industry as
a whole.
The types of performance data feeds that Opta pro-
vide gives a sense of the intensity of the data that is
being extracted ­ this simply was not available before
the data assemblage escalated from the late 1990s.4
Opta offer three tiers of performance data feeds; these
vary in their complexity and detail. Across a range of
national football competitions ­ and again it should be
noted that this goes beyond football and into other
sports ­ they capture data on `every on-the-ball con-
tact'. For every `event' they log a series of `descriptors'
that include `pitch co-ordinate, a player and team ref-
erence plus a time stamp'. The result of using these
`variables' is a range of statistics about the game.
Opta suggest that this level of detail means that they
can separate out different `types of pass', tell which
tackles were `goal-saving' or that `regained possession
in the final third'. They can even, they claim, tell what
type of shot has been hit at goal and provide compari-
sons. Clearly then we have here an advanced data
assemblage and analytics industry that intensifies the
presence of metrics in culture, both in terms of its pro-
duction and its consumption (through broadcasters,
print media and even directly to the fans).
Of course, these discussions of metrics in football
force us to ask questions about what might be under-
stood to be the immeasurable parts of football or
aspects of performance that are not easily quantified.
It is possible that the types of performance, practices
and actions that are captured by the data and that are
therefore easily measured are those that then become
valued (Adkins and Lury, 2012: 20; Badiou, 2008: 2). In
others words, the data that are captured define what is
deemed to be of value. Other practices, which may be
successful but are not captured easily by the data, are
then potentially sidelined. We might imagine that there
are some involved in these organisations that would
8 Big Data & Society
resist the usurping of their own intuition in making
such decisions. In his recent autobiography, to pick
an example, the former footballer and manager Roy
Keane (2014) used such systems but raises some ques-
tions about the use of statistics and the limitations they
present for the judgment of coaches and managers,
which is one amongst other indicators of a defence of
human agency in decision-making even if this is ultim-
ately reinforced through metrics. Furthermore, in terms
of a game like football we might wonder how artistry,
creativity, unorthodox play and expressiveness are
measured or factored into such decision-making pro-
cesses. There is no doubt that there are proxies for
such things within these systems of analysis, but it is
unlikely that this is enough for many of the protagon-
ists ­ there is still plenty of scope for seeing how the
extent of the faith in these analytics might vary. This
type of question might be used to open-up what Luigi
Doria has called the `problems of measure' (Doria,
2013: 168) and the issue of `incalculability' (Doria,
2013: 12). Such questions might even be used to explore
the complex relations between `value and values' that
have been reasserted and rearticulated recently by Bev
Skeggs (2014). Football, like other cultural forms, can
be used to explore the tension that Skeggs's levers open,
with value in football, in monetary and organisational
terms, clashing with the values of players and fans,
which are often based around heritage, artistry and
enchantment (elaborated in phrases like ``they play
football the way it should be played'', ``they are a
proper footballing side'', ``x is a cultured player'', ``x
is an old fashioned No.10'', and so on).
Badiou (2008: 2­3) has argued that `number governs
cultural representations' and that it is `in its very
essence that the cultural fabric is woven by number
alone . . . a ``cultural fact'' is a numerical fact'. This
encourages us towards seeing `numbers' as far-reaching
and significant in cultural consumption. Numbers
shape understandings of cultural representations, or
so Badiou's formulation would suggest, and those num-
bers also have the capacity to become facts. We have to
consider how, as with football, culture more broadly is
conceived, as well as produced, through numbers. The
examples I have mentioned intimate outwards towards
the presence of data and metrics, as Badiou hints, as
being woven into the `cultural fabric'. The example of
football presents opportunities for thinking about how
we conceive of culture more broadly through number
and what that means for the things that might go
unknown.
Concluding thoughts
On the surface this article has explored how football is
being reshaped through the presence of a growing data
assemblage and the analytics offered in the form of data
solutions. It focused upon the role of data in the pro-
duction and playing of football, with the suggestion
that forms of measurement and pattern recognition
are now central to the performance of footballers and
the recruitment and organization of squads. Data are
used to create an `information overlay' (Mitchell, 2005)
on the game itself. As in other spheres, we see data
shaping as well as tracking behaviours. I'd like to
begin this brief conclusion by emphasizing that this art-
icle is not just about football, rather it is implicitly
about the wider uses and consequences of emergent
forms of data, measurement and analytics in culture.
The football case study is indicative of broader social
shifts and the rising use of data and metrics in various
social spheres. This is an article about the use of data
and analytics to reshape the performance of the social,
but it is also an article about how metricisation is
described, presented and promoted in the discourse.
What I have found here is that paying attention to a
particular cultural data assemblage and cultural infra-
structure, of which I have only touched the surface,
reveals the way in which data circulate and reshape
organizations, practices, behaviours and perceptions.
As this case study intimates, these forms of data are
already an integrated, immanent and embedded part
of the social world, of our practices and of everyday
cultural engagements. As Adkins and Lury (2012: 15)
have noted, `social scientists are only just beginning to
engage with this emergent political economy of data
including the politics of measurement attached to it'.
And as the case study described here suggests, this is
no longer emergent but routine and embedded. Systems
of measurement are not restricted to football, they are a
growing part of contemporary society (for an account
of this across various social spheres see Higgins and
Lerner, 2010). Football is a useful example because it
is instructive of the processes themselves and how they
might continue to fold-back into the social. The conse-
quences for agency, decision-making, notions of effi-
ciency and the like were framed here in terms of
Mirowski's (2013) notion of `everyday neoliberalism'.
The ideas highlighted through football begin to illumin-
ate significant transformations in how the social world
is organized, structured, ordered and performed
through data and metrics. These transformations
point to this embedded form of everyday neoliberalism,
in both the formation of the data assemblages and how
these technologies fold into culture.
To return to the introduction of this article then,
football provides us with illustrative examples of `the
politics of data circulations' (Beer, 2013). It also pro-
vides further illustration of how data circulations
reshape culture. We can readily see how metrics fold-
back, in feedback loops, reconfiguring the structure and
Beer 9
form of the game itself, whilst also potentially reconfi-
guring how it is consumed. These are large-scale pro-
cesses that have implications for football itself and for
how it is appreciated. This is illustrative of broader
cultural shifts and of the more general reshaping of
everyday life by software, code, algorithms and data
circulations. The job of sociology will be to unpick
and attempt to understand the consequences and
dynamics of these processes as they continue to
unfold across different social spheres. We might try to
locate such systems of measurement, efficiency and
competition within broader political narratives. If we
wish to place cultural forms within such broader con-
cerns we need to begin with the material instantiations
of data, metrics and analytics ­ both in terms of the
technologies and systems of measurement and also in
terms of the types of thinking that encourage their use
and the rhetoric that facilitates their appropriation. To
give one illustration of this, Will Davies (2014: xi) has
argued that `uncertainty . . . is a key concept for neo-
liberalism'. One place to start would be to explore how
a certainty in measurement creates uncertainty in those
being measured.
The developments I have described in this article
are not all new, many are based within a fairly long
history, but as Ajana (2013) has argued, these pro-
cesses are intensifying as a result of digitalization and
some broader cultural shifts towards the perceived
value of data and measurement. These developments
do not just have implications for this one game;
instead these are questions that face the playing and
understanding of the social game more broadly. What
are often referred to as Big Data, or maybe digital
by-product data, are not something that exist outside
of the social world. They circulate through it, reshap-
ing it, altering and disrupting the configurations of
power and decision-making. These new types of
data are an implicit and integrated part of how the
social world is performed and enacted. Football is a
useful example for seeing just how deeply these data
are a part of one particular cultural sphere, but the
implications and questions I have outlined here reach
far beyond football. They are actually, in my view,
some of the most pressing questions that face social
analysis today. The use of metrics in football is a
particularly profound example of the `social life of
methods' (Ruppert et al., 2013), with analytics, visu-
alization and statistical techniques used in the con-
duct and enactment of culture, yet it provides us
with a series of issues and questions that might be
applied to less data-centric cultural forms. I would
like to conclude by briefly reflecting on some of
these issues.
In this article, I have suggested that we can explore
the presence of productive measures. These productive
measures are intensified and have new scales of possi-
bility as a result of the growing data assemblage and
industry of data analytics. Productive measures, we
might conclude, are also responsible for producing as
well as tracking the social. They shape behaviours. As
people are subject to these forms of measurement they
will produce different responses and outcomes, know-
ing, as they often will, what is coming and the way that
their performance will become visible. Culture more
broadly may be subject to the equivalent of the
simple short pass to a fellow player.
Based on the case study used in this article and some
of the points from the key academic literature, we
might draw together some closing observations about
these productive measures. The first is that by thinking
of productive measures we are likely to develop an
interest in revealing the varying extents of the faith
placed in metrics. The extent of this faith in football
and elsewhere is unclear at the moment, but it is clear
that there are perceived values in such metrics
(academics are likely to see a parallel set of experiences
to footballers in this regard, see Burrows, 2012). The
thriving industry of analytics shows that there is some-
thing of a burgeoning faith in numbers in football at
least, if not sport more generally. Second, we can see
that the aim of a productive measure is to locate and
illuminate hidden value, to find things in the data that
cannot be seen otherwise and to exploit them. Metrics
are seen to be productive in this regard, they are seen to
make efficiencies, reveal truths and find value. Third,
and relating to this, productive measures define (as well
as track) what is valued and what are considered
desired behaviours and practices. For the footballer it
might be pass completion or final third entries, or what-
ever the buzz statistic of the day might be, for
academics it might be journal articles in the right
impact-factor journals and so on. By defining what is
possible, data and metrics afford what Louise Amoore
(2009) calls `lines of sight'. As such, and fourth, these
productive measures are likely to set the rules, schema
and frameworks that constrain and contain the social
world. These rules of measurement are likely to be pro-
found and to become the rules of the game itself. As
Rob Kitchin (2014: 127) has noted, `people start to
game the system in rational, self-interested but often
unpredictable ways to subvert metrics, algorithms,
and automated decision-making processes'. Here
though the systems of measurement set the rules for
engagement, even if they are ultimately resisted or sub-
verted. Finally, and by way of summing up, productive
measures exist to enable claims towards strategy, calcu-
lation and risk management. As such they are intended
to limit possibilities and to reduce the chances of error.
They are seen to be objective and are trusted, some-
times and maybe even often ahead of or in conjunction
10 Big Data & Society
with human agency and discretion. I would suggest that
the discussions in this article, and the notion of pro-
ductive measures, would lead us toward these issues
and open them up for further exploration.
In understanding Big Data, or whatever we may wish
to call it, we should begin with these cultural instanti-
ations, such as football, and then develop an under-
standing of the part that they are playing in the
formation of social, political and cultural developments
of different types. As with other neoliberal formations, in
football we can see how the `capacity to quantify, dis-
tinguish, measure and rank' is central to navigating `con-
stant, overlapping competitions' (Davies, 2014: 30). The
cultural data assemblage we have only begun to unravel
here illustrates the scale to which these systems can
measure and rank in multifarious and detailed ways.
Questions of data, metrics, analytics and number in
the cultural sphere are not marginal, rather they are cen-
tral to contemporary cultural formations. This article is
intended to work towards an analysis of culture that
attempts to understand this presence and to place it
within a broader social and political context ­
namely one in which questions of measurement are
tied closely to questions of power and processes of
`variegated neoliberalization' (Brenner et al., 2010).
And more broadly, as Stuart Elden (2006) has demon-
strated through the work of Heidegger, politics,
number, measurement and calculation are deeply inter-
related. Culture, and popular culture, can be found at
the forefront of these developments, both in terms of
the infrastructures and assemblages of data and meas-
urement and as the location of the everyday `brushes'
with neoliberalism that Mirowski (2013) has deftly
opened-up for analysis. Examples of everyday cultural
forms, like football, have the potential to enable a
granular analysis of the measurement and calculation
of life, people and experience. Using Mirowski's (2013:
92) work we can see everyday `neoliberal attitudes,
imaginaries, and practices' in the production of this
global cultural form. These cultural forms, I would
suggest, give us focal points for unravelling and under-
standing the politics of data circulations and the place
of number in contemporary social life.
