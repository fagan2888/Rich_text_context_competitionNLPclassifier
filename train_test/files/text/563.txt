Abstract
Kerosene subsidy reform is a key policy concern in India and other developing countries. As kerosene
is widely used for lighting in India, any price change will likely have considerable public welfare
impacts on the large fraction of the poor who do not have access to reliable electricity supply for
lighting. In this study, we assess historic kerosene use for residential lighting across population groups
separated by urban/rural, expenditure, and electricity service levels using data from India.
Consumption trends are used to inform a service demand model and evaluate how changes in fuel
price, electricity connection, and supply reliability influence environmental, health and economic
outcomes. We find that users relying on kerosene for supplemental lighting--in combination
(`stacked') with electricity--accounted for 64% of residential kerosene consumed for lighting in 2005.
Tested scenarios that addressed service needs of supplemental users had the greatest welfare benefits,
especially in the future. Scenarios reducing PM2.5
emissions from kerosene lighting can avert between
50 and 300 thousand disability adjusted life years relative to a baseline scenario in 2030. Lighting
kerosene is highly price sensitive, resulting in a drop in demand of 97% in a scenario in which current
subsidies are phased out by 2030. Deadweight loss of the subsidy in 2005 is estimated at $200­950
million, with three quarters attributable to supplemental kerosene lighting. Support for cleaner
lighting technologies not reliant on fossil fuel subsidies would appear to be `no regrets' or `co-benefits'
options for India, and could be implemented in parallel with subsidy removal.
Introduction
Many low- and medium-income countries subsidize
kerosene with the intent of providing modern cooking
and lighting services to poor households. Such sub-
sidies have come under heavy criticism on economic
grounds because of the often heavy financial burden
on governments and because subsidizing kerosene
directly is not an efficient way to reach the poor [1, 2].
Often heavily encouraged by international financial
organizations, there have been attempts by govern-
ments to reduce kerosene subsidies that have some-
times had to be reversed because of domestic political
difficulties due to heavy public resistance [3]. This
illustrates a major problem with untargeted subsidies
--they are difficult to take away. In addition, because
of its similarity to diesel, with which it can be mixed,
subsidized kerosene is often diverted away from its
intended recipients into other sectors [2]. This is a
significant reason why the Government of India
recently announced placing kerosene under its direct
benefit transfer scheme [4]. Despite the good intent of
such subsidy programs, the inefficiencies due to poor
targeting and diversion severely limit their effective-
ness [5], and likely do not promote the best or most
cost-effective solution given the increased availability

of more efficient fuels and technologies for delivering
the same (or better) level of service even in areas with
poor electricity coverage, such as liquefied petroleum
gas (LPG) and solar lamps [6­8].
In recent years, it has become recognized that ker-
osene subsidies pose other problems as well due to the
increased use they encourage. Evidence is accumulat-
ing that whether used as a cooking or lighting fuel, air
pollution emissions from simple kerosene-fueled
devices pose significant health risks, possibly greater
on a per-mass basis than biomass smoke [9]. In addi-
tion, kerosene lighting is now understood to be a sig-
nificant source of black carbon (BC) emissions--an
important climate-altering pollutant--in several parts
of the world including South Asia [10]. Finally, with
the rise of concern about fossil CO2
emissions, there is
growing criticism of subsidies for any fossil fuel [11].
The most successful elimination of kerosene sub-
sidies in recent history was in Indonesia where in just a
few years starting in 2007, kerosene subsidies were
phased out while slightly increasing LPG subsidies as
well as instituting a range of other facilitating actions.
The result was a massive shift from kerosene to LPG
for cooking apparently saving the Indonesian treasury
billions of dollars in net subsidy each year, increasing
the efficiency and convenience and lowering the cost
of cooking for tens of millions of households [12].
The largest use of subsidized kerosene in the world
is in India where there have been calls to follow the
Indonesian example to relieve the approximate USD 5
billion [4] subsidy burden on the taxpayer each year, as
well as achieve other benefits [13]. Unfortunately,
however, the kerosene situation in India is quite differ-
ent in that, unlike Indonesia, most kerosene is used for
lighting not cooking. Thus reducing kerosene sub-
sidies could potentially have considerable public wel-
fare impacts on the large fraction of the poor who do
not have access to reliable electricity supply. Indone-
sian households, on the other hand, were more than
90% electrified at the start of their switch out of
kerosene.
Thus, to facilitate a shift from kerosene to cleaner
and more efficient alternatives in India, and poten-
tially elsewhere, requires a detailed understanding of
its role in lighting, which is the purpose of this paper.
Kerosene as a lighting fuel
Achieving adequate household illumination chal-
lenges many families in India as well as other develop-
ing countries. An estimated 1.2 billion people lacked
access to electricity in 2010 [14], while likely many
more experienced frequent supply interruptions. In
the absence of electricity, homes frequently turn to
fuel-based light sources for illuminating their homes
and businesses [15]. Often encouraged by government
subsidies, kerosene-fueled lamps are a common light
source,--used by 380 million in India in 2011 for
primary lighting [16], not including those reliant on it
for backup light. The most economically accessible
and widely used kerosene lamps provide poor illumi-
nation relative to electricity and can be highly ineffi-
cient [17], converting as much as a tenth of the fuel
carbon to health-impacting and climate-altering parti-
culate matter (PM) [10]. Even after electricity connec-
tions are achieved, households may continue to rely on
kerosene or other inefficient light sources, such as
candles, for some years [18].
Lack of residential lighting is recognized as a
household energy problem; however, compared to
studies of cooking, few efforts have quantified the
potential impacts or benefits of kerosene replacement.
Consequently, lighting activities are often absent from
health and climate assessments that discuss improve-
ments to the `household' sector. Factors linked to resi-
dential lighting, particularly electricity [7] and access
to cleaner petroleum-based fuels [8], however, may
influence other energy activities which co-exist in the
same household energy system. By strengthening the
understanding of individual system components, it
may be possible to improve the effectiveness of future
residential energy programs.
This study aims to improve the understanding of
welfare impacts resulting from the most widely used
fuel-based lighting source globally--kerosene--and
to begin to estimate the potential impacts of efforts to
reduce its use. We specifically examine the role of ker-
osene for supplemental lighting within homes with
electricity, and the associated impacts of use in this
context in India. This analysis is facilitated by a nation-
ally representative household survey with detailed
energy end-use information.
· From an analysis of a nationally representative
household survey from 2005, trends in kerosene
consumption for lighting are reported in relation to
household and energy access characteristics, to
examine drivers of use.
· Residential consumption of kerosene for lighting in
India is estimated in 2020 and 2030 under a baseline
scenario and alternate scenarios that modify the
electricity grid connection rate, electricity service
reliability (hours of electricity available), kerosene
price (subsidization), and use of clean replacement
technology.
· Pollutant emissions and adult health burden from
outdoor particulate matter (PM2.5
) exposures are
evaluated in 2020 and 2030 under a baseline
scenario and alternate scenarios. The economic
impact of the kerosene subsidy in 2005 is quantified
through its deadweight loss (DWL) and social
(external) costs are estimated.

Methods
Study overview
Figure 1 presents a schematic of the study workflow.
An analysis of the India Human Development Survey
(IHDS) 2005 [22] was performed to quantify historic
consumption of kerosene for lighting and consump-
tion characteristics across heterogeneous household
groups. Survey-based trends informed a service
demand model for kerosene, which was linked to the
widely used integrated assessment model, Model for
Energy Supply System Alternatives and their General
Environmental Impacts (MESSAGE) [23], to allow
for residential demand to be influenced by macro
feedbacks from the larger energy system, particularly
via energy prices. Alternate future scenarios were
used to test the effect of fuel price, electricity
connection and electricity supply reliability on future
consumption of kerosene for lighting. Pollutant
emissions from kerosene lighting and outdoor PM2.5
concentrations for calculating changes in health
burden were estimated using the Greenhouse Gas
and Air Pollution Interactions and Synergies
(GAINS) model [24, 25].

Survey and base year analysis
The IHDS obtains household expenditure and quan-
tity of kerosene consumed in the previous 30 days, as
well as the activity for which it is mainly used,
including options of `combination use' and `no use'.
Information on consumption and activity is collected
regardless of the position of kerosene in the household
energy hierarchy (e.g. primary, secondary etc), thus
providing a measure of `any use'. We assume that all
kerosene use reported is used to meet the specified
service or combination of services. `Primary users' are
defined as households without electricity connection
using kerosene for any lighting, and `supplemental
users' as having electricity connection, of any service
level, using kerosene for any lighting. To facilitate
analysis, we disaggregated the population into thirteen
groups over three levels: geographic sector (urban or
rural), total household expenditure ($/person-year)
and electricity service level (no electricity, service less
than 16 h d-1, greater than 16 h d-1). The currency
used for analysis was purchasing power parity of 2005
($), unless specified otherwise.
Alternate scenarios and future kerosene
consumption
Alternate scenarios were developed to examine the
effect of kerosene price, electricity connection rate,
and electricity reliability on future (2020, 2030)
demand for kerosene as a lighting fuel (table 1).
Kerosene demand in the future was adjusted for
changes in population size, household income, kero-
sene price, and their associated feedbacks, based on
methods developed for the Global Energy Assessment
[26, 27]. We include a replacement scenario (Solar)
where primary and supplemental kerosene lighting
services are entirely replaced by 2030 with clean
lighting technology independent of the grid. This
technology is assumed here to be pico-solar LED
lamps equivalent in price and performance to entry-
level devices meeting the Lighting Global Minimum
Quality Standards [6, 28], although we recognize that
numerous technological options for replacing kero-
sene exist [6]. Alternate scenario, interventions/
actions are assumed to progress linearly after 2005.
Further details on alternate scenarios (S1.3) and future
demand dynamics (S1.4) are provided in the SI.
Impacts
We performed an examination of selected environ-
mental (pollutant emissions), health (health impacts
from outdoor PM2.5
) and economic (DWL) conse-
quences of kerosene lighting in India. Impacts were
apportioned between primary and supplemental user
groups when possible.
Estimated quantities of kerosene used for lighting
services were combined with device stock estimates
and emission factors to add domestic lighting as a sec-
tor within the GAINS emission inventory for India. As
part of GAINS, outdoor concentrations of primary
PM2.5
are estimated using a source-receptor relation-
ship derived from the TM5 model [29]. All generated
emissions are assumed to reach the outdoors.
Changes to kerosene lighting activities on health
burden associated with exposure to outdoor PM2.5
are
reported as the difference between health burden
under alternate scenarios and the baseline scenario in
2020 and 2030. Diseases associated with outdoor
PM2.5
included in the 2010 Global Burden of Disease
(GBD) for adults over 24 years [30] are considered and
reported in disability adjusted life years (DALYs).
Background future disease rate projections are based
on historic trends in India, guided by procedures
described elsewhere [31]. Disease risk estimates were
calculated using nonlinear exposure response func-
tions developed for the 2010 GBD, and used to calcu-
late attributable burden using techniques described
and applied elsewhere [31­34]. Exposures occurring
indoors are likely an important contributor to kero-
sene lighting impacts but are not evaluated here. Epi-
demiological evidence associating health risks with
reported kerosene use in the home, or micro-environ-
mental exposures are few [9], and require confirma-
tion before the burden due to indoor exposure can be
estimated with confidence.
The past economic impact of kerosene used for
lighting in India was estimated by calculating its DWL.
DWL is a measure of the economic inefficiency result-
ing from an imposed change in the price of a

Fuel subsidies reduce the price observed by the con-
sumer, resulting in more consumption than would
likely occur at a market price (no subsidy). Fossil fuel
subsidies are also unique because of the potential for
their emissions to impose social (external) costs. We
value some of these external costs by calculating the
social cost of CO2
and BC emissions on climate,
restricting this to consumption of DWL kerosene.
Methods used are informed by those described in [35].
Results
Historic consumption trends in India
In 2005, 64% of kerosene users reported lighting as
their main end-use, with cooking reported by 20%,
heating 2%, and combination use (assumed cooking
and lighting) by 14%. Thirty three percent of all
households were classified as primary kerosene light-
ing users. This is 8% greater than the percent of houses
using kerosene as a main lighting source using
National Sample Survey Organization (NSSO) data
from a similar time period [36, 37]. Adding supple-
mental lighting users to primary users increases
national kerosene lighting user prevalence in 2005
to 61%.
Kerosene consumption for residential lighting was
estimated at 4670 Gg (95% CI: 4300, 5100) in 2005,
constituting approximately 70% of kerosene used by
houses. Rural populations accounted for approxi-
mately 70% of total residential kerosene consumption
(5000 Gg) and eighty percent (3840 Gg) was con-
sumed for lighting services. By end-use, cooking
in urban areas was slightly greater (420 Gg, 51%)
than lighting (350 Gg, 43%). Conversely, lighting
accounted for 80% (3840 Gg) of residential kerosene
use in rural areas (Cooking: 920 Gg, 19%). Heating
constituted 2% (160 Gg) of total kerosene use. Assum-
ing average kerosene consumption and lumen effi-
ciencies yields daily household lighting service level of
approximately 7­8 h per day and roughly 200 lumen-
hours, or two lamps operating 3­4 h each day,
approximately.
Supplemental lighting accounted for 64% of kero-
sene consumed for residential lighting in 2005
(2980 Gg). Consumption by primary users constituted
36% (1690 Gg) of lighting kerosene. In rural areas,
60% (2270 Gg) of lighting kerosene was used for sup-
plemental light, and increased to 85% (710 Gg) in
urban areas where electricity connection rates excee-
ded 90%. Kerosene consumption estimates were
within 15% of those derived from NSSO sur-
veys [36, 37].
Kerosene for lighting was observed over all levels
of electricity service (figure 2), suggesting that while
electricity has the expected effect of reducing kerosene
dependency, there exist unmet lighting service needs
not addressed through initial grid connections. This is
consistent with field observations, suggesting that ker-
osene is often still relied upon a as mobile light sources
and for illuminating rooms without electrical wir-
ing [18].
Figure 3 illustrates trends in rural lighting con-
sumption over per-capita expenditure for three elec-
tricity service levels. The trend is approximately
lognormal, with consumption increasing with expen-
diture and plateauing above $2.00 PC d-1, approxi-
mately. The difference in consumption rates and
saturation levels across electricity service groups is
suggestive of a modifying effect of electricity service on
kerosene consumption. Fitted curves in figure 3 sug-
gest that non-electrified households consume more
kerosene than electrified houses at similar expenditure
levels--although significant overlap occurs below
$1.00 PC d-1. For the two electrified groups, there is
an apparent difference above $2.00 PC d-1, but sig-
nificant overlap below.
Estimated future demand and impacts under
alternate scenarios
Alternate scenarios were tested to examine how
changes to dependence on kerosene, resulting from
changes to electricity service level, kerosene price and
kerosene replacement, could affect kerosene demand
and selected downstream welfare impacts. Changes
are evaluated in the base year (2005) and 2020,
and 2030.
Kerosene demand
Under the baseline scenario (baseline), there is gradual
reduction in kerosene consumption for lighting that
continues beyond 2030, indicating a continued reli-
ance on non-grid lighting energy for the next decades
(figure 4). Universal electricity connection (UC) by
2030 provides a modest 10% reduction in kerosene
consumption between 2010 and 2030, relative to the
baseline. Complementing UC with better electricity
supply reliability (greater than 16 h d-1, UCS) reduces
consumption by an additional 20% over the same
period. Kerosene reductions due to electricity access
are attenuated in the future by an opposing effect of
income growth.
The largest deviations from baseline, without
assumed replacement of kerosene (Solar), result from
changes to kerosene price. Between 2005 and 2030,
total demand is reduced by 80% from baseline as a
result of a steady annual removal of the subsidy (SPO
scenario). High price sensitivity has a similarly strong
effect under the full subsidy bounding scenario (FS),
roughly doubling demand. While the magnitude of
changes is sensitive to demand elasticity, overall trends
remain similar, with UAS yielding the greatest reduc-
tion among the electrification scenarios, and removal
of the subsidy yielding the greatest reductions in kero-
sene overall. High price sensitivity is consistent with
findings from a village level pilot study in India, which
5
Environ. Res. Lett. 11 (2016) 044014
measured an 85% reduction in kerosene sales several
months after the replacement of the kerosene subsidy
with unconditional cash transfers [1]. Previous studies
have also found consumption of residential fuels to be
highly sensitive to price [38], and for cooking services
specifically [39].
Using kerosene demand, we estimated the finan-
cial benefit of an effort that would support residential
lighting services using pico-solar lighting in place of
kerosene. Assuming a steady annual phase-in of pico-
solar beginning in 2015­16 and completing in 2030,
and continued support (replacement every 5 years),

accrued net present benefits are estimated at $12 bil-
lion. A more rapid transition that is complete by 2020
but is continuously supported through 2030 yields a
present value benefit of $18 billion. These benefits
result solely from fuel consumption reductions and do
not consider other changes to household welfare or
foreign exchange as a result of reduced import of crude
oil. For example, we do not consider differences in the
quality of service (e.g. lumens) or costs associated with
implementation potentially against (e.g. distribution
infrastructure) or in favor of (e.g. economy of scale) of
the replacement pico-solar devices.
Pollutant emissions and health impacts from outdoor
primary PM2.5
PM2.5
emissions from primary and supplemental use
of kerosene for residential lighting in 2005 were
estimated at 250 Gg, increasing national PM2.5
emis-
sions from all sectors by 3%­4%, using GAINS
emission inventories. Particulate emissions are rich in
BC (92% BC), resulting in an increase of 20%­25%
compared to not considering kerosene lighting as a
source. End-use emissions from cooking and lighting
together accounted for 35% of PM2.5
emissions and
65% of BC emissions. Co-emitted organic carbon
(OC) and sulfur dioxide (SO2
) contributed less than
0.5% to national emissions of either pollutant. The
CO2
emission rate was estimated to be less than one
percent of national CO2
emissions (13 Mt).
Use of kerosene for supplemental lighting accoun-
ted for approximately 60% of the PM2.5
emissions
from this source. Trends in emissions across popula-
tion groups closely reflected consumption trends, but
do not scale proportionally due to differences in light-
ing device stock efficiencies. Compared to the national
average, the fraction of PM emissions attributable to
supplemental lighting is greater in urban areas (85%),
and lower in rural areas (45%). Under alternate sce-
narios not assuming complete replacement (Solar sce-
nario), PM2.5
emission reductions of 18% (UC) to
96% (SPO) by 2030 are estimated (figure 5).
Mitigation of adult health burden in India due to
changes in outdoor PM2.5
resulting from reduced ker-
osene lighting activity are modest (figure 5). The
GAINS model aggregates over all anthropogenic emis-
sions of PM2.5
. Thus, outdoor primary PM2.5
burden
from kerosene lighting is reported as the difference in
DALYs between alternate scenarios and the baseline
scenario, and primary or supplemental uses are not
differentiated. Improvements to electricity connection
and supply reliability are estimated to avert 50­180
thousand DALYs relative to the baseline scenario in
2030, equivalent to approximately 0.3%­1.3% of adult
outdoor PM2.5
burden. More aggressive reduction
pathways acting through pricing (SPO) or replace-
ment (Solar) yield greater reductions of 270­300 thou-
sand DALYs (1.9%­2.1% adult outdoor PM2.5
burden).
Economic impacts: DWL and selected social costs
The DWL from subsidization of kerosene lighting was
estimated at $950 million. For comparison, the under-
recovery by oil companies in the same year has been
estimated at $3.3 billion [2]. Assuming unit elasticity
and linear demand yields a more conservative, lower
bound, estimate of $200 million. Only 20% of DWL
was attributed to consumption for primary lighting
(non-electrified houses), with the majority of DWL
attributed to supplemental lighting services (electrified
households).
The social cost of carbon (SCC) emissions acting
through climate impacts from DWL kerosene used for
lighting was estimated at $70 million for CO2
, assum-
ing a current social cost of $32 per ton CO2
. Caution is

warranted in comparing effects of short-lived climate
agents like BC with those of longer-lived greenhouse
gases. Nevertheless, by applying a conservative CO2
equivalence of 700 [40], a first approximation of SCC
for BC of $850 million is estimated. Further informa-
tion on DWL and social cost estimates are available in
the SI text (S2.5).
Discussion
This study is among the first assessments of kerosene
lighting characteristics for primary and supplemental
lighting, and the most comprehensive assessment of
associated historic and future welfare impacts. This
work will benefit from refinement, but represents a
step towards understanding lighting within the house-
hold energy system of developing countries as well as
benefits of replacement of kerosene subsidies for
meeting lighting services.
The use of multiple fuels and technologies to meet
similar energy service needs, often termed `energy
stacking', has been observed for residential cooking
activities [41, 42], and lighting [43]. Efforts to char-
acterize stacking are often motivated by its attenuation
of intervention or energy transition benefits. Few stu-
dies, however, have quantified the impacts and oppor-
tunities from addressing stacking practices,
particularly in the future or for non-cooking services.
The consumption of kerosene for supplemental
lighting was approximately equal to the amount con-
sumed for primary lighting (used in houses without
electricity). However, characteristics and contribu-
tions of supplemental users may be overlooked, as they
often are, if only `main/primary' sources of any house-
hold service are measured. Top-down fuel estimates
may do a better job capturing total residential fuel use,
but then must be disaggregated across end-uses. Pro-
viding a better accounting of supplemental fuel use
and identifying the services the fuel provides will help
to improve and constrain, for example, pollutant
inventories used to study household energy policies or
mitigation options being considered to reduce air pol-
lution or climate impacts.
Clear differences in kerosene consumption for light-
ing are observed across groups differing in electricity

reliability level, illustrating the general importance of
considering this factor. Our scenarios suggest that little
change in kerosene demand can be expected till 2030
(less than 10%), if electricity coverage improves, but are
not accompanied by better supply reliability or access to
affordable kerosene alternatives. In rural areas in part-
icular, we find that while kerosene use reduces as elec-
tricity reliability improves, kerosene consumption will
persist. This suggests that, in addition to reliability,
issues of affordability and latent lighting demand may
ensure continued reliance on kerosene and other non-
grid light sources. Thus, electrification programs may
maximize population benefits by simultaneously
increasing financial access to technologies resilient to
grid reliability--for example, providing affordable
accesstosolarlampsandchargeableCFLbulbs.
Efforts that simultaneously address primary and
supplemental lighting may also carry considerable eco-
nomic co-benefits. Replacement of kerosene lighting
serviceswith one exampleof currently availabletechnol-
ogy, pico-solar lamps, in 2015­2016 would yield a pre-
sent value benefit of approximately $12 billion by 2030.
A rapid replacement by 2020, with continued support
through 2030, would increase benefits to $18 billion.
Although cost-effectiveness of currently available tech-
nologies is promising, viability is still contingent upon
their affordability and distribution. Annualized costs,
for example, mask important distinctions between the
cost structure of kerosene and non-fuel-based light
sources. Support for innovative financing schemes that
convert lump sum upfront costs into a stream of smaller
payments more reflective of household income flow
maybeonesolution,butrequirefurtherevaluation.
While removal of kerosene subsidies would yield
major reductions in kerosene demand, as well as eco-
nomic and environmental benefits, it is unclear whe-
ther the net impact to households would be beneficial
in the absence of clean and affordable alternatives. In
2005, subsidy DWL in India was estimated at
$200­950 million, before considering social costs,
with over three quarters attributed to use by electrified
houses. In the absence of affordable and clean alter-
natives to kerosene, however, households may turn to
other inefficient energy sources to meet lighting ser-
vices, or perhaps worse, be left in the dark. Shifting
subsidies to clean lighting technologies less vulnerable
to diversion and robust to electricity reliability would
provide continued support for lighting services in low-
income households, while alleviating some of the fiscal
burdens of inefficient kerosene subsidies.
We find that reductions in the use of kerosene for
lighting would result in modest benefits to outdoor air
quality and national disease burden. Reductions to pri-
mary outdoor PM2.5
resulting from scenarios reducing
kerosene use for lighting were estimated to avert

effects on kerosene consumption, maximum health
benefits were observed under scenarios in which supple-
mental uses of kerosene for light were reduced. Burden
from exposures occurring in the house (indoor air pol-
lution) is not evaluated here and further research is nee-
ded to better understand the degree to which kerosene

Limitations
There are several limitations to this study. The analysis
here was performed using historical data from India,
which may not be representative of allregions relying on
kerosene for lighting services. Historical data and trends
are based on a cross sectional survey from 2004 to 2005,
but represented the most comprehensive data available
for a detailed assessment of lighting activities at a
national scale and for exploring supplemental lighting.
We have focused solely on lighting demand in this
analysis, without considering how changes in access to
householdenergy carriers for cooking and other services
might impact kerosene demand--and vice versa. This is
an important consideration, given that new energy
sources could conceivably alter other activities in the
home. We also do not consider how a more rapid
deployment of decentralized electrification solutions
might affect the rate of increase in electricity availability
and reliability among rural households and their
demand for kerosene. However, a broader analysis of
thesedevelopmentsmightbeanareaforfutureresearch.
Conclusions
Recent national commissions [44] have called for
substantial reduction of kerosene subsidies in India,
but have not yet been followed by strong action,
perhaps partly because of concerns about the full
implications for the country, particularly for the poor.
The analysis presented here, however, should provide
additional support for such efforts. We have found
that there would likely be sizeable benefits of reducing
kerosene lighting on population, economic, and
environmental welfare in India. Solutions that reduce
reliance on fuel based lighting for supplemental, as
well as primary uses, may provide the largest overall
benefits, especially in the next decade. Evenmore rapid
transitions away from kerosene subsidies than con-
sidered in this study will likely accelerate the realiza-
tion of benefits evaluated here, but should consider
how and if lighting services in houses are affected as a
result of such transitions. Support for cleaner lighting
technologies not reliant on fossil fuel subsidies would
appear to be `no regrets' or `co-benefits' options for
India, and could be implemented in parallel with
subsidy removal, although careful monitoring and
evaluation is necessary to verify the effectiveness of any
proposed alternative.
