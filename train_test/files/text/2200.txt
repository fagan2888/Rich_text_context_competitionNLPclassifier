Introduction: The purposes of this study were to assess the extent to which latent trajectories of
female intimate partner violence (IPV) victimization exist; and, if so, use negative childhood
experiences to predict trajectory membership.
Methods: We collected data from 1,575 women at 5 time-points regarding experiences during
adolescence and their 4 years of college. We used latent class growth analysis to fit a series of person-
centered, longitudinal models ranging from 1 to 5 trajectories. Once the best-fitting model was
selected, we used negative childhood experience variables--sexual abuse, physical abuse, and
witnessing domestic violence--to predict most-likely trajectory membership via multinomial logistic
regression.
Results: A 5-trajectory model best fit the data both statistically and in terms of interpretability. The
trajectories across time were interpreted as low or no IPV, low to moderate IPV, moderate to low IPV,
high to moderate IPV, and high and increasing IPV, respectively. Negative childhood experiences
differentiated trajectory membership, somewhat, with childhood sexual abuse as a consistent predictor
of membership in elevated IPV trajectories.
Conclusion: Our analyses show how IPV risk changes over time and in different ways. These
differential patterns of IPV suggest the need for prevention strategies tailored for women that consider
victimization experiences in childhood and early adulthood. [West J Emerg Med. 2012;13(3):272­277.]
INTRODUCTION
Latent Trajectories of Intimate Partner Violence
Victimization
Male physical violence against women within the context
of an intimate relationship--intimate partner violence (IPV)--
is an unfortunate global reality. Over 30% of women in the
United States (U.S.) are physically victimized by their intimate
partners at some point during their lives.1 Although similar
rates have been found for men and women, the consequences
of male-to-female IPV are decidedly more severe; the majority
of patients who visit emergency departments for IPV-related
injuries are women,2 and far more women are killed at the
hands of male partners than the converse.3 This study analyzed
longitudinal data on women's experiences of IPV
victimization to test whether there is a single trajectory of IPV
across time that represents all women or if there are multiple
trajectories.
Because IPV occurs within the context of intimate
relationships, it is common for women to be repeatedly
victimized: one in three victims of IPV reported experiencing
4 or more incidents of physical violence committed by the
same partner.4 In fact, the strongest predictor of IPV
victimization is previous victimization.5 Researchers know
more about characteristics of perpetrators who commit
multiple acts of IPV, than about victims.6,7 Researchers also
know a large proportion of IPV victims were also victims of
childhood abuse, a phenomenon known as revictimization.8,9

symptomology than women without a history of
victimization.10
The purpose of this investigation is to determine whether
latent trajectories of physical IPV victimization exist, and if so,
the role of revictimization in these trajectories. We tested a
series of latent class growth models to assess meaningful
patterns of IPV experiences using longitudinal data collected
from female college students. Latent class growth analysis
(LCGA) is a simplified case of growth mixture modeling where
within-class variances are fixed at zero.11,12 This technique has
been used previously to explore trajectories of female sexual
victimization.13
Our first research question concerned latent heterogeneity
within our sample in terms of the frequency of IPVexperiences
across time. Based on the previous literature, we expected to
find at least 2 distinct subgroups: a large group of women who
were not victimized during adolescence or college and a
smaller group of women who were consistently victimized
across this time period.5
Our second research question examined whether negative
childhood experiences could differentiate between groups that
emerged. To test this question we explored whether childhood
sexual abuse, witnessing domestic violence and parental
physical punishment predicted latent trajectory membership.
Consistent with previous literature, we hypothesized these
negative childhood experiences would differentially predict
IPV trajectory membership.
METHODS
Participants
Data for this study are part of a large longitudinal dataset
of social experiences (data available at http://dx.doi.org/10.
3886/ICPSR03212). Participants were 18- to 19-year-old
women enrolled at a medium-sized university in the
southeastern U.S. Two incoming classes of first-year women
were invited to complete a series of 5 surveys over 4 years of
college; 85% of women invited agreed to participate by
completing the initial survey (n ¼ 1,575). Approximately
25.3% of women self-identified as African-American, 70.9%
as Caucasian, and 3.8% identified with other ethnic groups.
Participants' average age was 18.3 years; 92.8% had never been
married.
Procedure
The local institutional review board approved all
procedures. The surveys gauged a number of social
experiences including predictors, correlates, and
consequences of interpersonal violence. Data collection at the
first time-point--negative childhood experiences and
adolescent IPV victimization--was conducted during the
university's fall first-year orientation for 2 consecutive years
with hour-long sessions conducted by trained undergraduate
orientation leaders. Leaders acquired informed consent before
survey administration after explaining the purpose and
method of data collection. Experiences during each year of
college--collegiate IPV victimization--were assessed at the
end of the spring semester over the subsequent four years.
Participants were given $15 in exchange for each survey
completed. To protect confidentiality, the third author
obtained a federal Certificate of Confidentiality from the
National Institutes of Mental Health. Yearly participant
retention rates were 89%, 86%, 80%, and 78%, respectively;
47.2% of the initial sample completed all 5 time-points of the
study.
Measures
Intimate Partner Violence (IPV). The Conflict Tactics Scale
(CTS)14,15 assessed physical IPV victimization during
adolescence and college. The CTS has been the most widely
used measure over 3 decades of research on conflict and
violence within intimate relationships. Participants are asked to
indicate the number of times they have experienced: (1) threats
to hit or throw something at the participant; (2) throwing
something; (3) pushing, grabbing, or shoving; (4) hitting or
attempting to hit, but not with anything; or (5) hitting or
attempting to hit with something hard. The item assessing
whether a respondent was ``beaten up'' was excluded due to low
endorsement-rates during pilot testing. Participants responded
to each item on a scale ranging from 1 to 5, with 1¼``never,'' 2
¼ ``once,'' 3 ¼ ``2 to 5 times,'' 4 ¼ ``6 to 10 times,'' 5 ¼ ``more
than 10 times.'' IPV experiences during high school were
assessed at the first time point, and experiences during each
year of college were measured during each subsequent time
points. Responses were coded so ``never'' was scored 0, ``once''
was scored 1, ``2 to 5 times'' was scored 2, ``6 to 10 times'' was
scored 6, and ``more than 10 times'' was scored 11.
Negative Childhood Experiences. Participants provided
retrospective reports of childhood sexual abuse, parental
physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence during initial
data collection. Each form of abuse was assessed based on
measures used by Koss, Gidycz, and Wisniewski.16
Childhood Sexual Abuse. Childhood sexual abuse was defined
as being a victim of sexual acts perpetrated by an adult or any
coercive sexual act perpetrated by a similarly-aged peer prior
to the age of 14 (e.g., ``A person fondled you in a sexual way
or touched your sex organs or asked you to touch their sex
organs''). Four items were recorded on 5-point scales ranging
from ``Never had this experience'' to ``More than 5 times;'' the
resulting childhood sexual abuse frequency ranged from 0 to
24.
Parental Physical Abuse. Parental physical abuse was defined
as recurrent experiences, rather than rare events, during
childhood. Participants read the following: ``Physical blows
(like hitting, kicking, throwing someone down) sometimes
occur between family members. For an average month, when

you were growing up (i.e., ages 8 to 14 years), indicate how
often one of your parents did this to you.'' Participants
responded on a 5-point scale ranging from ``Never'' to ``Over
20 times.'' Responses were recoded to yield a frequency score
that ranged from 0 to 21.
Witnessing Domestic Violence. Witnessing domestic
violence was defined by the statement: ``For an average month,
indicate how often one of your parents or stepparents delivered
physical blows to the other.'' Participants responded on a 5-
point scale ranging from ``Never'' to ``Over 20 times.''
Responses were recoded to yield a witnessing domestic
violence frequency that ranged from 0 to 21.
Analytic Strategy
We conducted an LCGA with Mplus version 5.1 to
estimate models using maximum likelihood estimation with
robust standard errors.17 Because this estimator assumes data
are missing at random, it uses all cases and all data to estimate
model parameters.18 Please see White and Smith (2009) for an
overview of attrition within this sample.19 The frequency of
physical victimization at each time-point was entered as an
indicator in the analysis. Thus, the latent trajectory class
structure is based on patterns of physical victimization
frequency across time. We designated the frequency variables
as count, which prompted the software to use a Poisson
distribution--where the mean equals the conditional
variance.20 To assess the power of past negative childhood
experiences in discriminating between latent trajectory classes,
we regressed class membership on childhood sexual abuse,
parental physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence;
although these three variables were not used to estimate the
latent groups or classes.
The data were fit to LCGA models ranging from 1 to 5
classes. When building a mixture model there is no singular
indicator of model fit; multiple statistical indicators must be
paired with a theoretical understanding of the constructs to
determine an appropriate class structure.21,22 We used the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and the Lo-Mendell-
Rubin adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test to compare model fit, and
entropy and posterior probabilities to compare how cleanly
each model classified cases into each class structure.23 In
addition, we reviewed plots of estimated means for each model
to compare heterogeneous class structures with past theoretical
and empirical information concerning frequency of sexual
victimization. We used negative childhood experience
covariates to establish additional discriminant validity between
the latent trajectory classes.24
RESULTS
Means, standard deviations, and correlations between
variables used in the modeling process are presented in Table 1.
The five-class model best fit the data, significantly better than
the 4-class model (p¼0.04) according to the Lo-Mendell-Rubin
adjusted Likelihood Ratio Test. The 5-class model has a higher
BIC compared with the 4-class model; although the entropy is a
bit lower for the 5-class model compared with the 4-class model
(.904 versus .921), both exhibited respectable classification
quality. Finally, we selected the 5-class model because we
found it most interpretable; see Figure 1 for the estimated
means plot of the 5-class model. We interpreted each of the
latent trajectory classes below based on parameters noted in
Table 2 and the plot depicted in Figure 1.
Low or No IPV
Of the 5 classes, this class had the highest most-likely
membership (n¼1066, 67.6%). The intercept of this trajectory
class is significantly lower than the average frequency at
baseline (see Table 3). Although the linear and quadratic slopes
are significant, the frequency of IPV in this trajectory starts and
stays low across the 5 time-points (Figure 1). Because most-
likely members of this class experienced little to no
victimization across the study, this class was used as the
reference group for the multinomial logistic regressions of
latent trajectory class membership on the negative childhood
experience variables.
Low to Moderate IPV
This class is estimated to account for over 12% of the
sample (n¼200). The intercept of this trajectory class is not
significantly different from average, but its linear slope is
significantly positive and its quadratic slope is significantly
negative (Table 3). This translates to a trajectory including
women who have slightly elevated levels of victimization
during adolescence and then experience more IPV as they
progress through college, although this increase is somewhat
attenuated during their fourth year of college (Figure 1). We
interpreted this latent class as the low to moderate IPV
trajectory for these reasons.
Moderate to Low IPV
This class accounted for over an estimated 14% of the
sample (n¼218). The intercept of this trajectory class is
significantly higher than average, the linear slope is
significantly negative, and the quadratic slope is significantly
positive (see Table 3). Figure 1 and Table 4 show IPV
frequency is elevated during adolescence but drops sharply
beginning at year 1 of college to a consistently low frequency
thereafter. For this reason we interpreted this latent class as the
moderate to low IPV trajectory.
High to Moderate IPV
This class is one of the smaller groups in terms of most-
likely membership (n¼47, 3.0%). In a similar pattern to the
moderate to low trajectory, this trajectory has a significantly
above average intercept, a significantly negative linear slope,
and a significantly positive quadratic slope. The obvious
difference between these two trajectories--as depicted in
Trajectories of IPV Swartout et al
Western Journal of Emergency Medicine Volume XIII, NO. 3 : August 2012
274
Figure 1--is the intercept of this trajectory greatly exceeds that
of the moderate-to-low IPV trajectory. Women in this IPV
trajectory are the most highly victimized group during
adolescence, but these levels drop sharply at year 1 of college,
although a moderate level of victimization persists across
college. We interpreted this latent class as the high to moderate
IPV trajectory.
High to Increasing IPV
The final class is the smallest group in terms of most likely
membership (n¼44, 2.8%). The intercept of this class trajectory
is significantly higher than the average, the linear slope is
significantly positive, but the quadratic slope is significantly
negative (Table 3). This translates to a trajectory of women who
are highly victimized during adolescence and whose average
frequency of victimization experiences actually increase in
number after they enter college, although this increase is
somewhat attenuated toward their later 2 years of college
(Figure 1). These factors let us to interpret this latent class as
the high to increasing IPV trajectory.
Negative Childhood Experiences
We specified observed negative childhood experience
variables as auxiliary covariates to predict latent trajectory class
membership. With the low or no trajectory class as the
reference group, multinomial logistic regressions suggested
that negative childhood experiences predicted IPV
victimization trajectory membership (Table 3). Childhood
sexual abuse predicted membership in all of the elevated IPV
victimization trajectories when compared with the low or no
victimization trajectory. Furthermore, witnessing domestic
violence predicted membership in the high to moderate
trajectory, and parental physical abuse marginally predicted
high to increasing trajectory membership.
DISCUSSION
Our primary goal was to investigate the heterogeneity of
women's experiences of IPV beginning in adolescence and
spanning their 4 years of college. Using a person-centered
approach to longitudinal data analysis, we identified 5 clearly
articulated trajectories. Based upon estimated intercepts and
slopes for each trajectory, the 5 IPV trajectories were
interpreted as low or no, low to moderate, moderate to low, high
to moderate, and high to increasing. This distribution of
trajectories suggests college women have very diverse

experiences with IPV; it also indicates the frequency of IPV
dramatically changes across time for most women affected. The
period between adolescence and the end of the first year of
college seems to be where most of the change occurs, in both
positive and negative directions.
Our second goal was to predict trajectory membership with
negative childhood experiences. Women who were victims of
childhood physical abuse are more likely to be in the trajectory
characterized by frequent and consistent IPV--findings
consistent with the revictimization literature.8­10 Childhood
sexual abuse predicted membership in all 4 elevated IPV
trajectories, underscoring its central role in future victimization
experiences. Witnessing domestic violence predicted
membership in the high to moderate trajectory and childhood
physical abuse predicted membership in the high to increasing
trajectory, the 2 most worrisome trajectories.
IMPLICATIONS
The ultimate goal of this research is to decrease or even
prevent IPV. To prevent IPV, we must understand patterns of
risk. Our analyses suggest how IPV risk can change over time
for different groups of women. Many IPV prevention and
intervention programs are indiscriminately applied with the
belief that all girls and women are at relatively equal risk of
becoming victims, although the literature has indicated
otherwise for some time.4,5 Differential patterns of IPV
apparent in our data suggest the need for prevention strategies
for women that consider victimization experiences in childhood
and early adulthood. Future investigation should focus on other
childhood variables predicting future IPV trajectories, such as
family income, parents' education, and the presence of
substance use in the home. Future research should also assess
factors leading to these increases and decreases in IPV shortly
after college matriculation to better understand IPV risk and
protective factors.
LIMITATIONS
All data used for these analyses were collected from
students at 1 Southeastern university. Although the Carnegie
Foundation has found students at this institution to be
representative of all students at U.S. state colleges and
universities,25 the findings of this study may not generalize to
all female U.S. college students, students from other countries,
or non-college populations. The IPV literature does not suggest
trajectories would differ across subpopulations of women;
however, caution should be used in generalizing these findings.
Another limitation of this work was its primary focus on the
frequency of women's IPV experiences. By limiting the scope
of the current research to frequency of victimization, all IPV
experiences are given the same weight in the analysis. Future
research designs that include examinations of IPV severity or
other assault characteristics will extend the current findings.
Finally, witnessing domestic violence and physical abuse
during childhood each were measured with 1 item; future
research should use validated measures including multiple
items to assess each construct.
CONCLUSION
The present study makes the case for subgroups of college
women in terms of their patterns of IPV frequency across time.
LCGA identified 5 classes across adolescence and 4 years of
college. These 5 classes are interpreted as low or no, low to
moderate, moderate to low, high to moderate, and high to
increasing IPV trajectories of victimization across time.
Negative childhood experiences--childhood sexual abuse,
witnessing domestic violence, and parental physical
punishment--distinguished between the latent trajectories.
Application of research that distinguishes cohesive subgroups
of victims may inform the disparate efforts of IPV prevention
programs.
