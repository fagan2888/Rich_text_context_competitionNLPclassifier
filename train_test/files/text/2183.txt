Although pregnant adolescents are at high risk of poor birth outcomes, the majority of adolescents go on to
have full-term, healthy babies. Data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a longitudinal
study of a nationally representative sample of adolescents in grades 7­12 in the United States who were sur-
veyed from 1994­1995 through 2008, were used to examine the epidemiology of preterm birth and low birth
weight within this population. Outcomes of pregnancies were reported by participants in the fourth wave of data
collection (when participants were 24­32 years of age); data were compared between female participants who
reported a first singleton livebirth at less than 20 years of age (n = 1,101) and those who were 20 years of age or
older (n = 2,846). Multivariable modeling was used to model outcomes; predictors included demographic charac-
teristics and maternal health and behavior. Among black adolescents, low parental educational levels and older
age at pregnancy were associated with higher birth weight, whereas low parental educational levels and being
on birth control when one got pregnant were associated with higher gestational age. In nonblack adolescents,
lower body mass index was associated with lower birth weight, whereas being unmarried was associated with
lower gestational age. Predictors of birth outcomes may differ by age group and social context.

In 2008, there were 434,758 live births to mothers who
were 15­19 of age in the United States (1). Giving birth
during adolescence (before age 20 years) is associated with
a number of pregnancy complications, including infant
death (2­4), stillbirth (due largely to preterm labor and de-
livery) (5), congenital anomalies (6), preterm birth (PTB),
and low birth weight (LBW) (7). For instance, in 2005,
13.3% of births to girls less than 15 years of age resulted in
offspring with LBW. The rate for 15­19-year-old girls was
10.0%, whereas the overall rate was for all women was
8.2%. Teens less than 15 years of age are at a particularly
high risk, although such pregnancies are fairly rare (8­10).
Several risk factors for LBW/PTB are known for adults,
including black race, smoking, history of LBW/PTB, low
weight gain, short maternal stature (11), low socioeconomic
status, low weight, and nulliparity (12, 13). Teenage
mothers are more likely to be unmarried, to smoke, to gain
a low amount of weight during pregnancy (14), and to get
inadequate prenatal care, which has been strongly associat-
ed with preterm birth in this group (15). However, only a
few studies have addressed the risk factors specifically
within the teenage age group. In 1 clinic-based study,
underweight teens were at higher risk of PTB and having
offspring with LBW (16). In a study using national birth
certificate data, infant mortality among teenagers was asso-
ciated with not reporting the father on the birth certificate,
as well as with alcohol use, tobacco use, and low weight
gain (10). A study of Australian teenage mothers using data
from a national surveillance system found that smoking
was associated with increased rates of small-for-gestational-
age offspring, very PTB, and stillbirth, as was residence in
a very remote area. Nulliparity was associated with an
increased risk of small-for-gestational-age offspring but a
reduced risk of very PTB (17). Birth outcomes were

Birth Outcomes Among Adolescents S151
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(Suppl):S150­S163
reported to be worse in second pregnancies among German
adolescents based on data collected by obstetricians within
a single region of Germany (18).
It is reasonable to think that risk factors might differ
between adolescents and adults. For instance, in adults,
married women have better birth outcomes than do single
women (19). However, single adolescents may be more
likely to live with their parents, and the resources of this
arrangement might outweigh any support provided by mar-
riage. Married or cohabiting teenage parents who do not
live with both parents are less likely to graduate high
school than are those who live with 2 parents (20). One
study found that exposure to violence was associated with
PTB in adolescents but not adults (21). There is also evi-
dence that racial disparities are not as large within teenage
populations (22). Although young black teenagers are at
particularly high risk of LBW (17.2% among girls <15
years of age) compared with national averages, there also
has been some research indicating that black adolescents
actually have better birth outcomes than do older black
women (23).
The purpose of the present article is to further explore
the behavioral and demographic determinants of birth out-
comes among adolescents in a nationally representative
sample and to explore whether predictors of birth outcomes
among teens are different from those of women who first
give birth later in life. This analysis will add to past Ameri-
can studies by utilizing a nationally representative sample
that is more diverse than prior clinic-based studies but in-
cludes more personal-level information than birth certificate
studies; by examining multiple risk factors simultaneously;
and by focusing on both PTB and LBW. Such analyses are
also needed to add to the international literature given the
different socioeconomic, racial, and health services context
of American teens versus their counterparts elsewhere.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data from waves I and IV of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) contractual data
set were utilized. Add Health is a prospective cohort study
of a nationally representative sample of young persons en-
rolled in grades 7­12 in the 1994­1995 school year (wave I)
(24). Follow-up interviews were conducted in 1996 (wave
II), 2001 (wave III), and 2007­2008 (wave IV). Add
Health utilized a multistage probability clustered sampling
design to obtain its original wave I sample. The first stage
of sampling included a stratified random sample of all
public and private high schools in the United States. A
middle school with students who largely attended the se-
lected high school was also recruited from each participat-
ing community. In-school surveys were attempted with all
students attending participating schools; a total of 90,118
were completed. In the second wave I sampling stage, a
sample of adolescents was drawn for in-depth in-home in-
terviews, consisting of a random core sample plus selected
special oversamples; a total of 20,745 interviews were con-
ducted at this stage. At wave II, most students (except wave
I seniors) were eligible for re-interview; at waves III and
IV, all respondents to the wave I in-home interview were
eligible for re-interview. A total of 15,701 interviews were
conducted at wave IV (80.3% response rate). Sampling
weights were adjusted for both unequal probabilities of
selection into the original sample and for loss to follow-up.
The major goal of the analysis was to compare women
who gave birth before 20 years of age with women who
gave birth when they were 20 years of age or older. We
applied a number of inclusion criteria for our analyses.
First, we limited it to females who participated in wave IV,
as that was the only wave by which all respondents had
completed their teenage years and thus had complete data

on teen births. Second, we limited our analysis to partici-
pants with valid sampling weights to make generalizations
to the wider US population. Third, we limited our study to
women whose first births occurred after wave I to ensure
the temporal ordering of predictors and outcomes. Fourth,
we limited analyses to first singleton livebirths. Finally, we
limited the study to persons for whom we had complete
information on outcomes, age, race, and smoking status
during pregnancy (described below). This left us with an
analysis sample of 1,101 teen births and 2,846 adult births.
We also examined 2 somewhat more distinct groups,
women who gave birth before 18 years of age (n = 335)
and women who gave birth at 24 years of age or older (n =
1,394) (25) as a sensitivity analysis.
Measures
At wave IV, girls were asked about previous pregnancies
and their outcomes. If they indicated they had given birth,
they were asked, "How much did the baby weigh at birth?"
"Was [baby's name] born before or after [his/her] due
date?" and then "How many weeks or days early/late was
[baby's name] born?" This was subtracted from 40 weeks
to calculate gestational age. In this analysis, both continu-
ous forms and indicators for LBW (<2,500 g) and PTB
(before 37 weeks of gestation) were included.
Sociodemographic characteristics that have been related
to birth outcomes among adults or adolescents in the prior
literature (race, ethnicity, family structure, and parental edu-
cational level) were included in analyses. All such variables
were measured at wave I. Age at wave I was included as a
continuous variable to control for possible cohort differenc-
es. Self-reported race was specified as black/nonblack and
ethnicity as Hispanic/not Hispanic. Family structure (2 bio-
logical parents vs. other) is an important predictor for many
adolescent health and social outcomes (26­28). Parental ed-
ucational level (higher of either co-residential mother or
father: less than high school diploma, high school diploma/
general equivalency diploma, some postsecondary, or
college degree) was included as an indicator of family-
of-origin socioeconomic status.
A number of behavioral and maternal health variables
were also included based on their prior associations with
adverse birth outcomes in either adult or adolescent popula-
tions. Prepregnancy maternal health variables included gra-
vidity (1 vs. >1) and prepregnancy body mass index (BMI;
weight (kg)/height (m)2) at wave I (underweight, normal
weight, overweight, or obese) and at the wave of data col-
lection before pregnancy. Pregnancy-specific behaviors
measured at wave IV included smoking during pregnancy
(yes or no), prenatal care use (yes or no), and trimester of
prenatal care initiation (first trimester, second trimester, or
third trimester or no prenatal care). Year of offspring's birth
(1995­1999 vs. 2000­2008) was also included to control
for possible period effects, given the large decline in teen
pregnancy rates between the early 1990s and mid-2000s.
Lastly, whether the participant was taking birth control
when she became pregnant (yes or no) was used as a proxy
for intent to get pregnant.
Statistical analyses
All analyses were conducted in SAS, version 9.2 (SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) using survey proce-
dures, which apply population weights and adjust standard
errors for nonindependence between observations due to
school-based sampling. Analyses began with descriptive
statistics of the analysis sample's demographic characteris-
tics by first birth timing (teenaged mother vs. not). Next,
bivariate relations between demographic and behavioral
variables and birth outcomes (LBW, PTB, birth weight,
and gestational age) were examined using 2 analyses or
analysis of variance/t tests, depending on the specification
of the predictor and outcome variables. Additionally, differ-
ences between teen and adult mothers in these associations
were tested using interactions between birth timing

(teenaged mother vs. not) and the predictor variable in lo-
gistic or linear models. In the final step, all predictors were
entered into multivariable models to test their relation with
the outcome, adjusted for other variables. Because of the
known differences in the context of adolescent pregnancy
among racial groups (29), interactions with race (black vs.
nonblack) were examined using product terms, and models
are presented stratified on this variable. Variables were
omitted from these models when cell sizes were less than 5.
The Add Health Study was approved by the institutional
review board of the University of North Carolina at Chapel
Hill, and this analysis was approved by the institutional
review board of Tulane University.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the 2 groups are provided in Table 1.
Women who gave birth as adolescents (ages 13­19 years)
were more likely to be black or Hispanic, to live in a house-
hold without 2 biological parents present, to have parents
with less than a high school education, to have an unem-
ployed parent, and to be unmarried than were women who
gave birth at older ages (ages 20­33 years). They were
more likely to smoke (26% vs. 19%, P < 0.01) and to be
using birth control (30% vs. 20%, P < 0.01) when they got
pregnant. They were not, however, at particularly high risk
of PTB or LBW, and the mean gestational age was actually
a bit longer in the adolescents.
In bivariate analyses of high-risk outcomes (Table 2),
predictors of LBW in the older women included higher
baseline BMI, black race, being primigravid, and not re-
ceiving prenatal care. In the adolescents, black race, being
primigravid, and not receiving prenatal care were associated
with a higher risk of having had a baby with a LBW. Pre-
dictors of PTB (Table 3) among the adult mothers included
Hispanic ethnicity, not receiving prenatal care, and initiat-
ing prenatal care after the first trimester, whereas for ado-
lescent mothers, being married or cohabiting were the only
characteristics associated with PTB. Results were similar
for continuous outcomes for adults; mean birth weight was
lower in adult smokers than nonsmokers (3.19 kg vs. 3.29 kg,
P = 0.01) but not in adolescents (3.23 kg vs. 3.25 kg,
P = 0.79) (Tables 4 and 5).
Younger teen mothers (age at birth <18 years) were also
compared with a somewhat older adult group of mothers (age
at birth 24 years); bivariate analyses were limited to contin-
uous outcomes because fewer births occurred among this
younger group of teen mothers (n = 335) (Web Table 1, avail-
able at http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/). Somewhat different pat-
terns were seen with BMI in the 2 groups. For the younger
women, the heaviest babies and longest gestations were in the
obese group, whereas in the older women, the heaviest babies
were on average in the underweight group (P for interaction =
0.02 for birth weight, 0.10 for gestational age).
In multivariable analysis (Appendix Table 1), among
black adolescents, low parental educational levels and
higher maternal age at pregnancy were associated with
higher birth weight, whereas higher baseline age was asso-
ciated with lower birth weight. Lower parental educational
levels and being on birth control when one got pregnant
were associated with higher gestational age (Appendix
Table 2). In nonblack adolescents, lower BMI was associat-
ed with lower birth weight (Appendix Table 1), whereas
being unmarried was associated with lower gestational age
(Appendix Table 2).
DISCUSSION
Although we found that girls who became pregnant as
adolescents were more likely to fit a high-risk profile than
were girls who gave birth later, PTB and LBW were
equally distributed between adolescent and young adult
mothers. Whether adolescent mothers are truly at high risk
for these complications has been a matter of some debate
(2, 30­32). Adolescents with good access to health care
often do not show a higher risk of complications (33, 34).

Birth Outcomes Among Adolescents S157
Am J Epidemiol. 2012;176(Suppl):S150­S163
The proportion of girls who reported becoming pregnant in
this study (25%) is less than the national average. The na-
tional proportion of adolescents who became pregnant
during the time period of this study (1994­2008) was
between 30% and 40% (35). The study design was initially
based in schools; this underrepresents girls who dropped
out of school before wave I, a phenomenon that may be
more likely among adolescents in the older age cohorts
who become pregnant (29). It is also possible that
there was selective attrition before wave IV because of
childbearing, although weights constructed by Add Health
researchers are meant to address differential loss to
follow-up.
A few risk factors for lower birth weight and gestational
age among adolescents were identified. Being married was
associated with lower gestational age, consistent with re-
search suggesting that adolescent parents may benefit from
living with their family of origin (20). There was also a
tendency for gestational age to be longer in girls who were
using contraception when they conceived, especially
among black women; higher risk with intended adolescent
pregnancy has been previously reported (36). In bivariate
analysis, rates of complications were higher in adolescents
who did not get prenatal care, but this association was not
as strong as in the older women.
Birth weight was lower in black adolescents than in white
adolescents, but the disparity in LBW was similar to that
seen in older women (14% vs. 8% in adults; 12.6% vs. 7%
in adolescents), and absolute levels of LBW were lower in
black teenagers than in older women, though not substan-
tially (19, 22, 29). The interaction analysis suggested that the
impact of the social context on birth outcomes might differ
by ethnic group, as the relation with parental educational
level and maternal age differed by racial group and associa-
tions were not necessarily in the expected directions. Greater
birth weight by age at pregnancy within black adolescent
mothers is consistent with past studies, which have found
young black adolescent mothers to be at particular increased
risk of adverse birth outcomes compared with their older
peers (29). However, lower birth weight among black
adolescent mothers with greater baseline age suggests possi-
ble cohort differences, such that earlier cohorts of these
mothers were at increased risk of negative outcomes.
Strengths of the study include the large, representative
sample and the prospective data collection, but some limita-
tions need to be mentioned. The present study relies on
self-reporting of birth outcomes (birth weight and gesta-
tional age). Although mothers' reports of these outcomes
are generally reliable (37­40) and these pregnancies had
occurred fairly recently, this is a potential source of error.
Studies have found that maternal age does not affect the
accuracy of reporting (39, 41), although ethnicity and soci-
oeconomic status have been found to predict errors (42).
Also, gestational age is ideally assessed with early ultra-
sound (43), especially for teenagers, who have more irregu-
lar menstrual cycles (44). For those who did not have such
an ultrasound, the reported gestational age may have been
inaccurate, even if the last menstrual period-based calcula-
tion is correctly reported. A large proportion of the study
population was also using contraception when they con-
ceived, which might have further delayed pregnancy recog-
nition or contributed to errors in calculating last menstrual
period. Given the multiple sources of error, the direction of
bias is probably unpredictable. Also, the number of cases
was relatively small, leading to imprecise estimates and
limited power to examine interactions. We did not have any
information on complications of pregnancy or whether a
PTB was due to preterm labor, rupture of membranes, or
medical indication.
The results of this analysis suggest that teenagers as a
whole are not at increased risk of adverse birth outcomes
compared with adult mothers despite their overall riskier
behavioral and demographic profile. Further, the conven-
tional risk factors, such as smoking and marital status, may
not exert as strong effects on adolescent mothers as on
adults. Access to prenatal care and support from family
members appear to be potential intervention targets to
improve birth outcomes among young mothers. Future re-
search will address the social and environmental context of
teen pregnancies and their relation with birth outcomes.
