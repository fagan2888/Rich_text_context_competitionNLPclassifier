Who Enrolls In Community-Based Programs For
The Uninsured, And Why Do They Stay?
Enrollees in three communities appeared to be using the programs for
routine preventive and physician care, contrary to the fears of some.

ABSTRACT: Faced with growing numbers of uninsured people, many communities are de-
veloping local programs to provide coverage or improve access. Some might predict that
only those with health problems would participate; however, little is known about who en-
rolls. This paper examines participation and retention in three different community pro-
grams aimed at low-income uninsured adults. In two of the three programs, the typical par-
ticipant had no health problems. Improved access to preventive and routine physician care,
and increased security about getting access to care should the need arise, appeared to be
the primary benefits of both initial and continued enrollment. [Health Affairs 25 (2006):
w183­w191 (published online 11 April 2006; 10.1377/hlthaff.25.w183)]
There are now 45.8 million unin-
sured Americans, up from 38.7 million
in 2000.1 The rising numbers of unin-
sured people are attributable not only to the
drop in take-up of health care coverage
among workers, but also to the significant de-
cline in the percentage of employers offering
coverage.2 With little response to this grow-
ing problem at the state and federal levels,
many communities have pursued local efforts
to address the health care needs of their unin-
sured populations. Recent initiatives such as
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's
(RWJF's) Communities in Charge (CIC) ini-
tiative, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation's Com-
munity Voices program, and the Health Re-
sources and Services Administration's
(HRSA's) Community Access Program (CAP)
and Healthy Communities Access Program
(HCAP) have further spurred the growth of
local programs. Such efforts are receiving in-
creased attention in the health services re-
search literature and the media; however,
many questions remain unanswered about
the patterns of participation and retention in
such programs and what those patterns
suggest about the programs' perceived role
and value among their participants.
There are some common perceptions and
myths among community leaders and policy-
makers about the types of patients communi-
ty-based initiatives will attract. Some worry
that such programs will attract people with
acute care needs who remain enrolled only un-
til their needs are met and then exit until they
once again have a short-term need for medical

care.3 Others express concern that they will
attract chronically ill people who remain en-
rolled as long as they are eligible. The combi-
nation of these two nonrandom selection
processes could result in covering a pool of
participants with high health care needs. To
better inform policy surrounding coverage ex-
pansions, empirical evidence is needed on how
a program's eligibility criteria and target popu-
lation affect who joins, who stays, and for how
long. Similarly, data on how enrollees use ser-
vices while in these programs also represent
useful information to policymakers and pro-
gram administrators.
This paper examines how the myths sur-
rounding participation and retention play out
in three local programs from the CIC initiative.
Using a survey of program participants, we de-
scribe the ebb and flow of participants in these
programs, noting the characteristics of those
who enroll, which enrollees remain and which
leave, and why. Examination of participants'
health status, utilization, and disenrollment
patterns provides important information on
the value of community-based programs to
their participants.
Background On Communities In
Charge
In 2001 the RWJF funded fourteen sites
across the country to develop community pro-
grams aimed at improving access to care for
low-income, uninsured adults. This study ex-
amines results from the three sites chosen for a
participant survey. Although all three pro-
grams provide fairly comprehensive benefits
and aim to coordinate care in some fashion,
they differ greatly in their approach, target
population, financing, and geography.
n Alameda County, California. Alliance
Family Care was a coverage product adminis-
tered by Alameda Alliance for Health, a not-
for-profit health maintenance organization
(HMO) in Alameda County. The program tar-
geted low-income parents and their children.
To be eligible, a person had to be an uninsured
resident of Alameda County with a household
income under 300 percent of the federal pov-
erty level and ineligible for public coverage.
Adults also had to have one or more children
enrolled in the Alliance.4 Citizenship status
was not considered. Alliance Family Care is
the only program of the three studied here that
charged a monthly premium; however, premi-
ums were highly subsidized, ranging from $20
to $120 per month, depending on age. Benefits
included physician care, inpatient and outpa-
tient hospital care, laboratory services, and
prescription drugs. Some services required
small copayments. Recertification of eligibility
occurred every twelve months.
Financing for Family Care came primarily
through the Alliance's reserve fund, with addi-
tional funding through the California Endow-
ment and the California HealthCare Founda-
tion (CHCF). The program also received some
tobacco settlement money from the State of
California.5
n Austin, Texas. Seton Care Plus is an ac-
cess program that provides health care to low-
income uninsured adults in Austin. The Seton
Health Care Network, a large nonprofit health
system, administers the program. Enrollees re-
ceive care at one of three Seton community
health centers (CHCs). To be eligible, a person
must have a household income under 250 per-
cent of poverty and be ineligible for Medicaid
and the local Medical Assistance Program (a
program offered by the county). Citizenship
status is not considered. Upon enrollment,
participants are assigned a primary care pro-
vider (PCP), given an access card to use when
seeking medical services, and assessed sliding-
fee copayments for various services based on
income. Benefits include physician care, inpa-
tient hospital care, lab services, prescription
drugs, and (if approved as appropriate) emer-
gency and urgent care. Seton generally recerti-
fies eligibility every twelve months; however,
the program does recertify at six months for a
small number of people expected to become
eligible for public programs. Seton Care Plus is
financed by the Seton HealthCare Network as
part of its mission to serve the poor.
n Southern Maine. CarePartners offers
access to health care services (including care
management) for low-income adults in three
counties in southern Maine. MaineHealth, an

integrated delivery system serving southern
and central Maine, initiated the program and
continues to provide substantial financial and
other support. All hospitals in the three-
county area (including those outside the
MaineHealth system) and approximately 950
local physicians have volunteered to provide
free care under the program. Although the cri-
teria have since changed, at the time of our
survey, eligibility criteria required that a per-
son be a nonelderly adult with an annual
household income under 150 percent of pov-
erty and ineligible for either government or
employer-sponsored health coverage. In addi-
tion, a person must have resided within the
program's service area for at least six months
and must not have assets exceeding $10,000
(or $12,000 for a family). Enrollees are assigned
a PCP and given a membership card. For spe-
cialty care, enrollees must get a referral from
their PCP. Benefits include physician care, in-
patient hospital care, outpatient surgery, home
care, and prescription drugs. Copayments are
required for certain services. CarePartners re-
certifies eligibility every six months.
Health care for CarePartners enrollees is
provided through the donated in-kind services
of physicians and hospitals. However, Care-
Partners differs from many other donated care
programs in that a local health system (Maine-
Health) also provides substantial funding for
administrative and support services (such as
staff salaries). The program has also received a
HRSA CAP grant and grants from local foun-
dations.
Data And Methods
Data for this analysis come from a multi-
wave telephone survey of program partici-
pants in each of the three sites. Wave 1 was
conducted within six to eight weeks of enroll-
ment (on a rolling basis between August 2001
and August 2002); wave 2 occurred approxi-
mately six months after enrollment; and wave
3, at about twelve months after enrollment.
We attempted to interview everyone who par-
ticipated in the wave 1 survey in waves 2 and 3,
regardless of their enrollment status at that
time. Only adult enrollees were eligible for the
survey. If more than one person per household
joined the program, one person per household
was randomly chosen for inclusion in the sam-
ple frame, to maintain independence.
The survey used a pretested, structured in-
terview format. Many questions were similar
to those of national surveys such as the Com-
munity Tracking Study (CTS) household sur-
vey and the Urban Institute's National Survey
of America's Families (NSAF). The wave 1 sur-
vey included questions about health insurance
coverage, health care use, access, and unmet
need during the previous year; satisfaction
with and opinions about health care; and cur-
rent health status, employment, and socio-
demographic information. The survey instru-
ment for waves 2 and 3 included many of the
same questions but also incorporated addi-
tional satisfaction questions and, for those
who were no longer participating, questions
on reasons for disenrolling.
Response rates to the survey were high for
each site and in each wave. Alameda's response
rate ranged from 88 percent to 93 percent, de-
pending on the wave. In Austin, the wave 1 re-
sponse was 76 percent, but response increased
to 85­86 percent in waves 2 and 3. In southern
Maine, the response rate was 87­89 percent.
Key Findings
n Baseline characteristics of program
enrollees. Enrollees' sociodemographic char-
acteristics at the time of enrollment varied
greatly across the three programs studied (Ex-
hibit 1). Alameda's Family Care program,
which targeted parents, attracted the youngest
adults, most of whom were married. In con-
trast, enrollees in southern Maine's program
were older and more likely to be unmarried.
All three programs attracted more females
than males. After household size was ac-
counted for, average income of enrollees across
the three sites was fairly comparable, ranging
from an average 117 percent of poverty in Aus-
tin to 139 percent in both Alameda County and
southern Maine. The programs in Alameda
and Austin both had large proportions of His-
panic enrollees; in contrast, 88 percent of en-
rollees in southern Maine were white. The

large proportion of Hispanic enrollees in the
Alameda and Austin programs (and Asian en-
rollees in Alameda) reflects both the broader
population and the programs' enrollment ac-
tivities at CHCs serving the Latino and Asian
communities. At least half of the enrollees in
all three sites were working at the time of en-
rollment.
Baseline health status and utilization pat-
terns in the year before enrollment also dif-
fered across the three programs (Exhibit 2). In
targeting parents, Alameda's program appears
to have attracted the healthiest population of
the three programs. Enrollees in Austin's pro-
gram--which drew working uninsured people
who were slightly older than enrollees in
Alameda--were more likely than those in
Alameda to report worse health and chronic or
limiting conditions. Southern Maine's pro-
gram attracted predominantly users of the
health care system: 90 percent had used health
care in the year before enrollment, compared
with about two-thirds of enrollees in Alameda
and Austin. Southern Maine's average enrollee
was also in poorer health than enrollees in the
other two sites: About half reported a chronic
or limiting condition.
n Stated and implied reasons for enroll-
ment. Although enrollees in the three sites
were fairly different in terms of age, marital
status, health status, and previous health care
usage, there was surprisingly little variation in
their reasons for enrolling in the CIC pro-
grams. Responses from the vast majority of en-
rollees suggested that they wanted the feeling
of security associated with being in a program
that provides access to health care. For exam-
ple, when asked a series of agree-disagree
questions about their reasons for being in the
program, 96­99 percent (depending on the
site) agreed or strongly agreed with the state-
ment: "I feel more secure knowing I have

health coverage now." Similarly, 95­97 percent
agreed or strongly agreed with the statement:
"I wanted coverage through [the CIC pro-
gram] in case I get sick." Only 13­22 percent
(depending on the site) said that they were
"not that satisfied" or "not satisfied at all" with
their health care in the year before enrollment,
which suggests that dissatisfaction with care
was not a primary reason for CIC enrollment
in any site. However, 41 percent of enrollees in
southern Maine reported unmet need, for both
health care and prescription drugs, in the pre-
vious year.
n Who stays enrolled, and why? At six
months after enrollment, at least two-thirds of
respondents at all three sites were still en-
rolled in the program (Exhibit 3).6 Retention
was highest among participants in Alameda's
Family Care program, an interesting finding
given that this was the only program of the
three studied that required a monthly pre-
mium. It appears that one important factor
driving the difference in retention might be the
programmatic features of each site--specifi-
cally, the eligibility criteria and the frequency
of recertification. Alameda, which had the
highest retention, recertified eligibility every
twelve months and had the highest income-
eligibility threshold of the three sites. Austin,
with a slightly lower income-eligibility thresh-
old, also recertified every twelve months.7 And
southern Maine, which recertified every six
months and had the lowest income threshold,
had the lowest retention rates.

There were a few significant differences in
sociodemographic characteristics between
continuous enrollees and disenrollees (Exhibit
4). Specifically, disenrollees in Austin and
southern Maine were younger than their con-
tinuously enrolled counterparts. In Alameda,
disenrollees were more likely to be male and
have lower household incomes than continu-
ous enrollees.
To understand disenrollees' motivation for
leaving the program (and perhaps provide
some insight into how they differed from con-
tinuous enrollees), we examined reasons for
disenrollment. The most frequently cited rea-
son for disenrollment was that an enrollee got
a job that offered health insurance or became
eligible for another private or public program.

majority of disenrollees in all three sites were
actually uninsured at some point after disen-
rollment. Only 5 percent (or less, depending
on the site) of disenrollees reported leaving the
program because they didn't think they
needed health care. Similarly, less than 5 per-
cent of disenrollees in each site reported leav-
ing because of dissatisfaction with the pro-
gram.
A small percentage in all three programs re-
ported disenrolling because they were no lon-
ger eligible for the program (16 percent in
southern Maine, which had the lowest income
threshold for eligibility, and 3 percent in each
of the other two sites). Indeed, the most com-
mon reason cited for losing eligibility was that
household income had become too high. In
terms of program affordability, 22 percent of
disenrollees said that they could not afford to
remain in the program in Alameda--the only
program studied that charged enrollees a
monthly premium--compared with 5­8 per-
cent in the other two sites. Although the sam-
ples of disenrollees are too small to detect any
significant differences, this suggests that pre-
miums might have affected continued enroll-
ment.
n Health status, use patterns, and dif-
ferences over time. To determine whether
health care needs might have played a role in
why continuous enrollees remained in these
community-based programs, we examined (1)
health status and use patterns for continuous
enrollees versus disenrollees, and (2) use pat-
terns for continuous enrollees over time. The
first set of analyses informs our understanding
of who remains in these programs by compar-
ing and contrasting characteristics of continu-
ous enrollees with those of disenrollees. The
second provides information on how continu-
ous enrollees use these programs, offering
some important insights into the value of these
programs for participants who took the time
(in terms of eligibility paperwork) to remain
enrolled and, in Alameda, continued to pay the
premium.
We first examined how continuous en-
rollees and disenrollees differed in health sta-
tus and health care use at the time of enroll-
ment (Exhibit 4). There were few significant
differences in health status and use between
these groups, and no consistent patterns. In
Alameda, where there were very few disen-
rollees, those with chronic or limiting condi-
tions were significantly more likely than oth-
ers to disenroll. In the other two sites, there
was no significant difference. Nor were there
significant changes in self-reported health sta-
tus over the year of participation between con-
tinuous enrollees and disenrollees (data not
shown). About half of continuous enrollees
and disenrollees in each site reported no
change in their health status over time. Among
those who did report a change, continuous en-
rollees were no more likely than disenrollees
to report an improvement or decline.
To determine whether usage patterns might
help reveal enrollees' reasons for remaining en-
rolled in their respective programs, we exam-
ined differences in use levels among continu-
ous enrollees for the year before versus the year
after enrollment (Exhibit 5). A significantly
higher proportion of continuous enrollees in
all three sites reported physician use in the
year after enrollment, relative to the year be-
fore, with the largest increase occurring in
Alameda. Moreover, all measures of preventive
care included exhibited a statistically signifi-
cant increase between the year before and the
year after enrollment. Over the same period,
continuous enrollees' satisfaction with health
care increased significantly in all sites.
Concluding Comments
In two of the three programs studied, the
majority of participants were in good, very
good, or excellent health and did not have
chronic or limiting conditions. In these two
programs, Alameda and Austin, the majority of
respondents were still enrolled one year after
enrollment, providing some evidence against
the myth that participants join programs for
acute care needs and disenroll after those
needs are met. The program in southern
Maine, the exception, attracted a significantly
higher proportion of people with either acute
or chronic health care needs.
The majority of enrollees in all three sites

used the programs largely for physician and
preventive care. Self-reported rates of preven-
tive cares increased dramatically after enroll-
ment in all three sites. Getting preventive and
physician care seems to be an important aspect
of participation for those who stay enrolled. In
addition, program enrollees appear to derive
value from the fact that these programs help
them avoid the financial risk associated with
getting health care when they need it. Almost
all enrollees reported that they felt more se-
cure knowing that they had health care cover-
age or access after enrolling in the program.
And although each of the three programs tar-
geted and attracted different subgroups of un-
insured people, the reasons for enrolling and
staying enrolled were fairly consistent across
the three programs.
Less than 5 percent of disenrollees reported
leaving the program because they did not
think they needed health care. Although some
left because they became eligible for other
sources of coverage, many were disenrolled
because they no longer met the program's eligi-
bility criteria or failed to complete the neces-
sary paperwork. The relatively high disenroll-
ment rates in southern Maine largely reflect
CarePartners' recertification of eligibility ev-
ery six months.
There are several important limitations to
this work. The results are based on a small sur-
vey of enrollees in each site, which limited our
ability to detect statistically significant differ-
ences, particularly when comparing sub-
groups such as continuous enrollees versus
disenrollees. The data reflect self-reported use,
health status, and other measures, which are
subject to recall bias and other respondent er-
ror. Moreover, comparisons across the three
sites are made with the caveat that these pro-
grams used different models of care and in-
tended to attract different segments of the un-
insured population from the start. The
environmental context of each site clearly

plays an important role in determining who
joins these programs. Similar programs else-
where might attract a very different set of en-
rollees, depending on the generosity of a state's
Medicaid program, the sociodemographic
makeup of the general population, local char-
ity-care efforts, and other factors.
Our results suggest that although
community programs do not uni-
formly attract high-use, high-cost en-
rollees, their eligibility, recruitment, and re-
enrollment strategies do influence who they
attract. Further, the programs we studied all
offer their participants the security of know-
ing they can get costly care when they need it.
However, in all sites, physician care, rather
than more costly hospital or emergency de-
partment services, was the primary driver be-
hind the increased use observed after enroll-
ment. The value of community programs to
most participants does not appear to stem
from the provision of acute medical care for a
short-term need.

through Medi-Cal (the state's Medicaid pro-
gram), the State Children's Health Insurance Pro-
gram (SCHIP), or Alliance Family Care if the
child(ren) was not eligible for public coverage.
5. Because of internal financial problems, the Alli-
ance contracted Family Care enrollment by sev-
eral thousand people in July 2004 and then ter-
minated the program in June 2005.
6. Because we have no information on nonre-
spondents, we can only report on the enrollment
status of people responding to the survey in
waves 2 and 3. Nonrespondents might be more
likely than respondents to have disenrolled from
the program (for example, moved away from the
area, left the program, and were lost to follow-
up). If retention is calculated as a percentage of
baseline enrollment (which likely overstates
disenrollment), retention rates are 62 percent, 47
percent, and 30 percent at twelve months after
initial enrollment for Alameda, Austin, and
southern Maine, respectively.
7. Austin's Seton Care Plus program did recertify el-
igibility at six months for a small subset of en-
rollees whose income was close to the threshold
for public coverage, although eligibility for most
enrollees was recertified annually.
