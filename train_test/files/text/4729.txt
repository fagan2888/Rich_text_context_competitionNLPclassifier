Article
Traveling exhibits as public pedagogy have been moving
throughout communities in the United States since the 1800s
(Sandlin, O'Malley, & Burdick, 2011). Today, participants in
free-choice learning contexts such as museums, libraries,
and other public places connect to learning through diverse
entry points and have various motivations and reasons for
participating (Falk & Dierking, 2002; Storksdieck,
Ellenbogen, & Heimlich, 2005; Taylor, 2006). International
education exhibits in public spaces are examples of such
free-choice learning contexts in which the learner has control
and choice over what is learned (Falk & Dierking, 2002).
These exhibits may focus on human conflict and human
rights in the past such as the Holocaust or the Khmer Rouge
rule in Cambodia, and the present such as the wars in Syria
or Ukraine. Within a Holocaust education exhibit, for exam-
ple, narratives of victims, perpetrators, bystanders, and res-
cuers of whom a few are designated the Righteous Among
the Nations for their courage may be incorporated to engage
participants in reflection and learning (Albert, 2013; Glover
Frykman, 2009; Parrish, 2010).
Research has documented that participation in free-choice
learning is an interactive process between the learner and the
program, exhibit, or space (Boyer & Roth, 2005; Falk &
Dierking, 2002; Heimlich & Horr, 2010; Yelich Biniecki,
2015). Exhibits focusing on Holocaust education provide
access points of meaning making within urban and rural areas
of various levels of religious, ethnic, and racial diversity.
Educators and scholars need additional information about
how participants make meaning of human conflict and human
rights exhibits in diverse, shared spaces to further understand
how to effectively foster learning in multiple sociocultural
contexts across the United States (Reece, 2005; Taylor, 2012;
Yelich Biniecki, 2015). The purpose of this study is to explore
learners'perceptions of free-choice learning within Holocaust
education, specifically through exhibits focusing on the
Polish Righteous Among the Nations of the World. Our study
focuses on answering the overarching research question:
Research Question 1: How did learners make meaning
of their experiences at exhibits depicting narratives of the
Righteous Among the Nations of the World?
An exploration of this question serves to broaden our under-
standing about how learners make meaning of their experi-
ences and how educators might improve free-choice learning
experiences on this topic and other world affairs.

The Righteous Among the Nations
of the World: An Exploration of
Free-Choice Learning
Susan M. Yelich Biniecki1 and Sarah Donley2
Abstract
The purpose of this study was to explore how learners make meaning of their experiences at exhibits depicting narratives
of the Polish Righteous Among the Nations of the World, free-choice learning contexts. The study focused on two exhibits
at a university in the mid-Western United States. The conceptual framework of the study integrates free-choice learning,
the role of narratives, reflection, and Holocaust education. Three main mechanisms emerged from the qualitative analysis
and interpretation of data of how participants made meaning of their experiences: through emotions, being challenged,
and broadening awareness. This study further informs our understanding of meaning making and learning in free-choice
learning contexts, suggesting ways in which we might provide additional prompts to bridge historical distance and integrate
connectors to learners' personal contexts in international education exhibits.

Conceptual Framework
The conceptual framework for this study incorporates free-
choice learning, narratives, the role of reflection in learning,
and Holocaust education. These bodies of literature informed
the lenses through which we grounded and viewed the explo-
ration of free-choice learning within the Righteous Among
the Nations exhibits.
Free-Choice Learning
Learning is a complex process. Merriam (2001) states,
The learning process is much more than systematic acquisition
and storage of information. It is also making sense of our lives,
transforming not just what we learn but the way we learn, and it
is absorbing, imagining, intuiting, and learning informally with
others. (p. 96)
Free-choice learning is self-directed (Ausburn, 2002), and a
participant can choose how to be engaged and challenged
through the "flow of experience" (Falk & Dierking, 2002, p.
17) at a particular learning event.As in participating at exhib-
its, Falk and Dierking (2002) identify choice and control as
important elements of free-choice learning. Learner motiva-
tions in free-choice learning settings are related to learner
identity and can be "emotional sites of learning" (Parrish,
2010, p. 90). Free-choice learning involves informal learn-
ing, which may be seen as a broad category including any
form of learning that is neither formal nor nonformal
(Schugurensky, 2006).
Although informal learning often is identified as learning
for enrichment, several studies emphasize the importance of
informal learning in professional development (Berg &
Chyung, 2008; Grenier, 2009; Livingstone & Stowe, 2007;
Van der Heijden, Boon, van der Klink, & Meijs, 2009). In the
United States, Berg and Chyung (2008) found that informal
learning activities were more beneficial for practitioners'
knowledge acquisition of learning and performance improve-
ment than from formal training. Level of interest in one's
current field was the most significant indicator for engage-
ment in informal learning (Berg & Chyung, 2008). Grenier's
(2009) study of the professional development of 12 museum
docents employed at four history-themed museums found
that while formal training and continuing education were ini-
tially used, informal and incidental learning were cited as
important to the development of the expertise of docents.
This study serves an example of informal educational oppor-
tunities intersecting with continuing professional education
and demonstrating the importance of integrating informal
learning into the professional development of educators
(Grenier, 2009).
The free-choice learning within exhibits allows meaning
making with the aim of broadening the lens of learners.
Although there is the potential for creating communities of
understanding, these communities can be fragmented or
overlapped in complex ways in free-choice learning environ-
ments particularly related to international topics, which can
be controversial (Reece, 2005; Yelich Biniecki, 2015).Albert
(2013) challenges educators and researchers to constantly
question "Whose memory of the Holocaust?" (p. 56) is being
communicated within museums. Narratives about the
Holocaust are constructed within specific cultural, political,
and societal settings and are a mechanism to communicate
stories in particular socio-historical contexts (Albert, 2013).
Narratives
Narratives are one of the fundamental ways in which humans
make meaning (Bruner, 1986, 2002; Polkinghorne, 1988,
1996). "When we think of narratives we typically think of
stories, accounts of events that happened, to us or to others,
real or imagined" (Clark, 2001, p. 87). Humans tell stories
and use stories to make sense of the world and to make sense
of their own experiences (Clark, 2001; Clark & Rossiter,
2008; Rossiter & Clark, 2007). Through narratives, humans
are able to draw connections between different experiences
and make a more coherent understanding of those experi-
ences. Narratives are also deeply connected to our under-
standing of self and identity. As Rossiter (1999) explains,
"As we understand the world and our experiences narra-
tively, so also do we understand and construct the self as nar-
rative" (p. 62). Narrative understanding also is connected to
how we make sense of our experiences over time. People
make sense of their experiences and personal development
over the life course through personal narratives in which they
can see and reflect on changes (Clark & Rossiter, 2008).
Thus, narratives and stories are one of the main mechanisms
through which humans make sense of their life experiences.
If narratives are how we make meaning of social life and
experience, how do we learn from narratives? Clark and
Rossiter (2008) point to three parts involved in this process.
First is the hearing of stories. Stories not only "draw" us in
but require us to call upon past experiences to make sense of
the narrative we are currently hearing or reading. Second is
the telling of stories. In particular, the "learner" becomes the
actor, rather than the receiver of storytelling. In this regard,
the teller must learn the story to be able to tell it appropri-
ately. Finally, the third and probably most important element
of stories is how learners take a story, make sense of it, and
then use it. Clark and Rossiter (2008) refer to this as recog-
nizing stories, where learners begin to understand the funda-
mental narrative character of experiences. They begin to see
themselves as "constituted and narratively positioned" (Clark
& Rossiter, 2008, p. 65) within social and cultural contexts
where learners place their personal narratives in the larger
sociocultural narrative in which they exist. They can then
draw connections and make sense of how they as individuals
fit into the bigger picture. Spaces where learners can recog-
nize their "narrative situatedness" (Clark & Rossiter, 2008,
p. 66) within larger cultural and social narratives may be
Yelich Biniecki and Donley 3
particularly fruitful places for emancipatory possibilities and
learning. This positionality, or how one is individually and
socially situated within social systems, places learners in a
location in which they can be critical of larger narratives, and
question underlying assumptions and embedded power
relationships.
Meaning making with narratives in an exhibit is an inter-
active learning process (Polkinghorne, 1988) and can help
the learner specifically make meaning of individual and
social identities (Säljö, 2005). "Narratives also challenge
existing ways of thinking and thereby facilitate change and
development" (Glover Frykman, 2009, p. 318). Therefore,
narratives can be used to help participants imagine or place
themselves in a certain point in time and history and connect
to their current experiences. Grever, de Bruijn, and van
Boxtel (2012) propose that narratives on heritage education
exhibits, such as the transatlantic slave trade, are facilitators
in negotiating and mediating historical distance, "a configu-
ration of temporality and engagement" (p. 875). One could
view negotiating and mediating historical distance as a way
to engage with the past to make that history closer or less
"foreign," which involves reflection in learning.
Role of Reflection in Learning
Reflection is referred to as part of the process of constructing
self-knowledge (Eraut, 1994; Moon, 1999). For example,
memories are used to make meaning at exhibits (Afonso &
Gilbert, 2006). Moon (1999) describes the conceptualization
of reflection as bush-like with the first conceptualization of
reflection as a mental activity and then with many branches
of thinking about what reflection really is, what it encom-
passes, and what the theories have in common. Reflection
plays a role in learning (Hooper-Greenhill, 1999; Le Cornu,
2009; Moon, 1999). If one considers past experiences as
helping learners make sense of current experiences, then
reflection on these past experiences may play an important
role in learning. The ways learners construct knowledge and
why and how they reflect, for example, at an exhibit, are part
of the learning process and may be intricately connected to
the context of the learning.
Moon (1999) describes reflection as an input and output
model viewing the inputs to reflection as theories, con-
structed knowledge, or feelings. The outputs of reflection
may be diverse. For example, the process of learning may be
an output of reflection. Emotions may be an input and an
output of reflection (Dirkx, 2001, 2008; Moon, 1999).
Challenging assumptions and positions of power
(Brookfield, 1990) may be an output of reflection. Freire's
(2013) conscientization as part of learner empowerment and
emancipation may follow reflection. Self-development,
including self-awareness, which may include a perspective
transformation within groups or individuals (Mezirow,
1990), may involve reflection. Mezirow's (1990) taxonomy
of reflective thought focuses on the outcome of action and
depicts non-reflective action and reflective action. Reflection
in the context of deep learning suggests that a person has
some awareness of something being learned or new knowl-
edge constructed. However, Le Cornu (2005) suggests that
reflection may be surface, deep, or tacit and that reflection
may involve a progressive internalization or externalization
in the forms of action. Reflection informs the development
of the self, relating to one's identity (Le Cornu, 2009), and
this identity development and meaning making can be an
emotional learning process (Dirkx, 2008). Often viewed as
barriers to learning in the past, emotions may be a facilitator
of learning (Dirkx, 2008).
Holocaust museums are noted as "agents of change"
(Grenier, 2010, p. 573) with regard to how they challenge
and prompt critical reflection and transformative learning,
including within areas of human resource development such
as the military, law enforcement, medical communities, and
leadership training. Gauging interpretations, learning, and
reflections in such museums remains a challenge because of
the dynamic nature of the informal learning environment
(Ciardelli & Wasserman, 2011). Connecting the past with
current ethical and moral dilemmas is part of the reflection
and learning process in Holocaust museums (Albert, 2013).
The Holocaust and the Righteous Among the
Nations of the World
Each context of free-choice learning provides a different
dimension to explore; particularly, Holocaust education is an
important context where we can learn about participants'
perceptions of learning and their meaning making of current,
historical, ethical, and moral challenges (Grenier, 2010).
Coming to power in Germany in January 1933, the Nazis
believed that Germans were racially superior and identified
groups, including Jews, the disabled, sexual minorities,
Roma, and others to be targeted for persecution and extermi-
nation (United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.).
The Nazi­German regime and collaborators systematically
persecuted and murdered 6 million Jews, the Holocaust
(United States Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.). It is esti-
mated that the Nazis and collaborators murdered at least 3
million Jewish citizens of Poland and 1.9 million non-Jewish
Polish civilians during World War II (WWII) (United States
Holocaust Memorial Museum, n.d.). Enslaving Slavic peo-
ples also was an aspect of the Nazi­German ideology. Within
areas of resistance in occupied Poland, Nazis engaged in ran-
dom killings and mass deportations (United States Holocaust
Memorial Museum, n.d.). It is within this life-threatening,
horrific context that Jewish resisters and Gentile Righteous
Among the Nations acted. Yad Vashem: The World Center
for Holocaust Research (n.d.), states,
In Eastern Europe, the Germans executed not only the people
who sheltered Jews, but their entire family as well . . . Only few
assumed the entire responsibility for the Jews' survival. It is
4 SAGE Open
mostly the last group that qualifies for the title of the Righteous
Among the Nations. (para. 6, 10)
Although Holocaust education is not a new area of
inquiry, this study's exploration focuses on free-choice
learning through exhibits highlighting Poles deemed the
"The Righteous Among the Nations of the World" by the
State of Israel. Hidden stories of Polish resistance and
Righteous Among the Nations in Poland and other Central
and Eastern European countries were not discussed during
Communist rule (1945-1989) because resistance of any
kind was not to be tolerated under the authoritarian regime
and ideology (Institute of National Remembrance, n.d.).
The Institute of National Remembrance, a Polish academic,
archive, and education center, strives to document these
stories and other crimes against Poland, but this documen-
tation often is challenging due to the complexity of such
data collection.
Holocaust education is an important context to explore as
the Holocaust is an event unique to human history and after
which the term genocide was formally used at the United
Nations in addressing crimes against humanity. As there are
fewer survivors, we will need to rely on exhibits, stories,
films, and other ways of sharing to continue to document and
tell these stories. Communities with less religious, ethnic,
and national origin diversity may have less of an opportunity
for face-to-face engagement with diversity and related inter-
national issues. Therefore, the context of our study provides
an important area to explore learners' meaning making at
programs to better inform program planning and improve
strategies for learner engagement.
The focus of this study is not without controversy, and
researchers often struggle to make meaning of their own
experiences and ethics related to Holocaust education
(Tinberg, 2005). Emphasizing rescuers may be viewed as
overshadowing the evil of the perpetrators and bystanders as
well as portraying Jews as passive victims. We as researchers
found ourselves questioning the complexity of our position-
alities, which is noted as a process for educators in Holocaust
education (Lindquist, 2010). Although most participants
communicated feeling horrified by learning more about the
Holocaust, a local news network received one anti-Semitic
and anti-Polish response about an exhibit, which was a focus
of this study. To know these responses continue to exist,
underscores to us that Holocaust education is an important
area of remembrance and learning.
In a global study, the Anti-Defamation League (2014)
documented that 46% of the respondents had never heard of
the Holocaust, with the percentage of 23% in the Americas.
Incorporating narratives and uncovering stories are part of
Holocaust education (Parrish, 2010). Therefore, our aim
within the study is not to create a "competition over suffer-
ing" (Milerski, 2010, p. 120), or to negate the suffering of
any group, but to understand learning through this inquiry of
an international education context in which additional
studies are needed to further the field (Taylor, 2012; Yelich
Biniecki 2015).
This study aims to explore meaning making through the
lenses of free-choice learning, narratives, reflection, and
Holocaust education, with a specific focus on the Righteous
Among the Nations of the World from Poland. Investigating
learner meaning making of the RighteousAmong the Nations
exhibits within the pubic space of a library in a rural com-
munity can inform public pedagogy work within the realm of
international education in settings across the United States
such as the one we explore in this study.
Method
This qualitative interpretive study focused on understanding
how individuals made meaning about their experiences as
participants in free-choice learning at exhibits focusing on
the Righteous Among the Nations. In a basic, qualitative
interpretive study, the researcher "attempts to discover and
understand a phenomenon, process, the perspectives, and
worldviews of people involved, or a combination of these"
(Merriam, 2002, p. 6). To understand participants' meaning
making, we interviewed 11 individuals who attended pro-
grams at Midwestern University that centered on the role of
Polish non-Jews who risked their lives to save Jews during
the Holocaust. The programs consisted of the Righteous
Among the Nations exhibit and the Jan Karski exhibit.
The exhibits were located in the main floor of the univer-
sity's library and were set up as open panel displays in which
individuals could freely walk through at their own pace. The
first exhibit displayed panels with pictures and texts detail-
ing the stories of Polish Gentiles (given the titles of Righteous
Among the Nations of the World) and Polish Jews. The nar-
ratives depicted the historical context of Nazi­German occu-
pied Poland during WWII including the stories of the rescuers
and the rescued as well as their fates. For example, life sto-
ries of Polish Gentiles and Jews were described including
photos of hiding spaces and narratives of courage depicting
how individuals and families risked their lives to aid others,
sometimes resulting in their execution.
The second exhibit depicted the life story of one man, Jan
Karski, who risked his life as a member of the Polish
Underground resistance to gather intelligence about Nazi­
German atrocities committed against Jews, write reports, and
impel Western leaders to intervene, which they did not (Jan
Karski Educational Foundation, n.d.). Part of the narrative of
the exhibit described how Karski was smuggled into the
Warsaw Ghetto and a concentration camp near Lublin. His
photographic memory and firsthand account of the crimes
against humanity he witnessed were central to the narrative
depicted in the exhibits as well as his journey through life
after WWII.
The researchers' subjectivities are important to describe
as it is through our lenses the data were analyzed (Sultana,
2007). The first researcher is from outside the state in which
Yelich Biniecki and Donley 5
the exhibit was held and identifies as a member of the Polish
American heritage community. She has worked and lived in
Poland and visits Poland annually. The second researcher is
from the area and identifies as American.
At the end of each exhibit, participants were given an
opportunity to provide feedback on comment cards. Sorting
comment cards and identifying themes related to our main
research question provided the first stage of data analysis,
which we organized through concept mapping, a visual orga-
nization process to organize data and view interrelationships
between themes (Novak, 2010; Wheeldon & Faubert, 2009).
The comment cards also provided an opportunity for exhibit
attendees to indicate if they were interested in participating
in a study associated with the exhibit and provide a space to
give their contact information. The second author sent emails
to those individuals detailing the study and asking for volun-
teers. We used convenience sampling to access participants
and, therefore, are unable to generalize our findings beyond
our own study. Similarly, there are limitations to the repre-
sentativeness of our sample. Our sample is drawn from per-
sons who attended the exhibit and left their contact
information on the comment cards. Thus, we did not have
access and did not interview individuals who attended the
exhibit but did not comment on comment cards or leave con-
tact information. Eleven respondents composed the final
sample recruited for this study. Table 1 depicts participant
characteristics as they identified and described themselves.
Participants included 11 women and one male; all were
associated with the town's university in some capacity as
either student or employee. The demographics of partici-
pants are unsurprising given the social context in which this
study is situated: a mainly White, small, college town in the
Midwest.
Participants were interviewed by the second author.
Interviews took place at the location of the participant's choos-
ing (student union, coffee shops, the second author's office)
and were audio-recorded with the permission of the partici-
pant. Through a semi-structured interview guide (Creswell,
2014), participants were asked about their experiences in the
exhibits, what they remembered most, about their learning
styles, how they used what they learned at the exhibit, and
how they made sense of their experience at the exhibit.
Following data collection, the interviews were transcribed ver-
batim by an outside transcriber and analyzed by both the first
and the second authors.
In the first round of coding, both authors thoroughly read
through the interview data and openly coded (Miles &
Huberman, 1994) the data for relevant themes and common-
alities pertinent to the research question: How did learners
make meaning of their experiences as participants at exhibits
focusing on the Righteous Among the Nations of the World?
Matrices were then developed to put order on the initial
themes (Miles & Huberman, 1994). In the second round of
coding, the authors further refined their initial codes through
the use of the matrices with categories such as: "things most
remembered from exhibits", "how used knowledge", "us
versus them", and "hidden stories". Trustworthiness of the
study was maintained through such strategies as maintaining
notes and comments about the interaction with the data,
meeting throughout the analysis process in face-to-face
meetings or via video conference to co-check meaning mak-
ing, and providing participants with opportunities for feed-
back on transcripts (Creswell, 2014).
Findings: The "Web" of Learning
About Righteous Among the Nations
Our findings identified three main mechanisms in which par-
ticipants "made sense" of their experiences at the Righteous
Among the Nations and Jan Karski exhibits: through emo-
tions, being challenged, and broadening awareness. The fol-
lowing four participant stories were chosen to depict the
interrelationship between the ways in which participants
made sense of learning about this topic.
Nancy, a dance professor, teaches at the same Midwestern
University where the exhibits were held and attended both of
the programs. She attended the programs because of her life-
long interest in Holocaust history. During her attendance,

Nancy was struck by the personal stories of the Polish Gentile
families who helped Polish Jewish families escape. She com-
ments on how she felt uncomfortable around the Poles dur-
ing the event. Nancy draws connections between the program
and contemporary global conflicts happening in the Middle
East and Ukraine. Particularly, she wonders why it is that
these conflicts between ethnic or religious groups continue
to happen over the course of history. Following the program,
she speaks with her husband about how the program rein-
forced the importance of being aware of global issues and
conflicts.
Gail,adoctoralstudentatthesameMidwesternUniversity,
attended the first program. Her main reason for attending the
program was because of her interest in "hidden stories"
throughout history, particularly those about WWII. Gail also
has a grandfather who was a solider in WWII. She was most
struck by the unfolding narratives and the pictures of the
families of the rescuers and the rescued when participating in
the program; particularly she wondered what other hidden
stories were out there that we do not know about. Gail con-
nected her experience at the program to her own work as an
educator. She sees hidden stories as a potentially useful
learning tool in the classroom.
Ola also attended both of the programs. She was inter-
ested in attending the program because she is Polish and
lived most of her life in Poland. Both of the stories presented
at each program are not unfamiliar topics for Ola. As a young
child, she learned about these events while attending school
in Poland. Revisiting these stories through her participation
in each program made Ola proud of her Polish heritage. She
felt especially proud when recounting her experience at the
programs with Polish friends after she attended the exhibits.
Thalia is 65-year-old, retired woman, and she attended the
first program and a corresponding play associated with
Righteous Among the Nations of the World. She had two
main reasons for attending the programs. First, she said she
was immediately interested in it because she is Jewish and
she recalled how there are not a lot of programs about the
Holocaust offered in her city of residence. Second, she
attended the programs because she was interested to see how
Poland and Polish people's roles in WWII were going to be
portrayed in the exhibit. Thalia concluded that her experi-
ence with the program added to her knowledge about
Poland's role in the world, particularly that there were "good"
Poles who aided Jewish families escaping the Holocaust,
which was inconsistent with her previous perspective that
Poland did not help much during WWII.
These four examples demonstrate the often complicated
and interrelated ways in which participants communicated
they make sense of learning in Holocaust education contexts.
Specifically, one respondent, Nancy, described learning and
the interconnections between these meaning making mecha-
nisms like a "spider web." She said, "There's an intersection
here, and an intersection there, and they might not seem like
they directly relate, but if you follow the web around, they
are connected." This web becomes evident when analyzing
participants' stories about how they made meaning of their
attendance of the Righteous Among the Nations programs.
The topic intersected, for example, with a participant's iden-
tity, international issues, and emotions.
In the remainder of this section, we focus on answering
our overarching research question: How did learners make
meaning of their experiences at exhibits depicting narratives
of the Righteous Among the Nations of the World? We
explore these mechanisms--emotions, being challenged,
and broadening awareness--in greater detail and how they
are related to meaning making of the Righteous Among the
Nations exhibits.
Through Emotions
One of the main mechanisms through which people made
sense of their participation in the exhibits was emotions.
They described "being moved" or being "emotional" during
their learning. Participants communicated emotions from
sad, to angry, to hopeful in the same learning process.
Participants described trying to imagine the horror, sad-
ness, and pain around for one to take such action to save
others when one could have opted only to save oneself.
Questions included "Could I be brave?" and "Could I have
the courage to save others under such circumstances?" Lilly
examined her beliefs as a Christian and asked, "Would I rise
to the occasion?" This was a rather common response to the
program during interviews with participants and many asked,
"Could I do this?" Some also provided answers to these
questions; they did not know if they would be able to per-
form some of these heroic acts they read about, but hoped
they would be able. By asking these hard questions of them-
selves and in some cases providing answers, participants
make sense of narratives by imagining themselves in the
shoes of the Polish Gentile families to reflect on whether
they would be capable of doing similar things under similar
circumstances. Participants not only asked questions about
themselves in relation to the narratives but also more gener-
ally about human nature.
Gail, who attended the Righteous Among the Nations pro-
gram, reflected more generally on the role of the Polish
Gentile families:
It's amazing how much people were willing to risk for total
strangers. Some of them had a connection, but most of them had
no connection to these people and yet they died for them. I
think it teaches something really fundamental about the
potential for goodness in people; it also teaches [us about] the
potential for evil.
Like Lilly and Valerie, Gail was amazed at what others could
do for complete strangers. Empathy was one of the biggest
emotions identified in participants' reflections on their expe-
rience in the programs. Gail also empathized with the Polish
Yelich Biniecki and Donley 7
Gentile families who helped the Polish Jewish families for
being willing to risk it all to save them. She concludes, again,
by asking hard questions about human nature and good and
evil. She identified that human goodness and evilness could
exist, which she saw as a useful lesson.
Participants also described feeling empathy for the survi-
vors they read about. Valerie said, "It (the exhibit) definitely
makes me empathize with the survivors . . . How they wanna
forget and I don't wanna acknowledge it. I feel that's kind of
repetitive." She explained that she did not want to even think
about the fact that "the Holocaust could have happened." It
was difficult to "be in tune with the emotions behind it."
Valerie described feeling empathy with Holocaust survivors
in how she understood how it might be easier to forget
because of the emotional pain remembering can cause.
Valerie's reflection was somewhat different from the major-
ity of other participants, because she identified how difficult
telling and remembering these stories can be for survivors
and how that might lead to wanting to forget rather than
remember these events. Valerie's account suggests how chal-
lenging participating in this program was for participants in
a multitude of other ways.
Being Challenged
Participants expressed empathy, but for some, empathetic
feelings also brought a sense of challenge because it took
them "outside of our cultural bubble." Participants described
feeling challenged because they had previously not known of
the stories of the Polish Gentile families saving the Polish
Jewish families. Some felt guilty they had not learned about
the Righteous Among the Nations earlier and that through
narratives, this was the first time they had really started
learning about these individuals. Rhonda was "surprised"
that she had not heard of Jan Karski in high school history.
This "surprise" was common among other participants as
well. For example, some participants described these stories
as hidden to them. This feeling of surprise served as an
important starting point for meaning making. Madeline, a
college student in elementary education, attended because it
was required for class, but she stayed much longer than
required because she found the narratives of the exhibit inter-
esting. Her younger sister's friend attended with her.
Madeline said that she learned, "There are a lot of invisible
stories." Valerie, a sophomore in college, heard about the
exhibit from her history professor and she remembered that
it had been in New York City prior to coming to the library
on campus. She described the stories at the exhibit taking her
"outside of our cultural bubble" and she felt that the exhibit
was important to push people outside of that bubble. Ola and
Piotr described feeling appreciative of the exhibit educating
others about their cultural history; however, all other partici-
pants described being "pushed out of the cultural bubble" as
a part of their participation, which made them feel uncom-
fortable and challenged them in a multitude of ways.
In addition to the content of the program challenging par-
ticipants' "cultural bubbles," sharing space during the pro-
gram with individuals of various cultural backgrounds also
was challenging for some participants. Within the same pro-
gram, Nancy said,
There were a lot of Polish people there which was fun, since I've
never been to Poland it was fun to speak to them, but they are a
little clannish . . . I haven't been to Europe in about 10--12 years
so I forgot this, this "you're not us" thing. But it's okay, people
are who they are.
In this community, Nancy wanted to learn about "the others"
and came to learn about diversity and tolerance, but felt chal-
lenged to socially be around "the others" in a real, physical
space. She expressed curiosity and discomfort by the diversity
of people in attendance of the program, which she attributed to
not regularly being around other languages or those unlike her.
Other participants experienced similar reactions, and their
social identities came to the forefront during their participation
in the program. Thalia felt she was challenged by two points: as
a member of the Jewish community, "There are good people
wherever you go, so I was pleased that the good Polish people
were getting some recognition and I was also pleased that
Poland was recognizing the significance of its role . . ."
However, she also said, "I'm a little concerned that they are
suddenly going to try to say that Poland did a good job, because
they didn't in general do a good job. But significantly wonder-
ful people did a wonderful job." Throughout her interview,
Thalia seemed challenged by her reflection on rescuers,
bystanders, victims, and the context of oppression in which
they co-existed. She said that she did see Poles at the event, but
she hesitated to go and introduce herself. Therefore, moments
encountering the other at the event were part of the challenge
that intersected with the content of the exhibit. Thalia's descrip-
tion of her experience also explores how her social location as
a Jewish person and her perception of Poland's role in WWII
shaped her meaning making of the program.
Broadening Awareness
The final way in which participants described making sense
of the programs was through feeling an increased awareness
and feeling as if their "eyes were opened" or opened a little
wider. This increasing awareness also was connected to the
idea of the "hidden" stories displayed in narratives. Many
respondents identified that they had not previously known
about the stories, and through their participation in the exhib-
its, they increased their knowledge or gained greater insight
about the Holocaust. Madeline shared she thought that con-
tinually acknowledging these stories and keeping informed
does not let us forget. She said,
I think recognizing that those things are so real and that they
happened. Just getting to see the pictures and actually the list of
names (those who saved people, who were killed because of it,
8 SAGE Open
and people who were saved), which you could look at the names
and just walk over them, and ignore them, not even thinking
about them, but if you actually think of all the lives, all those
people touched, just being able to think back and realize that's
not just a story you read in a history book.
By participating in the exhibit, Madeline talked about how
these stories that she learned about in history books through-
out her lifetime became more humanized. Through the pho-
tos and narratives provided in the programs, some participants
described feeling much more connected to the stories. The
stories became more "real" to them.
Others identified developing an awareness about their
own privileges as Americans. Participants drew comparisons
between the privileges afforded to people in the United States
that others in different locations may not have. For instance,
Wanda spoke about how many of the people in the world do
not have the freedoms available to those in the United States.
Similarly, Nancy, a university professor, spoke on the same
issue but in more detail:
We are in such a fortunate climate of freedom. I don't think we
are teaching people what the cost of freedom is; what the value
of freedom is and what you have to do to maintain it. When you
are upset about something--do you write your representative?
Do you protest? Do you understand that you are not shot when
you protest? [I am] Concerned we are becoming a country of
mushballs and self-centered whiners. People do not have the
easy life we do.
Nancy was very critical of what she saw in current U.S. cul-
ture as political complacency, apathy, and being uninformed
about the surrounding world. For some of the participants in
this research, attending such a harrowing exhibit on the
atrocities of the Holocaust served as a reminder to be aware
of what is going on around you, to not be complacent, and be
a concerned, informed citizen.
Others acknowledged that attending this program rein-
forced the idea that as individuals, it is our responsibility to
be aware of what happened in the past as well as what is
going on today. Valerie said that she felt "more attuned to the
suffering happening now . . . We can't forget about history;
we can't forget about the things that are going on internation-
ally." Thalia said, "It's terribly important that we not stop
talking about it." Piotr said he thought that there was a
"break" in Holocaust education in the United States and that
"We still have to work on those issues; basically it's impor-
tant for the human rights and humanity." Thalia said the par-
ticipation further ignited feelings for her to continue to share
information about the Holocaust so that it cannot be repeated.
She said,
You know, it becomes more important for exhibits like this to
happen, for people to understand that this was a reality and it
wasn't just 6 million Jews, it was 3 million other people that
they killed, so if you were gay, or handicapped, or gypsy, I mean
they murdered a lot of people. It's so important that these things
be brought to our university for the next generation because I'm
afraid that they are going to try and say that it didn't happen.
Thalia's response communicated a sense of urgency to con-
tinue to tell these stories presently and capture them for
future generations. Participants' interviews emphasized their
ideas of the importance of being aware of what was going on
in the world: past, present, and future. Through this program,
participants learned things they did not know, criticized
unawareness about historical and present international con-
ditions, and recognized the importance of continuing to
spread awareness about the Holocaust and other similar
issues by sharing stories like Righteous Among the Nations
of the World and Jan Karski.
Discussion and Implications
This study further informs our understanding of meaning
making in free-choice learning contexts. In particular, the
study suggests ways in which we might further bridge dis-
tance in international education exhibits focusing on human
rights and human conflict. Hidden stories within exhibits and
fostering learning around those stories are complex pro-
cesses. In this study, the exhibits were held in the middle of a
nationally identified conservative state in a rural area with a
majority White population, a very small Polish population,
and a very small Jewish population, of which some partici-
pants belonged to both social groups. The diversity repre-
sented in the exhibit on multiple levels is also hidden or
non-existent within daily life for the majority of the popula-
tion. Falk and Dierking (2002) identify participants' choice
and control as important elements of free-choice learning,
such as learning at exhibits. This study's findings suggest
that we may wish to identify additional prompts and support
for meaning making within that physical space of the exhib-
its to help learners identify these choices.
For example, participants at the Righteous Among the
Nations exhibits reflected upon "what would I do" as it
related to current ethical and moral dilemmas (Albert, 2013).
This reflection also accompanied emotions such as sorrow,
anger, and hope, which may be facilitators of learning and an
input into the meaning making process (Dirkx, 2001, 2008)
and a space connecting learning and emotion (Parrish, 2010).
Participants described the exhibits providing a connector in
fostering empathy and challenges within the learning pro-
cess. Therefore, participants' interviews suggest that in their
cases, historical distance was bridged as Grever et al. (2012)
and Ciardelli and Wasserman (2011) discuss in their work,
which is an important aim in such exhibits. Participants dis-
cussed the exhibit prompting a reflection on the need to work
on current humanitarian issues in the present. However,
interviews suggest that this historical distance perhaps was
not bridged within the space of the exhibit itself. When
pressed to be in a shared, benign space like a library with
Yelich Biniecki and Donley 9
"the other," some participants expressed feeling challenged
to do so and even seemed unaware in interviews that they
spoke intolerantly of "the other." For example, Nancy, an
assistant professor, was in a shared space to learn about
diversity and tolerance, yet seemed uncomfortable and even
made othering comments about Poles in her interview. If
such exhibits aim at prompting deeper critical reflection,
educators may ask what other kind of prompts could be pro-
vided to foster this reflection. Such prompts might include
questions at the end of the exhibit focusing on social identi-
ties in communities and social justice, resources or links if
participants would like to learn more, and ways of continu-
ing to stay involved in the issues of focus.
Participants described being challenged through the nar-
ratives of rescuers and victims they read at the exhibit (Clark
& Rossiter, 2008; Glover Frykman, 2009). Their reflection
was situated within multiple cultural identities, such as
national, ethnic, religious, and professional within different
socially prescribed values of power. For example, Ola and
Piotr described appreciating that the topic focused on the his-
tory of their ethnic group was receiving attention. Thalia was
challenged by feeling othered at the event and in the process
of reflecting on her tension of discovering the "good" Poles,
did not know what to do when she saw Poles talking at the
event. And, U.S. citizens seemed to feel shocked that they
did not know about aspects of the topic. For U.S.-born par-
ticipants, this appreciation of the space of the United States
often was "safe" and "better" as participants struggled with
trying to come to terms with other ways of thinking about
national origin and identity. Therefore, educators may find
challenges and tension between this appreciative reflection
(Le Cornu, 2009) and critical reflection (Mezirow, 1990)
within these shared spaces on multiple levels. Although none
of the individuals discussed talking to each other, each had
an interest in "the other" which they indicated in through
descriptions of empathy and challenging. The learning
described involved a tension or symbiotic relationships
between the appreciative and the critical reflection. The
prompts which could be provided to bridge historical dis-
tance might also provide further ways of developing critical
media literacy about current events and engagement. For
example, using prompts to examine community relations in
the communities in which one resides could provide addi-
tional connectors for participants. Virtual privilege walks
could be added to supplement exhibits and ask participants to
examine their positionalities. Questions as simple as "Who
do you eat with at work or school?" and "Who would you ask
to drive you to the airport?" can provide points of reflection
about how we decide who matters.
Free-choice learning has been noted as a powerful profes-
sional development connector for leaders, teachers, and stu-
dents (Grenier, 2009) as the narratives here suggest. The
study also suggests that providing avenues to further interro-
gate our positionalities (Lindquist, 2010) and the positionali-
ties of such exhibits within our environments may deepen
professional development. Free-choice learning programs
can be an input into professional development, and interna-
tional education exhibits may provide very important spaces
to do so. Although professionals such as educators partici-
pated in the exhibit, additional organization around fostering
specific professional and continuing education could be
incorporated for concrete learning objectives within multiple
disciplines thereby increasing awareness of the topic as well
as connecting to formal educational goals. In addition, all par-
ticipants interviewed were members of the university com-
munity, which also may indicate the need to examine outreach
initiatives to engage communities beyond the "cultural bub-
ble" of the campus. Additional questions connected to inter-
group, on-site observations, and daily life might be helpful.
Free-choice learning in international education, particu-
larly of human conflict, provides opportunities for reflection
to negotiate and mediate historical distance to engage with
the past to make that history closer or less "foreign." This
learning and reflection may also be a connector to foster inter-
est in learning more about communities in which we live.
Whether the exhibit is focusing on Sudan, Syria, or Ukraine,
diverse heritage and diaspora communities of multiple and
intersecting identities may be learners and participants within
a shared space. Learning and reflection for diverse communi-
ties is multifaceted. Through understanding the complexity of
meaning making, we can better plan and facilitate programs
within Righteous Among the Nations and Holocaust exhibits
as well as other international free-choice learning contexts.
Our research demonstrates the complexity of meaning
making that takes place when engaging in international edu-
cation, free-choice learning settings. Future research should
continue to investigate meaning making processes across
diverse learning contexts. Similarly, our sample is mostly
White of U.S. nation origin and undisclosed ethnicities and
religions. Future research should attempt to address the limi-
tations of this research by incorporating more racially and
ethnically diverse participants. Despite the respective limita-
tion, it is also important to acknowledge that there are many
communities across the United States that share similar char-
acteristics with our study context: a nationally identified
conservative state in a rural area with a majority White, U.S.-
born population; therefore, exploring meaning making with
the public pedagogy of exhibits such as the RighteousAmong
the Nations may inform how these exhibits are part of facili-
tating learning in areas with little cultural diversity and where
face-to-face interaction with "the other" may happen in those
public spaces.
