Community Partnerships: Experiences From the
Robert Wood Johnson Foundation's Community
Partnerships for Older Adults Program

Purpose: This article describes early efforts of four
community partnerships in Boston, El Paso, Houston,
and Milwaukee to address governance and manage-
ment structures in ways that promote the sustainability
of innovative community-based long-term care system
improvements. The four communities are grantees of the
Community Partnerships for Older Adults Program,
a national initiative of the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation that fosters local partnerships to improve
long-term care and supportive-services systems in order
to meet the current and future needs of older adults.
Design and Methods: We examined community partner-
ship approaches to governance and management, as
well as evidence of the partnerships' influence in their
communities, by using the conceptual framework of the
community health partnerships typology developed by
Shannon M. Mitchell and Stephen Shortell. Results:
Addressing governance and management issues was
critical to the early evolution of community partnerships
for older adults. Early partnership experiences, particu-
larly with regard to local funders and media, provide
evidence of emerging centrality (importance and in-
fluence in the community), which forecasts sustainability.
Observation over a longer period is needed in order to
see whether early successes will be sustained, particu-
larly once original grant funding ends. Implications:
Community partnerships for older adults can become
influential positive forces but must invest in adequate
governance and management structures early on.
Key Words: Community partnerships,
Partnership governance, Partnership management,
Partnership sustainability, Long-term care systems
Community Partnerships for Older Adults
(CPFOA), a national program of the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, was created in order to improve
long-term care and supportive-services systems for
older adults through local community-based partner-
ships. CPFOA seeks to strengthen local service-delivery
infrastructure for the coming age boom by supporting
partnerships that typically include older adults, health
and social service providers, Area Agencies on Aging,
government and business leaders, and local funders.
Researchers expect that the work undertaken by these
partnerships will expand social capital and increase
communities' sense of collective efficacy (Bolda, Lowe,
Maddox, & Patnaik, 2005). CPFOA partnerships are
designed to illustrate how collaborative efforts in
diverse communities can generate social capital in
order to improve access to affordable quality care for
older adults through sensitive response to the needs of
diverse populations, good ideas about care that can be
improved through the cooperation of diverse service
Several of the examples in this article were first presented at ``A
Framework for Learning With and About Community Partnerships,''

Gerontological Society of America, November 21, 2004, in Washington,
DC. Panelists were Elise J. Bolda, Muskie School of Public Service,

organizations, and, importantly, encouragement of
civic participation in making decisions about meeting
community needs. Participation in partnerships, in fact,
constitutes an important initial experience of organ-
izations in finding commonalities in community values,
in identifying new community leadership, and in
experiencing the enhanced effectiveness of organiza-
tions that choose to emphasize commitment to shared
community objectives. Grantee communities also have
committed to national dissemination of their experi-
ences in order to help other communities across the
country develop and expand partnerships working on
behalf of older adults.
In 2004, the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
awarded 8 community partnerships with 4-year im-
plementation grants of $750,000 each to support
implementation of community strategic plans that
had been prepared in an earlier planning cycle. The
eight communities were: Atlanta, GA; Boston, MA;
Broome County, NY; El Paso, TX; Harris County, TX;
Maui, HI; Milwaukee County, WI; and San Francisco,
CA. Each community brought to the national program
a unique sociodemographic and historical context, and
each community had developed its own goals and
objectives through a local planning process. Neverthe-
less, all grantees had a common goal of sustaining their
efforts beyond the grant period.
The National Program Office at the Muskie School
of Public Service, University of Southern Maine,
provides program direction. The Duke University
Long-Term Care Resources Program oversees technical
assistance to grantees and facilitates cross-site dissem-
ination through teaching and learning, in which
grantees are encouraged to take progressively increas-
ing responsibility for sharing expertise and learning
among themselves and with other communities. The
program uses various approaches in order to foster
teaching and learning. These include frequent tele-
conferences; annual in-person meetings of all grantees;
an interactive Web site through which grantees can
engage in virtual discussion and post resources for
one another; an electronic resource center
(www.cpfoa.org), where experience is codified for the
benefit of others; and ad hoc grantee gatherings at
meetings of national associations, such as The Geron-
tological Society of America, the National Association
of Area Agencies on Aging, and the American Society
on Aging/National Council on the Aging.
Conceptual Framework
Early on, CPFOA introduced grantee partnerships to
a conceptual framework of community health part-
nerships developed by Mitchell and Shortell (2000).
After an exhaustive literature review, Mitchell and
Shortell concluded that (a) despite the growing
popularity of community health partnerships, they
often fail to achieve measurable results or sustain
themselves; and (b) problems related to governance and
management frequently contribute to their failure.
Mitchell and Shortell (2000, p. 243) described gov-
ernance of community partnerships ``as being primarily
concerned with positioning the partnership relative to
the external environment within which it operates.''
Governance includes establishing a partnership's stra-
tegic priorities, determining membership composition,
obtaining necessary resources, and providing account-
ability to the community. Mitchell and Shortell de-
scribed management as being concerned primarily with
execution or implementation of the direction estab-
lished by the governance body of a partnership.
Management functions include managing communica-
tion, conflict, external links, and change over time.
A significant challenge for community partnerships
is understanding that the ``right'' governance and
management structures are not universal. They are
highly contextual and must fit the history, social dy-
namics, politics, and resources of a given community.
In a community that enjoys a long tradition of suc-
cessful collaboration in the context of informal gov-
ernance structures, a more formal structure may fail
because it does not honor tradition. However, if that
community partnership were trying to address a more
difficult and controversial problem than it ever had in
the past, it may need to adopt a more formal structure
that is easily understood in the community and
enhances accountability.
If a partnership adopts effective governance and
management structures appropriate to its local context,
it is more likely to attain centrality, which Mitchell and
Shortell (2000, p. 253) defined as the extent to which
a partnership ``becomes institutionalized and pivotal to
the life of the community.'' Centrality, in turn, is a likely
predictor of sustainability. As applied to CPFOA grant-
ees, the expectation is that as a partnership becomes
central to its community on aging issues, its visibility
and influence rise and more stakeholders want to be
associated with the partnership, further adding to its
influence and expanding the sense of collective efficacy in
the community. Furthermore, it is expected that local
funders and decision makers will pay increasing at-
tention to the partnership as a vehicle for effective
collaboration as the partnership's centrality increases.
This article describes how four CPFOA grantees,
like community health partnerships before them, have
struggled with issues of governance and management
and have responded by adopting governance and
management structures unique to their local needs.
We should note that this is not a comprehensive case
study, but rather a brief analysis of early experiences
of selected CPFOA grantees. At this early phase of
the grant cycle, each partnership can point to early
indicators of centrality, suggesting that sustainability is
an attainable goal.
Overview of Four Grantees
CPFOA implementation grantees shared certain
mandatory characteristics in order to be selected by
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation. They each re-
presented broad community partnerships that included
older adults, social service and health providers, gov-
ernment agencies, advocacy organizations, and other
local stakeholders in long-term care and supportive
392 The Gerontologist
services. They had each demonstrated success working
in partnership prior to becoming grantees, and their
communities each had in place adequate community-
based services infrastructure that served as a foundation
for greater partnership efforts. Each grantee had to
select a fiscal agent to accept and manage grant funds
for the partnership, and each partnership had to
designate a core leadership group.
Beyond these requirements, CPFOA was designed to
encourage unique local partnerships that responded to
the needs of their communities. The result was a group
of grantees with a variety of approaches to governance
and management. We have drawn examples from four
diverse grantee communities in order to illustrate the
range. Representatives from the four partnerships
(Boston, Harris County, Milwaukee County, and El
Paso) presented their early experiences in a Presidential
Symposium at the 57th Annual Scientific Meeting of
The Gerontological Society of America, November 21,
2004, in Washington, DC. We have based this article on
that panel discussion (``A Framework for Learning
With and About Community Partnerships'') and on
additional information gathered by the CPFOA Na-
tional Program Office through site visits, technical
assistance teleconferences, reports and materials sub-
mitted by partnerships, grantee extranet postings, and
individual conversations with partnership leaders.
A Diverse Group of Communities
Table 1 provides an overview of the four community
partnerships and illustrates the unique characteristics
of each.
Boston is one of the nation's oldest cities, with
a formal social services infrastructure dating back to
colonial alms houses. This city of 16 distinct neigh-
borhoods is well known for its lively politics and fierce
competition among provider agencies. The city is
culturally diverse, with more than half of its population
identifying with one of several minority groups. The
city is small geographically (48.4 square miles) and has
an extensive public transportation system that makes it
relatively easy to live in the city without a car. Harris
County is huge by comparison, encompassing the city
of Houston (the nation's fourth largest city) and 40
additional municipalities in a geographic area the size
of Rhode Island with relatively little public trans-
portation infrastructure. Harris County also enjoys rich
ethnic and cultural diversity, particularly among
younger residents. Most of the county's older residents
are White. Social service agencies operate largely
independently of one another, with little history of
formal partnership. Nearly 700 miles to the west is El
Paso, a relatively poor and geographically isolated
border city with Mexico to the south and New Mexico
to the north. El Paso's SALSA partnership (Successful
Aging through Long-term Strategic Alliances) reflects
the demographics of the area, where two thirds of older
adults are Hispanic/Latino, and an unknown number
are Mexican immigrants with questionable legal status.
Having operated for many years in what partnership
leaders describe as a ``culture of need,'' El Paso
community organizations have a long history of
informal collaboration to stretch thin resources. In
Milwaukee County, the county government plays
a much more active role in the financing and delivery
of services than do the local governments in the other
three partnerships. Milwaukee is Wisconsin's largest
and most diverse urban county, comprising the city of
Milwaukee and 18 suburban municipalities. The
county has for many years led and participated in
multiple collaborative efforts and has naturally evolved
to a decentralized model of partnership in which the
locus of control depends on the specific activity. Like
Boston, the city of Milwaukee is often characterized
as a collection of distinct neighborhoods, and politics
are often rough and tumble.
Governing a Community Partnership
One of the functions of governance is to establish the
size and composition of the partnership, which includes
determining the type of organizations and individuals
desired for membership, defining the obligations and
benefits of membership, and potentially creating mem-
bership tiers in order to accommodate different levels
of interest and contribution. CPFOA experience to date
suggests that addressing size and composition issues
clearly and openly can help partnerships avoid or over-
come conflict and equity concerns. In Harris County's
Care for Elders partnership (in Houston), early tensions
surfaced about the widely varying levels of cash and in-
kind commitments made across members. The partner-
ship's primary governance document--its operating
guidelines--addressed the issue directly by specifying
levels of membership corresponding to contributions
made and whether an organization had a founding role
in the partnership. Level of membership in turn
determines member's formal position in a multileveled
governance structure that includes the fiscal agent's
board of directors, the partnership governing council,
and multiple workgroups. The Care for Elders partner-
ship also recognized that an original composition
restriction (i.e., that members have nonprofit status)
excluded many of the government, media, and housing-
sector partners it had desired. Therefore, the partner-
ship altered the composition rules in order to encourage
broader participation. Care for Elders also wanted to
increase participation among individual older adults
and caregivers. It created a separate consumer advisory
council and empowered it to appoint four of its
members to the overall governing council. The
operating guidelines (as opposed to a formal charter
and bylaws) articulated each of these structures in part
because Care for Elders does not have its own legal
corporate status and the partnership's fiscal agent is
a member of the partnership in its own right. Having
operating guidelines satisfied the need for clear
definition of the partnership's composition and scope
without requiring the fiscal agent to alter dramatically
the fiscal agent's own governance documents.
El Paso's SALSA partnership also addressed compo-
sition of membership early in its evolution. With a long
history of informal collaboration among key partners,

BPOA has more than 100 organizations
and 200 individuals, representing
major medical centers, several
municipal departments, including the
Boston Police Department, several
state agencies, key social service
agencies, representatives from district
attorneys and attorneys general offices,
older adults, care partners, advocacy,
and special interest organizations,
community health centers, and
private businesses.
Care for Elders comprises 87
partners, with individual
and organizational members
across public, nonprofit,
and private agencies, funding
organizations, health care
systems, advocacy, and special
interest organizations, academic
institutions, business, media,
and long-term-care
service providers.
Milwaukee's Connecting Caring
Communities Partnership has more
than 125 representatives of social
services, health care systems, private
industry, the public sector (county
and state government entities,
including schools, the police
department, and district attorneys),
academic institutions, advocacy and
special interest associations, faith-based
organizations, and older adults and
their caregivers.
SALSA has more than 40 members
representing 24 organizations,
including city, county, and state
agencies; educational institutions;
consumers; local foundations;
nonprofit and for-profit providers
of health, mental health, housing,
and social services; advocacy and
special interest associations; and
faith-based organizations.
Partnership
vision
. . . a comprehensive and accessible
system of community support for
Boston's older adults.
. . . for Harris County to be a
community where older adults
are understood, valued,
respected, and given every
opportunity to choose the
setting and conditions in
which they age.
. . . that stakeholders will work together
to improve the care and services
available to older adults, resulting in a
community where older people are
able to draw upon and contribute to
the resources of their neighbor-hoods
and the community. When older
people need long-term care, it will be
available, accessible, afford-able, and
of high quality.
. . . to build an easily accessible,
integrated, and responsive
long-term-care and
supportive-services system.
Implementation
of goals, as of
February 2004
Goals address four broad substantive
priority areas: health care, housing
and homelessness, social services
and mental and cognitive health.
Specific goals encompass: centralized
access to information; data collection
and analysis; advocacy; business
partnerships; public education;
workforce development; accessible
transportation; and coordinated and
targeted funding.
Goal is to improve access,
availability, affordability,
and quality in local
long-term-care services
and systems.
Goals are: to increase awareness about
long-term care within Milwaukee
County, specifically, awareness
resources, access points, relevance to
everyone, and how it is paid for. To
foster new models of collaboration
among older adult service providers
and long-term-care stakeholders to
(a) improve caregiver retention rates
and (b) develop the capacity of
agencies to efficiently and effectively
meet the needs of older adults. To
improve the elder-friendliness of the
Layton Boulevard neighborhood,
creating a visible Corridor of Aging
excellence. To ensure that Sherman
Park's older adults feel safe in, and
connected to, their neighborhood.
Goals are: to establish a ``no-wrong
door'' system of access; to
increase the prevention
component of long-term-care
and supportive-service
providers; and to leverage
public and private resources
to enhance choices for
consumers, particularly for
self-directed care.
Governance
approach
Formal: Board of Directors makes
decisions in accordance with
bylaws.
Formal: Governing Council
makes decisions in

SALSA did not experience the membership tensions
that were evident in Harris County's Care for Elders
partnership. However, SALSA did recognize that it
would need to broaden its membership composition in
order to reach the large numbers of Hispanics/Latinos
in their partnership area. The issue was not one of
cultural identity. The fiscal agent and several partners
were social service agencies led and staffed largely by
Hispanics/Latinos. However, social service agencies
are viewed by some as closely associated with the
government and therefore potentially dangerous to
people with questionable legal status. In order to
address this outreach barrier, SALSA has specifically
targeted for membership the faith community and
other segments of El Paso's informal network that have
better access to consumers not otherwise connected to
more formal social service agencies.
Another important governance function is account-
ability, defined as the processes adopted by a partner-
ship that justify its existence and actions to the
community. In long-term care and supportive services,
accountability is usually established by laws governing
the creation of nonprofit corporations. However,
because CPFOA partnerships are not incorporated as
freestanding entities, accountability has been divisive,
particularly with regard to the role and accountability
of each partnership's fiscal agent. Boston originally
conceived its Partnership for Older Adults as a coalition
of several existing and overlapping groups, with the
city's Commission on Affairs of the Elderly acting as
fiscal agent. Boston is not a city, however, where
organizations and citizens take readily to dominant
government structures (the Boston Tea Party comes to
mind). Furthermore, as the city's designated Area
Agency on Aging, the Commission plays an important
role in establishing aging policy for the city and
allocating Older Americans Act funds to social service
organizations. After a fractious debate about whether
the Commission, in its dominant position based at City
Hall, could be held accountable by partnership mem-
bers, a decision was made to have a city-affiliated yet
freestanding Senior Center with 501(c)(3) nonprofit
status act as the fiscal agent. This maintained the tie
to the city and respected the Commission's role as
a founding member while putting the fiscal agent more
at par with the other social service agencies that
comprise the majority of members of the Boston
Partnership for Older Adults (BPOA).
Harris County's Care for Elders partnership had
a similar challenge when some members became
suspicious of the intentions of the fiscal agent, a 100-
year-old social service agency with a history and goals
of its own. At the same time, the fiscal agent's board of
directors had become concerned about whether acting
as fiscal agent required it to sublimate its individual
agency prerogatives to those of the partnership in
a way that other members had not been required to do.
To whom was the board accountable--to its traditional
constituency, or to the much broader community
reflected in the partnership? A creative solution was
crafted in which the partnership created its own gov-
erning council. The chair of the governing council has
a seat on the fiscal agent's board, tying the two together
for accountability, yet enabling the fiscal agent to
comfortably delegate partnership governance functions
to the council.
Community Partnership Management
A governance document provides a solid foundation
for a partnership, but it is only words on paper until
managers execute its provisions. Tending to day-to-day
details of partnership implementation can be particu-
larly challenging because activities are often spread
across multiple member organizations that are con-
tributing in-kind services. Individual member agencies
generally view partnership tasks as discretionary
activities that come after their ``real'' work (such as
delivering meals, investigating abuse complaints, or
answering a telephone information line). Communica-
tion also is more challenging, because it must span
multiple organizations and individuals.
The Boston Partnership for Older Adults learned
that conflict could best be prevented or managed by
providing neutral staff resources to workgroups, rather
than relying on in-kind staffing from member agencies.
In order to make clear the intent to provide neutral
staff accessible by all members, the staff moved from
their original location in City Hall to office space not
associated with any individual member organization.
Milwaukee County's Connecting Caring Communi-
ties partnership uses a similar mechanism in order to
ensure that work will be done in an unbiased manner,
although it contracts for professional facilitators rather
than dedicating staff to support its multiple project
steering committees. The contracted facilitators are
responsible for ensuring good communication among
steering committee members, preparing agendas,
keeping meetings on task, documenting meetings,
and conducting research and other tasks outside of
meetings.
As a partnership gains credibility in the community
and association with it becomes positive to funders,
policy makers, and others, it becomes important to
manage external communication about the partnership.
For example, BPOA bylaws specify that approval of the
executive director and the Public Relations Committee
are required before anyone represents the Partnership
at a public event.
Another management function is providing the
appropriate structures and coordination mechanisms
that enable a partnership to achieve its goals. Again, this
has proved to be an important issue for CPFOA grantees.
How can a partnership's work be broken into manage-
able parts (especially if it is the work of a large
partnership with diverse interests), yet not become
fragmented and compartmentalized? BPOA answered
this question by creating 13 issue-focused workgroups,
each of which has a chair who also sits on the
Partnership's board of directors. This ensures high-level
strategic coordination across workgroup activities. At
the operational level, the chairs also sit on a program and
planning council that meets with BPOA staff to discuss
day-to-day integration and coordination of work.
Vol. 46, No. 3, 2006 395
Milwaukee County's Connecting Caring Communi-
ties, with its tradition of decentralized partnership
activity, has taken a different approach. Like BPOA,
Connecting Caring Communities has multiple work-
groups overseeing different parts of the partnership's
work plan. But unlike BPOA, Connecting Caring
Communities did not see a need to create an additional
forum to address operational coordination. Strategic
coordination is addressed within the partnership's core
leadership group, which meets every other month, and
operational coordination is left to the workgroups'
discretion.
Toward Sustainability: Early Evidence
of Centrality
As was discussed earlier, centrality refers to the state
of a partnership becoming a pivotal institutional force
in the life of a community. Each of the partnerships
continues to evolve, but each can also point to early
indicators of centrality within their communities.
In El Paso, SALSA has been recognized by the media
as a source for public affairs programming and news
related to older adults. The partnership manages
a weekly column, Viva 3rd Age, in the local newspaper.
The column is an excellent communication vehicle for
reaching a mass audience, and it gives SALSA
widespread exposure in the community. Viva 3rd Age
also acts to sustain interest among members and to
attract new members to SALSA, which is viewed as
having expertise. SALSA also hosts a weekly show on
the local public radio station. As an indication that
state agencies view SALSA as an important local
resource, the adult protective agency contacted the
partnership to help respond to a serious breakdown of
the adult protective services system. SALSA was able to
respond by drawing on its members to quickly establish
a Neighbors Helping Neighbors initiative in El Paso.
BPOA established itself as a source of credible
quantitative data on older people in Boston with
publication of 100,000 Voices on Growing Older in
Boston (Boston Partnership for Older Adults, 2003).
This report is a compendium of information synthe-
sized from existing data collected by partners and
buttressed by the results of a survey conducted by
Mathematica Policy Research, Inc. (Black & Brown,
2004), as part of the Robert Wood Johnson Founda-
tion's national evaluation of CPFOA. BPOA has had
substantial media attention as a result of the report and
has since been sought after by local mass media as
a source of objective information when issues related to
older adults are in the news. The report also resulted in
contact from two local foundations. One sought out
BPOA after receiving several funding requests that cited
100,000 Voices as evidence of the community's needs.
That foundation had considered pulling out of
grantmaking for older adults but recommitted itself
to the population after BPOA met with the founda-
tion's trustees and demonstrated the need. Another
local foundation decided it would use BPOA's strategic
plan as a guidepost for elder grantmaking. The report
also prompted a contact from a local health mainte-
nance organization seeking advice on a request for
proposals it was issuing for initiatives that would
prevent or delay institutionalization. The health main-
tenance organization asked BPOA to help narrow the
focus of the request for proposals based on the findings
reported in 100,000 Voices.
Milwaukee County's Connecting Caring Communi-
ties also reports having been buttressed in its efforts by
local foundations, which have begun insisting that
organizations seeking funding tie their requests into the
partnership's strategic plan. Like BPOA, Connecting
Caring Communities received positive attention after
publishing Now at 60 What I See (Milwaukee County,
2003), a report on aging in Milwaukee County that,
like in Boston, took advantage of the survey data from
the national evaluation of CPFOA.
Harris County's Care for Elders issued a similar
report, Meeting the Long-Term Care Challenge: A
Strategic Plan for Addressing the Needs of Older
Adults and Family Caregivers in Harris County (Care
for Elders, 2004). The report has become a frequently
cited source on the status of aging in Harris County
and is now routinely referred to as ``the Blue Book.''
The report created opportunities for dialogue with the
Houston City Council and local foundations, some of
which now want to access the data in order to inform
their grantmaking. Care for Elders has gained sufficient
influence in the community to convince five separate
information and referral sources in the Houston area to
contribute to a single electronic database of resources
for older adults.
Lessons Learned
Looking across the experiences of CPFOA grantees
in this early phase of their work, we see some
important lessons emerging.
Local Context Matters.--Partnerships are experienc-
ing similar difficulties and sharing ideas, but their
solutions are unique to their individual environments.
Care for Elders and BPOA both saw a need to clarify
governance and the role of the fiscal agent, for
example, but one community chose to adopt operating
guidelines in order to codify procedures for member-
ship, decision making, resource allocation, leadership
roles, and partnership relationship to the host agency,
whereas the other chose to adopt a new fiscal agent and
a formal partnership governance structure that includes
a board, officers, and bylaws.
If Attention is not Paid Early on to Governance and
Management, Progress will Stall.--This was perhaps
surprising to both the partnerships and the National
Program Office, because a criterion for funding was
that partnerships have prior experience working
together as well as some demonstrated outcomes. In
retrospect, with new resources from the Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation, many of the partnerships took on
goals of unprecedented complexity and some contro-
versy, and they found that their existing governance
396 The Gerontologist
and management structures were no longer adequate.
Although the ensuing development work was initially
frustrating to many involved, it was a necessary
investment in partnership building.
Communities Value and Use Information from One
Another and Adapt it to Local Context.--For example,
once one partnership used national evaluation data in
order to produce a local report, several other partner-
ships followed suit. Communities shared methods and
drafts during this process.
Data are not Simply an Important Partnership
Planning Tool.--When presented effectively (as in the
community strategic plans and reports produced by
partnerships), data are key tools for achieving central-
ity and giving partnerships visibility, credibility, and
entre
Â´ e with policy makers, the media, researchers, and
funders.
Emerging Centrality can be Traced Directly to
Some Early Planning Activities.--Several communities
report that local foundations now look to the
community strategic plans for long-term care and
supportive-services systems improvements that were
created by partnerships in order to inform their
grantmaking. A planning process with broad partici-
pation by older adults, service providers, government
agencies, community leaders, and other stakeholders
gives partnerships credibility in the community.
Resource Issues can be Divisive to Partnerships but
can also Help Clarify Accountability Mechanisms.--
For many CPFOA grantees, the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation grant represents the largest infusion of
external resources ever controlled by the partnership.
In some communities, the response to substantial new
resources was mistrust--particularly of fiscal agents,
but also of other partnership members. Partnerships
appear to have successfully channeled the mistrust into
clarification of governance and management structures.
Power Imbalances Exist in all Partnerships and
Should be Acknowledged and Addressed.--Being the
fiscal agent for a partnership is one example of one
member having greater potential influence than another,
and the size and role of individual partners in the
community affect the influence a member has in the
partnership. Grantees have used relatively simple
approaches in order to ensure that power imbalances
do not get in the way of partnership activities. For
example, providing dedicated partnership staff gives
members some comfort that activities will not be
dominated by in-kind staff from larger partners.
Conclusions
Although these four community partnerships can
point to emerging importance and influence in their
communities, it is too early to predict sustainability. It
remains to be seen whether any of these partnerships
will be able to maintain current levels of activity and
increase their centrality after the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation grant funding ends. But the experiences of
these communities to date underscore that governance
and management need to be grappled with explicitly
and early if a partnership is to become a sustainable
force in the life of its community.
