  Academic health centers must in­ crease training opportunities in ambu­ latory care; many have already done so.23 Despite the attractiveness of ed­ ucation in the ambulatory care setting,

tional gain from teaching in the clinics, there is still the need for stu­ dents to observe and study specific medical conditions that they will come across in primary ambulatory care outside the academic center. A legiti­ mate concern is whether academic health centers, with their emphasis on





tertiary care, provide trainees with a range of common medical problems in their primary care clinics.5

METHOD

Each visit to the outpatient clinics of the University of Illinois Hospital (UIH) for which a bill was produced and an International Classification of Diseases (ICD)-9 diagnosis recorded for the year July 1989-June 1990 was examined for principal diagnosis and provider identification. Diagnoses were coded according to the scheme devised by Schneeweiss et al.,8 which organizes ambulatory care diagnoses into 92 common clusters. Their fre­ quencies were compared with the fre­ quencies of the clusters in the Na­ tional Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) of 1989.7 In that survey, the 92 clusters comprised 78% of all outpatient visits. The top 25 clusters covered 52% of visits, with each accounting for at least 1% of all visits.
The  UIH  ambulatory  care  clinics
were grouped in five categories: (1) primary care clinics (family practice, general internal medicine, general pe­ diatrics); (2) general clinics of the other departments having required third-year clerkships (surgery, obstetrics- gynecology,   psychiatry);
(3) subspecialty clinics within the de­ partments of medicine (endocrinology, pulmonary diseases, cardiology, medi­ cal oncology, gastroenterology, neph­ rology, infectious diseases, hematol­ ogy, occupational medicine, and arthritis), surgery (surgical oncology, vascular surgery, and obesity), and pe­ diatrics (pediatric hematology and on­ cology); (4) other specialty clinics (dermatology, ophthalmology, otola­ ryngology, orthopedics, urology, anes­ thesiology, neurology, and neurosur­ gery); and (5) the Department of Emergency Medicine. These five groups comprised 96% of all  visits. The remaining 4% were visits without identification of diagnosis or clinic. These were excluded from analysis.
  The frequency of visits to each clinic category was determined for the 92 diagnostic clusters. Because of the

large numbers of visits to the UIH clinics and in the NAMCS, all differ­ ences are statistically significant. Sig­ nificant differences may not necessar­ ily be meaningful differences.

RESULTS

There were 195,165 visits recorded. Only 27,957 (14%) were to the primary care clinics, while 79,708 (41%) were to the other specialty clinics. The 25 most common diagnostic clusters from the NAMCS made up 18,107 (64.8%) of all visits to the primary care clinics, more than the 52.2% nationally. How­ ever, only eight of the 25 clusters ac­ counted for more than 1% of the visits to these clinics. These clusters were general medical examination (7,437 visits), hypertension (2,738 visits), diabetes mellitus (2,425 visits), otitis media (1,115 visits), upper respiratory infections (809 visits), malignant neo­ plasms (655 visits), lower respiratory infections (387 visits), and dermatitis and eczema (388 visits).
  The number of clusters accounting for more than 1% of the visits in­ creased to nine when the general clinics of the other departments with third-year clerkships were included. This cluster was prenatal care (19,301 visits). The number increased to 13 when emergency medicine visits were also included. These clusters were lac­ erations, abrasions, and contusions (2,249 visits); acute sprains and strains (703 visits); fractures and dis­ locations (519 visits); and urinary tract infections (524 visits). A 14th was added from the subspecialty clinics of medicine, surgery, and pedi­ atrics: ischemic heart disease (920 visits). An additional eight clusters were added when the other specialty clinics were included. These were cat­ aracts (3,456 visits), refractive error (3,231 visits), low back pain (1,231 visits), benign neoplasms (1,085 visits), rhinitis (735 visits), sinusitis (699 visits), acne (693 visits), and bur­ sitis (583  visits)-bringing  the  total to 22. Sixteen of the 25 leading clus­ ters were seen commonly in the other specialty clinics, five of which were also seen in the primary care clinics.

Nine of the 25 leading clusters were seen commonly in the Department of Emergency Medicine, four of which were also seen in the primary care clinics. Of the six clusters seen in the subspecialty clinics of medicine, sur­ gery, and pediatrics, five were seen commonly in the primary care clinics. Unusual or non-groupable diag­ noses - those not included in the 92 clusters	of	the	Schneeweiss classification-were seen less fre­ quently in the primary care clinics (4,920 visits, 17.6%) than they were in
the NAMCS (21.5%).

DISCUSSION

The results of the present study show that the common diagnostic clusters were poorly represented in the pri­ mary care clinics and the subspecialty clinics of medicine, surgery, and pedi­ atrics. The pattern appears to be that the primary care clinics saw a limited range of diagnoses, although these are among the common outpatient diag­ noses, while the specialty services saw the bulk of common outpatient diag­ noses. For a student or resident to get exposure to a majority of these clus­ ters, he or she would probably need outpatient experience in addition to that provided by departments of the primary care clinics. These would in­ clude some experience in ambulatory care in specialties outside the tradi­ tional third-year clerkships.
  Many of the benefits of ambulatory care medicine training are indepen­ dent of specialty. These include longi­ tudinal observation of medical prob­ lems from presentation through resolution and understanding of psy­ chosocial aspects of patient care.8 Nevertheless, physicians in training need to observe and study the common medical conditions they will see in pri­ mary ambulatory care settings outside the academic health center. More in­ tensive use of a center's specialty clinics for primary care training may be an alternative to the use of off­ campus clinical primary care prac­ tices, which may be difficult to sup­ port financi ally910 and complicated to administer.
