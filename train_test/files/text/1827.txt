Perchlorate has been used by the aerospace
industry as an oxidizer in solid rocket propel-
lant, slurry explosives, road flares, and air bag
inflation systems. Human environmental
exposure can occur through food or water
after industrial contamination or from per-
chlorate that is naturally occurring. In a
recent analysis of data from the 2001­2002
National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES), detectable levels of
perchlorate were found in the urine of all
2,820 U.S. residents assessed (Blount et al.
2006b). Further analysis of the 2001­2002
NHANES data also identified an association
between urinary levels of perchlorate and
decreased levels of serum thyroxine (T4
) in
women with urinary iodine concentrations
< 100 µg/L (Blount et al. 2006a). A remark-
able feature of this finding is that it was iden-
tified at perchlorate concentrations much
lower than those linked to thyroid effects in
any previous study. In fact, NHANES was
designed to provide a nationally representa-
tive sample. Thus, the perchlorate exposure
levels of the subjects in this study are likely
similar to exposures occurring in a large por-
tion of the U.S. population. Another notable
feature was the relatively large fraction of
women who had urinary iodine levels in the
range where these effects were found. That
is, 35% of all women  12 years of age in
NHANES 2001­2002 had urinary iodine
levels < 100 µg/L.
High doses of perchlorate have been
shown to competitively inhibit iodide uptake
in the thyroid gland, and perchlorate has been
used therapeutically for this effect (Stanbury
and Wyngaarden 1952; Wyngaarden et al.
1952). Other agents, including nitrate in food
and water and thiocyanate in food or from
tobacco smoke, also affect the thyroid by the
same mechanism (Braverman et al. 2005;
Tonacchera et al. 2004; Wyngaarden et al.
1953). Thiocyanate is a metabolite of cyanide
found in tobacco smoke, and increased serum
thiocyanate levels are associated with increas-
ing levels of smoking (Foss and Lund-Larsen
1986). Thiocyanate is also found in some
foods including cabbage, broccoli, cassava,
and rapeseed oil (Foss and Lund-Larsen
1986).
In this investigation, we used data from
the 2001­2002 NHANES to assess whether
thiocyanate or other substances in tobacco
smoke may interact with iodine and low lev-
els of perchlorate in affecting T4
and thyroid-
stimulating hormone (TSH) (National
Center for Health Statistics 2002). The pur-
pose of this investigation was to help increase
our understanding of the mechanisms of per-
chlorate toxicity, to evaluate whether associa-
tions between perchlorate and thyroid
hormones may differ between smokers and
nonsmokers (or categories of cotinine and
thiocyanate), and to help identify subpopula-
tions that may be more susceptible than oth-
ers to the thyroid effects of perchlorate. These
issues could have tremendous public health
significance given the large numbers of people
who appear to be exposed to perchlorate and
have low iodine intake. The recent finding
linking low levels of urinary perchlorate to
reduced thyroid function, and the possibility
that even minor decrements in thyroid func-
tion could affect early-life cognitive develop-
ment, highlight the potentially serious impact
of perchlorate exposure.
Materials and Methods
NHANES is a national survey of health,
nutrition, and sociodemographic information
involving a complex multistage probability
sampling design conducted by the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention's National
Center for Health Statistics (2002). In
NHANES 2001­2002, levels of perchlorate,
cotinine, and thiocyanate were analyzed in a
representative one-third subsample of all sub-
jects. For all subjects  12 years of age, these
data were combined with data on levels of
serum T4
, serum TSH, smoking status, and
other variables that might affect perchlorate­
thyroid associations. These included race
(Mexican American, other Hispanic, non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, or
other, each entered as a dichotomous vari-
able), age (years), iodine status, serum albu-
min (grams per deciliter), body mass index
(BMI) (kilograms per square meter), 24-hr
caloric intake (kilocalories per day from 24-hr
dietary recall data), pregnancy status (based on
urinary pregnancy test results and self-reports),

Impact of Smoking and Thiocyanate on Perchlorate and Thyroid Hormone
Associations in the 2001­2002 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey

BACKGROUND: Findings from a recent large study suggest that perchlorate at commonly occur-
ring exposure concentrations may decrease thyroid hormone levels in some women. Decreases in
thyroid hormone seen with perchlorate exposure could be even greater in people with concomi-
tant exposure to agents such as thiocyanate that may affect the thyroid by mechanisms similar to
those of perchlorate.
OBJECTIVES AND METHODS: We used data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey to assess the impact of smoking and thiocyanate on the relationship between urinary per-
chlorate and serum thyroxine (T4
) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH).
RESULTS: In women with urinary iodine levels < 100 µg/L, the association between the logarithm of
perchlorate and decreased T4
was greater in smokers [regression coefficient () = ­1.66, p = 0.0005]
than in nonsmokers ( = ­0.54, p = 0.04). In subjects with high, medium, and low cotinine levels,
these regression coefficients were ­1.47 (p = 0.0002), ­0.57 (p = 0.03), and -0.16 (p = 0.59). For
high, medium, and low thiocyanate tertiles they were ­1.67 (p = 0.0009), ­0.68 (p = 0.09), and
­0.49 (p = 0.11). Clear interactions between perchlorate and smoking were not seen with TSH or
with T4
in women with urinary iodine levels  100 µg/L or in men.
CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that thiocyanate in tobacco smoke and perchlorate interact in
affecting thyroid function, and this effect can take place at commonly occurring perchlorate expo-
sures. Agents other than tobacco smoke might cause similar interactions, and further research on
these agents could help identify people who are particularly susceptible to perchlorate.

postmenopausal status (based on self-report,
time since last period, and presence or absence
of other reasons for missed menstruation),

tive protein (milligrams per deciliter), hours of
fasting before serum collection (self-report),
urinary nitrate (micrograms per liter), current
lactation (dichotomous based on self-report),
and use of medications known to affect the
thyroid (e.g., levothyroxine, methimazole,
propylthiouracil, beta blockers, and estrogens)
(dichotomous based on self-reported use). A
description of the possible impacts these vari-
ables may have on the relationship between
perchlorate and thyroid function has been
provided by Blount et al. (2006a).
In NHANES 2001­2002, information
on self-reported smoking status was provided
in two separate sections, the questionnaire
and the medical examination component
(MEC). For the study presented here, sub-
jects were divided into four groups: current
smokers, recent former smokers, long-term
former smokers, and never-smokers. Current
smokers were defined as those who reported
that they smoked cigarettes at the time of the
survey (questionnaire) or reported that they
had smoked at least 20 cigarettes in the pre-
ceding 30 days (MEC). Never-smokers were
defined as those who reported that they had
not smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their life
(questionnaire) or that they had never tried
cigarette smoking (MEC). Recent former
smokers were defined as those who quit
smoking within 12 months of the survey.
Long-term former smokers were defined as
those who quit > 12 months before the sur-
vey. Because no difference between long-term
former smokers and never-smokers was found
in the association between T4
or TSH and
perchlorate, these two groups were combined
into one group labeled "nonsmokers" for this
study. Because the latency of the impact of
tobacco smoke on thyroid function is
unknown, all recent former smokers were
excluded from analyses comparing smokers
and nonsmokers. Approximately 10% of the
subjects did not provide adequate informa-
tion to assess smoking status. Few women
were regular users of cigars, chewing tobacco,
or snuff, and excluding regular users of these
products had no impact on the analyses.
The methods used to collect and perform
laboratory analyses of perchlorate, iodine, T4
,
TSH, cotinine, and thiocyanate, and the qual-
ity control procedures involved in NHANES
2001­2002, are described in detail elsewhere
(National Center for Health Statistics 2002).
Briefly, serum samples collected in 2001 were
assayed for TSH using a microparticle
immunoassay and for T4
using a Hitachi 704
chemistry analyzer (Hitachi Chemical
Diagnostics, Mountain View, CA). Samples
collected in 2002 were assayed for T4
and
TSH using a chemiluminescent immunoassay
(Access Immunoassay Systems; Beckman
Instruments, Fullerton, CA). Urine samples
were analyzed for perchlorate, thiocyanate,
and nitrate using ion chromatography tandem
mass spectrometry (Blount 2006b). Iodine
was analyzed using inductively coupled plasma
mass spectrometry (National Center for
Health Statistics 2002).
Using data from NHANES 2001­2002,
Blount et al. (2006a) identified an association
between the logarithm of perchlorate concen-
tration in urine (log perchlorate) and
decreased serum T4
in women with urinary
iodine < 100 µg/L ( = ­0.89, p < 0.0001),
but not in women with higher urinary iodine
levels ( = 0.22, p = 0.55). Associations
between log perchlorate and increases in the
logarithm of serum TSH (log TSH) were also
identified, both in women with urinary
iodine levels above and below 100 µg/L
( = 0.11, p = 0.02; and  = 0.12, p = 0.001,
respectively). The urinary iodine stratification
level of 100 µg/L was selected by Blount et al.
because the World Health Organization
(WHO) has defined populations with median
urinary iodine excretion > 100 µg/L as having
sufficient intake (WHO 1994). This stratifi-
cation level was chosen for the analyses pre-
sented here for the same reason and so that
our results could be compared more directly
with those of Blount et al. (2006a)
We assessed serum cotinine in this study
because it is a metabolite of nicotine and may
be a more accurate indicator of current smok-
ing status than self-reported smoking (Wells
et al. 1998). We categorized cotinine concen-
trations into three levels for this study. Serum
cotinine levels > 10 ng/mL were classified as
high, whereas levels below the detection level
of 0.015 ng/mL were classified as low. All lev-
els between these cutoff points were classified
as medium. Using a cutoff of 15 ng/mL to
define the high cotinine category had little
impact on our results. Thiocyanate categories
were based on the sex-specific tertiles.
All statistical analyses were performed with
SAS version 9.1 (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC)
using SAS procedures surveyreg, %sregsub,
and surveymeans. The following model was
used: T4
or log TSH = intercept + 1
(log per-
chlorate) + 2
(log creatinine) + 3
(iodine cate-
gory) + 4
(iodine category × log perchlorate) +
5
(smoking category) + 6
(smoking category
× log perchlorate) + n
(n = other potential
confounding variables). In this model iodine
category is defined as < 100 µg/L or not, and
smoking category is defined either as current
versus nonsmokers or as classes of cotinine or
thiocyanate as defined above. The model
allows estimates of the effect of smoking cate-
gory and the interaction of perchlorate with
smoking category, after adjustment for creati-
nine and iodine category. Similarly, estimates
of the effect of iodine category and the interac-
tion of iodine category with perchlorate are
made after adjustment for creatinine and
smoking category. Initially, we performed uni-
variate analyses to assess the relationship
between urinary perchlorate, all potential
covariates, and serum T4
and log TSH. We
also performed univariate analyses and data
plots to identify outliers and to assess distribu-
tions. Variables such as urinary perchlorate,
urinary creatinine, and serum TSH were log
10-transformed to normalize distributions. In
analyses involving surveymeans, urinary per-
chlorate residuals adjusted for creatinine were
calculated using the method described by
Willet and Stampfer (1998).
Initial univariate and multivariate analyses
showed no clear evidence of interaction among
smoking, cotinine, thiocyanate, and urinary
perchlorate on serum T4
or log TSH levels in
men or in women with urinary iodine levels
> 100 µg/L, so we focus on women with uri-
nary iodine < 100 µg/L. Women who reported
a history of thyroid disease or use of thyroid
medications were excluded. Two women with
very high serum TSH levels (43 and 68 IU/L)
and one woman with a very high serum T4
level (27 µg/dL) were also excluded.
We constructed separate regression mod-
els for serum T4
and log TSH as the depen-
dent variables. Model building followed the
general principles presented by Hosmer and
Lemeshow (2000). Independent variables that
were associated with T4
or log TSH with
p < 0.20 were added to and retained in the
model that included the log perchlorate and
log creatinine. Excluded variables were added
back to the model one at a time to assure that
they did not have important impacts on the
perchlorate regression coefficient.
Results
Of the 11,039 subjects in NHANES
2001­2002, 5,708 were women and 4,137 of
these were  12 years of age. Of these, 1,203
(29%) had data on serum T4
, serum TSH,
and urinary perchlorate, iodine, and creati-
nine. Three of these had extreme values of T4
or TSH, and 91 reported a history of thyroid
disease or use of thyroid medication. Of the
remaining women, 385 (35%) had urinary
iodine levels < 100 µg/L. Table 1 provides

Table 2 shows the regression coefficients
for the association between serum T4
and log
perchlorate in women with urinary iodine lev-
els < 100 µg/L. The adjusted regression coeffi-
cient in all women with low urinary iodine
was ­0.73 (p = 0.004). The adjusted regres-
sion coefficients between T4
and log perchlo-
rate in current smokers and nonsmokers were
­1.66 (p = 0.0005) and ­0.54 (p = 0.04),
respectively. The regression coefficient for the
product term including log perchlorate and
smoking category was 1.12 (p = 0.008), con-
sistent with a biologic interaction. Regression
coefficients between T4
and log perchlorate
were higher in women with serum cotinine
levels > 10 ng/mL than in women with coti-
nine levels below the detection limit, and
higher in women with thiocyanate levels in
the upper tertile than in women with levels in
the lower tertile. We observed only small dif-
ferences between the adjusted and unadjusted
regression coefficients in most analyses. The
differences in T4
­log perchlorate regression
coefficients seen between smoking categories
changed only slightly when different iodine
cutoff points were used. For example, using a
cut-off point of 75 µg/L and 125 µg/L, the
T4
­log perchlorate regression coefficients for
smokers and nonsmokers were ­1.58 and
­0.48, and ­1.42 and ­0.33, respectively. No
clear associations between urinary perchlorate
and T4
or interactions with smoking, coti-
nine, or thiocyanate were found in men, or in
women with urinary iodine levels  100 µg/L
(data not shown).
Table 2 shows the regression coefficients
for the association between log TSH and log
perchlorate in women with urinary iodine
levels < 100 µg/L. In all women in this group,
the regression coefficient was 0.13 (p = 0.02).
The corresponding coefficients in current
smokers and nonsmokers were 0.13 (p = 0.23)
and 0.11 (p = 0.009). Consistent differences in
the regression coefficients between urinary per-
chlorate and serum TSH were not seen across
subgroups of serum cotinine or thiocyanate.
The associations between T4
and smoking,
thiocyanate, and cotinine, independent of uri-
nary perchlorate, were assessed in women with
urinary iodine < 100 µg/L. In univariate analy-
ses, no associations were found between the
logarithm of serum cotinine and serum T4
or
log TSH (for T4
: n = 382,  = 0.03, p = 0.73;
for log TSH: n = 382,  = ­0.02, p = 0.26). In
analyses adjusted for creatinine, no statistically
significant associations were found between log
thiocyanate and T4
or log TSH (for T4
: n =
384,  = ­0.17, p = 0.46; for TSH: n = 384,
 = ­0.05, p = 0.21).
Table 3 shows mean serum T4
and log
TSH levels in women with and without three
potential risk factors for reduced uptake of
iodine into the thyroid gland and thus
reduced production of thyroid hormone.
These are: a) urinary iodine < 100 µg/L (the
median urinary iodine concentration in a
population at which no endemic goiter is
found) (Vanderpas 2006; WHO 2004)), b)
current smoking, and c) urinary perchlorate
(creatinine adjusted) above the median. Mean
T4
levels were lower in women who had all
three risk factors than in those with none
(7.16 vs. 8.41 µg/dL, p = 0.04). Mean log
TSH was higher in the group with these risk
factors than in those without [0.24 vs. 0.11
(IU/L), p = 0.001]. These differences were
smaller and not statistically significant when
the perchlorate risk factor was removed. That
is, the mean T4
level in women smokers with
iodine < 100 µg/L (regardless of urinary per-
chlorate level) was 8.58 µg/dL [95% confi-
dence interval (CI), 8.11 to 9.05, n = 66]
whereas the mean T4
in nonsmokers with
iodine  100 µg/L (regardless of urinary per-
chlorate level) was 8.39 µg/dL (n = 406, 95%
CI, 8.06 to 8.72; p = 0.63). The mean log
TSH values in these two groups were 0.12
µg/dL (95% CI, ­0.00 to 0.24) and 0.16
µg/dL (95% CI, 0.13 to 0.19; p = 0.36).
Discussion
A previous analysis of NHANES 2001­2002
showed that commonly found urinary per-
chlorate levels may be associated with
decreases in serum T4
and increases in TSH
in some women (Blount et al. 2006a). Our
independent analysis of the same raw data
confirms these findings and has also found
that in women with low urinary iodine, the
association between urinary perchlorate and
decreased serum T4
is stronger in smokers
than in nonsmokers and stronger in those
with high urinary thiocyanate levels than in
those with low thiocyanate levels. These find-
ings provide evidence that perchlorate at rela-
tively low levels can interact with tobacco
smoke or thiocyanate to diminish iodine
uptake and decrease thyroid function. The
large magnitude of the differences identified
suggest that these findings are not owing to
chance, and the finding of similar effects
across different measures of exposure (i.e.,
self-reported smoking, serum cotinine, and
urinary thiocyanate) provides further evidence
that these results represent true effects.
The findings identified in this study are
biologically plausible. That is, they are consis-
tent with the mechanisms by which perchlo-
rate, iodine, and thiocyanate are known to
affect thyroid function. Perchlorate competi-
tively inhibits the sodium iodide symporter
(NIS), the membrane protein that actively
transports iodide into the thyroid follicular cell
for thyroid hormone production (Stanbury
and Wyngaarden 1952; Wyngaarden et al.
1952). Sufficient suppression of iodide uptake
can diminish production of thyroid hormone.
Smoking has been linked to increases in vari-
ous thyroid diseases (Vestergaard 2002),
although data on the relationship between
smoking and serum levels of thyroid hor-
mones have been mixed (Bertelsen and
Smoking, perchlorate, and thyroid hormones

Hegedus 1994). Smoking does increase serum
levels of thiocyanate (Foss and Lund-Larsen
1986), which, like perchlorate, also competi-
tively inhibits the NIS (Tonacchera et al.
2004). Thiocyanate has also been shown to
increase the risk for development of goiter,
both in those with moderate to severe iodine
deficiency (< 50 µg/g creatinine) and in those
within the lower range of adequate iodine
intake (100 µg/g creatinine) (Brauer et al.
2006). Based on their common effects, it is
not surprising that thiocyanate from smoking
could interact with perchlorate to inhibit the
NIS and subsequently decrease thyroid hor-
mone production and that this effect would be
greater in those with lower iodine levels.
A remarkable aspect of these findings is
that the perchlorate levels in NHANES
2001­2002 are generally much lower than lev-
els shown not to affect thyroid function in
previous studies. In the 385 women with low
iodine in our study, 50% had urine per-
chlorate levels < 1.7 µg/L and 90% had levels
< 5.7 µg/L. Several experimental and observa-
tional studies have reported that perchlorate
had no effect on T4
or TSH levels at exposure
levels orders of magnitude higher than the
median levels found in our study (Braverman
et al. 2005, 2006; Greer et al. 2002; Lamm
and Doemland 1999; Lamm et al. 1999a,
1999b, 2002; Tellez et al. 2005). There are
several possible explanations for this discrep-
ancy. One is that most previous studies did
not evaluate effects in women with low iodine.
It is possible that iodine levels must be suf-
ficiently low for environmental levels of
perchlorate and thiocyanate to overcome com-
pensatory mechanisms that maintain thyroid
hormone. This is consistent with a previous
study showing that goiters due to the con-
sumption of thiocyanate in cassava were more
likely when iodine levels were low and
were reversed with iodine supplementation
(Delanghe et al. 1982). It is also possible that
the effects on T4
we identified in women with
low urinary iodine also occur in women with
higher iodine levels but are less strong and the
statistical power to identify them has been too
low in most studies. Other possible reasons are
that occupational studies have involved pri-
marily men and, as was found in our study,
effects may predominate in women; that
experimental studies may have missed effects
because dosing durations were too short; and
that ecologic studies may have missed effects
because of the greater misclassification of per-
chlorate exposure that can occur when expo-
sure is assessed ecologically rather than
individually. We do not know why the effects
we identified were seen only in women.
Women do have greater incidences of some
iodine-related and other thyroid conditions
(Laurberg et al. 2000), and estradiol has been
shown to inhibit TSH-stimulated expression
of the sodium­iodide symporter in rats
(Furlanetto et al. 1999). It is possible that
these effects may be related to our finding
effects in women but not in men.
The results of this study are based on a
single assessment of urinary perchlorate, uri-
nary iodine, and serum thyroid hormones.
Previous studies have shown that after short-
term perchlorate administration in humans,
most perchlorate is excreted in the urine
within 48­72 hr (Greer et al. 2002; Selivanova
and Arefaeva 1986). Other studies have shown
that thyroid hormone levels, especially TSH,
and iodine levels can have marked intraindi-
vidual variability over time (Hollowell et al.
1998; Surks et al. 2005). Because of this vari-
ability and the relatively short half-life of per-
chlorate, single measurements of these analytes
might not reflect true long-term levels.
Another issue that could lead to misclassifica-
tion is that serum T4
was measured as total T4
rather than as free T4
(the physiologically
available form). Importantly, though, biologic
samples in NHANES 2001­2002 were col-
lected and analyzed similarly in all subjects,
independent of perchlorate, thyroid, iodine, or
smoking status. Thus, any misclassification of
these exposure or outcome variables is likely to
be nondifferential, and therefore likely to bias
estimates of association toward the null, not
toward the positive effects identified in this
study (Rothman and Greenland 1998).
The presence of certain factors such as
estrogen use, the presence of thyroid disease,
exercise, menstruation disturbances, or
antithyroid antibodies could potentially con-
found the association between perchlorate and
thyroid hormone levels. However, confound-
ing variables must be related to both the expo-
sure and the outcome. Because many of the
variables linked to serum thyroid hormone
levels are not necessarily associated with uri-
nary perchlorate concentrations, they are not
likely to be confounding variables in our
analyses. Some variables could be associated
with both thyroid hormone levels and urinary
perchlorate and therefore could have acted as
confounders. However, many potential con-
founders were controlled for either by adjust-
ing for them in the analyses (e.g., estrogen use)
or by applying restriction criteria (e.g., exclud-
ing subjects with known thyroid disease).
The presence of antithyroid antibodies is a
risk factor for hypothyroidism and decreased
T4
, but were not measured in NHANES
2001­2002 and therefore not included in our
analyses. The actual impact of this is unknown.
However, an analysis of a previous NHANES
data set (NHANES III) found that antithyroid
antibodies were less prevalent in smokers
(11%) than in nonsmokers (18%) (Belin et al.
2004). This suggests that, based on antithyroid
antibody status alone, smokers would tend to
have higher T4
levels than nonsmokers. In the
study reported here, we found somewhat of
the opposite effect. That is, we found that per-
chlorate was associated with decreased T4
, and
the strength of this decrease was greater in
smokers than in nonsmokers. This suggests
that if we were able to account for antithyroid
antibodies in our analyses, this could actually
strengthen, not weaken, the associations we
identified for smoking.
The results of some of our analyses are
slightly different than those reported by
Blount et al. (2006a), although the results of
these two studies are close and the differences
have no impact on the conclusions drawn
from either study. Our analysis was done
independently from Blount et al., so these dif-
ferences are likely related to differences in the
definitions and categorization of some vari-
ables (e.g., postmenopause or premenarche
status), the use of different statistical pro-
grams, and different methods of selecting
independent variables to remain in the final
regression models. Despite these differences,
the results of these two studies are similar. For
example, for women with low urinary iodine
the adjusted regression coefficient between log
perchlorate and serum T4
was ­0.89 (SE =
0.18, p < 0.0001, n = 348) in Blount et al.
(2006a) and ­0.73 (SE = 0.22, p = 0.004, n =
362) in this study. The similarity of these
results, despite different statistical methods
and independent analyses, supports the valid-
ity of the methods used in both studies.
Tobacco smoke, with its > 4,000 chemi-
cals, is associated with many abnormalities of
thyroid function likely occurring via multiple
mechanisms (Utiger 1995). Although we
found evidence of interaction between smok-
ing and perchlorate on reducing serum T4
levels, no clear interaction was seen on TSH.
As seen in Table 2, the magnitudes of the
regression coefficients between log perchlorate
and log TSH were similar in nonsmokers and
smokers, suggesting that the impacts of per-
chlorate on TSH are similar regardless of
smoking status. In many conditions, suppres-
sion of T4
is accompanied by a compensatory
rise in serum TSH. However, this is not
always the case. For example, iodine defi-
ciency is characterized by decreases in serum
T4
with normal or slightly elevated levels of
serum triiodothyronine (T3
) and normal lev-
els of serum TSH (Obregon et al. 2005). It
has been shown that with iodine deficiency
T4
is deiodinated to T3
(LaFranchi 2004).
Based on this, it has been suggested that
although iodine deficiency may cause a
decrease in serum T4
levels, an associated
increase in T3
exerts a negative feedback lim-
iting any compensatory rise in TSH (Maruta
and Greer 1988). This could explain why we
found clear differences across smoking, coti-
nine, and thiocyanate categories for T4
but
not for TSH.
Steinmaus et al.

There are other possible reasons why we
found less effect on TSH. For example, a pre-
vious NHANES survey found that smokers
had lower TSH levels than nonsmokers, pos-
sibly related to the greater prevalence of
serum thyroid autoantibodies among non-
smokers (Belin et al. 2004). Although the
data from other studies regarding the impacts
of smoking and thyroid function have been
mixed (Hegedus et al. 1985; Muller et al.
1995; Petersen et al. 1991; Sepkovic et al.
1984), it is possible that smoking causes an
overall suppression of TSH that counter-
balances any TSH stimulation caused by
reductions in serum T4
. Another reason why
effects on TSH may not be found is that
intra- and interindividual variability is gener-
ally much greater for serum TSH than for
serum T4
, and this variability diminished the
ability of this study to identify associations
with a single assessment of TSH.
The public health significance of this
study lies in a) the large number of people in
the United States who appear to be exposed to
perchlorate, b) the large number of women
with low iodine levels, c) the variety of factors
that can inhibit the sodium iodide symporter,
and, d) the potential importance of relatively
small changes in thyroid hormone levels. With
regard to perchlorate exposure, NHANES was
designed to provide information on a nation-
ally representative level. Thus, the perchlorate
exposure levels of the subjects in this study are
supposed to represent those in the large major-
ity of people in the United States. Although
statistically significant findings in this study
were seen only in women with urinary iodine
levels < 100 µg/L, this group represents a large
fraction of the U.S. and world population. In
NHANES 2001­2002, 35% of all women
 12 years of age had iodine levels < 100 µg/L.
Importantly, our findings may not be rele-
vant just for smokers. We did find effects on
TSH in both smokers and non-smokers. In
addition, we found a borderline statistically sig-
nificant effect on T4
in nonsmokers and a sta-
tistically significant effect in subjects with
urinary cotinine levels associated with environ-
mental tobacco smoke exposure (i.e., our
medium cotinine category). Also, thiocyanate
not only results from smoking but also is
present in various foods including cruciferous
vegetables and cassava. Elevated levels of thio-
cyanate have been noted in the milk of cows
that were fed rapeseed (a member of the
Cruciferae family), with resulting decreases in
iodine in milk presumably from inhibition of
the sodium­iodide symporter expressed in the
lactating breast (Laurberg et al. 2002).
Similarly, iodine levels in breast milk are
decreased in human mothers who smoke
(Laurberg et al. 2004). Other chemicals known
to inhibit the thyroid sodium­iodide sym-
porter include nitrates [which are estimated to
contaminate 22% of domestic wells through-
out the United States above the U.S. EPA
maximum concentration limit (Ward et al.
2005)] and iodine in excess (Riesco-Eizaguirre
and Santisteban 2006; Wolff and Chaikoff
1948). In vitro data have shown that perchlo-
rate, nitrates, and thiocyanate may have addi-
tive effects on inhibiting the sodium­iodide
symporter (Tonacchera et al. 2004). In prelim-
inary analyses, we did not find evidence of
strong associations between urinary nitrate lev-
els and thyroid function or clear interactions
with perchlorate. Whether this may be caused
by the use of urinary nitrate rather than serum
or dietary nitrate, differences between in vivo
and in vitro effects, or some other reason is
unknown and requires investigation beyond
the scope of this paper. Regardless, the in vitro
data on the interactions between these agents,
combined with our findings regarding thio-
cyanate, provide some evidence that the effect
of perchlorate on thyroid function can be
increased in people exposed to similarly acting
agents. A previous concern about the interpre-
tation of the report by Blount et al. (2006a)
was that they identified associations with per-
chlorate but not with other goitrogens
(American Thyroid Association 2006). The
study reported here adds importantly to the
evaluation of the NHANES data by showing
that other goitrogens, specifically thiocyanate
and smoking, can also affect thyroid function.
The effects we identified, although rela-
tively small, could have important implica-
tions in people who have borderline low T4
levels for reasons other than exposure to per-
chlorate. In these potentially susceptible sub-
groups, additional reduction in T4
levels
caused by perchlorate could increase their risks
of developing signs or symptoms of hypothy-
roidism. Some research indicates that even
small decrements in maternal free T4
(fT4
)
during the first trimester, including those
within what is generally considered the "nor-
mal" range (lowest 10%), can be associated
with impaired neuropsychologic development
in the child (Haddow et al. 1999; Kooistra
et al. 2006; Pop et al. 2003). This suggests
that any exposure that would result in altered
production or utilization of fT4
should be
considered a potentially detrimental effect.
Sizable subpopulations for which underlying
fT4
levels may be low or borderline include
women with iodine deficiency or thyroid per-
oxidase antibodies. These women constitute a
large subpopulation potentially sensitive to the
additional burdens of thiocyanate (from
smoking or diet) and perchlorate.
Conclusions
The results of this study suggest that thio-
cyanate and smoking can have marked
impacts on the association between perchlor-
ate, iodine uptake in the thyroid, and the
production of T4
. The results also provide an
example of how an environmental chemical
exposure could potentially interact with nutri-
tional and lifestyle factors, including smoking,
iodine sufficiency, and thiocyanate intake, to
affect an important health outcome. In a time
when chemical risk assessments are under
mandate to identify and protect susceptible
subpopulations, this study illustrates the need
to evaluate interactions of not only chemicals
but lifestyle choices, nutritional status, med-
ications, and other factors. The results of this
and other studies suggest that thyroidal effects
of perchlorate are seen at commonly occur-
ring perchlorate levels and fairly common
iodine levels, and therefore could be affecting
a large segment of the U.S. population.
Further research is needed to confirm these
findings and to identify other groups who
may be particularly susceptible to the health
effects of perchlorate, and information on
these groups should be incorporated into
public health policies aimed at preventing
perchlorate toxicity.
