Abstract: Handgrip strength (HGS) is highly heritable and a good overall measure of
strength and muscle function. Indicative of blood testosterone levels and fat-free body
mass, HGS is also highly sexually dimorphic. Recent psychological research shows that
HGS is correlated with a number of social variables, but only in males. We conducted
three studies to further investigate the relationship between HGS and measures of
aggression and social competition among adolescents. Consistent with previous reports,
correlations were almost exclusive to males, but this was only visible during late
adolescence (i.e., high school). These findings support evolutionary hypotheses regarding
grip strength in male-male competition and suggest that similar to measures of testosterone,
HGS is a measure that is predictive of social behavior in older adolescent males.

Introduction
The morphology of the human hand is the product of a long evolutionary history of
primate arboreal adaptation and subsequent biocultural evolution in the hominin lineage.
The human hand possesses both primitive characteristics such as five independent rays that
articulate with carpals with two long bones in the upper limb and derived characteristics
such as the relatively long, opposable pollex (thumb) (Aiello and Dean, 1990). The origin
of bipedal locomotion in African late Miocene/early Pliocene hominins (Richmond and
Jungers, 2008; Lovejoy, Suwa, Spurlock, Asfaw, and White, 2009) released the hominin
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior

upper limb from its primary ancestral role in arboreal locomotion and opened the
opportunity for derived behaviors such as carrying and manipulating objects in the
environment (Marzke, 1999). These new behaviors (tool usage, tool manufacture, and
object transport) created selective pressures that acted to modify hominin hand morphology
and enable a wider array of power and precision grips (Marzke and Marzke, 2000; Young,
2003). This flexible and powerful gripping ability continues to be an important element of
modern human behavior.
Recent research has demonstrated an association between hand grip strength (HGS)
and indicators of fitness in contemporary college-age males (Gallup, White, and Gallup,
2007; Shoup and Gallup, 2008), suggesting that HGS may be used as a measure of variance
in male intrasexual competition during adolescence. The maintenance and elaboration of
HGS in human males may have provided a selective advantage to stronger individuals
competing for scarce resources (Gallup et al., 2007). Young (2003) hypothesized that the
selection for improved handheld clubbing prowess for protection, hunting and intrasexual
competition led to anatomical changes resulting in powerful HGS among males. While
some of these selective pressures are less prevalent in modern society, it appears this
history has resulted in HGS's association with other sexually selected traits in males,
including facial attractiveness (Shoup and Gallup, 2008), mating opportunities, masculine-
specific body morphology, and intrasexual adolescent aggression (Gallup et al., 2007).
Independent of the proposed relationship with male social behavior, HGS measured
by a hand-held dynamometer is also an easily obtainable measure of physical health and
muscle function. Within adult populations, HGS is also a good predictor of health
parameters such as protein loss (Windsor and Hill, 1988), bone-mineral density (Kritz-
Silverstein and Barrett-Connor, 1994; Foo, Zhang, Zhu, Ma, Greenfield, and Fraser, 2007;
Sinaki, Wahner, and Offord, 1989), muscle mass (Kallman, Plato, and Tobin, 1990;
Guimaraes, Carlsson, and Marie, 2007), physical functioning (Fredericksen et al., 2002;
Stenholm, Rantanen, Heliovaara, and Koskinen, 2008; Arroyo, Lera, Sanchez, Bunout,
Santos, and Albala, 2007), and is negatively correlated with disability (Giampaoli et al.,
1999), morbidity (Hughes, Gibbs, Dunlop, Edelman, Singer, and Chang, 1997), and
mortality rates in adults (Laukkanen, Heikkinen, and Kauppinen, 1995; Rantanen et al.,
2000; Sasaki, Kasagi, Yamada, and Fujita, 2007).
Although diet and exercise contribute to one's HGS, a twin study of 1,757 pairs
showed it is highly heritable after adjusting for effects of sex, weight, height and age (h2 =
0.50, see Frederiksen et al., 2002). Likewise, these authors report no evidence for a
substantial effect of nonadditive genetic factors or shared environment. Other smaller twin
studies vary in the degree of genetic influence. Arden and Spector (1997) show the
heritability of HGS to be lower among females (h2 = 0.36 after controlling for age, height
and weight), while Reed, Fabsitz, Selby, and Carmelli (1991) estimate the heritability of
male HGS to be 0.65 after adjustments of weight, height, age, and various anthropometric
measures such as fatness, muscle mass and frame size.
Despite the presence of these correlations for each sex, research has shown striking
sex differences in HGS among adult populations, with males far outscoring females
(Kamarul, Ahmad, and Loh, 2006; Mathiowetz, Kashman, Volland, Weber, Dowe, and
Rogers, 1985). Additionally, senescence accounts for a larger percentage of the variation
in HGS in men, with male HGS declining more quickly after age 30 (Vianna, Oliveira, and
Araujo, 2007). Sex differences have also been observed in forebrain and cardiac
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior

sympathetic nervous responses at the onset of handgrip exercise (Wong, Kimmerly, Masse,
Menon, Cechetto, and Shoemaker, 2007), with smaller cardiovascular response (heart rate
and mean arterial pressure) and weaker insular cortex activation observed in women.
Interestingly, this may reflect both physiological and psychological sex differences when
asked to provide a maximum squeeze of a dynamometer. While greater height, weight, and
muscle mass in males has been submitted as an explanation for this effect (Kallman et al.,
1990; Kamarul et al., 2006; Kuh, et al., 2006), the sexual dimorphism in androgenic
hormones (i.e., testosterone) may be the responsible factor. For instance, men with reduced
testosterone levels caused by androgen deprivation have been shown to have low grip
strength (Soyupek, Soyupek, Perk, and Ozorak, 2008), and supplementary increases in
testosterone enhance HGS as well as lean body mass in elderly men with low serum T
(Page et al., 2005; Sih, Morley, Kaiser, Perry, Patrick, and Ross, 1997; Wang et al., 2000).
This hormonal relationship may, in turn, explain HGS's association with indicators
of male-male competition. Meta-reviews have demonstrated a positive relationship
between testosterone and aggression (Book, Stazyk, and Quinsey, 2001), with this link
often being more clear among males than females (Archer, 1994). In particular, research
on male adolescents (15-17 years) has shown a strong relationship between testosterone
and levels of verbal and physical aggression (Olweus, Mattsson, Schalling, and Low,
1980). This same effect is absent in studies of boys before and at the beginning of puberty
(10-14 years), when they have not yet experienced an influx of testosterone and
reproductive behaviors are less salient (Susman, Inoff-Germain, Nottelmann, Loraiux,
Dutler, and Chrousos, 1987; Inoff-Germain, Arnold, Nottelmann,, Susman, Cutler, and
Chrousos, 1988). Dominance is also positively correlated with testosterone levels in adult
males (Mazur and Booth, 1998), and the act of competing for dominant status can increase
testosterone for the winner, while decreasing it for the loser. Although testosterone levels
are not associated with levels of aggression in younger males (aged 10-14 years), they did
predict perceived dominance in a population of 6-13 year old males (Schaal, Tremblay,
Soussignan, and Susman, 1996). Following a connection with testosterone, studies
investigating HGS and aggression show that the two positively correlate in late adolescent
and adult males (Gallup et al., 2007; Archer and Thanzami, 2007). To our knowledge,
however, HGS has not yet been used in studying peer aggression, dominance, and social
competition among younger adolescents.
The current research presents three studies investigating whether individual
differences in HGS account for any of the observed variance in measures of social
competition (i.e., aggression, popularity, dominance) among males and females. In the first
study, HGS was collected from ninth grade high school students who also self-reported
their involvement in peer aggression and victimization during middle school. The second
study used the same methodology as in Study 1, but examined the retrospective high school
experiences of college-aged students. Both studies also investigated the relationship
between HGS and perceived popularity. The third study investigated the relationship
between the HGS of twelfth grade students and independent ratings of relative peer
aggressiveness and social dominance as perceived by individuals observing their yearbook
photos. Based on previous research indicating a relationship between HGS, health and
attractiveness, independent ratings of physical attractiveness and health were also collected.
Although this third study did not directly measure behavior of the students, it served as a
unique test for whether the underlying physiological features responsible for HGS also

influence outside perceptions of aggression and dominance. We hypothesized that HGS
would be positively correlated with peer aggression and negatively associated with peer
victimization for males, while we did not expect to find a relationship for females.
Likewise, we predicted HGS would correlate positively with independent ratings of
aggressiveness and social dominance in males only. General discussion of these studies
will address evolutionary interpretations regarding intrasexual competition and sexual
selection.
Study 1: Handgrip strength and self-reported aggressive behavior and popularity
during middle school
Materials and Methods
Participants
Participants included 68 male (ages 13-15, M = 14.21, SD = .48) and 70 female
(ages 14-16, M = 14.21, SD = .45) ninth grade high school students from a mid-sized
public high school in upstate New York. Participation in this research was completely
voluntary, and responses were held anonymous. This research was approved by the district
superintendent and the University Institutional Review Board.
Survey
Teachers administered a social experiences survey (slightly modified from
Newman, Holden, and Delville, 2005) to their freshman students during homeroom class
early in the fall semester. Questions included how often they were a victim or perpetrator
of (a) physical aggression (hitting, kicking, physical intimidation) (b) demeaning,
diminishing and embarrassing behavior, (c) isolation, and (d) exclusion during middle
school (victimization:  = .82; aggression:  = .82). Responses were recorded on a 5-point
Likert scale (1 = not at all, 2 = once or twice, 3 = occasionally, 4 = frequently, 5 = very
often), and for each set of questions participants were asked to identify whether the
aggressor or victim was more often a male or female. Composite scores were calculated
for total aggression and victimization during middle school (min 4, max 20). They also
rated their popularity with their peers during middle school (1 = not at all, 2 = a little
popular, 3 = somewhat popular, 4 = fairly popular, 5 = very popular).
Anthropometrics and Analysis
Participants from grades 9-12 were shown how to use a handheld dynamometer
(Lafayette Instruments model 78010) during a yearly health screening session; however, we
were only able to obtain survey data from ninth graders. Each subject was instructed to
squeeze the dynamometer as hard as possible with one hand and then the other.
Measurements were recorded (in kilograms) on two separate squeezes from each hand,
alternating between right and left. Each squeeze was rounded to the nearest kilogram, and
the maximum HGS of the two trials was recorded. The subsequent analyses used the
average of the maximum HGS for each hand. Due to past research indicating a positive
relationship between HGS and age among adolescents (Mathiowetz, Wiemer, and
Federman, 1986), we controlled for age using partial correlations to analyze HGS in
relation to peer aggression/victimization and popularity. Likewise, based on further data
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior

provided by nursing staff following the health screening session, we also controlled for
effects of body mass index (BMI).
Results
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of HGS and peer social experiences for both
males and females. Sex differences in HGS are in accord with results from previous
studies, with males outscoring females (t (136) = 8.71, p < .001, Cohen's d = 1.48). Survey
results indicate that the majority of aggressive peer interactions were intrasexual, with
85.92% of males and 73.55% of females reporting victimization, and 94.34% of males and
75.59% of females reporting aggression described the interactions as predominantly with
members of the same sex. Twenty-one males and 11 females reported not being aggressive
or victimized on any level during middle school. These individuals were included in the
subsequent analyses.

Perceived popularity was not correlated with HGS among males, but it was
positively correlated with HGS in females (r = .302, p < .05). Likewise, perceived
popularity was positively correlated with self-reported peer aggression in females (r = .343,
p < .01), but not males. Pellegrini and Long (2003) witnessed a similar positive
relationship among female middle school students in regards to aggression and dating
popularity. On the other hand, perceived popularity was negatively correlated with peer
victimization in males (r = -.410, p < .001), but not females. Self-reported peer aggression
and victimization were highly intercorrelated in females (r = .489, p < .001), but this was

not true in males (r = .210, p = .091).
Study 2: Handgrip strength and self-reported aggressive behavior and popularity
during high school
Materials and Methods
Participants
This study included 65 male and 52 female undergraduates at a mid-sized public
university in upstate New York. All participants were students in an introductory biology
course and ranged in age from 17-25 (males: M = 19.35, SD = 1.09; females: M = 19.43,
SD = 1.30). Participation was voluntary and all responses were held anonymous. The
University Institutional Review Board approved this research and each individual gave
consent for their participation in this study.
Survey
The same social experiences survey was given as in Study 1, but participants were
asked to respond according to their experiences during high school (victimization:  = .66;
aggression:  = .74). Responses were recorded on the same 5-point Likert scale (1 = not at
all, 2 = once or twice, 3 = occasionally, 4 = frequently, 5 =very often), and for each set of
questions participants identified whether the aggressor or victim was more often a male or
female. As in Study 1, aggression and victimization composite scores were calculated as
an index of overall aggression and victimization across high school (min 4, max 20).
Similarly, a question was asked about how popular they were with their peers during high
school (1 = not at all, 2 = a little popular, 3 = somewhat popular, 4 = fairly popular, 5 =
very popular).
Anthropometrics and Analysis
Similar to Study 1, participants were shown how to use a hand-held dynamometer
(Lafayette Instruments model 78010). Due to more available time, measurements were
recorded on three separate squeezes from each hand, the maximum HGS of the three trials
was recorded (in kilograms), and the subsequent analysis used the average of the maximum
HGS for each hand. In addition, unlike the previous study, data was not collected on
participant BMI. Therefore, analyses only controlled for effects of age using a partial
correlation between HGS and peer aggression/victimization and popularity scores.
Results
Table 3 shows the descriptive statistics of HGS and retrospective peer aggression
and victimization among male and female college students. Consistent with both
previous research and the first study, males had a stronger HGS than females (t (115) =
14.67, p < .001, Cohen's d = 2.80). Responses to the social experiences survey indicate
that 90.10% of males and 81.98% of females reporting victimization stated that it was
predominantly intrasexual, which was also true for 95.83% of males 86.09% of females
reporting aggressive behavior. Four males and nine females reported not being
aggressive or victimized on any level during high school. These individuals were
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior

included in the subsequent analyses.

Note. Victimization and aggression composite scores range from 4 to 20, while popularity ranges from 1 to 5.
Pearson correlations between HGS and peer aggression/victimization and
popularity are shown in Table 4. In males, individuals with higher HGS reported
significantly lower levels of peer victimization during high school (r = -.430, p < .001),
and perceived themselves as more popular during high school (r = .327, p < .05). There
was no relationship between male HGS and peer aggression. In females, HGS was not
correlated with peer victimization or popularity levels during high school. There was a
positive trend between HGS and female aggression, but this was not statistically
significant (r = .277, p = .052). Popularity levels were negatively correlated with reported
peer victimization in both sexes (males: r = -.337, p < .05; females: r = -.346, p < .05),
and as in Study 1, self-reported peer aggression and victimization were positively
correlated among females (r = .357, p < .05), but not in males (r = .155, p = .249).

Study 3: Handgrip strength and perceptions of high school seniors
Materials and Methods
Participants
Five male and four female independent raters (ages 18-28, M = 22.89, SD = 3.26)
were asked to rate yearbook photos of twelfth grade high school students. Participants
included six undergraduate and three graduate students from three separate institutions in
upstate New York. None of the raters had ever lived in the same county of the high school
population, and no one reported recognizing any of the high school students. Participation
was anonymous and completely voluntary. This research was approved by the University
Institutional Review Board.
Questionnaire
A yearbook was obtained from the same high school as in Study 1. Individual
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 8(2). 2010. -236-
senior portraits (6.35cm x 4.45cm) included the face, neck and shoulders of each student. In
all, 69 male (ages 16-18; M = 17.09, SD = .41) and 93 female (ages 16-19; M = 17.10, SD =
.45) twelfth grade students were included in the analysis. Clothing was partially
standardized as all males wore a collared shirt and a tie, and all females wore the same
black, v-necked blouse; however, make-up and hair styles varied between individuals.
Student names were removed and pages were scanned and presented as a packet.
Individual photos were assigned an arbitrary number and the order of yearbook photo
presentation was randomized across raters using Microsoft Excel. Raters were asked to
respond on a 7-point Likert scale to the following questions about each student: (1) how
aggressive do you think this person is among their peers? ( = .75), (2) how dominant do
you think this person is among their peers? ( = .77), (3) how physically attractive do you
find this person? ( = .88), and (4) how healthy do you think this person is? ( = .79). For
each measure, all ratings of an individual were then summed (min 9, max 63).
Anthropometrics and Analysis
Grip strength was recorded during the same health screening session as in Study 1.
Similar to the Study 1, analyses between HGS and ratings of aggressiveness, dominance,
attractiveness and health were conducted using partial correlations controlling for age and
BMI.
Results
Table 5 shows the descriptive statistics for HGS and ratings of aggression and
dominance among male and female 12th grade high school students. As with the previous
two studies, there was a large sex difference in HGS (t (160) = 17.32, p < .001, Cohen's d =
2.70). Table 6 shows the partial correlations controlling for age and BMI between
yearbook photo ratings and HGS in males and females. Males with higher HGS were rated
as more aggressive (r = .302, p < .05), more dominant (r = .301, p < .05), and healthier than
their peers (r = .281, p < .05). There was a positive trend between HGS and ratings of male
attractiveness, but it was not statistically significant (r = .205, p = .099).

Note. Outside ratings of aggression, dominance, attractiveness, and health range from 1 to 7.
In marked contrast, ratings of female photos were unrelated to HGS on all
measures. It is important to note that ratings of aggressiveness and social dominance were
highly intercorrelated across both sexes (r > .75, p < .001 for both), suggesting that ratings
on these traits were actually part of a single aspect of personality perception. Similarly, in
both sexes ratings of health and attractiveness were strongly intercorrelated (r > .75, p <
.001). Each was also associated with perceptions of dominance in both sexes (p < .001),
but the relationship was considerably stronger in males. Ratings of aggression and health
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior

were correlated in males (r = .332, p < 0.01) but not females, and attractiveness and
aggression were not correlated in either sex. If we condensed these four measures into two
factors (aggression-dominance and health-attractiveness), both were positively correlated
with HGS among males (aggression-dominance: r = .318, p < .01; health-attractiveness: r =
.244, p < .05), while there remains no relationship with HGS among females (aggression-
dominance: r = .092, p = .384; health-attractiveness: r = .155, p = .143).

Discussion
The findings from these three studies are consistent with recent evolutionary
hypotheses predicting that characteristics either connected with or developmentally linked
to HGS are important in male-male social competition and sexual selection (Gallup et al.,
2007; Young, 2003). This research indicates that HGS, a simple and easily obtainable
measure of overall strength and muscle function, is in fact an informative variable related
to adolescent social behavior, and thus remains valuable in studying human behavior from
an evolutionary perspective.
Measures of socially dominant behavior and appearance were significantly
correlated with HGS in males, but this was only true during late adolescence (i.e., high
school). In the first study, HGS was unrelated to measures of aggression and victimization
during middle school in both male and female ninth graders. In the second study, male
college students with higher HGS reported fewer instances of intrasexual peer victimization
during high school, and perceived themselves as more popular. In the third study, raters
observing only yearbook photos perceived twelfth grade males with higher HGS as being
more aggressive, more dominant and healthier. For females, the only significant
correlation with HGS was in Study 1, revealing a positive correlation between HGS and
perceived popularity. It remains unclear why this association was present for females and
not males, but future research should examine variables contributing to middle school
popularity that may also be associated with HGS (see Eder and Kinney, 1995). Overall,
these findings are consistent with previous research indicating that HGS is related to
socially dominant behaviors and appearance nearly exclusively in males. These sex
differences are likely related to the sexually dimorphic expression of aggression among
adolescents (Archer, 2004), with males typically using direct, physical forms of aggression
compared to females, and therefore physical strength should contribute to this effect.
Interestingly, Study 1 revealed no relationship between male HGS and the observed
Handgrip Strength & Dominant Behavior

social variables during middle school. These results match up with those showing a lack of
a relationship between testosterone and aggression among younger adolescent males aged
10-14 years (Susman et al., 1987; Inoff-Germain et al., 1988). Although physical
aggression is known to decrease during adolescent development (Brame, Nagin, and
Tremblay, 2001), our data suggests that the importance of physical strength may increase in
competitive social contexts during high school when reproductive activities are more
salient. In other words, a male's overall strength or androgenic development (i.e.,
masculine-specific body configuration) may be more central to social competition during
high school, as these features become more pronounced with advanced pubertal
development and the disparity among physical size and stature decreases. It is possible that
the variation in physical maturation among early adolescent boys makes HGS an unreliable
measure of social competition during middle school. In other words, the implicit
awareness that some boys have not yet had their growth spurt may play a more pronounced
role in male-male physical competition.
We suggest the relevance of HGS to late adolescent social experiences almost
certainly lies in relation to physiological, developmental, and genetic underpinnings. In
turn, we propose that blood testosterone levels may be the foremost contributing factor to
the observed variation in HGS among adult males. Consistent with this view, testosterone
levels have been positively linked to both male aggression (Book et al., 2001) and
dominance (Mazur and Booth, 1998). Likewise, testosterone levels have been shown to
increase dramatically with initial pubertal development in males (115 ng/dl at age 13 to 364
ng/dl at age 15, see Rowe, Maughan, Worthman, Costello, and Angold, 2004), and in our
sample there was a strong positive correlation between male HGS and age among ninth
graders (ages 13-15; r = .473), but not twelfth graders (ages 16-18; r = .031). In accord
with the findings from Study 3, previous research has revealed that the faces of males with
high testosterone are also perceived as more dominant (Swaddle and Reierson, 2002).
Likewise, the overall results find HGS to predict similar socially dominant behaviors with
reported links to testosterone levels in post-pubescent males only (Inoff-Germain et al.,
1988; Olweus et al., 1980; Susman et al., 1987). The fact that perceived aggressiveness
and social dominance actually predicted a male's HGS signifies that not only is one's initial
perceived personality correlated to underlying physiological features, but this may be what
ultimately provides the observer with the information necessary to make adaptive social
decisions. It remains unknown whether raters based their decisions on specific facial
features or if other aspects of body morphology present within the photos (e.g., shoulder
breadth) contributed to their perceptions. These issues notwithstanding, past research
shows that a male's HGS is predictive of facial characteristics (Shoup and Gallup, 2008)
and shoulder breadth and circumference (Gallup et al., 2007). Therefore, it is not
necessarily important that the exact features used for rating are identified, and instead, it is
likely that raters used a combination of visual cues.
Previous research has indicated that features associated with or directly linked to
HGS may be under sexual selection, as HGS correlates with earlier sexual activity and
more sexual partners in males (Gallup et al., 2007). The current research suggests that
these reproductive advantages may be gained at least partially through social dominance, a
trait that is cross-culturally preferred by females seeking mates (Shackelford, Schmitt, and
Buss, 2003). Older males with higher HGS reported lower intrasexual peer victimization,
higher popularity levels, and were rated as more aggressive and dominant compared to their

peers. Taken together, these variables may serve as a proxy for social dominance during
adolescence. Consistent with this interpretation, past research reveals perceived dominance
to be a strong predictor of sexual activity in adolescent males (Mazur, Halpern, and Urdy,
1994).
Some limitations to this research include the fact that these social variables were not
directly observed, and instead were either self-reported in a survey or perceived through
outside raters. As a result this may not reflect actual aggressive or dominant behaviors of
the adolescents. We also did not investigate motives behind peer aggression or to what
degree physical strength and prowess was involved in aggressive or dominant interactions.
However, the current research does offer insight into sex differences in physical strength
and socially dominant behaviors during distinct periods of adolescent development, and
further supports previous research showing strong sex differences in the relationship
between HGS and social variables. In addition, the results provide evidence that changes in
HGS may accurately reflect changes in testosterone levels, due to consistency in how these
variables reliably predict aggression and dominance among older, but not younger
adolescent males. In order to more directly test these hypotheses, future research should
measure aggressive behavior through a combination of survey use and ethnographic
methodology, and directly investigate the correlation between HGS and testosterone across
age ranges. Previous research already supports this connection, revealing a positive
relationship between serum testosterone and the development of strength parameters
(including HGS) in adolescent males aged 10-12 years (Hansen, Bangsbo, Twisk and
Klausen, 1999).
Although HGS was the only morphological measurement taken in these studies, it is
important to note that features such as overall larger body size and masculine specific body
morphology (which are also associated with higher testosterone levels) may be contributing
factors, and therefore could also be collected in future research. However, we argue that
when considering HGS in terms of male-male competition and dominance, that it can be
done independent of body configuration because unlike HGS, large body size is unrelated
to health and vitality. In addition, it is not simply size and appearance that facilitate social
competition and dominance in males, but a combination of physical prowess, vitality, and
social ability; and current and past findings imply that HGS is strongly connected to all of
these measures (Arroyo et al., 2007; Fredericksen et al., 2002; Gallup et al., 2007;
Giampaoli et al., 1999; Hughes et al., 1997; Laukkanen et al., 1995; Rantanen et al., 2000;
Sasaki et al., 2007; Stenholm et al., 2008).
Overall, the present research reveals that individual differences in HGS account for
a significant portion of variance among measures of social competition in older adolescent
males. This research provides support for the evolutionary view that features linked with
higher HGS (i.e., testosterone) have been selected for in males due to various competitive
advantages. In summary, HGS is an easily obtainable and highly informative measure
related to adolescent male behavior that should be considered in future research
investigating social-sexual competition. Due to the limitations of high potential costs, as
well as low reliabilities associated with testosterone measures owing to differences in the
time of collection, HGS may be an appropriate alternative for assessing student
populations.
