For diseases with an infectious etiology, birth order may dictate the age of exposure to childhood infection,
while sibship size may be a proxy for the probability of exposure. The authors examined whether birth order,
sibship size, and childhood housing density affect risk of tooth loss and periodontal disease. The study included
28,690 adults aged 42 years who were participating in a 1998­2002 follow-up of persons listed in the Swedish
Twin Registry. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals, with
adjustment for age, sex, education, and smoking and mutual adjustment for family composition (sibship size and/
or birth order). Tooth loss and periodontal disease affected 8% and 19% of the twins, respectively. Each
additional sibling increased the odds of tooth loss by 10% (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.15) and the odds
of periodontal disease by 5% (95% CI: 1.02, 1.08). Later birth order was associated with lower odds of periodontal
disease. Each additional person per room in the childhood home increased the odds of tooth loss (odds ratio =
1.28, 95% CI: 1.03, 1.60) but lowered the odds of periodontal disease (odds ratio = 0.65, 95% CI: 0.48, 0.89).
These findings are compatible with the hypotheses that adult oral diseases are associated with the probability of
exposure in childhood and that earlier age at exposure lowers risk.

Periodontal disease is a chronic condition with an infec-
tious origin. Oral bacteria stimulate host inflammation as
part of the healing process. However, perturbation of host
defense mechanisms can result in the destruction of bone and
connective tissue that support teeth, leading to tooth
mobility, pain, and ultimately tooth loss. Periodontal disease
represents an important public health burden among adults in
Europe and the United States, with more than 15 percent
having a severe form of the disease (1, 2). Given its possible
association with severe systemic conditions such as cardio-
vascular disease, periodontal status may itself be a risk factor
for mortality (3).
Birth order and sibship size have consistently been associ-
ated with other diseases hypothesized to have an infectious
etiology, including peptic ulcer (4), allergies and asthma (5),
and certain cancers (6, 7). Birth order may dictate the age of
exposure to common childhood infections, under the
assumption that firstborn children are not exposed until they
enter school, while later-born children are exposed at an
earlier age through their older siblings (8, 9). Sibship size
may be a proxy for the probability of exposure to infectious

agents during childhood. Greater sibship size is associated
with a greater probability of exposure to infectious agents
and thus generally increases risk of disease later in life. For
birth order, however, the direction of the effect is dependent
on the infectious agent and its relation to clinical disease. For
example, exposure to Epstein-Barr virus earlier in life is
hypothesized to reduce the risk of Hodgkin's disease (8),
whereas exposure to hepatitis B virus at an earlier age
appears to increase the risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (6).
Person-to-person transmission of periodontal pathogens
occurs via saliva, and increased frequency of exposure to
infectious saliva increases the likelihood of bacterial coloni-
zation (10). Periodontal pathogens can be transmitted among
family members (10), and familial transmission may be a
risk factor for progression to periodontal disease (11). In
addition, the bacteria involved in the pathogenesis of oral
diseases are often colonized and already established in child-
hood, although risk of colonization appears to be higher
among children not exposed to bacteria until later in child-
hood (12, 13). Once colonization occurs, the bacteria remain
present and thus may determine a person's future periodontal
status (10).
On the basis of these previous studies, we would hypothe-
size that larger sibship size, by increasing the probability of
exposure, and earlier birth order, by delaying age at expo-
sure, would increase the risk of periodontal disease and tooth
loss. Housing density might influence the timing of expo-
sure, through greater person-to-person contact with parents
or other family members as an infant, or may reflect lower
socioeconomic status during childhood and thus less access
to dental treatment. To our knowledge, no previous study has
tested these hypotheses. To this end, we examined the asso-
ciations between birth order, sibship size, and housing
density and risk of tooth loss and periodontal disease in a
population-based cohort of Swedish adults.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
The data for the present investigation were obtained from
the Swedish Twin Registry (14, 15). The Swedish Twin
Registry is currently the largest population-based twin
registry in the world, with entries on more than 70,000 twin
pairs born in Sweden since 1886. The Registry was assem-
bled in the late 1950s and early 1970s, and the twins have
been prospectively followed through postal questionnaires,
telephone interviews, and in-person screenings. Between
1998 and 2002, all twins who were born before 1958 were
invited to participate in Screening Across the Lifespan of
Twins (SALT), a computer-assisted telephone interview
eliciting information on health outcomes, risk factors,
preventive behaviors, and familial and demographic factors.
Twins were interviewed regardless of the vital status or
participation of their co-twin. The SALT study was
approved by the institutional review board of the Karolinska
Institutet, and the twins provided oral consent to participate
in the study.
As of February 2002, 37,432 twins had completed the
SALT screening. To reduce the length of the interview,
questions on selected topics were limited to a subsample of
the cohort during the latter 2 years. Questions on oral health
were asked of all twins interviewed through 2000 but were
limited to persons aged 65 years or younger in 2001 and
2002. It is unlikely that this would have led to any bias, since
twins were selected randomly each month for participation.
Thus, information on dental health was available from
10,718 complete twin pairs and 7,254 single-responding
twins (N = 28,690 twins (2 × 10,718 + 7,254)).
Study variables
The principal exposure variables were birth order, sibship
size, and childhood housing density. Each twin reported the
number of liveborn siblings in his or her family and the order
of his or her birth with respect to other siblings. Sibship size
was defined as the total number of siblings plus the two
twins. Data on housing density were available for the 456
SALT twins who had previously participated in the Swedish
Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (16). Briefly, twin pairs
reared apart and matched control twin pairs reared together
were part of this longitudinal study of aging. Twins in the
Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging reported the
number of rooms in their childhood home and the number of
persons who had shared that home. An index of housing
density was created by dividing the number of individuals by
the number of rooms.
Oral health status was based on self-reported information
from the SALT screening. All twins were asked, "Do you
have your own teeth?". Tooth loss was defined as not having
any of one's own teeth. Participants who were not edentu-
lous were also asked, "Have you been diagnosed by a dentist
as having loose teeth or periodontal disease?" and "Do you
have or have you ever had any teeth which are loose or move
around?". Participants who responded that a dentist had told
them they had periodontal disease or who reported that they
had ever had tooth mobility were defined as having peri-
odontal disease.
Statistical analysis
Logistic regression analyses were used to assess the roles
of sibship size, birth order, and housing density in risk of
tooth loss and periodontal disease, controlling for potential
confounders. Covariates that changed the odds ratio for the
main effect by more than 10 percent or that were significant
at  = 0.20 and that were not on the causal pathway were
kept in the final model (17). We evaluated the linearity of
variables for sibship size, birth order, housing density, and
age on the log scale to determine whether the relations
followed linear trends. Higher-order terms for continuous
variables were also explored.
All analyses were conducted using the GENMOD proce-
dure in SAS (version 8.2; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, North
Carolina). Because of potential cluster-correlation within
twin pairs, confidence intervals calculated under the assump-
tion of independence may be biased (usually too narrow).
Thus, we adapted the alternating logistic regression model
proposed by Carey et al. (18) to account for the correlated
data of twin pairs. We further allowed for twin pair correla-

tions for the outcome to vary for monozygotic and dizygotic
twins (the relevant SAS code is presented in the Appendix).
Odds ratios and 95 percent confidence intervals were calcu-
lated. The results of trend tests are also presented. Results
were adjusted for age (continuous variable), age squared,
sex, education (categorical--university, gymnasium, mili-
tary/vocational, compulsory, elementary, other), and
smoking status (categorical--current daily smoker, current
nondaily smoker, former daily smoker, former nondaily
smoker, never smoker) and were mutually adjusted for
sibship size and/or birth order.
RESULTS
Information on tooth loss and periodontal disease was
analyzed for 28,690 participants. In this population-based
sample of Swedish adults aged 42 years or more, the cumula-
tive risk of tooth loss was 8 percent and the lifetime preva-
lence of periodontal disease was 19 percent (table 1). Almost
15 percent of the twins had a sibship size of seven or more,
and 60 percent had been born first or second among their
siblings. In the subsample of 456 twins who also participated
in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging, 38 percent
grew up in a household with a density of two or more people
per room.
The likelihood of tooth loss and periodontal disease
according to characteristics of the study population is
presented in table 2. Tooth loss and periodontal disease were
more common among those with larger sibship sizes and
those born later with respect to other siblings in the family.
Twins living in the most crowded homes during childhood
were more likely to have complete tooth loss. In contrast,
periodontal disease was higher for those who had lived in a
home with less than one person per room during childhood.
Crude and adjusted odds ratios for tooth loss and peri-
odontal disease by sibship size are presented in table 3. After
adjustment for age, sex, education, and smoking, sibship size
was positively associated with both tooth loss and peri-
odontal disease. Further adjustment for birth order did not
substantially change the odds ratios. For each additional
sibling in the family, the odds of tooth loss increased 10
percent (95 percent confidence interval (CI): 1.06, 1.15).
Respondents with eight or more siblings in the family had
1.8 times' greater odds of tooth loss than those with two
siblings. Similarly, the odds ratio for periodontal disease per

additional sibling was 1.05 (95 percent CI: 1.02, 1.08).
Persons with six or more siblings in the family had approxi-
mately 30 percent greater odds of periodontal disease than
those with two siblings.
Data on birth order and oral disease are presented in table
4. The apparently higher risk of oral disease associated with
later birth order was attenuated after adjustment for age, sex,
education, and smoking. There was no evidence of a linear
trend or any association between birth order and tooth loss.
The effect of birth order on periodontal disease was inverted
upon mutual adjustment by sibship size, so that later birth
was protective against periodontal disease later in life (per
increase in (later) birth order, odds ratio = 0.97, 95 percent
CI: 0.94, 1.00). Persons born sixth or later among their
siblings had almost 20 percent lower odds of periodontal
disease than those born first.
Data on the relation of childhood housing density to risk of
tooth loss and periodontal disease among the 456 twins who
provided this information are presented in figure 1. After
results were controlled for birth order, sibship size, and other
factors, the odds of tooth loss increased with increasing
crowding in the childhood home (per additional person per
room, odds ratio = 1.28, 95 percent CI: 1.03, 1.60). In
comparison with a childhood housing density of less than
one person per room, the odds ratios were 1.2 (95 percent CI:
0.4, 4.2) for a density of 1­1.9 people per room, 1.5 (95
percent CI: 0.4, 5.1) for a density of 2­3.9 people per room,
and 2.8 (95 percent CI: 0.7, 10.8) for a density of 4 people
per room. In contrast, exposure to more crowded living
conditions during childhood was associated with lower odds
of periodontal disease (per additional person per room, odds
ratio = 0.65, 95 percent CI: 0.48, 0.89). The odds ratios for
periodontal disease were 0.45 (95 percent CI: 0.22, 0.93) for
a density of 1­1.9, 0.32 (95 percent CI: 0.14, 0.71) for a
density of 2­3.9, and 0.33 (95 percent CI: 0.09, 1.16) for a
density of 4, as compared with a density of less than one
person per room.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide infor-
mative data on the effect of familial characteristics on peri-
odontal disease and tooth loss. These analyses demonstrated
an important role for childhood family environment in the

etiology of oral diseases in adulthood. Our findings will help
in developing an infectious model for understanding these
oral diseases. Sibship size was positively related to peri-
odontal disease, suggesting that the risk is increased with
increasing probability of exposure to infectious agents
during childhood. The inverse association with birth order
and periodontal disease suggests that earlier exposure to
infectious agents is protective against disease in adulthood.
We found no evidence of an association between birth
order and tooth loss. In addition to periodontal disease,
however, dental caries is an important contributor to tooth
loss. Two earlier epidemiologic studies, without controlling
for confounding, examined the effect of birth order on dental
caries. Zadik (19) observed that the prevalence of caries
among children was lower among those with an earlier birth
order, while Mansbridge (20) noted the opposite. The lack of
an association with respect to birth order and tooth loss may
highlight the complexity of oral pathogen immunity
involved in this condition. A positive effect of sibship size
on dental caries in children has been consistently noted (19­
22). In line with the data on periodontal disease, this obser-
vation is consistent with the higher risk of tooth loss noted
with larger sibship size.
Information on housing density in childhood provided
additional evidence for a role of transmission during child-
hood. The number of people per room in the childhood home
was positively associated with risk of tooth loss but nega-
tively associated with periodontal disease. These opposing
effects of household crowding are intriguing, and we can
only hypothesize a possible mechanism. Tooth loss is the
ultimate outcome of untreated oral disease, particularly peri-
odontal disease and dental caries. Thus, risk factors for tooth
loss will reflect both the infectious mechanisms of oral
disease and predictors of a lack of access to dental treatment.
Housing density might influence the timing of exposure,
through greater person-to-person contact with parents or
other family members as an infant. In addition, a more
crowded home may reflect lower socioeconomic status
during childhood and less access to dental treatment. Thus,
the inverse association between household crowding and
periodontal disease may be indicative of the infectious
disease process. Whether or not a person receives treatment
for oral disease during childhood will predict tooth loss

during adult life, which is reflected in the positive associa-
tion between housing density and tooth loss.
The data from our study agree with data from other
research exploring the infectious etiology of oral diseases.
The person-to-person transmission of pathogens involved in
both periodontal disease (10) and dental caries (23) has been
documented. Indeed, genotyping of Streptococcus mutans, a
bacterium causing dental caries, suggests direct transmission
of the bacterium within families (24). One interpretation of
our study, in light of these data, is that sibship size is a proxy
for the probability of exposure to oral infection during child-
hood.
One of the responsible bacteria in the pathogenesis of peri-
odontal disease, Actinobacillus actinomycetemcomitans,
appears to be resistant to colonization among infants and
toddlers but can become established in the oral cavity when
children are first exposed at 5­7 years of age (12, 13). Peri-
odontal bacteria remain present long after colonization
occurs, and they may become active during transient bacter-
emia (10). Age at initial exposure is a major determinant of
the outcome of infection, that is, immunity versus clinical
disease. For many infections, early exposure is associated
with durable immunity, whereas delayed exposure results in
a higher ratio of clinical disease to immunity (8). Our data on
an association between birth order and periodontal status
provide supportive evidence that this is true. The observed
reduction in periodontal disease risk may be a function of
exposure to maternal antibodies, priming and maturation of
the immune system during early life (25), or earlier develop-
ment of herd immunity (26).
Our study had a number of strengths and limitations to
consider. We took a retrospective approach to assessing the
impact of exposure to childhood infection on oral disease
risk in adult life using existing resources. The Swedish Twin
Registry is population-based, and participation in the follow-
up study was high (~75 percent). Thus, selection bias is
likely to have been minimal. Given the sample size, we had
substantial statistical power to detect an effect of birth order
and sibship size. Although the number of persons who
provided information on housing density was lower, power
calculations conducted after the fact suggested that we had
98 percent power to detect an odds ratio of 0.33 for the
highest group versus the lowest.
The SALT interview collected extensive data on covari-
ates, and we adjusted for the major risk factors for these
conditions. It is possible that residual confounding may
exist. Given the strength of the association between cigarette
smoking and periodontal health, we systematically evaluated
possible residual confounding due to smoking. In analyses
restricted to never smokers, the odds ratios were similar to
those obtained for all participants, providing evidence of no
residual confounding by smoking.
The data collected through SALT were based on self-
report and may have been subject to a degree of misclassifi-
cation. For birth order and sibship size, we assessed the
percentage of agreement between twins. We found that 76
percent of twins were concordant for sibship size, and 96
percent gave a sibship size plus or minus one sibling. For
birth order, twins were 86 percent concordant, and 98
percent gave a birth order plus or minus one order. The fact
that some twins were off by one sibling or one birth order
may reflect some respondents' interpretation of the question
and the fact that they were twins. For example, some twins
who were asked about the number of siblings may or may
not have included themselves. The extent of exposure
misclassification was fairly minimal and therefore should
not have distorted the findings.
FIGURE 1. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs) for the relation of childhood
housing density to tooth loss (top) and periodontal disease (bottom)
among twins participating in Screening Across the Lifespan of Twins
who also participated in the Swedish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging
(n = 456), Swedish Twin Registry, 1998­2002. Childhood housing
density was defined as the number of people in the household
divided by the number of rooms in the household during childhood.
The odds ratio represents the odds of disease per additional person
per room, modeled as an ordinal variable. Odds ratios were adjusted for
age (continuous variable), age squared, sex, education (categorical--
university, gymnasium, compulsory/elementary, military/vocational,
other), smoking status (current, former, never), birth order, and sib-
ship size. CI, confidence interval.
Relation of Family Characteristics to Periodontal Disease 505
Am J Epidemiol 2004;159:499­506
The validity of self-reported information on periodontal
measures has created considerable debate among oral health
professionals, though few studies have directly examined
this issue. Self-reported tooth loss appears to have good
validity compared with clinical assessment in community-
based samples (27). Among health professionals, the validity
of self-reporting for periodontal disease is high, particularly
among those with severe disease (28). The applicability of
these findings is potentially limited, given the health aware-
ness of this population. In one study of a community sample
of Swedish adults, agreement between self-reported assess-
ment of periodontal pockets and clinical examination was
relatively high (29), while the correlation between tooth
mobility and clinical examination was lower. Since the
survey questions differed from those in SALT, we cannot
directly extrapolate those results to the present study. Within
our own data, we find supportive evidence for minimal
misclassification of data on the oral health measures. First,
tooth loss and periodontal disease in this study were associ-
ated with their established risk factors, that is, smoking, age,
and education. Second, reliability data from a small sample
of twins who were recontacted 2 weeks after the initial
SALT interview suggested that there was excellent reli-
ability for both tooth loss ( = 86.5 percent) and periodontal
disease ( = 89.0 percent). If there was misclassification of
disease, it is unlikely to have been related to family charac-
teristics and thus would have been nondifferential. In
general, this would have tended to bias estimates toward the
null. Thus, if anything, our findings would have underesti-
mated the true associations.
In this study, we used birth order, sibship size, and housing
density as proxy measures. Given the length of time between
exposure during childhood and onset of adult oral diseases, it
is difficult to study early-life exposures by other means.
Although the association between family characteristics and
periodontal health is consistent with a role of childhood
infection, these proxy measures may be indicative of some
other underlying process occurring during childhood. For
example, sibship size may be indicative of other family
effects, such as influences on oral hygiene and dental habits
later in life, or it could indicate a lower level of access to
health services earlier in life. Notwithstanding this limita-
tion, the data support a role of early familial environment in
the risk of periodontal disease and edentulism occurring in
adulthood.
Given the disease burden caused by periodontal disease
and tooth loss, it is important both to understand the etiology
of the disease and to design public health interventions for
prevention. This study may have potential use from both
perspectives, by identifying possible windows of opportu-
nity during childhood to reduce transmission of oral patho-
gens and by contributing information to the infectious
disease model of oral health.

APPENDIX
Below we present the SAS code for alternating logistic
regression models. Use of this method allows twin pair
correlations for the outcome to vary for monozygotic and
dizygotic twins.
proc genmod data = twins;
class twinid mz;
model perio = sibship/type 3 error = bin link = logit;
repeated subject = twinid/logor = logorvar (mz) covb;
run;
In this model, "twinid" represents the identification for
each twin pair, and mz is a binary variable indicating
monozygotic twins. "Perio" is the outcome variable for peri-
odontal disease, and "sibship" is the ordinal exposure for
sibship size. The statement "logor = logorvar (mz)" allows
for the effect of zygosity to differ as a function of the odds
ratio.
