Abstract
Objective: A prospective, double-blind, randomized controlled trial to compare the effect of
preoperative midazolam or ketamine on the incidence of emergence agitation (EA) following
sevoflurane anaesthesia in children.
Methods: Paediatric patients (2­6 years old) undergoing ophthalmic surgery were allocated to
receive premedication with either 0.1 mg/kg midazolam or 1 mg/kg ketamine. Incidence of EA and
postoperative pain scores were recorded at 10-min intervals in the postanaesthetic care unit
(PACU). The use of EA rescue medications (fentanyl or midazolam) was recorded.
Results: The incidence of EA was significantly lower in the ketamine group (n ¼ 33) than the
midazolam group (n ¼ 34) at 10 and 20 min after transfer to PACU. There was no significant
difference in overall incidence of EA. The frequency of midazolam use as rescue medication was
significantly lower in the katamine group than in the midazolam group.
Conclusion: Premedication with ketamine is more effective than midazolam in preventing EA
during the early emergence period after sevoflurane anaesthesia in children.

Introduction
Emergence agitation (EA) comprises
restlessness, disorientation, inconsolable
crying and cognitive impairment following
general anaesthesia, and is frequently
observed in preschool-aged children.1

Paediatric patients undergoing ophthalmic
surgery may experience severe EA due to
visual disturbance.2 Although the pathogen-
esis of EA remains unclear, factors including
inhalation anaesthesia (sevoflurane anaesthe-
sia in particular), pain, surgery and a high level
of preoperative anxiety are known to affect
EA.1­4 It has been suggested that the rapid and
differential elimination of residual inhalation
anaesthetics may cause EA in surgical
patients,1 but others have shown that rapid
awakening is not the cause of EA following
sevoflurane anaesthesia in children.5
Children who are more anxious during
induction of anaesthesia have higher EA
scores on entrance to the recovery room
than less anxious children,3 and difficult
separation of paediatric patients from their
parents is also a risk factor for postoperative
EA.6 Standard pharmacological interven-
tions such as propofol, ketamine and fen-
tanyl have been shown to have prophylactic
effects in preventing EA in children.7
Midazolam is a commonly used sedative
in children that has beneficial effects in
reducing paediatric EA. Preoperative oral
midazolam decreases both preoperative sep-
aration anxiety and the degree of EA
observed with sevoflurane anaesthesia.8
Ketamine crosses the blood­brain barrier
rapidly and reaches maximal effect in 1 min.
Premedication with oral ketamine (6 mg/kg)
has been shown to reduce EA in children
undergoing adenotonsillectomy under
desflurane anaesthesia, without retarding
recovery.9 In addition, the administration
of 1 mg/kg ketamine intravenously (i.v.),
followed by 1 mg/kg per h ketamine infusion
during anaesthesia, reduces EA in paediatric
strabismus surgery with sevoflurane anaes-
thesia.10 A combination of i.v. ketamine plus
midazolam was more effective than keta-
mine alone for sedation during a brief
painful procedure in children.11
To the best of our knowledge, there
are few studies focusing on the effects
of intravenous midazolam or ketamine
(administered as anaesthetic premedication)
on EA following general anaesthesia in
children. The aim of the present study was
to compare the effects of preoperative mid-
azolam and ketamine i.v. injection on EA
after sevoflurane anaesthesia in children.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective study recruited patients
aged 2­6 years old with American Society
of Anesthesiologists physical status 1 or 2,
scheduled to undergo elective ophthalmic
surgery (procedures <2 h) at Haeundae Paik
Hospital, Busan, Republic of Korea,
between January 2013 and January 2014.
Children with neurological disorders, his-
tory of allergy to the study drugs, or
respiratory tract infection within the previ-
ous 2 weeks were excluded.
Patients were randomly assigned to either
the midazolam group (0.1 mg/kg midazolam
i.v.) or ketamine group (1.0 mg/kg ketamine
i.v.) using a computer generated randomiza-
tion program (www.random.org).
This prospective study was approved by
the institutional review board of Haeundae
Paik Hospital, Busan, Republic of Korea,
and the parents of each child provided
written informed consent prior to enrolment
(ClinicalTrials.gov number, NCT02256358).
Anaesthesia
At 1 h before surgery, intravenous access
was obtained after applying topical anaes-
thesia (ANES cream [lidocaine­prilocaine],
Tai Guk Pharm Co., Ltd, Seoul, Republic of
Korea). After patients arrived in the waiting
room (but before premedication), an inde-
pendent anaesthetist who was not involved
in this study assessed the emotional status
of each child using a three-point scale
(1 ¼ calm, 2 ¼ anxious but not crying,
3 ¼ anxious and crying). A nurse who was
blinded to the study conditions administered
Kim et al. 259
study drugs (total volume 5 ml) according to
group allocation, and the emotional state of
each child was then reassessed by the same
anaesthetist as before (after premedication).
Patients were transferred to the operating
room with monitoring for oxygen saturation,
electrocardiogram (ECG), noninvasive blood
pressure (BP) and pulse oximetry. General
anaesthesia was induced with atropine
(0.01 mg/kg), propofol (2mg/kg) and fen-
tanyl (1mg/kg). Rocuronium (0.6mg/kg)
was administered to facilitate endotracheal
intubation. The Induction Compliance
Checklist (ICC) was used to measure anxiety
during induction of anaesthesia.12 General
anaesthesia was maintained with sevoflurane
2­3 vol% and 50% oxygen in air. End-tidal
carbon dioxide (EtCO2
) and bispectral
index (BIS, Aspect Medical System,
Norwood, MA, USA) were maintained
at 30­35 mmHg and 40­60, respectively.
Surgery began within 20­25 min following
administration of premedication.
At the end of surgery, sevoflurane was
discontinued and extubation was per-
formed. An anaesthetist who was blinded
to study conditions evaluated EA, post-
operative pain score, heart rate and oxygen
saturation at 10-min intervals for 30 min in
the post-anaesthesia care unit (PACU).
Study endpoints
The primary endpoint of the study was the
overall incidence of postoperative EA,
defined as an Aono's four-point
scale (AFPS) score of !3.13 When EA
occurred, patients received 0.1 mg/kg fen-
tanyl i.v., regardless of the presence of their
parent(s). If EA persisted after two doses of
fentanyl, patients received 0.1 mg/kg mid-
azolam i.v. Postoperative pain was assessed
using the Children's and Infants'
Postoperative Pain Scale (CHIPPS).14 The
highest EA and CHIPPS score during recov-
ery and the frequency of fentanyl and
midazolam administration were recorded.
Postoperative complications (nausea,
vomiting, shivering) were noted. Children
were transferred to the general ward when
they recovered from anaesthesia (modified
Aldrete score > 9).15 Duration of anaesthe-
sia, duration of surgery, time to extubation
and length of stay in the PACU were
recorded for each patient.
Statistical analyses
The sample size calculation was performed
based on a pilot study where the between-
group difference in incidence of EA was
30%. By calculating a power of 80%, type 1
error of 5% and drop-out rate of 10%, each
group required 34 patients.
Data were presented as mean Æ SD.
Between group comparisons were made
with 2-test for categorical variables, inde-
pendent samples t-test for continuous vari-
ables and Mann­Whitney U-test for rank
scales. Spearman's correlation coefficient
was used to investigate associations between
AFPS and CHIPPS scores. Statistical ana-
lyses were performed using SPSSÕ version
21.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ, and MedCalc version 14.12.0
(MedCalc Software bvba, Ostend, Belgium).
P-values < 0.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
The study randomized 68 patients (32 male/
36 female; mean age 4.18 Æ 1.33 years; age
range 2­6 years). A single patient in the
ketamine group was excluded due to
extended duration of surgery (>2 h). The
final analysis included 34 patients in the
midazolam group (16 male/18 female; mean
age 4.15 Æ 1.40 years; age range 2­6 years)
and 33 patients in the ketamine group (16
male/17 female; mean age 4.21 Æ 1.32 years;
age range 2­6 years). A CONSORT flow
diagram for the study is shown Figure 1, and
demographic and clinical data are given in

graphic or clinical parameter. Emotional
status scores were significantly lower follow-
ing premedication in both groups (P < 0.001

Data regarding the incidence of EA in
the PACU are given in Table 2. There was

group at 10 min and 20 min after arrival in
the PACU (P ¼ 0.011 and P ¼ 0.042,
respectively).

There was no statistically significant
between-group difference in the frequency
of fentanyl use. The frequency of midazolam
use was significantly lower in the ketamine
group than in the midazolam group
(P ¼ 0.042; Table 3). A total of four patients
in the midazolam group required both fen-
tanyl and midazolam. No patient in the
ketamine group required both drugs.
There was a significant positive correl-
ation between peak CHIPPS and peak
AFPS scores in the total study population
(r ¼ 0.816, P < 0.001). There were no statis-
tically significant between-group differences
in CHIPPS at any time point (Table 4). No
complications were observed in either
group.

incidence of EA, in paediatric patients
undergoing ophthalmic surgery with sevo-
flurane anaesthesia. The administration of
ketamine as premedication decreased both
the occurrence of EA during the early
emergence period (10­20 min) and the use
of rescue drugs compared with midazolam
premedication. Midazolam and ketamine
had similar effects at reducing preanaesthe-
sia separation anxiety in the present study.
Emergence agitation is observed in
around 40% of preschool-aged children
following sevoflurane anaesthesia;13 it
causes discomfort and can lead to critical
problems during the early recovery period.
Inconsolable crying or restlessness is the
most commonly observed manifestation
during the initial 10 min of recovery.6
Premedication with ketamine significantly
decreased the incidence of EA during the
first 20 min of recovery after sevoflurane
anaesthesia, compared with midazolam pre-
medication, in the present study.
Midazolam is widely used as a pre-
medication to decrease anxiety in children
prior to surgery, but its effects on EA are
unclear. Premedication with oral midazolam
has been shown to decrease the incidence of
EA without delaying discharge from the
PACU.16 In addition, intravenous adminis-
tration of a subhypnotic dose of midazolam
(0.05 mg/kg), in addition to fentanyl before
discontinuation of sevoflurane, was also
found to be effective in decreasing EA.17
In contrast, however, others found that
intravenous midazolam did not reduce the
incidence of EA.18,19 A meta-analysis of
pharmacological prevention of EA in
children indicated that midazolam was inef-
fective in the prevention of EA in this
context.7
Ketamine is a traditional intraoperative
anaesthetic agent and is a useful premedica-
tion for sedating fearful children in
the surgical waiting room.20 The NMDA-
antagonistic properties of ketamine may be

important in attenuating sensitization and
opioid tolerance, and have sparked interest in
the use of subanaesthetic doses for pain
control.21 Ketamine has pre-emptive anal-
gesic effects and decreases the development of
EA following adenotonsillectomy in chil-
dren.22,23 These data are consistent with the
results of our study, which demonstrated that
premedication with i.v. ketamine compared
with midazolam decreased the incidence of
EA in children undergoing ophthalmic sur-
gery. Low-dose ketamine as an adjuvant to
opioids or local anaesthetics may perform a
substantial function in the reduction of acute
postoperative pain and may also reduce the
dose of rescue analgesics.24
Premedication with i.v. ketamine was
more effective than i.v. midazolam in redu-
cing the occurrence of EA in the present
study. The elimination half-life of ketamine
(2.5­2.8 h) is longer than that of midazolam
(1.7­2.6 h).25 The co-administration of keta-
mine with an opioid such as alfentanil has
been shown to enhance the distribution and
clearance of ketamine, and to increase the
distribution of ketamine into the brain.21
These properties of ketamine may contrib-
ute to its superior effect on EA prevention,
compared with midazolam.
The induction dose of midazolam
is 0.05­0.15 mg/kg and the dose of midazo-
lam used in this study (0.1 mg/kg) has
been established as the optimum for pre-
anaesthetic anxiolysis.26 Administration of
1 mg/kg ketamine prior to entering the
operating room was shown to decrease
separation anxiety, degree of postoperative
pain, and the incidence of EA following
paediatric ophthalmic surgery under des-
flurane anaesthesia.20 In contrast, low-dose
ketamine (0.5 mg/kg) had no effect on
postoperative pain, additional analgesic
requirement, or postoperative nausea and
vomiting during painful ophthalmic sur-
gery.27 Based on these data, we chose to
use 0.1 mg/kg midazolam or 1 mg/kg keta-
mine in our present study.
The current study has some limitations.
First, there is broad variability in the defin-
itions and analysis tools related to EA. The
Pediatric Anesthesia Emergence Delirium
(PAED) scale is a reliable tool for the
assessment of EA in children,28 but relies
partly on the assessment of postoperative
eye contact. The ophthalmic nature of the
surgery in our study meant that we were
unable to evaluate eye contact, therefore we
used a simple AFPS score to measure EA.
Secondly, ethical concerns prevented the
inclusion of a placebo group. Thirdly, the
role of pain in EA remains debatable and it
is difficult to distinguish between signs of EA
and postoperative pain.1 There was no
significant between-group difference in post-
operative pain score in our study, however.
Our experience suggested that visual dis-
turbance and postoperative pain compli-
cated our assessment of EA.
In conclusion, premedication with
0.1 mg/kg midazolam or 1 mg/kg ketamine
lowers preoperative anxiety. Premedication
with ketamine was more effective than
midazolam in the prevention of early post-
operative EA, and reduced the requirement
for rescue medication in children after
sevoflurane anaesthesia.
