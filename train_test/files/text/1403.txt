BACKGROUND: We evaluate the performance of ovulation detection methods and present new approaches, includ-
ing evaluation of methods for precision, combining multiple markers into a hierarchical system and using ovulation
markers in intermittent sampling designs. METHODS: With serum LH peak day as the `gold standard' of ovulation,
we estimated accuracy and precision of ovulation day algorithms using 30 ovulatory menstrual cycles with daily uri-
nary and serum hormones and transvaginal ultrasound. Sensitivity and specificity for estimating the presence of ovu-
lation were tested using visually assessed ovulatory (30) and anovulatory (22) cycles. RESULTS: Sensitivity and
specificity ranged from 70 to 100% for estimating presence of ovulation with twice-per-cycle, weekly, twice weekly,
every-other-day and daily specimens. A combined hierarchical method estimated ovulation day using daily speci-
mens within ±2 days of the gold standard in 93% of cases. Accuracy of estimating ovulation day within ±2 days using
intermittent sampling ranged from 40% (weekly sampling) to 97% (every-other-day). CONCLUSIONS: A combined
hierarchical algorithm using precise and accurate markers allows maximal use of available data for efficient and
objective identification of ovulation using daily specimens. In intermittent sampling designs, the presence and the
timing of ovulation can be estimated with good sensitivity, specificity and accuracy.

Introduction
A variety of urinary hormone-based methods are available to
detect the presence or absence and timing of ovulation, and
they are increasingly used in large-scale and long-term studies
of reproduction (e.g. Joseph-Horne et al., 2002; Liu et al.,
2004a; Miro et al., 2004; Santoro et al., 2004; Wilcox et al.,
2004; Burger et al., 2005). These methods thus merit both
ongoing development and critical evaluation. In this paper, we
evaluate the performance of existing methods and present new
approaches, including evaluation of ovulation marker methods
for precision, combining multiple ovulation markers into a
hierarchical system and the use of ovulation markers in inter-
mittent sampling designs.
Published methods for estimating the day of ovulation are
usually evaluated for accuracy (Baird et al., 1991; Ecochard
et al., 2001; Li et al., 2002; Santoro et al., 2003), but only one
paper has systematically examined precision (Royston, 1983).
Accuracy is a measure of how close a marker is to the day of
ovulation. A marker may occur, on average, close to ovulation,
and therefore be accurate, but we also need to know how pre-
cise it is; that is, whether there is high variation among women
or cycles in the relationship of the marker with the day of ovu-
lation. Ideally, we would like markers that are both accurate
and precise. In the absence of a marker that is both accurate
and precise, we should favour precise markers over accurate
ones, because bias resulting from inaccuracy can be corrected,
whereas bias from imprecision cannot. To facilitate choosing
precise markers for estimating day of ovulation, we evaluated a
range of urinary and serum hormone markers of ovulation for
precision.
Technology in recent decades has facilitated the assay of
specimens for multiple hormones. Research examining multi-
ple hormones from daily specimens not only gives us the
opportunity for a more comprehensive picture of reproductive
Ovulation detection using urinary hormones

function but also provides us with multiple markers of ovula-
tion. However, few researchers have taken advantage of this in
a systematic fashion. Dunson and colleagues used two urinary-
based methods [Baird's day of luteal transition (Baird et al.,
1991) and the day of the luteinizing hormone peak] to estimate
day of ovulation, and they point out that this approach
improves accuracy and enables one to maintain sample size
even when one of the markers, such as the easily missed LH
peak, is not available in individual cases (Dunson et al., 2001).
We extend this approach to develop a hierarchical combination
algorithm that takes advantage of the best indicators preferen-
tially when applied to individual cases and only uses less-
precise measures when better markers are unavailable.
Research sampling designs should be geared towards seek-
ing a balance between minimizing subject collection burden
and project costs and providing sufficient data for reliable esti-
mation of ovulation status and timing. Although several meth-
ods for estimating the presence or absence of ovulation have
been evaluated for sensitivity and specificity using daily hor-
mone data (Kassam et al., 1996; McConnell et al., 2002; Santoro
et al., 2003), they have not been evaluated for use with inter-
mittent sampling designs. Similarly, methods for estimating
the day of ovulation have been examined for accuracy using
daily data (Royston, 1983; Baird et al., 1991; Kassam et al.,
1996; Ecochard et al., 2001; Li et al., 2002) but not intermit-
tent data. To the best of our knowledge, there are no published,
validated algorithms for estimating the presence or absence, or
day, of ovulation using intermittent sampling designs. We
therefore examined the performance of a range of urinary hor-
mone-based methods for use with intermittent data collection
strategies, including twice per cycle, once per week, twice per
week and every other day.
Our goals were thus to (i) identify ovulation markers with
the highest sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and precision; (ii)
combine the best methods into a hierarchical algorithm to max-
imize use of available data in studies using multiple hormone
indicators and (iii) evaluate the performance of ovulation
detection markers for intermittent sampling designs. In addi-
tion to providing methods for efficient and objective evaluation
of ovulation, this information will facilitate the use of the best
available methods for different research objectives and can
also enable researchers to account for error when estimating
ovulatory status (e.g. Dunson et al., 2001; Liu et al., 2004b).
We used two convenience samples to achieve our goals. The
first data set includes daily urinary pregnanediol glucuronide
(PDG), estrone glucuronide (E1G), LH and FSH data for 58
visually assessed ovulatory and anovulatory menstrual cycles.
The second includes daily serum and urine measurements of
four reproductive hormones across the menstrual cycle and
daily mid-cycle transvaginal ultrasound (TVU) measures from
30 ovulatory cycles.
Materials and methods
Participants and specimens
Hormone results and menstrual diary data from two studies were used
to develop and test urinary markers of ovulation. The first convenience
sample was used to evaluate methods for presence or absence of
ovulation and came from the Biodemographic Models of Reproductive
Ageing (BIMORA) project, a 5-year, prospective study of the hormo-
nal and menstrual cycle characteristics of reproductive ageing (Ferrell
et al., 2005). Participants provided written informed consent and
received compensation. The institutional review boards of Georget-
own University, the University of Utah, the Pennsylvania State Uni-
versity and the University of Washington approved all procedures.
From 15 January to 14 July in each of the five study years, 156
women collected daily first morning urine specimens and provided
information on menstrual bleeding, prescription and over-the-counter
supplement and drug use and health conditions and medical proce-
dures. We excluded data collected during and 3 months following any
event that was known to affect menstruation or hormone levels
(Ferrell et al., 2005). A small subset of BIMORA data, 1740 speci-
mens from 58 menstrual cycles, is used in the present study. For this
subset, we used only complete menstrual cycles that fell within one of
the five 6-month urine specimen collection windows.
In the second convenience sample, 799 daily urine and serum spec-
imens were collected across one menstrual cycle from 30 US women
(13 aged 20­25 years and 17 aged 40­45) for a study on reproductive
ageing (Klein et al., 2004). Monetary compensation was provided,
participants provided written informed consent and all procedures
were approved by the Institutional Review Board of the University of
Washington. Participants were normally cycling, in good health and
not using medications or hormones. Daily morning blood specimens
were obtained by venipuncture, beginning with the first day of men-
strual bleeding and continuing until the first day of menstrual bleeding
of the subsequent cycle. Daily TVU monitoring began in the mid-fol-
licular phase and continued until follicle collapse was observed.
Serum specimens were at the end of the study collection period
assayed, all cycles were confirmed ovulatory by TVU and day of folli-
cle collapse was determined in 27 of the 30 cycles. Urine specimens
were taken daily in the clinic, usually at the same time as blood collec-
tion and thawed 2 years later for assay.
Assays
All serum specimens were assayed for estradiol (E2
), LH and FSH,
but serum progesterone was measured only in the luteal phase (the
timing of the luteal phase was determined using evidence of follicle
collapse by TVU). The radioimmunoassay for E2
(ICN Biomedicals,
Irvine, CA, USA) had inter- and intra-assay coefficients of varia-
tions (CVs) of 16 and 7%. The radioimmunoassay for progesterone
(Diagnostic Systems Laboratories, Webster, TX, USA) had inter-
and intra-assay CVs of 13 and 11%. Solid-phase two-site immun-
ofluorometric assays (IFMA) (Wallac, Turku, Finland) were used to
estimate the serum levels of intact LH and FSH. The LH IFMA
cross-reacts less than 1% with FSH, and the inter- and intra-assay
CVs were 2.8 and 4.7% respectively. The FSH IFMA cross-reacts
less than 1% with LH, and the inter- and intra-assay CVs were 2.3
and 4.6% respectively.
Competitive enzyme immunoassays (EIAs) were used to assay
urine specimens for PDG, E1G and estrone conjugates (E1C). The
PDG, E1C and E1G EIAs are described in detail elsewhere (O'Connor
et al., 2003; O'Connor et al., 2004). The inter- and intra-assay coeffi-
cients of variation were 10.3 and 9.2% respectively for the PDG EIA
(O'Connor et al., 2003), 3.2 and 3.6% for the E1G EIA (O'Connor
et al., 2004) and 10.9 and 7.3% for the E1C EIA (O'Connor et al.,
2003). Urinary and serum concentrations were highly correlated:
r = 0.98 for PDG-progesterone (O'Connor et al., 2003), r = 0.94
for E1G-E2
(O'Connor et al., 2004) and r = 0.93 for E1C-E2
(O'Con-
nor et al., 2003).
Sandwich immunoenzymometric assays were used to measure -LH
and -FSH in urine (Brindle et al., unpublished data). The inter- and
K.A.O'Connor et al.
1444
intra-assay CVs for the LH assay were 6.8 and 3.7% respectively. The
inter- and intra-assay CVs for the FSH assay were 3.7 and 4.1%
respectively. Urinary LH and FSH values were highly correlated with
serum hormone results: Pearson correlations between urine and serum
values for 30 averaged cycles were 0.86 for FSH and 0.95 for LH
(Brindle et al., unpublished data).
All specimens, calibrators and controls were run in duplicate, and
hormone concentrations were estimated from optical density using a
four-parameter logistic model in BIOLINX 2.0 Software (Dynatech
Laboratories, Inc., Chantilly, VA, USA). All urinary hormone values
were adjusted by specimen specific gravity, using the following equa-
tion and a population mean (target) specific gravity of 1.020: corrected

Estimating presence or absence of ovulation
The ability of algorithms to detect the presence or absence of ovula-
tion was evaluated using (i) sensitivity [the ability to detect a true pos-
itive (ovulation), defined as the number of cycles classified as
ovulatory/true number of ovulatory cycles]; (ii) specificity [the ability
to detect a true negative (anovulation), defined as the number of
cycles classified anovulatory/true number of anovulatory cycles] and
(iii) the percent of cycles correctly classified by a method (defined as
the number of cycles correctly classified/total number of cycles). The
Kassam (Kassam et al., 1996) PDG moving averages interval method,
the Baird (Baird et al., 1991) day of luteal transition (DLT) method
and mid-cycle LH and FSH peaks (Aedo et al., 1976; Kesner et al.,
1998; Santoro et al., 2003) were tested.
The Kassam (Kassam et al., 1996) method uses a ratio of daily
PDG to the minimum 5-day moving average PDG to identify a sus-
tained PDG rise, defined as 3 consecutive days of a ratio of target day
PDG to the 5-day running average  three times the baseline in com-
plete cycles (cycle method) or across time intervals (interval method)
when cycle day is uncertain. The Baird et al. (Baird et al., 1991) algo-
rithm identifies the timing of ovulation using rules for finding an
abrupt change in the ratio of estrogen to progesterone (E/P). To
identify urinary LH and FSH peak days, we modified existing
methods which identify significant LH peaks (Aedo et al., 1976;
Kesner et al., 1998; Santoro et al., 2003). Rather than choosing the
day with the highest concentration as evidence of ovulation, we
considered the timing of the LH and FSH peaks to distinguish
those occurring around the time of menses (e.g. Miro and Aspinall,
2005) from those at mid-cycle. Additionally, we specified that an
LH or FSH peak be followed by a rise in PDG for a cycle to be
deemed ovulatory. Peak days were identified as those with the
highest LH or FSH value the average LH or FSH value for the
entire menstrual segment plus two SDs of all values for the men-
strual segment. Only peaks occurring 4 days before, on the day
of, or 1 day after the first day of a sustained PDG rise (as defined
by the Kassam algorithm) were considered.
The above four methods (Kassam, Baird, LH and FSH) were
applied to 58 menstrual cycles from the BIMORA project, for
which we had daily urines and menstrual diaries. The cycles were
selected from a database of hormone profiles of roughly 2000 com-
plete menstrual segments from 156 women and independently eval-
uated for ovulation status by two researchers with extensive
experience interpreting urinary reproductive hormone profiles.
Only uncensored cycles with relatively complete data (no more than
about 3 days in a row missing) were considered. Starting with the
cycles in chronological order by subject, the first researcher chose one
cycle (the first cycle) per subject from every other subject until 30
apparently ovulatory and 30 abnormal (anovulatory or indeterminate)
cycles were selected. The same researcher then re-evaluated the
30 abnormal cycles and categorized them as anovulatory or indeter-
minate. All 60 hormone profiles were printed, shuffled and then
assessed by the second researcher, who was blinded to both the ini-
tial classification of the cycles and the expected number of cycles of
each category. Visual inspection of the patterns of E1G, PDG, LH
and FSH was used to assess ovulatory status: specifically, we looked
for the presence of a follicular phase rise, mid-cycle peak and then
late cycle decline in E1G, midcycle peaks in LH and/or FSH and a
significant and sustained rise in PDG towards the end of the cycle.
Both experts were in agreement on the classifications: 30 were ovu-
latory, 22 were anovulatory and six were indeterminate. Neither
researcher was aware of the age or reproductive history of the
women contributing the segments. Algorithm performance was eval-
uated by estimating sensitivity and specificity of the four methods
using the visual classification of presence or absence of ovulation as
the `gold standard.' The six indeterminate cycles were excluded in
the specificity and sensitivity analyses.
Estimating day of ovulation
The ability of ovulation algorithms to estimate the day of ovulation
was examined for a range of markers using the data set of 30 ovarian
cycles, 27 of which were confirmed ovulatory by TVU and three of
which were deemed ovulatory by the presence of the serum LH peak
and subsequent sustained serum progesterone elevation. Performance
of each marker was evaluated by precision (consistency across women
or cycles in timing relative to ovulation) and accuracy (proximity to
ovulation day). For each of the methods discussed below, accuracy
was assessed by how close the mean difference between a marker and
the gold standard (marker minus gold difference or `MMGD') was to
zero. Precision of each marker was assessed as (i) the SD of the
MMGD and (ii) the percentage of estimates on and within ±1 and ±2
days of the mode of the MMGD. Markers designated as precise have
the smallest MMGD SD and the highest percentage of estimates fall-
ing on or within ±1 or ±2 days of the MMGD mode. Cases for which a
marker was not available were not included in estimates of either
accuracy or precision.
We selected the day of the serum LH peak as our gold standard; the
day of the serum LH peak is considered the day of ovulation and
occurs, on average, 1 day earlier than follicle collapse observed by
ultrasound (Pauerstein et al., 1978; Queenan et al., 1980; WHO,
1980). The serum LH peak was defined as the highest mid-cycle
serum LH value in a cycle.
Several widely used methods for identifying ovulation day were
evaluated: two versions of Baird's DLT method, one using E1G and
one using E1C (Baird et al., 1991); the Waller (Waller et al., 1998)
method; the mid-cycle peak day of urinary LH (Kesner et al., 1998)
and the mid-cycle peak day of urinary FSH (Li et al., 2002). Baird and
colleagues' (Baird et al., 1991) DLT algorithm identifies the day of
ovulation as the 2nd day in a 5-day sequence where there is a 60% or
greater decline in the ratio of E/P between the first and the last 2 days
of the sequence. The Waller et al. (Waller et al., 1998) method is a
modification of the Baird DLT method, with more specific criteria for
identifying ovulation day based on the peak and subsequent change in
the E/P ratio and a modification of the PDG ratio to accommodate
very high and low levels of PDG. We modified existing methods for
identifying ovulatory LH and FSH peaks to consider the magnitude
and timing of the peak to distinguish mid-cycle peaks from those
occurring around menses (Miro and Aspinall, 2005). The peak day
had the highest LH or FSH value the average LH or FSH value for
the entire menstrual cycle plus two SDs of all values for the cycle.
Only peaks occurring within 4 days before, on the day of, or 1 day
after the first day the Kassam PDG ratio was 3 for at least 3 consec-
utive days were considered.
Ovulation detection using urinary hormones
1445
We also evaluated methods less commonly used ­ the peak day of
urinary E1G and the peak day of urinary E1C (Royston, 1983; Baird
et al., 1991; Li et al., 2002) ­ or not previously examined ­ Kassam's
(Kassam et al., 1996) urinary PDG-based interval and cycles method
­ for their ability to identify ovulation day. The Kassam method for
identifying a sustained rise in PDG was modified to estimate the day
of ovulation: we used the first day of the sustained rise in PDG as the
day of ovulation. The urinary E1G and E1C peaks were defined as the
highest values in a menstrual segment.
We also examined the relationships of serum FSH, LH and E2
peaks with the gold standard. The same peak identification methods
used for urinary peaks of these hormones were used with the serum
data.
Combination hierarchical algorithm
The best-performing urinary hormone markers were combined to
create a hierarchical method for determining presence or absence
and day of ovulation. The combined method was constructed using
four criteria: (i) the presence or absence of ovulation was estimated
using the method with the highest sensitivity and specificity; (ii) if
ovulation occurred, the marker with the highest precision and accu-
racy was used to estimate day of ovulation; (iii) the hierarchy
favoured the most precise and accurate method for determining ovu-
lation day but would compensate for its absence on a case-by-case
basis by using the second most accurate or precise method in the
hierarchy; if an individual case did not have data for the second-
choice method, then the third most accurate or precise method in the
hierarchy was used, and so on; (iv) the individual methods in the
hierarchy had to be amenable to automation. We considered preci-
sion more important than accuracy, so markers consistently the same
number of days from the gold standard were ranked higher than
those occurring nearer the gold standard but which had high varia-
bility from cycle to cycle.
Estimating presence or absence of ovulation with intermittent
specimen sampling designs
Intermittent sampling designs using every-other-day, twice-weekly,
weekly and twice-per-menstrual cycle collection protocols were simu-
lated in our data sets. Every-other-day collection was simulated by
randomly selecting either the first or second day of data available for
each cycle and then every second day through the rest of the cycle.
For twice-weekly sampling, two situations were simulated. In the
first, the first day of specimen collection was the first day of menstrual
bleeding, and the next day of collection was 3 days later, followed by
a collection 4 days later, followed by a collection 3 days later, and so
on. In the second simulated situation, specimens were collected every
Monday and Thursday, beginning on the first Monday in a menstrual
cycle. To simulate weekly collection, similar scenarios were used:
beginning collection on the first day of menses or on a Monday. To
simulate twice-per-menstrual cycle sampling, we used the 7th and
21st day of each cycle, assuming an average 28-day cycle length,
given that specimen collection days would need to be decided in
advance without knowing completed cycle length.
These sampling designs were simulated using both data sets com-
bined, for a total of 82 (60 ovulatory and 22 anovulatory) menstrual
cycles. Ovulation algorithms were applied to determine the presence
or absence of ovulation in each menstrual cycle, and performance was
assessed by estimating sensitivity and specificity against the `gold
standard' determination made using the most sensitive and specific
algorithm with daily data.
The ovulation algorithms were designed for use with daily data and
had to be modified for intermittent sampling. We evaluated only the
Kassam and Baird methods; these are both based on a rise in PDG,
which is the only indicator that spans enough days to accommodate
intermittent sampling designs. Our modifications were designed to
balance reduced observations with stringent criteria indicative of ovu-
lation or its absence. The modifications are summarized in Table I,
along with the reasoning for each modification.
Estimating day of ovulation with intermittent specimen
sampling designs
To estimate the day of ovulation with data collected weekly,
twice-weekly and every-other-day, variations of the basic princi-
ples of the Kassam algorithm were evaluated for precision and
accuracy. For example, for weekly data, we examined the first
day the Kassam ratio exceeded 3 as well as up to 4 days before and
up to 5 days after in order to identify which algorithm had the
highest precision and accuracy. The denominator of the ratio also
varied by sampling design: it was simply the minimum PDG value
in a menstrual segment for weekly and twice-weekly sampling but
was calculated using a running three-sample average for every-
other-day data.
We also tested a modified version of the Baird et al. algorithm for
estimating day of ovulation with every-other-day sampling. In this
method, we extrapolate hormone values of E1C (or E1G) and PDG
for each missing day by using the mean of the measures on either
side of the missing day. The Baird algorithm was then applied to the
data.
Accuracy of the Kassam and Baird modified methods for estimat-
ing day of ovulation with intermittent sampling was evaluated using
the mean MMGD and the percentage of cases in which the day of ovu-
lation was estimated within ±2 and ±4 days of the serum LH peak.
Precision was evaluated using the MMGD SD. The 30 ovulatory
cycles with serum LH and TVU were used for these tests.
Results
The mean and SD of cycle lengths and participant age and BMI
for each data set are shown in Table II. The anovulatory and
indeterminate cycles had wider variation in cycle length than
the ovulatory cycles. Age was higher among women with ano-
vulatory and indeterminate cycles, whereas BMI was higher
for ovulatory and indeterminate cycles.
Estimating presence or absence of ovulation with daily data
Sensitivity, specificity and misclassification rate for each of the
algorithms tested for determining the presence or absence of
ovulation using daily specimens are shown in Table III. Of
four algorithms applied to the 52 classifiable menstrual seg-
ments from the BIMORA study, the Kassam algorithm using
the intervals method (Kassam et al., 1996) performed best
overall in terms of sensitivity (100%), specificity (100%) and
misclassification (0%) (Table III). Of the six cycles visually
classified as indeterminate (which are not included in the
results in Table III), five were classified anovulatory and one
ovulatory by the Kassam algorithm. Examples of the steroid
and gonadotrophin hormone profiles of ovulatory, anovulatory
and indeterminate cycles are shown in Figure 1. Visually inde-
terminate cycles lack a clear and sustained rise in PDG and
tended to be classified as anovulatory by each of the algo-
rithms. The visually indeterminate cycle in Figure 1C was
assigned anovulatory status by the Kassam method.

Estimating day of ovulation with daily data
Table IV presents measures of precision for each of the different
markers: the SD of the mean MMGD, the MMGD mode and the
percent of cases where a marker falls on or within 1 and 2 days of
the MMGD mode. Only cycles where the indicator being tested
was present were included in the denominator for calculating per-
centage of cases falling on or within 1 and 2 days of the mode;
absence of the indicator would otherwise have been treated as a
method failure, unduly lowering the precision estimate. Accuracy
is also presented in Table IV, as the mean MMGD, representing
the proximity of a marker to the gold standard.
Table IV shows that the means of the E1C and E1G peaks
are close in time to the day of serum LH peak (MMGD = 0.87

aBMI was only collected every other year in the BIMORA study, so BMI data for a participant may be within 1­2 years of the year of the cycle used in this
convenience sample. For example, for a 1998 cycle, we used 1997 BMI data. If we had data from years on either side of the target cycle, we took an average
of the two BMIs and assigned that to the target year (for example, 1998 values were averages of 1997 and 1999 BMI values). BMI was not available for all
BIMORA participants to within 1­2 years of the cycle; hence, the sample size of BMI varies across groups.

using the Kassam method is not particularly accurate ­ the first
day of the PDG rise occurs on average 3 days following the serum
LH peak (MMGD = 3.48 days for the Kassam cycle method and
MMGD = 3.17 days for the Kassam interval method) ­ but it has
reasonable precision (MMGD SD = 1.92 for Kassam cycle
method; MMGD SD = 1.60 for Kassam interval method). The
timing of the rise was considered consistent enough from woman
to woman to allow us to take the 3-day lag into account in subse-
quent analyses using the Kassam method to estimate day of ovula-
tion. Urinary LH, FSH, Baird DLT and the Waller methods were
all reasonably accurate (mean MMGDs close to zero) and precise
(low SDs). Serum E2
is actually fairly precise (77% of cases fell
on the mode); the MMGD SD (1.82 days) for E2
primarily reflects
one case with an 8-day deviation from the serum LH peak.
The mean of the mean deviations between day of serum LH
peak and all other markers in Table IV was 0.71 days (SD =
0.99). The mean of the mean deviations between day of follicle
collapse and all other markers in Table IV was 0.29 days (SD =
0.97). Follicle collapse is closer in time to the marker events,
but not significantly so, indicating that either serum LH peak
or follicle collapse can be used to represent day of ovulation.
The results presented in Tables III and IV guided the con-
struction of a combined hierarchical method. In this method,
the first step was to evaluate whether or not a cycle was ovula-
tory. Table III supported the use of the Kassam (Kassam et al.,
1996) intervals method algorithm (100% sensitivity and speci-
ficity). If the Kassam algorithm identified a cycle as ovulatory,
the next step was to identify the day of ovulation. The urinary
LH peak, FSH peak and Baird DLT methods all had similar
precision and accuracy. Using precision as a guide, we placed
the LH peak first (MMGD SD = 1.14) and the FSH peak
second (MMGD SD=1.30) in the hierarchical algorithm. LH
and FSH peaks were put ahead of the Baird DLT (MMGD SD
= 0.85 for E1G and MMGD SD = 1.14 for E1C) because of the
sometimes unusual ovulation days that can be assigned by the
Baird DLT algorithm in the hormonally irregular cycles that
can occur as a result of reproductive ageing (data not shown).
The Baird algorithm worked equally well with both the E1C
and E1G measures, and either of these can be used in the com-
bined hierarchical method. The Kassam intervals method, with
correction for the 3-day lag, had lower precision (MMGD SD
= 1.60) than LH, FSH and the Baird DLT, and thus it was
placed last in the hierarchy. Ovulation day using the Kassam
method is identified as 3 days before the first day of 3 consec-
utive days that the ratio exceeded the threshold value of 3.
The combined hierarchical method had, overall, high accu-
racy (mean MMGD = 0.60) and precision (MMGD SD = 1.13;
93% of estimates fell within 2 days of the MMGD mode) for
predicting ovulation day (Table IV). We did not include the
Waller method in the hierarchical method as it is a more com-
plicated version of the Baird DLT method and had lower accu-
racy and precision than the Baird method.

The modified Baird and Kassam algorithms performed simi-
larly with respect to sensitivity for every-other-day (range =
98­100%), twice-weekly (range = 92­100%) and weekly
(range = 78­93%) sampling, regardless of when collection
began. Misclassification rates were below 10% for methods
that had both sensitivities and specificities greater than 90%.
Most of the algorithms were too sensitive to small PDG
changes and therefore had low specificity with every-other-day
sampling (5­77%). However, requiring an elevation in PDG of
three times the baseline for two consecutive samples improved
specificity to 100% for every-other-day samples (using the
Kassam 6 modification, see Tables I and V). Specificity also
improved for weekly and twice-weekly sampling with different
modifications to the Kassam algorithm, such as raising the
threshold ratio from 3 to 4 (using the Kassam 4 and 5 modifica-
tions, see Tables I and V). Twice per cycle collection had rela-
tively low sensitivity and specificity (68­82%) for estimating
the presence or absence of ovulation. The Kassam method var-
iations generally had higher sensitivity and specificity and
lower misclassification rates than the Baird method variations.
Methods for determining presence or absence of ovulation had
to be tailored to accommodate the collection scheme: no single
method was identified that could be used to give the best
results for all sampling scenarios.
Accuracy and precision for identifying ovulation day with
intermittent data is shown in Table VI; only the best performing
(highest accuracy and precision) algorithms are listed. Precision
(MMGD SD) ranged from 1.3 to 2.8 days for weekly, twice-
weekly and every-other-day sampling designs (Table VI).
Accuracy of estimates of the day of ovulation increased with
increased sampling frequency: the MMGD declined from 2.1
to ­0.2 as sampling frequency increased (Table VI). Twice-
weekly and every-other-day methods based on modified Kassam
methods estimated ovulation day within ±4 days in up to 90%
of cases, but only 63­77% were estimated within ±2 days. In
contrast, the Baird et al. modified algorithm for every-other-
day sampling had high accuracy and precision and estimated
day of ovulation to within ±4 days in up to 100% of cases
(using E1C in the ratio) and to within ±2 days in up to 97% of
cases (using E1C in the ratio). Weekly sampling with Kassam-
based methods estimated ovulation day within ±2 days in only
40­70% of cases (Table VI). For both twice-weekly and
weekly sampling, beginning specimen collection on the first
Monday of a menstrual cycle resulted in higher accuracy and
precision than beginning collection on the first day of a men-
strual cycle (the first day of menses).
Discussion
The results of this work provide researchers with information
for choosing urinary markers of ovulation that (i) are precise;
(ii) are well-characterized statistically; (iii) make maximum use
of available ovulation marker data, even in cases where differ-
ent types of data are missing; (iv) can be applied objectively
and (v) allow for choice of a research design that balances
subject collection burden, project goals and cost with appropri-
ate data for estimation of the presence or absence and day of
ovulation.
The PDG-based Kassam method, and modifications of it,
had high sensitivity and specificity for estimating the presence
or absence of ovulation in daily and intermittent sampling
scenarios. The Kassam method had 100% specificity and sen-
sitivity for determining whether ovulation occurred in a cycle
with daily sampling. This method easily accommodated varia-
bility between subjects in magnitude of the PDG rise and
could also be applied with minimal modification to a range
of sampling schemes. With intermittent sampling schemes,
including every-other-day, twice-weekly and weekly, the Kassam
method modifications had sensitivities and specificities greater
than 90% and misclassification rates of 10% or less. Even
twice-per-cycle sampling had sensitivity and specificity from
68 to 82% with the Kassam method. Whereas the Kassam
method proved to be an effective basis, modifications specific
to each collection scenario had to be made to optimize perform-
ance. This was a result of the need to balance data richness with
the strictness of the rules in order to achieve high sensitivity and
specificity. For less-frequent sampling, more permissive rules
were needed to optimize sensitivity. These rules were too relaxed,
however, and compromised specificity in designs with higher
sampling frequency. The Baird DLT method had high sensitivity
but low specificity for estimating presence or absence of ovulation
with most sampling designs, except for weekly sampling, with

sensitivity of 93% and specificity of 82% (Table V). The low
specificity for other sampling scenarios was probably a result
of the method's vulnerability to missing data, and the fact that
the Baird DLT method was not originally designed to assess
the presence or absence of ovulation, it was designed only for
estimating day of ovulation (Baird et al., 1991).
Other methods for estimating the presence or absence of
ovulation tend not to be as sensitive or specific as the Kassam
method with daily sampling (Santoro et al., 2003). In our data,
LH and FSH peak days were specific, but not sensitive,
whereas Baird's DLT method was sensitive but not very spe-
cific. The Kassam method was chosen for estimating the pres-
ence or absence of ovulation in the combined hierarchical
method because of the method's high sensitivity and specific-
ity as well as robustness to missing data.
Although the Kassam method performed quite well with our
daily data for estimating presence or absence of ovulation,
slightly lower sensitivity and specificity were reported in its
original description (Kassam et al., 1996) and elsewhere
(McConnell et al., 2002; Santoro et al., 2003). This might be
attributable, in part, to our gold standard choice. Whereas
Kassam and colleagues used <2 ng/ml serum progesterone as a
gold standard of anovulation, taken once per week, and
McConnell and colleagues used the urine LH peak as a gold
standard of the presence of ovulation, we tested our algorithms
for the presence or absence of ovulation against a gold standard
of visually assessing cycles using measures of four hormones
from daily urine specimens. Although our visual assessment
included E1G, PDG, LH and FSH, the most telling visual indi-
cator of ovulation was a sustained mid-to-late-cycle rise in
PDG. Thus, given that the test and gold standards were based
on similar (but not identical) criteria, our estimates of sensitiv-
ity and specificity may be overly optimistic. However, our
objective was to effectively capture and standardize the PDG
rise that is evident visually, even with intermittent sampling,
using the Kassam algorithm.
We evaluated the performance of algorithms for the pres-
ence or absence of ovulation in a data set that included 25
cycles from perimenopausal women (out of a total of 58 cycles
from the BIMORA project). Perimenopausal women may have
hormonally disordered cycles with or without ovulation,
including elevated early follicular phase FSH, lack of LH or
FSH peaks and hyper- or hypo-estrogenism (Prior, 1998).
Many of the cycles in our sample showed one or more of these
characteristics (for an example, see Figure 1B). Despite this,
the Kassam PDG-based algorithm had nearly perfect sensitiv-
ity and specificity for discriminating ovulatory and non-ovula-
tory cycles. Our results are in agreement with Santoro and
colleagues (Santoro et al., 2003) in finding the Kassam method
useful for evaluating not only normal cycles but also the hor-
monally irregular cycles encountered in reproductive ageing.
In previous work, we found that the Kassam algorithm also
performed well in the disrupted cycles sometimes found in
exercising women (McConnell et al., 2002). We note, how-
ever, that the algorithms examined here were designed for use
in women still experiencing menstrual cycles. It is possible that
they may not perform similarly in women who are not cycling
at all, such as late peri- or post-menopausal women, in whom
low-level fluctuations in steroid hormone levels may cause the
algorithms to falsely indicate that ovulation has occurred. The
chances of identifying a PDG rise three times the baseline that
is associated only with random, low-level fluctuations will
increase as interval length increases, as is expected in late peri-
or post-menopausal women. In these cases, it may be necessary
to identify a minimum PDG level below which peaks identified
by the Kassam method are clearly not biologically meaningful.
All the indicators we examined for estimating of day of ovu-
lation were accurate within 1 day of ovulation, except for the
Kassam algorithm which gave an ovulation day 3 days
removed, on average, from the gold standard. We were able to
correct for this bias by designating the day of ovulation as 3 days
prior to the first of 3 consecutive days when the ratio was 3.
Precision varied across urinary indicators, ranging from 0.85 to
5.99 days. The E1G and E1C peaks, despite being accurate to
within 1 day of ovulation, were the least precise indicators and
were thus not considered for use in the combined hierarchical
method. The remaining urinary indicators had acceptable pre-
cision, ranging from 0.85 to 1.92 days.
In the construction of the combined hierarchical method for
estimating day of ovulation, we valued precision over accu-
racy. If a cycle was found ovulatory by the Kassam method,
the mid-cycle urine LH peak, if available, was used preferen-
tially to estimate ovulation day. If the urinary LH peak was not
available, then the mid-cycle urine FSH peak was used as the
day of ovulation. If no LH or FSH peaks were available, then
ovulation day was estimated using the Baird DLT method. If
the Baird algorithm identified the cycle as anovulatory, or the
ovulation day indeterminate, the last step of the hierarchy was
to define the day of ovulation as 3 days before the first of 3
consecutive days on which the Kassam PDG:PDG baseline
ratio was 3. Urinary LH and FSH peaks and the Baird DLT
algorithm, though reasonably accurate and precise, are all vul-
nerable to small amounts of missing data (Baird et al., 1991),
in contrast to the Kassam method. Thus, the Kassam method is
an important component of the combined hierarchical method.
The combined hierarchical method had excellent accuracy ­
the MMGD mean was less than 1 day (0.60 days) ­ and excel-
lent precision ­ 93% of estimates of ovulation day in a sample
of 30 cycles fell on or within 2 days of the MMGD mode, and
the MMGD SD was 1.13 days. As an example of how the
method accommodates missing data, when we applied the
algorithm to 61 cycles classified as ovulatory (30 confirmed
ovulatory by TVU, 30 visually assessed ovulatory and one vis-
ually assessed indeterminate) ovulation day was determined by
the urine LH peak in 42 cycles, by the FSH peak in four cycles,
by Baird DLT in 13 cycles and by the Kassam method in two
cycles.
Variants of the Kassam and Baird methods were used to
estimate the day of ovulation with intermittent data. Other
methods were not evaluated given their vulnerability to miss-
ing data. Similarly, the hierarchical combined method was not
tested for intermittent data, because not all of the indicators in
that method were amenable to missing data. Estimation of
ovulation day with Kassam-based methods to within ±4 days
of ovulation had 90% accuracy for twice-weekly and every-
other-day sampling, but accuracy declined to around 70% for

estimation to within ±2 days of ovulation day. The Baird mod-
ified method performed very well with every-other-day sam-
pling, using either E1C or E1G in the ratio: ovulation day was
estimated to within ±4 days in 97% (E1G) to 100% (E1C)
cases and to within ±2 days in 93% (E1G) and 97% (E1C) of
cases.
Beginning specimen collection on the first Monday of a
menstrual cycle resulted in higher accuracy and precision than
beginning collection on the first day of a menstrual cycle (the
first day of menses) for estimating ovulation day with both
twice-weekly and weekly sampling. This is a result of the fact
that ovulation is not distributed randomly across the menstrual
cycle and tends to cluster between cycle days 8­15 (Wilcox
et al., 2000). The day of ovulation (day of serum LH peak) in
the 30 cycles for which we had TVU clustered around days 13­14
of the menstrual cycle: the mean ovulation day was cycle
day 14.3, the mode was cycle day 13, the median was cycle
day 14 and the range spanned cycle days 7­25. Because ovula-
tion day clustered so tightly around cycle days 13­14, and
these cycle days fell between collection days, beginning collec-
tion on the first day of menses missed ovulation day in a sub-
stantial proportion of our data set in the twice-weekly and
weekly sampling designs. In contrast, beginning collection on
the first Monday of a cycle increased the probability of collec-
tion days coinciding with cycle days 13 and 14. We conclude
that intermittent collection schemes for weekly and twice-
weekly collection should avoid beginning specimen collection
on the first day of menses.
A limitation of the work here is that the methods were evalu-
ated on relatively small data sets ­ 30 ovulatory cycles with
serum, urine and TVU data and 58 visually assessed anovulatory
and ovulatory BIMORA cycles. Our estimates of sensitivity,
specificity, precision and accuracy may not be representative of
how the markers might perform in other data sets. In particular,
our data might reflect a limited range of variance across women
for the estimates of precision. It is not possible to compare our
estimates of accuracy with other studies, as each study used dif-
ferent gold standards: we used the serum LH peak, Baird and
colleagues and Royston used the urinary LH peak (Royston,
1983; Baird et al., 1991), Li and colleagues, and Ecochard and
colleages used follicle collapse (Ecochard et al., 2001; Li et al.,
2002) and Santoro and colleagues used visual assessment of
evidence of luteal activity (Santoro et al., 2003) as gold stan-
dards for estimating accuracy. A second and related limitation is
that our estimates of precision, accuracy, sensitivity and speci-
ficity for methods that we modified or created are likely to be
biased by the fact that we are reporting statistical performance
for indicators using the data set which was used to develop or
modify the indicators. Thus, it is possible that the indicators dis-
cussed here may not perform as well in other data sets.
The methods outlined here were developed for objective and
automated identification of the presence and timing of ovula-
tion. The results suggest that a combined hierarchical method
has several advantages for daily samples: it has excellent sensi-
tivity and specificity for estimating presence of ovulation; it
has high accuracy and precision for estimating ovulation day
and it is robust to missing data, thereby maximizing use of a
data set. We found that the presence or absence of ovulation
can be estimated with PDG-based methods with good sensitiv-
ity and specificity in intermittent sampling designs. In particu-
lar, every-other-day, twice-weekly and weekly specimens
perform well. These results should be useful for reducing sub-
ject burden and project cost in studies in which the outcome
measure is presence or absence of ovulation. Most intermittent
sampling designs are less useful for estimating day of ovula-
tion; for the best accuracy and precision, every-other-day (with
the modified Baird method) or daily sampling is necessary.
