Research Questions and Background
Does trust between works councillors and managers affect
their preferences for plant-level negotiations1 compared with
industry-wide or multiemployer bargaining? This is the
question our article sets out to address. Our main hypothesis
is that the higher the degree of mutual trust between manage-
ment and works councils, the stronger the preference of both
parties for plant-level bargaining. The basic rationale for this
hypothesis is the assumption that trust furthers interaction
between the bargaining parties (Axelrod, 1984; Thompson,
Wang, & Gunia, 2010) and reduces uncertainty. This implies
a higher preference for plant-level bargaining and a lower
preference for supraplant-level bargaining, that is, multiem-
ployer bargaining. We will elaborate the hypothesis and the
rationale in detail below.
Relationships of trust and bargaining do not exist in a social
vacuum. They are rather embedded in both a legal and factual
regulatory framework and a discursive context. Currently, in
Germany, quantitative working conditions (e.g., the number of
working hours and above all pay) are still primarily negotiated
at the regional and industry levels, that is, between unions
(e.g., the metal workers union IG Metall) and employers asso-
ciations (in this example, Gesamtmetall for the metal industry;
Keller & Kirsch, 2011, p. 209 ff.). Although some companies
conclude their own enterprise or company-level agreements
with a trade union, Germany has, compared with other
industrialized countries, a medium (industry- or region-wide)
collective bargaining coverage rate (Keller & Kirsch, 2011).
In 2010, 56% of employees in western and 37% in eastern
Germany were covered by industry-wide agreements (63%
and 47%, respectively, in 2000; Ellguth & Kohaut, 2011).
Multiemployer bargaining is still significant, but develop-
ments since the 1990s indicate an erosion of the typical
German system of collective bargaining. First, the rate of
employees covered by industry- or region-wide collective
agreements is slowly and steadily decreasing. Accordingly, an
increasing proportion of employees (7% and 13%, respec-
tively, in 2010) work either in companies with an enterprise or
company-level agreement or in companies that are not bound
by any collective agreement (37% of all employees in western
and 47% in eastern Germany; Ellguth & Kohaut, 2011). There
are many reasons for this development, including the tendency
for newly founded firms not to organize in employers'associa-
tions and for existing firms to leave them. Second, we also
observe a "tacit escape from collective agreements" (stille
Tarifflucht; Keller & Kirsch, 2011, p. 211), meaning that firms

The Effects of Trust on the Preference for
Decentralized Bargaining:An Empirical
Study of Managers and Works Councillors
Werner Nienhueser1 and Heiko Hossfeld1
Abstract
This article looks into the question of whether trust between works councillors and managers affects their preferences for
plant-level negotiations compared with industry-wide or multiemployer bargaining.The main hypothesis is that when a high
degree of mutual trust exists, both parties are more likely to show a preference toward the plant level.When the level of
trust is low, the bargaining parties rely more on supraplant-level bargaining and collective bargaining power.This article uses
data from a survey of 1,000 German companies of at least 100 employees, including 1,000 personnel managers and 1,000
works councillors, that is, those persons responsible for negotiating working conditions at the plant level. Logistic regression
analyses show that trust has no significant effect on the managers' preference for decentralized bargaining, whereas it can be
found to affect the works councillors.The authors finally discuss the question of why the effect of trust is different for the
bargaining parties.

are still members of an employers association and bound by an
industry-wide collective agreement but do not comply with its
terms. Third, the character of collective agreements itself is
changing; an increasing proportion of industry-wide collective
agreements contain what are known as "opening clauses"
(Öffnungsklauseln), which allow deviations from the agreed
standards and give partial bargaining rights to works councils
and management at the company level. All these factors com-
bine to produce a development that can be characterized as the
"decentralization of bargaining," with a stronger emphasis on
company or plant-level bargaining (see Haipeter, 2011a,
2011b).
These material changes have been accompanied by a con-
troversial political discussion on the decentralization of
bargaining--whether a shift in bargaining from the supra-
plant and collective level to the plant or company level
should be supported, welcomed, or opposed, and to what
extent. Critics of the German multiemployer bargaining sys-
tem regard the industry-wide, supraplant-level bargaining of
wages, working hours, and so on by unions and employers
associations as inflexible (see Berthold & Stettes, 2001;
Schnabel, 2003, 2006; Zohlhöfer, 1996). According to this
position, multiemployer bargaining agreements should, at
most, encompass framework regulations because through
decentralized bargaining, better consideration would be
given to company-specific circumstances, which in turn
would increase efficiency. According to the Works
Constitution Act (1972), works councils and management
are allowed to conclude works or company agreements, but
it is illegal for works agreements to deal with remuneration
and other conditions of employment that have been or are
normally fixed by collective agreement (except a collective
agreement expressly authorizing the making of supplemen-
tary or divergent works agreements by way of the "opening
clauses"). Some critics, nevertheless, call for multiemployer
bargaining agreements to be completely replaced by works
agreements (see Bispinck, 2004). This raises the question of
the consequences for the bargaining parties at the company
level. Interestingly, we know not only very little of the con-
sequences but also of the preferences of the central actors
responsible for bargaining at the company level, in particular
works councillors and human resource managers. This is
surprising because a clear break from the multiemployer bar-
gaining system would mean that they would have to bear all
the consequences, negative as well as positive. Preferences
for or against different systems of bargaining are not least
influenced by the social relationship between the bargaining
parties, in particular the relationship of trust. One of our
main theoretical assumptions here is that the preference for
plant-level bargaining is influenced by the level of trust
between the bargaining parties. We will return to this in the
theory section below, but the argument in brief is as follows:
A high level of (mutual) trust furthers a positive preference
for bargaining between the parties in the relationship of trust;
this implies a preference for plant-level bargaining. Low
(mutual) trust, thus, has a positive effect on a preference for
industry- or sector-level bargaining. To test these assump-
tions, we draw on data from a questionnaire survey of 1,000
managers and 1,000 works councillors involved in joint bar-
gaining relationships regarding their position on decentral-
ized bargaining. We also measure the mutual trust of these
protagonists using a well-tested trust scale. Specifically, we
ask how high or low the level of trust is, that is, the extent of
trust placed in the respective bargaining party; how fre-
quently configurations of mutual mistrust, unilateral trust,
and mutual trust occur; and how the level of trust and trust
configurations affect the preference for decentralized bar-
gaining and a specific bargaining partner.
Our study draws on country-specific data, but it also aims
to answer a more general question by analyzing the relation-
ship between trust relationships and bargaining processes at
the plant level. Although the data refer to the German bar-
gaining system, the research question and the results should
be transferable to countries with different systems, particu-
larly those with works councils, but also with other bargain-
ing relationships, for example, plant-level bargaining
between unions and management or industry-level collective
bargaining between unions and employers associations.
The article begins by outlining the state of (theoretical
and empirical) research on trust relationships between man-
agement boards and works councillors and on the prefer-
ences of these actors in terms of decentralized bargaining
(see section titled Previous Research). We then go on to for-
mulate our hypotheses (section titled General Theoretical
Ideas and Hypothesis for Further Analysis). The data and the
operationalization of the variables are described in the sec-
tion titled Data and Operationalization, and the results of our
analysis in the Results section. The article concludes with a
discussion of the findings and conclusions for further
research (Discussion and Conclusions (For Research)).
Previous Research
Why does trust play such an important role in industrial
relationships (Fox, 1974) and particularly in relationships
between management boards and employee representatives?
And why do we suppose trust between management and
works councils to have a positive effect on their preference
for decentralized (plant-level) bargaining? Trust can be of
benefit to bargaining (Kerkhof, Winder, & Klandermans,
2003). A high degree of trust in the other party increases the
probability of integrative bargaining and reduces that of
distributive bargaining (Walton & McKersie, 1965); the
protagonists define their respective situation less as a zero-
sum game, and their willingness to compromise increases
(see Butler, 1995; Kramer, 1999; Ross & LaCroix, 1996). In
turn, mutual trust between management and works councils
should therefore also influence preferences as to whether
working and pay conditions are negotiated at the plant level
or, alternatively, at the supraplant level--thereby effectively
Nienhueser and Hossfeld 3
delegating bargaining and reducing the potential for conflict
at the plant level.
Findings relating to trust relationships (e.g., mutual trust,
unilateral trust, or mistrust) between management boards
and works councils are scarce. Kerkhof et al. (2003) used a
shortened form of the Organizational Trust Inventory
(Cummings & Bromiley, 1996) in the Netherlands (in two
surveys) to measure the degree of trust over 300 works coun-
cillors placed in their respective management boards. They
found a relatively high level of trust but also quite consider-
able differences from company to company. The question
remains open as to how management trusts works council-
lors and what impact this has on a preference for decentral-
ized bargaining.
Only a few surveys explicitly deal with managers' prefer-
ences for decentralized bargaining, but these studies do not
examine the reasons for the differences in these preferences.
Bahnmüller (2002) carried out a survey of managers and
works councillors in three sectors that also addressed the
evaluation of the multiemployer bargaining system. Only the
results of companies bound to collective agreements were
included in the report. In all, 23% of managers believe that
there is no need for change, 60% believe that changes are
necessary although the system has proven itself, and 14%
say that the system has not proven itself and bargaining
should only take place at the plant or company level. Around
3% are of the opinion that only individual agreements should
be concluded and that collective bargaining agreements
should be done away with altogether. The proportion of man-
agers who believe the multiemployer bargaining system to
have proven successful thus stands at 83%.
At first glance, and maybe not very surprisingly, members
of works councils massively reject decentralization of bar-
gaining. This is repeatedly shown in surveys of works coun-
cils (see Bispinck, 2005). Only 12% of those interviewed
believe that decentralized bargaining should be "welcomed,"
whereas almost a third (30%) are "undecided," and 53%
think it would prove to be "generally problematic." However,
a closer look reveals that the picture is not quite so clear:
49% think that the works council would have more freedom
of scope and 48% that circumstances at the respective com-
pany could be better taken into account through decentral-
ized bargaining. In the Bahnmüller (2002) survey, on one
hand, 56% of works councillors believe that the multiem-
ployer bargaining system has proven itself and requires no
change, and only 4% think the system has not proven itself
and bargaining should take place at the plant, company, or
individual level. On the other hand, a sizable 40% think it
has proven itself but is in need of change.
In summary, first, there are no reliable results relating to
the level and configuration of trust between management and
works councils. Second, no study exists that simultaneously
analyzes the preference for decentralized bargaining and
other characteristics of both bargaining parties within the
same company. Third, the influence of trust on the
preference for decentralized bargaining has not been investi-
gated. This study aims to close these research gaps.
GeneralTheoretical Ideas and
Hypothesis for Further Analysis
Our general theoretical idea is simple: The preference for
decentralized bargaining is dependent on trust and also on
the objective situation of the company and the perceived
consequences of decentralized bargaining.
Our main hypothesis is that management and works coun-
cil will take a more positive (or less negative) stance on
decentralized bargaining (i.e., plant-level bargaining) if it
deems the other party trustworthy. Mutual trust implies that
the behavior of the other party is more predictable and that
the perceived probability of integrative and less distributive
bargaining is higher compared with a situation of low trust.
Ahigh level of trust does not only mean a reduction of uncer-
tainty and expectations of a win­win situation. It also means
lower expected transaction costs, for example, a lower level
of conflict or a less time-consuming bargaining process.
Trust also furthers interaction between the parties, which
reenforces trust (Axelrod, 1984; Thompson et al., 2010). All
these factors together lead us to the assumption that the pref-
erence for decentralized bargaining (plant-level bargaining)
will be stronger in a situation in which both parties trust each
other. The less trust put in the other party, the lower the
acceptance level of that party in terms of decentralized bar-
gaining. In this situation, the party will have a higher prefer-
ence for more centralized bargaining, that is, with the help of
a more powerful partner, in other words the employers asso-
ciation for the employer (or management) and the trade
union for the works council. Expressed in statistical terms,
we expect both a main effect and an interaction with respect
to trust. In a configuration characterized by mutual trust,
both sides should be more likely to regard plant-level bar-
gaining as a win­win situation. By contrast, a party that mis-
trusts the other respective party would focus more strongly
on the relative benefits of supraplant bargaining, such as the
externalization of conflicts (or transaction costs), and be less
inclined to support decentralized bargaining.
Primarily, our interest focuses on the effects of trust; how-
ever, other potential influencing factors are also taken into
account in the form of control variables.
Objective factors (such as economic context or size of
firm) do not exert their assumed influence on both corporate
parties to an equal extent and in the same direction. We
hypothesize that managers in a company experiencing an
unfavorable economic situation would be more aware of the
benefits of decentralized bargaining and, in such a situation,
more likely to be in favor of decentralized bargaining.
Conversely, the same economic situation could have the
opposite effect on the position of a works council if it fears
that a greater level of decentralized bargaining could result
in wage reductions and/or longer working hours. The effects
4 SAGE Open
of company size also require differentiation: In larger com-
panies, the management position on decentralized bargain-
ing is expected to be one of skeptical opposition because the
savings effect of multiemployer collective bargaining agree-
ments in terms of bargaining costs is more relevant in their
case. Although even potential bargaining with individual
employees is comparatively straightforward and not overly
time-consuming in small enterprises, bargaining regimes
that offer more comprehensive cover generally prove less
costly in larger companies. In the case of works councils, the
impact could well be the same, albeit for a different reason.
Works councils in large companies potentially have greater
bargaining power and thus see themselves better equipped
for a shift of bargaining to plant level. We furthermore argue
that the existing form of bargaining (or the existing degree of
decentralization) could have an effect on the preferences for
plant-level bargaining. In particular, the existence of a bind-
ing multiemployer collective agreement could have a posi-
tive or negative effect on the preference for decentralized
bargaining, depending on the experience with this type of
regulation and the respective protagonist. The degree of
unionization (of the works council) can have a negative
effect with respect to management, because the latter may
well be reluctant to get involved in major conflicts with a
highly organized and possibly confrontational works coun-
cil. The effect of this particular variable on the works council
is unclear because it is difficult to interpret. On one hand, a
higher unionization rate is equated with greater bargaining
power and consequently with a positive effect on the prefer-
ence for decentralized bargaining; on the other hand, higher
unionization reflects a stronger alignment of union positions,
which could be accompanied by a negative effect, namely,
rejection of decentralized bargaining.
Another important factor is the influence of the antici-
pated consequences of decentralized bargaining. Essentially,
the assumption is that the more the protagonists associate
positive consequences with decentralized bargaining, the
greater the preference for decentralized bargaining will be.
Data and Operationalization
Data
In 2005, a representative telephone survey was carried out
(by TNS EMNID) involving 1,000 personnel managers and
1,000 works councillors in as many companies, each with at
least 100 employees. In each company, a management rep-
resentative responsible for negotiating with the works coun-
cil was identified and interviewed. Taking this person as a
starting point, the interviewers then also questioned a mem-
ber of the works council (responsible for bargaining with the
management).
A random sample was drawn from the Hoppenstedt data-
base and divided into four size categories (100-199, 200-499,
500-999, and 1,000 or more employees). The survey included
all those companies with at least 100 employees from all
sectors--with the exception of agriculture and forestry, the
fishing industry, and the educational sector. Thus, our results
are primarily representative of manufacturing companies and
large companies with a works council.
Operationalization of Variables
Trust and trust relationships. The following statements
(drawing on a questionnaire by Kerkhof et al., 2003) were
applied to measure perceived trust (here in the formulations
used in relation to management trust in the works council):
1. The works council abides by agreements.
2. The management can rely on the works council if
the company experiences a difficult situation.
3. The works council is trustworthy.
4. The works council deems the achievement of a
mutual solution to be important when bargaining
with the management.
5. The works council is open to management propos-
als.
6. All in all, the works council and management have
a good relationship.
The trust the works councils place in management was also
analyzed using the respective questions for works councillors.
Factor analyses show a one-factor solution for managers
and works councillors alike (explained variance: 62% for
management and 63% for works councils). Cronbach's alpha
was .88 for both scales. For ease of interpretation, the trust
index adds the affirmative responses for each respective
question and divides the sum by the number of questions. In
addition, dichotomous variables that can assume the values 0
(low degree of trust) and 1 (high degree of trust) are com-
puted; the limits by which "low" and "high" are determined
have yet to be established. This point will be addressed later
in the study.
Trust relationships are conceptualized by cross-classifying
the dichotomized management and works council trust vari-
ables, which logically results in four possible combinations: a
low degree of mutual trust, unilateral trust on the part of the
works council, unilateral trust on the part of the management,
and a high degree of mutual trust.
Preference for decentralized bargaining. The preference for
decentralized bargaining is measured on the basis of three
questions derived from surveys carried out by the Institute of
Economic and Social Research in the Hans Böckler Founda-
tion, Germany (Bispinck, 2005) and the general debate on
decentralization and decentralized bargaining.
The first question relates to the perception that collective
bargaining agreements should only function as framework
regulations. "In the past, framework regulations were negoti-
ated in many collective bargaining agreements that had to be
implemented at the plant level (e.g., working hours). This is
Nienhueser and Hossfeld 5
consequently regarded as a `decentralization' of pay rate
policy and `decentralized bargaining' of work and pay
condition regulations. How would you evaluate this develop-
ment?" (scale: extremely positive­positive­neutral­negative­
extremely negative). For the logistic regression analysis, we
calculate a dummy variable, that is, the first two positive val-
ues are coded as 1, otherwise as 0.
The second question seeks to ascertain the position vis-à-
vis a greater shift of bargaining to plant level and the incor-
poration of plant protagonists: "There is also increasing
discussion about whether collective bargaining should take
place less at the supraplant level between employer associa-
tions and unions. Many suggestions call for a greater shift of
collective bargaining to plant level, in other words, between
managements and works councils. How would you evaluate
these suggestions?" (scale: extremely positive­positive­
neutral­negative­extremely negative). The dummy coding
is the same as for the first question.
The third question relates directly to a rejection or
endorsement of multiemployer collective bargaining agree-
ments: "All in all, I endorse a more intensive break away
from a system of multiemployer collective bargaining"
(scale: I fully agree­I tend to agree­I tend to disagree­I
totally disagree). For the logistic regression analysis, we cal-
culate a dummy variable with the positive values (agree)
coded as 1 and the negative (disagree) as 0.
The above questions refer to different aspects of bargain-
ing decentralization and hence they are used separately as
specific dependent variables.
Context or control variables. One important context variable
is the present type of bargaining regulation, or in other words,
the existing degree of decentralization. The type or form of
regulation is measured by a variable with the four following
attributes: (a) existence of an industry-wide collective bar-
gaining agreement; (b) existence only of a plant collective bar-
gaining agreement with a trade union; (c) no binding collective
bargaining agreement, but a collective agreement is used as
orientation (i.e., firms not covered by collective agreements
are influenced by the regulations set in industry-wide agree-
ments by the "orientation" of their managers toward such
agreements); or (d) no existing collective agreement and no
orientation toward a collective bargaining agreement. These
statements will also be used as dummy variables (reference
category: existing industry-wide collective bargaining
agreement).
Industry-sector affiliation is also to be included as a con-
trol variable (manufacturing sector; yes = 1).
The size of a company is measured by the number of
employees (up to 150 employees [reference category], 151-
250, 251-500, more than 500 employees).
We hypothesize that managers in companies located in the
newly formed German states (=1), recently established
companies (founded after 1990 = 1), and companies in an
unfavorable economic position (achieved profit = 1, otherwise
0) would tend more toward decentralized bargaining because
they would attach greater importance to the anticipated posi-
tive consequences of decentralized bargaining (particularly
alignment and pay reduction). Any future organizational
change could also play a role in terms of the preference for
decentralized bargaining (production or products will change
within the next 2 years = 1). To control for other potential dif-
ferentiations in corporate structure and processes, we incorpo-
rate the demographic composition of the workforce by using
the proportion of academics, women, and skilled workers as
proxies.
The degree of unionization of the works council members
( median 80% = 1) should prove a better indicator than the
unionization rate of a firm's total workforce. With regard to
the (perceived) power of the works council, both parties
were asked, "In your opinion, how much influence does your
works council have in comparison with other companies?"
(1 = above average, 0 = average/below average). With
regard to management preference for decentralized bargain-
ing, we draw on the manager's own assessment of power; for
the works councils' preference for decentralized bargaining,
we likewise draw on their own assessment.
Assessments of the consequences of decentralized bar-
gaining are obtained by considering a large number of
statements (drawing on Bispinck, 2005) relating to the spe-
cific consequences of a greater "break away from multiem-
ployer bargaining agreements--in other words, a more
intense use of opt-out clauses and a shift of bargaining to
the plant level involving the works councils and manage-
ments." The interviewees could express their endorsement
or rejection (on a respective four-stage scale ranging from
"totally agree" to "totally disagree") of the following state-
ments: (a) would take the different company situations bet-
ter into account, (b) would lead to conflicts within the
company, (c) would result in lower pay, (d) would give
more power to the unions within the company, (e) would
weaken the power of unions in Germany, (f) could help
save jobs, (g) would give the works council more influence
and freedom of scope, (h) would give the management
more influence and freedom of scope, (i) would unduly
expend too much time and effort, (j) would overtax the
works council, and (k) would overtax the management. To
eliminate the possible effect of the response option order, the
order of most of the statements was randomly changed from
interview to interview. A factor analysis, the results of which
are not reported in detail here, led to a three-factor solution
for both management and works councils. The first factor
can be interpreted as a cost factor encompassing transaction
costs (conflicts, time consumption) and production costs
(primarily pay reductions). The second factor is regarded as
an alignment and workplace effect factor, whereby the
assigned values for the following items were particularly
high: greater influence for the corporate protagonists,
enhanced alignment in terms of corporate concerns, and a
positive impact on jobs. The third factor ascertains the weak-
ening of the unions in both a company and supracompany
6 SAGE Open
sense. Overall, these three factors account for 55% (man-
agement) and 58% (works council) of the variance.
Results
Descriptive Findings
On average, the degree of trust (Table 1) is surprisingly high
in both parties (see Table 3 for descriptive statistics). The
management achieves levels of affirmative responses between
83% and 98% in the form of statements indicative of high
trust, whereas the levels attained by the works council are
only slightly lower (between 73% and 88% depending on the
statement). The summarizing statement "All in all, a good
relationship" achieves affirmative response levels of around
90% in respect of both parties (management 92%, works
council 88%). The trust index, which principally varies
between 1 (low degree of trust) and 4 (high degree of trust),
produces a median of 3.28 for the management and 3.07 for
the works council (SD = 0.52 and 0.54).
Consequently, a problem arises if a distinction is to be
made between "high" and "low" trust.
We calculated two different dichotomized trust variables
for each party. For Trust Variable 1, trust is coded as high (=1)
if all six questions receive an affirmative response; otherwise
the value of the variable will be zero. For Trust Variable 2, a
high value is allocated (=1) if at least four questions receive
an affirmative response (0 otherwise).
Both trust values are then cross-classified. The four pos-
sible combinations are shown in Table 2.
Nearly all cases (947 of 1,000) can be classified. If a high
trust level value is allocated only when all the statements
receive an affirmative response, then "only" 49.5% of cases
fall into the "mutual trust" constellation. If the threshold is
lowered and a high trust level value is allocated for four
affirmative responses, then the percentage of relationships
characterized by mutual trust rises to 78%.
Preference for decentralized bargaining. Managers and
works councils differ in their degree of preference for decen-
tralized bargaining (Table 4). Only between 20% and 31% of
works councillors endorse decentralized bargaining, whereas
the corresponding percentages for managers are between
65% and 85%.
Overall, this provides a clear picture: Managers take a
negative position against a multiemployer collective bar-
gaining system and show a high degree of preference for
decentralized bargaining. The evaluations of the works coun-
cils are largely a mirror image of the managers' evaluations.
Only a minority of works councils (20%) were in favor of a
break away from a system of multiemployer collective bar-
gaining, compared with 83% of the managers.
The question now is whether we can explain such differ-
ences. We hypothesize that trust relationships between the
works councils and management (independent of other
company characteristics and the consequences of decentral-
ized bargaining) will have an impact.

Determinants Relating to the Preference for
Decentralized Bargaining
The following is an analysis of the determinants relating to
preference for decentralized bargaining. Although the focus is
on the impact of the trust relationship, we also want to know
whether, and to what degree, other (contextual) factors may
also have an effect. We estimate a binary logistic regression
model. Trust is conceptualized using the trust constellation
variable (Version 1, see Table 2) and coding each constellation
as a dummy variable. For instance, "low mutual trust" is
coded as 1 if each party shows a low level of trust; otherwise
the variable is coded as 0. Thus, we apply three dummy vari-
ables; the reference category is "high degree of mutual trust."
The results are presented in the two following tables, which
encompass a total of six regression analyses.
To begin with, let us look at the effects relating to the man-
agers' preference for decentralized bargaining (Table 5).2
Trust has no statistically significant effect on the preference
for decentralized bargaining among managers; the strength
of the effect is negligible. The only nonsignificant effect
coefficient worth reporting on account of its strength does
not coincide with our hypotheses: In a situation where there
is a low degree of mutual trust, the chance that a manager
will endorse a break away from a multiemployer collective
bargaining system is higher by a factor of 1.602.3 As such,
our trust hypotheses are not corroborated in relation to three
core aspects of the preference for decentralized bargaining
(collective bargaining agreements as a framework, shifting of
bargaining to plant level, and endorsement of a break away
from multiemployer collective bargaining agreements).
By contrast, the form of regulation has a relatively strong
impact. When compared with the situation in companies
bound by multiemployer collective agreements, the chance
of a manager endorsing a break away from this multiem-
ployer bargaining system is around 11 times higher in the
case of managers at companies not bound by collective
agreements and not using such agreements for orientation
(effect coefficient = 11.322). That the anticipated conse-
quences of decentralized bargaining have a relatively strong
and significant effect is compellingly evident: Those who
anticipate higher costs in relation to decentralized bargaining
are likelier to reject it or, in the case of managers, endorse
it to a lesser extent. Those who perceive enhanced alignment
as a consequence are likelier to endorse decentralized
bargaining.
For the works councillors (Table 6), the pattern of results
corresponds with our trust hypothesis. We find a consistently
negative effect of low mutual trust on all three dimensions of
the preference for decentralized bargaining. In a constella-
tion of low mutual trust (compared with the reference cate-
gory), the preference for collective bargaining agreements
only in the form of regulating frameworks is significantly
lower (effect coefficient = 0.404). For the two other dimen-
sions, the effect coefficients are negative as hypothesized,
but not significant. Although we view these findings as a
(albeit weak) corroboration of our trust hypothesis with
regard to the works councils, we must admit that we weigh
the direction (and to some extent also the strength) of the
coefficients higher than their significance.
It is interesting that the preference for decentralized
bargaining--in relation to shifting bargaining to the plant
level and a general break away from the multiemployer col-
lective bargaining agreement system--is significantly stron-
ger among works councils in companies that use collective
bargaining agreements merely for orientation than among
those in companies bound to collective bargaining
agreements.

To summarize, it can be said that trust only has a weak
effect in the case of works councils in the regression analy-
ses. No effect can be identified in the case of managers. It is
now necessary to check whether these findings are indeed
reliable, for example, by including further variables and
other means of operationalization. This is dealt with below.
Discussion and Conclusions (For
Research)
The effects of trust on the preference for decentralized
bargaining in relation to the level of regulation are not verifi-
able in terms of the management. From a works council
perspective, mutual trust has (albeit weak and in part nonsig-
nificant) positive effects on the preference for decentralized
bargaining in general and on the preference for bargaining at
the plant level. This fact notwithstanding, a number of ques-
tions and problems still need to be addressed, and these are
discussed in the following section.
Overestimation of the Level ofTrust
The degree of trust appears to be very high, and it could well
be that it has been overestimated. We have, therefore, subse-
quently considered whether only companies in which a high
degree of trust prevailed actually responded. No information

is available to us in relation to companies in which the man-
agement were not willing to respond. In this situation, it is
not possible to determine the potential basis for overestima-
tion definitively. The fact that we used well-tested and only
slightly modified items for measuring trust means that few
measurement problems are likely to arise. Ultimately, the
assumption relating to overestimation can only be clarified
in further surveys. Perhaps the very reason why trust is so
important in industrial relationships, which are characterized
by contrasting interests and latent or manifest conflicts, is
because it is so fragile. This is conceivably one reason why
the protagonists are more likely to provide affirmative
responses to the generally positively formulated trust-item
questions. Other comparative measurement procedures
should thus be used to measure the extent of trust and its
various constellations.
Preference for Decentralized Bargaining
In conformity with other studies, the preference for decen-
tralized bargaining on the part of works council members
is marginal. Conversely, managers show a strong preference
for decentralized bargaining. There is no evidence of
measurement problems. As the correlations relating to the
Nienhueser and Hossfeld 11
consequences are contextually plausible in practically all
instances and are also sufficiently high, we conclude that the
measurement was valid.
Determinants Relating to the Preference for
Decentralized Bargaining
First, we cannot rule out the possibility that we have not
covered all aspects of the regulation of bargaining for all
companies. For instance, we do not measure whether "wild"
decentralization, in other words, firms illegally deviating
from binding collective agreements, is used as a way out of
the collective bargaining system. Similarly, we do not know
how long a firm is bound or not bound to a collective agree-
ment; this may be significant because the length of experi-
ence with the respective bargaining regulation could
influence the preference for decentralization.
In terms of the preference for a specific level of bargain-
ing, trust has no significant or notably strong effect on the
preference for decentralized bargaining among managers. In
the case of works councils, we tend to regard our hypothesis
on the positive effects of mutual trust as at least partly cor-
roborated. The second point thus concerns the open question
as to why such an effect is apparent in one case and not in the
other. One assumption is that works councils are less power-
ful; it follows that trust relationships, and consequently the
differences in trust relationships, have greater significance
for them than for management. Those who have less power
are more reliant on interpreting the actual and anticipated
behavior of those with greater power. Trust accordingly
plays a role in this context. The party with the greater power
can also impose its will on the other party--consequently
defining power--and has no need for trust. It may show
trust, but it is not obliged to do so. Moreover, differences in
trust are not relevant in terms of the more powerful party
imposing its will on the less powerful. The relationship
between power and trust would be an important subject for
further research.

Notes
1. If not explicitly stated, we use the terms plant-level, firm-level,
and company-level bargaining (or negotiations) as synonyms,
although the plant level is the most relevant for the relationship
between works councils and management.
2. We focus on the significance of effects but still take their
strength into account.
3. Positive effects are characterized by a coefficient greater than 1,
negative effects by a coefficient lower than 1.
