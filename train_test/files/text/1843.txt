Abstract
Background: National smoking prevalence estimates are the
primary basis for assessing progress in tobacco control across
the world. They are based on surveys of self-reported
cigarette smoking. It has been assumed that this is
sufficiently accurate for policy purposes, but this assump-
tion has not been adequately tested.
Methods: We report data from the 2003 Health Survey for
England, the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey for 2001-2002, and the 2004 national smoking
behaviors survey in Poland as examples of countries at
different stages in the ``tobacco epidemic.'' Self-reported
cigarette and total tobacco smoking prevalence were assessed
by means of the standard questions used in each country.
In subsamples, specimens were collected for analysis of
cotinine (saliva, N = 1,613 in England; serum, N = 4,687 in the
United States; and saliva, N = 388 in Poland) providing an
objective means of determining active smoking. A cut point
of 15 ng/mL was used to discriminate active smoking from
passive smoke exposure.
Results: Self-reported cigarette smoking prevalence using the
standard methods underestimated true tobacco smoking
prevalence by an estimated 2.8% in England, 0.6% in the
United States, and 4.4% in Poland. Cotinine concentrations
in those misclassified as nonsmokers were indicative of high
levels of smoke intake.
Interpretation: Underestimation of smoking prevalence was
minimal in the United States but significant in England and
Poland. A review of methodologies for assessing tobacco
smoking prevalence worldwide is urgently needed. (Cancer
Epidemiol Biomarkers Prev 2007;16(4):820­2)
Introduction
Smoking prevalence is a vital marker of progress in tobacco
control (1). Its assessment involves national surveys of self-
reported cigarette smoking status. Two threats to the accuracy
of prevalence estimates are (a) misreporting of smoking status
and (b) the failure to include non-cigarette tobacco smoking. It
is widely assumed that the level of misreporting is so low that
it will not lead to significant distortion. However, when
success or failure of tobacco control measures is typically
measured by changes of a few percentage points, even low
error rates can be important, if they differ over time or across
countries. We present data from three countries in which we
compare smoking prevalence assessed by cotinine measure-
ment with estimates based on standard self-report measures of
cigarette smoking.
Saliva or serum cotinine concentration is a quantitative marker
of nicotine intake (2). A concentration of 15 ng/mL in saliva or
serum is a conservative cut point for detecting active smoking
(2, 3). Using cotinine to check smoking status, there is evidence
that self-report is unreliable in specific populations where there is
pressure not to admit smoking, such as patients with respiratory
illness (4, 5) or cancer (6) or pregnant women (7-10).
Research on the use of cotinine to verify self-reported
smoking status in population surveys is limited. A large study
in Finland reported that male smoking prevalence would need
to be adjusted from 32% to 34% because of elevated serum
cotinine concentrations in putative nonsmokers (11). Another
study in the United States found that only 1.4% of self-reported
nonsmokers had serum cotinines higher than 15 ng/mL (12),
which would suggest an upward revision in prevalence
estimates of <1%. A review of earlier studies suggested that
only a small percentage of self-declared nonsmokers had
elevated cotinine levels in population surveys (13). The
prevailing view is that the problem of misreporting is not
sufficiently large to warrant routine biochemical verification in
population surveys (14).
The problem of misclassification of smoking status may be
different in different countries. To address this, we have
analyzed data from the 2003 Health Survey for England and
from the U.S. National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES) 2001-2002, both of which incorporate
cotinine measures. We also added saliva cotinine measurement
to the 2004 national survey on smoking behaviors in Poland, a
country with a much higher smoking prevalence (15).
The headline smoking prevalence figures are based on
cigarettes only; however, cigar and pipe smoking also carry
health risks and result in nicotine absorption (16, 17); therefore,
we examined how far increased prevalence figures derived
from cotinine concentrations could be attributed to exclusion
of pipe and cigar smoking versus underreporting of any
tobacco smoking.

Materials and Methods
England. The Health Survey for England is an annual
household survey that includes a representative sample of
adults aged 16 and above. Data collection involves an initial
interview at home followed by a visit from a research nurse
about 1 week later. Smoking behavior in those aged 16 and
above was ascertained at the initial interview and again at the
nurse visit. A saliva sample for cotinine was collected at the
nurse visit in a random subsample.3
A total of 14,836 people aged 16 years and above were
interviewed, and 11,408 participated at the nurse visit.
Respondents were asked if they used cigarettes, pipes, or
cigars ``. . . at all these days.'' This standard question was used
to determine whether they were current cigarette smokers or
current tobacco smokers. Ex-smokers were defined as those
who reported being ex­regular cigarette smokers at interview
and who also denied any current tobacco use at the nurse visit.
In one sixth of participants, additional measures were taken,
including a saliva sample that was analyzed for cotinine by
rapid gas-liquid chromatography with nitrogen detection (18).
One nonsmoking Nicotine Replacement Therapy (NRT) user
was excluded from the analysis. There were 1,613 usable saliva
samples.
The mean age of the sample was 48 years (SD, 18.5); 56%
were female; 64% were married or cohabiting; 57% had the
equivalent of ``O'' level education (post-16 qualification) or
above; 44% were from manual occupational groups. The
corresponding figures for those providing usable saliva
samples were similar: mean age, 48 years (SD, 17.5); 55%
female; 67% married or cohabiting; 60% ``O'' level or above;
44% manual occupational groups.
United States. The NHANES target population is the
civilian noninstitutionalized U.S. population. NHANES
2001-2002 oversampled African Americans and Mexican
Americans, as well as persons aged 60 and above. Respondents
were interviewed in their homes and then invited to attend a
Mobile Examination Center (MEC) for objective measures
about 2 weeks later. Smoking behavior in those aged 20 and
above was ascertained in detail at the initial interview using
standard questions for determining national prevalence. At the
MEC visit, a serum sample for cotinine was taken, and
respondents were asked about the use of cigarettes and other
tobacco products and NRT over the past 5 days. Self-reported
smoking for the whole sample was based on responses
at initial interview. Among respondents who provided a
cotinine sample, self-reported smoking was derived from
cigarette, pipe, or cigar use at the MEC. Users of smokeless
tobacco products and NRT were excluded from the analyses.
Ex-smokers were those who reported being ex­cigarette
smokers at interview and who also denied any smoking in
the past 5 days at the MEC. There were 5,411 respondents in
the total sample aged 20 and above (mean age, 50; SD, 19.5);
53% were female, and 69% had high school education or
above. A total of 5,027 people attended the MEC, providing
4,687 usable serum samples. Cotinine was analyzed by means
of high-performance liquid chromatography/tandem mass
spectrometry.
Poland. Data were obtained from an annual survey on
smoking behaviors and attitudes that is based on a representa-
tive random sample of households. The survey was conducted
by the Cancer Centre and Institute of Oncology in collaboration
with the public opinion research center (TNS OBOP).
The 2004 survey interviewed 1,005 people aged 15 and
above. The sample was obtained from the Postcode Address
and Inhabitants Register (PESEL) that is available for the
general Polish population at the Central Statistical Office.
Sampling was based on a random-route method, with random
selection of ``starting point'' addresses and then, according to
predefined procedures, selection of other addresses. Sampling
was conducted in three strata (rural, towns up to 100,000
inhabitants, towns with more than 100,000 inhabitants) in all
the biggest administrative units (voivodeships). In selected
households, 15-year-old and older inhabitants were randomly
selected from within the household to participate.
Respondents were asked, ``Have you ever smoked at least 100
cigarettes, pipes, cigars, etc. in your lifetime? Yes/No.'' Those
who answered yes were asked, ``Do you smoke now? Yes/No.''
These questions defined whether they were classified as
smokers, ex-smokers, or never smokers. Pipe and cigar smoking
is extremely rare, and thus, separate figures are not given for
cigarette versus total tobacco smoking. Respondents were
invited to provide a saliva sample, and 388 agreed and provided
a sample volume sufficient for analysis. Cotinine was assayed
using the method previously described for the English sample.
The sample consisted of 59% women. The mean age was
46.1 years (SD, 18.9); 57% were married or living with a
partner; 23% completed only primary education; 29% com-
pleted vocational or ``gymnasium'' education; 32% had
completed secondary education; and 15% completed postsec-
ondary or university education; 33% were in employment or
self-employed. The corresponding figures for those that
provided a saliva specimen were very similar: 54% female;
mean age 46.0 (SD, 19.3); 55% were married or living with a
partner; 22% completed primary education; 27% completed
gymnasium or secondary education; 15% completed post­
secondary education; and 33% were in employment or self-
employed.

Results
England. In the English sample, cigarette smoking preva-
lence in the total sample was 24.7%. A further 24.4% were
ex-smokers. The current self-reported tobacco smoking prev-
alence, including pipes and cigars, was 26.0%. In the sample
from whom saliva specimens were obtained, cigarette smok-
ing prevalence was identical at 24.7%; ex-smokers were 24.7%,
and self-reported current tobacco smokers comprised 26.2%
(Table 1).
Of the self-reported ex- or never smokers, 2.7% had cotinine
concentrations above the smoking cut point of 15 ng/mL (1.9%
of those who said they had never smoked and 4.4% of
``ex-smokers''). However, 3.2% of those who reported being
tobacco smokers had cotinine concentrations below 15 ng/mL.
This resulted in 27.5% being classified as ``inhaling tobacco
smokers'' according to their saliva cotinine concentrations
(Table 1). The prevalence of any tobacco smoking, defined
as the percentage of self-reported smokers plus those with
a saliva cotinine concentration z15 ng/mL, was 28.8%. The
mean cotinine concentration in self-declared nonsmokers with
cotinine concentrations of at least 15 ng/mL was 128 ng/mL
(SD, 110.8).
United States. In the U.S. sample, the prevalence of self-
reported cigarette smoking was 21.7% (Table 1) and was
slightly higher (22.8%) for respondents among whom cotinine
was measured. Self-reported total smoking, including pipes
and cigars, was 22.8%, and in the subsample with cotinine
assays, it was slightly higher at 24.2%; 1.3% of nonsmokers
had cotinine concentrations above 15 ng/mL (2.4% of self-
reported ex-smokers and 0.7% of self-reported never smokers).
The mean cotinine concentration in these nonsmokers was
210 ng/mL (SD, 229.0). About 10.1% of self-reported smokers
had cotinine <15 ng/mL, so the prevalence of adults with
cotinines above this threshold (excluding snuffers, chewers,
and NRT users from consideration) was 23.4%. The prevalence
of smoking, defined as cotinine above 15 ng/mL, or self-
reported smoking was 25.5%.
Poland. Tobacco smoking prevalence in the whole Polish
sample by self-report was 35.3%. A further 20.5% were ex-
smokers. The self-reported smoking prevalence in the 388 who
provided a saliva sample was slightly higher at 37.6%, and
21.1% were ex-smokers.
Of the self-reported ex- or never smokers, 9.5% had cotinine
concentrations above the cut point for smoking (8.0% of self-
declared never smokers and 12.2% of ex-smokers); 4.8% of self-
declared smokers had cotinine concentrations below 15 ng/
mL. Thus, 41.8% were classified as smokers by cotinine, and
the prevalence of smoking defined in terms of self-report or an
elevated cotinine was 43.6%. In the self-declared nonsmokers
with cotinines above the smoking cut point, the mean cotinine
was 212 ng/mL (SD, 150.4 ng/mL).
Discussion
Self-reported cigarette smoking prevalence underestimated
true tobacco smoking prevalence minimally in the U.S. sample
but by 4% in the Polish sample. Those who were misclassified
had cotinine concentrations indicative of substantial levels of
active smoking, which could not be due to passive exposure. In
England, about half of the underestimation of smoking
prevalence was attributable to pipe and cigar smoking and the
rest to misreporting. In Poland, the underestimate seemed to be
mostly based on misreporting, although it is possible that the
requirement to have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their
lifetime may have misclassified some adolescent smokers. In
theory, some nonsmokers may have been using NRT, but
incidence is very low in Poland,4 and the misreporting rate was
almost as high for self-declared never smokers as ex-smokers.
A failure of self-report to accurately capture smoking status
is just one of a number of serious threats to the validity of
national prevalence surveys and comparisons made using
these. We have not considered the role played by different age
ranges canvassed in different countries, different questions, nor
the fact that some countries only present daily smoking figures.
In conclusion, our data indicate that headline figures for
cigarette smoking prevalence in England and Poland under-
estimate the rate of active tobacco smoking. The degree of
underestimation was greater in Poland than in England. Our
findings indicate the need for an urgent review of methods of
estimating smoking prevalence that takes into consideration all
forms of tobacco smoking and correction using a biochemical
marker. Such a review should also examine other issues such
as the definition of a smoker and the age range canvassed.
