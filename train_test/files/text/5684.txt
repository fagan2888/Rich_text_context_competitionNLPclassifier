Abstract
Agriculture has played a pivotal role in shaping landscapes, soils and vegetation. Developing a
better understanding of early farming practices can contribute to wider questions regarding the
long-term impact of farming and its nature in comparison with present-day traditional agrosystems.
In this study we determine stable carbon and nitrogen isotope values of barley grains from a
series of present-day traditionally managed farming plots in Morocco, capturing a range of annual
rainfall and farming practices. This allows a framework to be developed to refine current isotopic
approaches used to infer manuring intensity and crop water status in (semi-)arid regions. This
method has been applied to charred crop remains from two early farming sites in the eastern
Mediterranean: Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal. In this way, our study enhances knowledge of
agricultural practice in the past, adding to understanding of how people have shaped and adapted
to their environment over thousands of years.

Introduction
Agriculture has had a major role in shaping landscapes, soils and vegetation, and the beginning of
agriculture is one of the candidates for the onset of theAnthropocene (Ruddiman, 2003). Developing
a better understanding of early farming practices, revealing the various inputs that were required to
make agriculture a success under a range of social and ecological conditions, can therefore contrib-
ute to wider questions regarding the trajectory of present-day economies and the agricultural basis
of today's subsistence practices.
Although much research has focused on the when and where of early cultivation and crop
domestication (e.g. Price and Bar-Yosef, 2011; Willcox, 2013), less is known about the nature of
early farming itself, including tillage and weeding, manuring, water management, the longevity of
cultivation and the interplay between crop and animal husbandry. Manuring of fields, in particular,
implies an investment in the land, since `topping up' of nutrient levels is only required if plots are
long-lived; consecutive crop harvests eventually strip the soil of nutrients, which must be replaced
if subsequent crop yields are to be maintained (e.g. Rothamsted Research, 2006: 9). Manuring also
implies a certain labour input and a close interdependence between crop and animal husbandry,
collection and subsequent spreading of manure requires management of domestic animals and is
costly in terms of time and labour (Halstead, 2014). Moreover, since manure is a finite resource,
strategic decisions about its application were likely to have been necessary in order to maximise
crop yields most effectively, and to enable surpluses to buffer against potential future crop failures
(Halstead, 1989).
In the so-called Fertile Crescent region of the eastern Mediterranean, where the earliest crop
cultivation and domestication are currently documented (Willcox, 2013), rainfed cultivation is pos-
sible but water is the major limitation to growth, as in other semi-arid regions (mean annual rainfall
300­600 mm; Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), 1987; Noy-Meir, 1973; Webb et al.,
1978). Water management practices, whether through location of cultivated plots close to natural
water sources or on soils with better natural water retention, or through small-scale hand-watering
or larger-scale irrigation works, help to ensure favourable and reliable crop yields (Abbo et al.,
2010; Halstead and O'Shea, 1989). Manuring has also been found to improve the water use effi-
ciency of some crop species (Hati et al., 2006). As with manuring, water management practices
require strategic planning and management of the cultivated environment, since wetter areas in
arid regions are likely to be scarce, and high labour inputs may be required for hand-watering and
manipulation of water supplies.
By assessing the likelihood of manuring and water management at early farming sites, it is
therefore possible to infer the degree to which early farming societies were investing in the long-
term productivity of the land and in the day-to-day maintenance of soil quality, and making stra-
tegic decisions about the use of valuable resources such as labour, manure and water. A range of
models have been proposed for early farming regimes (summarized in Bogaard, 2005), each with
varying degrees of labour input and investment in the land: shifting cultivation, extensive ard
cultivation, floodplain farming and intensive gardening. Our aim here is not to test these models
per se, since this would require incorporation of ecological analysis of arable weed flora along-
side stable isotope analysis (cf. Bogaard et al., 2015). Rather, the most relevant contrasts for this
discussion of crop isotope chemistry and farming in arid regions are those between relatively
low- and high-input forms of cultivation, where management intensity relates to maintenance of
crop water and nutrient supply: maintenance of adequate water and soil nutrients would point to
relatively intensive management, as in a `gardening' regime. Naturally favourable water supply
and soil fertility would arguably be available in floodplains (Sherratt, 1980), but this model for
4 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)
early cultivation was developed without ethnographic support (Isaakidou, 2011) and relies on
spring sowing for which there is no archaeobotanical evidence (Hillman, 2000; Jones et al., 2013).
In this paper, stable isotope values were determined for barley grains sampled from a series of
modern farming plots in Morocco, one of the few (semi)-arid areas of the Mediterranean where
traditional agrosystems offer a range of watering and manuring regimes under different annual
rainfall conditions, supplementing stable isotope data from modern bread wheat grains grown
under a range of controlled irrigation and manuring regimes at an experimental station nearAleppo,
Syria (see Fraser et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2013). These data allow a framework to be developed
that will refine current stable isotopic approaches used to infer manuring intensity and crop water
status in (semi)-arid regions. This refined method is then applied to charred (carbonized) crop
remains (cereal grains and pulse seeds) from two early farming sites in the eastern Mediterranean:
Abu Hureyra in the northern Levant, and `Ain Ghazal in the southern Levant (Figure 5). These
sites date to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic and beginning of the Pottery Neolithic (PPNB and PN;
c.8800-6000 cal. BC), a period during which both cultivation and herding were becoming estab-
lished and widespread. The intention is to identify crop isotope signatures that deviate from those
expected because of environmental factors (for which rainfall is used as an index), and thus to
identify, or discount, potential management practices. In this way, our study aims to enhance
knowledge of early agricultural practice, informing wider debates regarding societal changes and
subsistence strategies at the advent of farming.
Crop nitrogen isotope values
Crop nitrogen isotope (15N) values integrate a range of environmental and physiological pro-
cesses, but largely reflect the 15N value of the soil in which they are grown (e.g. Evans, 2001;
Högberg, 1997). Studies of modern crops have found that manuring can increase the 15N values
of cereals by as much as 10, and this increase is related to the intensity ­ amount and frequency
­ of manuring (e.g. Bol et al., 2005; Fraser et al., 2011), as well as the type of manure (Szpak,
2014). Based on these modern studies, cereal grain 15N values for high, medium and low/no
manuring levels have been estimated (see Figure 3; cf. Bogaard et al., 2013: figure 1). Since
changes in manuring level take a number of years to register in crop 15N values (Fraser et al.,
2011), contrasts in crop 15N values reflect sustained differences in cultivation, indicating variable
investment in the land over many years.
The potential of 15N values of carbonized crop remains from archaeological sites as a means of
assessing manuring intensity has been demonstrated in a number of recent studies within temperate
Europe (Bogaard et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013; Kanstrup et al., 2014; Styring et al., in press;
Vaiglova et al., 2014), revealing that farmers in Europe and the Mediterranean practised varying
levels of manuring on sites from as early as 5900 cal. bc. Another recent study, by Araus et al.
(2014), determined the 15N of pre-domestic and domestic cereal grains from a series of sites in the
Near East dating from c. 11,070 cal. bc to the present-day. This study found that cereal grain 15N
values decreased over the millennia, a trend that the authors interpret as a reflection of decreasing
soil fertility (Araus et al., 2014). A large proportion (45%) of the determined cereal grain 15N
values were > 6, which in temperate climates would be consistent with intensive manuring
(Bogaard et al., 2013). However, 70% of cereal grains with 15N values > 6 were associated with
pre-domestication cultivation, which although not precluding the possibility of early middening/
manuring, is unlikely to have been closely integrated with animal husbandry (cf. Araus et al.,
2014). It is possible that the high cereal grain 15N values determined by Araus et al. (2014) are at
least partly due to environmental factors such as aridity, which increases plant 15N values (e.g.
Styring et al. 5
Aranibar et al., 2004; Handley et al., 1999; Heaton, 1987). It is therefore necessary to disentangle
the effect of manuring from that of aridity before farming practice can be assessed reliably at the
archaeological sites in the semi-arid regions where early farming began.
To distinguish the contribution of manure from environmental factors (such as aridity), the
approach of recent studies has been to estimate the 15N values of plants consumed by herbivores
found at the same archaeological site/phase, by subtracting the offset (c. 4; Steele and Daniel,
1978) between consumer and diet from the 15N values of preserved herbivore bone collagen, and
to use this as a proxy for an unmanured crop 15N value (Bogaard et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2013;
Styring et al., in press; Vaiglova et al., 2014). This estimated 15N value could differ from the true
15N value of unmanured cereal grains because herbivores consume a range of plant parts, making
it difficult to apply a consistent 15N offset (Fraser et al., 2011; Rothamsted Research, unpublished
data, 1991). There is also a possibility that domestic herbivores may have received supplementary
fodder in the form of crop residues, which may have been manured. Notwithstanding these limita-
tions, the estimated herbivore diet gives an approximate indication of the 15N values to expect for
unmanured crops, allowing some assessment of whether any environment-related enrichment of
crop 15N is likely, independent of that resulting from agricultural management. In cases where
faunal bones are not found or bone collagen is not well-preserved, or the range in herbivore 15N
values is so large that an unmanaged plant 15N baseline is not meaningful (e.g. Pearson, 2013), an
independent means of inferring a plant isotopic baseline for a particular environment is
necessary.
Aridity and nitrogen isotope values
Various studies of soils and vegetation have found a positive correlation between aridity (low rain-
fall and high evapotranspiration) and 15N values (e.g. Aranibar et al., 2004; Austin and Vitousek,
1998; Craine et al., 2009; Handley et al., 1999; Hartman and Danin, 2010; Heaton, 1987; Swap
et al., 2004). The mechanisms of this enrichment remain speculative, but current hypotheses sug-
gest that 15N values relate to the `openness' of the nitrogen (N) cycle: the extent to which N is in
excess to plant demand and can therefore be lost through volatilization (c.f. Austin and Vitousek,
1998). Any process that decreases the flux of N into organic matter or increases the flux of N from
organic matter to mineral pools favours this volatilization and therefore N loss (Handley et al.,
1999). Both plant growth and microbial activity decrease with decreasing soil moisture, producing
an excess of readily volatilized mineral-N (Barber, 1995; Stark and Firestone, 1995) whose loss
increases the 15N value of the remaining soil-N. This enrichment in soil 15N can be enhanced by
progressive cycles of wetting and drying, which also stimulate loss of N in the form of N2
O and
NO (Austin et al., 2004). Rainfall thus tends to account for the majority of the variation in 15N
values of unmanaged plants (e.g. Craine et al., 2009; Handley et al., 1999; Hartman and Danin,
2010; Swap et al., 2004), but the trend is complicated by differences in mychorrhizal interactions
(Craine et al., 2009), soil texture (Aranibar et al., 2004) and plant type (Gebauer and Ehleringer,
2000; Hartman and Danin, 2010).
Crop carbon isotope values
Crop carbon isotope (13C) values reflect the water status of the crop during its growth period
(e.g. Araus et al., 1997; Farquhar and Richards, 1984). In C3
plants, differences in plant 13C val-
ues relate to the degree of stomatal conductance, i.e. the rate of passage of CO2
through stomata,
which is regulated according to water availability (Ehleringer et al., 1993; Farquhar et al., 1989).
6 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)
In well-watered conditions, open stomata freely permit the assimilation of CO2
, allowing dis-
crimination against the heavier 13C isotope and resulting in more negative plant 13C values. In
drier/poorly watered conditions, closed stomata restrict the assimilation of CO2
, reducing dis-
crimination against 13C and resulting in less negative plant 13C values.
The degree of discrimination against 13C varies between species (e.g. Ferrio et al., 2005; Flohr
et al., 2011; Wallace et al., 2013), so that e.g. barley and wheat grown in the same watering condi-
tions will have different 13C values. Water status itself can be influenced by many factors, includ-
ing water inputs (i.e. rainfall, anthropogenic watering) and water losses (i.e. evapotranspiration), as
well as by the water-holding capacity of the soil. For this reason, Wallace et al. (2013) proposed
three broad levels of water status based on crop 13C values: poorly watered crops for which water
availability imposes major limitations on growth; well-watered crops for which water is not a
major limitation on growth; and moderately watered crops which fall between the two.
When using crop 13C values to infer water status of archaeological crop remains, it is also
necessary to account for the change in the 13C value of atmospheric carbon dioxide (13Cair
) over
time. Today, the 13Cair
value is c. -8 (White and Vaughn, 2011) but it was higher in the past. The
13Cair
values for the time periods covered by the archaeobotanical samples were therefore approxi-
mated by the AIRCO2_LOESS system (Ferrio et al., 2005) and these are given in Wallace et al.
(2015). This allows the watering bands established from modern crop watering experiments to be
applied to crop remains from different time periods. Crop 13C values are converted to 13C values

Crop isotope values in semi-arid regions: A pilot study in Morocco
This study determines the 15N and 13C values of hulled six-row barley grains (Hordeum vulgare
subsp. vulgare) growing in traditionally managed manured and unmanured fields (n = 34) receiv-
ing different quantities of annual rainfall (190 to 700 mm/yr) and supplementary water from
irrigation in Morocco from October, 2013 to March/May, 2014 (Figure 1 and Supplementary
Table 1, available online). This isotope study was carried out alongside a weed survey of the same
fields. Table 1 gives details of the climate, manuring and irrigation regimes, summarized by farm.
Since these are not experimental plots, better control over manure and water inputs was not pos-
sible, but these agricultural conditions represent real-life situations, providing an insight into the
constraints imposed on agricultural decision making by the environment. No commercial
N-containing fertilizers were used on any of the plots included in this study and had not been used
for at least three years prior to crop sampling. For the most part, interviews were conducted with
farmers who tended the fields. The mean annual rainfall quoted is from the Aquastat climate
information tool (http://www.fao.org/nr/water/aquastat/climateinfotool/index.stm) from the Food
and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The data for the Aquastat climate informa-
tion tool originated from the CRU CL 2.0 data set (New et al., 2002) and use the means of obser-
vations made from 1961 to 1990. The aridity index (a numerical indicator of the degree of dryness)
for each location was calculated by dividing mean annual precipitation by reference evapotranspi-
ration (Middleton and Thomas, 1997), as quoted by the Aquastat climate information tool. Ten
ears were randomly selected from each field, or were selected from five locations along a transect
through each field. Half of the collected ears were then threshed, and a random selection of 50
Styring et al. 7
grains was homogenized in a freezer mill to give an average isotope value for the growing condi-
tion. More details of the analytical methods are given in Supplementary Information, available
online.
Figure 2 plots barley grain 15N values against 13C values. Watering bands are defined from
those determined for modern two-row hulled barley grains grown under different irrigation regimes
in Borja, Spain (Wallace et al., 2013), and adjusted for the difference in13C values of two-row and
six-row barley growing in the same watering conditions (c. 1; Voltas et al., 1998, 1999). The
barley sampled in the Rif region of northern Morocco (Figure 1; AGD and BEL) received no
manure and relatively high annual rainfall (703 mm/yr) and growing conditions are classified as
dry-subhumid from the calculated aridity index (0.58; UNESCO, 1979). Its 13C values fall into
the well-watered band (Figure 2) and its relatively low 15N values, ranging from -0.3 to 1.4,
plot within the no/low manuring band established from modern experimental farms in temperate
Europe (Figure 3; Bogaard et al., 2013; Fraser et al., 2011).
Also plotted in Figure 3 are the 15N values of bread wheat grains grown in controlled condi-
tions on newly established plots at an experimental station near Aleppo, Syria (Figure 5 and
Supplementary Table 1, available online). These bread wheat plots received differing quantities of
manure and irrigation water in two separate years of cultivation (see Fraser et al., 2011). There is
no difference in the 15N values of bread wheat and barley grown under the same manuring condi-
tions (Fraser et al., 2011), so barley and bread wheat 15N values can be used interchangeably here.
As Fraser et al. (2011) note, the effect of manuring on cereal grain 15N values is variable on these
newly established plots, with grain 15N values increasing significantly with manuring in the year
when rainfall was higher (2009) but to a much lesser extent when rainfall was low. The level of

10 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)
irrigation had no clear effect on bread wheat 15N values (Fraser et al., 2011). These results dem-
onstrate that the effect of manure on crop 15N values can be detected after the first year of manure
application, but the extent to which 15N values increase is variable, likely influenced by changes
in annual rainfall and past land use.
The barley sampled in and around the Amtoudi oasis in southern Morocco (Figure 1) came
from both rainfed and irrigated oasis fields. The rainfed fields are associated with three different
farms (AGU, ISS, OMA) situated within 30 km of the oasis, but located at a higher elevation (up
to c. 1110 m a.s.l. compared with c. 780 m a.s.l.), which means that they receive more rainfall
(272 mm/yr compared with 194 mm/yr) and can support rainfed crops. Nevertheless, the growing
conditions are classified as arid by the calculated aridity index (0.19; UNESCO, 1979). The rain-
fed fields received low quantities of sheep manure every two to three years. The barley 15N
values range from 4.7 to 10.6 (Figure 2), the large variability likely reflecting a wide geo-
graphical region and therefore more varied environmental conditions, and considerable variation
in manuring practice between fields. The barley 13C values (Figure 2) indicate that they were
relatively poorly watered, and thus that water was a limitation to growth. Figure 3 shows that the
determined grain 15N values overestimate the level of manuring based on bands established in
temperate Europe, since the majority fall within the high manuring band.
The fields in the oasis receive lower annual rainfall than the rainfed fields nearby, but they are
irrigated every 15 days in autumn and every 7 days in summer (a total of 28 times over the growing
season), by flooding to the point of saturation with water from an underground aquifer. It has been
calculated that irrigation water input equates to c. 70 mm per irrigation cycle and c. 2000 mm/yr (see
Supplementary Information for calculations, available online). The environmental conditions are
classified as arid from the calculated aridity index (0.12; UNESCO, 1979), but if irrigation water
input is also considered, the calculated aridity index is 1.42. The oasis fields receive sheep manure
twice a year, with each autumn- and summer-sown crop, equating to c. 100 t/ha ­ an extremely high
level of manuring that is readily observable in the dark colour and texture of the resulting artificial
`dung-soil' (see Table 1). The barley 15N values range from 12.5 to 15.4 (Figure 2; IDA), the
smaller variation in 15N values compared with the rainfed fields reflecting a much more uniform
method of manuring. The barley 13C values (Figure 2) indicate that they were moderately to well-
watered, demonstrating that irrigation inputs were sufficient to prevent water being a limitation to
growth. In Figures 3 and 4, the 15N values of the barley from the oasis fields have been plotted
against a natural log scale of mean annual rainfall for their location. We use mean annual rainfall
rather than water input (i.e. rainfall + irrigation water) because it acts as an index of wider environ-
mental conditions (e.g. temperature, evaporation potential), which all affect the `openness' of the N
cycle and thus the volatilization of 15N-depleted N, resulting in higher plant 15N values. Moreover,
the level of irrigation (water input ranging from c. 250 mm/yr to c. 1200 mm/yr on experimental
plots near Aleppo) has not been found to affect cereal grain 15N values in previous studies (Fraser
et al., 2011). The 15N values of the barley growing in the oasis fields plot correctly within the high
manuring level band in Figure 3, but are much higher than the 15N values of any other cereal grains
determined in temperate Europe (Fraser et al., 2011; Kanstrup et al., 2011).
Disentangling the effect of manuring from aridity on crop
15N values
Ideally, we would have sampled both manured and unmanured crops from all regions in Morocco
in order to fully assess the difference in 15N values caused by manuring. However, no fields in the
Rif region studied were manured because of a lack of available manure, and all fields in and around
the Amtoudi oasis received some manure input. We have therefore made use of the trend
Styring et al. 11
determined by Hartman and Danin (2010) between 15N values of unmanaged (unmanured) annual
plants and the natural log scale of mean annual rainfall in order to estimate the expected 15N val-
ues of unmanured cereals at different rainfall levels.
In the Hartman and Danin study, unmanaged plants were sampled along a rainfall transect in
Israel, from 1000 mm to less than 50 mm mean annual rainfall. The regression for annual plants
(15N = -3.19[log(mean annual rainfall)] + 19.09) from this study was chosen as the closest com-
parison to cereals. Furthermore, it ignores the 15N values of plants growing on exposed ridges,
where very low N availability and reliance on atmospheric N-fixation by cyanobacteria leads to
very low 15N values in areas of low rainfall (Evans and Ehleringer, 1993; West, 1990). Such con-
ditions are unlikely to be relevant to arable land. More 15N data from unmanaged cereal grains
growing in different rainfall regimes is needed to refine this relationship further, but this is difficult
to attain since agriculture in many (semi-)arid regions now involves irrigation and/or artificial
fertilizers and many of the soils have become too degraded for viable crop yields. In order to relate
the 15N values of annual plant leaves determined in the Hartman and Danin study to the 15N
values of cereal grains, the mean offset in 15N between bread wheat grains and leaves from a
range of inorganic-N and manure fertilized plots throughout a growing season (1.4 ± 0.9;
Rothamsted Research, unpublished data, 1991) was used to adjust the regression line.
In Figure 4, we again plot the barley 15N values against the natural log scale of mean annual
rainfall. We have used the regression between unmanaged plant 15N values, adjusted for grain-leaf
offset (15N = -3.19[log(mean annual rainfall)] + 20.49), and the natural log scale of mean annual
rainfall to adjust the manuring level bands established in temperate Europe. With these adjusted
manuring bands, the 15N values of the sampled barley grains more accurately reflect the true
manuring levels. The 15N values of barley grains from northern Morocco plot on the regression
line for no manure, the 15N values of barley from the rainfed fields in southern Morocco plot
Figure 4. Plot of barley and bread wheat 15N values against a natural log scale of rainfall, with manuring
bands adjusted for the regression between unmanaged plant 15N values and rainfall.
12 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)
around the medium level of manure, and the 15N values of barley from the oasis fields plot in the
high manuring level band. The bread wheat grains from Aleppo also plot within the no/low and
medium manuring level bands, which broadly corresponds to the rates of manure applied on these
newly established plots. As noted above, manuring of plots in the drier year (2008) at Aleppo did
not result in a clear increase in crop 15N values.
The adjusted manuring bands more accurately reflect known manuring practices in Morocco
and Syria and can therefore tentatively be used to assess past manuring practice from crop 15N
values at sites situated in areas with low rainfall. Herbivore bone collagen 15N values can also be
used to estimate unmanured plant 15N values and therefore further ground truth this model on a
range of archaeological sites.
The early farming sites of Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal
To date, the earliest evidence for crop cultivation has been found in southwest Asia, dating to the
10th millennium bc (Willcox, 2013). While much research has focused on determining the location
and date of the earliest crop cultivation and subsequent domestication (e.g. Brown et al., 2009;
Fuller et al., 2005; White and Denham, 2007; Zohary et al., 2012), less is known about the farming
practices involved in this early agriculture. Isotopic analysis of the cereal grains themselves can
reveal manure inputs (15N) and the water status of the crops (13C). To this end, this study deter-
mines 15N values of barley grain and pulse seed samples from the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B and
Pottery Neolithic periods (PPNB and PN; c. 8800­6000 cal. bc) of Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal,

focusing on a period when domestic crop cultivation and animal husbandry were newly established
and potentially integrated (Bogaard, 2005). Each sample represents between 5 and 80 individual
grains/seeds, homogenized prior to analysis. The 13C values of the same barley grain and pulse
seed samples have been determined by Wallace et al. (2015). No faunal isotope data are available
from Abu Hureyra because of poor preservation of bone collagen, but 13C and 15N values of
caprine bone collagen (n = 50) from PPN `Ain Ghazal have also been determined previously
(Makarewicz, 2007; Miller, 2012). This provides an unmanaged plant 15N baseline with which to
compare the 15N values of the crop remains determined in this study. The results of these earlier
isotope studies are summarized in the section `Isotopic composition of fauna and crops from Abu
Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal'.
Abu Hureyra, on the southern bank of the Euphrates river (Figure 5), is a significant site as its
occupation spanned the transition from a hunter-forager to farming economy. The site is located at
the boundary of two contrasting environmental zones: drier steppe to the south and moist, often
waterlogged, floodplain to the north (Moore et al., 2000: 3). Today the site receives c. 230 mm of
annual rainfall but it has been estimated from 18O values of speleothems in the Soreq Cave that
annual rainfall was c. 175­450 mm higher between 10,000 and 7000 BP (c. 8000­5000 cal. bc)
than it is today (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997). We therefore plot the barley 15N values against a
range of annual rainfall values between 175 and 450 mm higher than today's rainfall. In this study
we focus on Abu Hureyra 2 (c. 8800­6000 cal. bc), the second phase of occupation, where cultiva-
tion of domestic crops and herding of domestic animals were the dominant means of subsistence
for the sedentary community, although in the earliest period hunting of wild animals was still eco-
nomically important. Hulled two-row barley grain samples (n = 6) covering all three periods of the
site's occupation ­ 2A, 2B and 2C ­ were selected for isotope analysis.
Period 2A dates from c. 8800 to 7400 cal. bc, when the village encompassed c. 8 ha and large
numbers of gazelle were hunted for meat alongside domestic crop cultivation and caprine hus-
bandry (Legge and Rowley-Conwy, 2000). The crops grown comprise five domesticated cereals
­ rye, einkorn, emmer, bread wheat, two- and six-row barley ­ and at least three pulses ­ lentils,
peas, vetches (De Moulins, 1997). Since both cereals and pulses were major crops, it has been
surmised that crop rotation was practised to replenish the soil nutrients (De Moulins, 1997).
Cultivation on the Euphrates floodplain has been dismissed by archaeobotanists working on the
site since early cereals are believed to have been autumn-germinating (Hillman, 2000; Jones et al.,
2013; Miller, 1987) and thus the spring floods caused by snow melt would have washed away the
crops before harvest. Wadi sides, breaks of slope and wadi bottoms not prone to flooding could
have offered areas for cultivation with enhanced soil moisture but reduced risk of flood damage (cf.
Hillman, 2000). On the other hand, relatively high precipitation levels in the Early Neolithic sug-
gested by the Soreq Cave speleothem data (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997) may have broadened poten-
tial cultivation zones beyond these restricted areas and into the steppe. Weed seeds recovered in the
archaeobotanical assemblage are associated with cultivation on the drier steppe (De Moulins,
1997), although small-seeded legumes may have been derived from burning of dung.
In period 2B (c. 7400 to 6200 cal. bc) the site grew to c. 16 ha, with an estimated population of
5000 to 6000 people (Moore, 2000), although it has been argued that these figures have to be
regarded as maximum limits, since shifting of the settlement cannot be excluded (Hole, 2000).
Focus shifted from the hunting of gazelle to the adoption of large-scale herding of sheep and goats
and the first significant exploitation of cattle (Legge and Rowley-Conwy, 2000). An increase in
domesticated cereals and high proportions of weed seeds attest to the continued importance of crop
cultivation (De Moulins, 1997). Pottery use began at the end of this period. Period 2C (c. 6200 to
6000 cal. bc) is the beginning of the Pottery Neolithic and saw the continuation of caprine
14 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)
exploitation, with cattle and pig husbandry becoming more important. The ubiquity of legumes
decreased in this period and it has been tentatively suggested that manure may have been used to
maintain soil fertility, replacing the role of the small-seeded legumes in rotation with cereals (De
Moulins, 1997). The nature of settlement also changed, with buildings spaced further apart and pits
dug between them (Moore, 2000). The site contracted to c. 8 ha and at the end of this period was
abandoned.
`Ain Ghazal is located in modern Jordan (Figure 5). It is situated immediately adjacent to the
Wadi Zarqa, which would have been a permanent stream during the site's occupation, in a transi-
tion zone between oak woodland and open steppe desert (Simmons et al., 1988). Today the site
receives c. 250 mm of annual rainfall, placing it in an area vulnerable to fluctuations in rainfall.
Analysis of wood charcoal found at the site has indicated the presence of deciduous oak woodland
in the surroundings, which requires >300 mm rainfall per year and this has been used to infer that
rainfall must have been at least 100 mm higher during the PPN (Neef, 2004). Again, the barley
15N values are plotted against a range of rainfall values between 175 and 450 mm higher than
today's rainfall (cf. Bar-Matthews et al., 1997).
`Ain Ghazal was occupied for over 2000 years, from c. 8500 to 5500 cal. bc (Rollefson, 2015).
The archaeobotanical samples included in this study comprise two-row hulled barley grain (n = 9)
and pulse seed (n = 7) samples, spanning the site's occupation during the Middle and Late PPNB
(MPPNB and LPPNB; 8500­6900 cal. bc), which coincides with the Period 2A and 2B Abu
Hureyra samples. In the MPPNB, herded sheep and goat accounted for the majority of the faunal
assemblage, but there is evidence that a wide variety of wild animals were also hunted (Von den
Driesch and Wodtke, 1997; Wasse, 2002). Domesticated cereals and a relatively high proportion of
pulses were found in the archaeobotanical assemblage, with domestic two-row hulled barley,
emmer and einkorn wheat, peas, lentils and chickpeas found in order of decreasing frequency
(Neef, 1997). Sickle blades accounted for nearly 10% of the chipped stone tool inventory (Rollefson
and Simmons, 1988), suggesting the economic importance of crop cultivation. By the beginning of
the Late PPNB the site was c. 4­5 ha, but expanded to around twice that size by c. 7000 cal. bc
(Köhler-Rollefson and Rollefson, 1990).
`Ain Ghazal, unlike many sites in the Levant that were abandoned at the end of the PPNB,
was occupied into the Yarmoukian phase of the Pottery Neolithic. Nevertheless, from the begin-
ning of the PPNC, the variety of faunal species exploited by the inhabitants of `Ain Ghazal
decreased significantly and it has been proposed that this was related to degradation of the sur-
rounding landscape by removal of the natural vegetation through cultivation, grazing and defor-
estation (Köhler-Rollefson, 1988), exacerbated by climatic deterioration in c. 6200-6000 cal. BC
(Bar-Matthews et al., 1999). Although the archaeobotanical samples in this study date to the
Middle and Late PPNB, when evidence for landscape degradation is not as advanced as that in
the later PPNC, there is the possibility that vegetation and accompanying soil degradation would
have impacted the methods of cultivation, or indeed led to adaptations in order to redress the
negative impacts of soil erosion on productivity.
To summarize, 15N values of hulled barley grain and pulse seed samples from the Early
Neolithic sites of Abu Hureyra and `Ain Ghazal in the eastern Mediterranean were determined.
These derive from both storage and refuse contexts spanning the Middle to Late PPNB and into the
early PN, when crop cultivation was likely a mainstay of subsistence but reliance on hunting
changed through time. Situated in areas where fluctuations in rainfall could have presented a risk
to the success of crop cultivation, these sites are a good representation of cultivation in a relatively
dry region. By placing the crop isotope determinations of barley from these archaeological sites in
the framework of our modern study, we hope to constrain interpretation of cultivation practices, in
Styring et al. 15
particular water management (considered in Wallace et al., 2015) and manuring, and thus reveal
more about the nature and intensity of early agriculture.
Isotopic composition of fauna and crops from Abu Hureyra and
`Ain Ghazal
The 15N values of archaeological barley grain and pulse seed samples are given in Supplementary
Table 2, available online, and their corresponding 13C and13C values, as well as the 13Cair
values
used to calculate the 13C values, can be found in Wallace et al. (2015). As explained in the section
`Crop carbon isotope values', it is common practice to convert plant 13C values to 13C values, to
allow comparison between time periods when atmospheric CO2
differed in its isotopic
composition.
The determined barley grain 13C values from Abu Hureyra are relatively varied (15.3­18.7;
Figure 6), with samples falling predominantly in the moderate- to poorly watered band, with the
exception of a well-watered outlier with 13C = 18.7 (Wallace et al., 2015). The large variation
suggests that barley was cultivated on soils receiving variable water inputs and/or with varying
water retention capacity. Although the crop isotope results cannot preclude floodplain cultivation
(the relatively high 15N values could result from loss of 15N-depleted nitrogen via denitrification
as a result of seasonal flooding), given the risk posed to crops by spring floods, this variation in
water status is more likely to be due to variation in the water retention of soils on the steppe or wadi
sides. However, since the samples span the site's occupation, this variation could also be due to
differences in annual rainfall over time (Wallace et al., 2015). The range in barley 13C values at
Abu Hureyra (3.5) is similar to that of the barley grown in rainfed fields in south Morocco
(3.2; Figure 6), suggesting that variation could indeed have been due to such natural differences
in the water retention of soils in the vicinity of the site.
The 15N values of barley grains from Abu Hureyra are relatively high, ranging from 6.4 to
10.4 (Figure 6). Without faunal 15N data it is not possible to estimate the 15N values of unman-
aged plants in this region, but by plotting the Abu Hureyra barley 15N values against the natural
log scale of the range of estimated past annual rainfall, it is possible to estimate the effect of aridity
to some extent (Figure 7). The values plot within the high band of manuring at all annual rainfall
values. There is no clear chronological difference in the 15N values and the low sample number
precludes any statistical analysis. Some degree of manure application therefore cannot be excluded
at Abu Hureyra during the PPNB and PN. However, it is possible that the relatively high crop 15N
values were due to cultivation in soils that experienced temporary waterlogging and thus denitrifi-
cation, such as on floodplains and wadi slopes (cf. Hartman and Danin, 2010). More work is
needed to characterize crop growing conditions in such temporarily waterlogged soils and this
should incorporate a multi-isotope approach, alongside weed ecological data, in order to distin-
guish different potential contributions to elevated crop 15N values (e.g. manuring and/or seasonal
waterlogging).
The 15N values of these barley grains dating to the PPNB and PN are not significantly lower
than those of individual rye grains (8.7­11.1; p = 0.113) dating to the Epipalaeolithic (deter-
mined by Araus et al., 2014), despite the >1500 year gap between their deposition. The authors
have suggested that the high 15N values of these rye grains are due to them growing on `dump-
heaps', which likely had higher 15N values than the surrounding soils. The climate is also believed
to have been drier than the succeeding PPN (Bar-Matthews et al., 1997). This demonstrates that if
decreasing fertility of soils in the wider region was leading to decreasing crop 15N over time (cf.
Araus et al., 2014), soil conditions were being managed in some way at Abu Hureyra in the PPNB,
maintaining higher crop 15N values than those expected for unmanaged plants.
16 The Anthropocene Review 3(1)
The 13C and 15N values of bone collagen from 36 goats, 4 sheep and 10 caprines from `Ain
Ghazal (MPPNB to PPNC) have been determined by Miller (2012) and Makarewicz (2007). The
13C values range from -20.7 to -16.2 and the 15N values range from 6.8 to 10.8, with
a mean of 8.9. There was no statistical difference in 15N values between the chronological
phases of the PPNB, but Miller observed that both the 13C and 15N values of caprines from the
PPNC (n = 9) were higher than the PPNB. She interprets this as evidence for greater consumption
of C4
plants growing in more arid environments (Miller, 2012). The inferred mean unmanaged
plant 15N value estimated from the faunal bone collagen is 4.9. This can be compared with the
15N values of the barley grains in this study and also to the regression line of 15N against natural
log transformed rainfall determined from the Hartman and Danin (2010) study (Figure 7). The fact
that the estimated faunal plant diet 15N value plots in the medium band of manuring suggests that
the herbivores were consuming plants growing in areas of the landscape where loss of N was
enhanced, perhaps in seasonally wet stream beds where moisture levels and therefore plants remain
into the summer months (Hartman and Danin, 2010). This highlights the benefit of considering
herbivore bone collagen 15N values in relation to the regression of plant 15N values and rainfall
in order to identify potential feeding strategies that could bias the unmanaged plant 15N baseline
value.
There is very little variation in the 13C values of barley grain samples from `Ain Ghazal (16.7­
17.3; Figure 6; Wallace et al., 2015). This range is as tight as that determined in modern barley
grown under the same water conditions (Wallace et al., 2013), suggesting that farmers at `Ain
Ghazal had strict control over water availability, possibly through the use of the spring and flood-
plains close to the site. Their 13C values fall into the moderately watered band, again consistent
with a degree of intentional watering to improve their water status. The floodplain at `Ain Ghazal
is very limited in extent and thus unlikely to have supported enough crop cultivation to provide the

population of the 5­10 ha settlement. It seems therefore that well-watered conditions were main-
tained elsewhere, possibly on terraced fields close to the spring. The 15N values of barley grains
from `Ain Ghazal are relatively low, ranging from 1.2 to 5.6 (Figure 6). The barley 15N val-
ues are similar to or lower than the unmanaged plant 15N baseline estimated from the faunal 15N
data (4.9), suggesting that the barley was growing in soil with a lower 15N value than plants
consumed by herbivores. When the `Ain Ghazal barley samples are plotted against the natural log
scale of the range of estimated past annual rainfall, they plot within the low-medium bands of
manuring (Figure 7), implying that any manuring input was minimal.
The 13C and 15N values of pulses from `Ain Ghazal (n = 7) have also been determined
(Supplementary Table 2, available online). The 13C values are relatively varied and fall within the
moderate- to poorly watered band (Wallace et al., 2015). The greater variation in pulse 13C values
compared with barley could be because pulses tend to be more sensitive than cereals to water short-
ages during seed filling (Brouwer et al., 1989), so variation in water availability during this growth
period would result in greater variation in pulse compared with barley 13C values. The pulse 15N
values range from 0.9 to 2.3, which is close to but slightly higher than the 15N value of
atmospheric-N (Yoneyama et al., 1986), and this indicates that they indeed received the majority
of their N from N-fixation. The slight elevation of pulse seed 15N values over that of atmospheric-
N could indicate some uptake of soil-N, which is more favourable when the concentration of soil
inorganic-N is high (e.g. in manured soils; Streeter and Wong, 1988; Waterer and Vessey, 1993).
Thus we see evidence for two different strategies of crop cultivation in the PPNB and early PN,
although greater numbers of crop samples for isotope analysis would be needed to characterize
these more fully. At Abu Hureyra, barley was grown in rainfed fields whose soils varied in their
water-holding capacity, with organic matter levels equivalent to high manuring rates, potentially

relating to dung from the domestic sheep and goats herded in the vicinity of the site. At `Ain
Ghazal, farmers seemed to have had strict control over the water status of their barley, possibly
through watering their crops from the spring. There is no evidence for intensive manuring at the
site, possibly because sheep and goats were herded away from the settlement (cf. Köhler-Rollefson
and Rollefson, 1990), or periodic grazing of sheep and goats on arable fields did not result in high
levels of manuring (cf. Bogaard and Isaakidou, 2010). The relatively high frequency of pulses
recovered from the site could also reflect the practice of cereal­pulse rotation, which would have
helped to replenish soil nutrients.
Conclusions
Although a relatively small modern pilot study, the 15N values of barley grains growing in fields in
present-day Morocco have provided a framework for reconstructing past farming practices, in areas
where a (semi-)arid environment complicates the manuring 15N signal. We use the regression line
established by Hartman and Danin (2010) between unmanaged annual plant 15N values and the natu-
ral log of annual rainfall to assess the relative importance of manuring at two early farming sites.
Taken together, the material evidence from archaeological sites and crop isotope values can constrain
scenarios of early farming practice. For example, low crop 15N values preclude intensive manuring
at `Ain Ghazal, which is consistent with the theory that the high frequency of pulses at the site is
linked to maintenance of soil fertility. By contrast, the relatively high 15N values of barley from Abu
Hureyra cannot exclude the possibility of manuring as a means of maintaining soil fertility, although
it is possible that cultivation of temporarily waterlogged soils (wadi bottoms and slopes) contributed
to these high 15N values. In both situations, however, the importance of manuring inferred from crop
15N values would have been overestimated using the manuring level bands established for temperate
Europe, rather than the framework developed here. This study provides the basis upon which to carry
out further 15N value determinations of modern cereal grains at other locations ­ and particularly on
floodplains ­ to refine this framework, further constraining interpretations of possible farming
regimes. The emerging evidence for crop growing conditions and early farming practices in western
Asia presented here, as in Neolithic regimes in Europe (e.g. Bogaard et al., 2013), suggests that the
flexibility of the early farming `package' of cereals, pulses and livestock enabled communities to
develop contrasting strategies to adapt to different ecological and social settings.
