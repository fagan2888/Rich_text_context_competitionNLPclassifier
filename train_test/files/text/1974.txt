OBJECTIVE--This study examined the association between objectively measured sedentary
activity and metabolic syndrome among older adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS--Data were from 1,367 men and women, aged
$60 years who participated in the 2003­2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES). Sedentary time during waking hours was measured by an accelerometer
(,100 counts per minute). A sedentary bout was defined as a period of time .5 min. A sedentary
break was defined as an interruption in sedentary time ($100 counts per minute). Metabolic
syndrome was defined according to the Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III criteria.
RESULTS--On average, people spent 9.5 h (65% of wear time) as sedentary. Compared with
people without metabolic syndrome, people with metabolic syndrome spent a greater percentage
of time as sedentary (67.3 vs. 62.2%), had longer average sedentary bouts (17.7 vs. 16.7 min),
had lower intensity during sedentary time (14.8 vs. 15.8 average counts per minute), and had
fewer sedentary breaks (82.3 vs. 86.7), adjusted for age and sex (all P , 0.01). A higher per-
centage of time sedentary and fewer sedentary breaks were associated with a significantly greater
likelihood of metabolic syndrome after adjustment for age, sex, ethnicity, education, alcohol
consumption, smoking, BMI, diabetes, heart disease, and physical activity. The association between
intensity during sedentary time and metabolic syndrome was borderline significant.
CONCLUSIONS--The proportion of sedentary time was strongly related to metabolic risk,
independent of physical activity. Current results suggest older people may benefit from reducing
total sedentary time and avoiding prolonged periods of sedentary time by increasing the number
of breaks during sedentary time.

Metabolic syndrome has been es-
tablished as a public health con-
cern in the U.S. Thirty-four
percent of adults in the U.S. meet the
criteria for metabolic syndrome, with
men and women over 60 years of age
even more likely to have metabolic syn-
drome (1). Metabolic syndrome is most
commonly defined according to the Na-
tional Cholesterol Education Program's
Adult Treatment Panel (NCEP ATP) III
criteria as three or more of the following
conditions: abdominal obesity, high tri-
glycerides, low HDL cholesterol, hyper-
tension, and hyperglycemia (2). People
with metabolic syndrome have an in-
creased risk to develop health problems
such as heart disease, diabetes, and stroke
(3­5). Because of its high prevalence and
significant health consequences, it is im-
portant to understand the risk factors of
metabolic syndrome.
Physical inactivity (6,7), often de-
fined as the lack of moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity, and sedentary behavior
(8,9) have been shown to be important
risk factors of metabolic syndrome. These
studies, however, are limited by the use of
self-reported physical activity data. Previ-
ous studies with objective physical activ-
ity data by accelerometry have shown that
physical inactivity is associated with met-
abolic risk factors in adults (10). However
most studies focused on risk associated
with lack of physical activity rather than
sedentary time. Sedentary behavior is de-
fined as engaging in activities at the rest-
ing level of energy expenditure and
includes activities such as sleeping, sit-
ting, lying down, playing on the com-
puter, and watching television (11).
Since sedentary behavior is not defined
as the lack of moderate-to-vigorous phys-
ical activity, it is important to study it sep-
arately from light, moderate, or vigorous
activity. Further, sedentary behavior is in-
dependently associated with health out-
comes (11,12).
Few studies have used accelerometry
to examine the role of sedentary activities
on metabolic risk (13,14). These studies
have shown that an increase in the dura-
tion and percentage of time spent in sed-
entary behavior are associated with an
increase in metabolic risk in adults
(13,14), while an increase in breaks taken
from sedentary behavior is associated
with a decrease in metabolic risk (13). It
seems, therefore, that in addition to total
time spent in sedentary behavior, the pro-
portion and distribution of sedentary
time within the day are independently
associated with health outcomes. To our
knowledge, there are no studies specifi-
cally among older adults that examined
the association between objectively mea-
sured sedentary activity and metabolic
syndrome. This is a particularly impor-
tant research question as the prevalence
of metabolic alterations is higher in older
persons (1), and the amount of sedentary
time increases with age; people aged 60
years and older spend more than 8 h per
day in sedentary behaviors (15).
The aim of this study was to examine
the associations of specific sedentary activ-
ity parameters with metabolic syndrome

using nationally representative National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) data (16) of adults 60 years of
age and older living in the U.S.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS--This study used cross-
sectional data from participants of the
2003­2004 and 2005­2006 NHANES
study conducted in the U.S. NHANES
provides a nationally representative sam-
ple with a stratified, multistage design.
The three main aspects to the survey are
an interview given by a trained in-
terviewer in the participants' home, a
medical exam completed at a mobile ex-
amination center, and laboratory tests.
The National Center for Health Statistics
Ethics Review Board approved the survey
protocols, and informed consent was ob-
tained for all subjects.
There were 14,584 people aged 6
years and older who participated in the
accelerometer study in NHANES. The
12,772 participants had at least 1 valid
day of accelerometry data, which was
defined as 10 or more hours of wear
time (17). For the current study, we in-
cluded participants 60 years of age and
older (n = 2,656) and who had 4 or
more valid days of accelerometer wear
time (n = 2,401). Only participants sched-
uled for a morning blood draw had
triglyceride and plasma glucose data be-
cause these samples were obtained after
an overnight fast, bringing the final sam-
ple size to 1,367 (709 men and 658
women).
Measures
Accelerometry. Activity was assessed
using the ActiGraph AM-7164 acceler-
ometer (ActiGraph, Fort Walton Beach,
FL). The monitor was attached to a belt
that strapped around the waist. Each par-
ticipant was instructed to wear the acceler-
ometer over their right hip. Participants
were instructed to wear the monitor for
seven consecutive days and to remove the
monitor before going to bed and during
showers, bathing, swimming, or other
water activities. The monitors were re-
turned by mail to the NHANES contractor
where the data were downloaded, and the
monitors were checked for calibration.
The uniaxial ActiGraph measures and
records vertical acceleration as "counts"
per minute, an arbitrary intensity indica-
tor of the movements of each minute.
Nonwear time was defined as intervals
of at least 60 consecutive minutes of
0 counts with allowance for up to 2 min
of counts between 0 and 100. Active min-
utes were defined as $100 counts per
minute and sedentary minutes as counts
,100 during wear time (18). A sedentary
bout was defined as a period of time .5
min when count values fell into the
sedentary range with only 1 allowable
minute outside the sedentary range. A
sedentary break was defined as an inter-
ruption in sedentary time when the count
value exceeded 99 per minute. To identify
specific sedentary activity parameters,
five variables of interest were included
in this study: 1) duration of valid seden-
tary time (hours); 2) proportion of total
valid wear time that was sedentary time;
3) average duration of a sedentary bout;
4) average intensity during sedentary
time, which is used as a quantitative in-
dicator of stillness during sedentary time
and is defined by the average count value
during sedentary time; and 5) number of
breaks in sedentary time. These five sed-
entary variables were averaged for one day
and used as continuous variables. Sex-
specific quartiles were also created for
each variable.
Metabolic syndrome. Metabolic syn-
drome was defined according to the ATP
III guidelines as meeting three or more of
the following criteria: 1) waist circumfer-
ence $102 cm for men and $88 cm for
women; 2) serum triglyceride level of
$150 mg/dL; 3) HDL cholesterol level
,40 mg/dL for men and ,50 mg/dL
for women; 4) fasting glucose level
$100 mg/dL or use of antidiabetic med-
ications (insulin or oral agents); or 5) sys-
tolic blood pressure $85 mmHg and/or
diastolic blood pressure $130 mmHg, or
use of antihypertensive medications (2).
Up to four blood pressure reading were
taken on participants. To determine
blood pressure status, the last two blood
pressure readings were averaged for par-
ticipants that had three or four measure-
ments. If participants only had two blood
pressure readings, the last reading was
used in the analysis. If participants had
only one blood pressure reading, that
reading was used in the analysis. Mea-
surements with a systolic reading of zero
were considered missing. According to
the guidelines, medications for elevated
triglycerides and reduced HDL choles-
terol (fibrates and nicotinic acid) should
be taken into account (2). This specific
information, however, was not available
in NHANES. People with one or two
missing metabolic syndrome criteria
who had three positive metabolic syn-
drome criteria were grouped in the
metabolic syndrome group. Similarly,
people with one or two missing metabolic
syndrome criteria who had three negative
metabolic syndrome criteria were grouped
in the nonmetabolic syndrome group.
Covariates. Covariates included age, sex,
self-reported race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
other), education (less than high school,
high school or general equivalency di-
ploma, more than high school), alcohol
consumption (never, former, current
drinker, missing), smoking (never, for-
mer, current), BMI (kg/m2), self-reported
diabetes and heart disease, and physical
activity (moderate-to-vigorous physical
activity [minutes .2,020 counts] and av-
erage accelerometer count during active
minutes).
Statistical analysis
Data were analyzed using SAS 9.2 Software
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC) and Sudaan 10.0
(RTI International, Research Triangle Park,
NC) to account for the complex survey
design and incorporate the sample
weights. Sample weights were recalculated
from the NHANES mobile examination
center weights to reflect the "nonresponse"
related to not having complete accelerom-
eter data. Reweighting was conducted
within age (60­69 years, 70­79 years,
and 80+ years), race/ethnicity (non-
Hispanic whites, non-Hispanic blacks,
and Mexican Americans), and gender
strata. Resulting sample weights were
used for all analyses. The t tests for con-
tinuous variables and x2 tests for categor-
ical variables were used to examine the
differences in characteristics between
people with and without metabolic syn-
drome. Analysis of variance was con-
ducted to examine the association between
sedentary variables and the metabolic
syndrome components. Adjusted means
and standard errors adjusted for sex and
age are presented. Logistic regression anal-
yses were performed to examine the asso-
ciations between the sedentary variables
(in quartiles) and metabolic syndrome.
Four models were fitted; model 1 adjusted
for sex and age. Model 2 was additionally
adjusted for education, race/ethnicity, al-
cohol consumption, smoking status, and
BMI. Model 3 additionally adjusted for
diabetes, heart disease, and physical
activity by the average counts during ac-
tive time was added to model 4. Interac-
tions between sex, age, race/ethnicity,
and all sedentary variables were tested
but were found to be nonsignificant at
a = 0.05.

Sedentary activity and metabolic syndrome
RESULTS--Out of the 1,367 people in
the total analyzed sample, 665 (48.6%)
participants met the criteria for having
metabolic syndrome. As shown in Table 1,
participants with metabolic syndrome were
more often women (P , 0.01), had a lower
educational level (P , 0.01), were more
often nondrinkers (P , 0.01), had a higher
BMI (P , 0.001), had a higher prevalence
of diabetes and heart disease, spent less
time in the moderate-to-vigorous activity
range, and had a lower average accelerom-
etry count during active minutes in the
day (P , 0.01).
On average, people spent 9.5 h (65%
of wear time) as sedentary. The correla-
tion between total sedentary time and
percent sedentary time was high (corre-
lation coefficient 0.75); the correlation
between total sedentary time with average
length of a sedentary bout, intensity
during sedentary time, and number of
sedentary breaks was lower (correlation
coefficients 0.55, 20.53, and 0.09, re-
spectively). Table 2 shows the age- and
sex-adjusted means of the five sedentary
variables according to each metabolic
syndrome component and metabolic syn-
drome. Participants with a large waist cir-
cumference, low HDL cholesterol, high
triglycerides, and metabolic syndrome
had a higher percentage of sedentary
time out of total wear time, a longer aver-
age sedentary bout, a lower average in-
tensity during sedentary time (not
statistically significant for HDL), and
fewer breaks in sedentary time (all P ,
0.05) after adjusting for age and sex.
Figure 1 shows the age- and sex-
adjusted mean values of the five sedentary
variables according to the number of met-
abolic syndrome criteria. A significant
positive trend with the number of meta-
bolic syndrome criteria was found for the
duration and percentage of sedentary
time and the average length of a sedentary
bout (all P , 0.01). The intensity during
sedentary time and the number of breaks
in sedentary time had a significant nega-
tive trend with the number of metabolic
syndrome criteria (all P , 0.01).
The relationship between each sed-
entary variable and metabolic syndrome
is presented in Table 3. Model 1, adjusted
for age and sex, shows the greater likeli-
hood of having metabolic syndrome in
highest quartiles of sedentary time dura-
tion, percent sedentary time, and average
length of a sedentary bout. Further, com-
pared with the highest quartile, the lowest
quartile of the intensity during sedentary
time and the number of sedentary breaks
was associated with an increased likeli-
hood of metabolic syndrome. Model 2
was additionally adjusted for ethnicity, al-
cohol consumption, smoking, and BMI,
and model 3 was additionally adjusted
for diabetes and heart disease. In model
3, a higher percentage of sedentary time
out of total wear time (quartile 2: odds
ratio [OR] 1.52 [95% CI 1.04­2.21];
quartile 3: 1.59 [1.02­2.49]; quartile 4:
1.61 [1.05­2.48]) and fewer sedentary
breaks (quartile 3: 1.50 [1.02­2.21])
were related to a significantly increased
likelihood of metabolic syndrome. Per-
centage sedentary time and sedentary
breaks remained statistically significant
after additional adjustment for physical
activity in model 4. A higher intensity
during sedentary time was related to
an increased likelihood of metabolic

syndrome in model 2 (quartile 4: 1.66
[1.03­2.67]) but was no longer statisti-
cally significant in models 3 and 4 (1.59
[0.96­2.62]), although the test for trend
over the intensity categories remained sta-
tistically significant (P = 0.05). In addi-
tional analysis we adjusted for minutes
of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity
in model 4 instead of average counts per
minute during active time, which did not
change our results. Further, the relation
between the intensity during sedentary
time and sedentary breaks with metabolic
syndrome did not change after adjust-
ment for total sedentary time (data not
shown).
CONCLUSIONS--Using NHANES
data, the relationship between objectively
measured sedentary time and metabolic
syndrome was examined in a representa-
tive sample of older adults living in the
U.S. Compared with people without met-
abolic syndrome, people with metabolic
syndrome spent more hours and a greater
percentage of their wear time as seden-
tary. Further, people with metabolic syn-
drome had a longer average sedentary
bout, a lower intensity during sedentary
time, and fewer breaks in sedentary time. A
higher percentage of total wear time spent
as sedentary time was associated with a
significantly greater likelihood of metabolic
syndrome even after adjustment for phys-
ical activity. Additionally, fewer sedentary
breaks were associated with a higher likeli-
hood of metabolic syndrome, and a signif-
icant trend was found for intensity during
sedentary time where the likelihood of
metabolic syndrome increased with a de-
crease in intensity.
Previous research with self-reported
data is consistent with the findings in this
study on the association between time
spent in sedentary behaviors and meta-
bolic syndrome. Self-reported sedentary
behavior, such as television viewing time,
has been positively associated with met-
abolic risk factors and metabolic syn-
drome (8,9,19,20). Several studies with
objectively measured sedentary data
have shown that the number of hours of
sedentary time is related to metabolic risk
factors (13,14,21). A study among Aus-
tralian adults found that sedentary time
was positively associated with metabolic
syndrome (14). Other studies found that
physical activity, but not sedentary time,
predicts metabolic risk (21) and insulin
resistance (22).
Using a large nationally representa-
tive sample of older adults, our study was
the first to explore different parameters of
objectively measured sedentary behavior
such as the average length of a sedentary
bout; the intensity during sedentary time,
which is a quantitative indicator of still-
ness; and sedentary breaks with metabolic
risk in older adults. One previous study of
adults (mean age 53.4 years) has been
conducted on breaks in sedentary time
and metabolic syndrome and corrobo-
rates our findings that fewer breaks in
sedentary time were significantly associ-
ated with a larger waist, higher triglycer-
ide levels, and higher 2-h glucose levels
(13). The results of our study suggest that
not only is total sedentary time an impor-
tant health risk factor, but patterns (i.e.,
the way sedentary time is accumulated) of
sedentary behaviors might be important
risk factors as well.
An important strength of our study
is that sedentary behavior was measured
objectively by accelerometry, but accel-
erometers are not sensitive to detect
all activities such as biking, standing,
and upper-body movement. The cross-
sectional design of this study limits
inference about the direction of causal-
ity between the sedentary variables and
metabolic risk. Future studies should
prospectively study the association be-
tween sedentary behavior and metabolic
syndrome.
Current findings suggest that not only
is it important to reduce sedentary time
among older adults, but minimizing pro-
longed periods of uninterrupted sedentary

Sedentary activity and metabolic syndrome
time and increasing sporadic movements
during sedentary time may also be pro-
tective. In practice, this may be achieved
by taking brief activity breaks to disrupt
prolonged periods of sitting or by increas-
ing movements while sitting. These min-
imal changes may result in increases in
daily energy expenditure (23) or could
provide direct effects on metabolic regula-
tion (24).
In summary, the proportion of sed-
entary time was strongly related to met-
abolic risk, independent of physical
activity. Time spent in sedentary behavior
increases with age (15). Older adults may
be at a higher risk of developing metabolic
syndrome based on this age-related in-
crease of time spent in sedentary behav-
iors. This was the first study to examine
multiple sedentary parameters including
sedentary intensity and sedentary breaks
in relation to metabolic syndrome, and
future studies should focus on these spe-
cific variables to corroborate our results.

Current results, though cross-sectional in
nature, suggest that potential behavioral
interventions for the prevention of meta-
bolic syndrome in older adults might in-
clude the promotion of physical activity
as well as reduction in total sedentary
time and disruption of prolonged seden-
tary bouts.
