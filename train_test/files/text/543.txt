ABSTRACT
Research suggests that children of prisoners have an increased risk for behavioural
and emotional problems. However, in a resilience approach, one should expect
heterogeneous outcomes and thus apply a contextualized perspective. As this is
rarely acknowledged in empirical research, the present study sought to fill this gap
using data from the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing study on 801 children
of imprisoned fathers. We explored the extent to which cumulative family risks
measured during the first year of life (e.g., poverty and mental health problems)
predicted behavioural outcomes at age 9 and whether potentially protective
aspects of family functioning moderated the impact of these risk factors.
Cumulative risk significantly predicted behavioural outcomes, but the associations
were weak. No strong evidence of moderation was found. At low risk, mother­child
closeness moderated behavioural outcomes. There was also some evidence of
moderation by accumulated protective factors. Potential implications for policy
and practice and challenges for further research are discussed.

Introduction
Parental imprisonment is a common phenomenon. In the USA, the nation with
the highest rate of imprisonment in the world, 2.3% of children have an impris-
oned parent at any one time (Glaze & Maruschak, 2008). African-American and
socially excluded families are disproportionately affected (Wildeman, 2009).
Much has been written about the negative impact of imprisonment on children,
with the link to filial anti-social behaviour among the most robust associations
after controlling for other factors (e.g., Murray, Farrington, & Sekol, 2012).

However,prisoners'childrenarenotahomogenousgroupandtherearemany
individual and environmental factors that may influence how they experience
parental imprisonment. For example, a qualitative study by Lanskey et al. (2014)
implicated changes to home and school environments, perceptions of the past
and future and ability to adapt to the difficulties presented by paternal imprison-
ment as factors influencing children's well-being (e.g., Lanskey, Lösel, Markson, &
Souza, 2014), suggesting that such factors need to be taken into account when
striving to understand developmental processes (Bronfenbrenner, 1979). Using
developmental psychopathology as the conceptual framework and adopting a
resilience perspective, we argue that the impact of paternal imprisonment on
children should be studied using a contextualized approach. Such research has
implications for how to effectively support the positive adaptation of children
living with this type of adversity.
Developmental psychopathology proposes an"organizational view of devel-
opment in which multiple factors, or levels of a given factor, are considered in
the context of one another, rather than in isolation"(Blandon, Calkins, Grimm,
Keane, & O'Brien, 2010, p. 737). Accordingly, the context is a crucially important
consideration (Cummings, Davies, & Campbell, 2000; Motti-Stefanidi, Asendorpf,
& Masten, 2012; Sameroff, 2000). Resilience is a complex meta-theoretical con-
struct (e.g., Cicchetti, 2010; Luthar, Cicchetti, & Becker, 2000; Masten, 2007;
Rutter, 2012) and relates to "dynamic processes of `psychological functioning'
that foster greater positive and reduced negative outcomes in the face of relative
adversity, both at the present time and in the future" (Cummings et al., 2000,
p. 146). Resilience is influenced by dynamic, multi-level, social, psychological and
biological processes that can vary across individuals, problem types, time and
circumstances (Cicchetti, 2010; Lösel & Farrington, 2012; Masten, 2007; Rutter,
2012). Resilience has been defined and operationalized in different ways (e.g.,
Rutter, 1993). In the current study, we defined resilience as the absence of prob-
lems in a high-risk sample (Rutter, 1990).
Multiple contextual risk factors can have a negative influence on children's
development (Flouri, 2008), including low parental educational achievement,
parental mental illness, poverty, neighbourhood factors and parental substance
abuse (Cummings et al., 2000; Luthar, 1999; Masten & Powell, 2003; Shaw, Cris,
Schonberg, & Beck, 2004; Werner & Smith, 1992). Often prisoners' families are
living with additional stressors that exacerbate the negative experience of pater-
nal imprisonment (e.g., Geller, Garfinkel, Cooper, & Mincy, 2009).They are likely
to be economically deprived, socially excluded and lacking support. They may
also be vulnerable to stigmatization as a result of the imprisonment. For these
reasons, prisoners' children are a unique at-risk group. These risk factors may
affect development indirectly through the parents' well-being and parenting
behaviour (Luthar, 1999) or directly through bullying and victimization. Risk
factors have been shown to have a cumulative, dose­response relationship to
children's behavioural outcomes (Atzaba-Poria, Pike, & Deater-Deckard, 2004;
EUROPEAN JOURNAL OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY 327
Deater-Deckard, Dodge, Bates, & Pettit, 1998; Van der Laan,Veenstra, Bogaerts,
Verhulst, & Ormel, 2010) although cumulative contextual risk is an under-re-
searched topic and has been the focus of conceptual debate (Flouri, 2008; Lösel
& Bender, 2003).
Family relationships also have a significant impact on children's develop-
ment. Lamb (2012) identified the relationships between children and parents/
significant others and between parents/significant others as the most impor-
tant social influences and attachment theory provides a theoretical explanation
for their significance (e.g., Bowlby, 1953). Responsive and supportive parent-
ing, accepting family environments and close parent­child relationships have
been associated with behavioural competence (Collins, Harris, & Susman, 1995;
Masten et al., 1999). Lamb (2012) noted that the security associated with attach-
ment relationships may mediate the effect of parent­child relationships on child
adjustment. Parental relationship conflict and harmony may affect children's
emotional security and adjustment (e.g., Cummings et al., 2000).
Accordingly, positive and supportive family relationships can have protective
or buffering effects for children in contexts of parental divorce, abuse, depriva-
tion and cumulative stress (e.g., Masten & Powell, 2003; Masten & Shaffer, 2006;
Neighbors, Forehand, & McVicar, 1993; Osborn, 1990; Pianta, Egeland, & Sroufe,
1990). This suggests that they are important for the development of resilience
(Garmezy, 1985; Lösel & Bender, 2003). For example, good relationships between
parents and children are associated with positive child behavioural outcomes
in high-risk environments (e.g., Cummings et al., 2000). Similarly, emotionally
responsive caregiving has been shown to moderate the impact of social and
economic deprivation, high stress and abusive family relationships on broadly
defined measures of positive behavioural, social and emotional functioning
(Egeland, Carlson, & Sroufe, 1993).
The buffering effects of family variables have been found to vary by level of
risk. For example, marital relationship quality protected against the emergence
of antisocial behaviour in boys only in low risk conditions (Vanderbilt-Adriance
& Shaw, 2008). Supportive family relationships moderated the association
between exposure to violence, poverty and everyday stressors and internaliz-
ing behaviour for African-American children at low but not high levels of risk
(Li, Nussbaum, & Maryse, 2007). This pattern was termed "overwhelming-risk"
by Li et al. (p. 30) after Luthar, Cicchetti, and Becker's (2000)"protective-reactive"
(p. 547) classification of moderation effects because protective influences were
overwhelmed by risk factors. This concept is important insofar as it relativizes
too optimistic views on resilience in cases where numerous stressors accumulate
and leave not much"space"for protective influences (Lösel & Bender, 2003).
Theory and empirical evidence on developmental psychopathology, resil-
ience and family relationships suggest that paternal imprisonment may be
experienced by children in nuanced ways but prisoners' children have rarely
been studied from that perspective.There have been no published prospective
328  L. MARKSON ET AL.
longitudinal studies on the impact of cumulative family risks and protective
factors on behavioural outcomes with a specific focus on prisoners' children.
Therefore, we integrated contextual influences to understand whether cumu-
lative family risk factors (e.g., poverty, parental mental health problems) during
the first year of life have a dose­response relationship to behavioural outcomes
for male prisoners' children at age 9. In addition, we examined whether sup-
port, shared responsibility in the mother­father relationship and close mother­
child relationships moderated the impact of cumulative risk on behavioural
outcomes, thereby demonstrating supportive processes or resilience.The results
could highlight the potential value of considering the impact of contextual
risks as well as existing family strengths in policy and practice approaches to
improving behavioural outcomes for prisoners' children.
Method
Design and sample
The data were obtained in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing (FFCW)
study, which is following a stratified sample of almost 5000 children born
between 1998 and 2000 to mostly unmarried parents in the USA (Reichman,
Teitler, Garfinkel, & McLanahan, 2001). Both parents gave informed consent at
the baseline survey.The mother and father were the main respondents in each
wave (birth, years 1, 3, 5 and 9) and other informants, such as the focal child,
primary caregivers and teachers, were interviewed in later waves. The present
analyses used mother, father and child reported data from the birth (baseline),
year one, age 3 and age 9 surveys.
We analysed a subsample of 801 children who had experienced paternal
imprisonment between the calendar year of the age 3 survey and the date of
the age 5 survey. Girls represented 43.2% of the sample. At baseline, mothers
averaged 22.76 (SD = 5.22) and fathers 25.05 (SD = 6.45) years of age. Most par-
ents were Black (63.3% mothers, 65.8% fathers), but many were Hispanic (20%
mothers, 21.7% fathers), others White (14.2% mothers, 9.2% fathers).
Instruments
Cumulative risk
Ten variables from the baseline and year one surveys were used to measure risk
factors in the families' circumstances. The mothers' and fathers' highest level of
education was indicated on the scale: 1 = graduate or professional school, 2 = col-
legeortechnical,3=highschoolorequivalentor4=lessthanhighschool.Parents'
depression was assessed using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview-
ShortForm(CIDI-SF;Kessleretal.,1998).Diagnosticcriteriaweremetifrespondents

last 12 months.The mothers' reports of household income were used to calculate
the ratio of income to poverty thresholds as defined by the US Census Bureau.The
mothers also described the family structure on the scale: 1 = married, 2 = cohabit-
ing, 3 = visiting, 4 = friends, 5 = hardly talk, 6 = never talk and 7 = father unknown.
In addition, they rated the safety of the streets around their home at night on a
scale of 1 = "very safe"to 4 = "very unsafe". Both parents were asked: "In the past
month, how many days did you have five or more drinks in one day?"and"In the
past month did you use cocaine, crack, speed, LSD or heroin or any other kind of
harddrug?"Alcoholanddrugitemswerecombinedtoindicateproblematicalcohol
or drug use. Fathers reported whether they had done paid work in the previous
week. Variables were transformed into binary coded risk present/absent variables
to calculate the total cumulative risk for each family.Table 1 shows each indicator,

Family moderators (protective factors)
The measures of support, shared responsibility and mother­child closeness that
were developed in the FFCW study were used as family moderators (protective
factors).
Support
At year three, mothers rated six items about support in their relationship with
the father on a scale of 1 = "never" to 3 = "often". Mothers indicated whether
the father "is fair and willing to compromise when you have a disagreement",
"expresses affection or love for you", "insults or criticises your ideas" (reverse

coded),"encourages you to do things that are important to you","listens when
you need someone to talk to"and"really understands your hurts and joys". Scores
ranged from 6 to 18. The reliability of the scale was  = .86.
Shared responsibility
Also at year three, mothers rated four items about shared responsibility with the
child's father on the scale of 1 ="never"to 4 ="always":"How often does father
look after child when you need to do things?","How often does he run errands
for you?", "How often does he fix things around your home?" and "How often
does he take child places he/she needs to go?"Scores ranged from 4 to 16. The
reliability of the scale was  = .91.
Mother­child closeness
The children reported at year nine how close they felt to their mothers. They
responded on a scale of 0 ="never"to 3 ="always"to the four statements:"Your
mom talks over important decisions with you", "Your mom listens to your side
of an argument", "Your mom spends enough time with you" and "Your mom
misses events or activities that are important to you" (reverse scored). Scores
ranged from 0 to 12. The reliability of the items was  = .35. The low reliability
could reflect the heterogeneous behaviours addressed and the focus on both
facts and feelings. The items were combined on the basis of face validity.
The reliabilities of the family moderators with our subsample were similar
to those in the whole study sample ( = .86 for support,  = .89 for shared
responsibility and  = .38 for mother­child closeness). To create a measure of
accumulated protective factors support, shared responsibility and mother­child
closeness total scores were z transformed and summed.
Child behaviour outcomes
We used the mothers' year nine reports on the Child Behavior Checklist for ages
6­18 (CBCL; Achenbach, 1992) to measure the children's behavioural difficulties.
Following Turney and Wildeman (2015), we used the 67 available items from
the internalizing and externalizing behaviour subscales. Items were scored from
1 ="not true"to 3 ="very true/often true". Behavioural difficulties scores ranged
from 67 to 201.The reliability of the scale was  = .96. In addition, the children's
year nine reports on 14 items from the internalizing and externalizing behav-
iour subscales of the Self-Description Questionnaire (SDQ; e.g., Marsh, Relich, &
Smith, 1981) were used.The children responded 0 ="not at all true"to 3 ="very
true"to statements such as"I feel angry when I have trouble learning something",
"I often feel lonely" and "I worry about having someone to play with". Scores
ranged from 0 to 42. The reliability of the scale was  = .84. We combined the
CBCL and SDQ scores to provide a more comprehensive outcome measure that
reflected responses from different informants. The CBCL and SDQ scores were
z transformed and the mean of the scores was calculated.

Data analysis
Data on the cumulative risk indicators and moderator variables were missing
at random (MAR; Little, 1988) and were imputed using SPSS version 21.1 Pooled
estimates from 40 multiple imputed datasets were used. Individual cumula-
tive risk and protective factor items were imputed and the total scores were
calculated after the imputation. Although recommended (e.g., Allison, 2002),
interaction terms were not included in the imputation model because this would
have excluded data on individual risk items. A comparison of the different meth-
ods revealed similar results. Table 2 shows the means and standard deviations
of total cumulative risk and moderator variables before and after imputation.
Outcome data were not imputed.
Bivariate correlations between cumulative risk, behavioural outcomes and
moderator variables were examined. To investigate moderator effects, we car-
ried out hierarchical multiple regression analyses. The potential protective
factors were mean-centered before the analysis. Total cumulative risk was first
entered into the regression model, then the moderator variable and finally the
product term of cumulative risk and the moderator (Hayes, 2013).
Results
Descriptive and bivariate analyses
For the outcomes, average scores were M = 80.47 (SD = 15.17) for the CBCL and
M = 16.73 (SD = 8.99) for the SDQ.
As expected, cumulative risk was negatively correlated with the potential
family protective factors and the latter were negatively correlated with the child
behaviour outcomes (Table 3). Cumulative risk significantly predicted behav-
ioural outcomes at age 9: CBCL, r = .21, p < .01; SDQ, r = .13, p < .01; and the
combined measure, r = .19, p < .01.
1 On most variables, no more than 15% of the data were missing. Exceptions were father
depression (33.2%), father alcohol (33.8%), father drugs (33.2%), father employment
(23.7%), shared responsibility (21.7%) and mother­child closeness (26.5%).

Interactionanalyses:There was statistically significant evidence of moderation
by mother­child closeness for the SDQ and combined outcome measures, and
by accumulated protective factors for the combined outcome, although the
effects were weak. The results are presented in Table 4.
To plot the statistically significant interactions, values one SD below and
above the mean for cumulative risk (1.43 and 4.59, respectively) and the moder-
ators were used to represent X and M in the regression equation. For all models,
problem scores on the outcome measures were lowest when the moderator
was "high" and cumulative risk was "low". To illustrate, behaviour was more
positive for children with"low"cumulative risk and"high"mother­child close-
ness than for children with"low"cumulative risk and"low"mother­child close-
ness. However, at "high" cumulative risk, there was no difference in behaviour
between children with"low"and"high"mother­child closeness scores (Figures
1 and 2). The same pattern was observed with accumulated protective factors
and the combined behaviour outcome (Figure 3).
Discussion
This study examined the importance of family context for prisoners' children's
behavioural development. It investigated whether cumulative risks around the
first year of life predicted behavioural outcomes in middle childhood. In a more
differentiated approach, it also investigated whether within-family factors had
a protective function and contributed to resilience. In particular, supportive
parental relationships, shared responsibility and mother­child closeness were
considered as potential moderators of the relationship between cumulative
risks and behavioural outcomes. Cumulative risk was significantly and posi-
tively associated with behavioural difficulties, but the effect sizes were small.
Results were clearest for the combined behavioural outcome measure but no
strong support for moderation was found. Although statistically significant,
the moderation by mother­child closeness for child reported and combined
behavioural adjustment measures was weak. Support and shared responsibil-
ity did not moderate behavioural outcomes. Weak evidence of moderation by
accumulated protective factors was also found for mother and child combined
reports. The data showed that high levels of mother­child closeness were pro-
tective against problem behaviour in the context of low cumulative risk. Thus,

for children affected by paternal imprisonment in low family risk environments,
the presence of positive family relationships appeared to provide a protective
effect that somewhat diminished the negative impact of risk on positive behav-
ioural development. The findings point to protective effects of mother­child
relationships as well as the possible value of accumulated family relationship
factors. There were no protective effects at high levels of cumulative risk.
Although our bivariate correlations were modest, the finding that cumula-
tive risk predicted children's later behavioural outcomes is in agreement with
results from general population samples (e.g., Deater-Deckard et al., 1998; Van
der Laan et al., 2010). The findings support the notion that prisoners' children
are not a homogeneous group and that their outcomes are influenced by other
risk factors beyond parental imprisonment.This finding suggests dose­response
effects of adversity exposure. Moderation by family relationship factors on
behaviour problems at lower levels of cumulative risk has also been reported in
other studies (e.g., Li et al., 2007;Vanderbilt-Adriance & Shaw, 2008) highlighting
the importance of these protective factors in certain risk contexts. For families

the availability of resources, parenting and children's emotional security (e.g.,
Cummings et al., 2000; Lamb, 2012).
However, our results do not strongly support protective mechanisms from
functional family characteristics. Even accumulated potentially protective fac-
tors did not have a substantial impact. Such findings are somewhat inconsistent
with evidence regarding protective factors and resilience in children experi-
encing other adversities such as parental divorce, abuse and socioeconomic
disadvantage (e.g., Osborn, 1990; Masten & Powell, 2003; Masten & Shaffer, 2006;
Neighbors, Forehand, & McVicar, 1993; Pianta, Egeland, & Sroufe, 1990). There
are several possible reasons for this divergence. The correlations between the
risk factors in early childhood and the child behaviour outcomes were rather
low, so there was not much`space'for buffering or moderating effects. Although
we included important risk factors such as poverty, low parental education,
substance misuse and mental health problems in our cumulative index, its pre-
dictive validity was small. This is in agreement with risk assessment research
showing low correlations between very early risk factors and behavioural out-
comes after longer time intervals (e.g., Hawkins et al., 1998; Lösel & Bender,
2006). Such findings illustrate important processes of flexibility and multifinality
in behavioural development. Although studying development over the longer
term is essential for understanding dynamic processes of resilience (Luthar et
al., 2000), the long period of time covered from child birth to age 9 may partially
explain the weak associations. Dose­response effects that diminish over time
have been explained in terms of recovery from adversity (e.g., Masten & Osofsky,
2010). Of the moderators we analysed, child-reported mother­child closeness
at year nine provided the strongest associations with outcomes, suggesting
Figure 3 Graph showing interaction among cumulative risk, accumulated protective
factors and CBCL and SDQ combined outcome

that protective factors measured temporally closer to outcomes have more
influence than those measured temporally further away. This finding fits with
the above-mentioned interpretations.
The absence of strong protective influences of functional family factors may
also be indicative of Luthar et al.'s (2000)"protective-reactive"and Li et al.'s (2007)
"overwhelming risk pattern". In our high-risk sample with relatively low variabil-
ity in risk, one can assume that there were too many problems for substantial
protective influences to be identified, even at lower levels of risk, and therefore
any protective influences were overwhelmed by risk factors. Prisoners' families
are likely to have many problems and be among the most disadvantaged groups
in society. In our sample, around half the families reached the risk thresholds
for the parents' education and poverty indicators. Therefore, low risk in our
sample is not comparable to low risk in a"normal"population sample. Even low
risk families are at rather high risk for child developmental problems, but are at
lower risk in comparison to others in the sample. The difficulties in identifying
protective effects with high-risk samples have been noted by other researchers
(e.g., Loeber & Farrington, 2012; Vanderbilt-Adriance & Shaw, 2008).
Some limitations to this study should be mentioned. We did not examine
potentially protective individual characteristics (Li et al., 2007; Masten & Powell,
2003; Masten & Shaffer, 2006; Motti-Stefanidi et al., 2012;Werner & Smith, 1992),
specificity of risks and outcomes (Masten & Powell, 2003), non-linear relation-
ships or the stability of resilience processes (Luthar et al., 2000). Another limit is
our main reliance on information from the mothers because not enough of the
fathers provided data consistently. As in other areas of research, perspectives
of different family members are also highly important for studies on paren-
tal imprisonment (Harris, Graham, & Carpenter, 2010; Souza, Lösel, Markson, &
Lanskey, 2013). Because of non-random attrition, families affected by impris-
onment may be underrepresented in later study waves which limit the gener-
alizability of the findings (Schwartz-Soicher, Geller, & Garfinkel, 2011). It should
also be mentioned that there is no established method for creating a cumulative
risk index and no agreement about what risk factors to include. Perhaps a more
domain-specific and theory-based combination of risks may reveal stronger
effects (e.g., Flouri, 2008). Finally, our investigation of protective factors was
limited to using short scales and the reliability of the mother­child closeness
measure was low, although it possessed face validity (e.g., Card & Barnett, 2015).
Notwithstanding these limitations, this study represented a timely investi-
gation of the under-researched topics of cumulative risk and protection with
a large number of hard-to-reach families experiencing the specific adversity
of paternal imprisonment. In principle, the findings support a cumulative risk
and protective factors approach for the study of this group. They suggest that
protective processes may operate in areas that are possible to target through
support and intervention. A tentative policy implication is that better behav-
ioural outcomes for prisoners' children may be achieved if family risk factors are

reduced and protective factors are increased. However, more research is needed
to explore processes of risk and resilience in prisoners' families. For example, the
interaction between biological and social factors in relation to protective effects
for behavioural development has been studied very little (Lösel & Bender, 2003).
Although the findings do not strongly inform our understanding of contex-
tual family influences on resilience processes in children of prisoners, in our high
risk sample small effects are worth noting; they do not suggest that contextual
environments do not matter. Instead, they underscore how difficult it is to study
prisoners' families. An additional important aim for research remains to identify
effective policy to support the positive development of children experiencing
paternal imprisonment in cases where the level of risks is very high and may
overwhelm"natural"protective resources.This relates to several areas of further
study: examining temporal relationships among risks, protective influences and
outcomes to establish whether there are"sensitive periods"at which effects can
be revealed; studying individual characteristics of prisoners' children to identify
protective resources; and integrating protective factors from different domains
to reveal effects in conditions of high adversity.
