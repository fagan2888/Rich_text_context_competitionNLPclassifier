Childhood abuse can dismantle relationships and
well-being over the life course. Experience of parental
abuse during childhood has detrimental implications not
only for childhood health and well-being but also for health
and well-being in adulthood (e.g., Corliss, Cochran, &
Mays, 2002; Futa, Nash, Hansen, & Garbin, 2003; Pepin &
Banyard, 2006). Despite these repercussions of childhood
abuse, not all victims end up psychologically and physically
unhealthy. In fact, resiliency from the effects of abuse may
be true of some victims (Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno, Papa, &
O'Neill, 2002; Masten, 2001). Few studies, however, have
examined resilience following child abuse.
Many factors may play a role in resilient functioning fol-
lowing childhood abuse, including psychosocial resources
(e.g., personal control, support; Cromer & Sachs-Ericsson,
2006; Kendall-Tackett, 2002; Pepin & Banyard, 2006; Shaw &
Krause, 2002). Findings from prior studies suggest that
lower levels of psychosocial resources account for poorer
outcomes. Yet, surprisingly absent from the literature is
consideration of individuals who experienced childhood
abuse but who were able to secure critical psychosocial re-
sources, thus fostering resilience to the abuse. Therefore,
this study examines whether the presence of psychosocial
resources in adulthood is associated with better well-being
among victims of childhood parental abuse.
Childhood physical abuse: a conceptual
definition
The literature generally classifies three types of abuse:
sexual, emotional, and physical, and oftentimes, physical and
sexual abuse are examined together (Chapman, Dube, &
Anda, 2007; Edwards, Holden, Felitti, & Anda, 2003;
Lipman, MacMillan, & Boyle, 2001).Yet, assessments find the
independent effects of physical abuse are just as detrimental
to well-being as sexual abuse (Chapman et al.; Rodgers et al.,
2004), and physical abuse may occur more often than sexual
abuse (16% vs. 9%; U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, 2008). Therefore, we consider independent effects
of parental physical abuse in childhood.
Measurements of childhood physical abuse often refer to
instances of extreme abuse (e.g., kicking, biting, punching,
hitting, choking, or burning a child) by one or both parents
(e.g., Irving & Ferraro, 2006; Shaw & Krause, 2002). Fur-
ther demarcation also occurs between severe forms (e.g.,
pushing, grabbing, or shoving; slapping) and very severe
forms (Corliss et al., 2002; Irving & Ferraro; Pepin &
Banyard, 2006). These distinctions are important for under-
standing abuse among adults of different ages. The use of
physical punishment across cohorts suggests that accept-
able forms of discipline for children in the early part of the
20th century may now be considered "severe" forms of
physical abuse (e.g., slapping; Forehand & McKinney,
1993). "Very severe" abuse, however, has not been consid-
ered a widespread form of discipline for people of any ages.
Therefore, we examined the impact of very severe physical
abuse by parents in childhood due to its long-reaching
effects across different cohorts.
Resilience and potential long-term effects of
childhood abuse
Theories of resilience and cumulative disadvantage may of-
fer explanations for why some victims of parental childhood
physical abuse have poor health and well-being in adulthood
and why other victims report relatively better health and well-
being. Though cumulative disadvantage posits that negative
events can set an individual on a trajectory of poor outcomes
(Dannefer, 2003; O'Rand, 1996), the effects of adverse events
are not unchangeable over the life course (Ferraro & Shippee,
2009). That is, some adults may be resilient to the effects of
parental physical abuse in childhood and maintain healthy and
Psychosocial Resources and Associations Between
Childhood Physical Abuse and Adult Well-being

Childhood physical abuse is often associated with detrimental physical and psychological consequences in adult-
hood. Yet, some adults appear to overcome effects of very severe parental physical abuse in childhood. This study
considered whether psychosocial resources (i.e., emotional and instrumental support, personal control) explain
variability in well-being for adults who experienced childhood physical abuse by their parents. Participants in-
cluded 2,711 adults aged 25­74 years from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS I) study. Moderation models
revealed that high levels of personal control were associated with better physical and psychological functioning
among adults who were physically abused as children. Thus, personal control may be a key factor to health and
well-being and thus resilient functioning following childhood abuse.

stable levels of psychological and physical functioning
(Bonanno, 2004; Bonanno et al., 2002; Masten, 2001).Though
traumatic events during childhood may impede the develop-
ment of psychosocial resources for many individuals (Bowlby,
1980; Brown & Harris, 1978), the availability of psychosocial
resources, avoidance of other traumatic events, and/or access
to other supportive adults during the abuse may foster resil-
ience, thus making room for optimal levels of well-being
(Houshyar & Kaufman, 2005). This support in childhood may
be a precursor to other positive and protective events, including
the development of effective personal control, social networks,
and the ability to take advantage of critical turning points and
opportunities across the life course (e.g., a good marriage,
work stability, educational attainment; Masten et al., 2004).
Therefore, we wanted to understand how the presence of
psychosocial factors may foster resilience in adults who ex-
perienced very severe parental physical abuse in childhood
and how the lack of such resources may be detrimental to
health and well-being. Although there are numerous re-
sources to examine, the benefits of personal control and so-
cial supports (emotional and instrumental) warrant
consideration because of their positive associations with
well-being (Irving & Ferraro, 2006; Ross & Mirowsky,
2003). We chose to focus on perceived constraints (or lack
of personal control) because perceived constraints do not
depict the person's sense of efficacy or effectiveness in car-
rying out goals but represent beliefs that there are uncon-
trollable obstacles or factors that may interfere with those
goals (Lachman & Weaver, 1998). These thoughts may be
true for victims of childhood physical abuse, and overcom-
ing such "obstacles" may be important to health and well-
being. For example, perceived constraints may affect
associations between abuse and well-being and precipitate
beliefs that health and happiness are unattainable. A lack of
perceived constraints (or strong personal control) may be
key in fostering health and well-being among victims of
very severe parental physical abuse in childhood.
Furthermore, prior studies have found that victims of pa-
rental physical abuse in childhood typically fare worse than
individuals who did not experience such abuse because of a
lack of close relationships (Pepin & Banyard, 2006; Shaw &
Krause, 2002). Close relationships are important for happi-
ness and life satisfaction (Rook, Mavandadi, Sorkin, &
Zettel, 2007) and particularly beneficial for those who have
suffered adversity (Cohen, 2004). Because the negative im-
pact of stressors is diminished for people with stronger so-
cial supports (Antonucci, Birditt, & Akiyama, 2009), the
perception of such support may decrease the psychological
and physical responses to the abuse and may be important in
promoting resiliency in later life (Cohen; Fuller-Iglesias,
Sellars, & Antonucci, 2008). Therefore, because of the po-
tential impact of these psychosocial resources, we consider
the implications of current levels of personal control, emo-
tional support, and instrumental support on well-being for
victims of very severe parental physical abuse.
Childhood physical abuse: potential
moderating effects of psychosocial resources
Previous literature has already established the mediating
effects of psychosocial resources and finds that psychoso-
cial resources weaken the link between childhood physical
abuse and adult well-being (Horwitz, Widom, McLaughlin, &
White, 2001; Springer, Sheridan, Kuo, & Carnes, 2007).
For example, Shaw and Krause's (2002) examination of
childhood abuse in the National Survey of Midlife in the
United States (MIDUS I) suggested that individuals physi-
cally abused by parents as children had higher levels of de-
pression and reported more chronic conditions and that
personal control and emotional support in adulthood medi-
ated this association. Therefore, the effects of parental
physical abuse in childhood may vary based on the avail-
ability of psychosocial resources, specifically personal con-
trol and support.
Although previous literature enhances our understanding
of how psychosocial resources may foster resilience in
adulthood well-being for victims of childhood physical
abuse, these findings raise the question of variability among
individuals who experienced very severe childhood physi-
cal abuse by their parents. Indeed, it is possible that psycho-
social resources exert moderating associations between
early childhood abuse and adult well-being. Therefore, we
hypothesize that when levels of emotional support, instru-
mental support, and personal control are higher, victims of
very severe childhood physical abuse will exhibit resilience
to the abuse, thus exhibiting better health and well-being
outcomes. Conversely, very severe physical abuse in child-
hood paired with lower levels of support and personal con-
trol may result in poorer well-being in adulthood.
Methods
Sample and Design
Data were from the larger Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS I), a nationally representative study designed to
assess how different factors mesh to affect physical health
and well-being during the transition from early adulthood to
midlife and to old age. The protocol included a 30-min
phone interview and two self-administered questionnaires.
The MIDUS oversampled men and older adults. Analyses
for this article will only focus on the psychosocial variables
in adulthood as the MIDUS has only limited retrospective
data regarding participants' childhood.
Sample for This Study
Although there were 3,487 main respondents included in
the MIDUS I, we limited our study to 2,711 who answered
key questions on very severe childhood physical abuse by
parents and who identified having a mother and a father fig-
ure in childhood. The following section includes a discus-
sion of the sample creation.
CHILDHOOD PHYSICAL ABUSE AND ADULTHOOD WELL-BEING 427
The first step in sample creation was to cull participants
who answered two of the very severe physical abuse ques-
tions from the Conflict Tactics Scale (Straus, 1979). Each
question asked how often (a) a mother or (b) a father
"kicked, bit, hit with a fist; hit or tried to hit with something;
beat-up; choked; and/or burned or scalded" the participant
during childhood. The second step in sample creation was
to also select participants who identified two parental fig-
ures during childhood. Including participants who only had
one parental figure may confound the number of parents
with the frequency of exposure to physical violence (e.g.,
Shaw & Krause, 2002) and may introduce other factors,
such as death and separation of parents.
Therefore, of the original MIDUS I participants, 776
(22%) were dropped from the sample because (a) partici-
pants did not report having both a mother and a father figure
during childhood and adolescence (n = 650, 19%) and (b)
participants did not respond to any of the parental very se-
vere abuse items (n = 126, 3%). The final sample for this
study includes 2,711 adults who either never experienced
abuse (n = 2,057) or experienced abuse from either one or
both of their parents (n = 654), all of whom identified a
mother and father figure in childhood. Analyses that follow
used listwise deletion of missing values to deal with item
nonresponse (e.g., Shaw & Krause, 2002).
Dependent Variables
Negative affect.--Negative affect was the average of six
items assessing current bad mood through the examination
of negative feelings. The question asked, "During the past
30 days, how much of the time did you feel: so sad nothing
could cheer you up, nervous, restless or fidgety, hopeless,
that everything was an effort, and/or worthless," rated from
1 (none of the time) to 5 (all of the time), a = .88. Prior
research on the MIDUS I has also used the average of
negative affect (e.g., Mroczek, 2004).
Physical health status.--For parsimony in analyses, current
physical health was represented by an index composed of two
measures: a single item assessing self-rated health, rated from
1 (poor) to 5 (excellent) and a count of 31 chronic health con-
ditions (e.g., asthma, hypertension, cancer; Shaw & Krause,
2002). To ensure the health index variable indicated that high-
er scores reflected better health, we took the "additive inverse"
of the chronic condition score. Using z scores, we standard-
ized the self-rated physical health and chronic condition mea-
sures and summed them together to create a health problem
index (see Antonucci, Ajrouch, & Janevic, 2003).
Independent Variable
Very severe physical abuse.--We created a dichotomous
variable (0 = did not experience abuse and 1 = experienced
abuse) from the original scale used for the two parental abuse
items (1 = never, 2 = rarely, 3 = sometimes, and 4 = often).
Our variable represented people who either never experi-
enced abuse at all during childhood from either parent (e.g.,
they responded "never" for both items and were coded as
"did not experience abuse") or who experienced abuse from
one or both of their parents (i.e., the respondent answered
"rarely," "sometimes," or "often" for either both parents or
for just one of his or her parents; these participants were
coded as "experienced abuse"). Other studies that have used
the MIDUS have operationalized their abuse variable as
experiencing abuse from one or both of their parents (Corliss
et al., 2002; Shaw & Krause, 2002). To make sure that we
considered different operationalizations of the abuse variable,
we conducted the final models using abuse as a continuous
variable, as a categorical variable (i.e., 1 = never, 2 = rarely/
sometimes,3=often),andasthedichotomousvariabledescribed
earlier. The pattern of findings was identical for each, so we
present the final models using the dichotomous variable.
Reasons for dichotomization were threefold. First, much
of the abuse literature differentiates between experiencing
the abuse at all and never experiencing it (e.g., Berenson &
Andersen, 2006; Leitenberg, Gibson, & Novy, 2004; Pepin &
Banyard, 2006). Second, items comprising the very severe
abuse variable were skewed toward never (~80%). Third,
we found meaningful differences between individuals who
"rarely" and those who "never" experienced abuse (i.e., those
who were "rarely" abused had lower levels of physical
health). Finally, this dichotomy best represents our theo-
retical perspective that even one experience of very severe
abuse is a trauma in childhood.
Moderating Variables
Emotional support.--Participants completed two 4-item
scales assessing current emotional support from friends and
from family in adulthood (Rossi, 2004). Questions included
"How much do members of your family (not including your
spouse or partner)/friends really care about you?"; "How
muchdotheyunderstandthewaythatyoufeelaboutthings?";
"How much can you rely on them for help if you have a seri-
ous problem?"; and "How much can you open up to them if
you have a serious problem?" Each was rated from 1 (not at
all) to 4 (a lot). The mean of the eight items was estimated to
create an index of emotional support. Higher scores indicate
more emotional support (Shaw & Krause, 2002), a = .87.
Instrumental support.--Instrumental support was as-
sessed by the number of hours per month the individual re-
ceived unpaid assistance (not including assistance from the
spouse or partner; Rossi, 2004).
Personal control.--Assessment of personal control in-
cluded eight questions on perceived constraints (Lachman &
Pitzer and Fingerman
428
Weaver, 1998). Example items included "I have little con-
trol over the things that happen to me" and "I sometimes
feel as if I'm being pushed around in my life." Items were
rated from 1 (agree strongly) to 7 (disagree strongly); thus,
higher scores reflect lower levels of perceived constraints.
The scale consisted of the mean of the eight items, a = .85.
Results
Preliminary Analyses and Analytic Strategy
Descriptive statistics for the sample are shown in Tables 1
and 2. Table 1 depicts mean group differences assessed
using independent t tests between the abused and nonab-
used groups. Consistent with other studies investigating
childhood abuse using the MIDUS I (e.g., Shaw & Krause,
2002), 24% of respondents reported childhood physical
abuse by one or both parents. Half of the respondents were
women, and the average age of all participants was 47 years.
In general, the mean level for most resources was signifi-
cantly lower for adults who experienced very severe child-
hood abuse. Overall, abused respondents had poorer levels
of personal control and emotional support, as well as poorer
physical health and higher levels of negative affect.
Not all victims of childhood physical abuse had low lev-
els of resources, however. In fact, we found that there are
abused individuals who had higher levels of personal con-
trol (n = 312), emotional support (n = 333), and instrumen-
tal support (n = 294). Therefore, Table 2 depicts an analysis
of mean differences between abused individuals who had
high levels of resources and abused individuals who had
lower levels of resources. Individuals who were abused
and who had high levels of personal control and emotional
support generally reported higher mean levels of physical and
psychological health than abused people with lower levels
of personal control and emotional support. Additionally,
abused individuals higher in personal control also had
higher mean levels of emotional support. Likewise, abused
individuals high in emotional support had higher levels of
personal control.
Regarding high and low scores for support, we used me-
dian splits to distinguish between low and high levels of
control and support. Although we recognize limitations
when employing the use of median splits (e.g., loss of
power; MacCallum, Zhang, Preacher, & Rucker, 2002), we
did not use the dichotomous median split variables in
regression analyses where the loss of power would be prob-
lematic. Rather, we used this split in the figures and Table 2
because we are simply trying to get a glimpse of the differ-
ences among abused individuals who have "low" and "high"
levels of resources. Other studies use a similar approach
(e.g., Fingerman, Pitzer, Lefkowitz, Birditt, & Mroczek,
2008).
To test our research questions, we conducted two ordi-
nary least squares regression models where negative affect
and the physical health index were analyzed separately as
dependent variables. The key independent variable in each
model was very severe physical abuse by parents in child-
hood. Moderating variables included current levels of emo-
tional support from friends and family, instrumental support,
and personal control. For each dependent variable, we esti-
mated models that included interactions between very se-
vere physical abuse by parents in childhood and each of the

moderating variables, as well as their main effects. We
grand-mean centered the moderating variables prior to esti-
mating interactions. The abuse variable was not centered
due to its dichotomous nature (Jaccard & Turrisi, 2003).
Given the large age range of the sample, participant age was
also considered in three-way interactions with abuse and
resources. Patterns did not differ between age groups, how-
ever, so we simply controlled for age, along with sex, edu-
cation, and mother or father still living (i.e., we did not want
to confound the memories of abuse with the subsequent
death of a parent) in the final models.
Severe Physical Abuse and Well-being
Models with significant findings for very severe physical
abuse in childhood and subsequent well-being in adulthood
are presented in Table 3. One significant interaction effect
emerged from each model: Parental Physical Abuse ×
Personal Control. In the model predicting physical health, we
found significant main effects for parental physical abuse,
personal control, emotional support, and instrumental sup-
port. This indicated that people who were very severely
physically abused in childhood by their parents had lower
levels of physical health and those who had higher levels of
personal control and emotional support reported better
health. Conversely, individuals who reported more instru-
mental support reported lower physical health levels. In the
model predicting negative affect, we also found significant
main effects for abuse, personal control, and emotional sup-
port. That is, the experience of very severe childhood phys-
ical abuse was associated with worse psychological
well-being, whereas higher levels of personal control and
emotional support were associated with better psychological
well-being.

To explore significant interactions, we estimated post hoc
tests that included plotting simple regression lines for high
and low values of the moderator variables (Aiken & West,
1991; Holmbeck, 1997). Our equation included terms for
the control variables, two main effects, and the interaction
term. We inserted the unstandardized regression coefficients
for the bs and y-intercept and used all possible combina-
tions of high (+1 SD) and low (-1 SD) values for the mod-
erators. For the dichotomous abuse variable (the predictor),
we inserted 0 to estimate lines for nonabused and 1 for
abused individuals (Aiken & West). From these analyses,
we created "abused-high," "abused-low," "nonabused-low,"
and "nonabused-high" values and plotted the predicted val-
ues for each independent variable. The error bars on the fig-
ures represent the standard error of the plotted points or the
average deviation from the actual y from the predicted y.
With regard to physical health, Figure 1 illustrates the
significant interaction between Parental Physical Abuse ×
Personal Control. Individuals with high personal control
were in better physical health overall. Specifically, physical
health levels were somewhat comparable between individu-
als who experienced parental physical abuse and who had
high levels of personal control and their nonabused counter-
parts. Additionally, the figure shows that very severe abuse is
associated with diminished physical health, particularly when
an individual has lower levels of personal control. These in-
dividuals exhibited the lowest levels of physical health overall.
Note that in this figure, the y-axis is restrained to show the
effect, and the true range of the y-axis is from -2.88 to 1.50.
Figure 2 depicts the significant interaction between
parental physical abuse and personal control with regard to
negative affect. We found that people who were parentally
physically abused as children and who had higher levels of
personal control looked comparable with their nonabused
counterparts. That is, they too exhibited lower levels of neg-
ative affect. Yet, the detrimental association between lower
levels of personal control and negative affect seemed par-
ticularly pronounced for individuals who were abused as
children. That is, these individuals seemed to have some of the
lowest levels of personal control overall. Again, note that
the y-axis has been restricted to show the effect, and the true
range of the y-axis is 1­2.24 as the negative affect variable
was square root transformed because of high skew.
To understand differences between abused and nonab-
used individuals on physical health and negative affect
based on the level of personal control, we employed the
Johnson­Neyman technique (Hayes & Matthes, 2009;
Johnson & Neyman, 1936). This technique identifies re-
gions in the range of personal control where the effect of
parental physical abuse on negative affect and physical
health is statistically significant and nonsignificant. What
we found was that in each model, with the exception of very
high levels of personal control (6.54 and above [out of a
scale of 7] for the physical health model and 6.32 and above
[out of a scale of 7] for the negative affect model), abuse
was a significant predictor across most levels of personal
control. Figures 1 and 2 also show that this effect was larger
for low values of personal control than for higher values.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to examine whether psy-
chosocial resources are protective against the effects of
childhood physical abuse. Prior research has shown that in-
dividuals who suffered abuse from their parents in child-
hood suffer poorer physical and psychological health
compared with people who did not suffer such abuse (Afifi,
Brownridge, Cox, & Sareen, 2006; Sachs-Ericsson, Kend-
all-Tackett, & Hernandez, 2007; Springer et al., 2007). Fur-
thermore, other studies have substantiated mediating effects
of psychosocial resources and suggested that a lack in re-
sources can predict poorer well-being in adulthood for
abuse victims (Horwitz et al., 2001; Shaw & Krause, 2002).

CHILDHOOD PHYSICAL ABUSE AND ADULTHOOD WELL-BEING 431
Yet, prior studies had not considered heterogeneity in the
population of adults who were abused as children, not all
such adults incur lack of resources or poorer outcomes.
Conclusions from this study highlighted two important rev-
elations: (a) very severe parental physical abuse in child-
hood does not always lead to poor health and well-being in
adulthood and (b) personal control is a key resource in buff-
ering against detrimental effects of childhood physical
abuse. These results, therefore, extend prior research by
showing that not only did the mean level of resources differ
for adults who suffered very severe parental physical abuse
in childhood versus those who did not, but the potential im-
plications of these deficits in resources may be worse for
victims of parental physical abuse.
Furthermore, these results are consistent with prior re-
search on resiliency. Resilience to a traumatic event is charac-
terized by the ability to maintain stable levels of psychological
and physical health (Bonanno, 2004; Masten, 2001). Al-
though this study cannot address the "maintenance" of stable
levels of well-being, the findings suggest that a sense that one
can achieve his or her goals is a source of strength for victims
of childhood physical abuse. The long-term maintenance of
health and well-being after childhood abuse is facilitated by
the perception that one can overcome obstacles and barriers
to goals, which may include a healthier lifestyle.
Personal Control and Well-being
The importance of personal control was not surprising
given previous research linking personal control to psycho-
logical and physical health (Prenda & Lachman, 2001; Ross &
Mirowsky, 2003). Not only may personal control beliefs
motivate health behaviors (Skaff, 2007), but personal con-
trol and the presence of stable and close relationships were
major factors in children's resilience to abuse in prior stud-
ies (Bolger & Patterson, 2003; Cicchetti & Rogosch, 1997).
Results from the present study suggest another component
in the connection between parental physical abuse in child-
hood, personal control, and adulthood well-being. From
preliminary analyses on mean differences, we found that
individuals physically abused by their parents in childhood
who had higher levels of personal control had higher mean
levels of emotional support from friends and family than
those who experienced parental physical abuse in childhood
with low personal control. These differences suggest that
emotional support may play an important role in the forma-
tion of personal control. Although this study did not follow
parentally abused children over time, findings suggest that
stable parents, guardians, and other close individuals may
provide support to some abused children, fostering develop-
ment of personal control (Ross & Mirowsky; Shaw, Krause,
Chatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004; Uchino,
2009). This underlying link between emotional support and
personal control may explain why emotional support was
not a significant moderator.
Contrary to expectations, we did not find that instrumen-
tal support makes a difference for well-being. Previous lit-
erature suggested that social support is only effective in
reducing the effects of stressful events when the form of
social support matches the demands of the event (Cohen,
2004). Therefore, instrumental support (e.g., help around
the house, transportation, childcare) may not be appropriate
or useful for someone who was physically abused as a child.
These individuals may need emotional supports to help fos-
ter a sense of personal control to dampen the long-lasting
effects of abuse.
Limitations
Although this study provides new insights on the role of
personal control for victims of childhood abuse, it has some
limitations. First, the cross-sectional nature of the study im-
plies that we can only speak to associations and not causality.
Future research should examine associations among vari-
ables over time to see if the continued presence of personal
control aids in the maintenance of healthy levels of well-
being for victims of childhood physical abuse. Second, the data
collection method confounded reports of physical health and
psychological well-being with reports of childhood physical
abuse. Most recent evidence suggests, however, that memo-
ries of specific childhood experiences are highly stable and
not subject to mood (Yancura & Aldwin, 2009) and retro-
spective memories tend to be fairly accurate when remem-
bering childhood abuse (Hardt & Rudder, 2004).
Finally, this study is an initial foray in considering how
individuals who experienced very severe childhood physi-
cal abuse vary from one another. Although we examined
current levels of support and personal control in adulthood,
the life course perspective suggests that those psychosocial
resources may reflect other factors associated with the con-
text of abuse in childhood. Presence or absence of resources
at this measurement point in adulthood is not necessarily
indicative of the presence or absence of those resources
throughout life. There may be many other resources and
events that could influence the formation or lack of forma-
tion of the current resources. Thus, future research should
consider psychosocial and social resources received early in
life and currently.
Overall, this study indicates that very severe physical
abuse in childhood does not suggest that health and well-
being will be poor in adulthood. This study extended prior
research by considering variation in adulthood outcomes of
early childhood abuse. Individual differences in health and
well-being likely reflect differences in personal control. The
presence of personal control appears to partially explain
why some individuals are resilient to abuse and why others
experience disadvantage. It is important to note, however,
that this study only examined the resources that were cur-
rently present in adulthood. We consider these findings im-
portant in understanding how events that unfold over the
Pitzer and Fingerman

life course have implications on the effects of childhood
abuse in adulthood. An important next initiative will be to
examine the presence of psychosocial resources in child-
hood and adolescence, understanding whether stability in
resources plays an important role in stability of well-being
over time for parentally abused individuals.
