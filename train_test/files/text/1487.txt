OBJECTIVE -- While lower hemoglobin is generally associated with adverse events in dia-
betes, we have recently observed in type 1 diabetes that those with overt nephropathy had
hemoglobin levels as high as 18.8 g/dl. We thus explored whether hemoglobin concentrations
are generally higher in type 1 diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- Baseline (1986­1988) hemoglobin levels
from the Pittsburgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Complications Study (EDC) of type 1 diabetes
were compared with general population data from the National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES) III in the same age range as the EDC population (aged 8­48 years).
RESULTS -- Both male and female EDC study participants had significantly higher hemoglo-
bin levels than their NHANES III counterparts (men: 16.0 vs. 15.1 g/dl, P  0.0001; women:
14.1 vs. 13.3 g/dl, P  0.0001). The difference between the two populations was greatest in
adolescent female subjects.
CONCLUSIONS -- Hemoglobin levels may be higher in type 1 diabetes than in the general
population, which may have important clinical implications.

Although low hemoglobin is gener-
ally associated with adverse events
in diabetes (1) and kidney disease
(2), we have recently observed relatively
high hemoglobin levels (as high as 18.8
g/dl) among individuals with type 1 dia-
betes and overt nephropathy (3) com-
pared with the general renal disease
population (4). This led us to question
whether hemoglobin levels are generally
elevated in type 1 diabetes. We therefore
assessed 652 individuals from the Pitts-
burgh Epidemiology of Diabetes Compli-
cations Study (EDC) of type 1 diabetes
and compared the hemoglobin levels ob-
served with those of the general National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) III population.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- EDC is a 20-year pro-
spective study based on a well-defined co-
hort with childhood onset (aged 17
years) type 1 diabetes living within 100
miles of the University of Pittsburgh at
study baseline (5,6). For these analyses,
baseline data (1986­1988) from 652 par-
ticipants (50.5% female, 98% Caucasian)
were examined. Blood samples were as-
sayed for hemoglobin and A1C. Overt ne-
phropathy was defined as albumin
excretion rate 200 g/min or dialysis/
renal transplantation.
Hemoglobin in EDC was measured
using the Coulter Counter Model S-Plus
IV automated blood cell counter (Coulter
Electronics, Hialeah, FL). General popu-
lation comparison data were retrieved
from NHANES III (years 1988­1994) (7)
for Caucasians in the same age range as
the EDC population (i.e., aged 8­48
years). Hemoglobin in NHANES III was
measured using a semiautomated cell
counter (Coulter hemoglobinometer) (7).
Appropriate sampling weights were
used to obtain unbiased estimates of he-
moglobin means and SEs in NHANES III.
These sampling weights account for the
complex design of the NHANES III sur-
vey, including oversampling of certain
subgroups and nonresponse bias, and
provide estimates that are representative
of the noninstitutionalized U.S. popula-
tion. Mean hemoglobin levels were calcu-
lated using PROC Surveymeans in SAS
9.1.3 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
RESULTS -- Hemoglobin ranged from
8.3 to 20.0 g/dl in EDC and from 5.2 to
18.7 g/dl in NHANES III. Relative to the
general population, EDC participants had
higher hemoglobin levels overall (15.1 vs.
14.2 g/dl, P  0.0001) (Fig. 1) and sex
specifically (men: 16.0 vs. 15.1 g/dl, P 
0.0001; women: 14.1 vs. 13.3 g/dl, P 
0.0001).
The difference between the two pop-
ulations was greatest in teenage females;
girls aged 15­19 years with type 1 diabe-
tes had hemoglobin levels 2 g/dl higher
than similarly aged NHANES III females;
the difference in boys was 1 g/dl. EDC
teenage girls had hemoglobin levels simi-
lar to those of NHANES III teenage boys
(Fig. 1). In male subjects with type 1 dia-
betes, hemoglobin levels were stable until
about age 14 years, when they began to
rise, peaking at 16.9 g/dl at approximately
age 22 years. A similar rise in hemoglobin,
though less steep, was seen in NHANES
III male subjects (Fig. 1). In female sub-
jects with type 1 diabetes, hemoglobin
levels did not display the same pattern of
a constant rise throughout adolescence
observed in male subjects, but rose
sharply, by 1.6 g/dl, at the beginning of
their teens, remaining elevated through-
out the teen years, peaking at 15.0 g/dl. In
contrast, in NHANES III female subjects
aged 12­19 years, hemoglobin remained
constant (Fig. 1).
In the general population adults, he-
moglobin levels remained relatively stable
in both sexes. In the EDC type 1 diabetic
population, hemoglobin in male subjects
began to drop in their mid-20s whereas in
female subjects, this occurred earlier (Fig.
1). The decline in hemoglobin in adult
type 1 diabetic male subjects could be ex-
plained by overt nephropathy, as those
without overt nephropathy showed no
decline in adulthood after their mid-20s.
In adult type 1 diabetic female subjects,
this difference by overt nephropathy sta-

tus was less marked. Women without
overt nephropathy still showed this age-
related decline, and the difference by
overt nephropathy status did not reach
statistical significance until age 40 years
(online appendix Fig. 1 [available at http://
care.diabetesjournals.org/cgi/content/full/
dc09-0713/DC1]).
To determine whether the elevated
hemoglobin observed in EDC subjects
might simply be due to increased
hemoconcentration from dehydration
secondary to poor glycemic control, anal-
yses were repeated with EDC participants
restricted to those with 1) A1C levels
greater than or equal to the median and 2)
A1C levels less than or equal to the me-
dian. Similar results were obtained to
those in Fig. 1.
In a subanalysis, hemoglobin levels in
our 13 African American female subjects
with type 1 diabetes (aged 18­39 years)
did not differ from our Caucasian female
subjects (13.7 vs. 14.1 g/dl, P  0.20) but
were significantly higher than NHANES
III African American female subjects
(13.7 vs. 12.4 g/dl, P  0.0001). Hemo-
globin levels significantly differed be-
tween NHANES III African American and
Caucasian female subjects (12.4 vs. 13.2
g/dl, P  0.0001). Sample size prohibited
formal analyses in males.
CONCLUSIONS -- We have demon-
strated that hemoglobin levels are higher
in type 1 diabetes than in the general pop-
ulation, by 1 g/dl. To our knowledge,
this is the first report to document this
finding. We have shown that this differ-
ence is greatest for adolescent females,
particularly striking since in the general
population the adolescent rise in hemo-
globin is only observed in male subjects
(8). Although hemoglobin levels began to
decline in type 1 diabetes in the early to
mid-20s this decline was not observed in
the general population. In men with type
1 diabetes, kidney disease largely ac-
counted for this decline. The increase in
hemoglobin was unrelated to glycemic
control.
Potential explanations include a re-
sponse to generalized hypoxia secondary
to vascular disease, or a response to tes-
tosterone, which has been reported to be
increased in type 1 diabetes (9,10). In ad-
dition to the erythropoietic effects of tes-
tosterone, insulin and insulin-like growth
factor-1 and -2 stimulate erythropoietin
production in astrocytes (11). Finally, in-
termittent ketosis might lead to increased
-hydroxy-butyrate, resulting in higher
fetal hemoglobin (12) and hence total he-
moglobin levels. Elevated fetal hemoglo-
bin has been observed in both children
and adults with type 1 diabetes and corre-
lated only weakly (13), or not at all (14),
with glycemic control but increased in ado-
lescence (14). These data have potentially
important clinical implications not only for
interpretinghemoglobinvaluesintype1di-
abetes but also for complications, as we
have recently reported that high hemoglo-
bin is a risk factor for proliferative retinop-
athyinmen;whileinwomen,whoaremore
likely to be in the normal to low end of the
hemoglobin distribution, a U-shaped rela-
tionship exists (15).
