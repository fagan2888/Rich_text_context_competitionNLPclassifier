Due to numerous corporate scandals during the late 1990s
and early 2000s, the United States is in need of constructive
organizational leadership. This study investigated the prepa-
ration of future business leaders by analyzing development
of moral judgment during postsecondary ethics education.
Based on the notion that today's learners are future busi-
ness leaders, the purpose of this study was to determine
undergraduate student perceptions of ethical dilemmas as a
means of measuring general concern for leadership ethics
within the marketplace. As a foundation of reality, ethics
informs "the morality of the processes of social choices and
action in which the leaders and followers engage and collec-
tively pursue" (Bass & Steidlmeier, 1999, p. 181).
The link between the study of ethics in college and an
evolution of students' consideration of ethical dilemmas has
been established and research related to moral reasoning is
well documented (Carlson & Burke, 1998). Early works of
Piaget showed that children learn through activity and repli-
cation (Bresler, Cooper, & Palmer, 2001). He suggested that
development of moral reasoning is the foundation of ethical
behavior. To encourage moral development, Piaget argued
that schools should "should emphasize cooperative decision-
making and problem solving, nurturing moral development
by requiring students to work out common rules based on
fairness" (Nucci, 2008).
Lawrence Kohlberg (1971) built on Piaget's foundation
by developing the theory of postconventional morality. He
expanded the study of moral development to secondary-
school and university students, noting that moral develop-
ment took much longer to develop than Piaget originally
argued (Nucci, 2008).
In turn, he theorized that one achieved moral develop-
ment by completing six stages of growth (see Table 1;
Kohlberg, 1975). These stages range from complete self-
absorption and care for nothing but one's survival, as is the
case in infancy, to Level 3, where one finds a balance between
self and community (Kohlberg, 1981).Advancement through
these stages occurred as one developed proficiency in terms
of self-view and worldview. This proficiency occurred
through acquisition of knowledge through informal or for-
mal education (Kohlberg, 1981).
The increase of government activity within the realm of
ethics, beginning in the 1960s, led to an increase in academic
research. Public concern related to civil rights and corporate
scandal spawned a variety of studies related to social respon-
sibility (DeGeorge, 2005). This was the beginning of univer-
sity involvement in ethics education.

Individual Differences in Disgust
Sensitivity Do Not Influence Moral
Reasoning, but a Discipline-Specific Ethics
Course Does

Abstract
The purpose of this research study was to determine undergraduate students' perceptions of ethical dilemmas as a means of
measuring general concern for leadership ethics within the marketplace. With the end goal of identifying best practices for
ethics education in business and to further aid our understanding of how individual factors, such as disgust sensitivity, can
alter students' moral assessments, we measured the relationship between emotion and cognition in affecting ethical decision
making. We found specific coursework in business ethics can produce a significant gain in moral reasoning. These results
suggest that in the absence of strong moral intuitions, discipline-specific ethics coursework can lead to more postconventional
moral decision making.

Prior to inception of university business ethics courses,
ethics study was considered part of philosophy or theology
(DeGeorge, 2005).
The new ingredient and the catalyst that led to the field of
business ethics as such was the entry of a significant number of
philosophers, who brought ethical theory and philosophical
analysis to bear on a number of business issues. (Bowie, 1986)
By the 1980s, numerous universities offered coursework
that blended ethics theory from a philosophical standpoint
with business issues of the day.
A number of studies indicated that university education
played a vital role in developing ethical attitudes of business
primary school students who are likely to be future business
leaders (Chai, Lung, & Ramly, 2007). To coincide with
increased interest in the development of ethical decision
making at the college level, Crane (2004) proposed that busi-
ness students' desired increased knowledge related to ethical
dilemmas and moral reasoning.
To that end, an important part of resolving ethical dilem-
mas "involves prioritizing one's values and being prepared
to deal with values conflicts that might occur" (The
Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business
International Board of Directors, 2004). Kohlberg argued
that the goal of education should have been personal devel-
opment (Rest, 1986). He indicated that achieving the next
stage of moral development should have been the goal of
educators. Rather than teaching characteristics, such as hap-
piness and kindness, he indicated that it was critical that
schools aid in the learning of reasoning that resulted in just
choices (Power, Higgins, & Kohlberg, 1989).
Moral Development
Moral judgments can be defined as, "evaluations of the
actions or character of a person that are made with respect to
a set of virtues held by a culture or sub-culture to be obliga-
tory" (Haidt, 2001). Kohlberg's model of morality assumes
that the best way to understand moral development is to
examine it as a cognitive process (Thoma, 2006). Initially,
this understanding of morality included six stages of devel-
opment (see Table 1) and morality was the product of ratio-
nal, cognitive operations. Since, modifications to this original
conception of morality have emerged. The neo-Kohlbergian
view maintains that cognitive processes are central to the
understanding of moral development; however, this outlook
is less dependent on discrete stages and acknowledges that
moral development probably shifts more gradually from
lower levels, which are governed by self-interest to more
flexible conceptions of morality that include reciprocity,
shared ideals, and inquiry (Thoma, 2006). According to this
view, moral dilemmas activate "schemas" that originate from
the synthesis of previous knowledge, personal experience,
and life events, as illustrated in Table 2.
When presented with a moral dilemma, these schemas
serve as the default program for interpretation and produce a
moral judgment in situations where accepted, intuitive, or
easily recognizable codes of conduct cease to exist (Thoma,
2006). The cognitive approach to morality presupposes that
gains in moral development may be achieved through ethics
education, assuming it involves some aspect of cognitive
training.
An alternative theory of morality points to the influence
of humans' evolutionary history. The need to evaluate moral
dilemmas may have preceded the advanced cognitive skill
sets required to deliberate different points of view. Therefore,
moral judgments may be influenced more by emotion, than
reason. This view is summarized by the social intuitionist
model of morality. It suggests that moral judgments arise
automatically and the activation of a cognitive schema is sec-
ondary (Haidt, 2001). In other words, moral assessments
stem from initial, gut reactions. In support of this view, Haidt
(2001) presents evidence that emotional reactions were bet-
ter predictors of a person's moral judgments than deliberate
attempts to reason. The primary difference between these
two models of moral reasoning depends on the timing and
use of moral reasoning. To social intuitionists, moral reason-
ing occurs after the moral judgment is made; to cognitive
theorists, moral reasoning is used to reach the judgment.
Disgust is a strong emotional reaction elicited by a variety
of aversive stimuli. Interestingly, the neural substrates acti-
vated by disgust are the same substrates presumed to be acti-
vated by moral judgments. Across a variety of cultures,
Table 1. Kohlberg's Stages of Moral Development.
Level 1. Preconventional moral reasoning
 Stage 1 Punishment­obedience orientation
Rules are obeyed to avoid punishment. A good or bad action is
determined by its physical consequences.
 Stage 2 Personal reward orientation
Personal needs determine right and wrong. An interest in others is
concerned for to the extent to which it aids one in reaching one's
own needs.
Level 2. Conventional moral reasoning
 Stage 3 Good boy­nice girl orientation
Good is determined by what pleases, aids, and is approved by others.
 Stage 4 Law and order orientation
Laws are absolute. Authority must be respected and social order
maintained.
Level 3. Postconventional moral reasoning
 Stage 5 Social contract orientation
Good is determined by socially agreed on standards of individual
rights. This is a morality similar to that of the U.S. Constitution.
 Stage 6 Universal ethical principle orientation
Good and right are matters of individual conscience and involve
abstract concepts of justice, human dignity, and equality.

similar facial expressions are used to express the rejection of
disgust-inducing physical stimuli, such as rotten food, and
socially inappropriate behaviors such as incest (Haidt, Rozin,
McCauley, & Imada, 1997). Furthermore, a study by Schnall,
Haidt, Clore, and Jordan (2008) demonstrated that disgust-
inducing changes in the physical environment had an impact
on moral judgments. In this study, a bad smell (induced with
fart spray) led to more severe condemnation of consensual
sex between first cousins and legislation that would allow
first cousins to marry. On the contrary, another study by
Liljenquist, Zhong, and Galinsky (2010) found that willing-
ness to engage in charitable behavior and reciprocity was
promoted in the presence of a clean smell (i.e., a spray of
Windex). There is considerable variability in tolerance to the
conditions that elicit disgust. For example, one person may
be repulsed by the thought of eating monkey brains, whereas
another person could be excited or intrigued.
Because the activation of disgust is closely tied with the
severity of a person's moral judgment and clean, not disgust-
ing, conditions may influence reciprocal and charitable
behavior, it is important to understand whether individual
differences in disgust sensitivity influence moral judgments.
These findings could have important implications for the
teaching of ethical decision making. First, if the social intu-
itionist model of moral judgments is correct, promoting the
cognitive aspects of moral development through specific
training in ethics may be a minimally effective means of
improving moral judgments and ultimately, moral behavior.
Second, these findings suggest that a better understanding of
the moment-to-moment situation and environment influ-
ences that influence morality could be used to promote cer-
tain moral sentiments over others.
The purpose of the present study was to better understand
the role of cognition and emotion in moral awareness, spe-
cifically in the context of ethics education. We are interested
in the relationship between disgust sensitivity and the level
of moral judgments made by undergraduate business stu-
dents before and after exposure to a discipline-specific ethics
course (Business Ethics) and predicted that exposure to the
ethics course will increase students' level of moral develop-
ment. In addition, we predicted that disgust sensitivity would
be related to moral development.
Method
Participants
Forty-five (22 male and 23 female) undergraduate business
and management students participated in the study.
Participants were recruited from business courses at Alfred
State. About 24 participants were first-semester freshman
and 21 were seniors. All but 2 of the participants were
younger than 25 years of age. Participation was voluntary
and participants were not offered an incentive for participa-
tion. Written informed consent was obtained from each
participant.
Materials
The Defining Issues Test­2 (DIT-2).The DIT-2 (Rest, Nar-
vaez, Thoma, & Bebeau, 1999) measures individual varia-
tion in moral judgments. Participants are presented with five
moral dilemmas and respond to 12 statements offering dif-
ferent views to aid the process of moral decision making.
Responses on DIT-2 are calculated to produce a score that
fits within the three-level, neo-Kohlbergian model of moral
judgments: the lowest level, personal interest schema,
reflects moral judgments that are evaluated in relation to the
cost and benefits that may be directly experienced by the
individual. The second level is the maintaining norms
schema, where moral judgments reflect values, norms, and
rules that govern a social system. Third, the postconventional
schema is the highest level where moral judgments operate
on shared ideals, reciprocity, and openness to inquiry.
Historically, participants' moral development has been
indexed with the P-score, representing the proportion of
items selected that appeal to postconventional moral reason-
ing. More recently, N2 scores have been adopted as the pre-
ferred method of analysis because N2 scores estimate the
degree to which a participant prioritizes postconventional
statements, in addition to the proportion of those statements.
In other words, N2 scores reflect both the rating and ranking
of postconventional moral reasoning. Higher N2 scores indi-
cate higher levels of moral development. Both P-score and
N2 scores tend to be in the 30s for high school seniors and in
the 40s for college students (Bebeau, Rest, &
Narvaez, 2006).
The Disgust Scale­Revised (DS-R).The DS-R is a 25-item,
5-point, Likert-type scale that is used to detect individual
variation in the sensitivity to disgust. The scale is based on a
three-factor model of disgust that includes core disgust, ani-
mal reminders, and contamination. It is shown to be a valid
and reliable index of disgust, demonstrating a Cronbach's
alpha of .87 (van Overveld, de Jong, Peters, &
Schouten, 2011).
Procedures
All participants completed paper-and-pencil versions of the
measures in a group setting first completing the DS-R, then
completing the DIT-2. Freshman participants took the mea-
sures within the first month of class during a fall semester.
Senior participants completed the measures at the end of a
discipline-specific ethics course (Business Ethics). All pro-
cedures conformed to ethical guidelines and were approved
by the college's institutional review board (IRB).
Results
Raw data for the DIT-2 were sent to The Center for Ethical
Development at the University of Alabama for scoring. One
participant was purged from the analysis. Once returned, N2
4 SAGE Open
scores for each participant were entered into SPSS version
19.0. Descriptive statistics are presented in Table 3.
An independent-samples t test was conducted to compare
N2 scores between freshman (preethics) and seniors (posteth-
ics) with college status (freshman or senior) entered as the
independent variable and N2 scores entered as the dependent
variable. The test was statistically significant, t(43) = -2.79,
p  .01. In addition, moderate to large effect size (Cohen's
d = .78) was found for this analysis (Cohen, 1988). The
results indicate that seniors (M = 29.27, SD = 14.18) scored
significantly higher than freshman (M = 19.08, SD = 10.22)
on the DIT-2. The independent-samples t test revealed that
disgust sensitivity scores did not differ significantly between
freshman (M = 54.33, SD = 18.54) and seniors (M = 49.90,
SD = 17.22), t(43) = .83, ns; (Cohen's d = .30). To test the
relationship between disgust sensitivity and DIT-2 scores, a
bivariate Pearson Product­Moment correlation was com-
puted. The correlation between disgust sensitivity and N2
scores was not significant (r = ­.14, ns). This suggests that
college students' moral reasoning capacities increase after
exposure to a discipline-specific ethics course; however, dis-
gust sensitivity had no relationship to DIT-2 scores.
Discussion
We hypothesized that students who participated in a disci-
pline-specific ethics course would achieve higher levels of
moral reasoning as measured by the DIT-2 than incoming
students with no or limited exposure to business ethics. Our
prediction was supported, suggesting that gains in moral
development may be attributed to specific coursework in
business ethics. In addition, we hypothesized that individual
variation in disgust sensitivity would affect moral reasoning;
however, this prediction was not supported. These results
suggest that despite previous research demonstrating that
environmental conditions that elicit disgust make moral
assessments more severe, individual differences in disgust
sensitivity are not a significant source variation in N2 scores.
One interpretation of this finding is that moral development,
as measured by the DIT-2, is more influenced by cognitive
training and coursework in ethics course than by individual
personality characteristics, such as tolerance for disgust.
We used a between-subject design to assess the changes in
moral reasoning in undergraduate business and management
students that occur as a result of a discipline-specific ethics
course. Future studies using a within-subjects design that
uses the same participants over time would strengthen the
validity of our findings. Also, previous literature shows that
DIT-2 scores increase with age. We did not control for the
effects of age, but all but two of our participants were under
the age of 25.
Another question concerns whether or not gains in moral
reasoning are the result of the increased ability to employ
critical and/or analytical thinking that take place over the
course of college education. In the future, a control group
may be required to clarify whether moral reasoning gains
are due to the skills fostered in discipline-specific ethics
courses or due to a general increase in analytical and critical
thinking skills that occur over the course of undergraduate
education.
Finally, it is interesting to note that N2 scores for our sam-
ple were approximately 5 points lower than norms for under-
graduates (Dong, 2010). This variability may simply reflect
differences between college programs; however, an alterna-
tive explanation for this difference could be due to the order
in which the questionnaires were presented. Both groups
(freshman and seniors) completed the Disgust Sensitivity
Scale first. It is possible that exposure to this scale may have
activated the neural programs related to disgust, which may
have resulted in lower level moral judgments on the DIT-2.
We are currently investigating this possibility using a differ-
ent sample and counterbalancing the order of the
questionnaires.
The goal of this research was to identify best practices for
ethics education in business and to further aid our under-
standing of how individual factors, such as disgust sensitiv-
ity, can alter students' moral assessments. We found that
specific coursework in business ethics can produce a signifi-
cant gain in moral reasoning. These results suggest that in the
absence of strong moral intuitions, discipline-specific ethics
coursework can lead to more postconventional moral deci-
sion making.
