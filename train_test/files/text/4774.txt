Introduction
It remains unknown how specific agents compare with
respect to long-term cardiovascular (CV) effect as only
few,1 long-term head-to-head trials have compared the
effects of different diabetes drugs on CV outcomes or CV
surrogates, and most have been of relatively short duration
with insufficient statistical power. Furthermore, although,

Abstract
CARdiovascular Outcome Trial of LINAgliptin Versus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes (NCT01243424) is an ongoing,
randomized trial in subjects with early type 2 diabetes and increased cardiovascular risk or established complications that
will determine the long-term cardiovascular impact of linagliptin versus the sulphonylurea glimepiride. Eligible patients
were sulphonylurea-naïve with HbA1c
6.5%­8.5% or previously exposed to sulphonylurea (in monotherapy or in a
combination regimen <5years) with HbA1c
6.5%­7.5%. Primary outcome is time to first occurrence of cardiovascular
death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina. A total of 631 patients
with primary outcome events will be required to provide 91% power to demonstrate non-inferiority in cardiovascular
safety by comparing the upper limit of the two-sided 95% confidence interval as being below 1.3 for a given hazard ratio.
Hierarchical testing for superiority will follow, and the trial has 80% power to demonstrate a 20% relative cardiovascular
risk reduction. A total of 6041 patients were treated with median type 2 diabetes duration 6.2years, 40.0% female, mean
HbA1c 7.2%, 66% on 1 and 24% on 2 glucose-lowering agents and 34.5% had previous cardiovascular complications.
The results of CARdiovascular Outcome Trial of LINAgliptin Versus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes may influence the
decision-making process for selecting a second glucose-lowering agent after metformin in type 2 diabetes.

since 2007, new glucose-lowering agents are required by
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to demonstrate
CV safety before or after regulatory approval,2 most of
these CV outcome trials are conducted in a placebo-con-
trolled setting with no active comparators. Hence, they do
not allow an assessment of comparative effectiveness.
Particularly debated in this respect are sulphonylureas
(SUs) ­ frequently recommended as the preferred second-
line therapy ­ where some studies, first suggested by the
highly controversial University Group Diabetes Program
(UGDP) conducted in the 1960s,3 led to uncertainty about
their long-term CV safety, an effect perhaps related to
binding on the potassium adenosine triphosphate (KATP
)
channel in cardiac myocytes and other cells,4 but the
results of long-term randomized controlled trials (RCTs)
have not supported a deleterious CV effect of SUs.5,6
Dipeptidyl-peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors are oral
glucose-lowering agents for second-line therapy when
glycaemic control cannot be achieved with metformin or
as first-line therapy where metformin is contraindicated
or not tolerated.7 DPP-4 inhibitors are associated with the
benefits of significantly lowering blood glucose level
without the side effects of hypoglycaemia or weight gain,
two adverse effects that occur with SU.7,8 Linagliptin is a
once-daily, DPP-4 inhibitor with a xanthine-based struc-
ture that is characterized by a pharmacological profile
distinct from other drugs in this class,8 largely due to its
non-renal route of elimination (80% hepatic vs 5%
renal).9 Of interest, a 2-year randomized, double-blind
phase III trial comparing linagliptin versus glimepiride in
1519 patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) (HbA1c 6.5%­
10.0%) on metformin background therapy ­ designed to
assess the effects on glucose control ­ suggested a
reduced relative CV risk with linagliptin [0.46; 95% con-
fidence interval (CI) 0.23­0.91] for the composite CV
outcome of CV death, non-fatal myocardial infarction
(MI), non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable
angina [4-point major adverse CV events (4P-MACE)].10
Even though all CV events were prospectively adjudi-
cated, the study was a registration trial neither designed
nor powered to assess CV outcomes, and the overall
number of CV events was low (n=38). Nevertheless,
these findings are suggestive and provide the basis for the
hypothesis of a potential CV benefit of linagliptin over
glimepiride, which is currently being tested in the ongo-
ing CARdiovascular Outcome Trial of LINAgliptin
Versus Glimepiride in Type 2 Diabetes (CAROLINA®).
Methods
CAROLINA (clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT01243424)
is an ongoing, multicentre, randomized, double-blind,
active-controlled trial. It is designed to assess the effect of
linagliptin compared with glimepiride, in addition to stand-
ard of care, on CV events in adults with relatively early
T2D at increased CV risk or established CV complications
and with less than optimized glycaemic control. The study
protocol was approved by the respective Institutional
Review Boards, Independent Ethics Committees and
Competent Authorities according to national and interna-
tional regulations.
Trial population
Patients with T2D who were naïve to therapy or on a non-
insulin secretagogue (SU or glinide) with HbA1c
6.5%
and 8.5%, or currently being treated with an insulin
secretagogue (in monotherapy or in a dual combination
regimen<5years) with HbA1c
6.5% and 7.5%, and at
elevated risk of CV events according to specific criteria
(Table 1) were eligible for inclusion. Upon randomiza-
tion, if a patient was on a SU or glinide, this secretagogue
therapy was discontinued and replaced with study medi-
cation. For patients not on a secretagogue, study medica-
tion was added to the existing regimen. At screening, any
glucose-lowering background therapy should have been
stable for at least 8
weeks. No patients requiring insulin
therapy for glucose control were allowed in the trial.
Previous exposure to DPP-4 inhibitors, glucagon-like
peptide-1 (GLP-1) receptor agonists or thiazolidindiones
(TZDs) was exclusionary. Subjects were required at base-
line to have a body mass index (BMI)45kg/m2 and age
40­85years. Detailed inclusion and exclusion criteria are
listed in online Appendix 1.
Study design and follow-up
Eligible subjects underwent a 2- to 4-week, open-label,
placebo run-in period (Figure 1) during which background
glucose-lowering therapy was continued unchanged.
Following the run-in, patients still meeting the inclusion or
exclusion were randomly assigned 1:1 to receive linaglip-
tin 5mg, or glimepiride 1­4mg, once daily in addition to
their background therapy. After a starting dose of 1
mg/
day, glimepiride was up-titrated at 4-week intervals during
the first 16
weeks to a potential maximum dose of 4
mg/
day. The dose of glimepiride was increased if the fasting
self-monitored blood glucose (SMBG) values were
>110mg/dL (6.1mmol/L), unless the investigator consid-
ered that it would place the patient at an increased risk of
hypoglycaemia. The average of previous recent fasting
SMBG measurements (from the patient's diary) prior to
the day of visit could also be used to guide up-titration at
the discretion of the investigator. Of note, patients on pre-
vious glimepiride treatment were randomized to linaglip-
tin or to continue on their current dose (i.e. if the glimepiride
dose was 4
mg/day, the masked starting dose would be
4mg/day).
If applicable, patients are to continue their metformin
therapy (preferably >1500mg daily) and other background
166 Diabetes & Vascular Disease Research 12(3)
therapy throughout the trial with an unchanged dose unless
for medical emergencies or other patient safety reasons. To
ensure an adequate level of glycaemic control for partici-
pants, investigators could institute glycaemic rescue medi-
cation provided specific protocol criteria were met (details
in online Appendix 2). Investigators were also encouraged
to treat all other CV risk factors [lipids, blood pressure
(BP), albuminuria, unhealthy lifestyle and smoking) in the
context of local or regional guidance for primary or second-
ary CV prevention. Changes to medication were ultimately
left to the investigator's clinical judgement.
Patients are instructed to attend the clinic at pre-speci-
fied times (e.g. every 16th week in the maintenance phase)
over the duration of the study, including patients who pre-
maturely discontinue study drug. Irrespective of whether
on study drug or not, all patients are followed to capture
CV events. Attempts are consistently made to avoid miss-
ing data and prevent withdrawal of informed consent or
lost to follow-up that can compromise the integrity of the
study. All subjects will undergo a final visit during the
close-out period of the study and are to be followed-up for
adverse events (AEs) for a period of 30days after individ-
ual study completion (Figure 1).
Randomization and patient inclusion
Once inclusion criteria were confirmed, randomization
was undertaken using a computer-generated random
sequence and an interactive voice and web response sys-
tem, without any stratification, as is recommended for
large trials.11
Outcomes and adjudication
The primary outcome of the study is the time to first occur-
rence of CV death, non-fatal MI (excluding silent MI),
non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina, that
is, 4P-MACE.
Three key secondary outcomes were defined: (1) time
to the first occurrence of any of the classical 3P-MACE

Further secondary CV outcomes include the occurrence
and time to first event of a composite outcome of all inde-
pendently confirmed adjudicated events (individually out-
lined below as tertiary CV outcomes but excluding silent
MI), whereas tertiary CV outcomes are the occurrence of,
and time to, each of the following adjudicated events: CV
death (including fatal stroke and fatal MI), non-fatal MI,
non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, tran-
sient ischaemic attack (TIA), hospitalization for conges-
tive heart failure (CHF), composite of hospitalization for
or death from CHF, hospitalization for coronary revascu-
larization procedures and silent MI. All-cause mortality is
a tertiary outcome.
All CV outcome events and deaths are being prospec-
tively adjudicated by a Clinical Events Committee, as rec-
ommended in FDA guidelines.2 The study also has defined
several secondary diabetes-related outcomes [e.g. change
from baseline to final visit in HbA1c, urine albumin-to-
creatinine ratio (UACR) or transition in albuminuria cate-
gories], several tertiary diabetes-related outcomes as well
as other outcomes. In addition, a number of analyses from
dedicated sub-studies involving a subset of the study
cohort (Table 2) are defined. Definitions of the major clini-
cal outcomes are presented in online Appendix 3, and a
broader list of efficacy and safety outcomes is presented in
online Appendix 4.
Safety will be assessed based on AEs reported through-
out the study, clinical laboratory tests, vital signs, 12-lead
electrocardiogram, physical examination and the use of
rescue medication. Pre-specified AEs of special interest
include hypersensitivity reactions, skin lesions, renal AEs,
pancreatitis, pancreatic cancer and hepatic events.
Pancreatitis or pancreatic cancers are being adjudicated by
a group of independent external experts. For qualifying
events, relevant source documentation will be requested
including laboratory values, histological analysis, results
of imaging tests, hospital discharge letters and medical
reports from other physicians. All evaluations will be per-
formed in a blinded fashion.
Study oversight and organization
The trial was jointly designed by employees of Boehringer
Ingelheim (BI) and the academic investigators who are
members of the steering committee. The steering commit-
tee, which is led by the academic investigators and included
members who are employees of the sponsor, supervises the
trial design and operation. An independent data monitoring
committee (DMC) reviews interim safety data approxi-
mately every 90days or on an ad hoc basis on request. The
DMC will also perform two interim analyses (IAs) as dis-
cussed below. The data will be analysed by the sponsor and
also independently analysed and validated by independent
biostatisticians at L-Biostat at KU Leuven Research and

Development, Belgium. Interpretation and reporting of the
data and the decisions for publications will be conducted by
the steering committee.Alist of committees involved in the
trial conduct is presented in online Appendix 5.
Statistical considerations
Sample size and power calculations. The primary hypothe-
sis is that linagliptin is not inferior to glimepiride for the
incidence of 4P-MACE. This is by means of comparing
the upper limit of the two-sided repeated 95% CI at a non-
inferiority margin of 1.3, which is mandated by the FDA
for CV trials evaluating new therapies for T2D.2 This test
is the first in a five-step hierarchical testing strategy,
where a subsequent test is only performed in case of a
significant prior result: (1) non-inferiority test of the
primary outcome (4P-MACE), (2) superiority test of the
primary outcome (4P-MACE), (3) superiority test of key
secondary CV outcome (3P-MACE), (4) superiority test
ofthefirstkeysecondaryefficacyoutcome(HbA1c7.0%
without rescue medication, moderate or severe hypogly-
caemic episodes and >2% weight gain at final visit) and
(5) superiority test of the second key secondary efficacy
outcome (HbA1c

7.0% without rescue medication and
without >2% weight gain at final visit).
N
=
631 confirmed primary outcome events provides
91% power to show CV non-inferiority, if the underlying
hazard ratio (HR) for the incidence of the primary outcome
between the linagliptin and glimepiride groups is 1.0 for
the specified one-sided alpha of 2.5%. If 1-year event rates
are 2% in each treatment group, accrual time is 2
years,
follow-up time is 4.8years and the 1-year loss to follow-up
rate is 1.5%, enrolment of 6000 patients is projected to
yield the necessary number of events.
Furthermore, 631 patients with 4P-MACE provides
80% power to demonstrate superiority assuming a HR of
0.80, corresponding to a 20% risk reduction in 4P-MACE
for linagliptin as compared to glimepiride.
IAs. The DMC will perform two formal IAs of the primary
outcome after, respectively, 190 and 411, 4P-MACE
events have occurred. At each of these IAs, the trial could
be terminated if superiority for linagliptin is demonstrated
with respect to 4P-MACE and overall CV safety, with par-
ticular emphasis on CV mortality. Of note, at the second
formal IA, the trial may also be stopped for futility, if supe-
riority of glimepiride with respect to the primary outcome
can be shown prematurely or if a futility assessment shows
that the 1.3 non-inferiority margin likely will not be met,
based on a conditional power of less than 20%. The DMC
is the sole group with access to unblinded results.
To prevent an inflation of the significance level, a group
sequential design was chosen, where the O'Brien and
Fleming -spending function defines the allocation of the
one-sided overall significance level of 2.5% to the IA and
final analysis, and based on, respectively 190, 411 and 631
numbers of patients with 4P-MACE, the cumulative alpha
spent is 0.000043997, 0.005469768 and 0.025.
Analysis plan.The primary analysis will be performed on
the full analysis set (FAS). The FAS consist of all rand-
omized patients who were treated with at least one dose of
study drug. For the primary and secondary or tertiary CV
outcomes, a classical intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis on
the FAS will be done including all adjudicated and con-
firmed events which occur until study end. The time to
(first) event will be derived from the date of randomiza-
tion. Patients who do not experience an event during the
trial period will be censored at their last documented study
visit.
The analysis of primary and secondary or tertiary CV
outcomes will be based on a Cox's proportional hazards

regression with a term for treatment assignment included
in the model. The second and third composite key second-
ary outcomes will be analysed with a chi-square test.
For the primary outcome as well as the time to first
3P-MACE sensitivity analysis will be done based on
events occurring within the time patients are on-treatment
+30
days after permanent treatment discontinuation or
date of last documented study visit, whichever comes first.
Sensitivity analyses will be performed on the per protocol
set (PPS), which consists of patients included in the FAS
excluding those who have important protocol violations
(i.e. if it can be expected to have a distorting influence on
the assessment of the primary outcome and/or key second-
ary outcomes) as well as on the 30-day-treatment set,
including all randomized patients with a minimum treat-
ment duration of 30days.
To examine the degree of consistency of the overall
treatment effect, the primary and key secondary outcomes
will be explored in certain subgroups, including, but not
limited to, CV risk inclusion group (history of vascular
disease, evidence of vascular-related end-organ, elevated
age and CV risk factors), age, baseline BP, gender, prior
therapy with an insulin secretagogue, background therapy
of metformin, race and geographical region. These sub-
group analyses are considered as being of exploratory
nature, and analyses will not be adjusted for multiple com-
parisons. Further details on this are provided in online
Appendix 6.
Results
Patient recruitment and baseline characteristics
Recruitment into CAROLINA began in December 2010
and was completed in December 2012. On 12 March 2012,
the steering committee recommended to stop further
recruitment of patients solely fulfilling CV risk category
`d' (i.e. the lowest CV risk). In total, 10,639 patients were
screened, and 6051 were randomized at 606 clinical sites
in 43 countries. The main reason for screen failure was an
HbA1c value not meeting protocol specifications. Of those
randomized, 6041 were treated with study drug. Most par-
ticipants come from Europe (45.4%), 19.2% from North
America, 16.7% from Asia, 15.0% from South America,
2.2% from South Africa and 1.4% from New Zealand or
Australia. At baseline, the mean age of participants was
64
years with 14.0% aged 75
years. Sixty percent are
male, 73% are White and median T2D duration was
6.2years (40.6% 5years). At baseline, mean HbA1c
was
7.2%, with only 9.4% of participants having HbA1c
8.0%.
Mean±
standard deviation (SD) systolic BP was
136±
16
mmHg, diastolic BP 79
±10mmHg and pulse
rate 71
±
11
bpm, indicating that the BP was reasonably
well managed, with 88% of patients using any anti-hyper-
tensive therapies. Lipids were also well controlled [total
cholesterol 177
±44mg/dL, low-density lipoprotein
(LDL)-cholesterol 95
±36mg/dL, high-density lipopro-
tein (HDL)-cholesterol 48
±13mg/dL, median triglycer-
ide 144mg/dL (interquartile range: 105­198)] with 64% of
the overall study cohort taking a statin (74% in those with
existing CV complications). Acetylsalicylic acid was used
by half of all patients and in 80% of those with existing CV
complications.
At screening, 9.2% of participants were drug-naïve;
66% were receiving monotherapy (among whom 88.4%
were taking metformin), and 24% were receiving dual
therapy. In total, 82% of patients used metformin back-
ground medication at a mean±SD daily baseline dose of
1.6±
0.6
g. CAROLINA included patients based on four
CV risk categories [from low to high (Table 1)], and 34.5%
of the cohort had previous CV complications (MI: 13.8%,
coronary artery disease: 17.1%, stroke: 7.8% or peripheral
arterial occlusive disease: 5.5%), 8.5% had evidence of
vascular-related end-organ damage as defined by impaired
renal function [estimated glomerular filtration rate 30­
59mL/min/1.73m2 as defined by the Modified Diet of
Renal Disease Formula (MDRD), albuminuria (urinary
albumin:creatinine30
µg/mg in two out of three unre-
lated specimens] or proliferative retinopathy. An age
70years was the main inclusion criteria in 19.3% of sub-
jects, and 37.3% had multiple CV risk factors (without
having established CV complications). Further baseline
characteristics and key laboratory data of treated partici-
pants (FAS) according to baseline CV risk is provided in
Tables 3 and 4.
Discussion
The CAROLINA is an ongoing RCT designed to assess
whether linagliptin 5mg once daily is non-inferior, and if
so, superior compared with glimepiride 1­4mg once daily
with respect to CV events in adults with relatively early
T2D at increased risk of CV events and with less than opti-
mized glycaemic control. Given that medications of both
classes are currently advocated as second-line therapy
after metformin,7 and since SUs have been associated with
concerns regarding their CV safety2 while DPP-4 inhibi-
tors have been suggested to exhibit CV benefits in pre-
clinical and mechanistic trials,16 this study will provide
answers to several clinically relevant questions.
The CAROLINA study having selected a cohort with
early T2D (median duration 6.2years) and a mean base-
line HbA1c of 7.2% has the potential to adequately
answer the study question as two-thirds were on a mon-
otherapy regimen predominantly with metformin and
only 34.5% of subjects have established CV complica-
tion at study entry with just 13.8% having a previous
MI. Recently, the first two placebo-controlled CV out-
come trials (SAVOR-TIMI 5317 and EXAMINE18),
involving the DPP-4 inhibitors saxagliptin and

alogliptin, respectively, reported a neutral effect on a
composite of 3P-MACE. Of note, both of these studies
were relatively short in duration and drug exposure
(median follow-up, respectively, 2.1 and 1.5years) and
included patients predominantly, or exclusively, with
manifest CV complications. Whether a longer follow-up
would have led to a different result is not known; further
an hypothesis generating findings supporting the con-
cept of early intervention was seen in a subgroup analy-
sis of the EXAMINE trial,18 suggesting that patients
with a shorter duration of T2D seemed to have benefited
from alogliptin therapy as compared to those with a
longer duration.
An unexpected finding in the SAVOR-TIMI 53 trial
was a statistically significant increased risk for hospitali-
zation for CHF, associated with saxagliptin therapy, and a
recent analysis of data in EXAMINE for alogliptin sug-
gesting an increase in risk which was, however, not statis-
tically significant.19 CAROLINA will also address
through independent adjudication whether CHF hospitali-
zations are increased with linagliptin or glimepiride and
whether death due to CHF occurs more frequently. This
study will provide the greatest possible insight into
whether DPP-4 inhibitors hold advantages over SUs in
terms of CV outcomes, and despite other ongoing com-
parativeeffectivenessstudies,likeGRADE,20 CAROLINA
is the only active-controlled comparator trial sufficiently
powered to address CV outcomes. One interesting aspect
relates to the potential that hypoglycaemia, in particular
severe hypoglycaemia, may modulate and increase CV
risk.21 In a former study, it was demonstrated that hypo-
glycaemia occurred at lower incidence with linagliptin as
compared to glimepiride.10 However, the relative deleteri-
ous contribution of hypoglycaemia on MACE remains to
be fully elucidated, and CAROLINA will also be able to
address this.
Of note, in a recent pooled CV meta-analysis analysing
the comparative impact on CV events of SUs versus other
agents, an overall neutral effect on CV events versus total
comparators was reported [odds ratio (OR) 1.08 (95% CI:
0.86­1.36), p=0.52].22 However, when compared with
individual compounds (i.e. metformin, GLP-1 receptor
analogues, DPP-4 inhibitors and TZDs), a neutral effect
was reported for all classes of therapies except versus
DPP-4 inhibitors where the analysis suggested a benefit of
the latter [OR 0.54 (95% CI: 0.35­0.83), p=0.005 (93
events)]. It should be noted, however, that CAROLINA
also has its limitations, in particular since we do not
include a placebo arm to assess the independent effects of
linagliptin and glimepiride.
With 6041 patients randomized, CAROLINA will also
provide insights beyond CV outcomes from the sub-stud-
ies, where recent data indicate a potential role for DPP-4
inhibition, including impact on microvascular,23 renal
outcomes,24 cognitive function,12 long-term beta-cell
function14 and ambulatory glucose profiles13 and may
demonstrate further evidence on a recent observation of
potential beta-cell protection with linagliptin in latent
autoimmune diabetes in adults (LADA).15
In summary, the CAROLINA trial will help clarify
the CV safety and potential CV protection of long-term
linagliptin compared to glimepiride in early T2D pre-
dominantly on background metformin therapy. The out-
come of the CAROLINA trial may generate the most
robust evidence in the decision-making process for
selecting a second glucose-lowering agent after met-
formin in T2D.
