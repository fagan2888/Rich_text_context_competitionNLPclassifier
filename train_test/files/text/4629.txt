Abstract
Objectives: To assess the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and evaluate proinflammatory status
in patients with type 1 diabetes, and to analyse the relationship between inflammation, metabolic
control and insulin resistance in these patients.
Methods: Patients with type 1 diabetes were stratified according to the presence or absence of
metabolic syndrome. Serum adiponectin, leptin, tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a, interleukin (IL)-6
and high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP) were quantified.
Results: The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was 28.6% (22/77). Patients with metabolic
syndrome had lower adiponectin concentrations and higher leptin, TNF-a, IL-6 and hsCRP
concentrations compared with patients without metabolic syndrome. In addition, metabolic
syndrome was associated with higher glycosylated haemoglobin and insulin dose, and increased
insulin resistance.
Conclusions: The proinflammatory state associated with metabolic syndrome in patients with
type 1 diabetes leads to deterioration of glycaemic control and an increase in the required daily
dose of insulin. Early and proactive diagnosis of metabolic syndrome in these patients will allow
medication and lifestyle optimization, in order to prevent the occurrence of diabetes complications
and improve health-related quality-of-life.

Introduction
The presence of metabolic syndrome signifi-
cantly increases cardiovascular risk1,2 and
impaired glycaemic control.3 The World
Health Organization first described meta-
bolic syndrome in 1998 as a condition
characterized by several risk factors, which
together have increased predictive power
for the development of impaired glycaemic
control and atherosclerotic disease, com-
pared with each factor taken separately.4
Metabolic syndrome has been associated
with both type 2 and type 1 diabetes
mellitus, thereby augmenting cardiovascular
risk even in younger patients with type 1
diabetes.5­7
Patients with metabolic syndrome have
increased abdominal adipose tissue, espe-
cially visceral fat.8 Visceral adipocytes have
intense secretory activity and can be con-
sidered equivalent to endocrine organs.9
Obesity is associated with increased adipo-
cyte secretion of factors that reduce insulin-
mediated glucose uptake, including free
fatty acids and proinflammatory cytokines
such as tumour necrosis factor (TNF)-a,
interleukin (IL)-b1, and IL-6.10 Obesity is
also associated with low levels of adiponec-
tin (the only adipocytokine that increases
insulin-mediated glucose uptake), and has
an anti-inflammatory action.11,12 Cytokines
released by adipose tissue are involved in
initiating and promoting a proinflammatory
status, contributing to greater insulin resist-
ance and cardiovascular risk.9,13,14 Leptin
and adiponectin decrease triglyceride syn-
thesis, promoting the catabolism of fatty
acids and enhancing insulin action in both
skeletal muscle and liver.15 In patients with
obesity, leptin levels are increased and
adiponectin levels are decreased, suggesting
that obesity leads to a state of leptin resist-
ance and adiponectin deficiency.15 Cell
exposure to TNF-a stimulates inhibitory
phosphorylation of the serine residues of
insulin receptor substrate 1, which is recog-
nized as the major pathway in insulin
resistance promotion.16 TNF-a is an import-
ant link between inflammation, obesity
and insulin resistance.17 IL-6 reduces the
expression of insulin receptor substrate 1 via
extracellular signal-regulated kinases,
thereby impairing insulin signalling and
action.18 High sensitivity C-reactive protein
(hsCRP; the most important acute-phase
protein) also plays a role in leptin resistance
by acting as a leptin-interacting protein.
In addition, CRP is considered to be
an important link between atheroscler-
osis, cardiovascular disease and insulin
resistance.18
Studies have described an increased
prevalence of abdominal obesity and meta-
bolic syndrome in children and adults with
type 1 diabetes, suggesting an association
between metabolic syndrome, insulin resist-
ance, and the risk of developing chronic
diabetes complications in these people.19­21
The primary aim of the present study was
to assess the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome in patients with type 1 diabetes
mellitus. In addition, proinflammatory
status was evaluated by quantifying each
patient's adiponectin, leptin, TNF-a, IL-6
and hs-CRP concentrations, and the rela-
tionship between proinflammatory status
and quality of metabolic control, daily
insulin dose, and prevalence of diabetes
complications was examined.

Patients and methods
Study population
The study enrolled patients with type 1
diabetes, treated between April 2012 and
May 2013 at the Diabetes Clinic of the
Emergency Hospital, Timisoara, Romania.
Inclusion criteria were aged <45 years;
basal­bolus insulin analogue monotherapy
(without any other antidiabetic or insulin
sensitizer agents). Data regarding history of
diabetes, daily insulin requirement (per kg
body weight), dietary habits, alcohol
intake, smoking profile and physical activ-
ity were obtained from medical records.
Height, weight, blood pressure (according
to European Society of Cardiology
Guidelines22) and abdominal and hip cir-
cumference were measured for each patient;
body mass index (BMI; kg/m2) and waist-to-
hip ratio (WHR) were calculated. Metabolic
syndrome was diagnosed according to
AHA/NHLBI 2009 consensus criteria.23
All patients provided written informed
consent and the study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of the Emergency
Hospital, Timisoara, Romania.
Laboratory analyses
Peripheral blood (5 ml) was taken from
each patient after an overnight fast, for
quantification of concentrations of
serum triglyceride, total cholesterol,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein choles-
terol (LDL-C) (all via enzymatic methods),
glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA1c) (immu-
noturbidimetric method; Abbot Architect
c8000 clinical chemistry analyser, Abbot
Laboratories, Irving, TX, USA), adiponec-
tin, leptin, TNF-a, IL-6 (all via enzyme-
linked immunosorbent assay, Biovendor
Laboratory Medicine, Candler, NC, USA),
and hs-CRP (nephelometry method). Insulin
resistance was assessed using the estimated
glucose disposal rate (eGDR), according to
the following formula: eGDR ¼ 24.31­
(12.22 Â WHR)­(3.29 Â presence of hyper-
tension: 0 for no and 1 for yes)­
(0.57 Â HbA1c) (mg Â kgÀ1 Â minÀ1). There
is an inverse correlation between insulin
resistance and eGDR.24
Statistical analyses
Data were presented as mean Æ SD (for
continuous variables with Gaussian distri-
bution), median (interquartile range [IQR];
for continuous variables without Gaussian
distribution), or n (%) (categorical vari-
ables). The 95% confidence intervals for
prevalence were calculated according to
Wilson's procedure.
Patients were stratified according to the
presence or absence of metabolic syndrome.
Between-group comparisons were made
using Student's t-test, Mann­Whitney
U-test or 2-test with Yates correction, as
appropriate. The distribution of continuous
variables was tested for normality using
Shapiro­Wilk test and Levene's test for
equality of variances. Pearson's correlation
coefficient was used to evaluate correlations
and regression strength in the study popu-
lation as a whole, with statistical significance
assessed using t-distribution test.
Statistical analyses were performed using
SPSSÕ version 17.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL,
USA) for WindowsÕ. P-values <0.05 were
considered statistically significant.
Results
The study included 77 patients with type
diabetes (37 [48.1%] male/40 [51.9%]
female; mean age 34 Æ 8 years; age range
21­55 years). Clinical and demographic
characteristics of the study population are
shown in Table 1.
A total of 22/77 (28.6%) patients were
diagnosed with metabolic syndrome (12/40
[30.0%] female vs 10/37 male [27.0%]; dif-
ference not statistically significant).

Median age was significantly higher in
patients with metabolic syndrome than in
those without (36 [5] vs 32 [7]; P ¼ 0.022). As
expected, there were significant between-
group differences in all criteria included in
the definition of metabolic syndrome
(P < 0.0001 for each comparison; Table 2).
Data regarding adiponectin and lep-
tin concentrations are shown in Table 3.
Adiponectin concentrations were signifi-
cantly lower and leptin concentrations sig-
nificantly higher in patients with metabolic
syndrome compared to those without
(P < 0.0001 for both comparisons). There
was a significant inverse correlation between
serum adiponectin levels and BMI in both
males (r ¼ À0.61; P < 0.001) and females
(r ¼ À0.54; P < 0.001). Serum leptin values
correlated directly and significantly with
BMI in both male (r ¼ 0.77; P < 0.001) and
female (r ¼ 0.72; P < 0.001) patients.
Patients with metabolic syndrome had
significantly higher TNF-a, IL-6 and hs-
CRP concentrations (P < 0.0001 for each
comparison; Table 3), decreased eGDR
(increased insulin resistance; P ¼ 0.037),
increased HbA1c (P ¼ 0.009) and higher
insulin dose (P < 0.001) than patients with-
out metabolic syndrome (Table 3).
Body mass index was positively corre-
lated with TNF-a and IL-6 in both male
patients (r ¼ 0.55, P < 0.001 and r ¼ 0.51,
P < 0.001, respectively) and female patients
(r ¼ 0.56, P < 0.001 and r ¼ 0.53, P < 0.001,
respectively).
Concentrations of TNF-a, IL-6 and
hs-CRP were inversely correlated with adi-
ponectin concentrations, and directly corre-
lated with leptin concentrations (Table 4).
Discussion
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome in
patients with type 1 diabetes in the present
study was similar to that found in the
general population,25,26 in spite of the rela-
tively young age of our study group. This
suggests that metabolic syndrome is more
prevalent at younger ages in patients with
type 1 diabetes than in the general popula-
tion of a similar age group. The presence of
metabolic syndrome in patients with type 1
diabetes was associated with increased insu-
lin resistance and proinflammatory state in
the present study. This leads to a premature
increase in global cardiovascular risk,2,27,28
rendering young patients with type 1 dia-
betes as vulnerable to cardiovascular disease
as the older population without diabetes.
Metabolic syndrome is less common in
patients with type 1 diabetes than in those
with type 2 diabetes,29 possibly because

concentrations compared with patients
without metabolic syndrome. A proinflam-
matory state promotes insulin resistance and
increases cardiovascular risk.2,3,8,32 In add-
ition, the presence of metabolic syndrome in
patients with type 1 diabetes promotes
insulin resistance and leads to increased
insulin requirements, with subsequent
deterioration of glycaemic control and
weight gain.33
Adiponectin concentrations were inver-
sely correlated with BMI and proinflamma-
tory cytokine (TNF-a and IL-6) and
inflammatory marker (hs-CRP) concentra-
tions in the present study. This finding
underlines the important role of adiponectin
in reducing inflammation the atherogenic
process, which is known to have a consider-
able inflammatory component.34 Leptin was
elevated in the presence of metabolic syn-
drome in the present study and was directly
correlated with BMI. This suggests that
abdominal obesity (a characteristic of meta-
bolic syndrome) is associated with hyperlep-
tinaemia, and that these patients may
have developed leptin resistance. IL-6 and
TNF-a are correlated with abdominal obes-
ity,35 thus linking obesity and metabolic
syndrome in type 1 diabetes to proinflam-
matory status and atherosclerosis.
The present study is unusual in that it
analyses the relationship between metabolic
syndrome, adipocytokines, glycaemic con-
trol and inflammation in adults (median age
34 years) with type 1 diabetes. Other studies
have generally focused on children or
younger adults.36 The inflammatory and
metabolic states of patients with type 1
diabetes and metabolic syndrome in the
present study were similar to patients of a
similar age with type 2 diabetes.37 In add-
ition, the present study assessed directly the
relationship between the components of
metabolic syndrome and adipocytokines
and glycaemic control.
In conclusion, the proinflammatory state
associated with metabolic syndrome in
patients with type 1 diabetes leads to further
deterioration of glycaemic control and an
increase in the daily dose of insulin needed.
Since the development of chronic diabetic
complications is strictly related to the qual-
ity of glycaemic control, the presence of
metabolic syndrome would lead to an
increased risk of developing chronic com-
plications. Early and proactive diagnosis of
