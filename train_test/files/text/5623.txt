Introduction
Although the rate of adolescent pregnancy has declined from
61.8 per 1,000 women in 1991 to 29.4 in 2012, the United
States still has one of the highest rates of adolescent preg-
nancy of any high-income country (Hamilton, Martin, &
Ventura, 2013). Despite the decline, adolescent pregnancy is
a major concern in public health according to the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC; 2014). Adolescent
pregnancy has been associated with a number of negative
social, psychological, developmental, and health outcomes
for both the mothers and their children (CDC, 2014). One of
the negative outcomes for mothers is a reduced likelihood of
completing a high school diploma or a university degree,
which limits their future employment potential (Escamilla &
Santhiveeran, 2005; Perper, Peterson, & Manlove, 2010).
Attainment of a high school or college degree is important
because of the correlation between educational attainment
and earning potential through one's lifetime. For example,
adults with advanced degrees earn 4 times more than those
with less than a high school diploma ("Educational
Attainment in the United States," 2012). Escamilla and
Santhiveeran's (2005) longitudinal study pointed to long-
term disadvantages for women who gave birth before the age
of 20, including lower levels of educational attainment and
employment in addition to higher rates of poverty and use of
public assistance. Furstenberg's (2003) research asserted that
young parenting affects work resulting in less time employed,
lower paying positions, increased likelihood to be supported
through public assistance, and difficulties with balancing
parenting with work.
Researchers and policy makers alike have focused on the
devastating effects of adolescent pregnancy and parenthood.
Thus, we were interested in understanding the aspirations of
pregnant and parenting adolescents and the structural and
social barriers that they view as obstacles to achieving their
aspirations.
Although much has been written regarding the long-term
detrimental effects of adolescent pregnancy, some research-
ers have challenged the causal links between adolescent
pregnancy and negative life outcomes (Barr & Simons, 2012;

Building a "Better Life": The
Transformative Effects of Adolescent
Pregnancy and Parenting
Colleen O'Brien Cherry1, Neale Chumbler1, Jennifer Bute2,3,
and Amber Huff4
Abstract
Adolescent pregnancy is often described as a major concern in public health and is associated with negative outcomes for
educational and career attainment. Our objective was to compare the future aspirations of pregnant and parenting adolescents
and identify social or structural barriers that they experience in their daily lives using journal entries from pregnant and
parenting adolescents. The journals, which served as primary data sources, were completed by 52 multi-ethnic pregnant and
parenting adolescents aged 15 to 19 in Indiana. Both pregnant and parenting adolescents aspired to provide a "better life" for
their children that included finishing school and obtaining a career. An emergent theme is that the experience of pregnancy
and parenting is transformative and may invoke a positive refocusing of life aspirations for educational and career attainment.
However, social stigma and barriers exist that make achieving educational and employment opportunities difficult. The study
findings indicate that pregnant and parenting adolescents need strong social support networks and practical tools to help
harness their motivation and transcend social and material barriers to achieve their goals and aspirations.

Studies have found that adolescent pregnancy is more likely
a consequence rather than a cause of economic and social
disadvantage (Barr & Simons, 2012; SmithBattle 2007b). In
other words, pregnancy is not the impetus for the correlated
negative "outcomes" of adolescent pregnancy, but rather,
adolescent pregnancy is a reflection of the social context in
which the pregnancy takes place (Barr & Simons, 2012;
Geronimus, 2003; SmithBattle, 2007b).
Researchers have typically used quantitative or quasi-
experimental research designs when comparing aspirations
and educational attainment between adolescent and older
mothers (Geronimus, 2003; Salusky, 2013). Quantitative
research often overlooks the political, economic, and cultural
contexts that may elucidate the structural challenges that
erode aspirations. Researchers have called for more qualita-
tive studies that focus on the voices of adolescent women
from an emic perspective (Geronimus, 2003; Salusky, 2013;
SmithBattle, 2007b) and that identify the structural barriers
that may be the impetus for aspirational changes and lower-
ing of expectations (Barr & Simons, 2012).
SmithBattle (2007b) and others (Geronimus, 2003;
Salusky, 2013) have identified the disconnect between how
health care professionals, scholars, and the general public see
pregnancy influencing the lives of adolescents versus how
adolescents see pregnancy affecting their own lives.
SmithBattle (2007b) observed that the anticipation of moth-
erhood led adolescents to reevaluate and refocus their priori-
ties, often motivating them to want to complete school. In
SmithBattle's study, she found transformed life meaning and
priorities and a greater importance placed on school and
careers for pregnant and parenting mothers. In fact, regard-
less of the adolescents'school status prior to their pregnancy,
the anticipation of motherhood was an impetus for motivat-
ing them to remain in or return to school, improve grades,
and gain a new interest in attending college (SmithBattle,
2007b).
Despite the newfound motivation that motherhood may
impart, adolescent pregnant and parenting mothers face
many structural barriers that limit school and college attain-
ability as well as societal sanctions like stigma and social
disgrace (Chumbler, Sanetmatsu, & Parrish-Sprowl, 2014).
For instance, some adolescent mothers find themselves with
little social support or preparation for new parenting.
Furthermore, high schools and colleges often do not have
affordable child care, which may further discourage atten-
dance. Competing demands of a new mother post-birth often
thwart aspirations and lead to more realistic or lowering of
career and vocational related expectations (Hellenga, Aber,
& Rhodes, 2002). However, not all adolescents exhibit low-
ered expectations. Hellenga et al. (2002) found that young
mothers with greater access to economic and social resources
post-birth did not have a lowering of aspirations and expecta-
tions after childbirth. Early interventions that provide social
support and services such as counseling, child care, and sup-
port groups may prevent parenting adolescents from lower-
ing their expectations for school and career.
The literature suggests conflicting findings regarding
whether adolescent motherhood motivates young mothers to
graduate high school or attend college or whether it lessens
their educational aspirations (Barr and Simons, 2012). One
way that researchers have evaluated the effect of adolescent
pregnancy on the lives of young women is by comparing their
educational and career attainment pre- and post-birth. These
studies differentiate between educational and career aspira-
tions and expectations. Aspirations are desired career goals
given ideal conditions while expectations take into account
factors that may hinder reaching one's aspirations (Baly,
1989). Scholars have also referred to this pairing as "abstract"
versus "concrete" attitudes toward education (Barr & Simons,
2012). For example, SmithBattle found mismatched aspira-
tions and expectations in their study with adolescent mothers
having both a newfound desire to attend college and conflict-
ing structural factors regarding work or child care responsi-
bilities that interfered with their ability to do so (SmithBattle
2007a). Barr and Simons (2013) found similar aspirations
between pregnant and parenting adolescents, but lowered
expectations for completing college for parenting adoles-
cents. Clemmens (2003) referred to this lowering of expecta-
tions as "the reality of motherhood brings hardship."
Clemmens found that many mothers found motherhood more
demanding than they had planned and that child care activi-
ties left little time for themselves. In Rosengard, Pollock,
Weitzen, Meers, and Phipps's (2006) study of pregnant ado-
lescents, a prominent theme was that adolescents thought that
pregnancy would require them to put their lives on hold and
revise their life goals. This perception occurred 86% of the
time with adolescents who had previous children compared
with 74% who were pregnant without previous children.
The original purpose of the journaling program was part of
a larger project in Lake County, Indiana, that was focused on
communicating health information to pregnant and parenting
adolescents while also providing participants with a means of
self-expression (Bute et al., 2014). In Lake County, the teen
birthrate per 1,000 population in women aged 15 to 19 is
slightly higher than the national average (37.3 in Indiana,
compared with 29.4 on average in the United States; Hamilton
et al., 2013). Once the seat of a thriving steel industry, the
region was devastated by deindustrialization during the 1970s
and 1980s and over the past couple of decades has struggled
with high rates of crime and unemployment. Studying adoles-
cent pregnancy in this region of Indiana provides key insights
into other low-income urban environments with similar
sociodemographic composition and fertility patterns.
Two of the authors of this article were involved in the design
and implementation of the journaling project from its begin-
ning. Preliminary analysis of the data (see Bute et al., 2014)
revealed that pregnant and parenting adolescents focused many
of their journal entries on their motivations and aspirations for
a "better life." Their focus provided a unique opportunity to
Cherry et al. 3
explore aspirational differences, if any, between pregnant and
parenting participants. Because the literature reports both nega-
tive and positive effects related to pregnancy and motherhood,
and distinguishes between pre- and post-birth women, our
objective was to contrast the aspirations of pregnant adoles-
cents with those of parenting adolescents and to identify the
structural and social barriers that both groups of young women
view as obstacles to achieving their aspirations.
Method and Analysis
Design
This study used journal entries to solicit the voices of preg-
nant and parenting adolescents. Fifty-two multi-ethnic preg-
nant and parenting adolescents from Lake County, Indiana,
participated in the journal project. To address adolescent
pregnancy on a local level in the state of Indiana, the Maternal
and Child Health (MCH) Division of the Indiana State
Department of Health (ISDH) created the Pregnant and
Parenting Adolescent Support Services (PPASS) program to
promote the development of integrated systems of support
services for pregnant and parenting adolescents and their
families. The journals used in this analysis were part of a joint
initiative between PPASS, Indiana University­Purdue
University Indianapolis (IUPUI), and Empowering Teens As
Parents (ETAP), an agency serving pregnant and parenting
adolescents in Lake County, Indiana, who were a key com-
munity implementation partner and who assisted with recruit-
ing pregnant and parenting adolescents (Bute et al., 2014).
In 2011, ISDH and IUPUI conducted research to evaluate
various means of communicating health information to ado-
lescents on pregnancy, prenatal care, and early parenting.
Journals were identified as an effective communication tool
and an outlet for stress. Journaling is also a valid method-
ological means of obtaining data on pregnant and parenting
adolescents' concerns regarding pregnancy and early parent-
ing (Bute et al., 2014). Journals are an innovative research
method because they allow for real-time reflection during
pregnancy and parenting, which may elicit different
responses than interviews conducted at a later date. There is
also a certain level of anonymity involved with journal writ-
ing that does not occur during a one-on-one or group inter-
view. Journaling is associated with a list of benefits, including
greater self-awareness and confidence, reduced stress and
anxiety, improved mood, improved physical health, a better
understanding of major life events, and the development of a
conduit for improving communication with a counselor (see
Baikie & Wilhelm, 2005; Pennebaker & Seagal, 1999).
Sampling and Recruitment
The study sample was purposive and drawn from a list of
clients at ETAP who were invited by ETAP staff to partici-
pate in the study. The participants were young women aged
15 to 19. Participation was solicited for both pregnant and
parenting adolescents. Thirty-one participants were recruited
in Week 1 and 21 participants in Week 2 for a total of 52
study participants. The recruitment procedure consisted of
the reading of a script to potential participants that described
the purpose of the study and what would be expected of
study participants. Each potential participant who wished to
continue provided her signature on an informed consent doc-
ument. Those participants under age 18 signed an informed
assent form and their parents submitted a signed waiver of
parental consent. This procedure was approved by the
Institutional Review Board (IRB). All participants received a
US$25 gift card upon enrollment, and an additional US$25
gift card upon completion of the project.
Demographics
Demographic information was collected from all participants
and is included in Table 1. The majority of participants were
between the ages of 15 and 17. Hispanic individuals made up
the largest portion of our enrolled participants. Sixty-one
percent of the participants were already parents. The major-
ity of the participants were enrolled as students. Only 25% of
the participants were employed in either full- or part-time
work. The primary source of income for 67% of the partici-
pants was their parents.
Journal Composition
The journal format was a portable paper binder divided into
five sections that included quizzes, writing prompts, draw-
ing exercises, guided journaling, and free journaling. The

journal content was informed by ETAP curriculum on early
parenting and PPASS priorities and goals (Bute et al.,
2014). Topics included concerns of day-to-day parenting,
stress, aspirations, goal setting, and future plans. The jour-
nals included prompts such as "Things I like about parent-
ing," "The hardest part of my life . . . , " and "I feel strong
when . . ." as well as free writing sections. The journals
were given the name For Real because one of the goals of
the journaling project was for the adolescents to have a self-
reflexive platform to be upfront and honest and to voice
their ideas, emotions, and concerns about pregnancy and
new parenthood.
Data Collection
The project data consisted of demographic information and
the written journals. Journal writing took place over a 6-week
period. For the purpose of this article, we include the demo-
graphic data and the journal entries as primary data sources.
Although comparisons between pregnant and parenting ado-
lescents were not the original focus of this study, aspirations
regarding school and future career plans were a recurring
theme in the journals, prompting us to look deeper into the
influence of the maternal role on educational and vocational
aspirations.
The journals were scanned and saved electronically as pdf
files, which were then uploaded into NVivo qualitative data
analysis software. Two of the authors (deemed data analysts
herein) who are trained in ethnographic research methods
conducted the data analysis. The data analysts used a deduc-
tive­inductive coding strategy following Paolisso, Weeks,
and Packard (2013) to create a codebook that they used to
organize the journal data by themes. The first-level code list
was conducted deductively, based on previous thematic anal-
ysis of the data (Bute et al., 2014) and dominant themes pre-
sented in the literature on pregnant and parenting adolescents.
The previous themes that were identified in the journals cre-
ated a preliminary deductive framework, which the data ana-
lysts used to build the overarching themes of the codebook.
Examples of these previous themes were "social support
sources" and "goals and dreams." The analysts subsequently
created a second-level codebook based on inductive analysis
that captured implicit themes and details that emerged while
reading a random sample of six journals. The second-level
codes expanded upon themes such as "goals and dreams"
with more detailed codes describing aspirations for complet-
ing school, going to college, or obtaining careers. These
second-level codes were discussed and edited by the two
analysts and further refined in cases of disagreement or
redundancy. The remaining journals were then split equally
between the two analysts and coding was completed on all
52 journal texts until both the analysts agreed that thematic
saturation had been met. The two analysts met on a weekly
basis to discuss themes and codes, and as new codes and sub-
codes emerged, they were added to the project.
Once coding was completed in NVivo, one of the analysts
generated "matrix queries" using NVivo to explore similari-
ties and differences in school and career aspirations between
pregnant and parenting adolescents. Query results were used
by the analysts to identify relevant excerpts from partici-
pants' written responses that represented prominent themes
across the journals and that best illustrated similarities and
differences between pregnant and parenting adolescents. The
participant data were divided by the attribute "pregnant" or
"parenting." If a participant was both pregnant and parent-
ing, she was included in the "parenting" group. Queries were
written and run on codes of interest such as "better life" or
"college future" to look for similarities and differences.
Results
Aspirations and Positive Motivation Expressed by
Pregnant and Parenting Adolescents
We found pregnant and parenting adolescents had similar
aspirations toward finishing school and establishing careers.
Aspirations, which centered on providing a "better life" for
the baby and long-term goals (initiated by the journal prompt
"Five years from now right after I wake up/at noon/at 4:30
p.m./at 8:00 p.m. I will . . . "), involved finishing high school,
attending college, starting a career, and establishing financial
independence. Long-term goals were often vague and did not
include explicit steps for achievement. Pregnant and parent-
ing adolescents stressed several positive effects of their new
maternal role that included positive self-image and confi-
dence in their abilities. Both pregnant and parenting adoles-
cents also voiced concern with stigma and competing
demands that may ultimately hinder their goals. Results are
reported according to theme and presented using the terms
"pregnant participants" and "parenting participants" herein.
"A Better Life for My Baby"
Both pregnant and parenting adolescents aspire to provide a
"better life" for their children and made similar statements
about what this means to them. Activities and aspirations
framed as contributing to a "better life" were described as
spending time with their children, giving their children
everything they want and need, and being a good role model.
One pregnant participant wrote, "My child will have
everything I am able to give her." In many cases, the "every-
thing" referred to both social and monetary support. For
example, one pregnant adolescent wrote, "I want to get a
good job to make money for my baby." A parenting partici-
pant wrote she wanted to be able to provide her child with
"help, support, and money."
Support sometimes referred to having both a mother and
father present in the child's life. One pregnant participant
wrote, "My baby would have everything he ever needed. I
also want him to have a mother and a father his whole life."
Cherry et al. 5
For another parenting participant, the importance of having
the father in her baby's life was stressed. She wrote,
I think that more people and programs need to educate and help
the fathers as well and it might make more men become bigger
role models in their child's life and make them want to be around
more. I believe it might help stop kids from growing up without
their dads around and in their life.
Another parenting adolescent wrote,
I don't feel like my son's father cares for my son as much as he
should. He doesn't call or text to ask about him. My son only
sees him five days out of the month if that.
Only about half of the pregnant and parenting adolescents
in the study wrote about having a supportive partner in their
lives and this reflects the 41% of children reportedly living in
single-parent households in Lake County (Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation [RWJF] and University of Wisconsin
Population Health Institute, 2013). Some women voiced
concern about the prospect of single parenthood. One parent-
ing adolescent stated, "How I'm going to raise him on my
own as a single mother? How will he have the best life pos-
sible?" One parenting adolescent said, "Things that would
make parenting easier: A better father in his life." Being on
their own without the financial or social support of the baby's
father or a partner was a prominent theme when the partici-
pants were discussing barriers to providing a "better life" for
their children.
Both pregnant and parenting adolescents made references
to making sure that their children "got the things that they
never got," or never received or experienced while growing
up. One parenting participant wrote about her priority: "I like
that I can teach my son things I never learned." Both preg-
nant and parenting adolescents expressed overwhelming
desire for their children to have opportunities and succeed in
life. One parenting participant wrote that her greatest desire
for herself was "being able to make sure I become something
in life." School was often included in the participants'
descriptions of a "better life." A parenting participant stated,
"If I could have anything in the world I would want to have
my diploma because I can't make a better life for my child
without school."
"You Have to Have Diplomas"
The acknowledgment of the importance of school for
obtaining a career and ultimately providing a better life for
their child was a prominent theme in the journals.
Participants' statements express that pregnancy and parent-
ing are indeed inspirations for some to reenroll in school or
complete school and to pursue a career despite adverse cir-
cumstances or difficulties that come with being a young
parent. One parenting participant wrote that her son "is a
huge inspiration in my life. He makes me want to exceed
the limits in life, with school and work. I'm very dedicated
to him and just for him."
The anticipation of motherhood was motivational for
some of the participants, and educational attainment was
widely stated by pregnant and parenting participants as a
vital component of providing a better life for their child. A
parenting participant wrote, "This week I'm proud that I
scheduled my college classes and scheduled my orientation
so I will be ready in August." Finishing high school and
attending college were particular priorities stated by both
groups. This is particularly important given the statistics in
Lake County, Indiana, where just over half of residents will
ever attend college (RWJF, 2013).
Another pregnant participant wrote, "I might just go
through the accelerated program at school and graduate
early. I have more than enough credits, I could probably even
have my diploma before my due date!" Maternal success was
perceived as translating to the success of her children. For
example, a parenting participant wrote, "The important thing
is go to school, get that education for you and your child. Go
to college and become somebody. Your child will follow
your footsteps!"
When answering the prompt "Five years from now . . . , "
several of the pregnant participants described college and
careers as part of their long-term goals before having another
baby. One parenting participant wrote, "I plan to have another
child when I'm done with college and starting a good career."
Another parenting participant wrote, "I plan to have another
child when my career is on track." When responding to the
question "describe a day in your life" which prompted them
to speculate about what they would be doing in the future,
this parenting participant described her life as follows:
"Around noon I will be at the hospital helping a young teen
through labor like the nurses at the hospital helped me when
I was having my baby."
Among both pregnant and parenting participants, profes-
sional aspirations overwhelmingly involved careers in medi-
cal professions. Obtaining a college degree or completing a
vocational­technical program will be necessary for many
participants, several of whom described plans to become a
nurse, doctor, or ultrasound technician because they want to
help people as they were helped during their pregnancy and/
or birth. A parenting participant wrote,
I can't wait to be a RN in an ER . . . helping others as I've always
aspired. Someday my kids will be proud of me, thankful for me
and love me for all the hardships I go through for them.
Another parenting participant explained, "My dream job
is to be an RN of an ER room. So far the plan is in action. I'm
a CNA at a hospital already." However, this type of short-
term action plan to accomplish her longer term goals was the
exception. Most of the participants who wrote about their
desire to finish school and attend college did not include an
action plan in their description.
6 SAGE Open
"Being Strong" and Social Stigma
The majority of mothers responded "yes" when asked whether
they "feel strong right now" in the journals. Several partici-
pants wrote explicitly about being strong in all areas of their
life and having a positive self-image to achieve their goals.
One parenting participant wrote that for her, strong means
"Independent, getting things done. Not having to rely on peo-
ple for everything. Never giving up on herself. Powerful."
One parenting participant described "strong" as "Taking care
of two kids by yourself and finishing school early!" A preg-
nant participant stated, "I feel strong when I think of becom-
ing a parent." Another pregnant adolescent wrote, "Strong is
not only how tough you are, or how much muscles you have
it's also about how you carry yourself, keep your head up,
believe in yourself and always think positive."
The pregnant and parenting adolescents voiced a need for
"being strong" due to social stigma. Several of the pregnant
and parenting participants voiced concerns over the negative
stigma attached to adolescent pregnancy and parenthood. A
pregnant participant wrote about what frustrates her most:
"rude stares and judgmental comments." Another pregnant
participant wrote, "I really wanna drop my summer classes. I
took them because this way I won't have to take them during
the school year. But everybody stares at my belly and I FEEL
the negativity there."
Post-birth, participants also experienced stigma as young
mothers. One parenting participant wrote, "The hardest part
of my life is struggling with the constant critique of being a
teen mother." Another wrote, "It's hard, being a teen mother
and taking so much criticism and being judged 24/7."
Even though about half of the participants described not
having a supportive partner, many still felt motivated to
achieve their goals on their own.Apregnant participant wrote,
"If your baby daddy is long gone . . . `So what?'You can still
pull through and raise your baby just as right with or without
him. And you never know who's willing to help you out."
As far as accomplishing goals, one parenting participant
wrote,
My advice to other young parents is never think just because you
have a little one that your life is over. You can [have] all you
want and more, it'll just be harder to accomplish than if you
didn't have a child. Never give up your dreams to go to college
or your dreams to make something of yourself. NEVER let
anyone put you down or make you feel worthless.
The participants'desire for "being strong" in the face of neg-
ative stigma is voiced throughout their journals, and this strength
has resulted in a positively transformative experience for many.
Pregnancy and Parenting as Positively
Transformative
Positive changes were apparent in the comments that several
parenting participants made about what they like about being
a parent. One parenting participant wrote, "I feel more
mature." Another parenting participant wrote, "I like the
responsibility because it helps me grow." Another parenting
participant commented that one of the things that she liked
most about being a parent was "Being respected a lot more
by my family."
One pregnant participant described a refocusing of her
life:
In the beginning of my pregnancy I thought, "why even try, my
life is over?" so I didn't apply myself until the middle when I
wrote my baby deserves a good life, and I went from a report
card with Fs, Cs, and incompletes to As!
One parenting participant explained her new maternal
role as important for caring for herself for the sake of her
children. She wrote, "Take care of yourself! Don't drink or
smoke, your kids need you!" This theme of caring for more
than just oneself spills over into daily accomplishments. A
parenting participant wrote, "This week I'm proud that I:
Have been working hard and knowing that I did my best for
me, for my job, and for my baby." Many of the parenting
adolescents express a positive self-image that seems to
increase for many as they are surprised by how much they
have accomplished and how hard they work post-birth. This
in turn helps them to cope with the stigma of young mother-
hood and the barriers that they face. Another parenting par-
ticipant wrote,
I've been realizing that I really do love being a mother. My
daughter has brought out so much in me. It's very difficult being
a teen mom. But with having motivation you can do anything
STILL. I was having a hard time giving up so much. But it's
worth it.
Another wrote, "I never could picture my life this way by
the age of 16 having 2 kids but I never let this slow me down
from reaching my dreams/goals."
Discussion
Similar to previous findings (Barr & Simons, 2012), we
found little difference between the aspirations of pregnant
adolescents and parenting adolescents. The aspiration for a
"better life" was a prominent theme in both pregnant and
parenting adolescent narratives. Wanting something better
signifies realizing the negativity in their own lives and striv-
ing for something different. Mothers in Herman's (2006) eth-
nographic study noted a positive change in responsible
goal-seeking behaviors, optimism, responsibility, and inde-
pendence with motherhood. SmithBattle (2007b) also found
an emergence of new priorities and concerns about the future
with the anticipation of motherhood.
In this sense, the aspiration for a "better life" also
serves as a motivator for future goal-seeking behavior,
especially regarding school and career goals. Several of the
Cherry et al. 7
participants described the path to a better life as involving
school and career. This is particularly interesting in that it
could signify that messages are being heard about staying
in school (see Stevenson, Maton, & Teti, 1998). Herman
(2006) found in her ethnographic study of 16 adolescent
mothers that the women found parenting to have a positive
impact on their aspirations, including an increased value
put on achieving a diploma and goal orientation toward
work and career. Surprisingly, even though women in
Kendall et al.'s (2005) study acknowledged future obsta-
cles of teen pregnancy, the women reported that their first
pregnancy had little or no affect on their dreams or goals,
and that in some cases, early pregnancy brought meaning
into their lives and even made them more likely to achieve
their goals. Framed in the objective of providing a better
life for their children, school and careers take on a new
meaning as these mothers strive to improve the life circum-
stances of their children and give them resources and
opportunities that they themselves never had (Kendall et
al., 2005; SmithBattle, 2007b).
In spite of the social and institutional barriers that preg-
nant and parenting adolescents face in trying to provide a
better life for their children, the majority of participants
wrote about feeling strong and reported an overall positive
self-image. The positive emotions that emerge during moth-
erhood could enhance the mother's ability to cope with the
negative effects of stigma and stress (Fredrickson, 2001).
The result of positive psychology could improve self-esteem
and motivation. For example, Hess, Papas, and Black (2002)
found an enhanced self-worth and positive self-esteem
among young mothers, which may have helped them cope
with negative stigma and stress.
Clemmens (2003) acknowledged that a theme in qualita-
tive research with pregnant and parenting adolescents is
motherhood as "positively transforming." Brubaker and
Wright (2006) also found a stronger, more valued sense of
self by teen mothers. SmithBattle (2007b) found that preg-
nancy and parenting served as an impetus for new concerns
and priorities about the future. Lesser, Anderson, and
Koniak-Griffin's (1998) analysis of pregnant teens identified
the theme of "reparation" as "the adolescents'desire to repair
and heal the wounds they had suffered, often at the hands of
their own parents, when they were younger" (p. 12). Lesser
discusses the notion of "reparation" in pregnancy as a posi-
tive turning point in the lives of young mothers and a desire
to heal a dysfunctional past (Lesser et al., 1998). The women
in Lesser and colleagues' study wished to repair the wounds
of their own childhoods by providing an ideal life for their
own children. A psychology of positive human functioning
or positive psychology movement has arisen that focuses on
how, through life experiences, people may become happier
and fulfilled (Seligman & Csikszentmihalyi, 2000).Applying
this concept to pregnancy and parenting, it has been posited
that motherhood could indeed give young women an added
sense of self-image and pride (Hess et al., 2002).
There seems to be a disconnect between aspirations and
motivations to complete school and pursue careers and the
reality of doing so given the structural barriers and societal
sanctions that adolescent mothers often face. Both pregnant
and parenting participants discussed the hardships involved
with the social stigma and accomplishing daily tasks.
Prominent hardships voiced by the parenting adolescents
involved difficulty in finding jobs and balancing school and
raising a baby by themselves. SmithBattle (2007b) also
found that adolescents' renewed commitment to school was
often hindered by competing work demands, family respon-
sibilities, and misdirected school policies and practices.
These competing demands cause stress for new mothers,
especially when the mothers do not have a strong network of
social and institutional support (SmithBattle, 2007b).
The findings of this study could be applied to adolescent
pregnancy and parenting support initiatives that help to make
their aspirations a reality. For example, because pregnancy
and parenting may have a refocusing effect that prompts ado-
lescents to adjust their priorities, it is important to harness the
newfound motivations and to provide educational and career
resources to them at this critical juncture. Institutional policy
support for pregnant and parenting adolescents who wish to
remain in or return to school is critical so that their newfound
motivation is not undermined. Assistance with translating
long-term goals into short-term achievable steps is also criti-
cal to the support of the aspirations. If this transformative
juncture does indeed increase motivation and positive self-
esteem, then this is an important time to intervene with sup-
port in translating aspirations into explicit goals and
objectives.
One predominant theme involving career aspirations is an
interest in work in the medical field. This interest seems to
stem from positive personal impressions made by people in
these roles during the course of pregnancy, birth, and early
child rearing. This finding highlights the importance of voca-
tional role models. Pregnant and parenting adolescents may
aspire to jobs that they have had some experience with, in
this case, through the experience of their pregnancy and
birth. Medical jobs require significant education and train-
ing, whether in technical school, college, or medical school.
Programs that focus on career support and counseling, intern-
ships in medical fields, and assistance with applications for
medical training could be useful in this regard, especially in
economically struggling communities like Lake County.
Limitations
This study included several limitations involving sampling,
design, and journal content. We used a purposive sample of
pregnant and parenting adolescents that is not representative
of all pregnant and parenting adolescents in Lake County,
Indiana. A purposive sample is typically used in hard to find
populations with specific characteristics, in this case, pregnant
and parenting adolescents (Bernard, 2002). Non-representative
8 SAGE Open
convenience samples are also used in qualitative research
where the goal is not to derive generalizable results outside of
the study population. Second, our analysis did not operational-
ize the distinctions between aspirations and expectations
because these distinctions were not specifically targeted in the
journal questions and prompts. Rather, aspirations were
implied by the general stated plans of the pregnant and parent-
ing adolescents. Furthermore, because the study design was
not longitudinal, we cannot say anything about how these spe-
cific participants had their aspirations change in the course of
their transition from pregnancy to parenting.
Participants were also limited by the format and content
of the journals. One of the goals of the PPASS project was to
provide pregnant and parenting adolescents with a platform
to voice their concerns and emotions. To encourage them to
do this, the journal used specific questions and prompts to
guide their writing. This could in some cases bias the types
of journal entries that were written. However, when selecting
the questions and prompts, care was given to include both
positive prompts like "things I like about being a mother"
and negative prompts like "things I hate." Also, the partici-
pants may not have written about long-term goals if they had
not been encouraged to write about them with the prompt "In
five years . . ." However, it was necessary to include the
prompts because the journals were not just used as a data col-
lection tool but also as a platform for self-reflection and
improvement. Finally, some participants may not have felt
comfortable or had practice expressing sensitive or painful
feelings in writing. This concern was addressed through the
inclusion of journal prompts that helped to facilitate the par-
ticipants' expressions of emotions and concerns.
Conclusion
This study contrasts the aspirations of pregnant and parent-
ing adolescents in Lake County, Indiana, and examines their
perceptions of social and structural challenges of women in
an economically depressed urban area of Indiana. The aspi-
ration of providing a "better life" for their children was simi-
lar between pregnant and parenting adolescents. Contrary to
the predominantly negative effects of adolescent pregnancy
most often reported in the literature, many of the pregnant
and parenting adolescents reported increased motivations for
school and career post-birth as well as other positive effects
such as better self-esteem, being proud of their accomplish-
ments, and earning more respect from family members. Still,
stigma and barriers exist that make achieving future educa-
tional and employment opportunities difficult. Policies that
promote supportive school settings, vocational training and
placement, a positive sense of self, and strong social network
may mitigate these barriers.
More in-depth ethnographic exploration is needed on the
changing sociocultural contexts that take place as young
women transition from pregnancy to parenting and how
competing demands affect future educational and career
aspirations. Longitudinal study designs would be most
helpful in pinpointing triggers for changing aspirations and
could inform the best timing for public health interventions
to help prevent adolescent mothers'aspirations from declin-
ing. Future focus should be on providing pregnant and par-
enting adolescents with the social support and the practical
tools they need to harness their motivation, transcend social
and material barriers to achieving goals and aspirations,
and realize their desires to achieve a "better life" for them-
selves and their families.
