Demonstration: Lessons for Long-Term Care
Workforce Initiatives

Purpose: Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) was a long-term
care workforce demonstration that sought to improve
recruitment and retention of direct care workers by
changing public policy and management practice. The
purpose of this article is to document and assess BJBC's
implementation, analyze factors affecting implementa-
tion, and draw lessons from it for other long-term care
workforce initiatives. Design and Methods: We ana-
lyzed qualitative data from project work plans and
progress reports, and notes from telephone and in-
person interviews with project staff, coalition stake-
holders, and state policy experts. We abstracted the
data, categorized it, and summarized it by state in
matrices for analysis. Results: The five BJBC projects
did implement their demonstration plans. Factors that
affected project implementation included having
demonstration resources; strong, stable leadership;
strong coalitions that included key stakeholders; a neu-
tral lead agency; clear goals; effective process; and
a favorable state history and context. Implications:
BJBC demonstrated that recruitment and retention is
a long-term care industry problem, not just a nursing
home problem. Future initiatives should: recognize
that workforce policy and management practice
change is difficult and takes time, obtain funding,
develop strategies specific to the state history and
context, engage key stakeholders, and develop relation-
ships among stakeholders.
Key Words: Workforce, Aide, Nursing home,
Home health, Assisted living, Long-term care
Nursing assistants, home health aides, and personal
care assistants play a vital role in long-term care.
Despite their importance, however, recruitment and
retention of these direct care workers is a challenge for
all long-term care providers (Stone & Weiner, 2001).
Factors that lead to difficulty recruiting and retaining
direct care workers include lack of training and upward
mobility, hard emotional and physical work, work-
place stress and burnout, poor supervision, lack of
respect, and understaffing. Recently, a number of
workforce initiatives have sought to improve recruit-
ment and retention (Harris-Kojetin, Lipson, Fielding,
Kiefer, & Stone, 2004).
The Better Jobs Better Care (BJBC) demonstration
was a long-term care workforce initiative that sought to
``create changes in policy and practice that will lead to
the recruitment and retention of high-quality para-
professional (`direct care') workers in both nursing
homes and home and community-based settings'' (BJBC,
2002, p. 3). The purpose of this article is to (a) document
and assess BJBC's implementation, (b) analyze factors
affecting implementation, and (c) draw lessons from it
for other long-term care workforce initiatives.
BJBC Design and Goals
Motivated by the current and anticipated future
shortage of direct care workers and the belief that the
quality of their jobs affects turnover and ultimately
quality of care, The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
and The Atlantic Philanthropies (the Foundations)
underwrote the BJBC demonstration. They funded
projects enabling them to hire staff, issue subcontracts,
and in some cases provide financial support to
participating providers. The Foundations also funded
the Institute for the Future of Aging Services to run the
demonstration as the national program office and PHI
(formerly the Paraprofessional Healthcare Institute) to
This research was supported by The Atlantic Philanthropies and The

Dawson, this issue).
The program office and technical assistance con-
tractor designed the demonstration and developed
a call for proposals. Awards were to be made to
. . . teams of stakeholders--providers, workers and
consumers as well as long term care policymakers--
that are already engaged in initiatives to improve
workforce recruitment, retention and quality.. . .
Each team should be headed by a nonprofit agency
capable of providing the leadership and direction
required to achieve the grantee team objectives.
(BJBC, 2002, p. 5, italics in the original)
The program office, technical assistance contractor,
and the Foundations, with input from an advisory
committee, reviewed the submitted proposals and
awarded demonstration project grants to a lead agency
in each of five states: Iowa, North Carolina, Oregon,
Pennsylvania, and Vermont. The lead agencies worked
with a coalition of stakeholders to run each project.
Each project received funds for a 3-month planning
period, during which they were expected to work with
``team members, the Program Office, and participating
foundation staff to clarify goals and expectations and
to devise a plan to achieve them'' (BJBC, 2002, p. 6).
Projects were to develop management practice goals
within broad guidelines to ``implement workplace
improvements in one or more provider networks to
enhance the quality of direct care workers' jobs . . .'' to
improve recruitment and retention of the direct care
workforce (BJBC, 2002, p. 3). Thus, projects had
considerable latitude in developing management prac-
tice interventions, recruiting providers to test them, and
supporting participating providers in implementing the
interventions.
Projects had similarly broad guidelines concerning
policy goals. Projects were to develop policy goals that
``strengthen policies . . . that can help to attract and
retain high-quality direct care workers'' (BJBC, 2002,
p. 3). Goals could include enhanced wages, improved
health insurance coverage, subsidies of other benefits,
funding for education and training, and ``reimburse-
ment changes aimed at rewarding job redesign efforts''
(p. 5). Projects also were to develop a strategy and
implementation plan for achieving their goals.
Methods
We based our implementation research on qualita-
tive data from (a) documents, including initial project
work plans and biannual progress reports that projects
submitted to the national program office; and (b) notes
from semistructured telephone and in-person inter-
views that we conducted. Respondents to these key
informant interviews in each state were the project
directors and staff at the five lead agencies that received
the grants, stakeholders who were members of the five
coalitions, and policy experts in the five states.
Additional respondents had a ``cross-state vantage
point'' that gave them perspective on all of the projects.
These included the leadership of the national program
office and staff of the technical assistance contractor,
who provided technical assistance to all of the projects
on policy and practice interventions.
We asked project directors to identify their projects'
organizational structures and the stakeholders in their
coalitions. We obtained information about projects'
initial policy goals and practice interventions from
work plans. We tracked modifications and progress
toward these goals through biannual progress reports,
which we supplemented with information from tele-
phone and site visit interviews. We grouped similar
policy goals and practice interventions into categories
and abstracted specific information by state in text data
tables for analysis. We abstracted basic information
from them in the summary tables included here.
For our analysis of factors that affect implementation,
we relied on responses to questions in the semistructured
interviews ``what factors are associated with successful
implementation'' and ``what barriers hindered imple-
mentation.'' We reviewed responses, identified themes,
and developed detailed categories of facilitating factors
and barriers, which we further grouped into six primary
categories. We abstracted specific responses and re-
corded them in data tables by state and detailed
category, identifying whether the respondent's vantage
point was within a state or across states.
We distributed a draft of this paper to the project
directors and staff of the national program office and
technical assistance contractor for feedback. We then
reviewed the feedback, reexamined the information
from the data sources we had, and made changes based
on all of the information available.
Overview of the Projects
Stakeholder Coalitions and Project Structures
The coalitions included one or more representatives
of the following groups: state agencies, trade associa-
tions, consumers, direct care workers or organizations
that represent them, and educational institutions (see
Table 1). No two projects engaged exactly the same
stakeholders, but all were quite broad in their inclusion
of stakeholders. In some cases, members left or joined
the coalition during the demonstration. Notably
missing from three of the five coalitions was the state
Department of Labor. The extent of prior experience
working together varied across projects.
The nonprofit lead agencies came from different
stakeholder groups depending on the state (indicated
by an L in Table 1). Some were advocacy groups
completely independent of state agencies, whereas
others were tied to such agencies through previous
grant activities. Their respective missions ranged from
promoting the quality of long-term care for consumers
to improving direct care worker jobs.
Each lead agency hired or designated a project
director. Projects in four states also hired a practice
manager charged with implementing the practice
change goals at providers participating in the demon-
stration. The practice managers were key resources in
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 27
promoting active involvement of the participating
providers. Only one of the projects employed an
equivalent policy development manager at any time
during the demonstration; either the lead agency
executive director or project director assumed this
role in the other four projects. Two of the projects en-
countered hiring delays, and three experienced signif-
icant staff turnover. The project leadership housed in
the five lead agencies was responsible for pursuing the
projects' policy and practice goals working with the
stakeholder coalitions.
Management Practice Interventions
Although all five projects pursued the same over-
arching goal of improving jobs and reducing turnover,
their specific management practice interventions dif-
fered (see Table 2). This article focuses on the activities
of the lead agency in pursuing practice change;
a separate analysis will address participating providers'
implementation of management practice changes with-
in their organizations. Most of the interventions
involved using existing training programs to bring
about this ``culture change.'' Two projects offered
training for senior level management, and three for
frontline supervisors. Three projects provided stan-
dardized team building training to participating
providers. Projects offered peer mentoring programs
in all but one state. Two projects sought to enhance
direct care workers' clinical and caregiving skills.
Finally, all projects created some opportunities for
providers to develop provider-specific projects tailored
to their specific needs.
All projects recruited provider organizations to
participate in the demonstration. The recruitment
process varied across states, ranging from a formal
process of responding to a request for proposals to lead
agency outreach to participating providers. A total of
148 providers signed memoranda of understanding to

participate in the demonstration (see Table 3). Depend-
ing on the project's design, the total number of
providers in each state varied from 11 in Oregon to
66 in North Carolina. Recruited providers included
nursing facilities, assisted living facilities, home care
agencies, and adult day service providers.
Policy Goals and Implementation
The five projects established a variety of policy goals,
which we grouped into five categories (see Table 4), and
all projects implemented initiatives to pursue their
goals. Although the call for proposals identified several
possible options related to compensation, none of the
projects called for increases in wages, and only one
worked to increase benefits. Two projects sought to
create incentives for providers to implement manage-
ment practices that improve direct care jobs. Three
sought to create or strengthen direct care worker
professional associations. All five projects had one or
more goals that sought to develop direct care worker
training curricula, expand formal credentialing of
direct care workers, or make information on creden-
tials available to employers through registries. All five
projects promoted public awareness of direct care
workforce issues and advocated for policies that
addressed these issues. Beyond these broad similarities
in the types of goals, specific goals varied greatly within
categories. Although few goals were fully achieved, as
detailed below, all were at least partially achieved by
the end of the demonstration.
The Five Projects and Their Implementation
Despite some similarities, the five demonstration
projects differed in their organization, experience,
specific goals, implementation experience, and policy
accomplishments.
Iowa: Direct Care Worker Advocacy
With Policy Experience
The Iowa project was led by the Iowa CareGivers
Association, a small organization with a focus on
education, recognition, advocacy, and research that
improves quality of care through support of direct care
workers. The mission of serving workers directly was
unique among the lead agencies, and some parts of the
provider community reacted to it as a labor organizing
threat and refused to participate in the BJBC coalition.
The lead agency's executive director served as the
project director initially, later contracting with a project
director, practice manager, and policy director for
varying amounts of time as needed, effectively doubling
the size of the organization. The lead agency director
used her policy development experience to lead project
policy change efforts. Coalition members engaged to
varying degrees in three policy workgroups, work with
educational institutions, and direct interventions with
providers.
Iowa's management practice initiative had four
components: (a) team-building training using Hartman
Communications' (2007) ``Color Code'' training pro-
gram, which identifies each employee's personality and
passions to enhance communication among all levels of
staff; (b) peer mentor training using a program pre-
viously developed by the lead agency for nursing
homes, which it modified for home care settings and
implemented at participating providers; (c) manage-
ment training on the purpose and philosophy behind
the peer mentor training program, which was required
of upper management at participating providers; and
(d) mini-grants awarded to direct care workers who
developed worker-led interventions to improve re-
cruitment and retention in their organizations.
The Iowa project's policy goals were to improve
health benefits, streamline curriculum and credential-
ing, and promote awareness of long-term care work-
force policy issues. The project conducted a study
analyzing the options and feasibility of increasing health
insurance benefits for direct care workers and promoted
awareness of the need for benefits, for example by
developing a video that relayed stories of uninsured and
underinsured direct care workers, participating in
citizens' health care work group forums, and becoming
involved in a larger state debate on health care reform
through direct worker legislative testimony.

The project also sought to streamline educational
and training standards and expand an existing registry
of direct care workers. It surveyed direct care workers
and providers regarding education and was instrumen-
tal in the passage of two laws with appropriations. One
modified the state's existing nurse aide registry to
include all classifications of direct care workers and
their education and training. The other established
a governor-appointed Direct Care Worker Education
Taskforce to which three direct care workers were
appointed, one serving as co-chair.
North Carolina: State-Related Agency With a
Clear Vision
The North Carolina Foundation for Advanced
Health Programs, a private organization that provides
staffing and a vehicle for receiving grant funds for
programs of interest to state policy makers, was the
lead agency in North Carolina. It purchased the ser-
vices of the half-time program director from the state
Department of Health and Human Services. Assisted by
a professional facilitator, she provided staff support
and leadership to a broad coalition of stakeholders
from policy, practice, and advocacy organizations.
These stakeholders had a prior history of grant-funded
projects focused on long-term care workforce de-
velopment. The project accomplished much of the
provider-level intervention work through subcontracts
with five provider associations that also were members
of the coalition.
The practice and policy initiatives of the North
Carolina project differed somewhat from those of the
other projects in that they were fully integrated under a
single vision. The project's long-term goal was to es-
tablish reimbursement differentials for providers whose
management practices create high-quality jobs for direct
care workers. The project's plan was, first, to establish
a special designation on state licenses for providers that
met practice criteria that its coalition was to develop and,
later, to pursue differential reimbursement.
Through a well-structured, consensus decision-
making process, the coalition developed specific opera-
tional requirements that providers would have to meet
to receive the designation and tested them at providers
that participated as pilot sites. The special designation
standards were in four domains: supportive workplace,
training, balanced workloads, and career development.
Providers were allowed to develop their own approaches
to meeting these standards. The only exception was
a required standardized training program for super-
visors, the PHI's Coaching Supervision training. It is
designed to build ``relationships with supervisees,
constructively presenting and addressing problems, and
helping workers develop problem-solving skills'' (PHI,
2007, p. I.2).
The North Carolina legislature passed legislation
establishing this special designation, laying the foun-
dation for establishing in future legislation higher
reimbursement rates for providers receiving the
designation. Once providers felt they fulfilled the re-
quirements outlined in the special designation criteria,
they were able to submit applications and undergo both
a desk and onsite review. To date four providers have
received the special designation. (See Brannon, Barry, &
Kemper, 2007, for additional information on the North
Carolina project.)
Oregon: Process Orientation With a Focus
on Management Practice
The Oregon Technical Assistance Corporation,
which provides training and technical assistance in-
cluding support of state human service programs, was
the lead agency in Oregon. Although its executive
director assumed the role of project director officially,
a four-person leadership team ran the project: a project
manager and a part-time practice manager housed at
the lead agency, a local evaluator, and a staff member
from Oregon's Aging Services Department. The project
coalition members had a prior history of working
together on long-term care initiatives. They ap-
proached the project in what respondents referred to
as the ``Oregon way,'' emphasizing a process-oriented,
consultative approach that takes time. The project
manager, along with the other three leadership team
members, provided direction to a set of committees and
councils, which were composed of coalition members.
The project's plan was to develop its policy goals
over the course of the demonstration based on the
policy barriers to management practice change pro-
viders encountered. Under this plan, the Oregon project
focused first on its practice goals.
The underlying philosophy of providing person-
centered care pervaded the practice interventions. The
project used the Learn, Empower, Achieve, Produce
(LEAP) program training module for nurses to improve
supervisory skills. The training focused on building
relationships with residents, families, and direct care
workers; giving feedback to direct care workers; and
empowering residents and direct care staff with an
emphasis on person-centered care (Hollinger-Smith,
Ortigara, & Lindeman, 2001; Mather LifeWays, 2006).
The project also used LEAP training to improve
communication skills among practice teams at each
provider and to improve relationships between direct
care workers and their supervisors; in addition, it used
the module for direct care workers to teach peer
mentoring skills. To promote diversity, the project
encouraged providers to use a diversity training video
with all levels of staff to stimulate discussion of
diversity issues specific to their organizations.
The project developed few specific policy goals and
made little tangible progress on policy, in part because
the practice implementation experience did not generate
a policy agenda as planned. In addition to raising
awareness of public policy issues related to the long-term
care workforce, the Oregon project sought to expand the
use of Oregon's new nurse delegation law. The project
also worked with the Oregon Consortium for Nursing
Education to develop scenarios on working with direct
care workers for a new statewide nursing curriculum.

Pennsylvania: Leadership Turnover in a
Large, Complex State
The lead agency in Pennsylvania was the Center for
Advocacy for the Rights and Interests of the Elderly,
which provides outreach, training, referral, and advoca-
cy for older adults, their caregivers, and service providers
in the Philadelphia region. After early turnover, the lead
agency was able to hire a project director and practice
manager to lead the project. The original coalition was
a 10-member steering committee that served during the
project's planning phase. Subsequently, the lead agency
created a new, nonprofit subsidiary to oversee project
implementation, and governance shifted from the steer-
ing committee to the subsidiary's board. Decision-
making authority for the project, however, remained
with the lead agency. Late in the project, the role of the
subsidiary and its board was terminated. The coalition
dealt with significant opposition from certain regions of
the state and struggled with obtaining consensus from
a diverse group of stakeholders.
Because of Pennsylvania's large size, the lead agency
established subcontracts with organizations in five
geographic regions to work with stakeholder groups
locally to pursue practice and policy change. Each
subcontractor was responsible for implementing prac-
tice interventions at participating providers in its region.
The practice interventions included senior manage-
ment training, team building, supervisor training, and
provider-specific projects. A 2-day leadership training
seminar conducted by the Professional Care Manage-
ment Institute prepared managers to support the
organizational change that was expected to result
from team-building training. Direct care workers re-
ceived team-building training using the Professional
Care Management Institute's (2007) Key Solutions
Team Building training, which aimed to improve direct
care workers' perception of organizational culture and
employee satisfaction. Providers also were offered the
PHI's Coaching Supervision training in problem-solving
skills (PHI, 2007). Finally, joint teams of managers and
direct care workers developed provider-specific inter-
ventions focusing, for example, on orientation, mentor-
ing, or improving communication about care.
The Pennsylvania project's policy goals included
expanding direct care worker training resources and
credentialing, developing a professional association for
direct care workers, and promoting awareness of long-
term care workforce public policy issues. The project
developed a Universal Core Curriculum designed for
direct care workers in all settings. By demonstration's
end, two Area Agencies on Aging had adopted it for
personal care worker training. The project also worked
on developing training and a competency exam based
on the curriculum with the expectation that it will be
used in Pennsylvania's new personal care attendant
training regulations. The project established a direct
care worker advisory committee to represent the needs
of the state's direct care workers, put on a statewide
worker conference, and published a newsletter with an
editorial board composed of direct care workers. These
accomplishments led direct care workers to establish
a statewide direct care worker association. Finally,
some members of the project staff and coalition served
on legislative workgroups in an effort to integrate BJBC
into other long-term care workforce policy initiatives.
Vermont: Leadership Turnover in a Small,
Collaborative State
The lead agency in Vermont, the Community of
Vermont Elders, promotes improved quality of life for
seniors through education, policy development, and
advocacy. The lead agency's executive director played
an active leadership role, overseeing a project director
and additional staff hired to manage the practice
initiative. Initially, the project was governed by a 24-
member steering committee and a 7-member executive
committee whose members had a history of working
together on long-term care workforce policy issues. The
executive committee made decisions with input from the
steering committee. Significant turnover occurred
among project staff members and, coincident with the
transition to a new executive director and project
director, the structure developed into a network with
workgroups. These workgroups included project staff,
executive committee members, or both who did the bulk
of the work and decision making, with the executive
committee serving in an advisory and steering capacity.
Vermont's practice goals focused on peer mentoring
and caregiving skill development. The project provided
training in peer mentoring and direct care worker
leadership development to help foster culture change at
the providers. As part of its policy work, the Vermont
project developed advanced direct care worker training
programs (see below) that it offered to participating
providers.
The project's policy goals included creating incen-
tives for job redesign, developing curriculum and
credentialing, creating a direct care worker professional
association, and promoting awareness of long-term care
workforce policy issues. The Vermont project added
criteria to an existing annual state quality award for
nursing facilities that required the use of best practices
for recruitment and retention of direct care workers. It
also established a similar industry award for home care
providers, although without financial incentives.
The project developed three training curricula for
direct care workers. These curricula offered training
for personal care aides and two advanced training
modules, one on palliative care and the other on the
care of persons with dementia for existing workers.
The project then received a grant from the state
Department of Education to develop a methodology for
assessing personal care aides' proficiency based on the
curriculum it had developed.
Although technically not a BJBC initiative, the
Vermont lead agency had a concurrent, complementary
grant to establish a direct care worker association that
was integrated with the BJBC project. The result was
the creation of a direct care worker association. The
BJBC project offered continued support of the associ-
ation through events and education, access to training,
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 31
and reimbursement for direct care workers' travel to
national conferences.
Finally, project staff and coalition members partic-
ipated in other state long-term care workforce de-
velopment workgroups. They also met and maintained
close contact with state legislators, playing an impor-
tant role in the passage of workforce study legislation
with an appropriation.
Factors Affecting Implementation
Respondents to telephone and in-person interviews
identified factors that helped and barriers that hindered
implementation of the BJBC projects. Table 5 reports
the number of states in which the factors were
mentioned by one or more within-state respondents;
an asterisk indicates whether one or more respondents
with a cross-state vantage point mentioned the factor.
We grouped them into six categories that in our
judgment are important overarching factors for suc-
cessful implementation.
Demonstration Resources.--Not surprisingly, dem-
onstration funding and in-kind technical assistance
provided by the national program office and technical
assistance contractor were essential to the demonstra-
tion projects. Respondents identified resources as
a facilitating factor and their decline after the demon-
stration as a barrier to continuation. External support,
however, was able to do little to overcome one
significant financial barrier to provider participation
and commitment to the project: the limited financial
resources and staffing in the competitive long-term care
industry, much of which relies heavily on low Medicaid
reimbursements. Indeed, instability among providers'
senior management, which is likely related to competi-
tion and low pay, was an important barrier to engaging
and sustaining provider participation in the project.
Strong, Stable Project Leadership.--Also not sur-
prisingly, the skills and abilities of project leadership
were important for effective implementation, as was
prior experience with public policy and practice
interventions. Several projects did not have a designated
person with policy experience to lead work on policy,
making it difficult to pursue policy goals. Projects
sometimes used consultants effectively to add needed
expertise that the leadership did not have. Hiring and
retaining appropriately qualified leadership turned out
to be quite challenging, and delays in hiring and
turnover of leadership were oft-cited barriers to
implementation
Strong Coalition With Key Stakeholders.--Having
representation of key stakeholders, particularly pro-
vider and direct care workers, as well as state agencies,
was essential for project implementation. A history of
collaboration greatly increased the ability of the
stakeholders to function as a coalition and compromise
on issues when they had competing interests. This was
the experience in Oregon, North Carolina, and
Vermont, where coalition of stakeholders previously
had worked together on related issues. The particular
individuals representing stakeholders, of course, mat-
ter: They should be key decision makers, have policy or
practice experience, be committed to the project, and
be able to participate regularly.
A Neutral Lead Agency.--Having a lead agency that
other stakeholders, particularly providers and direct
care worker organizations, did not perceive to be neutral
was a barrier to implementation in some states. For ex-
ample, as indicated, in Iowa some providers perceived
the lead agency, as a caregiver association, to be pro-
unionization, making it difficult to engage providers in
the project and leading one provider association to ac-
tively oppose the project. In contrast, stakeholders in
North Carolina perceived the lead agency, which was
linked with state government and had prior experience
with coalition stakeholders, as sufficiently neutral to lead
the coalition with the confidence of the stakeholders.
Clear Goals.--The pursuit of a clear goal that
stakeholders agreed on contributed to effective imple-
mentation. In North Carolina having a single, clear
goal encompassing both policy and practice from the
beginning of the demonstration was important to
project implementation. In contrast, in some states,
the absence of clear goals from the beginning made it
difficult to focus project implementation efforts and
resources. Respondents also viewed achievability of
goals as important, mentioning as barriers the demon-
stration's unrealistic expectations, its short duration,
and the difficulty of pursuing both policy and practice
goals. Strategies for pursuing goals appeared to be less
important than the goals themselves or the process for
pursuing them. However, respondents identified several
specific strategies for achieving policy goals: (a)
monitoring policy activity and flexibly exploiting
current policy interest; (b) having a public education
and communication strategy from the project begin-
ning; and (c) collecting information to document the
workforce problem and, later, the project's successes.
Effective Process.--The emphasis on process and
how it was used was an important factor that could be
either a barrier or a facilitator of successful implemen-
tation. Overemphasis on process can delay implemen-
tation, whereas excessive task orientation can limit the
breadth and sustainability of a project's impact. At the
same time, skillful use of process can be effective in
reaching compromise and building relationships among
stakeholders, as it did in North Carolina (Brannon et
al., 2007). For developing practice interventions,
respondents with cross-state vantage points viewed
involving providers and direct care workers as facili-
tating development, and several respondents under-
scored the importance of good communication between
the lead agency and participating providers. Structural
factors appeared to be less important than process,
although the structure should support the goals and
process, as well as the unique characteristics of the state.

Favorable State History and Context.--A state's
history and context had major effects on implementa-
tion, both favorable and unfavorable. As indicated,
a history of stakeholders working together on work-
force issues greatly facilitated project implementation.
Current interest of state policy makers in changes in
policies affecting direct care workers also was essential
for achieving policy goals. However, projects identified
tight state budgets and unwillingness of policy makers
to increase spending as barriers to policy change. Fear
of unionization, greater in some states than others, was
sometimes a barrier to both provider participation
and policy change. A state's size (population and
geographic) also affected implementation. For exam-
ple, competing regional stakeholders and having to
travel long distances to meetings posed barriers to
implementation in large, diverse Pennsylvania.

bringing about policy change to improve direct care
jobs is extremely difficult. Efforts to engage providers
in management practice change often confront un-
derstaffed organizations in an underfunded industry;
management that may have limited training; and high
turnover of management, supervisors, and direct care
workers. Policy change requires stakeholders, who
often have competing interests, to agree about goals; it
confronts resistance when it would increase state
spending; and it relies on the interest and support of
legislators, which takes skill, persistence, and time to
develop. The BJBC experience, moreover, almost
certainly underestimates the challenges. Because the
projects chose to apply for the grant and were selected
based on a highly competitive process, they almost
certainly had greater than average ability to implement
their projects. Similar efforts elsewhere might well
encounter greater barriers and have less success in
implementation than the demonstration projects.
That said, BJBC demonstrated that despite competing
interests, key provider and direct care worker stake-
holders can work together to pursue common workforce
issues and that long-term care providers of all types can
engage in efforts to improve direct care jobs. All five lead
agencies and stakeholder coalitions were able to
implement their projects. All established policy goals
and had some success in achieving them. All projects also
developed management practice interventions, recruited
providers to undertake the interventions, and supported
providers with implementation.
The BJBC demonstration stimulated some impor-
tant steps forward. By developing expertise, establish-
ing networks within and across states, and fostering
working relationships and trust among stakeholders,
the demonstration laid a foundation for continued
change in the five demonstration states, and it focused
attention more broadly on the challenge and impor-
tance of improving jobs in long-term care.
Finally, BJBC demonstrated that direct care work-
force issues cut across settings. Recruiting and retaining
direct care workers is not just a nursing home problem
or a home care problem--it is a long-term care
problem in which nursing facilities, assisted living
facilities, home care providers, and adult day service
providers and their residents and clients all have
a common interest. Indeed, shifting the research,
policy, and provider community's focus from the silos
and competing interests of each provider type to the
common workforce issues that cut across settings will
be an important legacy of BJBC.
Future Research
More questions about the BJBC demonstration
remain to be addressed. We have not yet analyzed
factors affecting implementation of management prac-
tice changes at providers that participated in the
demonstration. Nor have we analyzed the effects of
practice interventions on retention and turnover,
supervision, job satisfaction, respect, or other indica-
tors of direct care job quality. These analyses all will be
part of the broader evaluation of BJBC. A number of
important questions, however, cannot be addressed
through BJBC and should be addressed in future
research: What are the effects of increasing compensa-
tion on job quality and turnover? How do recruitment
practices affect turnover? What are the effects of
management practice changes and compensation on
the quality of the lives and care of clients and residents?
Implications
This article has focused on the implementation of
five particular BJBC projects in five particular states at
a particular time in their history. Some of the factors
affecting implementation that demonstration respond-
ents identified are unique to the particulars of the
demonstration or ignore the history and context that,
from projects' perspectives, are outside their control.
Nonetheless, their experience has implications for those
pursuing similar efforts in other states.
Obtain Money and Staff.--Addressing the consid-
erable challenges of changing practice and policy to
improve direct care jobs requires resources. Money and
staff were instrumental in effecting both practice and
policy change in BJBC. Foundation funding enabled the
projects to hire staff to convene and support the
coalition, receive direction and technical assistance,
pursue legislative change, and assist providers in
implementing practice interventions. When undertak-
ing similar initiatives, obtaining financial support to
hire staff should be an early step.
Engage Key Stakeholders.--Provider and worker
organizations are key stakeholders that must be engaged
in and committed to the initiative. Other stakeholders,
particularly state government, are important, but
without providers and direct care workers--with their
sometimes competing interests--compromise and prog-
ress are unlikely. Indeed, efforts led by either providers
or worker organizations are unlikely to have a large
impact because neither is seen as neutral by the other.
Pursue a Clear Vision.--The initiative should have
an important vision that key stakeholders agree on.
BJBC projects without clear vision faced difficulty
implementing their projects.
Develop Stakeholders` Working Relationships.--
Although task orientation can lead to task accomplish-
ment, process orientation can build relationships and
trust. And strong relationships and trust among stake-
holders are more likely to lead to sustained workforce
efforts than accomplishment of discrete tasks (Brannon
et al., 2007).
Seek to Change the Context.--Although some state
factors such as size and culture cannot be changed,
many factors that are immutable in the short run may
be mutable in the long run. In addition to developing
experience working together and trust, stakeholders

can seek to stimulate policy interest and additional
workforce efforts, one step leading to the next. If one
thing has been learned from the BJBC experience it is
that improving jobs in long-term care is a challenging,
long-term process requiring vision, commitment, and
persistence.
