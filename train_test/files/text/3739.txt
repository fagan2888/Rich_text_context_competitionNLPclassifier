Introduction
Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a chronic,
cyclic, and relapsing functional bowel disorder
characterized by abdominal pain associated with
changes in bowel habit or abdominal distention.
It affects up to 11.5% of the general population in
Europe and developing countries [Hungin et al.
2003]. In addition to the impact on patient's
health, IBS is also associated with impaired qual-
ity of life, diminished work productivity and
increased health and economic costs [Agarwal
and Spiegel, 2011]. Although there is consensus
on the application of clinical Rome Criteria to
diagnose IBS and its subtypes [Longstreth et al.
2006], up to 50% of patients still remain undiag-
nosed [Hungin et al. 2003]. In addition, there is a
lack of consensus on IBS treatment in terms of
optimal pharmacological treatment, most useful
drugs, specific indications for spasmolytic agents,
timing of clinical response and duration of
treatment.
Otilonium Bromide (OB) is a musculotropic spas-
molytic agent belonging to the family of quater-
nary ammonium derivatives and successfully used
in the treatment of patients affected by IBS due to
its specific pharmacokinetic and pharmacody-
namic properties. The positive polarity of the head
of the OB molecule determines the main pharma-
cokinetic property of this drug: a minimal systemic
absorption and the consequently high safety pro-
file. Studies on animal models revealed a specific
OB accumulation in colonic circular muscle at
therapeutic µm concentrations, while its plasma
levels were 1000 times lower, together with a poor
penetration of the drug in the central nervous
Efficacy of otilonium bromide in irritable
bowel syndrome: a pooled analysis

Abstract
Background: Otilonium bromide (OB) is a spasmolytic agent acting as an L-type calcium
channel antagonist in intestinal and colonic smooth muscle cells (SMCs). We analyzed
three independent clinical trials with homogeneous design on patients with irritable bowel
syndrome (IBS). After 2 weeks receiving placebo, patients were randomized to receive OB (3 ×
40 mg daily) or placebo for 15 weeks. We aimed to perform a pooled analysis of the data from
these homogeneous clinical trials to evaluate the efficacy of OB treatment on symptoms and
global response of patients.
Methods: A total of 883 patients with IBS (69.8% women, mean age 46.2 years, 43.8% mixed
type) were included, 442 treated with OB and 441 with placebo. The efficacy results from
the three studies at weeks 5, 10 and 15 were pooled in an intention-to-treat (ITT) strategy,
analyzed with a logistic regression model and described by forest plots.
Results: Despite a placebo effect in all efficacy variables, a significant therapeutic effect of OB
was observed at weeks 10 and 15 with reference to: (a) intensity and frequency of abdominal
pain; (b) rate of responders as evaluated by patients (71.8% at week 10 and 77.2% at week 15);
(c) severity of bloating; (d) rate of responders as evaluated by physicians (55% at week 10 and
63.9% at week 15). No significant OB effect was observed in stool frequency and consistency.
Conclusions: OB is more effective than placebo in IBS treatment. Therapeutic benefits are
significant after 10 weeks and are maximal after 15 weeks of treatment.

system [Evangelista et al. 2000]. Consistently, after
oral administration to healthy volunteers, the OB
plasmatic concentration was very low, <1% of the
drug was eliminated by urine, and 97% was elimi-
nated by feces [Evangelista, 2004].
Recent clinical studies showed comparable safety
and tolerability for OB and placebo [Clave et al.
2011]. OB was shown to inhibit the main patterns
of human sigmoid motility in vitro, including: the
tone of smooth muscle cells (SMCs); the rhyth-
mic phasic contractions induced by the interstitial
cells of Cajal; and the strong contractions induced
by stimulation of enteric motor neurons mainly
by blocking the calcium influx through L-type
calcium channels on SMCs [Gallego et al. 2010].
Recent in vitro studies using cultured human
colonic SMCs to further assess the musculotropic
spasmolytic properties of OB confirmed that this
drug causes smooth muscle relaxation through
the inhibition of voltage-gated calcium channels
(L-type > T-type) and the inhibition of mus-
carinic and tachykinergic effects [Martinez-
Cutillas et al. 2013]. All the above described
pharmacodynamic properties mediate the muscu-
lotropic spasmolytic effects of OB. In addition, its
interaction with the NK1/NK2 tachykinergic
receptors in sensory afferent nerves may also
improve the visceral hypersensitivity that affects
patients with IBS [Rychter et al. 2014].
We included in the present analysis three rand-
omized, double-blind, placebo-controlled studies
with a homogeneous treatment schedule of 3 ×
40 mg OB daily for 15 weeks to measure the clini-
cal efficacy of OB in patients with IBS. The first
study was conducted in 23 Italian centers, and
enrolled 325 patients with IBS [Battaglia et al.
1998]; the second study was conducted in 34 cent-
ers in eight European countries and enrolled 355
patients with IBS [Clave et al. 2011]; the third
study was conducted in Greece and enrolled 203
patients with IBS [Menarini IFR, 2012]. In all
these studies, OB improved the main symptoms of
patients with IBS, mostly related to abdominal
pain. Drawbacks included the difficult translation
of results to clinical practice for both patients and
physicians due to the long-term primary endpoints
(15 weeks), the need to define a global treatment
response on the basis of improvements in the most
frequent symptoms reported by patients and a strict
intention-to-treat (ITT) analysis, and the relevant
placebo effect [Ford et al. 2008; Clave et al. 2011;
Desborough and Ford, 2011; Hungin, 2011].
In the current analysis, we collected the individ-
ual data from the three homogeneous rand-
omized controlled trials (RCTs) described above
[Battaglia et al. 1998; Clave et al. 2011; Menarini
IFR, 2012] and performed a pooled analysis, with
the aim of evaluating the efficacy of OB treatment
on the main IBS symptoms (including intensity
and frequency of abdominal pain, severity of
bloating, stool frequency and consistency), and
the global treatment response assessed by patients
and by their physicians. The results of the pooled
analysis support the significant therapeutic effect
of OB versus placebo, thus providing additional
research-based data to guide clinical practice in
IBS management.
Methods
Studies and patients
A total of 889 patients with IBS were enrolled in
three independent RCTs [Battaglia et al. 1998;
Clave et al. 2011; Menarini IFR, 2012]. In more
detail, the study by Battaglia and colleagues evalu-
ated the efficacy of OB by comparing 158 patients
treated with the study drug versus 158 patients
receiving a placebo (study code in the pooled anal-
ysis: Battaglia) [Battaglia et al. 1998]. The primary
objective of the OBIS study was to confirm the
efficacy of OB for symptom control in patients
with IBS in a superiority trial versus placebo by
comparing 169 patients receiving the study drug
versus 170 patients receiving a placebo (study code
in the pooled analysis: OBIS) [Clave et al. 2011].
The third study was conducted in Greece and
evaluated the efficacy of OB by comparing 88
patients with IBS treated with the study drug ver-
sus 96 patients receiving a placebo (study code in
the pooled analysis: Greek) [Menarini IFR, 2012].
The inclusion/exclusion criteria and the design
(RCT, OB versus placebo) of the three studies
were homogeneous and included: (a) age > 18
years; (b) exclusion of major organic disease in
patients with age >50 years; (c) a positive diagno-
sis of IBS established using similar clinical criteria
(Rome I in the Battaglia and the Greek studies
and Rome II in the OBIS study) [Thompson
et al. 1999]; (d) after a run-in period of 2 weeks of
single blind placebo treatment, mild-to-severe
symptomatic IBS patients were randomized to
receive treatment in a double-blinded manner:
OB, 3 tablets (3 × 40 mg) daily before meals
(120 mg OB/day) or matching placebo, 3 tablets
daily before meals as well, for 15 weeks. Patient
P Clavé and J Tack

symptoms were monitored by means of diaries.
Follow-up visits were scheduled after 5, 10 and 15
weeks of treatment.
Efficacy variables
The following efficacy parameters included in this
analysis were considered as primary efficacy vari-
ables in the three selected studies [Battaglia et al.
1998; Clave et al. 2011; Menarini IFR, 2012]:
(1) intensity of abdominal pain as reported by
patients through a score; (2) intensity of abdomi-
nal pain evaluated by visual analogue scale (VAS)
as reported by patients; (3) number of episodes of
abdominal pain as reported by patients; (4) inten-
sity and frequency of abdominal pain by type of
IBS; (5) responder patients by global evaluation of
pain as composite parameter of intensity and fre-
quency scores; (6) stool frequency and consist-
ency; (7) severity of bloating; and (8) responder
patients as evaluated by the physician.
Intensity of abdominal pain was assessed by
adapting the 4-level rating scale, where 0 =
absent, 1 = mild/moderate, 2 = severe, and 3 =
extremely severe, to the three RCTs selected for
this analysis.
Weekly frequency of episodes of abdominal pain
was assessed by adapting the 4-level rating scale
where score 0 = none, 1 = 1­3 episodes, 2 = 4­7
episodes and 3 = 8 or more episodes during the
week to the three RCTs selected for this analysis.
As a global measure of treatment response, a
composite pain score (global evaluation of pain
as composite parameter of intensity of pain and
episodes of pain as reported by patients) was
calculated for this study as: abdominal pain score
× score for episodes of pain.
Severity of bloating was scored using a scale
where 0 = absent; 1 = mild-to-moderate; 2 =
severe; and 3 = extremely severe.
Intensity, frequency and global evaluation of
abdominal pain and severity of bloating were
recorded in a diary for 2 weeks before randomiza-
tion. The worst score recorded during the 2 weeks
was used as the baseline score for further analysis.
During the follow up, the scores were recorded in
the diary every week. The score recorded in the
last week before the follow-up visit was used for
the analysis.
Follow-up data were analyzed in an ITT analysis.
Responders with regards to intensity, frequency,
global evaluation of pain as a composite index of
intensity and frequency, or severity of distention,
were defined as patients having a reduction of
score 1 after 5, 10, and 15 weeks of treatment.
The intensity of abdominal pain was also reported
by patients using a VAS at baseline and at the end
of treatment.
The stool frequency was measured by the number
of days without stools and the average number of
stools in the remaining days of the week reported
by patients. The latter was evaluated by a four-
level scale where: 0 = 1 per day; 1 = 2 per day; 2
= 3 or 4 per day; and 3 = 5 or more per day.
Results on stool consistency reported by patients
were transformed into a dichotomous variable,
where: 0 = normal consistency and 1 = abnormal
consistency (either loose or hard).
Responders were also examined according to the
global efficacy assessment evaluated by the physi-
cian using a 4-point score at each visit after rand-
omization: 0 = no efficacy; 1 = moderate efficacy;
2 = good efficacy; and 3 = excellent efficacy.
Responders were defined as patients showing
good or excellent improvement in the global eval-
uation by the physician.
The efficacy analysis was based on an ITT popu-
lation analysis. The full analysis set (FAS, ITT
population) included all randomized patients
who had taken at least one dose of the study drug
and had undergone at least one efficacy assess-
ment for the primary efficacy endpoint (evalua-
tion of the diaries) after baseline.
Methods for the pooled analysis
All the efficacy data derived from the three stud-
ies were reported individually per study and as
weighted averages taking into account the num-
ber of patients enrolled in each study. First, an
analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for the
direct comparison between treatment groups,
and then a general linear model (GLM) was used
for the comparisons in which an impact of covari-
ates was expected. Data were statistically ana-
lyzed using the analysis of covariance, including
baseline intensity, sex, age, body mass index
(BMI) as covariates and treatment as factor. The
GLM was used to compare the efficacy parame-
ters between the treatment groups considering
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(3)
314 journals.sagepub.com/home/tag
the model baseline values of each parameter, age,
sex and BMI as covariates. The GLM procedure
provides regression analysis and ANOVA for one
dependent variable (efficacy parameter) by more
factors (treatment group and sex) and covariates
(baseline values, age and BMI).
The same method used for the analysis of the
end-of-treatment data (week 15) was applied to
the data obtained at the intermediate visits (weeks
5 and 10).
Severity of pain assessed by VAS was analyzed
using ANOVA performed on changes from base-
line to the end of treatment.
Frequency tables were completed at each relevant
time point for the rate of responders. Treatment
responders were analyzed using a binary logistic
regression model including factors for treatment.
For an exploratory subgroup analysis, the follow-
ing three subgroups were defined according to
the IBS type: predominant diarrhea (IBS-D),
predominant constipation (IBS-C), mixed type
(IBS-M) [Thompson et al. 1999; Longstreth et al.
2006]. The same descriptive statistics on change
from baseline in the frequency of abdominal pain
for the whole population were provided in the
FAS, stratifying by subgroup category.
Results were also represented through forest
plots, designed to illustrate the relative strength of
treatment effects in multiple quantitative studies
addressing the same question. The vertical line in
a forest plot corresponds to lack of effect. If the
confidence intervals (CIs) for individual studies
do not overlap with this line, it demonstrates that,
at the given level of confidence (95%), their effect
sizes differ from no effect. The same applies for
the pooled measure of effect (pooled dataset): if
the CI for the pooled dataset does not overlap
with the vertical line corresponding to lack of
effect, the overall result of pooled analysis differs
from no effect at the 95% level of confidence.
The analysis was performed in SAS (version 9.02,
SAS Institute Inc, Raleigh, NC, USA).
Results
Demographic data of patients included in the
pooled analysis
The patient population recruited in the three
RCTs selected for the pooled analysis of the data
consisted of 883 patients of both sexes, with a
prevalence of women (69.8%), and a median age
of 46.2 years, as summarized in Table 1. No sig-
nificant differences were observed between the
two treatment groups with respect to demo-
graphic data in the three studies. Table 1 also
includes the baseline clinical features of enrolled
patients suffering mild-to-severe IBS, with >3
episodes of abdominal pain per week, with mod-
erate-to-severe pain intensity, moderate-to-severe
bloating, and abnormal stool consistency. IBS
subtypes could only be derived from studies by
Battaglia and OBIS, and included 25.2% patients
with IBS-D, 31% with IBS-C and 43.8% with
IBS-M. No differences in baseline clinical fea-
tures were observed between OB and placebo
groups (Table 1). Mean treatment compliance
was high and comparable in both treatment
groups at all visits, ranging from 95% to 97%,
and the dropout rates were 16.1% in both the
treatment groups.
OB effect on intensity of abdominal pain
A significant placebo effect was observed from
week 5 (p < 0.001), as abdominal pain score
decreased significantly both in the OB group and
the placebo group at the end of the treatment
(Figure 1). However, the comparison between
treatment groups of the abdominal pain score
reduction from baseline showed a greater effect in
the OB group in comparison with placebo at all
visits with significant differences at week 10 and
week 15 for this primary endpoint (Figure 1).
The GLM model, providing regression analysis
and ANOVA for abdominal pain score reduction
by more factors (treatment group and sex) and
covariates (baseline value of abdominal pain
score, age and BMI), also revealed a significant
therapeutic effect of OB versus placebo at week 10
(p = 0.009) and 15 (p = 0.006) (Figure 1). The
proportion (%) of OB/placebo responders with
regards to intensity of pain was 42.5/36.2 at week
5; 52.7/44.5 at week 10 and 67.1/50.0 at week 15.
Figure 2a depicts the forest plot of responders
according to the intensity of pain evaluated by the
patients, showing a strong therapeutic effect of
OB versus placebo after 10 and 15 weeks of treat-
ment. In addition, the analysis of VAS on abdom-
inal pain at the end of treatment showed significant
improvement of VAS scores for OB, as well as for
placebo treatment, 2.03 ± 1.74 for OB and 2.44
± 2.23 for placebo (p = 0.009). Regarding IBS
subtype analysis, we observed a tendency towards
P Clavé and J Tack
journals.sagepub.com/home/tag 315
a greater reduction of abdominal pain intensity
with OB in comparison with placebo in all groups
at all visits, reaching a significance at week 15 if
all groups were pooled together (p = 0.020). The
reduction of pain intensity by OB was statistically
significant also in the group of patients with pre-
dominant IBS-M (week 15, p = 0.015).
OB effect on the frequency of abdominal pain as
reported by patients
A significant placebo effect was observed from
week 5 (p < 0.001) and at the end of the treat-
ment in the scores of weekly number of episodes
of abdominal pain. They decreased significantly
both in the OB group and in the placebo group
(Figure 3). However, the comparison between
groups showed a favorable trend in the OB group
in comparison with placebo, with significant dif-
ferences at week 10 and week 15 by ANOVA and
at week 15 by GLM (p = 0.002) (Figure 3). The
proportion (%) of OB/placebo responders with
regards to the reduction of number of episodes of
abdominal pain was 54.5/47.4 at week 5;
67.4/58.6 at week 10 and 73.0/60.6 at week 15.
Figure 2b depicts the forest plot of frequency of
abdominal pain evaluated by the patient, showing
a strong therapeutic effect of OB versus placebo
after 10 and 15 weeks of treatment. The compari-
son for IBS subtypes found significant differences
(OB versus placebo) in the group of patients with
predominant IBS-C (week 10, p = 0.031 and

and in all groups combined (week 5, p = 0.044,
week 10, p = 0.011 and week 15, p < 0.001).
OB effect on global evaluation of pain index and
treatment response by patients
A significant placebo effect was observed at week 5
(p < 0.001) and at the end of treatment for the
global evaluation of pain index considering intensity
and frequency of abdominal pain which decreased
significantly both in the OB and in the placebo group
(Figure 4). However, the comparison between treat-
ment groups of this global index of response showed
a greater reduction in the OB group versus the pla-
cebo group, with significant differences at week
10 and week 15 (by ANOVA), and at week 15
(p = 0.003) following the regression analysis in the
GLM (Figure 4). The proportion (%) of OB/pla-
cebo responders with regards to the global evalua-
tion of pain was 60.5/54.9 at week 5; 71.8/62.4 at
week 10 and 77.2/65.8 at week 15. Figure 2c depicts
the forest plot of weekly global evaluation of treat-
ment response evaluated by patients, also showing a
strong therapeutic effect of OB versus placebo after

treatment, the stool frequency score decreased
significantly both in the OB group and in the pla-
cebo group (Figure 5). The analysis included
patients with all evaluations recorded at sched-
uled visits (baseline, week 5, week 10, and week
15). The comparison between treatment groups
showed a trend for a greater reduction of stool
frequency in the OB group in comparison with
placebo, but without significant differences at any
time point (Figure 5). Final scores for stool
frequency at week 15 were 0.35 ± 0.50 for
patients treated with OB and 0.43 ± 0.64 for
patients receiving the placebo (p = 0.76, ns).
Regarding stool consistency, both groups of
patients showed an improvement during the
treatment period. However, OB administration
increased the prevalence of patients with normal
stools during treatment visits versus patients
receiving the placebo, with significant differences
at week 5, with 61.6% patients with normal stools
in the OB group and 53.9% in the placebo group
(p = 0.043). At the end of treatment, after 15
weeks, 74.8% patients in the OB group and
68.5% patients in the placebo group presented
normal stool consistency (p = 0.084, ns).
OB effect on severity of bloating/distension
A relevant placebo effect was observed from week
5 (p < 0.001) in reference to evaluation of bloat-
ing/distension. At the end of the treatment, the
severity of bloating score decreased significantly
both in the OB group and in the placebo group.
However, the pooled analysis revealed a greater
reduction of bloating in the OB group versus the
placebo at all visits, with significant differences at
week 10 and week 15 (Figure 6). The GLM
model, providing a regression analysis for the
severity of bloating score reduction by more fac-
tors and covariate, also revealed a significant ther-
apeutic effect of OB versus placebo at week 10
(p = 0.016) and 15 (p = 0.037). The proportion

OB effect on responders evaluated by
physicians
The proportion (%) of OB/placebo responders
according to global evaluation of IBS symptoms
assessed by physicians was 62.6/46.5 at week 5;
74.6/59.7 at week 10 and 79.1/67.3 at week 15.
The physicians considered the global efficacy as
good or excellent for 38.5% (week 5), 55.0%
(week 10) and 63.9% (week 15) of patients
treated with OB. Figure 2e depicts the forest plot
of responder patients according to the global eval-
uation of pain score, highlighting an overall rele-
vant and significant therapeutic effect of OB
versus placebo.
Discussion
The pooled analysis we performed reveals that
OB is more effective than placebo in the treat-
ment of the most relevant symptoms of IBS and
in the global response to treatment assessed both
by physicians and by patients. The second finding
of the pooled analysis is related to the timing of
the therapeutic benefit of OB compared with pla-
cebo: for most of the efficacy variables, the spe-
cific improvement that can be attributed to OB
started after 10 weeks of treatment and was
maximal and stable until the end of treatment
(at week 15).
The results from this pooled analysis are sup-
ported by the strength of its design, with three
independent but homogeneous studies, an ITT
analysis, a rigorous assessment of the placebo
effect, equal dropout rates, global efficacy out-
comes evaluated by patients and physicians, and
the statistical approach, which included a binary
logistic regression model and forest plots. The
rationale for the specific inclusion of the Battaglia,
the OBIS and the Greek studies in the pooled
analysis is that they are RCTs with the same
experimental design, including a total of 883
patients, thus providing a large study population
to evaluate the efficacy of OB treatment versus
placebo on the main symptoms and global
response of patients with IBS.
This analysis includes some unpublished data,
originating from a RCT conducted in Greece and
filed by a local pharmaceutical company that pro-
duced the drug. The results of the unpublished
(Greek) study are similar to those obtained in the
other studies (Battaglia and OBIS) included in
this analysis (Figure 2a and 2b) and, in some
cases, worse than those reported in the OBIS
study in reference to the frequency of abdominal
pain, the global composite score of pain, and the
responder rates. Overall, our results show OB
treatment is globally effective in a representative
population of patients with mild-to-severe IBS of
different subtypes, further supporting its intro-
duction to clinical practice.
OB has specific pharmacodynamic characteris-
tics, allowing it to counteract the increased pain
sensitivity and the impaired small bowel and
colon motility that characterize IBS [Drossman
et al. 2002]. Visceral hypersensitivity is associated
with the intensity of abdominal pain, while
impaired colonic motility (hypercontractility,
hyperreactivity and increased tone) is associated
with frequency of pain episodes and with impaired
bowel habits [Kanazawa et al. 2008]. Patients
with IBS are thought to present abdominal pain
following stimulation of sensitive nerve endings
located in the intestinal wall by strong tonic or
phasic intestinal contractions in a context of low

threshold of stimulation due to visceral hypersen-
sitivity [Clave, 2011]. The mechanisms of action
of OB in colonic muscle cells, colonic motility
patterns and primary afferent neurons have been
recently revised [Rychter et al. 2014]. Studies
demonstrated a reduction in visceral sensitivity to
rectal balloon distention in IBS patients following
treatment with OB [Baldi et al. 1992; Czimmer
et al. 2001]. The combined action of OB on nor-
malization of exaggerated motility patterns and
inhibition of primary afferent nociceptors proba-
bly underlies the strong therapeutic effects of this
drug on frequency and intensity of abdominal
pain in IBS patients.
The first observation resulting from this pooled
analysis is the relevant placebo effect observed in
all efficacy variables, increasing from the begin-
ning of treatment with a proportion of placebo
responders with regards to the global evaluation
of pain index of 54.9­65.8% patients from week 5
to week 15. This effect is well known in IBS stud-
ies. For example, it was measured previously in a
meta-analysis of 45 placebo-controlled studies
and found to be highly variable, ranging from
16­71%, with an average of >40% [Patel et al.
2005]. Slightly higher rates of placebo response
were also observed in the OBIS study [Clave et al.
2011] and were attributed to the entry criteria of
the study, which included patients with severe
IBS symptoms and hence with a greater chance
for spontaneous improvement, considering the
cyclic nature of IBS.
The second relevant result from our pooled analy-
sis is the strong therapeutic effect of OB, greater
than the placebo response in almost all the primary
efficacy variables (intensity and frequency of pain,
bloating and patient response outcomes, such as
global evaluation of pain considering both inten-
sity and frequency of episodes and VAS, and global
efficacy evaluated by physicians). A previous meta-
analysis by Poynard and colleagues, including four
ancillary clinical studies with OB, also found a sig-
nificant effect of this drug on the proportion of
patients showing an improved global assessment
(odds ratio of 2.33; 95% CI: 1.60 ± 3.40), and an
improvement in pain and distention at the end of
treatment [Poynard et al. 2001]. A meta-analysis
by Lesbros-Pantoflickova found that when exclud-
ing the low-quality trials, an improvement of
global IBS symptoms with all antispasmodics was
maintained only for OB, but on the basis of only
two studies [Lesbros-Pantoflickova et al. 2004].
Finally, a meta-analysis by Ford and colleagues,
including the same four studies selected by
Poynard and colleagues, also suggested a benefi-
cial effect for OB, as symptoms of IBS persisted
in 51% patients treated with OB and in 71%
patients treated with placebo [Ford et al. 2008].
However, these last authors underlined a signifi-
cant heterogeneity among designs and endpoint
of studies, as the sample size in three studies
was small, the duration of treatment varied,
and the largest trial [Glende et al. 2002] showed
only a modest benefit of OB in the rate of
monthly responders, corresponding to 11­14%
[Desborough and Ford, 2011]. The OBIS study
included in this pooled analysis found an effect of
OB in the reduction of episodes of abdominal
pain, reduction of abdominal bloating, global effi-
cacy by patient assessment and protection from
IBS symptom relapse significantly greater than
placebo at the end of the 15-week treatment
period (primary endpoint) [Clave et al. 2011]. In
addition, safety and tolerability of OB was very
high and similar to placebo, a result consistent
with Poynard and colleagues' meta-analysis
[Poynard et al. 2001; Clave et al. 2011]. A study
conducted on Asian patients confirmed the effec-
tiveness of OB in alleviating IBS symptoms
[Chang et al. 2011]. A recent literature review of
the efficacy and tolerability of OB in the long-term
management of patients with IBS confirmed that
this drug reduces abdominal pain and discomfort
in patients with IBS, exhibiting greater efficacy
and tolerability than placebo or other similar drugs
[Triantafillidis and Malgarinos, 2014]. Finally, a
very recent study aiming at evaluating the dose-
response relationship of 20 mg, 40 mg, 80 mg of
OB or placebo administered three times daily for
4 weeks on functional or clinical efficacy IBS vari-
ables demonstrated that 40 mg and 80 mg of OB
can improve individual and global clinical symp-
toms of IBS compared with placebo over a 4-week
period [Chmielewska-Wilkon et al. 2014]. Another
recent literature review found OB was effective
also in comparison with other drugs, such as
pinaverium bromide and mebeverine, with a
favorable tolerability profile [Forte et al. 2012].
Overall, all these studies clearly prove that OB is
well tolerated and is able to improve the symp-
toms of IBS.
Recently, the recommendation on primary end-
points to be used in trials for IBS has been
changed from a co-primary endpoint of global
Therapeutic Advances in Gastroenterology 10(3)

assessment and pain to the separate evaluation of
efficacy on stool-related abnormalities and on
pain [European Medicines Agency, 2014]. In our
pooled analysis, we found that OB improved both
the intensity and the frequency of abdominal pain
(Figure 2). The weak effect of OB administration
on stool frequency and consistency we revealed
could be attributed to an over-simplistic dicho-
tomic analysis (normal/abnormal consistency
instead of the specific Bristol scale) as well as to
the relevant placebo effect, as the OBIS study
showed a slight but significant reduction of stool
frequency at the end of the OB treatment [Clave
et al. 2011].
IBS is a chronic and relapsing disease with cyclic
periods of symptoms and frequent relapses to
short [Jones et al. 1999] and long-term treatments
[Chey et al. 2004]. Antispasmodics are recom-
mended as first line treatment for IBS patients
with pain and bloating as dominant symptoms,
but there is no agreement on the type of protocol
to be selected for treatment (continuous, cyclic or
intermittent, or `on demand'). Recently, an initial
approach of 2­3 months' treatment has been
shown to be effective in most patients [Evangelista,
2012; Boeckxstaens et al. 2013], as also supported
by the relevant therapeutic effect observed at 10
and 15 weeks in this pooled analysis. However,
symptom relapse occurs in up to 50% of IBS
patients, making cyclic treatment necessary.
Consequently, only well-tolerated drugs with
proved effects on the specific relapsing symptoms
should be used [Boeckxstaens et al. 2013]. The
OBIS study revealed that the therapeutic effect of
OB during the 10-week follow-up period subse-
quent to the 15-week treatment period remained
greater than the effect of placebo in terms of
relapse-free probability and withdrawal rate due
to symptom relapse [Clave et al. 2011].
Considering the results from this pooled analysis
together with the outcomes from previous stud-
ies, we can conclude that OB is well tolerated, has
a strong therapeutic effect on abdominal pain,
bloating and rate of responders as assessed by
patients and by physicians, and prevents symp-
tom relapse. OB has been on the market for over
30 years in over 40 countries in Europe, Central
America, Asia (China, India, Pakistan, Korea and
Philippines), the Middle East, and Africa (Egypt,
French African countries). Our findings further
support the therapeutic utility of OB in clinical
practice.
