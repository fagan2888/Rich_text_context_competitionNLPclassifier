Abstract
Researchers in many fields, especially those engaged in the study of gender-based violence, have
shown an interest in using mixed designs as innovative methodological procedures to transform
social realities. In this article, we introduce the ``communicative evaluation of social impact'' as a
methodological tool to reveal the social impact achieved by a multiphase mixed methods design
conducted sequentially on gender-based violence in Spanish universities. This tool shows the
transformative power of mixed methods with a communicative orientation to generate new
legislation, create proper conditions for reporting abuse, and establish new solidarity dynamics
with and among the victims to promote violence-free universities.

Gender-based violence is a global public concern. The 2013 United Nations Women's
Conference focused on eliminating and preventing all forms of violence against women and
girls as part of its efforts to agree on a strategy to overcome all types of discrimination and vio-
lence against women of different ages, contexts, and economic and social backgrounds (United
Nations, 2013). Gender discrimination is a historical fact that must be addressed in all kinds of
institutions across the globe, including universities (Reda & Hamdan, 2015). Violence is partic-
ularly prevalent in institutions where hierarchical power relations remain predominant
(Connell, 1987). As an institution built on power relations, the academy is a prime environment

for gender-based violence (Farley, 1978). In academia, violence varies widely by type, victim
profile, and the context in which it occurs (Copenhaver & Grauerholz, 1991; Gross, Winslett,
Roberts, & Gohm, 2006; Kalof, 1993; Kusakabe & Pearson, 2016). The United States was one
of the first countries to analyze and address the issue of gender-based violence in universities
(Kirkpatrick & Kanin, 1957), as evidenced by the Campus Security Act of 1990 and the Student
Right-To-Know Act1 (Renzetti & Edleson, 2008).
Although much research has been conducted on gender-based violence in universities, scant
attention has been paid to the methodological dimension of this issue. Traditionally, studies on
this topic have been conducted using either quantitative or qualitative methods. However,
research based on a mixed methods design has grown in popularity over the last several years,
along with an appreciation of the implications of this design for the field of gender-based vio-
lence (Campbell, Patterson, & Bybee, 2011; Dardis, Kelley, Edwards, & Gidycz, 2013; Jackson,
1999; Mahlstedt & Keeny, 1993; Testa, Livingston, & Vanzile-Tamsen, 2011). Many of these
studies have to some extent helped change the institutional, political, and legal landscapes of
gender-based violence in universities. However, the path for this change has not always been
easy to find. In this article, we present the possibility of shedding light on the political and social
implications of the first research conducted on gender-based violence in Spanish universities
through the communicative evaluation of social impact (CESI).
The Communicative Evaluation of Social Impact
The CESI, which is framed under the communicative methodology, entails the assessment of
actual social improvements related to research outcomes by collecting data and engaging in dia-
logue with manifold stakeholders. In the present study, CESI confirmed that the development
of solidarity and promotion of awareness of overcoming gender-based violence were social and
political implications of a multiphase mixed methods design conducted sequentially. The pio-
neer research conducted in Spain on university gender-based violence was accomplished
through mixed methods with a communicative approach, which allowed for an intersubjective
process that transformed the university code of silence into the public recognition of this seri-
ous issue embedded in the academy.
The CESI involves (1) a participatory process with diverse stakeholders to make the results
of the research available to society, (2) a communicative process that commences dialogues
with these stakeholders so that they can recreate the results in their own contexts, and (3) new
fieldwork to collect evidence of the impacts achieved by this participatory and communicative
process at both the individual level (i.e., changes in students' or professors' behavior) and the
institutional level (i.e., changes in legislation or programs). Through the CESI, the social and
political implications are revealed along the two phases of the study.
This article begins by explaining how studies of gender-based violence have used mixed
methods designs through a description of pioneering research on gender-based violence in and
beyond the university context. Following this explanation is a section dedicated to contextualiz-
ing the present study in the Spanish setting. Then, both the first and second phases of the
research design are presented in detail. The next section identifies results and social transforma-
tions generated by this body of research in the Spanish university context. In particular, impli-
cations at the policy and practice levels are analyzed; for example, the CESI allowed the
researchers to identify how the first phase of the project led to breaking the silence on this
issue, raising awareness, and creating bonds of solidarity. Finally, the article concludes with a
discussion of the transformative power of mixed methods with a communicative orientation for
research on gender-based violence in universities and emphasizes the contributions of CESI as
a new tool in mixed methods research.

Mixed Methods Research and Gender-Based Violence
Gender-based violence is recognized as a global problem and an everyday reality for many
women. Based on a survey of 42,000 women from the 28 member states of the European Union
regarding different aspects of violence experienced by them, the Agency for Fundamental
Rights (FRA, 2014) concluded that since the age of 15 years, 1 in 10 women has experienced
some form of gender-based violence and 1 in 20 women has been raped. One in five women
has experienced physical or gender-based violence by a current or former partner. In addition to
providing a quantitative description of the prevalence of gender-based violence, this broad study
also shed light on the reasons for, consequences of, and psychological effects of violence in dif-
ferent circumstances, including childhood experiences, partner violence, and stalking. Although
the percentage of women suffering violence is high, this phenomenon is largely unreported
(FRA, 2014). For instance, according to the most extensive survey, only 14% of women
reported the violence they had suffered at the hands of partners or nonpartners. In certain parts
of the world, gender inequalities are more apparent than ever before. Most actions to combat
this problem are focused on the mechanisms of prevention and response (Hadjar, Backes, &
Gysin, 2015; Vladutiu, Martin, & Macy, 2011). Different forms of community involvement,
such as the bystander intervention mechanism, are more effective compared with other sexual
assault prevention programs (Banyard et al., 2005; Coker et al., 2016).
In this context, the mixed methods framework has yielded a better understanding of the com-
plexity of the problem. As explained by Donna Mertens (2015), ``wicked problems'' require an
approach that uses research not only to inform decisions regarding actions but also to develop
strategies useful for studying social inequalities. In this line, Corradi and Sto
¨ckl (2016) consider
institutional involvement in and state responsibility for combatting violence against women.
After presenting a thorough analysis of the mechanisms and policies regarding the role of the
state, social movements, and other agents involved in fighting against violence in 10 European
countries, these authors conclude that although the state is a powerful mechanism, it only reacts
under pressure from supranational bodies connected with social movements.
A relevant strand of research implements mixed methods by integrating quantitative and
qualitative methodologies. Creswell (2009a) notes that mixed methods can be applied from a
variety of perspectives and attributes different functionalities to the techniques employed.
Studies of gender-based violence that use mixed methods share certain common features. For
example, such studies generally begin with quantitative data collection techniques and then use
qualitative data collection techniques--such as interviews, life stories, or discussion groups--to
complement the quantitative data (Collins & Dressler, 2008; Dardis et al., 2013; Peterson &
Muehlenhard, 2007; Quinlan & Quinlan, 2010; Testa et al., 2011). In this way, Testa et al.
(2011) analyze the impact of a Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner program on the prosecution
rates of adult sexual assault cases in a large Midwestern community in the United States. In that
case, the researchers integrate quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques following
a mixed methods design to explain certain quantitative results. For example, the researchers
find that study participants do not always interpret survey questions in the same manner and
thus qualitative data collection techniques are necessary to further explore these issues.
Murphy and O'Leary (1994) suggest that the objective scales used in quantitative studies
often disregard subjective and contextual dimensions. For this reason, they contend that the ben-
efits of mixed methods include the ability to combine qualitative methods designed to theorize
on the basis of knowledge extracted from social contexts and subjective perspectives with tradi-
tional qualitative methods designed to evaluate responses according to deductive logic. Thus,
mixed methods have advanced knowledge on gender-based violence in general and--as will be
shown in the following section--in the university setting in particular.

Previous Research on Gender-Based Violence in Universities
Internationally, previous studies of gender-based violence in universities have employed both
quantitative and qualitative techniques without explicitly acknowledging this methodological
integration or synthesis of findings. In this regard, Choate (2003) attempts to explain participant
reactions to rape prevention programs based on the Men Against vVolence model (Hong, 2000),
which emphasizes the link between male socialization and sexual aggression. Choate explores
the success of the Men Against Violence V program by conducting a pilot study in which an
exploratory evaluation instrument was administered to 149 fraternity members at different uni-
versities. The instrument consisted of a ``program evaluation'' form that included questions
corresponding to three components: first, asking participants to record thoughts in a subjective
way; second, implementing a 5-point Likert-type scale questionnaire; and third, once again ask-
ing participants open-ended questions in a qualitative way. The findings enabled college coun-
sellors to obtain participants' thoughts about and reactions to the program. This manner of
organizing their study made it possible to obtain important insights on how to improve the
implementation of campus rape prevention programs for men in college. These studies thus
draw on prominent scales (e.g., the Rape Myth Acceptance Scale) to understand a more general
context (Coker et al., 2011; Cook-Craig et al., 2014; Moynihan, Banyard, Arnold, Eckstein, &
Stapleton, 2011). The results indicate that people who receive bystander training are more
likely to report such behavior, intervene in violent situations, and feel responsible for ending
violence.
Quantitative research has generally been aimed at measuring the scope of gender-based vio-
lence in universities (Benson & Thomson, 1982). In these studies, quantitative data collection
techniques primarily comprise surveys and questionnaires administered to students (Bryant &
Spencer, 2003; Fisher, Daigle, & Cullen, 2010; Moynihan et al., 2011; Orchowski & Gidycz,
2012). The data are used to analyze incidence rates, types of violence, profiles of victims and
aggressors, circumstances in which violence occurs, and the reactions of victims and those
around them (Banyard et al., 2005; Belknap, Fisher, & Cullen, 1999; Fonow, Richardson, &
Wemmerus, 1992; Kalof, Eby, Matheson, & Kroska, 2001). The outcomes of such research
may lead to gender-based violence prevention programs that train students to become active
bystanders (Coker et al., 2011; Moynihan et al., 2011).
Other researchers have highlighted the problem of sexual harassment tolerance (Bryant &
Spencer, 2003; Reilly, Lott, Caldwell, & DeLuca, 1992), which has subsequently been
addressed through legal regulations such as the Clery Act (Cantalupo, 2012) and in university
policies (McMahon, 2008). Research on gender-based violence on U.S. campuses has proven
crucial to recent approaches to end this problem. In 2014, President Obama established the
Task Force to Protect Students from Sexual Assault (White House Task Force to Protect
Students from Sexual Assault, 2014); one of its first objectives was to consult studies, espe-
cially those that could help overcome gender-based violence in universities. However, such
studies have failed to clearly identify how mixed methods research efforts can change unac-
commodating university climates (Mertens, 2015).
To obtain more comprehensive data regarding the causes of violence, especially among col-
lege students (Mahlstedt & Welsh, 2005), researchers have used in-depth interviews, focus
groups, and essays or scripts on violent situations. These studies have greatly contributed to stu-
dents' perceptions of social environments in which gender-based violence occurs and have
opened up new avenues to prevent such violence (Koelsch, Brown, & Boisen, 2012; Littleton,
Tabernik, Canales, & Backstrom, 2009; Mahlstedt & Welsh, 2005). Armstrong, Hamilton, and
Sweeney (2006) highlight individual, organizational, and interactional processes that increase
the prevalence of gender-based violence. Through a documented revision of prevention
4 Journal of Mixed Methods Research
programs (e.g., motivational interventions, dialectical behavior therapy, mindfulness, and
bystander interventions), Shorey et al. (2012) advance methodological reflections on dating vio-
lence prevention programs for college students. According to these authors, one of the most
important methodological considerations at the time of program implementation concerns the
effects of the treatment of longitudinal data on a program's efficacy. This type of research has
also helped identify those interventions that are more effective at preventing violence at such
institutions and the capacities maintained and reinforced on university campuses that directly
impact interventions.
Our review of the literature on gender-based violence in universities framed under a mixed
methods design leads to the conclusion that better integration can be sought.
As Testa et al. (2011) noted, mixed methods approaches to the study of gender-based vio-
lence involve the integration of quantitative and qualitative methodologies to create synergy,
which in turn leads to a more in-depth understanding. Given the evidence of the transformative
potential of mixed methods (Collins & Dressler, 2008; Mertens, 2007; Sorde & Mertens, 2014),
these designs should be of great value to researchers who aim to better comprehend and analyze
gender-based violence within universities. Mixed methods studies can illuminate additional
ways to overcome this problem by shedding light on more effective mechanisms to prevent and
respond to gender-based violence and sexual victimization in universities.
Previous Research on Gender-Based Violence in Spanish Universities
The consideration of gender-based violence in Spain as a public issue to be addressed is fairly
recent. The Spanish parliament passed pioneering legislation in 1989 to establish domestic vio-
lence as a women's rights issue. The first national plan, which included training, data collection,
and restraining orders, was issued in 1998; only a couple of years later, the Spanish ``Integral
Law against Gender Violence'' was approved (Roggeband, 2012).
The first attempt to tackle gender-based violence in universities occurred in 1995, when
Professor Ramon Flecha of the University of Barcelona, then director of the Community of
Researchers on Excellence for All (CREA2), wrote to the university's governing body about
the need to address violence against women. Flecha contended that his strategy reflected the
approach taken by top-ranked global universities and proposed the creation of a commission to
oversee related work. Flecha never received an official reply to his request (Giner, 2011).
According to a study by Roggeband (2012), the Spanish context for addressing gender-based
violence was framed by strong feminist mobilization and left-wing governments. In the univer-
sity context, faculty members joined the struggle in 1999, when SAPPHO, CREA's women
group, was created. Although everyone on campus discussed the issue of gender-based violence
and claimed to have information about the perpetrators, no one dared to report them.
Several researchers have proposed projects related to gender-based violence in universities
to funding bodies. Of the 6,955 approved RTD projects (funded by the Women's Institute or
the Ministry of Education and Culture) conducted between 1983 and 2005, not one focused on
gender-based violence in universities. Only in 2005 did CREA's SAPPHO obtain national fund-
ing to conduct the present research project--after proposing one in 2002--which was the first
study to consider university gender-based violence in Spain and led to access to research regard-
ing sexual harassment and to recognition of the issue.
The project was funded within a context of broader political awareness of the need to address
gender-based violence. In 2004, Spain passed the first Organic Law Against Gender Violence
in Europe. CREA researchers and policy makers discussed CREA's work to prevent the sociali-
zation of gender-based violence, which created opportunities to address the problem in Spanish
universities as well. In this context, the first step entailed the accumulation of statistical data on
Puigvert et al. 5
the scope and occurrence of gender-based violence at Spanish universities, which is precisely
what our study was designed to do.
Background for Our Study
The present article is based on a study funded by the Spanish Institute for Women on gender-
based violence in universities, which was the first to shed light on this previously unacknowledged
reality in Spain (Valls, Puigvert, Melgar & Garcia-Yeste, 2016). This research effort is also dedi-
cated to identifying successful programs developed at some of the most prestigious universities in
the world and advocating for their implementation at Spanish institutions. This study represents a
turning point in Spanish academia because for the first time in its history--and despite notable
resistance--something is being done to address the issue of gender-based violence.
Breaking the silence on this issue was no easy task. Leading researchers were subjected to
criticism and sexist remarks, most of which were delivered anonymously or disseminated
through social networks. Rumors regarding the lead researchers' sexual lives were spread to dis-
credit their intellectual reputations. For instance, researchers were accused of using sexual rela-
tionships to further their academic careers. This campaign focused on discrediting not only those
researchers who had long worked in this area but also those who had recently started supporting
them. Such reactions are captured by our definition of second order of sexual harassment (Vidu,
Valls, Puigvert, Melgar, & Joanpere, 2017), which is the use of physical and/or psychological
violence against those who support victims of sexual harassment. This pattern was identified in
previous research several decades ago (Dziech & Weiner, 1990). In Spain, these attacks within
the university community were designed to hinder the academic careers of female researchers
and professors who dared to break the silence. These efforts provided a clear warning to the
entire university community of the consequences of joining the efforts to break the silence. The
experience of one student who applied for a predoctoral fellowship to work on gender-based vio-
lence reflects these attitudes. Professors in the student's department attempted to persuade her
not to work with professors from CREA, telling her that it would cause problems. This informa-
tion turned out to be accurate. Once the student decided to work with a CREA professor, several
faculty members in the student's department implemented every possible barrier to prevent her
from receiving a fellowship and conducting the planned work (Giner, 2011).
Due to these personal attacks, implementing the current mixed methods research was not an
easy journey. For instance, data collection efforts were hampered by resistance and negative
feedback from institutions and individuals in the university community; some even declined to
participate in the study. However, these difficulties were addressed through a very focused
search for key informants and by reassuring participants of their anonymity. The qualitative
component of our study helped capture this overarching context, wherein much opposition was
encountered not only when conducting research on gender-based violence at institutions of
higher education but also when developing regulations designed to prevent or address such vio-
lence. In the second phase of this mixed methods research process, a communicative evaluation
of social impact was conducted to reveal all the transformations resulting from the first phase.
Purpose Statement
The mixed methods research presented herein was developed using communicative methodol-
ogy. The European Commission has recognized communicative methodology for its ability to
transform studied realities and thus to overcome specific social barriers (European Commission,
2011b). Communicative methodology has been applied in projects implemented under the
Framework Programs and Horizon 2020 of the European Commission.3 Of these initiatives, the
6 Journal of Mixed Methods Research
INCLUD-ED project was selected by the European Commission (2011a) among the top 10
research projects as the Social Sciences and Humanities project with the greatest social impact.
The methodology has demonstrated its transformative potential through these projects and in
several different social contexts with diverse cultural features.
Under the communicative methodology framework, knowledge is constructed through inter-
actions between science and society. This framework integrates objectivity and subjectivity by
promoting an intersubjective and egalitarian dialogue between researchers and ``researched
agents'' while simultaneously fostering reflection among those involved in the research process,
which results in a dialogic creation of knowledge (J. Go
´mez, Latorre, Sa
´nchez, & Flecha,
2006). Special emphasis is placed on conditions for dialogue throughout the entire research pro-
cess, from research design to development, analysis, and result dissemination (A. Go
´mez, Siles,
& Tejedor, 2012; Padro
´s, Garcia, de Mello, & Molina, 2011). The views of experts (or research-
ers) are not imposed on nonexperts (Beck, Giddens, & Lash, 1994). Debates are based on valid-
ity claims and not claims of power (Habermas, 1984), which is especially critical when
analyzing a highly hierarchical context such as Spanish academe because it gives a voice to
those who traditionally hold less power in the higher education environment (i.e., students, non-
tenured faculty, and staff). Thus, scientific knowledge of gender-based violence in universities
was extracted from a literature review, whereas the results of surveys conducted at Spanish uni-
versities were introduced in the qualitative phase. Through this dialogue, both researchers and
participants discussed how scientific evidence could be recreated in the specific context of
Spanish universities. In turn, specific proposals for addressing gender-based violence in Spanish
higher education were obtained to facilitate transformations in this context.
The communicative methodology distances itself from methodologies based on deficit the-
ories, focusing instead on each individual's capacity to evaluate and transform his or her own
life (Flecha, 2014). Such transformation is not promoted solely by researchers or participants.
Rather, transformation is possible because the subjects engaged in the communicative research
process enter an intersubjective dialogue with researchers, thus prompting a series of debates
that lead them not only to reach agreements and generate new knowledge but also to become
agents in changing their own reality (Roca, Go
´mez, & Burgue
´s, 2015).
Research Design
The study was framed under a multiphase mixed methods design conducted sequentially. First,
we used an initial convergent design comprising a survey and semistructured interviews; then,
a second qualitative phase was conducted to explain the main findings of the first phase and to
evaluate the social impact of these results (Creswell, 2009b; Teddlie & Tashakkori, 2009). The
first phase of the study (from 2005 to 2008) involved the combination of quantitative and quali-
tative data collection techniques using a questionnaire; the results of this process formed the
basis for concrete guidelines for in-depth interviews and communicative daily life stories
(CDLS). The second phase was qualitative and included the CESI, and CDLS were conducted
to explain the findings of the first phase.
In Figure 1, we show the sequence of the research process.
During the first phase, data were collected to address the following two research questions:
(1) What is the extent of gender-based violence in Spanish universities? (2) What measures
taken in university contexts can help overcome gender-based violence? This part of the study
was the convergent quantitative and qualitative phase, during which a survey was distributed to
students and semistructured in-depth interviews and CDLS were conducted (A. Go
´mez,
Racionero, & Sorde, 2010). The second phase involved a CESI, that is, a communicative
assessment designed to identify the social impact of the research (Flecha, Soler-Gallart, &
Puigvert et al. 7
Sorde
´, 2015), particularly whether the situation of gender-based violence at universities had
improved. During the second phase, data were collected by means of CDLS to address the fol-
lowing question: What is the social impact of the research on gender-based violence at Spanish
universities?
First Phase (2006-2008): Convergent Design Using Quantitative and Qualitative Data
Collection Techniques
Data Collection and Analysis
Survey. The main purpose of the survey was to provide an overview of the cases that we
later recognized as gender-based violence within the university setting. The survey instrument
was developed based on information extracted from our review of previous literature and in
consideration of the Spanish university context (Fisher, Cullen, & Turner, 1999; Gross et al.,
2006; Jaspard, Saurel-Cubizolles, & E
´quipe Enveff, 2003). The resulting instrument comprised
91 questions divided into 5 sections: (1) sociodemographic information, (2) recognition of
gender-based violence, (3) cases of gender-based violence in the university context, (4) victim
reactions, and (5) resources, including resources that are available and measures that should be
taken to prevent and overcome gender-based violence in universities. All questions included in
the four last sections of the questionnaire were closed-ended questions, each of which had
between 2 and 14 different response options. The first section (sociodemographic information)
included questions related to place of birth, place of residence, and age and did not have closed
answer options. There were no open-ended questions in the other sections of the questionnaire.
The questionnaire was distributed to students. A multistage sampling technique was
employed to recruit participants (university students). Six Spanish universities in various geo-
graphic locations with diverse socioeconomic and cultural backgrounds and student body sizes
were selected. Then, quotas were established to ensure a diversity of student participants by
gender, knowledge area, and degree type. Specific survey dates, times, and locations were
established so that students who wished to participate could complete the survey at a specified
location. The survey was publicized in advance in classrooms and cafeterias and through
administrative offices and student associations. The questionnaire was completed by 1,083 stu-
dents, of which 67% were female and 33% were male. The mean age was 23 years, with a stan-
dard deviation of 4.7 years, a margin of error of 62.97%, and a confidence interval of 95%
(see Table 1).
Semistructured in-depth interviews and CDLS. These techniques were applied among students,
faculty, and administrative staff to acquire a more thorough understanding of the problem. From
Figure 1. Research design: Sequential mixed methods.
8 Journal of Mixed Methods Research
2007 to 2008, 13 in-depth interviews were conducted with faculty and administrative staff, and
16 CDLS sessions were conducted with students. Seventeen participants were women, and 12
were men. In all cases, participants were affiliated with different disciplines (e.g., medicine,
law, psychology, economics, education). The interviews were designed to collect the views of
professionals employed at the institution and of those who represent the system, whereas the
CDLS was intended to capture the views of students, who presented unique outlooks based on
their life stages and personal experiences.
CDLS differs from traditional daily life stories because the former involves a dialogic pro-
cess of inquiry between the researcher and the participant that seeks mutual understanding.
CDLS should be conducted in the participant's natural environment to avoid any distortion of
communication. A dialogic interpretation is needed to project future participant expectations
and to capture aspects of the present and of his or her immediate past, which provide an indica-
tion of how the subject lives, thinks and behaves in her or his daily life.
Semistructured, in-depth interviews and CDLS require a shared reflection on survey results,
which contributes to a broader recognition of cases of gender-based violence. Consequently,
more detailed information was obtained based on the interviewees' knowledge and identifica-
tion of gender-based violence cases and on the roles played by the institution. The information
gathered focused on institutional responses, the effects of these responses on victims, and
whether the participants knew what to do when they realized that they (or someone close to
them) was a victim. Shared reflections about the types of measures participants would like to
see implemented in Spanish universities were also included (see Table 2).
Communicative data analysis. All the survey responses were introduced and analyzed with a
statistical software package. Descriptive univariate analysis was conducted. First, we ran a fre-
quency analysis with the main data; then, we introduced a crosstab analysis based primarily on
two main qualitative variables. The purpose of this crosstab analysis was to analyze the degree
to which university students identify with gender-based violence situations. The two variables
were assigned to students who answered ``no'' to a question regarding ``whether they knew of
any cases of violence against women that had occurred at their university or between individu-
als of the university community'' (first variable) and to those who indicated that they were
aware of or had experienced one or several types of gender-based violence (second variable;
i.e., physical aggression; psychological violence; sexual aggression; pressure to have sexual or
emotional relationships; nonconsensual kissing or touching; discomfort with or fear of remarks,
looks, e-mails, phone calls, persecution, or surveillance; rumors about one's sex life; sexist
remarks about the intellectual capacities of women or their role in society; or remarks with
hateful or humiliating sexual connotations).
Regarding the qualitative data used, the analysis followed the double axis of transformative
and exclusionary dimensions (horizontal axis) and the 12 subcategories that emerged from the

literature review and questionnaire (vertical axis; Pulido, Elboj, Campdepadro
´s, & Cabre
´,
2014). For the horizontal axis, the transformative dimension refers to elements that can illumi-
nate means to transform cases of social injustice or to analyze inequality. In this study, the
transformative dimension refers to participants' perceptions and assessments of situations of
gender-based violence that were resolved through university involvement, thereby creating an
environment of solidarity with the victim. Information regarding the transformative dimension
refers to narratives of gender-based violence within university contexts in which participants
took a stand and defended the victim.
The exclusionary dimension refers to elements that reflect barriers to overcoming social
inequalities. In this case, in particular, the exclusionary dimension refers to views held by the
university community about scenarios in which gender-based violence was considered ``natura-
lized'' and in which ``taking a stand'' was very unlikely to occur. Elements classified as exclu-
sionary include resistance by university authorities to establish protocols against gender-based
violence, which makes it difficult to report instances of violence. For the vertical axis, the 12
subcategories were grouped under two main categories: (1) measures implemented at presti-
gious international universities and (2) knowledge of instances of gender-based violence and of
the role played by the university.
Main Results of the First Phase. This first phase yielded groundbreaking results regarding the
Spanish university context. Three main findings must be highlighted: the lack of identification
and recognition of gender-based violence; institutional resistance to addressing this issue; and
the absence of measures to respond to this reality, especially measures to create spaces of sup-
port for and solidarity with the victims. The quantitative results showed a clear lack of identifi-
cation and recognition of gender-based violence in the university context. Whereas
approximately 62% of students had experienced gender-based violence within a university set-
ting or knew someone who had experienced it, only 13% of the participants actually identified
these situations as gender-based violence.
Conclusions from the qualitative fieldwork emphasize university efforts to hide or discredit
cases of gender-based violence. According to the interviewees, this attitude is attributable to the
hierarchical structure of Spanish universities that renders those in positions of power immune to
punishment. In conjunction with the findings of previous studies, 85% of the students and quali-
tative fieldwork participants stressed the need to create spaces of support, assistance, and soli-
darity within universities to affirm victims and overcome gender-based violence. Participants
also indicated that introducing the results of this study to public debate was critical to provoke a
conversation on a topic that had never before been discussed publicly.

Second Qualitative Phase (2008-2014): Communicative Evaluation of Social Impact
Data Collection and Analysis. For the CESI, observations about the impact of our initial results
were collected over several years through dialogue with different stakeholders. Dialogue about
the first-phase results took place in diverse settings in the university community, at national
and international conferences and through numerous classroom presentations; we also sent our
results to various regional ombudsmen, scientific publishers, and documentary filmmakers who
publicized our findings. Introducing our research to major civil society organizations that aim
to eradicate gender-based violence was also crucial. We followed up on our initial contacts with
meetings, exchanges, and working groups to introduce changes at higher education institutions
and to develop new legislation.
In 2014, this participatory process was contrasted with and complemented by seven CDLS
conducted with faculty and students to assess the implications of the research conducted during
the first phase. The key informants were selected based on the following two criteria: (1) in-
depth knowledge of our study and how it had developed and (2) explicit recognition of gender-
based violence in their own institutions and a commitment to addressing the problem (i.e., a
history of support for the implementation of specific measures to prevent and address gender-
based violence in universities). Thus, all participants had previously engaged in dialogue and
reflection on the initial results and on ways to make universities safer. For example, one student
interviewee had sought help from the research team and committed faculty members to address
situations in which she felt unsafe. Seven participants were selected (six faculty members and
one student; one male and six females).
The CDLS discussions focused on the results obtained in the first phase--particularly the
repercussions of having engaged diverse social agents in the research--as part of the communi-
cative orientation. Data collection during the second phase centered on how changes had made
universities safer in terms of gender-based violence (see Table 3).
Communicative data analysis. For our analysis of the CDLS, transcripts were transcribed and
coded. On the horizontal axis, our analysis was based on the distinction between the transfor-
mative and exclusionary dimensions. Thus, we distinguished between elements that have sup-
ported gender-based violence prevention in Spanish universities and those that have hindered
this process. On the vertical axis, we differentiated between systems and agency, and several
subcategories were assigned to each. This categorization allowed us to identify changes made
at the system level (i.e., legal systems, universities, schools, the public domain) and the agency
level (i.e., attitudes toward the issue, relations to victims, networks).
These seven CDLS were contrasted with the results from the first phase using the same com-
municative data analysis. The social impact achieved by the first phase was taken into account

in the CDLS analysis in the second phase. The interpretation of the final results was ultimately
established by engaging with representatives from the different participant groups.
Results
The mixed methods approach has been shown to be fruitful not only in the analysis of gender-
based violence in society as a whole but also in the study of this problem within the university
context. Since this research project was started, the communicative orientation of this methodo-
logical approach has enabled major changes regarding gender-based violence in Spanish uni-
versities. In this regard, the CESI was instrumental in promoting awareness of the issue and
developing solidarity with the victims in Spanish universities and in achieving relevant institu-
tional changes for the prevention of and response to gender-based violence. Accordingly, this
research has had implications at certain universities, especially due to students' involvement in
the cause. For the first time in Spanish history, students are mobilized around this cause; they
are asking for effective measures to combat sexual harassment in university, demanding institu-
tional support for victims, challenging university protection of perpetrators, and seeking to
ensure that victims are not forced to enroll in classes taught by their alleged harassers.
Additionally, the first peer-to-peer network providing support and solidarity to victims was
established. Due to the emergence of this issue and the increased solidarity among certain
faculty and peers, the first formal reports of gender-based violence were filed at Spanish univer-
sities. Without a mixed methods approach and communicative orientation to engage partici-
pants throughout the research process, the final repercussions would not have been possible.
The research described in this article also has several implications for Spain at large. The
communicative process that inspired a dialogue about the present research results among mem-
bers of the Spanish Parliament influenced the Law for the Effective Equality between Women
and Men,4 which passed in 2007, by compelling all universities to have ``policies for the resolu-
tion of sexual harassment in public administrations.'' As a result of this process, Spanish legisla-
tion acknowledged for the first time that gender-based violence occurs in higher education and
made it mandatory for Spanish universities to deploy resources to address reports of gender-
based violence. Thus, ``equality units'' have been established in all universities to develop pro-
tocols to address gender-based violence and protect the victims. Several years later, through a
new dialogue process, a regional Parliament decided to address the issue by discussing how it
could ensure that universities are actually implementing this legislation.
The results are also positive for the field of gender-based violence: silence is being broken,
more cases are being discussed, and activism is on the rise, as observed in the implementation
of training courses for the entire university community. In addition, the first conference on vic-
tims of second-order sexual harassment was organized, featuring scholars who had played key
roles in this struggle in the United States; these scholars spoke about the necessity of mobilizing
people from below and the importance of peer-to-peer support. In the following sections, we
present a more thorough explanation of how the CESI contributed to the revelation of the mani-
fold social impact achieved by the first phase of our study.
Breaking the Silence and Overcoming the Fear of Reporting
Data collection efforts--and the CDLS sessions in particular--served as the first means of dis-
cussing gender-based violence in the university setting. Participants' narratives showed that the
communicative methodology created conditions for dialogue that encouraged students who par-
ticipated in the fieldwork to report abuse. The methodology also succeeded in creating a safe
environment that avoided the traditional hierarchy between researchers and participants, making
12 Journal of Mixed Methods Research
it possible to engage in an extended conversation on an issue that was previously considered
``taboo'' within the academic realm and to attach a name to a problem that had always existed.
Moreover, these dialogue spaces involved not only research participants but also other rele-
vant stakeholders who were involved in subsequent dissemination activities. Thus, recommen-
dations for a ``zero violence'' policy were reiterated during public events and in private
conversations with various stakeholders, including politicians.
A concrete example relates to a seminar held in November 2009 at the Women's Institute, a
governmental body that focuses on women's issues. Researchers presented data regarding vic-
tims' reactions to cases of violence, noting that 91% of victims decided not to report incidents
but that a high percentage (66%) of them described the incidents to someone else. Among those
who reported incidents, the vast majority (69%) felt uncertain about receiving support from the
university (Valls et al., 2016). For many university administrators attending this seminar, these
data revealed student perceptions of institutional ``passivity'' regarding cases of gender-based
violence. Therefore, these events were of great importance because they prompted university
representatives to take a public stand and commit to recognizing the existence of gender-based
violence in their universities. Consequently, individuals from several universities across Spain
contacted the research team to obtain more information, especially about what can be done in
universities to address this issue. Additionally, many professors have requested more informa-
tion or have even invited the researchers to their respective universities to explain the results of
the study in order to justify attention to this issue at their institutions. Meetings, workshops, and
even follow-up conferences were organized to widely disseminate the results and to raise aware-
ness at their regional universities. It is important that people who truly wanted to improve their
universities through these mechanisms turned to us for guidance. As Gabriela, a faculty member
who attended the conference, explains,
The result of this pioneering research is that for the first time, when the issue comes up, many peo-
ple have the sense that ``I'm not alone. It's not only happening at my university, etc.'' I think it's an
unstoppable process initiated by this study being made public. It had an impact on the national press
and has been widely discussed. This, in turn, has encouraged people to start bringing cases forward,
and institutions have recognized the consequences and the problems. You can agree or not, but you
know that legally you can be in big trouble. (Gabriela, 2014)
Thus, another important impact was the inclusion in the 2007 Law for the Effective Equality
between Women and Men5 of the obligation of all universities to establish equality units to
oversee all cases of gender-based violence occurring at Spanish universities. At the time of this
writing, equality units at 37 Spanish public universities have implemented protocols to combat
sexual harassment. The first such protocol was approved in 2011, showing that the process of
changing hierarchical university structures may be slow but change is possible and currently
underway.
Overall, the data show that the first phase of the project has influenced the perception and
treatment of gender-based violence by Spanish authorities and universities, indicating that the
project successfully transformed gender-based violence at universities into a public issue.
Solidarity With and Among Victims
The atmosphere described above implies a turning point for university campuses. Harassers can
no longer rely on silence from victims and on complicity from the university community. The
situations described herein have created opportunities to file formal reports of gender-based vio-
lence. According to our analysis, the implicit law of silence has changed and sexual harassment
Puigvert et al. 13
is no longer normalized, which has promoted more solidarity with victims. As one student parti-
cipant noted, ``Now it is more difficult to harass'' (Luci
´a, 2014).
Cristina, one of the interviewees, is a faculty member; during the first phase of our research,
she was a postdoctoral researcher at a prestigious European social sciences institution. She
explained how this research helped her when an instance of sexual harassment occurred at her
dormitory. Specifically, Cristina's response was to support the victim:
When the incident occurred, I spoke with members of the research team. ( . . . ) I took care of her
[the victim], and I advised her because I knew, based on your research, what campaigns were say-
ing about gender-based violence, such as ``Tell someone.'' Someone must take care of the victim
and protect her. So, I accompanied her to her room after all dinners and parties. (Cristina, 2014)
In her narrative, Cristina also explained that incidents of sexual harassment within the academic
context are not isolated but rather occur much more frequently than commonly believed. This
led her to respond and to assume that her struggle against gender-based violence was not limited
to that one concrete case. Cristina realized that she needed to do something more and decided to
bring the results of the investigation to the entire university campus by launching a victim soli-
darity campaign. Thus, Cristina's case illustrates how she became both a protector of a victim
and an agent of social transformation at her university.
Similarly, in late 2013, the Solidarity Network of Victims of Gender Violence in Universities6
was created to provide dialogue, reflection, and support. This network was founded and has
been promoted primarily by students and certain faculty members (including researchers who
participated in this study) as a response to institutional passivity toward gender-based violence.
This platform aims to support victims of gender-based violence in universities and to raise
awareness of the problem by organizing public events and direct action. The network has been
included in the ``good practices'' database of the Spanish Observatory of Gender Violence.7
Lucia, one of the founding members of the network, explained how the platform has become a
support mechanism:
Although victims have experienced significant pressure from the university to solve this issue with-
out making a fuss ( . . . ), they now come together and get support from certain faculty members
and other students. This is really working. ( . . . ) Victims have come to speak with us. . . . We have
explained to them what we have done and how we have confronted the issue. ( . . . ) For the vic-
tims, it has been very motivating to find support. We see that victims are not ugly girls or sad; on
the contrary, they are very brave girls, capable of doing many things. (Luci
´a, 2014)
Establishing this first support network in Spain illustrates the agency of those who have partici-
pated in these dialogue spaces to transform their environment and bring attention to the struggle
against gender-based violence in Spanish universities. Lucia highlights victims' decisions to
unite against passive institutional responses. These environments have empowered victims to
take responsibility and speak up.
In sum, the CESI results show that using mixed methods with a communicative orientation
and disseminating the initial results has raised awareness of this issue among individuals in the
university community and beyond and has strengthened their agency. Creating safe spaces
where gender-based violence can be discussed was crucial to allow members of the university
community to reflect on their own experiences and thereby identify violent situations they may
have experienced. Furthermore, conversations regarding preventative measures implemented at
prominent universities have prompted action against gender-based violence within the univer-
sity community. Hence, this pioneering research has proven essential for encouraging
14 Journal of Mixed Methods Research
individuals to denounce gender-based violence, break the silence and organize at the regional
and national levels.
Ethical Issues
The fact that gender-based violence is a highly sensitive issue--that most often cannot be dis-
cussed openly--was taken into account. Full confidentiality was guaranteed to the participants.
Moreover, participants' preferences were respected (e.g., conducting fieldwork in a setting more
familiar to the participant or meeting off campus). Another crucial element involved structuring
questions in the third person, asking whether a participant or someone he or she knew had expe-
rienced gender-based violence. A participant was not required to identify himself or herself as a
victim if he or she did not want to do so. Consequently, victims who feared the consequences of
telling their stories could explain what happened without identifying as a victim. During both
quantitative and qualitative data collection, all participants were provided with contact informa-
tion (telephone number and email) in case they had further questions or wanted to discuss any-
thing related to gender-based violence at Spanish universities. Providing contact information for
follow-up discussions was necessary for two reasons. First, because certain participants began
to identify, throughout the research process, violent situations of which they had previously been
unaware. Second, no mechanisms for addressing this issue existed in Spanish universities during
the first phase of the research; therefore, the study was their first contact with the topic.
Discussion
The CESI includes a methodological design that allows researchers to gather evidence of the
social impact of the research results, as well as evidence regarding the methodological aspects
of the study that made this impact possible. Through CDLS and the other dialogic spaces cre-
ated during the process, narratives from diverse stakeholders in the university context provided
proof of concrete social impacts at both personal and institutional levels.
The present study had implications for the universities involved. The opportunity to dialogue
with researchers about supposed cases of gender violence in safe spaces and with guaranteed
confidentiality increased awareness and reporting. In addition, knowledge about the results of
the study has led people in academia to raise awareness of the issue and to increase solidarity
with the victims of sexual harassment, facilitating that others dare to take a stand and to step
forward to support victims. Therefore, the dissemination of the results through academic, social,
and political forums has been crucial for creating an environment within the university in which
remaining silent in the face of this issue is beginning to be viewed as conspiratorial to harass-
ment. As one scholar and activist in the field of gender-based violence in U.S. universities has
stated, ``If you are not part of the solution, you are part of the problem.''
There are also important implications for Spain, not only for the universities involved but
also for the Spanish university system as a whole. The CESI revealed how the communicative
approach to a mixed methods study on gender-based violence was crucial to sharing both quan-
titative and qualitative results regarding the occurrence of this problem with key stakeholders
in policy making, who in turn changed the legislation. Since 2007, Spanish universities are
required to have equality units and protocols for the prevention of and response to sexual har-
assment. Whereas there was once a code of silence about this problem--including among staff
members with academic responsibility who knew about cases and did nothing about them--this
study has definitively broken the silence in Spain. For instance, the governmental agency for
science and technology disseminated the results of the study and asked the researchers about its
consequences and implications; as a result, there has been a significant impact in the general
Puigvert et al. 15
media that reaches Spanish citizens and society as a whole. All these effects are part of the
CESI process, and as a result, there is a general consensus today that gender violence is a prob-
lem that must be addressed in Spanish universities.
This study and its methodology has implications for the field of research on gender-based
violence. First, this study contributes groundbreaking data about the Spanish landscape--both
quantitative and qualitative--to the international literature. It also contributes to the state of the
art on mechanisms and processes that are effective (or not) for overcoming this problem beyond
the university context. The CESI helps gather evidence about changes and transformations
achieved as a consequence of research results and processes and therefore opens up a new line
of study on gender-based violence, not only on the identification of the problem but also on
how to effectively address it.
Finally, the present study contributes to the development of mixed methods research. The
results of CESI presented in this article show how the communicative orientation of this
research helped overcome resistance while transforming personal and institutional conditions.
We have shown that mixed methods research effectively creates new settings, conditions, and
environments to support violence-free universities. Therefore, we present the theoretical ratio-
nale underlying the Communicative Evaluation of Social Impact as a methodological approach
that helps gather evidence about both the social impact of research and the procedure and meth-
odology that make this impact possible. Research projects often end with the publication of
results in academic forums and thus researchers rarely know how society has benefited from
their results. However, we have shown not only that the CESI allows the accumulation of data
on the social impact of research but also that the mixed methods design and communicative
approach can facilitate this impact. Mixed methods researchers can therefore reveal the social
impact of their research by conducting CESI.
Through this process, we have provided evidence that change within universities is possible,
so that they can become the type of institutions where we--without any doubt--want our
daughters and granddaughters to study: safe spaces free of any type of gender-based violence.
