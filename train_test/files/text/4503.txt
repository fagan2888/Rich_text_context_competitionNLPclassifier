Introduction
Coronary heart disease (CHD) is one of the leading causes
of death worldwide. Many studies have revealed that the
interaction between various environmental factors and cer-
taingeneticpolymorphismsmayleadtoCHD.Dyslipidemia
have been documented as risk factors for CHD.
Apolipoprotein B (apoB) is the sole protein component of
low-density lipoprotein (LDL) which plays an important
role in atherogenesis. The relationship between CHD and
apoB gene polymorphisms has been a hotspot in recent
years. The apoB gene is located on chromosome 2 and
comprises 29 exons.1 Numerous studies have focused on
the correlation between the apoB gene polymorphism and
CHD risk. However, these studies result in conflicting con-
clusions. Previous meta-analyses exploring the association
between the apoB polymorphisms and CHD risk were also
contradictory. Chiodini et al. found no evidence of increased
risk emerged for XbaI polymorphism,2 but positive associ-
ations were detected for EcoRI and SpIns/Del polymor-
phisms in CHD patients. Boekholdt et al. found that

Abstract
Objective: Polymorphisms in the apolipoprotein B (apoB) gene have been reported to be associated with coronary
heart disease (CHD). However, the results on this topic are conflicting. The present study aims to derive a more precise
estimation of the relationship between CHD and apoB genetic polymorphisms by meta-analysis.
Methods: We identified a total of 54 studies involving 7236, 10,912, and 14,102 individuals, respectively, for EcoRI, XbaI,
and SpIns/Del polymorphisms by searching in PubMed, Web of Science, Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang
Data, SinoMed, and CNKI. We utilized RevMan 5.0 software to perform the meta-analyses.
Results: A significant statistical association between apoB EcoRI polymorphism and CHD was observed under an allelic
(p = 0.001, odds ratio (OR) = 1.33, 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.12­1.57), dominant (p = 0.005, OR = 1.22, 95% CI
= 1.06­1.40), and recessive (p = 0.04, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.01­1.74) model. We also found similar association of apoB
SpIns/Del polymorphism with CHD. However, we did not find association between apoB XbaI polymorphism and CHD.
Conclusion: The current meta-analysis found an association of EcoRI polymorphism and SpIns/Del polymorphism with
an increased risk of CHD. No significant association between apoB XbaI polymorphism and CHD we observed in the
present study.

homozygotes for the XbaI C allele had significantly ele-
vated levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C) and apoB,3 but a
decreased risk of CHD in Caucasian populations.
Homozygosity for the SpIns/Del D allele was associated
with similarly increased levels of LDL-C and apoB, and
with an increased risk of CHD. Homozygous subjects for
the rare EcoRI allele had significantly decreased levels of
total and LDL cholesterol. Chen et al. performed a study by
collecting and sorting the previously published studies in
Chinese individuals,4 providing evidence that EcoRI A
allele and XbaI C allele polymorphisms were a risk factor
for the development of CHD, respectively .
To derive a more precise estimation of the relationship
between CHD and these polymorphisms, we conducted a
meta-analysis between the three most frequently investi-
gated polymorphisms (XbaI, EcoRI, and SpIns/Del) of all
published studies from 1990 to 2013.
Materials and methods
Literature search
All studies that reported the association between the apoB
polymorphisms and CHD were identified by comprehen-
sive computer-based searches of PubMed, Web of Science,
Google Scholar, the Cochrane Library, Wanfang Data,
China Biological Medicine Database(SinoMed), and
China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI). These
computer searches were limited to English and Chinese
language articles before March 2014, but did not include
reviews and editorials. The following keywords were used
for searching: "apolipoprotein B" OR "apoB" AND "poly-
morphism" OR "mutation" OR "variant" OR "variation"
OR "genotype" AND "coronary heart disease" OR "CHD"
OR "coronary artery disease" OR "CAD" OR "myocardial
Infarction" OR "MI" OR "ischemic cardiovascular dis-
ease" OR "ischemic heart disease" OR "IHD".
Inclusion criteria
The diagnosis of CHD was fitted to the examination results
of coronary arteriography, clinical symptoms combined
with electrocardiogram, treadmill exercise test, echocardi-
ography, and myocardial perfusion imaging in emission
computed tomography. The inclusion criteria for identified
articles were as follows: (1) studies are limited to three
polymorphisms (XbaI, EcoRI, and SpIns/Del) of the apoB
gene and CHD; (2) independent case-control studies using
either a hospital-based or a population-based design; (3)
similar to the literature research methods; (4) the literature
has a comprehensive statistical index, sufficient data for
estimating an odds ratio (OR) with 95% confidence inter-
val (CI); (5) not republished data. Exclusion criteria were:
(1) studies in which it was not possible to extract data from
the published results; (2) studies that did not report appro-
priate outcomes were also excluded.
Data extraction
Two authors independently extracted data. Disagreement
was resolved by consensus. If these two authors could not
reach a consensus, the result was reviewed by a third
author. The extracted data were consisted of the follow
items: the first author's name, publication year, eligible
subjects, number of genotypes, allele frequency of case,
population, selection criteria, sex, and age of cases and
controls.
Quality assessment
To determine the methodological quality of each study, we
used the Newcastle­Ottawa scale, which uses a "star" rat-
ing system to judge the quality of observational studies.5
The NOS ranges between zero (worst) up to nine stars
(best). Studies with a score equal to or higher than seven
were considered to be of high quality. Two investigators
independently assessed the quality of included studies, and
the result was reviewed by a third investigator.
Disagreement was resolved by discussion.
Statistical analysis
The associations between XbaI, EcoRI, and SpIns/Del
polymorphisms of apoB gene and CHD were compared by
using the OR corresponding to 95% CI. Heterogeneity
between studies was assessed by I2 test, p < 0.10 and I2 >
50% indicated evidence of heterogeneity.6,7 If heterogene-
ity existed among the studies, the random effects model
was used to estimate the pooled OR (the DerSimonian and
Kacker method).8 Otherwise, the fixed effects model was
adopted (the Mantel­Haenszel method).9 For the apoB
gene polymorphisms, we investigated associations
between the genetic variant and CHD risk in a recessive
dominant genetic model and allelic contrast. Z test was
used to determine the pooled OR and significance was set
at p < 0.05. Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) for each
single nucleotide polymorphism was assessed for the con-
trols in each study using 2 test at a significant level of p <
0.05. The potential publication bias was investigated by
using funnel plots and Egger's test.10 The statistical analy-
sis was conducted by using Review Manager 5.20
(Cochrane Collaboration, The Nordic Cochrane Centre,
Copenhagen). In order to observe the association between
numerous polymorphic sites of apoB gene polymorphisms
and CHD risk in Chinese, studies of Chinese were consid-
ered in the meta-analysis independently.
Results
Study characteristics
All of the studies had been approved by the ethics commit-
tees of their affiliations. A total of 54 studies were included
Zhang et al. 829
in the final meta-analysis according to the inclusion crite-
ria,11­64 29 for EcoRI, 41 for XbaI, and 27 about SpIns/Del
polymorphisms. Table1 shows the studies identified and
their main characteristics. Figure 1 shows the study selec-
tion process. These eligible studies were from all over the
world. In all studies, the genotype frequencies in controls
were consistent with HWE. There were five studies that
did not follow the HWE.13,16,20,34,51 The NOS results indi-
cated that the methodological quality was generally good.
Meta-analysis
For the apoB EcoRI polymorphism, significant heteroge-
neity was found in the allelic model (I2 = 56%, p<0.0001)
and dominant genetic model (I2 = 68%, p<0.00001).
Therefore, the random-effects model (DerSimonian and
Kacker) was applied. No significant heterogeneity was
found under the recessive genetic model (I2 = 0, p = 0.95),
therefore, the Mantel­Haenszel fixed effects model was
used. Significant statistical association was observed
between the apoB EcoRI polymorphism and CHD under
the allelic contrast (A vs. G, p = 0.001, OR = 1.33, 95% CI
= 1.12­1.57) (Figure 2). Both the dominant genetic model
(AA+GA vs. GG, p = 0.005, OR = 1.22, 95% CI = 1.06­
1.40) and the recessive genetic model (AA vs. GA+GG, p
= 0.04, OR = 1.33, 95% CI = 1.01­1.74) were also obtained
similar results. For the apoB XbaI polymorphism, signifi-
cant heterogeneity was found under the allelic contrast (I2
= 69%, p < 0.00001), dominant genetic model (I2 = 55%, p
<0.0001) and the recessive genetic model (I2 = 68%,
p<0.00001). The random-effects model was applied to per-
form meta-analysis.
No significant statistical association was found under
the allelic contrast (T vs. C, P=0.51, OR = 0.96, 95% CI =
0.84­1.09) (Figure 3), dominant genetic model (TT+TC
vs. CC, p = 0.92, OR = 0.99, 95% CI = 0.80­1.23), and
recessive genetic model (TT vs. TC+CC, p = 0.86, OR =
1.02, 95% CI = 0.85­1.22). As to the apoB SpIns/Del pol-
ymorphism, significant heterogeneity was found under the
allelic contrast (I2 = 84%, p < 0.00001) and dominant
genetic model (I2 = 57%, p = 0.0002). Therefore, the ran-
dom-effects model was applied. No significant heteroge-
neity was found under the recessive genetic model (I2 =
40%, p = 0.02), we utilized the fixed effects model.
Significant statistical association was observed between
the apoB SpIns/Del polymorphism and CHD under the
allelic contrast (D vs. I, p = 0.01, OR = 1.20, 95% CI =
1.04­1.39) (Figure 4), dominant genetic model (DD+DI
vs. II, p = 0.004, OR = 1.20, 95% CI = 1.06­1.35), and the
recessive genetic model (DD vs. DI+II, p = 0.0002, OR =
1.25, 95% CI = 1.11­1.40). After restricting our analysis to
the subgroup of Chinese individuals, apoB XbaI polymor-
phism was significantly associated with CHD under the
allelic contrast (T vs. C, p = 0.0001, OR = 0.46, 95% CI =
0.31­0.68), dominant genetic model (TT+TC vs. CC, p =
0.0002, OR = 0.35, 95% CI = 0.20­0.61), and the recessive
genetic model (TT vs. TC+CC, p = 0.0007, OR = 0.48,
95% CI = 0.32­0.73). apoB EcoRI polymorphism and risk
of CHD were found under the allelic contrast (A vs. G, p =
0.0006, OR = 1.46, 95% CI = 1.18­1.82) and dominant
genetic model (AA+GA vs. GG, P = 0.002, OR = 1.38,
95% CI = 1.13­1.68). However, we did not find any asso-
ciation under the recessive genetic model (AAvs. GA+GG,
p = 0.14, OR = 1.88, 95% CI = 0.81­4.36). Furthermore,
no significant statistical association was observed between
the apoB SpIns/Del polymorphism and CHD under the
allelic contrast (D vs. I, p = 0.07, OR = 1.21, 95% CI =
0.98­1.50), dominant genetic model (DD+DI vs. CC, p =
0.09, OR = 1.24, 95% CI = 0.96­1.58) and the recessive
genetic model (DD vs. DI+II, p = 0.27, OR = 1.39, 95% CI
= 0.77­2.49).
When stratified by status of HWE (the presence or
absence of HWE in controls), no significant heterogeneity
was found under the allelic contrast, dominant genetic
model and recessive genetic model for EcoRI, XbaI, and
SpIns/Del polymorphisms. Significant statistical associa-
tion still existed in the whole group and subgroup of
Chinese population.
The contribution of each study to the pooled estimate
was performed in order to assess the sensitivity analyses.
We excluded individual studies one at a time and recalcu-
lated the pooled p or OR for the remaining studies. Huang
et al.'s study had an undue influence on the pooled p or OR
estimation in SpIns/Del polymorphism.65 This result
showed the reliability of our results. What is more, conver-
sion between the two models also did not substantially
change the pooled point estimate.
Publication bias
No obvious publication bias was found in the present
study. The publication bias of the individual studies was
evaluated using a funnel plot and Egger's test. No visual
publication bias was found in the funnel plot for the EcoRI
(Figure 5(a)), XbaI (Figure 5(b)), or SpIns/Del (Figure 5(c))
gene polymorphisms. We further used Egger's test to
assess the whole test publication bias. No statistically sig-
nificant difference was detected in the Egger's test by
using the allelic contrast model for EcoRI (T = 0.29, p =
0.775), XbaI (T = 1.09, p = 0.283), and SpIns/Del (T =
1.43, p = 0.165) polymorphisms in all studies. In the sub-
group no statistically significant difference was detected
by using the Egger's test.
Discussion
In the present study, we found an association of EcoRI poly-
morphism with an increased risk of CHD. No significant
association between apoB XbaI polymorphism and CHD
was observed in all studies. For SpIns/Del polymorphism,

an association was observed in all studies. However, no sig-
nificant statistical association was found in Chinese people.
CHD is a multi-factorial and polygenic disorder
which is thought to be the result of interactions between
complex factors of gene-gene and gene-environment.
The association between apoB gene polymorphisms and
the risk of CHD has been widely studied, but the results
remain inconclusive.11­64 For example, Baroni et al.
reported a significant difference in the development of
CHD between genotype classes of the XbaI polymor-
phism in an Italian population.13 Duman et al. did not
observe significant differences in the frequencies of
apoB XbaI (CC, CT, TT) and EcoRI (AA, AG, GG) gen-
otypes between case and control subjects in Turkish.20
Gallegos-Arreola et al. detected that the apoB XbaI (CC)
genotype is associated with CAD patients in the Mexican
population.21 Kallel et al. found a significant but not
independent association between the Ins/Del polymor-
phism of the apoB gene and MI in the Tunisian popula-
tion.31 Marshall et al. found no evidence that the apoB
Ins/Del polymorphism had a significant influence on the
risk of angiographically defined CAD.39 In contrast,
Hong et al. observed that the Ins allele frequency was
significantly higher in patients than in healthy controls
in a Korean case control study with 216 controls and 235
CAD patients.26
In order to generate robust data on apoB gene (EcoRI,
XbaI, and SpIns/Del) polymorphisms and CAD risk, we
carried out an update meta-analysis involving 54 studies
and focusing on worldwide studies to provide the most
comprehensive analysis on the relationship between apoB
gene polymorphisms and CAD risk. The effects of the
dominant model, the recessive genetic model, and allelic
contrast were estimated.
This meta-analysis revealed that EcoRI and SpIns/Del
polymorphisms of apoB gene significantly increased the
susceptibility for CHD. No significant statistical associa-
tion was observed under XbaI polymorphism. The results
were the same as those of a previous meta-analysis per-
formed by Chiodini et al. in 2003.2 Another meta-analysis
was performed by Boekholdt et al. in Caucasians.3 Subjects
homozygous for the rare EcoRI allele had significantly
decreased levels of total and LDL cholesterol, but unal-
tered risk of CHD. Homozygotes for the XbaI C allele had
significantly elevated levels of LDL cholesterol (LDL-C)
and apoB, but a decreased risk of CHD. Homozygosity for
the SpIns/Del D allele was associated with similarly
increased levels of LDL-C and apoB, and with an increased
risk of CHD. In our meta-analysis, in Chinese individuals,
the XbaI polymorphism decreased the risk of CHD. The
results were in line with a meta-analysis carried out by
Chen et al. in 2006.4 As to SpIns/Del polymorphism, no
significant statistical association was observed.
However, only full text articles published in English
and Chinese were included in this meta-analysis, miss-
ing some eligible studies which were unpublished or

reported in other languages. In this case, some inevitable
publication bias might exist, although the funnel plots
did not indicate obvious publication bias in the present
meta-analysis. It might influence the interpretation of
our final results.
For better interpreting the results, some limitations of
this meta-analysis should be acknowledged. First, hetero-
geneity may affect the results of the present meta-analysis
in our analysis. Second, subgroup analysis was not performed
by the factors such as gender, age and experimental method
because insufficient data could be extracted from the pri-
mary article. Further studies with large sample size, espe-
cially in subgroup analysis of different minority, were
needed to confirm our findings.
Despite these limitations or disadvantages, our meta-
analysis still had some advantages. First, a systematic
review of the association of apoB gene (EcoRI, XbaI,
and SpIns/Del) polymorphisms with CHD risk is
834 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
statistically more powerful than any single study.
Second, the studies retrieved were the latest; many of
them were published after the previous meta-analysis.
Third, the quality of case­control studies included in
our meta-analysis was satisfactory and met our inclu-
sion criteria.
Conclusions
In summary, the present meta-analysis points to an asso-
ciation of EcoRI polymorphism with an increased risk of
CHD. No significant association between apoB XbaI
polymorphism and CHD we observed in all studies, but it
is a reduced risk of CHD in Chinese people. For SpIns/
Del polymorphism, an association was observed in all
studies. However, no significant statistical association
was found under Chinese individuals. On the other hand,
Huang and Xie found that combined polymorphisms of
apoB and APOAI gene are related with CHD.28 Scartezini
et al. observed that individuals with the TT/GG genotype
presented a 6.1 higher chance of developing CHD than
individuals with the other XbaI/EcoRI genotypes in
Brazilian patients.52 We conclude that the TT/GG geno-
type may be in linkage disequilibrium with an unknown
variation in the apoB gene or with a variation in another
gene that affects the risk of CHD. Larger scale primary
studies with the consideration of gene­gene and gene­
environment interactions are still required to further eval-
uate the interaction of apoB gene polymorphisms with
CHD susceptibility.
