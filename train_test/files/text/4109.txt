Introduction
This study considers the process of increasing judicialization
of mental health care provided to young drug users. It aims to
analyze how compulsory hospitalization of the youth has
been used as a tool for public security and violence preven-
tion. We attempt to problematize discourses about protection
and care that have surrounded compulsory hospitalization by
evidencing its use as a control and punishment mechanism
that increases the social vulnerability of young drug users.
For such problematization, we have relied on theoretical
and methodological tools of social psychology from a post-
structuralist perspective, particularly related to Michel
Foucault's thought. We have considered the author's analysis
of discourses and the emergence of knowledges in articula-
tion with mechanisms and technologies of power. We discuss
the emergence of the "addicted youth" as a social problem
that has invited psychology and law to produce a range of
knowledges and strategies of intervention and management
of this population. This affects both the conduction of public
policies and the ways through which the juveniles are sup-
posed to see and relate with themselves and the others.
The research has been based on the analysis of lawsuits
involving juveniles who were consigned to psychiatric insti-
tutions for drug addiction treatment as a protection measure
in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. Through the
analysis of documents, we have attempted to identify the
relationships established between fields of knowledge and
mechanisms of power that contribute to the maintenance of
certain truths about the "addicted youth" which have sup-
ported the legitimization and updating of the compulsory
hospitalization strategy.
The analysis of the materials has evidenced discourses
that have circumscribed young drug users and constructed
this population as potentially dangerous subjects as well as a
population category at risk. In this sense, we point out how
compulsory hospitalization has emerged out of the lawsuits
as a tool for prevention of juvenile delinquency, as most of
the reasons for hospitalization are not linked to health issues,
but rather to the field of public security.
The Construction of the Addicted Youth
as a "New" Social Problem
Ten years ago, there was no case in the State. We estimate that
there are 50 to 60 thousand crack users nowadays.
This statement by the former Health Officer of the State of Rio
Grande do Sul1 is representative of the ways in which the rela-
tionship between youth and drug use has been presented as a

Preventing Juvenile Delinquency:
Compulsory Hospitalization as a Public
Security Tool
Carolina dos Reis1 and Neuza Maria de Fátima Guareschi1
Abstract
This article aims to problematize discourses about protection and care that have surrounded compulsory hospitalization by
evidencing its use as a control and punishment mechanism that increases the social vulnerability of young drug users. For
such, we analyze lawsuits involving juveniles who were consigned to psychiatric institutions for drug addiction treatment
as a protection measure in the state of Rio Grande do Sul, in Brazil. The analysis of the materials has evidenced discourses
that have circumscribed young drug users and constructed this population as potentially dangerous subjects as well as a
population category at risk. In this sense, we point out how compulsory hospitalization has emerged out of the lawsuits as a
tool for prevention of juvenile delinquency.

new problem to be faced by different social actors. Ten years
ago, crack was hardly found and sold in the State, and the
population was significantly smaller; however, the even rarer
mental health services intended to assist children and adoles-
cents were already overcrowded with users of lolo2 and other
narcotics. Hence, neither the existence of a large number of
drug users in the State, which has undoubtedly become even
larger, nor the need for health services to assist such popula-
tion can be seen as something new. Therefore, it is strange that
youth drug use has emerged as a huge problem affecting soci-
ety today and demanding action from the State government as
well as answers from some fields of knowledge.
Silva, Hartmann, Scisleski, and Pires (2008), aiming to
evidence changes in what has been defined as pathology in
children and adolescents, analyzed records of São Pedro
Psychiatric Hospital3 patients from its foundation in 1884 to
1937. They also performed a comparative analysis address-
ing the present situation and concluded that drug addiction is
now the main symptom found in hospitalization records, and
poverty and referral by the Judiciary are prevailing charac-
teristics of the hospitalization processes. Poverty and this
judicial policing device have remained constant over the
years and are still found in the hospitalization procedure,
thus evidencing that the relation between juridical and psy-
chiatric knowledges about childhood and youth has a long
tradition. Hospitalization has appeared as a mechanism to
guarantee the public order and ensure the organization and
hygienization of poverty: There are records of children and
adolescents hospitalized because of something known as
"behavior disorders," rather than for mental health.
It is not by chance, then, that the emergence of this new
problem is associated with the spread of the image of "drug
addicted youth" linked to violence caused by lack of emo-
tional control, drug abuse, or the need to obtain money or
other things that may be used to buy more narcotics.
Furthermore, this young population, marked by drug addic-
tion, has been described as socially vulnerable and character-
ized as either victims or protagonists of such social problem.
In addition, drug-related criminality became one of the most
discussed topics on the last decade, comprehending both pre-
ventive and repressive actions, as well as costs and benefits
implied in social protection.
Freitas (2009) has pointed out that increased juvenile vio-
lence and drug use often make us seek for their foundational
cause. The effect of this is that experts and productions by
fields of knowledge such as psychology, psychiatry, psy-
chopedagogy, social service, and law, among others, by pro-
viding explanations, contribute to the very construction of the
problem they attempt to elucidate. This perspective of knowl-
edge production is based on the belief that there is a nature to
be cured and recovered in those young individuals.
In an attempt to rehabilitate the subject regarded as devi-
ant, psychology and law have ended up contributing to the
construction of a way of being a drug user subject who is
marked by an alleged "drug addicted/dependent/vicious/
violent" identity. This is how young drug users have been
characterized as a big social problem, and these are the strat-
egies designed to solve it. As we stated before, although vio-
lence and youth drug use are nothing new, this problem now
emerges as a novelty. Therefore, innovation is not in this
issue itself, but rather in the relationships established with it.
We emphasize that, even though the meanings attributed to
"drug addicted youth" are historically marked, some fields of
knowledge that have corroborated the construction of such
meanings try to delete historicity by attributing an essential-
ist character to their statements as discoveries of a nature that
has been the basis of a social and individual problem rather
than a discourse that constructs the drug user subject (Reis,
Guareschi, & Carvalho, 2014).
Method
Research Context
To discuss such issues, we considered a research that ana-
lyzed lawsuits filed in different cities in Rio Grande do Sul
against juveniles who were consigned to psychiatric institu-
tions for drug addiction treatment as a protection measure.
Instruments
Fourteen lawsuits involving 12- to 18-year-old female and
male subjects were analyzed from March to July 2011 in two
big cities in Rio Grande do Sul, Brazil, which have special-
ized courts focused on the protection of children and adoles-
cents' rights; hence, cases addressing this specific issue
would be more easily found. The cities were chosen due to
the fact that they have special courts for lawsuits related to
the protection of children and adolescents' rights, which
facilitated the search for court cases that address this specific
issue. The criterion used to establish the amount of lawsuits
to be analyzed was data saturation (Bauer, 2002). This crite-
rion emerged during the analysis of the lawsuits and has been
regarded as an important analyzer on its own merit. Through
the documents--written by professionals from health, social
care, and education services--that compose the lawsuits, the
lives of those young drug users have been translated into a
technical language, which is characterized by writing stan-
dardization and repeated use of some explanatory models.
Moreover, certain selectivity marks the episodes of the
youths' lives in the documents, which both highlight actions
regarded as drawbacks in their behavior and justify the need
for other hospitalizations. As the cases under review were
not bringing any new data to the research process, this situa-
tion was taken as data saturation.
Procedures
The analysis was conducted by the authors as part of a mas-
ter's research in social and institutional psychology. The
dos Reis and Guareschi 3
lawsuits were consulted at Youth Courts in both cities. We
selected lawsuits involving juveniles in the age group previ-
ously mentioned who had compulsory hospitalization deter-
mined and no formal record of misdemeanor. We attempted
to focus on practices used in the name of care. Therefore, we
tried to distantiate from those directly linked to punitive
practices of the social-educational system. The documents
were randomly selected from lawsuits with the described
characteristics that were available in the Courts during the
period under consideration.
The documents were examined and manually copied at
the Courts, as neither the removal nor the reproduction of the
materials was authorized. The excerpts from lawsuits pre-
sented in this study were modified to avoid their identifica-
tion, preserve the subjects and their family's anonymity, and
respect judicial secrecy. Likewise, the professionals'identity,
and specificities of both the institutions involved and the cit-
ies in which the materials were collected have also been pro-
tected. This research was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee.
Analysis of Materials
The analysis was conducted from a Foucauldian perspective,
inspired by the analysis of discourse and the emergence of
knowledge in its articulation with power mechanisms and
technologies. We tried to identify relationships between
fields of knowledge and mechanisms of power that affect the
maintenance of certain truths about the so-called "drug
addicted youth" that have supported the legitimization and
updating of the compulsory hospitalization strategy.
Particularly, we attempted to highlight the articulations
established between the fields of health and justice that have
provided the compulsory hospitalization practice with both
foundation and acceptability.
To do that, we analyzed all the documents4 that compose
the lawsuits by considering the following questions: how and
when did the drug use by adolescents start to be described as
a social problem? Which professionals, fields of knowledge,
and institutions have been called to speak about, guide, and
solve the drug use problem? Which strategies, procedures,
and techniques have been created to solve the so-called prob-
lem? How is it related to Brazilian political, economic, and
cultural issues?
By looking more carefully at the contents of the lawsuits
and the documents that compose them, we noticed the exis-
tence of a strategic relationship among the juridical, psychi-
atric, and pedagogical fields which contributes to the
formation of a "protection network"5 around different aspects
of juveniles' lives. In this sense, by examining the docu-
ments, we sought to problematize this provision of protec-
tion and care by considering the contradictions that pervade
the maintenance of discourses about protection in the
research materials. This led us to ask additional questions
such as "What do these lawsuits make us say about those
juveniles?" and "What kinds of practices do they mobilize
around such population?"
Presentation and Analysis of Results
The presentation of research findings includes a detailed
description of the lawsuit structure and its contents, as well
as excerpts of the lawsuits. We understand that the very
structure of the lawsuit produces a certain way of talking
about those youths and their families that highlights their dif-
ficulties and problems and exclude the healthy and positive
relations they have established along their lives.
The Admission
The lawsuits under consideration, in general, are filed by
either the Department of Public Defense or the Public
Prosecutor's Office--Childhood and Youth Division. In the
first case, the adolescent's family voluntarily requests assis-
tance from the justice system along the hospitalization pro-
cess.The family regards this as necessary when the adolescent
refuses treatment or there is shortage of beds in mental hos-
pitals and the family cannot find an adequate place for treat-
ment in the city health network.
The admission to hospital occurs through the Department
of Public Defense6 if the family is unable to afford the cost of
a lawyer; in this case, the family has to prove its eligibility by
presenting a determination of indigence or an unemployment
certification. The Public Prosecutor's Office, in turn, as the
agency in charge of protecting children and adolescents, can
also request public defense services. In general, the Child
Protection Council or other services belonging to the health
and social assistance network refer cases of violation of
rights to the Public Prosecutor's Office. Besides that,
although the lawsuit is filed by the Department of Public
Defense, the intervention by the Public Prosecutor's Office is
also required to ensure the lawsuit validity. Thus, the pro-
cesses are initiated by the statement of financial failure of the
family and their admitted inability to take care of the
adolescent.
The Lawsuits
Pleadings
A lawsuit consists of different procedures and stages. First,
the Department of Public Defense or the Public Prosecutor's
Office writes a document, which is composed of three parts
comprehending
a. Description of the basic facts of the case: it is the
construction of the case, or maybe a characterization
of the situations presented as a case. It is a summary
of certain points of the narrative of the adolescent's
and his or her family's lives in what makes them the
4 SAGE Open
object of Justice and State action. Reports of viola-
tion of rights in the subject's lives are highlighted.
Therefore, when we wonder what those lawsuits say
about the juveniles, it is possible to point out vio-
lence, neglect, abandonment, aggression, absence,
failures, abuses, and misdemeanors that would jus-
tify the insertion of that family in the Justice System
and even their insertion in multiple State protection
institutions, which comprehend social assistance,
health, and education, among others. In general, this
first part of the lawsuit contains literal excerpts taken
from appraisals and reports written by physicians,
psychologists, advisors, and social assistants. These
excerpts, which are displaced from their original
contexts, stress how indispensable and urgent the
intervention of the Judiciary in that subject and fam-
ily is.
The juvenile is drug addicted and uses crack, which potentializes
his aggressive behavior. Besides that, he steals objects to sell
and obtain drugs. He is totally out of control, thus risking his
life and his relatives. The family life is unbearable. His
guardian has to stay permanently at home to prevent him from
selling her belongings. According to her, the juvenile becomes
aggressive when he does not have money to buy drugs. While
under the effect of the substance, he becomes extremely violent
and aggressive to his family, both verbally and physically. The
juvenile does not accept to undergo voluntary treatment, and
says he is not a drug user. Although he does not acknowledge his
state of hopelessness and extreme necessity, in an extreme lack
of control, his life as well as his relatives are at risk. His
hospitalization is indispensable and, after detoxification, he
must be referred to a drug rehabilitation centre. (Excerpt from
pleadings written by the prosecutor)
The picture shows violence, aggression, and lack of con-
trol, a desperate family that does not know what to do and
ask for the State assistance. There is a warning of early mis-
demeanors, such as stealing family belongings. The word
already often appears in the lawsuits to warn of the develop-
ment of harmful behaviors from a premonitory perspective.
It is noteworthy that the adolescents are subjects in development;
that is why removing them from the environment in which they
are becomes imperative e urgent. (Excerpt from Pleadings
written by the prosecutor)
The mother was visibly under the influence of psychoactive
substances when she was admitted to hospital, and she has been
involved in prostitution and drug abuse since she was 8 years
old. She had already been hospitalized and should have gone to
a therapeutical community where her son could stay with her,
but she fled to avoid losing her boyfriend. As a teenager, she
had been using drugs and wandering on the street. She was
referred to shelter and medical treatment for drug addiction. Her
younger brother, who is under the tutelage of their oldest brother,
has already shown behavior problems. (Report addressing the
custody of the baby of a young drug user--signed by a
psychologist, a social worker, and the coordinator of the service)
It has been three years since the teenagers quit school. They
have refused health care. Their mother exerts no control over her
children. One of them has already committed offenses against
property. They remain on the streets and occasionally return
home to eat and sleep. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the
prosecutor)
The notion of risk is constructed not only in relation to the
juvenile's life; this risk, which can still be limited to the fam-
ily, may be potentially spread to the public sphere.
The teenagers were in the shelter due to parental neglect. Since
2007, they had been living on the street, begging and
compulsively using crack. At home, they were attacked by
their mother, who was also a drug addict. They were
hospitalized and returned to the streets, and the outpatient
treatment was discontinued. The institutional attempts to
reinsert the adolescents in their family as a measure of
protection have been unsuccessful due their addiction, which
causes them to return to the streets. The therapeutical plan has
indicated the necessity of detoxification treatment in a
Therapeutical Community for a period of at least six months
and return to their grandparents' house. Both girls have already
undergone outpatient treatment, which has proved to be
insufficient. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the prosecutor)
The second case evidences a story of family failure, and
the home environment appears as an unbearable space that
causes the adolescents to go to the streets and use drugs. The
family is shown as a driving element leading those juveniles
to drug abuse. However, the family is not the focus of the
intervention; in this story, it appears as a symptom, rather
than a cause.
As Donzelot (1986) pointed out, interventions in those
families have become a real fight between services and users.
There is always the assumption that the family is trying to
fool the professionals and they are always willing to show
that they are not naive.
The mother spoke the truth under pressure. She must be
mentally impaired due to long-term drug abuse. (Statement
taken by the social worker at the Justice System)
The adolescent gave birth to a boy. She arrived visibly altered
and was aggressive, in poor hygienic conditions, without
identification documents, and refused to give information. She
arrived with another woman, who claimed that she only knew
that the girl was a crack user; she was responsible for the
adolescent's hospitalization. The woman said that the girl had
medical care during pregnancy but had no proof of it. The
adolescent said that the woman was her sister and would take
care of the child; contradictorily, the woman said she was just
a friend. The child was born with congenital syphilis. (Report
provided by the hospital in which a young drug user gave birth
to her child--signed by the psychologist and the social worker)
dos Reis and Guareschi 5
The doctor said that the boy wanted to be admitted to the
Psychiatric Clinic just because it has a swimming pool. He
suggested that the boy should go to a shelter, saying it was not a
case for admission. (Report from the Social Assistance Service,
denouncing the attitude of a doctor who refused to hospitalize an
adolescent--signed by a psychologist, a social educator and the
coordinator of the Service)
b. Presentation of rights: it points out the rights that
have been violated and need to be guaranteed. In this
part, the right to health and some excerpts from both
the Federal Constitution of Brazil and the Child and
Adolescent Statute are presented to give legal sup-
port to the intervention.
Federal Constitution of Brazil--1988
Art. 227. It behooves the family, the society and the State to
guarantee children, adolescents and youth, with total priority,
the right to life, health, food, education, leisure, work, culture,
dignity, freedom and family and community life, besides
protecting them from all kinds of neglect, discrimination,
exploitation, violence, cruelty and oppression. (Brasil.
Presidência da República. Casa Civil, 1988). (Excerpt from
pleadings written by the prosecutor)
Child and Adolescent Statute--1990
Art. 7 Children and adolescents have the right to protection, life
and health by means of effectuation of public social policies
that allow birth and development with health and harmony,
with dignified living conditions. (Brasil. Presidência da
República, 1990). (Excerpt from pleadings written by the
prosecutor)
On one hand, Article 227 of the Federal Constitution is
used to justify the right to health by means of compulsory
hospitalization; on the other hand, this kind of health protec-
tion puts other rights at risk, such as the right to freedom and
family and community living. This implies that, among those
rights, there is a "greater good," which is to keep biological
health, despite the forms of discrimination, violence, cruelty,
and oppression that the compulsory hospitalization may gen-
erate. If the guarantee of constitutional rights were the only
issue at stake, we should be discussing programs of compul-
sory housing, compulsory employment, compulsory nour-
ishment, compulsory culture, and compulsory leisure, as
mentioned by Dartiu Xavier (2011).7 Health is a right, but
compulsory hospitalization is not; rather, it is a duty for those
juveniles.
c. Presentation of requests: it states the objective of the
lawsuit. The Judiciary is required to authorize
compulsory hospitalization by means of law enforcement, if
necessary. Afterwards, referral to a drug rehabilitation centre
for a six-month stay, at least, with law enforcement, if
necessary. The patient should stay under medical custody until
his rehabilitation. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the
prosecutor)
request for search and seizure to preserve the adolescent's
physical and psychological integrity and assess his mental
condition. If the need exists, hospitalization for substance abuse
treatment should be immediately determined. The officer may
require assistance from the juvenile's mother or enforce the
law. (Excerpt from pleadings written by the prosecutor)
We should highlight that the possibility of using law
enforcement is mentioned in the presentation of requests.
This characterizes the adolescent as a potentially dangerous
subject, but it is also evidence of authoritative restriction of
freedom exerted on those subjects. Somehow, the adoles-
cents are expected to react to the compulsory hospitalization,
but the meaning attributed to this reaction implies the impos-
sibility of objection beforehand. Such backlash just reaffirms
their loss of control over drug use and non-acknowledgment
of the need for treatment, thus preventing them from adher-
ing to forms of care other than the compulsory hospitaliza-
tion, besides emphasizing the characterization of their
behavior as aggressive.
The production of those texts has been supported by psy
experts and other social workers who together potentialize
the moralizing effect of knowledges and institutions. By
mentioning moralization, we draw attention to the non-
neutrality of science productions and their ethical and politi-
cal articulations with other social factors that have given
more importance to some discourses rather than others.
Ultimately, psy and social sciences provide the basis to sup-
port views of those subjects and their families as the ones
who pose risk, and the Judiciary acts in accordance with this
support. Hence, it is possible to understand that juvenile hos-
pitalization is not performed by the Judiciary only; rather,
there is a network of actors, and the more this network is
articulated, the more legitimate it becomes.
Certifications of Veridicality
Appraisals by Experts
Following the analysis of lawsuits, we examined a range of
documents that seek to evidence the alleged truth about the
juveniles and their families' reality. In these documents,
there is an attempt to certify the need for judicial intervention
to fulfill the requirements presented in the pleadings. There
are reports, appraisals, evaluations, and social studies carried
out by the experts who were in contact with the families,
mostly through public services. These materials have pointed
out the failure of extra-judicially provided care. The materi-
als include the following:
1. Monthly and biweekly reports of approach to the
homeless,
6 SAGE Open
 2. Documents issued by the Child Protection Council,
 3. Statements by Councils for the Defense of the Rights
of Children and Adolescents, pointing out the need
for hospitalization and State intervention in the ado-
lescent's family,
 4. Records of meetings held in the Public Prosecutor's
Office with several services of the protection
network,
 5. Testimonies by professionals from the health, social
assistance and public security network in the Public
Prosecutor's Office,
 6. Monthly follow-up records from shelters,
 7. Enrollment certification,
 8. School Reports,
 9. School attendance notification,
10. Appraisals by psychiatric clinics,
11. Expert appraisals of psychiatric hospitals and clinics
in which hospitalizations occur,
12. Communications of Involuntary Hospitalization in
Psychiatric Clinics and Hospitals,
13. Medical appraisals of emergency care services point-
ing out the need for hospitalization,
14. Psychiatric appraisals,
15. Psychological appraisals,
16. Social assessment,
17. Psychosocial study carried out by teams from the
shelters and the Judiciary,
18. Inter-professional report by the team from the
Juvenile Court,
19. Reports by Health and Social Assistance Offices,
20. Reports by Centers for Children Psychosocial
Attention,
21. Letters by Health and Social Assistance Officers and
Coordinators,
22. Notifiable Diseases Information System,
23. National Form for adoption of children of young
drug users,
24. Letters from hospitals and clinics informing family
abandonment,
25. Institutional records of shelter stay due to family
abandonment in psychiatric clinics and hospitals, and
26. Shelter statement of school dropout and return to the
streets.
Police Reports and Requests for Information
We also found requests to the Public Security Office of Rio
Grande do Sul for information about the juveniles. The
requests may include the following information:
a. Abandonment of disabled people,
b. Lack of child support,
c. Abortion,
d. Threat,
e. Indecent assault/Lewd act,
f. Shelter dropout (several),
g. Body injury, and
h. Report by Special Police Stations for Children and
Adolescents due to small thefts.
There are also requests for information directed to the
Justice Court, including the following:
i. Body injury (offense),
j. Protection actions (sheltering, inclusion in programs
of support, treatment, and guidance), and
k. Withdraw from parental control.
We were faced with records of violation of rights suffered
and committed by juveniles in their inclusion in health, jus-
tice, public security, and social assistance network for the
sake of protection, care, and safeguard of children's and ado-
lescents' rights. On one hand, these documents do not reveal
new information about the clinical reasons for hospitaliza-
tion; on the other hand, they reinforce the image of those
adolescents as both victims and perpetrators of violent acts.
Hearings
We also found reports of hearings with families, juveniles, or
professionals from the health and social assistance network.
The service network includes Councils for the Defense of the
Rights of Children and Adolescents; Committees to Combat
Child Labor; City Halls; Departments of Social Assistance
and Education; Health Services, such as Centers for Children
Psychosocial Attention, Psychiatric Clinics, and Hospitals;
SocialAssistance Offices;Approach and Sheltering Services;
Child Protection Councils; Special Police Stations for
Children and Adolescents; Department of Investigation of
Drug Trafficking; Tourism, Industry, and Trade Offices
(which are called when storekeepers complain of disturbance
or in situations related to child labor exploitation).
The presence of the families and juveniles in the hearings
should be highlighted, as the role they are supposed to play is
very limited. The family, as Donzelot (1986) would stress,
attends the hearings because it is required to do so, but cer-
tainly not to perform any role; after all, it is supposedly because
of the family that the juvenile is found in that situation. The
family authority has already been neutralized by the presence
of the judge, and psy experts and other social technicians are
expected to provide explanations; thus, the family is given the
place of deference, supplication, confession, or waiver.
Some reports of family hearings are closed with the fol-
lowing sentence: "They are aware of what may happen." An
unwary reader might wonder what may happen. For sure, the
court records are not supposed to be read by unsuspected
subjects, but rather by those who are aware of what may hap-
pen to families that do not subject themselves to legal and
social norms expressed in that hearing device.
The adolescent subject to be protected, however, is treated as
a "defendant" or "accused" in the hearings. For the juveniles,
dos Reis and Guareschi 7
the hearing provides an opportunity to test their character: They
should accept everything that is said about them in the way it is
stated; otherwise, they will be seen as unable to recognize their
acts as wrong. Anyway, they will be objects of actions regarded
as applicable by the protection network; in other words, they
will be "aware of what may happen."
Judge's Decision
It is necessary to mention the judicial decision, which is sup-
posedly the most anticipated moment of this whole process.
We can say supposedly because the lawsuits addressed in this
research are expected to be judicially judged as either requir-
ing protective action through compulsory hospitalization for
drug addiction treatment, or not. However, along the lawsuit,
the juveniles usually end up being admitted to and discharged
from several psychiatric institutions for drug addiction treat-
ment through other paths, such as involuntary hospitalization
(triggered by either the juveniles' families or some health or
social assistance service--in these cases, the juveniles are
hospitalized even against their will when they are regarded
as an imminent risk to their own lives or their families); the
juveniles are convinced by such services or their relatives to
spontaneously go to psychiatric emergency services, and
then they are referred to hospital; or, as it often occurs, they
are taken to the psychiatric institutions by the police.
Despite the hospitalization, the juveniles usually return to
drug use, and the Public Prosecutor's Office, the Department
of Public Defense, or other professionals assisting them under-
stand that the lawsuit must not be closed, as other hospitaliza-
tions may be required. In this sense, when the sentence is
issued, it ends up being added to previous hospitalizations; in
rare occasions when hospitalization requests are denied, this
will be just one less hospitalization in a series, as this proce-
dure may be performed through other paths.
Search and Seizure Warrant or
Coercive Conduction for Treatment
Finally, concerning the documents in common with most of
the lawsuits, there is the search and seizure warrant, with
conduction to medical assessment and, if recommended by a
physician, further referral to psychiatric hospitalization in a
specialized clinic or hospital.
Compulsory hospitalization is applied in cases of addiction to
narcotics or intoxicants when treatment is necessary or when
it is convenient to the public order. Measure of caution
required while the symptoms last; medical assessment; urgent
coercive conduction warrant supported by law enforcement;
the medical appraisal must be presented to the judge. (Excerpt
taken from a search and seizure warrant written by the judge)
Considering a "coercively" guaranteed right, we could
think of the possibility of defense of those subjects by means
of Habeas Corpus to ensure the compulsory condition of
another right such as freedom. The acknowledgment of hos-
pitalization as an actual punitive practice and a freedom
restricting action would ironically provide those juveniles
with more possibilities of defense. Thus, we consider that
this may mean the suspension of those juveniles' rights for
the sake of their protection.
Bailiff Report
After the search and seizure warrant, a bailiff writes a report
informing the judge about the result of his or her action. In
several reports, it becomes apparent that the lawsuits are
detached from the juvenile's realities, even in terms of time.
These situations show contradictions between the reports
composing the lawsuits and the situation found by the bailiff
when presenting the hospitalization warrant.
On the date of warrant presentation, the boy was in another city
visiting his mother. (Excerpt from a bailiff report)
I certify that the adolescent was not on the street as it was
previously informed, but living with his father, attending school,
working as an apprentice at his father's business and did not
require hospitalization. (Excerpt from a bailiff report)
He was peacefully led to hospital. (Excerpt from a bailiff report)
While I was searching for him on the streets, his brother told me
that the juvenile had already been taken to the hospital by law
enforcement officers. (Excerpt from a bailiff report)
At the time of the warrant presentation at the shelter, the
teenager had already been admitted to the Psychiatric
Hospital. (Excerpt from a bailiff report)
It is interesting to highlight that in several lawsuits this
cycle of documents is often repeated, thus resulting in sev-
eral Search and Seizure Warrants and, consequently, several
psychiatric hospitalizations, although none of them seems to
be able to bring the lawsuits to an end. In the most severe
case, the adolescent was hospitalized 15 times in a 15-month
period and she was kept secluded for 21 to 30 days each time.
This means that she stayed in hospital for practically 1 year
and 3 months. Due to that, she missed 2 school years and did
not want to go back to school anymore. This is strong evi-
dence that drug use is not the object of intervention; rather, it
is just an excuse to keep the teenagers regarded as an incon-
venience to the public order away from the streets.
Discussion of Results
The Safeguard of Good Development and
Prevention to Violence
The analysis of the lawsuits has enabled us to see that state
interventions in those juveniles'lives take actions considered
as aggressive, violent, or possible harbingers of acts of
8 SAGE Open
delinquency as a focus of concern. At no time are clinical
reasons for health care taken into consideration in the docu-
ments; rather, they address problems related to housing con-
ditions, economic situation, school problems, and so on. The
logic underlying the promotion of biopolitical strategies such
as compulsory hospitalization is the risk and violence pre-
vention. According to Lemos, Nascimento, and Scheinvar
(2010), the concept of risk is a reference that underpins gov-
ernmental public policies of conducts. The notion of risk,
understood as a predictable and quantitative object, allows
the construction of statistical measurements that end up
shaping risk as a preventable fact. Debates about risk associ-
ated with a generalized feeling of insecurity that has guided
ways of life in the contemporary society have increased the
demand for security mechanisms.
Scientific knowledges, particularly those of medical and
psychological sciences, would contribute to the identifica-
tion of risk elements. The notion of risk groups is an effect of
that, as the identification of certain subjects in the population
mass has favored interventions with characteristics of social
control and moral slant. Therefore, such control strategies act
not only on individual bodies but also on population groups
acknowledged as risk groups. This leads to the sophistication
of techniques in the field of crime control (Azambuja, Reis,
Guareschi, & Hüning, 2013).
Young (2002) has analyzed this displacement from crimi-
nality and drug use control in a distinct subject, with distinct
causality, to the construction of tools to control the whole
population. For the author, such tools involve the production
of strategic measurements and estimates that assess the fac-
tors causing increased drug use and criminality, the priorities
of governmental intervention, the different effects and mean-
ings that penalties will have to each population group, the
population displacements generated by a given intervention,
and crime rates, among others.
Garland (2008) has stated that today the agents that con-
trol crime have to speak the economical language of cost/
benefit. According to Garland, the costs of crime are usually
estimated, and so are the costs of crime prevention, law
enforcement, and prison regimes. This way of thinking has
effects on the criminological field regarding the very way
that the system views crime and criminals, by "fostering a
conception of social harm which is based mainly on cost, and
a conception of criminal that emphasizes rational choice and
calculation" (p. 397), therefore, these conceptions can be
predicted and estimated. The managerial approach to crime
focuses on prevention rather than punishment, and on risk
minimization rather than on justice safeguard.
Young (2002) has also emphasized that the blooming of
increasingly sophisticated technologies for actuarial popula-
tion management has broadened the comprehensiveness of
social control actions. Within the prevention logic, such
actions do not focus on risk populations; rather, they concen-
trate on the population as a whole. They operate as a "gentle
machine" of social control spread all over the institutions,
particularly in work places, by establishing the distribution
of rewards together with thousands of small punitive dam-
ages. If credit is a central aspect of contemporary ways of
life, the promotion of economic insecurity makes the sub-
jects modify their behaviors to be able to keep themselves in
the labor market and have access to a better financial situa-
tion. "The demonization of others, the creation of folk devils
and moral panics is thus an ever-present possibility" (Young,
2002, p. 279, emphasis in original) that contributes to
broaden the subjection to those control strategies: to differ-
entiate themselves from subjects seen as regarded as delin-
quent, dangerous, deviant, the others bend to the market
dynamics. Here, we can see political, economic, and social
articulations with the identification of young drug users as a
risk population.
All those control tools--those affecting individual sub-
jects, those directed to risk groups, and those that act on the
whole population--are not exclusive; on the contrary, they
coexist and potentialize one another. It is necessary to con-
sider that crime control estimates are not limited to money
expenditure; they also involve moral economy and political
values. The war on drugs, for instance, would be contrary to
that logic, as it is excessively costly and its effectiveness is
disputable. However, another factor is included in the esti-
mates: the construction of the image of danger around the
subjects that use drugs. For Garland (2008),
The process of switching between these [allegedly] contradictory
rationalities [the one that primarily takes into consideration the
costs, and the one that does not tolerate criminality], of moving
from one discursive register to another, is very much a political
process. It is governed not by any criminological logic, but
instead by the conflicting interests of political actors and by the
exigencies, political calculations and short-term interests that
provide their motivations. In its detailed configuration, with all
its incoherence and contradictions, the field is thus a product of
the decidedly aleatory history of political maneuvers and
calculations. (p. 400)
In this sense, although psychological, psychiatric, and
juridical sciences have emerged as knowledge carriers that
speak in the name of youth protection, it is through this
knowledge that it is possible to precociously recognize juve-
niles as carriers of certain levels of dangerousness. If the
State and Law Operators mobilize interventions in this popu-
lation, psychology and other social workers will provide the
risk rates on which they should act. Furthermore, it is on the
risk factors pointed by knowledge produced by psychologi-
cal sciences that the prevention strategies proliferating in the
social field will operate. This occurs because the categories
constructed from the risk perspective are related to subjects
regarded as deviants due to their non-normative ways of liv-
ing, inhabiting, and using their sexuality. From this perspec-
tive, danger equals everything that is contrary to the norm.
Health, social assistance, and justice services, for example,
operate as risk managers, as prevention is the basis for
dos Reis and Guareschi 9
triggering biopolitical strategies to govern the population. In
this sense, preventing is to pinpoint risks, and risk analysis is
then performed in the name of life protection (Lemos etal.,
2010).
Childhood and youth have become a priority in govern-
mental policies. Investing in poor childhood means to mini-
mize risks. Thus, it is necessary to surveil families for them
to produce healthy, politically docile children (Donzelot,
1986). Concerning the discourses that have circumscribed
the families, we can see that family life has been included in
the risk order.
Every child and family action regarded as deficient in relation to
common social norms will be labeled as a risk factor by experts
from different fields of knowledge that act on childhood. (Lemos
etal., 2010, p. 99)
If, for the scientific knowledge, parents are the focus of
the problem, as families cannot conveniently undertake edu-
cative tasks and thus progressively condition their children
to perversity, the solution provided by science is to remove
the juveniles from their families as soon as possible. The idea
that childhood is a period of development legitimizes the
urgency of interventions and their preventive character.
It could be stressed that this discourse about the prognosis
of criminality has legitimized the need for intervention by
the State and experts when children or adolescents are still
developing, as it would be at this stage that the bases of
delinquency would supposedly be shaped. It would behoove
the experts to diagnose the existence of a pre-delinquency
condition in such juveniles by means of a criterious examina-
tion (Ferla, 2009).
Reishoffer and de Bicalho (2009) have pointed out that
the presence of this "nature" in juveniles justifies the adop-
tion of extreme actions of social control and repression of
subjects regarded as members of a "dangerous class." By fol-
lowing the biographies constructed by psy experts and other
social technicians, it is possible to visualize that they are
organized in a way to evidence how pathological behaviors
manifest themselves in those subjects and the reasons why
the juveniles should be repeatedly hospitalized and kept
recluse as long as possible (Goffman, 1974).
Vera Malaguti Batista (2003), in her book Difíceis Ganhos
Fáceis, stated that, although social technicians entered the
Justice System to humanize it, their appraisals have moralis-
tic, segregating, and racist contents. For the author, techni-
cism disguises violence caused by the institutional
mechanism. The notions of family, work, and housing seen
through the lenses of danger would position poverty and
social exclusion as the antithesis of family organization.
In accordance with this logic of juvenile pathologization
and criminalization, we can see the early articulation of
social protection actions which aim at controlling the indi-
vidual's behavior. For the sake of life and its ascension to the
highest potency, a set of mechanisms of prevention is
enlarged. However, never so many have been killed or left to
die in the name of life. At the same time that we see invest-
ments in juveniles, the final effect seems to be mostly
directed to an effective deprotection and aggravation of liv-
ing conditions, thus causing the juveniles to become involved
with misdemeanors, homelessness, school dropout, and later
with unemployment and even death (Reis & Guareschi,
2013).
Conclusion
By examining the lawsuits, it is possible to notice that
repeated psychiatric hospitalizations are the primary
responses to school dropout, homelessness, and drug use.
Both the lack of other actions by the public power and the
sequence of hospitalizations end up aggravating the juve-
niles' situation, as they drop out of the school, keep away
from their families, and no longer accept to be approached by
social assistance workers. The admission to and discharge
from hospitals and clinics create an endless cycle of lawsuits.
For a number of juveniles, the consequences are the aggrava-
tion of their life conditions and homelessness. All the law-
suits analyzed ended when the juveniles came of age, without
evidencing any significant change either in the youth drug
addiction or in their homeless situation. Some of them, after
coming of age, when they are no longer the object of lawsuits
issued in the name of protection and care, become objects of
penal actions in the name of social reinsertion. Others meet
an early death due to the situations to which they were
exposed and still others wander aimlessly through life or
develop their own different strategies to survive, despite the
conditions they are provided by both this society and the
State.
