OBJECTIVE -- To study whether obese individuals, who are at higher risk for diabetes and
disparities in care than nonobese individuals, are more likely to have undiagnosed diabetes.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We performed an analysis of 5,514 adult
participants in the 1999­2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Particpants
were interviewed about sociodemographic and medical data, including whether they had been
diagnosed with diabetes, and were examined for height, weight, and fasting plasma glucose level
126 mg/dl or by previous physician diagnosis. After categorizing participants into normal
weight, overweight, and obese according to BMI, the prevalance and diagnosis of diabetes across
BMI categories was compared using 2.
RESULTS -- Of the 9.8% (weighted sample) of participants who had diabetes, based on
fasting glucose levels and self-reported diagnosis, 28.1% were undiagnosed, translating to an
estimated 5.2 million people in the U.S. population. The proportion undiagnosed was not
significantly different among normal-weight (22.2%), overweight (32.5%), or obese adults
(27.4%). Nevertheless, obese adults comprise more than half of the undiagnosed diabetes cases
(2.7 million). Relative to normal-weight adults, the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for having undi-
agnosed diabetes was 1.50 (0.73­3.08) in overweight and 1.37 (0.72­2.63) in obese adults.
CONCLUSIONS -- Despite a higher underlying risk of diabetes and widespread clinical
recognition of this higher risk, obesity does not increase the likelihood that an individual's
diabetes will be diagnosed.

The rise in obesity has led to a com-
parable rise in type 2 diabetes, a ma-
jor cause of death, morbidity, and
disability (1,2). National guidelines dif-
fer, however, on whether screening
asymptomatic individuals is recom-
mended (3,4). The American Diabetes As-
sociation advocates screening adults aged
45 years and older, whereas the U.S. Pre-
ventive Services Task Force found insuf-
ficient evidence to recommend mass
screening (3,4). Lack of uniform screen-
ing guidelines and potential delays in di-
agnosing diabetes is of particular concern
in obese populations, not only because of
their high risk for developing diabetes but
also because evidence suggests that obese
individuals experience healthcare dispar-
ities that include delays in receiving pre-
ventive care (5). We examined whether
BMI category affects the likelihood of hav-
ing undiagnosed diabetes among U.S.
adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS --We used data from the
1999­2004 National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Survey (6). Participants
were interviewed about sociodemo-
graphic and medical data, including
whether a doctor had diagnosed them
with diabetes, age at diagnosis, and
whether they were taking medications for
diabetes. Physical and laboratory exami-
nation included measured height and
weight and, in half the sample, fasting
blood plasma glucose; our study included
all adults 20 years of age with recorded
fasting plasma glucose.
We calculated BMI from measured
height and weight and classified partici-
pants as normal weight (BMI 18.5­24.9
kg/m2), overweight (BMI 25.0­29.9 kg/
m2), and obese (BMI 30.0 kg/m2). We
excluded underweight (BMI 18.5 kg/
m2) participants and women who were
pregnant.
Participants were defined as having
evidence of diabetes if a doctor told
them they had diabetes or if their fasting
glucose was 126 mg/dl based on
American Diabetes Association criteria
(7). We classified participants with dia-
betes as diagnosed if they were aware of
their condition.
We compared the prevalence and di-
agnosis of diabetes across BMI categories
using 2 tests. We developed multivari-
able models to examine the association
between BMI and undiagnosed diabetes
adjusting for relevant confounders (Table
1). The National Health and Nutrition Ex-
amination Survey does not distinguish
type 2 (adult onset) diabetes from type 1
diabetes; therefore, we repeated our pri-
mary analyses excluding participants di-
agnosed before age 30 years who were on
insulin. We weighted analyses to reflect
U.S. population estimates and used
SUDAAN to derive appropriate SEs.
RESULTS -- Of 5,514 adults, 658
(9.8%) demonstrated evidence of diabe-
tes, representing an estimated 18.6 million
U.S. adults; of these, 28.1% (estimated 5.2
million) were undiagnosed.
Obese adults had a higher prevalence
of diabetes than overweight or normal-
weight adults (P  0.001; Table 1.) The
proportion of those undiagnosed was
comparable between obese (27.4%, 99 of
327), overweight (32.5%, 68 of 225), and
normal-weight adults (22.2%, 32 of 106;
P  0.32). In the U.S., obese adults com-
prise an estimated 2.7 million of the 5.2
million adults with undiagnosed diabetes;
overweight and normal-weight adults com-
prise 1.8 and 0.7 million, respectively.

diabetes, adults with higher BMI were
not any less likely to have undiagnosed
diabetes.
CONCLUSIONS -- Despite wide-
spread recognition that obesity is a strong
risk factor for diabetes, we found that
obese adults were no more likely to have
their diabetes diagnosed than nonobese
adults. Obese adults account for 2.7 mil-
lion cases, or more than half of the 5.2
million cases, of undiagnosed diabetes
each year in the U.S.
Our findings complement those of
Gregg et al. (8) who examined trends in
diagnosed and undiagnosed diabetes by
weight category. While that study did
not specifically compare the likelihood
of having undiagnosed diabetes across
different BMI groups, Gregg et al. did
find that adults with moderate to severe
obesity had the largest relative decline
in the ratio of undiagnosed to diagnosed
diabetes.
The finding that adults with higher
BMI are no more likely than those with
lower BMI to have their diabetes diag-
nosed is somewhat unexpected given
the widespread recognition of obesity's
predisposition toward diabetes. One
reason may be that a disproportionate
number of normal-weight adults identi-
fied with diabetes have type 1 diabetes,
which often produces symptoms earlier
in the disease course. Delays in diagno-
sis in overweight and obese adults who
are at higher risk of type 2 diabetes may
reflect delays in experiencing, recogniz-
ing, and presenting symptoms of diabe-
tes in a timely manner. Competing
health concerns, social stigma, and
health system bias, however, may also
contribute to this phenomenon (9,10).
Furthermore, because some guide-
lines do not recommend systematic
screening, clinicians may place lower
priority on screening for diabetes in fa-
vor of more established preventive mea-
sures. Given the higher risk of diabetes,
lack of systematic screening has greater
implications for obese adults. Even
though obese adults comprise only one
third of the general population, they
comprise more than 50% of U.S. adults
with undiagnosed diabetes. Studies
suggest that routine screening for dia-
betes is highly cost-effective (11). How-
ever, whether pharmacologic treatment
of early type 2 diabetes yields benefits
that outweigh the potential costs of
screening and early diagnosis is unclear.
Nevertheless, timely diagnosis may lead
to indirect benefits, especially among
those with overweight and obesity, by
motivating efforts to control weight and
enact lifestyle changes such as improv-
ing diet and exercise, which have been
shown to reduce the risk of developing
diabetes (12). Future studies are needed
to examine the public health impact of
screening strategies that incorporate a
nuanced consideration for overweight
and obesity.
Our study has limitations. Formal di-
agnosis was based on self-report. Stan-
dardized BMI cut points tend to
underestimate risks of higher weight in
Asians (13). In addition, our sample size,
particularly among normal-weight adults
with evidence of diabetes, was relatively
modest; it is possible that we were under-
powered to detect meaningful differences
in the likelihood of having undiagnosed
diabetes across different BMI groups.
In summary, obese adults are no
more likely to have their diabetes diag-
nosed than normal-weight or over-
weight adults. Because of their higher
disease risk, obese adults account for
more than one-half of those with undi-
agnosed diabetes in the U.S. Clinicians
and policy-makers may want to con-
sider the underlying risk of diabetes as-
sociated with body weight in making
decisions concerning whom should be
screened for diabetes.
