Abstract
Objective: To report the long-term impact on cardiovascular (CV) outcomes and mortality of a
2-year hospital-based multi-interventional care programme as compared with general practitioner
(GP)-provided standard care.
Methods: Patients with type 2 diabetes with ! 1 additional CV risk factor were randomized to
2 years of specialist-based, multi-intervention comprising lifestyle modification and specific
pharmacological treatment, or GP-based standard care. After the 2-year intervention period, all
participants returned to pre-study care, but were followed up for CVoutcomes and mortality. The
primary outcome was time to any first severe CV event or death.
Results: A total of 120 patients (31 women) were enrolled in the study. During the mean Æ SD
observational period of 8.7 Æ 2.0 years, 27 patients (16 and 11 in the multi-intervention and
standard care groups, respectively) experienced at least one primary outcome event, with a hazard
ratio (HR) if allocated to the multi-intervention group of 1.73 (95% confidence interval (CI) 0.80,
3.75). The HR for total mortality was 1.82 (95% CI 0.66, 5.01).

Introduction
In patients with type 2 diabetes, hypergly-
caemia is associated with increased risk of
cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortal-
ity,1 and studies have shown that approxi-
mately 50% of all deaths among people with
diabetes can be ascribed to CV disease.2,3
Stringent blood glucose control has been
shown to decrease the risk for microvascular
disease, but the effects on macrovascular
outcomes remain controversial.4 The
ACCORD study even suggested increased
mortality risk with intensive glucose low-
ering,5 a finding that to date is not yet fully
explained.6
Since type 2 diabetes is often part of a
cardiometabolic syndrome with hyperten-
sion, dyslipidaemia, and central obesity, a
strategy of targeting multiple CV risk fac-
tors is considered necessary. This was also
illustrated in the STENO-2 study, which
observed a long-term CV benefit of an
intensified, target-driven, multi-factorial
approach in 160 type 2 diabetes patients
with albuminuria and high CV risk;7,8 an
effect largely mediated (>70%) by the effects
of lipid modulation.9
The randomized-controlled Asker and
Bærum Cardiovascular Diabetes (ABCD)
study showed that 2 years of structured,
hospital-based multi-intervention signifi-
cantly improved CV risk factors and
reduced the estimated 10-year absolute risk
for coronary heart disease,10 driven by
between-group differences in glycosylated
haemoglobin (HbA1c
), systolic blood pres-
sure, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol
(LDL-C) and triglycerides. At the conclu-
sion of the 2-year study, all patients returned
to pre-study care with no further scheduled
clinical intervention by the study team.10
The present pre-specified analysis assessed
whether the shorter-term reduction in esti-
mated CV risk translated into longer-term
reductions in CV outcomes and death as
evaluated at a mean Æ SD of 8.7 Æ 2.0 years
following randomization.
Patients and methods
Study population and study design
The study design, intervention and inter-
mediate results of the ABCD study (clinical
trials.gov id: NCT00133718) have been
reported previously.10 In brief, 120 patients
with type 2 diabetes and !1 additional CV
risk factor were enrolled in an open, rando-
mized controlled study and allocated to
either 2 years of intensive, hospital-based,
structured multi-intervention (n ¼ 60) or
standard care (n ¼ 60) (Figure 1). All par-
ticipants underwent a comprehensive diag-
nostic work-up at baseline including medical
history, physical examination, 24-h ambula-
tory blood pressure monitoring (ABPM),
laboratory assessment and urinary assess-
ment of albumin excretion. A subpopulation
of the cohort also underwent coronary
angiography. All baseline procedures,
except coronary angiography and 24-h
ABPM, were repeated 2 years after

randomization. Structured intensive multi-
intervention comprised of 6 months of
lifestyle intervention (i.e. advice on diet,
exercise and smoking cessation and
reimbursement of cost associated with exer-
cise training), where medication was kept
unchanged, followed by targeted, pharma-
cological treatment to reach pre-specified

48 mmol/mol
[6.5%]; total/LDL-C < 5.0/3.0 mmol/l; sys-
tolic/diastolic blood pressure [BP] < 130/
80 mmHg) (for more details see Table 1).
The participants were seen by a physician
(diabetologist) at 3-monthly intervals at the
out-patient clinic of Bærum Hospital, Vestre
Viken Hospital Trust, Drammen, Norway.
The standard care group remained under the
care of their general practitioners (GPs) who
were recommended to treat according to
current guidelines with a recommended
follow-up at 3-monthly intervals (Table 1).10
Patients who completed the 2-year
study were returned to the standard of
care they had prior to study enrolment.
Patients were followed for CV events, hos-
pitalizations and death and all patients alive
were invited to participate in this current
follow-up with clinical and laboratory
assessments.
Informed consent to participate was
obtained from all participants in this study,
which was conducted in accordance with the
Helsinki declaration and approved by the
Regional Committees for Medical and
Health Research Ethics.
Cardiovascular outcomes
The primary outcome was time to any first
of the events of the composite outcome:
non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-
fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable
angina pectoris (UAP), coronary revascu-
larization, percutaneous transluminal angio-
plasty, amputation, hospitalization for heart
failure, and death from all causes. Since
coronary angiography was a study proced-
ure, revascularization procedures occurring
immediately during, and triggered by, the
study procedure, were excluded. Secondary
outcomes were total mortality as well as the
overall cumulative event rates of the com-
posite primary outcome and its components.
Information on events was collected from
hospital records. In two cases, data on the
cause of death were obtained from the
Norwegian Cause of Death Registry. All
outcome events were adjudicated by two of
the authors (L.L.G. and K.I.B.) blinded to
the treatment allocation.
Analyses of blood and urine
Laboratory parameters were assessed in
fasting venous blood samples. Urinary albu-
min excretion was determined in timed
overnight samples. Albuminuria was defined
as urinary albumin excretion > 20 mg/min in
two out of three samples.11
Exercise testing
Exercise capacity was assessed at baseline,
study-end, and at the 7-year follow-up by a
modified conventional maximum stress test
on a cycle ergometer as described previ-
ously.12 Maximum oxygen consumption
(ml/kg per min) was used to describe max-
imum exercise capacity.
Coronary angiography
Irrespective of the results from noninvasive
tests, coronary angiography was performed
in 91 patients at baseline according to
standard procedures.13 Significant coronary
artery disease was defined as the presence
of ! 50% luminal diameter narrowing of
one or more of the epicardial arteries or its
major branches.
Statistical analyses
Based on the STENO-2 study (approxi-
mately 715 patient-years of follow-up),8
this present study targeted at least 1000
patient-years of follow-up to ensure that the
effect of the multi-intervention could be
assessed with a reasonable level of power.
Analysis of outcomes was performed
according to the intention-to-treat principle
and each patient who did not have an event

Triglycerides and microalbuminuria were
log-transformed due to their markedly
skewed distributions. The between-group
difference in change in outcome variables
from baseline to study-end, and from study-
end to the 7-year follow-up, were explored
using linear regression analyses with meas-
urements at either study-end or at 7 years as
dependent variables and baseline measure-
ments or measurements at study-end,
respectively, and treatment group, as inde-
pendent variables (analysis of covariance).
Dichotomous variables were explored by the
2-test and the between-group differences in
change in categorical variables were esti-
mated with the exact Wilcoxon Mann­
Whitney U-test. Sensitivity analyses were
performed with different imputation values
(i.e. mean values, high values, low values).
All regression models fulfilled the assump-
tions of normally distributed residuals and a
Cook's distance < 1.
The association between group allocation
and outcome was explored with Cox regres-
sion analysis. Sensitivity analyses adjusting
for baseline differences between the groups
(body mass index [BMI] and microalbumi-
nuria) as well as sulphonylurea (SU) use at
baseline, were undertaken. The assumption
of proportional hazards was tested using
Scho
¨ nfelds residuals.
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ statistical package, version
23.0 (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ. A P-value < 0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 120 patients with type 2 diabetes
were enrolled in the 2-year ABCD study.
Of these, 106 patients (multi-intervention
group: n ¼ 49; standard care group: n ¼ 57)
completed the 2-year study (Figure 1), after
which all participants returned to the care
they had prior to study enrolment. Patients
were followed for CV events, hospitaliza-
tions and death during a mean Æ SD of
8.7 Æ 2.0 years from randomization, and all
patients alive were invited to participate in
this current follow-up study with clinical
and laboratory assessments that occurred at
a mean Æ SD of 7.2 Æ 0.4 years after
randomization.
Baseline characteristics of the two treat-
ment groups are given in Tables 2 and 3. Of
the 120 participants, three were lost to
follow-up (had moved) and complete infor-
mation on the primary outcome was avail-
able for 117 patients. Sixteen patients had
died and 85 participants (43 and 42 from the
multi-intervention and standard care
groups, respectively) agreed and were able
to participate in the clinical follow-up visit
at a mean Æ SD of 7.2 Æ 0.4 after
randomization.
During a mean Æ SD observation time of
8.7 Æ 2.0 years, corresponding to 1029
patient-years, 27 patients, 16 in the multi-
intervention group and 11 in standard care
group, experienced at least one primary
outcome event. In total, including recurrent
events, there were a total of 46 events (16
deaths [five CV deaths, 11 non-CV deaths],
seven non-fatal MIs, eight non-fatal strokes,
one hospitalization for UAP, six hospital-
izations for heart failure, one amputation,
one percutaneous transluminal angioplasty,
and six coronary revascularizations)
(Table 4), yielding a yearly incidence rate
of 4.5% (46 events of 1029 patient-years).
There were numerically more events occur-
ring in the multi-intervention group than in
the standard care group, and, as expected,
more in the years after than during the
2-year intervention in both groups. There
were more strokes occurring in the multi-
intervention group compared with the
standard care group (eight versus none
non-fatal strokes and three versus one fatal
stroke, respectively). In total, 19 patients
underwent 20 coronary revascularization
Ofstad et al. 1541
procedures during the entire study period,
but only six of these were considered to be
study-independent and included in the ana-
lyses as explained in the `Patients and
methods' section. The hazard ratio (HR)
determined by Cox regression analysis of the
time to any first of the events in the primary
outcome comparing allocation to the multi-
intervention group with the standard care
group was 1.73 (95% confidence interval
[CI] 0.80, 3.75), whereas for total mortal-
ity the HR was 1.82 (95% CI 0.66, 5.01)
(Figure 2).
At the long-term follow-up visit, there
was no between-group difference in the
mean Æ SD overall number of oral antidia-
betic pharmacological agents used (1.6 Æ 1.0
versus 1.3 Æ 0.8 in the multi-intervention
compared with the standard care group,
respectively), but the use of insulin was
higher in the standard care group
(Table 5). Despite this, the mean HbA1c
was lower in the multi-intervention group
(Table 6). The use of blood pressure-low-
ering medication, and in particular angio-
tensin-converting enzyme inhibitors/
angiotensin receptor blockers (ACEI/
ARBs), remained higher in the multi-inter-
vention group compared with the standard
care group, but the blood pressure levels
were similar in the two groups. Statin use,
which had increased in both groups, but
more so in the multi-intervention group,
during the intervention (Table 7), continued
to increase in the standard care group from
study-end and remained unchanged in the
multi-intervention group (Table 5). This
resulted in a significant between-group dif-
ference in the change in LDL-C levels, with
the LDL-C levels decreasing in the standard
care group and increasing in the multi-
intervention group from study-end to
follow-up (P ¼ 0.031) (Table 6). During the
same period, estimated glomerular filtration

rate remained unchanged in the multi-inter-
vention group, whereas in the standard care
group it increased significantly from baseline
to end of intervention (P-value for within-
group change < 0.001) and then decreased
slightly at the long-term follow-up.
Adjustment for imbalances at baseline
between the two treatment groups did not
significantly alter the HR for the primary
outcome (adjusted HR 1.65; 95% CI 0.69,
3.99; P ¼ 0.26), neither did adjustment for
SU use at baseline (HR 1.68; 95% CI 0.78,
3.65; P ¼ 0.19). Also, applying different
methods of imputation did not significantly
alter the results (data not shown).
Discussion
In this present study, 2 years of specialist-
based, targeted, multi-intervention with life-
style intervention and intensification of
pharmacological treatment did not translate
into a reduced long-term risk for CV events
and mortality as compared with standard
care. While lipid and BP levels were similar
in the two groups at 5 years after termin-
ation of the intervention period, the mean
HbA1c
level was still slightly lower in the
multi-intervention group. Interestingly, a
numerical imbalance in the primary out-
come disfavouring intensified multi-inter-
vention was observed. Although not
significant, this finding may lead to specula-
tion of an adverse effect of intensive glucose
lowering, in line with what was reported
from the ACCORD study.5 Potential mech-
anisms for such an adverse outcome that
have been proposed include the high use of
glitazones in the intensively-treated group,
and the low target for and rapid decline in
HbA1c
in this group.6 In the present study,
the lowest mean HbA1c
level in the multi-
intervention group of 50 mmol/mol (6.7%)
was achieved slightly slower than in the
ACCORD study, i.e. after approximately 12
to 18 months.10 These present results show-
ing no long-term CV benefit associated with

improved glycaemic control are also in line
with the follow-up study of the glucose arm
in the ADVANCE study,14 but in contrast
to the UKPDS and VADT follow-up
trials.15,16 This lack of benefit also occurred
in spite of a clear beneficial impact on CV
risk markers at the end of intervention, as
previously reported:10 the multi-interven-
tion group had improved fasting blood
glucose, HbA1c
, total cholesterol, and
LDL-C more than the standard group
(Table 3), with a significantly greater pro-
portion achieving treatment targets for
HbA1c
, fasting blood glucose and
LDL-C.10 As expected, the use of oral
blood glucose lowering and antihypertensive
medication, statins and acetylsalicylic
acid had increased more in the multi-inter-
vention group. One could speculate whether
in particular the higher use of glitazones
(7% to 35% in the multi-intervention group,
2% to 9% in the standard care group from
baseline to the end of the 2-year interven-
tion) and sulphonylureas (47% to 53% in
the multi-intervention group and 37% to
27% in the standard care group from base-
line to the end of the 2-year intervention),
although small numbers, may potentially
have contributed to the possible harm
seen, as both these drug classes are reported
to have adverse or uncertain CV effects
(Table 7).17,18
These current findings are at variance
with the STENO-2 study, where a significant
reduction in the risk of CV events and
mortality was associated with the use of a
multifactorial intervention.7,8 Of note is that
the STENO-2 study included high CV risk
type 2 diabetes patients with microalbumi-
nuria and hence higher baseline CV risk
than in the present study. There could be
several reasons for these diverging results,
the major being the longer intervention
period and follow-up used in the STENO-2
study and the different approach to lipid
modulation.7,8 Furthermore, the minimum
mean HbA1c
level achieved in the current

study was lower than in the STENO-2 study
(50 mmol/mol [6.7%] versus 63 mmol/mol
[7.9%]).7,8 It was speculated after the
ACCORD study that too aggressive glucose
lowering in patients at CV risk could be
harmful.5,19 The use of glitazones was higher
in the current study since these drugs were
not a part of the treatment algorithm in the
STENO-2 study and hence were not used.7,8
The use of other drugs with established CV
effects also differed between the two studies:
in STENO-2, the use of ACEIs in the
intensive group was 15% at baseline, and
69% at the end of the intervention, and
statins were only used by 2% at baseline and
33% at the end of the intervention.20 The
respective numbers in the multi-intervention
group in the present study were 58% for
ACEI/ARB use at baseline and 82% at
study-end, and 48% for baseline statin use
increasing to 88% at study-end. Thus, the
present study population was receiving a
different level of medication for CV protec-
tion, potentially making it more challenging
to improve CV outcomes further. This
assumption is supported by a mediation
analysis indicating that > 70% of the CV
risk reduction seen in the STENO-2 study
was ascribed to lipid lowering.9
Further studies supporting the STENO-2
study, with CV benefits being achievable
also in populations with advanced type 2
diabetes, are the follow-up study of the
VADT16 as well as the EMPA-REG
OUTCOME.21 The latter study demon-
strated that empagliflozin versus placebo,
on top of standard care, in type 2 diabetes
patients with established CV disease (i.e. at
an advanced disease stage), significantly
reduced CV death by 38% and hospitaliza-
tion for heart failure by 35%.21 The
between-group difference in HbA1c
was, as
expected, modest (3­7 mmol/mol [0.3­
0.6%]); and given the multi-modal effects
of empagliflozin (reductions in BP, arterial
stiffness, weight and visceral adiposity),22­24
it is likely that modulations of non-glycae-
mic pathways are more influential.
The present study had several limitations
of which the most important were the rela-
tively small number of participants and the
relatively short intervention and follow-up
periods. Another limitation relates to the
slight imbalances at baseline with a higher
prevalence of microalbuminuria and higher
BMI in the multi-intervention group, which
could influence the effects of the interven-
tion. Furthermore, there was a lack data on
the frequency of hypoglycaemic episodes in
this study. Study strengths were the com-
prehensive characterization of the partici-
pants, a real-life setting with an intervention
that was limited in time, however not too
short, and the blinded adjudication of all
clinical endpoints.
In conclusion, 2 years of structured,
hospital-based multi-intervention in a popu-
lation with type 2 diabetes and additional
CV risk did not improve long-term CV
outcomes or mortality despite a short-term
improvement in estimated CV risk and
sustained benefit on glycaemia. A numerical
increased risk of CV events and death in the
multi-intervention group may be related to
the choice of drugs used.
