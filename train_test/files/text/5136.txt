Explaining the Growth in US Health Care
Spending Using State-Level Variation in
Income, Insurance, and Provider Market
Dynamics
Bradley Herring, PhD1 and Erin Trish, PhD2
Abstract
The slowed growth in national health care spending over the past decade has led analysts to question the extent to which
this recent slowdown can be explained by predictable factors such as the Great Recession or must be driven by some
unpredictable structural change in the health care sector. To help address this question, we first estimate a regression model
for state personal health care spending for 1991-2009, with an emphasis on the explanatory power of income, insurance, and
provider market characteristics. We then use the results from this simple predictive model to produce state-level projections
of health care spending for 2010-2013 to subsequently compare those average projected state values with actual national
spending for 2010-2013, finding that at least 70% of the recent slowdown in health care spending can likely be explained
by long-standing patterns. We also use the results from this predictive model to both examine the Great Recession's likely
reduction in health care spending and project the Affordable Care Act's insurance expansion's likely increase in health care
spending.

Background
The growth in national health care spending has slowed con-
siderably over the past several years. For instance, the aver-
age annual inflation-adjusted growth rate for national health
care spending per capita was 3.76% for years 2000-2007 ver-
sus a much lower 1.48% for years 2008-2013.1 The relatively
partisan passage of the 2010 Affordable Care Act (ACA) has
made quantifying the determinants of health care spending
growth quite politically controversial in recent years. For
instance, advocates behind the passage of the ACA tend to
credit structural changes to the delivery of health care as a
main determinant for the recent reduction in health care
spending,2 whereas others tend to suggest that the Great
Recession was instead responsible for most of this recent
reduction in health care spending growth.3
What does the broader literature say about the macro-level
determinants of health care spending? Health economists have
long agreed that the introduction of new medical technologies
over time explains the consistently higher rates of inflation for
health care spending compared with the rest of the economy,
though other factors explaining rising health care spending
include rising real income, increasing insurance, and aging of
the population.4 More recent analysis has focused on condi-
tion-related increases in health care spending, with some
analyses of the increases in the prevalence of disease and other
analyses of the condition-specific increases in spending per
case.5-7
Regarding the more recent slowdown in health care
spending first seen in the late 2000s, some broad analysis
focuses on the effect of decreases in real income and their
associated changes with individuals moving from private
insurance coverage to public insurance coverage or
uninsurance.8 Moreover, other analysis suggests that a tem-
porary decline in the adoption of expensive new medical
technologies explains some of the recent slowdown (along
with the rise in high-deductible plans and Medicaid payment
reductions) but that prior high growth rates will likely persist
due to a sustained pipeline of new technologies.9 Other
recent analysis also suggests that changes in benefit design

of employment-based coverage have had an effect on the
recent slowdown in health care spending.10
Overview of Our Analyses
Our contribution to this literature examining recent changes
in health care spending growth is that we not only apply a
more systematic approach to modeling long-term health care
spending but also exploit the wide geographic variation in
total health care spending; see, for instance, the research
associated with the Dartmouth Atlas examining geographic
variation in Medicare spending.11 Specifically, we focus on
the association of health care spending with income, insur-
ance coverage, and provider market characteristics, in which
we use a regression-based modeling approach with a rela-
tively longtime series of data, somewhat similar to that used
in the modeling of national health care spending.12-14
However, unlike those long-term models that focus on
national health care spending, we build on the Center for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Office of the
Actuary's separate analysis of state personal health care
expenditures.15 Specifically, we use data for state total health
care spending for 1991-2009, available from the National
Health Expenditure Accounts (NHEA) data from the CMS
Office of the Actuary (as 2009 was the last year these state-
level measures were released) and state-level data for various
explanatory characteristics.
We then examine the extent to which the recent slowdown
in health care spending growth since 2009 can be explained
by changes in these characteristics in our state-level model
for health care spending. To do so, we first take these models
explaining historical state health care spending (with one
model for the full 1991-2009 period and a secondary model
for just the 2000-2009 period) to make state-level projec-
tions of health care spending for 2010-2013. We then com-
pare their amounts, aggregated from the state level to the
national level, with actual national health care spending from
the CMS NHEA for 2010-2013 to, in turn, make inferences
about the extent to which these three sets of explanatory
characteristics for income, insurance, and provider markets
explain recent spending growth during this 2010-2013 time
period.
We also produce estimates of both the likely decrease in
health care spending due to the Great Recession's decline in
income and the likely increases in health care spending
induced by the ACA's insurance expansions. For the latter,
we apply our observed relationships between insurance and
spending from our model (presented below) to the
Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) long-run projected
changes in health insurance coverage to determine the likely
percent increase in future health care spending induced by
the ACA's insurance expansions. Although the CMS Office
of the Actuary projects health care spending to increase in
the future due to the improving economy and expanded
insurance coverage,16,17 with the latter due to the strong
connection between insurance coverage and health care
spending, it does not isolate the independent effects of these
factors.
Methodology
To examine these various issues, we first quantify the histori-
cal relationship between income, insurance coverage, and
provider market dynamics and the magnitude of personal
health care spending. Our goal here is not to derive a careful
causal effect of any given characteristic on health care spend-
ing in isolation. Instead, our goal is to pull together as much
comprehensive data as possible (consistent with known
causal predictors of health care spending) to include in one
single relatively straightforward regression model for total
personal health care spending.
Specifically, we estimate a state-level autoregressive model
with health care spending as the dependent variable and state-
level measures of income, insurance coverage, and provider
market characteristics and state fixed effects as the explanatory
variables for years 1991-2009. Our analysis uses the 48 con-
tiguous states, as data for some explanatory variables are
incomplete for Alaska, Hawaii, and the District of Columbia.
Specifically, we estimate a regression model incorporating
first-order autocorrelation assumed to have the following form:
Log HC Inc Ins Prov State

     , (1)
v v N

and (2)
where Log HC

is the log of real total personal health care
spending per capita for state i in year t, Inc
it
is a set of
income measures for state i in year t, Ins
it
is a set of health
insurance coverage measures for state i in year t, Prov
it
is a
set of provider market measures for state i in year t, and
State
i
is an indicator variable for state i. Because the model
incorporates an autoregressive process for Log HCit, we
do not need to add a time trend variable, particularly
because the model's predicted values of health care spend-
ing for 2010-2013 could be sensitive to the choice of the
functional form chosen; moreover, a full set of year-
by-year indicators is not feasible for generating out-of-
sample predictions.
The Yule-Walker estimation method for this autoregres-
sive model is a two-step process in which a naïve ordinary
least squares (OLS) model's residuals (from Equation 1
alone) first generate an initial estimate of the autoregressive
parameter, , which, in turn, generates a variance matrix for
v (as specified in Equation 2). This covariance matrix for v
then enables a generalized least squares estimation for coef-
ficients , , and  (from Equation 2).18 Because our empiri-
cal strategy still incorporates repeated observations over
time within each state, we generate robust standard errors
that account for this clustering.
Herring and Trish 3
By examining the log of health care spending per capita as the
dependent variable, each of the regression coefficients can be
interpreted as the percent change in spending associated with a
one-unit change in the explanatory variable. The vector of 
coefficients measure the association of health care spending with
income, the vector of  coefficients measure the association with
health insurance coverage, and the vector of  coefficients mea-
sure the association with the provider market characteristics.
The remainder of this section provides details about
each of these different explanatory measures in this
regression model. Partly due to data availability (as indi-
cated below) and partly due to an interest in exploring
how the effect of these characteristics might differ over
time, we examine regression models for two different
time periods: 1991-2009 and 2000-2009. The "Results
for the Characteristics Associated With State Health Care
Spending" section presents the results for the explanatory
effects of these three sets of measures on health care
spending from these models.
Data for State Health Care Spending
The data for state personal health care spending, HCit
in the
regression equation above, come from the CMS Office of
the Actuary's National Health Expenditures Account data
series "National Health Expenditures Accounts by State of
Residence" (hereafter referred to as "NHEA-S" to contrast
with "NHEA-H" for the subsequent "historical" data series
for nationwide spending). These state-level data are for
total health care spending, regardless of payer, that is, they
are the sum of Medicare spending, Medicaid spending, pri-
vate insurer spending, and out-of-pocket spending (whether
insured or uninsured). However, the state-level data do not
include data for "Government Administration and Net Cost
of Health Insurance" nor "Government Public Health
Activities." The NHEA-S data are provided by CMS in
nominal amounts, but we adjust them (and relevant explan-
atory variables presented below) for inflation using the
Consumer Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI-U)
by presenting all values in 2014 US dollars.
Data for Explanatory Variables
Income. The first set of explanatory variables, Inc
it
, is a set of
three state income characteristics. One is the state's real per
capita income in thousands of dollars. These data are avail-
able from the Bureau of Economic Analysis' Regional Eco-
nomic Accounts (BEA REA) and, like the CMS NHEA-S
data, are presented in 2014 dollars here by adjusting by the
CPI-U. The second characteristic is the percent of the state
population living below the federal poverty line. These data
are available from the Census Bureau's Small Area Income
and Poverty Estimates (SAIPE). Values for 1991, 1992, and
1994, which were not produced by the Census, are thus
imputed via interpolation using the 1989 (as 1990 is also
missing), 1993, and 1995 SAIPE data (and assuming a linear
trend by year). The third characteristic is the state unemploy-
ment rate. These data are available from the Bureau of Labor
Statistics Local Area Unemployment (BLS LAU) data. The
rationale here is the literature demonstrating that people gen-
erally get healthier in recessions,19 though the relationship
with spending is not obvious, as it is possible that higher
health spending (from increased free time) improves health
or that improved health decreases health care spending.
Insurance.The second set of explanatory variables, Insit, is a
set of insurance coverage measures from the March Supple-
ment of the Current Population Survey (CPS). Specifically, we
produce estimates of the percent of the state covered by Medi-
care or TRICARE, covered by Medicaid or the Children's
Health Insurance Program (CHIP), and covered by private
insurance (with the remainder uninsured) The main underlying
rationale here (when controlling for income's effect on afford-
ability) is the "moral hazard" effect of increased consumption
of health care when covered by insurance.20 A secondary
underlying rationale here is the differences in prices paid for
private versus public insurance, Medicare versus Medicaid
public insurance, and insurance versus uninsurance. TRICARE
is the program covering the military and their dependents (pre-
viously known as the Civilian Health and Medical Program of
the Uniformed Services, or CHAMPUS), and we pool those
covered by TRICARE with those covered by Medicare due to
limited sample size of the former, especially for small states in
the CPS. Similarly, we do not distinguish employment-based
coverage from individual (or "nongroup") coverage in the pri-
vately insured category due to small sample sizes.
WealsoincludeameasureofHealthMaintenanceOrganization
(HMO) penetration, as HMOs are generally associated with
lower health care spending.21 Data for 1991-1999 are from
Doug Wholey,22 and data for 2002-2012 are from Decision
Resources Group's HealthLeaders/InterStudy (HLIS) survey.
To have a consistent measure across the entire period, we define
HMO penetration as total enrollment in Medicare Part C (ie,
MedicareAdvantage after 2003), Medicaid HMOs, and private/
commercial HMOs divided by the entire population. After pro-
ducing analogous data from the 2002-2012 HLIS, we interpo-
lated values for 2000-2001 and extrapolated values for 2013
(assuming a linear trend over time), and divided the total HMO
enrollment by the total population.
We also include a measure of self-reported health, partly
because those with higher expected spending may be more
inclined to obtain health insurance coverage,23 and therefore
there might otherwise be an omitted variable bias for the
association of insurance coverage with health care spending.
That said, we are also primarily interested in the direct effect
of health status on health care spending. Our measure of
health status comes from the Behavioral Risk Factor
Surveillance System (BRFSS) question, "Would you say that
in general your health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor?" where we use a measure of the percent of adults
reporting fair or poor health. Because this question was
added to the BRFSS in 1993 and a few states are missing for
4 INQUIRY
certain years (specifically, Wyoming in 1993 and Rhode
Island in 1994, whereas District of Columbia missing in
1995 and Hawaii missing in 2004 are not an issue because
we only use the 48 contiguous states in our analysis), we
extrapolate values for 1991-1992 and those two other obser-
vations assuming a linear time trend over time. Although we
would ideally include additional measures (such as smoking,
obesity, and related chronic conditions) if available through-
out this entire time period, self-reported health status has
been shown to be a quite valid measure for other specific
objective measures of health, including mortality.24,25
Providers. The third set of explanatory variables, Prov
it
, is a set
of provider market characteristics for physicians and hospitals.
One measure for physicians reflects the malpractice claim envi-
ronment for the state. Specifically, we include an indicator for
whether the state has a law in effect to cap noneconomic dam-
ages in jury awards and an indicator for whether the state has a
law in effect to replace joint and several liability with propor-
tionate share allocation of liability. These data come from Uni-
versity of Texas Law School Professor Ronen Avraham's
Database of State Tort Law Reforms (DSTLR).26 One underly-
ing rationale here is the direct effect of these reforms on mal-
practice premiums paid by physicians and the resulting impact
of these premiums on provider prices, whereas the second
underlying rationale here is the indirect effect of legal liability
risk on the practice of "defensive medicine." Prior research has
found that caps on noneconomic damages decrease health care
spending, whereas joint and several reforms increase health care
spending (with the thought that proportionate share allocation
seems to actually increase risk of lawsuits for physicians, as
plaintiffs formerly focused on targeting hospitals).27,28
Asecond measure for physicians is the number of physicians
per capita, which reflects the equilibrium for both supply and
demand. These county-level data are available from the Health
Resources and Services Aministration's (HRSA) Area Health
Resources File (AHRF) for 1990, 1995, and 2000-2013. Values
for 1991-1994 and 1996-1999 are imputed as a linear trend from
1990,1995,and2000.Morephysicianspercapitacouldincrease
spending through welfare improvements in access to care or
inefficiencies associated with supplier-induced demand,
whereas fewer physicians per capita could alternatively increase
spending through decreased price competition.29
One measure for hospitals is the number of general com-
munity hospital beds per capita, which also reflects the equi-
libriumforbothsupplyanddemand.Thesedataareconstructed
from HRSA's AHRF for 1991-1999 and from the American
Hospital Association's (AHA) Annual Survey for 2000-2013.
More hospital beds could likewise increase spending through
improved access or increased supplier-induced demand,
whereas fewer hospitals could likewise increase hospital
prices through increased price competition.30
Asecond measure for hospitals is a more accurate measure
of hospital market concentration for years 2000-2013, again
with the rationale that hospitals with increased market power
will have higher prices for those with private insurance.
(We do not have access to these propriety AHA data before
2000.) Specifically, we first construct a market-level concen-
tration measure based on the commonly used Herfindahl-
Hirschman Index (HHI) using Core-Based Statistical Areas,
and their Metropolitan Divisions (CBSD) therein, to define
geographic markets and hospital market shares using the
AHA's private-pay inpatient days aggregated to the hospital
system within the market. For nonmetropolitan areas outside
CBSDs, we define the market as the nonmetropolitan collec-
tion of counties within the state. We then take the average of
the market-level HHI measures across the state, weighting by
county population. (We use only private-pay inpatient days
rather than all inpatient days, because market concentration in
the Medicare and Medicaid markets would not have an effect
on Medicare or Medicaid prices.)
We also examine a measure of average insurer market con-
centration within the state using data available from HLIS for
2005-2009 (as data to construct concentration measures using
both Preferred Provider Organization (PPO) and HMO data
enrollment are only available from HLIS for 2005 onward).
The rationale here is that insurers with increased market power
will negotiate lower physician and hospital prices.31 (Because
the CMS state-level NHEA-S data do not include the "Net Cost
of Health Insurance" measures, we would not detect a marginal
effect of insurer market concentration on the administrative
markup of private premiums.) Similar to our hospital market
concentration measure, we construct a market-level HHI defin-
ing geographic markets with CBSDs, using private insurer
market shares from the HLIS census of private insurers and
averaging these market-level measures across the state using
county population. Because of the relatively short time period
(which limits the ability of our state fixed-effects analyses to
detect relationships), and because this measure of insurer mar-
ket concentration ultimately has an insignificant association
with health care spending, we do not show these regression
results for the 2005-2009 subsample. Because insurer market
concentration is unrelated to fee-for-service Medicare and
Medicaid prices, the insignificant result is not unexpected.
Finally, we include a measure of the percent of the state
population living in a nonmetropolitan area--specifically,
not in either Metropolitan or Micropolitan CBSDs, as defined
by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). These
data are available from HRSA's AHRF.
As noted above, the causal inference of these characteris-
tics on spending from our analysis is limited by the lack of
exogenous instruments for the explanatory variables (and
thereby subject to possible reverse causality). Although an
explanation for higher spending leading to higher income is
unclear, high spending could lead to increased insurance
coverage through a higher demand for insurance or lead to
decreased insurance coverage through reduced affordability.
Moreover, high health care spending could lead to increased
consumer demand for HMOs, attenuating our expected
result. Endogeneity is also a concern for our provider mea-
sures, in that high spending could lead to an increase in the
supply of physicians and hospitals, thereby likely biasing the
Herring and Trish 5
supply measures' relationship upward but biasing the market
concentration measure's relationship downward.
Results for the Characteristics
Associated With State Health Care
Spending
Table 1 presents the mean values for all of these state-level
measures described in the "Methodology" section. As noted
above, the unit of observation in this table and in our subse-
quent regression analyses is the state × year, and the sample
includes the 48 contiguous states. The first two columns repre-
sent the two time periods we use for our regression analyses (ie,
1991-2009 and 2000-2009), with the latter based on data avail-
ability for the hospital market concentration measures and also
our interest in seeing whether there are any differences in the
association between health care spending and these various
characteristics over time. (To that end, we also examine the
2000-2009 models without hospital market concentration to
have the same set of explanatory variables.) The final column
shows all of these measures (except for state personal health
care spending per capita) for 2010-2013, with which we gener-
ate predicted values of state spending for 2010-2013 from the
1991-2009 model and the 2000-2009 model.

health care spending by year. The two columns of Table 2 show
the regression coefficients (interpreted as percent changes with
respect to one-unit changes in the explanatory characteristic)
from the generalized least squares regression for a first-order
autocorrelation using the Yule-Walk estimation method, with
the model's results for the years 1991-2009 in the first column
and the model's results for the years 2000-2009 (for which hos-
pital market concentration is available) in the second column.
(The coefficients for the state fixed effects are not shown.) The
Durbin-Watson statistics are relatively high (ie, 1.04 for the
1991-2009 analysis and 1.90 for the 2000-2009 analysis) sug-
gesting that the first-order autoregressive model is warranted
due to serial correlation across years. Table 3 converts these
regression coefficients to elasticity estimates for statistically
significant values and for relevant measures (ie, not the state
tort reform law indicators).
Regarding the income variables, an increase of real per
capita income is, as expected, significantly associated with

increases in health care spending in both the 1991-2009 and
2000-2009 models; the elasticity estimates are 0.51 and 0.61,
respectively. An increase in the poverty rate is significantly
associated with an increase in health care spending in both
the 1991-2009 and 2000-2009 models; the elasticity esti-
mates are 0.08 and 0.21, respectively. An increase in the
unemployment rate is significantly associated with an
increase in health care spending in both the 1991-2009 and
2000-2009 models; the elasticity estimates are 0.05 and 0.06,
respectively. (We discuss the implications of these findings
for income in more detail below in the "Conclusion" section
in the context of the impact of the Great Recession.)
Regarding the insurance characteristics, increases in the
percent with insurance coverage (relative to being uninsured)
are sometimes significantly associated with increases in
health care spending. The percent covered by Medicare or
TRICARE has a marginally significant 0.01 elasticity in the
1991-2009 model, but is insignificant in the 2000-2009
model. The percent covered by Medicaid or CHIP has sig-
nificant 0.01 and 0.04 elasticities in the 1991-2009 and 2000-
2009 models, respectively. The percent covered by private
insurance is insignificant in both the 1991-2009 and 2000-
2009 models. The stronger relationship for Medicaid
observed in the 2000-2009 period relative to the 1991-2009
period may result from noise in the earlier years before the
so-called "verification question" change to the CPS insur-
ance questions in 2000. (We discuss the implications of these
findings in more detail below in the "Conclusion" section in
the context of the ACA's insurance expansions.)
Moreover, the HMO penetration rate is, as expected, sig-
nificantly associated with decreases in health care spending in
both the 1991-2009 and 2000-2009 models; the elasticity esti-
mates are -0.01 and -0.03, respectively. In addition, the per-
cent of the adult population reporting fair or poor health status
is not associated with health care spending in either model.
Regarding the provider market characteristics related to physi-
cians, state malpractice reforms to cap noneconomic damages was
unexpectedly unrelated to health care spending in the 1991-2009
model and significantly associated with increases in health care
spending in the 2000-2009 model. State malpractice reforms to
replace joint and several liability with proportionate share alloca-
tion of liability was, as expected, significantly associated with
increases in health care spending in the 1991-2009 and 2000-2009
models. Moreover, an increase in the number of physicians per
capita is, as expected, significantly associated with increases in
health care spending in both the 1991-2009 and 2000-2009 mod-
els; the elasticity estimates are 0.40 and 0.53, respectively.
Regarding the hospital market characteristics, an increase
in the number of hospital beds per capita is significantly
associated with a decrease in health care spending in the
1991-2009 and 2000-2009 models; the elasticity estimates
are -0.11 and -0.17, respectively. However, an increase in
hospital market concentration is not associated with increases
in health care spending. As noted above, this finding for hos-
pital market concentration is likely attenuated because hospi-
tal market concentration is unrelated to prices paid for
Medicare and Medicaid beneficiaries.
Results for the Projections of State
Health Care Spending Out to 2013
We next use these regression results from the prior "Results
for the Characteristics Associated With State Health Care
Spending" section to produce estimates of projected health
care spending for years 2010-2013 using the state-level
income, insurance, and provider market characteristics for
years 2010-2013 as the explanatory variables. Recall that the
average values for these explanatory variables during this
time period are shown in the final column of Table 1. We
compare these projections from the state-based regression
model with actual national health care spending subsequently
released by CMS in their NHEA-H series below.
Figure 1 presents a graph with these personal health care
spending per capita estimates. The top shows the data for the
entire 1991-2013 period on the x-axis, whereas the bottom
then focuses on the upper right portion in the dotted-line box
to better observe the data series from 2005 onward. The first
series in blue simply presents the NHEA-H data for the entire
1991-2013 period, where the only change is to make an
adjustment for inflation using the CPI-U. The second series

in blue simply presents the average NHEA-S data for the
1991-2009 period (using state population by year to compute
these weighted averages). Overall, the two data series track
each other closely with deviations potentially explained by
the NHEA-S data we present omitting Alaska, Hawaii, and
District of Columbia and perhaps by subsequent minor revi-
sions to the NHEA-H data series after the 2009 NHEA-S
data were finalized (and thus not subsequently revised).
The average predicted values from the 1991-2009 regres-
sion model are shown in red in the figure for 1991 through
2013. The state-level regression model using the full 1991-
2009 period with the available income, insurance, and pro-
vider explanatory variables generates a predicted value of
$7963 for real per capita health care spending in 2013 (in
inflation-adjusted 2014 US$). The state-level regression
model using the 2000-2009 period with these explanatory
variables along with hospital market concentration generates
a slightly higher predicted value of $8150 for real per capita
health care spending in 2013 (in 2014 US$) and is not
included in the figure. These estimates for 2013 (and addi-
tional ones described below) are shown in Table 4.
While actual real per capita health care spending from the
CMS NHEA-H data was $7953 (in 2014 US$), what would
2013 health care spending have been in the absence of the
recent slowdown in the growth rate? One counterfactual
(shown in green in Figure 1) is that the 2009 value for real
national health care spending per capita of $7624 (in 2014
US$) could have grown at a real rate of 3.0%, equal to the
average 1991-2009 real growth rate from $4521 in 1999 (in
2014 US$). Under this scenario, 2013's health care spending
per capita (in 2014 US$) would have instead been $8566 (as
shown in the first row of Table 4). As a result, $603 (ie,
$8566 - $7963, where $7963 is the 1991-2009 model's pre-
diction for 2013) of the naïve $613 decline (ie,
Figure 1. Comparison of actual spending and counterfactual spending with the 1991-2009 prediction model.
Note. CMS = Center for Medicare and Medicaid Service; NHEA-H = National Health Expenditure Accounts - Historical; NHEA-S = National Health
Expenditure Accounts - by State of Residence.
Herring and Trish 9
$8566 - $7953, where $7953 is the actual 2013 amount) can
be explained by changes in these predictable income, insur-
ance, and provider characteristics. In other words, fully 98%
(ie, $603/$613) of the recent slowdown in health care spend-
ing can perhaps be explained by the predictable characteris-
tics rather than structural changes to the health care sector.
Similarly, using the 2000-2009 model's projection of $8150
for 2013 spending (in 2014 US$) compared with a counter-
factual $8696 for 2013 spending (in 2014 US$) from apply-
ing the 3.3% real growth rate observed for 2000-2009 implies
that 73% of the recent slowdown that can be explained by
predictable factors.) Graphically, almost all of 2013's differ-
ence between the blue and green lines can be explained by
the difference between the red and green lines. This finding
is dependent on the assumption made above about the unob-
served counterfactual growth rate in spending if the recent
slowdown in spending had not actually occurred. If a higher
(or lower) trend were assumed, the percentage spending
reduction explained by the model would decrease (or
increase).
We also explore the extent to which the Great Recession
versus other known characteristics appears responsible for the
recent decline in health care spending. To do so, we produce a
counterfactual level of per capita income in 2013 as if the Great
Recession had not occurred, and determine the level of pre-
dicted health care spending at that higher level of income. (We
essentially assume that the poverty rate and unemployment rate
returned to "natural" levels by 2013, but the recession caused a
sustained decline in income.) Specifically, we estimate that real
per capita income in 2013 would have been $48200 instead of
$45
400 (from continuing the observed 2000-2006 trend of a
1.1% real annual growth rate in per capita income for 2007-
2013 instead of the actual 0.2% real annual growth rate
observed). Based on the 0.51 income elasticity observed in the
1991-2009 model, this generates an estimate of $8215 for
expected health care spending in the absence of the Great
Recession (as shown in Table 4), which then suggests that the
likely permanent decline in real per capita income is responsi-
ble for 41% of the slowdown in health care spending, that is,
($8215 - $7963) / ($8566 - $7953). This, in turn, implies that
the other known characteristics in the model combined to
explain 57% of the predictable decline (to sum up to 98%). A
similar exercise using the 2000-2009 model's results suggest
that 42% of the slowed growth can be explained by the Great
Recession, whereas 32% of the slowed growth can be explained
by other known characteristics (to sum up to 73%).
Finally, we use the regression results from the "Results
for the Characteristics Associated With State Health Care
Spending" section to produce estimates of the likely increases
in personal health care spending associated with the ACA's
Medicaid expansions. To do so, we rely on projections of the
ACA's likely changes in health insurance coverage from the
Congressional Budget Office (CBO), supplemented with
insurance coverage data for Medicare and TRICARE from
the Current Population Survey. The first column of the top
panel of Table 5 shows CBO's recent estimates of insurance
coverage in 2019 if the ACA were not in effect, whereas the
second column of Table 5's top panel shows CBO's estimates
of insurance coverage in 2019 with the ACA in effect.32 For
instance, CBO estimates that after the ACA is fully imple-
mented, those who are uninsured will decrease from 14.7%
of the US population to 7.8% of the population, and that

those covered by Medicaid/CHIP will increase from 12.0%
of the population to 15.6% of the population.
The bottom panel of Table 5 shows the range in the likely
relationship between the Medicaid expansion with total health
care spending by applying the results from Table 2's models
for the 1991-2009 and 2000-2009 periods. (Recall that the
effect was smaller in magnitude for the 1991-2009 model rela-
tive to the 2000-2009 model.)Applying these relationships for
Medicaid/CHIP coverage to these CBO projections for
changes in insurance coverage generate these estimates of the
partial change in health care spending.Applying the 0.40 coef-
ficient for Medicaid/CHIP coverage in 2000-2009 to the 3.6
percentage point increase in Medicaid/CHIP coverage gives
the upper range estimate of a 1.4% increase in health care
spending, whereas applying the 0.16 coefficient gives the
lower range estimate of 0.6%. That is, the level of spending in
2019 is expected to be, averaging these two estimates, about
1.0% higher with the ACA's Medicaid expansions than it
would be without theACA's Medicaid expansions. Practically,
because CBO anticipates that insurance expansions will grad-
ually increase coverage from 2014 to 2019, this 1.0% increase
would be seen in slightly higher annual growth rates for health
care spending during the 2014-2019 period.
Conclusion
Using data from the CMS NHEA-S data series for 1991-
2009, we find that a number of state-level characteristics are
significantly associated with state personal health care
spending. These include real income, the percent in poverty,
the percent insured by Medicaid, HMO penetration, mal-
practice reform to joint and several rules, the number of phy-
sicians and hospitals, and the percent of the population
residing in nonmetropolitan areas. Our take is that the mag-
nitudes of these estimates are both mostly comparable
between the 1991-2009 and 2000-2009 models and generally
consistent with the literature (when it exists for a given
characteristic).
Although there is value to these estimates, in and of them-
selves, there are also interesting policy implications from
applying these findings to recent and anticipated health care
spending. Specifically, when comparing actual and counter-
factual spending in 2013 with the projected 2013 spending
from our 1991-2009 and 2000-2009 autoregressive models
using state-level variation in explanatory income, insurance,
and provider characteristics, we find that at least 70%, if not
all, of the recent slowdown in health care spending appears to
be explained by these predictable factors (although this find-
ing relies on the assumption made about the unobserved
growth in counterfactual spending). The most important one
of these factors appears to be the Great Recession's effect on
reduced real per capita income and the subsequent effect on
reduced health care spending, as about 41% of the recent
slowdown can be explained by these reductions in income.
Our findings are therefore consistent with other research that
finds that the recession's decline in income is a major influ-
ence on health care spending.3,8 Second, when applying our
regression model's estimates for the relationship between
Medicaid coverage and health care spending to the CBO's
projections of changes in Medicaid coverage resulting from
theACA's insurance expansions, we find that the level of total
health care spending in 2019 is likely to be about 1% higher
than it would have been in the absence of these expansions.

2000-2009 period. ACA = Affordable Care Act.
