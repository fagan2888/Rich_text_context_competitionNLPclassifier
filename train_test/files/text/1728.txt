INORGANIC ARSENIC IS HIGHLY TOXIC
and carcinogenic for humans.1,2
Millions of individuals worldwide
are exposed to drinking water con-
taminatedwithinorganicarsenicmainly
from natural mineral deposits.3 In the
United States, approximately 13 mil-
lion individuals live in areas with a con-
centration of inorganic arsenic in the
public water supply that exceeds 10
µg/L, which is the US Environmental
Protection Agency's standard for ar-
senic concentration in public water sys-
tems.4
Inorganic arsenic at relatively high
concentrations increased glucose and
insulin levels in animal models,5 de-
creased glucose uptake in insulin-
sensitive cells,6-8 and interfered with
transcription factors involved in insu-
lin signal transduction and insulin sen-
sitivity in vitro.8-11 In epidemiologic
studies from Taiwan, Bangladesh, and
Mexico, high chronic exposure to in-
organic arsenic in drinking water
(100 µg/L) was associated with dia-
betes.12-18 High chronic exposure to in-
organic arsenic in occupational set-
tings was also related to higher levels
of glycated hemoglobin, a marker of
blood glucose levels.19 However, the
effect of lower levels of exposure to in-
organic arsenic on diabetes risk is
largely unknown.20-23
In addition to inorganic arsenic,
humans are exposed to organic arsenic
compounds, such as arsenobetaine and
arsenosugars,mainlyfromseafood.24 The
biotransformation and toxicity of inor-
ganic and organic arsenic compounds
differ substantially.25 Inorganic arsenic
compounds (arsenite and arsenate) are
metabolized to methylarsonate and
dimethylarsinate and excreted in the
urine together with unchanged inor-
ganic arsenic.26 Arsenobetaine, an
organic arsenic compound, is excreted
unchanged in the urine and is consid-

Context High chronic exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water has been re-
lated to diabetes development, but the effect of exposure to low to moderate levels
of inorganic arsenic on diabetes risk is unknown. In contrast, arsenobetaine, an or-
ganic arsenic compound derived from seafood intake, is considered nontoxic.
Objective To investigate the association of arsenic exposure, as measured in urine,
with the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in a representative sample of US adults.
Design, Setting, and Participants Cross-sectional study in 788 adults aged
20 years or older who participated in the 2003-2004 National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) and had urine arsenic determinations.
Main Outcome Measure Prevalence of type 2 diabetes across intake of arsenic.
Results The median urine levels of total arsenic, dimethylarsinate, and arsenobeta-
ine were 7.1, 3.0, and 0.9 µg/L, respectively. The prevalence of type 2 diabetes was
7.7%. After adjustment for diabetes risk factors and markers of seafood intake, par-
ticipants with type 2 diabetes had a 26% higher level of total arsenic (95% confi-
dence interval [CI], 2.0%-56.0%) and a nonsignificant 10% higher level of dimeth-
ylarsinate (95% CI, -8.0% to 33.0%) than participants without type 2 diabetes, and
levels of arsenobetaine were similar to those of participants without type 2 diabetes.
After similar adjustment, the odds ratios for type 2 diabetes comparing participants at
the 80th vs the 20th percentiles were 3.58 for the level of total arsenic (95% CI, 1.18-
10.83), 1.57 for dimethylarsinate (95% CI, 0.89-2.76), and 0.69 for arsenobetaine
(95% CI, 0.33-1.48).
Conclusions After adjustment for biomarkers of seafood intake, total urine arsenic
was associated with increased prevalence of type 2 diabetes. This finding supports the
hypothesis that low levels of exposure to inorganic arsenic in drinking water, a wide-
spread exposure worldwide, may play a role in diabetes prevalence. Prospective stud-
ies in populations exposed to a range of inorganic arsenic levels are needed to estab-
lish whether this association is causal.

arsenobetainewithdiabeteshasnotbeen
evaluated in human studies.
The 2003-2004 National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) measured for the first time
total urine arsenic and urine arsenic
species in a representative sample of the
US population.28 Using these data, our
objective was to investigate the asso-
ciation of urine arsenic with the preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes and with the
levels of glycated hemoglobin in adult
NHANES 2003-2004 participants. Our
hypothesis was that exposure to inor-
ganic arsenic is a risk factor for diabe-
tes while exposure to organic arsenic
compounds is not.
METHODS
Study Population
NHANES 2003-2004, conducted by the
US National Center for Health Statis-
tics, used a complex multistage sam-
pling design to obtain a representative
sample of the civilian noninstitutional-
ized individuals within the US popula-
tion.29 The 2003-2004 NHANES study
protocols were approved by the institu-
tional review board of the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics. Oral and writ-
teninformedconsentwasobtainedfrom
all participants. The participation rate in
NHANES 2003-2004 interviews and
physical examinations was 76%. For ar-
senic measurements, NHANES 2003-
2004 randomly selected a one-third ran-
dom sample of study participants aged
6 years and older (n=2673).28 Among
1611 participants aged 20 years and
older (age threshold was set in accor-
dance with NHANES 2003-2004 ques-
tionnaires and questionnaire strategies
for adults and to meet our goal of evalu-
ating arsenic and type 2 diabetes in
adults), we selected 1027 participants
who had fasted 8 to 24 hours before ve-
nipuncture. We then excluded 38 preg-
nant women, 34 participants missing
total urine arsenic or urine arsenic spe-
cies, 24 participants without prior di-
agnosis of diabetes missing serum glu-
cose, 4 participants missing glycated
hemoglobin, 130 participants who re-
ported seafood intake in the past 24
hours, and 9 participants missing other
variablesofinterest,leavingatotalof788
participants for this study.
Urine Arsenic
Spot urine samples (urine samples
obtained at the time of the physical
examinations) for arsenic analysis were
collected in arsenic-free containers,
shipped on dry ice, stored frozen at
-70°C or lower, and analyzed within 3
weeks of collection.30 Urine collection
and storage materials were screened for
arseniccontaminationbeforeuse.28 Total
arsenic and arsenic species were mea-
sured at the Environmental Health Sci-
ences Laboratory of the National Cen-
ter for Environmental Health following
a standardized protocol.31 Total urine
arsenic levels (isotope mass 75) were
measured using inductively coupled
plasma dynamic reaction cell mass
spectrometry on a PerkinElmer ELAN
6100 DRCPLUS or ELAN DRC II ICP-MS
(PerkinElmer SCIEX, Concord, ON,
Canada).30 Thelimitofdetectionwas0.6
µg/L, and 1.5% of study participants
had total urine arsenic levels below the
limit of detection. National Institute
of Standards and Technology standard
reference material 2670 was used for
external calibration.30 The interassay
coefficients of variation for quality con-
trol­pooled samples analyzed through-
outthedurationofthesurveywere9.2%
and 19.4% for total urine arsenic lots
withmeanarseniclevelsof8.15µg/Land
4.07 µg/L, respectively.31
Urine arsenic species (arsenite, arse-
nate, methylarsonate, dimethylarsi-
nate, and arsenobetaine) were mea-
sured by inductively coupled plasma
dynamic reaction cell mass spectro-
metry using high-performance liquid
chromatography.32 The limits of detec-
tion for arsenite (1.2 µg/L), arsenate (1.0
µg/L), and methylarsonate (0.9 µg/L)
were too high for a population exposed
to low or moderate arsenic levels, and
96.1%, 93.5%, and 64.8% of sample par-
ticipants had arsenite, arsenate, and
methylarsonate levels below the limit of
detection, respectively. As a conse-
quence, arsenite, arsenate, and methyl-
arsonate levels were not used in our
analyses. The limits of detection for di-
methylarsinate and for arsenobetaine
were 1.7 and 0.4 µg/L, respectively. The
percent of study participants with lev-
els below the limit of detection were
14.5%fordimethylarsinateand32.2%for
arsenobetaine. The interassay coeffi-
cients of variation for quality control­
pooled samples with mean dimethylar-
sinate levels of 6.66 µg/L and mean
arsenobetainelevelsof4.87µg/Lwere7%
and 10%, respectively.32 For partici-
pants with total arsenic, dimethylarsi-
nate, or arsenobetaine levels below the
limit of detection, a level equal to the
limit of detection divided by the square
root of 2 was imputed.
Diabetes End Points
Serum glucose concentration was mea-
sured using a Beckman Synchron LX20
(Beckman Coulter Inc, Fullerton,
California).29 Prevalent type 2 diabe-
tes was defined as a fasting serum glu-
cose level of 126 mg/dL or greater, a
self-reported physician diagnosis of dia-
betes, or self-reported use of insulin or
oral hypoglycemic medication. The
number of participants with diabetes
was 93 (73 with a prior diagnosis). Gly-
cated hemoglobin was measured by a
boronate affinity high-performance liq-
uid chromatography system and con-
verted to A1C
levels.29
Other Variables
Questionnaire information included
sex, age, race, and ethnicity; educa-
tional, smoking, and alcohol consump-
tion status; and dietary recall inter-
views for the past 24 hours using an
automatedmultiplepassmethod.29 Race
and ethnicity were based on self-
report, which allowed for multiple op-
tions and were subsequently catego-
rized by the National Center for Health
Statistics as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, Mexican American,
other Hispanic, and other. Seafood in-
take in the 24 hours immediately pre-
ceding the interview was obtained from
the 24-hour dietary recall interview re-
sults and assigned based on US Depart-
ment of Agriculture food codes con-
taining fish or seafood as main dish or

in combination with other food items.33
Body mass index was calculated by di-
viding measured weight in kilograms
by measured height in meters squared.
Serum cotinine was measured by an iso-
tope-dilution­high-performance liq-
uid chromatography/atmospheric pres-
sure chemical ionization tandem mass
spectrometric method. Blood mercury
levels were measured using multiele-
ment quadrupole inductively coupled
plasma mass spectrometry technology
(PerkinElmer Instruments, Shelton,
Connecticut). A level equal to the limit
of detection divided by the square root
of 2 was imputed to those participants
with levels below the limit of detec-
tion for serum cotinine (18.3% below
0.015 ng/mL [SI conversion: multiply
by 5.675 for nmol/L]) or blood mer-
cury (8.0% below 0.2 µg/L [SI conver-
sion: multiply by 4.985 for nmol/L]).
Urine creatinine, used to account for
urine dilution in spot urine samples,
was determined using a Jaffe
´ rate reac-
tion measured with a CX3 analyzer
(Beckman Coulter Inc).
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were per-
formed using the survey package in R
version 2.4.1 (R Foundation for Statis-
tical Computing, Vienna, Austria) to ac-
count for the complex sampling de-
sign.Strata,primarysamplingunits,and
special sample weights for arsenic
analyses were used to obtain unbiased
point estimates and robust linearized
standard errors.28 The statistical sig-
nificance level was set at =.05. All sta-
tistical analyses were 2-sided.
Total arsenic, dimethylarsinate, and
arsenobetaine levels were right-skewed
andlog-transformedfortheanalyses.For
each arsenical, the ratio of geometric
meanarsenicconcentrationsandits95%
confidence interval (CI) in participants
with diabetes compared with partici-
pants without diabetes were estimated
using linear regression models on log-
transformedarseniclevels.Forriskanaly-
ses, logistic regression was used to esti-
mate the odds ratio (OR) of diabetes
comparing the 80th vs the 20th percen-
tile of each arsenical distribution and as-
suming a log-linear dose-response rela-
tionship with diabetes. To assess
nonlinear relationships, we estimated
ORs comparing tertiles 2 and 3 to the
lowest tertile of the arsenical distribu-
tion, as well as ORs based on restricted
quadratic splines with knots at the 5th,
50th, and 95th percentiles.
Although we restricted the analyses
to participants who did not report sea-
food intake in the past 24 hours, we
could not remove all the contribution of
organic arsenic exposure to total urine
arsenic--possibly due to complex me-
tabolism and excretion of organic ar-
seniccompounds,incompletedietaryre-
call of all seafood sources, and potential
presence of arsenobetaine and arseno-
sugars in unknown sources. We were
primarily interested in evaluating the re-
lationship of diabetes with exposure to
inorganic arsenic; therefore, our pri-
mary assessment of exposure was total
urine arsenic concentration adjusted for
objective biomarkers of seafood con-
sumption(arsenobetaineandbloodmer-
cury). Measures of other organic ar-
senic compounds derived from seafood,
such as arsenosugars, arsenolipids, and
their metabolites, are technically chal-
lenging and were not available.
Our linear and logistic regression
models for total urine arsenic concen-
trationsanddiabetesendpointswerefit-
ted with increasing degrees of adjust-
ment.First,weadjustedforsex,age,race
and ethnicity (known determinants of
diabetes that may be related to arsenic
exposure), and urine creatinine. Sec-
ond,eachmodelwasfurtheradjustedfor
education, body mass index, serum co-
tinine,anduseofantihypertensivemedi-
cation. This model represents the asso-
ciation of total arsenic exposure with
diabetes independent of the source but
adjusted for traditional diabetes risk fac-
tors. Third, each model was further ad-
justedforurinearsenobetaineandblood
mercury levels. This model provides es-
timates for the association of inorganic
arsenic not derived from seafood and for
arsenobetaine. Further adjustment for
smoking status and alcohol intake, as
well as exclusion of participants show-
ing levels below the limit of detection,
did not modify the observed associa-
tions (results not shown). We followed
similar analytical strategies to evaluate
therelationshipsofdimethylarsinateand
arsenobetaine with type 2 diabetes.
To evaluate the consistency of the
findings by participant characteris-
tics, we estimated the ratio of geomet-
ric mean total arsenic concentrations by
comparing participants with type 2 dia-
betes with participants without type 2
diabetes for subgroups defined by sex,
age, race and ethnicity, education, body
mass index, and smoking status.
RESULTS
The median urine levels in the study
population were 7.1 µg/L for total ar-
senic, 3.0 µg/L for dimethylarsinate, and
0.9 µg/L for arsenobetaine (for SI con-
version from µg/L to µmol/L, multiply
by 0.0133; TABLE 1). After adjusting for
sex,age,race,andurinecreatinine,urine
levels of total arsenic, dimethylarsinate,
and arsenobetaine were substantially
higheramongparticipantscategorizedas
black,MexicanAmerican,andotherrace
orethnicityandinparticipantswithhigh
blood mercury levels. Total arsenic was
highly correlated with dimethylarsi-
nate (Pearson correlation coefficient for
log-transformed variables r=0.81) and
arsenobetaine (r=0.76), and moder-
ately correlated with blood mercury
(r=0.39). Dimethylarsinate was moder-
ately correlated with arsenobetaine
(r=0.46) and blood mercury (r=0.28).
Arsenobetaine and blood mercury were
also moderately correlated with one an-
other (r=0.48).
In models adjusted for sociodemo-
graphic and diabetes risk factors
(TABLE 2; models 1 and 2), partici-
pants with type 2 diabetes had similar
levels of total arsenic and dimethylar-
sinate, and lower levels of arsenobeta-
ine compared with participants with-
out type 2 diabetes. After adjustment
for urine arsenobetaine and blood mer-
cury, biomarkers of seafood intake, par-

markers of seafood intake, positive as-
sociations with increasing total ar-
senic were also evident in models based

COMMENT
In a representative sample of US adults,
increasing levels of total urine arsenic
were positively associated with type 2
diabetes prevalence and with levels of
glycated hemoglobin after adjustment
for diabetes risk factors and markers
of seafood intake. A nonsignificant
association was observed for urine di-
methylarsinate and no association was
observed for urine arsenobetaine. After
adjustment for objective biomarkers of
seafood intake, the main source of or-
ganic arsenicals, the association of total
urine arsenic with diabetes was progres-
sivewithnoobviousthreshold,andcon-
sistent for most population subgroups.
These results support our hypothesis
thatexposuretoinorganicarsenic,which
in this population was most likely de-

Lines represent adjusted odds ratios based on restricted quadratic splines for log-transformed arsenic concentrations with knots at 5th, 50th, and 95th percentiles. The
reference value was set at the 10th percentile of each arsenical distribution. Odds ratios were adjusted for sex, age, race and ethnicity, urine creatinine level, education,
body mass index (calculated as weight in kilograms divided by height in meters squared), serum cotinine and hypertension medication for model 2, and further adjusted
for arsenobetaine (except arsenobetaine model) and blood mercury for model 3. Bars represent the weighted histogram of each arsenical distribution. For urinary
arsenical distributions, 10 equally sized bins were selected from the 1st to the 99th percentiles of each log-transformed arsenical distribution except for dimethylarsi-
nate. For dimethylarsinate, 9 equally sized bins were selected to improve the shape of the histogram (many dimethylarsinate measurements were whole numbers).

for arsenosugars. Although we were un-
able to evaluate the relationship of ex-

arsenosugars and their metabolites are
either nontoxic or have very low toxic-
ity compared with inorganic arsenic.38
Inorganic Arsenic and Diabetes
Highlevelsofinorganicarsenicindrink-
ing water have been associated with in-
creased risk of type 2 diabetes in Tai-
wan, Bangladesh, and Mexico.12-14,18 In
a meta-analysis comparing extreme ar-
senic exposure categories (village drink-
ing water levels or living in a high- vs
low-arsenic area) in studies from Tai-
wan and Bangladesh, the pooled rela-
tive risk for diabetes was 2.52 (95% CI,
1.69-3.75).16 Inthesestudies,arsenicex-
posure was determined based on eco-
logicmeasuresofarsenicindrinkingwa-
ter, but no information on arsenic
exposure was available at the indi-
vidual level. In a case-control study in
Mexico, the OR for diabetes comparing
the highest tertile (104 µg/g creati-
nine) to the lowest tertile (64 µg/g cre-
atinine) of total urine arsenic concen-
trations was 2.84 (95% CI, 1.64-4.92).15
Since these studies were conducted in
populations exposed to high arsenic lev-
els and arsenic exposure was mostly as-
sessed ecologically, the implications for
diabetesinpopulationsexposedtolower
levels have been debated.16,40,41
Few studies have addressed the asso-
ciation of low or moderate exposure to
inorganic arsenic with diabetes risk.20-22
In 660 participants exposed to rela-
tively low arsenic levels in drinking wa-
ter in Central Taiwan, hair arsenic lev-
els were associated with elevated plasma
glucose levels and with the prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome.23 In Utah,
an ecologic study found no association
between arsenic levels in drinking wa-
ter and diabetes mortality after control-
ling only for age and sex.21 In a cross-
sectional study in Wisconsin, the age,
sex, body mass index, and smoking sta-
tus adjusted OR for self-reported diabe-
tes comparing participants with ar-
senic levels in drinking water between
2 and 10 µg/L and levels greater than 10
µg/L to participants with arsenic levels
in drinking water of less than 2 µg/L
were 1.35 (95% CI, 0.78-2.33) and 1.02
(95% CI, 0.49-2.15), respectively.20 Bio-
markers of arsenic exposure were not
measured in this study. In a small case-
control study in southern Spain, 38 par-
ticipants with diabetes had similar total
urinearsenicconcentrations(meanlevel
3.44 µg/L) compared with 49 control
participants (mean level 3.68 µg/L), but
the study was not adjusted for diabetes

risk factors or for markers of seafood
intake.22
The potential role of arsenic in dia-
betes development is supported by
experimental and mechanistic evi-
dence. Rats administered 1.7 mg/kg of
sodium arsenite by gavage for 90 days
had higher glucose and insulin levels,
lower glucose-to-insulin ratio, and
higherhomeostasismodelassessmentof
insulin resistance compared with con-
trol participants.5 Insulin synthesis and
secretion was impaired in pancreatic 
cells treated with arsenite 0.5 to 10 µmol
for 72 to 144 hours.42 In insulin-
sensitive cells exposed both to insulin
and arsenite, glucose uptake decreased
compared with insulin alone.6-8 Glu-
cose uptake was also inhibited in cells
exposed to methylarsonite for 4-hour
or 24-hour periods.6,8 Other potential
mechanisms include arsenic influence
on the expression of gene transcription
factors related to insulin signal trans-
duction,9,43,44 adipocyte differentiation,
and insulin sensitivity.8,10,11 Finally, ar-
senic could induce diabetes by nonspe-
cific mechanisms such as oxidative
stress, inflammation, or apoptosis,
mechanisms that have been related both
to arsenic exposure and diabetes devel-
opment.However,mostmechanisticex-
periments have been conducted at high-
arsenic concentrations and further
research is needed to establish the path-
ways potentially affected by arsenic at
lowandmoderatelevelsofexposure.Ex-
perimental evidence will also be essen-
tial to investigate important biological
questions on the role of arsenic in dia-
betes, such as the arsenic effect and me-
tabolism at the cellular level.6,8,45
Strengths and Limitations
Important strengths of this study in-
clude the use of a representative sample
of the general US population; the use
of urine arsenic, the biomarker recom-
mended by the US National Research
Council Subcommittee on Arsenic in
Drinking Water,2 to assess exposure; the
adjustment for relevant diabetes risk
factors and for biomarkers of seafood
intake; and the rigorous quality con-
trol of study procedures in NHANES.
While the public health and research
implications of this study are impor-
tant,somelimitationsmustalsobecon-
sidered. First, our analysis was limited
byarelativelysmallsamplesizebecause
NHANES 2003-2004 measured arsenic
in just a random third of survey par-
ticipants. Second, the study is cross-
sectionalandtemporalitybetweenurine
arsenic levels and diabetes develop-
ment cannot be completely ensured. It
is unknown if diabetes alters the excre-
tion and metabolism of arsenic. Pro-
spectiveepidemiologicstudiesinpopu-
lations exposed to a wide range of
inorganic arsenic are needed to con-
firm this association. Third, because of
itsrelativelyshorthalf-life,urinearsenic
may not reflect long-term exposure. In
the absence of public health interven-
tions, however, arsenic concentra-
tions in drinking water are relatively
stable over time,46-48 resulting in steady
urine arsenic levels. Indeed, repeated
urine samples in populations with low-
seafood intake have shown relatively
constant urine arsenic levels over time
reflecting ongoing chronic exposure to
inorganicarsenicfromdrinkingwater.49
Fourth, the high limits of detection for
arsenite, arsenate, and methylarsonate
(species that more readily reflect expo-
suretoinorganicarsenic),precludedthe
use of those species in the analyses. For
total arsenic, dimethylarsinate, and
arsenobetaine, the relatively high coef-
ficients of variation, limits of detec-
tion,orbothcouldhaveresultedinsub-
stantial misclassification and potential
underestimation of the associations.
Otherlimitationsincludetheuseofspot
urine samples and the need to adjust
forurinecreatininelevelstoaccountfor
urine dilution and the possibility of
residual confounding by geographical
location or by urbanization.
CONCLUSIONS
We found a positive association be-
tween total urine arsenic, likely reflect-
ing inorganic arsenic exposure from
drinkingwaterandfood,withthepreva-
lence of type 2 diabetes in a population
with low to moderate arsenic expo-
sure. Together with the experimental
and epidemiologic evidence support-
ing a diabetes effect for high levels of ar-
senic exposure, these findings rein-
force the need to evaluate the role of
inorganic arsenic in diabetes develop-
ment in high-quality prospective stud-
ies conducted in populations exposed to
a wide range of arsenic levels.
From a public health perspective,
confirmation of a role for arsenic in dia-
betes development would add to the
concerns posed by the carcinogenic,
cardiovascular, developmental, and re-
productive effects of inorganic arsenic
in drinking water,1,2,50,51 and could sub-
stantially modify risk assessment and
risk-benefit analyses estimating the con-
sequences of arsenic exposure. Given
widespread exposure to inorganic ar-
senic from drinking water worldwide,
elucidating the contribution of ar-
senic to the diabetes epidemic is a pub-
lic health research priority with poten-
tial implications for the prevention and
control of diabetes.
