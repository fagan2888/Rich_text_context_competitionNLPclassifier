Introduction
Translating existing instruments accurately is a challenge
for health researchers (Garcia-Castillo and Fetters, 2007;
Maneesriwongul and Dixon, 2004). When conducting
research in languages besides English, researchers often turn
to existing instruments for efficiency. It is potentially less
resource intensive to adapt an existing instrument with reli-
ability and validity evidence than to develop an entirely new
one. Researchers who make the decision to translate an exist-
ing instrument should consult carefully with cultural-content
experts regarding appropriateness of making such a decision,
and consider whether there are any compelling reasons for
expanding or creating a new instrument. Once an informed
decision has been made about the appropriateness of using
an existing instrument written originally in a different

Abstract
When using instruments written originally in a different language, the accuracy of translation is a crucial issue. The language and
cultural interpretations can be barriers to healthcare access. Despite the need for a robust translation process, the existing
literature offers little information about best practices for translation. Therefore, the purpose of this qualitative research was
to illustrate a systematic approach to developing an accurate translation. We describe the process of developing an accurate
and culturally relevant translation of the Connor­Davidson Resilience Scale (CD-RISC) from English to Arabic. The CD-
RISC is a healthcare instrument to measure resilience and comprises 25 items rated on a 5-point scale, with higher scores
reflecting increased resilience. Resilience is an important healthcare construct that can be applied to research on mental
illness and adaptation ability. For instance, increased resilience appears to protect against diminished mental health. The
translation process began as two individuals independently translated the CD-RISC into Arabic. A third person combined
the two translations to produce a reconciled version. A fourth individual then back-translated the reconciled Arabic version
to English. To resolve difficult-to-translate segments, the research team consulted with the instrument developer and then
conducted cognitive testing with six individuals. A cultural research methodologist participated throughout the process.
Among the 28 text segments in the CD-RISC (the title, instructions, scoring, and 25 items), the best equivalency in Arabic
came from eight segments of each forward-translation. The remaining 12 segments were similar. Each the back-translation
and cognitive testing contributed to seven revisions. The robust translation procedures detailed can be used by researchers
to develop best-quality translations.

language, the most critical issue is ensuring the accuracy of
translation. Although a number of techniques have been
described in the use of cross-cultural surveys, the quality of
many translations and methodological approaches is open to
criticism (Garcia-Castillo and Fetters, 2007; Maneesriwongul
and Dixon, 2004). For example, errors arise from differences
between cultures in the particular phenomenon being
assessed by the instrument, different versions (e.g. dialects)
of the target language that lead to misunderstanding among
respondents, and the modification of words in ways that are
no longer semantically equivalent. Methodological criti-
cisms include unclear procedures for translations and the
lack of appropriate testing of the translated instrument
(Maneesriwongul and Dixon, 2004).
Researchers have several available approaches for devel-
oping translations: forward-translation, back-translation, and
cognitive testing. In forward-translation, one or more lan-
guage experts translate an instrument to the target language.
With back-translation, one or more language experts trans-
late from the target language back to the original language to
check for discrepancies. Common variations of translation
include single translator forward-translation and back-trans-
lation by a second translator, and comparison of the back-
translation with the original document; this is an approach
that is well adopted by the World Health Organization
(WHO) to translate health-related instruments (WHO, 2016).
Another variation involves independent forward-translation
by two translators and reconciliation without back-transla-
tion. What remains unclear is whether there would be value
added by conducting independent forward-translation using
two translators, followed by reconciliation, and then com-
pleting back-translation.
Cognitive testing is a process to check the understanding
of the translated instrument by individuals representing
intended users of the instrument. DeVellis (2012) defines
cognitive testing as a qualitative approach for understanding
how potential respondents will interpret and understand
items. Broadly speaking, cognitive testing examines instruc-
tions, responses, and items (Sousa and Rojjanasrirat, 2011).
It can uncover problems related to language, comprehension,
and cultural relevance. Recent advances in translation proce-
dures have called for combining all of these approaches to
produce a comprehensive and accurate translation (Sousa
and Rojjanasrirat, 2011).
Although translation techniques have been described, less
is known about the pitfalls that may arise and how quality
checks can be employed throughout the process to address
these problems. In this article, we illustrate a qualitatively
driven approach to the translation of an instrument and dem-
onstrate how each step contributes to a best-quality transla-
tion. We discuss the details of using this comprehensive
process as applied to a specific resilience instrument, illus-
trate how different steps contribute to refinement of a trans-
lation, and present procedures to overcome conflicts that
arise. We discuss the critical role of a cross-cultural research
methodologist and checking the intended meaning with the
original author when discrepancy arises. In this example, we
were particularly fortunate to actively collaborate with the
original instrument's author throughout the process, but rec-
ognize that such an advantage will not always be possible.
The impetus for this study derived from our own interest
in research on acculturation in an Arab population of immi-
grants and refugees. The United States and Canada have wit-
nessed a continuous influx of refugees from Iraq and the
Middle East. In 2009 and 2010, Iraqi refugees were the most
common group of refugees in the United States and they
were third in 2011 (Martin and Yankay, 2014). The topic is
salient because increased resilience appears to protect against
diminished mental health. Refugees are not only more likely
to experience physical and mental health problems when
compared to the population generally (Kinzie et al., 2008;
Mills et al., 2008; Naeem et al., 2005; Ouimet et al., 2008;
Sabin et al., 2006; Stauffer et al., 2002), but they also face
language- and culture-related barriers in accessing health-
care (de Anstiss et al, 2009; Mizra et al., 2014; Morris et al.,
2009; Saadi et al., 2012; Saechao et al., 2012; Steel et al.,
2005). While effective acculturation appears to improve
access, diminished resilience may limit a refugee's ability to
effectively acculturate and integrate in their new society
(Almedom, 2008; Smith, 2009). Attending to a person's
resilience, therefore, may prove an effective leverage point
in facilitating acculturation and improving one's ability to
access needed health/mental health services.
While the definition of resilience has evolved over time,
the key components of resilience relate to a person's ability
to positively adapt to a changing or unpredictable environ-
ment and maintain or regain positive mental health while
facing or confronting adversity (Herrman et al., 2011).
Resilience can predict an individual's adaptation ability
(Herman, 2012; Smith, 2009; Thompson et al., 2011).
Measuring a person's resilience has important clinical utility:
it can help identify those struggling to adapt to a new envi-
ronment and inform interventions to alleviate stress, anxiety,
or depressive symptoms (Herman, 2012; Herrman et al.,
2011; Smith, 2009).
Few studies have explored resilience among Arab-
speaking individuals in the United States (Arnetz et al., 2013;
Morris et al., 2009; Saechao et al., 2012). As the number of
Arabic-speaking refugees is increasing, researchers need a
validated measure of resilience for the Arabic-speaking popu-
lation. We deemed the Connor­Davidson Resilience Scale
(CD-RISC-Arabic) to be a particularly good choice as it is a
widely utilized instrument available in many languages
(Connor and Davidson, 2003). The CD-RISC instrument has
been tested in many populations as well as different psychiat-
ric disorders and is well applicable to Arab-speaking individ-
uals who live in the United States (more information is
available at www.connordavidson-resiliencescale.com/about.
php). Given the widespread use across multiple linguistic and
cultural groups, the first author (bilingual investigator) and
Toma et al. 3
senior author (culture research methodologist) along with the
instrument developer reached the conclusion that developing
a resilience instrument de novo was not needed.An additional
advantage of focusing on the CD-RISC would be an ability to
compare our own results to the findings of researchers work-
ing with refugees who use other languages such as comparing
resilience scores of different populations and illnesses.
Cognizant of the lack of a detailed literature illustrating
translation procedures and detailed examples of the kinds of
challenges that emerge, we endeavored to fully document
methodologically our state-of-the-art procedure for transla-
tion while developing the CD-RISC-Arabic. The purpose of
this research is to demonstrate the qualitatively driven
approach for developing an accurate translation using the
example of our development of an Arabic version of the
CD-RISC resilience instrument. We clearly discuss the details
of this process using matrices with actual Arabic translations
and their English equivalents to illustrate what kinds of chal-
lenges can arise and a culturally informed approach for over-
coming these challenges.
Methods
Design
All translators are healthcare professionals who were born in
Arab-speaking countries. They live and work in the United
States at the time of translation was underway. After obtain-
ing the translation approval from the author, we used double,
independent forward-translation, reconciliation, and then
independent back-translation and reconciliation followed by
cognitive testing to develop a novel Arabic translation of the
CD-RISC. Two bilingual people, "forward translators 1
(director of community mental health center originally from
Syria) and 2 (an internist original from Sudan)," indepen-
dently forward translated the 28 segments of the CD-RISC
instrument into Arabic (title, instructions, scoring, and 25
items). A third bilingual person who is a family and geriatric
physician in the United States originally from Iraq (G.T., the
first author and the "bilingual investigator") combined the
two forward-translations to produce a reconciled version. He
also recorded the challenges and solutions that were dis-
cussed with culture research methodologist (M.D.F., senior
author). Then a fourth bilingual person, the "back translator"
who was a medical student in the US at the time of transla-
tion and originally from Palestine, back-translated the recon-
ciledArabic into English. The culture research methodologist
who is also a physician with wide experience in methodol-
ogy and linguistics and bilingual investigator then compared
the original English and the back-translated English, and
recorded any concerns with the back-translation. Together,
the research methodologist and bilingual investigator exam-
ined and resolved the identified differences. This project was
reviewed by the University of Michigan Human Subject
Review Committee and approved as exempt research.
Setting.The project team was based at the University of
Michigan in the midwestern United States. We collaborated
with Dr Jonathan Davidson who developed the CD-RISC
instrument for content-related questions, and Dr Hammad
from a community agency partner (ACCESS--Arab Com-
munity Center for Economic and Social Services) to develop
this translation. This research was conducted to support a
parent project on acculturation of Arabic refugees. The trans-
lation process started in June 2013 and was completed in
March 2014.
Instrument being translated. The CD-RISC is a tool compris-
ing 25 items rated on a 5-point scale (0­4), with higher scores
reflecting increased resilience. It has existing evidence of
reliability (coefficient =.89) and validity of scores (Connor
and Davidson, 2003). An exploratory factor analysis showed
that the CD-RISC has five distinct factors: personal compe-
tence, high standards, and tenacity; trust in one's instincts,
tolerance of negative affect, and strengthening effects of
stress; the positive acceptance of change and secure relation-
ships; control; and spiritual influences (Connor and David-
son, 2003).
Data collection and analysis of translation procedures.The
bilingual investigator kept meticulous records of all for-
ward-translation, reconciliation, and back-translation proce-
dures using tables to compare and analyze each of the 28
segments. The bilingual investigator was in close contact
with forward and backward translators to clarify any ambig-
uous issues. We recorded in tables all issues that arose, the
point in the process when the issues occurred, and how
problems were resolved. We examined patterns of the type
of issues that arose across all segments for both the forward-
and back-translation. Based on the similarities of solutions
of translation dilemmas (e.g. different word choice, making
it easy to understand, adding a word, and so on), these find-
ings were incorporated into Table 1 for forward-translation
procedures and Table 2 for back-translation procedures.
Roles of investigators were clearly defined in the process.
The bilingual investigator identified the concerns in the for-
ward-translation. In addition, the culture research method-
ologist guided the process on how to resolve the issues
identified. Table 1 categorizes the issues and solution types
(see Table 1). The cultural research methodologist played a
similar crucial role in organizing the data as represented in
columns in the Table 2. Due to copyright issues, only exam-
ples where translation concerns arose from the 28 segments
were presented in the tables.
Clarification of meaning with the instrument developer. For the
items we deemed ambiguous that could not be resolved with-
out clarification of the intent of the English meaning, the
bilingual investigator and the culture research methodologist
then discussed disputed items with the instrument developer
(Dr Davidson), and resolved these concerns based on a more

nuanced understanding of the intent of the English. The out-
come of this discussion was a reconciled, semi-final Arabic
translation edited by the bilingual investigator. As a final
step, the back translator developed English for the disputed
items from the semi-final Arabic translation. These specific
statements were then compared and approved by the investi-
gators for equivalence. That semi-final Arabic Instrument
was then subjected to cognitive testing.
Cognitive testing and analysis. We conducted cognitive testing
with six adults who were native Arabic-speaking individuals
to ensure the final version was understood by them as intended
(DeVellis, 2012). Their participation was voluntary and only
verbal consent was obtained. The participants in cognitive
testing, a combination of staff and clients, were randomly
selected from a community agency partner (ACCESS), which
has diverse Arabic-speaking clients. Participants' gender was
evenly distributed and included different levels of education.
Cognitive testing entailed the bilingual investigator adminis-
tering the instrument individually to each participant. With
each segment, the researcher paused and checked for under-
standing and whether any concerns arose. The cognitive test-
ing process involved an iterative analysis of each item to
check for understanding. If participants did not seem to inter-
pret the item the same way, the difference indicated a need to
clarify. If a participant did not understand, the researcher
rephrased the item and recorded the item for further analy-
sis--this only happened with the introduction. Based on their
feedback and analysis from the bilingual investigator and cul-
ture research methodologist, the finalized, fully reconciled
Arabic version was produced. For analytics, we tracked the
number and types of issues.
Results
Findings from independent forward-translation
There are 28 text segments in total on the CD-RISC: title,
instruction, scoring, and the 25 items.Among the 28 text seg-
ments, the bilingual investigator favored eight segments
from forward translator 1 for items 1, 4, 8, 11, 20, 21, 24, and
25, and eight segments from forward translator 2, specifi-
cally, title, instructions, and items 3, 5, 14, 16, 22, and 23.
Given the similarity of the forward-translation of both ver-
sions, we combined/integrated the remaining 12 segments,
specifically, scoring and items# 2, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12, 13, 15, 17,
18, and 19.
The forward-translation process, including the specific
translation and semantic equivalence concerns as well as res-
olution procedures, is summarized in Table 1.After reviewing
the two forward-translations, the bilingual investigators rec-
onciled each of the 28 segments of the instrument with con-
tinuous discussion of the forward translators. The results of
the translation with the feedback of the cultural research
methodologist were organized by item into Table 1. Then, we
used this table as tool for checking translation accuracy (final
forward-translation). There were five occurrences where
expanded wording was needed of a word difficult to translate,
for example, using an additional clarifying word as a modifier
or in case of using two words to capture nuance. There were
nine occurrences when a more natural expression was needed.
The solutions included the flow of the phrasing, and making
the language more colloquial. There were eight occurrences
where the final wording was nearly identical, but some inte-
gration was needed for the final phrasing. There were four
occurrences where a better literal match to the original
English was chosen. There were four occurrences when there
was a problem with the accuracy of a translated word (i.e. the
word choice). There were two occurrences (items 7 and 11)
where there were two necessary solutions (expanded wording
and need of more natural phrasing).
Independent back-translation and reconciliation
Table 2 explains the back-translation as well as the reconcili-
ation with the culture research methodologist and instrument
developer. Independent back-translation provided an addi-
tional check of semantic equivalence of the translation. The
introduction, scoring, and five items (#2, 6, 7, 11, and 24)
were modified based on the back-translation. The back-
translation found two sub-optimal items in the forward-
translation (scoring and introduction) and helped the word
choice (item #24) and finding the best literal match for four
items (using one word in items 2, 6, 7, and 11 instead of two).
Consultation with the instrument developer Dr Davidson
about the exact intent of the original English clarified the
introduction and three items (6, 21, and 24).
Cognitive testing and reconciliation
The cognitive testing through interviews with individuals
who would be similar to a target population in an actual
study using the instrument served as a final check of the
accuracy of both translation procedures. Saturation, the point
during data collection when no substantively different ideas
emerged, was attained after the six interviews. Based on
feedback with each of six individuals about each of the 28
segments, the final translation ended with seven revisions.
The introduction and five items were slightly modified to
make them easier to understand. There were two changes in
the introduction, one grammatical and one that involved
word choice. A word was added to three items (items 2, 7,
and 20) to clarify them further. There was one word choice
change (item 18) and one typographical correction (item 10).

crucial in order to produce a state-of-the art translation. This
research illustrates the value added by conducting independ-
ent forward-translation using two translators, followed by
reconciliation, and then back-translation. There were notable
differences in the independent forward-translations. Clearly,
the back-translation was valuable. The fact that semantic
equivalence was not achieved after forward-translation fur-
ther highlighted the importance of including a cultural expert
and conducting the independent back-translation. The cogni-
tive testing then further refined the instrument through testing
with participants representing the target audience.
Among the challenges the research team encountered
were developing a clear understanding of the intent of each
item in the original English version and summarizing the
resolution types by the investigators. In contrast to this
example, most authors who produce a second-language ver-
sion do not provide sufficient information to understand
translation procedures. We believe this may be due to several
reasons. First, researchers do not really have many venues
for making public details of their translations. Moreover,
making public the details could be seen as creating vulnera-
bility for the accuracy of the translation. Second, lead
researchers on projects, especially researchers who are
monolingual, may not understand the complexity of transla-
tion and may want simply a quick fix. There may be a naïve
understanding that there are natural equivalencies of con-
structs across languages.
This research thus raises questions about accuracy of
many translated instruments that have used less intense
translation procedures and the extent cultural context was
considered and accounted for by the translators. Challenges
are likely to arise when conducting any translation. Based on
this research, there are now clear illustrations of procedures
for addressing problems that arise during translation and
back-translation and how each problem can be solved.
A unique contribution of this discussion of translation
procedures is the role of a team regularly communicating
throughout the translation process. The periodic meetings
provided a format to address each challenge, and a team
approach to translation proved particularly useful by provid-
ing multiple perspectives to resolve discrepancies. By includ-
ing three individuals who conducted forward and backward
translation, each with a different Arabic dialect (Syrian,
Sudanese, and Palestinian) in addition to the bilingual inves-
tigator (Iraqi), we were able to identify problematic items
and ensure broader applicability to anArabic-speaking popu-
lation. As there are many Arabic dialects, they all share com-
mon official "broadcast" Arabic language. Therefore, having
extensive representation on the team from multiple nationali-
ties may be particularly important, especially if the intent is
to use the instrument with Arabic speakers of multiple
backgrounds.
Working with the original instrument developer ensured
the translation did not change the intended meaning of items.
As illustrated here, the original developer can assist with
word choice when the meaning of a particular item is in
question because the original developer is most familiar with
the construct being measured. Cognitive testing with the tar-
get audience can provide a rigorous qualitative method to
discuss each item and talk about understanding. Although it
yielded a relatively small number of corrections, the research
team strongly recommends cognitive testing as a final check
of translation accuracy and fluency. Finally, this research
explored the critical added value of review by a methodolo-
gist specializing in cultural research.
In our experience, most original instrument developers
appreciate other researchers developing their instrument into
other languages in order to extend the "reach" to other popu-
lations. Original instrument developers are most receptive
when the proposal includes details on using a best-quality
approach. This translation has been designated as the stand-
ard Arabic language translation by the tool's copyright
holder, Dr Jonathon Davidson.
This research illustrates that investigators face significant
costs when producing high-quality translations of instru-
ments, primarily due to human labor costs. In the research
team's consulting experiences with grant application devel-
opment, candidates often short-change the process, such as
when faced with tight budgets. Unfortunately, compromised
equivalency at the translation level could compromise con-
clusions drawn from comparison of results across groups
that have used different language translations of an instru-
ment. We advise budgeting adequately to use best-quality
translation practices.
The availability of the CD-RISC-Arabic instrument on
resilience is very timely for our own research and that of
others. The waves of refugees from the Middle East high-
light the need for researchers and human services organi-
zations to have a resilience instrument available, and its
potential use in a variety of applications for measuring
and monitoring adaptations to acculturation stress. The
research team hopes availability of the CD-RISC-Arabic
will enhance the resources for researchers engaged with
Arabic-speaking refugees and other populations. This
instrument can also be used by clinical psychologists
while assessing mental health of clients from Arab-
speaking countries.
With regard to potential study limitations, there were four
diverse bilingual individuals involved in this translation
(they were from different Arab countries with different dia-
lectics), but there were not any translators from NorthAfrican
countries. Using official "broadcast" Arabic language should
have adjusted for this issue. The cognitive testing was con-
ducted with six individuals. While no new issues were being
identified, we may have made minor changes if we had tested
the instrument on a larger number of subjects. Feedback
from those six subjects was constructive even though it
involved mostly minor changes.

Conclusion
In conclusion, this research illustrates detailed procedures for
developing a high-quality and accurate translation. Given the
changes that were incorporated based on having independent
forward-translations, back­translation, and cognitive testing,
we recommend this as a value-added endeavor meritorious of
pursuing and funding when conducting research requiring
adaptation of an instrument into a second language. In addi-
tion, engaging a cultural research methodologist overseeing
the process and conducting cognitive testing can help to
ensure that the instrument is not only accurate but also
remains culturally relevant. Regular communication of the
team is critical throughout the process. A natural extension of
this research is to conduct a validation study of the CD-RISC-
Arabic. Moreover, future methodological research should
continue to develop the systematic procedures to ensure a cul-
turally relevant and accurate translation. We anticipate
increased need for these procedures because of continued
global immigration, the increase in research conducted in
developing nations that do not yet have instruments available,
and the growing awareness of problems with simple forward-
or backward-translation procedures. The robust translation
procedures detailed here could be used by researchers in a
variety of fields to develop best-quality translations.
