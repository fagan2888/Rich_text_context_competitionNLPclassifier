Academics rarely agree and often struggle to find unanimity
on issues within their own disciplines, and yet, scholars of
organizational leadership and practitioners of leadership
development generally agree that leadership studies and
leader development are facing a crisis (Issa & Pick, 2010;
Kellerman, 2012; Walsh, Meyer, & Schoonhoven, 2006).
Popular perceptions of leaders and leadership, especially ethi-
cal expectations and the perceived trustworthiness of those in
positions of leadership, have unmistakably shifted since the
1960s toward disillusionment (Kellerman, 2012). Before the
1960s, leaders were perceived far more positively than after
the 1970s, and the whole strata of leadership and leadership
studies, despite the sea of changes that have occurred since
the 1960s and 1970s, have remained relatively unchanged
(Kellerman, 2012). This disenchantment, coupled with the all
too frequent news reports concerning unscrupulous leaders
and their actions, appear to have set the stage for a turning
point in the study, reflection, and development of leaders.
In The End of Leadership, Kellerman (2012) attempts to
identify and analyze the status of the leadership industry,
which Kellerman identifies as a "catchall term for the now
countless leadership centers, institutes, programs, courses,
seminars, workshops, experiences, trainers, books, blogs,
articles, websites, webinars, videos, conferences, consul-
tants, and coaches" (p. xiii). This is necessary because
while the leadership industry has been thriving--growing and
prospering beyond anyone's early imaginings--leaders by and
large are preforming poorly, worse in many ways than before,
miserably disappointing in any case to those among us who once
believed the experts held the keys to the kingdom. (Kellerman,
2012, p. xv)
A majority of the problem, in Kellerman's estimation, is mis-
taken assumptions. The End of Leadership is therefore an
attempt to identify the problems, diagnose and uncover
unhealthy assumptions, and prescribe a way forward.

Deconstructing The End of Leadership:
Postmodernity, Epistemology, and
Worldviews
Robert P. French II1
Abstract
The current article deconstructs Kellerman's The End of Leadership via postmodernity, epistemology, and worldviews. Despite
perceptively synthesizing and diagnosing a host of issues and assumptions that plague the leadership industry, Kellerman's
argument is flawed in two substantial, overlapping ways. First, the argument is decidedly grounded in modernity, despite
the obvious evidences of a postmodern critique. Second, although the impact of technology and culture are likely correctly
identified as significant, analysis explicating why these altered views about leaders facilitated a redistribution of power is
unattended to. Therefore, the current work argues that The End of Leadership compellingly diagnoses the condition of the
leadership industry via an incomplete lens. Therefore, three counterthemes are offered to compliment and nuance Kellerman's
argument: first, an understanding that technologies alter epistemologies; second, an analysis of the assumptions tethered to
the epistemologies of modernity; and third, that individual and collective worldviews have changed as a consequence of the
epistemological shift of postmodernity.

leadership realities within the historical streams of influen-
tial theories. The finished product serves as a call to reevalu-
ate and critically appraise many of the assumptions that
obfuscate the contemporary study of leadership and the
development of effective leaders by reorienting and engag-
ing the changes that have occurred. Kellerman astutely
observes that cultural changes, shifts in power from leaders
to followers, and technology have been the precipitating
causes for the recent changes in leadership. These observa-
tions and the overarching concepts, varied contexts, and his-
toricity of consequential leadership theories provide a
meta-analysis that should prove useful for scholars and prac-
titioners as they engage and encounter the realities so clearly
described. And yet the causes identified and the lens utilized
in this lucid narrative warrants further discussion.
Even though it appears Kellerman (2012) has fittingly
synthesized and diagnosed the climate and effects influenc-
ing the leadership industry, it would seem that this analysis
and the subsequent discussion are flawed in two substantial,
overlapping ways. First, the lens utilized is decidedly
grounded in the epistemological and ontological assump-
tions of modernity, despite the obvious evidences and glaring
realities of postmodern influences. Second, although the
impact of technology and culture are correctly identified as
factors, the discussion fails to interact with and discuss the
reasons these changes have influenced and continue to influ-
ence views about leaders and the redistribution of power.
Essentially, Kellerman analyzes and isolates present day
realities for leaders and their organizations correctly via an
incomplete or, at the very least, an underdeveloped lens.
This incomplete lens does not constitute a wrong analysis,
far from it; rather, it reveals and highlights underdeveloped
causal identifications. For example, technology itself did not
cause power to shift from leaders to followers; rather, tech-
nology, in this instance, transformed and transforms individ-
ual and collective worldviews, which has altered and
continues to alter conceptions of leadership and power.
Likewise, the epistemological and ontological assumptions of
modernity, which are the assumptions undergirding Western
universities, function as the presuppositions that color and
inform a majority of scholars and academic inquiries, includ-
ing, but certainly not limited to, Kellerman's (2012) critique
and analysis. What is missing from Kellerman's work is
threefold: first, an understanding of the epistemological shift
that was caused by a growing awareness of the other via tech-
nology; second, that individual and collective worldviews
inform the perceptions of both leaders and followers and that
such views have changed as a result of this epistemological
shift; and third, an analysis that acknowledges, at the very
least, its own tethering to the epistemologies of modernity.
Therefore, the theory of postmodernity as an epistemological
shift will be applied to Kellerman's analysis, assumptions,
and conclusions. To accomplish this, we first turn to the over-
arching narrative of Kellerman's synthesis and argument and
briefly discuss Kellerman's explicit assumptions and the
changes prescribed to right the leadership crisis. We then turn
our attention to postmodernity as an epistemological shift and
discuss in detail epistemological shifts and the effects on indi-
vidual and collective worldviews. From this framework,
implicit assumptions inherent to Kellerman's work are dis-
cussed in light of postmodern epistemology and a critique is
offered based upon the framework and suggestions set out as
remedies for the study of leadership. But first, let us begin
with an overview of The End of Leadership.
Overarching Narrative of Kellerman's
Argument
The End of Leadership tells "two tales," the first is about lead-
ership and change and the second is about the leadership
industry itself (Kellerman, 2012, p. xx). Both tales are rela-
tively well developed; however, for our purposes, we will
concentrate primarily on the former. A fairly insightful intro-
duction sets the stage for the book's relevance to the study of
leadership and assists the reader in conceptualizing the piece's
overall argument and organization. The introduction begins
with an identification of many of the issues that plague lead-
ership studies and the leadership industry, of which each are
quickly refuted and discussed in detail as her argument pro-
gresses. Primarily, the issues are mistaken assumptions, such
as conceptualizing leadership as static, that leadership can be
taught and taught to anyone quickly and easily, that context is
of secondary importance, and that leaders should be the cen-
tral focus as they are more crucial than followers. These
assumptions are refuted via the organization and development
of Kellerman's argument, which is grounded in her historiog-
raphy of leadership as trajectory. This trajectory presupposes
that "since the time of the Enlightenment, because of the
Enlightenment, the weak increasingly challenged the strong"
(p. xvii). And yet this assumption is held in tension with, and
not clearly delineated from, the identification that the 1960s
and 1970s accelerated such challenges and resulted in a far-
reaching, global redistribution of power in which the power
of leaders waned while the power of followers increased.
Although we will discuss these assumptions later, at this junc-
ture, it is essential to note that this forms the backbone of
Kellerman's argument. This historical trajectory identifies
two additional assumptions unattended to by the leadership
industry, namely, followers and cultural context.
Kellerman's (2012) historicity concerning the develop-
ment of leadership forms a foundation in which to build upon
the cultural and technological changes that significantly
affected leadership and perceptions concerning leadership.
These changes, although not fully explicated or carefully dis-
cussed in light of the wider academic literature available out-
side of the study of organizational leadership, suggest that
the leadership industry has been and is neglectfully compla-
cent concerning these changes and, in particular, the ways in
which culture and context have altered the balance of power
between leaders and followers.
French 3
What, then, can we conclude about the historical trajectory? We
can say what we have seen: that over the course of human
history, power and influence generally have devolved from the
top down. Still, for whatever reasons, the leadership industry
ignores this critical history nearly entirely, as if it were irrelevant,
or unimportant, or maybe both. One of the several inevitable
results is that leaders continue to be overvalued and followers
undervalued. The same can be said of the contemporary
context--which remains similarly underappreciated and poorly
understood. This deprivation serves no one, least of all those
learning how to lead. (p. 23)
A trenchant critique justifying an assertion posited in the
introduction that leaders, followers, and context should each
be conceived of as equally important. This reorientation
away from a leader-centric focus is a reoccurring theme
throughout The End of Leadership and is further bolstered
via discussions concerning the increased interconnectedness
of people globally and a shift in the social contract between
leaders and followers.
Kellerman (2012) utilizes the lens of evolutionary leader-
ship theory to demonstrate that the social contract between
leaders and followers has changed from self-interest to merit.
Again, according to Kellerman, this change occurred because
the assumptions on which the contract is based have changed,
first, because the old justifications for having power, authority,
and influence are no longer so persuasive, and second, because
people in the present think of themselves as more important,
more entitled, than did people in the past. (p. 70)
The consequence of which rendered followers more likely to
judge leaders upon two criteria: effectiveness and ethics.
These criteria and this change in social contract were has-
tened by technology, which further solidifies her argument
that the interconnectedness of a globally related world iden-
tifies another example of the leadership industry's failure to
adopt to this "new and changed social contract" (p. 149).
Quite simply, Kellerman's analysis is that the leadership
industry has failed to account for, interact with, and engage
these issues, which form the assumptions that "underpin the
leadership industry" (p. 190).
The Changes Prescribed to Right the Leadership
Crisis
Despite the failure of the leadership industry to recognize its
own myopic self-justification, Kellerman (2012) provides
several general correctives: developing a greater expertise as
it pertains to contextual intelligence, developing a global
focus with attention to global and local complexities,
employing a far more critical analysis of leadership studies
and leader development, and broadening education for both
leaders and followers that incorporates interdisciplinary
study. Certainly, these remedies would address the assump-
tions identified by Kellerman. A greater understanding and
engagement with contextualization would greatly lessen the
myopia of a field of study that fails to incorporate the numer-
ous overlaps in the humanities and may serve to guard
against self-serving study and application, including, but not
limited to, cultural influences. Expanding one's purview to a
global focus in the midst of the obvious sociological and
political changes that have occurred since the 1960s and
1970s should ensure, at the very least, a more effective
engagement with the issues and complexities that global
interconnectedness have spawned in the wake of an ever-
closing global village. Developing a willingness and tools to
critically analyze the leadership industry through contextual-
ization and a broader focus should enable useful analysis that
limits or, at the very least, challenges myopic tendencies.
And finally, providing interdisciplinary education that con-
siders the complexities and interactions of both leaders and
followers, as well as nuanced understandings of power and
context, would likely address many of the observations that
are identified as contributing to the leadership crisis.
These remedies, although seemingly appropriate and well
articulated, fail to adequately account for or identify the fac-
tors that precipitated the leadership crisis. Without identify-
ing and discussing the reasons for these effects, remedies
such as these remain untethered to the actual phenomena that
instigated the crisis. Certainly, Kellerman (2012) identifies
generalities, but her analysis and remedies fail to adequately
wrestle with and incorporate a framework that explicates the
cultural and technological changes that have spurned indi-
viduals toward a general distrust of their leaders and the rea-
sons why power has shifted from leaders to followers. It is to
this neglect that we now turn; to accomplish this, a momen-
tary diversion is needed to provide a foundational under-
standing of postmodernity, epistemology, and worldviews to
elucidate this study's interpretation and critique of
Kellerman's analysis and remedies.
The End of Leadership Through a
Postmodern Lens
Scholars from a variety of fields identify the 1960s and 1970s
as a significant watershed in the cultural and historical devel-
opment of the West. Cultural theorists from a plethora of dis-
ciplines attribute a variety of explanations for these changes,
but most frequently, postmodernity is conceptualized as the
consequence of the widespread disillusionment of the 1960s
and 1970s (Ahonen, 2010; Balia & Kim, 2011; Bosch, 1991;
Brown, 2000; Hiebert, 2008; Olsen & Ahlstrand, 2011;
Sørensen, 2007). The effects of this disillusionment are all
encompassing as postmodernity "is no marginal phenome-
non, not something happening on the fringe[s] of society;
rather, it is penetrating whole cultures, a paradigm shift con-
sciously and subconsciously transforming commonly
accepted habits, notions, and patterns of thoughts in its wake"
(Balia & Kim, 2011, p. 67). The reason this paradigm shift
consciously and subconsciously penetrates whole cultures is
4 SAGE Open
because postmodernity is best understood as an epistemologi-
cal shift affecting individual and collective worldviews
(French & Ehrman, 2016).
Postmodernity as an Epistemological Shift
Postmodernityisnotoriouslydifficulttodefine.Postmodernity
is often narrowly defined based exclusively upon postmodern
philosophers and theorists such as Jacques Derrida (decon-
struction), Michel Foucault (discourse analysis), Richard
Rorty (neopragmatism), Thomas Kuhn (paradigm theory),
and others who have attempted to "uncover the historical and
cultural relatively of knowledge, the hidden agendas of power
behind scientific discourses and tried to replace metaphysics
and ontology with linguistics and constructivism" (Walldorf,
2010, p. 6). Certainly, postcolonial criticism and postmodern
philosophies and theories have affected both the academy and
the wider public; however, it is unlikely that these are the sole
driving force of a paradigm shift that is consciously and sub-
consciously penetrating whole cultures. Rather, the wide-
spread disenchantment in response to the failed promises of
modernity more readily defines postmodernity as a reaction
against the assumptions and presuppositions inherent to
modernity (Balia & Kim, 2011; Bosch, 1991; Hiebert, 2008;
Iyadurai, 2010). To understand postmodernity then, one must
wrestle with this pervasive disillusionment concerning the
assumptions and presuppositions of modernity, that is,
epistemology.
Epistemology.Epistemology, generally, is "an account of
knowledge" (Moser, 2002, p. 3). Greco (1999) defines episte-
mology as the theory of knowledge, which is driven by two
main questions: "What is knowledge and how can we know,"
and "if we think we can know something, as nearly everyone
does, then a third main question arises: how do we know what
we know?" (p. 1). Epistemology is therefore a dynamic con-
cept because human beings have understood knowledge--
how it is identified, communicated, and justified--in different
ways at different times in history. Three eras of epistemology
are typically identified: premodern, modern, and postmodern
(Corfield, 2010). However, using the term "eras" requires
clarification. First, the following depictions are not without
bias. The author of this work has been shaped by many of the
explicit and implicit philosophic, historic, religious, and cul-
tural assumptions of the West. Therefore, the following dis-
cussion should not be conceived of as comprehensive
metanarrative of global history but rather as a narrative
shaped by Western, Eurocentric influence(s). Second, eras of
epistemology are not neatly divided epochs in which one era
ends and the next begins; rather, significant overlaps occur
(Corfield, 2010). The current work will therefore avoid estab-
lishing neatly divided epochs as there is little agreement con-
cerning the symbolic moments that mark the transition
between epistemological eras and assumes that premodern,
modern, and postmodern epistemologies informed and inform
individual and collective worldviews and that these influ-
ences are not uniform but affect individuals differently, in a
variety of ways, and continue to do so today.
The premodern era is often characterized as the time
before modernity in which the authority of rituals under-
girded the ways in which knowledge was identified, com-
municated, and justified.
Most people in the human past knew who and what they were,
not by precept or as a conclusion to an analytical discussion, but
by constant, daily experience and reinforcement. Social stability
and immobility combined (mostly) with relative geographical
rootedness to place to produce stable and, above all, unreflective
sense of selfhood. Indeed it was this which traditional religions
both celebrated and reinforced. Religious ritual tells you . . . who
you are and what it is that you are a part of, whilst investing the
whole with significance by rooting it in the transcendent.
(Pearse, 2005, p. 7)
The stability of one's identity through religious ritual would
be significantly challenged by the epistemological influences
of modernity (Pearse, 2005).
The modern era is often identified as beginning with the
Enlightenment, the industrial revolution, and European colo-
nialism and is characterized by "the belief in the power of
reason, progress, and the potential of the scientific method to
solve hitherto intractable human dilemmas" (Balia & Kim,
2011, p. 65). Knowledge could therefore "be obtained only
through reason, observation, and experiment," and once
known, it is applicable to all people as a metanarrative
(Patterson, 1983, p. 28).
Typical for modernity is the grand narrative, a project designed
to convince everyone of the truth of a particular vision or theory
about historical development, as for example the cases of the
Social Darwinist belief in the superiority of the white race [or]
the nation state as the sole legitimate foundation for a political
framework, Liberalism, Communism or Nazism as superior
political ideologies, Deism or Atheism as the most rational
worldview, or perhaps even the assumptions of some variations
of Christian mission that the Christian faith is the most advanced
creed and has produced the highest civilization so it needs to be
spread throughout the whole world. (Balia & Kim, 2011, p. 65)
Modernity, therefore, challenged the local authority of tradi-
tional religions to "liberate the individual from the oppres-
sion of family, church, and local custom [so] he would be
autonomous and free" (Colson & Pearcey, 1999, p. 104). So,
"where religion was not rejected entirely, ritual and personal
relationships were replaced by texts and ideas," which were
reinforced by the printed word (Pearse, 2005, p. 7).
Hiebert (2008) observes that "few transformations of
worldview have been as decisive and influential as that
which changed the religious worldview of traditional Europe
into the rational and secular worldview of modern Europe"
(p. 142). This transformation "from theocentrism to human-
ism is a Copernican revolution that radically changes the
French 5
way modern humans view the world" (p. 149). From this
Copernican revolution emerged the doctrines of liberty and
equality and the elevation of science as the sole arbiter of
truth. Education, therefore, is also elevated and serves as the
"most important legitimating agency of modernity" (p. 194),
in which utopia was attainable simply by "illuminating igno-
rance, removing errors and increasing knowledge" (p. 203).
Scientific domination of nature promised freedom from scarcity,
want, and the arbitrariness of calamities. The development of
rational forms of social organization and rational modes of
thought promised liberation from the irrationalities of myth,
religion, superstition, release from the arbitrary use of power as
well as the dark side of our natures. Only through such a project
could the universal, immutable qualities of all of humanity be
revealed. (Hiebert, 2008, p. 150)
In the beginning of the 1960s, there was an optimism that
development would right the wrongs of the world and that
science would prevail in making life better for all people.
According to Nash (1975), "the widespread trust in scientific
humanism" was "one of the striking features of the opening
years of the decade" (p. 16). Yet despite this widespread
trust, as the 1960s progressed, a crisis emerged.
The social, intellectual, religious crisis of the 1960s was specific
to no one particular religious tradition, nor to any one part of the
world. More widely still, it was not even a specifically religious
crisis, it was rather one of total culture, affecting many secular
institutions in a way comparable to its effect on the churches. It
was a crisis of the relevance (or capability for sheer survival) of
long-standing patterns of thought and institution of all sorts in a
time of intense, and rather self-conscious, modernization.
(Hastings, 1991, pp. 580-581)
This crisis of relevance of longstanding patterns of thought
and institution of all sorts is a crisis of epistemology, which
is demonstrated by developments within technology, travel,
and communications, the growing recognition of global plu-
rality and diversity, and the failure of science to solve human-
ity's problems.
Technology incited the social, intellectual, and religious
crisis of the 1960s. Advances in technology, communication,
and travel challenged epistemological frameworks in a vari-
ety of contexts. Brown (2000) identifies the wide-reaching
impact that technological and communicative changes had in
the 1960s:
International telecommunications, pioneered by the Telstar
satellite in 1963, was by 1967 providing same-day coverage of
the hippie "summer of love" in California. Between March and
August of the following year, it provided coverage of the major
political touchstones of the decade: the Prague Spring, the
Cultural Revolution in China, the May revolution in Paris and
other cities, and, from America, the Civil Rights movement, the
anti-Vietnam war movement and the Democratic Convention
riots in Chicago. (p. 178)
Numerous radio stations and "the vinyl record . . . displaced the
printed word as the key method by which young people formed
their own discursive world" (Brown, 2000, p. 178). It was this
"technology and the knowledge explosion [which] produced
facilities for communication which are among the most influ-
ential factors in the contemporary world" that caused "vast
developments in the organization, expression, and transmission
of knowledge" (Stowe, 1968, p. 147). Changes in technology
resulted in changes in the ways in which human beings orga-
nize, express, and transmit knowledge, which is, quite simply,
a shift of epistemology. Just as the printing press reinforced the
epistemological presuppositions of modernity, so did advances
in technology, travel, and communications reinforce the episte-
mological presuppositions of postmodernity.
Postman (1987), in his book Amusing Ourselves to Death,
identifies that technological developments change human
discourse and therefore alter epistemology. Postman
attempted "to show that definitions of truth are derived, at
least in part, from the character of the media of communica-
tion through which information is conveyed . . . [and] how
media are implicated in our epistemologies" (p. 17). Postman
convincingly argues that "most of our modern ideas about
the uses of the intellect were formed by the printed word, as
were our ideas about education, knowledge, truth, and infor-
mation" (p. 29). Surely, television, international telecommu-
nications sustained by satellites, the global availability of
transistor radios, and vinyl records corroborate Postman's
attempt to "show that in the twentieth century, our notions of
truth and our ideas of intelligence have changed as a result of
new media displacing the old" (p. 26).
Vast improvements in travel and communication further
challenged the epistemological boundaries of modernity by
facilitating opportunities for relationships and interactions
over vast distances. Individuals who traveled by jet airplane
or received information from radio and television were chal-
lenged by the sheer magnitude of global diversity. Up until
the 1960s, many intellectuals in the West, who were undoubt-
edly heavily influenced by modernity, advocated science as a
metanarrative. Nash (1975), in her discussion of the 1960s,
identifies "science as the most dynamic cultural force in the
world" (p. 19). But people became disenfranchised, for a
variety of reasons, with the failures of the scientific world-
view, that is, modern epistemology. Before the end of the
1970s, Derr (1977) observed,
The triumphalism of the scientific worldview has been badly
shaken in our time by unexpected ecological backlash, by the
destructive effects on traditional cultures, by awareness of the
food and resource shortages and their consequences for
development; and many people are newly aware that the sciences
do not by themselves provide a coherent picture of the human
future. (p. 123)
This new awareness that the sciences do not provide a coher-
ent picture of the human future is also evident in Bosch's
6 SAGE Open
(1991) observation that "since the `secular sixties' more and
more scholars have been writing on the resurgence of a tran-
scendent longing that is both open to spiritual insight and
critical of science as an adequate means of knowing"
(p. 476). The gross injustices of power and its use throughout
the world would also serve as "a great disillusionment" and
this distrust of authority and power becomes one of the defin-
ing features of postmodernity (Hastings, 1991, p. 515). The
modern epistemology that undergirded the emphasis on sci-
entific development would, in the end, prove untenable. It
was because of this disillusionment, the growing awareness
of global diversity, and the developments within technology
that postmodernity emerges in the 1960s.
The postmodern era is often associated with the 1960s
and is characterized by diversity and plurality. Bloom (1987),
in The Closing of the American Mind, identifies the emer-
gence of this challenge by simply stating that "Enlightenment
in America came close to breathing its last during the sixties"
(p. 314).
Some modern cultural theorists . . . argue that the 1960s was a
key decade in ending "the Enlightenment project" and modernity.
In its place, the era of postmodernity started to mature. Structural
"realities" of social class eroded, and there was a repudiation of
self-evident "truths" . . . a new skepticism about the science-
derived nature of "progress," and the disappearance of an agreed
"reality." Science, social science and Christianity were equally
victims in the making in the 1960s. (Brown, 2000, p. 176)
The reason that all were equally victims is because all faced
the new, and developing, epistemological challenge of post-
modernity. Unlike the boundaries and dichotomies prevalent
in modernity, postmodernity recognizes diversity and plural-
ity as normative and finds claims of universal truths, such as
metanarratives, unlikely. Metanarratives are associated with
their use in modernity as facets of power and control; there-
fore, postmodernity is often described by its rejection of the
metanarrative (Bosch, 1991; Hiebert, 2008; Kim &Anderson,
2011; Olsen & Ahlstrand, 2011; Siejk, 1999; Sørensen,
2007). Knowledge for the postmodern can come from a vari-
ety of sources, yetall sources are viewed with skepticism.
This is exacerbated by the recognition of and interaction with
global diversity, is reinforced by technology, and, as has
already been suggested, is indicative of an epistemological
shift that has been and is affecting individual and collective
worldviews.
Worldviews.Worldview is a particularly troublesome term
because of the liberty with which it is used in mass media,
popular culture, and various disciplines within the academy.
The origin of the term stems from the anthropological study of
diverse people groups globally. Hiebert (2008) observes that
"anthropologists empirically studied peoples around the world
and found deep but radically differing worldviews underlying
their cultures" (p. 14). Consequently, worldviews represent the
foundational presuppositions that inform individual and
collective understandings about reality and the ways in which
people see the world they live in. Sire (2004) clearly illustrates
the complexities and nuances of the term by defining world-
views as "a set of presuppositions (assumptions which may be
true, partially true or entirely false) which we hold (con-
sciously or subconsciously, consistently or inconsistently)
about the basic makeup of our world" (p. 19). Worldviews,
therefore, provide the plausibility structures to the ultimate
questions of life, validate cultural norms, help to integrate cul-
tural change, and provide reassurance that the world is as one
believes it to be (Hiebert, 2008). Although some disagreement
surrounds which worldview presuppositions are the most fun-
damental, scholars generally identify epistemology as particu-
larly significant (Hiebert, 2008; Sire, 2004). Perhaps it is not
surprising, then, that shifts of epistemology substantially affect
individual and collective worldviews and, consequently,
culture.
The three epistemological eras defined above, premodern,
modern, and postmodern, all demonstrate two substantial
shifts within individual and collective worldviews. The shift
from premodernity to modernity is widely regarded as "one
of the great worldview shifts in history" (Hiebert, 2008,
p. 17). Premodern worldviews are generally conceived of as
being geographically oriented to the local village in which
rituals and oral communication are justified by the religious
leader via the authority of the god(s). Modernity challenged
these assumptions via an epistemological shift, in large part,
due to the printing press, the reorientation of individuals to
the nation-state, the invention and use of caravel ships (ca.
1450), which were used by the Portuguese and Spanish to
travel to the west coast of Africa and the Americas, and a
reconceptualization of the social contract, based in no small
part to the "sea change" brought about by the work of Thomas
Hobbes in his reorientation "from those with power, to those
without, particularly regarding their right, our right, to life"
(Kellerman, 2012, p. 9). Modern worldviews are generally
conceived of as being geographically oriented to the nation-
state in which written and printed communication are justi-
fied by state officials, leaders, and/or scholars via the
authority of "facts" as identified by science, the university,
the nation-state, and/or an organization.
Postmodernity further challenged these assumptions via
another epistemological shift brought about by vast changes
in communication, including telephones, transistor radios,
television, satellite communication, and the Internet; a reori-
entation of individuals away from individualism and the insu-
larity of the nation-state to the interconnectedness of a global
community; advances in travel, most notably the jet aircraft
and the ever-increasing accessibility of air travel; and a fur-
ther reconceptualization of authority, based in no small part to
the failed promises of modernity (French & Ehrman, 2016).
Postmodern worldviews should be generally conceived of as
being geographically oriented to a myriad of diverse commu-
nities globally and locally, in which a plethora of electronic
and nonelectronic mediums are available and in which the
French 7
individuals, and often their communities, justify knowledge
through a variability of authorities (e.g., state officials, lead-
ers, and scholars; but also relationships in community, social
media, personal feelings, experience, and spiritual experi-
ence). The epistemology informing a postmodern worldview
assumes that knowledge is subjective, that it may or may not
apply to all people, and that knowledge and the nature of its
communication and justification are a mechanism of power
and are generally distrustful of authorities and the sources
that modernity recognized as authoritative, that is, state offi-
cials, leaders of all types, and scholars. This epistemological
shift from modernity to postmodernity is all encompassing
and has influenced and informed individual and collective
worldviews in varying degrees globally (French & Ehrman,
2016). It is this shift that the technological and cultural
changes of the 1960s and 1970s witnessed, and it is through
conceptualizing postmodernity as an epistemological shift
that Kellerman's assumptions and remedies are found to be
insightful but incomplete.
Kellerman's Assumptions, Critiques, and
Postmodernity
Kellerman (2012), to her credit, correctly identifies aspects
of these changes. First, technology is identified as monu-
mentally important in the crisis of leadership via a brief dis-
cussion concerning the printing press, the disillusionment of
the 1960s and 1970s, and the technologies emerging from
this time period. Second, there is recognition that cultural
changes and technology have affected cultures globally,
which is closely related to a third identification that these
effects are related and therefore demonstrate a multicultural
historical and sociopolitical development. And finally, that
education is the answer to the issues that face both the leader-
ship industry and the study of organizational leadership.
Assumption 1--Technology caused the disempowerment of
leaders. There is little doubt that changes in individual and
collective worldviews reconceptualized the authority in
which knowledge is justified. Before the 1960s and 1970s,
the epistemological presuppositions of modernity elevated
state officials, leaders, and scholars as the authorities of
knowledge. Certainly, technology challenged and provided a
framework for an epistemological shift. However, it was the
multiplicity of changes, cultural shifts, increased global
interactions and recognition of interconnectedness, and the
general disillusionment with the promises of modernity that
altered worldviews globally. The totality of these influences
created significant skepticism concerning the communica-
tion and justification of knowledge via a new awareness of
the power inherent to knowledge. This shift reconstituted
epistemological justification from state officials, leaders, and
scholars, again in large measure because of failed promises,
to the individual. Therefore, failing to identify these
influences, the epistemological shift that resulted, and the
effect it has and is having on individual and collective world-
views worldwide wrongly associates movements and
changes in various contexts globally as a linear trajectory
within the purview of development and progress from the
West.
Assumption 2--Evolutionary development.Kellerman (2012)
unabashedly conceives of the changes globally through the
theories of evolution, development, and progress both in the
historical trajectory of leadership and in her estimation of
global events as demonstrative of the leadership crisis. Such
an assumption is particularly evident throughout Kellerman's
discussion in Chapter 6 concerning the impact of global
change. Kellerman presupposes that "the trajectory of history
moves generally in a single direction: toward democratiza-
tion" (p. 147). This underlying assumption explains Keller-
man's uniform treatment of Russia and China in which both
are described as having "scant knowledge of democratic the-
ory and no experience with democratic practice" but, never-
theless, having "come very far very fast" (p. 128). Treatments
such as these fail to see the cultural nuances and complexities
that Kellerman herself later advocates as necessary for the
study of leadership and the development of leaders. Further-
more, this discussion, as well as Kellerman's general interac-
tion with many of the cultural contexts identified in Chapter
6, fails to adequately address a plethora of presuppositions
and intricacies that inform individual and collective world-
views and their unique historical and sociopolitical realities.
Kellerman (2012) fails to incorporate, interact with, or
discuss a variety of influences that likely influenced, if not
caused, the various movements and events occurring in a
variety of global contexts. Exemplifying this, Kellerman
suggests that the events of Europe in 1989 and of the Middle
East in 2011 constitute a pattern, a pattern demonstrating "a
link between past and present and between what happens in
one place and what happens in another" (p. 149). Certainly,
there is an interconnectedness to such events. But were the
causes and complexities of the upheavals in Europe similar
enough to the widespread protests in the Middle East to jus-
tify the idea of a historical trajectory in which development
is encompassed by the "arc of history?" (p. 149). Certainly
not. Rather, the events in the Middle East are complex and
unique as compared with the events occurring in many other
contexts. Certainly, religious presuppositions, such as the
Islamic belief of Dar-al-Islam, should be discussed as well
as the effects of decolonization (Shenk, 2003).
Nash (1975) clearly encapsulates the global effects of
decolonization, "in 1946 well over a third of the world's pop-
ulation was living in colonies ruled by western powers; but
between then and the end of the 1960s almost all of these
people attained political independence" (p. 236). These
changes had far-reaching consequences that substantially
influenced and influence the realities for leaders and
8 SAGE Open
followers as well as contextually nuanced understandings of
power and authority.
Patterns of authority were being upsetalike in the intellectual
realm, in the familial-communal and in the political.
Achievement of national if not of economic independence by
some six hundred million people in Asia, Africa and the
Caribbean brought to an end the old imperial-colonial era.
(p. 16)
Decolonization is but one example of the complexities and
nuances required when discussing leadership and follower-
ship,sociopoliticalrealities,andpowerglobally.Furthermore,
awareness of such realities should cast significant doubt on
the explicit or implicit claims that the world continues to
develop in a linear trajectory.
Assumption
3--These global changesconstitute moderniz-
ing. Modernity assumes a linear trajectory of development,
progress, and evolution. For example, despite recognizing
that Russia has not and most likely will not develop along the
same lines as the West, Kellerman (2012) suggests that "Rus-
sia's leaders are caught between modernity on the one
hand--including rising expectations and growing demands--
and chaos and repression on the other" (p. 130). Such a
dichotomous assumption fails to account for the vast reac-
tions against the assumptions of modernity and the emic per-
spectives by scholars in non-Western contexts who identify
the presence of premodern and postmodern assumptions and
the absence of modernity (Li, 2010). Simply, the assump-
tions inherent to modernity fail to adequately interact with
the numerous complexities and histories that a diverse,
global account necessitates. Postmodernity, however, refuses
to conceive of either past or present realities as stemming
from one center; rather, postmodernity is polycentric, recog-
nizing a multiplicity of origins and the variability of direc-
tions in both local and global contexts (Olsen & Ahlstrand,
2011, p. 225).
Assumption 4--Education is the answer.Wrestling with the
innumerable nuances and complexities of a globally inter-
connected world necessitates a multidisciplinary incorpora-
tion of emic and etic perspectives from scholars from a
variety of contexts and specialties. As noted earlier, the uni-
versity is the primary legitimizing agency of modernity, and
it, like the leadership industry, is experiencing, or at the very
least being challenged by, the epistemological shift from
modernity to postmodernity. The assumptions of modernity
have led to an "epistemological diminution that reduces
knowledge to scientific knowledge, in this way forgetting
that at the core of knowledge we do not find the `experiment'
but the totality of human experience" (Kim & Anderson,
2011, p. 233). Such assumptions have increasingly been
challenged as the additions of qualitative and mixed-method
research methodologies demonstrate. Furthermore, as our
previous quotations suggest, the sciences, social sciences,
and humanities all have been challenged by this epistemo-
logical shift. This change of epistemology has challenged the
fragmentary nature of the academy and its long-held empha-
sis of specialization while neglecting, either intentionally or
unintentionally, collaboration with other disciplines. As a
result, calls for interdisciplinary collaboration have increased
globally throughout the academy. Educators, not unlike those
within the leadership industry, must examine, confront, and
critically appraise their own assumptions and biases, as they
seek to engage the growing complexities of an intercon-
nected world.
Critique 1--Unexamined biases and assumptions.Kellerman's
(2012) work is thoroughly grounded in the assumptions and
presuppositions of modernity. Clearly, the historical devel-
opment and trajectory of leadership and political thought is
based upon and grounded in the evolutionary and develop-
mental assumptions of modernity, namely that human prog-
ress should alleviate unethical practices and ineffective
leaders. Modernity is notoriously ineffective at setting or
righting moral and ethical agendas. Hiebert (2008) discusses
this at length and suggests that one of the reasons for the cur-
rent crisis or disillusionment "is that modernity said little
about ethics and the purposes for which knowledge, scien-
tific or other, should and would be used" (p. 215). Further-
more, the assumption that leaders and experts warrant
authority is legitimized upon the epistemological assump-
tions of modernity and may help explain Kellerman's ten-
dency to seemingly lament the shift in power from leaders to
followers. And finally, Kellerman's interaction with and
explanation concerning multiple contexts globally is inher-
ently biased. To suggest that the democratizing trajectory of
human history or that contexts as unique as Russia are con-
fronted with modernity on one hand and chaos on the other is
nothing less than a reductionistic logic informed by the epis-
temological presuppositions and homogenizing metanarra-
tive of modernity.
Critique 2--Incorporating interdisciplinary sources.Kellerman's
work is filled with topics and areas of study that other aca-
demic disciplines have and continue to study extensively. In
fact, as may be observed from our discussion, the overarching
topic of disillusionment toward leaders can be examined
through a variety of disciplines. Incorporating academic works
from disciplines such as philosophy, religious studies, sociol-
ogy, and history in the areas of culture, cultural shifts, global-
ization, power, postcolonial studies, postmodernity, and
worldviews would have provided a more robust and reflective
picture of the many diverse sociopolitical and cultural realities
attempted by Kellerman. Much of the current work is there-
fore suspect from the first chapter to the conclusion as it lacks
the nuance and expertise in establishing the historical, cultural,
and global arguments that provide the framework for Keller-
man's overarching argument. Nevertheless, despite these
French 9
criticisms, The End of Leadership succeeds in its goal--the
call to overhaul the leadership industry and leadership
studies.
Conclusion
Kellerman (2012) should be commended for the extensive
scope The End of Leadership attempts to encapsulate into a
call for the leadership industry to change with the changing
times. It seems quite evident that this work is intended for an
audience beyond the academy, and yet, the presentation for
the causes of the changes needed falls short of adequately
describing the realities facing leaders, followers, and organi-
zations. The work's most admirable quality, the width and
breadth in the attempt to interact with 2,000 years of leader-
ship thought and global contexts to explain the last 30 to 40
years, is overshadowed by a lack of specificity and question-
able explanations concerning the global complexities and the
ways in which culture and technology influence leaders, fol-
lowers, and organizations. Finally, the unexamined assump-
tions and homogenizing application of theory neither
accounts for nor explains the polycentric and varied direc-
tionality the last 30 to 40 years warrant. Such a critique,
strangely enough, actually serves to validate a vast majority
of Kellerman's observations and call.
Indeed, a shift has occurred, and this paradigm shift is
pervasive, all encompassing and is affecting a myriad of cul-
tures in a multiplicity of ways. Furthermore, technology and
cultural shifts have played a role in the transfer of power
from leaders to followers, but this occurred in conjunction
with disillusionment and global awareness, which deeply
affected and affects individual and collective worldviews via
epistemology. Individuals may or may not think of them-
selves as more important: What is clear is that the individual,
by himself or herself or within the bounds of the community
identified by the individual, serves as the epistemological
authority. This identifies and reinforces Kellerman's clear
appraisal that recognition of and interaction with local,
regional, national, and international complexities are neces-
sary for the leadership industry to wrestle with and account
for. Education must include a multidisciplinary approach in
which leaders and followers learn from and incorporate
insights and knowledge outside of the leadership industry
with a special focus toward contextualization and culture.All
of this must be undergirded by a new willingness for critical
assessment, especially, but not limited to, potential assump-
tions that inhibit leaders, followers, and their organizations
from effective leadership.
Although The End of Leadership, in many respects, cor-
rectly identifies the path forward for the leadership indus-
try, Kellerman essentially fails to apply these observations
to her own work, in large part neglecting interdisciplinary
collaboration and critical analysis of her own biases and
assumptions. Furthermore, the issues, assumptions, and
remedies supplied to right the leadership industry are
essentially an identification of the effects of the epistemo-
logical shift of postmodernity. An understanding of this
epistemological shift, the growing awareness of the other
via technology, and disillusionment combined with the
recognition that individual and collective worldviews
inform and reinforce conceptions of power and identity
accentuate the necessity to understand and wrestle with the
complexities of 21st-century realities. These realities dem-
onstrate that the leadership industry must change with the
changing times, and to do so, it must examine its own
biases and assumptions; must learn and educate followers,
leaders, and organizations to critically analyze the com-
plexities of cultures and contexts globally and locally; and
must understand individual and collective worldviews to
engage the multifariousness of the epistemological shift of
postmodernity.

Author Biography
Robert P. French II (PhD candidate, organizational leadership,
Eastern University; MTh World Christianity, The University of
Edinburgh; MDiv Global and Contextual Studies, Evangelical
Theological Seminary) is particularly intrigued by the interaction
and negotiation of Christian expressions (and organizational cul-
tures) between Western, specifically American, and majority world
contexts as it pertains to leadership, cross-cultural communication,
and the ways in which leaders, organizations, and educators
exchange contextually informed hermeneutics, theologies or theo-
ries, narratives, and beliefs about praxis. Utilizing a humanities lens
in the study of organizations and leadership provides a fascinating
perspective for his scholarly attempts to interweave theory and
praxis.
