Cognition and Cognitive Change in Older Adults:
A Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Examination

General lifestyle activities were examined as a predictor of current cognition and cognitive change over a 6-year
interval in older adults. Participants were drawn from a population-based longitudinal study, and they completed
the Adelaide Activities Profile and a battery of tests measuring cognition and sensory functioning. Hierarchical
regression analyses revealed that, after sensory functioning was controlled for, activity was a significant predictor
of current levels of speed, picture naming, incidental recall, and verbal fluency, and of cognitive change in speed,
picture naming, and incidental recall. Commonality analyses demonstrated that activity accounted for a notable
amount of the total variance in cognition, and that there was prominent overlap in shared variance between
activity and age, and between sensory functioning and age. These findings suggest that engaging in general
lifestyle activities may help to promote successful cognitive aging.
THE cognitive reserve hypothesis suggests that there is
a developmental plasticity with regard to cognition,
whereby the cognitive functioning of older adults can be altered
within a limited range by environmental factors (Baltes, Reese,
& Lipsitt, 1980; Woodruff-Pak, 1993). One such environmental
factor that has received a large amount of research interest is an
engaged lifestyle. It has been proposed that older adults who
lead a more active lifestyle can promote their cognitive
functioning within the limits of their reserve capacity (Scarmeas
& Stern, 2003).
The majority of research in this area has focused on the effect
that engaging in physical, mental, or social activity has on the
cognitive functioning of older adults. Physical activity, as
measured by exercise participation or physiologically by aerobic
capacity, has been shown to benefit the cognitive functioning of
older adults (Pignatti, Rozzini & Trabucchi, 2002; Schuit,
Feskens, Launer, & Kromhout, 2001). Leading a cognitively
intense lifestyle, such as work or leisure time spent reading or
playing bridge, has also been shown as a good predictor of
cognitive functioning in old age (Pushkar Gold et al., 1995;
Schooler & Mulatu, 2001). Similarly, occupational cognitive
complexity has been shown to influence the intellectual
functioning of older workers (Schooler, Mulatu, & Oates,
1999). In addition, social activity in the form of increased social
networks and emotional support, as measured by the amount of
time engaged in social situations, has also been linked to higher
cognitive functioning (Seeman, Lusignolo, Albert, & Berkman,
2001). Further studies that have examined the combined effect
of physical, mental, and social activities, using self-reports and
informant reports of how often specific activities are engaged in,
have also demonstrated that declines in activity with increasing
age are reflected in declines in cognition in both a cross-
sectional and longitudinal context (Christensen et al., 1996;
Christensen & Mackinnon, 1993; Mackinnon, Christensen,
Hofer, Korten, & Jorm, 2003). These findings are further
supported by experimental research demonstrating that changes
in activity level are directly related to changes in cognitive
functioning in older adults, as has been demonstrated for
cognitive activity (Willis & Schaie, 1986) and physical activity
(Colcombe & Kramer, 2003).
Although the precise mechanisms of the relationships
between an engaged lifestyle and successful cognitive aging
are not clear, it has been suggested that physical activity may
benefit the cognitive functioning of older adults by improving
cerebral blood flow (Hall, Smith, & Keele, 2001). The cognitive
benefit derived in older age from a cognitively and socially
intense lifestyle is commonly explained within Schooler's
(1989) environmental complexity hypothesis. This suggests that
the enriched environment and cognitive complexity provided by
a cognitively or socially intense lifestyle can create more
dendritic branches and synaptic connections in the brain, as has
been shown for animals (Greenough, McDonald, Parnisari,
& Camel, 1986).
The direction of the causal relationship between activity
engagement and cognitive functioning in older adults was
recently debated by Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, and Dixon (1999),
Pushkar and colleagues (1999), and Hertzog, Hultsch, and
Dixon (1999). These researchers examined whether the re-
lationship between activity and intellectual functioning may be
better viewed in terms of how intellectual functioning influences
activity engagement. However, subsequent longitudinal re-
search suggests a reciprocal relationship between activity and
intellectual functioning, whereby cognitive functioning pro-
motes activity engagement and activity engagement simulta-
neously enhances cognitive functioning (Schooler et al., 1999;
Schooler & Mulatu, 2001).
Currently research within this field is tempered by in-
consistent findings in the literature. Although many researchers
have provided support for the engagement hypothesis, many
others have failed to detect a relationship between activity and
cognitive functioning in older adults. For example, Aartsen,
Smits, Tilburg, Knipscheer, and Deeg (2002) examined the
effect of the amount of self-reported engagement in social, ex-
periential, and developmental activities on immediate recall,

fluid intelligence, information processing, and scoring on the
Mini-Mental State Examination, but they failed to detect
a relationship. Similarly, Albert and colleagues (1995) found
no relation between strenuous physical activity and cognitive
functioning in a large sample of African Americans. It is
plausible that a contributing factor to these inconsistent findings
is the lack of a specific definition of what an active lifestyle is.
Typically, an active lifestyle has been measured by informant
ratings of activity engagement, physiological measures of cardio-
respiratory fitness, or self-reported amount of engagement in
specific types of activities (which is sometimes a factor of the
amount of effort required in these activities and can be measured
either currently or asked retrospectively in either a scale or time
of participation format). This makes it difficult to compare the
results of different research studies. Furthermore, vital activities
that influence cognition may be overlooked. Researchers com-
monly assess activity levels by examining how often older
adults engage in a restricted range of specific cognitive, phys-
ical, or social activities, thus providing an indication of how
specific activities influence cognition. For instance, Mackinnon
and associates (2003) examined six activities including reading
a newspaper, engaging in physical activity, being involved in
interests or hobbies, spending time sitting around without doing
very much, spending time in planned activities, and having
a daily nap. Measuring a restricted range of activities may under-
estimate the potential influence of activity because it creates
small interindividual variation and may overlook many activities
that older adults engage in. This is particularly important in the
current society, in which a vast amount of everyday activities,
beyond traditional reading and writing, are available to older
adults, such as paid and volunteer work.
Another important issue is the use of both cross-sectional and
longitudinal research designs. Longitudinal research is useful
for examining how activity influences cognitive performance
over time; however, because of financial and time constraints,
many studies in the cognitive aging field utilize a cross-sectional
methodology. The extent to which these two research designs
differentially influence findings is not yet clear. Therefore,
comparisons between cross-sectional and longitudinal findings
could usefully clarify the utility of these designs.
A further issue is whether confounding variables are
controlled for. In research, it is common for education and
socioeconomic status to be statistically controlled for, with the
rationale that these are factors known to influence cognition.
However, a key mediator that is often disregarded is sensory
functioning. Age-related changes in sensory functioning are
thought to indicate age-based changes in the central nervous
system, which are reflected in biological markers of aging such
as vision and hearing. This is also known as the common-cause
hypothesis (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997; Hofer, Berg & Era,
2003). Changes in sensory functioning are particularly impor-
tant in this field of research, as they influence both the capacity
to engage in activities by limiting functional capacity to perform
activities, and the cognitive functioning of older adults (Anstey
& Smith, 1999; Spirduso, 1995).
In the current study we sought to further examine the
relationship between an engaged lifestyle and the cognitive
functioning of older adults by addressing some of the
aforementioned issues. First, we examined the effect of an
engaged lifestyle on cognitive aging in terms of a generally
active lifestyle, rather than the effect of separate and specific
physical, mental, or social activities. The definition of
a generally active lifestyle that we use here covers activities
that many older adults have been demonstrated to regularly
engage in, and it encompasses activities that are based in the
physical, social, and mental domains. Using this broader
definition of a generally active lifestyle means that findings
from this research will be directly relevant to a broad range of
older adults rather than an exclusive subset. It also allows for an
examination of how engaging in a broad range of relatively
simple activities integral to daily functioning can influence
cognitive aging. Using a broader measure of activity, which
encompasses measures of routine events such as shopping,
doing housework, and caring for sick friends or relatives, as well
as traditionally measured activities such as participating in
volunteer work and going on outings, provides a more accurate
reflection of the daily activity level of older adults. We used the
Adelaide Activities Profile (AAP; Clark & Bond, 1995) as an
index of general lifestyle activities. The AAP is valuable in
examining the link between an active lifestyle and cognitive
performance, because it is specifically designed to measure the
type of activities engaged in by older adults and has been dem-
onstrated to be reliable and valid for the measurement of activity
level in community-dwelling older adults (Clark & Bond).
Second, in this study we examined the effect of a generally
active lifestyle on both current cognitive functioning (cross-
sectional) and on cognitive change over a 6-year interval (longi-
tudinal). This allows for a comparison of the effect of current
activity level on current cognitive functioning, and the effect of
previous activity level on cognitive change over a 6-year interval.
Third, we examined the relationship between general activity
and cognition after we controlled for the effects of sensory
functioning, which is known to influence both activity level and
cognitive functioning.
Specifically, our aims in the current study were to determine
the following: (a) whether general lifestyle activities influence
cognitive functioning after the influence of sensory function-
ing is controlled for, and (b) whether activity and sensory
functioning account for age-related variance in current cognition
and cognitive change. Our subsidiary aim was to examine the
relative contributions of age, activity, and sensory functioning to
the explained variance in cognition. We achieved these aims
by examining the Australian Longitudinal Study on Ageing
(ALSA) data set across two waves of data collected over a 6-
year interval. ALSA is a population-based study that examines
the psychological, medical, and demographic profile of older
adults residing in South Australia.
METHODS
Participants
We drew participants for the current study from the ALSA.
The initial sample consisted of 2,087 participants and was
constructed by means of the South Australian Electoral Roll
(see Andrews, Clark, & Luszez, 2002, for a more detailed
overview of the recruitment of participants). Currently, three
main waves of psychological data collection have taken place.
Additional cognitive measures central to this study were only
introduced at the second and third wave of data collection.
Therefore, we included only those participants who took part in

the second and third data-collection points in the present study.
This enabled us to examine data over a 6-year interval from the
second wave (Time 1) to the third wave (Time 2). We screened
for dementia by using the Mini-Mental State Examination
(MMSE; Folstein, Folstein, & Mc Hugh, 1975). We removed
participants with a score below the clinical cutoff from the
sample.
This provided a subsample of 755 participants, 57.4% of
whom were female. We evaluated the background character-
istics of self-rated health and premorbid intelligence. Partic-
ipants rated their general health on a 5-point scale from 1
(excellent) to 5 (poor). We assessed premorbid intelligence with
the revised version of the National Adult Reading Test (NART-
R; Blair & Spreen, 1989), which involved articulation of a list
of words that violate the phoneme­grapheme rules. The mean
age for participants at Time 1 was 77.44 (SD ¼ 5.51), and at
Time 2 it was 83.36 (SD ¼ 5.48). Self-rated health at Time 1
had a mean rating of 3.28 (SD ¼ 0.99), and at Time 2 it had
a mean rating of 3.14 (SD¼1.05). At Time 1, NART-R (errors)
had a mean score of 22.58 (SD ¼ 7.63), and at Time 2 the mean
score was 21.70 (SD ¼ 8.43). A series of paired-sampled t tests
revealed a significant change in health (t ¼ 4.78, p , .001) and
NART-R errors (t ¼ 3.86, p , .001) over time. We found the
small albeit significant change in NART-R scores to be
somewhat surprising, given that it is purported as a measure
of premorbid intelligence (Crawford, Deary, Starr, & Whalley,
2001). In addition, participants recorded the age at which they
discontinued their education from 1 (never went to school) to 7
(18 years or over). The median age at which participants
completed their schooling was a score of 3 (discontinued
schooling at 14 years of age), which is equivalent to completion
of primary schooling and midcompletion of secondary
schooling.
A comparison between the current subsample of individuals
and the noncontinuing participants on the main variables of
interest to the study revealed that the current sample performed
significantly higher on the cognitive outcome measures and
engaged in significantly more activities, although the differ-
ences were moderate. There were no significant differences in
self-rated health, education, or NART-R errors.
Measures
Level of activity. --We used the AAP (Clark & Bond, 1995)
as a measure of general activity level. The AAP provides
a wide-ranging profile of the lifestyle activities of older adults
by measuring people's behavior and physical capacity to carry
out a number of daily tasks. The AAP consists of 21 questions
that deal with how often a person completes certain activities
integral to daily functioning within a typical 3-month period.
Participants respond on a 4-point scale of 0 to 3 to indicate
increasing frequency of activity. These response scales were
tailored to individual activities based on the likely frequency of
each activity in order to overcome possible polarized or skewed
distributions. On the basis of a principal component analysis
conducted by Clark and Bond, the AAP questions were
grouped into four distinct categories: household maintenance
(seven items, e.g., gardening, car maintenance), domestic
chores (eight items, e.g., washing dishes, preparing a main
meal), social activities (four items, e.g., participating in outdoor
recreation or sports, participating at a club) and service to others
(five items, e.g., caring for other family members, doing
volunteer work). The principal component analysis demon-
strated that the four factors accounted for 43.55% of the total
variance. The scale construction process was calculated by
comparing the individuals in the original sample with those in
a validation sample, which demonstrated congruence between
the four factors of .94 to .99. The reliability coefficients of the
subscales were also shown to be good, ranging from .51 to .80.
Hence, the AAP has been demonstrated to be reliable and valid
for use in community-dwelling older adults as a measure of
lifestyle activities. For the purposes of the current study, we
standardized each subscale to a mean score of 50 with
a standard deviation of 20, as recommended for research
purposes by Clark and Bond.
Sensory functioning. --We used the biomarkers of auditory
acuity and visual acuity as measures of sensory function. By
measuring pure tone thresholds at 2000, 3000, and 4000 Hz in
each ear, we assessed auditory acuity. We used a standard
bracketing technique, and the final criterion was the average of
the thresholds achieved in the left and right ear at each
frequency, as measured in decibels. We measured corrected
distance visual acuity for each eye with a Snellen chart at
a distance of 3 m. We recorded the smallest line that
a participant read successfully with the left or right eye,
whereby at least half of the characters in the line were correctly
read. The final score was the logarithm of the smallest line
successfully read.
Cognitive Outcome Measures
Speed of processing. --We used the Digit Symbol Sub-
stitution test (DSST), a subtest of the Revised Wechsler Adult
Intelligence Scale (Wechsler, 1981), as a measure of speed of
processing. The DSST required participants to complete a series
of 93 digit­symbol substitutions. The final score was the
number of correctly substituted symbols completed within a
90-s period.
Picture naming. --We used an abbreviated version of the
Boston Naming Test (BNT; Mack, Freed, Williams, &
Henderson, 1992) as a measure of visual confrontation naming.
The BNT comprises 15 line sketches of common objects.
Participants were required to name the object illustrated in the
drawing. The final score was the number of items named
correctly without cues.
Verbal fluency. --We used the Excluded Letter Fluency Test
(Crawford, Bryan, Luszcz, Obonsawin, & Stewart, 2000) and
the Uses for Common Objects Test (Getzels & Jackson, 1962)
as measures of verbal fluency. The Excluded Letter Fluency
Task requires participants to articulate as many words as
possible that do not contain a specified letter. Two 60-s trials
were completed requiring participants to generate words not
containing the letters e and a. The Uses for Common Objects
Task requires individuals to construct novel uses for everyday
objects. Two 90-s trials were completed requiring participants to
generate as many novel and unique uses as they could for

a bottle and a paperclip. The final score for each test was the sum
of the correct responses achieved across the two trials.
Incidental recall. --We used two measures of incidental
recall following the administration of the DSST and the BNT.
After the Digit Symbol Substitution test, participants were
asked to recall as many of the symbols as they could from the
previous task. Following the BNT, participants were required to
name any of the pictures that they could remember. The final
score for each task was the correct number of items recalled.
Procedure
During each wave, data collection was conducted in two main
phases. The initial phase comprised an interview in the
participants' own home, during which background information
was obtained and questionnaires, such as the MMSE and the
AAP, were completed. Approximately 2 weeks later, partic-
ipants were invited to complete the second phase of data
collection, which involved a clinical assessment interview,
during which the neuropsychological measures of cognition
were administered and the sensory functions were measured.
Statistical Analyses
We conducted hierarchical multiple regression analyses to
examine the contribution of a generally active lifestyle to (a)
current cognitive functioning using the Time 1 measures of
cognitive performance (cross-sectional analyses), and (b)
change in cognitive function over a 6-year interval (longitu-
dinal analyses) using residualized change scores of cognitive
performance. Following the regression analyses, we performed
commonality analyses to provide a clearer understanding of
the relative contributions of age, general lifestyle activities,
and sensory functioning to the explained variance in cog-
nition. During all analyses, we excluded missing data
pairwise.
RESULTS
Prior to analysis, we examined the data set for outliers. We
attenuated the influence of extreme univariate outliers, defined
as a case with a standardized score in excess of 3.29, by
assigning a raw score to those cases that were one unit above
the next most extreme case, as recommended by Tabachnick
and Fidell (2001). This successfully reduced the influence of
outliers.
Descriptive and inferential statistics for the subscales of the
AAP, the raw scores for measures of sensory functioning, and
the raw scores for each cognitive outcome measure at Time 1
and Time 2 are presented in Table 1. We performed a series of
paired sample t tests to determine changes in these measures
with time. There were significant differences between the mean
scores for each measure, indicating a decrease in engagement in
activities and performance on tests of cognitive functioning
across time, with the exception of social activity, which in-
creased with time.
We created composite scores for variables with more than
one measure to avoid overmodeling of the data in regression
analyses. From the average of the standardized scores of each
measure, we calculated these scores for sensory functioning,
verbal fluency, incidental recall, and the AAP.
Prior to regression analyses, we conducted a series of
Pearson product moment correlations between age, activity,
sensory functioning, and cognitive outcome measures at Time 1
and Time 2. The correlation coefficients are presented in Table
2. In accordance with our expectations, age and activity were
significantly correlated with each cognitive measure at Time 1
and at Time 2. Sensory functioning at each wave also showed
a significant correlation with each cognitive measure at Time 1
and Time 2.
On the basis of these correlations, we performed a series of
hierarchical multiple regression analyses to determine if activity
continued to contribute to the variance in each cognitive
function after we statistically controlled for the influence of

sensory functioning in a cross-sectional and longitudinal
context and if activity and sensory functioning reduced the
contribution of age to nonsignificance. We present the
regression analyses separately for the cross-sectional and
longitudinal examinations; these analyses are followed by
commonality analyses to partition the variance in each
cognitive outcome measure.
Cross-Sectional Analyses
We carried out one three-step hierarchical model for each
cognitive outcome measure. We devised the model to allow an
examination of (a) whether current activity influences current
cognition, beyond the influence attributable to current sensory
functioning, by testing if activity was a predictor of cognitive
functioning after we statistically controlled for the influence of
sensory functioning; and (b) whether activity and sensory
functioning account for age-related cognitive ability, by testing
if age was a predictor of cognitive functioning after we con-
trolled for the variance attributable to sensory functioning and
activity. In the model, we entered sensory functioning(T1)
at Step
1, followed by activity(T1)
at Step 2 and age at Step 3. The results
are presented in Table 3.
The regression models demonstrate that sensory functioning
was a good predictor of current cognition, particularly for speed
of processing. In relation to our first aim, current activity
contributed significantly to the variance in all indicators of
current cognition after we controlled for the influence of
sensory functioning. Activity contributed a 4% increase in total
variance explained for speed of processing, 3% for picture
naming, 4% for incidental recall, and 5% for verbal fluency. In
relation to our second aim, prior entry of activity and sensory
functioning did not reduce the contribution of age to a non-
significant amount, suggesting that additional variables are also
responsible for age-related declines in cognitive functioning.
We then conducted a commonality analysis (Pedazhur, 1982)
to partition the variance in each cognitive outcome measure that
is unique and shared among the predictors of activity, sensory
functioning, and age. The results are presented in Table 4. The
unique variance attributable to each of the predictors was small.
The amount of shared variance between age and activity and
between age and sensory functioning was substantially larger
than the shared variance between sensory functioning and
activity. Age accounted for the largest amount of total variance
in cognition. For speed of processing and picture naming, this
was followed by sensory functioning and then activity, whereas
this order was reversed for incidental recall and verbal fluency.
Importantly, the total variance accounted for by activity was
notable, ranging from 5% to 14%.
Longitudinal Analyses
We conducted longitudinal analyses by using a similar three-
step hierarchical model as for the cross-sectional analyses. We
entered sensory functioning at Step 1, followed by activity(T1)
at
Step 2 and age at Step 3. We entered sensory functioning as
a residualized change score, which we derived from the actual
value of sensory functioning at Time 2 minus the value pre-
dicted by the regression equation, using Time 1 as a predictor for
each case, as recommended by Menard (1991). We did this to
control for the influence of sensory functioning on activity and
cognition at both time points. We also examined cognitive
change by using a residualized change score of cognition as the
outcome measure. We selected residualized scores of cognition
over an absolute difference score because of the wide variance
in age-related declines in cognition in older adults. The results
are presented in Table 5.
The regression models demonstrate that sensory functioning
only accounted for a moderate amount of variance in cognitive
change scores for picture naming and verbal fluency and did not
make a significant contribution to speed of processing or in-
cidental recall. In relation to our first aim, activity contributed
significantly to the variance in change scores for speed of
processing, picture naming, and incidental recall, after we
controlled for the influence of sensory functioning, but it made
no significant contribution to change scores for verbal fluency.
Activity contributed a 1% increase in total variance explained
for speed of processing, 3% for picture naming, and 3% for
incidental recall. In relation to our second aim, prior entry of

LIFESTYLE ACTIVITIES AND COGNITIVE AGING P117
activity and sensory functioning reduced the contribution of age
to a nonsignificant amount for picture naming, whereas sensory
functioning alone reduced the contribution of age to non-
significance for verbal fluency. Age remained a significant,
although moderate, predictor of speed of processing and
incidental recall, after prior entry of sensory functioning and
activity. This suggests that, in combination, sensory functioning
and activity account for a large portion of the age-related
variance in cognitive change for some cognitive measures.
We again conducted a commonality analysis to partition the
variance in cognitive change that is unique and shared among
the predictors of activity, sensory functioning, and age. The
results are presented in Table 6. The unique variance accounted
for by each of the predictors was marginal. Again, there were
relatively large amounts of shared variance between age and
activity, and between age and sensory functioning, in compar-
ison with the shared variance between sensory functioning and
activity. There was no consistency as to which predictor
accounted for the largest amount of total variance in cognition.
The total variance accounted for by all predictors was marginal.
DISCUSSION
In the present study we aimed to examine whether general
lifestyle activities contribute to current cognition and cognitive
change over a 6-year interval in a sample of older adults after
we controlled for the influence of sensory functioning, and
whether sensory functioning and activity accounted for age-
related declines in current cognition and cognitive change. We
extended the findings of previous research by (a) using an index
of general lifestyle activity rather than a restricted list of
specific activities, (b) using both a cross-sectional and longi-
tudinal design, and (c) controlling for the influence of sensory
functioning. In addition, we performed commonality analyses
to provide new information concerning the unique and shared
variance accounted for in cognition by age, activity, and sen-
sory functioning.
Cross-sectional regression analyses revealed that current
activity level accounted for a significant amount of variance in
current levels of speed of processing, picture naming, incidental
recall, and verbal fluency beyond the variance attributable to
sensory functioning. These results suggest that a generally active
lifestyle is associated with higher levels of current cognitive
functioning in older adults. These findings are in accordance
with previous cross-sectional studies (Christensen et al., 1996;
Christensen & Mackinnon, 1993; Pignatti et al., 2002). Age
continued to predict cognitive functioning after we controlled
for activity and sensory functioning, suggesting that other
factors also influence the age-related variance in cognition.
Longitudinal regression analyses revealed that general
lifestyle activities were a significant predictor of change scores
for speed of processing, picture naming, and incidental recall,
after we controlled for sensory functioning, but not for verbal
fluency. This suggests that general lifestyle activities influence
some domains of cognitive change in older adults, although the
additional variance accounted for by activity was moderate.
These findings are consistent with previous longitudinal
research (Mackinnon et al., 2003). After we controlled for the
variance attributable to activity and sensory functioning, age no
longer made a significant contribution to change in picture
naming, and sensory functioning accounted for all of the age-
related variance in change in verbal fluency. In contrast, age
continued to contribute a significant, although negligible,
amount of variance in change in speed of processing and
incidental recall. This suggests that sensory functioning and
activity account for a worthy amount of the age-related variance
in cognitive change.
The observation that activity was not a unique predictor of
change in verbal fluency contradicts the cross-sectional findings,
which showed activity to be a unique predictor of each cognitive
outcome measure. Thus, although cross-sectional research is
important for identifying relationships between variables, lon-
gitudinal research is imperative for disentangling how variables
influence age-related changes in cognition.
Overall, these findings support the proposal that general
lifestyle activities make a significant contribution to both current
cognition and cognitive change in older adults. However, it

should be noted that a simultaneous reciprocal relationship
between activity and intellectual functioning may also exist
(Schooler et al., 1999; Schooler & Mulatu, 2001), such that
although cognitive functioning is influenced by activity engage-
ment, current activity engagement of the participants may
simultaneously be influenced by prior intellectual functioning.
However, examination of this possibility was beyond the scope
of the present study.
We chose the definition and measurement of general lifestyle
activity used herein to reflect a broad range of everyday activ-
ities in the physical, mental, and social domains, with the aim of
generalizing findings to the majority of older adults and allow-
ing an examination of how everyday activities can affect older
adults' cognitive functioning. The strength of the relationship
identified between activity and cognitive aging was similar to
the relationship found by Pushkar Gold and colleagues (1995),
who also used an encompassing measure of activity in
a longitudinal study. This suggests that broader measures of
activity may more adequately identify the extent to which
engaging in general lifestyle activities benefits older adults'
cognitive performance. However, Hultsch and associates (1999)
also used a more encompassing activity measure and failed to
provide convincing support for the influence of activity on
cognitive functioning. An examination of the participant sample
from the aforementioned studies reveals that both the study by
Pushkar Gold and colleagues and the study by us examined
a population-based sample of individuals with relatively low
education and health ratings, whereas the individuals in the
study by Hultsch and associates were healthier and more
educated. It is therefore plausible that although a broader
activity measure may be useful for detecting a relationship
between activity and cognitive functioning, this relationship is
greater in an average population-based sample than a healthier
and educationally superior one. Further research is required to
more fully examine this notion.
The commonality analyses revealed that the unique cognitive
variance attributable to age, activity, and sensory functioning
was moderate and that the largest portion of the total variance
was related to shared variance between age and activity and
between age and sensory functioning. This highlights the
importance of including measures of sensory functioning when
examining the relations between age, activity levels, and
cognition. The total variance attributable to activity was note-
worthy, which supports the proposal of activity as an important
predictor of cognition.
The finding that sensory functioning was a good predictor of
current cognition and a moderate predictor of cognitive change
is consistent with previous research (Anstey & Smith, 1999;
Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997). This finding adds further
support to the growing body of literature that attributes
a fundamental role to sensory functioning as a physiological
predictor of cognitive development across the life span, and it
again highlights the need to control for sensory functioning
when examining cognitive performance in older adults.
The large change experienced in cognitive functioning with
increasing age, as shown in the current study, is a common
finding in the cognitive aging literature (eg. Collie, Shafiz-
Antonacci, Maruff, Tyler, & Currie, 1999; Newson, Kemps, &
Luszcz, 2003; Salthouse, 1996). Hence, it is important to
identify the mechanisms by which cognitive skills can be
preserved, or even enhanced, in older age so as to develop
practical intervention strategies to combat age-related cognitive
decline. However, not all predictors of cognitive decline are
amenable to change. For example, older adults have minimal
control over declines in sensory functioning and health. By
contrast, they can readily modify their engagement in general
lifestyle activities. Thus, encouraging older adults to lead active
lifestyles offers a practicable strategy for promoting cognitive
functioning and enabling independent living to an older age.
Identifying techniques to enhance cognitive functioning in
older adults is all the more important, given the demographic
predictions of a burgeoning increase in the ratio of older to
younger adults in the near future.
