BACKGROUND: Few data have been published on the association of indices of body fat distribution and serum ferritin, an
indicator of body iron stores and putative risk factor for cardiovascular morbidity, in representative samples of total populations
or in Hispanic Americans.
OBJECTIVE: To describe the distributions of serum ferritin concentration and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) in Mexican American men
and to assess their association.
DESIGN: Cross-sectional survey of a large national sample, the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey.
PARTICIPANTS: Mexican American men aged 20 ± 49 y.
MEASUREMENTS: Body circumferences, skinfold thickness, height, weight, and serum ferritin and C-reactive protein
concentrations.
RESULTS: Mean serum ferritin increased between ages 20 and 29 but not between 30 and 49. WHR increased with age between
ages 20 and 49. WHR showed signi®cant positive associations with log serum ferritin concentration independent of age and
body mass index (BMI). The association was strongest at age 20 ± 29 y among those with BMI below the median. Associations
with other indices of body fat distribution and overall obesity are described.
CONCLUSION: Serum ferritin concentration is associated with WHR and other indices of body fat distribution and obesity.
Further research is needed to elucidate the mechanisms and signi®cance of these ®ndings.

Introduction
Few studies have examined the relationship of body iron
stores and indices of body fat distribution, despite the
relationship postulated for both variables with coronary
heart disease and ischemic stroke.1 ± 6 One study of Nor-
wegian men reported independent associations of serum
ferritin, the best serum indicator of body iron stores, with
waist-to-thigh ratio and body mass index (BMI).7 In a small
study of healthy volunteers, no association of serum ferritin
with waist-to-hip ratio (WHR) was found, although serum
ferritin was associated with insulin sensitivity among those
in the upper half of the ferritin distribution.8 Well estab-
lished are associations of body circumference measures and
skinfold measures of body fat distribution and fatness with
insulin sensitivity, non-insulin dependent diabetes, and
other cardiovascular risk factors of the insulin resistance
syndrome.4,9,10 In order to test the hypothesis that circum-
ference and skinfold indices of body fat distribution are
signi®cantly associated with body iron stores as indicated
by serum ferritin concentration independent of overall fat-
ness, gender, ethnicity, age or maturity level, data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) were examined. Mexican Americans were
selected for study because of the reported higher prevalence
of obesity, diabetes, and insulin resistance compared to non-
Hispanic white or black people.11 Serum ferritin levels were

similar in Hispanic and non-Hispanic white people in
NHANES II.12 The study was restricted to men to eliminate
confounding by gender, pregnancy, menopause, parity, oral
contraceptives or female hormone replacement therapy and
reduce possible confounding by iron de®ciency and iron
therapy. The study was restricted to persons older than 19
and younger than 50 y to reduce possible confounding by
growth and development, and chronic metabolic and
in¯ammatory diseases, such as Type II diabetes and arthritis,
common in the elderly.
Methods
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted in 1988 ± 1994 on a
nationwide multi-stage probability sample of approximately
40000 persons from the civilian, noninstitutionalized popu-
lation aged 2 months and over of the United States excluding
reservation lands of American Indians. Of these, 31311 were
examined. The descriptive analyses of serum ferritin concen-
tration and WHR in this report are restricted to 1416 Mex-
ican American men aged 20 ± 49 y examined with valid
serum ferritin, height, weight, waist and hip circumference
measurements in the survey. Numbers of persons in various
correlation and regression analyses that follow may vary
slightly due to differing numbers with missing values on
selected other variables. Details of the plan, sampling,
operation and response have been published as have
procedures used to obtain informed consent and to maintain
con®dentiality of information obtained.13,14
Demographic, medical history, and behavioral informa-
tion was collected prior to the examination by household
interview. Medical records of participants were not available.
Race and Mexican American ethnicity were determined by
self-report.13 Examinations were carried out in a mobile
examination center.
Blood samples were obtained at the examination center.
Blood in a red-top Vacutainer tube was allowed to stand for
45 min at room temperature to allow complete clotting and
clot retraction. Samples were centrifuged at 1500 Â g for 30
min at 4C. Samples were frozen at 720C. Ferritin in serum
was measured by the Division of Environmental Health
Laboratory Sciences, National Center for Environmental
Health, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, using
the Bio-Rad Laboratories' Quantimmune Ferritin IRMA kit
(Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA).15 This is a single-incu-
bation, two-site immunoradiometric assay (IRMA) based on
the general principles of assays as described elsewhere.15 ± 18
The reference range for the overall population was consid-
ered to be 10 ± 800 mgal; men with levels b 400 mgal are
considered to have elevated levels.19 C-reactive protein con-
centration, a marker of in¯ammation, was measured at the
Immunology Division of the University of Washington (Seat-
tle, Washington) with latex-enhanced nephelometry.15
Technicians measured height to the nearest 0.1 cm,
weight to the nearest 0.01 kg, triceps, subscapular, suprailiac
and mid-thigh skinfold thickness to the nearest 0.1 mm and
waist and buttocks circumference to the nearest 0.1 cm as
described in detail elsewhere.13,20,21 With the sample person
standing at minimal respiration, waist circumference was
measured in a horizontal plane at the level of the high
point of the iliac crest to the nearest 0.1 cm. This method
was chosen to maximize reproducibility.13,20 Hip circumfer-
ence was measured in a horizontal plane at the maximum
extension of the buttocks. Thigh circumference was mea-
sured at mid-thigh in a plane perpendicular to the long axis
of the thigh. The following were computed: waist-to-hip
circumference ratio (WHR), waist-to-thigh circumference
ratio (WTR), ratio of subscapular to triceps skinfold thickness
(SFR), central-peripheral skinfold ratio (CPR  (subscapular
skinfold  suprailiac skinfold)a(triceps skinfold  thigh skin-
fold); sum of the four skinfolds (SSF); and body mass index
(BMI  weightaheight2, kgam2). Extensive descriptive data
on height, weight, BMI and obesity prevalence as well as
serum ferritin in the NHANES III population are being
published elsewhere and will not be duplicated here.19,21
Statistical analysis.
The plan of the present analyses was as follows. Detailed
descriptive statistics and measures of association were com-
puted initially using unweighted data using the Statistical
Analysis System (SAS).22 Pearson partial correlation was used
to assess the association of the natural logarithm (LN) of
serum ferritin concentration with other variables controlling
for age or age and BMI.22 Correlation analysis results are
presented because of their familiarity, ease of interpretation
by a wide audience, and use in previous reports that may be
compared to the present one. Linear multivariate regression
analysis was used to develop models for predicting serum
ferritin.22 Only variables with prespeci®ed hypotheses were
entered into the regression models. Following these preli-
minary analyses, ®ndings of the unweighted analyses were
con®rmed using techniques that incorporated sampling
weights and design features of the survey.23 Population
estimates for means and percentiles of WHR were produced
using weighted SAS or SUDAAN procedures.24 Pearson corre-
lations of LN serum ferritin with other variables were con-
®rmed by SAS weighted analysis and statistical testing and
variance estimation were performed using the PROC
REGRESS procedure for linear regression models in the
SUDAAN system.22 ± 24
Results
Figure 1 shows the distribution of serum ferritin concentra-
tion by age. Mean levels are shown in Table 1. The distribu-
tion shifted towards higher levels between the third and
fourth decades of life with little further change in the ®fth
decade. LN serum ferritin was correlated with age overall and
at age 25 ± 29 y, but not within the fourth and ®fth decades
(Table 2). Figure 2 shows the distribution of WHR by age.

Mean levels are shown in Table 1. The distribution shifted
progressively towards higher levels between the third and
®fth decades of life.
Descriptive analyses of WTR, SFR, waist girth and BMI
revealed variation with age similar to that described for WHR
(not shown). CPR and SSF increased between the third and
fourth decades, but changed little between the fourth and
®fth decades (not shown). The distribution of WTR became
increasingly skewed towards higher values with increasing
age. Table 1 shows means by age for all these variables.
Table 2 shows weighted correlation coef®cients within
strata of age of LN serum ferritin concentration with the
four indices of body fat distribution (WHR, WTR, SFR and
CPR). In Mexican American men, the largest positive coef®-
cients for WHR were seen at age 20 ± 24 y (r  0.36), and the
smallest at age 40 ± 49 y (r  0.12). Coef®cients for skinfold
ratios were much smaller than those for circumference
ratios. Partial correlation coef®cients controlling for age
within strata gave virtually identical results (not shown).
Table 2 shows correlation coef®cients by age of log serum
ferritin concentration with measures of overall fatness or size
(waist circumference, hip circumference, SSF, BMI). In
Mexican American men, the positive coef®cients of waist
circumference, BMI and SSF were similar to those for WHR
below age 40, and larger than those for WHR above age 40.

Partial correlation coef®cients controlling for age within
strata gave virtually identical results (not shown).
Table 3 shows partial correlation coef®cients controlling
for BMI within strata of age for LN serum ferritin concentra-
tion with the four indices of body fat distribution (WHR,
WTR, SFR and CPR). Compared to unadjusted coef®cients,
the BMI-adjusted coef®cients for WHR and WTR were
reduced in magnitude by about half below age 40 and to
nearly zero at age 40 ± 49. Effects of adjustment for BMI were
inconsistent for SFR and CPR.
Linear regression models were ®t with LN ferritin as the
dependent variable and WHR as the exposure variable con-
trolling for age, BMI, age Â BMI, WHR Â age, and WHR Â BMI
to determine whether WHR was signi®cantly associated with
ferritin independent of overall fatness and age. In the full
model with all the above terms, each term including WHR
was found to be statistically signi®cant, indicating an inde-
pendent effect of WHR (P  0.001) on serum ferritin and
signi®cant effect modi®cation by age and BMI. Table 4 shows
the change in the mean value of LN serum ferritin for a one-
unit change in WHR at various levels of effect modi®ers age
and BMI. The positive change in LN serum ferritin was
largest at age 25 y with BMI at 24.6 kgam2, but change was
negligible at age 45 at both higher and lower BMI for age
40 ± 49. Thus, the effect of WHR on serum ferritin declined
with increasing age and BMI.
Discussion
WHR, WTR, SFR and CPR showed consistent positive asso-
ciations with serum ferritin levels across age subgroups in a
national sample of Mexican American men aged 20 ± 49 y.
When age and BMI were controlled for, WHR remained
signi®cantly associated with serum ferritin; the association
weakened with increasing age and BMI.

Mechanisms
Ferritin is a major iron storage protein found in all cell types
with isoferritin moieties identi®ed in liver and spleen (L
isoferritin), and for heart and kidneys (H isoferritin).25,26
Iron-free apoferritin is a spherical protein (MW 480 kDa) with
24 subunits surrounding a central cavity, which can store over
4000 moleculesofironasferrihydrite.26 Inmaturecells,ferritin
expression is regulated at translation via mRNA. Serum ferritin
is iron-poor (mostly apoferritin). Serum ferritin may be synthe-
sized and released from the liver andaor reticuloendothelial
system.26 It most resembles L isoferritin with a plasma half-life
of up to 30 h. A signi®cant proportion is glycosylated. Most
iron in plasma is bound to transferrin, with only very small
amounts in ferritin, which has very high af®nity for iron.
Because iron directly induces synthesis of apoferritin, a repre-
sentative fraction of ferritin being released into blood plasma
under most metabolic circumstances, serum or plasma ferritin
concentration correlates well with body iron stores.25
Increased iron stores in the liver are postulated to induce
liver-mediated insulin resistance, with reduced hepatic insulin
extractionandhyperinsulinemiaandreducedability ofinsulin
to suppress hepatic glucose production.8 Increased iron stores
in muscle could enhance oxidation of free fatty acids which
might interfere with glucose disposal.27 Serum ferritin levels
have been found to be associated with decreased insulin
sensitivity and increased fasting serum insulin and blood
glucose.8,27 These abnormalities might lead to increased adip-
osity. In several studies, serum ferritin was correlated with
other components of the insulin resistance syndrome.8,28
WHR and waist circumference re¯ect intraabdominal fat
mass in adult men;29 ± 31 SFR and CPR re¯ect distribution of
subcutaneous fat. Both are related to cardiovascular disease
occurrence in adults.4 ± 6,32 ± 34 In a study using computed
tomography, subcutaneous abdominal fat was at least as
strong a correlate of insulin sensitivity as visceral fat, and
remained signi®cant after controlling for visceral fat.35
Further, an android pattern of skinfold thicknesses was
associated with greater absolute and proportional amounts
of visceral adipose tissue than a gynoid pattern.31 Therefore
it is puzzling why skinfold ratios showed minimal corre-
lation with serum ferritin in contrast to WHR. Use of
dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry for accurate body fat mea-
surement and assessment of regional fat distribution
might resolve some of these problems in future studies.36
Despite preliminary conjectures and reports, a large body of
research has accumulated that fails to demonstrate a rela-
tionship of serum ferritin or various other measures of body
iron stores with the incidence of coronary heart disease or
stroke.1,37
Comparisons with previous reports
Only a few studies have assessed associations of obesity and
central or abdominal fat distribution with serum ferritin
concentration, yielding inconsistent results.7,8 Consistent
with the present ®ndings, among over 300 male Norwegian
oil workers, WTR and BMI were signi®cantly associated with
ferritin in models including multiple cardiovascular risk
factors.7 The effect of WTR was linear and independent of
BMI (also linear). In 36 volunteers in a metabolic study, the
log of serum ferritin was not signi®cantly correlated with
WHR; BMI (but not WHR) was correlated with ferritin only
among those in the top half of the ferritin distribution of the
sample.8 No studies of skinfold ratios were found.
Limitations of the present study include possible bias
arising from survey nonresponse and from missing values
for some variables. Several special studies of earlier HANES
and NHANES III data have indicated little bias due to non-
response.12,19,23,38 Adequate reliability has been demon-
strated for serum ferritin.15 Day-to-day variability in serum
ferritin would tend to bias reported associations towards the
null.39 Ferritin shows no appreciable circadian rhythm.25
Blood collection conditions in NHANES III were standar-
dized with regard to body position and vein constriction.
Males donating blood four or more times a year may have
depleted iron stores and reduced serum ferritin; however,
blood donors were not excluded since serum ferritin still
accurately re¯ects body iron stores.25 Since serum ferritin is a
positive acute-phase protein and does not accurately re¯ect
body iron stores in the presence of in¯ammation,25,40 the
regression analyses were repeated excluding 49 men with
C-reactive protein concentrations ! 1 mgadl or excluding
288 with any detectable C-reactive protein in serum
( b 0.21 mgadl); ®ndings were essentially unchanged. The
lack of a single, generally accepted measurement protocol
for body circumferences remains a problem for interstudy
comparisons, perhaps explaining in part inconsistencies
among studies. Confounding by variables not controlled
for cannot be excluded. Controlling for smoking status in
addition to the variables presented above did not change
results. Alcohol intake is positively associated with both
serum ferritin concentration and WHR.41,42 Controlling for
alcohol intake would be expected to diminish the correla-
tions of the latter variables. However, it is unclear whether
doing so would be controlling for a confounder or inappro-
priately controlling for a variable in a causal chain linking
ferritin and WHR.
The large sample size in NHANES III provided good
statistical power. Since the number of tests was restricted to
those of regression models and P-values for WHR were
` 0.01, chance is an unlikely explanation of the ®ndings.
The representativeness of the sample and the use of sample
weights provides wide generalizability of the results to
United States Mexican American men of the same ages.
Conclusions
Future research should include longitudinal studies of body
fat distribution and serum ferritin in non-Hispanic white
and black and Hispanic men and women to determine
temporal sequence of the relationship. Dual-energy X-ray
absorptiometry or other techniques for accurate body fat
measurement and assessment of regional fat distribution

should be used to determine whether adipose tissue in
various depots varies in its association with serum ferritin.
Body fat distribution and serum ferritin should be assessed
jointly as risk factors for development of noninvasively
measured atherosclerosis (eg carotid intima-medial thickness)
and non-insulin dependent diabetes.
