Introduction
Hypertension is a major public health problem throughout
the world.1 However, the pathogenesis of hypertension
remains unclear. It is considered that hypertension is a com-
plex disease resulting from the interaction between genetic
polymorphisms and environmental factors.2 Recently, many
genes have been identified as candidates for contribution to
hypertension.3 Of these, the angiotensin II AT1 receptor
(AT1R) plays an important role in normal blood pressure
regulation and in the pathophysiological progression of
hypertension.4­6 The polymorphisms of the AT1R gene have
been reported to be associated with the pathogenesis of
hypertension.7­9 In particular, a single nucleotide polymor-
phism (SNP), A1166C, is the most studied variant being
located in the 3 untranslated region of the AT1R gene.10
Several studies have indicated that A1166C polymor-
phism is associated with hypertension.11,12 However, this
association has not been confirmed in other reports.13,14 In
2010, Wang et al. conducted a meta-analysis assessing the

Abstract
Background: Previous studies have shown that angiotensin II AT1 receptor gene (AT1R) polymorphisms are associated
with the risk for hypertension. However, the results remain controversial. In the present study, we performed a meta-
analysis to systematically summarize the association between AT1R genetic polymorphisms and the risk for hypertension.
Methods: We searched the literature in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science, Wanfang, and Chinese National
Knowledge Infrastructure databases (CNKI) to find case-control studies on the associations of AT1R genetic
polymorphisms with the risk for hypertension. The meta-analysis was performed by using RevMan 5.0 software. The
association of hypertension risk with AT1R genetic polymorphism was estimated by pooled odds ratios (ORs) and 95%
confidence intervals (95% CIs).
Results: Fifty-six studies involving 28,952 subjects were included in the present meta-analysis. Our results suggest that
the polymorphism (A1166C) of AT1R gene is associated with a statistically increased hypertension risk, not only in Asian
populations but also in Caucasian populations. We did not find any association in African populations.
Conclusions: This meta-analysis suggests that A1166C polymorphism in the AT1R gene is associated with the risk of
hypertension in Asian and Caucasian populations.

association of the AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism with
hypertension in the Chinese population; this indicated that
the AT1R C allele carriers have a higher risk for hyperten-
sion.15 Niu and Qi also performed a meta-analysis and
found that the AT1R C allele conferred an increased risk of
hypertension.16 However, in these two meta-analyses, the
number of the included studies was rather small. In recent
years, many new large-sample-size case-control studies
have been conducted.11­14 Therefore, to further assess the
relation between AT1R gene polymorphism and hyperten-
sion, we performed a carefully designed meta-analysis
including 56 studies involving 28,952 subjects.
Methods
Selection of studies
We conducted a systematic computerized literature search for
studies published before 1 December 2014. We searched the
literature in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science,
WanfangdatabaseinChina,andChineseNationalKnowledge
Infrastructure (CNKI) database with the following search
terms: "hypertension" and "angiotensin II type 1 receptor" or
"AT1R" and "polymorphism" or "SNP", or "mutation" or
"variant", by two independent investigators. The publication
date and language were not restricted in the present study.All
studies which met to the inclusion criteria were retrieved for
further examination and data extraction.
Selection criteria
Studies satisfying the following criteria were included: 1)
reported the relation between the AT1R genetic polymor-
phism and susceptibility to hypertension; 2) definition of
hypertension as systolic (or diastolic) blood pressure 140
mmHg (or 90 mmHg) or treatment with antihypertensive
medication; 3) in a case-control using either a hospital-
based or a population-based design; 4) detailed genotype
data were provided for the calculation of odds ratio (OR)
and 95% confidence interval (95% CI). Studies that
focused on juvenile hypertension or secondary forms of
hypertension such as pregnancy-induced hypertension
were excluded from this study.
Data extraction
Two researchers performed the data extraction indepen-
dently. The following information from all eligible studies
were obtained: first author's last name, year of publica-
tion, ethnicity of the population studied, study design,
number of subjects in each category, baseline characteris-
tics of the study population, and the number of persons
with different genotypes in cases and controls and the
genotyping methods.
Statistical analysis
The RevMan 5.0 software was employed for the present
meta-analysis. The Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium was
estimated by the 2-test. We performed analyses under
the dominant model (CC+AC vs. AA), recessive model
(CC vs. AC+AA), and additive model (C vs. A). We uti-
lized Q-test and I2 test to examine the heterogeneity
between each study. By heterogeneity test, if I2 < 50%,
we select the fixed effect model to merge OR. If I2 >
50%, we selected the random effect model to merge OR.
Sensitivity analysis and publication bias analysis were
tested using RevMan 5.0 statistical software. The statis-
tical significance of the pooled OR was determined with
the Z test, and a p value of <0.05 was considered
significant.
Results
Baseline characteristics
A total of 447 articles concerning the AT1R A1166C poly-
morphism and hypertension were retrieved after first
search in PubMed, EMBASE, ISI Web of Science,
Wanfang in China, and CNKI databases. As shown in
Figure 1, after excluding duplicated publications or those
that did not meet the inclusion criteria, we included 56
case-control studies for the final analysis.11­14,17­68 The
characteristics of each study are summarized in Table 1.
These 56 studies involved 28,952 subjects (14,708 hyper-
tensive patients and 14,290 healthy control subjects).
There were 39 studies carried out in Asian popula-
tions,19­22,24­53,57,58,61,63,65 while 15 studies were performed
in Caucasian populations.11­13,18,23,54­56,59,60,62,64,66­68 Only
two studies involved an African population.17,18
Meta-analysis
As shown inTable 2. we found the polymorphism (A1166C)
of AT1R gene was associated with a statistically increased
hypertension risk ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR = 1.44 (95% CI:
1.24­1.66, p < 0.001); (AA+AC) vs. CC: OR = 0.61 (95%
CI: 0.46­0.81, p < 0.001); C allele vs. A allele: OR = 1.35
(95% CI: 1.18­1.55, p < 0.001)) in the total population
(Figures 2 to 4). In the subgroup analyses, the association
was also significant among studies using Asian populations
in all genetic models ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR = 1.41 (95%
CI: 1.19­1.66, p < 0.001; (AA+AC) vs. CC: OR = 0.50
(95% CI: 0.38­0.65, p < 0.001); C allele vs. A allele: OR=
1.40 (95% CI: 1.21­1.63, p < 0.001)). However, we only
found an association in a dominant model ((AC+CC) vs.
AA: OR = 1.37 (95% CI: 0.99­1.89, p = 0.05)), but not in a
recessive model ((AA+AC) vs. CC: OR = 0.81 (95% CI:
0.53­1.22, p = 0.32)) or an additive model (C allele vs. A
allele: OR = 1.09 (95% CI: 0.79­1.51, p = 0.58)) in
900 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
Caucasian populations. We did not found any association in
African populations ((AC+CC) vs. AA: OR = 2.53 (95%
CI: 0.66­9.70, p = 0.18); C allele vs. A allele: OR = 2.16
(95% CI: 0.93­5.01, p = 0.18)).
Publication bias
The publication bias test of the literature was conducted
using a funnel plot and Egger's test. Symmetrical funnel
plots were obtained in the SNP tested in all of the models,
which displayed no publication bias (Figure 5). Egger's
test further confirmed the absence of publication bias in
this meta-analysis (all p > 0.05, data not shown).
Sensitivity analysis
We removed one single study from the overall pooled
analysis each time to check the influence of the removed
data set to the overall ORs. The pooled ORs and 95% CIs
were not significantly altered when any part of the study
was omitted, which indicated that any single study had lit-
tle impact on the overall ORs and the results of this meta-
analysis were stable.
Discussion
The present study aimed to explore the association of the
AT1R gene A1166C polymorphism with hypertension
among a total of 28,952 subjects via a meta-analysis. We
demonstrated that the AT1R gene 1166C allele carriers
have higher risk for hypertension in Asian and Caucasian
population, but not in African population.
Meta-analysis is a powerful tool for summarizing
results from different studies by producing a single eval-
uation of the major effect. Genetic association studies
have a tendency to lack the power to detect a statistically
significant association with complex diseases, especially
studies with small sample sizes. To achieve a satisfactory
power, meta-analysis of multiple studies clearly has a
role in offering an association study with such potentials.
In the present study, we collected 56 case-control studies
involving 28,952 subjects in this meta-analysis to clarify
the relation between AT1R genetic polymorphism and
hypertension. We found a significant association between
C allele and the increased risk of essential hypertension.
In the stratified analysis, we divided these studies into
different subgroups by race of the participants. Significant
association between hypertension and the A1166C poly-
morphism was observed in both Asian and Caucasian
populations, but not in African populations. Our results
were in line with a previous meta-analysis in a Chinese
population. However, the mechanism responsible for the
association of hypertension risk with A1166C polymor-
phism remains unclear. A1166C polymorphism is in a
non-coding region of AT1R gene, and therefore the amino
acid sequence of the AT1 receptor is not altered. The lack

of a functional role of the A1166C polymorphism makes
this SNP somewhat unappealing as a "true" influence of
hypertension susceptibility. However, the A1166C poly-
morphism might affect mRNA stability and transcription,
or alternatively be in linkage disequilibrium with other
functional polymorphisms. Therefore, the functional
study of this variant was expected in the future.
Furthermore, we did not find the publication bias.
Sensitivity analysis also showed that omission of any single
study did not have significant impact on the combined ORs.
This made the results of this meta-study more reliable to some
extent. However, we found significant heterogeneity among
all the included studies. This heterogeneity may result from
study design of included studies. Two kinds control sources-
hospital-based controls and population-based controls were
used in the studies. The hospital-based controls might have
selection biases and might not be representative of the general
population. In addition, three races including Asian,
Caucasian, andAfrican populations were involved in the pre-
sent study. This fact may be another source of heterogeneity.
There were also some limitations in this meta-analysis.
Firstly, some clinical factors such as age, sex may affect
the hypertension risk. In the present study, we did not
adjust these confounders. Determining whether or not
these factors influence the results of this meta-analysis
would need further investigation. Secondly, this meta-
analysis only focused on papers published in the English
and Chinese language. Thirdly, the cross-sectional nature
of our included studies precludes comments on causality.
Finally, in this study, we only focused on the AT1R gene
A1166 C polymorphism and did not evaluate other poly-
morphisms in the AT1R gene, leading to the possibility
that the potential role of the A1166 C polymorphism is
diluted or masked by other gene­gene or gene­environ-
ment interactions.
Conclusion
In conclusion, this meta-analysis clarified the association
of A1166C polymorphism in AT1R gene of the risk of
hypertension. The presence of AT1R gene 1166C allele is
associated with an increased risk of hypertension in Asian
and Caucasian populations.
