Abstract
Background: Marijuana use is associated with anxiety, depressive, psychotic, neurocognitive,
and substance use disorders. Many US states are legalizing marijuana for medical uses.
Objective: To determine the prevalence of medical marijuana use and diversion among
psychiatric inpatients in Colorado. Methods: Some 623 participants (54.6% male) responded to
an anonymous 15-item discharge survey that assessed age, gender, marijuana use, possession
of a medical marijuana card, diversion of medical marijuana, perceived substance use problems,
and effects of marijuana use. Univariate statistics were used to characterize participants and
their responses. Chi-square tests assessed factors associated with medical marijuana registra-
tion. Results: Of the total number of respondents, 282 (47.6%) reported using marijuana in the
last 12 months and 60 (15.1%) reported having a marijuana card. In comparison to survey
respondents who denied having a medical marijuana card, those respondents with a medical
marijuana card were more likely to have initiated use before the age of 25, to be male, to have
used marijuana in the last 12 months, and to have used at least 20 days in the past month. 133
(24.1%) respondents reported that someone with a medical marijuana card had shared or sold
medical marijuana to them; 24 (41.4%) of respondents with a medical marijuana card reported
ever having shared or sold their medical marijuana. Conclusion: Medical marijuana use is much
more prevalent among adults hospitalized with a psychiatric emergency than in the general
population; diversion is common. Further studies which correlate amount, dose, duration, and
strain of use with particular psychiatric disorders are needed.

Introduction
Although the scientific inquiry into the health benefits and
harms of marijuana is ongoing (1), this debate is being
superseded in the United States by increased legal access to
medical marijuana, which is now permitted in 20 states and
the District of Columbia. Colorado, where the medical use of
marijuana was permitted in 2000 and the recreational use was
permitted in 2014, has the highest per-capita use of medical
marijuana in the United States (2); over 2% of the state's
population is registered to use medical marijuana (3). To
register a patient to use medical marijuana, a Colorado
physician attests that a patient has one of eight qualifying
conditions ­ cancer, cachexia, HIV/AIDS, glaucoma, epi-
lepsy, muscle spasms, severe nausea, or severe pain. The
registry does not require the failure of other treatments, or an
ongoing patient-physician relationship, and has no exclusion
criteria or age requirements. The registry allows physicians to
recommend, although not prescribe, marijuana to people with
a ``chronic or debilitating disease or medical condition'' that
``may be alleviated by the medical use of marijuana'' (4).
People recommended to use medical marijuana by a physician
are anonymously registered with the Colorado Department of
Public Health and the Environment (CDPHE). The CDPHE
publishes aggregate demographics that show that the average
age of registrants is 40 years, 69% of registrants are male, and
94% of patients are registered under the ``severe pain''
condition (2).
At Denver Health, the city's academic safety-net health-
care system, it is our clinical impression that the use of
medical marijuana is prevalent among our patients. We have
treated many patients with adverse events temporarily
associated with medical marijuana use, especially psychiatric
adverse events like suicide attempts (2). Marijuana is a
complex psychoactive compound that has different effects
on a user based on dose, strain, and formulation of marijuana,
as well as a user's previous exposure to marijuana. The chief

psychoactive ingredient of marijuana, D-9-tetrahydrocanna-
binol, is a partial agonist at the brain's endocannabinoid CB1
receptors, receptors that assist in the regulation of appetite,
mood, and motivation (5). Researchers are exploring the
potential therapeutic benefits of the multiple components of
marijuana for conditions including neuropathic pain and
spasms associated with multiple sclerosis (1). In addition, in
surveys of marijuana users in the United Kingdom (6) and
Canada (7), many respondents have characterized the anxio-
lytic and sedative properties of marijuana as salutary.
At the same time, marijuana use is associated with several
psychiatric adverse events. The World Health Organization
names marijuana as the most commonly used illicit substance
in the world (8). In the United States, approximately 6500
individuals begin using marijuana each day (9), and approxi-
mately 10% of users develop a cannabis use disorder (10).
Among people admitted to substance treatment facilities in
the United States, 17.1% identify marijuana as their primary
substance of abuse (11). In addition to its association with
substance use disorders, the regular use of marijuana is
associated with the development of anxiety disorders (12),
depressive disorders (13), suicidality (14), and cognitive
decline (15) in several cohort studies and meta-analyses. The
associations between marijuana use and psychiatric disorders
have been extensively studied for psychotic disorders. In the
resulting systematic reviews of epidemiologic and cohort
data, the use of marijuana is significantly associated with an
increased risk of developing schizophrenia at an earlier age
(16), while other studies correlate marijuana use by persons
with schizophrenia with impaired performance on tests of
attention and impulsivity (17).
While the biological mechanisms for the effects of
marijuana are still being fully elucidated, the available
literature suggests several mechanisms for the varieties of
psychopathology often experienced by persons on an inpatient
psychiatry unit. For example, activation of the endocannabi-
noid system increases impulsivity and suicidality, so the use
of marijuana, which supplies exogenous cannabinoids, may
increase impulsive acts and suicidal behavior, two common
reasons for admission to a psychiatric facility (2). In animal
models, marijuana use activates astroglial cannabinoid recep-
tors in the hippocampus, which may explain the association
in human marijuana users between bilateral volume reduction
of the amygdala, hippocampus, and other brain structures
involved in encoding memory (1); memory deficits are
features of many disorders experienced by patients admitted
to psychiatric facilities. Similarly, other animal models
associate exogenous stimulation of the endocannabinoid
system with impairment in GABA transmission, leading to
enduring disinhibition in the prefrontal cortex (18).
It is less clear to what extent the use of marijuana is related
to the utilization of psychiatric resources like hospitalization.
A recent prospective cohort study found that 30% of adults
admitted for psychiatric hospitalization used marijuana in the
30 days before hospitalization, but the study was conducted
in a location where the recreational and medical use of
marijuana was illegal (19). To contextualize this finding, in
the 2009 National Survey on Drug Use and Health, which
measures drug use in the general population, 6.6% of persons
age 12 or older report marijuana use in the month (9).
While these are separate studies with different methodologies,
the available evidence suggests that persons hospitalized for
psychiatric treatment use marijuana at higher rates than the
general population.
At present, the currently published studies examining how
persons with mental illness use medical marijuana have small
sample sizes ­ a sample of 18 adults in California (20), and of
80 and 164 adolescents, respectively, in Colorado (21,22); all
three studies were conducted after the legalization of the
medical marijuana ­ and were conducted with persons
enrolled in substance treatment programs. Finally, the diver-
sion of medical marijuana has been previously described only
in the Arizona Youth Survey, which found that 11.6% of 8th
through 12th grade marijuana users had obtained their
marijuana from someone with a medical marijuana card
(23). While this survey showed that diversion of medical
marijuana is prevalent, it did not obtain characteristics of
those diverting medical marijuana, the survey was limited to
adolescents, and it did not address persons hospitalized for
psychiatric care.
To test our clinical impressions that medical marijuana use
is prevalent among our patients and to begin to address the
known gaps in the literature ­ diversion by adults, use and
diversion by persons hospitalized for psychiatric care, and
small sample sizes ­ we initiated this study to, first,
characterize the prevalence of medical marijuana use, the
sharing or selling of medical marijuana by people registered
to use medical marijuana, and the use of other people's
medical marijuana among a sample of adults admitted to an
inpatient psychiatric service. Second, to determine if medical
marijuana use, registration, or diversion correlates with a
person's age, gender, age of first marijuana use, self-
perception of having a substance problem, past year marijuana
use, and frequency of marijuana use. Third, to redress the
research gap about the use and diversion of medical marijuana
among persons requiring psychiatric hospitalization, in an
initial effort to assess how the legalization of medical
marijuana alters the use of psychiatric services.
Since the use of marijuana is associated with substance use
disorders and psychiatric disorders, we hypothesized, first,
that registration to use medical marijuana would be prevalent
among our respondents. Furthermore, we hypothesized, based
on known patterns of marijuana use in Colorado, as reported
by the CDPHE (2), and the associations between marijuana
use and substance use disorders (12­17), that respondents
who used and diverted medical marijuana would report more
substance-related problems, earlier and more frequent use,
and be more likely to be a man between the ages of 25 and 44,
when compared to respondents who did not report the use and
diversion of medical marijuana.
Methods
Setting and participants
Denver Health Medical Center provides psychiatric services
through its ambulatory substance treatment facilities, psych-
iatry emergency service, and its inpatient units. Adults aged
18 years and older can be admitted to the adult inpatient
psychiatric service, which is divided into two units of equal
size. The west unit is for patients who require the availability
DOI: 10.3109/00952990.2014.949727 Use and diversion of medical marijuana 167
of seclusion or restraint; the east unit is for less agitated
patients. Patients often transfer to the east side before
discharge, so approximately twice as many people discharged
from the unit's east side than from its west side during the
study period. All patients discharged from the adult inpatient
psychiatric units between 1 May 2011 and 31 May 2012 were
eligible for this study. Participation was defined as willing-
ness to complete at least one item on the survey. Patients were
excluded if they were transferred to a correctional facility
at discharge.
Questionnaire and survey process
Before the study began, the Colorado Multiple Institutional
Review Board reviewed and approved the protocol and survey
instrument. As part of the unit's standard discharge process,
patients meet with a staff nurse to review their continuing care
plan. During the study period, the staff nurse asked each
patient if he or she would participate in an anonymous survey
assessing medical marijuana use and diversion. The ques-
tionnaire was based on prior research evaluating medical
marijuana use and diversion among adolescents (21).
Participants were informed about the study in writing and
verbally. To allay fears of surveillance, the survey was
administered on paper rather than on a computer. Out of
concern that a lengthy survey would have a low completion
rate, we limited our survey to a single printed page and
focused our questions on a participant's use, diversion, and
experience with medical marijuana. Participants were
reminded on the questionnaire itself that their participation
was voluntary, anonymous, and not a part of their medical
record. Participants received no compensation. Participants
and staff were instructed not to write participant names on the
questionnaire. If a person declined to answer the survey, the
nurse was instructed to leave the survey blank, and no data
was gathered on persons who declined to participate. If a
person was willing to answer the survey, the person completed
as much as they were willing to complete. If a person was
unable to read, the discharging nurse read the survey to them.
If a person was unable to read English, the survey was read to
them with the assistance of a hospital interpreter or an
interpreter language line. The completed survey was placed
into a locked box mounted on the wall of each unit. The
surveys were removed and stored in a locked cabinet until the
study ended.
As shown in Figure 1, the survey had a skip-pattern design
where not all questions applied to every respondent, so we
anticipated that each question would receive a different
number of responses. Thus, our study results are reported
based on the number of respondents to each question, which
leads to an uneven number of subjects in comparison groups.
If a participant denied having a medical marijuana card, any
responses about the reasons, use, and medical visits related to
medical marijuana were ignored.
Statistical analyses
Univariate statistics, including frequencies, percentages,
medians, and interquartile ranges (IQR) were used to
characterize the patients and their responses about medical
marijuana use. All continuous variables were non-normally
distributed based on the Anderson-Darling test (p50.01).
Pearson Chi-square tests were used to determine risk factors
associated with medical marijuana registrants. Cramer's V
was used to determine effect size. P values less than 0.05 were
considered statistically significant and all analyses were done
using SAS Software v9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).
Results
During the 13-month study period, a total of 1364 adults were
discharged from the psychiatric units. Thirteen patients were
ineligible for the study because they were discharged or
transferred to correctional care. The east unit discharged 916
patients (67.8%) and the west unit discharged 435 patients
(32.2%). There were similar numbers of females and males
discharged (658 vs. 693, respectively). The median length
of stay was 6 days on each unit (IQR 3­10 days for east unit,
3­12 days for west unit). Age was similar in the two units
with a median of 38 years (IQR 28­51 years for east unit,
28­52 years for west unit).
Approximately half (53.9%) of the discharged patients
initially agreed to participate in the survey. Of these
participants, 84.7% answered at least one question. Two-
thirds of the respondents (n ¼ 414, 66.5%) were from the east
unit, but the participation rates for patients from the two units
were similar. Among surveys with at least one question
answered, the response rate on individual items ranged from
82.2% for age to 11.8% for number of times seen by the doctor
who recommended marijuana. Based on the skip logic, 54.0%
of respondents completed all appropriate questions with 62
respondents (8.4%) responding to all 15 items. Because of the
skip logic, the resulting percentages are for varying number
of respondents, so we report both the number and percentages
of respondents.
The highest survey participation was among young to
middle-aged adults. Of those who participated, 383 (63.4%)
were between 18 and 44 years. Of those who chose to
participate in the survey, 332 (55%) were male (Table 1).
Some 592 respondents (49.3%) self-reported problems with
alcohol and/or drugs and 593 respondents (47.6%) reported
marijuana use in the past 12 months. Only 133 respondents
(22.5%) indicated they had never tried marijuana. Marijuana
use was common in the 30 days before participation in the
survey, as only 167 respondents (42%) indicated they had not
used marijuana in the past 30 days. 133 respondents (24.1%)
indicated they had received medical marijuana that was
intended for another person.
Sixty respondents (10%) reported having a medical
marijuana card. Of the remaining participants, 337 (56%)
replied that they did not have a medical marijuana card and
226 (37%) did not provide a response. The 337 participants
without a medical marijuana card consist of both recreational
marijuana users and non-users. Correlates of medical mari-
juana use were determined by the 397 total patients who
responded (Table 2). Males were significantly more likely to
be medical marijuana registrants (p ¼ 0.04). Registrants and
non-registrants were of similar age and self-reported problem
with alcohol or drugs at similar rates. The age of first
marijuana use was significantly different between the cohorts
even after accounting for those that had never used marijuana
168 A. M. Nussbaum et al. Am J Drug Alcohol Abuse, 2015; 41(2): 166­172
(p ¼ 0.03). A larger percentage of registrants did not try
marijuana until 25 years old (13% vs. 4%). The use of
marijuana within the past year was significantly higher for
registrants compared to those who use it recreationally (97%
vs. 64%, p50.001). Marijuana usage in the past month was
significantly higher for medical marijuana registrants
(p50.001), which is primarily due to the lack of use among
many non-registrants. After excluding those who did not use
marijuana, there was no significant difference in the number
of days of marijuana use in the past month (p ¼ 0.07). There
was no difference in the usage of medical marijuana that was
intended for another person between the two cohorts.
Respondents with a medical marijuana card were pleased
with its benefits, with 34 respondents (58.6%) describing
medical marijuana as ``very helpful'' and 18 respondents
(31%) describing it as ``helpful''; only four respondents
(6.9%) described it as ``very unhelpful'' (Table 3). 44
respondents (73.3%) reported that they had not experienced
side-effects from medical marijuana. Only five patients
(8.3%) had never tried marijuana before getting their medical
marijuana card.
A total of 44 registrants (78.6%) indicated ``severe pain''
as the reason that a doctor recommended medical marijuana
to them. Other common reasons included muscle spasms
(n ¼ 18, 32.1%) and nausea (n ¼ 13, 23.2%). One registrant
(1.8%) was unsure why the doctor recommended medical
marijuana. Some 27 registrants (46.6%) reported spending at
least 25 minutes with a doctor during the visit when medical
marijuana was recommended. Only five registrants (8.3%)
reported spending less than 10 minutes with the doctor.
Twenty-four registrants (42.1%) reported only one visit with
the doctor who recommended marijuana, however six patients

Discussion
Summary of findings
The rate of registration for medical marijuana among our
respondents was seven-fold that of the state's general
population. However, the age of registrants and the indication
for which they reported being registered roughly correspond
to the demographics maintained by the state's registry (3).
This may suggest that a disproportionate percentage of the
people registered to use medical marijuana in Colorado have a
psychiatric disorder and a history of alcohol- or drug-related
problems. Since the use of marijuana has been associated with
anxiety (12), depression (13), suicidality (14), cognitive
decline (15), and psychosis (16), medical marijuana systems
like Colorado's may be increasing the use of expensive and
scarce mental health resources like psychiatric
hospitalization.
Alternately, the high prevalence of medical marijuana
registration may indicate salutary benefits for persons with
mental illness. In the study, respondents with a medical
marijuana card reported good efficacy and excellent toler-
ability of medical marijuana. In addition, a majority of these
respondents, 70.7%, also reported spending at least 20
minutes with the physician who recommended medical
marijuana. However, 66.7% of respondents with a medical
marijuana card also reported seeing the doctor only once or
twice, suggesting these relationships are not ongoing patient-

doctor relationships (3,24). The study suggests that many
registrants are pleased with the state's medical marijuana
system. Among all respondents, the use of diverted medical
marijuana was quite common, with almost a quarter of
respondents reporting that someone with a medical marijuana
card had shared or sold marijuana to them. Young men with a
history of problems with alcohol or drugs who did not have a
medical marijuana card were the most likely to report
receiving diverted medical marijuana.
Study limitations
The generalizability of these findings is limited by collection
of data from a single site. The sample may skew to people
with lower socioeconomic status because of the hospital's
social mission, but socioeconomic data of respondents were
not collected. Details about the legal status of the participants
during their hospitalization and the mental illness for which
they were treated are not available, though this informa-
tion would help characterize persons using and diverting
medical marijuana. Without complete demographic data, it is
impossible to know how this study population compares to the
larger sample of medical marijuana registrants in the state, but
the available data suggests a concordance with what is known
about that sample. The study sample was clearly a clinical
sample rather than a probability sample and does not
represent the general population of Colorado. In addition,
this study relies on self-report, so it suffers from sampling
bias, and thus represents a subset of psychiatric patients who
will voluntarily complete an anonymous discharge survey
without compensation. Finally, the study instrument did not
include psychometric data.
In general, our survey was limited by the difficulties of
studying the medical use of marijuana. Although permitted in
Colorado, the use and possession of marijuana remains a
federal crime. Given that we were surveying a vulnerable
population, our survey was necessarily limited to preserve the
anonymity of our participants. So we did not ask about
socioeconomic data or particular diagnoses that could, in
combination, compromise a participant's anonymity. While
the resulting survey instrument ably protects the anonymity of
participants, it allows for no comparison between participants
who did and did not respond to their survey, as well as the
intriguing relationships between marijuana use and particular
psychiatric disorders like anxiety, depressive, neurocognitive,
and psychotic disorders that are associated with marijuana
use. Instead, the survey was designed to ask different questions
of groups with different exposure to marijuana, but its design
appears to have ultimately reduced completion rates.
Implications
This survey has the largest sample size of any study of
medical marijuana use and diversion among persons with
mental illness and is the first study to assess the prevalence of
use and diversion of medical marijuana among adults
admitted to an inpatient psychiatry service. It finds that the
use of medical marijuana is much higher than in Colorado's
general population, so the study reminds policy-makers to
consider how the legalization of medical marijuana will affect
mental health systems. Permitting the medical use of mari-
juana may benefit a subset of patients, and in further studies,
it would be interesting to ask respondents to characterize how
marijuana was helpful and how its benefits and tolerability
compare to other treatments they receive. For other patients,
the legalization of the medical use of marijuana may increase
the need for mental health and substance treatment. It would
be helpful, in further studies, to characterize these patients so
that policy-makers can determine how to spend medical
marijuana tax revenue earmarked for mental health and
substance treatment. In Colorado, this revenue has exceeded
expectations and the recent legalization of the recreational use
of marijuana may ultimately create an additional $100 million
of tax revenue per year, a portion of which is expected to be
spent on substance and mental health treatment (25). At
present, policy-makers have targeted prevention efforts and
exclusion criteria at adolescents, because the harms of regular
marijuana use are most consistently associated with early and
persistent use beginning in adolescence (26); this study offers
support for such interventions because only 4% of respondents
in our study initiated use of marijuana after the age of 25.
However, this study suggests the need to better character-
ize who is harmed and who benefits from increased
access to medical marijuana so that public funds can we be
well-used.

In addition, our study is the first to document diversion of
medical marijuana among adults. While our study sample has
the limitations described above, it also documents that at least
some persons registered to share medical marijuana are
sharing or selling their medical marijuana with others. For
clinicians interested in knowing if a patient is using medical
marijuana, it is insufficient to ask if they registered to use
medical marijuana; they should also inquire if someone else
shares or sells medical marijuana to them.
Researchers should continue to explore the associations
between mental illness and cannabis use, as this study
demonstrates a higher use of medical marijuana among
persons hospitalized with mental illness than in the general
population. In future studies, it is critical to better characterize
both participants ­ especially with regards to their patterns of
use, socioeconomic status, and particular psychiatric dis-
orders ­ and the type of marijuana they use. Marijuana is a
complex substance and in future studies, it is critical to assess
the amount, dose, duration, and strain of marijuana used by
participants. In addition, researchers should explore whether
or not the advertising of the medical marijuana industry
targets people with mental illnesses, as persons with mental
illness have been historically targeted by the tobacco industry
(27). In doing so, further studies could better characterize
when (and how) the medical use of marijuana is harmful and
helpful, for persons with mental illnesses.
