Abstract. The brain can retain speed information in early visual short-term memory in an astonishingly
precise manner. We investigated whether this (early) visual memory system is active during the
extrapolation of occluded motion and whether it reflects speed misperception due to contrast and
size. Experiments 1A and 2A showed that reducing target contrast or increasing its size led to an
illusory speed underestimation. Experiments 1B, 2B, and 3 showed that this illusory phenomenon is
reflected in the memory of speed during occluded motion, independent of the range of visible speeds,
of the length of the visible trajectory or the invisible trajectory, and of the type of task. These results
suggest that illusory speed is retained in memory during invisible motion.
Keywords: motion extrapolation, TTC, contrast, size, remembered speed.
1 Introduction
In the world we live in, where everything is in constant motion, we find that many objects continuously
cross our visual field. At times, their trajectory becomes hidden for a brief period of time by other
objects. In these circumstances, the ability to accurately judge the time of reappearance of the hidden
object becomes very important. For example, to avoid an accident while driving, we have to judge, and
we do it quite accurately, the time it takes for a motorbike to pass behind a still bus at a bus stop. This
common skill (innate ability) brings up many interesting questions. How do we perform an estimate of
occluded motion on the base of visible motion?
Previous studies have addressed this issue by using a prediction-of-motion paradigm, in which
observers estimate the time to contact (TTC) using the speed information of the initiation of an object's
trajectory (prior to occlusion), i.e., the time between the disappearance of a target's leading edge
behind the occluder, and when it would make contact with a given point of interception. The difference
between the "total response time" (total response time 5 TTC 1 duration of the visible trajectory) and
the "physical arrival time" results in the "timing error."
Many studies have sought to determine which strategy is best used to estimate TTC. One idea
is that people use a "cognitive clocking" strategy (DeLucia & Liddell, 1998). They compute time to
contact prior to occlusion based on the rate of change in the visual angle between a moving target and
its endpoint. This temporal representation can then be "counted down" during the occlusion period
(Tresilian, 1995). The "cognitive clocking" model seems at odds with several findings. For example,
it has been shown that moving distractors disrupt motion extrapolation performance (Lyon & Waag,
1995). Furthermore, induction of the motion aftereffect where invisible trajectory occurs systemati-
cally shifts response time (Gilden, Blake, & Hurst, 1995).
Recent studies have provided direct and indirect evidence that people use an alternative "track-
ing strategy" for motion extrapolation across the frontoparallel plane (de'Sperati & Deubel, 2006;
Makin & Poliakoff, 2011; Makin, Poliakoff, Ackerley, & El-Deredy, 2012; Makin, Poliakoff, Chen,
& Stewart, 2008). Jonikatis, Deubel, and de'Sperati (2009) claimed that observers follow the target
with the spotlight of visuospatial attention while it is visible and perform a sequence of saccades that
mirror the continuous extrapolated target movement. The "tracking strategy" (Makin & Poliakoff,
2011) involves using memory of the target velocity during visible motion and the shift of visuospatial
attention controlled by the oculomotor system (Rizzolatti, Riggio, & Sheliga, 1994), irrespective of
whether participants fixate (Huber & Krist, 2004; Peterken, Brown, & Bowman, 1991) or follow with
Illusory speed is retained in memory during invisible motion
Illusory speed in memory during invisible motion 181
a sequence of saccades (Jonikaitis, Deubel, & de'Sperati, 2009). This view is compatible with the pre-
motor theory of attention, in which shifts of spatial attention are produced by sensorimotor networks
that guide responses to external locations. Attention and motor planning are not distinct cognitive
modules; we shift attention to a spatial location by planning an action aimed at that location, even if the
planned action is never executed (Eimer, Van Velzen, Gherri, & Press, 2007). The tracking model pre-
dicts that during a visible trajectory, visual velocity signals attained by extra-retinal input are retained
in short-term memory. If stored velocity information can be retrieved from short-term memory (Kaas,
Weigelt, Roebroeck, Kohler, & Muckli, 2010), it can remain active during occluded motion and direct
overt (covert) visual attention.
In this study, we investigate how the memory of visible velocity accurately reflects the perception
of speed during a visible trajectory (Kaas et al., 2010; Makin & Poliakoff). In most cases, the "tim-
ing error" of TTC is found to depend on speed (Lyon &Waag, 1995; Peterken et al., 1991; Sokolov,
Ehrenstein, Pavlova, & Cavonius, 1997; Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003). Rosenbaum (1975) found that
observers perform the task accurately at all speeds. However, several studies suggest that the relation-
ship between visual speed and TTC is not linear. Lyon and Waag (1995) found that the lower the speed,
the more difficult it is to detect when a target passes a given cue during the invisible motion. Bennett,
Baures, Hecht, and Benguigui (2010) showed an overestimation of TTC during short periods of occlu-
sion (less than 1 s) and an underestimation for long periods (greater than 1 s). Sokolov and Pavlova
(2003) found that "timing error" depends on the interaction between the speed and visible trajectory.
In sum, depending on the visible velocity (either too low or too fast), on the time of occlusion, and
on the length of the visible trajectory, the memory of speed during occluded motion may not always
be isomorphic to the input received from the visible trajectory.
The most likely explanation is that the underlying neural mechanisms for coding velocity in
part corresponds to those involved in memory of speed (Pasternak & Greenlee, 2005) and in part do
not. There is evidence from both imaging (Jiang, Ding, Gold, & Powell, 2008; Lencer et al., 2004;
Nagel et al., 2006; Shuwairi, Curtis, & Johnson, 2007) and primate neurophysiological data (Assad &
Maunsell, 1931; Barborica & Ferrera, 2003; Ilg & Thier, 2003) of distinct regions of the cortex show-
ing increased activity during periods of occlusion relative to full visibility. Indeed, the behavioral data
associated with imaging show a difference in pursuit latency (Nagel et al., 2006) and response latency
(Shuwairi et al., 2007) between occluded and un-occluded conditions. This supports the suggestion
that visible and occluded motion evokes different speeds of processing.
However, psychophysical studies show that speed information is stored in an extremely precise
manner in short-term memory. Speed discrimination thresholds are not impaired for the range of 130 s
retention intervals (Greenlee, Lang, Mergner, & Seeger, 1995; Magnussen & Greenlee, 1992, 1999).
Magnussen and Greenlee (1992) tested two velocities: 2.5 and 5 deg/s for a 2 c/deg drifting grating.
Although discrimination thresholds increased at higher speeds, reference velocity did not interact with
the retention interval: i.e. the Weber fraction was almost constant across retention intervals.
These results suggest that observers can use speed information stored in short-term memory pre-
cisely. Our study questions whether speed information, as modulated by target contrast and size, is
stored in the early visual perceptual memory system and whether it remains active during occluded
motion.
In this case, we predict that differences in perceived speed will be reflected during occluded
motion, independent of the range of visible speed, of the length of the visible trajectory and occluder,
and of the type of task. To our knowledge, only two studies provided indirect support for this predic-
tion. Sokolov and Pavlova (2003) found that "timing error" depended on the interactions between
speed and target size. Makin et al. (2008) showed that the current velocity of occluded motion was
faster after a previous trial with a fast velocity and vice versa.
To establish whether perceived speed is stored in short-term memory during occluded motion,
we explored whether subtle misperception of visible speed is maintained during occluded motion. We
manipulated parameters that are known to produce an illusory perceived speed of a moving target. It is
well known that perceived speed is affected by contrast (Thompson, 1982, 2003; Thompson, Brooks,
& Hammett, 2006). Furthermore, it is well known that the perceived speed of an object is modulated
by its size and by the width of the visible window where the object moves (Epstein, 1978).
We measured, as in previous works, the TTC to a visible cue (a bar). We did not compute a simple
(absolute) "timing error" (Peterken et al., 1991), but rather analyzed the remembered speed: a ratio
between the length of the invisible trajectory and the TTC measured only during invisible motion.
182 Battaglini L, Campana G, Casco C
We believe that this ratio reflects a true pattern of underestimation and overestimation errors (Bennett
et al., 2010; Makin et al., 2008; Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003).
2 Experiment 1A
We know from previous studies that high contrast stimuli appear to move faster than low-contrast
stimuli (Gegenfurtner, Mayser, & Sharpe, 1999; Stone & Thompson, 1992; Thompson, 1982, 2003;
Thompson et al., 2006). Thompson et al. (2006) found that underestimation of speed at low contrast
occurred with grating targets of low (2 cpd) and high (8 cpd) spatial frequency. Experiment 1A was
carried out to check whether the effect of contrast on perceived speed also occurred when using small
circles in a continuous translational motion.
2.1
Method
2.1.1
Participants
Six volunteers, 4 males and 2 females, aged between 23 and 25, all right handed, took part in this
experiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. We obtained informed consent from
each subject at the beginning of each experiment.
2.1.2
Stimuli and apparatus
Participants sat in a dark room, 57 cm away from the display screen. Viewing was binocular. Stimuli
were generated with Matlab Psychtoolbox (Brainard, 1997; Pelli, 1997) and displayed on a 19-inch
CTX CRT Trinitron monitor with a refresh rate of 100 Hz. The screen resolution was 1,024 × 768 pix-
els. Each pixel subtended ~1.9 arcmin. The luminance of the background was 0.8 cd/m2. Stimuli were
presented as small circles of 0.5 deg in diameter. The luminance of the standard stimulus (SS) was
144 cd/m2 and that of the comparison stimulus (CS) was 1.1 cd/m2. Both were presented approximately
at eye level. Luminance was measured using a Minolta LS-100 photometer. Each target appeared
abruptly and traveled horizontally, either leftward or rightward, with equal probability. The motion
trajectory was produced by presenting the target in a new position in each frame. The visible trajec-
tory started 9 deg from the center and ended after 12 deg. The speed of high-contrast SS was fixed at
2.5, 5, or 10 deg/s; the speed of the low-contrast CS varied on nine levels: SS speed of 2.5 deg/s: 1.3,
1.6, 1.9, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8, 3.1, 3.4, 3.7 deg/s; SS speed of 5 deg/s: 3.8, 4.1, 4.4, 4.7, 5, 5.3, 5.6, 5.9. 6.1; SS
speed of 10 deg/s: 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5, 10, 10.5, 11, 11.5, 12 deg/s. Stimulus duration depended on speed; it
ranged from 3,243­9,230 ms, 1,967­3,157, and 1,200­1,500 ms in the low-, medium-, and high-speed
conditions of the SS, respectively.
2.1.3
Experimental procedure
The experiment consisted of three blocks, each devoted to one speed, preceded by 18 trials of practice
(2 repetitions  2 size  9 speed levels). Each block consisted of a random presentation of 180 trials
comprising 20 repetitions of the 9 speed levels. After 90 trials, a resting pause of 5 minutes was given.
In each trial, SS and CS trajectories were randomly presented in sequence, interleaved by an interval
of 500 ms. We used a 2IFC task in which the subject had to report whether the stimulus perceived was
faster in the first or in the second presentation. All participants were instructed to track the moving
targets and to press the appropriate key (counterbalanced between subjects) to indicate the interval
with the faster target. The next trial started 1,000 ms after the subject pressed the appropriate button.
No feedback was given.
2.2
Results
Psychometric functions (Figure 1) were fitted to the probabilities of perceiving the low-contrast target
faster than the higher contrast one, as a function of the physical speed levels (Finney, 1971). We then
conducted a two-tailed t-test to compare individual PSEs, i.e. the point of subjective equality to the
point of physical equality of speed (PE). Results revealed that the PSEs were larger than PE at every
speed of the SS: low (t(5)
5 2.76; p 5 0.04; d 5 1.15, power 5 0.62); medium (t(5)
5 3.37; p 5 0.02;
d 5 1.38, power 5 0.77); and high (t(5)
5 3; p 5 0.03; d 5 1.22, power 5 0.67). This indicates that
when the circles moved at the same speed, the low-contrast ones were perceived as slower. Interest-
ingly, the ratio between PSE and PE was constant at all speeds (1.04  0.01), suggesting that the effect
of contrast on perceived speed increased linearly with speed.

3 Experiment 1B
Experiment 1A showed that the speed of the lowest contrast target was underestimated. The PSE­PE
ratio was constant, indicating that the underestimation increased linearly with speed. Experiment 1B
investigated whether the illusory speed was retained during occluded motion. If speed was retained,
we predicted the low-contrast target to be "perceived" as moving slower behind the occluder with the
result of an overestimation of TTC. Furthermore, we predicted a constant ratio between this stored
signal and the one obtained at high contrast across visible speeds. This would be indicative of simi-
larities between the perception of speed during visible motion and the memory of speed active during
occluded motion.

Method
3.1.1
Participants
The same volunteers of Experiment 1A took part in this experiment.
3.1.2
Stimuli and apparatus
The apparatus, shape, and contrast of the stimuli were the same as in Experiment 1A. The target
appeared abruptly 7 deg to the left or to the right of the screen with equal probability, and the extent
of the linear visible motion trajectory was always 12 deg. The speed of the stimulus was 2.5, 5, or 10
deg/s. The length of the invisible trajectory was either 4 or 12 deg. A cue, a gray bar (luminance 1.89
cd/m2, width 0.17 deg, height 1.7 deg) represented the end of the invisible trajectory (Figure 1). Stimu-
lus duration varied from 1.6 and 9.6 s, depending on the speed and the length of the invisible trajectory.
3.1.3
Experimental procedure
We used the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. The experiment consisted of six blocks, three
with a low-contrast target and three with a high-contrast target. A block consisted of 120 trials ran-
domly presented: 3 speed  2 occluder lengths  20 repetitions, preceded by 12 practice trials (2
repetitions  3 speed levels  2 occluder lengths). The observers were instructed to follow the target
with their eyes until it reached the cue. They were also invited to "follow" the target with their eyes
while it moved behind the occluder, and instructed to press the space bar when it reached the bar cue.
The next trial started 1,000 ms after the key press. No feedback was given.

3.2
Results
From the TTCinvisible
(i.e. the time of key press minus the time of target disappearance at the beginning
of the invisible trajectory - TTCinvisible
) and the length of the invisible trajectory itself, we estimated the
remembered speed:
Remembered speed 5 length of the invisible trajectory / TTCinvisible
.
In Figure 3, the oriented lines in a time­space plot reflect remembered speed (Adelson & Bergen,
1931). For each speed level, we compared remembered speed data with a two-way repeated-measures
ANOVA having contrast (low vs. high) and invisible trajectory (short vs. long) as main factors. Results
reveal an effect of contrast on TTC for the high (F(1, 5)
5 28.02, p 5 0.003), medium (F(1, 5)
5 27.27,
p 5 0.003), and low speed of SS (F(1, 5)
5 16.01, p 5 0.01). Neither the effect of the occluder length
(high: F(1, 5)
5 0.09, p 5 0.78; medium: F(1, 5)
5 0.007, p 5 0.94; low: F(1, 5)
5 4.13, p 5 0.01) nor the
interaction contrast  occluder length (high: F(1, 5)
5 0.2, p 5 0.67; medium: F(1, 5)
5 0.63, p 5 0.46;
low: F(1, 5)
5 1.13, p 5 0.34) was significant. These results indicate that target contrast modulates not
only perceived speed but also remembered speed.
The ratio between the remembered speeds obtained in the high- and low-contrast conditions is
constant at all speeds (low: 1.10, medium: 1.12, high: 1.12), suggesting that the effect of contrast on
remembered speed increases linearly with speed. This suggests the involvement of a visual perceptual
memory system that precisely retains the illusory speed during occluded motion. Interestingly, the
remembered speed ratio is higher than the PSE­PE ratio obtained during visible trajectory (medium:
t(5)
5 2.93, p 5 0.03; high: t(5)
5 3.89, p 5 0.01) in Experiment 1A, suggesting that an additional phe-
nomenon may contribute to render the remembered speed illusory.
In addition, we conducted single-sample two-tailed t-tests to compare estimated TTC with actual
values. The difference was significant only for the low-contrast target for both occluder lengths at the
medium- (short: t(5)
5 2.65; p 5 0.045, d 5 1.08, power 5 0.73; long: t(5)
5 2.51; p 5 0.05, d 5 1.03,
power 5 0.69) and high-speed conditions (short: t(5)
5 2.78; p 5 0.04, d 5 1.14, power 5 0.77; long:
t(5)
5 2.96; p 5 0.03, d 5 1.59, power 5 0.76). These data indicate a true underestimation of the
remembered speed with a low-contrast target.
4 Experiment 2A
Results of Experiment 1 show that remembered speed, which according to the "tracking model" is
needed for judging TTC, retains the illusory effect of contrast on perceived speed. To further inves-
tigate whether the illusion of speed is retained in memory, we applied the "transposition principle"
(Brown, 1931). According to this principle, the perceived speed of one object is modulated by its size
and by the width of the visible window within which the object moves. The bigger the target size and
the frame that delimits its motion, the slower is the perceived speed (Wallach, 1939). Other studies
followed this seminal work (Epstein, 1978; Rock, Hill, & Fineman, 1968; Zohary & Sittig, 1993).
Epstein & Cody (1980) pointed out that the crucial factor producing the illusion was the size of the
target, whereas the presence of the frame was irrelevant.
Figure 3. The slopes of the oriented continuous lines on a time (TTCinvisible
) space (occluder length) plot reflect
remembered speed in the low- and high-contrast conditions. The dotted line represents the ideal slope that would
be obtained if remembered speed perfectly reflected physical speed.
Illusory speed in memory during invisible motion 185
In Experiment 2A, we varied the shape and size of the target, i.e. a flat and long rectangle versus a
square 10 times taller, in order to allow targets of different sizes to reach the end of the invisible trajec-
tory at the same time. To our knowledge, there are no studies that report the "transposition principle"
when shape and size co-vary and it is worthwhile to inquire whether the transposition principle holds
in these conditions. With size and shape co-varying in Experiment 2A, we evaluated the extent of the
transposition principle during visible motion.
4.1
Method
4.1.1
Participants
A different group of nine participants, 2 males and 7 females, aged between 22 and 30, took part in this
experiment. All participants had normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
4.1.2
Stimuli and apparatus
The apparatus was the same as in previous experiments. The SS (small shape) was a rectangle of
0.25 deg in height and 2.5 deg in width, and the CS was a square of 2.5 deg. Both were presented
approximately at eye level, with a luminance of 144 cd/m2 on a dark background (luminance 0.8 cd/
m2). Each target appeared abruptly and traveled horizontally, either leftward or rightward. Frame rate
and visible trajectory were as defined in Experiment 1A. The speed of the small SS was fixed at either
2.5 or 7.5 deg/s; the speed of the large CS varied according to nine levels: SS speed of 2.5 deg/s: 1.3,
1.6, 1.9, 2.2, 2.5, 2.8, 3.1, 3.4, 3.7; SS speed of 7.5 deg/s: 5.5, 6, 6.5, 7, 7.5, 8, 8.5, 9, 9.5. Stimulus
duration ranged from 3,243 to 9,230 ms and 1,263 to 2,181 ms in the low- and high-speed conditions,
respectively.
4.1.3
Experimental procedure
We used the same experimental procedure as in Experiment 1A.
4.2
Results
Psychometric functions (Figure 4) were fitted to the probabilities of perceiving the large shape as
faster, as a function of the physical speed levels. We then conducted a two-tailed t-test to compare
individual PSEs with PE. Results showed that the PSEs were larger than PE at high speed (t(8)
5 6.03;
p < 0.001; d 5 2, power 5 0.93) but not at low speed (t(8)
5 0.28; p 5 0.79; d 5 0.09, power 5 0.06).
This indicates that at a speed of 7.5 deg/s, the larger shape was perceived as slower. Different from
Experiment 1, a PSE­PE ratio larger than 1 was found only at the highest speed (1.08).
5 Experiment 2B
Experiment 2A shows that at faster and equal speeds, a larger target is perceived as slower than a tar-
get of smaller size. Experiment 2B investigated whether the illusory speed, as inferred from TTC, is
retained during occluded motion. Both targets had the same width and speed, then reached the end of
the occluder at the same time. However, we predicted the largest target to be "perceived" as moving

slower behind the occluder, resulting in an overestimation of TTC. As in Experiment 2A, we predicted
a remembered speed ratio  1 at highest speed. This would be indicative that a visual perceptual
memory system is active during occluded motion, which precisely retains subjective visible speed.

Method

Participants
The same nine volunteers took part in this experiment.
5.1.2
Stimuli and apparatus
The apparatus, stimulus shapes, and luminance were identical as in the previous experiment (2A).
The target appeared abruptly 7 deg to the left or to the right of the screen with equal probability, and
the extent of the visible motion trajectory was always maintained at 12 deg (Figure 5). The speeds of
the stimuli were either 2.5 or 7.5 deg/s. Stimulus duration was 1.6 or 4.8 s, depending on the speed and
the length of the invisible trajectory: 4 or 12 deg.
5.1.3
Experimental procedure
We used the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. This experiment consisted of one block of
160 trials randomly presented: 2 speed  2 occluder lengths  2 size of the target  20 repetitions,
preceded by 16 practice trials (2 size  2 speed levels  2 occluder lengths  2 repetitions). After 80
trials, a 2-minute pause was given. The observers were instructed to follow the target with their eyes
during its visible and invisible trajectory, and to press the space bar when it reached the bar cue. The
succeeding trial started 1,000 ms after the subject pressed the appropriate button. No feedback was
given.
5.2
Results
Remembered speed is represented on a time­space plot (Figure 6). Although size did not affect the
PSE at low speed, results of this experiment revealed an effect of size on remembered speed for both
low (F(1, 8)
5 10.93; p 5 0.01) and high speed (F(1, 8)
5 18.14, p 5 0.003) during occluded motion.
Neither the effect of the occluder length (F(1, 8)

5 1.61, p 5 0.24). This indicates that the subjective illusory speed during visible
trajectory is retained during the occluded motion.
The one-sample t-test revealed that with a large target, the TTC is significantly greater than the
actual one at high speed for both occluder lengths (short: t
(8)
5 2.31, p 5 0.05, d 5 0.70, power 5 0.59;
long: t
(8)
5 2.74, p 5 0.02, d 5 0.80, power 5 0.72).
At high speed, where the transposition principle works, the remembered speed ratio (1.12) does
not significantly differ from the PSE­PE ratio (1.08) obtained during visible trajectory (t(8)
5 1.61,
p 5 0.15).
6 Experiment 3
Our data show an underestimation of remembered speed for the low contrast (Experiment 2A) and
for the large targets (Experiment 2B), indicating that remembered speed is involved during occluded
motion and reflects the perception of visible speed. It is possible that changing contrast and size/shape
influences subjective perception of speed during the initial visible part of the presentation, which com-
bined with amplitude of the visible and occluded part of the trajectory could then influence the estima-
tion of time to contact based on a counting strategy. That is, participants could establish an estimation
of TTC prior to target occlusion, and then countdown to contact without any need to memorize speed
during occlusion. To check this possibility, we ran a third experiment in which the occlusion duration
and the position of reappearance were always unpredictable, preventing any a priori knowledge of
when or where reappearance would occur (DeLucia & Liddell, 1998; Makin & Poliakoff, 2011; Makin
et al., 2008). A persistence of an effect of contrast with this paradigm would favor the hypothesis that
subjects can precisely use speed information stored in short-term memory during the extrapolation of
occluded motion.

6.1.1
Participants
Six volunteers, 3 males and 3 females, aged between 23 and 28, all right handed, took part in this
experiment. They all had normal or corrected-to-normal vision. We obtained informed consent from
each subject at the beginning of each experiment.
6.1.2
Stimuli and apparatus
The apparatus was the same as in Experiment 1A. The stimuli, luminance, and diameter were the same
as in Experiment 1A. The length of the invisible trajectory was 4, 8, or 12 deg. The velocity of the
stimuli was always 7.5 deg/s. The visible trajectory (12 deg) started 11 deg from the center. Without
altering the length of the invisible trajectory, a reappearance error of 0, 150, and 300 ms was added
(Figure 7). After the reappearance, the target ran 6 deg and then disappeared. At 300 ms after target
offset, a 300-Hz pure tone alerted observers to press the response button.

The target reappeared either at the correct time or with an error of 150 or 300 ms, assuming a constant velocity
during occlusion. Participants discriminated between early and late reappearances.

Procedure
We used the psychophysical method of constant stimuli. The experiment consisted of 300 trials ran-
domly presented: 2 contrast  3 occluder lengths  5 levels of reappearance errors  10 repetitions,
preceded by 30 practice trials (2 contrast  3 occluder lengths  5 levels of reappearance error 
1 repetition). After 180 trials, a 2-minue pause was given. The observers were instructed to press an
appropriate button to indicate whether the target reappeared earlier or later, even when the target reap-
peared in time. Eye movements were allowed. The next trial started 500 ms after the subject pressed
the appropriate button. No feedback was given.

Results
We conducted a 2  3  5 repeated-measures ANOVA with contrast (low vs. high), occluder length
(short, medium, and long), and reappearance errors (2300, 2150, 0, 150, 300 ms) as main factors.
Results (Figure 8) revealed a significant main effect of the contrast (F(5)
5 16.87, p 5 0.009) and reap-
pearance errors (F(5)
5 9.96, p 5 0.003), indicating higher accuracy with low-contrast targets.
This effect confirms (Magnussen & Greenlee, 1992) that remembered speed follows Weber's law.
Indeed, if remembered speed at low contrast is underestimated, this would explain why subjects are
more accurate in discriminating very small reappearance errors in the low-contrast condition.
7 Discussion
In agreement with the literature, Experiments 1A and 2A show that speed is underestimated when
the size of the target is increased or when its contrast is lowered. We did not replicate the finding
(Thompson et al., 2006) that the effect of contrast inverts when the target speed is larger than either
4 deg/s (with 2-cpd target) or 2 deg/s (with a 8-cpd target).Alternatively, we found a linear relationship
between the effect of contrast and speed. This may be due to the different stimulus analyzers involved:
high-level shape analyzers in our stimulus conditions versus low-level spatiotemporal tuned filters in
the conditions of Thompson et al. (2006). In Experiment 2A, we found an effect of large target size
despite the absence of the reference frame. However, it is smaller (8%) with respect to that reported in
previous studies. Epstein (1978) reported an increment of 45% in perceived velocity when the size was
halved. The absence of the reference frame could explain the difference. However, Epstein and Cody
(1980) showed that the frame of reference is not necessary. Compared with previous studies, we used a
fixed trajectory length. This factor, together with the different shapes used (the smaller size target was
a rectangle and the larger one a square), could explain the smaller illusion.
Most importantly, Experiments 1B, 2B, and 3 showed that the misperception of speed due to either
contrast or size influenced remembered speed, as inferred from TTC during occluded motion.
Interestingly, results of Experiment 2B are in line with previous findings (Sokolov & Pavlova,
2003; Sokolov et al., 1997), but not with studies made in a more ecological environment (Horswill,
Helman, Ardiles, & Wann, 2005).
In Experiment 3, by using a paradigm that prevents or at least discourages counting (DeLucia &
Liddell, 1998; Makin & Poliakoff, 2011; Makin et al., 2008), we confirmed that contrast affects remem-
bered speed. Results suggest that remembered speed follows Weber's Law: given that remembered

high-contrast conditions.

speed(low contrast)
< remembered speed(high contrast)
, a smaller  remembered speed needs to be added (or
subtracted) to discriminate it. Indeed, as Figure 8 shows, the effect of the contrast seems greater with
the longer occluder length. This may account for higher accuracy in discriminating very small reap-
pearance errors with a low-contrast target.
The results provide support for the involvement of an early visual perceptual memory system during
occluded motion. We believe that the modulation of remembered speed by contrast and size is an effect
that cannot be assimilated to any of the speed effects previously described. Apart from other studies that
find a dependency of TTC on the length of the occluder (Bennett et al., 2010; Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003),
we found no effect of occluder length on remembered speed, neither in Experiment 1B nor in Experi-
ment 2B. In other words, given a fixed visible speed, the remembered speed gathered from TTC is simi-
lar, regardless of occluder length. We believe that these results are reliable because they are free from
bias. Instead, previous studies used the "timing error" which is not a bias-free parameter: since speed is
space over time, the same variation in remembered speed leads to a smaller "timing error" at high speed.
Thus, the lower error at high speed previously found (Peterken et al., 1991; Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003)
could only be an artifact. Second, the illusory remembered speed cannot be confounded with the effect
of speed on TTC (Bennett et al., 2010; Lyon & Waag, 1995; Peterken et al., 1991; Sokolov & Pavlova,
2003). Figures 3 and 6 disentangle these two effects. They show, as expected, that remembered speed
is underestimated in both experiments at high speed, whereas at low speed, remembered speed either
reflects perceived speed in a precise manner (Experiment 1B) or is overestimated (Experiment 2B).
Yet, we found that the remembered speed ratio is isomorphic with the PSE­PE ratio. In Experiment 1,
the two ratios are constant across speeds. In Experiment 2, the illusion is present in both perceived and
remembered speeds only at high speed. Third, the illusory remembered speed cannot result from an
interaction between speed and visible trajectory (Sokolov & Pavlova, 2003) since the visible trajectory
is fixed in all conditions.
One apparent contradiction in the results of Experiment 1 is that the value of remembered speed
ratio (~1.12, Experiment 1B) is larger than that of the PSE­PE ratio (~1.04, Experiment 1A). One
possible explanation is that size constancy by depth cues fails during occlusion (Dresp, Durand, &
Grossberg, 2002; Gregory, 1963; Ward, Porac, Coren, & Girgus, 1977). Therefore, observers judge the
target as smaller than it is, and according to Thompson et al. (2006), this gives rise to a larger effect
of contrast.
Consolidating our results demonstrates that visible illusory speed affects either the absolute judg-
ment (Experiments 2A and 2B) or the discrimination (Experiment 3) of remembered speed. This sug-
gests the involvement of an early visual memory system by either a mental imagery or a higher level
velocity representation (more likely during pursuit) that retains the sensory characteristics of visible
speed. Based on these findings, we are tempted to speculate that remembered speed may share pro-
cessing with visual memory processes occurring at low cortical levels (Huber & Krist, 2004; Jonikaitis
et al., 2009). Indeed, Makin et al. (2009) showed a positive event-related component over occipitopa-
rietal areas both with visible and invisible moving targets, although in the occluded condition the peak
occurs 200 ms after the onset of occlusion and is not related to a target velocity. Kaas et al. (2010)
showed that imagery of a motion trajectory produced a bold signal in MT/V51.
In conclusion, our results agree that TTC estimation during occluded motion is mediated by mem-
ory and suggest that an early visual perceptual memory system closely linked to mechanisms of visual
discrimination is involved (Huber & Krist, 2004; Jonikaitis et al., 2009). This memory may share the
proprieties of either visual imagery or mental representation and produce an internal simulation of the
continuous motion of the invisible target.
