Introduction
School-based sex education programs have undergone dra-
matic shifts in focus and content over the past two decades.
In 1996, Title V of the Social Security Act authorized US$50
million per year, requiring proportional state-matching funds,
to provide education that met the specific "A-H" definition
regarding abstinence until marriage, and it was reauthorized
in 2003 (U.S. Department of Health and Human Services,
1997, 2002). As the political landscape changed, funds were
appropriated in 2009 for a new Teen Pregnancy Prevention
(TPP) initiative to implement specific programs identified as
effective, or deemed "promising" based on preliminary
research criteria designated by TPP. The majority of the TPP
programs funded have been comprehensive sex education
programs, although limited funds for abstinence education
programs were appropriated in the 2010 health reform legis-
lation (Boonstra, 2010).
Since 1996, a variety of abstinence education programs
proliferated. Evaluation of their impact, however, has yielded
only limited studies, which have suggested delayed sexual
initiation (Denny & Young, 2006; Weed, Ericksen, Lewis,
Grant, & Wibberley, 2008), several demonstrating that the
programs were not effective (Kirby, 2002; Silva, 2002;
Thomas, 2000; Trenholm et al., 2008), or studies have not
been rigorous enough to draw conclusions (Kirby, 2007,
2008). One study demonstrated long-term impact of an absti-
nence program on sexual behavior; however, the program's
definition of abstinence did not meet A-H abstinence-
until-marriage guidelines (Jemmott, Jemmott, & Fong, 2010).
While the Federal government has made a significant
investment in abstinence education since 1996, states have
varied widely in their approaches to curriculum require-
ments, some taking advantage of the federal funds and their
associated matching requirements, which required programs
to meet the A-H abstinence-only-until-marriage definition.
Other states opted out of the federally funded program,
thereby not having access to the federal funds, but enabling
individual school districts to choose programs with or with-
out the A-H emphasis (Boonstra, 2010).
Meanwhile, state standards for curricula vary widely. A
total of 18 states and the District of Columbia require infor-
mation on contraception, while 18 require instruction on the

Impact of the Choosing the Best
Program in Communities Committed
to Abstinence Education
Lisa Lieberman1 and Haiyan Su1
Abstract
States vary in standards for sex education, some requiring an emphasis on abstinence. Schools seek to identify curricula that
reflect local community values and meet state standards. Choosing the Best (CTB), a classroom-based abstinence education
curriculum, has been implemented in 75 Georgia school districts since 1995. CTB Inc., sought to determine if this popular
program had an impact on abstinence attitudes, intentions, and behavior. Six Georgia public schools (1,143 ninth graders)
participated in the study in 2009-2010. Four randomly assigned schools received the CTB curriculum, taught by trained CTB
staff.Two control schools received their usual textbook-based abstinence lessons. Surveys were conducted at the beginning
and end of 9th grade,and the beginning of 10th grade.Data demonstrated significant impact of CTB at the end of 9th grade on
commitment to abstinence, proabstinence beliefs and attitudes, intentions to maintain abstinence, and lower onset of sexual
intercourse, and at the beginning of 10th grade on proabstinence attitudes. In two communities that sought an abstinence
education approach, CTB had a short-term impact on abstinence attitudes, commitment, and behaviors, and a longer term
impact on abstinence attitudes only.

importance of engaging in sexual activity only within mar-
riage (Guttmacher Institute, 2011). In all, 13 states expressly
require inclusion of information on the negative outcomes of
teen sex and pregnancy, and 36 require that instruction on
abstinence be provided. Georgia mandates that sex education
for public school students include "abstinence from sexual
activity as an effective method of prevention of pregnancy,
sexually transmitted diseases, and acquired immune defi-
ciency syndrome." Furthermore, Georgia allows, but does
not require, information on condoms or contraception (State
of Georgia Department of Education, 2011). Similarly, Texas,
Alabama, and Mississippi promote or require schools to adopt
programs that focus exclusively or at least partially on absti-
nence (Table 1; eLobbyist, 2011; FindLaw for Legal
Professionals, 2011; The Institute for Youth and Development,
2004). Despite varying state standards, a significant number
of teens nationwide continue to report having sex and engag-
ing in behaviors that place them at risk for pregnancy, HIV,
and sexually transmitted infections (STIs; Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention [CDC], 1991-2009). As individual
communities seek to address these issues, school districts try
to identify curricula that both reflect local community values
and meet their state education standards.
Choosing the Best (CTB; Cook, 2009) has been utilized in
schools in 48 different states, although its use has been more
prevalent in Southeastern and Midwestern states. More than
3 million students have participated in a CTB program since
1993. Specifically, in Georgia, 75 of its 183 districts have
selected the CTB program since 1995. Georgia's teen preg-
nancy rate has gone down at a higher rate than the nation-
wide trend over that same period, but remains alarmingly
high, 36.8 per 1,000 15- to 17-year-old females (Georgia
Department of Human Services, 2007). Recognizing that the
co-occurrence of high rates of program use and lower rates
of teen pregnancy do not demonstrate evidence, CTB sought
to determine if its approach, while popular in communities
seeking an abstinence curriculum, was actually resulting in
the maintenance of abstinence or a return from sexual activ-
ity to abstinence.
CTB is a classroom-based curriculum, providing devel-
opmentally phased messages--for Grades 6 through 12--
about the risks of sexual activity, including, but not limited
to, intercourse. CTB uses medical information to empha-
size the role of abstinence as the best way to prevent preg-
nancy, disease, and emotional consequences of sexual
intercourse, as well as its role in supporting academic and
other goals for future success. In accordance with the
review process for all federal abstinence education grant-
ees, CTB was reviewed and deemed "medically accurate."
One study suggested that CTB significantly affected a
range of "cognitive mediators" for sexual behavior, as well
as onset of sexual activity 1 year after the program (Weed
& Anderson, 2005). The mediators included holding absti-
nence values, personal efficacy to maintain abstinence val-
ues, future orientation to goals as they relate to maintaining
abstinence, independence from peer pressure, maintaining
attitudes that do not justify sexual behaviors, and intentions
and commitment to remain abstinent. Despite several meth-
odological limitations, the study's findings suggested that a
more rigorous, experimental evaluation was warranted.
Funding from a Community-Based Abstinence Education
grant enabled CTB Inc., to conduct an independent study in
2009-2010, in which schools were randomly assigned to
the program, focused on CTB Journey (Cook, 2009). CTB
Journey is the component designed for the 9th grade, where
abstinence education is typically taught in high school and
when the majority of students report that they have not had
sexual intercourse (Eaton et al., 2010). It should be noted
that most large-scale studies of such school-based pro-
grams use random assignment of schools, but few are able
to randomize individual students or classrooms within
schools (Kirby, 2008). Such studies are very difficult to
implement and are subject to contamination across students
within a particular school.
Method
Participants
Study participants were 1,143 ninth graders in two Georgia
school districts that had a total of six high schools, randomly
assigned to intervention (four schools) or control (two
schools). These two school districts were chosen because
they did not already offer the CTB program, but expressed
an interest in it, and were therefore willing to cooperate in a
study in which some schools would randomly be assigned to
the control condition. Ninth graders in control schools
received their regular textbook-based health lessons
(Bronson, 2009; Frideman, Stine, & Whalen, 2009), which
included a discussion of abstinence, that is, the "usual care"
in these districts. Ninth graders in intervention schools
received the eight-session CTB Journey program, taught
during health class, by trained CTB staff. The schools in
these two districts, one rural and one a very large suburban
district, were widely spread out from each other, and there
was limited contact between students from different schools
within or between each of the districts.
The pool of eligible students included approximately
2,000 ninth graders in the intervention schools and 1,000
ninth graders in the control schools. Ultimately, 1,143 stu-
dents, 38% of the total eligible pool, returned parental con-
sent to participate in the research. The rate of parental
consent did not differ between the intervention and control
schools. Comparison of study participants to the overall
school demographics suggested that those who received con-
sent were more likely to be female and African American
from the population of ninth graders in the intervention
schools, but the control group sample did not differ from the
ninth graders in their schools. These differences are dis-
cussed further in the "Results" section.

Table 1. Language From the Educational Standards of Selected States That Emphasize Abstinence Education
Alabamaa Alabama Code Title 16 Section 16-40A-1: Minimum contents to be included in sex education program or curriculum
dictates that "Any program or curriculum in the public schools in Alabama that includes sex education or the human
reproductive process shall, as a minimum, include and emphasize the following:
1.
Abstinence from sexual intercourse is the only completely effective protection against unwanted pregnancy, sexually
transmitted diseases, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) when transmitted sexually.
2.
Abstinence from sexual intercourse outside of lawful marriage is the expected social standard for unmarried school-
age persons.
Course materials and instruction that relate to sexual education or sexually transmitted diseases should include all of
the following elements:
1.
An emphasis on sexual abstinence as the only completely reliable method of avoiding unwanted teenage pregnancy
and sexually transmitted diseases"
Georgiab Georgia State law mandates that sex education for public school students is required and that abstinence must be
stressed. Information on condoms and contraception are not expressly required."Such standards shall include
instruction relating to the handling of peer pressure, the promotion of high self-esteem, local community values,
the legal consequences of parenthood, and abstinence from sexual activity as an effective method of prevention of
pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and acquired immune deficiency syndrome."
Mississippic Section 37-13-171, Mississippi Code of 1972, is amended as follows:
(1)
The local school board of every public school district shall adopt a policy to implement abstinence-only or
abstinence-plus education into its curriculum by June 30, 2012, which instruction in those subjects shall be
implemented not later than the start of the 2012-2013 school year or the local school board shall adopt the
program which has been developed by the Mississippi Department of Human Services and the Mississippi
Department of Health.The State Department of Education shall approve each district's curriculum for sex-related
education and shall establish a protocol to be used by districts to provide continuity in teaching the approved
curriculum in a manner that is age, grade and developmentally appropriate.
(2)Abstinence-only education shall remain the state standard for any sex-related education taught in the public schools.
(3)
For purposes of this section, abstinence-plus education includes every component listed under subsection (2) of
this section that is age and grade appropriate, in addition to any other programmatic or instructional component
approved by the department, which shall not include instruction and demonstrations on the application and use of
condoms.Abstinence-plus education may discuss other contraceptives, the nature, causes and effects of sexually
transmitted diseases, or the prevention of sexually transmitted diseases, including HIV/AIDS, along with a factual
presentation of the risks and failure rates.
Texasd TEC Sec 28.004 requires that school programs
1.
present abstinence from sexual activity as the preferred choice of behavior in relationship to all sexual activity for
unmarried persons of school age;
2. devote more attention to abstinence from sexual activity than to any other behavior;
3.
emphasize that abstinence from sexual activity, if used consistently and correctly, is the only method that is 100%
effective in preventing pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, infection with human immunodeficiency virus or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome, and the emotional trauma associated with adolescent sexual activity;
4.
direct adolescents to a standard of behavior in which abstinence from sexual activity before marriage is the most
effective way to prevent pregnancy, sexually transmitted diseases, and infection with human immunodeficiency virus or
acquired immune deficiency syndrome; and
5.
teach contraception and condom use in terms of human use reality rates instead of theoretical laboratory rates, if
instruction on contraception and condoms is included in curriculum content.

Program
Unlike comprehensive sex education programs that focus on
the reduction of risks due to sexual activity, CTB uses what
has been termed a "risk avoidance" approach. Students in the
program receive a maximum of eight, 45-min classroom
sessions during their regular health classes. In those sessions,
CTB teaches that abstinence from sexual activity until mar-
riage is the best way to avoid teen pregnancy, disease, and
possible negative emotional consequences, and is the best
way to help students focus on academic and other future-
oriented goals. CTB discusses both benefits and limitations of
4 SAGE Open
condoms and other forms of contraception in preventing preg-
nancy and STIs, in the context of promoting abstinence until
marriage as the healthiest and most reliable choice. Built on
the Theory of Reasoned Action and Planned Behavior (Ajzen
& Madden, 1986; Fishbein & Middlestadt, 1987), CTB
focuses on building intention to maintain abstinence, provid-
ing students opportunities to explore their own beliefs and
values, and to understand how these are influenced by others'
beliefs. In addition, CTB is designed to help students under-
stand how to set limits in relationships and establish refusal
skills to build a sense of control and power (Albarracín,
Johnson, Fishbein, & Muellerleile, 2001). Consistent with this
theory, the study hypothesized that students in the CTB
schools would demonstrate significantly greater increase from
baseline to posttest than those in the control schools in atti-
tudes and beliefs that support abstinence, discussions about
abstinence with their parents and others whose opinions were
important to them, sense of empowerment and confidence
(self-efficacy) to maintain abstinence to meet their long-term
life goals, and delay of sexual activity. Similarly, it was
hypothesized that these significant differences would increase
or be maintained at the long-term follow-up.
Instruments
In early 2009, a draft survey instrument, based on existing,
new, and funder-required items, was developed by program
and evaluation staff. The survey was approved by school dis-
trict personnel and Boards of Education of two Georgia
school districts in May 2009. It was pilot tested among 42
students from one ninth-grade class in each of the two school
districts. The final survey, modified using pilot data and feed-
back, included items that reflected six separate scales:
ProabstinenceAttitudes,ProabstinenceBeliefs,Empowerment/
Hopefulness for the Future, Commitment to Abstinence,
Parent/Child Communication, and Self-Efficacy.1 Scales were
created using the mean of the individual items for each of the
six constructs. Table 2 presents the scales, sample items, and
Cronbach's alpha for each of the scales. Additional items
measured abstinence intentions (likelihood of having sex
within the next year, and likelihood of having sex as a teen
before marriage), whether or not they had had sexual inter-
course, and, if so, when was the last time. Although the cur-
riculum focuses on a range of sexual behaviors, the evaluation
specifically defined sex as "sexual intercourse or going all the
way." Due to concerns about the schools' and communities'
sensitivity to more explicit questions, and the primary focus
on abstinence behavior, the schools and researchers agreed
that the survey would not include questions regarding contra-
ceptive use among those who had had sex.
Procedure
Students were surveyed 3 times--at the beginning and end
of 9th grade and at the beginning of 10th grade. The evaluator
met with health teachers, before the 2009-2010 school year,
to elicit support in encouraging students to return consent
forms. The evaluator trained data collection staff in proto-
cols, confidentiality, and completion of cover sheet identify-
ing information. Data collectors were CTB staff not teaching
or involved in the program at those schools.
Consent forms were mailed to all 9th-grade parents,
before the 1st week of school, directly from the principals,
with a second request 1 or 2 weeks later. As an incentive to
encourage their parents to return a consent form, students
were eligible to be enrolled in a lottery for an ipod player at
their school, if their parent returned a consent form. Pretests
for all students who had active consent took place during
August 2009, in their regular English classrooms. Students
who did not have parental consent were given an alternative
assignment in another location, as determined by each school's
administration. Data collectors had students place the sur-
veys directly into an envelope, which was sealed while in the
classroom, and then delivered to the project evaluator for
data entry and analysis.
After all baseline surveys were completed, the evaluator
used a table of random numbers to assign the six schools to a
study condition. The randomization process successfully
resulted in two of the three high schools in each district serv-
ing as intervention schools and one school in each district
assigned to the control condition.
Collection of post and follow-up data took place in English
classes, during May and October 2010 (the end of 9th and
beginning of 10th grades). Teachers in control schools and
CTB program staff completed a student attendance form for
every session that the CTB program and textbook lessons
were taught. Those data were entered by name and ID and
then transmitted to the evaluator by ID only, to merge with
the survey database for calculation of program dosage.
Data Analysis
Chi-square tests and t tests compared baseline means and
proportions. Each participant had three measurements on the
outcome variables; thus, outcome variables (continuous and
binary) were analyzed using generalized estimating equation
models for longitudinal data (proc genmod procedure in
SAS 9.1, logit link function was used for binary outcome
variables). The models included terms for treatment condi-
tion, time, a time-by-treatment interaction, and other con-
trolling covariates--pretest scores, age, gender, race/
ethnicity, and program dosage. Models were built for all
students and separately for those who were virgins at pretest
and for those who had had sex. A second set of models for
each of the groups also controlled for pretest commitment to
abstinence. This set is presented here, as commitment to
abstinence improved the models, but did not influence the
treatment outcomes.
The intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC) was calcu-
lated for the continuous outcomes, to study the school-level
Lieberman and Su 5
clustering effect in the analyses. The ICC overall was com-
puted using the linear mixed-effects model with the schools
as the random effects (Stanish & Taylor, 1983). The ICC for
the outcome variables are all less than .01 in this study.
Results
More than a third (38%) of the ninth-grade parents gave
active consent for their child to participate (n = 1,172), and
97.5% of those (n = 1,143, 756 intervention and 387 control)
participated in the study. The control group sample was rep-
resentative of their schools' overall gender and race/ethnicity
demographics. The intervention study sample was more
likely to be female and less likely to be White than the
overall demographic for their respective study schools. The
total study sample was slightly more female than male (57%
female), just over half were Caucasian (55%), and a third
(33%) were African American. Additional descriptive infor-
mation about the sample is reported in Table 3.
There were no significant differences between the inter-
vention and control samples on age or gender (Table 3).
There was a significant between-group difference on race/
ethnicity, with the control group more likely to be White and
less likely to be African American than the intervention
group. Because there were significant differences between
the treatment and control group on race/ethnicity, the

statistical models controlled for this variable. There were no
significant intervention/control group differences on pretest
sexual activity or any of the scales at baseline.
At the pretest, 69.3% of the CTB group reported that they
were virgins, that is, had never had sexual intercourse,
whereas 72.3 % of the control group were virgins. At the
posttest, 66% of the CTB group were still virgins and 63% of
the control group were still virgins. By the long-term follow-
up, 58% of the CTB group and 61% of the control group
were still virgins, a drop of 11% from the pretest in both
groups. None of the differences between groups at baseline,
posttest, or follow-up were significant.
Table 4 presents the sample size (N), means at pretest,
posttest, and follow-up on each of the study variables. It also
presents the effect size at the posttest for the outcome vari-
ables for all students. Retention rates from pretest to post-
test and from pretest to follow-up were 85% and 78%,
respectively, in the intervention group, and were 81% and
69% in the control group. Analyses compared pretest gender,
ethnicity, and sexual experience for those lost to follow-up
between the intervention and control groups. There were no
significant differences in loss to follow-up between interven-
tion and control groups in terms of gender, ethnicity, and
sexual experience.
Table 5 presents modeling results for each of the models
controlling for age, gender, baseline commitment to absti-
nence, pretest score on each of the dependent variables, pro-
gram or lesson dosage (i.e., how many lessons were received,
regardless of whether they were CTB or the control textbook
condition), and race/ethnicity. All the models were fitted by
using the pretreatment value as a covariate in the analyses of
posttreatment (both posttest and follow-up) outcomes. Thus,
in the estimated models, the treatment estimates represent
the treatment difference at the posttest from pretest. The
treatment-by-time interaction estimates represent treatment
and control group difference in terms of the change from
posttest to follow-up (Fitzmaurice, Laird, & Ware, 2004).
As shown in Table 5, there were strong short-term (i.e.,
end of ninth grade) intervention effects on proabstinence atti-
tudes, proabstinence beliefs, self-efficacy, commitment to
abstinence, empowerment/hopefulness, intention to delay
sex, and intention to wait until marriage, in both the total and

the virgin student models. There was no program effect on
parent­child communication about abstinence and sex.
Treatment effect sizes (Table 4) at posttest ranged from a low
of 0.08 to a high of 0.34, indicating relatively small to medium
effect sizes on some variables, at the short term. The odds
ratio of 1.43 was reported as the effect size for the binary
outcome variable "onset of sex," which can be interpreted to
mean that virgins in the CTB program were nearly 1.5 times
more likely to delay the onset of sex than virgins in the con-
trol group at the posttest measurement. As described below,
however, these effects did not last over the longer term.

interaction effects had a negative sign compared with the
treatment effect, except on proabstinence attitudes, which
did not have a significant interaction effect. This indicates
that by the 10th-grade follow-up, all but one of the treatment
effects had significantly diminished.2
With respect to sexual onset, there was a short-term effect
of treatment among those who were virgins at pretest. The
statistical model (Table 5) indicates that treatment had a pos-
itive effect to "onset of sex," indicating that the virgins in
CTB group were more likely to delay sex than the virgins in
the control group, when controlling for gender, baseline
commitment to abstinence, dosage, and race/ethnicity at the
posttest measurement.
The treatment-by-time interaction analysis, however,
demonstrated that the program effect on sexual onset was not
sustained at the long-term follow-up. In addition, lesson dos-
age (whether of the CTB program or the textbook lessons)
and baseline commitment were significant predictors of sex-
ual onset, at both short and longer term follow-up.
Among students who had already had sex by the time of
the pretest, there were short-term treatment group differ-
ences on proabstinence beliefs and on intentions to "return to

In addition to findings with respect to treatment effects,
other variables were significant contributors to the desired
outcomes: Gender and baseline commitment to abstinence
were significant contributors to proabstinence attitudes; gen-
der, baseline commitment to abstinence, dosage, and race/
ethnicity to abstinence beliefs; gender, baseline commitment

to abstinence, and dosage to self-efficacy; dosage and race/
ethnicity to commitment to abstinence; baseline abstinence
commitment to parent­child communication (among the total
sample); gender, baseline commitment, and race/ethnicity to
intention to delay sex; and baseline commitment to absti-
nence and dosage to intention to wait until marriage. Where
gender was significant, girls' responses were in the more
"pro-abstinence" direction than boys. Where race/ethnicity
was significant, White students held lower "pro-abstinence"
beliefs, commitment to abstinence, and intention to delay sex
than all other groups. There was no racial/ethnic difference
in onset of sexual intercourse. That is, although there were
racial/ethnic group differences in intentions, commitment,
and beliefs, White students were no more or less likely to
begin having sex than other groups.
Discussion
The study demonstrated promising short-term findings
among those who had not yet had sex on a range of attitudes,
beliefs, intentions, and behaviors. More specifically, analy-
ses controlling for gender, age, race/ethnicity, pretest scores,
and baseline commitment to abstinence, among virgin stu-
dents, yielded significant short-term treatment group effects
on intentions to remain abstinent, proabstinence attitudes,
proabstinence beliefs, commitment to maintaining absti-
nence, self-efficacy to set and communicate boundaries in
relationships, and sense of power in reaching future goals.
Among the sexually active group, there were significant
short-term program effects on beliefs and intentions only.
Although the program did include parent­child homework
activities in an attempt to expand the school curriculum's
reach to parents, there was no program effect on parent­
child communication about abstinence and sex among either
virgin or sexually active students, suggesting the need to
strengthen efforts to directly engage parents.
CTB students who were virgins at the pretest were nearly
1.5 times more likely to delay onset of sexual behavior by
the end of the 9th grade, a difference, however, that was not
sustained by the beginning of the 10th grade. CTB students
who had already had sex were more likely than the control
group to report an intention to return to abstinence at the
posttest, but there was no treatment group impact on time
since last sex, and the effect on intentions to return to absti-
nence was not sustained by the 10th-grade follow-up.
Notably, among these 9th graders, more than one in four
reported that they had already had sex, reflecting significant
risks by the beginning of high school.
Thus, some of the study hypotheses were supported,
whereas others were not. Students in the CTB groups showed
significantly greater increase in abstinence attitudes and
beliefs, intentions to maintain abstinence, and delay of sexual
behavior at the posttest. Hypotheses related to empowerment
and parent communication, however, were not supported, and
at the long-term follow-up, only the hypothesis regarding
abstinence beliefs was supported, but not those related to
other predictors, to intentions, or to sexual behavior. For
those that were supported, effect sizes were relatively small,
but these are consistent with other studies of abstinence pro-
grams (Kirby, 2008).
The CTB program, when taught by professional staff,
appeared to be more effective than a typical classroom text-
book-based program on ninth-graders' attitudes, beliefs,
intentions, and behavior at the short-term posttest. The pro-
gram's impact on proabstinence attitudes and commitment
to abstinence for virgin students are notable. One longitudi-
nal study of sexually abstinent adolescents found that con-
servative values contributed to the ability of adolescents to
persist in sexual abstinence (Blinn-Pike, Berger, Hewett, &
Oleson, 2004), and another suggested that holding a strong
commitment to abstinence may contribute to maintaining
sexual abstinence (Buhi, Goodson, Neilands, & Blunt,
2011). A study of virginity "pledges" (i.e., a formalized
commitment to remain abstinent until marriage) demon-
strated that, under certain very limited circumstances, ado-
lescents who had taken an abstinence pledge remained
virgins longer than those who had not (Bearman & Bruckner,
2001). These data suggested that virgin students in the pro-
gram increased both proabstinence attitudes and commit-
ment to abstinence. Their relationship to intentions and
behavior, however, are not clear, as the short-term treatment
effect on both intentions and sexual onset were not sustained
at the longer term follow-up.
Students received a maximum of eight, 45-min sessions,
for both the CTB program and the regular textbook health
lessons focused on abstinence in one school year. The CTB
program, by design, is intended to be offered in a sequenced
multiyear format (Cook, 2009). Unfortunately, school dis-
tricts are often unable to provide the entire scope and
sequence in such multiyear programs, given pressures to ful-
fill more mandates across primary academic participants
(Tappe, Allensworth, & Grizzell, 2010). The lack of long-
term impact of the program may illustrate what is known
about the challenges of school-based health interventions,
which may not last a sufficient number of hours, be rein-
forced over multiple grade levels (Connell, Turner, & Mason,
1985), and/or are not maintained in schools over time, to
achieve sustained attitude and behavior change (Smith,
Redican, & Olsen, 1992). The finding that higher dosage of
either program was associated with some positive outcomes
further suggests the importance of classroom time and rein-
forcing messages, regardless of the approach.
Questions about the impact, positive or negative, of absti-
nence education programs on students who are already sexu-
ally active have been raised in the literature (Santelli et al.,
2006; Wiley, 2002). Although the majority of students in the
ninth grade are not yet sexually active, nearly one in four of
this study population reported that they had already had sex
by the time of the pretest. Among those students, the study
findings were limited to short-term abstinence beliefs. This
10 SAGE Open
study tested only the impact of the single-year CTB program
in the ninth grade; thus, it did not address the potential cumu-
lative impact of a program that is designed to begin in the
sixth grade, when nearly 95% of students would not yet have
had sex (Eaton et al., 2010).
Limitations
The study compared the CTB abstinence-focused curricu-
lum taught by its own professional staff with a typical health
class textbook-based approach that contained lessons about
abstinence, that is, the "usual" intervention in these high
schools. Thus, it was not an attempt to compare CTB with
other philosophical or practical approaches, nor to make the
case for abstinence education overall.
An experimental study that included more schools was not
feasible, given the myriad challenges of school-based
research, for example, concerns at the district level about ran-
domization, sensitivity of the subject matter, that is, sex, and
limited instructional time, thereby creating hesitancy to use
classroom time for survey research. The study used the most
feasible design, randomization at the school level, involving
two districts with supportive administrators who agreed to
maintain two schools as control schools for the duration of
the study. This design eliminated the threat of contamination
within schools, and the schools' level of cooperation resulted
in a study in which treatment groups and protocols were suc-
cessfully maintained. The analyses took clustering into
account, as a way to address randomization by school, but the
total number of school units was still relatively low. The com-
plexity and cost of including large numbers of units (i.e.,
schools) in randomized studies is a significant challenge and
limitation of most school-based research.
Baseline and follow-up data were collected at the begin-
ning and end of the school year, at the same time for all study
participants. Students in the study, however, took ninth-grade
health in either the fall or spring. They were scheduled for
fall or spring health class by computer; thus, there were no
systematic demographic or academic differences that might
be associated with sexual behavior variables between stu-
dents who received the program in the fall or spring. This
method resulted in high rates of survey completion among
eligible students and also accounted for maturational differ-
ences between students who had health in the fall or the
spring of ninth grade. The scheduling did result, however, in
varying follow-up periods, with posttests ranging from 3
months for those who had health in the spring semester to 6
months for those who had it in the fall. Consequently, longer
term follow-up was a range of 7 to 10 months. Ultimately,
the ability to gather more data and to control for maturation
by conducting all surveys at the same points was considered
by the researchers to outweigh the disadvantage of the vari-
able follow-up periods. This is, however, a significant limita-
tion of the study and makes estimation of the length of time
that the program impact "lasts" nearly impossible.
Behavioral data were limited to self-reports, as most stud-
ies of this type. Monitoring pregnancies within each of the
school districts would have offered additional objective infor-
mation. Furthermore, questions about contraception and con-
dom use among students who were already having sex were
not able to be asked. Both the intervention and the study,
itself, were relatively short term, following students who had
received a maximum of eight class sessions in the ninth grade
through the beginning of tenth grade. Thus, if generalized,
application of the findings must be limited to single-year pro-
grams and relatively short-term outcomes, and within com-
munities that are already supportive of an abstinence
education approach, as these study school districts were.
Conclusion
In a randomized study design, with schools as the unit of
randomization, the study demonstrated that, in two commu-
nities that supported and sought an abstinence-focused
approach, CTB "Journey" resulted in significant short-term
impact on ninth-graders' commitment to abstinence, proab-
stinence beliefs and attitudes, and intentions to remain absti-
nent. Among pretest virgins, there was a lower onset of
sexual intercourse by the end of ninth grade. Among stu-
dents already sexually active, there was a short-term treat-
ment effect on intentions, but not sexual behavior. The study
was designed to determine the effectiveness of the CTB
abstinence education curriculum, as compared with the typi-
cal health textbook approach to discussion of abstinence. It
was not designed to study the overarching question of
whether abstinence education is more or less effective than
other approaches. Rather, it was designed to test the effec-
tiveness of this curriculum on a range of outcomes, within
two communities that sought an abstinence message for their
high school students and which were within a state that
requires an abstinence emphasis.
As educational theories and data demonstrate, long-term
changes in skills, attitudes, and behaviors are rarely achieved
with short-term approaches, but require repetition, reinforce-
ment, and increasing complexity. The CTB program was
designed for developmentally phased and sequenced lessons in
multiple grades. This study measured a single-year's interven-
tion only and demonstrated positive short-term effects on ninth
graders who were not yet sexually active. Future studies should
include multiple years of intervention, beginning in earlier
grades, to determine if this particular abstinence program can
demonstrate a longer term impact on sexual activity.

1. Proabstinence attitudes and beliefs were items required by
the funder; Empowerment, Parent Communication, and Self-
Efficacy were scales used in a previous middle school study
(Lieberman, Gray, Wier, Fiorentino, & Maloney, 2000).
2. If both the treatment and treatment-by-time interaction were
significant, but had opposite signs, then the treatment-control
group differences occurred at the short-term posttest, and had
reversed by the longer term follow-up point.
