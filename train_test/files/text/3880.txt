Establishing a Cloud Computing Success
Model for Hospitals in Taiwan
Jiunn-Woei Lian, PhD1
Abstract
The purpose of this study is to understand the critical quality-related factors that affect cloud computing success of hospitals
in Taiwan. In this study, private cloud computing is the major research target. The chief information officers participated in a
questionnaire survey. The results indicate that the integration of trust into the information systems success model will have
acceptable explanatory power to understand cloud computing success in the hospital. Moreover, information quality and
system quality directly affect cloud computing satisfaction, whereas service quality indirectly affects the satisfaction through
trust. In other words, trust serves as the mediator between service quality and satisfaction. This cloud computing success
model will help hospitals evaluate or achieve success after adopting private cloud computing health care services.

Healthcare in the National Health Insurance System in Taiwan
Introduction
Since 1995, Taiwan has provided its citizens with nationwide
health insurance. However, a few years after the implemen-
tation, the funding for national health insurance incurred a
shortage; therefore, many policies have since been proposed
to mitigate the funding gap, such as diagnosis-related groups.
In 2013, the second generation of the National Health
Insurance Program was implemented with additional supple-
mentary insurance fee to address the funding problem. For
hospitals, under the various medical payment standards of
national health insurance, reducing operating costs became
an important objective and a source of competitive advan-
tage. To achieve this goal, information technology (IT) has
been utilized as a critical weapon. Using the characteristics
of information systems (IS), hospitals can provide good
health care services at lower costs. These health care IS
include picture archiving and communication systems
(PACS), hospital information systems (HIS), and radiology
information systems (RIS), among others.
Recently, with the emergence of the cloud computing
era,1,2 generating electronic medical records (EMRs) has
become more feasible than traditional IT platforms.
According to its applications, the deployment models of
cloud computing can be divided into private cloud, public
cloud, and hybrid cloud.3 Many hospital-based applications
can benefit from this novel platform. Over the past few
years, more and more hospitals in Taiwan have adopted
cloud computing as their IT services platform.4 However,
previous studies were focused on critical factors that affect
adopting decisions.1,5 In contrast, very few studies have
been conducted to understand the success of cloud comput-
ing for hospitals. The work of Garrison et al6 emphasized
the critical role of 3 IT capabilities (managerial, technical,
and relational) toward the success of cloud computing.
However, they only focused on IT capabilities, other IS suc-
cess related factors were not considered. Besides, their study
has not applied to the health care industry which has particu-
lar characteristics than other industry.
This study, to address the insufficiency of related research,
attempts to establish and verify a cloud computing success
model for Taiwan hospitals. By integrating IS success
model7,8 and trust, the hospital cloud computing success
model has been established and validated using the question-
naire survey administered to hospital chief information offi-
cers (CIOs). This study has 3 major contributions. First, it
addresses the inadequacy of current research available in the
literature. Second, it can be referenced by hospitals that, in
the future, will adopt cloud computing. Finally, it can be uti-
lized by hospital management for evaluating the success of
their cloud-based e-health care systems.

Theoretical Framework and Hypothesis
The major theoretical base of this study is the IS success
model proposed by DeLone and McLean7 in 1992. Ten years
later, DeLone and McLean8 integrated various challenges
and IS environment evolutions, and proposed an updated IS
success model and applied it in the context of e-commerce
and electronic business environment.9 This model has been
verified by previous IS researches.10 It has also been used to
understand electronic health record (EHR) success in the
hospital.11 Therefore, it is suitable for understanding the fea-
sibility of cloud-based hospital IS. It indicates that informa-
tion quality, systems quality, and service quality are 3 critical
factors that will positively affect user intention and satisfac-
tion. In addition, user intention will affect user behavior and
will consequently affect user satisfaction. With better user
satisfaction, it will enhance use intention, thereby resulting
in a loop. Finally, success of IS will result in net benefits and
increase the continued intention to use the IS.8 This cycle is
illustrated in Figure 1.
In addition to the IS success model perspective, previous
studies indicate that cloud computing adoption is usually a
kind of IS outsourcing.12 For hospitals, transitioning from
traditional IS platform to a cloud computing environment is
a large-scale transformation. Most hospitals will look to col-
laborate with professional third-party cloud service provid-
ers. Hospitals in Taiwan are no exception. Therefore,
integrating IS success and IS outsourcing perspectives will
be helpful to understand cloud computing success in
hospitals.
From the IS outsourcing viewpoint, previous studies indi-
cate that the degree of trust between organizations and ser-
vice providers is most critical for successful cooperation.13,14
In addition, the work of Petter et al15 also indicated that trust
plays one of the critical factors that will affect IS success.
Therefore, trust has been integrated into the proposed cloud
computing success model and is validated in the context of
the private cloud computing in hospitals. In Figure 2, we can
find that the proposed model has 3 quality factors from the IS
success model7-9 and integrates the fourth factor, trust.15 The
dependent variable is the satisfaction of cloud computing
that is derived from the IS success model.7-9 Therefore, 7
hypotheses have been inferred:
Hypothesis 1 (H1): Information quality of cloud comput-
ing will positively affect hospitals'trust toward the IS ser-
vice providers.
Hypothesis 2 (H2): System quality of cloud computing
will positively affect hospitals' trust toward the IS service
providers.
Hypothesis 3 (H3): Service quality of cloud computing
service provider will positively affect hospitals' trust.
Hypothesis 4 (H4): Information quality of cloud comput-
ing will positively affect hospitals' satisfaction.
Hypothesis 5 (H5): System quality of cloud computing
will positively affect hospitals' satisfaction.
Hypothesis 6 (H6): Service quality of cloud computing
service provider will positively affect hospitals'
satisfaction.
Hypothesis 7 (H7): Hospitals' trust toward computing
service provider will positively affect their satisfaction.
Research Design
Materials and Methods
A mail-based questionnaire survey was used in this study.
Measurements used in this survey were adapted from previ-
ous studies and were modified to suit the research context.
Working definitions and employed measurements of each
variable are summarized in Table 1. Because the original
measurements are not designed for the cloud computing
development in the hospital, following steps were followed
to develop the questionnaire and confirm its reliability and
validity. First, English and Chinese specialists translated
each statement into Chinese and verified the equivalency of
the Chinese and English meanings. Next, to ensure content
validity, 3 experts (2 from the field of information manage-
ment and 1 from the hospital managerial level) were asked to
review the questionnaire, and accordingly the content was
modified. Because the population is scarce in this study (the
population in this study is only 502 hospitals in Taiwan),
only qualitative methods were used in the pilot test to

confirm the validity and reliability. Finally, 48 items were
used to measure the variables in the research model.
The respondents were the CIOs of the hospitals. Data col-
lection was conducted from March 2015 to May 2015 for
502 hospitals in Taiwan. Subsequently, the study received
214 valid questionnaires. The response rate was 42.6%.
Among them, 163 hospitals (76.2%) had already adopted
cloud computing whereas 51 respondents (23.8%) indicated
that they had not used cloud computing. Moreover, among
the 163 hospitals that adopted cloud computing, 64 (39.3%)
adopted private cloud computing, 49 (30.1%) utilized public
cloud, and 50 (30.7%) used hybrid cloud computing. Owing
to the different characteristics and requirements of various
cloud computing deployment types,3 this study focuses on
private cloud computing success for 2 major reasons. First,
separate different cloud computing deployment models will
avoid any unnecessary ambiguities. This is because different
deployment models of cloud computing have different pur-
poses and applications. Moreover, owing to security con-
cerns, many hospitals have chosen to adopt private cloud as
their first priority.4,19 This study also has similar findings;
therefore, focus on the technology utilized by the majority is
more critical.
We utilized 64 samples to validate the proposed research
model. Partial least squares (PLS) was used as it is suitable
for samples larger than 10 times the number of independent
variables.20 This study has 4 independent variables; there-
fore, the minimum required sample size is 40. This implies
that the selected sample size is sufficient for advanced analy-
sis. SmartPLS21 and SPSS have been used for the following
data analysis.
Results
Respondents' Demographic Characteristics
The 64 respondents are predominantly male, with 53 males
(87%) and 8 females (13%); 3 missing data were excluded.
Their ages ranged mainly between 31 and 50 years (75%).
Fifty-six (88%) participants had a college degree or higher.
Most of them had rich experience in the health care informat-
ics field (47% had more than 10 years of experience in the
health care industry). The respondents were mainly CIOs
and leaders of informatics-related departments.
Among the 64 participating hospitals, there were 4 (6%)
medical centers, 16 (25%) metropolitan hospitals, and 44
(69%) regional hospitals. This distribution is similar to the
population, thereby making the data set representative.
Among the 64 hospitals, 17 (28%) had adopted cloud com-
puting in the past 2 years and 13 (21%) had 2 to 3 years of
experience with cloud computing. The 3 major applications
on the cloud platform are PharmaCloud System, EMR, and
PACS. Finally, most of the respondents (87.5%) noted that
they collaborated with a third-party information service part-
ner for constructing their private cloud computing platform.
Measurement Validity and Reliability
The following criteria are utilized to evaluate the validity and
reliability of the measurements used in this study: composite
reliability (CR) > .7, average variance extracted (AVE) > 0.5,
Cronbach's alpha value > .7, and the square roots of AVE are
greater than the correlation coefficients to ensure discrimi-
nant validity. From Table 2, we can see that all of the indexes

are acceptable. Only 1 of the 9 items measuring information
quality was omitted because of low factor loading (<0.5).22
Therefore, 8 items were employed to measure service quality.
Other measurements remained unchanged from the original
instruments.As regards discriminant validity, the square roots
of AVE were computed and compared with the correlations
between constructs.23 According to the above criteria, the
results indicated that the discriminant validity of each con-
struct is acceptable. On the basis of the above testing, we can
ensure that the data set can be used for advanced analysis.
Hypothesis Testing
The PLS results indicate that the critical determinants of hospi-
tals' private cloud satisfaction are information quality (H4),
system quality (H5), and trust (H7).The R2 is 65.4%. Moreover,
trust serves as the mediator between service quality and satis-
faction. It implies that service quality will directly affect trust
(H3), whereas satisfaction will be affected indirectly. Overall, 4
proposed hypotheses are significant, H3, H4, H5, and H7. The
results are summarized in Table 3 and Figure 3.
Discussion
From the perspective of the IS success model, this study indi-
cates that only information quality and system quality directly
affect satisfaction. Service quality will directly affect hospi-
tals' trust toward their partners (R2 = 27%) and the level of
trust will significantly affect their satisfaction. The overall
explanatory power of the sequential dependent variable,
cloud computing satisfaction, is 65%. In other words, in the
context of private cloud computing in hospitals, integrating
trust and IS success model can improve the understanding of
the success of cloud computing. In contract to traditional
viewpoint, this study found that only information quality and
system quality have a direct effect on satisfaction. The effect
of service quality on satisfaction, however, is indirect. This is
the major theoretical contribution of this study. This finding
also confirms the opinion proposed by Paul.24 He indicates
that in the context of commercial cloud computing environ-
ment, service-level agreement and quality of service require-
ments of users determine the level of trust toward cloud
computing.24 Present study advanced finds that trust will not
only affect users' satisfaction but also serve as the mediating
role between service quality and satisfaction . Finally, com-
pared with information quality and system quality, service
quality is relatively intangible; therefore, it will not affect
users' satisfaction directly but indirectly. This phenomenon
will be meaningful for future studies about cloud computing.
For applicability in hospitals, cloud-based applications
need to provide reliable, timely, compactable, and clear
information for users. Besides, it also needs to meet users'
information requirements to ensure the quality of informa-
tion. Regarding systems quality, cloud-based applications
must ensure ease of use from a user perspective, and in par-
ticular, for doctors. A friendly user interface will help users
complete their tasks without the task being cumbersome to
execute. As regards the cloud service provider, this study
finds that only promoting service quality is insufficient to
ensure user satisfaction. Improved service quality is required
to promote trust level simultaneously. Only this approach
can improve user satisfaction. This study suggests that cloud
service providers must express their transparency and not
make decisions catering to their own interests. Finding solu-
tions that consider the interest of both parties is critical.
Overall, this study has both practical and theoretical
implications. In practice, this study aggregated the status of
private cloud computing development in Taiwan hospitals
and determined the critical success factors. The results can
be referenced by the hospitals in Taiwan and other countries,
especially in the Asia-Pacific region. In terms of theoretical
contribution, this study extends the traditional IS success
model to the issues facing the establishment of cloud com-
puting environments in hospitals. In addition, we established
and validated a cloud computing success model for hospitals
in Taiwan. These results contribute to the research streams in
the IS success model, thereby enriching the research context
of the IS success model.
Limitations and Future Directions
There are some limitations and future research directions
proposed in this study. First, this study only focused on pri-
vate cloud computing in hospitals. Based on the definition
proposed by National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST), cloud computing has different service models and
deployment models. However, this study only focused on
private cloud computing in hospitals. In addition, hospitals
in Taiwan have their own characteristics. Therefore, future
studies can conduct more research across different cloud
computing types and industries. Moreover, this study is a
cross-sectional study, and cloud computing is still in its

development progress,1 particularly in hospitals. Therefore,
longitudinal research will be needed for this research area.
Second, to make more significant contributions to the lit-
erature in this research area, future studies can apply the pro-
posed model to different cloud computing platforms and
compare their differences and similarities. Besides, the data
set only includes hospitals in Taiwan; therefore, we suggest
that data from different countries will enable researchers to
make more meaningful contributions. Third, only 4 indepen-
dent variables are included in the proposed model, even
though the R2 value obtained is acceptable. We believe that
more critical variables can be included to understand the suc-
cess of cloud computing in hospitals. Regarding the respon-
dents, CIOs normally are responsible for IS development and
could be also end users. Surveying CIOs is one perspective
for system success and, however, should be different from
surveying normal users in the results. Therefore, findings
from regular users other than CIOs may be different. Future
study can conduct comparative research to get a better under-
standing of this topic. Finally, previous studies25,26 had argued
the potential problems of small sample size in PLS; however,
the population in this study is only 502 hospitals in Taiwan,
and among the valid respondents only 64 adopted private
cloud computing. This causes another limitation. Future study
can focus on end users to release this restriction.
Conclusions
This study integrates the characteristics of cloud computing
by combining the IS success model and trust to investigate
the critical success factors that affect the success of private
cloud computing in hospitals. Based on this cloud computing
success model, we conducted a questionnaire survey to vali-
date the proposed model and hypotheses. Overall, the
explanatory power (R2) of this model is 65.4%. In addition,
the results of the hypothesis testing indicate that, similar to
previous studies, information quality and system quality of
private cloud computing in hospitals no double can have
positive and direct effects on cloud computing users' satis-
faction. However, service quality indirectly affects users'sat-
isfaction. Trust is the mediator between service quality and
satisfaction. In other words, maintaining a healthy partner-
ship between third-party information service providers and
hospitals is critical when developing private cloud comput-
ing. Besides, this study also finds that adopting private cloud
computing is a major trend among hospitals in Taiwan. The
3 major applications on the cloud platform are PharmaCloud
System, EMR, and PACS. Finally, this study found that
87.5% of the respondents have collaborated with third-party
partners for establishing a cloud computing environment in
their hospitals. On the whole, this proposed cloud computing
success model will help hospitals evaluate success after
adopting private cloud computing health care services and
achieve its value creation purpose.27
