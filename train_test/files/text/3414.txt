The backer­developer
connection: Exploring
crowdfunding's influence on
video game production

Abstract
As video game development studios increasingly turn to digital crowdfunding platforms
such as Kickstarter for financing, this article explores the ways in which these processes
shape production. It examines in particular the interactions that typically occur between
studios and players as part of crowdfunded development, analysing the ways in which
these activities inform aspects of video game design. By charting the implications of this
burgeoning economic model, the article contributes to scholarship concerning video
game production and intervenes within more specific discussions concerning the role
of the player within development. The article's case study, which draws from evidence
of production concerning multiple Kickstarter projects, is organised into two sections.
The first ascertains the degrees to which Kickstarter users can influence the details of a
proposed project during a crowdfunding campaign; the second looks at how developers
involve crowdfunding communities within production once funding is secured.

amountofmoneypledgedbyitsusercommunitytowardsvideogamesrosefromUS$1.2mil-
lion in 2011 to US$57.9million in 2013 (Bidaux, 2014). One development studio that sought
Kickstarter funding during this period was Camouflaj, which launched a campaign via the
site in the spring of 2012 so as to finance its inaugural title, République. The studio pitched
the prospective title as a `stealth survival'action game to be designed specifically for Apple
iPad, iPhone and iPod Touch hardware, incorporating a control scheme that would uniquely
utilise these devices' touch-screen inputs (Camouflaj, 2012). The Kickstarter community's
response to the project was initially mixed, with many users voicing disappointment con-
cerning the absence of a proposed desktop version of the title (Payton, 2012). At around the
midway point of its campaign to raise US$500,000, Camouflaj significantly altered its pitch,
promising PC and Mac incarnations of République, in addition to the already proposed iOS
versions. `We have heard you guys. We have adjusted our strategy', Camouflaj co-founder
Ryan Payton (Berghammer, 2012) announced via a Kickstarter campaign video update. As
part of this change in strategy, Camouflaj pledged not to merely port over to desktop com-
puters a game intended primarily for Apple's portable touch-screen devices; instead, it set
out to deliver a unique version of République specifically designed for PC and Mac `featur-
ing new gameplay and story elements that speak to the strengths of the platform'
(Berghammer, 2012).
The example of République, which went on to successfully meet its funding goal and
which was released in iOS form in 2013, indicates two distinct routes by which crowdfund-
ing communities can influence video game development processes. First, the example
clearly suggests that project backers influenced République through providing Camouflaj
with the financial resources necessary for development to proceed; simply put, without
Kickstarter support, this is a game which might not have otherwise been made.1 But, second,
the example of République also suggests that interaction between developers and crowd-
funding communities has the capacity to inform in highly specific ways the creative direc-
tions that a development project takes. In the case of République, Kickstarter users'requests
for PC and Mac versions of the game led not only to Camouflaj acceding to these requests;
they further motivated the studio to rethink a design concept tailored for touch-screen mobile
devices with the aim of ensuring that PC and Mac versions complement the technological
specificities of desktop computers (Berghammer, 2012; Payton, 2012).
This article explores in particular this second route by which crowdfunding communi-
ties determine video game production; that is, through the interactions that typically
occur between studios and prospective players as part of crowdfunded development pro-
cesses. As we shall see, such interactions typify video game development within the
crowdfunding sphere. The economic model of crowdfunding indeed appears to necessi-
tate developers of a given project to frequently interact with actual or prospective project
backers, if only so as to either appeal to the latter or satisfy the former. Developers are
generally expected to provide crowdfunding communities with deep, regular insight into
the development process, while absorbing and responding to their feedback.
The seemingly transparent production processes that crowdfunding entails can be
considered as distinct from those that often accompany the conventional publisher-
funded model; this being a model that continues to underpin development of many of the
video game industry's largest-selling titles. Via this model, major publishers such as
Sony, Nintendo, Activision and Electronic Arts limit interaction between the develop-
ment process and prospective players. Instead of facilitating an ongoing open dialogue
200 new media & society 17(2)
between studios and players, publishers will usually communicate selected information
regarding a forthcoming title via carefully timed trailers, screen-shots, press releases,
journalistic interviews with development teams and so on. Publishers furthermore tend
to mediate activities designed to procure feedback from prospective players, such as
focus group research. While there are useful studies that connect the prevalent publisher
model to development practices (De Peuter and Dyer Witheford, 2005; Dovey and
Kennedy, 2006: 43­62), an investigation into the links between video game development
and the industry's burgeoning crowdfunding model is so far absent.
Through its examination of how relationships between studios and crowdfunding
communities impact upon video game development, this article aims to provide an origi-
nal perspective on the links between production practices and economic models. To meet
this aim, the article explores a sample of Kickstarter-funded video game development
projects. This sample incorporates République, The Long Dark (in development), The
Mighty No. 9 (in development), Godus (in development), Star Citizen (in development),
Elite: Dangerous (in development), Shadowrun Online (in development) and Sir, You
Are Being Hunted (2014). These particular games have been selected so as to ensure that
the sample represents a diverse range of video game genres and project sizes. In terms of
genre, for example, the titles range from strategy (Godus) to stealth (République, Sir, You
Are Being Hunted) and from space simulator (Star Citizen, Elite: Dangerous) to side-
scrolling action (The Mighty No. 9). In terms of project scale, the amount of crowdfund-
ing that each project has received ranges from the relatively modest (£92,551 for Sir, You
Are Being Hunted [Farokhmanesh, 2012]) to the record-breaking (Star Citizen has, at
this time of writing, received more than US$48m [ConsoleTuner, 2014]).
Drawing from evidence of production concerning these projects ­ in the form of existing
promotional and journalistic material, as well as three original interviews conducted with
development-studio bosses ­ the article traces the influence that Kickstarter backers (and
prospective backers) exert upon development.2 Via this case study, it ultimately argues that
the crowdfunding model enables project backers to significantly influence the creative deci-
sions that studios make within development processes, thus distinguishing the crowdfund-
ing production mode from that of traditional publisher funding. Prior to this case study,
however, the following section situates this article within broader scholarship regarding the
role of players in video game production so as to appropriately contextualise discussion
concerning the role that crowdfunding communities serve within development.
Contexts: players, production and participation
As Bryan Behrenshausen (2013: 873­875) observes, games studies has increasingly focused
upon the ways in which players engage with video games; key examples of this approach
include studies into the myriad social and professional player practices that develop around
online, multiplayer and E-sports gaming (Chen, 2009; Crawford et al., 2013; Jin, 2010;
Quandt and Kröger, 2013; Taylor, 2006b, 2012). In line with this trend, the field has also
seen a related interest emerge concerning the ways in which players interact with video
game development processes. Such scholarship includes John Banks' (2013) wide-ranging
study of collaborative activity ­ or what he refers to as `co-creative' processes ­ between
players and developers. This scholarship also incorporates literature more tightly focused on
specific player practices linked to production.Anotable example would be the body of work
Smith 201
concerning the activity of modding (i.e. modifying) published video game content
(Davidovici-Nora, 2009; Hong and Hsueh-Hua Chen, 2013; Kücklich, 2005; Poor, 2013;
Postigo, 2003, 2007, 2008; Sotamaa, 2010; Targett et al., 2012; Taylor, 2006a). This focus
on players' interaction with production furthermore connects to broader discussions con-
cerning audience creativity within the contemporary media industries (Burgess and Green,
2009; Green and Jenkins, 2011; Jenkins, 2006).
A key debate within scholarship regarding media users' involvement in media produc-
tion, including such involvement as players' interactions with video game companies, con-
cerns the implications of these practices for media users. As Lin Zhang and Anthony Y.H.
Fung (2013) observe, academic discourses on this topic have largely revolved around two
contrasting perspectives. On one hand, scholars highlight the exploitative aspect of co-crea-
tive processes whereby users serve as `free labour' (Terranova, 2000) for media companies
and therefore submit, albeit often willingly, to an unequal power structure. Companies profit
from users' productive activities via this structure, while co-creators receive little to no
financial reimbursement for their efforts and no claims on intellectual property rights for the
content they generate (Andrejevic, 2008; De Kosnik, 2013; Kerr, 2013; Kücklich, 2005). On
the other hand, scholars emphasise the (non-monetary) rewards that users earn via co-crea-
tive activity such as the feelings of gratification resulting from their creativity and the pleas-
ures of feeling part of a user community (Poor, 2013; Postigo, 2003). This perspective
furthermore draws attention to the agency that users are often able to exert and enjoy as part
of their relationships with media companies (Banks and Humphreys, 2008; Banks and Potts,
2010; Green and Jenkins, 2011). While this article is primarily concerned with how interac-
tions between crowdfunding communities and development studios shape video game con-
tent, it nevertheless considers, in addition, the ways in which these interactions relate to
these differing perspectives.
A further significant feature of scholarship centred on players' involvement with
video game production is its dominant focus on the relationships between players and
studios that transpire following the commercial release of a title. The body of work there-
fore speaks to the increasingly persistent nature of video game production. As Aphra
Kerr (2013) observes, `Production does not stop when a product is launched in the mar-
ketplace ... We need to see production as an ongoing process' (pp. 25­26), which typi-
cally includes some form of player input. This input could take the form of data
concerning gaming behaviour, for instance, which might result in a studio updating a
game.3 Or it could take the form of players' social media protests influencing changes to
a published title.4 Or it could take the form of in-game user-generated content, or key
paratextual material such as wikis, walkthroughs and `let's play' videos. As a conse-
quence of these and other player practices, video games are thus, observes Kerr (2013),
`technical artefacts' that `change over time', with this change in part `induced or pro-
duced by users and/or their knowledge, or knowledge about them, and their labour' (p.
27).5 Scholarly focus on these relationships between players and developers following a
game's release is most welcome; yet comparatively little attention has so far been given
to the interactions between studios and prospective players prior to a game's launch. By
exploring, in particular, the interactions between developers and crowdfunding commu-
nities that occur prior to release, this article thus establishes a useful vantage on relation-
ships between players and studios at early stages of production.
202 new media & society 17(2)
The fact that there has so far been relatively little discussion concerning player interac-
tion within production prior to a game's release likely reflects the traditionally limited nature
of such interaction within development. This separation between player and studio is evi-
dent in, for example, Kerr's (2002) research into the investor-funded development of an
online strategy game. In this case (Kerr, 2002), developers had little engagement with users
prior to beta testing; they appeared instead `to have reached their target market by designing
for themselves and relying upon implicit and intuitive representations of players' (p. 291).6
There are, certainly, various counter examples to this practice. The development studio
Auran, for instance, engaged strongly with a community of online rail enthusiasts prior to
launching its investor-funded train simulator title (Banks, 2013: 66­77); this dedicated
group, observes Banks (2013), provided `useful feedback' that helped `guide and define
ongoing development' (p. 72). A further example would be the production of LucasArts'
Star Wars Galaxies, during which the project's creative director, Ralph Koster, founded a
co-creative relationship with the large online community that formed around the develop-
ment (Jenkins, 2006: 164­172). But more commonly, at least within a boxed game sector
that is operated by large publishers and video game console manufacturers, publishers medi-
ate interaction between developers and prospective players (Kerr, 2013: 26). Via this model,
publishers and developers furthermore restrict the public dissemination of information con-
cerning production. While, with Star Wars Galaxies, Koster (2006) endeavoured to operate
a transparent and inclusive production process, he observes that his approach is atypical:
`These days', he says, `it's accepted wisdom that you don't reveal a [game] feature until it's
done, so as to guarantee that you never let the players down'. Yosuke Matsuda (Williams,
2013), senior executive managing director of the publisher Square Enix, concurs with this
view that standard publisher practice restricts developers' communication with prospective
players. Via this approach, he notes, `Customers wait for years with little to no
information'.
Development processes within the crowdfunding space, which are typified by an ongo-
ing dialogue between developers and players, thus operate in contrast to traditional produc-
tion practices. Developers furthermore discursively frame these opportunities for backer
engagement in highly positive terms. According to many developers, one of the benefits of
this increased connection between studios and player communities is the constructive influ-
ence the latter can exert on development. For example, on the day his studio secured
Kickstarter financing for its sci-fi role-playing game Consortium, Interdimensional Games
CEO Gregory MacMartin (Zellmer, 2013) suggested that contributor participation could
enhance production. `We now have a community of gamers that are eager to join us in these
final months of development to help us shape this interactive experience', he said. Hinterland
Games creative director Raphael van Lierop (2013, personal communication) similarly sug-
gests that the process of `ongoing dialogue' between developer and backer as part of the
crowdfunding process can positively influence development. Concerning the creation of his
studio's Kickstarter-backed first-person survival adventure The Long Dark, van Lierop
(2013, personal communication) claims that direct interaction with the backer community
will enable the developer to `make a better game'.Veteran developer Keiji Inafune (Comcept
USA, 2013), whose studio achieved Kickstarter funding for its two-dimensional (2D)
action-platformer Mighty No. 9, also views the participatory culture that the crowdfunding
sphere facilitates as a boon to production. `I think Kickstarter is an amazing system allowing
game creators and fans to connect, communicate and create things ­ together', he says.
Smith 203
Developers often use such enthusiastic discourses regarding crowdfunded co-creative
processes as a way to promote their projects through the promise of participation, and so
their celebratory tone should be considered with some degree of scepticism. Nevertheless,
these claims do raise a particular question; namely, how does this co-creativity operate
within crowdfunded video game production? Or, to put it another way, precisely how
does the involvement of crowdfunding communities within development contribute, as
claimed, to the `making', `shaping' and `creating' of video games? Through its examina-
tion of the ways in which relationships between studios and players inform development
processes, these are questions that the following case study aims to directly address. The
study is organised into two distinct sections, with each section concerned with a separate
distinct phase of interaction between a given studio and a Kickstarter community. These
two phases are the campaign phase and the post-campaign phase. The following section
focuses on the campaign phase specifically, which relates to that period in which a
Kickstarter campaign is occurring.
Backer­developer interaction: Campaign phase
Having revealed initial details of its proposed project, and having set a funding target that
must be met in order for any monies to be received, the development studio in the cam-
paign phase is typically engaged in sustained communication with the Kickstarter com-
munity. The length of this phase is variable and determined by the studio, but 30-day
durations or similar are common. As part of a campaign, a studio will usually provide an
in-depth outline regarding details of the proposed game on its Kickstarter project page.
It will also likely drip-feed additional project details via updates on this page, thus poten-
tially sustaining the community's interest, while also possibly extending the coverage
that the project will receive within the online gaming press. Such updates might include
the reveal of new concept art or an announcement regarding the recruitment to the devel-
opment team of a popular creative talent, such as a cult composer or voice artist. But the
studio is also likely to respond to queries and feedback from the community via the com-
ments section attached to its project page, as well as via email and social media.
As part of a campaign, a community is also able to communicate directly to a studio
via these same electronic means, voicing support, queries and/or concerns. Often this
will lead to a studio responding in turn with clarification or elaboration concerning its
previously established development strategy. However, community feedback can also
result in a studio course-correcting its outlined plans. This is evident in the aforemen-
tioned case of République. It was community pressure that contributed to Camouflaj
opting to develop the title for PC and Mac, in addition to iOS touch-screen devices; it
was this pressure in turn that ultimately led to the studio rethinking aspects of design so
as to take into account the specific hardware specifications of desktop platforms. One
key example of the way in which Camouflaj has looked to exploit the specificities of PC
and Mac computers relates to how the player interacts within the fiction of République,
the premise of which concerns the fate of Hope ­ a character trapped within a totalitarian
state. Within the iOS version of the game, the player is charged with hacking and manip-
ulating surveillance devices within the game world, such as security cameras, so as to
guide Hope. Following the decision to develop the title for desktop computers, the studio
began to consider the unique ways in which PC and Mac versions might permit the
204 new media & society 17(2)
player to utilise the game world surveillance devices. The studio, for example, envisaged
the player of the PC and Mac version being able to have multiple windows simultane-
ously open on a single screen, with each window providing the perspective of a particu-
lar game world security camera or map, which is a design feature that would be untenable
on an iOS small screen device (Berghammer, 2012).7 In this case, Kickstarter community
input during the campaign phase ultimately led to Camouflaj deliberating design features
concerning platforms for which it had previously no intention to develop.
This case of Kickstarter community feedback leading to a studio changing direction
within the campaign phase is not an isolated one. A further example would be Cliffhanger
Productions' Kickstarter-funded Shadowrun Online, a massively multiplayer online role-
playing game (MMORPG) set within a cyberpunk fictional universe. While, with
République, Camouflaj altered its platform release strategy, in the case of Shadowrun
Online's campaign phase, Cliffhanger Productions transformed the game's proposed reve-
nue model. Shadowrun Online had originally been conceived as a `free-to-play'(F2P) game.
Via this model, which has become increasingly popular for MMORPGs in recent years,
players do not pay money up front so as to play a given MMO; instead, the player is usually
able to purchase with real money fictional in-game items (such as weapons and outfits),
which might enable the player to progress more easily within the game. But many members
of the Kickstarter community responded negatively to Cliffhanger Productions' proposed
adoption of this model, suggesting the scheme imbued a `pay-to-win'component within the
design; in other words, the community members feared that those players who spent the
most money on in-game items might have an advantage during player versus player (PvP)
combat encounters (Cliffhanger Productions, 2012). Following the community's voicing of
this concern, the developer altered its business plan 6days into Shadowrun Online's cam-
paign launch, proposing a so-called campaign revenue model designed to operate alongside
the free-to-play model. Via the proposed campaign model, players can pay a one-time fee of
US$39.99, allowing them to purchase any in-game items via an in-game currency (to be
earned through the playing of the game). The introduction of the campaign model to the
Shadowrun Online project, then, altered the design of the proposed multiplayer experience
by reducing the potential for players to purchase their way to victory as part of mismatched
PvP encounters. This shift in economic model was furthermore apparently a direct response
to Kickstarter community disquiet. As Cliffhanger Productions (2012) stated when it
revealed the campaign model via Kickstarter update, `We had the game originally planned
with the free-to-play model ... but if you think differently ­ we adapt'.
These two cases provide some indication concerning the ways in which interaction
between developers and crowdfunding communities during a Kickstarter campaign can
influence studio strategy and more specifically approaches to game design. Such
instances of studios disrupting carefully conceived plans in response to such interactions
might be seen as reflective of producers having embraced the ethos of co-creativity that
much of the video game industry prohibits, yet which crowdfunding processes enable.
But developers'modifications of development strategy during the campaign phase might
be simultaneously understood as pragmatically serving studios' economic interests. On
one hand, such changes permit studios to discursively position themselves during cam-
paigns as being highly responsive to Kickstarter community feedback (`we adapt'; `We
heard you guys'); such activity in turn has the potential to increase the attractiveness of
a studio to those many community members desiring a degree of involvement in a given
Smith 205
development process. As Hinterland Games' van Lierop (2013, personal communica-
tion) suggests, the promise of co-creation appears to be a key factor motivating financial
contributions to video game projects; `Backers are ... pledging to feel like they are part
of the process of creating the game', he observes. By taking clear actions in response to
feedback received during a campaign phase, studios clearly signal their openness to co-
creative activities. On the other hand, it is ­ in certain circumstances ­ the nature of the
particular change in development strategy itself that can serve a key economic purpose
during the campaign phase. In the case of République, for example, Camouflaj's specific
decision to develop for desktop computers, in addition to iOS devices, appears to have
been integral to the project reaching its funding target. The Kickstarter campaign had
struggled throughout much of its duration, but, according to Payton (2012), it was the
promise of desktop versions that reversed the campaign's fortunes `and pushed us over
the line'.8 At least in some cases, then, studios might regard specific alterations to devel-
opment plans ­ in response to the demands of a crowdfunding community ­ as steps
highly necessary to achieving funding goals.
The case of République, together with that of Shadowrun Online, furthermore indi-
cates the potential for crowdfunding communities to exert a high level of control over a
project's direction within a given campaign phase; this appears to be especially the case
if a campaign is struggling to meet its funding target. Via the conventional publisher
model, prospective players typically have no direct input regarding decisions related to
intended hardware platform or revenue model. Publishers will instead typically form
their decisions on the basis of sales data. Yet, in the crowdfunding space, prospective
players have been able to induce fundamental changes in studio strategy with regard to
these issues, essentially establishing a project's boundaries for the post-campaign phase.
This high degree of agency whereby backers or potential backers can dictate the fun-
damental directions a project takes should not be considered typical within co-creative
practices. With regard to the production of user-generated content, for example, both
Kerr (2013) and Andrew Mactavish (2008) observe the tight control that publishers are
able to exert over the creative agency of its consumers (for instance, through publishers'
ownership and modification of such content). However, as John Banks and Jason Potts
(2010) argue, player agency as part of co-creative processes is not always constrained
within a rigid publisher-imposed framework. There are instead, they observe (Banks and
Potts, 2010), circumstances in which the `consumer is an agent, able to make a deal' (p.
257). République and Shadowrun Online's respective campaign phases provide exam-
ples of agency being exerted in such circumstances.
The cycle of communication between studio and crowdfunding community that typi-
fies the campaign phase usually carries over into the post-campaign phase. Studios of
Kickstarter-funded projects will likely issue written and video updates to their backers
via emails, social media and project page posts. Studios are indeed often obliged to do
so, as many Kickstarter projects during a campaign phase promise exclusive updates to
backers as reward for their patronage. Backers of successful Kickstarter campaigns, in
turn, often continue to offer ideas, opinions and criticisms to the studio via the same
channels of communication. But, as the following section discusses, the post-campaign
phase sees some studios and crowdfunding communities engage in different types of
interaction, as the former often looks to increase the latter's level of involvement with the
development process in various structured ways.
206 new media & society 17(2)
Backer­developer interaction: Post­campaign phase
In the post-campaign phase, developers often seek to harness feedback on a large scale,
with this often being achieved through the online polling of backers regarding aspects of
design. For example, the studio Comcept, as part of the Mighty No. 9 development,
invited its backer community to select from a number of options the costume design and
physical appearance of a particular in-game character (Karam et al., 2013). In other
cases, however, studios'polling of backers can be a far more in-depth process. In the case
of Frontier's Kickstarter-funded development of the space-travel simulator Elite:
Dangerous, for example, the studio solicited feedback concerning a wide range of fine
details, such as fuel consumption rates and the speed levels of particular flight modes, via
a series of 17 separate polls (Frontier, 2013).
In some instances, the practice of polling and surveying the community has resulted in
developers significantly shifting their approaches to content creation. This occurred, for
example, early in Cloud Imperium Games' development of its Kickstarter-funded space
trading and combat simulator Star Citizen.As part of a poll, the studio asked backers to each
select their preferred role within the `open-world'game, so as to discern the type of in-game
activities that players would gravitate towards. The category `explorer' topped the poll,
which motivated a change of approach within development. The studio had previously
assumed that players would prioritise combat-related gameplay, such as spaceship battles,
and so had been focussed on developing content that would be appropriate for such a prefer-
ence (Nutt, 2013). However, due to this poll result, the studio turned its attention to develop-
ing a greater amount of content for those players who wanted to explore the galaxies of the
game's fictional universe. According to Cloud Imperium Games' founder Chris Roberts
(Nutt, 2013), who worked previously at Microsoft and Electronic Arts, such significant
information regarding player preference would not have been known to the development
team had the studio been working via the conventional publisher model.
Despite Roberts' claim here regarding the deficiencies of the conventional model, pub-
lishers nevertheless do typically carry out various activities that bear similarity to these post-
campaign interactions that play out between backers and crowdfunded studios. Publishers,
for example, will often carry out in-house market research, as well as recruit specialist third-
party companies to conduct polls, surveys and focus groups (Kline et al., 2003: 202). But,
from Roberts'point of view, due to the often-large size of a given backer community and its
high engagement with a project, community feedback has the potential to be more useful
than that emerging from publisher-commissioned research. According to Roberts (Nutt,
2013), the Star Citizen community, for example, serves as a far superior focus group than
one that a publisher would traditionally put together. `Normally, at a publisher, you get a
recruited focus group and it's got 30 people in it', says Roberts (Nutt, 2013):
And who the hell knows if that's a good focus group for your game? But when you've got
100,000 or 200,000 people that love games, and they're willing to give you money before it's
ready, you've probably got a good focus group.
In addition to polling and surveying its community, using its feedback as a `barometer'
as Roberts (Bertz, 2013) puts it, crowdfunded studios sometimes involve backers in the
post-campaign phase by providing access to test builds. These `alpha'and `beta'versions of
Smith 207
a game are assembled prior to release, but studios will often grant backers access to them as
`reward' for their pledges. Backers are furthermore encouraged to feed back opinions to
developers formed on the basis of their own experiences with the test builds, which can lead
to developers reworking aspects of design. The post-campaign phase of development studio
Big Robot's first-person stealth game Sir, You Are Being Hunted serves as an example of
such processes.According to Big Robot's founder Jim Rossignol (2013, personal communi-
cation), backer feedback concerning the game's alpha code influenced changes regarding
`user experience elements'. One such change relates to how the game signals to players the
location and artificial intelligence state of enemy non-playing characters (NPCs). As part of
the game's fiction, enemy NPCs take the form of robot hunters that track the player-charac-
ter across a rural landscape. Within the initial alpha build, players were only able to identify
the presence and AI behavioural state of those robots out of view by way of audio cues.
However, following concern from some backers that this aspect of design led to a game that
was perhaps too challenging, as well as one prohibitive towards the hard of hearing, Bad
Robot added optional `visual indicators' to the user interface. These indicators signal to
players the location of robots that might be obscured by buildings or hills, as well as alert
players via symbols to changes in robot AI states, such as when a robot spots a player and
approaches them. Rossignol (2013, personal communication) confirms that such usability
changes were dependent on backer input gleaned via players' engagement with Sir's alpha
build. `Decisions such as these would never have been made it if had been left to us', he said
(2013, personal communication), `and we've had to be told by a number of players that such
changes were required'.
The practice of providing backers with access to alpha and beta versions furthermore
assists the development studio's quality assurance (QA) testing procedure, which aims to
resolve any in-game bugs or glitches. For larger publisher-funded projects, it is often a com-
bination of a publisher's QAdepartment, a developer's dedicated QAteam, as well as groups
of temporary freelance testers, that carries out this process (Kline et al., 2003: 203). However,
for small independent development studios, of which many have recently turned to
Kickstarter for project financing, such dedicated personnel are often absent from the pro-
cess. Therefore, developers sometimes rely on those backers engaged with alpha and beta
builds to report any programming errors.9 Because of the nature of certain game design
concepts, such player input can be invaluable, as has been the case, for example, with the
development of Sir You Are Being Hunted. One of the title's core design features is its pro-
cedurally generated game world, which ensures that each play through of the game gener-
ates a unique version of the landscape. This variability of game world made it extremely
difficult for Big Robot's small team to track bugs across myriad variations in level design.
As Rossignol observes (2013, personal communication), `An issue might appear one in a
thousand generations, and if only three of us are generating levels, we'll never see it'.
However, the project's large community of backers essentially provided a QA solution to
this challenge. Notes Rossignol (2013, personal communication):
If five thousand people are generating levels then the chances of spotting serious issues are
increased, and in that way the backers getting early access and examining the game as it's being
worked on ends up improving the end result.
208 new media & society 17(2)
In the post-campaign phase, then, backers often continue to serve a role in develop-
ment, taking on dual roles as volunteer playtesters and sounding boards for studio ideas.
In these cases, Kickstarter backers have not only fully or part financed development but
they are also freely performing particular and necessary production tasks, which ­ via the
conventional publisher model ­ would typically require payment. For some developers,
it is this arrangement whereby a community of backers can contribute en masse to devel-
opment within the post-campaign phase that makes crowdfunding an especially attrac-
tive source of financing. This is the view of veteran video game developer Peter
Molyneux, for example, whose studio 22Cans received Kickstarter backing for its `god
game'Godus. According to Molyneux, the Kickstarter process represents an opportunity
to not only gain funding but also harness the input capacity of a community of backers in
the post-campaign phase. Molyneux (nofi, 2012) indeed suggests that the developer con-
figured its campaign with this aim in mind, ensuring that all but the lowest value cam-
paign pledge tiers provided backers with access to the Godus alpha and beta builds.
According to Molyneux (nofi, 2012):
The real secret to making games is simple: you get as many people you can to play the game
for as long as possible as you develop ... Kickstarter is not just about getting money it's about
truly involving people in a structured way to make the best experience.
Such examples of interaction between backers and studios during the post-campaign
phase do not, however, characterise all Kickstarter-funded development projects. In
some cases, studios are less inclined to firmly integrate backers into the development
process, as was the case with Camouflaj during the post-campaign development phase of
République, for example. As Payton (2013, personal communication) acknowledges,
`Our communication with our backers is most often one-way. We reply to all the mes-
sages that come in, but we haven't put a lot of focus on creating a forum for back-and-
forth with the community'. The studio's decision not to rely on backer input during this
period appears to have been down to two related reasons. First, the studio did not view
République, which was in part conceived as a carefully structured narrative experience,
as being a type of game that would especially benefit from a co-creative process; second,
the studio did not regard the co-creative process as being compatible with the studio aim
of maintaining a strong degree of institutional authorship over this narrative experience.
Says Payton (2013, personal communication):
It's not that we don't care what the community has to say, but rather, I think it's because of
the type of project we're developing. For a strategy or multiplayer game like Godus, I think
it makes a lot of sense to have a constant stream of dialogue between the development team
and the backers ... Due to the narrative-focus of République and our team's desire (from the
very beginning) to break away from large companies and just make the game we've always
wanted to make, we haven't reached out to the community for design feedback as much as
other projects.
Payton (Reynolds, 2013) further stresses that key design challenges Camouflaj faced
during development, which related to République's unique touch-screen gameplay, were
Smith 209
not challenges that the game's backers were well equipped to assist with. He observes,
`We knew we couldn't rely on [backers] to help us solve complex design problems that
even our veteran crew was fighting to solve'.
The case of République is instructive in considering the relationship between backers
and studios as part of the post-campaign phase. It indicates that the variability of project
type, as well as developers' particular attitudes towards the creative process, can inform
the extent to which these two groups interact. More generally, the other cases featured
within this section suggest that backer input within this phase can be highly structured.
In various crowdfunded development processes discussed here, backers furthermore
served roles that have analogues within more conventional development practice. The
Star Citizen backer community was utilised as a superior focus group within the game's
development (but as a focus group nonetheless). The Sir You Are Being Hunted backer
community, meanwhile, has performed a role comparable to that of a QA department.
The top-down structures imposed in the post-campaign phase thus contrast with the
backer­developer power dynamic of the campaign phase, whereby crowdfunding com-
munities have the potential to insist on significant changes in development (as in the
cases of République and Shadowrun Online). By setting the terms by which co-creativity
occurs within the post-campaign phase, developers ensure that backer input becomes
part of the wider co-creative practice of what Mactavish (2008) labels `authorized pro-
duction'. But while developers'control over the nature of backer input might weaken the
agency of crowdfunding communities, it does not necessarily lessen the impact that their
input has on a project's creative direction. The case of Star Citizen community poll-
results motivating Cloud Imperium Games to generate a raft of new in-game content, for
example, indeed indicates that the potential for backer influence persists within the post-
campaign phase.
Conclusion
This article reveals how co-creativity within video game development plays out
within the crowdfunding space. It highlights ways in which these processes depart
from conventional practices carried out in publisher-funded production. While direct
communication between studios and prospective players during development is,
under the purview of publishers, often limited, interaction between these two social
groups is ongoing from the early stages of development in the crowdfunding sphere.
This article shows how communications between studios and prospective players dur-
ing crowdfunding campaigns can instigate significant shifts concerning proposed pro-
ject details, as was the case with the République and Shadowrun Online campaigns.
The campaign phase is thus not only a period in which a studio looks to secure fund-
ing for its development project and form a community around it; this is also a period
in which developers and prospective players can negotiate and contest the parameters
of a project. In the post-campaign phase, as the article further indicates, studios often
organise their production so as to channel backer communities' input in highly struc-
tured ways. Soliciting feedback from backers via polls, and recruiting backers as test-
ers, studios often ensure that crowdfunding communities serve important roles
throughout the development process.

While this study reveals a range of insights concerning the relationship between
development studios and backer communities, further scholarship is necessary regarding
video game development in the crowdfunding space. Gaining perspectives on additional
aspects of this industrial process ­ including social groups other than studios and backers
­ would be a useful next step. Research into how studios balance the need of backers
with, for example, those of the professional investors that are increasingly contributing
additional funding to crowdfunded projects might be advantageous.10 Attention might
also be given to the strategies studios deploy so as to ensure that their content will be
appropriate for a wider gaming audience on release, while simultaneously satisfying
their core crowdfunding community. Such lines of enquiry would help establish a more
detailed understanding concerning the specificities of the crowdfunding model and its
implications to video game production.
Taking a wider perspective on the rise of digital crowdfunding, further research is also
required to understand the implications of crowdfunding processes for backers ­ academic
work that would benefit from the interviewing of crowdfunding community members. As
this article acknowledges, the interactions between development studios and backer com-
munities form part of a far larger field of co-creativity involving media companies and
media users. Yet the requirement for backers to contribute money directly to development
distinguishes crowdfunded processes from many other examples of co-creativity. While a
modder or a fan fiction writer or message board user might willingly enable media compa-
nies to profit from their activities without receiving any payment in return, crowdfunding
communities are in addition often paying for the opportunity to function as free labour.
Despite serving as the financial impetus for many development projects, backers are further-
more not only without ownership of content they have helped finance, but they are also
without monetary protection should a funded video game project go on to be cancelled
(Gera, 2012). Detailed consideration of the specificities of digital crowdfunding, and the
implications of these specific features for crowdfunding communities, is thus necessary to
further inform wider debates concerning the role of users in media production.
Funding
This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial or
not-for-profit sectors.
Notes
 1. Payton (Reynolds, 2013) speculates that, without financial backing from the Kickstarter com-
munity, the game `would never have seen the light of day'.
 2. The three original interviews were conducted via email Q&A. The three interviewees were
Ryan Payton, co-founder of Camouflaj, which developed République (interview conducted,
29 October 2013); Jim Rossignol, founder of Big Robot, which developed Sir, You Are Being
Hunted (interview conducted, 7 January 2014); and Raphael van Lierop, creative director of
Hinterland Games, which is currently developing The Long Dark (interview conducted, 21
November 2013).
 3. The developer Rockstar North, for example, carried out maintenance on the online compo-
nent of Grand Theft Auto V so as to curb the player practice of creating and disseminating
counterfeit in-game money (Makuch, 2014).
Smith 211
 4. For example, online player protests regarding the narrative conclusion of Mass Effect 3 led
to its developer BioWare producing downloadable content that augments the original ending
(Their, 2012).
 5. This line of thinking regarding video game production parallels theoretical moves within the field
to understand video games not as permanent objects but rather as continual processes (Malaby,
2007) or as changeable cultural facilities (Consalvo, 2009) that alter via player engagement.
 6. Philippe Ross (2014) considers in depth the theoretical implications of this practice whereby
media producers conceptualise an intended audience absent from production processes.
 7. Whether or not this and other discussed features are ultimately implemented within the desktop
versions of République remains to be seen. At the time of writing, while the iOS version of the
game has been released, the PC and Mac versions are still in development, with the Camouflaj
team yet to determine the precise direction that the project will take (Crecente, 2014).
 8. Data bear this view out, with approximately half of the project backers signalling their inten-
tion to play the game on desktop versions (Payton, 2012).
 9. The use of player communities as unpaid testers is not, however, a practice restricted to crowd-
funded projects. In the case of online multiplayer games, developers often recruit user communi-
ties to beta test content. See Banks (2002), Kerr (2002: 290) and Taylor (2006b: 155).
10. Warhorse studios' Kingdom Come: Deliverance (in development) is one such example of a
project being funded by a combination of crowdfunding and private investment (Hart, 2014).
