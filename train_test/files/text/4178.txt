Abstract
Sociology has focused predominantly upon `collective memories' and their impact on social
continuity and change, while relegating individual memories to the status of an empirical data
resource for research on experiences and identity construction or maintenance. This article
suggests, however, that sociology has overlooked the part individual memories play in social
production. It applies a post-anthropocentric, new materialist ontology, in which bodies, things,
social formations, ideas, beliefs and memories can all possess capacities to materially affect and be
affected. To explore the part that personal memory can play in producing the present and hence
the future, data from in-depth interviews in a study of adults' food decision-making and practices
are reported. Personal memories deriving from earlier events affect current food practices, and
these contribute to the materiality of people's consumption of food stuffs. The article concludes
by reflecting on the wider importance of personal memory for sociological inquiry and memory
studies.

Introduction
Though there is a substantive sociological literature on `collective memories' (Conway,
2010; Olick and Robbins, 1998), this article invites sociology to take seriously the
material role that personal memories1 (Assmann, 2008: 109) and remembering play in

producing and sustaining the social world from moment to moment (a process to which
we shall refer subsequently as `social production'). It addresses this issue by the applica-
tion of a new materialist and post-human sociology that acknowledges the `materiality'
of memories, supplying to them a capacity to materially affect the world (just as they are
themselves affected by events). It sets out propositions for the study of personal memory
and social production in terms of the micropolitical affectivity of remembering and for-
getting, and illustrates and explores these via empirical data on how memory and remem-
bering affect people's everyday food choices. More generally, the article will thereby aim
to re-balance the emphasis within the sociology of memory that has privileged `collec-
tive' at the expense of personal memories (Conway, 2010: 445; Olick, 2008: 153) in its
understanding of continuity and change in the social world. It will consequently also
seek to cut across barriers that treat individual memories as the territory of psychology
and the collective that of sociology.
After a brief review of how sociology has engaged with issues around memory and
remembering, the article sets out a new materialist framework for re-thinking what mem-
ory does sociologically. To illustrate this argument, we turn then to the specific topic of
food preferences and choices, and report data from a study in which respondents reflect
upon the influences on what food they currently consume or prefer. We assess from a
materialist perspective how personal memories affect current food preferences, and then
conclude by discussing more generally the key part that personal memories play in pro-
ducing the social world from moment to moment.
Memory in Social Research
Zerubavel (1995: 283­284) has suggested that psychologists' interests in memory have
been individualistic: both in terms of the physiological processes involved in how
humans remember past events, and with the specific memories of individuals, typically
as these bear upon mental health. Sociologists by contrast have been cautious about per-
sonal memories, regarding them either as subjective representations of the social world
with an unclear relationship to the `reality' of past events ­ as has been demonstrated in
psychoanalysis and psychological studies of `false memories' (Schacter et al., 2011), or
as ultimately socially produced anyway (Erll, 2008: 5). The proper concerns of sociol-
ogy, Jedlowsi (2001) argues, are the social `frameworks' that give meaning to personal
memories; collective memories; and cultural attitudes towards memory. Personal memo-
ries have consequently been given less weight, and have been treated primarily as empir-
ical data resources to enable researchers to glean information on respondents'experiences
(Jedlowsi, 2001: 31) or as constitutive of stories/narratives people use in identity con-
struction or maintenance (Jedlowsi, 2001: 33, see also Squire, 2008).
Memory was accorded little attention in classical sociology (Olick and Robbins,
1998: 107), with the exception of Durkheim's disciple Halbwachs, who developed and
researched the concept of collective memory (1992 [1950]), as an antidote to psycholo-
gy's individualistic focus. He argued that individuals remember the past only in the con-
text of membership of a specific group, community or other social body (Connerton,
1989: 36; Conway, 2010: 443). Collective memory may be defined as the `social repre-
sentations concerning the past, which each group produces, institutionalizes, guards and
Fox and Alldred 3
transmits through the interaction of its members' (Jedlowsi, 2001: 33). As such, it pro-
vides a means for these groups to establish distinctive social identities and differentiate
themselves from others (Neiger et al., 2011: 3). It follows that collective memories can
possess a `political' objective (Neiger et al., 2011: 4) that personal memories do not.
The ascendancy of collective memory within sociology may be seen against the back-
cloth of the discipline's `cultural turn' (Coser, 1992; Friedland and Mohr, 2004; Miller,
1998: 3) and the emergence of constructionism and post-structuralism (Gannon, 2008;
Klein, 2000: 128; Olick and Robbins, 1998: 108; Shahzad, 2011) that explored the part
that meanings, symbols and cultural framings played within social processes and institu-
tions and in the social construction of events, experiences and identities. Collective
memory has become a dominant research concern of the sociology of memory and
`memory studies', where studies have explored collective processes of remembering and
forgetting in material structures and practices such as museums, memorials, ceremonies
and traditions (Connerton, 1989; Langenbacher, 2010; Zerubavel, 1995); in material cul-
ture (Jones, 2007; Morton, 2007; Schlunke, 2013); the media (Hibberd and Tew-
Thompson, 2016; Neiger et al., 2011), and embodied practices such as military drill or
ritual behaviour (Connerton, 1989: 68).
This sociological and relational emphasis focused studies of memory upon how the
social world produces specific collective memories (Zerubavel, 1995), addressing tem-
porality by linking remembered pasts to the lived present and the imagined future
(Conway, 2010: 443). Collective remembering and forgetting has been implicated in the
transmission of `culture' from past to present (Olick and Robbins, 1998: 108); in the
macropolitics of how states establish adherence to political doctrines such as `democ-
racy' or `communism' (Connerton, 1989: 41­42; Meyer, 2008); and in the emergence of
`individual', group and `national' identities (Lee, 2000; Olick and Robbins, 1998: 122­
126; Sutton, 2008b). Human geography, meanwhile, has also addressed the interactions
between collective memories, space and landscapes (Foote and Azaryahu, 2007; Jones,
2011: 877­878).
Within this body of work, some scholars of collective memory have addressed the
relationship with materiality, exploring how memories are mediated by material cultures,
particularly within museums, monuments and buildings.2 Sturken (2016) explored how
material remnants housed in the 9/11 Memorial Museum have reconstituted New York's
Twin Towers as Ground Zero, with a new narrative concerning loss, grief and terrorism.
Similarly, Bach (2016) suggests that the various memorial sites and `tourist experiences'
established after the fall of the former Berlin Wall serve both to conserve memories of
the past and to produce a number of distinct and sometimes contradictory narratives for
the present (variously around democracy, globalisation, consumption, creativity). The
`Island of Ireland' Peace Park in Belgium is a monument whose design and use aims to
mobilise specific memories of the past `in order to intervene in the political discourses of
the present' (Poulter, 2017).
These sociological studies typically establish material objects as constitutive of mem-
ories. However, further steps are needed to explore the memory/matter connection. First,
all the studies we have just mentioned, and many others like them, retain sociology's
focus upon collective memories and memorialisation ­ shared sites of memory ­ and do
not venture into the interactions between `personal' memories and matter. Second, we
4 Cultural Sociology 00(0)
want to query the implied directionality of the interaction between matter and memory/
remembering. If, as Jedlowski (2000: 30) notes, `recalling and forgetting, selecting and
processing'are pervasive in most walks of life, then what are the material effects of these
memories in the present? To explore this further, we take advantage of the post-anthro-
pocentric ontology of the new materialisms, in which thoughts, emotions and memories
have capacity to materially affect.
A (New) Materialist Perspective on Memory
In the humanities and social sciences, new materialism refers to a range of perspectives
that have in common a `turn to matter' (as opposed to the focus upon texts and language
in post-structuralism) that emphasises the materiality of the world and everything ­ social
and natural ­ within it. Drawing on a very wide range of disparate philosophical, feminist
and social theory perspectives (Coole and Frost, 2010: 5; Fox and Alldred, 2017; Lemke,
2015), the new materialisms recognise materiality as plural and complex, uneven and
contingent, relational and emergent (Coole and Frost, 2010: 29). Unlike Marxist sociolo-
gy's `historical materialism' that considered an economic base as the foundational driver
for social relations, new materialists consider that the world and history are produced by
a wide range of material forces that extend from the physical and the biological to the
psychological, social and cultural (Barad, 1996: 181; Braidotti, 2013: 3).
The ontology advocated by new materialist scholars has been described as `flat' or
`monist' (as opposed to `dualist'), rejecting differences not only between Marx's (1971)
conception of `base' and `superstructure', but also between `natural' and `cultural'
realms, human and non-human, and ­ perhaps most significantly for this article ­ between
mind and matter (van der Tuin and Dolphijn, 2010). By challenging any distinction
between the materiality of the physical world and the social constructs of human thoughts
and desires, it opens up the possibility to explore their material interactions, and how
things other than humans (for instance, a tool, a technology or even an idea) can be social
`agents', making things happen. New materialist sociology consequently shifts humans
from centre stage, to engage productively not only with human culture but also with
other living things, and with the wider environment of inanimate matter. This `flat ontol-
ogy' (DeLanda, 2005: 51) re-focuses attention toward `events': the endless cascade of
material interactions of both nature and culture that together produce the world and
human history, and away from structural or systemic `explanations' of how societies and
cultures work (Latour, 2005: 130). Exploring the relational character of events and their
physical, biological and expressive composition becomes the sole means for sociology to
explain the continuities, fluxes and `becomings' that produce the world around us.
To develop the features of a sociological new materialism, we draw upon the well-
developed and widely applied conceptual framework deriving from Gilles Deleuze's
(1988) materialist reading of Spinoza, as developed in the work of Deleuze and Guattari
(1984, 1988), by social and feminist scholars such as Braidotti (2006), DeLanda (2006),
Grosz (1994) and Thrift (2004), and then applied in empirical social science by Alldred
and Fox (2015), Duff (2010), Fox et al. (2018), Renold and Ringrose (2011), Youdell and
Armstrong (2011) and others. This DeleuzoGuattarian approach is predicated upon three
propositions, concerning relationality, agency and micropolitical capacities.
Fox and Alldred 5
First, new materialism asserts the fundamental relationality of all matter: bodies,
things and social formations gain their apparent `is-ness' only through their relationship
to other similarly contingent and ephemeral bodies, things and ideas (Deleuze, 1988:
123; Haraway, 1991: 201). Actions and events are assemblages (Deleuze and Guattari,
1988: 88) of these relations that develop `in a kind of chaotic network of habitual and
non-habitual connections, always in flux, always reassembling in different ways' (Potts,
2004: 19). For instance, a `sexuality-assemblage'(Fox andAlldred, 2013) accrues around
an event such as an erotic kiss, which comprises not just relations between pairs of lips
but also physiological processes, personal and cultural contexts, aspects of the setting,
sexual codes and norms of conduct, and ­ importantly for this article ­ memories of past
experiences (as well as many other relations specific to that particular kiss-event). The
relations within assemblages may be identified from sources including empirical data,
research literature and our knowledge and understanding of the social and natural world.
Second, a conventional conception of (human) agency is replaced with the Spinozist
notion of affect (Deleuze, 1988: 101), meaning simply a capacity to affect or be affected.
An affect is a `becoming' (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 256) that represents a physical,
psychological, emotional or social change of state or capacities of an entity (Massumi,
1988: xvi). All matter has an `agential' capacity to affect, rather than being inert clay
moulded by human agency, consciousness and imagination (Barad, 1996: 181; Coole and
Frost, 2010: 2): this assessment de-privileges human agency as the means by which the
social world is produced and reproduced. Affects produce further affective capacities
within assemblages (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 400), and because one affect can produce
more than one capacity, social production is a branching, coalescing and rupturing (rather
than linear) flow. Clough (2004: 15) describes this complex flow as an `affect economy'.
Third, analysis of this relational ontology is necessarily micropolitical ­ at the level
of assemblages, affects and capacities, as opposed to exterior forces, structures or sys-
tems.Affects within assemblages act on bodies, things and social formations to alter their
capacities ­ what they can do (Duff, 2010: 625). Affect economies may limit bodies and
things within existing capacities or even close these down ­ a process of specification or
`territorialisation' (Deleuze and Guattari, 1988: 88­89), or open up new possibilities
(capacities) in them (generalisation or `de-territorialisation'). Deleuze and Guattari
argued (1988: 294) that memories are territorialising forces that will tend to shift bodies
into habit and repetition.
This non-essentialist relational ontology suggests a framework for how we might con-
ceptualise the materiality of memory. To explore this, consider again the example of a
kiss mentioned a moment ago. We may imagine that a qualitative research study has
generated an analysis of a `kiss-assemblage' between two humans A and B on a second
date. This reveals (in no particular order) the following relations:
A's lips ­ B's lips ­ social and sexual norms ­ A and B's personal attributes (e.g. physical
appearance, personality, job) ­ dating conventions ­ immediate material contexts ­ past
experiences and circumstances
These relations assemble because of the affects between them (for instance, the affective
power of A's appearance upon B's mind and body, or the impact of dating conventions
6 Cultural Sociology 00(0)
that require a kiss at the end of a second romantic date). In our imagined study of first
kisses, we might expect to learn from interviews with A and B precisely how `past expe-
riences and circumstances' might affect a kiss positively or negatively. They might
describe how what happened during their dates, or how memories of past encounters
with other people (including sexual partners) gave significance to, or added or reduced
the pleasure provided by the kiss.
From this we may conjecture that memories can materially affect bodies, things and
social processes, and it is partly the memories that individuals bring to events that link
these events across time and space, in the process producing both social continuities and
change. These past experiences are not of course materially present within the current
kiss-event, but have a virtual presence via rememberings of earlier events, along with
other virtual affects such as expectations, imaginations, fantasies and ideas. It is these
rememberings (which may or may not be accurate representations of the events upon
which they were based) that contribute affectively ­ alongside many other assembled
relations ­ to event-assemblages (whether in the relatively trivial example of a kiss or in
other events), making that event-assemblage do whatever it does.
However the relational ontology of the new materialist perspective has some further
implications for theorising the materiality of memories. From such an ontological posi-
tion, `memories' should not be considered as pre-existing, essential entities with fixed
attributes. Rather, remembering and forgetting are processual and contingent: in terms of
their initial production during past events; in terms of the effects they may have in the
present; and finally in terms of how subsequent events may affect how they are remem-
bered or forgotten.3 More formally, we may summarise the perspective that new materi-
alism brings to understanding memory, remembering and forgetting in the following
three propositions.
1. When human bodies are assembled in a present event, memory traces of past
events are materially affective, entering into the `affect economy' of the present.
2. Memory production (`memorising') is relational and contingent. Though events
leave a corporeal, cognitive and/or emotional trace upon a body, we cannot know
in advance what memory-traces an event will generate.
3. Because memories interact with many other relations in an event-assemblage, we
cannot predict what effects remembering/forgettings will have within a particular
assemblage.
It is these propositions that we set out to explore in the following empirical illustration.
Studying Food and Memory
Social science studies suggest that food is an important `site' of memory (Sutton, 2008a:
176) in which memories mediate social and cultural values and norms that impact on iden-
tity, cultural continuity and sense of belonging (de Certeau et al., 1998: 188­189; Holtzman,
2006). Lupton (1994) found that students'childhood memories of food were linked strongly
to family relationships and the rituals of shared mealtimes and the emotions associated with
them. These memories could be more powerful in food choice than rational criteria (Lupton,
Fox and Alldred 7
1994: 682, see also Köster, 2009). In an era of uncertainty, Duruz (1999: 250) suggested,
food memories from the 1950s and 1960s supplied Australians with a skein of cultural
resources with which to construct `imaginary places of stability and security' to sustain fin
de siecle identities. However, recollections of past collective meals among Greek islanders
served not only as nostalgia but as `prospective memories'­ cues to initiate practical prepa-
rations for forthcoming meal events (Sutton, 2008a: 163).
Other studies document more individual consequences of food memories. Analysis of
data from a 1982 Mass Observation survey (Uprichard et al., 2013) found various `food
hates' (for foodstuffs such as tripe, milk puddings or jellied eels) grounded in memories,
predominantly from schooldays or childhood. Some of these had endured since child-
hood, while other respondents now enjoyed foods they had disliked when younger. In a
study of memories of forced food consumption during childhood, a survey of US college
students found that most episodes were recalled as powerfully negative, with 72 per cent
saying they would not willingly eat the foodstuff today (Batsell et al., 2002). Veterans
exposed to Asian food during active service in the Pacific during the Second World War
had less favourable opinions of Chinese and Japanese food than those who had fought in
the European theatre (Wansink et al., 2009).
The challenge of researching memory from a materialist perspective is to apply meth-
ods and methodology sensitised to the affective capacities of memories upon present
events. We report data from a qualitative study that set out to explore food decision-
making and associated practices among families living in the north of England. A sample
of 45 adult participants was drawn from the ranks of the South Yorkshire Cohort.4
Sampling was random, but stratified according to body weight and family income, based
on BMI and Index of Multiple Deprivation scores, to provide 15 `low deprivation obese',
15 `high deprivation obese' and 15 `high deprivation normal body weight' respondents,
though in this article we do not differentiate on these variables. NHS ethics approval was
granted for the original cohort study, with subsequent ethics approval for this study
obtained from the University of Sheffield.
Most participants were interviewed twice. The first interview used the `free associa-
tion narrative' approach of Hollway and Jefferson (2000: 53) to elicit past and present
narratives around food and associated practices. This methodology is well suited to the
purposes of new materialist analysis, as it can provide rich evidence of the physical,
social and psychological relations in event-assemblages. The second interview applied a
more structured approach, to follow up and probe themes that emerged in the first inter-
view associated with food practices.
Methodologically, new materialism shifts focus from human agents to human/non-
human assemblages, attending to the material effects of bodies, things, social formations
and other affective relations, including memories (see Fox and Alldred, 2015 for more on
this analytical approach). For this article, analysis of data focused specifically upon
memories associated with food consumption and preferences (though for one respondent
we document multiple relations in her `food assemblage'). Transcripts were trawled for
examples where respondents explicitly described how food experiences in the past
affected subsequent food events, attitudes or interactions, with the assistance of NVivo
data management software. No attempt was made by the analyst to inductively link
reports of past food-related events in one part of the interviews to their reports of present
8 Cultural Sociology 00(0)
food choices in another, or to use as data discussions by respondents of third parties'past
and present food choices. In the report of findings that follows, respondents are identified
only by number; quotations are referenced using a notation in which, for example, the
reference (1.2) means respondent 1, second interview.
Study Findings
In this section we consider the data from this study in terms of the three propositions on
the materiality of memories set out earlier.
Proposition 1. Memories are Materially Affective, Entering into the `Affect
Economy' of the Present
Data suggest that memories could be materially affective, influencing present food
events in various ways. One respondent in the study ­ who worked as a school cook ­
described how immediate recollection of her work influenced her daily food choices at
home later the same day.
And I think sometimes when I'm ordering at work, ordering say like the meats and produce that
I order, that I use for work, for cooking, I'll come home and because in the back of me head I'll
be thinking right I've got mince in at work that was saved for lasagne or for mince pie, whatever
I've ordered it for. And so in the back of me head I'm going home and I'll think what can we
have for tea and I'll go in freezer and there'll be mince there and I'll go, oh we'll have a lasagne.
But it's because I've ordered it from work, you know what I mean, and it's just like the seed's
there in the back of your mind and you just think. So it does influence you. (23.2)
In addition to this `cognitive' remembering, this respondent also gave an example of a
corporeal or embodied memory, sometimes described as a `habit-memory' (Connerton,
1989: 23): a memory that has been so frequently reinforced by repetition that it has a
powerful embodied affect on subsequent events.
I can just knock stuff up. I don't weigh a pound. Very rare. Very rare I weigh a pound because
I just look at it and think yeah, that's right, and I just throw it all together. And I can do that, you
know. But I think a lot of that comes with weighing up 8oz of something for 30 years, you know
what 8oz looks like, you know. (23.2)
Few food memories in the study were cognitive and corporeal, however. The overwhelm-
ing majority of food memories offered by respondents linked past food experiences to
positive or negative reactions or emotions. Thus the following two respondents described
remembered likes and dislikes associated with specific foodstuffs, and ­ in the second
extract ­ how this affected meal-preparation decisions.
I do like pork and nobody ever cooks it like my mum cooked it, and she always did it with
crackling and that was always gorgeous. ... I do like lots of seafood but things, I don't like
things like octopus, calamari, stuff like that. But I don't mind the fish, different fish, I like skate
and I like plaice, bream, anything like that. (26.2)
Fox and Alldred 9
We don't experiment no, we tend to know what we like, or at the moment we tend to rely upon
what we've had previously and heavily depend on that we're going to get through an evening
meal okay. (2.2)
Some foods were associated with bad memories from earlier in life. The following dem-
onstrates how a negative food memory from childhood continued to affect present
responses to specific foods.
I think it was powdered egg they'd used and there was always this rumour that it was stock left
from the Second World War. Now whether that was true or not, maybe not, but it certainly I
think it was powdered egg. And I still have problems eating scrambled egg. (10.2)
For respondent 2, one negative experience could be enough to prevent him even tasting
a foodstuff again
.
I mean I suppose ultimately if I've tasted something for a first time, and then I didn't enjoy it,
you've always got the safeguard of just literally just pushing it away from you and saying no
I've tasted that, I'll have something else. ... I think it was a question of that maybe an early
experience put me off and ... I'm entrenched in that old fashioned belief that no, no, once bitten
twice shy, I'm not going up that path again. (2.2)
Proposition 2. Memory Production (Memorising) is Relational and
Contingent: We Do Not Know What Memories an Event will Generate
Though the previous examples suggest that sometimes it could be simply the recall of an
unpleasant taste or other experience of a foodstuff that affected present food decisions,
often the data in this study indicated a more complex process surrounding how food
memories had been generated in the first place. For the following respondents, food
memories were highly contextual. Negative responses to spaghetti Bolognese and
chicken soup respectively were not reactions to the taste of the food, but rather that their
frequent serving during childhood had turned them off, so they felt they had `had enough'
of that particular meal.
So every time my dad said `I'll cook', it was always spaghetti Bolognese, that's the only thing
he can cook. ... It's some old family recipe of my dad's side, that my dad's, I don't know where
he's got it from, from them, but it's a version of spag bol. ... Heavily laced in garlic and onions,
yeah. You can smell it and taste it for days. My mum tends to, when he offers to cook; she'll be
like `no you're all right. I've had enough of spaghetti'. (24.2)
My mum would boil leftovers and use stock, and obviously meat falls off don't it. So now I don't
eat, I eat chicken soup made in a tin but I wouldn't dream of making it myself. Because I ate it
enough when I was a kid, and we had it every Monday. Plus we had chicken every Sunday. (7.2)
Positive memories of foods might be more to do with the positively valorised events
within which the food was consumed. For the next respondent, a relatively unappetising
food has positive connotations with meals she had eaten with her father.
10 Cultural Sociology 00(0)
I used to like readymade fish pies, them Admiral's fish pies, and if there's half an ounce of fish
in them it's a miracle, you know, but it's just the taste of it. And I suppose because it reminds
me of me dad, and me dad used to eat it. And I just like the taste of it, and I'd quite happily buy
one of them.And they're cheap and they're nasty and they're about a pound a piece and nothing
to them at all. But I like them, you know, I just like the taste of it. And I think it's probably
because it reminds me of me dad. (23.2)
Respondent 16 claimed that she had not missed sweets, biscuits and crisps during her
childhood. Yet this lack may have generated an unconsidered affect that had had an unex-
pected and unintended consequence later in her life, when she was in charge of her own
diet.
We didn't have sweets and things in the house, no, chocolate and biscuits and stuff like that. ...
We never felt like we were missing out or anything; that was just the way it was. I thought it
was more strange to have them in the house than it was to not have them in the house, but then
the minute I could buy these things for myself I sort of went the other way and ended up eating
too many of them. (16.2)
For respondent 4, the timing of her Sunday family meal was based on a moral imperative
deriving from childhood valorisation of a ritual Sunday dinner.
Most of the time we have it [Sunday meal] at tea time, unless Gareth's mum's coming then we
had it at like half past one time, something like that. ... [As a child, we] used to always have it
dinner time [i.e. early evening], we always have a Sunday dinner. ... I think Sunday it's well
you should have a Sunday, it's Sunday dinner isn't it. (4.2)
Proposition 3. Memories Interact with Many Other Relations in an Event-
Assemblage, With Unpredictable Effects
The examples offered so far have sought to demonstrate how a memory associated with
food affected present food events. However, the data also reveal that the effects of food
memories were often caught up with many other material relations within a current food
event, so that the influence of the food memory might not be straightforward. For the
following respondent, sharing food events in the present were affected not only by her
own food-related memories, but also by the influence of her partner and his family, and
their material engagements with food.
I suppose food was, food's a big thing in Tom's side of the family, it's a big social event and
they enjoy their food, and they talk about food a lot, and the family centres around the table if
you like. And I'd say I was probably heavily influenced by that, because with my side of the
family, food's important but you eat to stop being hungry and you eat to be healthy and it's not,
you don't indulge in all this naughty food all the time. (28.2)
Sometimes the affectivity of memories was outweighed entirely. This respondent
described how the aroma of coffee persuaded her to try drinking it, despite previous
experiences.
Fox and Alldred 11
You go in Starbucks and it's like oh. I can remember once, I think it was when I was having him
[child], I had this thing about coffee. So I bought a jar of coffee, I'm like I'm going to drink it,
I really, the smell of it, and I drank it. After the first mouthful I spat it out. You know, that's
disgusting, it smells nice but it's disgusting. (4.1)
Earlier we noted how memories affected respondent 16's food consumption and choices.
However, analysis of the entirety of the two interviews with this respondent supplied an
opportunity to identify the wide range of relations that contributed to her present interac-
tions with food. In no particular order, the complex `food assemblage' of material rela-
tions may be summarised as:
husband ­ work ­ autistic son ­ foodstuffs ­ supermarkets ­ time ­ family members ­ health
­ body weight ­ money ­ cooking equipment ­ diet ­ slimming clubs ­ sugar ­ peer group ­
restaurants ­ memories of food and eating
These relations affected food choices in multiple, interacting ways. Thus for example,
food choices were affected by her son's very picky preferences that excluded many veg-
etables; by the food available in local retail outlets; by notions of `healthy eating'; by her
efforts to lose weight, the guidance provided by her slimming club and peer pressure
from other club members; and so forth. So while respondent 16 described the effects of
past eating experiences on food choices, the affectivity of her memories was always
assembled with many other affective forces. Similar analysis of other respondents' inter-
views could disclose their own unique food assemblages, within which the effects of
memories may play a greater or lesser part. Analysis of such assemblages demonstrates
that the affectivity of memories is always contextualised within a broader affect econ-
omy, deriving from multiple interacting relations.
Discussion
The data we have offered here provide an illustration of how past events, mediated via
personal memories, affect present behaviour, beliefs or attitudes concerning food choice.
While the fact that what we have eaten and enjoyed/disliked in the past affects what we
eat in the present may seem glaringly obvious, we would argue that it is of far wider
significance: for the sociological analysis of social production; for a materialist under-
standing of continuity and change; and for memory studies'perspective on collective and
personal memories. We will consider each of these in turn.
First, this insight into the part that personal memories play in producing the world and
history is important because it acknowledges that memories are not just an individual
record of people's movement through the events that make up their lives, but also are in
themselves a productive force that plays an important part in shaping our present and
future. As Yates notes,
Memory becomes accordingly both more and less mental and material, something that flows
through circuits, the affective product of a network. Memory happens, turns out to be transitive,
takes an object, requires a subject. But it also exceeds all its hosts, seeps in between and through
12 Cultural Sociology 00(0)
the join between beings to become more than anyone or anything bargained for. (Yates, 2016:
113)
This understanding of memory challenges the long-held sociological view that personal
memories are properly the domain of psychological inquiry, and that sociology should
limit its concerns to the sociocultural production of collective memory. A materialist
analysis reveals that personal memories are a key element in understanding the forces
that sustain continuities in the social world but also contribute to social transformations,
as elements within of the mix of affects that shape events. This formulation of memories
as affects cuts across the personal/collective memory dualism discussed earlier: it is
irrelevant to this analysis whether memories are `shared', or `personal'.
We may extend this insight further, into the realm of non-human memory. Animal
memories may affect social and economic events ­ for example, fishes' recall of their
breeding grounds will affect the fishery industry and the nation's diet; dogs' and cats'
recollections of their owners and their homes will affect human/animal interactions, pet
food retail and so on. Inanimate objects (statues, museums, buildings, photographs, art) or
social formations (ceremonies, traditions, rituals) can be regarded as `memorising' past
events, as of course do documents, photographs and media, and other physical records of
past events (Pinchevski, 2011). All may become affective relations within event-assem-
blages independent of human-mediated memories, and can be analysed as such.
Second, if doubts over the significance of memory for sociology persist, they are
brought into sharp focus for those who wish to embrace the monist or flattened ontology
(Fox and Alldred, 2017; Karakayali, 2015) of perspectives including post-structuralism,
feminist post-humanism and the new materialisms. Unlike historical materialism, struc-
turalism and critical realism, such perspectives operate without notions such as struc-
tures, systems or mechanisms working `behind the scenes' to produce and sustain the
world. Analysis instead must be `micropolitical', focusing entirely upon the processes
within events to explain the social world. This monism may appear as a limitation of this
perspective, rendering it unable to adequately explain social continuities and stabilities.
However, the analysis of personal memory in this article suggests how the past may
influence the present and future. Remembering (and forgetting), whether personal or
`collective', supplies the means for the past to influence current and future events, though
as we have seen these affects are unpredictable, and as the illustration showed, on occa-
sions positive past food experiences can transmute into negative forces upon current
food events.
At the same time, as we also noted, memories are just one element within any event;
consequently, their effects will be balanced out by many other affective relations, many
of which will favour novelty, discontinuity and change. Given that memories are not
perfect records of the past, but are modified by the contexts at the points of both memo-
rising and remembering, memories could never serve as a means to assure continuity ­
however much the architects of some collective remembering practices (statues,
monumental buildings) might wish. Nor may they be relied on to orchestrate change.
This leads us to the final area of significance: upon memory studies. We believe that
insight into the contribution of personal remembering (and forgetting) to social produc-
tion requires a rebalancing of memory studies away from collective memory toward the
Fox and Alldred 13
much more common and pervasive realm of personal memories. While the memorialisa-
tion of the past through the kinds of materialist events and objects discussed by scholars
of collective memories remains of sociological import, we need to begin to design stud-
ies that can explore the impact of personal memory upon social production, continuity
and change. This is a vast area of potential research, as personal memories encompass
cognitive reactions to events, emotional responses and corporeal sensations such as
pleasure or disgust,5 as well as habitual memory (Connerton, 1989) that range from the
most unconscious processes such as walking and eating, to reading and recalling simple
multiplication tables, to everyday embodied tasks such as driving a car or mastering
specialist tools or musical instruments. At the same time, this link between memory and
social production can reinvigorate studies of collective memory, to explore the affective
flows within events where collective memories may be invoked or mobilised alongside
personal memories. Examples ripe for such exploration in terms of memories (personal
and collective) and affects include popular uprisings, public mass grieving for celebrities
or major sporting events (Fox, 2013, 2015), to generate further insights into the complex
ways in which memories affect social processes.
These three consequences of a focus upon personal memory have methodological
implications. Many qualitative sociological studies are replete with data on respondents'
memories, yet these are usually treated simply as ways to get at the experiences or events
that a study wishes to investigate. Instead, we need to develop materialist research studies
that are designed to explore personal memories as affective, and use interviews and obser-
vations to reveal their part in producing continuity and/or change. Designs that will be
suited to this task will obviously include ethnography and qualitative interviews, but these
can usefully be augmented by surveys and perhaps social experiments, as well as more
creative approaches such as ambulatory interviews that can explore the memories trig-
gered by a neighbourhood, house or work-space; group explorations of memories; and
action research that attempts to use memories proactively to effect desired changes. Such
studies can begin to bridge the gap between sociology's focus on collective memory and
psychological studies of cognitive processes in remembering and forgetting, contributing
to the `post-disciplinarity' of the new materialisms (Taylor and Ivinson, 2013: 665).
To conclude, we have shown that from a materialist perspective, personal remember-
ing (and perhaps forgetting) must be taken seriously as a non-human force that affects the
production and sustaining of the social world, and a potent source of affectivity that link
events and assemblages across time and space. Personal and collective memories serve
as a virtual resource for social production, but their actualisation in events is unpredict-
able and unstable. Along with other psychic products ­ such as imaginations, dreams and
premonitions ­ memories permeate our lives and our social interactions. As such they
need to be acknowledged by sociology as contributory to how the social world unfolds,
and no longer treated simply as a means to gain access to respondents' backgrounds,
experiences or beliefs.

Notes
1. The term `personal memory' is used to describe a memory held by an individual person, as
opposed to a more widely held cultural or collective memory. We considered terming such
memories `individual'(Olick, 2008: 156), `mental'(Erll, 2008: 4) or `embodied', but all these
adjectives have problematic or ambiguous connotations. Wherever possible in this article
we avoid sustaining the personal/collective opposition and refer to `memory' without further
elaboration.
2. The journal Memory Studies devoted an issue to memory and materiality in 2016.
3. A more appropriate formulation might therefore speak of `remembering' and `forgetting' as
contextual processes. Subsequent uses of `memory' in this article should be understood in the
light of this qualification.
4. The South Yorkshire Cohort was funded by the National Institute of Health Research, and
comprises more than 22,000 patients recruited from 42 general practices in South Yorkshire
in 2010 who expressed willingness to participate in subsequent studies, including the research
that this article reports.
5. This adds a further dimension to recent explorations of the part emotions play in social pro-
duction (Fox, 2015).
