Introduction
Glomerular disease is one of the main causes of chronic
kidney disease (CKD) and either primary or secondary glo-
merular diseases, the common features of which are pro-
teinuria occurrence and foot processes fusion or loss.
Therefore, podocytes play a key role in the pathogenesis of
glomerular disease.1 In recent years, TRPC6 has been
determined to be the structural protein molecule positioned
in the slit diaphragm (SD) and closely related to the occur-
rence of proteinuria. The discovery of TRPC6 opens up a
new field for us to investigate podocyte injury, repair and
prevention at the molecular level. TRPC6 combines with
nephrin, podocin and CD2AP molecules to form a signal-
ing complex that maintains the structure and function integ-
rity of the SD, while playing an important role in the
mechanisms of podocyte injury and repair. FK506 is a new
generation of calcineurin inhibitors (CNI) used in the treat-
ment of kidney diseases and graft rejection by inhibiting
the activation of T cells, the proliferation of dependent B
cells on Th helper cells, and the expression of lymphokines
such as interleukin (IL)-2, IL-3 and -interferon, and IL-2R,
to induce immune inhibitory effects.2 A large number of
clinical studies demonstrated that FK506 significantly
reduced renal tissue damage and proteinuria in various kid-
ney diseases, and the in vitro studies3,4 also confirmed that
common distribution existed between FK506 ligand FKBP
and TRPC6, and bound with TRPC channel protein by the
Leu-Pro (LP) dipeptide, thus we inferred that FK506 may
interact with TRPC6. The application of FK506 to observe
its effect on TRPC6 expression and distribution in the dam-
aged glomerular podocytes has not been reported. In this
study, an angiotensin II (Ang II)-induced podocyte injury
model was used to observe the effect of TRPC6 in the pro-
cess of Ang II-induced apoptosis of mouse podocytes and
the effect of FK506 intervention on TRPC6 expression and

Abstract
Objective: This study investigated the protective effect of FK506 in podocytes and the correlation of TRPC6 with
podocyte injury repair.
Methods: MPC5 were cultured in vitro, parallel with the control group, an Ang II stimulation group, and an FK506
intervention group. The apoptosis rate with flow cytometry also detected TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression by RT-
PCR and Western blot, and then observed the distribution of TRPC6 with indirect immunofluorescence labeling under
confocal microscope.
Results: The activities of podocytes significantly increased after FK506 intervention for 24 hours and 48 hours when
compared with the Ang II stimulation group, and the apoptosis rate was markedly lower than that of the Ang II stimulation
group, while in contrast to TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression.
Conclusion: FK506 can directly act on the podocytes to inhibit Ang II-induced damage on podocyte structures and
reduce the apoptosis rate of podocytes, which may be related to stabilizing TRPC6 expression and distribution in
podocytes by FK506, thus maintaining the structure and function integrity of the slit diaphragm and playing a role in
protecting podocytes and antiproteinuria.

distribution, to investigate the protective effect of FK506
on podocytes and the correlation of TRPC6 with podocyte
injury repair.
Materials and methods
A mouse podocyte cell line (MPC5) was donated by
Professor Jie Ding in the Pediatric Department of Peking
University First Hospital and authorized by Professor
Peter Mundel of the United States. Podocytes were cul-
tured at 37°C in Roswell Park Memorial Institute (RPMI)
1640 medium (Gibco Company) containing 10% fetal
bovine serum (FBS) (Hyclone Company) in a 5% CO2
incubation box. The experiments were divided into three
groups: the control group: culture with RPMI 1640
medium containing 0.02% dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO);
the Ang II stimulation group: Ang II (10­6 mol/l) was
added to stimulate the podocytes; the FK506 intervention
group: Ang II and FK506 (5 g /ml) was added and dis-
solved in 0.02% DMSO to interact with the podocytes at
the same time.
Flow cytometry
The cells were digested with ethylenediaminetetraacetic
acid (EDTA)-free trypsin, cells were collected, centrifuged
and 500 l buffer was added, then the suspended cells were
transferred into a streaming tube, and 5 l propidium
iodide (PI) and 5 l Annexin V-fluorescein isothiocyanate
(FITC) were simultaneously added to keep a light-resistant
reaction for 10 minutes, and further analyzed by flow
cytometry.
Real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
According to the operating instructions of RNAgents Total
RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation), total cel-
lular RNAwas extracted, subjected to reverse transcription
(RT) and real-time PCR reaction as required by the 7500
Fast Real-Time PCR System operation, in which the melt-
ing curve chart was used for quantitative PCR, the speci-
ficity of the PCR product was tested by agarose gel
electrophoresis, and the objective gene was quantitatively
analyzed by the double standard curve method.
Western blot
The internal control glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydro-
genase (GAPDH) and TRPC6 protein expression were
respectively detected, then each objective protein expres-
sion was divided by the internal control (GAPDH) then the
obtained value represented the relative objective protein
content in each sample after the calibration by internal
control (GAPDH). This value was further used for the
comparison between the samples.
Immunofluorescence staining to check TRPC6
distribution in podocytes
The cells were seeded nearly full in a cover glass, fixed
with ice cold acetone, and incubated by primary and sec-
ondary antibodies, then images was taken by using
Olympus-IX81-FV1000 laser scanning confocal micros-
copy with FITC (green) channel at the excitation wave-
length of 488 nm, and further analyzed by computer.
Statistical methods
All the data were treated with SPSS 17.0 statistical soft-
ware for statistical evaluation, and the calculated results
were expressed with x s
-± and the statistical evaluation
was performed using one-way analysis of variance
(ANOVA) (more than two groups), or least significant dif-
ference (LSD)-t (variances assumed), values of p < 0.05
were considered as statistically significance.
The results
Morphological changes of podocytes after
puromycin aminonucleoside (PAN) damage and
FK506 intervention
The cells were observed and photographed under inverted
microscope, and the relative area of podocytes was calcu-
lated by ImageJ and SPSS. The cell areas at eight hours, 24
hours and 48 hours of the Ang II stimulation group were
significantly larger than those of theAng II group, p < 0.05;
the cell areas at eight hours, 24 hours and 48 hours for the
FK506 intervention group were significantly larger than
those of the Ang II stimulation group, p < 0.05 (Figure 1).
The apoptosis rate of podocytes was detected by flow
cytometry using a PI and Annexin V-FITC double staining
apoptosis kit, and the obtained results indicated that the
apoptosis rate of podocytes at eight hours for the Ang II
stimulation group had no significant changes when com-
pared with the normal control group (p > 0.05); the apop-
tosis rates of podocytes at 24 hours and 48 hours were
obviously higher than those of the control group (p < 0.01);
the apoptosis rates of podocytes at 24 hours and 48 hours
of the FK506 group decreased significantly more than the
Ang II stimulation group (p < 0.05) (Figure 2).
TRPC6 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression
changes
Under normal circumstances, podocytes have a certain
amount of TRPC6 mRNA expression. Using GAPDH as
an internal control, TRPC6 mRNA expression signifi-
cantly increased after Ang II stimulation for 24 hours and
48 hours (p < 0.01); TRPC6 mRNA expression after
FK506 intervention for 24 hours and 48 hours decreased
262 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(2)
significantly more than that in theAng II stimulation group
(p < 0.05).
TRPC6 protein expression changes
Western blot analysis showed that TRPC6 and GAPDH
displayed the specific bands at the 106 kd and 36 Kd.
Under normal circumstances, there is a certain amount of
TRPC6 protein expression in podocytes. Compared with
the control group, TRPC6 protein expression did not show
significant change after Ang II stimulation for eight hours,
and significantly increased after 24 hours and 48 hours (p
< 0.01); compared with the Ang II stimulation group,
TRPC6 protein expression in the FK506 intervention
group did not change obviously after eight hours, decreased
after 24 hours (p < 0.05) and significantly decreased after
48 hours (p < 0.01), then became normal (Figure 3).
TRPC6 distribution changes in podocytes
Immunofluorescence staining showed that TRPC6 in the
control group was linearly and uniformly distributed in the
cell membrane, and only a little in the cytoplasm; after
Ang II stimulation for 24 hours, TRPC6 was discontinu-
ously distribution along the cell membrane and increased
in the cytoplasm; after 48 hours' stimulation, TRPC6

increased in the cell membrane, lost in part of the cell
membrane, gathered into granular forms, and was widely
distributed in the cytoplasm. TRPC6 at different time
points after FK506 intervention was distributed more uni-
formly in the cell membrane, and the distribution remark-
ably improved in the whole cells more than before, and
tended to be normal (Figure 4).
Discussion
TRPC6 is a non-selective transient receptor potential cation
channel positioned in the cell membrane. SD in podocytes
constitutes the last barrier of glomerular filtration, and
plays an important role in maintaining the hematuria barrier
and preventing leakage of high molecular weight protein.5
However, podocytes are highly differentiated cells, and
once damaged they are hard to repair, so the pathological
changes of many kidney diseases show as foot processes
fusion and loss, podocytes injury and exfoliation. This
study observed the effect of FK506 on the morphology,
activity, and apoptosis rate of podocytes, and TRPC6
expression and distribution after podocyte damage, and
investigated the protective effect of FK506 in podocytes
and the correlation of TRPC6 with podocyte injury repair.

Ang II has been widely used in mechanism research of
podocyte disease. It can induce foot process effacement of
podocytes and lead to cytoskeletal damage and abnormal
molecular expression and distribution of podocytes.6­12 In
this study, we established podocyte injury models using
Ang II in this part of the study by referring to the previous
work of our group.13,14 The experimental results demon-
strated that the Ang II stimulation group showed foot pro-
cess retraction at eight hours, and the cell area is reduced
to 38.9% of the control group; the foot process signifi-
cantly was reduced at 24 hours' stimulation, and the cell
area declined to 5% of the control group; after stimulation
for 48 hours, the cell area declined to 4.5% of the control
group, and part of the podocytes showed foot process
effacement and loss of intercellular junctions. After Ang II
stimulation for 24 hours and 48 hours, the cell activities of
podocytes significantly decreased and the apoptosis rate
obviously increased; after FK506 intervention for 24 hours
and 48 hours, the cell activities of podocytes increased and
the apoptosis rate significantly decreased. Accordingly,
Ang II stimulation can result in glomerular podocyte mor-
phology changes, increased apoptosis, decreased podocyte
numbers, and the damaged structural integrity of the SD,
then the damage of the SD structure would inevitably
affect the function of the filtration barrier and finally lead
to the occurrence of proteinuria. FK506 improved the cell
morphology, apoptosis, and podocyte number stability
through inhibition of Ang II damage, and maintained the
SD structure integrity of the podocytes, protected kidney
tissue, and played an important role in anti-proteinuria.
Our study found that FK506 could inhibit Ang II dam-
age on podocytes to improve cell morphology, reduce
apoptosis and stabilize the number of podocytes, whereas
its molecular mechanism is still not clear. In 2005, Winn's
research group15 found that the TRPC6 mutation is the
virulence gene, which caused familial focal segmental glo-
merulosclerosis (FSGS), and this mutation resulted in an
SD dysfunction and proteinuria, eventually developed into
glomerulosclerosis and renal failure. Reiser's research
group16 found that in patients suffering from nonhereditary
proteinuric renal disease, such as non-familial FSGS,
membranous glomerulonephritis, minimal change nephri-
tis, TRPC6 mRNA and protein expression were higher
than those of the normal control group. Accordingly,
TRPC6 mutation or its increased expression is closely
related to genetic and acquired kidney diseases. Ichimura
et al.17 applied cytochalasin D as the cytoskeleton-crack-
ing agent in in vitro differentiation and maturation of
mouse podocyte MPC5, and found that TRPC6 protein
expression after application of cytochalasin D significantly
increased in comparison with the control group, which
suggested that increased TRPC6 expression correlated
with podocyte injury. Our study observed that, after Ang II
stimulation for 24 hours and 48 hours, TRPC6 mRNA and
protein expression were higher than those of the control
group, which was consistent with the literature that Ang II
can stimulate podocytes and induce abnormal intracellular
TRPC6 transcription, translation and protein transloca-
tion.18 At the same time, our experimental results also
demonstrated that TRPC6 was highly expressed with
mRNA and protein at the same time points, and the peak
values are consistent with each other, which indicated that
the effect of Ang II on TRPC6 expression in podocytes
affects mRNA transcription and protein translation at the
same level. Our research confirmed that TRPC6 overex-
pression can activate the RhoA pathway; RhoA promotes
the formation of contractile actin-myosin and the stress
fibers on the cell body, and their inappropriate activation
may further cause structure disorder of foot process.19 The
in vivo study showed that TRPC6 mutations would even-
tually cause Ca2+ dysfunction and result in glomerular dis-
ease.20­22 Therefore, we proposed that FK506 can reduce
the intracellular calcium overload by inhibiting TRPC6
expression in podocytes, thereby reducing the podocyte
apoptosis and stabilizing the number of podocytes, and
further protect the podocytes and decrease proteinuria

excretion, whereas the specific molecular pathways still
need to be verified by related experiments that will be the
research direction in the future.
In conclusion, the results suggest that FK506 can reduce
apoptosis and stabilize the number of podocytes by inhibit-
ing TRPC6 overexpression and improving TRPC6 distri-
bution in podocytes, as well as inhibit the damage effect of
Ang II on podocytes, which may provide a theoretical
basis for clinically using FK506 for kidney diseases.
