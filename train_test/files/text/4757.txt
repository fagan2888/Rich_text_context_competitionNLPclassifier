ABSTRACT
The "hygiene hypothesis" has been suggested to explain the rising incidence of
allergic disorders in developed countries. The postulated mechanism is that infec-
tious and/or microbial agents stimulate the immune system toward Thl (allergy
fighting) rather than Th2 (allergy promoting) response. This paper reviews the
evidence related to early life infectious/microbial exposures and subsequent atopic
disorders and evaluates whether these data suggest a hormetic effect. Our review
indicates an insufficient and contradictory association for bacterial/viral infections,
with protective effects being either absent or specific to certain infections and/or
populations. Chronic, heavy parasitic burdens appear to confer protection against
atopic disorders, but are associated with considerable pathology. Moreover, light
parasitic burden may increase allergic responses (i.e., no "low dose" beneficial
effect). In contrast, there is consistent evidence that general microbial exposures,
particularly gut commensals, may be protective against allergy development, which
is consistent with a hormetic effect (i.e., potentially beneficial effects at low doses
and detrimental effects at high levels). Conclusion: General microbial exposures in
relation to the "hygiene hypothesis" may represent a hormetic effect, although
further research with more rigorous study methods (i.e., prospective designs and
measurement of exposure timing, dose, route, etc.) are needed.
Key Words: hormesis, hygiene hypothesis, atopy, allergies, infection, parasites.
INTRODUCTION
In recent years, children from developed countries like the United States and the
United Kingdom have experienced large increases in the incidence of asthma and
atopic (i.e. inhaled allergic) diseases. It has been suggested that these increases may
be attributable to improved "hygienic" conditions typically found in developed

societies, a hypothesis referred to as the "hygiene hypothesis" (Strachan 1989;
Lordan and Holgate 1999; Martinez and Holt 1999; Strachan 1999; Abramson and
Walters 2000).
The mechanism postulated for the "hygiene hypothesis" is that infectious and/
or microbial agents may serve to "educate" the immune system to avoid inappropri-
ate responses to harmless external antigens. The immune system of nonatopic
individuals is characterized by a predisposition toward a type-l helper-T-eell (Thl)
response, with production of INF-y and inhibition of type-2 helper-T-eell (Th2)
cells. Conversely, atopic individuals have a predisposition toward a Th2 response
and production of cytokines such as IL-4 and IL-5, which promote IgE production
and eosinophilia. The newborn immune system also exhibits a Th2 bias. The
hygiene hypothesis suggests that microorganism exposures early inlife may serve to
stimulate the immune system toward a more mature Thl response, rather than an
allergy-promoting Th2 response (Martinez 1994; Romagnani 1996; Martinez and
Holt 1999; Openshaw and Walzl 1999; Abramson and Walters 2000).
The concept of hormesis suggests that exposure to low doses of an agent that is
detrimental at higher doses may produce a beneficial effect (Sagan 1987; Neafsey
1990; Bukowski and Lewis 2000). Based on this definition, a natural question is
whether the "hygiene hypothesis" may represent a hormetic effect. Accordingly, this
paper reviews the evidence related to the "hygiene hypothesis" and compares the
findings with the concept of hormesis. This paper is not intended as a comprehen-
sive or exhaustive review of the literature. Rather, it is.meant as a high-level overview
of the evidence on this topic, with the hope ofstimulating discussion and awareness.
Our review focuses on three types of exposures - bacterial/viral infectious illness,
general microbial exposures, and parasitism - and evaluates whether the evidence
related to each of these exposures suggests a possible hormetic effect.
BACTERIAL/VIRAL INFECTIONS
Findings from studies of early life exposure to bacterial/viral infections and
subsequent risk of atopic disorders have produced variable results. For example, a
study of Italian military cadets found that a history of exposure to food-borne and
oral-fecal infections (H. jJylori, Toxoplasma gondii, and hepatitis A), but not airborne
viruses, was associated with reduced atopy and allergies (Matricardi et al. 1997,
2000). Measles infection, an inducer of a Thl immune response, has been associ-
ated with a reduced risk of atopic disorders in some studies (Shaheen et al. 1996;
Bodner et at. 1998; Farooqi and Hopkin 1998) but not others (Paunio et at. 2000).
A report from Japan suggests that children demonstrating a positive immune
response to the bacille Calmette-Gue'rin (BCG) vaccine (another inducer of type 1
immune response) have less allergenic sensitization and fewer atopic diseases com-
pared with children having a negative response (Shirakawa et al. 1997).
Studies having less specific information on type of viral infection have reported
similar results. For example, Martinez et at. (1995) found that nonwheezinglower
156 Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.2, 2003·
Hygiene Hypothesis and Hormesis
respiratory tract infections (LRl) during the first 3 years oflife were associated with
lower IgE levels and lower skin test reactivity compared with children with wheezing
and/or absentLRl. A longitudinal study of 1314 German children by IlIi etat. (2001)
found that repeated viral infections other than lower respiratory tract infections
early in life may reduce risk ofsubsequent asthma development. Additionally, there
is a relatively consistent association between smaller sibship size, (Strachan 1989;
von Mutius et at. 1994; Bodner et at. 1998) higher birth order (Strachan 1989; von
Mutius et al. 1994; Strachan et al. 1997; Bodner et at. 1998) and increased risk of
atopic disorders. Interestingly, two studies reported a reduced level of IgE in cord
blood of pregnancies having higher birth order, suggesting that the sibling effect
may originate in utero (Bergmann et al. 1999; Karmaus et al. 200 I). In COil trast to
the above studies, there is evidence that some respiratory viruses, particularly respi-
ratory syncytical virus (RSV), may cause asthma (Weiss 1998a; Hogg 1999; Gem
2000). Additionally, several studies have found either similar or increased risk of
atopy and/or asthma associated with childhood infection with airborn viruses (Bodner
et at. 1998; Wold 1998; von Mutius et at. 1999; Matricardi et at. 2000).
Another source of information about the role of childhood infections in the
development ofatopic diseases is studies ofchildhood immunizations, antibiotic use
and daycare attendance. With the exception of vaccines like the BeG, most vacci-
nations given to children induce a Th2 response (Rook and Stanford 1998). Several
studies suggest that infant and childhood immunizations, particularly pertussis
vaccine, may be associated with an increased risk of asthma (Kemp el at. 1997;
Farooqi and Hopkin 1998). With regard to antibiotics use, several investigators have
found that antibiotic use in the first few years of life is associated with an increased
risk of developing atopic diseases, with risk increasing as number of antibiotic
courses taken increases (Farooqi and Hopkin 1998; von Mutius et at. 1999; Wickens
etal. 1999a). However, several studies have reported either weak or no evidence that
infant and childhood immunizations increase risk of atopic diseases (Henderson et
at. 1999; Nilsson et al. 1999; Destefano et at. 2002). Moreover, one study found
antibiotic use to be a risk factor for asthma and allergic disorders only among
children with parents having hay fever (Droste el at. 2000). Finally, results for
daycare attendance and subsequent asthma are mixed, with some studies reporting
a protective effect (Oddy et al. 1999) and others reporting either no association
(Nystad et al. 1999; Kilpelainen et at. 2000) or an increased risk (Wickens (~t al.
1999b).
Conclusion. The evidence to support a reduced risk of atopic disorders and early
life exposure to bacterial/viral infections is insufficient and contradictory. In gen-
eral, the effect is either absent or specific to certain infections and/or populations.
More importantly, there is no evidence that the response is a low-dose phenomenon
- a key characteristic ofhormetic effects. As such, if a protective effect of bacterial/
viral infections is real, this effect is more appropriately viewed as a beneficial
response to a pathological process rather than a honnetic effect.

PARASITISM
A" infection and microbial exposure has decreased in Western society over time,
so has parasitism. Prior to the 20th century, parasitism was quite common through-
out the world, and it is still endemic to most regions of the developing world. Also,
as with allergy, parasitism is associated with an alteration in the balance between the
Th I and Th2 responses. These factors have caused some to wonder if the rise in
atopy has been fueled by the fall in parasitism (Yazdanbakhsh et at. 2001, 2002).
There is a fair body of evidence suggesting that parasitism may protect against
allergic illness. Schistosomiasis and a variety of intestinal parasite infections have
been associated with lower levels ofallergic reactivity (Lynch etat. 1998; Araujo etat.
2000; van den Biggelaar et at. 2000; Nyan et at. 2001). Removal of parasites through
anthelmintic treatment has also been shown to induce a heightened allergic re-
sponse (Lynch etat. 1993). However, there is also evidence against a protective effect
from parasitism, with some studies finding no protective effect on allergy, or even
a worsening of allergic disease among parasitized individuals (Catapani et at. 1997;
Lynch et at. 1997; Mao et at. 2000).
One apparent inconsistency behind the hypothesis that parasitism protects against
allergy is the fact that most parasites elicit a strong Th2 immune response in the host
(Weiss 1998b). Several mechanisms have been suggested to explain this seemingly
paradoxical finding. One possible mechanism is that the polyclonal IgE response
induced by parasitism competitively binds to mast cell receptors, inhibiting allergic
degranulation. A second proposed mechanism is that this polyclonal IgE expansion
exhausts the immune response. However, the most promising mechanistic explana-
tion is that the inflammatory response produced by chronic parasitism also induces
a down-regulation of the immune system (e.g., through interleukinlO production),
as a means of protecting the host from runaway inflammation. This would explain
why heavy parasitism seems to be protective for allergy/asthma, while lighter para-
site burdens are not. This also explains why anthelmentic treatment removes this
protective benefit. In essence, this mechanism suggests that parasitism does not
prevent allergy development, only the inflammatory manifestations of allergic dis-
ease (Yazdanbakhsh et at. 2001, 2002).
Conclusion: The best available evidence supporting a protective effect on allergy
from parasite exposure suggests a dampening of the allergic response in those with
heavy parasite burdens, which is due to an antiinflammatory mechanism. This is not
a low-dose phenomenon, given that heavy parasite burdens are needed. Further-
more, the pathology associated with heavy parasite loads probably outweighs any
anti-allergy/asthma benefits. Therefore, such a process, if true, does not represent
hormesis.
MICROBIAL EXPOSURES
Humans have evolved in an environment characterized by the presence of non-
pathogenic microbial exposures (Rook and Stanford 1998). Only in recent years
158 Nonlinearity in Biology,Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.2, 2003-
Hygiene Hypothesis and Hormesis
have these microbial agents been reduced or eliminated through the introduction
of improved food handling and safety procedures, the use of antimicrobial soaps
and agents, etc. There is increasing evidence and mechanistic rationale to suggest
that early life exposure to generally harmless environmental bacteria may confer
protection against development of atopy and asthma.
Endotoxin
Endotoxins are lipopolysaccharides that form a part of the outer structure of the
cell wall of Gram-negative bacteria. Interestingly, endotoxin that is typically found
in households is capable of inducing INF-y and IL-12 production (Le et at. 1986;
D'Andrea et at. 1992). Martinez (2001) notes that the body's immune system has a
sensitive mechanism to detect the presence of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), which
results in the production of a set of cytokines and immune mediators (e.g., IFN-y)
by antigen presenting cells. This process may prevent early allergic sensitization,
thereby ultimately preventing the development of asthma or allergic conditions.
There is consistent epidemiologic evidence that children raised on farms have a
reduced risk of developing atopic disorders compared with children raised in non-
farm environments (Braun-Fahrlander el at. 1999; Ernst and Cormier 2000; Riedler
et at. 2000) (Kilpelainen et at. 2000; Von Ehrenstein el at. 2000; von Mutius el at. 2000;
Leynaert et at. 2001; Riedler et at. 2001). The apparent protective effect of being
raised on a farm is stronger for hay fever and atopic sensitization than for asthr!1a
(Lewis 2000). Currently, it is unclear whether this association may be due to
increased microbial exposures resulting from contact with livestock (Riedler el at.
2000; Von Ehrenstein et at. 2000), consumption of farm milk (Riedler el at. 2001),
or some other aspect of the traditional farming lifestyle.
Studies have reported that dust samples collected from farming homes have
significantly higher levels of endotoxin compared with non-fanning homes (von
Mutius et at. 2000; Gehring et at. 2002). Gereda et at. (2000) reported significantly
lower levels of endotoxin in dust samples collected in the homes of allergen-
sensitized infants compared with nonsensitized infants. In this same study, blood
T-eells collected from infants living in homes with higher endotoxin levels showed
significantly increased IFN-y responses. Braun-Fahrlander et at. (2002) reported that
endotoxin levels in the dust taken from a child's mattress were inversely related to
the occurrence of hay fever, atopic asthma, and atopic sensitization, but not with
nonatopic wheeze. An inverse association was also reported between endotoxin
levels and the capacity of circulating leukocytes to produce inflammatory cytokines
after stimulation with LPS. These findings provide perhaps the strongest evidence
for an association between endotoxin exposure and decreased atopic illness (Braun-
Fahrlander et at. 2002).
While the above data argue that endotoxin may protect against atopic disease,
some have pointed out conflicting observations that argue against this hypothesis.
For example, exposure to endotoxin in occupational or laboratory settings can
produce a number of adverse effects (e.g., fever, respiratory disease, etc.) (Douwes
Nonlinearity in Biology, Toxicology, and Medicine. Vol. 1, No.2, 2003 159
Bukowski and Lewis
et at. 2002). However, when examined more closely, these observations are not
incompatible with the hygiene hypothesis. Exposed workers (e.g., cotton and grain
workers) and subjects in controlled studies experience relatively high-level inhala-
tion exposure to endotoxin, rather than the lower-level exposure to inhaled and
ingested endotoxin produced by contact with animals and soil in farm settings. Also,
adult exposures occur well after the stimulatory time window suggested by the
hygiene hypothesis. Elevated endotoxin levels in metropolitan homes have been
associated with exacerbation of existing asthma, but not asthma development (Liu
2002) .
Intestinal Flora
Until the 1950s and 1960s, acute infectious diseases of the gastrointestinal
tract were a major cause of illness requiring medical treatment in US children,
a pattern that still persists today in developing countries. The causes of these
illnesses have largely been eliminated in developed countries through vaccina-
tions, better food and water supplies, and increased use of antibiotics (Martinez
and Holt 1999). Matricardi and Bonini (2000a; 2000b) and others (Holt et at.
1997; Wold 1998) propose that high turnover of microbes (commensal and
pathogenic bacteria) at mucosal surfaces, particularly in the gut, may "edu-
cate" the immune system to interact safely with nonmicrobial antigens. There
is some evidence to support this hypothesis, with several studies indicating
compositional differences in gut flora between allergic and nonallergic sub-
jects (Sepp et at. 1997; Bjorksten et at. 1999; Bottcher et at. 2000; Kalliomaki et
at. 2001a). One of the few prospective studies (Bjorksten et at. 2001) found
differences in intestinal flora between allergic and nonallergic children in
Estonia and Sweden, with allergic children having less lactobacilli and
bifidobacteria and more aerobic microorganisms, compared with nonallergic
children. Most impressive is a recent double-blind, randomized placebo-con-
trolled trial that showed prenatal administration of lactobacillus GG to moth-
ers of high-risk infants was effective in preventing early atopic disease
(Kalliomaki et at. 2001b).
One piece of conflicting evidence is that high asthma prevalence in the US is
often among urban children who live in environments that are typically thought of
as being "dirty". However, this may reflect a difference in the definition of "dirty"
between farm and urban environments (Matricardi and Bonini 2000a). Urban
children often live in poorly ventilated homes exposed to cockroaches, vermin,
house dust, and volatile chemicals. Farm children are exposed to "dirt" that is rich
in organic material.
Conclusion: Considerable evidence supports a protective effect on atopy/asthma
from early exposure to microbials, especially those found on farms (e.g., Gram-
Negative bacteria and lactobacilli). These low-level beneficial exposures, which are
harmful at high levels, suggest a hormetic process.

Hygiene Hypothesis and Honnesis
SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS
The evidence to support an association between early bacterial/viral infectious
illness and decreased atopy/asthma is insufficient and contradictory. The evidence
for such a protective effect from parasitism is stronger, but neither line of evidence
suggests a low-level (i.e., hormetic) process. However, considerable evidence does
support a protective effect from low-level exposure to general ambient microbials,
suggesting that this aspect ofthe hygiene hypothesis may be an example of hormesis.
It should be noted that while evidence supports this aspect of the hygiene hypoth-
esis, the hypothesis still represents a theory that has not been proven. It must also
be recognized that asthma/allergy development is complex, with multiple other
factors (e.g., fetal development and genetic predisposition), as well as interactions
of these factors with the environment, playing an important role (Berg 1996;
Tantisira and Weiss 2001; Bukowski et al. 2002).
RESEARCH CONSIDERATIONS
This hypothesis, if substantiated, suggests obvious personal or public health
interventions that might be useful to decrease the risk of childhood allergy/asthma
(e.g., microbial supplementation or decreased emphasis on extensive household
disinfection). However, there are currently many unanswered questions regarding
the role that early microbial exposures play in the development of allergy and
asthma. For example, it is unclear what type, duration, or magnitude of microbial
exposure is most associated with a protective effect, although those organisms that
induce a strong Thl response are likely to be good candidates for study (Von
Hertzen 1998). Importantly, it is unclear what developmental periods constitute
critical "exposure" windows, whether exposures after a certain age (e.g., 3 to 5 years)
have an impact, and the role that these exposures play in initiating or maintaining
a Thl-type immune response. There is some evidence to suggest that exposures into
adulthood may still be important, with several studies suggesting that immigrants
may take on the atopy profile of the local population over time (Kalyoncu and
Stalenheim 1992). Moreover, atopic disorders have been reported to go into remis-
sion after infectious diseases occur among atopic individuals (Serafini 1997).
One controlled trial reported that microbial supplementation during pregnancy
may protect against allergy development in children (Kalliomaki et al. 200Ib).
National trials need to be performed to confirm these findings and demonstrate the
safety and efficacy of this approach as a possible prophylactic measure.
Finally, most of the studies investigating the "hygiene hypothesis" have been
cross-sectional and/or retrospective designs. In order to answer the questions above,
larger prospective studies will be needed. National efforts, such as the recently
proposed longitudinal National Children's Study (U.S. Department of Health and
Human Services and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 2001) represent ideal
situations within which to evaluate and refine this hypothesis and to identify specific
prophylactic exposures.
