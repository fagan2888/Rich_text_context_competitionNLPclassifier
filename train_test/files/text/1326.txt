Clinical and epidemiological data indicate that inflammation may be associated with insulin
resistance. We examined the association between inflammatory markers, such as ferritin, uric
acid, white cell counts, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein, and insulin resistance among 5,959
adults, aged 20 years and without diabetes (fasting glucose 126 mg/dl and not taking
diabetes medication), who participated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey. Insulin resistance was calculated using the homeostasis model assessment (HOMA).
Levels of ferritin, uric acid, white cell counts, fibrinogen, and C-reactive protein were signifi-
cantly higher in individuals with a higher HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR). After adjust-
ment for age, sex, race, education, physical inactivity, current and former smoking, alcohol
intake, use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, systolic blood pressure, BMI, waist circum-
ference, serum total cholesterol, and triglycerides, a 1-SD higher ferritin (126.1 ng/ml), uric acid
(1.4 mg/dl), white blood cell count (2.2  109/l) , and fibrinogen (80.6 mg/dl) was associated
with a 0.10 (95% CI 0.03­0.17, P  0.004), 0.16 (0.08­0.24, P  0.001), 0.16 (0.09­0.22,
P  0.001), and 0.12 (0.05­0.18, P  0.001) higher HOMA-IR, respectively. Clinically elevated
C-reactive protein (1.0 mg/dl) was associated with a 0.63 (0.23­1.04, P  0.003) higher
HOMA-IR. These findings indicate that elevated levels of inflammatory markers are positively
and independently associated with insulin resistance. Further studies should examine the po-
tential causal effect of inflammation on insulin resistance.

Insulin resistance is a major risk factor
for type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular
disease, and chronic kidney disease (1­
3). Additionally, insulin resistance and
compensatory hyperinsulinemia have
been associated with hypertension, in-
creased levels of serum triglycerides,
small dense LDL particles, circulating
plasminogen activator inhibitor, and de-
creased levels of HDL (4). The prevalence
of diabetes has been increasing progres-
sively in the U.S. and other countries, and
the number of adults with diabetes in the
world is projected to increase to 300
million in the year 2025 (5). It is likely
that the number of individuals with insu-
lin resistance will be much greater than
this estimate.
The underlying causes for the devel-
opment of insulin resistance are not well
defined, but both genetic and environ-
mental factors may play a role. Obesity
and physical inactivity have been consid-
ered important risk factors for insulin re-
sistance (6). Clinical and epidemiologic
data also indicate that inflammatory fac-
tors might be associated with insulin re-
sistance. Several studies have reported
elevated levels of C-reactive protein,
white blood cell count, uric acid, and fi-
brinogen in people with insulin resistance
or the metabolic syndrome (7­16). Stud-
ies on the relationship between ferritin
and insulin resistance are scarce. Fernan-
dez-Real et al. (17) reported that ferritin
could be a marker of the insulin resistance
syndrome in 36 healthy subjects, while
Sheu et al. (18) reported that serum fer-
ritin was positively associated with insu-
lin resistance in women but not men. In
general, studies on the relationship be-
tween inflammatory factors and insulin
resistance have been based on small sam-
ple sizes.
We examined the relationship be-
tween inflammatory markers, such as
C-reactive protein, white cell count, fi-
brinogen, uric acid, and ferritin, and in-
sulin resistance in a large representative
sample of nondiabetic U.S. adults who
participated in the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III).
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES III was con-
ducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics of the Centers for Disease Con-
trol and Prevention between 1988 and
1994. A detailed description of the study
participants and methods has been pub-
lished elsewhere (19). In brief, a stratified
multistage probability design was used to
obtain a representative sample of the ci-
vilian noninstitutionalized U.S. general
population (19). The study design in-
cluded oversampling of those who were
very young, elderly, non-Hispanic black,
and Mexican American to improve the

precision of estimates in these groups. A
subsample of 10,047 NHANES III partic-
ipants was randomly selected to take part
in morning visits, at which fasting blood
specimens were obtained. Individuals
20 years of age (n  1,569), without a
fasting blood sample (n  781), who did
not receive a morning examination (n 
368), who were pregnant or menstruating
(n  395), who had diabetes (fasting
plasma glucose 126 mg/dl or the cur-
rent use of diabetes medication; n  841),
or with a missing value for insulin, glu-
cose, or covariates (n  134) were ex-
cluded from the current analysis, leaving
5,959 persons for the main analyses. In
addition, we excluded those without se-
rum ferritin (n  4), uric acid (n  23),
white cell count (n  39), fibrinogen (n 
2,574), and C-reactive protein (n  48) in
the analysis of these variables with insulin
resistance. Fibrinogen was only measured
among persons who were at least 40 years
of age.
NHANES III data were collected by
administration of a standardized ques-
tionnaire during a home interview fol-
lowed by conduct of a detailed physical
examination with collection of blood
specimens at a mobile examination center
or the participant's home. Information on
a wide variety of sociodemographic, med-
ical history, nutritional history, and fam-
ily history questions, such as self-reported
age, race/ethnicity, sex, years of education
completed, history of smoking and hy-
pertension, use of antihypertensive med-
ication, use of nonsteroidal anti-
inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including
aspirin in the past month, physical activ-
ity, alcohol consumption, and 24-h di-
etary recall, were obtained during the
home interview (19).
For NHANES III participants who
were assigned to a physical examination
during a morning session, a blood sample
was collected following an overnight fast
of 8 h. Laboratory procedures used in
the NHANES III have been described
elsewhere (19,20). Plasma glucose level
was measured with a hexokinase enzy-
matic reference method (COBAS MIRA;
Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN) and
serum insulin level by means of a radio-
immunoassay (Pharmacia Diagnostics,
Uppsala, Sweden). Serum C-reactive pro-
tein levels were measured using latex-
enhanced nephelometry (Behring
Nephelometer Analyzer System; Behring
Diagnostics, Somerville, NJ). The white
blood cell count was determined on an
automated hematology analyzer (Coulter
Counter Model S-PLUS JR). Uric acid was
measured with Hitachi 737 Analyzer
(Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics, Indi-
anapolis, IN). Serum ferritin was mea-
sured with the BioRad Quantimmune
IRMA kit (BioRad Laboratories, Hercules,
CA). Plasma fibrinogen was measured us-
ing enzyme assay methods with Coag-A-
Mate XC plus (Organon-Teknika,
Alamogordo, NM). Serum total choles-
terol was measured enzymatically using a
commercially available reagent mixture
(Cholesterol/HP; Boehringer Mannheim
Diagnostics), and serum creatinine con-
centrations were measured by the modi-
fied kinetic Jaffe reaction using a Hitachi
737 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim)
(19,20).
Homeostasis model assessment
(HOMA) was used to evaluate insulin re-
sistance using the following formula: fast-
ing serum insulin (U/ml)  fasting
plasma glucose (mmol/l)/22.5 (21).
Blood pressure was measured three
times during the home interview and
three times during the subsequent evalu-
ation at the mobile examination center by
trained observers using a standard proto-
col (19). Blood pressure for an individual
participant was calculated as the average
of all available systolic and diastolic read-
ings. Hypertension was defined as the
presence of a mean systolic blood pres-
sure 140 mmHg and/or diastolic blood
pressure 90 mmHg and/or use of anti-
hypertensive medication. Body weight,
height, and waist circumference were
measured according to a standard proto-
col, and BMI was calculated as an index
for obesity.
Glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was
estimated using the abbreviated equation
developed by the MDRD (Modification of
Diet in Renal Disease) study (22). Esti-
mated GFR  186.3  serum creati-
nine1.154  age0.203  0.742 (if
female)  1.21 (if black). Serum creati-
nine level was calibrated for measurement
variance between NHANES III and
MDRD clinical laboratories. Chronic kid-
ney disease was defined as an estimated
GFR 60 ml  min1  1.73m2 (23).
Statistical analyses
Baseline characteristics of the study pop-
ulation, mean values for continuous vari-
ables, and percentages for categorical
variables were calculated by quartile of
insulin resistance. Linear trends in these
characteristics across insulin resistance
quartiles were examined by means of the
Z test (continuous variables) and the
Wald 2 test (categorical variables) in
multivariable regression models after ad-
justment for age, sex, and race/ethnicity.
Univariate; age-, sex-, and race-
adjusted; and multivariable-adjusted lin-
ear regression analyses were used to
determine the association between each
1-SD higher inflammatory factor and
HOMA of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR).
In addition, univariate; age-, sex-, and
race-adjusted; and multivariable-
adjusted logistic regression analyses were
used to estimate the odds ratio of elevated
HOMA-IR (upper 25th percentile 2.86)
associated with each 1-SD higher ferritin
(126.1 ng/ml), uric acid (1.4 mg/dl),
white blood cell count (2.2  109/l), and
fibrinogen (80.6 mg/dl). The odds ratios
of insulin resistance associated with de-
tectable (0.22­0.99 mg/dl) and clinically
elevated C-reactive protein (1.0 mg/dl),
as compared with undetectable C-reac-
tive protein, were also calculated. Multi-
variable models included adjustment for
age, sex, race, education, physical activ-
ity, current and former smoking, NSAID
use in the past month, alcohol intake, sys-
tolic blood pressure, BMI, waist circum-
ference, serum total cholesterol, and
triglycerides. To assess the robustness of
the association, all analyses were repeated
stratified by sex and the presence of
chronic kidney disease. All data analyses
were conducted using Stata 7.0 (Stata,
College Station, TX) and used techniques
appropriate to the complex survey design
of NHANES III.
RESULTS -- Characteristics of the
study participants are presented by quar-
tile of HOMA-IR in Table 1. On average,
persons with higher insulin resistance
were older, more often African American
or Hispanic, more physically inactive, less
likely to possess a high school education,
more likely to be current smokers, and
more likely to drink alcohol. The preva-
lence of NSAID use in the past month was
similar among the quartiles of HOMA-IR.
Mean BMI, waist circumference, systolic
and diastolic blood pressure, total choles-
terol, and triglycerides were significantly
higher, whereas GFR was lower, among
persons with higher insulin resistance.
Mean serum ferritin, uric acid, white
blood cell count, and fibrinogen levels, as

well as the proportion of individuals with
detectable and clinically elevated C-reac-
tive protein, were significantly higher in
persons with higher insulin resistance.
Table 2 shows the unadjusted; age-,
sex-, and race-adjusted; and multivariate-
adjusted linear regression analyses of
1-SD higher level of inflammatory factors
and elevated C-reactive protein on
HOMA-IR. Even after multivariable ad-
justment, serum ferritin, uric acid, white
blood cell count, fibrinogen, and clini-
cally elevated C-reactive protein levels
were positively and statistically signifi-
cantly associated with HOMA-IR.
Table 3 shows the unadjusted; age-,
sex-, and race-adjusted; and multivariate-
adjusted odds ratios of elevated
HOMA-IR (2.86) associated with a
1-SD higher level of inflammatory factors
and elevated C-reactive protein. Again,
even after multivariate adjustment, serum
ferritin, uric acid, white blood cell count,
fibrinogen, and detectable and clinically
elevated C-reactive protein levels were
each positively associated with higher
odds of elevated HOMA-IR. These associ-
ations were consistent in both men and
women (Table 4).
Patients with chronic kidney disease
had a higher level of HOMA-IR (3.2 vs.
2.4, P  0.001), ferritin (169.2 vs. 125.2
ng/ml, P  0.005), uric acid (7.2 vs. 5.4

(7.8 vs. 6.7  109/l, P  0.001), fibrino-
gen (359.8 vs. 302.9 mg/dl, P  0.001),

P  0.001) than those without chronic
kidney disease. The association between
HOMA-IR and inflammatory factors was
not statistically different between patients
with and those without chronic kidney
disease (Table 4).
CONCLUSIONS -- The present
study identified strong, positive, graded
relationships between elevated C-reactive
protein, white cell count, uric acid, fer-
ritin, and fibrinogen with insulin resis-
tance among nondiabetic subjects. These
relationships were independent of age,
sex, race, and other potential risk factors
for insulin resistance, such as obesity,
physical inactivity, cigarette smoking,
and alcohol consumption. These findings
are noteworthy because they are based on
a large representative sample of the U.S.
general population. In addition, numer-
ous potential confounding covariates
were measured and taken into account in
the present study.
These findings have important clini-
cal and public health implications. Insu-
lin resistance is a major risk factor for type
2 diabetes, coronary heart disease, stroke,
and kidney disease (1­3). Identifying risk
factors for insulin resistance is important
in the development of strategies for the
prevention and treatment of insulin resis-
tance. Inflammatory markers such as tu-
mor necrosis factor- receptor 2,
interleukin-6, and C-reactive protein
were associated with an increased risk of
diabetes (24). In addition, inflammatory
factors such as C-reactive protein and fi-
brinogen play an important role in the
pathogenesis of cardiovascular disease
(25,26). Prospective epidemiologic stud-
ies have indicated that C-reactive protein
has additive effects on the risk of cardio-
vascular disease among patients with in-
sulin resistance (27). Treatment of
inflammation may reduce the risk of in-
sulin resistance, diabetes, and related car-
diovascular disease.
Previous studies have shown that C-
reactive protein is associated with insulin
resistance in healthy nondiabetic individ-
uals (7,28). However, these studies were
conducted in relatively small samples and
did not adjust for potential confounding
factors such as obesity, physical inactive,
cigarette smoking, and alcohol consump-
tion. Our findings provide additional ev-
idence that C-reactive protein is
associated with insulin resistance in non-
diabetic individuals. In addition, data
from the WOSCOPS (West of Scotland
Coronary Prevention Study) showed that
C-reactive protein predicted the develop-
ment of type 2 diabetes in middle-aged
men independently of established risk
factors (29). The potential underlying
mechanisms of this association are un-
clear. Devaraj, Xu, and Jialal (30) indi-
cated that C-reactive protein might
promote atherothrombosis and insulin
resistance by increasing plasminogen ac-
tivator inhibitor-1 expression and activity
in endothelial cells.

with insulin resistance in nondiabetic
Pima Indians (10) and healthy nonsmok-
ing men (11). Our findings extend those
results to a nationally representative sam-
ple, adding more evidence that inflamma-
tion is likely an important risk factor for
insulin resistance.
Serum uric acid was positively associ-
ated with insulin resistance in several
small studies (12,13). However, Clausen
et al. (31) reported that uric acid was not
associated with insulin resistance after ad-
justment for confounding factors in
young healthy Caucasians. Focchini et al.
(14) reported that the clearance of uric
acid was decreased in patients with insu-
lin resistance. The current study docu-
ments a positive association between uric
acid and insulin resistance in persons with
and without chronic kidney disease. There-
fore, our findings imply that the positive as-
sociation between uric acid and insulin
resistance is not due to the confounding ef-
fect of reduced kidney function.
Elevated serum ferritin has been con-
sidered a marker for both inflammation
and insulin resistance. Fernandez-Real et
al. (17) found that that serum ferritin was
correlated with insulin sensitivity in 36
healthy subjects, and Sheu et al. (18)
found that serum ferritin was positively
associated with insulin resistance in
women but not men. Our findings docu-
ment a strong and positive association be-
tween serum ferritin and insulin
resistance. Patients with chronic kidney
disease had higher serum ferritin levels,
but the association between serum ferritin
and insulin resistance was independent of
chronic kidney disease status.
Imperatore et al. (15) examined the
association between plasma fibrinogen
and the metabolic syndrome in 1,252
nondiabetic men aged 35­64 years. In
multivariable analyses, both plasma insu-
lin and the metabolic syndrome were sig-
nificantly and independently associated
with plasma fibrinogen. In addition, Men-
nen et al. (16) investigated the relations
between markers for insulin resistance
(fasting insulin and HOMA-IR) and fi-
brinogen in a cross-sectional study in
4,976 subjects from France. Fibrinogen
was independently related with markers
of insulin resistance, and the association
with fibrinogen was stronger in women
than in men. Our study also showed an
independent relation between fibrinogen
and insulin resistance, and this relation
was consistent in men and women.
Certain limitations should be consid-
ered in the interpretation of our findings.
First, the cross-sectional study design in
NHANES III does not allow inferences to
be drawn regarding causality between in-
flammation and insulin resistance. Specif-
ically, this study design does not allow
one to determine whether inflammation
causes the development of insulin resis-
tance or whether insulin resistance causes
inflammation. Prospective cohort studies
provide a better context for answering
these questions.
In addition, HOMA-IR was calculated
based on fasting insulin and glucose con-
centration, while the more accurate
euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp
method was not used in NHANES III.
However, it is not practical to use the
clamp method in large clinical or epide-
miological studies to measure insulin
resistance. Nonetheless, HOMA-IR is
highly correlated with insulin resistance
measured using the euglycemic-
hyperinsulinemic clamp method and is
more suitable for population studies
(21,32). The HOMA-IR model has been
widelyusedinlargeepidemiologicalstudies
and in clinical practice for estimation of in-
sulin resistance. As such, the findings from
ourstudyareapplicabletoclinicalandpub-
lic health practice settings.
In conclusion, our study documented
the presence of strong, positive, and inde-
pendent relationships between inflamma-
tory factors and insulin resistance. These
findings combined with knowledge from
previous studies suggest that inflammation
is present in patients with insulin resistance
(33). Further studies are warranted to ex-
amine the potential causal effect of inflam-
mation on insulin resistance.
