Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested that there is a strong association between hypovitaminosis D and
cardiovascular disease (CVD). Hypovitaminosis D was reported as a risk factor for increased cardiovascular events among 1739
adult participants in the Framingham Offspring Study. Analysis of more than 13,000 adults in the Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) showed that even though hypovitaminosis D is associated with an increased
prevalence of CVD risk factors, its association with all-cause mortality is independent of these risk factors. Importantly,
epidemiologic studies suggested that patients who had chronic kidney disease and were treated with activated vitamin D had
a survival advantage when compared with those who did not receive treatment with these agents. Mechanistically, emerging
data have linked vitamin D administration with improved cardiac function and reduced proteinuria, and hypovitaminosis D
is associated with obesity, insulin resistance, and systemic inflammation. Preliminary studies suggested that activated vitamin
D inhibits the proliferation of cardiomyoblasts by promoting cell-cycle arrest and enhances the formation of cardiomyotubes
without inducing apoptosis. Activated vitamin D has also been shown to attenuate left ventricular dysfunction in animal
models and humans. In summary, emerging studies suggest that hypovitaminosis D has emerged as an independent risk factor
for all-cause and cardiovascular mortality, reinforcing its importance as a public health problem. There is a need to advance
our understanding of the biologic pathways through which vitamin D affects cardiovascular health and to conduct prospective
clinical interventions to define precisely the cardioprotective effects of nutritional vitamin D repletion.

A growing body of evidence suggests that people who
are deficient in 25-hydroxyvitamin D [25(OH)D] have
higher risks for numerous chronic medical conditions
(1­3). In this review, we present the emerging data that support
this link. Vitamin D is either produced in the skin via the effects
of ultraviolet light or ingested with food and/or supplements.
This vitamin D undergoes hydroxylation in the liver to produce
25(OH)D. It is widely believed that the renal enzyme 25(OH)D-
1-hydroxylase is primarily responsible for producing the cir-
culating levels of the activated form of vitamin D, the hormone
1,25(OH)D. 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase is located in the inner
mitochondrial membrane and is a cytochrome P-450 monoox-
ygenase. Most of the biologic activities of 1,25(OH)D are medi-
ated by its binding to a high-affinity receptor that acts as a
ligand-activated transcription factor. The major steps involved
in the control of gene transcription by the vitamin D receptor
(VDR) include ligand binding, heterodimerization with retin-
oid X receptor, binding of the heterodimer to vitamin D re-
sponse elements, and recruitment of other nuclear proteins into
the transcriptional preinitiation complex. 1,25(OH)D may also
act through non­VDR- or nongenomic VDR-mediated path-
ways (4­6).
There is increasing evidence that the kidney is not unique in
its ability to convert 25(OH)D to 1,25(OH)D, It was recently
demonstrated that many tissues not only express the VDR but
also possess 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase activity. The role of this
paracrine production of 1,25(OH)D in these tissues is not well
understood, but a variety of in vitro studies indicated that this
process may be involved in a wide range of physiologic func-
tions, including regulation of cytokines, inflammatory and/or
fibrotic pathways, the renin-angiotensin system, vascular and
cardiac cell function, immune response modulation, cell growth
and differentiation, and others (7­15). Several of the biologic
pathways through which the effects of 1,25(OH)D are mediated
remain poorly understood but may account for its role in
cardiovascular health (Figure 1).
Epidemiology of Hypovitaminosis D and
Cardiovascular Disease in the General
Population
Several epidemiologic and clinical studies have suggested
that there is a strong association between hypovitaminosis D
and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Scragg et al. (16) reported an
inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels and myo-
cardial infarction in a community setting. This affect may be

mediated in part through increased physical activity (17). Mar-
tins et al. (18) analyzed data from more than 13,000 adults in the
Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) and demonstrated that there is a strong associ-
ation between hypovitaminosis D and key CVD risk factors
(BP, diabetes, overweight, hypertriglyceridemia, but not hyper-
cholesterolemia) after adjustment for multiple variables. Fur-
thermore, several studies have now shown that hypovitamin-
osis D is a predictor of all-cause and cardiovascular mortality
(Table 1), independent of the traditional risk factors (19­21).
Thus, these data have consistently demonstrated that there is a
graded, inverse relationship between serum 25(OH)D levels
and CVD that seems to be most evident as levels fall below 20
to 25 ng/ml. In addition, Pfeifer et al. (22) reported a fall in BP,
heart rate, and parathyroid hormone levels after the short-term
administration of 800 IU of 25(OH)D plus 1200 mg of calcium
versus 1200 mg/d calcium alone to elderly women (mean age 74
yr; mean 25(OH)D level 20 ng/ml), suggesting that inade-
quate intake of 25(OH)D and calcium could play a contributory
role in the pathogenesis and progression of hypertension and
CVD in this cohort.
Epidemiology of Hypovitaminosis D and
CVD in Patients with Chronic Kidney
Disease
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is now recognized as a powerful
cardiovascular risk factor (23). Agarwal et al. (24) found that the
administration of an activated vitamin D analog (paricalcitol) re-
duced proteinuria in 51% of the 57 patients with CKD in compar-
ison with only 25% of the 61 study participants who received
placebo (P  0.004), suggesting a direct vascular effect of vitamin
D. At least three observational studies of patients with CKD--one
in non­dialysis-dependent and two in dialysis-dependent pa-
tients--have reported an increased risk for death (both non­
dialysis-dependent and dialysis-dependent patients) or composite

low serum 25(OH)D levels (Table 2).
Equally as important, observational studies have shown an
association between treatment with activated vitamin D (pre-
sumably for secondary hyperparathyroidism) and lower all-
cause and cardiovascular mortality in patients with CKD, both
in the early stages (25­27) and in those who receive renal
replacement therapy (28­30). Unfortunately, data on serum
25(OH)D were not available in any of these studies.
Vitamin D and Cardiac Hypertrophy
Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) is recognized as one of
the strongest risk factors for cardiovascular mortality, espe-
cially in patients with CKD (31). The increased rates of pressure
and volume overload in patients with CKD can accelerate
cardiac myocyte apoptosis and fibrosis. At the same time, ac-
tivation of neurohormonal systems, growth factors, and cyto-
kines as well as associated downstream intracellular signals can
affect cardiac hypertrophy, apoptosis, and fibrosis, leading to
LVH and/or cardiac dysfunction (32­34); however, the large
variability in LV mass in the CKD population suggests that
other risk factors may also play a role.
Not only are low levels of 25(OH)D pervasive in patients
with CKD (35), but also two small clinical trials of hemodialysis
patients have shown that treatment with activated vitamin D
[1,25(OH)D or related analogs] may lead to regression of LVH,
suggesting a cardioprotective action (36,37). Indeed, activated
vitamin D may affect the myocardium directly and play a role
in the regulation of myocyte hypertrophy, because cardiac hy-
pertrophy has been observed in the hearts of VDR knockout
mice (38). Activated vitamin D has been shown to downregu-
late proliferation and hypertrophy in cultured cardiomyocytes
(39,40). Moreover, Bodyak et al. (41) showed that activated
vitamin D, paricalcitol, attenuated sodium-induced LV abnor-
malities in Dahl salt-sensitive hypertensive rats and when ad-
ministered to dialysis patients improved diastolic function and
reduced LV thickness when compared with patients who did
not receive activated vitamin D. In preliminary studies, we
found that in comparison with cardiomyocyte cells cultured in
the absence of activated vitamin D, the addition of 1,25(OH)D
(1) inhibited cell proliferation; (2) enhanced cardiomyocyte for-
mation; (3) exerted a protective effect against apoptosis; and (4)
promoted a generalized decreased in the expression of genes
related to the regulation of the cell cycle, such as cyclins A1, C,
and E and cyclin-dependent kinases Cdk2 and Cdk4 (42). In
summary, these findings suggest that it is potentially possible
that correcting vitamin D deficiency could contribute to im-
prove cardiac structure and function, thereby ameliorating car-
diovascular risk.
Vitamin D and Vascular Health
The ubiquity of the VDR and tissue 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase
provides insights into several pathobiologic pathways through
which hypovitaminosis D may mediate vascular health in ad-
dition to those outlined already (Figure 2). The VDR knockout
mouse, an animal model that emulates vitamin D deficiency,
displays increased BP, serum angiotensin, and tissue renin (14).
In vitro studies using a juxtaglomerular cell model have shown
that 1,25(OH)D as well as other vitamin D analogs directly
suppress renin gene expression via a vitamin D response ele-
ment that is present in the renin gene (14). Vitamin D analogs
have been shown to inhibit the production of several proin-
flammatory Th-1 cytokines, such as IL-2 and IFN-, while
stimulating the effects of Th-2 lymphocytes, leading to a reduc-
tion in matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and reducing plaque
production and/or instability (43); it also favors the induction
of T regulatory cells partly through the induction of tolerance-
inducing dendritic cells. Furthermore, it has been shown to
have immunosuppressive effects whereby it reduces the pro-
liferation of lymphocytes and the production of cytokines,
which have been identified as having an important role in
atherogenesis (43) (Figure 3).
VDR agonists have also been shown to downregulate plas-
minogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) in human aortic smooth
muscle cells but not endothelial cells. This is likely due to the
lack of VDR expression in the endothelial cells studied (8).
Studies with mouse embryonic fibroblasts from VDR knockout
mice showed an increase in profibrotic factors (NF-B tran-
scriptional activity, IL-6, and TNF-) in comparison with cells
cultured from wild-type mice (44). Although provocative, the

knockout mouse does not allow direct inference to deficient
levels of vitamin D and is confounded by a myriad of a coun-
terregulatory set of gene activities in the setting of an absent
VDR. To examine more closely the VDR-mediated, parathyroid
hormone/calcium-independent effects of vitamin D on profi-
brotic pathways, we performed a series of experiments on a
mesenchymal multipotent cell line with potential to differenti-
ate along endothelial lines and to be used for applications such
as neovascularization and tissue engineering (45). We found
that incubating this multipotent cell line with vitamin D led to
increased expression and nuclear translocation of the VDR;
decreased expression of TGF-1 and plasminogen activator
inhibitor 1; decreased expression of collagens I and III and
other collagens isoforms; and increased expression of several
antifibrotic factors, such as bone morphogenic protein 2 and 7,
(TGF antagonist), MMP8 (a collagen breakdown inducer), and
follistatin (an inhibitor of the profibrotic factor myostatin) (15)
(Figure 4).
Vitamin D is associated not only with multiple pathways that
regulate the early stages of atherogenesis, per se, but also with
vascular calcification. The role of activated vitamin D adminis-
tration on vascular calcifications has remained a paradox, but
recent findings using a mouse model suggested that the admin-
istration of calcitriol and paricalcitol, at dosages sufficient to
correct secondary hyperparathyroidism, were protective
against aortic calcification, whereas higher dosages stimulated
aortic calcification (46). Protective dosages of 1,25(OH)D sup-
pressed aortic osteoblastic gene expression, which is normally
increased in CKD, suggesting a mechanism for this inhibition of
aortic calcification. In addition, evidence suggested that Wnt
signaling may modulate vascular calcification via osteoblastic
differentiation of vascular smooth muscle cells, reinforcing the
role of osteoblast regulation in vascular calcification (47,48).
The relationship between vitamin D and vascular health is
reinforced at a clinical level by Melamed et al., who reported an
80% increase in the adjusted prevalence of peripheral artery
disease among NHANES participants with the lowest quartile
of 25(OH)D (17.8 ng/ml) in comparison with those in the
highest quartile (29.2 ng/ml) (49). Similar associations of
Figure 3. Vitamin D, lymphocyte, and macrophage involvement in atherosclerosis. Recent studies suggest that lymphocytes and
macrophages play the initial role in the generation of atheromas. It is hypothesized that Th1 cells start producing excess IFN-,
which is a potent stimulator of macrophage activity. Activated macrophages secrete IL-1, IL-6, and TNF-. These cytokines
recruit additional monocytes, increase LDL oxidation, and generate production of MMPs that can destabilize the plaque to cause
rupture and thrombosis. In contrast, the TH2 lymphocyte subset is called the antiatherogenic phenotype, because these cells
produce IL-10, a good cytokine that suppresses macrophage activation and Th1 proliferation. PPAR, peroxisome proliferator­

peripheral artery disease and low serum levels of 25(OH)D
were reported by Fahrleitner and colleagues (50,51).
The aforementioned data suggest that vitamin D has multiple
immunomodulatory effects and regulates cytokines, profi-
brotic, and proinflammatory pathways and the renin-angioten-
sin system (9­14) through the VDR. Some effects, such as
downregulation of TGF-1, may occur through vitamin D­me-
diated nongenomic pathways (52). The preponderance of data
link vitamin D deficiency or lack of activation of the VDR with
the modulation of gene transcription and associated signaling
pathways that may contribute to the acceleration of cardiovas-
cular pathology.
Future Directions
Prospective studies are needed to assess the efficacy of
25(OH)D repletion in patients with CKD/ESRD, in both the
presence and absence of activated 1,25(OH)D (or analog) reple-
tion. Studies are needed to evaluate the existence of potential
"nongenomic" or other direct cellular effects of 25(OH)D and
how these may be linked to 1,25(OH)D through modulation of
the VDR or 25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase expression. Studies are
needed to understand better the role of 25(OH)D and local
25(OH)D-1-hydroxylase on vascular and cardiac function as
well as the role of 24,25(OH)D in select organs. Studies are
needed to characterize the gene­environment interactions that
influence 25(OH)D and 1,25(OH)D, as well as to define the
interdependence of 25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, and novel vitamin D
analogs for vascular health. As we extend our understanding of
25(OH)D, 1,25(OH)D, and novel vitamin D analogs on the
renin-angiotensin system, endothelial function, cardiac and re-
nal fibrosis, immune regulation, insulin resistance, adipokines,
and related vascular mediators, we will be better positioned as
a renal community to advance the emerging recognition of
25(OH)D deficiency as an underestimated public health prob-
lem and 25(OH)D repletion as an important public health so-
lution.
Conclusions
Vitamin D seems to play an important role in cardiovascular
health. Emerging studies suggest that vitamin D has important
indirect effects via traditional and possibly nontraditional CVD
risk factors as well as direct effects on cardiac and vascular
cells. This confluence of emerging reports on the ubiquitous
role of vitamin D in cardiovascular health and the graded
relationship between vitamin D levels and clinical outcomes
supports the need to reassess the current position on which
levels of vitamin D constitute vitamin D insufficiency and
necessitate vitamin D repletion. The current recommended lev-
els of serum 25(OH)D (30 to 32 ng/ml) and vitamin D supple-
mentation guidelines (see next paragraph) are primarily based
on predicted needs to maintain optimum bone health and to
prevent rickets but do not address the vitamin D requirements
that may be necessary to minimize the initiation and/or pro-
gression of CVD and CVD risk factors.
Given our evolving understanding of vitamin D and cardio-
vascular health, more effective strategies are needed to address

and an increased expression of antifibrotic markers (bone morphogenic protein 2 [BMP2] and 7 [BMP7], follistatin, MMP8),
leading to an effective reduction in collagen expression, the ultimate marker of a fibrotic condition. Adapted from reference 15.

the unattended epidemic of hypovitaminosis D with nearly
50% of Americans estimated to have serum 25(OH)D levels 30
ng/ml. Presently, the recommended daily vitamin D intake is
200 IU/d for people up to 50 yr of age, 400 IU/d for people
between 51 and 70 yr of age, and 600 IU/d for people who are
older than 70 yr; however, given the daily metabolic use of
vitamin D being approximately 4000 IU many authorities now
believe vitamin D supplementation in the range of 1000 to 4000
IU/d may be required to maintain adequate levels in the gen-
eral population; studies suggest that dosages as high as 10,000
IU/d can be given safely (53). These findings reinforce the
importance of firmly establishing the evidence base required to
address hypovitaminosis D as an important public health prob-
lem and to inform more precisely future clinical guidelines as to
what is likely required to achieve adequate vitamin D levels in
people who are at risk for CVD, in both the absence and
presence of CKD. There still remains a great need to advance
our understanding of the biologic pathways through which
vitamin D mediates cardiovascular function to improve our
ability to target therapies, as well as prospective clinical inter-
ventions to advance our evidence of the efficacy of vitamin D
repletion on cardiovascular health.
