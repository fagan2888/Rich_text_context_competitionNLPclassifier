Introduction
The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Public Law.
111-148, 124 Stat. 119), hereinafter rendered as Affordable
Care Act (ACA), was signed into law by President Barack
Obama in March 2010. The ACA, which is otherwise popu-
larly known as ObamaCare, extends coverage for preventive
health services without need for a co-payment, co-insurance,
or deductible for persons who purchased a new health insur-
ance policy on or after September 23, 2010 (U.S. Department
of Health and Human Services, 2010). The law specifies a
range of 15 covered preventive services for adults; 22 for
women, including pregnant women; and 26 for children.
Preventive health services include screening and counsel-
ing services such as blood pressure, depression, cholesterol,
colorectal cancer screenings, and diet counseling. The spe-
cific covered services for women include screenings for uri-
nary tract or other infections, gestational diabetes for
pregnant women as well as breast cancer mammography and
cervical cancer screenings, and so on (Loosier et al., 2014).
The covered services for children include behavioral assess-
ments, developmental screening, immunizations for children
from birth to age 18, lead screening for children at risk of
exposure, obesity screening, counseling, and oral health risk
assessment (Ghitza & Tai, 2014).
The starting point for accessing preventive health services
under the law is a visit to one's primary care physician. The
use of preventive services have been proven to be beneficial
in enhancing both individual and population health. Ayanian,
Weissman, Chasan-Taber, and Epstein (1999) have sug-
gested that utilization of preventive health services can
increase the quality of life for people and decrease health

The Patient Protection and Affordable
Care Act and Utilization of Preventive
Health Care Services

Abstract
We examined how (a) health insurance coverage, and (b) familiarity with the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act
(ACA)'s or ObamaCare mandate of cost-free access to preventive health services, affect the use of preventive services
by residents of a minority community. It was based on primary data collected from a survey conducted during March to
April 2012 among a sample of self-identified African American adults in Tallahassee-Leon County area of northwest Florida.
The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 was used for running frequency analysis on the data set
and multivariable regression modeling. The results showed that of 524 respondents, 382 (73%) had health insurance while
142 (27%) lacked insurance. Majority of insured respondents, 332 (87%), used preventive health services. However, the
remaining 13% of respondents did not use preventive services because they were unfamiliar with the ACA provision of
free access to preventive services for insured people. Regression analysis showed a high (91.04%) probability that, among
the insured, the use of preventive health services depended on the person's age, income, and education. For uninsured
residents, the lack of health insurance was the key reason for non-use of preventive health services, while among the
insured, lack of knowledge about the ACA benefit of free access contributed to non-use of preventive services. Expansion
of Medicaid eligibility can increase insurance coverage rates among African Americans and other minority populations.
Health promotion and awareness campaigns about the law's benefits by local and state health departments can enhance the
use of preventive services.

care costs. As well, Partnership for Prevention (2007) has
determined that use of preventive services can minimize hos-
pitalization and reduce costs on the health care system.
But without health insurance, a patient cannot visit a doc-
tor's office to obtain preventive health services. The policy
intent of the law was to expand health insurance coverage
which would provide increased access to preventive health
services for eligible Americans. This intent was expressed in
the standards related to essential health benefits. The ACA
listed preventive services as essential health benefits
(Olchanski, Cohen, & Neumann, 2013).
Despite the ACA provision of free access to preventive
health services, there is a huge gap in the use of those ser-
vices by ethnic minorities including African Americans. It is
not clear whether that gap is due to lack of health insurance
or lack of knowledge about the ACA provision. Our sense,
consistent with existing literature, is that African Americans
appear to have been left behind in terms of access and utiliza-
tion of health care, including preventive health services,
compared with the majority population group (Benjamin &
Lee, 2012; Robinson & Finegold, 2012). Mayberry, Mili,
and Ofili (2000) found that
racial and ethnic groups continued to have poorer access to
quality health care services and different patterns of utilization
relative to white Americans, including a lower use of preventive
services, a greater likelihood of not having a usual source of
care, a greater likelihood of being uninsured. (p. 109)
Several studies (Chou, Tulolo, Raver, Hsu, & Young, 2013;
Fiscella, Franks, Doescher, & Saver, 2002; Gaskin &
Hoffman 2000; Jacobs & Skocpol, 2012; LaVeist, 2005;
Mochari-Greenberger, Liao, & Mosca, 2014; Tarver &
Menachemi, 2014) have investigated racial and ethnic dis-
parities in access to and use of health care services. Findings
from some of these studies indicate that the inability to
access preventive health services is due to lack of health
insurance coverage. In particular, the study by Fiscella et al.
(2002) examined disparities in health care use by race, eth-
nicity, and language among insured Hispanic, non-Hispanic
White, and African American patients. They analyzed differ-
ences in the use of preventive health care services, such as
physician visit, mental health visit, mammography, and
influenza vaccination, and found that African Americans, for
instance, were less likely than non-Hispanic White patients
to receive an influenza vaccination due to lack of health
insurance coverage. This finding is supported by other stud-
ies (Brown, Ojeda, Wyn, & Levan, 2000; Doubeni et al.,
2010; Himmelstein et al., 2007), which demonstrated that
lack of health insurance restricted access to health services,
including preventive screening and diagnostic services, and
treatment and management of health conditions.
In a study on racial and ethnic differences in preventable
hospitalization, Gaskin and Hoffman (2000) found that
African Americans and Hispanics were more likely to be
hospitalized for preventable health conditions. The resort to
hospitalization is due to limited access to a primary care phy-
sician. Patients without health insurance are unable to see
primary care physicians to obtain preventive help before
their conditions worsen. In another study, Gaskin, Dinwiddie,
Chan, and McCleary (2012) found that disparities in health
care utilization are related to both individuals'racial and eth-
nic identity as well as the racial and ethnic composition of
their communities. For this reason, efforts to improve access
to health care services and eliminate health care disparities
for African Americans and other minority groups should not
only focus on individual-level factors but also on commu-
nity-level factors such as residence (i.e., zip codes). This is
because the conditions that persist in certain residential areas
might limit health insurance coverage and access to health
services.
The relative impacts of insurance status and race/ethnicity
on disparities in health service utilization have been investi-
gated extensively (Boss, Smith, & Ishman, 2011; Shelley,
Russell, Parikh, & Fahs, 2011; Shi, Lebrun, & Tsai, 2010).
Most of these studies indicate that although insurance status
and race/ethnicity are each independently associated with
health care service utilization, race/ethnicity had the stronger
association. This finding is corroborated in Chou et al. (2013)
which showed that race is more significant than insurance
status in accounting for disparities in access to health ser-
vices. This indicates that disparities in utilization of health
services persisted in the presence of health insurance cover-
age. As initiatives to reduce such disparities have often
focused on expanding health insurance coverage for vulner-
able populations, it is not clear whether theACAalone would
have significant impact on reducing racial and ethnic dispari-
ties in utilization of preventive health services.
Different aspects of health disparities have persisted for a
long time. Robinson and Finegold (2012) indicate thatAfrican
Americans are less likely to receive preventive care and are
more likely to have chronic diseases such as diabetes and cer-
tain cancers. In general, heart disease and stroke account for
the largest proportion of disparities in life expectancy between
African Americans and non-Latino Whites, despite the exis-
tence of prevention strategies (Freeman, Zonszein, Islam,
Blank, & Strelnick, 2011; Tarver & Menachemi, 2014).
African American women are more likely to be diagnosed
with breast cancer (Rugo et al., 2013; Sturtz, Melley, Mamula,
Shriver, & Ellsworth, 2014; Vadaparampil et al., 2012). All of
this is due to an increase in the number of individuals without
insurance, unequal access to improvements in cancer treat-
ments, and barriers to early detection and screening among
African American women. Given the promise and opportuni-
ties that the ACA holds to address these gaps, it is important
to review the extent to which African Americans have taken
advantage of the provisions of the Act to access and use pre-
ventive health services.
The present study is focused on the problems related to
access and use of preventive health services among African
Eno et al. 3
Americans in the Tallahassee-Leon County area of northwest
Florida. It contributes to the existing literature by examining
the effects of health insurance coverage, and knowledge
about free access to preventive health services under
ObamaCare, on the use of preventive health services. The
survey instrument measured, among others, two indicators of
use of preventive health services. It asked (a) whether a
respondent had health insurance coverage and (b) whether a
respondent had knowledge or was familiar with ObamaCare's
provision that insured people can obtain preventive health
services without co-pay or deductibles. Data were analyzed
to determine the extent of insurance coverage among the tar-
get population as well as the differences in use and non-use
of preventive services among the insured.
Method
Study Area and Population
Tallahassee serves the dual role of state capital of Florida and
the jurisdiction of Leon County. It has three colleges and a
well-educated population made up of professionals in aca-
demia, science, technology, business, arts, and so on. For this
reason, the expectation is that most of the residents would
have employer-based, or some other forms of, health insur-
ance. Official county-level data (Holland, Emerick, &
Howard, 2012) of the distribution of health insurance cover-
age by race/ethnicity and other categories (see Table 1) indi-
cate that majority of residents have health insurance.
Although majority of residents are covered, there is a cov-
erage gap of almost 16% between African Americans and
Whites: the non-Hispanic White population has 93.4%
coverage while the non-Hispanic Black (or African
American) population has 77.6% coverage. This warrants
examination of the extent of lack of insurance amongAfrican
Americans and how that limits their use of preventive health
services.
Based on the 2010 Census, Leon County's total popula-
tion was 275,487 of which 173,480 (63%) were White and
83,520 (about 30%) were African American. Asians,
American Indians, Alaska Natives, Hispanics, and Others
belonging to more than one racial/ethnic group made up the
remaining 7% of the population (U.S. Census Bureau, 2010).
(The 2013 estimate of Leon County population was
"White"--179,396; "Black"--88,694; "Other"--10,287;
"Hispanic origin"--15,694; Total--278,377. By race and
ethnicity, Leon County's population includes 64.4% White,
31.9% Black, and 3.7% Other races. Also, 5.7% of Leon
County residents are of Hispanic origin; Tallahassee-Leon
County Planning Department, 2014). African Americans
constitute the largest minority population of the county.
Sampling Method and Data Collection
The survey area included the subdivisions of Southside,
Frenchtown, and other areas in the city that have large con-
centrations of African Americans. Simple random sampling
was the sampling method used in selecting respondents to
whom the survey instruments were administered. Eight hun-
dred ten printed surveys were administered in the designated
areas during March to April 2012. The survey was devel-
oped from insights gained from the literature related to
problems of health insurance coverage and the low level of
access to and use of preventive health care among minority
populations.
The instrument contained questions that were specifically
worded to find out whether a respondent had health insur-
ance. At least two questions in the second section of the
questionnaire gauged the extent to which respondents used
preventive health care, and whether a respondent's knowl-
edge or familiarity with ObamaCare's provision of free
access to preventive services had affected their decision to
use the services. For example, the third question in Section 2,
"I can't obtain preventive services because I'm unaware of
ACA free access to services," was based on the assumption
that respondents do not typically use preventive health ser-
vices. The question gauged the extent to which use or non-
use of preventive services might be related to the respondent's
degree of knowledge or awareness of the benefit offered by
the health care reform law, namely, removal of the impedi-
ment of co-pay.
In the survey, use of preventive health services is denoted
by doctor's office visit. The underlying logic is that a patient
(or respondent) must first have health insurance coverage
before she or he can visit a physician's office. Some questions
in Section 1 including whether a respondent had health insur-
ance, whether they had a doctor, and how often they visited

doctors' offices validly measured the indicator of use of pre-
ventive services. Furthermore, the rationale for considering
physician office visit as an active measure or indicator of use
of preventive services is that physician visit provides oppor-
tunity not only to obtain general health and wellness checkup
but also a chance to ask questions regarding one's health.
During a patient's visit, the doctor has opportunity to
order tests and referrals, prescribe medications, and even rec-
ommend hospitalization, if needed. Whether it is to obtain
screening for blood pressure, diabetes, cholesterol, depres-
sion, and for early detection of cancers, or to obtain flu shots
and information on treatment and management of chronic
conditions, a visit to the primary care physician is the starting
point for obtaining preventive health care. Without health
insurance, a patient cannot visit a doctor's office to take
advantage of preventive health services. However, even with
health insurance, the need to provide co-pay is often an
impediment that discourages some people from visiting doc-
tor's offices. Therefore, familiarity with ObamaCare's provi-
sion of cost-free access to preventive health care is expected
to increase the rate of use of preventive care among this tar-
get population.
In terms of characteristics, it was a low-cost survey which
had a high degree of sample-population congruence, mean-
ing the sample subjects represented the population from
which the sample was drawn. In other words, as explained
below, majority of the respondents were self-identified adult
African Americans who resided in the designated survey
area. The instrument was in a written form and was adminis-
tered face-to-face to individuals who were able to read and
write their own responses on the survey. It was explained to
respondents that ACA referred to the new health care legisla-
tion signed into law by President Obama, and that it also
meant the same thing as ObamaCare.
As indicated above, simple random sampling was the
sampling process adopted for selecting respondents. In sim-
ple random sampling, each element and combination of ele-
ments (of the population) has an equal chance of being
selected into the sample frame. For this to be possible, a list
of all the elements in the population must be available and a
method is used that ensures that each element has an equal
chance of being selected (Johnson & Reynolds, 2012).
Because there is no existing list of all the elements in the
target population (African Americans in Leon County in the
18-64 age bracket), an estimate was made by disaggregating
the African American population in the county into age
groups based on the 2013 estimate of race and ethnicity cat-
egorization of the county population. From this disaggrega-
tion, 20,620 African Americans are in the 18 to 24 age group;
32,776 are in the 25 to 54 age group; and 7,097 are in the 55
to 64 age bracket, thus amounting to a potential sampling
frame of 60,493. Out of the total target population of 60,493,
a sample size was selected at a significant level of 95%. The
formula offered by Miller and Brewer (2003) was used to
determine the sample size:

where n is the sample size (i.e., number of respondents sur-
veyed), N is the sampling frame (the total target population,
that is, African Americans in the 18-64 age bracket), and  is
the error margin (0.05). The calculation for the sample size
based on this formula is shown below:

respondents
Based on this formula, only 397 persons can be sampled
from a target population of 60,493 people. To mitigate a low
sample size, it was decided to increase the sample size to
more than double the number of people that could be sam-
pled using the Miller and Brewer formula. In this regard, it
was decided to administer 810 surveys. It should be noted
that this was an arbitrary number which met the expressed
need of having a reasonable sample size. Survey administra-
tion entailed traveling in the defined area and politely can-
vasing individuals who, through oral questioning,
self-identified themselves as African Americans in the 18 to
64 age range.
The survey contained open-ended as well as close-ended
questions. The open-ended questions required respondents to
select from a 5-point Likert-type scale response menu of
options: strongly agree, agree, undecided/do not know, dis-
agree, and strongly disagree (seeAppendixA).The Statistical
Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) Version 22 was used
for running the frequency analysis on the data set as well as
multivariable regression modeling.
Results
Of the 810 surveys distributed, 798 were retrieved and ana-
lyzed. The distribution of respondents in terms of race
showed that 524 were African Americans, representing 66%
of the respondents. The other 274 respondents were Whites,
Hispanics, and so on, representing 24% of the sample. Of the
524 African American respondents, 382 (73%) had health
insurance while 142 (27%) had no health insurance. A major-
ity of the uninsured respondents, 87 (61%), indicated that
they use emergency rooms whenever they become ill. Of the
382 respondents who had insurance, 332 (87%) indicated
that they used preventive health services, meaning they
checked "disagree" and "strongly disagree" to the question:
"I'm for the most part unable to visit doctor's office for regu-
lar checkup because I don't have health insurance." Use of
preventive health services is measured by ability to visit doc-
tor's office; in other words, physician visit is the proxy for
"use of preventive health services."
Because it was explained to respondents that, in the con-
text of this study, doctor's office visits were specifically for
the purpose of asking for and receiving health and wellness
screenings and counseling services, the responses they
Eno et al. 5
offered represented indication of actual use of preventive
services and not just ability to access those services. Of the
50 insured respondents who do not use preventive health
services, 30 (60%) claim they did not use preventive ser-
vices because they were unaware that they could obtain
those services without cost as mandated by the ACA. This
result suggests that a person might have health insurance
and yet not use preventive health services because they are
unaware of the free access to those services under the ACA.
Although this is a small fraction of the insured, it is impor-
tant to target them with outreaches and educational cam-
paigns so that they can take full advantage of the benefits of
preventive health care.
In addition to the percentage distribution of the responses,
there is also graphical representation of the results in the
form of bar charts. The charts display the relationship
between age, education, and income, and the use of preven-
tive health care. As well, regression analysis is deployed as
additional tool for analyzing these relationships. It should be
noted that although other variables such as the social deter-
minants of health, historical, and cultural issues are signifi-
cant for explaining access to and use of preventive health
care among minority population, this study is focused on the
role of health insurance coverage and knowledge about the
policy innovation of ObamaCare in explaining the potential
use of preventive services among this population.
Discussion
With regard to how demographic characteristics of age, edu-
cation, and income determine the use of preventive health
services among African Americans, Figure 1 presents the age
distribution of the insured respondents who do not use pre-
ventive health services.
It shows that 75% of insured respondents who do not use
preventive care are in the 18 to 24 years age group. Most of
the respondents were neither aware of the availability of pre-
ventive services nor the ACA mandate that they could obtain
the services without a co-pay. The implication of non-use of
preventive health services by a large percentage of insured
young people is that they would add to the pressure experi-
enced by hospital emergency rooms. This is because they
would seek urgent treatment when they become ill from an
avoidable health condition, which would have been detected
and prevented had they visited their doctor's office. Informing
young African Americans about availability of cost-free pre-
ventive health services and the benefits of those services can
avoid illnesses which can be costly in the long term. For
instance, if 19-year-old young adults get the flu vaccine in
time, they are reducing the risk of getting infected with the
flu virus. They could also avoid treatment which is more
expensive than getting a flu shot.
With regard to the relationship between educational
attainment and use of preventive health services, Figure 2
presents the educational level of insured respondents who do
not use preventive services.
The bar chart shows that about 55% of insured respon-
dents who do not use preventive services indicate their edu-
cational attainment as "some college." It indicates that less
educated respondents tend not to use preventive care as much
as the more educated respondents. It suggests that there
might be a link between a respondent's level of education
and their willingness and ability to seek and utilize informa-
tion about preventive care. This is a subject examined in
Richardson, Allen, and Xiao (2012). Disseminating informa-
tion about ObamaCare preventive (or essential) health bene-
fits to the less educated members of the African American
community in the Tallahassee-Leon county area can

potentially result in increased rate of utilization of preventive
services.
As shown in Figure 3, about 49% of insured respondents
who do not use preventive services are in the US$0 to
US$15,999 income bracket.
The bar chart indicates that low-income respondents do
not use preventive health services as frequently as higher
income respondents, even though they are insured. This
could possibly be attributed to their inability, or unwilling-
ness, to access information and use preventive health ser-
vices. There is an urgent need to inform low-income people
of the availability and benefits of free access to preventive
health services under the ACA.
While the survey data show that a large number ofAfrican
American respondents have health insurance, a small frac-
tion of those respondents did not use preventive health ser-
vices. This indicates that lack of health insurance was not the
only reason for non-use of preventive health services. An
important limiting factor was lack of knowledge or aware-
ness that preventive health services are free for the insured
under the ACA. Other limiting factors were the age, educa-
tion, and income of insured people. Regression analysis was
deployed to further amplify the evidence in the bar charts
and the accompanying discussion. For the purpose of regres-
sion analysis, "age," "education," and "income" are regarded
as independent variables while the dependent variable is "use
of preventive health services."
Regression models are useful for understanding the rela-
tionship between a dependent variable, Y, and one or more
independent variables, X
1
, X
2
, to X
n
. Specifically, binary
logistic regression is used here because the dependent vari-
able "use of preventive health services" is a dichotomous
variable (those with health insurance who use preventive ser-
vices, and those with health insurance who do not use pre-
ventive care services). The model as shown in Appendix B
predicts the effect of age, education, and income on use of
preventive services. The regression analysis showed that the
p value is .9104, where p is the probability of using preven-
tive care services for the values of age, income, and educa-
tion. This suggests a high probability (91.04%) that age,
income, and education are determinants of the use of preven-
tive health services among the insured: the younger, less edu-
cated insured respondents tend not to use preventive services
compared with the older, more educated, and higher income
respondents.
However, it is clear that there is a significant overlap
among the age, education, and income variables regarding
the use of preventive services. As the figures show, a large
proportion of the young people in the 18 to 24 age bracket,
who do not use preventive services, are also college

educated, meaning that getting higher education may not
translate into awareness about ObamaCare's cost-free access
to preventive services and actual use of the services. It is pos-
sible that the rate of use of preventive services among these
age and education categories has not improved because
young college students typically feel that they are healthy
and do not care much about health insurance and preventive
health care. Even with health insurance and familiarity with
the ObamaCare provision, they do not care about visiting
doctors' offices to obtain preventive services because they
consider such a waste of their time.
Conclusion and Recommendations
Taken together, lack of health insurance is the main reason
that a significant number of uninsured respondents could not
visit doctors' offices and, therefore, could not obtain preven-
tive health services. Although a majority of insured respon-
dents used preventive health services, a small number did not
because they were not aware of the ACA mandate that the
services can be obtained without cost. Survey data also
showed that the majority of uninsured respondents resorted
to hospital emergency rooms to obtain both emergency and
non-emergency care: 61% of respondents without health
insurance used hospital emergency rooms whenever they are
ill. This finding suggests that hospitals bear the burden of
providing uncompensated care that not only poses financial
difficulties for them but also increases health care costs for
the insured. This is possible because the insured subsidize
the cost of providing care for the uninsured by paying higher
health insurance premiums (Pagan & Pauly, 2006).
To address the problem of uncompensated care, the ACA
intended for large numbers of uninsured people to be cov-
ered so that they can visit their primary care doctors to
receive preventive care instead of depending on hospital
emergency rooms. The law sought to achieve expanded
health insurance coverage by mandating U.S. states to
expand Medicaid eligibility, which would potentially cut in
half the uninsurance rates (Garfield, Damico, Stephens, &
Rouhani, 2014). However, the mandate was struck down by
the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court decision in National
Federation of Independent Business, et al., v. Sebelius, 2012
(132 US 2566 [2012]) made the mandate optional, rather
than required, meaning that states can choose whether to
expand their Medicaid programs.
The fact that states have adopted different strategies in
their effort to extend health insurance coverage to the unin-
sured indicates that uninsurance remains an urgent public
policy concern. It is in this context that a consensus of schol-
ars (Ghitza & Tai, 2014; Loosier et al., 2014) have suggested
that governmental jurisdictions need to be more proactive in
finding ways to provide some form of coverage for vulnera-
ble individuals regardless of their ability to pay. But it is
common knowledge that states are confronted with multiple
budgetary and political constraints, which limit their capac-
ity to provide health insurance coverage for all needy
individuals.
In sum, the continuing controversies and constraints
related to expanding health insurance coverage to uninsured
Americans, including vulnerable minority populations, do
not offer any easy or conclusive answers. However, this

increase health insurance coverage. With expanded health
insurance coverage, a large number of uninsured people can
visit primary care physicians' offices to receive preventive
health services. There is also a need for outreach to enlighten
citizens on the law's provision of free access to preventive
health services so that they can utilize the services and
improve their health outcomes.
Policy Implications and Recommendations
Our results have some implications for policy and future
research. To address the problems associated with uninsur-
ance, it is necessary to implement the ACA or ObamaCare in
all its essence to ensure that no eligible American is denied
coverage. One outcome of uninsurance is the burden of
uncompensated care on hospitals which results from having
to treat and care for people who otherwise would have
avoided illness if they had access to and used preventive
health services. In addition to expansion of Medicaid rolls in
states, the ACA also provided for the establishment of state
and federal insurance exchanges (or insurance marketplaces).
Establishing exchanges and expanding Medicaid in more
states have already resulted in increased coverage in some
states as indicated in a recent study (Witters, 2014).
However, Florida has refused to expand Medicaid, and a
significant number of residents remain uninsured. It is esti-
mated that if Florida expands Medicaid eligibility, upward of
80,000 uninsured people, majority of whom are African
Americans would become insured (Mitchell, 2014). The
issue of Medicaid expansion is so divisive in Florida along
party lines. However, there is somewhat of an acknowledg-
ment on both sides of the aisle in the Florida Legislature that
the state needs to address the problem of uninsurance as
Florida is one of the states with the highest uninsurance rates.
The problem is lack of agreement on the modalities to
achieve the goal of expanded health insurance coverage of
the poor and some in the middle class who are caught up in
the coverage gap (Clemans-Cope, Kenney, Buettgens,
Carroll, & Blavin, 2012; Garfield et al., 2014). It is hoped
that Florida political leaders at the Cabinet and Legislature
levels would resolve their political and policy differences
and agree on implementation of Medicaid expansion.
Other interventions such as health promotion and educa-
tional campaigns can increase awareness within under-
served communities about the availability and benefits of
preventive health services. Health promotion and educa-
tional outreaches can be implemented at the community
level. State and local health authorities such as the Leon
County Health Department and the Florida Department of
Health can consider using social media strategies. These
strategies can be deployed to enlighten theAfricanAmerican
community in the Tallahassee-Leon County area about the
ACA's provision of free access to preventive health ser-
vices. Similar communities in other parts of the state can
benefit from such outreaches.
Agenda for Future Research
The present study was limited to a small part of the state of
Florida, and the survey data were drawn from a sample made
up mostly of African American residents in the Tallahassee-
Leon County area. However, the analysis can be extrapolated
to explain how other African American communities in other
areas that have characteristics similar to Tallahassee-Leon
County might fare regarding health insurance and use of pre-
ventive health services.
Future research can target an expanded area such as a
number of counties in the Big Bend or other regions in
Florida. Some inter-county or inter-regional comparisons
can also be done to gain a broader perspective on how the
typical minority population in a given region might perform
in terms of health insurance coverage and use of preventive
care. This can yield different insights on the issues of lack of
insurance and use of preventive health services.

Appendix B
Regression Model of Relationship Between Demographic Characteristics and Use of Preventive Health
Services
Use of preventive health services is estimated as follows:
log(p/[1 - p]) = constant + coefficient(X)
or
p/(1 - p) = econstant + coefficient × X
where
"log" is the natural logarithm;
"e" is Euler's number, a constant whose value is 2.71828.
"p/(1 - p)" is the odds
where
p is the probability (expressed as odds in binary logistic regression) of using preventive care services by those with health
insurance at the given values of the independent variables. The given values are derived from the SPSS data set which was used
to run the binary regression.
This odds is transformed into natural log of the odds as follows:
log(p/1 - p).
Coefficient(X) is the coefficient for independent variable X. As there are multiple independent variables, age, income, and
education, the equation is
log(p/[1- p]) = constant + Coefficient 1 × Age + Coefficient 2 × Income + Coefficient 3 × Education.
The result of the equation predicts the influence of independent variables age, income, and education on the dichotomous
dependent variable (use of preventive care services or non-use of preventive care services).
The test results (derived from "Variables in the Equation" in SPSS data output) showed the value of constant as 2.064:
The coefficient derived for age is 0.391, the coefficient for income is 0.149, and the coefficient for education is -0.285.
Substituting these values in above equation we get:
log(p/[1 - p]) = 2.064 + 0.391 × Age + 0.149 × Income + (-0.285) × Education
If age, income, and education each has a value of 1, the equation becomes:
log(p/[1 - p]) = 2.064 + 0.391 × 1 + 0.149 ×0 1 + (-0.285) × 1 = 2.319
To remove the natural logarithm, both sides of the equation are raised by the Euler's constant e whose value is 2.71828,

income 0.149 .087 2.911 1 .088 1.160
education -0.285 .134 4.528 1 .033 0.752
Constant 2.064 .569 13.154 1 .000 7.878
aVariable(s) entered on Step 1: age, income, education.
Eno et al. 11
loge(p/[1 - p]) = 2.319
e loge(p/[1 - p]) = e2.319
or
p/(1 - p) = e2.319
So, 2.71828 raised to the power 2.319 is 10.17.
p/(1 - p) = 2.71828 (2.319) = 10.17
p/(1 - p) = 10.17
Simplifying by multiplying both sides of the equation by (1 - p), the equation becomes,
p = 10.17 × (1 - p)
p = 10.17 × 1 - 10.17 × p = 10.17 ­ 10.17p
Taking the 10.17p from the right-hand side to left-hand side, the equation becomes
p + 10.17p = 10.17
11.17p = 10.17
Dividing both sides by 11.17 we get
p = 10.17 / 11.17
Solving for the value of p
p = .9104
where p is the probability of using preventive care services for the values of age, income, and education.
