Introduction
The main objective of this article is to analyze the process
involved in the embodiment and subjectivity of transsexual
and travesti (Latin word to transvestite) individuals and the
relations of the embodiment process with their labor activi-
ties. The intention is to analyze whether the visibility of their
gender identity as transgender individuals manifested on their
bodies may produce stigmas, discrimination, and exclusion
from the mainstream social, organizational, and economic
settings, consequently affecting their choices and possibilities
of labor activities. For this purpose, a qualitative study was
carried out with 30 Brazilian transsexuals and travestis, in an
attempt to understand how such process occurs.
This research is relevant for the field of organizational
studies for three main reasons: First, we consider the dimen-
sion of the study corpus that approaches travestis and trans-
sexuals important within a social context that is apart from
the Anglo­Saxon axis. Second, this article investigates the
relationship between the bodies of travestis and transsexuals
and the work they perform, that is, it examines how the bod-
ies of travestis and transsexuals affect their labor practices,
which is an issue that has been just sparsely studied (Thanem,
2011). Last, but not least, studies on gay, lesbian, bisexual,
and transgender (GLBT) labor remain underrepresented in
organizational studies (Creed & Cooper, 2008).
Above all, it must be emphasized how difficult it was to
collect the data presented in this study. The research path
brought many difficulties. Actually, working with travestis
and transsexuals requires different perception from research-
ers, as well as great sensitivity. This happens because nor-
mality, or what is referred to as normal and accepted as such,
causes various groups to be excluded and perceived as abnor-
mal or abject because of their bodies (Thanem, 2003). The
problem worsens when the topic of sexuality is brought up
because, as Foucault (1988) tells us, much was said about
sex in the 20th century, but little was allowed for exercising
it. Coming from the private sphere, the topic of sexuality has
invaded the public sphere. Yet, it has remained as knowledge
mostly pertaining to the medical and legal fields.
For this reason, the first part of this article debates the
major theories in organizational studies that concern the
human body, and then we attempt to understand the relation-
ship involving body, embodiment, and gender. Afterward,
the concepts of travesti and transsexual and some aspects of
the labor activity of such individuals are discussed. Following
that, the methodology is presented, and the data analysis is
performed, leading to some relevant conclusions.

When Invisibility Is Impossible: Body,
Subjectivity, and Labor Among Travestis
and Transsexuals
Eloisio Moulin de Souza1 and Alexandre de Pádua Carrieri2
Abstract
The main goal of this article is to analyze the relationship involving subjectivity, embodiment, and labor activity among travestis
and transsexuals. We recognize that bodies are invested by various discourses and power relations, which produce normal
and abnormal bodies in society, establishing the intelligibility of the body through gender categories. Beyond that, the body is
an active element in the production of one's subjectivity. Transgender people are considered abnormal in the binary gender
matrix of intelligibility, which makes them more susceptible to be stigmatized, discriminated, and socially excluded. As for
labor, it has been observed that the bodies of travestis and transsexuals may represent an obstacle for the obtaining of formal
jobs.

Body and Gender in Organizational
Studies
The study of the human body is not a novelty in business
administration. Since the beginning of the systematization of
business studies, the body was a topic already present in the-
ories that perceived organizations as entities. Frederick
Taylor, with his concepts of time and motion, and Henry
Ford with the assembly line, had already had human body as
the main subject of analysis, in their intention to improve
control as a means of increasing production. Parker (2000),
for example, has described Fordism as the systematic manip-
ulation of human muscles. Even along the premises of the
Human Relations approach, the concept was no different, for
if one starts from the idea there is a division between body
and mind, this idea will also elaborate forms of controlling
body production by controlling the minds of workers. This
was carried out by means of management of the informal
groups, which workers belonged to.
Thanem (2003) stresses the research on the body, and
embodiment began to be intensified in the field of adminis-
tration only from the 1990s on. Among such works, it is
worth noting the works published by Acker (1990); Barry
and Hazen (1996); Dale (2001); Hassard, Holliday, and
Wilmott (2000); and Hetrick and Boje (1992) as important to
this process. Thanem (2003) points out that most research
articles that study the body emphasize its forms of organiza-
tion, regulation, and normalization, whereas the studies that
approach bodies as an element of resistance and disruption of
socially established standards are still peripheral.
In fact, many organizational researches have sought to
understand the objectification of the body by organizations
(Acker, 1990; Hetrick & Boje, 1992; Holliday & Thompson,
2001; McDowell & Court, 1994), by approaching the body
as a passive and inert object, characterized by power rela-
tions. This analysis perspective is based on the classic
Cartesian division between mind and body, in which the
body is seen as a passive object, modeled and tagged by
social forces. This approach does not perceive the body as an
agent that resists against processes of objectification and
standardization, nor as an active element in the production of
subjectivities. In this respect, this article intends to disrupt
with this logic and to highlight the role of the body and the
embodiment process as active components in the subjectivity
construction (Thanem, 2011).
Dale and Burrell (2000) claim that bodies can be restruc-
tured, and the self-image projected by the body can be recre-
ated. The body alone is no longer viewed as an organic
system of interrelated parts, but instead, as an extension of
the self. As Brewis and Sinclair (2000) have shown, the rela-
tionships individuals establish with their bodies are an
important part of the way they perceive themselves and form
their subjectivity. Works such as those by Bahnisch (2000),
Ball (2005), Brewis and Sinclair, Dale (2001), and Letiche
(2000) are incipient to consider the body as something active
and to break with the Cartesian view of the body. In fact, the
work by Parker (2000) reaches the point of considering the
joint action of the body with non-human actors during the
process of subjective production.
The body is an important element in subjectification pro-
cesses, especially in the construction of identities and subjec-
tivities (Adelman & Ruggi, 2008). Of course the
understanding by which a person recognizes herself or him-
self as masculine or feminine is generally based on the
embodiment process related to gender. It means that mascu-
linity and femininity operate as discursive labels involved in
power relations that compel human beings to act and behave
in specific ways, while offering ontological spaces for indi-
viduals to occupy and delimiting the gender possibilities (the
body constitutes the self and is also restructured by it, con-
versely). Indeed gender is neither ahistorical nor transcen-
dental (Brewis, Hampton, & Linstead, 1997), and gender is
neither something that someone has nor something that
someone is (Phillips & Knowles, 2012). Gender is some-
thing that someone does and undoes (Butler, 2004; Phillips
& Knowles, 2012) and not a property of individuals (Linstead
& Pullen, 2006). The process involving doing and undoing
gender by the repetition of discursive norms is called perfor-
mativity (Butler, 1993), and the logic present in these discur-
sive norms produces intelligible genders (Butler, 1990).
Therefore, intelligible genders are "those which in some
sense institute and maintain relations of coherence and con-
tinuity among sex, gender, sexual practice, and desire"
(Butler, 1990, p. 23). For Butler (1990), the main effect of
the intelligible genders is the control and prohibition of any
forms of incoherent embodiment, searching to establish a
determinist connection among one's biological sex and the
cultural genders, hence constructing a sense of "natural con-
nection between genitals and gender identity" (Schilt &
Connell, 2007, p. 602). In other words, the gendered body is
discursively constructed and disciplined by power relations
(Thanem, 2011). Bodies that do not follow or disrupt this
intelligibility are considered abject (Adelman & Ruggi,
2008; Thanem, 2003) and, therefore, outside the matrix of
intelligibility.
However, despite the repeated citation of norms, perfor-
mativity always escapes from its ideal identity because the
"ongoing performance of identity merely involves a
repeated citation of, or an `aiming for' an ideal state which
doesn't actually exist . . ." (Kenny & Euchler, 2012, p. 310).
In other words, performance is the fantasy of a fantasy, and
for this reason, all performance demonstrates the contin-
gency of gender identity and the potential of change and
subversion contained in such. The performance is not a
mimetic reenactment. All repetition is unstable and opens
the possibility of subversion that creates gender trouble
(Butler, 1990). In this sense, the binarism masculine versus
feminine "cannot refract the fluidity that characterizes the
embodied experience of gender" (Linstead & Pullen, 2006,
p. 1288).
De Souza and Carrieri 3
Gender is always multiple, heterogeneous, and a constant
process of becoming (Linstead & Pullen, 2006). Beyond
that, the gender fluidity "is not merely movement across a
binary boundary . . . or across several horizontal boundaries
between multiples identities. Identity is motion and fluidity.
It dissolves boundaries and carries them off in its flood"
(Linstead & Pullen, 2006, p. 1305). For instance, Connell
(2010) demonstrates that transgender individuals have the
capability to do (reinforcing attributes associated with femi-
ninity and masculinity), undo (disrupting the gender binary),
and redo (resetting attributes associated with femininity and
masculinity) gender, simultaneously. In this regard, Thanem
(2011) also asserts that travestis perform gender without
desiring to be permanently masculine or feminine, not only
disrupting the binary logic of gender but also undoing the
very gender (Thanem & Wallenberg, in press). Despite trans-
gender people to be appointed relevant in the process of
undoing and redoing gender (Connell, 2010), however, spe-
cifically in the context of the formal workplace, due they to
search to keep their job security and to maintain friendly
relationships, their possibilities to make gender trouble and
undoing gender are limited (Schilt & Connell, 2007).
Therefore, as mentioned before, the aim of this article is
to analyze the embodiment process as well as how the body
of travestis and transsexuals influences their stigmatization
in labor activities. To do so, it seeks to understand the rela-
tionships between embodiment and labor activity of the par-
ticipants studied. Hence, the next section presents the debate
on the definitions concerning travestis and transsexuals, as
well as the relations between their bodies and their labor.
Travestis and Transsexuals: Body,
Gender, and Labor
To Namaste (2006), transsexuals are individuals born with a
biological sex (male or female) but who identify themselves
as members of the opposite sex. To do so, they often take
hormones and undergo surgery to reshape their genitalia.
However, for this author, the term transgender means some-
thing more comprehensive, which includes all forms of sexu-
ality that do not fit the normative relations of sex and gender,
such as drag queens, drag kings, transsexuals, and travestis.
Benedetti (2005) and Namaste consider that travestis and
transsexuals maintain direct relationships with the opposite
gender of birth, and both authors define such individuals as
transgender. Nevertheless, the definitions about transsexuals
and travestis are not that simple. As Hines (2006) asserts,
there are many distinct subjectivities under the transsexual
and travesti labels.
The author affirms that such specific identities are singu-
larly situated and experienced by each individual, and "many
transgender individuals articulate gender identities that fall
beyond a traditional binary framework" (Hines, 2006, p. 63).
It means that the identity of transgender people is not only
restricted to circulate between a binary and opposite female
and male poles. Opposing this assumption, Thanem and
Wallenberg (in press) affirm that travestis express in the
same time feminine and masculine forms of embodiment,
therefore undoing gender. However, although this is a chal-
lenge, it does not dismantle the hegemonic forms of gender.
For this reason, travestis and transsexuals cannot be homo-
geneously conceptualized, and the particular experiences
they go through produce differences within each category.
As Perucchi, Brandão, Berto, Rodrigues, and DaSilva (2014)
state, there is an intimate relation between transgender sub-
jectivity and the construction of their bodies.
Hence, the term transgender is used in this article as an
umbrella term to refer to people who do not follow the gender
assigned at birth (Connell, 2010; Thanem, 2011). It may
encompass travestis, transsexuals, cross-dressers, drag
queens and kings, genderqueers, intersexual, and agenderist
individuals, among others. In fact, the definition includes "all
individuals who embody and express a gender identity which
diverges from the binary distinction . . . between female and
male" (Thanem, 2011, p. 192). Finally, precisely for disrupt-
ing the binary logic of gender, the embodiment of transgender
individuals brings along social trouble and exclusion.
As for gender, it is important to understand that transsexu-
als, unlike travestis, do not consider themselves as transgen-
der individuals, because they do not see their bodies, identities,
or lives as a part of a larger process of change that aims to
break with the sex/gender binarism (Namaste, 2006).
However, the bodies of travestis call such binarism into ques-
tion, for these individuals remain between the borders of men
and women bodies, for they simultaneously present charac-
teristics that are socially considered belonging to women
(e.g., breasts) and men (e.g., the penis). In contrast, transsexu-
als wish to fit into only one of these binary categories.
The concept and understanding about what a transsexual
individual and a travesti are also change according to social
and cultural contexts. Specifically, in a study on Brazilian
travestis, Kulick (1997) found that such individuals consider
sexuality rather than gender as the main constitutive element
of their identities. Thus, transvestisms are not only a matter
of gender in the Brazilian context. Furthermore, both trans-
sexual and travesti individuals in Brazil wish to undergo hor-
mone replacement, but travestis tend to use most often the
corporal insertion of silicone, in order to change the form of
their body (Perucchi et al., 2014). The main difference
between travesti and transsexual individuals in Brazil is that
although transsexuals undergo sex reassignment surgery,
travestis prefer to keep their penis and do not undergo a reas-
signment surgery. In addition to that, differently from
Sweden, where a travesti can be "part-time travesti" for
some hours during the day (Thanem & Wallenberg, in press),
in Brazilian culture, for someone to be considered a travesti,
it is necessary to act as a travesti full-time; otherwise, they
are classified not as a travesti but as a cross-dresser or drag
queen, for instance. This happens because, as mentioned
before, it is very usual among Brazilian travestis to undergo
4 SAGE Open
silicone injection as well as clandestine procedures to have
artificial breasts and a huge gluteus, which consequently
transform their bodies and make them visible travestis 24 hr
a day.
In the context of Brazil, due to the visibility of their body
modifications, travestis break with the idea of normality and
correction in the correlation among sex, gender, and sexual-
ity, facing enormous difficulties and challenges in their daily
lives (Tauches, 2006). In addition, their bodies are consid-
ered by what Thanem (2003) named "contested and mon-
strous bodies." On this aspect, Namaste (2006) also stresses
that transsexuals are also subject to social discrimination in a
variety of ways. Unlike discrimination against sexuality, in
which the individual can resort to strategies of hiding, it is
not possible to travestis to do so because of their corporal
visibility (Button, 2001; Griffith & Hebl, 2002).
As to the embodiment process as a set of regulatory prac-
tices, the heterosexual matrix through which identities
related to gender and sexuality become intelligible means
that some identities cannot exist. That is the case of identities
that break with or do not follow the determinist relation
involving sex­gender­sexuality (Butler, 1990). For Butler
(1990), such relation is political and instituted by cultural
laws. Therefore, they operate as a regulator of the meaning of
sexuality. Nevertheless, many identities fail to follow such
norms of "intelligibility," and they appear only as develop-
mental failures or logical impossibilities form within that
domain. Their persistence and proliferation, however, pro-
vide critical opportunities to expose the limits and regulatory
aims of the "intelligibility" domain (Butler, 1990, p. 24).
Heteronormativity is supported by cultural, legal, and insti-
tutional practices, which reinforce the logic that the sex of
birth determines the gender and the belief that only two pos-
sible genders exist (masculine or feminine; Schilt &
Westbrook, 2009).
These discursive norms force individuals to fit into a sin-
gle genre but never into both. Therefore, gender and sexual-
ity operate at the personal, interpersonal, and institutional
levels (Tauches, 2006). At the personal level, society dictates
what is considered normal for a person in terms of gender
identity and sexuality. At the interpersonal level, when two
people interact, appearance, behavior, gesture, body, and
social norms act together to create attributions and categories
founded on gender and sexuality. Finally, at the institutional
level, gender and sexuality are organized in a hierarchy in
which men, masculinity, and heterosexuality are valued in
comparison with women, femininity, and homosexuality
(Tauches, 2006).
An example of how heteronormativity acts at the per-
sonal, interpersonal, and institutional levels operates in the
workplace and can be verified in Schilt and Westbrook's
(2009) research. This work shows transgender individuals
trying to adjust themselves in the workplace according to
heteronormativity. Female to male transgender individuals
follow men's behavior and conduct, searching to accomplish
tasks considered appropriated to masculine abilities and to
become "one of the guys." However, despite the fact that all
variations of transgender individuals suffer discrimination at
the workplace (Connell, 2010), there are differences among
them. In the case of Female to Male (FTM) transgender,
becoming a man can bring prestigious and more opportuni-
ties at work. On the contrary, in the case of Male to Female
(MTF), this choice often causes the loss of power positions
in the workplace hierarchy (Connell, 2010; Schilt & Connell,
2007). In other words, identities that do not follow the hege-
monic gender norms can perform gender in a negative way.
This means that identities that problematize gender become
unlivable or less livable (Thanem & Wallenberg, in press).
Stigma can take different forms, such as race, sexual pref-
erence, and religion, among others. However, individuals
with multifaceted gender identities as transgender acquire
more social visibility because of their body and embodiment
process and become more subject to being socially stigma-
tized (Creed & Cooper, 2008). When invisibility is not pos-
sible and visible gender identities are socially stigmatized,
such identities are marginalized in the workplace (Creed &
Scully, 2000). Transgender individuals are targets of hate
crimes, physical violence, and labor market discrimination
(Thanem, 2011). The few transgender people who get a suc-
cessful career in formal organizations conceal their gender
identity at the workplace, and due to transphobia present in
many societies, it is not easy for transgender individuals to
be hired, to be promoted, or to keep their positions at formal
organizations. This fact compels transgender people to work
in prostitution and other illegitimate forms of work to sur-
vive (Thanem, 2011). To be a prostitute usually means to be
physically, socially, and morally dirty, but it also provides
opportunity to perform gender differently, hence creating
problems with gender (Brewis & Linstead, 2000; Tyler,
2012), and this perception of the prostitution constitutes its
activity as being a form of abject labor (Tyler, 2012).
In Brazil, transgender individuals are not treated as human
beings. They live and work in violent environments, and
many do not live up to the old age (Antunes & Mercadante,
2013). Many transgender individuals in Brazil work in pros-
titution (Cortez, Boer, & Baltieri, 2011), and some common
characteristics among transgender people who work in pros-
titution are poor education, low social-economic level, drugs
and alcohol use, and unprotected sexual relations with a large
number of sexual partners, which make them more suscepti-
ble to AIDS (Cortez et al., 2011; Perucchi et al., 2014).
Besides, travesti sex workers suffer more discrimination,
even when they do not work with prostitution, because of
their appearance (Cortez et al., 2011).
However, despite all this, one of the most common trans-
gender complaints in Brazil is the inability to use their social
name by which they identify themselves (Perucchi et al.,
2014). Although being a MTF or a FTM transgender and not
being able to change their names to a female/male name
make such individuals more susceptible to discrimination
De Souza and Carrieri 5
due to the visibility of their transgender condition. In Brazil,
it is not easy to change one's birth name as it is in countries
such as the United Kingdom. Changing the birth name is not
allowed by Brazilian laws, and it can be done only when a
person goes through a very expensive judicial process that
does not give any guarantee to be successful in the end of this
process. Also, besides cost and uncertainty of success in this
endeavor, the judicial process takes decades to be
concluded.
Method
This research was developed with the participation of partici-
pants who worked formally or informally in the four state
capitals of southeastern Brazil: Belo Horizonte, São Paulo,
Rio de Janeiro, and Vitória. The participants who compose
the group of interest for this research proposal are travestis
and transsexuals. To describe the methodology of the
research, the corresponding techniques used are presented
below, followed by data analysis.
The proposed research was developed from a qualitative
methodology, for according to Denzin and Lincoln (2003),
this is a possibility for the construction of theoretical models
of intelligibility, for the study of things that are not accessible
directly, neither in their organization nor in their processes.
On account of the uniqueness and delicacy of the theme to be
studied, it was necessary to use qualitative research as meth-
odology. The operationalization of the research field
involved, at first, reaching associations that support homo-
sexuals, especially lesbians, travestis, and transsexuals, in
each of the four capitals of southeastern Brazil. An example
was the Centro de Luta pela Livre Orientação Sexual
(CELLOS)inMinasGerais(FightforFreeSexualOrientation
Center, in English). The research was conduct by two
research groups: Núcleo de Estudos Organizacionais e
Sociedade (NEOS; Nucleus of Organizational and Society
Studies, at Federal University of Minas Gerais) and Grupo
de Estudo sobre Poder em Organizações (GEPO; Study
Group on Power at Organizations, at Federal University of
Espírito Santo), totalizing six research fellows and two
researchers.
To limit the selection of research participants, the snow-
ball method (Gray, Williamson, & Karp, 2007) was used. In
this method, the selection is built throughout the research
process, following further indications from the very research
participants. Selecting the research participants intentionally is
an important aspect of any qualitative research. This technique
was adopted because we consider that a technique aligned
with qualitative methodology should focus on singularity.
Therefore, it would contradict the generalization of human
experiences. Moreover, the oral history of the individuals'
lives falls into such precepts, valuing the unique and particular
events experienced by participants. The oral history favors the
restitution of circumstances, from the description of the very
agent involved in these events, without aiming to cross the
borders of particularity. Furthermore, the life history of indi-
viduals allows researchers to reconstruct relationships con-
cerning society, a given group, and the participants
themselves (Rhodes & Pullen, 2009).
At the field, researchers had to revise the methodology
that had been previously defined. Initially, all interviews
were supposed to be recorded and filmed. However, the vio-
lence to which the participants who participated in this
research are subjected forced a change in the methodological
strategies. Thus, interviews were recorded whenever possi-
ble, reaching a total of 24 travestis and 6 transsexuals.
Among the 24, 2 interviews with travestis were filmed.
However, part of our data about travestis derives from non-
recorded interviews, annotated in field diaries. This added to
the total, reaching 30 MTF transgender people, mainly with
the participation of travestis. This was the most withdrawn
group to take part in the research.
Before the interview, researchers explained to the trans-
gender individuals the main goal of the research, presented
the term of ethical conduct, and asked them to record the
interview. As already said, some travestis authorized only to
be interviewed and observed at their work on the street as
prostitutes, without recording their voices. All interviews
were conducted following a semi-structured script, recorded
and transcribed or annotated in field diaries. This procedure
was developed carefully to preserve the faithful reproduction
of the speeches and avoid cuts or additions. The interview
questions were developed with the participation of focus
groups with six travestis and six transsexuals, separately. In
the meetings, participants narrated their own life experi-
ences, mainly focused on the theme of labor (Rhodes &
Pullen, 2009). From the focus groups, the semi-structured
interview was outlined. After processing the data, the partici-
pants were named using female pseudonyms, to protect their
identities and the confidentiality of any evidence that could
identify them. In general, all participants worked either for-
mally--in formal public jobs or as entrepreneurs--or infor-
mally in prostitution and moonlighting. The data were
analyzed by referring back to the literature review presented
in this article and comparing it with the empirical material
produced.
Subjectivity and Embodiment of
Travesti and Transsexual Individuals
As Benedetti (2005) has stated, both transsexuals and traves-
tis experience social and subjective distress associated with
their bodies. This feeling of suffering is manifested early in
the life of such individuals, which can be clearly evidenced
in the speech by Natasha: "At age 14, my family was already
able to notice my effeminate ways, you know? At that time,
homosexuality was a disease, so my family sent me to a psy-
chiatrist." The speech by Natasha highlights the suffering of
not being in accordance with the hegemonic and hierarchi-
cally valued discursive possibilities of gender and sexuality
6 SAGE Open
(Butler, 1990, 1993), and it confirms the strong relationship
between transvestism and transsexualism with sexuality in
the Brazilian society. Kulick (1997) has demonstrated this by
finding that Brazilian travestis consider sexuality rather than
gender as the main constitutive element of their identities.
To sort out this contradiction and end psychological suf-
fering, travestis and transsexuals try to adjust their bodies to
their subjective condition, as much as their subjectivity to
their bodies, for, "It's not easy to be a transsexual. You look
in the mirror and wish to be someone else. (You wish) to
have another identity. It's very difficult" (Pamela), because
when we find out we are travestis or transsexuals, we lose all our
bonds. We lose our families, friends, we lose everything. You
know, the ones who manage to keep family bonds, in case their
family accepts it, are completely different persons. (Mary)
It is impossible for such individuals not to seek the per-
forming of their bodies, due to the fact that "it is not an
option, but a condition, you know what I mean? Being a trav-
esti is not easy, you must fight against many things, you
know?" (Kate).
The suffering regarding their bodies declared by Pamela,
Mary, and Kate highlights the connection between body and
subjectivity. For these individuals, their subjectivity can only
be realized through their bodies. Moreover, their bodies are
active in the process of subjectivity construction (Adelman
& Ruggi, 2008; Perucchi et al., 2014; Thanem, 2011),
because both transsexuals and travestis perceive as a form of
violence to look in the mirror and see someone else: "One
day you look at yourself in the mirror and think: `I can't go
on like this, I'm not that person who's standing in front of the
mirror, that's not me'" (Patty). Also, they can go on perceiv-
ing themselves as "horrible" (Catherine). However, there is a
crucial difference between travestis and transsexuals, as far
as body-changing processes are concerned. Transsexuals aim
to completely follow the social models that define the bodies
of men and women according to the heterosexual matrix of
gender, which include undergoing changes in their genitals,
to become either a man or a woman. However, travestis do
not want their bodies to be completely as a woman's, as
explained by Margaret (a transsexual): "I've always wanted
to change sex. I never wanted to be halfway through. In that
case, I would be a travesti." Therefore, transsexuals aim to
adjust their bodies according to the binary intelligibility of
gender, that is, trying to transform their body into a "real"
woman body but not disrupting the hegemonic intelligibility
of gender. On the other side, travestis are seen by transsexu-
als as abject (Adelman & Ruggi, 2008; Thanem, 2003)
exactly because they are not willing to follow such
intelligibility.
With regard to transsexualism, Sally states that
You fight a lot to run away from things, until one day you look
at yourself in the mirror and think: "I can't go on like this, I'm
not this person who's standing in front of the mirror, that's not
me."
Therefore, the body already manifests performances early
in life, leading such individuals to a possibility of subjective
existence that is closer to a given body performance. This
makes them wish and seek to adjust themselves to the discur-
sive possibilities of a woman or a man. Among transsexuals,
during the process of transformation (Linstead & Pullen,
2006), the body is objectified and pointed out by respondents
as something to be modeled and labeled in accordance with
the social constructions and power relations that define the
body of a woman. Transsexuals are completely tied to the
binary gender model (Butler, 1990), and they seek to trans-
form their bodies according to one of two possible binary
definitions of gender (a male or a female), as if those were
the only existing possibilities. They want their bodies to
entirely follow such model, not challenging or questioning
the binary and excluding definition of gender. Indeed, as we
have seen, the bodies of travestis are seen as monstrous bod-
ies (Thanem, 2003), precisely because they stand at the bor-
ders between what is socially regarded as the body of a man
or a woman. Travestis do not remove their original sexual
organ, and thus, they jeopardize and put to test the binary
matrix of gender, which is so sacred to transsexuals (Namaste,
2006).
From the interviews, it can be seen that in the process of
becoming, transsexuals consider the mind (subjectivity) to
be at the foreground, for they seek to find and complete their
subjective existence through the modification of their bodies.
However, the boundaries between mind and body are not
clear, because the respondents aim to restructure their bodies
in accordance with their self-image, and the very self in
accordance with the body image, conversely (Dale & Burrell,
2000). Unlike transsexuals, who point out sex changing
operation as the most important aspect to achieve subjectiv-
ity, travestis show that the maintenance of the male sexual
organ denotes certain distinction. In this sense, the option of
removing the genitalia would establish norms to their bodies
and would hence transform them into women. So would this
be the same as to fit into what society determines as to be the
sexual duality underlying the concepts of a man or a woman.
With regard to this aspect, Patty emphasizes,
I'm more into being different and valuing this, because if I get
operated, I'll be normalizing myself, I'll be willing to be
(normal). I'll be normalizing what is different about me, right?
And all in all, there are millions of vaginas in the world, but just
a few people like me.
An aspect that must be highlighted is that the main occu-
pation of many travestis is prostitution, and the distinct fea-
ture of being a "woman with a penis" attracts more clients.
For Patty, the idea of being different is to not adapt her
body into the intelligible, heterosexual matrix of gender
De Souza and Carrieri 7
(Butler, 1990, 1993). According to such logic, fixing oneself
is to become "normal," through the normalization of the
body according to discursive norms. However, in the view of
transsexuals, when travestis break with the norms of gender
intelligibility, they appear to be something incomplete, a fail-
ure, or maybe an ontological impossibility (Butler, 1990).
For travestis, such rupture is an opportunity to go beyond the
limits of regulatory intelligibility. The travesti bodies call
into question the binary gender logic, undoing gender (Butler,
2004; Connell, 2010). This happens because their embodi-
ment retains at the same time characteristics perceived as
belonging to women (breasts and big gluteus) and to men
(the penis; Namaste, 2006). For this reason, the binary intel-
ligibility of gender is not capable to reflect the entire com-
plexity and fluidity of the embodied gender experience
(Linstead & Pullen, 2006; Thanem & Wallenberg, in press).
Only the demonstration of the processes of embodiment
that operate on the bodies of transsexuals and travestis can
reveal the relations between body and subjectivity, because
the body constitutes the self and is also restructured by it,
conversely (Dale & Burrell, 2000). What we seek to high-
light in the processes of subjectification is the embodiment
as an active element in the constitution of the respondents'
subjectivity (Ball, 2005; Brewis & Sinclair, 2000; Dale,
2001; Letiche, 2000). This process of the body as a creator of
the self also becomes evident in the speech by Natasha: "This
discovery was everything but simple, because in fact we are
already born like a `trans,' we're already born with a little
different mind." In that sense, Natasha's body has manifested
itself as something different from other participants' bodies,
from a very early time. Thus, although as a child Natasha still
was not aware of other discursive possibilities that broke
with the hegemonic models of gender and sexuality, the body
reveals and expresses this difference by acting directly as a
catalyst in the search of other possibilities of subjective exis-
tence. This occurs in spite of these possibilities being discur-
sively finite and limited (Brewis et al., 1997; Butler, 1993):
Individuals have either to be a travesti or a transsexual.
According to what has been previously mentioned by Kate,
this search "is not an option but a condition."
Furthermore, as already analyzed, such individuals attempt
to adjust their bodies within the subjective possibilities of a
given discourse (Brewis et al., 1997; Butler, 1993). At the
same time, as these also act by classifying and restraining the
participant, they create in the same individuals a feeling of
dissatisfaction regarding their own bodies. This happens
because such bodies do not fit perfectly within any of these
possibilities, making respondents seek the transformation of
their bodies and subjectivities. Without such adjustments, the
body would carry on causing huge subjective suffering.
Body and Labor
The Travestis stated that their families did not accept their
body and sexual condition, and they ended up kicked out
from their households when they were still young. In the case
of those coming from poor backgrounds with poor educa-
tion, they were led to prostitution to survive (Cortez et al.,
2011; Perucchi et al., 2014; Thanem, 2011). When asked
about formal jobs, the respondents said it is virtually impos-
sible for a travesti to be hired by a company as an employee.
They state, "I've always looked for a job, I've always tried to
find work, with a social security card and all. It's a monu-
mental task, you see?" (Catherine), or that "I didn't try other
options, and it's certainly very hard for transgender individu-
als to get into the work market these days" (Kate). The
speeches by Catherine and Kate also reaffirm the speeches
by Adele, Agatha, and Alexis: "That's when the question of
work market comes up, they do not give us opportunity and
we are discriminated right away. When you get there to hand
in your CV, people won't even accept it, you know?" (Adele);
"Gosh, it's a big challenge, way too big indeed" (Agatha);
"There is no labor market for travestis, the doors are closed.
And the alternative are the streets" (Alexis).
It is a fact that Brazilian travestis often undergo corporal
insertion of silicone to accomplish the desired changes on
their bodies (i.e., having big breasts and a big gluteus), but,
at the same time, they also maintain certain male characteris-
tics. This makes their condition of travestis completely visi-
ble to other people. Therefore, because they are a more
multifaceted cultural gender identity than transsexuals, trav-
estis acquire more visibility, which consequently makes
them easy targets for social stigmatization (Creed & Cooper,
2008). The main consequence of stigmatization is that it is
almost impossible for a travesti to be hired by organizations
in the Brazilian labor market, due to the transphobia present
in this country's society (Thanem, 2011). The speeches of the
travestis interviewed in this article have clearly shown the
discrimination involved in the obtaining of formal employ-
ment, because of their bodies. Moreover, the fact that they
have been outcast home very early for their families, com-
bined with discrimination faced by the performing of a body
that disrupts the boundaries of the binary model of gender,
the only option left for them is to work as prostitutes or set up
small ventures. Beyond that, the majority of travestis came
from poor backgrounds, and the lack of financial and emo-
tional support from their families (Adelman & Ruggi, 2008;
Cortez et al., 2011) aligned to low education (Cortez et al.,
2011) eventually led them into prostitution.
The entry into the formal work market is perceived by this
group as evidence of social recognition, or a way to ensure a
possible citizenship status for the interviewed participants.
However, if the formal market closes its doors, of course, the
informal market (prostitution) still remains a possibility for
such individuals. The speech by Alisson exemplifies and
reveals one of the few alternatives available for this group to
survive--prostitution.
So, it's like this, they don't even give us a chance, so the option
that remains is prostitution. There isn't any other, you either
work as a prostitute or you die of hunger, misery, and everything.
So I had to be a prostitute to survive, you know? (Alisson)
8 SAGE Open
However, this is not a new phenomenon, and work as
prostitute is survivor strategy that has been used for many
decades, as Amber asserts,
I started working as prostitute in the 70s. I was 11 the first time.
I went through all these decades and faced the dictatorship,
faced the end of the dictatorship, faced AIDS, faced all that. I
still face prejudice today . . . .
However, that is no easy task. Travestis who carry on
working activities as prostitutes must face violence, STDs
(Sexually Transmitted Diseases), and social insecurity in
their daily routines (Antunes & Mercadante, 2013; Cortez et
al., 2011; Perucchi et al., 2014). Natasha states, "Everybody
who lives the transgender life, exposed on a corner to make a
living, whatever happens to one them can happen to you as
well." Anna and Catherine agree with Natasha as they
reiterate,
We already suffer so much discrimination from society, at night
for example, we take the risk of exposing ourselves, you get in
the car of someone you don't know, you don't even know if
you're coming back (Anna), because "if you don't make money
you won't eat, you won't drink, you won't live and you also
have to draw your goals, we have to make a living. Out there we
don't know what we'll have to go through, what's going to
happen." (Catherine)
From the speeches, it becomes evident that working as a
prostitute is not their choice or first option, nor is it a typical
or an easy job, first, because this is often the only option for
survival for this group, and second, because it is not a for-
mally recognized function by society. It exposes the partici-
pants to the risk of being shot or even being hit by a stone.
The violence involved in prostitution is part of the everyday
life of travestis. Moreover, Brazilian travestis who work in
prostitution suffer violence more frequently than other sort
of sex workers (Cortez et al., 2011) and are more susceptible
to being infected by the HIV (Operario, Soma, & Underhill,
2008).
However, poverty and low educational levels are not the
only causes that lead travestis to prostitution. As already
mentioned, the corporal changes made in their bodies disrupt
the heterosexual matrix logic and makes them an abject
body. This affects their work and contributes to increase in
aggregated transphobia. Yet, working as a prostitute also pro-
vides more opportunities to travestis to perform their gender
differently from the norms of intelligibility (Brewis &
Linstead, 2000; Tyler, 2012). This can be confirmed by Betty
discourse. Betty affirms that at "15 or 16 I was hired with
formal, legal and regular work contract . . ., but at that time I
was only gay." Betty complements that after the use of hor-
mones to change her body, "the only job I had as travesti was
in the sex market. As a prostitute . . .." Then, as "only gay,"
Betty managed to get a regular job, and it was exactly the
body changes to become a travesti that caused exclusion
from the formal labor market. As Beverly asserts, "the
travestis are very intelligent, they are very capable, you
know? They are not animals, they aren't monsters. We are
labeled as illiterate as a John Doe." Beyond that, the fact that
most of them work as prostitute increases the stigmatization
of travestis, regarding them as physically, socially, and mor-
ally dirty in the Brazilian society (Tyler, 2012). This makes
their labor activity abject as well (Tyler, 2012), due to their
allegedly abject bodies.
The other possibility for travestis is to work as hairdress-
ers. Some respondents managed to set up small beauty par-
lors to survive, because the formal work in companies is still
inaccessible for travestis. Carmen affirms that "[hairdress-
ing] is a field that accepts homosexuals and travestis easily
. . .." The hairdresser shops work as a place of refuge for
travestis and also work as a support community among them.
Nevertheless, only the hairdresser shops owned or managed
by another travestis or homosexuals hire travestis.
Hairdresser shops that do not fit in this characteristic usually
fire them when managers/owners discover that the hair-
dresser hired is not a "real" woman:
You get there and hand in your CV [with a female name]. You go
through a test and are hired. . . . So people hired me thinking that
I was a woman. When they asked to bring in my documentation
to finish the hiring process . . . they would dismiss me, I was
always dismissed.
This speech highlights the importance of a long-standing
demand of transgender people in Brazil: the institutional use
of their social name as a dispositive to avoid exclusion and
discrimination not only at work but also in all social relations
(Perucchi et al., 2014).
Anyway, the vast majority of travestis respondents are
forced to work as prostitutes on the streets, without any
social protection. The bodies of travestis do not allow their
gender and sexuality to go unnoticed. Moreover, by putting
into question the boundaries of the binary model of gender,
travestis end up becoming the major targets of discrimina-
tion during processes of recruitment by companies.
Therefore, due to the fact that travestis break with the idea of
normality and direct correlation among sex, gender, and sex-
uality (Butler, 1990), they come across tremendous difficul-
ties for being hired by companies as employees (Thanem,
2011).
As for transsexuals, the search for work seemed to yield
possibilities other than prostitution. The speeches also show
difficulty in getting jobs, but there are also moments that
seem to reveal a change in society. Carol discussed the dif-
ficulties faced by transsexuals in finding a job in the private
sector: "In the old days I used to send my CV with my birth
certificate name, and then when I got there, I was a com-
pletely different person. People were shocked; it was a sur-
prise for them." Again, the importance of the social name for
transgender people is declared by the transsexual Eve
(Perucchi et al., 2014). Eve makes clear that "I was afraid to
transform myself during college and be expelled or become
De Souza and Carrieri 9
unable to graduate." However, after graduating from college,
Eve succeeded in a public service examination and was
employed as a public servant. Afterward, she underwent
definitive sex change operation.
While trying to avoid or reduce discrimination at work,
many transsexuals seek to change their name of birth
(Perucchi et al., 2014). Changing their names to names that
follow the heteronormativity involving sex­gender­sexual-
ity (Butler, 1990) allows them to conceal their transsexuality,
hence making their transsexual condition invisible to society.
Some public departments in Brazil already allow transsexu-
als to use their "social name" expressing their gender identi-
fication rather than their name of birth. On this matter,
Pamela declares that in the São Paulo City Hall, "in health
and educational departments, all transsexuals and cross-
dressers must be called by their social name . . .." However,
there is no federal law that establishes this right to all public
departments in Brazil territory, and its adoption or not
depends exclusively on the desire of the local governors.
Because of that, many transsexuals seek to change their birth
names by filing a suit in court. However, in addition to high
costs that limit the access of economically underprivileged
transsexuals, there is no guarantee that they will achieve suc-
cess in this endeavor. As Carol asserts, "The lawyer said
judges are so conservative, and I'd be lucky if my trial
doesn't go to Supreme Court."
Most of the transsexuals interviewed have received good
tuition and do not come from such poor backgrounds. These
conditions have allowed them to search for a public employ-
ment, to avoid the strong discrimination they would face in
the private sector. It is worth clarifying that in Brazil, public
employment is achieved through a selective process called
public recruitment examination. This test involves specific
knowledge related to the position that the candidate shall
hold, that is, a public servant position is not obtained through
a personal interview or an indication, but by means of a
selective process in which a candidate competes against
thousands of other applicants for a single vacancy. Once a
candidate is approved in a public examination, he or she is
assigned to the position and can no longer be dismissed,
under the attributions of the law. Therefore, the selective pro-
cess for the Brazilian public service is highly impersonal,
and candidates are not physically known. This factor allows
the invisibility of the body and ensures economic stability for
the successful candidates. In public service examination,
individuals are just a number in a list, and in case they suc-
ceed, the Constitution assures that they occupy the position.
On this aspect, Felicia states, "Working in the private sector
is very bad, but in the public sector we still have a chance.
You know, in the public examination we're just numbers."
Many transsexuals who participated in the interviews
work in the public educational system as teachers in primary
schools. As mentioned before, this occurs because often
transsexuals have a better educational level compared with
travestis. For instance, Georgina declares to "have accom-
plished the complete curriculum to become a teacher. First I
took the basic courses to be a teacher, then I graduated in
English and Pedagogy and today I have a career in the public
education sector." Beyond that, the process of changing their
bodies usually starts later in their lives as compared with
travestis, which allows them to conclude their professional
formation not as transsexuals. They get into the process to
change their gender when they already have professional sta-
bility in the public sector, as Alison affirms: "There was a
whole context I . . . was 37 years old when I became Beatrice
. . .." It can be concluded from the speeches that the trans-
sexuals interviewed achieved some level of financial and
professional stability when they began their corporal
changes. The fact they found economic stability prior to
making corporal changes has made things much easier for
transsexuals. They constructed their career by not showing
any disruption in the body and gender relation and by follow-
ing the gender norms of intelligibility (Butler, 1990, 1993),
as a way to avoid discrimination at work (Thanem, 2011;
Thanem & Wallenberg, in press). Just after they have accom-
plished economic stability, they underwent corporal changes.
Besides working as public servants and in the field of edu-
cation, similarly to some travestis, many transsexuals have
sought to set up their own business as dressmakers, mani-
cures, or hairdressers. For instance, Hazel started working at
age 12 as "a manicure, a hairdresser, and a dressmaker.
Women stuff. After all this was my identity. When I had the
operation, then I built up the courage and set up my own
beauty parlor." Holly sees herself as capable of doing various
tasks: "I never had a job. I mean, I was a hairdresser. I'm like
a jack-of-all-trades! I'm a hairdresser, I can sew, I cook very
well, I sell takeaway food, you know?"
Nonetheless, this does not free transsexuals from discrim-
ination at the workplace (Thanem, 2011). Hope emphasizes
discrimination suffered while working as a monitor for a pro-
fessor in college: "Many students found it strange, especially
men, you know. They thought, `wow, she's a travesti, she's
my monitor, I don't want to work with her" (Hope). Jane
states that discrimination against transsexuals at work is fre-
quent: "When I worked in a company, jokes were frequent,
this and that, but I tried not to pay attention, ignore them, just
leave it behind, because people didn't know what they were
talking about, they didn't know anything." Joanna states that
the other employees believe "they can do harm because they
are gays, travestis or transsexuals." As it can be observed,
Kelly states that discrimination occurs not only when people
have already been hired to work for companies but often dur-
ing the process of selection and recruitment:
I was called to an internship at a soda company, but they did not
accept me. They explained that since I was going to work only
with men and travel with them to various points of sales, this
would be an uncomfortable situation for them.
Even transsexuals working in public jobs show evidence
of discrimination at work. Some reported to face problems to
be promoted (Thanem, 2011), which is a manifestation of
10 SAGE Open
lack of professional recognition. Joanna makes clear that
sexual recognition comes before the occupational, trans-
forming non-promotions into a means for labor discrimina-
tion. Also, according to Joanna,
If you look closely you will see that the public sector is full of
transsexuals. You know why? Because we're just a number and
there is an entrance exam. We're anonymous. And if we pass the
examination process, people must accept us. Of course, we still
have to suffer later on. In my case, I was never promoted.
Conclusion
It is concluded that not only gender and sexuality operate at
the personal, interpersonal, and institutional levels (Tauches,
2006) but also the body operates at those three levels. At the
personal level, societies establish what is considered the
"normal" body for a person, categorized into a particular
gender and sexual practice, which, consequently, constructs
and establishes processes of body objectification. At the
interpersonal level, the bodies of travestis and transsexuals
interfere in their relations with their families and other mem-
bers of society. In fact, they can be marginalized by organi-
zational managers as a result of their bodies, and such
marginalization is manifested in the difficulty to obtain a
formal job, particularly in the case of travestis. Finally, at the
institutional level, the body is organized in a consistent hier-
archy in which the bodies that best fit the binary gender
model are also the most valued.
The body is always in the middle of an intense interaction
with subjectivity, namely, the human mind. Subjectivity
shapes bodies and is, at the same time, shaped by them.
Therefore, there is no division between the mind and the
body. Besides, the body is not marked and passive, but
instead, it is active in the subjective constitution of travestis
and transsexuals. The body influences the possibilities of
subjective existence in the scope of labor. Travestis face
huge difficulty to take formal positions in companies, for
they are discriminated because of their bodies, which, in
turn, lead them to prostitution. Transsexuals also face this
difficulty, but because their bodies are more suited to the
binary model of gender, they manage to take up formal jobs
in companies. In other words, it means that, because gender
issues cause so much trouble to them than transsexuals, the
life of travestis becomes less livable (Thanem & Wallenberg,
in press) than the life of transsexuals.
In this sense, to invert this scenario, it is necessary to
improve the use of social names by transgender individuals,
to protect them from discrimination at the workplace and
also to provide them with a wider range of formal job oppor-
tunities, especially in the private sector. Travestis do not
want to be sexual workers, but the policy of exclusion oper-
ated by companies leads them to prostitution. Prostitution is
not a choice; it becomes in many cases the only alternative
for survival. Added to that, travestis have skills and capabili-
ties to accomplish many tasks at the workplace.
As for transsexuals, in spite of having more job opportu-
nities than travestis, they are also discriminated at the work-
place. Therefore, to avoid discrimination, affirmative action
rights need to be extended to travestis and transsexuals, and
the use of social name needs to be warranted by a federal law
that regulates and establishes the use of such names in all
public and private companies. Moreover, the discrimination
of transsexuals and travestis needs to be criminalized in the
Brazilian law, into a humanitarian offense.
As a suggestion for future research, it would be interest-
ing to analyze the processes of subjectivity on and through
the body from the standpoint of female employees and orga-
nizational managers in general. The understanding on how
these processes constitute realities and establish power rela-
tions and forms of subjective existence has still received
little research attention in the field of organizational
studies.
