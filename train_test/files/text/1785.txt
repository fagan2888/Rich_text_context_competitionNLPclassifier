AND HILLARD WEINSTOCK, MD, MPH
Objective: To describe the epidemiology of genital Chlamydia tra-
chomatis infections among men in the United States.
Study Design: Data from the notifiable disease case surveillance
system, the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES), the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
(AddHealth), the National Job Training Program, the Men Having Sex
with Men (MSM) Prevalence Monitoring Project, and adult and juvenile
corrections facilities were used to summarize national chlamydia case and
prevalence rates. Data were stratified by age and race/ethnicity.
Results: In 2005, 232,781 chlamydia cases among men were re-
ported, corresponding to a rate of 161.1 cases per 100,000 men, an
increase of 43.5% compared with the case rate in 2001 (112.3). Pop-
ulation-based chlamydia prevalence rates from NHANES (1999­2002)
were highest among men aged 20 to 29 years (3.2%); men aged 18 to
26 years participating in AddHealth (2001­2002) had a 3.7% preva-
lence rate. Rates were highest among black men in both NHANES
(5.3%) and AddHealth (11.1%). The prevalence rate among men (aged
16­24 years) participating in the National Job Training Program was
8.1%. Among MSM, the 2005 median urethral chlamydia prevalence
rate was 6%. Overall, chlamydia rates were highest in adult correc-
tions facilities; the 2005 positivity rate among men aged 21 to 25 years
was 7.8%. In juvenile corrections facilities, the 2005 positivity rate
among men aged 15 to 17 years was 6.7%.
Conclusions: Rates of genital C. trachomatis infections among men
are persistently high, particularly among men entering the National
Job Training Program and men in corrections facilities. The burden of
disease is generally highest among young men and black men.
CHLAMYDIA IS THE MOST COMMONLY reported notifiable
disease in the United States among both women and men.1 Pre-
vention efforts have focused primarily on prompt identification of
Chlamydia trachomatis infections among women and subsequent
timely, appropriate treatment. Given the high disease burden
among young women, national recommendations encouraging an-
nual screening of all sexually active young women under the age
of 26 years have been in place since 1993.1,2­4 These screening
guidelines have led to a wealth of data on the epidemiology of
chlamydia among women; the general population chlamydia prev-
alence among young women aged 14 to 19 years is 4.9%, whereas
rates in excess of 19% are found among young women (aged 20
years) in adult correctional facilities.1,5 However, the epidemiol-
ogy of chlamydia among men in the United States has not been
characterized thoroughly.
Increasingly, the importance of understanding and addressing
chlamydia infections among men is being recognized.6 The role of
identifying and treating male infections in preventing adverse
outcomes among women, such as pelvic inflammatory disease,
ectopic pregnancy, and infertility, has prompted some researchers
to call for chlamydia screening guidelines directed at detecting
male infections.6 Untreated chlamydia infections may rarely have
direct adverse outcomes among men, including epididymitis and
proctitis.7 Currently, males are opportunistically tested for chla-
mydia; no recommendations for screening males for chlamydia
exist.
Although several existing studies have examined chlamydia
infections in men, these studies are typically geographically lim-
ited (restricted to one or several urban locales), targeted to a certain
portion of the population, such as military recruits, or were con-
ducted a number of years ago.8­13 Using data from existing sources,
we sought to characterize and summarize genital C. trachomatis
infections among men in the United States, both in the general
population and in specific subpopulations.
Materials and Methods
We reviewed published data from national sources on chla-
mydia infection among men in the United States, including data
from national surveys and programs. We also conducted a PubMed
search using the terms "United States," "chlamydia," "epidemiol-
ogy," and "men" to identify articles published from 2002 to 2007.
To be included in this summary, data provided on male chlamydia
infections must have included multiple regions of the United States
(not limited to a single geographic area or select metropolitan
areas) and have been stratified at least by age.
Data identified for use in this summary include national chlamydia
morbidity data and prevalence data from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health (AddHealth), the National Job Training
Program, the Men Having Sex with Men (MSM) Prevalence Moni-
toring Project, and juvenile and adult corrections facilities. Data and
literature sources are briefly described as follows.
Case Reporting
Chlamydia morbidity data are reported weekly by state health
departments to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
The findings and conclusions in this report have not been formally
disseminated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and should
not be construed to represent any agency determination or policy.

(CDC) through the National Electronic Telecommunications Sys-
tem for Surveillance. Chlamydia was added to the nationally
notifiable disease list in 1995; since 2000, all 50 states have
reported chlamydia cases to CDC. Cases are diagnosed based on
the current chlamydia case definition,14 but test technologies used
vary across reporting areas. Data are not deduplicated; therefore, a
single individual may contribute more than 1 case per year, if
multiple diagnoses are made. Morbidity data are reported in an
annual summary produced by CDC using both absolute case
counts and case rates per 100,000 population, stratified on demo-
graphic factors such as sex, age, and race/ethnicity.1,15­18 Age
groups, in years, are standardized as follows: 10 to 14, 15 to 19, 20
to 24, 25 to 29, 30 to 34, 35 to 39, 40 to 44, 45 to 54, 55 to 64, and
greater than 64. Race/ethnicity groups included in the annual
summary are non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, Hispanic,
Asian/Pacific Islander, and American Indian/Alaska Native.
Prevalence
General Population. NHANES is a cross-sectional survey that
provided data on demographics, sexual behavior, and chlamydia
prevalence of the general US household population through inter-
views and the collection of urine specimens. From 1999 to 2002,
specimens were tested for chlamydia using a ligase chain reaction
assay (LCx, Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL). The NHANES
sampling plan is a stratified, multistage, probability cluster design
that selected a sample representative of the US civilian noninsti-
tutionalized population. Eighty-three percent of persons aged 14 to
39 years who were invited to participate in NHANES in 1999­
2002 completed the interview; 92% of those interviewed had
chlamydia results. The resulting1999­2002 sample included 6632
participants aged 14 to 39 years.5
A prospective cohort study, AddHealth tracked a school-based
probability sample of 18,924 adolescents to adulthood (Wave I).
Wave III follow-up data were collected from April 2001 to May
2002. Sixty-six percent of the original Wave I cohort provided
urine specimens, approximately half of them were men. Men
ranged from 18 to 26 years.19 Urine specimens were tested by
ligase chain reaction assay to identify the presence of C. tracho-
matis. Prevalence rates were calculated while taking into account
the AddHealth sampling methodology.
Specific Populations. Male chlamydia positivity data are col-
lected from participating juvenile corrections facilities and adult
corrections facilities and reported annually.1,15­18 Data are ob-
tained through CDC's Corrections Prevalence Monitoring Project
and the national Infertility Prevention Program. Chlamydia is
diagnosed based on the detection of C. trachomatis using locally
selected laboratory tests, including both nucleic acid amplification
tests (NAATs) and non-NAATs. Males were voluntarily screened
upon entry into the correctional facility. Data consist of test results
that are not linked to individuals; a single individual could have
multiple tests during the course of a year. Therefore, positivity
rates (not prevalence rates) are calculated using the total number of
positive chlamydia tests as the numerator and the total number of
positive and negative chlamydia tests as the denominator. Positiv-
ity rates have been found to accurately approximate prevalence
rates in monitoring chlamydia rates in these populations.20 In
addition to annual reports, a more detailed analysis was recently
conducted using 2005 data.21
Men entering into the National Job Training Program, a program
for socioeconomically disadvantaged youth aged 16 to 24 years,
were routinely screened for chlamydia from July 2003 to Decem-
ber 2004; data were subsequently analyzed.22 Chlamydia cases were
identified via the use of a strand displacement assay (BDProbeTec
ET, Becton-Dickinson, Sparks, MD) performed using a urine spec-
imen collected during the entrance examination. Chlamydia
screening has continued since December 2004, and limited Na-
tional Job Training Program data from 2005 are also available.1
The final data included in our review are from the MSM Prev-
alence Monitoring Project, a surveillance project consisting of data
collected from MSM of all ages attending STD clinics located in
9 US cities. Based on either a urethral swab or urine specimen,
chlamydia diagnoses are made according to local case definitions
and locally available test technologies,1 which vary by site. Posi-
tivity rates are reported, calculated using the same methodology as
data from corrections facilities, described earlier.
Data are reported as presented in the original publication; if
available, supporting statistics, confidence intervals (CI), ranges,
and odds ratios (OR) are included.
Results
Case Reporting
In 2005, 232,781 chlamydia cases among men were reported in
the United States, corresponding to a case rate of 161.1 cases per
100,000 men, an increase of 43.5% compared with the 2001 case
rate of 112.3 cases per 100,000 men.1
Increases in reported cases among men occurred across all
age and racial/ethnic groups consistently from 2001 to 2005
(Figs. 1, 2).1,15­18 The highest age-specific case rate in 2005 was
evident among men aged 20 to 24 years, at 804.7 cases per 100,000
men, representing 37% of all reported cases (86,931 of 233,553).
Among racial/ethnic groups, non-Hispanic black men had the
highest case rates. In 2005, the case rate per 100,000 black men (all
ages) was 717.8, more than 11 times higher than that of non-
Hispanic white men (63.6 per 100,000) and more than 3 times
higher than the rate among Hispanic men (201.4 per 100,000).
Cases among non-Hispanic black men accounted for more than
50% of all reported cases (111,513 of 217,066). In 2005, the
highest case rate across race/ethnic groups and age groups was
observed among non-Hispanic black men aged 20 to 24 years
(2965.5 cases per 100,000 men). This was an increase of 29%
since 2001 (2304.4 cases per 100,000).
Prevalence
General Population. Data from 2 sources, NHANES and
AddHealth, yielded national prevalence estimates from samples of

the US general population (Table 1). Based on the NHANES data
collected from 1999 to 2002, the overall chlamydia prevalence rate
among 3096 males aged 14 to 39 years was 2.0% (95% CI
1.6%­2.5%).5 The prevalence rate was highest among males aged
20 to 29 years at 3.2% (CI 2.4%­4.3%), higher than both the
prevalence rate among younger males aged 14 to 19 years (2.3%,
CI 1.5%­3.5%) and among older males aged 30 to 39 years (0.7%,
CI 0.3%­1.5%). Targeting a more restricted age group than
NHANES, AddHealth showed a 3.7% chlamydia prevalence rate
among young men aged 18 to 26 years (CI 2.9%­4.6%).19
Prevalence rates by racial/ethnic group were also available from
both NHANES and AddHealth (Table 2). Prevalence rates were
highest among non-Hispanic black men in both studies. In NHANES,
the 5.3% (CI 3.8%­7.5%) chlamydia prevalence rate among non-
Hispanic black men was higher than among non-Hispanic white men
(1.5%, CI 0.9%­2.4%) and Hispanic men (3.1%, CI 1.9%­5.0%).5
Differences among racial/ethnic groups were more pronounced in
young men participating in AddHealth. The prevalence rate among
non-Hispanic black men (11.1%, CI 8.5%­14.4%) was 8 times higher
than the rate among non-Hispanic white men (1.4%, CI 0.9%­
2.0%).19 The rate among Hispanic men (7.2%, CI 4.9%­10.5%) was
5 times higher than that of non-Hispanic white men.
Specific Populations. Chlamydia positivity rates among men
entering corrections facilities were consistently higher than prev-
alence estimates for the general US population as identified in
NHANES and AddHealth. Among young men (aged 12­20 years)
entering juvenile corrections facilities in 2005, the median facility-
specific chlamydia positivity rate was 6.0% (85 facilities).21 The
median rate was highest among men aged 18 to 20, at 8.7%, and
the median rate among 15- to 17-year-old men was 6.7%. Among
young men aged 18 to 20 years entering adult facilities, the
median positivity rate was 8.8% (11 facilities). The median
positivity decreased slightly to 7.8% among men aged 21 to 25
years and to 3.5% among men aged 26 to 30 years, continuing
to decrease as age increased. Overall, among men entering adult
corrections facilities (all ages), the median facility-specific
chlamydia positivity rate was 4.6% (11 facilities). Over time,
positivity rates in both juvenile and adult corrections facilities
have consistently remained high. Median facility-specific rates
were greater than 5% in both types of facilities from 2001 to
2005.1,15­18
Two additional sources, the National Job Training Program and
the MSM Prevalence Monitoring Project, provided data on more
specific groups of men than those described in the earlier data.
Among socioeconomically disadvantaged young men (aged 16­24
years) entering into the National Job Training Program, the median
state-specific chlamydia prevalence rates have been uniformly
high over time.1,15­18,22 In 2005, the median state-specific rate was
reported as 8.1% (range 0.0%­14.8%).1 A subset of data from the
National Job Training Program, from July 2003 to December
2004, was further analyzed. When split into 2 age groups, both
groups reflected high prevalence rates (ages 16­19 years: 8.0%;
ages 20­24 years: 8.8%).22 Similar to NHANES and AddHealth,
prevalence rates in this subset were over 4-fold higher among
black men (13.0%) compared with white men (3.1%; adjusted OR
4.1; 95% CI 3.7­4.6); the rate among Hispanic men (5.7%) was
also significantly higher than that of white men (adjusted OR 2.0;
95% CI 1.7­2.3).
Data from the MSM Prevalence Monitoring Project showed a
median city-specific urethral positivity rate in 2005 of 6% (9 cities,
range 5%­8%).1 Unlike the previous data sources, chlamydia
positivity did not vary substantially between racial and ethnic
groups. In 2005, the rate among black MSM attending STD clinics
was 7.0%, whereas the positivity rate among both white and
Hispanic MSM was 6.0%.
Discussion
Our summary reveals that the prevalence of chlamydial infec-
tion among men is substantial, especially in younger age groups,
racial/ethnic minorities, and the incarcerated population.

CHLAMYDIA TRACHOMATIS INFECTIONS AMONG MEN
Across data sources, the burden of chlamydia infection is gen-
erally greatest among young men aged approximately 20 to 24
years. This differs from the epidemiology of chlamydia among
women; the greatest burden among women occurs in a younger
age group, those 15 to 19 years of age.1 The age difference may be
due to partnership characteristics, suggesting that young women's
sexual partners are often slightly older men, as has been noted in
previous studies examining sexual mixing patterns.23 In addition,
adolescent females may have a higher biologic susceptibility to
acquiring chlamydia than do adolescent males, because of cervical
ectopy. Overall, the efficiency of C. trachomatis transmission
during heterosexual vaginal sex may be greater from men to
women than from women to men.24
With the exception of the MSM population, chlamydia infec-
tions were disproportionately found in black men compared with
white and Hispanic men and in Hispanic men when compared
directly with white men. These disparities were also observed in
studies of other STDs, such as gonorrhea and syphilis.1,15­18,25
Racial/ethnic disparities also exist for HIV infections; increasingly
high HIV rates among black men have recently been highlighted.26
Disparities in chlamydia prevalence among women exhibit similar
patterns and are highest among black women.1,15­18 Interestingly,
there are smaller differences between positivity rates by race/
ethnicity among MSM. This has also been observed in studies of
other STDs.1
Chlamydia infection is highly prevalent in men entering correc-
tions facilities, and among men entering the National Job Training
Program. Corrections data show that the burden of infection is
highest among men aged 18 to 20 years, both in juvenile and adult
facilities. However, rates are substantial among men aged 15 to 25
years (range 6.7%­8.8%), suggesting that this high-risk popula-
tion may be reasonable to target for screening efforts. Other local
corrections data also demonstrate a high burden of disease among
young men.27
Case report data from 2001 to 2005 show steady increases in
chlamydia case rates per 100,000 men. The increases may be at
least partially explained by increasing usage of NAATs,28 which
are more sensitive than prior test technologies29 and thus may
identify more cases. In addition, the increasingly widespread avail-
ability of noninvasive testing by means of collecting urine speci-
mens has likely led to more men agreeing to chlamydia tests.30
Finally, case report data are subject to local and state reporting
practices; although all states have reported chlamydia cases to
CDC since 2000, reporting practices, rates, and completeness vary.
Although there are possible explanations as to the increase in
chlamydia case rates among men, a true increase in infection rates
cannot be ruled out.
Improvements in test technology and the availability of NAATs
for use on urine specimens have led to increased opportunities to
more easily test men for chlamydia. With test technology enhance-
ments, more programs are considering creating guidelines and
implementing chlamydia screening among men. Some programs
have moved forward with this initiative, but locally defined screen-
ing criteria, as well as the screening practices and coverage, vary
substantially (Steven Shapiro, CDC, personal communication).
Another means to improve the detection and treatment of chla-
mydia in men is to improve partner referral practices for women
with chlamydia.
The data used in our study have several limitations. First, the
case report surveillance system is dependent on provider and
laboratory reports, and underreporting may be significant. Al-
though widespread reporting requirements were adopted in every
state by 2000, actual reporting implementation dates and practices
vary by area. Because of the asymptomatic nature of chlamydial
infections, underdetection is also a likely cause of underestimation
of cases. Second, the prevalence data we present are dependent on
the test technology used. Increasingly sensitive tests are better able
to detect any evidence of infection, resulting in fewer false nega-
tives and more positives; changes in test technology have been
associated with increases in test positivity.31 Third, because of the
lack of commercially available test technologies (beyond culture)
that are Food and Drug Administration-approved to test rectal
specimens, rectal chlamydia infections were not often ascertained.
Despite the limitations, the data used in our summary demon-
strate consistent results across a variety of populations. Large
sample sizes represent different populations, multiple regions of
the country, and varying socioeconomic and risk groups. Two of
our data sources, NHANES and AddHealth, are nationally repre-
sentative surveys of the US population at large.
In summary, our review provides important information on the
epidemiology of chlamydia among men in the United States.
Although generally lower than disease rates among women, prev-
alence rates among men are consistently substantial. The burden of
chlamydia among men is most significant in a slightly older age
group20­24 than women.15­19 Similar to women, infection rates are
higher among black men. Data presented in this analysis support
routine chlamydia screening of young men in corrections settings,
particularly adult corrections facilities, and continued screening of
men entering the National Job Training Program. Further research
on the impact and cost-effectiveness of additional strategies to
detect chlamydia in men should be pursued.
