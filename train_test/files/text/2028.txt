The quality and monetary value of diets consumed by adults in the
United States1­3
Colin D Rehm, Pablo Monsivais, and Adam Drewnowski
ABSTRACT
Background: Food prices are an established determinant of food
choice and may affect diet quality. Research on diet cost and diet
quality in representative populations has been hindered by lack of
data.
Objective: We sought to explore the distribution of diet cost and
diet quality among strata of the US population and to examine the
association between the 2 variables.
Design: In this cross-sectional study, monetary costs of diets con-
sumed by participants in the 2001­2002 NHANES were estimated
with the use of a national food price database. Healthy Eating Index
(HEI)­2005 values were estimated with the use of the population
ratio method for the calculation of average scores. Mean daily diet
costs, energy-adjusted diet costs, and HEI-2005 scores were esti-
mated for subpopulations of interest. Associations between energy-
adjusted diet cost, HEI-2005 scores, and HEI-2005 component
scores were evaluated.
Results: Higher energy-adjusted diet costs were significantly associ-
ated with being older and non-Hispanic white, having a higher in-
come and education, and living in a food-secure household. Higher
diet costs were also associated with higher HEI-2005 scores for both
men and women. Women in the highest quintile of diet costs had
a mean HEI-2005 score of 69.6 compared with 52.5 for women in the
lowest-cost quintile. Higher diet cost was strongly associated with
consuming more servings of fruit and vegetables and fewer calories
from solid fat, alcoholic beverages, and added sugars.
Conclusion: Given the observed association between diet cost and
diet quality, helping consumers select affordable yet nutritious diets
ought to be a priority for researchers and health professionals.

INTRODUCTION
Food choices and eating habits are driven by concerns about
nutrition and health, as well as by food economics (1). The higher
cost per calorie of some recommended healthful foods, such as
fruit and vegetables, may restrict their use by people with limited
resources (2­6). Research on the relation between food prices and
diet quality can help explain the observed social disparities in
nutritional status across socioeconomic strata (7). Although di-
etary surveillance in the United States at the individual level has
not accounted for food prices historically, a national food price
database has now become available (8).
Based on individual nutrient intakes, dietary energy density,
fruit and vegetable consumption, or adherence to a healthful diet
overall, studies in Europe and Japan have linked higher diet costs
with higher-quality diets (9­15). In other observational studies,
a higher diet cost was positively associated with biomarkers of
nutrient intake and was negatively associated with BMI (11, 14,
16). In 2 US-based studies, persons with higher energy-adjusted
diet costs consumed fewer calories and had higher intakes of
vitamin C, potassium, and fiber (17, 18). This relation between
diet quality indicators and diet cost was more pronounced for
women than for men (17). Recent analyses of the Nurses' Health
Study data showed a positive association between the alternative
HEI4 score and energy-adjusted diet cost, and, notably, that not
all components of a healthy diet were cost sensitive (19).
As noted in a recent USDA report (20), analyses of diet quality in
relation to diet cost in the United States have been hampered by
a lack of appropriate data. On one hand, dietary intake and health
databases, all at the individual level, have lacked information on the
monetary cost of the foods consumed. On the other hand, databases
on food expenditures and the economics of food purchase behavior
typically provide food-purchasing data at the household or higher
levels of aggregation, rather than at the individual level. Moreover,
such data sets provide no details on actual food consumption or
health at the individual level.
In the present study, individual-level diet costs for 4744 par-
ticipants in the nationally representative 2001­2002 NHANES
survey were calculated by attachment of the national food price
database to dietary intake data. This linkage allowed for a de-
scriptive characterization of the relation between diet cost and diet
quality across socioeconomic strata, all at the individual level.

grams and a description of each individual food and beverage
consumed, based on an 8-digit USDA food code. All recalls
identified as reliable by NHANES staff and that met the minimum
criteria for completeness were included in this study. The ex-
amination protocol, data collection methods, and factors used to
evaluate the reliability and quality of each 24-h recall are
documented elsewhere (21). Individuals who completed a reli-
able 24-h recall were included in the present study (n = 4744 of
5027 adults aged 20 y).
Data from the demographic and food-security questionnaires
were also used in the present analyses. Primary stratification
variables from the demographic questionnaire were age group
(20­29 y, 30­44 y, 45­64 y, 65­74 y, or 75 y), sex, race-
ethnicity (Mexican American/other Hispanic, non-Hispanic
white, and non-Hispanic black), family income-to-poverty ratio
(,2, 2­3.99, or 4), and educational attainment (,high school,
high school graduate/equivalent, some college, or college grad-
uate). The Mexican American and "other Hispanic" groups were
combined because of small numbers in the "other Hispanic"
group. Individuals who indicated that they belonged to another
race group or multiracial group were included in all analyses,
but their cost and diet quality estimates were not presented
because this group was heterogeneous and the point estimates
were highly variable because of the small sample size. Family
income-to-poverty ratio adjusts for the number of adults and
children in each family. Analyses of educational attainment
were limited to adults aged 25 y, because most adults have
completed their education by this age. Household food security
was assessed by an 18-item Food Security Survey Module. In-
dividuals were dichotomized as either fully food secure or not
fully food secure (with or without hunger).
Food price database
The CNPP price database, released in May 2008, provided the
cost per 1 g edible portion of all foods and beverages reported in
NHANES dietary recalls, with the exclusion of alcoholic bev-
erages and water (8). The prices were based on retail prices paid
by members of the Nielsen Homescan Consumer Panel during
the same period of 2001­2002 NHANES data collection and
reflected the average prices paid by households across the United
States. In creating the database CNPP made the assumption that
all foods and beverages were obtained from stores. Accordingly,
the database did not permit estimations of actual food expen-
ditures. Rather, merging of the CNPP database with the NHANES
provided estimates of the monetary value of foods consumed,
which can be used in the assessment of the "economic acces-
sibility" of a healthy diet.
Full documentation of how the food price database was created
is available from the CNPP (8). In brief, all foods reported in the
diet recall were translated into a purchasable form. Mixed dishes
that were prepared from a recipe were decomposed into ingre-
dients in purchasable form. For example, a portion of vegetable
lasagna reported in NHANES was broken down into 17 separate
ingredients, which included 3 types of fresh cheese; canned
tomato paste; raw spinach; and cooked, enriched macaroni. Each
food had to be in purchasable form and was adjusted for prep-
aration and cooking losses and gains. In some cases, mixed dishes
were deemed to be in ready-to-eat or ready-to-heat form, which
means that no ingredients were analyzed because the dish could
be obtained either from a deli section or refrigeration case. Next,
the list of all foods and beverages in purchasable form was
matched to price data for the foods and beverages reported in the
Nielsen panel. Finally, prices were computed per gram edible
portion based on the average purchase price. The prices for
a small number of foods and beverages (n = 32) were missing or
were identified as potentially extreme within-group outliers and
were substituted with prices for comparable foods (eg, the price
per gram of grape nuts was 3 times higher than that of similar
cereals, or prices for some berries such as loganberries and
mulberries were missing). This substitution was done by the
authors.
Additional data from the CPI Average Price Data Series were
used to estimate the prices of alcoholic beverages (22) that were
not available from the CNPP. Prices were available for beer, wine,
whisky and vodka for 2001­2002. Prices in the CPI may be
systematically different from those in the CNPP database, be-
cause the CPI database is used for retail price monitoring, not to
reflect consumer expenditures. In light of this, we first compared
the prices of select foods with known prices from the CNPP
database with the prices from the same year's CPI, to evaluate the
degree by which the CNPP database may under- or overestimate
the prices compared with the CPI database. The comparison
foods were fresh celery, ground coffee, and white bread. These
items were selected based on the availability of price estimates
for multiple years in the CPI, the high frequency of consumption
of these foods in NHANES, and the variability of food groups
represented. We showed that prices per edible portion were
10.4% lower in the CNPP database compared with the CPI data,
so the CPI alcohol prices were downwardly adjusted by this
amount to account for this systematic difference. The final step
was to attach these adjusted prices to the CNPP database, in-
cluding the creation of recipes for mixed drinks with the use of
common drink recipes. For example, the estimated price per 1 g
of vodka tonic was 0.33 · price of vodka/g + 0.67 · price of
tonic/g multiplied by the portion in grams consumed.
Deriving monetary value
The monetary value of the diet was computed from each
individual's dietary recall in combination with the price database
by multiplication of the price per gram by the portion of each food
consumed by the respondent, and then the summing of these
values for each participant. Diet cost was estimated for all foods
and beverages, including alcohol. Tap and bottled water were
excluded from the monetary cost estimation.
Because the monetary value of the diet was highly correlated
with the total quantity of food and energy consumed (r = 0.72 for
grams and r = 0.78 for kilocalories), the energy-adjusted diet
cost was computed and expressed per 2000 kcal with the use of
the residual method of energy adjustment (23). The distributions
of both energy and diet cost were positively skewed, so energy
and cost were log transformed and back transformed into natural
units to ensure that the energy-adjusted diet cost variable was
uncorrelated with energy. The energy-adjusted cost variable is
more meaningful when comparisons are made between sub-
populations that may have different energy requirements or in-
takes. The energy-adjusted diet cost variable was grouped into
quintiles for all analyses.

The HEI-2005
The HEI-2005 was the primary outcome variable. As docu-
mented elsewhere (24, 25), the HEI-2005 measure of overall diet
quality was based on consumption of 2 nutrients (sodium and
saturated fat) and 9 food/beverage groups (total fruit, whole fruit,
total vegetables, dark green and orange vegetables, milk, total
grains, whole grains, meat and beans, and oils) and a measure of
empty calories (SoFAAS). Each HEI-2005 component score can
contribute 5 points (eg, total fruit or total grains), 10 points (eg,
meat and beans, or energy from saturated fat), or 20 points
(SoFAAS). Higher HEI-2005 scores indicate better diet quality;
the maximal possible score is 100. The overall HEI-2005 score
and each subscore are calculated on a per-calorie basis and
are therefore adjusted for energy. For saturated fat, sodium, and
energy from SoFAAS, higher HEI subscores reflected lower
intakes. For the remaining 9 HEI-2005 food groups to encourage,
higher subscores reflected higher intakes.
Analytic approach
Age-adjusted diet costs and energy-adjusted diet costs by
independent variables of interest were estimated by the fitting of
survey-weighted linear regression models with diet cost as the
outcome, and the independent variable of interest (eg, race-
ethnicity or income-to-poverty ratio) and age group as covariates.
The predicted marginal for each level or category was estimated
to determine the mean diet cost for each category or level of the
independent variable. These values represented the mean at the
average age distribution for the population of interest. A com-
parable approach was used to estimate the age-adjusted mean
HEI-2005 scores by demographic and sociodemographic varia-
bles of interest. This approach is described in more detail below.
Because a single 24-h dietary recall does not sufficiently
capture usual dietary intakes, which are ultimately the target of
dietary recommendations and guidance, we used the score of the
population ratio method recommended by Freedman et al (26) in
analyses of HEI-2005 scores and subscores. This method has
been shown to best reflect group-level dietary patterns when only
a single 24-h recall is available. The method adapted for use here
is described in detail elsewhere (27). A survey-weighted linear
regression model was first separately fit for total energy and each
subscore (eg, total fruit consumption) that included the in-
dependent variable of interest (eg, quintiles of energy-adjusted
diet cost) and covariates (eg, age group). The predicted marginals
were then estimated for each level of the categorical independent
variable. With the use of the formula for each component and the
covariate-adjusted calorie estimate, the HEI-2005 subscores were
then estimated. This step was repeated for each independent
variable of interest. Each subscore was truncated at the specified
score (5, 10, or 20), and the total HEI-2005 score was the sum of
the truncated subscores. The SEs of the adjusted HEI-2005 and
the subscores were estimated with the use of a stratified jackknife
variance estimator, which was the approach described by Korn
and Graubard (28) and used by Breslow et al (27). The SEs and
subsequent hypothesis tests based on this method were notably
more conservative than the Taylor-series linearization SE esti-
mates with survey data. However, the reduction in bias of an
HEI-2005 score that reflected actual intake greatly outweighed
the loss of statistical precision. For hypothesis testing for unordered
categorical predictors, a survey-weighted Wald test was used. For
ordered categorical variables, a linear trend test was used. P
values ,0.05 were considered statistically significant. When
a significant trend or association was observed, pairwise tests
were conducted with the use of a survey-weighted Wald test.
Analyses of the association between energy-adjusted diet cost
and HEI-2005 used the same approach, with adjustment for age
group, sex, and race-ethnicity. Effect modification by sex was
expected, based on previous reports, and a multiplicative in-
teraction term was significant (P , 0.01 in a model with ad-
justment for age group and race-ethnicity) (18). An exploratory
analysis evaluated the association between diet cost and the
HEI-2005 subscores, with adjustment for age group and race-
ethnicity. The adjusted means for each subscore by energy-
adjusted diet cost quintile were estimated for men and women
separately with the use of the same score of population means
approach described above for each subscore. The HEI-2005 was
calculated with the use of SAS software (version 9.1; SAS In-
stitute) and statistical analyses with the use of Stata software
(version 11.0; StataCorp).
RESULTS
Diet cost and HEI-2005 by sociodemographic strata
Diet costs and HEI-2005 scores by demographic strata are
provided in Table 1. The age-adjusted mean diet cost was $4.81
and the energy-adjusted diet cost was $4.44 per 2000 calories.
The average HEI-2005 score was 58.5. Both diet costs per 2000
calories and the HEI generally increased with age. Women had
higher HEI-2005 scores than did men.
Differences in diet cost and the HEI were also observed by race-
ethnicity. The age-adjusted mean diet cost for non-Hispanic white
adults was greater than among Hispanic and non-Hispanic black
adults. There was some indication that Hispanic respondents had
higher HEI-2005 scores than did non-Hispanic whites, but the
difference was not statistically significant.
Lower family income-to-poverty ratio and educational at-
tainment were associated with lower diet cost and lower HEI-
2005 scores. Living in a food-secure household was associated
with higher energy-adjusted diet cost and higher HEI when
compared with individuals who lived in a household with any
degree of food insecurity.
Modeling the relation between diet cost and HEI-2005
For men and women combined, and for both sexes separately,
there was a significant and positive association between higher
diet cost and higher HEI-2005 score (Table 2). Persons in the
highest-diet-cost quintile had HEI-2005 scores that were 13
points higher than those with the lowest-cost diets. As expected,
the association was stronger among women, as shown by the
large difference in the values between quintiles of diet cost.
HEI-2005 scores for men and women in the highest quintile of
diet cost were, respectively, 9.7 and 17.1 points higher than for
persons in the lowest quintile. Additional adjustment for edu-
cational attainment and income-to-poverty ratio did not alter the
observed association between energy-adjusted diet cost and HEI
(data not shown). Secondary analyses with the use of a ratio of
cost per 2000 calories [(diet cost/calories consumed) · 2000]

were conducted and yielded nearly identical results (results
available from authors).
Modeling the relation between diet cost and HEI-2005
component scores
Higher-cost diets were associated with a significantly higher
consumption of fruit and vegetables per 1000 calories, as shown
in Table 3. The trend was apparent for both sexes but was
stronger for women. Among men, only the highest-diet-cost
quintile failed to earn the maximal HEI-2005 subscore for total
grains. Among men, a weak negative association was observed
for diet cost and the subscore for milk, whereas a nonsignificant
positive association was observed for women. For neither sex
did we observe a trend between diet cost and HEI-2005 sub-
scores for whole grains. Higher-cost diets contained less satu-
rated fat and less energy from SoFAAS as a percentage of total
calories. The negative relation between diet cost and SoFAAS
was markedly stronger among women. Higher-cost diets con-
sumed by women included more meat and beans than did lower-
cost diets. Of dietary components to limit, only consumption of
sodium increased with more costly diets.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first report to characterize dif-
ferences in diet cost by sociodemographic groups with the use of
individual-level data from a nationally representative sample of
the US population. A significant association between diet cost
and HEI-2005 score was observed for the entire US population
and for men alone, and it was especially strong for women. This
association held after adjustment for additional sociodemo-
graphic factors (income and educational attainment). The dif-
ference in HEI-2005 scores between women in the highest- and

lowest-diet-cost quintiles was greater than the difference between
younger and older adults, which suggests that the observed
differences are not only statistically significant, but also mean-
ingful within a broader public health context. Within the United
States, diet costs varied by population subgroups as characterized
by race-ethnicity, education, and income. Non-Hispanic whites
had higher diet costs than did non-Hispanic blacks and Mexican
American/other Hispanics. However, despite lower diet costs,
there was some suggestion that Hispanics had higher HEI-2005
scores than did non-Hispanic whites. We also identified some
groups that consumed lower-cost, yet higher-quality diets; these
groups included older adults, women, and Mexican Americans/
other Hispanics (see Table 1). Studies of the relation between
diet quality and diet cost at different levels of income and educa-
tional attainment can add to our understanding of the mechanisms
behind the observed disparities in nutrition and health.
Recent dietary guidelines have emphasized an increase in the
consumption of fruit, vegetables, low-fat dairy products, and
whole grains, whereas energy from solid fat and added sugars is
reduced (29, 30). An examination of each component score of the
HEI-2005 separately in relation to diet cost showed that some
component scores were associated with higher diet costs, whereas
other component scores were not. Higher consumption of total
vegetables, dark-green/orange vegetables and legumes, and whole
fruit among both men and women was associated with higher
costs. By contrast, total grains, whole grains, and milk and milk
products were largely cost neutral. Food pattern modeling studies
are required to determine whether the implementation of the 2010
Dietary Guidelines on a population basis would entail an addi-
tional diet cost.
It is important to emphasize that the present analyses were
based on the intrinsic monetary value of the diet and not on actual
food expenditures. For example, the present estimate of mean diet
cost for a NHANES participant was $4.81/d. By contrast, the
2002 CEX estimated individual expenditure on food and alco-
holic beverages to be $6.30/d, based on yearly purchases (31).

Several factors may account for this 31% difference. First, the
estimates based on NHANES data included only foods actually
consumed, whereas CEX data were based on expenditures for all
foods purchased but not necessarily consumed. Second, the as-
sumption made by the USDA in creating the CNPP food price
database was that all foods were purchased in retail settings and
prepared at home. Whereas foods and beverages consumed in
restaurants and other eating establishments are included in the
current estimates, the CNPP food price database does not account
for the added cost for service and preparation (8). In contrast, the
CEX did include all food expenditures from retail stores and
restaurants. Although the approach used here did not permit
estimations of food expenditures, it provided estimates of the
monetary value of the foods consumed. The latter measure might
be useful in future research to evaluate the affordability of a
healthy diet with current eating patterns.
The substitution of prices from restaurants and other food
service establishments with store-bought foods for prices in the
CNPP database represents one of the limitations of this study.
Evidence from the CEX suggests that the purchase of away-from-
home foods accounts for a greater proportion of food spending for
individuals who live in more affluent households, which suggests
that the differences by socioeconomic status observed here are
likely to be even more profound. Another limitation is that the
food price database was computed from prices paid by a national
panel that lacked geographic specificity, which do not represent
the prices actually paid by respondents in the sample. Variation
may occur at the regional level (ie, differences in prices between
the northeast and southwest regions of the United States) or local
level (ie, difference in food prices between types or location of
retailers within a city or region) (32). For these reasons, the
observed differences of diet cost between sociodemographic
subgroups were most likely conservative, especially if more
affluent individuals were more likely to purchase foods from
more expensive grocery stores or purchase more costly versions of
a nutritionally comparable food (eg, organic free-range chicken
compared with nonorganic chicken).
Moreover, the diet costs reported here are based on the 24-h
recall dietary assessment, which can underestimate portion sizes
or fail to include foods and beverages that are either forgotten or
consumed infrequently, yet these limitations are inherent in all
dietary assessment methods (8, 23). Together, these factors
produce a downward bias on the diet cost estimate and contribute
to the difference between the estimates observed here and the US
consumer food expenditures in the CEX survey. In addition,
because only a single 24-h recall was used to estimate diet cost,
the distribution observed here is wider than would be observed
if multiple recalls were available (23). The data used here are
the only data for individual diet cost, diet quality, and health
measures in a nationally representative sample.
However, the results of the present analyses, based on 24-h
recalls and retail food prices, are consistent with past results. In
past studies, dietary intake data obtained from food-frequency
questionnaires (13, 14, 17­20), diet history questionnaires (11,
12, 33), food diaries/records (15, 34), and 24-h recalls (10) and
were merged with local or national food store prices, as was done
in this study. To our knowledge, no study has measured actual
food expenditures at the individual level in relation to diet quality
and health. The strengths and weaknesses of dietary intake data
have been well documented (23). Many of the same issues relate
to the estimation of diet cost (ie, error from misestimation of
portion size or omitted foods or in the nutrient or price database
may result in error in the diet cost estimate). Despite the diverse
assessment methods and diet quality measures, the results of
investigations into the association between cost and diet quality
have been consistent.
In this study we observed an association between diet quality
and diet cost: higher-cost diets tended to be higher in quality. The
association between diet cost and diet quality observed here may
be one mechanism that contributes to diet-related health dis-
parities (35). Identification of features of low-cost yet nutritious
diets is an urgent priority, given that under current consumption
patterns, more-costly diets were associated with higher diet
quality. Previous work has shown that eggs, beans, whole grains,
citrus fruit, potatoes, and carrots were among affordable yet
nutrient-rich foods (2, 20).
The goal of this observational study was to describe the as-
sociation between diet quality and costs in the diets consumed by
US adults. Whether high-quality diets would still be associated
with higher diet costs if population eating habits were to change is
a different question, best addressed by diet optimization mod-
eling (36). Modeling studies, based on linear programming, can
take nutritional and consumption data and cost constraints into
account to create food-intake patterns that are nutritionally im-
proved but cost neutral (37). One important avenue of research is
the identification of individuals and groups that consume lower-
cost yet higher-quality diets. In this study, these groups included
older adults, women, and Mexican Americans/other Hispanics.
Further examination of the diets of these groups is warranted and
may help inform policies and guidance to promote food patterns
that are both healthful and affordable. The combination of
NHANES and the CNPP food price database remains a practical
resource, useful in the evaluation of diet cost and diet quality in
the US population.
