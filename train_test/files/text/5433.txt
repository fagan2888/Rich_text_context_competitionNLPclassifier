Introduction
One subject matter that has enjoyed extensive academic dis-
course since the dawn of civilization is disaster. For example,
Hanner (2012) has published extensive literature on disasters
such as the breakup of the "Challenger" in 1986, the sinking
of the Titanic in 1912, the destruction of the Hindenburg as it
tried to land in Lakehurst in 1937, the Bhopal Chemical
disaster in India in 1984, and the 1944 fire disaster that killed
169 people and destroyed the Ringling Brothers and Barnum
and Bailey circus. There are other natural disasters such as
earthquakes, storms, floods, famines, and diseases
(International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent
Societies [IFRC], 2001; Pelling, 2010; Wisner, Blaikie,
Cannon, & Davies, 2004) that have also equally disrupted
the smooth functioning of society. Beyond these natural
disasters, other human-initiated disasters--wars, invasions,
massacres, riots, and terrorism (Archer & Somsook, 2011;
UN-HABITAT, 2008)--have had a devastating toll on
humanity. What is important here is that these disasters con-
note negative feelings and images. Their effects do not only
manifest in the number of lives and property lost but also the
vital livelihood support systems are perpetually ruined. What
is more, the basic infrastructure necessary to respond to the
disasters is severely damaged or destroyed. As opined by
Amanda Ripley (Time, Inc., 2012), "learning from these
disasters means taking a deep breath, long after the satellite
trucks have gone home--and reflecting on what we can do
better" (p. 1).
In the past few decades, Ghana has experienced memo-
rable disasters (both natural and man-made) with disastrous
consequences: They include the earthquake in James Town
and its environs in 1939, which recorded 17 fatalities (see
Amponsah, 2004); the 1983 drought that battered Ghana's
economy (Institute of Statistical, Social and Economic
Research [ISSER], 2010); the 2010 floods in Accra and
Swedru, which 42 people lost their lives; the collapse of a
six-story Melcom Shopping Centre in Accra that trapped 82
people and caused 14 deaths; the 2014 cholera outbreak that
affected more than 22,000 people and claimed more than 200
lives in 5 months (May-September 2014; Ghana Health
Service [GHS], 2014); and the June 2015 flood and fire
disaster, which claimed more than 158 lives are stark

The Central Medical Store Fire Disaster:
A Test for Institutional Compliance in
Disaster Prevention in Ghana
Ebenezer Owusu-Sekyere1, Robert Yakubu Adjuik1,
and Emmanuel Wedam1
Abstract
Although Ghana has developed institutional frameworks and has enacted legislations which among other things seek to
guarantee the cooperation and coordination of key stakeholders in disaster prevention, compliance is still a mirage. This has
resulted in increased susceptibility of national assets to preventable disasters. This article discusses what might have caused
the inferno that razed down one of West Africa's largest medical storage facilities--the Central Medical Store (CMS). The
disaster did not only manifest in property lost, basic medical supplies to neighboring countries were also severely interrupted.
By exploring the responses of key stakeholders, the emerging evidence indicates that preventive measures that could have
potentially averted the disaster or reduced its impact were not in place. The results further highlighted the apparent weak
institutional arrangements toward disaster risk prevention, preparedness, and mitigation, viewed as cross-cutting themes in
disaster management. The article argues that the scale of losses from this catastrophe epitomizes how the neglect for building
risk reduction can consign an entire region to the mercy of disaster events.

reminders that disasters can leave an indelible mark on
human development (Songsore et al., 2009).
Irrespective of the sources of vulnerability in the Central
Medical Store (CMS) fire disaster, one question remains
unresolved: What might have caused the fire that destroyed
such a sensitive facility which not only have national secu-
rity implications but was also the center of health delivery to
millions across the West African subregion? Answering this
question is important because, to date, the cause of the disas-
ter has not been established leaving room for and encourag-
ing occasional sensational castigation by the media,
politicians, and disaster management experts and organiza-
tions who discuss the issue in a unidirectional manner. The
objective of this article is to interrogate the range of factors
that might have led to the inferno that gutted the CMS, one
of West Africa's largest medical storage facilities. The disas-
ter did not only manifest in property lost, basic medical sup-
plies to neighboring countries were also severely interrupted.
The study is divided into six sections. The introductory sec-
tion is followed by a brief literature on disasters. The third
section is devoted to the methodology employed in the data
collection and analysis. The next section presents the results,
and it is followed by the discussions of the empirical results
of the study. The final section of the article presents the sum-
mary and conclusion of the study.
Understanding Disasters: A Literature
Review
The occurrence of disasters (both natural and anthropogenic)
and its implications on development in particular have
received increasing attention from academics and policy
makers in the past two decades, as demonstrated by the wealth
of literature (see, for example, Beall & Fox, 2009; Cretney,
2014; Parnell, Simon, & Vogel, 2007; Pelling, 2003a;
UN-HABITAT, 2010). As noted by Pantuliano, Metcalfe,
Haysom, and Davey (2012), the increasing interest in disaster
research is related to the recognition of surging urbanization
in crisis-affected countries, the prevalence of natural disasters
in urban areas, and the difficulties confronting humanitarian
actors in responding to such situations. "Interest has also been
spurred, however, by greater understanding of several inter-
related factors that are exacerbating acute and chronic vulner-
abilities in such contexts, including climate change and
long-term underdevelopment" (Pantuliano, Buchanan-Smith,
Metcalfe, Pavanello, & Martin, 2010, p. 1).
Beatley (1989) observes that until recently, scholars in the
past perceived disasters to be one-off, unpredictable and nat-
ural events. For example, Fritz defined disasters as events
that are concentrated in time and space, in which a society, or
a relatively self-sufficient subdivision of a society, under-
goes severe danger and incurs such losses to its members and
physical appurtenances that the social structure is disrupted
and the fulfillment of all or some of the essential functions of
the society is prevented (Fritz, 1961; Picou & Martin, 2006;
Pyles, 2007). This understanding means that the future was
virtually treated as independent of the present and perhaps a
situation which relegates the two most important concepts in
disaster management, "Disaster Resilience" and "Disaster
Risk Reduction" (DRR), to the background. Resilience
which was first used by Holling (on the ability of environ-
mental systems to absorb impact and reorganize to regain
full functionality; Holling, 1973) is used in disaster field as a
way of understanding the ability of a system to avoid damage
as a result of natural hazard impact. DRR, on the contrary, is
defined by the United Nations International Strategy for
Disaster Reduction (UNISDR) as
the concept and practice of reducing disaster risks through
systematic efforts to analyze and manage the causal factors of
disasters, including through reduced exposure to hazards,
lessened vulnerability of people and property, wise management
of land and the environment and improved preparedness for
adverse events. (van Manen, 2014, p. 70)
Consequently, disaster management, which is intended to
include building resilience to risk and preventing disasters
from occurring (DRR) so that it offers a collective safety net
that has the ability to protect the general society from the
devastating consequences that may arise from disasters
when they occur and that may eventually affect national
developments, was envisioned to be a postdisaster activity
focusing mainly on rescue, relief, and rehabilitation with
emphasis on state-centric approaches (Cohen, 2004). In line
with this old thinking, governments were conscientiously
infested with this erroneous idea and started creating
national disaster management systems, usually of a civil
politically tainted nature, to fulfill this mandate (Quarantelli,
1993). In Ghana, for example, the National Disaster
Management Organization (NADMO) was established in
1996 to manage disasters and emergencies (Oteng-Ababio,
2013). This was after the country had responded to the UN
Declaration, General Assembly Declaration (GAD) 44/236,
of 1989 declaring 1990 to 1999 as the International Decade
for Natural Disaster Reduction (IDNDR). As these interven-
tions tend to be response-orientated (reactive), authorities
ended up spending substantially more in responding to
emergencies than on measures that would have helped antic-
ipate and manage risk (World Bank, 2010).
However, in recent times, literature on disasters have
focused more on resilience and risk reduction following the
launch of the UNISDR and the adoption of the Making Cities
Resilient Campaign (Cassidy & Blackburn, 2014), which
began in 2010 and runs concurrently with the Hyogo
Framework of Action (UNISDR, 2011), which seeks atten-
tion to DRR. The Making Cities Resilient Campaign aims at
promoting building resilience in cities from several perspec-
tives such as raising awareness of DRR among both national
and local governments through high-profile events; providing
tools, technical assistance, and training to local authorities;
Owusu-Sekyere et al. 3
and facilitating city-to-city support networks and learning
opportunities (Cassidy & Blackburn, 2014).
The focus of disasters has therefore moved toward consid-
eration of the situation created by such events rather than sim-
ply of the origin, nature, size, and speed of onset and other
physical attributes of the hazard or event. Undertaking risk
assessment as part of a routine comprehensive development
process has received much attention especially after some
pioneering studies by natural scientists (Intergovernmental
Panel on Climate Change [IPCC], 2011; UNISDR, 2011).
The World Bank also created a multi-hazard Urban Disaster
Risk Index (UDRI) as a tool for baseline risk mapping.
Furthermore, the IPCC (2011) has also called for a mix of
incremental and transformational changes to reduce the risk
from climate extremes. Emerging studies (Gaillard, Liamzon,
& Villanueva, 2007; Hilhorst & Bankoff, 2008; Holloway &
Roomoney, 2008) consistently demonstrate that the causes of
most disasters are embedded in human social, economic, and
environmental practices. In other words, the raison d'être of
most disasters today have been traced to be the outcome of
cumulative risk processes rooted in patterns of human behav-
ior, manifesting in poor land-use practices, ill-conceived
development projects, and lack of rules and guidelines. The
cornerstone of the Resilient City Campaign, the Hyogo
Framework for Action, and the Sendai Framework for
Disaster Risk Reduction (United Nations's post-2015 policy
on disasters) is the need to have an institutional basis for
implementing risk reduction and the need to involve all sec-
tors and stakeholders. The three frameworks suggest that
instead of creating a new sector, expanding the mandate of
existing bodies beyond emergency preparedness and response
to a coordinating role, bringing together the various functions
and expertise of existing government departments to focus on
hazard risks can be a priority. This is where many govern-
ments in developing countries including Ghana are faltering.
Method
The CMS
The CMS, which is the largest repository of medical supplies
in Ghana and serves other West African nations, is located at
Tema, the industrial hub and Port city of Ghana and 17 km
away from the national capital, Accra. The CMS distributes
drugs to all the regional medical stores in supply chain that
reaches over 216 districts in Ghana alone. The strategic loca-
tion of the facility makes it accessible to both locally manu-
factured and imported pharmaceutical products from all over
the world. The facility caught fire on Tuesday, January 13,
2015. The inferno razed to the ground, the entire warehouse
destroying equipment and drugs including those for malaria,
HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and Ebola, among others. The fire
which started at about 9:45 a.m. was intense and proved dif-
ficult to fight due to the fact that the mix of items stored in
the warehouse kept exploding. Second, the fire outbreak
coincided with the strong "harmattan winds" (a dry rarefied
North East Trade Winds), which also fanned the flames and
kept changing the direction of the fire, a situation which
hampered efforts at dousing out the fire.
Last, the noticeably lack of water supply in the fire
hydrant on the premises also hindered efforts of the firefight-
ers who had to rely on members of the Tema Water Tankers
Association (private water suppliers) who carted volumes of
water from a nearby hydrant to replenish firefighting vehi-
cles. It took firefighters nearly 30 hr (a day and more) to
bring the inferno under control.
Data Collection and Analysis
The fieldwork was conducted in two stages: The first set of
data collection was conducted 2 weeks after the incidence
has occurred. This was the time memories of the incidence
were fresh in the minds of many a Ghanaian and was the time
stakeholders were prepared to give untainted information on
the perceived causes, officials' complicities, respond strate-
gies, and the way forward. Again, it was the time when hard
core empirical evidence (exhibits) was available. Twenty in-
depth interviews were conducted at this level. The interview-
ees were made up of nine workers from the CMS, five
National Fire Service officials, four eyewitnesses, and two
policemen.
The second set of interviews was conducted 6 months
after the incident and involves semistructured interviews
with 10 experts and key stakeholders engaged in DRR at the
national, regional, and metropolitan levels. They included
two officials from NADMO, two officials from the Ministry
of Health (MOH), two from the GHS, two from the Bureau
of National Investigations (BNI), and two independent disas-
ter management experts. In addition, the research team ana-
lyzed secondary data collected from various sources:
examination of reports from state agencies and civil society
groups, workshop and conference proceedings, and incident
reports. The study also benefited from personal observations
and interactions with organizational participants during the
rescue exercise. Additional data were obtained from verified
transcripts of initial investigative reports and media accounts.
The field study allowed an opportunity to understand the
disaster scene, and the interviews generally explored respon-
dents' responsibilities and level of preparedness and chal-
lenges. In addition, the respondents' perceptions about
Ghana's level of preparedness and possible causal factors of
the incident were explored and analyzed.
Some of the key questions for those who had direct
responsibility for DRR--NADMO, fire service, city authori-
ties, and so on--included their role in the quest for disaster
prevention and how past experiences influence future policy
formulation and interinstitutional relationship. One common
question that ran through all the interviews was, "Do you
think the incident could have been avoided (Why or why
not)?" Depending on the participant, further questions were
4 SAGE Open
asked pertaining to how the quest for a reduction in future
disaster events can be realized? Each interview lasted for
approximately 1 hr, and all were audio recorded, subse-
quently transcribed, and finally thematically coded (Chang-
Seng, 2013; Taylor-Powell & Renner, 2003). The clear
emotional resonances of some of the interviews and the sub-
sequent in-depth empirical analysis of the narratives allowed
the author to gauge how official inaction, negligence, or per-
haps connivance triggered the disaster. Data triangulation
with the datasets provided context for the study and allowed
for a greater point of comparison. For the purposes of confi-
dentiality, most of the quoted materials in the article are
taken from our personal interviews or culled from literature.
Results
The Genesis of the Inferno
In the event of disaster incident, the first thing is to establish
the cause and second to establish whose actions or inactions
might be responsible for the disaster. This is important as it
helps in developing shocks to reduce its impact as a first
response strategy; later, it helps to build appropriate pre-
paredness strategies; and in the long term, prevention capaci-
ties are built. The study revealed that the cause of the inferno
is hard to pin down. This is because different respondents,
depending on their background, gave varied reasons for the
cause of the fire disaster (see Table 1).
At the official level, there was widespread focus on blame
games, firmly directed at shadowy political opponents.
Rather than finding the cause of the disaster, the scene
became the center of intense political activity (see Figure 1).
Blaming political opponents for disasters is common
practice in Ghana and other African countries. This thinking
resonates with the scholarly works of Mileti (1999) and Eiser
and Sutton (2012) when they observed in their study that
seeking insights into the causes of disasters cannot be prop-
erly understood or prevented without attention to the critical
role of human agency and societal processes. As observed by
disaster scholars (see Lewis & Kelman, 2010), such (mis)
conception of the complexities in appreciating, conceptual-
izing, and understanding disaster risks may blight effort to
develop preventive capacities for such disasters.
On the contrary, workers from the CMS believed that the
real cause of the inferno which has been described as "mys-
terious" from the professional point of view was caused by
naked and protected fire outside but near the facility. One of
such workers revealed in an interview,
The fire may have started when we engaging in our routine
burning of some of the expired drugs.
This situation was corroborated by an eyewitness, who
mentioned that he saw some men burning some boxes of
drugs with petrol, and in the process the fire exploded and
got out of hand. He could not, however, confirm whether the

The President of Ghana "This is a national catastrophe, for which someone must answer. If investigations being carried
out reveals it is arson and political sabotage, the perpetrators would be dealt with severely

Civil Society Group "The fire incidence should not be considered as a deliberate act but rather our inability as a
nation to build disaster prevention strategies for such national asserts."
Workers at the facility "The fire may have started while expired drugs were being burnt by some of our colleagues."
Spiritual leader "We are being punished for not telling the truth to our people. How can you [referring to
workers at the CMS] stock the place with expired drugs and distribute them to unsuspecting
Ghanaians, the fire was a way of preventing this unacceptable behavior. The fire was caused
by the ancestral spirits."
Bystanders "We saw some men burning some boxes of drugs with petrol and in the process the

"men" were workers from the CMS or that what they (the
men) were burning were expired drugs. Other workers from
the CMS gave a different account. The workers believed that
there was an unprotected fire in the neighborhoods whose
source was not known. This fire extended to the highly flam-
mable facility. From all indications, the cause of the fire was
not readily known, a situation which also played well into the
hands of the spiritual world. A popular spiritual leader in
Ghana attributed the cause of the inferno to the gods and
agents of the spiritual world (see Table 1).
Fire Safety Standards at the Facility
The Acting Head of Public Relations of the Ghana National
Fire Service (GNFS) confirmed the existence and knowledge
of well-crafted fire safety regulations both for public and pri-
vate properties at the national and local levels such as the
National Building Regulations of 1996. This notwithstand-
ing, available statistics show that authorities managing such
facilities blatantly contravene these statutory regulations.
Besides the fire safety procedures, such sensitive and public
interest property is also required by law to have a well-
secured insurance package. This is part of the resilience
building process so that in case of unexpected catastrophe,
their impact could be minimal.
The study shows that all state assets are to be insured
with the State Insurance Company (SIC) under flexible
terms and that there are also simple processes of acquiring
fire safety requirements. Among the processes is the
approval for planning schemes, and architectural and engi-
neering designs. In addition, installations including fire
safety measures and hydrants and the installation of closed-
circuit television cameras at all sensitive government instal-
lations are to be inspected and certified by the appropriate
agencies before permission for occupancy is granted. Our
results show that these safety requirements had not been fol-
lowed through. The research revealed that the fire hydrant at
the CMS was out of order at the time the incident occurred.
The fire safety certificate for the premises had long expired
and fire extinguishers had no foams that could quench any
preliminary naked fires. In an interview with an NADMO
official, he intimated,
It was obvious this was going to happen, it was so obvious.
He questioned why a facility like the CMS was not well
equipped with the latest technology such as smoke detectors
and automatic sprinklers which could have mitigated the
severity of the damage. Similarly, a BNI official also
observed,
The mere fact that the property belong to the government of
Ghana implies that the principle of shared risk is applied because
all the 25 million people of Ghana have a stake in that property;
why did the government not insure the property on behalf of
Ghanaians, giving the sensitive nature of the facility.
The General Secretary of the Ghana Chamber of
Pharmacy, in an interview, chastised the authorities of the
MOH and the GHS for not learning from the numerous dev-
astating effects of recent fire outbreaks to put in appropriate
policies to forestall future disasters. He intimated that the
recurring disasters including recent fires at public institu-
tions such as the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Economic
and Organized Crime Unit, and the Public Account
Commission should have been a wake-up call for state
institutions to put in the necessary measures including
enforcing the appropriate laws to avert such incidences. He
maintains,
There are several lessons that could have been gleaned from the
events before CMS which were blatantly overlooked. Clearly,
this incident and many of such nature are due to systemic
structural failure, rooted deep in the current poor governance
structure, a situation which could have been averted if those
responsible have enforced fire safety regulations.
The Acting Head of Public Relations of the GNFS again
attributed the poor housekeeping in the warehouse to the
spread of the fire. Flammable cylinders and other combusti-
ble materials were kept together at the warehouse, a situation
which smacks of lack of proper supervision and monitoring.
He stated passionately,
What we are seeing are signs of non-conformity to professional
practice in warehouse keeping. Items are suppose to be kept in
rolls with well demarcated lanes so that in case of any unexpected
situation, it does not easily cause great harm to the other items in
the same warehouse. As it is now, it looks like no one cared
about it.
An opinion leader in Tema who witnessed the incident
described the fire disaster as emblematic of the authorities'
inability to enforce fire safety standards. He specifically
faulted authorities of CMS, who he opined regularly burn
expired drugs close to the warehouse without regard for the
health and safety of the nearby residential properties. He
suggested that the public would stand to benefit if candid
examination of leadership complicities or otherwise at many
levels have been included in past disaster inquiries. He
explained that, typically, such incidents provoke a big fuss
about fire safety standards that ultimately yields no system-
atic reform.
A Test for Institutional Collaboration and
Coordination
The CMS fire also brought to the fore the lack of apparent
institutional collaboration and coordination that exist in the
disaster management circles in Ghana. At the national level,
while the NADMO is mandated by Act 517 of 1996 to coor-
dinate, command, and execute functions in disaster manage-
ment, it is supposed to do so with the collaboration of other
6 SAGE Open
institutions (see Ministry of Local Government and Rural
Development [MLGRD], 1996). In addition, a National
Disaster Risk Reduction Platform for DRR and National
Disaster Management Plan (NDMP) were created in 2005,
for which NADMO is the focal point but with representation
at all levels of government. However, there is a lack of suf-
ficient institutional coordination, training, and funds and
capacity building. Table 2 indicates some of the agencies and
their roles in disaster management in Ghana.
The list of agencies involved in disaster management is
not exhaustive in Table 2. The study showed some basic
problems in the implementation of disaster management
framework among the institutions. The major problems iden-
tified included lack of effective coordination, limited inte-
gration and harmonization of sectoral plans, and limited
funds to effectively implement disaster prevention plans.
The connections between national sector ministries and other
state bodies were not sufficiently developed--such as links
between NADMO, the MLGRD, and the Ministry of Interior
(MOI). Moreover, NADMO receives limited government
support in terms of engaging relevant sector agencies in
disaster management. Although legislation in areas related to
DRR exists, such as the Millennium Development Authority
Act (2006), Administration of Lands Act (1962), and over 26
laws on environmental issues, their coordination and imple-
mentation seem to be a problem.
The extent to which these laws are to be rolled out and
enforced would require the support of all allied institutions;
this was corroborated in an interview with a key informant
(an officer from the National Fire Service). He intimated,
Disaster risk management which is supposed to be a collective
responsibility is still being treated as an individual affair by
NDAMO. This tendency defeats NADMO's mandate of
improving upon its role of coordinating and harnessing all
resources both human and material from all partners for timely
and effective response emergencies. Not tapping the expertise of
the GNFS, Ghana Ambulance Service, and Ghana Police has
resulted in a dispersion of effort and an ineffective use of the
scare resources of the nation. Consequently, the needed political
support for DRR has also gradually waned.
He stressed further that providing tools to enable translat-
ing national policies into mainstreaming planning processes
would help the nation in understanding the options that are
available for managing risks and for planning and implement-
ing local-level DRR strategies. This situation defeats the pur-
pose and implementation of the Hyogo Framework for
Action. The key informant concluded that if the institutional
Table 2. Institutional Responsibilities in Disaster Management in Ghana.
Agency Responsibilities in disaster management
NADMO Draw plans to prevent disasters or mitigate their effects on residents; coordinate activities before and during
emergencies such as registration of victims, relief efforts, operations, ensuring postdisaster rehabilitation;
reconstruction as well as resettlement including mobilization and provision of resources; also to collaborate
with the UNDP, ISDR, and other bilateral and multinational for the implementation of all protocols on disaster
management both locally and internationally.
MLGRD Help NADMO draw plans and regularly update the national-, regional-, and district-level activities on all issues
on disaster management. They are also to ensure effective coordination and implementation of disaster
prevention, mitigation, and preparedness measures at the local levels.
MOI The Ministry of Interior through the respective security agencies such as the National fire Service, the Police
Service, the Military, and so on, set some standards for disaster prevention and also respond to emergency
situations. The MOI through the security agencies provides technical advice for building plans with regard to
machinery and structural layouts to reduce the impact of disasters should they occur. They also offer rescue
and evacuation services to those trapped by fire and other emergencies and undertake any other functions
incidental to the disaster profile of the state.
MEST (EPA) Through EPA, the MEST is the guiding agency responsible for formulating environmental laws and quality
standards for the reduction of disasters that may be environmentally oriented. Mitigating disasters such as
floods, climate change­related disasters, environmental pollution such as poor waste management, and water
pollution, among others, are their responsibility.
MOH Guiding institutions of the health sector have the regulatory authority that includes the provision of emergency
services, including the national ambulance services. They help in the implementation of approved national
policies on disaster management. They also provide effective mechanisms for disease control, surveillance, and
prevention in Ghana. They are in charge of issues pertaining to public and occupational health and hygiene, and
perform other functions relevant to the promotion, protection, and restoration disaster-related health issues
in Ghana.

efforts had been harnessed together in the management of the
CMS, the fire may not have occurred or its effects would have
been minimized. In any case, that is the essence of DRR.
Early Warning Systems and Signs
The study further revealed that early warning systems
(mostly in the form of smoke and fire detection devices, reg-
ular maintenance and inspection of safety procedures) were
not adhered to. The study also revealed that officials whose
duty it was to manage the facility were not abreast with the
combustible nature of the drugs in the stores. The study could
not cite any report on monitoring and assessing disaster risks
preparedness of the facility through the different systems in
place. Risk assessment data, including classification of
chemicals at the facility, were not readily available. In terms
of human capacity, official workers at the facility lacked the
needed disaster preparedness skills to emergency disaster
services, a situation which further aggravates the develop-
ment of any early warning system. Although no lives were
lost, the emotional storylines of some workers at the CMS,
most of whom belong to the lower tier on the institution's
management structure alleged that before the disaster, they
repeatedly alerted top management of the fact that most of
the fire extinguishers had expired and also warned against
the regular burning of expired drugs near the facility but to
no avail. A respondent, for example, angrily shared his expe-
rience in response to a question on what he thinks went
wrong:
It is unbelievable that top managers of this facility who take
huge salaries at the end of the month will not listen to us anytime
we make a report. On several occasions, we reported to the
managers to bring the fire service people to bring new
extinguishers but they will not listen. There were also plans to
train us on how to handle some of the emergency equipments
but this has also not taken place. It looks like they [management]
do not care about the safety of the place; all they think about is
their monthly salaries. But for their [management] greed and
selfishness, they could have averted this calamity. If only they
had listened to our many complaints.
An insurance consultant blamed management of CMS for
negligence. He intimated that it is the government's respon-
sibility to ensure the safety of such national asset. To him,
management, and for that matter government, was guilty for
what had happened. An engineer consultant and former pub-
lic official questioned the structural integrity and quality of
the building and blamed the "red-tapism" for the nonconfor-
mity to fire safety standards. As part of measures to prepare
against future incidences (and develop early warning sys-
tem), he advocated for an "urgent streamlining of physical
planning and building regulations" and the retraining and
improving the capacity of officials responsible for managing
the facility. Contributing, a private safety coordinator stated
emphatically that the CMS disaster could have been avoided
if management had been proactive by going the extra mile to
address the observed deficiencies in the structure.
Counting the Cost of the Disaster
Like the economic effects of many fire disasters in Ghana,
the study revealed that CMS disaster destroyed hundreds of
thousands worth of medicines, equipment, and hospital facil-
ities belonging to Ghana and the World Health Organization.
The study further revealed that medical supplies worth GHS
237 million (US$68 million) were destroyed and that the
country lost 3 months drug reserve and the ability to replen-
ish the lost stock in time is very questionable, meaning lives
are at risk. While the direct cost was not easy to equate, the
indirect cost was very difficult to estimate as our study
revealed that more than 10 highly placed staff connected
with CMS were interdicted. What is clear is that the indirect
cost will take years to manifest and Ghana will over the years
go on paying for the impact of this fire incident. From all
indications, the CMS fire disaster has a greater significance
and disproportionate impact on the health care delivery in
Ghana. The direct and the indirect costs of the CMS fire
disaster were very astronomical, and Ghana being a lower
middle-income country whose budget is financed by subsidy
allocations from donor countries cannot afford to lose such
national asset through a cause that could have been avoided.
Conservatively, the cost of preventing the fire incident could
have been far lower than the current situation of restoration.
It is therefore prudent that the state takes proactive measures
to reduce the risk of fire incidents in the country, if sustain-
able development is to be achieved.
Discussion
After the CMS fire disaster, the government of Ghana and
the entire society profoundly reflected on the precautions
that were not taken against such an incident. Again, national
discourse also centered on how new measures can be taken
to provide a solid foundation so that Ghana can cope with or
prevent future occurrences of such disaster events. The
national introspection highlighted the apparent weak institu-
tional arrangements toward disaster risk prevention, pre-
paredness, and mitigation in Ghana, a situation that has also
been giving extensive attention in some previous studies.
Building disaster risk prevention is viewed as cross-cutting
themes in disaster management and therefore requires proper
coordination of all institutions concerned with disaster man-
agement (Chang-Seng, 2013; Oteng-Ababio, 2011; Pelling,
2003). The framework for disaster management in Ghana
which is placed under the MOI also mandates the Ministry to
work with the Ministries of Finance, Health, Environment,
and Works and Housing, among others, to deliver proper
disaster prevention services.
8 SAGE Open
The framework further enjoins such institutions as the
National Fire Service, Ambulance Service, the Ghana Police
Service, the SIC, and other allied institutions to work in a
coordinated effort to build resilience to disasters. It is there-
fore baffling that given the evidence of these well-established
institutions with the mechanisms and capacities, such state
asset could not be protected against the unexpected disaster.
It is even more baffling to come to the realization that there
are many examples from the global north which typify how
institutions have collaborated to prevent the occurrence or
reduce the impact of disasters of which the disaster manage-
ment institutions in Ghana could have learnt from
(Satterthwaite, 2011). In principle, the fundamental goal that
underpins disaster management as suggested by Pelling
(2003) which is to reinforce the centrality of all disaster con-
cerns and adopt preventive strategies and practical measures
to reduce its potential human and property losses should not
be the responsibility of one institution but should be an activ-
ity of several institutions with one common interest--the
building of resilience.
As opined by Oteng-Ababio (2013), sustaining effective
disaster risk preparedness unequivocally demands strong
political commitment and durable institutional capacities,
which among other things will guarantee the cooperation,
coordination, and collaboration among key stakeholders and
developmental activities (see also Morrice, 2013). However,
the CMS disaster as well as the increased frequency and
destructiveness of recent disasters in urban Ghana have come
to question the political commitment and institutional capac-
ities in preventing disasters. These disaster events seem to
suggest that disaster management institutions are working at
worlds apart. The CMS disaster has brought to the fore the
need to understand the institutional and legislative systems
for building preventive mechanisms against disasters. The
disaster has also highlighted the inextricable links between
disasters and human development as its impact has a devas-
tating toll on health care delivery not only in Ghana but also
in other countries in the West African subregion. Events and
the national discourse on the disaster seemed to suggest that
there appears to be a lack of platform that enables stakehold-
ers in disaster management to cooperate, coordinate, and rec-
oncile agendas; negotiate share-knowledge; or critically
reflect on lessons learnt from past incidents of such nature.
DRR is regarded as a critical component of any sustain-
able development as evidence with the passage Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction document to guide
nations on their DRR programs for the next 15 years (2015-
2030) coinciding with the targets of the Sustainable
Development Goals (World Bank, 2006). The Sendai
Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction among other things
articulates the need for improved understanding of disaster
risk in all its dimensions of exposure, vulnerability, and haz-
ard characteristics; the strengthening of disaster risk gover-
nance, including national platforms; accountability for
disaster risk management; preparedness to "Build Back
Better"; recognition of stakeholders and their roles; mobili-
zation of risk-sensitive investment to avoid the creation of
new risk; resilience of health infrastructure, cultural heritage,
and workplaces; strengthening of international cooperation
and global partnership; and risk-informed donor policies and
programs, including financial support and loans from inter-
national financial institutions. This increased recognition has
been fueled by the seemingly intrasectoral fragmentation of
disaster risks preparedness framework, a challenge which
Chang-Seng (2013) describes as not providing mechanisms
for feeding back into capacity building toward the formula-
tion of disaster management policy and guidance. The CMS
fire incident severely exceeded the capacity of city authori-
ties to provide emergency services. Among the factors
accounting for this include the nonenforcement of statutory
state building regulations and the lack of early warning signs
toward disaster. In the main, the management failed to reor-
ganize and learn from many of the past fire incidences in
Ghana. Public agencies' disaster preparedness activities and
efforts appeared rather ad hoc, fragmented, and uncoordi-
nated, while their cooperation across levels and scales was
basically lacking.
The scale and magnitude of losses from the CMS disaster
defy easy generalization. The study further revealed that
even with the ratification of the Hyogo Framework for
Action in 2005 (United Nations, 2005), which mandates
Ghana to build DRR strategies against fire disasters, design-
ing and implementing fire DRR strategies into all programs
and policies was not well articulated. The CMS disaster con-
notes the prize the country paid for paying inadequate atten-
tion fire risk. Although Ghana is making some progress with
the actualization of the Hyogo Framework for Action
(NADMO, 2015), reducing fire risks to public assets seems
to be a mirage. This is evidence from the many public facili-
ties that have suffered preventable disasters. In Accra, for
instance, the outbreak of fires in the two largest markets,
Makola and Kantamanto, has become almost weekly affairs
(Oteng-Ababio, Ohene Sarfo, & Owusu-Sekyere, 2015).
About 352 fire events were recorded between 1990 and 2002
with an estimated loss of about US$5.4 million (Oteng-
Ababio et al., 2015). In the case of the Kumasi Central
Market, which is the largest open-air market in West Africa,
the market experienced four devastating fire outbreaks
within a spate of 3 years: May 28, 2009; January 2, 2010; and
December 30, 2012. Such distressful experiences leave deep
and indelible scars in the minds of the fire victims. What is
even more distressful relates to when the populace begin to
count their losses and also come to the realization that the
possible causes of the incident could have been avoided.
Again, the study indicates that the scale and magnitude of
the CMS fire was due to the physical morphology and gover-
nance structure of the facility. The disaster inevitably cause
upheavals not only in the physical environment but also in
the social and economic context. Close examinations of the
facility reveal that it carried physical vulnerabilities due to its
Owusu-Sekyere et al. 9
location or construction practices. Physical examination
revealed that the facility had many structural defects, and
many of the inner chambers where medical supplies were
kept were just temporal compartments without adequate fire
risk reduction safeguards. This situation is in sync with
UN-HABITAT (2008) describes as "structures derived from
village prototypes but are modified by the requirements of
space and the availability of materials--plastic, tin, bits of
cloth, wood and bricks, which draw on past and present
materials" (p. 69). Available data at the GNFS show an
annual increasing incidence of urban fire in Ghana (GNFS,
2013). The increasing frequency of fire outbreaks in the face
of escalating demographic pressures pose a significant chal-
lenge to the extant institutional and urban governance struc-
tures, which have tended in most cases, to deal with the
problem in a reactive, ad hoc and often ambiguous manner.
Summary and Conclusion
The study set out to investigate the multiplicity of factors
that led to the fire that destroyed the CMS, one of the largest
storage facilities for medical supplies in the West African
subregion. From all indications, the CMS disaster evokes
some element of institutional failure and ineptitude. While
the technocrats believed the incidence resulted from nonen-
forcement of disaster prevention procedures and standards,
civil society and other individuals identified corruption and
inefficiencies as a major bane. Irrespective of the source of
vulnerability, the study highlights the fact that noncompli-
ance with institutional and governance framework contrib-
uted to the disaster.
The after events and discourse on the CMS fire disaster
revealed that the incident could have been potentially averted
if all key players in disaster management had played their
respective roles diligently. By engaging the available docu-
ments and exploring the responses of eyewitnesses about the
root causes of the incident, the study sheds more light on how
the fundamental policies underpinning DRR and disaster pre-
paredness were virtually nonexisting or, in some cases, over-
looked. Generally, the thinking and understanding of disaster
risk management is changing. The subject is being increas-
ingly recognized as a major factor in achieving sustainable
development. Emphasis is now being laid on risk reduction
with the ultimate aim of taking a holistic view of DRR and the
importance of linking with diverse stakeholders, taking a cue
from the Hyogo Framework for Action and the Sendai
Framework for Disaster management. In implementing the
frameworks in Ghana, there will be the need to enhance the
capacity of emergency response organizations. There is also
the need for major state institutions to vigorously integrate
DRR interventions into their development plans and projects.
As a recommendation, there should be periodic (preferably,
monthly or bimonthly) risk assessment of all sensitive public
assets to gauge the measures that are being taken to reduce the
impact of any risk, should there be one.
