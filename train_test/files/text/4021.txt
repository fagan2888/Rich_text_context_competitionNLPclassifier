Introduction
The requirement of tumor cells for the supply of oxygen and
other nutrients is fulfilled by the formation of new blood
vessels. The induction of neovessel formation starts with the
release of various molecules by the tumor cells. These mol-
ecules will send signals to the surrounding normal tissue and
activate genes for making proteins involved in the process of
angiogenesis.1 Tumor cell dissemination in the process of
metastasis requires the development of angiogenic blood
vessels. Neovasculature should possess certain structural
characteristics to sustain active intravasation of tumor cells
and their dissemination to secondary sites.2 The relatively
delicate process of neovessel formation can be a target for
antiangiogenic therapy in cancer treatment because of the
genomic stability of endothelial cells compared to cancer
cells. Cancer cells require less generation time and have
more genetic instability, whereas endothelial cells require
long generation time and have higher genomic stability. The
rapidly proliferating cancer cells often undergo mutations
and would likely acquire drug resistance.3
Neovessel formation is initiated by the secretion of vari-
ous growth factors, especially vascular endothelial growth
factor (VEGF), which can pursue capillary growth into the

Evaluation of Antiangiogenic Efficacy of
Emilia sonchifolia (L.) DC on Tumor-Specific
Neovessel Formation by Regulating MMPs,
VEGF, and Proinflammatory Cytokines
George K Gilcy, MSc1, and Girija Kuttan, PhD1
Abstract
Formation of new blood vessels from preexisting vasculature is an indispensable process in tumor initiation, invasion, and
metastasis. Novel therapeutic approaches target endothelial cells involved in the process of angiogenesis, due to their
genetic stability relative to the rapidly mutating drug-resistant cancer cells. In the present study, we investigated the effect
of an active fraction from Emilia sonchifolia, belonging to the family Asteraceae, a plant well known for its anti-inflammatory
and antitumor effects, on the inhibition of tumor-specific angiogenesis. Administration of the active fraction from E sonchifolia
(AFES; 5 mg/kg, body weight, intraperitoneally) containing the major compound -humulene significantly inhibited B16F10
melanoma-induced capillary formation in C57BL/6 mice. The level of serum vascular endothelial growth factor and serum
proinflammatory cytokines such as interleukin-1, interleukin-6, tumor necrosis factor-, and granulocyte-macrophage
colony-stimulating factor were also reduced significantly. At the same time, administration of AFES significantly enhanced
the production of antiangiogenic factors such as tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase-1. Dose-dependent reduction
can be seen in the budding and expansion of microvessels from rat thoracic aorta by AFES treatment. Inhibition of the
activation of proenzyme to active enzyme of matrix metalloproteinase along with a successful reduction of proliferation,
invasion, and migration of human umbilical vein endothelial cells demonstrated the antiangiogenic effect of AFES in vitro.
To date, no study has examined the antiangiogenic activity of this plant with already well-known anti-inflammatory and
antitumor effects. Results obtained in the present study by using both in vivo and in vitro angiogenic models altogether
proved the inhibitory effect of AFES on tumor-specific neovessel formation.

tumor. VEGF is a powerful inducer of angiogenesis, stimu-
lates growth and proliferation of endothelial cells, acts as a
survival factor of endothelial cells, prevents their apoptosis,
and also regulates vascular permeability. Matrix metallo-
proteinases (MMPs) induce angiogenesis by degrading
extracellular matrix (ECM) along with the release of angio-
genic mitogens stored in the matrix.1 The degradation of
ECM components surrounding the tumor tissue is mainly
brought about by the gelatinases MMP-2 and MMP-9.2 The
family of natural inhibitors of metalloproteinase are TIMPs
(tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases), and TIMP expres-
sion is related to tumor metastasis and angiogenesis.4
Interactions between malignant and inflammatory cells
present in the stroma could be closely associated with
angiogenesis and tumor progression.5 The same molecular
events trigger inflammation and angiogenesis6; pro-inflam-
matory cytokines including interleukin-1 (IL-1), inter-
leukin-6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor- (TNF-) can be
prometastatic or proangiogenic, and their deregulated
expression directly correlates with the metastatic potential
of several human carcinomas.7 The proinflammatory
response can be directed toward tumor promotion via stim-
ulation of the angiogenic process.8
Several traditionally used natural compounds and herbal
extracts have been investigated as antiangiogenic agents to
prevent neovascularization of developing tumors. These
include some of the works on Andrographis paniculata,9
(+)-catechin,10 vernolide-A,11 and ursolic acid.12 Various
biological activities of Emilia sonchifolia covering a gamut
of beneficial properties have been reported. Preliminary
studies conducted on this plant showed its antitumor13 and
anti-inflammatory activity along with reduction of inducible
nitric oxide production.14,15 Further studies revealed its pro-
tective effect on oxidative stress,16 modulation of selenite
cataract,17 apoptotic activity on cancer cells,18,19 antinoci-
ceptive effects,20 and immunomodulatory effects.21 Recently,
we have done a complete phytochemical screening of the
plant, and its antimetastatic effect was analyzed using the
most active solvent fraction containing the major active
principle -humulene (C

).22 The present study was
designed to explore the inhibitory effect of the active frac-
tion from E sonchifolia (AFES) on tumor-specific neovessel
formation, using both in vivo and in vitro models.
Materials and Methods
Animals
Healthy adult male C57BL/6 mice (4-6 weeks old) were
purchased from the National Institute of Nutrition,
Hyderabad, India. They were accommodated in individual
ventilated cages, fed with normal mice chow, and given
water ad libitum. All the animal experiments were carried
out with the prior approval of the Institutional Animal
Ethics Committee and were conducted strictly adhering to
the guidelines of the Committee for the Purpose of Control
and Supervision of Experiments on Animals (CPCSEA)
constituted by the Animal Welfare Division of the
Government of India (Sanction No. 149/1999/CPCSEA).
Cell Lines and Reagents
Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were
isolated from human umbilical cord vein according to the
method of Jaffe etal.23 The cells were grown in medium
199, supplemented with 20% fetal bovine serum, 100 units/
mL penicillin, 100 µg/mL streptomycin, and 2 ng/mLVEGF
and fibroblast growth factor (FGF) at 37°C in 5% CO
2
atmosphere. B16F10 melanoma cells were obtained from
National Centre for Cell Science, Pune, India. Highly spe-
cific quantitative sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent
assay (ELISA) kits for mouse IL-1, IL-6, TNF-,
and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor
(GM-CSF) were purchased from Pierce Biotechnology
(Rockford, IL). ELISA kits for VEGF and TIMP-1was pur-
chased from R&D Systems (Minneapolis, MN). Radioactive
3H-thymidine was obtained from the Board of Radiation
and Isotope Technology, Mumbai, India. Silica gel, colla-
gen, FGF, MTT (3,4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyl-
tetrazolium bromide) and TNP 470 were purchased from
Sigma Aldrich (Bangalore, India). n-Hexane, ethyl acetate,
and dimethyl sulfoxide were obtained from Merck
Specialities Private Ltd, Mumbai, India. All other chemi-
cals used were of analytical reagent grade.
Plant Material, Isolation of Active Principle, and
Experimental Design
The whole plants of E sonchifolia were obtained from
Amala Ayurveda Pharmacy, Thrissur, India, after authenti-
cation, the voucher specimen is deposited at the herbarium
of Amala Cancer Research Centre (Voucher No. 108/
ACRC). The whole plants of E sonchifolia were dried at
45°C and powdered. The powder was then extracted with
70% methanol in Soxhlet apparatus for 24 hours, and the
solvent was evaporated to dryness at 42°C under reduced
pressure using a rotary evaporator. The extract obtained was
then subjected to silica gel column chromatography (200-
400 mesh size, n-hexane­ethyl acetate, gradient). Different
fractions were collected, and the fraction with least polarity
was again subjected to purification using n-hexane­ethyl
acetate (99:1) to yield the active fraction that contains
-humulene. Gas chromatography mass spectrometry anal-
ysis of the isolate revealed the presence of 71% of the major
sesquiterpene -humulene (Figure 1A) present in the plant
E sonchifolia. For animal experiments the AFES, 5 mg/kg
body weight, was administered intraperitoneally (ip).
Gilcy and Kuttan NP3
Three groups of C57BL/6 mice (8 animals per group)
were used for the study. Angiogenesis was induced in all
groups of animals by injecting B16F10 melanoma (106
cells/animal) intradermally on the shaven ventral skin of
each mouse. Group I animals were kept as control. Group II
and Group III animals were treated with 5 consecutive dose
of AFES (5 mg/kg body weight) and TNP-470 (30 mg/kg
body weight), respectively, starting simultaneously with
tumor challenge. For in vitro experiments 3 nontoxic con-
centrations of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 µg/mL) were resus-
pended in 0.1% dimethyl sulfoxide. Dimethyl sulfoxide
alone when used as vehicle in 0.1% and lesser concentra-
tions showed no inhibitory effect on neovessel formation in
the experimental conditions.
Toxicological Evaluation of AFES
AFES in different concentrations (5, 10, 15, 20 mg/kg body
weight) was administered intraperitoneally to Balb/c mice
(n = 8) for 14 days. Animals were observed for mortality,
behavioral changes, and change in body weight. On 15th
day, all the animals were sacrificed and selected organs
such as liver, spleen, thymus, kidney, and lungs were dis-
sected and weights were recorded. Blood was collected by
heart puncture; the serum was separated and used for the
analysis of hepatic and renal functions. Liver function
markers, such as alkaline phosphatase (ALP),24 glutamate
pyruvate transaminase (GPT),25 and kidney function mark-
ers such as creatinine26 and blood urea nitrogen27 were
determined.
Determination of the Effect of AFES on Tumor-
Specific Capillary Formation
The angiogenesis-induced animals were sacrificed on the
ninth day after tumor challenge. The skin from the ventral
side was dissected out, washed with phosphate-buffered
saline, and the number of tumor-directed capillaries were
counted using a dissection microscope at 20× magnification.
Determination of Serum IL-1, IL-6, TNF-,
GM-CSF, VEGF, and TIMP-1 Levels
Blood was collected from the caudal vein of all groups of
angiogenesis-induced animals at 2 time intervals--days 2
and 9 after tumor induction. Serum was separated and used
for the estimation of IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, GM-CSF, VEGF,
and TIMP-1 levels using ELISAkits according to the manu-
facturer's instructions, and the readings were taken using an
ELISA plate reader (Thermo LabSystems, Beverly, MA).
Cell Viability by MTT Assay
The viability of cultured cells was determined by assaying
for the reduction of MTT to formazan.28,29 HUVECs were
seeded (5000 cells/well) in a 96-well culture plate and incu-
bated for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO
2
atmosphere. Different
concentrations of AFES (0.5-100 µg/mL) were added and
incubated further for 48 hours. Four hours before the com-
pletion of incubation, 20 µL of MTT (5 mg/mL) was added.
The percentage of viable cells was determined using an
ELISA plate reader.
3H-Thymidine Incorporation Assay
HUVECs (5000 cells/well) were seeded on a 96-well cul-
ture plate and incubated at 37°C in 5% CO
2
atmosphere.
After 24 hours, various concentrations of AFES (2.5, 1, and
0.5 µg/mL) were added along with 2 ng/mL of VEGF and
further incubated for 48 hours. 3H-thymidine was added to
each well (1 µCi/well) and incubation was continued for an
additional 18 hours. After completing incubation DNA was
precipitated using 10% ice-cold perchloric acid, and pellets
were dissolved in 0.5 mL of 6 N NaOH and transferred to 5
mL scintillation fluid. Radioactivity was measured using
Rack Beta fluid scintillation counter (Wallac 1209;
Pharmacia, Uppsala, Sweden).

Rat Aortic Ring Assay
The rat aortic ring assay is used as an in vitro angiogenesis
experimental model. Dorsal aorta from a freshly sacrificed rat
was taken out in a sterile manner and rinsed in ice-cold
phosphate-buffered saline. It was then cut into approximately
1-mm-thick sections, and each ring was placed in a collagen-
precoated 96-well plate. The rings were incubated for 24 hours
at 37°C in complete medium and then replaced with condi-
tioned medium from B16F10 melanoma cells and incubated
with different concentrations ofAFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 µg/mL).
Controls were kept without AFES treatment. The rings were
analyzed by phase-contrast microscopy for microvessel out-
growth on the sixth day and the sections were photographed.
Determination of the Effect of AFES on
Endothelial Cell Migration
HUVECs were seeded on a collagen-precoated 96-well plate
at a density of 2 × 105 cells/well and incubated for 24 hours at
37°C in 5% CO
2
atmosphere. The monolayers of cells were
scraped with a narrow tip by applying suction. The scraped-
out cells were removed by washing with serum-free medium.
Different concentrations of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 µg/mL)
were added along with 2 ng/mL VEGF and further incubated
for 24 hours. After incubation the cells were fixed in formalin
and stained with crystal violet and photographed.30
Determination of the Effect of AFES on
Endothelial Cell Invasion
The invasion assay was carried out in modified Boyden
chambers as described by Albini et
al.31 The lower
compartment of the chamber was filled with serum-free
medium and a polycarbonate filter membrane coated with 25
µg type I collagen was placed above this. HUVECs (105
cells/150 µL medium 199) were then seeded on to the upper
chamber in the presence and absence ofAFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5
µg/mL) along with 2 ng/mLVEGF and FGF and incubated at
37°C in 5% CO
2
atmosphere for 10 hours. After incubation,
the membranes were removed, fixed with methanol, and
stained with crystal violet. Cells migrating to the lower sur-
face of the polycarbonate membrane were counted under a
microscope. The results were expressed as percentage inhibi-
tion of invasion.
Gelatin Zymography
SDS-PAGE (sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel elec-
trophoresis) was performed by incorporating 0.1% gelatin in
the separating gel.32 Subconfluent HUVECs were incubated
with serum-free medium for 24 hours at 37°C in 5% CO
2
atmo-
sphere. The conditioned medium was then collected and sub-
jected to zymographic analysis. Samples equivalent to 100 µg
proteins were activated with 5 µL trypsin solution (75 µg/mL)
in the presence and absence ofAFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 µg/mL) in
0.1 M Tris-HCl, 10 mM CaCl
2
buffer (pH 8.0), and incubated
for 1 hour at room temperature. Samples were mixed with an
equal volume of 2× sample buffer and loaded on to 11% poly-
acrylamide gels containing 0.1% gelatin. Electrophoresis was
carried out at 4°C with a constant current of 2 mA/tube until the
tracking dye reached the periphery. The gels were then washed
with 2% Triton X-100 in 0.1 M Tris-HCl, 10 mM CaCl
2
at
37°C for 18 hours followed by staining with Gelcode Blue stain
reagent for 2 hours. The clear areas on the gels were then
visualized.

Statistical Analysis
The data were analyzed using Graphpad InStat software
(San Diego, CA) and expressed as mean ± SD. Statistically
significant differences between groups were calculated by
the application of an analysis of variance (ANOVA) fol-
lowed by Tukey-Kramer multiple comparisons test. Values
of P < .05 were considered as significant.
Results
Toxicological Evaluation of AFES
The toxicity study (Table 1) revealed the no observed-adverse-
effect level of AFES as 15 mg/kg body weight. The doses of
5, 10, and 15 mg/kg body weight, administered for 14 days,
did not produce any mortality, change in behavior, body
weight, relative organ weight, and hepatic and renal functions
when compared with untreated animals. Administration of
AFES at 20 mg/kg body weight produced slight weight loss.
Based on these results and some preliminary screening on
biological activity, we selected the nontoxic lowest dose of 5
mg/kg body weight for further studies.
Effect of AFES on Tumor-Specific Capillary
Formation
The effect of AFES on tumor-directed capillary formation is
shown in Figure 2. AFES treatment produced significant
(P > .001) inhibition (57%) of tumor-directed capillary for-
mation along with a noticeable reduction in tumor size. The
result obtained as shown in the figure was comparable to the
well-known antiangiogenic compound TNP-470 used as ref-
erence in this study.
Effect of AFES on the Level of Proinflammatory
Cytokines, VEGF, and TIMP
AFES treatment significantly inhibited the elevated levels
of serum IL-1, IL-6, TNF-, and GM-CSF, as shown in
Figure 3. The elevated level of angiogenesis-promoting
VEGF in tumor-bearing animals was also lowered signifi-
cantly by AFES treatment compared to control animals. At
the same time the level of tissue inhibitor of MMPs was
increased by the treatment (Figure 4).
Effect of AFES on Cell Viability
The percentage viability of HUVECs after treatment with
AFES is shown in Figure 1B. The concentration needed for
50% growth inhibition (IC50) of HUVECs was found to be
80.8 µg/mL. The cells were 100% alive at 0.5, 1, and 2.5 µg/
mL concentrations of AFES, and these concentrations were
used for further in vitro experiments.
Effect of AFES on Endothelial Cell Proliferation
Rate of proliferation of HUVECs was determined by
3H-thymidine incorporation into the cellular DNA.
Proliferation was expressed as radioactive counts per min-
ute (cpm). HUVECs showed very high rates of proliferation
(4313 ± 110 cpm) when stimulated with VEGF.
Administration of AFES at a concentration of 2.5 µg/mL
showed a significant inhibition (55%, 1940 ± 40 cpm) of
VEGF-induced proliferation of HUVECs. Considerable
inhibition of proliferation was also observed when AFES

was administered at concentrations of 1 µg/mL (48%, 2236
± 95 cpm) and 0.5 µg/mL (22%, 3349 ± 105 cpm).
Effect of AFES on the Microvessel Outgrowth
From the Rat Aortic Ring
The microvessel outgrowth from the rat aortic ring was
induced by treatment with conditioned medium from
B16F10 melanoma cells. Treatment with different concen-
trations of AFES significantly inhibited the microvessel
outgrowth in a dose-dependent manner compared to the
control group without any treatment (Figure 5).
Effect of AFES on Endothelial Cell Migration
Effect of AFES on the migration of HUVECs is shown in
Figure 6. HUVECs migrated into the scraped clear area
when stimulated with VEGF as shown in the control with-
out any treatment. AFES significantly inhibited the
VEGF-induced migration of endothelial cells in a dose-
dependent manner and maximum inhibition of endothe-
lial cell migration was observed at 2.5 µg/mL as evident
from the figures.
Effect of AFES on Endothelial Cell Invasion Assay
The invasive property of HUVECs through the collagen
matrix is very high when stimulated with VEGF and FGF.
The administration of AFES produced significant inhibition
in the invasion of cells in a dose-dependent manner. The
number of cells found on the lower surface of the polycar-
bonate membrane at a concentration of 2.5 µg/mL AFES
was very low. The treatment of HUVECs with higher con-
centration of AFES produced an inhibition of invasion by

Gilcy and Kuttan NP7
61%, whereas at 1 µg/mL and 0.5 µg/mL, the inhibition of
invasion was found to be 52% and 39%, respectively
(Figure 7).
Gelatin Zymography
Type IV collagenases MMP-2 and MMP-9 secreted by the
cells into the conditioned medium are mainly proenzymes
that require activation. Conditioned medium after trypsin
activation showed digested clear areas at 92 kD and 72 kD,
which were identical to MMP-9 and MMP-2 activity. The
inactive form of the enzyme did not show clear degradative
areas when the gels were loaded by conditioned medium
without trypsin activation. EDTA inhibits the proteolytic
activity by chelating Ca+, and the enzyme responsible for
degradation is metalloproteinase, which is evidenced when
gels loaded with trypsin-activated conditioned medium were
incubated with 10 mM EDTA, which did not produced clear
degradative areas. When conditioned medium was treated
with AFES at concentrations 2.5 and 1 µg/mL during trypsin
activation, it did not show any clear bands suggesting that
AFES inhibited the activation of proenzyme to active enzyme
of metalloproteinases. But AFES at 0.5 µg/mL showed an
activation of metalloproteinases as shown in Figure 8.
Discussion
Tumor vasculature is considered as a prime prognostic
marker of tumor grading.33 Antiangiogenic therapy is a
highly effective strategy for destroying tumor development
because it directly affects the vascular supply, the basic
requirement for tumor growth. The agents that target angio-
genesis can be effectively used in therapy because of its
more specific nature compared to chemotherapy and radio-
therapy. These agents are also less toxic and can be used
for long term without the development of drug resistance in
the target cells. Most blood vessels in the adult organism
remain quiescent but have the capability to divide in
response to proper stimulus and results in angiogenesis.1
Plants constitute a major source of highly effective conven-
tional drugs for the treatment of different types of cancer. A
large number of the sesquiterpenes obtained from medici-
nal plants that are used in traditional medicine show anti-
cancer activity by inhibition of inflammatory responses,
prevention of metastasis, and angiogenesis. In this study,
an active fraction containing the major sesquiterpene
-humulene from the plant E sonchifolia, with renowned
anti-inflammatory and antitumor effects, showed signifi-
cant reduction in tumor-directed capillary formation, with
a simultaneous inhibition in the proliferation, migration,
and invasion of endothelial cells, the crucial processes of
neovessel formation.
The inhibition of capillary formation toward the devel-
oping tumor by AFES treatment revealed its antiangiogenic
effect in an in vivo experimental condition. AFES signifi-
cantly halted the endothelial cell proliferation, invasion,
and migration, further proving its targeted activity toward
the cells involved in neovascularization. The in vitro

experiment of microvessel outgrowth from the aortic ring is
strong direct evidence for the inhibitory effect of AFES on
the endothelial cell-dependent angiogenic process.
Endothelial cell invasion during angiogenesis is a key pro-
cess that involves degradation of the basement ECM barri-
ers to allow free mobility of the cells required for the
formation of new blood vessels. This is accomplished by
the production of lytic enzymes that are able to digest the
specific matrix components and permit cell invasion.2 There
is a correlation between MMP expression and tumor inva-
sion. The metastasis-supporting vasculature is shaped by
continuous proteolytic modification of ECM and MMPs.
MMP-mediated regulation of VEGF-induced tumor vascu-
larization was completely inhibited by MMP blockage and
reduced the volume of angiogenic vasculature.34 The matrix
degrading enzymes are produced in inactive proenzymatic
forms, and the enzyme trypsin can activate pro-MMPs to
active MMPs. The gelatinases A and B (MMP-2 and MMP-
9) were found to be overexpressed in invasive tumor cells.4
MMP-9 not only readily digests denatured collagens and
gelatins but also plays its particular role in angiogenesis
since it increases the bioavailability of proangiogenic fac-
tors. AFES treatment showed a significant inhibition in the
invasion and migration of the collagen matrix by HUVECs
in a dose-dependent manner, and zymography analysis
showed an inhibition in the activation of the proenzyme
form to the active form of metalloproteinases; both these
processes are mediated by the involvement of matrix-
degrading enzymes. These results denote the regulatory
effect of AFES on MMPs. TIMPs regulate MMPs through
endogenous protease inhibition; high levels of TIMP were
always associated with inhibition of endothelial cell migra-
tion. Progression of invasive and metastatic tumors showed
a decreased level of TIMPs.35 The TIMP-free status of pro-
MMP-9 is an important biochemical characteristic required
for unencumbered and rapid activation and high angiogenic

antiangiogenic effect and the ability to block MMPs via
positively modulating the level of its tissue inhibitors.
VEGF is a potent mitogen, acts as a survival factor for
endothelial cells, and also mediates vessel permeability and
migration of endothelial progenitor cells from the bone
marrow. VEGF is a rational therapeutic target because it has
a limited role in adults. Often, VEGF is secreted by tumors.1
The prime target of VEGF is endothelial cells, and cancer
cells release VEGF to induce tumor angiogenesis. The
VEGF stimulates VEGF receptors on the tumor endothe-
lium or in the tumor cell itself. VEGF therapy supports
tumor growth by inducing angiogenesis and also by direct
action via VEGF receptor expression by tumor cells.37
Administration of AFES reduced the elevated level of
serum VEGF in angiogenesis-induced animals, indicating
the efficiency of AFES in targeting VEGF and thereby
reducing the VEGF-assisted migration and survival of
endothelial cells. By lowering the level of VEGF, AFES can
also inhibit the neovessel formation induced by tumor cells
for their growth and development. The role played by TNF-
 can be linked to almost all steps involved in tumorigene-
sis, including proliferation, invasion, angiogenesis, and
metastasis.38 TNF- acts as a macrophage-activating factor
and activates these cells to secrete angiogenic factors.1
IL-1 is required for invasion and metastasis of cancer cells
and promotes tumor growth and angiogenesis.39 IL-6 pro-
duced by endothelial and tumor cells is a potent proangio-
genic cytokine and promotes MMP-9 activation and VEGF

96-well titer plate and incubated overnight at 37°C. A clear area was made with a narrow tip in the monolayer and further incubated
for 24 hours in the presence and absence of AFES (2.5, 1, and 0.5 µg/mL) along with VEGF (2 ng/mL). After incubation, the cells were
fixed and stained using crystal violet and photographed. (A) Control "0" hour incubation; (B) Control after 24-hour incubation in

release from these 2 types of cells.40 IL-6 is also capable of
increasing endothelial permeability and stimulating prolif-
eration of endothelial cells.41 GM-CSF enhances tumor cell
proliferation, migration, and angiogenesis. It stimulates
angiogenesis by endothelial cell proliferation and migra-
tion.42 Lowering of the elevated levels of TNF-, IL-1,
IL-6, and GM-CSF further confirmed the antiangiogenic
effect of the active fraction from E sonchifolia with already
proven anti-inflammatory effects. By lowering the level of
these cytokines,AFES was involved directly or indirectly in
the inhibition of tumor-directed neovessel formation by
blocking the main culprits like MMP and VEGF that
actively take part in the process.
In conclusion, antiangiogenic therapy that targets vascu-
lar growth within the tumor is now widely accepted to treat
various tumors, because the agents used in this treatment
modality have fewer side effects due to the quiescent nature
of the blood vessels in adults. The genetic instability of
tumor cells is the main cause of the failure of systemic che-
motherapies. But the endothelial cells of the tumor stroma
are genetically stable and believed to respond to antivascu-
lar therapy because they are unable to become drug resis-
tant. The present study clearly proved the inhibitory effect
of the active fraction containing the major active principle
-humulene on tumor angiogenesis by efficiently decreas-
ing MMPs, VEGF, and proinflammatory cytokines while at
the same time increasing the level of TIMP. The retarding
effect of AFES was clear-cut from the decreased capillary
formation and prevention of microvessel outgrowth from
the aorta. Additional evidence for the inhibitory effect of
AFES is the impediment on endothelial cell proliferation,
invasion, migration, and also hampering of the activation of
