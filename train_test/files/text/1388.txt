Abstract
Backgroud: Bone mineral density (BMD) is a marker of long-term estrogen exposure. BMD
measurement has been used in this context to investigate the association of estrogen with breast
cancer risk in three cohorts. In order to assess further BMD as a predictor of estrogen related
cancer risk, the association of BMD with colorectal and corpus uteri cancer was investigated in the
NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Study (NHEFS) cohort along with breast cancer and prostate
cancer.
Methods: Participants were members of the NHEFS cohort who had BMD measurement in 1974­
1975. Age, race, and BMI adjusted rate ratios and 95% confidence intervals were calculated for
incidence of cancers of the corpus uterus, breast, colorectum, prostate, and of osteoporosis and
hip fracture related to baseline BMD.
Results: Data were available for 6046 individuals. One hundred cases of breast cancer, 94 prostate
cancers, 115 colorectal cancers, 29 uterine cancers, 110 cases of hip fracture and 103 cases of
osteoporosis were reported between 1974 and 1993. Hip fracture and osteoporosis were both
significantly inversely associated with BMD. Uterine cancer was positively associated (p = 0.005,
test for linear trend) and colorectal cancer negatively associated (p = 0.03) with BMD. No
association was found between elevated BMD and incidence of breast cancer (p = 0.74) or prostate
cancer (p = 0.37) in the overall cohort, although a weak association was seen between BMD and
subsequent breast cancer incidence when BMD was measured in post-menopausal women (p =
0.04).
Conclusion: The findings related to cancers of the uterus and colorectum as well as the weak
association of BMD with breast cancer strengthen the use of BMD as a marker of estrogen
exposure and cancer risk.

Background
Three recent reports, from the Study of Osteoporotic Frac-
tures [1], Framingham [2], and the Fracture Intervention
Trial [3] demonstrated a positive association between
bone mineral density measurements (BMD) in women
and subsequent onset of breast cancer. All of these reports
were regarded as significant because estrogen has been
thought to increase breast cancer risk [4] and BMD may be
a more accurate measure of long term estrogen exposure
than recall of hormone supplementation, measurements
of endogenous estrogen, parity, or obesity [5,6].
In the light of strong associations previously noted be-
tween estrogens and corpus uteri cancer, BMD should pre-
dict the occurrence of endometrial cancer [4], though this
has not yet been directly assessed. BMD also reflects expo-
sure to calcium and to physical activity as well as foods af-
fecting calcium absorption and deposition [7­9]. All of
these factors, including estrogen, are thought to diminish
the risk of colorectal cancer [10,11]. On the other hand in-
creased calcium intake has been associated with increased
risk of prostate cancer [12,13]. Because of the intimate as-
sociation of BMD with to all of these exposure variables,
BMD needs to be examined in relation to each of these
cancers. In this report we use the NHANES I Epidemiolog-
ical Followup Study to pursue four hypotheses relating
BMD to cancer: that BMD will correlate directly with sub-
sequent breast, uterus, and prostate cancer incidence, and
that BMD will correlate inversely with subsequent color-
ectal cancer incidence.
Methods
The First National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES I) collected data from a national probabil-
ity sample of the United States civilian
noninstitutionalized population between the ages of one
and seventy-four years [14]. The initial survey took place
from 1971 through 1974. In addition to the emphasis on
nutrition in NHANES I, a subset sample of persons age
25­74 received a more detailed health examination
through October 1975. This additional exam included a
hand/wrist x-ray. This was successfully completed in 6,
413 subjects. Each x-ray was a posterior/anterior view of
the left hand and wrist taken by direct exposure using 10
´ 12 Eastman Industrial Type AA "Ready Pak" film. The
prescribed radiography technique called for a focus to
film distance of 36 inches with the focal spot centered on
the midpoint of the third metacarpal. These hand/wrist x-
rays were originally evaluated for BMD by photo densit-
ometry measurements of the phalanx V-2 and the radius.
BMD was determined from the radiography using a refer-
ence wedge. The hand/wrist x-rays have since been reread
for bone density using a technique called Osteo Gram Ra-
diographic Absorptiometry (RA) by Compu-Med Incor-
porated. BMD could not be calculated using this method
for 153 of the 6, 413 subjects with hand x-rays due to im-
proper exposure, poor picture quality, damaged or miss-
ing film. Records for the 6, 260 cases that have been reread
are contained in the Public Use File (Radiography Absorp-
tiometry Bone Density). Additional data on RA can be
found in an introduction to that public use file. RA has
been found to have an excellent precision (CV of 0.6%)
and accuracy and to correlate well with other accepted
methods of bone densitometry.
Data on disease incidence were obtained on the individu-
als from the NHANES I Epidemiologic Followup Studies
(NHEFS), which was conducted in four waves of data col-
lection through 1993. Data collected included in depth
interviews with subjects or their proxies, hospital records,
including pathology reports, and collection of death cer-
tificates for deceased subjects. Tracing is complete for 90%
of the cohort through 1993.
Those with at least one follow-up record in NHEFS were
included in the analysis, resulting in a final sample size of
6,046. Disease outcomes were obtained using ICD-9
codes (International Classification of Diseases, 9th Revi-
sion) from death certificates and hospital record diagnos-
tic codes in NHEFS mortality and health care facility stay
data bases, respectively. They were: uterine cancer (179,
182.0, 182.1, 182.8), colorectal cancer (153.0­154.3,
154.8), breast cancer (174.0­174.9), prostate cancer
(185), hip fractures (820.0­820.3, 820.8, 820.9), and os-
teoporosis (733.00­733.03, 733.09).
Person-years of follow-up were computed for each cohort
as the amount of time since the NHANES I examination
to the date of the first of the following events: date of ICD-
9 disease code of interest from the health care facility stay
files, date of death from the NHEFS mortality file, or the
last day of contact from the 1992 NHEFS vital status file.
Thus, subjects were right-censored at either death or last
date of follow-up. For persons with more than one hospi-
tal admission listing a particular disease outcome of inter-
est, the date of the earliest admission for that disease was
used. Person-years of follow-up were calculated separately
for each disease outcome. Cohorts who reported at base-
line a history of hip fracture were excluded from the hip
fracture analysis (30 women and 27 men) for a total sam-
ple size of 5989, and those who reported a prior malig-
nant tumor or growth were excluded from the cancer
analyses (120 women and 49 men) for total sample sizes
of 5877 for the colorectal cancer analysis, 3108 women
for the breast and uterine cancer analyses, and 2769 men
for the prostate cancer analysis.
Cohorts were divided into 4 groups according to their RA
BMD: <95, 95­105, 105­115, >115 (mass/volume units
established by Compu-Med). Chi square tests for trend

and linear regression analysis using a single variable for
RA-BMD group were used to evaluate the relationship of
BMD to BMI, gender, age and ethnicity, as appropriate.
For each diagnosis of interest, incidence rates were calcu-
lated for each BMD group by dividing the number of cases
of disease by the number of person-years of follow-up.
Cox proportional-hazards models were fitted for disease
outcomes with BMD groups using the PHREG procedure
from the SAS System for Windows Version 8.01. Covari-
ates in the analysis were age at NHANES I examination
(<35, 35­50, 50­60, and >60 years), body mass index
(BMI; weight in kg/height in m2) at NHANES I examina-
tion (<22, 22­25, 25­28, >28), and race (Caucasian ver-
sus other). Analyses of colorectal cancer, hip fractures and
osteoporosis outcomes were adjusted for gender. Similar
models, replacing the 3 indicator variables for RA BMD
with a single variable for RA BMD group, were tested to
determine the significance of the trend in risk of disease.
For the analysis including only women older than 55
years, the cohort was divided into 4 groups according to
BMD quartile. The association of BMD quartile with
breast cancer in women older than 55 was tested using
Cox proportional hazards models as described above. Co-
variates included in the model were indicator variables for
quartile of age, quartile of BMI, and race (Caucasian ver-
sus other). Since we would expect that age would be expo-
nentially related to cancer, and for breast and uterine
cancer the slope of the exponential line would change af-
ter menopause, the use of age categories did not constrain
age to be linearly related to the outcome.
Results
The BMD sample of NHANES I included 6, 046 individu-
als who had bone density read by RA and follow-up data
in NHEFS. This group included 5, 252 Caucasians, 742 Af-
rican Americans, and 52 individuals of Hispanic origin.
There were 2, 818 men and 3, 228 women. The median
age at the time of bone density reading was slightly less
than 50 years. Table 1 describes the relationship of gender

hort.
By 1993, a total of 103 cases of osteoporosis, 110 cases of
reported hip fracture, 115 cases of colorectal cancer, 100
cases of breast cancer, 94 cases of prostate cancer and 26
cases of uterine cancer had been reported within this sub-
set of the NHANES I cohort. Significant inverse associa-
tions were seen with both osteoporosis and hip fracture
(Table 2) after adjustment for age, BMI, race, and gender.
Table 3 describes the relationship of BMD to uterine can-
cer risk. After age, race and BMI adjustment there was a

creasing BMD.

(n = 1091), that is, probably after the age of menopause at
the time that their BMD was measured, a positive associa-
tion of BMD and breast cancer was suggested (p = 0.04 for
trend in a quartile comparison). A total of 43 breast can-
cers developed in this latter, older group.
There was an inverse association of BMD with colorectal
cancer after adjustment for age, race, BMI, and gender that
was statistically significance (p = 0.03: Table 5).
Prostate cancer risk was not significantly associated with
increasing levels of BMD (p = 0.37), although there were
diminished risks in upper quartiles of BMD, which was in
the opposite direction of our hypothesis (Table 6).

BMD measurement, though no clear preference has dom-
inated this literature [15­17]. Because we assumed that
the most direct consequences of diminished BMD would
be osteoporosis and hip fracture, associations of BMD
with hip fracture and the development of osteoporosis
were investigated in order to establish the validity of this
BMD measurement in this cohort. As anticipated, in the
NHEFS, diminished BMD is significantly associated with
the development of osteoporosis and hip fracture (Table
2).
Uterine cancer
This is the first report that examines the relationship of
BMD to uterine cancer. Because the association of estro-
gen exposure and uterine cancer development is far less
controversial than estrogen and breast cancer risk [4], the
veracity of BMD as a measure of estrogen exposure is sup-
ported by the significant positive association of BMD with
uterine cancer incidence (Table 3).
Breast cancer
Although no association between BMD and subsequent
breast cancer incidence was found for all women in the
cohort, a weak but significant association was seen in
those over 55 years of age at the time of BMD measure-
ment, i.e. post menopause. The total number of breast
cancer cases is comparable to the three studies discussed
below, as is the size of the cohort. However, the three pre-
vious studies all recruited peri- and post-menopausal
women [1­3], an age group that comprised just less than
half the women in the NHANES I BMD cohort. The
NHANES I female BMD cohort size and number of breast
cancer cases in this post-menopausal subgroup are there-
fore smaller than the other studies. Nevertheless, there is
a significant, though unstable trend towards increasing
breast cancer risk with rising BMD in those women re-
cruited to NHANES I older than 55 years (Table 4).
The relationship of estrogen exposure to subsequent
breast cancer risk has been the subject of much debate and
investigation [4]. The debate is all the more significant be-
cause of estrogen's possible role in the prevention of cor-
onary heart disease mortality, hip fracture and
osteoporosis [5]. Three studies were greeted with great en-
thusiasm because they added a new perspective to the de-
bate, correlating BMD with breast cancer risk. In so doing
they seemed to confirm that estrogen exposure over a long
period of time increased the risk of breast cancer [1­3],
(Table 7). In the Study of Osteoporotic Fractures, 6, 854
women greater than 65 years old had their BMD measured
and were followed-up for an average of 3.2 years. Ninety-
seven women developed breast cancer [1]. The incidence
rate of breast cancer varied from 2.46 cases / 1000 person
years in the lowest quartile of bone mineral density to
5.99 cases / 1000 person years in the highest quartile (rel-
ative risk 1.50: 95% confidence interval = 1.16 to 1.95).
In the Framingham study, 1, 373 women age 47 to 80
years had bone density measured from 1967 to 1970. By
1993, 91 women developed breast cancer [2]. The age ad-
justed rate ratios for breast cancer from the lowest to the
highest quartile of BMD were 1.0, 1.3, 1.3 and 1.5 respec-
tively. However, the effect was found to be far greater in
women with a positive family history of breast cancer in
the Framingham report. Among those without a family
history of breast cancer, the risk was not significantly in-
creased [18].
In the Fracture Intervention Trial, 8203 postmenopausal
women between 54 and 80 years of age were enrolled in a
therapeutic trial related to fracture prevention [3]. With a
maximum of five years of follow-up, a total of 158 women
were found to have breast cancer, 131 of which received
the diagnosis more than six months after enrollment, and
102 of which were invasive cancers. Treatment (alendro-

nate for osteoporosis) in the randomized trial did not al-
ter breast cancer risk. Age adjusted risk increased with
increasing quartiles of BMD, though marginal statistical
significance was achieved for invasive cancer only in the
highest versus lowest BMD quartiles (OR = 1.8; 95% CI =
1.0­3.2). Unlike Framingham, family history of breast
cancer did not alter the results related to BMD. Calcium
and vitamin D ingestion were found to be associated with
diminished breast cancer risk. This might imply that the
estrogen effect on breast cancer risk, as manifested in
BMD, could have been diminished by increasing exposure
to calcium and vitamin D.
An indirect method has been employed to assess the rela-
tionship of estrogen exposure to breast cancer risk
through bone density assessment: the association of oste-
oporotic fracture to the prior or subsequent diagnosis of
breast and uterine cancer (Table 7). One recent large case/
control study presents compelling evidence for dimin-
ished risk of previous recent fracture in women with both
breast and uterine cancer [19]. Four earlier reports of frac-
ture and breast cancer were evenly divided in their results,
though the negative studies included fracture after the di-
agnosis of cancer [20,21,23,24]. Uterine cancer has also
been assessed in all but one of these reports [20,22,23]
and found to be positively associated with fracture in two.
Colorectal cancer
The results of these analyses show a protective trend of
BMD for colorectal cancer that is statistically significant
(Table 5). Estrogen is thought to diminish risk for color-
ectal cancer, though there has been variation in findings
concerning which subsite within the colorectum is pro-
tected by estrogen exposure. Other factors related to BMD
are also thought to effect colorectal cancer risk, positively
(age, body mass index, smoking) or negatively (calcium,
estrogen, physical activity) [9,10]. Of these, the most
widely investigated has been calcium. Twenty-four analyt-
ic studies of calcium in cohort and case/control designs
have been reported. Only ten of these have shown a sig-
nificant decrease in colon cancer risk associated with cal-
cium intake. In addition, there have been 8 studies of
vitamin D intake, only 3 of which have shown decreased
colorectal cancer risk related to increased vitamin D [25].
The reason for these inconsistent results relating to calci-
um may be that calcium nutriture is difficult to measure.
Bioavailability of calcium is related to the intake of other
nutrients, which include dietary fiber (phytate), phos-
phate, alcohol, and tea (tannins). Each can alter colorectal
cancer risk. Therefore, serum calcium levels and dietary in-
take do not necessarily reflect endogenous content. As
with iron, endogenous calcium stores may be the more

significant effector of risk than dietary calcium intake
[26]. In the case of calcium, the measure of endogenous
stores is BMD.
The investigation of BMD and colorectal cancer risk,
therefore, provides a new perspective in the analysis of cal-
cium and colorectal cancer risk, and in addition provides
information on two other factors for colorectal cancer that
are thought to diminish risk: physical activity and estro-
gen [10]. This is the first such report analyzing this associ-
ation.
Prostatic cancer
Reported herein is the first study to obtain BMD measure-
ment prior to the diagnosis of prostate cancer, and no as-
sociation was found (Table 6). Calcium ingestion has also
been associated with increased risk of prostate cancer
[10,11]. The only study to look at BMD and prostate can-
cer risk was a case/control design. It showed no associa-
tion, although cases already had prostate cancer when
BMD was measured and controls were patients with other
urologic diseases or presenting for prostate cancer screen-
ing [27].
BMD and estrogen
BMD is affected by many factors other than estrogen, in-
cluding principally age, calcium, body mass index, ciga-
rette smoking, physical activity, and prior bone injury. As
such it is a non-specific indicator of risk. BMD was also
measured in NHANES I at a time when post-menopausal
use of estrogen was rare. Its increasing use in recent dec-
ades may have altered the subsequent risk of cancer in
these women. Nevertheless, the results seen in opposite
directions in uterus and colorectum suggest that estrogen
exposure at least up to the point at which BMD was meas-
ured was a significant mediator of risk for cancer in
NHANES I. The weakly positive results for breast cancer in
combination with previously published reports suggest
that, unlike the other endpoints reported herein, BMD as
a predictor of breast cancer risk is only of use when meas-
ured after menopause.
Conclusions
In summary, this NHANES I cohort follow-up is the first
report of analyses of BMD and subsequent risk for cancer
of the colorectum and uterus, the fourth for breast cancer
risk and the second for prostate cancer. A strong positive
association was seen between BMD and corpus uteri can-
cer, and a significant trend towards decreasing colorectal
cancer risk with increasing BMD. There is an insignificant
decline in risk for prostate cancer with increasing BMD, a
direction opposite of our initial hypothesis. A weak rela-
tionship could be detected between breast cancer and
BMD only when BMD was measured after menopause.
Significant inverse associations were found between
BMD, osteoporosis and hip fracture.
