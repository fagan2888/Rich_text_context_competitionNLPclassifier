Abstract. The impact of Yarbus's research on eye movements was enormous following the trans-
lation of his book Eye Movements and Vision into English in 1967. In stark contrast, the published
material in English concerning his life is scant. We provide a brief biography of Yarbus and assess his
impact on contemporary approaches to research on eye movements. While early interest in his work
focused on his study of stabilised retinal images, more recently this has been replaced with interest
in his work on the cognitive influences on scanning patterns. We extended his experiment on the
effect of instructions on viewing a picture using a portrait of Yarbus rather than a painting. The results
obtained broadly supported those found by Yarbus.

1 Introduction
Al'fred Luk'yanovich Yarbus (Iarbus) is one of the founders of modern eye movement
research; two portraits of him are shown in figure 1. His book Eye Movements and Vision,
published in Russian in 1965 and translated into English by Basil Haigh in 1967, has had a
profound influence on recent approaches to the study of eye movements and vision. The
impact has been widespread across a range of disciplines, and his book now stands as
one of the single most cited publications in the area. It is therefore somewhat surprising
that so little is known about the man himself and his career in science. In this paper we
present some new details about Yarbus, consider the impact of his eye movement studies on
contemporary vision research, and revisit and extend Yarbus's now-classic exploration of how
the instructions given to an observer can influence the observer's eye movement behaviour.
Our report differs from Yarbus's work by exploring inspection behaviour when looking at
a photographic image of a single individual (Yarbus himself) rather than a painted scene
containing several individuals and a range of objects (Ilya Yefimovich Repin's The Unexpected
Visitor(1)).
2 Yarbus
The name Yarbus is known to almost every student of experimental psychology. Moreover, fig-
ures from his book are reproduced in most textbooks on perception. Despite this widespread
exposure to his name and to his research, very little is known to English readers about Yarbus

himself. Almost all that is available can be gleaned from the few lines printed inside the
English edition of Eye Movements and Vision:
Al'fred Luk'yanovich Yarbus was born in Moscow in 1914. He was graduated from the Faculty of
Physics of Moscow University in 1941 and was a scientific assistant at the Institute of Biophysics
of the Academy of Sciences of the USSR until 1963. He is presently a senior scientist at the
Institute for Problems of Information Transmission of the Academy. In 1964 he received the
degree of Doctor of Biological Sciences for his work on `The Role of Eye Movements in Vision'
(Yarbus, 1967, page iv).
No further biographical details appear in the book; nor were we able to trace any further
substantive information until recently. Thanks to personal communications with a number
of researchers, we have been able to piece together the following brief outline of Yarbus's
professional and personal life.
Yarbus was born on April 3, 1914, in Moscow to Polish parents who had immigrated to
Russia some years earlier because of parental disapproval of their marriage. His natural
father died when he was young, and his mother remarried Lukian Yarbus, from whom
Al'fred Luk'yanovich took his name. Yarbus studied in the Department of Physics at the
Moscow Lomonosov State University between 1935 and 1941. After graduating, he worked as
an engineer in Moscow, before his military service, which spanned from 1942 to 1946 and
included time in the Far East on the Japanese front (see figure 1a for an image of Yarbus during
this period). During this time, Yarbus was married to Shalgovsakaya Yevgnia Yohanesovna,
who was of German extraction. They had a daughter Francheska, born in 1942 while Yarbus
was at the front on war service. Francheska has subsequently followed a successful and
distinguished career as an artist. She married Yuri Norstein, and the two are internationally
famous for their animated cartoons.
Following the war, Al'fred Luk'yanovich worked as a researcher at the Institute of
Crystallography before completing a PhD on visual illusions in 1950 under the supervision
of Professors Kravkov (sensory physiology) and Rubenstein (psychology). Following this,
Yarbus obtained a position as a researcher and then (from 1957) as a senior research fellow

at the Biophysics Institute of the USSR Academy of Sciences, which in 1963 became part
of the newly established Institute for Problems in Information Transmission. His work on
visual illusions subsequently led to interest in eye movements and to the psychological
and biophysical effects of stabilised images. At that time he became one of a group of
talented scientists that included mathematicians, physicists, and physicians. The leaders
of this interdisciplinary laboratory were Michael Moiiseevich Bongard (the founder of
Russian research in artificial intelligence and pattern recognition) and Michael Sergeevich
Smirnov (an expert in sensory physiology and communication). The technician of the
group, Vadim Ivanovich Chernishev, was the first to make suction cups to attach to the
eyes. Initially these were largely impractical due to discomfort for the wearer; it was Yarbus
who proposed refinements to the technique, which, after a number of trials and errors, led
to the development of a range of suction devices for eye tracking (see below and figure 2b).
These devices were used successfully throughout his research and were adopted by other
laboratories for similar research studies. For his work using suction devices to measure eye
movements, Yarbus was awarded his second academic degree, a PhD in Biological Science in
1964.
Yarbus's eye movement work progressed in the 1950s and 1960s, with regular journal
publications. In 1965 he wrote the book which, in its 1967 English translation (Eye Movements
and Vision), has become a well-known classic. Basil Haigh was a noted translator, and reviews
of Yarbus's book often commended the quality and the clarity of the translation. Haigh was
trained in medicine and learned Russian when he served in the British embassy in Moscow
between 1950 and 1953. After he took a position at Cambridge University in 1959, Haigh
translated many texts by Russian neuroscientists, particularly the books of A R Luria.
Yarbus's work was already known to Western scientists, in part because many of the
articles were published in Biofizika, a Russian journal whose first issue appeared in 1955,
and which maintained an English version, Biophysics. Pick (1964) wrote a review of Russian
research on perception in which Yarbus was mentioned briefly, but wider recognition was to
follow. Sporadic citations appear in articles from most of the leading laboratories working
on eye movements (Barlow 1963; Clowes and Ditchburn 1959; Krauskopf and Riggs 1959;
Rashbass and Westheimer 1961a, 1961b; Robinson 1964), although not to the extent that
would be the case after the book was published: see, for example, the extensive attention
that his work is given in the books by Alpern (1969) and Lévy-Schoen (1969).
Most of Yarbus's early work appears as single-author publications, although his name
can be found on multi-author works, including some in the Western European literature
coauthored with the distinguished Soviet psychologist and neuroscientist Alexander Ro-
manovich Luria (Karpov, Luria, and Yarbus 1968; Luria, Karpov, and Yarbus 1966; Luria,
Pravdina-Vinskaya, and Yarbus 1963). These few publications are the first in the literature
considering highly diagnostic features of oculomotor behaviour after differently localised
instances of brain damage. Despite the wide international and interdisciplinary recognition
of Yarbus's work (or perhaps due to it), this was evidently not an easy period in his life,
both professionally and personally. Some of his co-workers appear to have resented their
exclusion from the credit, and relations in the laboratory became difficult. Also, other work
in the laboratory gave rise to debate about the generalisability of some of his findings (see
Rozhkova, Nikolaev, and Shchadrin 1982).
Yarbus divorced and remarried at the age of 53, and a son, Anton (currently a prose writer
living in Moscow), was born to this marriage. He subsequently pursued a more lone individual
course of research and a series of ten papers entitled "Work of the human visual system"
appeared in Biofizika between 1975 and 1980. He was interested in a kind of analogue
electrical modelling of human vision during the last two decades of his life, conducting
10 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
numerous experiments on subthreshold summation of brightness and colour stimuli. In
1986 Yarbus developed cancer and died. Figure 1b shows Yarbus in a photograph thought
to have been taken during the 1980s. Yarbus's career spanned a sensitive period for Soviet
science and its support; we refer the reader to Krementsov (1997) for a survey of Soviet science
during this period.
2.1 Eye movements and vision
The original Russian version of Yarbus's book was entitled     
, the direct translation being The Role of Eye Motion in Vision Processes (DeAngelus
and Pelz 2009). This monograph was the culmination of several years of research by Yarbus,
during which he developed a novel set of devices for recording and compensating for eye
movements. An English translation of the monograph was published in 1967 (figure 2a) and
reprinted in 1971.
The cornerstone of Yarbus's research summarised in his monograph was the development
of a method for accurately recording eye movements, using suction caps on the eyes (figure 2b
shows two of the eight discussed in the book). The caps developed by Yarbus allowed stable
recordings of eye position over extended periods of recording. Importantly, he developed
devices that allowed images to be presented that moved with the eyes such that a stabilised
retinal image could be presented. That this was his principal concern is evident from the
opening sentences of his preface: "This book deals with the perception of images which are
strictly stationary relative to the retina, the principles governing human eye movements, and
the study of their role in the process of vision" (page ix).

Yarbus's suction caps, together with the recording device. (With kind permission from Springer Science
and Business Media.)
The first two chapters, constituting half the book, are devoted to describing the methods
developed by Yarbus and his colleagues and the use of these to study the perception of
stabilised retinal images, respectively. Yarbus himself makes clear that these are the two key
chapters of the book. In his preface to the English version he dwells primarily on the suction
cap methods and his hopes that these techniques might be adopted by other laboratories: "In
the author's opinion, this technique is suitable for use in studying a wide range of phenomena.
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 11
It would be a source of great satisfaction if this technique were to be adopted in the research
laboratory and new and interesting results obtained by its use" (page vii). In the introductory
chapter Yarbus states that chapter two is "the most important in the book" (page 2). Similar
emphasis on this first half of the book is placed by the publishers in the inside dust cover of
the book, and in Gerald Westheimer's (1968) review of the book in Science:
Yarbus's significant contribution is the development of tightly fitting contact lenses that do
not move at all with respect to the eye. As a result he achieves stabilization good enough
and lasting long enough that there is no reappearance of even very bright lights for several
minutes... In what must surely be the most important segment of this book, Yarbus describes
the appearance of stabilized visual fields of various colors to which are added fields of different
colors, stabilized and unstabilized (page 657).
In the early 1950s, the issue of image stabilisation attracted several groups of researchers,
most notably Ditchburn and Ginsborg at Reading University, Riggs and Ratliff at Brown
University, and Barlow at Cambridge University. Ratliff and Riggs (1950) employed an optical
lever system and photography to record the involuntary motions of the eye during fixation.
Barlow (1952) placed a droplet of mercury on the cornea and photographed the eye during
motion and fixation; the instabilities during fixation were small but measurable. Ditchburn
and Ginsborg (1952) used an optical system with a disc subtending 1° separated into halves
vertically. Luminance differences between the two parts were visible initially but disappeared
after 2 or 3 s; the diffuse disc remained visible with occasional reappearances of the bipartite
disc (see Ditchburn 1973). Yarbus developed a fuller-fitting contact lens which retained its
position by suction. With his optical system, he found that "in any test field, unchanging and
stationary with respect to the retina, all visible differences disappear after 1­3 sec, and do
not reappear in these conditions" (Yarbus 1967, page 59). The research was concerned with
determining the visual consequences of compensating for involuntary eye movements, but
there were some differences between the various studies. The source of these was examined
by Barlow (1963), who used a full-fitting contact and a suction cap after the manner of Yarbus
in order to compare their possible slippage; an afterimage was used as a perfectly stabilised
target. The suction cap was more stable than the full-fitting contact lens, but neither was free
from some slippage. He concluded, "Good-quality images stabilized as well as possible ...
`blur' and lose contrast rapidly: detail and texture cease to be visible, and do not reappear"
(Barlow 1963, page 50).
The suction caps developed by Yarbus were not only for the purpose of presenting
stabilised retinal images but also for recording eye position while inspecting external stimuli.
A series of suction caps were developed for this purpose, two of which are shown in figure 2b.
The variety of designs was employed in order to meet different experimental requirements
and to offer a set of devices that would be able to meet a wide range of experimental
paradigms.
The second half of Eye Movements and Vision is much broader in scope and contains a
large number of eye movement recordings exploring a variety of topics. As Westheimer (1968)
explains, in this second half of the book "[t]he approach, an indigenous mix of psychology
and cybernetics, is interesting and obviously productive, but it is not by any means superior to
the research strategies with which we are more conversant" (page 657). Here Yarbus considers
miniature movements during fixation (chapter 3), detailed kinematics of individual saccades
(chapter 4), vergence (chapter 5), and pursuit (chapter 6). However, it is the final chapter of
the book, entitled "Eye movements during perception of complex objects", that has become
Yarbus's key contribution to the recent history of eye movement research. This chapter is
dense with plots of eye movement records and considers an impressively wide range of
questions about how people inspect complex objects and scenes. Of particular note in this
12 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
chapter is a series of records of observers viewing Ilya Repin's The Unexpected Visitor (figure 3).
Here Yarbus showed that when different people viewed the same painting, the patterns of
eye movements were similar but not identical. When a single individual was shown the
same painting a number of times, with between one and two days separating the recording
sessions, the eye movement records from successive viewings were again very similar but not
identical. It was evident, however, that similarity between the inspection patterns for a single
observer was greater than it was between observers. Yarbus also considered how viewing
behaviour changes over extended periods of time, looking at eye movement behaviour in
selected sections of a long (3 min) recording session, and then exploring in great detail the
first 35 s of a viewing period. Early in the viewing period, fixations were particularly directed
to the faces of the individuals in the painted scene. The general trend for fixations when
viewing scenes to fall preferentially on persons within the scene had been known previously
(Buswell 1935)--although, rather surprisingly, it has only recently been demonstrated that
this trend is present on the very first fixation (Fletcher-Watson et al 2008).

www.ilyarepin.org.)
Dissecting a long viewing period into a series of sections suggested to Yarbus that when we
view a complex scene for an extended period of time, we show repeated cycles of inspection
behaviour, where repeated 25 s samples from 3 min recording sessions revealed the following:
"analysis of these separate records shows that each of them, roughly speaking, corresponds
to a cycle during which the eye stops and examines the most important elements of the
picture" (1967, page 194). This cyclic behaviour was also found when an observer viewed a
photographic portrait showing only a face. In two such recordings, the observer was found to
cycle periodically through the triangle describing the eyes, nose, and mouth of the pictured
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 13
subject (figure 4). While it was a relatively minor contribution to the chapter, this report of
face scanning has assumed a prominent place in the history of face research. This study of
face viewing provided two key insights into how we look at faces. First, it shows there is a
strong preference to look at the eyes more than any other feature of the face. Second, for
extended viewing there is a clear tendency to make repeated cycles of fixations between the
key features of a face. Yarbus's work has become widely cited in the face research community
for both of these key early insights into face viewing (see Kingstone 2009).
The observation of cyclic scanning behaviour, and indeed of cognitive influences on
viewing (see below), has had far-reaching consequences. Notably, this work underpinned the
Scanpath Theory developed by Noton and Stark (1971). This theory proposes that the paths
taken by the eye during extended viewing are an integral part of our perception of complex
images. Furthermore, Noton and Stark suggest that the replicability of eye movement patterns
for repeated viewings of a stimulus or during extended viewing reflects this sensorimotor
aspect of perception. While the theory has subsequently been criticised, it is clear that
Yarbus's work profoundly influenced the development of these ideas.

instructions for 3 min. (b) a girl's face viewed with no instruction for 1 min. From Yarbus (1967, figures
114 and 115). (With kind permission from Springer Science and Business Media.)
However, despite the richness of this chapter, the vast majority of citations of Yarbus's
book draw upon the data presented in just one of the figures in the series of recordings of
observers viewing The Unexpected Visitor and the surrounding discussion of these data.
Yarbus's invaluable contribution in this chapter was to ask the same individual to view
the painting seven times, each time with a different instruction before starting to view the
image. These instructions asked the viewer to make a series of judgements about the scene
depicted, to remember aspects of the scene, or simply to look at it freely. The data illustrated
compellingly that simply altering the instructions given to the observer, and thus their task
14 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
while viewing, had a profound effect on the inspection behaviour of the observer (figure 5).
As Yarbus observed: "Depending on the task in which a person is engaged, ie, depending
on the character of the information which he must obtain, the distribution of the points of
fixation on an object will vary correspondingly, because different items of information are
usually localized in different parts of an object" (page 192).

3 Questions raised by Yarbus's work
As we have seen above, the final chapter of Eye Movements and Vision included two key
themes, which have been revisited frequently in the literature over the years since the book
was published and for which Yarbus's book is often cited. First, the chapter was concerned
with scanning behaviour while viewing faces. Second, the chapter was concerned with
how the instructions given to an observer influenced inspection behaviour when viewing
a complex social scene (The Unexpected Visitor). In the present paper we return to these
two central themes of Yarbus's work. The portrait of the young Yarbus (figure 1a) provides
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 15
a convenient (and fitting) stimulus to allow us to extend and combine the themes of the
final chapter of Eye Movements and Vision. First, we can use this portrait to consider face
viewing when more of the person than just the face is present, an issue that has received little
attention in the face viewing literature. Second, we can consider the influence of instructions
on viewing a less contrived image than The Unexpected Visitor. Moreover, this second issue
allows us to consider how instructions influence the manner in which we view faces. Both of
these questions were addressed by conducting a single experiment as detailed below. In the
sections that follow we take the same approach as Yarbus of combining qualitative pictorial
representations of the data and quantitative analyses to explore our two questions.
3.1 Participants
Twenty participants from the University of Dundee took part on a voluntary basis. All had
normal or corrected-to-normal vision, had no prior knowledge of Yarbus or his work, and
were naive to the purposes of the study.
3.2 Procedure
Participants each viewed the portrait of Yarbus, which was embedded in a 1600 by 1200 pixel
white background screen such that the portion of the portrait shown in figure 1a measured
1036 pixels high by 734 pixels wide. Displayed on a 21 in SVGA Iiyama monitor, positioned 60
cm from the observer, the portrait subtended approximately 26 by 18.4 deg in the observer's
field of view.
The same stimulus was shown seven times in random order for each participant. Prior to
each presentation of the portrait, a set of written instructions was displayed on the screen
for 10 s. Table 1 shows the seven different instructions given to participants. After 10 s, the
instructions disappeared and were replaced by the portrait of Yarbus, which was presented
for 50 s. After 50 s, the portrait was replaced with a blank, white screen and the observers were
asked to provide a verbal answer to the question asked in the instructions, where appropriate.
These verbal responses were not analysed.

Condition Instructions
When the picture appears...
1 Simply look at it in whatever way you want.
2 Estimate how wealthy this person was and what his social position was.
3 Estimate how old the person in the picture was when it was taken.
4 Estimate what the person had been doing just before this picture was taken.
5 Remember as much as you can about the clothes the person is wearing.
6 Try to remember the positions and details of everything in the picture.
7 Try to estimate how long this person had been away from home when this
picture was taken and why he had been away.
3.3 Eye movement recording
Eye movements were recorded as participants viewed the portrait, using an SR Research
EyeLink 2 eye tracker set to record gaze position at 500 Hz using only the pupil detection
method. Calibration and validation of the eye tracker involved a randomly permuted display
of nine circular targets on the monitor. If the validation indicated an average error in excess
of 0.5° or a maximum error in excess of 1°, the calibration and validation procedures were
repeated.
Fixations and saccades were classified using the software supplied by SR Research. This
detects saccades when eye position changes by more than 0.1°, with a minimum velocity of
30° s-1 and a minimum acceleration of 8000° s-2, over a period of at least 4 ms. No minimum
16 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
fixation duration or saccade amplitude thresholds were applied. Note that data from two
participants were lost, one due to a technical error as the data were being saved, the other
due to clear vertical slippage of the eye tracker during the recording session.
4 Face viewing in presence of a body
Studies of face viewing, including Yarbus's own work, typically involve the presentation of
isolated faces, devoid of the context of the subject's body (eg Bindemann et al 2009; Butler et
al 2005; Guo et al 2010). Yarbus's report of cyclic looking around the eyes and mouth of the
face to produce the triangular eye movement records seen in figure 4 has become a widely
accepted tenet in face research. However, it is less certain whether such cyclic viewing of the
facial features is seen when the face is viewed in the context of the subject's body.
In Yarbus's consideration of face scanning there was no instruction to the viewer before
they were presented with the face. We therefore use only data from the free viewing condition
in the present analysis. By combining the data from all participants while they viewed the
portrait of Yarbus with no explicit instructions (the `free viewing' condition), we can consider
whether there were general tendencies to fixate on particular parts of the face.
In order to consider whether there was an overall tendency to look more at the eyes
and mouth of the face than other parts of the face, we constructed an overall distribution
of the allocation of gaze to the portrait. This distribution was constructed by iteratively
adding a Gaussian centred around each sample from the eye tracker (each sample being
separated by 2 ms). Each Gaussian had full width at half maximum of 0.5° to reflect estimates
of foveal extent. The resulting 3-dimensional landscape contains peaks, the heights of which
reflect the cumulative viewing time across all participants. For ease of interpretation, this
distribution is presented as a `heat map' overlaid upon the portrait of Yarbus (figure 6). Only
the region around the face is shown in this figure to make comparisons to Yarbus's studies
of isolated face viewing (figure 4) easier. There is a strong tendency to look at one of the
eyes and the mouth of the face in the portrait. The other eye (Yarbus's right eye), which is in
relative shadow on the face, received only a small fraction of the overall allocation of gaze
time.

coloured overlay indicates the amount of fixation time received across all observers.
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 17
While the plot in figure 6 shows an overall tendency to look at the mouth and one of
the eyes, it does not allow us to consider whether participants employed the cyclic viewing
behaviour reported by Yarbus. For this we must look at the sequences of eye movements
made by individual observers. In our dataset we found that the scan patterns over the face
in the portrait varied considerably. Four representative plots are shown in figure 7. In some
cases, scan patterns resembling those found by Yarbus can be seen (the right hand panels
of figure 7). Here we see portions of the scan patterns that involved looks between the
key features of the face. Thus, there was some cyclic looking behaviour evident in these
trials. However, in many cases (for example, the plots in the left-hand panels of figure 7) no
such cyclic patterns of looking around the features were present. In these cases the typical
scanning behaviour described by Yarbus was absent. It should be noted that all of the plots
in figure 7 include a large number of scans to locations outside the sections of the portrait
shown in the plots--these are looks to other parts of the portrait such as the body. We will
return to the issue of looks at non-face regions of the portrait in the next section of this paper.
Figure 7. Scan patterns for four of the observers in the present study as they freely viewed the portrait
of Yarbus. As in figure 6, for comparisons to Yarbus's work on face viewing (figure 4), only the facial
region of the portrait is shown here.
The individual differences in scan patterns over the facial region of the portrait are
consistent with Yarbus's study of individual differences in viewing a complex scene (The
Unexpected Visitor). In figure 108 of the final chapter of Eye Movements and Vision, Yarbus
plotted the eye movement behaviour for seven different observers, each viewing The
Unexpected Visitor for 3 min under free-viewing instructions. We further consider individual
differences suggested in figure 7 of the present study by looking at differences across the
entire spatial extent of the portrait. Figure 8 shows eye movement data for seven randomly
selected participants viewing the portrait of Yarbus. Yarbus's corresponding figure of seven
participants looking at the Unexpected Visitor is shown alongside these data for comparison.
In both sets of data participants viewed the picture with no instructions other than to simply
look at the image. In Yarbus's data, participants viewed the painting for 3 min. In our data
18 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
each participant viewed the image for 50 s. Yarbus noted that there were global similarities in
the patterns of eye movements made by the different subjects when viewing the painting but
that there were also clear differences between these observers. In our data the same general
observations can be made. However, in some cases (compare panels 1 and 2 in figure 8b) the
differences between participants appear quite considerable.

5 Instructions and face viewing
The issue of how a high-level task, such as the instruction given prior to viewing a scene,
influences eye movement behaviour has become a question of central interest in eye
movement research. The debate about the extent to which fixations are allocated on the
basis of internally generated priorities has generated a large volume of research. For an
overview of the current state of the continuing debate about the relative contributions of
low- and high-level factors in targeting eye movements during scene viewing, we refer the
reader to the recent special issue of Visual Cognition on this topic (Tatler 2009) and to Land
and Tatler (2009). However, the literature concerned with the relative roles of low- and high-
level factors in scene viewing rarely engages with that on face viewing. Indeed, the stimuli
employed in scene perception studies are often devoid of faces, comprising natural but
unpopulated scenes. Conversely the stimuli employed in face research are often devoid of
scenes (or indeed anything other than the face). Yarbus's study of The Unexpected Visitor is a
rare example of a scene stimulus that contains human faces, but like other scene perception
studies that have included faces (eg Birmingham et al 2009; Torralba et al 2006), these faces
are too small to discern the detailed manner in which the facial features are scanned and
whether this scanning is sensitive to viewing instructions. Our study allows us to consider
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 19
whether face scanning is sensitive to viewing instruction, but for a stimulus in which the face
is not the only component of the image.
Figure 9 shows the distributions of fixations on the face region of the portrait for all seven
instruction conditions. The plots are constructed in the same way as was done for figure 6
above. Note that there are clear global differences between the seven instructions. Most
notably, tasks 4 (what had the person been doing?) and 5 (remember the clothes) resulted in
a lower proportion of looks to the face region being directed to the eyes.
Figure 9. Fixation distributions on the face of the portrait for each of the seven instruction conditions.
Note that the scaling for the colours varies between plots, with the bars to the right-hand side of each
plot showing the viewing times denoted by the intensities of the colours. Viewing times shown in the
bars to the right of each plot are in milliseconds and are cumulative across all participants.
From figure 9 it is also clear (as shown in the bars to the right-hand side of each plot) that
the amount of time spent looking at the faces varies considerably between tasks. The data
suggest that less time was spent looking at the face for tasks 5 (remember the clothes) and 6
(remember everything) than the other tasks. To consider this in more detail, we now turn to
the question of the manner in which the entire portrait was viewed. To address this--and for
comparison with Yarbus's original data--we first show eye movement records for a single
randomly selected participant from the present study, viewing the portrait of Yarbus with
seven different instructions (figure 10). As can be seen in both the original data collected by
Yarbus and in our own data, the instructions given to the participant had a clear influence
on the overall inspection behaviour of this observer during repeated viewings of Yarbus's
portrait. It is interesting to note the similarities between the patterns of eye movements made
under the seven instruction conditions between our data and those collected by Yarbus. For
example, when asked to estimate age(s) of people (instruction 3), observers restricted their
eye movements almost exclusively to facial and nearby regions. When asked to remember as
20 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
much as possible about everything in the image (instruction 6), eye movements explored the
full extent of the picture.

tions. (a) Yarbus's original data (from figure 109 in Eye Movements and Vision). (b) Data from the

details of everything in the picture. (7) Estimate how long the person had been away from home.
The data in figures 9 and 10 both point to differences in the allocation of gaze across
the seven instruction conditions. However, it is important to consider whether these results
generalise across participants or are parochial to the selected observer. For The Unexpected
Visitor, the question of generalisability of Yarbus's results has been addressed by DeAngelus
and Pelz (2009); these authors showed that the same inter-instruction differences can be
found in a group of observers. For our data, we address this question by considering gaze
allocation across all participants in the present study. Figure 11 shows the distribution of
viewing time combined for all participants across the entire portrait for each instruction
condition. These distributions highlight clear differences in gaze allocation among instruc-
tion conditions and confirm that the differences found in the single participant plotted in
figure 10 generalise across a group of participants.
Figure 11 clearly shows that there were differences in the spatial allocation of attention
to the portrait when viewing it under the seven different instructions. In order to explore
these spatial differences quantitatively, we divided the image into nine regions of interest
(figure 12) and considered how long was spent fixating on each of these regions of interest.
When considering the allocation of fixations across the nine regions of interest, we can
consider the proportion of fixation time in each of the regions (figure 13a). However, the
regions of interest vary considerably in their relative sizes (figure 12). We therefore normalised
the proportion of viewing time by the area of each region of interest in the following analysis.

A two-way ANOVA [instruction condition (7 levels) x region of interest (9 levels)] revealed a
main effect of the region of interest, F(8, 136) = 105.07, p < 0.001, partial 2 = 0.861. Because
fixation times are reported as a (normalised) proportion of the viewing period, there was no
main effect of instruction condition. However, there was an interaction between instruction
condition and region of interest, F(48, 816) = 3.22, p < 0.001, partial 2 = 0.159 (figure 13b).
22 B W Tatler, N J Wade, H Kwan, J M Findlay, B M Velichkovsky
In general, across all conditions, apart perhaps from when asked to remember the clothes
worn, people looked more to Yarbus's facial regions than to other regions of the portrait.
Whether normalised or not, viewing time was very low on the arms, buttons, and background
of the portrait (figure 13). The torso was looked at quite a lot (figure 13a); however, the torso
occupied a large proportion of the image and so would be expected to receive a reasonable
amount of viewing time whether or not it was of particular interest to the viewer. Normalising
viewing time on the torso by the area of this region showed that it received a small relative
fraction of the fixation time (figure 13b).

(b) Normalised viewing time in each ROI for each of the seven instruction conditions. Regions of
interest: 1 = hat, 2 = eyes, 3 = nose, 4 = mouth, 5 = rest of face, 6 = arms, 7 = buttons, 8 = rest of torso, 9 =
background.
These data extend Yarbus's original findings concerning the influence of instructions on
subsequent viewing behaviour. Here we show that, for a much simpler scene in which only
one individual is present, the allocation of gaze changes depending on the instructions given
prior to viewing. Moreover, we have shown that the manner in which a face is inspected
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 23
depends on the instructions given. That is, the typical tendency to view the eyes and mouth,
and to cycle between features, is not universal and can be diminished or absent depending
on the viewer's task. Since faces are rarely seen in isolation under normal viewing conditions,
some caution may be necessary in extending the interpretations from photographed faces to
natural behaviour.
6 The legacy of Yarbus
The rather brief final chapter of Yarbus's Eye Movements and Vision has made a profound
contribution to the subsequent literature on eye movement control during complex-scene
perception. The legacy has been twofold: concerning how people look at faces and how
cognitive factors such as instructions given prior to viewing can influence inspection
behaviour.
In many respects it is the latter of these two contributions that Yarbus's book has become
most well known for. Interestingly, Buswell (1935) had already shown that instructions
influenced fixation behaviour. But Yarbus's visualisations of such clear differences in each of
his seven records of a single observer viewing a single scene have remained an emblematic
illustration of this point. The question of to what extent cognitive factors influence where
observers look in complex scenes rose to the forefront of eye movement research in the early
1990s. Yarbus's prominence in this era coincided with a number of distinguished researchers
beginning to emphasise the importance of cognitive factors on eye movement control. Two
influential publications at the start of the 1990s placed cognitive factors firmly at the forefront
of eye movement research: Eileen Kowler's (1990) chapter on cognitive influences on gaze and
Keith Rayner's (1992) edited volume on Eye Movements and Visual Cognition. Three papers
in the latter discuss the importance of Yarbus's work on cognitive control of fixation selection
(Carroll et al 1992; Henderson 1992; Klein et al 1992). The 1990s also saw the emergence
of the Active Vision approach to eye movements (Ballard 1991; Ballard et al 1992; Findlay
and Gilchrist 2003), and it is at this time that Dana Ballard, Mary Hayhoe, and Mike Land all
began to study eye movements in the context of natural behaviour. All of these authors have
emphasised the importance of Yarbus's work as a demonstration that where we look depends
critically on our cognitive task. Yarbus's work has since become established as a popular,
elegant demonstration of high-level influences on gaze control. The question of whether and
to what extent low- and high-level factors have a role in selecting where humans direct their
gaze when viewing complex scenes continues to be a prominent and controversial topic in
eye movement research (see Land and Tatler 2009; Tatler 2009).
The prominence of Yarbus's work in the modern debate about eye guidance is evidenced
by the total number and yearly frequency of citations that Eye Movements and Vision has
received (figure 14). A noticeable change in the popularity of this work is evident in the
mid-1990s. Indeed, studies of eye movements in natural behaviour have been inspired
heavily by his work. The notion of task-dependent patterns of fixations has driven and
underpinned many of the studies of eye movements in the context of natural behaviour
(Land and Lee 1994; Land and Tatler 2009).
While the prominence of Yarbus's work within the contemporary study of eye movement
control during scene perception is clear, it should be noted that the impact of the work is by
no means restricted to this field of research. The widespread recognition of the importance of
this elegant demonstration of cognitive control of inspection behaviour has had an influence
in areas as diverse as neuroscience, artificial intelligence, computer science, and engineering.
Indeed, the book has been cited in 501 different journals, covering a wide range of subject
areas. Figure 15 summarises the frequency of citations of Eye Movements and Vision across
the nine main disciplines in which the book is cited.

7 Concluding remarks
It is unusual for so little to be known about a visual scientist whose research is so well known.
This applies to Yarbus, particularly amongst the English-speaking scientific community. We
hope that we have attached a little more personal flesh to his sturdy scientific skeleton. His
book on Eye Movements and Vision is cited with increasing frequency, and its attraction has
shifted from the early chapters (relating to image stabilisation) to the later ones (concerning
observation of complex scenes).
One area of study that has expanded enormously since 1967 is face perception. The
characteristic pattern of eye movements when viewing pictures of faces was established by
Yarbus. It has since been replicated many times and has become an accepted canon in face
research. We extend this influential finding by considering face scanning when more than
the face alone is presented to the viewer. Here we found that while facial features, particularly
Yarbus, eye movements, and vision 25
the eyes and mouth, still receive the greatest fraction of gaze allocation, the cyclic scanning
between eyes and mouth reported by Yarbus was less evident when the face is viewed in the
context of a body and cannot be seen in all observers.
The effect of instructions on inspecting complex scenes, demonstrated in Yarbus's
recordings of a single observer viewing the painting The Unexpected Visitor seven times, each
time with different instructions prior to viewing, has inspired and underpinned a wealth
of eye-tracking studies since the 1990s. DeAngelus and Pelz (2009) recently returned to
Yarbus's study and were able to confirm that the findings described by Yarbus for a single
viewer generalised to multiple viewers of The Unexpected Visitor. We extend Yarbus's work
by considering the influence of instructions on viewing a portrait. This allows us not only
to consider whether Yarbus's findings generalise to a more simple visual stimulus but also
the influence of instructions on face viewing. We find similar sensitivity to task instructions
for viewing a portrait as was originally reported in Eye movements and Vision. Moreover, the
extent to which particular features (and indeed the whole face) are looked at depends on the
instructions given prior to viewing.
Yarbus was far seeing in his analysis of vision. In addition to the then contemporary issues
he addressed on image stabilisation, his more exploratory experiments on viewing complex
scenes strike a chord with those extending the study of eye movements beyond the confines
of the laboratory.
