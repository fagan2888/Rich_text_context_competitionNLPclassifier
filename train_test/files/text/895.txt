Why Are Workers
Uninsured?
Employer-Sponsored
Health Insurance In 1997
The high cost of insurance is the main reason workers say they
turn down coverage.
by Kenneth E. Thorpe and Curtis S. Florence
ABSTRACT: This study examines the number of workers in firms offering em-
ployee health plans, the number of workers eligible for such plans, and partici-
pation in employer-sponsored insurance. Data from the February 1997 Contin-
gent Worker Supplement to the Current Population Survey indicate that 10.1
million workers are employed by firms offering insurance but are not eligible.
Not all of these workers are eligible for coverage, most often because of hours
of work. Our results indicate that 11.4 million workers rejected coverage when
it was offered. Of those, 2.5 million workers were uninsured. Workers cited high
cost of insurance most often as the primary factor for refusing coverage.
Several recent studies have examined the number of
workers who are offered and accept employer-sponsored
health insurance.1 These studies have documented a decline in
employer-sponsored coverage, spurred in part by a reduction in the
proportion of workers who accept coverage when it is offered. The
decline in employer-sponsored insurance continues to fuel debate
over approaches for stemming this erosion.
To be effective, policy interventions should address why workers
are uninsured. Uninsured workers may be categorized in three
groups: (1) workers who are in a firm that offers health insurance
but who are not eligible for the health plan; (2) workers who are
eligible for health insurance but decline it; and (3) workers who are
in firms that do not offer health insurance. Previous studies do not
present estimates of the number of workers who are ineligible for
their employers' health plan, nor do they focus on why such workers

are not eligible. In addition, we know relatively little about why
workers reject coverage when eligible. In this DataWatch we use
new data from the 1997 Contingent Worker Supplement (CWS) to
the February 1997 Current Population Survey (CPS) to examine
these key issues.
Data and methods. The CPS is a national monthly labor-force
survey of approximately 59,000 households. The 1997 CWS asked
one respondent in each household several questions concerning em-
ployment and health insurance for all family members age fifteen or
older during the week of 16­22 February 1997.2 The special supple-
ment was designed to estimate the number of workers in contingent
jobs (those designed to last a limited period of time), alternative
employment (independent contractors, on-call workers, workers in
temporary-help agencies, and contract company workers), as well
as traditional wage-and-salary employment. These data provide
new estimates of the number of contingent and alternative workers
and the health insurance coverage associated with these jobs.
Results
Coverage by type, eligibility, and acceptance. During February
1997, 71.7 percent of all workers (88.2 million) were employed by a
firm that offered health insurance (Exhibit 1). Of these workers, 11.5
percent (10.1 million) were not eligible for coverage. Of the eligible
workers, 85.4 percent (66.7 million out of 78.1 million eligible work-
ers) accepted coverage through their employer. This "take-up" rate

is similar to recent estimates.3
Nearly two-thirds of the workers who turned down employer-
sponsored insurance were covered through another family member.
A small number (7 percent) of these workers purchased their own
plan or received coverage through a previous employer or their own
business. We estimate that approximately 22 percent of workers
who declined coverage were uninsured.
Approximately 37 percent of ineligible workers were uninsured,
nearly 11 percent received some form of public health insurance (for
example, Medicaid or Medicare), and nearly 44 percent were in-
sured through another family member. Finally, more than 40 per-
cent of workers in firms that did not offer health benefits were
uninsured, 29 percent received coverage through a family member,
and approximately 23 percent were insured by another employment
source or had individually purchased coverage.
Variation by employment. Access to employer-sponsored insur-
ance varies greatly by employment arrangement (Exhibit 2). More
than 86 percent of wage-and-salary workers (74 million) working
thirty-five or more hours per week were in firms that offered health
benefits. Nearly 5 percent of these workers were not eligible for
these benefits, and 11 percent declined coverage. Other types of
workers have much less access to employer-sponsored plans. Only
63 percent of wage-and-salary workers employed twenty to thirty-
four hours per week were in firms that offered health insurance. Of
these, more than 40 percent were not eligible for their employer's
health plan. Fewer than 63 percent of workers employed twenty to

thirty-four hours per week and eligible for health benefits accepted
them when offered. Finally, only 54 percent of wage-and-salary
workers employed fewer than twenty hours per week were in firms
that offered health insurance. More than 73 percent of these workers
were not eligible for their employer's health plan. Among those
eligible, approximately 38 percent accepted coverage.
Independent contractors and the self-employed account for ap-
proximately 12 percent of the labor force. By nature of their employ-
ment, they have limited direct access to employer-sponsored health
insurance. Similarly, workers in alternative work arrangements
(who make up 3.3 percent of the labor force) have limited direct
access to employer-sponsored insurance. We estimate that 55 per-
cent of alternative workers were in firms that sponsored a health
plan in 1997, and of those eligible for coverage, 64 percent accepted.
Thirty-six percent of alternative workers in firms that offered cover-
age were not eligible for those firms' health benefits.
Reasons for ineligibility. Substantial variation in determining
eligibility for health insurance benefits exists across employers. Our
tabulations reveal that nearly ten million workers--9.1 percent of
wage-and-salary and alternative workers--were not eligible for
health coverage through their employer in 1997 (Exhibit 3). Some 53
percent of workers did not work enough hours each week or enough
weeks per year to be eligible for coverage. Of these workers, nearly a
quarter were uninsured, and approximately 57 percent were insured

through another family member. More than 27 percent had not
worked for their employer long enough to qualify for benefits. Of
this group, nearly two-thirds were uninsured. Finally, 7.7 percent
noted that they were not eligible for benefits because they were
employed as contract or temporary workers. Nearly a third of these
workers were uninsured. Only 1.1 percent of workers cited a pre-
existing health condition as the factor preventing them from obtain-
ing coverage.4
Reasons for rejecting coverage. The survey also examined why
workers who were eligible for health insurance through their em-
ployer declined coverage. Of the 2.5 million uninsured workers eligi-
ble for employer-sponsored coverage, nearly 68 percent cited its
high cost as their reason for rejecting it. Few uninsured workers
(only 1 percent) noted that they rejected health insurance because
they preferred higher wages in lieu of coverage or that they did not
need insurance (4.1 percent). More than a quarter of respondents
noted other factors associated with their decision to decline cover-
age. Unfortunately, these factors were simply coded as "other" in the
survey. In sum, these responses indicate that these uninsured work-
ers generally desired coverage but considered it to be too expensive.
Policy Implications
Our findings provide new evidence regarding the availability of
employer-sponsored health insurance; why some workers were not
eligible for their employer's plan; and why other workers rejected
coverage when it was offered. These categories are policy relevant for
two reasons. First, workers in these categories have varying access to
employer-sponsored coverage. Second, the percentage of workers
without insurance varies substantially within each category.
Our results raise important issues for policymakers seeking to
increase access to employer-sponsored health insurance. In particu-
lar, there were nearly as many workers in firms that sponsored
health insurance who were ineligible for coverage as there were
workers who declined coverage. In addition, access to coverage
among those in jobs outside the traditional wage-and-salary ar-
rangements was relatively limited. These workers accounted for 15
percent of the labor force in 1997. Access to employer-sponsored
health insurance could be reduced if these work arrangements were
to become more common over time.
Absent comprehensive health care reform, several incre-
mental reforms could prove effective based on these findings.
For instance, one could modify the existing nondiscrimina-
tion rules and increase the number of workers eligible for health

benefits when they are offered.5 The nondiscrimination rules could
be broadened to include those working at least twenty hours per
week. Such a change could make 3.5 million additional workers
eligible for health insurance. In addition, reducing the cost of insur-
ance--including small-business purchasing pools--for workers
employed at nontraditional worksites or at home could reduce the
estimated 4.5 million uninsured workers employed outside of the
traditional wage-and-salary work arrangement.

Health Insurance: 1987 and 1996," Health Affairs (November/December 1997):
142­149; P. Fronstin and S. Snider, "An Examination of the Decline in Employ-
ment-Based Health Insurance between 1988 and 1993," Inquiry (Winter
1996/1997): 317­325; and J. Holahan, C. Winterbottom, and S. Rajan, "A Shift-
ing Picture of Health Insurance Coverage," Health Affairs (Winter 1995):

2. By design, the questions on health insurance represent health insurance cover-
age at a specific point in time--namely, during the reference week.
3. See Cooper and Schone, "More Offers, Fewer Takers." It seems probable that
the differences in health insurance coverage between alternative and wage-
and-salary workers could be driven by differences in income between the two
groups. To examine this issue, we stratified the results in Exhibit 2 by family
income. We found that at all levels of income, alternative workers are much
less likely than full-time wage-and-salary workers are to be eligible for em-
ployer plans and are more likely to be uninsured. Also, alternative workers are
not predominantly in low-income families. Approximately two million of the
four million alternative workers have annual family incomes above $30,000.
4. These data are self-reported, and some caveats apply. First, there could be
multiple reasons that workers were not eligible for coverage, and the data
record only one. Second, the responses reflect the worker's perceptions of why
he or she was not eligible, not necessarily the true reason for ineligibility.
5. The Internal Revenue Code includes language outlining federal nondiscrimi-
nation rules. With respect to self-insured health plans, eligibility rules meet
these tests if the plans meets one of the following criteria: It benefits at least 70
percent of the employees; or it benefits at least 85 percent of those eligible,
provided 70 percent or more are eligible; or it benefits a nondiscriminatory
classification of employees. However, part-time or seasonal workers (gener-
ally those not employed more than twenty-five hours per week or seven
months per year, or those working fewer than thirty-five hours per week or
nine months per year) and certain other employees may be disregarded in
determining the nondiscrimination eligibility tests. Loosening these rules to
make more workers eligible for health insurance would increase the availabil-
ity of such benefits to several million workers. At the same time, however,
these changes would increase the costs of providing such benefits.
