Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune disease of unknown etiology, often associated
with other autoimmune conditions. Controlled studies have so far provided conflicting data on
risk factors and comorbidity rates in PBC. We enrolled patients with PBC (n  1032) from 23
tertiary referral centers for liver diseases in the United States and random-digit-dialed controls
(n  1041) matched for sex, age, race, and geographical location. Patients and controls were
administered a modified version of the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Study
(NHANES III) questionnaire by trained personnel to evaluate associations between PBC and
social, demographic, personal and family medical histories, lifestyle, and reproductive factors
and the rates of comorbidity in affected individuals. Data indicate that having a first-degree
relative with PBC (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 10.736; 95% confidence interval 4.227-27.268),
history of urinary tract infections (AOR 1.511, 95% CI 1.192-1.915), past smoking (AOR 1.569,
95% CI 1.292-1.905), or use of hormone replacement therapies (AOR 1.548, 95% CI 1.273-
1.882) were significantly associated with increased risk of PBC. The frequent use of nail polish
slightlyincreasedtheriskofhavingPBC.Otherautoimmunediseaseswerefoundin32%ofcases
and 13% of controls (P<0.0001). In conclusion, environmental factors, possibly including
infectious agents through urinary tract infections or chemicals contained in cigarette smoke, may
induce PBC in genetically susceptible individuals. Exogenous estrogens may also contribute to
explain the female predominance of the disease. (HEPATOLOGY 2005;42:1194-1202.)
Primary biliary cirrhosis (PBC) is an autoimmune
disease of unknown etiology leading to progressive
destruction of the proximal intrahepatic bile ducts,
cirrhosis, and eventually liver failure.1 PBC is character-
ized by female predominance and disease-specific serum
anti-mitochondrial (AMA) and anti-nuclear (ANA) auto-
antibodies.1 PBC should be considered as a rare disease
based on its prevalence in the United States of 4/10,0002.
Based on these data, less than 200,000 affected individu-
als should be expected in the general US population, thus
fulfilling the criteria of the 2002 Rare Disease Act (HR
4013). Further, PBC constitutes a significant economic
burden resulting in yearly costs of 69-115 million US
dollars for hospital charges alone, as estimated by the
Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project (HCUP). Both
prevalence3 and mortality4 rates for PBC have been in-
creasing over the past decade.
Genetic factors likely play an important role in confer-
ring susceptibility to PBC, as indicated by the high con-
cordance rate among monozygotic twins5 and the
increased incidence among first-degree relatives of af-
fected individuals6. PBC often coexists with several other
autoimmune diseases (which also may be genetically de-

termined) in the same individual or family1. However, the
concordance of PBC among discordant twin pairs5, the
geographical pattern in prevalence rates7, and the occur-
rence of clusters of the disease8 indicate that environmen-
tal factors might contribute to break immunological
tolerance and lead to the onset of PBC. Both chemicals9
and bacteria10 have been suggested as environmental fac-
tors responsible for the induction of PBC in genetically
susceptible individuals.
PBC epidemiological data from the United States on
risk factors for PBC and comorbidity rates were assessed
only in one report using a questionnaire administered to
patients with PBC, their siblings and friends.11 We report
herein the results of the largest case-control study to date
of environmental, familial, and medical factors associated
with PBC. The study is based on a structured, standard-
ized telephone interview, administered by trained person-
nel to 1032 patients with PBC from the United States and
1041 unrelated controls selected by random-digit-dialing
(RDD) and matched for sex, age, race, and geographical
location.
Patients and Methods
PBC Cases. Between November 1999 and June
2004, a total of 1090 patients with PBC were referred
from 23 collaborating tertiary referral medical centers for
liver diseases located in various areas of the United States
(listed in the appendix to the manuscript). Cases were
being followed at such centers or by local hepatologists
who had active relationships with the tertiary centers. Pa-
tients were eligible for inclusion if the diagnosis of PBC
had been made between 1996 and 2004 and was based on
pre-determined criteria, including a detectable AMA and
at least one of the following: a cholestatic pattern of serum
biochemical tests (serum alkaline phosphatase 2 times
normal upper values) for at least 6 months and/or com-
patible liver histology.12 In suspected cases of PBC with-
out detectable AMA (up to 10% of patients in the routine
clinical laboratory 13), criteria were modified and included
all the following: ANA or anti-smooth muscle autoanti-
bodies, a cholestatic pattern of biochemical tests (elevated
serum alkaline phosphatase) for at least 6 months, and a
compatible liver histology. To assess accuracy, referring
physicians re-evaluated anonymized clinical information
in 100 randomly selected enrolled patients. The diagnosis
of PBC was confirmed in all cases. Referred patients re-
ceived a letter from the Principal Investigator (M.E.G.) to
explain the nature and goals of the study and were asked
to contact the Division of Clinical Immunology at UC
Davis if interested in participating. Patients who decided
to participate were then called to schedule the telephone
interview. A total of 1032 (95%) patients with PBC were
administered the questionnaire by telephone interview
and were compensated for their partecipation to the
study. After being informed about the procedures of the
study, 58 (5%) declined to participate.
Controls. Controls were selected by RDD and
matched to cases for sex, 5-year age group, race, and geo-
graphical area. RDD utilized a technique that excludes
the majority of phone numbers that are not assigned to
households.14 Briefly, a complete list of all valid area codes
and prefixes was obtained for the area where each case
resided. Numbers were then added at random to consti-
tute a phone number, and 15 attempts in dialing each
number (on different days and at different times) were
made by the California Department of Health Services
(CDHS) Computer Assisted Telephone Interview
(CATI) unit. Once one or more willing, case-matched,
eligible controls was identified among the primary sam-
pling units (PSUs), the telephone interview was sched-
uled. A letter was also immediately sent to enrolled
control subjects to explain further the nature and goals of
the study. A total of 181,806 telephone numbers were
called resulting in 47,395 contacts that confirmed the
residential nature of the number. Among eligible con-
trols, 1041 (80%) agreed to participate after being in-
formed about the nature of the study, completed the
telephone interview, and were compensated for their
partecipation to the study with the same amount as PBC
cases. Six hundred and eighteen controls (59%) were in-
terviewed within a 12 month period from matched cases,
354 (34%) between 12 and 24 months, and 50 (5%)
controls between 24 and 36 months. In 13 PBC cases
(including Native American and Asian patients), more-
over, race-matched controls could not be identified. In
these case, Caucasian controls were used after matching
for sex, age, and geographical area. Lastly, in 9 PBC cases,
two eligible controls were identified among PSUs and
both were administered the interview and included for
analysis to avoid selection bias.
Data Collection. The study design was approved by
local ethical committees at all partecipating institutions
and respected the most recent Declaration of Helsinki
(Edinburgh, 2000). Further, all patients and controls gave
written consent to the use of data for research purposes
after being informed about the nature of the study prior to
the telephone interview. The telephone interview instru-
ments consisted of standardized questions derived from
the US National Health and Nutrition Examination Sur-
vey (NHANES III). The instrument included over 180
questions and 300 subquestions regarding demographics,
lifestyle, personal and familial medical history, and repro-
ductive (for female cases and controls only) and occupa-

tional history. Trained personnel belonging to the CDHS
CATI unit interviewed both patients and controls with
interviewers unaware of the available literature on PBC
etiology. Each interview lasted approximately 90-180
minutes. To estimate the reproducibility of the obtained
information, a subgroup of 40 cases was randomly se-
lected and the questionnaire was re-administered to these
subjects at least 12 months after the first interview. The
responses from this group of 40 were then used to esti-
mate the consistency of data over time and analyzed as
previously described.15 Results of this reliability analysis
showed a 93% average consistency rate between inter-
views (range 86%-100%).
Data Analysis. Descriptive statistics were used to com-
parecharacteristicsofPBCcasesandmatchedcontrols.First,
socioeconomic, demographic, and clinical characteristics
were compared for both study participants and their first-
degree family members. Specifically, we compared age
groups, race/ethnicity, gender, and socioeconomic status, as
well as familial occurrence of PBC. In addition, reported
comorbidities with other autoimmune diseases in partici-
pants and family members were examined. Second, we com-
pared lifestyle factors, such as smoking, diet, and the use of
various chemical compounds, such as hair dye and nail pol-
ish.Third,weexaminedreproductivefactorsandhistoryand
hormonal medications among females only. Specifically, the
number of pregnancies, use of oral contraceptives or hor-
mone replacement therapy (HRT), and history of gyneco-
logical conditions were recorded. The unadjusted analyses of
differences between cases and controls for potential risk fac-
tors were performed using the Wilcoxon test for continous
variables and the Fisher exact test for categorical variables.
We next developed multivariable models using condi-
tional multiple logistic regression analyses. The back-
wards elimination model selection strategy was used to
ensure that the models were relatively parsimonious using
a criterion of P  .05 for inclusion of variables. Race
(white or other), geographical location, and age were in-
cluded in all models as candidate explanatory variables
because they were used as matching criteria in the surveys.
In addition, annual household income was included as a
candidate variable in all models.
The model for sociodemographic and clinical candi-
date variables included sex, education level, body mass
index (BMI) at age 25 (grouped as "high" [30], "me-
dium" [25-30], and "low" [25]), indicators for whether
the person had at least one vaccination (for chickenpox,
hepatitis A, hepatitis B, diphteria-pertussis-tetanus, ru-
bella, mumps, polio, small pox, or tuberculosis) and
whether the person had had at least one urogenital con-
dition (including pelvic or vaginal infection in women or
any urinary tract infection in both sexes). Additionally,
the following were considered to be possible explanatory
variables: at least one first-degree family member (parent,
sibling, or offspring) having PBC, systemic lupus ery-
thematosus (SLE), arthritis, multiple sclerosis, Raynaud
syndrome, Sjo
¨gren syndrome, scleroderma, polymyositis,
autoimmune thyroid disease, or diabetes mellitus.
We then examined lifestyle candidate variables including
sex, whether the participant had smoked tobacco at some
time in their life, the amount of smoking, and passive expo-
suretosmoke.Passivesmokeexposurewasassessedusingthe
validated instrument of Coghlin et al.16 that includes living
with a smoker in the household, the number of smokers in
the household, the number of hours per day of smoke expo-
sure in the household, exposure to smokers at work, the
number of immediate coworkers who smoked (limited to a
maximum of 10 individuals), the number of hours exposed
to smoke in the workplace per day, other sources of exposure
to smoke, and the number of hours per week of such smoke
exposure. These data were combined into the total number
of hours per week of smoke exposure, and the total number
of10-personhoursperweekofsmokeexposure.Allvariables
on passive smoke exposure were reported at the time of the
interview. Other lifestyle variables included consumption of
at least 120 g of alcohol over the lifetime and the number of
uses per year of hair dye, hair spray, and nail polish.
Finally, multivariable models were developed for re-
productive factors and hormonal medications among
only female cases and controls. Candidate variables re-
garding menstrual history were age at menarche, meno-
pausal status, cause of menopause (natural, surgical,
radiological), usual length of current menstrual cycles,
whether current cycles were long (more than 35 days) or
short (less than 24 days), menstrual cycle and period du-
ration at the age of 20, whether the duration of cycles at
that age varied by more than 4 days. Candidate variables
regarding exogenous estrogen included use of birth con-
trol pills for at least 6 months, and any use of HRT.
Candidate variables concerning fertility were whether the
woman was ever pregnant, the number of pregnancies,
the age at first pregnancy, and failure to become pregnant
after a period of being sexually active in the absence of
birth control measures (a measure of subfertility).
Statistical comparisons were made using SAS software
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). All analyses were two-
sided, and P values of less than .05 were considered sta-
tistically significant. Continous variables are expressed as
mean  standard deviation.

Sociodemographic Characteristics. A total of 1032
of the 1090 (95%) identified patients with PBC agreed to
1196 GERSHWIN ET AL. HEPATOLOGY, November 2005
participate and completed the telephone interview. After
selection by RDD and fulfillment of matching criteria,
1041 controls also agreed to participate in the study. Fig-
ure 1 illustrates the geographical distribution of the PBC
cases enrolled in all states except Delaware and Hawaii.
Cases and controls were similar with respect to sex, age,
and ethnicity (Table 1). Among cases, the mean age at
diagnosis of PBC was 5110 years. Distribution of edu-
cation levels did not differ significantly between cases and
controls. Reported annual household income was signif-
icantly higher in patients with PBC compared to controls.
Personal Clinical History. The most common co-
morbid autoimmune diseases in patients with PBC were
rheumatoid arthritis (10%), Raynaud syndrome (12%),
and Sjo
¨gren syndrome (10%). Table 2 shows that the
prevalence rates for the latter two conditions were 6-20
times higher among cases compared to controls (P 
.0001 for both comparisons). Similarly, significantly
higher prevalence rates of SLE, scleroderma, and autoim-
mune thyroid disease were observed for patients with
PBC compared with controls (P  .0001 for all three
comparisons). In contrast, the frequency of a prior diag-
nosis of rheumatoid arthritis did not differ between pa-
tients (10%) and controls (8%) (P  .129). Compared to
controls, patients with PBC reported significantly higher
prevalence of hypercholesterolemia (58% vs. 46%; P 
.0001) and a history of urinary tract infections (UTI)
(59% vs. 52%; P  .0003). A history of breast cancer was

more frequent among controls than PBC cases (5% vs.
3%), although the difference was not statistically signifi-
cant. Compared to controls, patients with PBC reported
significantly higher rates of tonsillectomy (57% vs. 50%;
P  .0018), cholecystectomy (27% vs. 17%; P  .0001),
and colonic polypectomies (18% vs. 13%; P  .0003).
Family History. Occurrence of PBC in a first-degree
relative was reported by 57/1032 (5.9%) of cases and
5/1041 (0.5%) of controls (P  .0001) (Table 3A). Fa-
milial PBC was reported most frequently by cases in sis-
ters (4.3%) and mothers (1.7%) (P  .001 compared to
controls) (Table 3B). The frequency of SLE, autoimmune
thyroid disease, and Sjo
¨gren syndrome, was also signifi-
cantly increased among relatives of cases compared to rel-
atives of controls but familial rheumatoid arthritis,
Raynaud syndrome, or polymyositis did not differ.
Anthropometric and Lifestyle Factors. PBC cases
reported a significantly lower body weight at the time of
interview than controls (15937 lb vs. 16641 lb; P 
.0006) and a slightly shorter height (643 in vs. 653 in
for controls; P  .0154) (Table 4). A greater proportion
of PBC cases reported a past history of cigarette smoking
(60% vs. 54%; P  .0034), but more controls were active
smokers at the time of the interview (32% vs. 16%; P

.0001). Compared with controls, patients with PBC re-
ported a lesser time of passive smoke in both the work-
place and at home. Lifetime alcohol consumption was
similar in PBC cases and controls (90% of both groups
reported they had consumed at least 120 g of ethanol).
However, only 28% of PBC cases reported having had
that amount in the previous 12 months compared to 50%
of controls (P  .0001). Patients with PBC reported to
use hair dye (3850 times/year vs. 3550; P  .0435) as
well as nail polish (2965 times/year vs. 2253; P 
.0001) more frequently than controls.
Reproductive Factors. Only female cases (n  955)
and controls (n  959) were included in the analysis of
reproductive factors (Table 5). Among female cases and
controls, 47% and 45% reported to be post-menopausal,
respectively. However, patients with PBC were signifi-
cantly more likely than controls to have used HRT in the
past (60% vs. 49%, P  .0001) or currently (62% vs.
47%, P  .0001). More PBC cases than controls reported
prior use of oral contraceptives but the differences were
not statistically significant (75% vs. 71%; P  .0738). A
history of vaginal infection was reported more often by
PBC cases than controls (63% vs. 56%, P  .0018) and
patients with PBC had also experienced more such infec-
tions over their lifetimes (1121 vs. 1022; P  .0755).
Intrauterine devices for birth control were used by 22% of
women with PBC compared to 17% of controls (P 
.0337), but no significant differences were observed in the
prevalence of potential complications such as pelvic in-
flammatory disease. The number of pregnancies did not
differ between cases and controls while women with PBC
were younger at the first pregnancy (22.65 vs. 23.35
years in controls; P  .0105).
Multivariable Results. Factors with statistically sig-
nificant differences in unadjusted bivariate analyses were

and individual history of urinary tract infection (AOR
1.511, 95% CI 1.192-1.915) were significantly associated
with PBC in the multiple logistic regression analyses of
demographic and clinical variables (Table 6). A history of
smoking (AOR 1.569, 95% CI 1.292-1.915), yearly use
of nail polish (per additional application/ year AOR
1.002, 95% CI 1.00-1.003), and history of use of HRT
(AOR 1.548, 95% CI 1.273-1.882) were also found to be
significantly associated with PBC. Never having been
pregnant was significantly associated with protection
from developing PBC (AOR 0.612, 95% CI 0.449-
0.834) (Table 6).
Discussion
Etiological factors leading to the onset of PBC remain
difficult to identify, in part because the disease is generally
diagnosed multiple years or decades after its presumed

onset.17 It is well-established that PBC has a genetic com-
ponent that confers individual susceptibility.5 Prior epi-
demiological and experimental data suggest that
environmental factors might also play an important role
in the pathogenesis of the disease, but the design of these
studies and the size of the cohorts and case finding meth-
ods limited the degree of confidence in the results.7 Our
previous study of risk factors and comorbidities in PBC11
also had some limitations. First, the enrollment of pa-
tients through an Internet-based support group might
have led to an over-representation of patients with higher
education and social status. Second, the use of siblings
and friends as controls may have biased the estimates of
comorbid conditions in patients and their families. De-
spite these limitations, our prior study facilitated the de-
velopment of hypotheses, the design of a more
comprehensive investigative strategy, and the refinement
of the questionnaire.
PBC frequently coexists with other autoimmune dis-
eases that are also more frequently found in family mem-
bers without PBC, although data are often not consistent
across studies.1 Thus, an initial report of an association of
PBC with breast cancer18 was not confirmed by others.19
We are aware of the potential weaknesses of our study
design. The lower participation rate among controls com-
pared to cases might have been associated to the different
distribution of socioeconomic status. As a consequence,
the controls may have been receiving medical attention of
lower frequency and quality. The large number of factors
investigated by statistical testing might also account for
falsely significant associations. Nonetheless, many of the
associations in the multivariable analysis were significant
at P levels considerably lower than .05. Finally, all the
information, except the diagnosis of PBC in enrolled
cases, was obtained from self-reporting and not validated
by record review, which could result in misclassifications,
particularly for comorbidities. Despite these limitations,
we believe that our findings represent the soundest evi-
dence ofassociations yet reported for PBC.
The design of our study included the investigation of
three important types of variables, including demograph-
ics and personal and family history, lifestyle, and repro-
ductive factors in female participants. Each type included,
among others, variables that had been previously sug-
gested as risk factors for PBC, such as familial clustering,6
association with UTI,20 tobacco smoking,11 and estrogen
use.21
We observed that PBC coexists with other autoim-
mune diseases in 32% of cases compared to 13% of con-
trols. Among autoimmune conditions found in PBC
cases, Raynaud syndrome (12%) and Sjo
¨gren syndrome
(10%) were the most frequent, in accordance with previ-
ous reports.22,23 We note that other studies reported
higher prevalence rates but were based on a smaller num-
ber of probably select cases. We found that 27 cases (3%)
with PBC reported a diagnosis of SLE. This is surprising
since only six cases of such an association had been previ-
ously described in the literature.24 Among non-autoim-
mune conditions, we found a high prevalence of
hypercholesterolemia among PBC cases, consistent with
chronic cholestasis and induction of lipoprotein X synthe-
sis and similar to previous reports.25 We also report for the
first time a higher prevalence of hay fever among controls
compared to patients (18% vs. 14%; P  .0113). Our
data did not reveal an association between PBC and breast
cancer, the prevalence of which was not significantly dif-
ferent between cases and controls. Importantly, 59% of
patients with PBC reported a history of UTI compared to
52% of controls, and UTI was independently associated
with PBC in multivariable modeling. This finding sup-
ports the hypothesis that infectious agents may break im-
munological tolerance in PBC.26 Similarly, the increased
prevalence and frequency of vaginal infections among fe-
male cases and the higher rate of tonsillectomy in all pa-
tients with PBC also support this hypothesis. Notably, the
history for UTIs or vaginal infections reported by partic-
ipants was not confirmed with laboratory data, perhaps
because UTIs are often asymptomatic or minimally
symptomatic, especially in women.
The observed rates of autoimmune diseases in relatives
of cases and controls strongly support the hypothesis that
genetic background is crucial in establishing predisposi-
tion to PBC and, possibly, autoimmunity in general. All
of the autoimmune conditions we investigated were re-
ported significantly more often in first-degree relatives of
patients with PBC compared to controls. Notably, 6% of
patients with PBC also reported having a family member
with the disease, most often the mother or a sister, in
accordance with our previous data11 and and more fre-
quently than reported in older studies.7
The analysis of lifestyle factors demonstrated that a
history of smoking and the frequent use of cosmetic prod-
ucts such as nail polish were associated with PBC. How-
ever, the odds ratio for increased frequency of nail polish
use was not impressive and thus this association must be
interpreted with caution. Nonetheless, these data are in-
triguing in view of the xenobiotics hypothesis proposed
for the development PBC with specific halogenated com-
pounds that could increase the immunogenicity of mito-
chondrial proteins9 and able to induce AMA in animal
models.27 An association between PBC and smoking
could also be explained by a possible effect of tobacco
smoke on the T-helper-1 cytokine response28 that is pre-
dominant in PBC.29
1200 GERSHWIN ET AL. HEPATOLOGY, November 2005
A role for estrogens in establishing the female predom-
inance of PBC has been proposed, but supporting evi-
dence is limited.21 Our results indicate that a history of
use of HRT was significantly more frequent among
women with PBC and was also significantly associated
with PBC in the multivariable model. This association is
relevant to the clinical management of PBC, since vari-
able degrees of bone loss, in our study suggested by re-
portedly shorter height of patients with PBC, are
common features of prolonged cholestasis30 that induce
physicians to prescribe HRT.31 We therefore cannot de-
termine whether the more frequent use of hormone re-
placement therapy is a cause or a consequence of having
PBC. However, an altered distribution of estrogen recep-
tors has recently been demonstrated in liver samples of
patients with different stages of PBC.32 Our results also
showed that never having been pregnant was negatively
associated with PBC while we could not confirm the pre-
viously reported high prevalence of menstrual abnormal-
ities in women with PBC.33 The former factor is
consistent with the proposed role for fetal microchimer-
ism in the pathogenesis of autoimmunity,34 despite the
conflicting data reported on this issue.35-37
In conclusion, we report the results of the largest
study to date of risk factors and comorbidities associ-
ated with PBC. Our data support some of the previ-
ously proposed risk factors for PBC, including familial
occurrence, clustering of autoimmunity, smoking, and
history of UTI. However, this large study did not con-
firm other previous reports, such as the increased prev-
alence of breast cancer in women with PBC. We
further identified new putative risk factors (the use of
cosmetic products) and autoimmune conditions (SLE)
associated with PBC. Future efforts should concentrate
on interactions of genetic and environmental factors in
relation to PBC. The former issue should be ap-
proached through the creation of a worldwide database
and collection of samples from patients and family
members and through a genome-wide linkage study,
similar to that recently reported for juvenile rheuma-
toid arthritis.38 The role of identified environmental
risk factors should be investigated in animal studies to
achieve a satisfactory model for the etiology of PBC.
Investigations of putative environmental agents in dif-
ferent genetically inbred mouse strains could uncover
the genetic­environmental interactions leading to the
development of PBC. Only these combined efforts will
provide the solution to the enigma of PBC etiology.
