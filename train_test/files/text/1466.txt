HIGH BODY MASS INDEX (BMI)
among children and ad-
olescents continues to be
a public health concern
in the United States. Children with
high BMI often become obese
adults,1 and obese adults are at risk
for many chronic conditions such as
diabetes, cardiovascular disease,
and certain cancers.2 High BMI in
children may also have immediate
consequences, such as elevated lipid
concentrations and blood pressure.3
Since 1980, the prevalence of BMI
for age at or above the 95th percentile
(sometimes termed "obese") has
tripled among school-age children
and adolescents, and it remains high
at approximately 17%.4-6 However,
the prevalence of BMI for age at or
above the 95th percentile among
children and adolescents showed no
significant changes between 1999
and 2006 for both boys and girls or
among non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, and Mexican Ameri-
can individuals.6
Using data from 2007-2008, this ar-
ticle provides the most recent esti-
mates of high BMI among children and
adolescents aged 2 through 19 years and
high weight for recumbent length
among infants and toddlers. In addi-
tion, trends in prevalence between 1999
and 2008 are analyzed.
METHODS
Analyses are based on data from the
National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES), a
complex, multistage probability
sample of the US civilian, noninstitu-
tionalized population.7 The survey
was conducted by the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics (NCHS) of
the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) and was reviewed
and approved by the NCHS institu-
tional review board. Parents provided
informed written consent for chil-
dren younger than 18 years, and chil-
dren aged 7 years and older provided
assent. Standardized protocols and
calibrated equipment were used to
obtain measurements of height and
weight.

Context The prevalence of high body mass index (BMI) among children and ado-
lescents in the United States appeared to plateau between 1999 and 2006.
Objectives To provide the most recent estimates of high BMI among children and
adolescents and high weight for recumbent length among infants and toddlers and to
analyze trends in prevalence between 1999 and 2008.
Design, Setting, and Participants The National Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey 2007-2008, a representative sample of the US population with measured
heights and weights on 3281 children and adolescents (2 through 19 years of age)
and 719 infants and toddlers (birth to 2 years of age).
Main Outcome Measures Prevalence of high weight for recumbent length (95th
percentile of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention growth charts) among
infants and toddlers. Prevalence of high BMI among children and adolescents defined
at 3 levels: BMI for age at or above the 97th percentile, at or above the 95th percen-
tile, and at or above the 85th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth charts. Analyses
of trends by age, sex, and race/ethnicity from 1999-2000 to 2007-2008.
Results In 2007-2008, 9.5% of infants and toddlers (95% confidence interval [CI],
7.3%-11.7%) were at or above the 95th percentile of the weight-for-recumbent-
length growth charts. Among children and adolescents aged 2 through 19 years, 11.9%
(95% CI, 9.8%-13.9%) were at or above the 97th percentile of the BMI-for-age growth
charts; 16.9% (95% CI, 14.1%-19.6%) were at or above the 95th percentile; and
31.7% (95% CI, 29.2%-34.1%) were at or above the 85th percentile of BMI for age.
Prevalence estimates differed by age and by race/ethnic group. Trend analyses indi-
cate no significant trend between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 except at the highest
BMI cut point (BMI for age 97th percentile) among all 6- through 19-year-old boys
(odds ratio [OR], 1.52; 95% CI, 1.17-2.01) and among non-Hispanic white boys of
the same age (OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.22-2.94).
Conclusion No statistically significant linear trends in high weight for recumbent length
or high BMI were found over the time periods 1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-2004,
2005-2006, and 2007-2008 among girls and boys except among the very heaviest
6- through 19-year-old boys.

Excess weight in infants and tod-
dlers is defined8 as weight at or above
the 95th percentile of the sex-specific
2000 CDC weight-for-recumbent-
length growth charts (which are inde-
pendent of age). Excess weight among
children and adolescents aged 2
through 19 years is defined based on
BMI in relation to the 2000 CDC sex-
specific BMI-for-age growth charts.9
Body mass index is calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in me-
ters squared, rounded to 1 decimal
place.
There have been recent changes in
the nomenclature for specific levels of
high BMI for age in children. In the
1980s and 1990s, expert committees
recommended that children and ado-
lescents aged 2 through 19 years at or
above the 95th percentile of BMI for age
be labeled "overweight" and children
between the 85th and 95th percentiles
be labeled "at risk for overweight."10,11
A more recent expert committee rec-
ommended that these groups of chil-
dren be labeled "obese" and "over-
weight," respectively.12
In this article, we present estimates
for infants and toddlers at or above the
95th percentile of weight for recum-
bent length and for children and ado-
lescents at 3 levels of high BMI: BMI for
age at or above the 97th, at or above the
95th, and at or above the 85th percen-
tiles. For children and adolescents, be-
cause of recent changes in terminol-
ogy and because we present an estimate
for at or above the 97th percentile,
which does not have a recommended
label, we use the phrase "high BMI" to
refer to all 3 BMI-for-age cut points. Be-
cause the 95th percentiles of BMI for
age among 18- and 19-year-old fe-
males and 19-year-old males are above
30, a teenager could be considered
obese by the adult definition but not
have a high BMI based on the 95th per-
centile of BMI for age. Consequently,
the percentage of adolescents (12-19
years of age) at or above the adult defi-
nition of obesity (BMI 30)2 was also
estimated.
Participants reported their race and
ethnicity after being shown a list that
included an open-ended response. Par-
ticipants aged 16 years and older
reported their own race and ethnicity,
and for children younger than 16 years,
a family member reported race and
ethnicity.Forthepurposesofthisanaly-
sis, race/ethnic groups were catego-
rized as non-Hispanic white, non-
Hispanic black, total Hispanic, and
Mexican American. Prevalence esti-
mates are shown for both total His-
panic individuals and Mexican Ameri-
can individuals. Mexican American
individuals have been oversampled
since1999-2000,sotrendanalyseswere
performedonthetotalpopulation,non-
Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
and Mexican American race/ethnic
groups.TotalHispanicindividualswere
not oversampled prior to 2007-2008.
Analyses of the total population
included an "other" group of primar-
ily Asian individuals, but this group did

lyzed separately.
Examination response rates for
NHANES 2007-2008 were similar to
prior surveys.4-6,13 In 2007-2008, the
overall unweighted examination
response rate for children and adoles-
centswas82.1%,calculatedasthenum-
ber of examined children and adoles-
cents divided by the total number
selected to participate in the sample.
Lessthan1%ofexaminedchildrenwere
excluded from the analysis because of
missing data for weight or height (or
recumbent length for children younger
than 2 years). This report includes data
for3281childrenandadolescents(2-19
years of age) and 719 infants and tod-
dlers(birthto2yearsofage)from2007-
2008. The sample size is smaller than
that in 2005-2006 (n=4207) because
adolescents were oversampled only in
NHANES 1999-2006.
NHANES was designed to detect a
10% difference between proportions
with 80% power, a design effect of 1.5,
and a sample size of approximately 420.
To test for smaller differences with the
same power, a larger sample size is
needed. For example, to test a change
from 15% to 10% (a 5% difference) re-
quires a sample size of approximately
1150. Because trend analyses combine
several time periods, the statistical test
for trends requires fewer sample per-
sons per time period. Sufficient power
exists when combining the survey pe-
riods to detect a change of 5%.
Statistical analyses were done using
SAS (version 9.2; SAS Institute Inc,
Cary, North Carolina) and SUDAAN
(version 10; Research Triangle Insti-
tute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina). All analyses excluded preg-
nant females. Sample weights were used
to account for differential nonre-
sponse and noncoverage and to adjust
for planned oversampling of some
groups. Standard errors were esti-
mated with SUDAAN using Taylor se-
ries linearization, a design-based ap-
proach. Differences between age groups
and race/ethnic groups were tested
using logistic regression models. Be-
cause significant interactions were
found between sex and race/ethnic
group, sex-specific models were run.
Overall and within each race/ethnic
group, differences by sex were tested
using t tests with a Bonferroni correc-
tion based on 4 comparisons (4 race/
ethnic groups); thus, a P value of .05
divided by 4, .0125, is considered sig-
nificant.
Linear trends were tested over 5 time
periods (1999-2000, 2001-2002, 2003-
2004, 2005-2006, and 2007-2008)
using time period as both a continu-
ous and a categorical variable in logis-
tic regression models. Time period was
analyzed as a categorical variable to ex-
amine the possibility that 1 or 2 time
periods were leading to any differ-
ences that were found significant when
time period was analyzed as a continu-
ous variable. Odds ratios (ORs) asso-
ciated with the trends and P values for
the Satterthwaite adjusted F statistic
from models that contain time period
as a continuous variable are presented
in the text. A Bonferroni correction was
made based on 6 different compari-
sons (2 sexes and 3 race/ethnic groups);
thus, a P value of .05 divided by 6, .008,
is considered significant.
Analysis of trends was slightly dif-
ferent for different age groups given dif-

groups. Sex-specific trend analyses were
done separately for infants and chil-
dren aged from birth to 2 years and for
preschool children aged 2 through 5
years, based on multiple logistic regres-
sion models adjusted for race/
ethnicity. Preliminary analyses showed
no difference in prevalence between the
6- through 11-year-old and 12- through
19-year-old age groups, which is con-
sistent with previous NHANES stud-
ies. Consequently, we combined these

ages to obtain a larger sample size and
allow for separate trend analyses for
each sex and race/ethnic subgroup. For
all analyses of children and adoles-
cents aged 2 through 19 years, trend
analyses were conducted on 3 mutu-
ally exclusive BMI groups: greater than
or equal to the 97th percentile of BMI
for age, less than the 97th percentile but
greater than or equal to the 95th per-
centile, and less than the 95th percen-
tile but greater than or equal to the 85th
percentile of BMI for age. Alternative
analyses on overlapping groups would
represent dependent trend tests and
were less efficient. Prevalence esti-
mates shown in tables and figures are
shown for each BMI cut point cumu-
latively (eg, BMI for age 85th, 95th,
and 97th percentiles) because they
represent the usual custom. For graphi-
cal comparisons of BMI, the fre-
quency distributions of BMI from 1999-
2000 and 2007-2008 were smoothed
using a nonparametric smoothing al-
gorithm, based on sequential calcula-
tions of running medians for groups of
adjacent points.14 This algorithm es-
sentially draws a line through a histo-
gram.
RESULTS
Unweighted sample sizes for NHANES
2007-2008 by age, race/ethnicity, and
sex are shown in the eTable (available
at http://www.jama.com).
Detailed prevalence estimates of high
weight for recumbent length among in-
fants and toddlers in 2007-2008 are
shown in TABLE 1. Approximately 10%
(9.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI],
7.3%-11.7%) of infants and toddlers
younger than 2 years were at or above
the 95th percentile of the weight-for-
recumbent-length growth charts. Simi-
larly, detailed estimates for children and
adolescents aged 2 through 19 years are
found in TABLE 2. In this age group,
11.9% (95% CI, 9.8%-13.9%) were at
or above the 97th percentile, 16.9%
(95% CI, 14.1%-19.6%) were at or
above the 95th percentile, and 31.7%
(95% CI, 29.2%-34.1%) were at or
above the 85th percentile of BMI for age.

lescents were at or above the 95th per-
centile of BMI for age. Based on the
adult definition of obesity (BMI 30),
in 2007-2008, 12.6% (95% CI, 9.0%-
16.2%) of adolescents aged 12 through
19 years were obese.
Overall, among 2- through 19-year-
old children and teens, there were no
statisticallysignificantdifferencesbysex
at the 3 different BMI cut points. How-
ever, among Mexican American chil-
drenandadolescentsaged2through19
years, boys were more likely than girls
to have high BMI (using all 3 BMI cut
points) (97th percentile, P=.003;
95th percentile, P=.003; 85th per-
centile, P=.01). Among all Hispanic
individuals aged 2 through 19 years,
boys were more likely to be at or above
the 95th percentile of BMI for age
(P=.002). Differences by sex among
Hispanicswerenotsignificantusingthe
other 2 BMI cut points. There were no
significant differences among non-
Hispanic white or non-Hispanic black
individuals.
Significant differences in preva-
lence of high BMI among US children
aged 2 through 19 years continued to
exist between age groups and race/
ethnic groups at each of the 3 BMI cut
points. Logistic regression model re-
sults based on data from 2007-2008
(TABLE 3) indicated that Hispanic boys
had significantly higher odds of hav-
ing high BMI at all 3 BMI cut points
compared with non-Hispanic white
boys (97th percentile, OR, 1.72; 95%
CI, 1.13-2.63; 95th percentile, OR,
1.80; 95% CI, 1.26-2.58; and 85th
percentile, OR, 1.65; 95% CI, 1.14-
2.38), but there was no statistically sig-
nificant difference between non-
Hispanic white and non-Hispanic black
individuals. Among girls, non-
Hispanic black girls were significantly
more likely than non-Hispanic white
girls to have high BMI at all 3 BMI cut
points (97th percentile, OR, 1.77;
95% CI, 1.09-2.88; 95th percentile,
OR,1.70;95%CI,1.07-2.71;and85th
percentile, OR, 1.58; 95% CI, 1.13-
2.20), but there was no difference
between Hispanic girls and non-
Hispanic white girls.
In addition, preschool boys (aged 2-5
years) had significantly lower odds of
having high BMI at all 3 BMI cut points
compared with adolescents (aged 12-19
years)(97thpercentile,OR,0.36;95%
CI, 0.23-0.57; 95th percentile, OR,
0.45; 95% CI, 0.30-0.68; and 85th
percentile OR, 0.48; 95% CI, 0.36-
0.65). Among girls, preschool chil-
dren had lower odds of having BMI at
or above the 95th percentile (OR, 0.60;
95% CI, 0.38-0.97) or BMI at or above
the 85th percentile (OR, 0.55; 95% CI,
0.38-0.78) compared with adoles-
cents. There was no significant differ-
ence in prevalence of high BMI at any
BMI cut point between elementary
school children (aged 6-11 years) and
adolescents (aged 12-19 years).
Trends in high weight for recum-
bent length among infants and tod-
dlers from birth to 2 years of age are
shown in FIGURE 1 for boys and girls
separately. No statistically significant
linear trends were found for either boys
or girls after adjusting for race/
ethnicity (P.99 and P=.56, respec-
tively). Analysis of sex-specific trends
between 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 for
2- through 5-year-old preschool chil-
dren were not statistically significant at
any mutually exclusive BMI level (P val-
ues between .15 and .73) after adjust-
ing for race/ethnicity. FIGURE 2 con-
tains observed trend estimates at the 3
BMI cut points (cumulative catego-
ries) for both boys and girls aged 2

tistically significant linear trend only for
boys at or above the 97th percentile for
the total population (OR, 1.52; 95% CI,
1.17-2.01; P  .004) and for non-
Hispanic white boys (OR, 1.87; 95% CI,
1.22-2.94; P.005). Trends were not
statistically significant for any group
using the other mutually exclusive BMI
percentile categories (P values be-
tween .05 and .82). Among girls, no test
for trends was statistically significant
(P values between .08 and .39). Analy-
sis of trends with time period as a cat-
egorical variable indicated that the only
significant difference in prevalence was
among boys between the 2 time peri-
ods 1999-2000 and 2007-2008 at the
97th percentile of BMI for age. FIGURE 3
shows trends in high BMI among 6-
through 19-year-old boys and girls at
the 3 BMI cut points (cumulative cat-
egories). Trend tests on cumulative cat-
egories (85th and 95th percen-
tiles) showed the same results as the test
on the mutually exclusive BMI catego-
ries between the 85th and 95th percen-
tiles and between the 95th and 97th
percentiles.
To further investigate the change in
BMI between 1999-2000 and 2007-
2008, FIGURE 4 and FIGURE 5 show the
smoothed distribution of BMI among
school children aged 6 through 11 years
and adolescents aged 12 through 19
years in 1999-2000 compared with
2007-2008 for both boys and girls.
These graphs show the change in BMI
distribution of the entire population of
boys and girls. The curves were done
separately by age group (and not for the
6- through 19-year-old group to-
gether) because BMI varies by age and
a BMI of 15 in a 6-year-old is very dif-
ferent from a BMI of 15 in a 19-year-
old. Combining the groups would re-
sult in confounding. In boys aged 6
through 11 years and 12 through 19
years, there appeared to be a change in
thedistributionbetween1999-2000and
2007-2008. In boys, the BMI distribu-
tion appeared more skewed in 2007-
2008 compared with 1999-2000, which
is consistent with the increase in preva-
lence above the 97th percentile. For
girls aged 6 through 11 years, there ap-
peared to be a slight change in the dis-
tribution, but this was not reflected in
any significant change in prevalence of
high BMI. Among 12- through 19-year-
old girls, the BMI distributions ap-
peared to be virtually identical in 1999-
2000 and 2007-2008.
COMMENT
In 2007-2008, approximately 10% of
infants and toddlers younger than 2
years were at or above the 95th per-
centile of the weight-for-recumbent-
length growth charts. Almost 12% of
2- through 19-year-old children and
adolescents were at or above the 97th
percentile of the BMI-for-age growth
charts while almost 17% were at or
above the 95th percentile and almost
32% were at or above the 85th percen-
tile. No statistically significant linear
trends in weight for length or high BMI
for any cut point were found over the
time periods 1999-2000, 2001-2002,
2003-2004, 2005-2006, and 2007-
2008 among girls of any age.
Among 6- through 19-year-old boys,
however, there was a significant linear
trend at the highest BMI cut point (BMI
for age 97th percentile) but not at the
lower cut points, nor was there a sig-
nificant trend in the younger age
groups. The categorical analysis of sur-
vey period suggests that among 6-
through 19-year-old boys the differ-
ence is only significant between the 2
time periods 1999-2000 and 2007-
2008, so it not possible to tell if the
2007-2008 estimate is the continua-
tion of a trend or not.

2007-2008 found in girls and possibly
in boys at lower BMI cut points has also
been recorded in other data systems, al-
though these systems employ differ-
ent methods than NHANES. In the Pe-
diatric Nutrition Surveillance System
(PedNSS), based on children aged 0 to
5 years from low-income families who
participate in federal nutrition pro-
grams, no changes in prevalence were
found between 2003 and 2008.15 In ad-
dition, a nationally representative
school-based survey of high school stu-
dents, the Youth Risk Behavior Surveil-
lance System (YRBS),16,17 found a pla-
teau between 2005 and 2007 among
grades 9 through 12, although the 2007
estimate of approximately 13% based
on self-reported data in the YRBS is
lower than the 18.1% found here among
12- through 19-year-old adolescents.
The possible increase in BMI at or
above the 97th percentile and the in-
creasing skewness in the distribution
among boys is consistent with data for
men, which suggest a slight but statis-
tically significant increase in obesity be-
tween 1999 and 2006.18
Differences in prevalence and in
trends between boys and girls have been
reported in other countries. Similar to
the results among Hispanic individu-
als seen here, the prevalence of obe-
sity (BMI for age 95th percentile) is
significantly higher among boys than
among girls in Mexico.19 Moreover, a
leveling off of childhood obesity trends
has been documented in Stockholm,
where there was a marginally signifi-
cant difference in obesity trends in girls
vs boys. The decrease in prevalence was
greater in girls than in boys.20 In En-
gland, an analysis of 3-year moving av-
erages of obesity prevalence suggests
that the trend in obesity may be level-
ing off in the most recent 3 years
(2005-2007).21 The only exception was
among girls (but not boys), where there
was a significant decrease in preva-
lence of obesity between 2005 and 2006
among 2- through 15-year-olds. Look-
ing back to 1995, there was an in-
crease in obesity prevalence from 13.5%
in 1995 to 17.6% in 2007 among 11-
through 15-year-old boys while there
was no significant increase among
girls of the same age. In 2007, there was
no difference in prevalence between
boys and girls,21 suggesting boys have
"caught up" with girls. Because preva-
lence estimates are relative to sex-
specific distributions from the past (eg,
the BMI-for-age CDC growth charts
based on data from the 1960s and
1970s), it is possible that there were dif-
ferences between boys and girls in the
1960s and 1970s that are reflected in
sex differences in prevalence seen to-
day.
Interpreting the prevalence of high
BMI requires some caveats. Body mass
index does not measure adiposity di-
rectly. In children, BMI is correlated
with adiposity and that correlation is
higher at higher levels of BMI for age
than at lower levels of BMI for age.
Moreover, there are differences in adi-
posity between black and white indi-
viduals at the same BMI level.22 Be-
cause BMI varies by age and sex in
children, cut points relate to a refer-
ence population, in this case the CDC
growth charts. These cut points are sta-
tistical and are not based on health out-
comes.23
There are currently many efforts un-
der way aimed at preventing childhood
obesity. Funded research on interven-
tions related to school food and physi-
cal activity environments, taxes, food
marketing, and physical environment
(for example, park characteristics in ur-
ban environments) have shown some
promise.24 Moreover, the Task Force on
CommunityPreventiveServices'system-
aticreviewofbehavioralinterventionsre-
lated to obesity found that interven-
tions aimed at reducing screen time had
sufficientevidenceofeffectivenessforre-
ducing measured screen time and im-
proving weight-related outcomes.25 But
the results presented here indicate that
the prevalence of high BMI in child-
hood has remained steady for 10 years
and has not declined. Moreover, the
