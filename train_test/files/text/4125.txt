Introduction
This article is, at its deepest level, about the interaction
between children and young people's play and systems of
management. At first sight, it might well appear that no inter-
action should be expected between such unlikely bed fellows
as these, particularly as play has been characterized as behav-
ior that typically involves children directing their own
actions, and engaging actively, flexibly, and adaptively with
uncertain and unpredictable situations (Lester & Russell,
2008) and thus, apparently, the antithesis of a managed activ-
ity. However, there is growing realization, from disparate
walks of life ranging, for example, from outdoor adventure
activities to education, health care, and even urban arboricul-
ture, that seemingly remote management systems can have
subtle and unintended consequences on public life, which
may detract from the achievement of socially desired goals
(e.g., Ball & Ball-King, 2011, 2013; Graham & Wiener,
1995). A reason for this may be that modern management
systems continue at times to be overly reliant on methodolo-
gies derived from systems engineering.
It is undeniable that systems engineering approaches,
as pioneered in the United States by Bell Laboratories,
have been stunningly effective in dealing with immensely
complex engineering problems of the type encountered,
for example, in the National Aeronautics and Space
Administration's 1960s Apollo program (Weigel, 2000).
In that case, they enabled hundreds of agencies to work
together on that intricate project and then to recombine their
efforts into a working whole. However, systems engineering
approaches have been less successful when applied to
social issues. As Checkland and Poulter (2006, p. xi) have
expressed,

Children's Play Space and Safety
Management: Rethinking the Role of Play
Equipment Standards

Abstract
The provision of stimulating and engaging play space for children and young people is increasingly recognized as an important
societal goal, not the least because it provides the young with opportunities to develop and gain experience in experimenting
with risk. Research in several disciplines now suggests that achievement of this goal has however been impeded in recent
decades, and reasons commonly cited have included fear of injury and avoidance of litigation. International standards on play
equipment have also been promulgated and justified in terms of securing young people's "safety," most usually narrowly
defined as injury reduction. There appears to be a widespread presumption that measures aimed at injury prevention are
necessarily beneficial overall for young people's welfare. In this article, we subject European standards for play equipment
and surfacing to scrutiny. In particular, we examine underlying motives, consistency of purpose, use of evidence, philosophical
leanings, scope, practicalities of application, systems of management, and legal ramifications. From this, we identify a number
of fundamental issues that suggest that as a consequence of compartmentalized thinking and misunderstandings, these
standards have invaded areas of decision making beyond their legitimate territory. The consequence of this is that play
provision is skewed away from what are properly play provision objectives. In such circumstances, local decision makers are
often disempowered, and their ability to provide optimal play spaces thereby circumscribed.

In the event, the pattern of activity found in Systems
Engineering--namely, precisely define a need and then engineer
a system to meet that need using various techniques--was
simply not rich enough to deal with the buzzing complexity and
confusion of management situations.
Similar issues, over the "richness" of management sys-
tems, have emerged yet more widely still, for example, in the
finance sector over the risk management activity referred to
as "internal control." As Power (2004) has put it,
Internal control systems are also highly problematic. Not only is
it difficult to define their effectiveness, but, more crucially, a
growing obsession with internal control may itself be a source of
risk. First, internal control systems are organizational projections
of controllability which may be misplaced; such systems are
only as good as the imaginations of those who designed them.
Second, internal control systems are essentially inward-looking
and may embody mistaken assumptions of what the public
really wants reassurance about (p. 28).
In this article, we examine how a management system,
whose primary interests are safety and free trade, has affected
the provision of play spaces in ways that, we believe, also
bear the hallmarks of the "richness" and "internal control"
syndromes. Although, paradoxically, play is supposedly to
be freely chosen, provision for play has in recent decades
become highly managed with numerous actors having an
involvement. These include equipment manufacturers, trade
associations, designers, providers, procurers, standards set-
ters, insurers, inspectors, the courts (via litigation), policy
makers, play workers, parents, and the young, each with their
own agenda.
We are here particularly interested in the role of equip-
ment standards and in unintended consequences arising from
them. Equipment standards are used by many of these actors
for a variety of purposes, often without any questions being
asked. Thus, standards may assume an overwhelming pres-
ence, essentially dictating what will eventuate. Our ability to
address these issues is based on our collective immersion,
over several decades, within the play sector. This includes
participation in standards setting, equipment design and
manufacture, play space design, play policy, litigation, and
academic research.
Current Dilemmas of Play
There is an upsurge in the recognition of the value and impor-
tance of outdoor play for children and young people and on
ways to give them better play opportunities (National
Children's Bureau, 2013). One reason for this is the realiza-
tion that, through play, humans gain some of their first expo-
sures to risk and this is where they learn how to cope with it
at the personal level. As a 2012 high level statement from the
Health and Safety Executive (HSE)--the United Kingdom's
safety regulator--has put it,
Play brings the world to life for children. It provides for an
exploration and understanding of their abilities; helps them to
learn and develop; and exposes them to the realities of the world
in which they will live, which is a world not free from risk but
rather one where risk is ever present. The opportunity for play
develops a child's risk awareness and prepares them for their
future lives.
From our perspective, this new awareness was predictable
and is welcome, for there are by now copious reports,
research papers, and media statements warning that children
and young people have in some societies been deprived of
essential developmental experiences for several decades and
that corrective action is urgently required (Bundy et al.,
2009; Guldberg, 2009; Jones, 2006; Louv, 2005; Play Safety
Forum, 2002; Sandseter & Kennair, 2011). Multiple explana-
tions have been offered as to why the situation deteriorated
as it did. These range over political, economic, legal, and
social factors. In this article, we focus on the role and use of
former British and now international playground safety stan-
dards, particularly European standards such as EN1176 and
1177 promulgated by Comité Européen de Normalisation
(CEN), the European Committee for Standardization (CEN,
2008a, 2008b). These standards are very important for some
of the actors involved in play provision, manufacturers obvi-
ously, but also other actors who may deploy them for reasons
other than those for which they were designed, for example,
avoidance of liability.
It has also been argued that in general standards of what-
ever kind may bring about undesirable changes in society
(MacRae, 2011). As argued by MacRae, they may promote
the economic interests of particular groups, may contribute
to excessive rule observance and disproportionate regulatory
activity, can lead to non-optimal resource allocation, and
may even encroach on civil liberties. In partial recognition,
perhaps, of these difficulties, recently promulgated interna-
tional standards even delve into the principles of risk man-
agement itself. Thus, the International Organization for
Standardization's publication ISO 31000 (2009) refers to the
importance of context, risk attitudes, and the need to align
culture with policy.
As noted, our emphasis here is on European standards.
However, we are aware that similar research has been
reported in North America on Canadian standards for play
equipment (Herrington & Nicholls, 2007). Likewise, there is
also concern more widely, from continental Europe to the
Antipodes, about what has been described as a narrow focus
by standards on one issue, physical injury, at the apparent
expense of a host of other dangers that potentially come as a
result of modifying or otherwise restricting active play
(Bundy et al., 2009; Christensen & Mikkelsen, 2008). The
tendency, both in the text of the standards and in playground
inspection reports, to treat "safety" and "injury prevention"
as self-evident correlates reinforces this narrowing of view.
To put it simply, standards themselves ostensibly focus on
Spiegal et al. 3
injury reduction and make scant reference to other issues of
obvious importance, such as the health benefits of play and
also opportunities to learn about risk. To deploy Checkland
and Poulter's (2006) terminology, they lack richness, or
Power's (2004) concept of internal control, they are too
inward-looking and embody mistaken assumptions about
what is needed.
In this article, we now discuss the ways in which these par-
ticular standards have been interpreted by various actors. Prior
to doing this, it is necessary to examine a number of features
and practical manifestations of how standards interact with the
wider play community. This is achieved under the following
headings: the evidence base that standards draw on, their
ethos, their scope, and finally, their application during play
inspections and as manifest in legal proceedings.
Examples of the Use of Scientific
Evidence
Academic research ideally provides the evidence that under-
pins the design of interventions including those intended to
increase safety. However, it is well-known that the commu-
nication and transfer of the meaning of research to end-users
is a path with many potential pitfalls, even to the extent that
"science communication" has become a topic of research in
its own right. Thus, Herrington and Nicholls (2007) described
how, in the 1970s and 1980s, lobbyists for Canadian play-
ground standards apparently failed to take account of
Canadian studies that showed that injury levels on play-
grounds were not significantly high and misapplied injury
data from the American Consumer Product Safety
Commission. They speculated that this may have been done
to fulfill primary objectives of the Canadian Standards
Association (CSA; 2003), which were to "foster and promote
voluntary standardization as a means of advancing the
national economy" and to "facilitate domestic and interna-
tional trade." Rational though of course these objectives are
from a commercial perspective, they may not be synony-
mous with providing the best developmental opportunities
for children and young people.
Some similarities with this situation, as described, can be
observed in not-so-distant British play equipment standards.
These earlier British standards are relevant because they
went on to influence subsequent European standards. For
example, British Standard BS 5696-2: 1979 and its 1986 ver-
sion both claim that only limited data were available on play-
ground accidents, thus requiring the standards Committee to
"adopt a reasonable attitude in writing the recommendations
for minimizing" the risks (British Standards Institution
[BSI], 1979, 1986). Two points can be made about this. First,
there were in fact statistics available by the early 1980s that,
had the Committee looked, would have shown, as in Canada,
that injury rates were low (these studies were identified in
subsequent reviews; Ball, 1991; King & Ball, 1989). Second,
the committee refers to "minimizing" risks. This is a particu-
lar view of injury control that is not universally shared. At
the national level, risk minimization is not the normal goal
and never has been, except in special circumstances. For
example, the legal requirement in Britain is to do what is
reasonable (or reasonably practicable) as set out in the Health
and Safety at Work etc Act of 1974 (The National Archives,
2013a) and the Occupiers' Liability Acts of 1957 and 1984
(The National Archives, 2013b, 2013c), and is a fundamental
principle of risk management.1
These early British standards also contain other indicators
of thought processes along with an apparently less than rig-
orous approach to evidence. For example, BS 7188: 1989,
which was about the use of impact absorbing surfacing (IAS)
in playgrounds, states in the Foreword that "Studies of acci-
dents have shown that the majority of the more serious cases
involve head injuries caused through striking hard ground"
(BSI, 1989). This bold statement is attributed in the standard
to a 1975 article by Illingworth and colleagues, which had
been published in the British Medical Journal (Illingworth,
Brennan, Jay, Al-Rawi, & Collick, 1975). This is important
because it was apparently on the strength of this evidence
that BS 7188 went on to recommend the use of impact
absorbing materials in playgrounds, a recommendation that
subsequently had major implications for the design, specifi-
cation, and also cost of play provision.
However, careful scrutiny of the Illingworth article
reveals some disconcerting facts. First, the article is about a
sample of 200 injuries caused by playground accidents. Of
these, just 49% occurred on a park or similar playground as
opposed to a school playground or at home, suggesting that
less than 100 cases were used to justify what eventually
turned out to be a billion dollar activity of fitting park play-
grounds with impact absorbing surfaces. As the article itself
states, "To draw meaningful conclusions about the relation
of the severity of the accident to the type of play equipment
greater numbers would be needed." More disturbing still is
that the article in no way supports the British Standards
Committee's then contention that "Studies of accidents have
shown that the majority of the more serious cases involve
head injuries caused through striking hard ground." The arti-
cle in fact barely alludes to surfaces, and the majority of
cases described were of minor injury. Of the few cases judged
serious, 15 in total, most involved limb injuries and not the
head, and IAS as then conceived were not designed to deal
with limb injuries. Those cases, circa 6, which did involve
the head, were attributed to a variety of causes including col-
lisions with persons or objects (such as swing seats or fixed
equipment), collapsing equipment, childhood behavior, or
were unassigned.
Subsequent to the recommendations of BS 7188 on IAS,
further research has been reported seeking retrospective jus-
tification for these products as well as for the more rigorous
imposition of standards. Some of this has been reviewed
elsewhere up to 2002 (Ball, 2002), and more material has
4 SAGE Open
been published since then by authors such as Norton, Nixon,
and Sibert (2004) and Norton, Rolfe, et al. (2004). However,
missing links persist in the chain from academic research on
interventions aimed at fostering safety from injury, to their
actual net benefit in the real world of children's play. For
example, has the massive expenditure on IAS passed the test
of resources well used? What have been the subtle conse-
quences of placing children and young people in artificial
environments when, arguably, they need to gain experience
of the real world? What have been the consequences for the
overall design of play environments? These basic questions
continue to receive little more than superficial attention in
much research on injury prevention.
Ethos and Perspective
Another fundamental issue regarding standards revolves
around their ethos. In general terms, standards are primarily
made for economic reasons. Despite, in some cases, setting
safety requirements, they are the vehicles for ensuring free
movement of goods between states. CEN's own guide to the
process states that, "European Standardization's objective is
to agree on common specifications to respond to the needs of
industry, meet consumer expectations and contribute to the
consolidation of the European Single Market" (CEN and
CENELEC [European Committee for Electrotechnical
Standardization], 2010, 2012).
The technical committees that draft standards at a European
level are made up of delegations from national standards bod-
ies that, by virtue of the above and the fact that delegates are
self-financing, are industry dominated. In our experience,
among their motivations are, first, removal of barriers to trade,
and second, ensuring the resulting standard is as near as pos-
sible to each delegation's national standard, thus avoiding the
expense of changes for home manufacturers.
The process is essentially one of harmonization, and it
would be a mistake to assume it necessarily addresses the
specific issues that might be of relevance to a user. Its intent
is more to bring dissimilar national standards together to iron
out differences. In this way, harmonization is defined by
CEN as, "prevention or elimination of differences in the
technical content of (national) standards having the same
scope, particularly those differences that may cause hin-
drances to trade" (CEN and CENELEC, 2010, 2012).
In terms of matters specific to the play equipment and
surfacing standards, we draw attention to the fact that in
the 1998 version of BS EN1176-1, it says in the section
headed Scope that "It is not the purpose of this standard to
encompass the play value." Were this statement true, it
would imply that the committee was concerned with risk
minimization without reference to the benefits or "play
value" of play provision. If so, this could well explain in
some degree the emasculation of children and young peo-
ple's play experiences over several decades. Intriguingly,
this position has been adjusted in the Introduction to the
latest version of BS EN1176-1 that opens with the state-
ment that "It is not the purpose of the requirements of this
standard to lessen the contribution that playground equip-
ment makes to child development and/or play, which is
meaningful from an educational point of view" (BSI,
2008). It then goes on to state that "Play provision should
aim at managing the balance between the need to offer
risk and the need to keep children safe from serious harm."
Although this is radically different from the former
position--which allegedly does not encompass play value
or recognize the benefits of risk exposure--the standard
itself has changed rather little in content. This is surpris-
ing with such an apparent shift in philosophy.
What is also missing is any acknowledgment of the source
of this sea change. In fact, this is almost certainly attributable
to the work of the United Kingdom's Play Safety Forum
(PSF), in particular its 2002 Position Statement which
observed that there was growing concern about how safety
was being addressed in play provision and that a focus on
injury risk minimization had prevented children and young
people from enjoying healthy play opportunities with poten-
tially damaging consequences for their development.
It could be argued, of course, that the PSF is just another
interest group with different goals. However, the PSF's
membership--which takes in four national agencies involved
in promoting play,2 a body involved in playwork training, a
leading inclusive play provider, and several accident preven-
tion charities, as well as representatives from play equipment
manufacturers and standard-setting bodies--arguably brings
in a broader and more balanced set of perspectives than, for
instance, the EN Standards Committee. Moreover, the PSF's
position is backed by substantial research, the volume of
which increases year by year. Included in this would be a
2002 review commissioned and published by the HSE (Ball,
2002).
More recently, multiple authors from around the world
have published on the benefits of play and the need for risk-
taking experiences by children and young people. In particu-
lar, there has been a sharp growth in research from a
psycho-social perspective. This avenue of investigation con-
trasts with that of the engineering-cum-medical approach
that appears to conform with the model followed by the
Standards Committee. First, it takes on board behavioral fac-
tors in the causation of playground injuries. This is important
because it remains the case that most playground accidents
are behavior-related and hence difficult to solve through
environmental (engineering) strategies alone (Ball, 2002).
Second, these approaches open the door to the overt consid-
eration of the benefits of play and of risk taking, something
frequently lacking in the engineering-cum-medical way of
thinking which is more narrowly focused on injury
reduction.
In particular, a suite of articles by Morrongiello and col-
leagues explores the psychology of childhood risk taking.
One motivation for this inquiry is,
Spiegal et al. 5
Many injury-prevention specialists believe that playground
safety can best be realized by advocating for changes in
environmental design and product safety standards. The
simplicity of this approach is appealing. However, to the extent
that children's behaviours also create risk, environmental
modifications to playgrounds are not likely to be sufficient to
prevent injury. (Morrongiello & Matheis, 2007, p. 827)
And another is,
. . . use of safety gear may result in mis-perceptions of injury risk
and this can produce unwanted effects. Specifically, individuals
may assume that safety gear completely protects against all
injury, and therefore the need to be cautious no longer exists,
resulting in greater risk taking or increased tolerance for risk
taking. (Morrongiello, Walpole, & Lassenby, 2007, p. 619)
This phenomenon, commonly referred to as risk compen-
sation, has been a bone of contention for decades within pub-
lic safety in general. This is not because of any lack of
evidence for its existence--it can be seen in many pursuits,
from cycling (Adams & Hillman, 2001) to mountaineering
(Tejada-Flores, 1967). It is a controversial idea perhaps
because it poses difficult questions for those who are com-
mitted to pursuing risk reduction by environmental means.
However, it could still have been argued that risk compensa-
tion was an adult phenomenon and that it did not apply to
children, but not anymore. Morrongiello, Walpole, and
Lasenby (2007) have provided clear evidence that children
(7-12 years of age) do increase their propensity to take risks
when in situations that appear safer. Furthermore, this behav-
ior arises because children see themselves as invulnerable
from serious injury in apparently protective settings
(Morrongiello, Lassenby, & Walpole, 2007), and because
parents themselves become more relaxed about childhood
risk taking (Morrongiello & Major, 2002). There is in fact a
long history of such adult behavior with regard to children in
their care in wider social settings (Viscusi, 1992). From this,
it would appear that harboring the belief that safety can be
achieved by environmental modifications alone is a false
philosophy.
Christensen and Mikkelsen (2008, p. 113), writing about
risk in play from a sociological perspective, further rein-
forced doubts about the wholesale application of the envi-
ronmental approach to reducing risk. Like Morrongiello,
they believe that the application of risk management as a
"professional-technical function" is problematic in the con-
text of everyday public life. They also go beyond this to chal-
lenge the concept of risk elimination, quoting Malaby (2002):
Any view that begins with the assumption that risk is dangerous
(and should be minimized/avoided) must be questioned . . . it is
through the engagement of indeterminacies, rather than their
minimization or resolution . . . that one may socially demonstrate
one's place vis-à-vis chance, and, by extension, one's place in
relation to others in the world.
Why, in the case of children and young people, might this
be pertinent? As Christensen and Mikkelsen (2008, p. 113)
said, again drawing on Malaby (2002), it can be posited that
everyday life is characterized by uncertainty (risk), of which
one may discern three basic kinds:
·
· performance indeterminacy, that is, in attempting to
do something you may fail
·
· social indeterminacy, that is, interacting with others
may lead to misunderstanding
·
· cosmological indeterminacy, that is, dealing with
unanticipated events
These are uncertainties that children experience every day
through immersion in the world. Being in this world enables
them to learn how to deal with uncertainty and is in fact the
only practical way in which they can learn many coping
mechanisms. Consequently, attempting to engineer a risk-
free world pushes children (and parents) into a Disneyesque
situation in which uncertainty is supposed not to occur. Not
only is this a deception, for none of the measures is totally
protective, but as Greening et al. say, it results in children
having a lack of experience and being desensitized to poten-
tial health risks (Greening, Stoppelbein, Chandler, & Elkin,
2005).
There is a long-standing view that children need to
encounter risks to develop and participate actively in society
(Roberts, Smith, & Bryce, 1995). Indeed, children are by no
means careless risk takers but engage with risks deliberately,
at least some of the time, as a means of exploring and under-
standing themselves and the world. Christensen and
Mikkelsen's (2008) research shows that they are in fact prac-
ticing their own sophisticated form of risk management, an
activity that is frequently invisible to adults. To attempt to
isolate young people from such opportunities excludes them
from many social relationships, emotional excitement, and
involvement with other children. Furthermore, accidents are
important events for children from which they learn many
things. Thus, it can be argued that adults would be well-
advised not to pursue the fallacy of risk elimination but
instead create environments that will engage and extend chil-
dren's risk assessment (RA) and management skills in a way
that they will understand the nature of the world and so
enhance their resilience (Gill, 2007, 2010).
Thus, the movement to reduce the injury toll on children's
playgrounds may have been detrimental overall, in that it has
deprived children of life experiences (fun and sorrow) and
challenge (Herrington & Nicholls, 2007), subverted the
evolutionary process of learning from one's mistakes
(Christensen & Mikkelsen, 2008), may have led to an
increase in psychopathology and neuroticism (Sandseter &
Kennair, 2011), and has cast aside opportunities to foster citi-
zenship and community (Peterson, 2011). It has also diverted
a large percentage of the play budget away from its primary
goals without clear evidence of net benefit (Ball, 2004).
6 SAGE Open
Scope
The arguments above lead us to question the scope of stan-
dards as currently conceived. Standards are often presented
as being technical documents whose content and coverage
are matters of objective truth and science. We reject this
view, arguing instead that they are saturated with value judg-
ments, a position reminiscent of that described by Collins
(2009) in his analysis of the contemporary debate over the
standing of scientific knowledge, and by Seedhouse (1997)
in his discussion of the political bases of health care.
Furthermore, it is the failure to recognize this paradox that
leads to many of the confusions around standards and their
application.
We think that the metaphor of "territory" is a useful way of
characterizing the sort of issues that need to be addressed.
Currently, we argue, play equipment standards occupy too
large a territory. They trespass on, or colonize, areas where
they have no right to be. There are arguments to be had as to
where precisely the line of the new border between technical
facts and value-based judgments should be drawn. However,
before that discussion can take place, there first needs to be an
acceptance of our premise: that is, that the territory currently
occupied by play equipment standards is too extensive.
To be clear, our position is not that playground equipment
standards are unnecessary, but that they have been allowed to
influence areas beyond the scope of their competence. We
draw a distinction between aspects of playground equipment
standards that legitimately fall within the scope of engineer-
ing-cum-medical expertise and those that do not. That latter
region, where engineering-cum-medical expertise should
hold no sway, is the area where the emphasis should be on
locally based value judgments. It lies squarely in the "rich-
ness" domain of Checkland and Poulter (2006).
Examples of where the standards should rightly hold sway
include requirements for the structural integrity of play equip-
ment platforms; specifying how deep the foundations should
be for individual pieces of equipment; determining the appro-
priate length and strength of an unsupported cross beam. These
are areas where the objective facts of the matter have legiti-
mate authority. This is quite distinct from the wider, more
complex, nuanced, and value-saturated considerations that
need to be taken into account when determining what, in any
particular case, constitutes "an acceptable level of risk."
We recognize that there are some gray areas where it is
open to argument as to which side of our proposed border a
particular aspect of play provision lies. One example might
be in the matter of fall heights and undersurfacing. Should
there be a standard, and if so, should it be in its present form,
and how can the associated subjectivities and value judg-
ments of any such standard be recognized? We do not here
answer this question, but we recognize that it is a legitimate
and important one to ask.
Currently, standards and the process of standard-making
make no distinction between objective, engineering-
cum-medical considerations, and value-based judgments.
Instead, the two distinct territories are treated as one unified
field of knowledge and decision making. This has had a
deadening effect on the decision-making capacity of play
providers, undermining their confidence and capacity to
make informed value-based judgments about what is good
for children and young people. Play providers have in effect
ceded their authority to make value-based decisions to forms
of technical expertise that should remain silent in the
matter.
Judgments about what constitutes an "acceptable level of
risk" in any particular situation do not admit of one objective
and certain answer. Answers will emerge from the interplay
between individual, community, and societal values, under-
standings, and beliefs. The sort of considerations that come
into play here include views about children and young peo-
ple's competence; the potential utility or otherwise of experi-
encing some injuries; the benefits, or otherwise, of risk
taking. More prosaic local factors such as the age range and
interests of users, and the degree, style, and intensity of adult
supervision or oversight may also be relevant. The judg-
ments made here are mediated through, and find life in, accu-
mulated practical experience, which is the only way of
dealing with "the buzzing complexity and confusion" of
such management situations (Checkland & Poulter, 2006).
This value-saturated, accumulated practical experience
might be one useful, although by no means comprehensive,
way of characterizing "common sense." It is experience-
based knowledge that is drawn from, feeds into, and is tested
in everyday life. Two aspects of this knowledge base have
particular salience. One is our capacity to observe what chil-
dren and young people actually do and how they judge,
negotiate, and respond to the different situations that they
find or put themselves in. The other aspect is that every adult
has, by definition, intimate, personal experience of being a
child and knows--from the inside--something about the
capabilities, interests, likes, and dislikes of children and
young people. In other words, the types of knowledge high-
lighted here encompass what we might call a "lived-in"
behavioral, psycho-social perspective.
"Common sense" judgments are not unassailable; they are
open to challenge, and one person's common sense is often not
the same as another's. This poses no in-principle problem.
Attitudes to children, young people, their play, indeed to wider
questions about the meaning and status of childhood and ado-
lescence, are proper subjects of debate and contention within
society. What counts here is that these types of question matter
sufficiently to be the focus of our attention. At base, this is the
stuff of politics and ethics, outside the purview of engineering-
cum-medical stipulations and certainly beyond the scope of
any standard. The sort of knowledge outlined here is simply
ill-disposed to standardization.
Play Equipment Inspections
Problems with the structure and content of standards are mir-
rored in the custom and practice associated with play
Spiegal et al. 7
equipment inspections that, nowadays, constitute a major
function in the provision of play. Playground inspections, as
currently undertaken, are typically inspections in relation to
standards. This is made clear in the following two edited and
typical extracts from two anonymized play inspection com-
panies' reports:
Reference is made in this report to the European standard which
is the appropriate safety standard for the site and equipment. The
requirements and recommendations set out in that standard are
not mandatory but provide the best information upon which risk
assessments should be based.
The inspections are carried out to assess the ongoing safety,
stability and operation following the relevant European (EN) or
British (BS) Standard . . . All inspections are non-dismantling
and do not include testing that requires specialist equipment e.g.
structural and impact attenuation testing or the use of a ladder
. . . A professional 5x5 risk assessment focusing on items of
equipment is provided . . . to assist the operator in determining
the level of hazard found.
The references to standards, non-dismantling of equip-
ment, RA, hazards, and safety are made in most inspection
reports we have seen.
As we indicated earlier, when discussing the scope of
standards, there are some issues covered by standards that
are entirely legitimate and fall within the purview of what we
have characterized as engineering-cum-medical territory.
These include things such as the strength and structural
integrity of crossbars and foundations, and the sag of cable-
ways. Paradoxically, these areas of legitimacy, undeniably
important from a safety perspective, are rarely addressed in
playground inspections, because the requisite test equipment
is expensive, require the presence of more than one inspec-
tor, or are beyond the competence of an inspector to assess.
Given that inspections are in the main "non-dismantling," as
the above extract makes clear, the inspection's claim that
they "assess the ongoing safety, stability and operation . . . "
of equipment is open to question. Related to this, there are
parallel questions to be asked as to the degree of utility of
post-installation or annual inspections provide, given that
key elements of the equipment are left unchecked.
If the current standard encompasses stipulations beyond its
competence, then any inspection that is based on the standard
is likely to replicate the error. This has been experienced by
those attempting to create more natural play environments,
whether in designated play areas or as "playable space." Here,
we find that boulders and fallen trees, for example, often
become subject to inspection against the letter of the play
equipment standards, with no room for judgment as to their
relevance or applicability in more naturalistic contexts. In one
example, play inspectors considering a raised log trail through
mature woodland specified that the ground cover around the
logs should be kept free from all loose materials and debris.
Yet the "natural" world, even when contrived by the human
hand, is essentially knobbly and irregular and not susceptible
to standardization. Adherence to equipment-based inspection
leads to inspection regimes effectively scuppering play pro-
viders' service objectives so far as creating more natural play
settings is concerned.
Another problem is that inspections can obscure the dif-
ference between RA judgments and compliance or non-
compliance with equipment or surfacing standards. It is not
unusual to find inspections that "fail" equipment or surfaces
for what common sense would judge are but minor devia-
tions from the standard.
The wider question to be addressed here is as follows:
What is the relationship between equipment standards and
RA and management? Does a deviation from the standard
automatically move the deviant equipment or surface toward
creating an unacceptable level of risk? The answer is that it
does not. And the reason for this is that there is no necessary
relationship between equipment and surface standards, and
judgments about what might constitute an acceptable level of
risk. By way of example, it does not automatically follow
that a fall height of more than 1 m with no IAS represents in
practice a heightened level of risk, still less that it could be
deemed to constitute an unacceptable level of risk. Standards
are not a proxy for RA or management. This is in fact
accepted by the standard itself, if only implicitly, although
seemingly not always by inspectors, in that allowance is
made within the standard for variation in interpretation in
different jurisdictions.
Underlying this is the fundamental, in principle, problem
of play equipment inspectors undertaking risk (benefit)
assessments (RBAs)3 at all. RBA, by its very nature, is a
holistic process, each assessment focusing on the particulari-
ties of each individual site and its context. This includes, on
one hand, the duty holder's play policy and provision objec-
tives; and on the other, knowledge of each particular provi-
sion, how it is used in practice, how that use may or may not
change over time and by different segments of the user popu-
lation. Hence, monitoring of the provision yields some of the
information required to make an informed risk-benefit judg-
ment (Department for Children, Families and Schools, 2008;
National Children's Bureau, 2013).
Play equipment inspectors, then, whose formal qualifica-
tion may be restricted to knowledge of the equipment stan-
dards, are not in a position to make risk-benefit judgments on
behalf of the duty holder, for three key reasons:
·
· standards cannot stand proxy for judgments about
what constitute acceptable levels of risk. One cannot
"read-off" a risk rating simply by referring to compli-
ance or non-compliance with a standard;
·
· RBAs are value saturated, and those values must be
those of the duty holder's, not the inspectors. In addi-
tion, the information required to form judgments
about what constitutes an acceptable level of risk
includes actual knowledge of how the provision is
8 SAGE Open
used over time--a "snapshot," one-off visit, often at a
time when no children are using the provision, forms
no basis for informed judgment;
·
· in law, making the risk (benefit) judgment is the
responsibility of the duty holder; it cannot usually be
outposted to external inspectors. Thus, any advice
given to the duty holder, once accepted, typically
becomes the duty holder's responsibility.
It needs to be stressed that in many countries, play equip-
ment inspections, as with the standards themselves, are not
mandatory. Conducting an RA or RBA is a legal requirement
(in the United Kingdom at least). As with standards, so too
with inspections, play providers have ceded their responsi-
bility to determine whether in any particular case an external
inspection is required and, if so, the criteria by which play
provision is assessed.
Play Standards and the Courts
Turning now to the actual status of a European standard,
once agreed (and this is by consensus in the Technical
Committee and eventually by weighted voting of member
states), it has to be implemented as a national standard in all
31 of the CEN's member states. In the United Kingdom,
standards remain voluntary but are often cited in legal pro-
ceedings, thus giving them what appears to be and is conve-
niently assumed to be, a legal status. In European general
safety legislation (European Parliament, 2002), however, it
is perfectly acceptable to produce goods independently certi-
fied as safe but without compliance to the EN. Even so, it is
important to remain aware that compliance with the standard
does not of itself confer immunity from legal obligations, as
BS EN 1176 itself states (BSI, 2008).
Nonetheless, recent history has found playground acci-
dents to be an area of keen public interest in the United
Kingdom, one that has on occasion led to legal proceedings.
Doubtless, there are numerous reasons for this, one being the
existence of the false belief that playgrounds can and should
be totally safe, such that any accident is an automatic sign of
someone's culpability. In addition, however, standards them-
selves have become entrained in this legal interest because
they can be interpreted as providing a simple and easily
applied recipe for determining whether a play space was of
an officially approved quality and "safe." This tendency has
been noted in particular in courts of the first instance (lower
courts) that place heavy reliance on compliance with pub-
lished standards and advice (Ball, Maggs, & Barrett, 2009).
In contrast, appeal courts have shown themselves to be far
more concerned with basic principles and the intent of the
originating lawmakers, for example, whether what was done
was reasonable in the circumstances. However, taking a case
to an appeal court is a daunting proposition for anyone.
The problem for play providers, and society, is that the
provision of good play opportunities may be supplanted by
an interest in minimizing the risk of legal penalties, thereby
restricting the provider's scope for decision making, a phe-
nomenon that has, as we noted earlier, been termed "second-
ary risk management" (Power, 2004). There appear to be
three substantive issues. The first is that standards are over-
interpreted and focus on one form of harm, physical injury
compounded with the fact that for the most part, they are
based on questionable assumptions as to what might consti-
tute a reasonable level of safety. Second, they cannot cater
for local circumstances that, for whatever reason, might
demand a more or less risky option. And third, the extent to
which they factor in the benefits of play is obscure.
Conclusion
The rightness of the proposition that play involves self-
directed, flexible responses to uncertainty (Lester & Russell,
2008) is now being substantiated by a growing body of
research in social science. The rightness of it is attributable
to the developmental needs of the young, and the net payoffs
for society of the young going through that process and--it
is important to remember--young people's enjoyment of
their childhood in the here and now. The paradox is that we
live in an era of management systems, many of which come
with elements derived from systems engineering approaches,
and which are less adept at supporting that highly variable,
complex, and unpredictable form of personal and social
expression, play.
This article examines issues that have troubled play
providers for some decades, in particular, the diversion of
play away from what play experts regard as its true goals.
No doubt there are a number of reasons for this having
happened, but in this article, our focus has been the
impacts of European standards, including former British
standards, on the safety of play equipment on play provi-
sion and the iron hand that this has placed on provision
through the complex management system that has grown
up around it.
The outcome is a picture of play equipment standards as
facing a range of challenges. We examined their evidence
base, ethos, scope, and application, and found problems in
each area. Our critique has ranged across a number of disci-
plines, including science, management, philosophy, psychol-
ogy, public policy, law, and practical experience in use.
Although we have focused on European standards, we
believe that our analysis may well apply to standards from
other parts of the world as reported, for example, by
Herrington and Nicholls (2007).
Our aim is not to question the actions of individuals or
institutions who are often well-meaning. It is to suggest how
management systems, processes, and ways of thinking have
led to a situation whereby a tool that apparently aims to
reduce the levels of injury and suffering experienced by chil-
dren and young people has inadvertently created significant
barriers to their health and well-being. As noted in the
Spiegal et al. 9
Introduction, unintentional "risk transfer" problems of this
kind are not new and have been identified in many walks of
life (e.g., Graham & Wiener, 1995).
As should be clear, we take seriously the goal of giving
children the opportunity for healthy, enjoyable, and develop-
mentally stimulating play experiences. Moreover, we wel-
come the greater attention and effort being given to children
and young people's outdoor play in many countries around
the world.
What can be done about this situation? The normal
response to calls for research on children's play is for further
investigation of measures to reduce risk, for example, there
is an ongoing debate on the need for improved safety surfac-
ing. However, we think that research of a different kind is
needed that would focus on
·
· measuring the benefits of play provision;
·
· understanding more about how children and young
people learn about risk;
·
· reexamining and debating how standards can best
contribute to this process;
·
· identifying the historical, cultural, and economic fac-
tors leading to the pre-eminence of technical stan-
dards when dealing with complex social and personal
phenomena;
·
· the use of evidence in the revision of standards;
·
· and "common sense," non-formal forms of decision
making.
Notes
1. Although it is sometimes argued by those intent on risk mini-
mization that the legal requirement should be seen as a mini-
mum standard, this is illogical because it would imply that
one should do more than is reasonable, itself an unreasonable
proposition.
2. The four agencies are Play England, PlayBoard Northern
Ireland, Play Scotland, and Play Wales.
3. We prefer the term risk benefit assessment (RBA) over risk
assessment (RA). RBA explicitly acknowledges the benefits
of play, including exposure to some risk, whereas the term risk
assessment does not. However, the comments in the text apply
equally to RBA and RA.
