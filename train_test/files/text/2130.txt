Background: Intimate partner violence (IPV) is common among
young adult relationships, and is associated with significant morbidity,
including sexually transmitted infections (STI). This study measured
the association between IPV victimization and perpetration and prev-
alent STIs and STI-risk behaviors among a sample of young women.
Methods: This analysis uses wave 3 of the National Longitudinal
Study of Adolescent Health and was restricted to the 3548 women
who reported on a sexual relationship that occurred in the previous
3 months and agreed to STI testing. A multivariate random effects
model was used to determine associations between STI and STI-risk
behaviors and IPV.
Results: The IPV prevalence over the past year was 32%--3%
victim-only, 12% perpetrator-only, and 17% reciprocal. The STI prev-
alence was 7.1%. Overall, 17% of participants reported partner con-
currency and 32% reported condom use at last vaginal intercourse. In
multivariate analysis, victim-only and reciprocal IPV were associated
with not reporting condom use at last vaginal intercourse. Perpetrator-
only, victim-only, and reciprocal IPV were associated with partner con-
currency. Victim-only IPV was associated with a higher likelihood of
having a prevalent STI (odds ratio: 2.1; 95% confidence interval: 1.0­4.2).
Conclusions: This analysis adds to the growing body of literature
that suggests that female IPV victims have a higher STI prevalence, as
well as a higher prevalence of STI-risk behaviors, compared with
women in nonviolent relationships. Women in violent relationships
should be considered for STI screening in clinics, and IPV issues
should be addressed in STI prevention messages, given its impact on
risk for STI acquisition.
Intimate partner violence (IPV), defined as physical, sexual, or
psychological harm by a current or former partner or spouse,1
is commonly reported among young adult heterosexual rela-
tionships. The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent
Health (Add Health) carried out between 2001 and 2002 found
that 29% of women and 25% of men aged 18 to 28 years
reported ever being victimized by physical IPV.2 In the same
survey, 36% of women and 17% of men reported ever perpe-
trating physical IPV.2 Among the relationships that were re-
ported as violent, about half (52%) were reciprocally violent,
meaning the participant reported both victimization and perpe-
tration of IPV. These reciprocally violent relationships were
found to be associated with a higher frequency of violence and
injury occurrence compared with relationships in which the
violence was unidirectional.2 In addition, the study found that
the woman was the perpetrator in a majority of unidirectional
violent relationships. This previous study offered a few expla-
nations for this counter-intuitive finding, including that men
may be less likely to hit back if their partner initiates physical
violence such as slapping or that more severely abused women
that are captured in clinical studies may be excluded from
survey studies.
There is evidence to indicate that women in abusive
relationships experience adverse health outcomes including
sexually transmitted infections (STIs) and infertility.3 Several
studies have looked at associations with STI-risk behaviors and
have found that abused women are at increased risk for unpro-
tected intercourse3­7 and partner nonmonogamy.3,8,9 Findings
based on the nationally representative Add Health data reveal
that current involvement in a verbally abusive relationship in
adolescence was associated with not using a condom at last
vaginal intercourse6 and that physical IPV in the most recent
relationship in adolescence was associated with inconsistent
condom use in that relationship.5 Among women in wave 3 of
Add Health, who are now young adults, physical abuse victim-
ization in the previous year was associated with inconsistent
condom use in the previous year.4
Women who are victims of IPV also have increased odds
of having a history of STI.3,10­14 In one study conducted among
women who completed the Massachusetts Youth Risk Behav-
ior Survey, which was a representative sample of youth in
grades 9 through 12, being an IPV victim was associated with
ever testing for STIs or HIV and ever being diagnosed with an
STI or HIV.11 However, this was based on self-reported history
of STI and did not include a currently diagnosed STI. The
majority of studies on IPV and sexual health outcomes have
focused on women as the victim of abuse. However, there is
evidence to indicate that women are often both the perpetrators
and victims of violence in intimate relationships.2 It is plausible
that women who are both IPV perpetrators and victims may
experience a different power dynamic in their intimate relation-
ships compared with women who are only victims and not per-
petrators of violence; therefore, these women may exhibit different

sexual risk-taking behaviors and have different risks for STIs
compared with women who are victims only. This study examined
the association between both IPV perpetration and victimization
and their association with prevalent STI and STI-risk behaviors
among a national sample of young adult women.
METHODS
Source of Data
This study analyzes data from wave 3 of Add Health. The
Add Health dataset contains demographic and behavioral infor-
mation from a sample of adolescents in grades 7 to 12 in the
United States enrolled in the 1994­1995 academic year.15 Wave 3
data were collected in 2001­2002 when participants were between
18 and 28 years of age. Participation, which involved an in-
home interview, included both a face-to-face interview and an
audio-computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) for more sen-
sitive questions including questions on sexual behavior. During
the ACASI portion, respondents were asked to list all their
sexual and romantic relationships from the previous 5 years. On
the basis of an algorithm that took into account factors such as
duration, marital status, and recency, "important" relationships
were selected, for example, if there was a current marriage it
was selected, if not then a current cohabitation was selected.
More detailed information was gathered on these "important"
relationships, including questions about IPV perpetration and
victimization, as well as sexual behaviors within that relation-
ship.15 In addition, participants provided a urine specimen for
STI testing. Chlamydia trachomatis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae
were detected using the Abbott LCx Probe System (Abbott
Park, IL). Trichomonas vaginalis was detected by using an
in-house polymerase chain reaction enzyme-linked immu-
nosorbent assay.16
Among the 8030 women in wave 3, 163 were excluded
because they did not have a high school identifier (required to
control for the clustered survey design), 1763 were excluded
because they reported no sexually active heterosexual relation-
ships. An additional 101 were excluded because of missing
abuse data and 754 were excluded because they did not consent
to STI testing. Finally, because the relevant time frame for
assessing behaviors in relation to STI acquisition is 3 months,
1700 women were excluded because their relationships were
not sexually active in the previous 3 months. This resulted in a
sample size of 3548 women for the present analyses. Further-
more, while women could report on several "important" rela-
tionships, given our interest in current STI status, we analyzed
data only on the most recent "important" relationship. The
women included in this analysis did not differ from the full
sample of wave 3 women in terms of age or educational status.
However, there was a larger proportion of white non-Hispanic
women in the subsample used for this analysis compared with
the full sample.
Measures
Outcome Variables. Our outcome variables included a
positive STI result, condom use, and concurrent partnerships.
The presence of a prevalent STI was based on laboratory test
results for C. trachomatis, N. gonorrhoeae, and T. vaginalis.
Women who tested positive for at least 1 of these 3 infections
were defined as STI positive. Condom use was assessed at last
vaginal intercourse. To assess concurrent partnerships, women
were asked if they believed their partner was having sex with
other partners during their sexual relationship.
Exposure Variables. Both physical and sexual IPV
were assessed. Questions for IPV were based on the Conflict
Tactics Scale, a tool used to measure IPV that is based on
asking about specific acts and events.17 The behaviors included
in the questions were: (1) threatening your partner with vio-
lence, pushing or shoving, or throwing something that could
hurt; (2) slapping, hitting, or kicking; and (3) injuring your
partner. For each behavior a separate question was asked about
perpetration and victimization. Women who reported commit-
ting any of these behaviors in the previous year were consid-
ered IPV perpetrators, whereas those who reported partners
who perpetrated any of these behaviors in the previous year
were considered IPV victims.
Women were grouped into 4 IPV categories: perpetrator-
only, victim-only, reciprocal, and nonabusive relationships. The
"perpetrator-only" relationships were ones where the woman was
the only perpetrator, and "victim-only" were relationships
where their partner was the only perpetrator. "Reciprocal"
relationships were relationships where both perpetration and
victimization were reported. Nonabusive relationships were
ones where no perpetration or victimization was reported.
Participants were also asked about sexual victimization, "In
the past year, has your partner insisted on or made you have
sexual relations with him when you didn't want to?" A
dichotomous variable was created to indicate whether the
woman had been a victim of sexually aggressive behavior in
the previous year or not.
Individual and Relationship Specific Covariates. Data
on variables that could potentially confound or modify the
relationship between IPV and STI and STI-risk behaviors were
included in this analysis. These variables included age, race/
ethnicity, and education. Relationship characteristics included
level of commitment in the relationship ("only sex"/casual
dating, exclusive dating, ever lived together, ever married), and
age discordance in the relationship (same age, partner 3 years
younger, partner 3 years older). Other variables considered
for inclusion in the model were substance use in the past year,
frequent heavy drinking in the past year (5 alcoholic drinks in
one sitting at least twice per month vs. less than this amount),
exchanging sex for money in the past year, and number of sex
partners in the previous year.
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate analyses examined associations between IPV
status and prevalent STI and STI-risk behaviors as well as
associations between demographic and relationship character-
istics and prevalent STI and STI-risk behaviors. Pearson 2 test
was used to test for significant associations between categorical
variables and the Wilcoxon rank sum test was used for contin-
uous variables. Multivariate analyses of the relationship be-
tween IPV status and prevalent STI and STI-risk behaviors
were conducted using a random effects model to control for the
clustered survey design. Covariates were selected for the mul-
tivariate model on the basis of a priori knowledge and statisti-
cally significant bivariate results (P  0.05). All analyses were
performed with Stata 11.0, and the multivariate analyses were
performed using the xtlogit command.
RESULTS
Of the 3548 women included in this analysis, over half
were white non-Hispanic (58%), 19% were black non-His-
panic, 14% were Hispanic, and 10% were women of another
race (Table 1). The mean age was 22 years, with more than

one-quarter (27%) being married, 31% cohabiting with their
partner, and 33% in exclusive dating relationships. Overall,
32% of women reported being in a relationship that included
physical IPV over the past year. Seventeen percent (17%) of
relationships were reciprocally abusive. In 3% of the relation-
ships, the woman was the only IPV victim, and in 12%, the
woman was the only IPV perpetrator. The prevalence of sexual
victimization was 8% (Table 1). Women who were sexually
victimized were more likely to be in a physically abusive
relationship (reciprocal: 47%, victim: 8%, perpetrator: 16%)
than women who were not sexually victimized (reciprocal:
14%, victim: 3%, perpetrator: 12%) (P  0.001). The overall

STI prevalence was 7%. The prevalence of C. trachomatis, N.
gonorrhoeae, and. T. vaginalis was 4.6%, 0.4%, and 2.8%,
respectively.
Intimate Partner Violence and STIs
Women who reported being physical IPV victims, but
not perpetrating IPV, had a higher prevalence of STIs com-
pared with women in nonabusive relationships (13.2% vs.
6.3%, P  0.01; Table 1). The STI prevalence also varied by
race/ethnicity, with the highest prevalence among non-Hispanic
black women (18.4%) and the lowest among non-Hispanic
white women (3.6%, P  0.001). Women who believed their
partner had concurrent partners also had a higher STI preva-
lence than those who did not (11% vs. 6%, P  0.001).
In multivariate analyses, women who were the only
physical IPV victims were more likely to have an STI com-
pared with women in nonabusive relationships (adjusted odds
ratio [AOR]: 2.1, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0­4.2) after
controlling for confounding factors and the clustered survey
design (Table 2). In contrast, women who were sexually vic-
timized by their partner were less likely to have an STI (AOR:
0.5, 95% CI: 0.3­0.9).
IPV and Condom Use
Overall, 32% of women reported condom use at last
vaginal intercourse (Table 1). Women who were sexually vic-
timized in the previous year had a lower prevalence of condom
use at last vaginal intercourse compared with women who were
not sexually victimized (26% vs. 32%, P  0.05; Table 1).
Women who were in reciprocally violent (24%) and victim-
only relationships (21%) reported a lower prevalence of con-
dom use at last vaginal intercourse compared with women who
were in perpetrator-only (31%) and nonabusive relationships
(35%) (P  0.001).
In multivariate analysis, women in reciprocally violent
relationships (AOR: 0.8, 95% CI: 0.6­1.0) and those in victim-
only relationships (AOR: 0.6, 95% CI: 0.3­1.0) were signifi-

cantly less likely than women in nonabusive relationships to
report condom use at last vaginal intercourse after adjusting for
potential confounding factors (Table 2). In contrast, there was
no significant difference in reported condom use at last sex
between women who only perpetrated IPV compared with
women in nonviolent relationships.
IPV and Concurrent Partnerships
Overall, 17% of participants believed that their partner
had concurrent partners. Women who had been sexually vic-
timized in the previous year had a higher prevalence of
believing their partner had concurrent partners (27%) than
those who had not been victimized (16%). Women in any
type of physically abusive relationship, perpetration (22%),
victimization (25%), or reciprocal (28%), were more likely
to believe their partner was concurrent than women in
nonabusive relationships (12%).
Believing that your partner has concurrent partners was
reported by a greater number of non-Hispanic black women
(25%) than non-Hispanic white women (14%), Hispanic
women (16%), and women of another race (17%; P  0.001;
Table 1). Approximately one-third (34%) of women in "only
sex" or casual dating relationships believed their partner had
concurrent partners compared with less than one-fifth (13%­
18%) of women in more committed relationships (P  0.001).
In multivariate analysis, women who were the only
victim (AOR: 2.2, 95% CI: 1.4­3.6), the only perpetrator
(AOR: 1.8, 95% CI: 1.4­2.4), and those in reciprocally violent
relationships (AOR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.9­3.0) were significantly
more likely than women in nonabusive relationships to believe
that their partner had concurrent partners (Table 2).
DISCUSSION
This analysis, which is based on a subsample of women
in a nationally representative survey, found that women who
are IPV victims have a higher STI prevalence, as well as a
higher prevalence of STI-risk behaviors such as unprotected
vaginal intercourse and partners with concurrent partnerships,
compared with women in nonviolent relationships. To our
knowledge, this is the first study to separately evaluate STI-risk
behaviors and STI prevalence among female victims, female
perpetrators, and women in reciprocally violent relationships.
Women who were IPV victims were less likely to report
condom use at last vaginal intercourse than women in nonvi-
olent relationships, regardless of IPV perpetration status. A
possible explanation for this association could relate to the
underlying balance of power characterized by their partner-
ships; women who are victims, regardless of IPV perpetra-
tion, may have less negotiating power in their relationships
than women in nonviolent relationships. This is supported
by a New Zealand study that found that female IPV victims
were more likely than nonabused women to have a partner
refuse to use a condom.18
This analysis also found that women in violent relation-
ships, regardless of whether the woman is a victim, perpetrator,
or both a victim and a perpetrator of IPV, are approximately
twice as likely to report that they believe their partner has
concurrent partners. Given that partner concurrency is a risk
factor for STI acquisition,19,20 female IPV perpetrators as well
as victims may be at increased risk of exposure to an STI.
Although other studies have demonstrated the increased risk to
female IPV victims through their partners' behavior,8,9,21 to our
knowledge, this is the first study to show that female IPV
perpetrators are also more likely to believe that their partner has
concurrent partnerships compared with women in nonviolent
relationships.
We also found an elevated risk of a laboratory-confirmed
STI among women who were victims of, but did not perpetrate,
IPV in their relationship. It could be that women who are being
victimized and are not perpetrating have the largest imbalance
of power in their relationship, which could result in increased
exposure to STIs and potentially less ability to seek care for an
infection. Further research is needed to understand why victims
who do not perpetrate IPV are at greater risk to test positive for
an STI than victims who perpetrate IPV against their partner
given that use of condoms and partner's concurrency does not
explain the difference in STI risk between these 2 groups. Other
risk behaviors that could possibly explain the difference in risk
between these 2 groups are having sex while high on drugs or
alcohol and condom failures, which were both found to be
mediators between IPV victimization and chlamydia infection
in previous work.22
The inverse relationship between being sexually victim-
ized by an intimate partner in the previous year and having a
prevalent STI is not intuitive--i.e., those who were sexually
victimized had a lower STI prevalence. However, this could be
explained by a higher motivation among these women to seek
STI testing and treatment before the study than women who
have not been sexually victimized. Thus, these women could be
less likely to have an undetected STI at the time of the inter-
view. Indeed, sexual victimization was associated with being
tested for Chlamydia, gonorrhea, or trichomoniasis in the pre-
vious year (37% vs. 31%, P  0.03) and with having a positive
diagnosis for a STI in the past year (10% vs. 5%, P  0.001)
compared with women who were not sexually victimized.
Another surprising finding is that 12% of relationships were
unidirectionally violent with the woman being the only perpetrator
where as in only 4% of relationships the woman was the only
victim. This replicates previous findings from this data set.2 This
could be due to the type of violence captured in the CTS questions
used in the questionnaire, which included actions such as slapping
and pushing. If more severe types of violence were included more
male perpetrated violence may have been reported. In addition,
women who are experiencing more severe forms of male-perpe-
trated violence might not be captured in this survey because their
abuser could limit their ability to participate.
This study has several limitations, including the possi-
bility of social desirability bias, which may have resulted in
under reporting of IPV and concurrency, and over-reporting of
condom use. However, these questions were asked by ACASI
instead of face-to-face interview, which may have minimized
the potential bias in these estimates due to social desirability. In
addition, we limited our analysis to women who reported
vaginal intercourse with their partner in the previous 3 months,
which is the relevant time-frame for a prevalent STI. However,
it was not possible to restrict the reports of IPV to the same
time frame. The time frame for reported IPV was within the
previous year. Therefore, the IPV might not have been happen-
ing concurrently with the acquisition of the STI. However, if
the variables were more directly relevant to the analysis the
association would be expected to be stronger not weaker, so the
fact that an association was found suggests that there may be a
true effect. Finally, it would also add to the analysis if the
survey had included more context about the violent episodes,
such as who typically initiated the violence.
Despite these limitations, this study offers insight into
the association between STI risk behaviors, STIs, and IPV.
Others have shown that female IPV victims are at an increased
risk of STI,10­14 but this study is the first to ask this question

using a nationally representative sample, and to separately
consider female perpetration as well as victimization. In addi-
tion, most previous work has examined self-reported STI his-
tory instead of prevalent laboratory-diagnosed STI. The results
found in this study could be used to improve STI prevention
interventions; given the high prevalence of IPV in young adult
relationships and the increased risk of STI associated with
being in an abusive relationship, addressing IPV within STI
prevention interventions may help to reduce STI risk in this
vulnerable population. These messages should be sensitive to
that fact that women in abusive relationships may not be able to
negotiate condom use, and include information on IPV and how
it could increase risk for STI acquisition, as well as where
women in abusive relationships can access help. It is also
important for medical practitioners to recognize the increased
risk of STI among female IPV victims and to screen for these
infections.
