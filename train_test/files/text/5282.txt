Abstract
Objective: This study was performed to assess the clinical and radiological outcomes of a
revascularization procedure in immature teeth with apical periodontitis using platelet-rich plasma
(PRP). The PRP protocol and conventional revascularization protocol, which used a blood clot as
the scaffold, were compared.
Methods: Thirty non-vital immature permanent teeth were randomly categorized into two
groups. After disinfecting the root canal space with triple antibiotic paste (1:1:1 ciprofloxacin,
metronidazole, and cefaclor), a tissue scaffold was created using either PRP or a blood clot
(control) and covered with white mineral trioxide aggregate. All cases were followed up clinically
and radiographically for 12 months. Differences in bone density, root length, and lesion size were
calculated using preoperative and postoperative computed tomography images. The means of the
differences in individual parameters in the blood clot and PRP groups were compared using the
Mann­Whitney U test.
Results: After 5 months, sensitivity tests (cold and electric pulp tests) elicited a delayed positive
response in 23 sites. At 12 months, cone-beam computed tomography revealed resolution or a
decrease in lesion size and an increase in bone density in all 30 (100%) teeth. Additionally,
continued root development was observed in 22 (73%) teeth and early root growth was observed
in the test group (mineral trioxide aggregate with PRP).
Conclusions: The results of this study suggest that PRP can serve as a successful scaffold for
regenerative endodontic treatment. With the exception of a significant increase in root length, the

Introduction
Management of permanent teeth with
necrotic pulp, periapical pathology, and
arrested root development poses a great
challenge for dentists. The results of halted
root development include weak root dentin,
open apices, and stunted root growth; hence,
such teeth are prone to root fracture.1
Moreover, such abnormalities make them
unsuitable for debridement and filling with
traditional techniques and obturation
materials.2,3 Earlier apexification with cal-
cium hydroxide,4 which is used to form an
apical hard tissue barricade after multiple
visits, was historically the treatment of
choice in such cases. However, with the
advent of mineral trioxide aggregate
(MTA), a synthetic wall can be promptly
formed in the apical third of root with a very
high success rate as proven by many mile-
stone studies.5­7 This has also reduced
the number of required clinical sessions.
A disadvantage common to both calcium
hydroxide and MTA, however, is that they
do not allow for continued root develop-
ment, resulting in thin dentin walls and
hence a feeble root structure.8,9
The clinical management of such a per-
plexing clinical challenge is to stimulate the
regenerative tissues of the pulp­dentin com-
plex to complete apical development.3
Recent advances in tissue engineering have
focused upon three key factors for tissue
regeneration: adult stem cells, signaling
molecules, and a three-dimensional (3D)
physical scaffold that can sustain cell
growth and differentiation. Various authors
have recently reported on the concept of
regenerative endodontics.9­11 According to
these studies, stem cells from the apical
papilla of immature teeth are accountable
for continued apex formation in a sterile
environment.11 Unlike apexification, regen-
eration allows for rapid continuation of root
development, increased wall thickness, and
natural healing of periapical tissues.10,11
Previously published case studies using a
blood clot as a scaffold for regeneration
have established the radiographic signs of
continued thickening of root dentin and
ensuing apex formation in teeth with peria-
pical lesions.12,13 Platelet-rich plasma (PRP)
has recently been described as a source of
growth factors and a potentially ideal scaf-
fold for regenerative endodontic treatment
regimens because of its ability to maintain
the vitality of pulp tissues by promoting cell
growth and transport of growth factors in a
disinfected environment.14­17 Treatment
protocols that make use of this innate
mechanism of stimulated healing and regen-
eration of tissues in combination with thor-
ough disinfection of the root canal system
are useful to manage non-vital immature
teeth with periapical pathology. Various
case series and in-vivo studies of regener-
ation procedures with PRP have been pub-
lished.15,16,32,36­39 However, a lack of
sufficient evidence has prevented the exten-
sive use of such treatment protocols in the
clinical setting. The aim of the present study
584 Journal of International Medical Research 45(2)
was to determine the efficacy of a regenera-
tive protocol using PRP in non-vital young
permanent teeth.
Materials and methods
In this split-mouth-designed study (approved
by the University of Dammam Institutional
Review Board: IRB-2014-02-029), 16 healthy
patients with young permanent single-rooted
teeth were selected among patients attending
the outpatient dental clinics at the College
of Dentistry, University of Dammam. None
of the teeth had been previously treated for
necrosis. Written informed consent was
acquired from the patients and their guard-
ians. Institutional ethical clearance was
obtained for this study.
The inclusion criteria were as follows:
(1) Pulp necrosis with or without periapical
lesions and an immature apex
(2) Probability of tooth restoration
(3) No pathologic mobility, ankylosis, root
fracture, or probing depths of >3 mm
(4) No allergy to medications or antibiotics
necessary to complete procedure29,30
Pulp necrosis was tentatively diagnosed
by the patient's dental history and clinical
examination findings, which included elec-
tric pulp testing and cold testing. Clinical
signs and symptoms such as pain, swelling,
fistulas, and sensitivity to percussion and
palpation were also noted. Among the 16
patients, 32 non-vital young permanent
teeth with either apical periodontitis or
abscesses showing a negative response on
pulp testing were included in the study. All
teeth were randomly divided into either the
control group, in which a blood clot was
used as the scaffold, or the test group, in
which PRP was used as the scaffold. Teeth
with periapical lesions were grouped accord-
ing to the size of the lesion as follows:
Score 0 Intact periapical bone structures
Score 1 Periapical radiolucency of >0.5 to
1 mm
Score 2 Periapical radiolucency of >1 to
2 mm
Score 3 Periapical radiolucency of >2 to
4 mm
Score 4 Periapical radiolucency of >4 to
8 mm
Score 5 Periapical radiolucency of >8 mm
Treatment procedures
Regenerative treatment was performed
according to the protocol established by the
American Association of Endodontists.
Under rubber dam isolation, an access open-
ing was made followed by copious, gentle
irrigation with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite,
and the working length was determined with
a size #20 sterile K-file. Canals were not
instrumented but copiously irrigated with
2.5% NaOCl (20 mL), sterile saline (20 mL),
and 0.12% chlorhexidine (10 mL) and dried
with sterile paper points. After sealing the
pulp chamber with a dentin-bonding agent
to minimize the risk of staining, a 1:1:1
mixture of metronidazole, ciprofloxacin,
and minocycline was pulverized and mixed
with distilled water to a final concentration
of 0.1 mg/ml18,19,29 until a creamy paste was
formed. This paste was placed in the canal
below the cementoenamel junction (CEJ) to
minimize crown staining using a lentulo
spiral in a slow-speed handpiece. Canals
were sealed with reinforced zinc oxide­
eugenol cement. The patients were followed
up at 3 weeks, the success of which to
disinfect the root canal has been as proved
by previous studies.2,8,12 The triple anti-
biotic paste was applied again for patients
with any persistent signs or symptoms of
infection, such as purulent drainage, failed
pain resolution, swelling, fistulas, or sensi-
tivity to percussion and palpation.
The response to the initial treatment
was assessed after 3 weeks; if the patient
Alagl et al. 585
was asymptomatic, the antibiotic paste was
removed by copious irrigation with 20 ml of
17% EDTA and normal saline followed by
drying of the canals with sterile paper
points. Scaffolds were then created accord-
ing to the allocated group. In the blood clot
group, a size #20 K-file was rotated 2 mm
past the apical foramen under local anes-
thesia to induce bleeding, filling the root
canal up to the level of the CEJ.20,22­28 After
blood clot formation, the final restoration
was completed with white MTA (Dentsply
Tulsa Dental, Tulsa, OK), glass ionomer
cement (Fuji VII; GC, Tokyo, Japan), and
composite resin (Filtek Z350; 3M ESPE,
St. Paul, MN) during the same visit to
achieve a coronal seal.
In the PRP group, no anesthetic was used.
PRP was prepared according to the descrip-
tion by Dohan et al.31 PRP was combined
with equal volumes of sterile saline solution
containing 10% calcium chloride and sterile
bovine thrombin (100 U/mL) to achieve
coagulation. The PRP was then injected into
the root canal up to the level of the CEJ. Final
restoration was completed as described for
the blood clot group.
Clinical and radiographic follow-up
Clinical and radiographic follow-up exam-
inations were performed every 3 months
during a 12-month follow-up period. The
same pediatric dentist performed all follow-
up examinations.
Treated teeth were examined for vitality
using both electric pulp and cold testing.
They were recorded as responding positively
to vitality testing only if they responded
positively to both tests. A post-treatment
computed tomography (CT) scan was per-
formed at 3 months and then repeated at
least every 3 to 12 months depending on the
patient's condition. At the end of 12 months,
cone-beam CT (CBCT) images were inde-
pendently evaluated with respect to lesion
size, periapical healing, and apical closure.
The same pediatric dentist re-examined all
radiographs 1 month after the preliminary
examination, and intra-examiner validity
was assessed using kappa statistics. Kappa
values ranged from 0.8 to 1.0, signifying
good reliability.
For all cases, CBCT (I-Cat; Imaging
Sciences International, Hatfield, PA) was
used to take images of the maxillofacial area
Figure 1. Preoperative cone-beam computed tomography image showing periapical radiolucencies
(decreased bone density compared with adjacent normal bone) and root length measured for both the
control site (blood clot1) and test site (platelet-rich plasma2).

at a setting of 120 kVp and 3 to 7 mA.
Images were obtained with an exposure time
of 9 s. Each scan was taken over 360 with a
voxel size of 0.3 mm. The lesion size, bone
density (Hounsfield units), and root length
were measured.
In the pretreatment CBCT images, the bone
density was recorded in the coronal plane with
a 3.5-mm2 area in regions containing periapical
lesions and normal adjoining bone regions
(Figure 1). The final postoperative measure-
ments were made 1 year after the endodontic
treatment using CBCT images taken with
the same parameters (Figure 2). The mean
initial and final bone density measurements
are shown in Table 1.
All CBCT measurements were obtained
with Dolphin 3D Imaging software (Dolphin
Imaging Systems, Chatsworth, CA) on a
computer workstation running under
Table 1. Pre- and post-treatment comparison of parameters in both study
groups (control and test).

(Microsoft Corp., Redmond, WA). Sagittal-
view CBCT images were evaluated to meas-
ure lesion size using the built-in measurement
tools (Figure 3).
To standardize the root length measure-
ments, the alignment for each tooth was
attuned using the coronal view; the sagittal
and axial planes were adjusted to intersect
on the CEJ (Figure 4). The root length was
measured along the long axis of each tooth
from the most apical point of the root
perpendicular to the line connecting the
mesial and distal CEJs as a measure of
standardization34 to determine the change in
the length postoperatively.
Statistical analysis
The data were analyzed using the Statistical
Package for Social Sciences, version 13 (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL). Clinical and radiographic
data were assessed using a paired t-test, and a
P value of <.001 was considered statistically
significant. Comparison between the mean of
the differences in individual parameters in the
control group (blood clot) and test group
(PRP) was performed using the Mann­
Whitney U test, with a P value of <.005
considered statistically significant.
Results
Preoperative clinical and radiographic
findings
Of 16 patients (6 girls, 10 boys) selected for
the study, only 1 patient did not return for
the postoperative follow-up visits. Of 30
necrotic teeth (PRP, 15; blood clot, 15) in 15
children (6 girls, 9 boys), 24 were maxillary
incisor teeth exhibiting pulp necrosis in
conjunction with a history of traumatic
injury (either crown fracture or luxation)
and 6 were premolar teeth (1 maxillary first
premolar, 3 mandibular first premolars, and

2 mandibular second premolars) exhibiting
pulp necrosis due to deep dentin caries or
secondary caries.
Preoperative acute symptoms including
night pain, spontaneous pain, and extreme
sensitivity to percussion were observed in 26
teeth (PRP, 14; blood clot, 12), and pre-
operative apical abscesses were recorded in 9
teeth (PRP, 4; blood clot, 5). Moreover, four
teeth assigned to the PRP group and five
teeth assigned to the blood clot group
required two sessions with triple antibiotic
paste until the teeth were symptom-free.
With regard to periapical lesions, 8 teeth
(PRP, 3; blood clot, 1) had no lesions, 10
teeth (PRP, 3; blood clot, 4) had a score 1
periapical lesion, 9 teeth (PRP, 1; blood clot,
4) had a score 2 periapical lesion, and 3 teeth
(PRP, 3; blood clot, 1) had a score 3
periapical lesion.
Postoperative clinical and radiographic
findings
The clinical and radiographic findings of
both groups are shown in Table 3. All 15
patients (30 teeth: PRP, 15; blood clot, 15)
who underwent this endodontic treatment
protocol exhibited exceptional clinical and
radiographic responses. All patients were
followed up for 12 months. After 1 month,
all teeth were clinically asymptomatic with
comprehensive resolution of associated soft
tissue lesions. After 5 months, sensitivity
tests (cold and electric pulp tests) elicited a
delayed positive response close to that found
in adjacent teeth in 23 sites. At the 12-month
follow-up visit, CBCT findings exhibited
resolution of or a decrease in the lesion
size and an increase in bone density, depict-
ing periapical healing with resolution of
signs and symptoms (pain, swelling, fistula,
and/or sensitivity to percussion and palpa-
tion) of pathology in all 30 teeth (100% of
cases). In addition, continued root develop-
ment or apical closure was seen in 22 teeth
(73% of cases; 14 in the PRP group and 8 in
the blood clot group), whereas a delayed
positive response to pulpal sensitivity testing
was seen in 19 cases (63.3% of cases; 13 in
the PRP group and 6 in the blood clot
group). Data derived from pretreatment
and postoperative CT evaluations within
the control and test groups showed signifi-
cant differences in the study parameters
(P < .001) (Table 1). In the comparison of
each parameter (lesion size, bone density,
and root length) between the control group
(MTA) and test group (MTA þ PRP), only
the mean difference in the root length was
found to be statistically significant (P < .004)
(Table 2)
Discussion
Numerous previous studies2,3,20,22­28 have
investigated different scaffolds for use in
revascularization protocols. In the present

necrosis (poor prognosis), and a separate
protocol and scaffold may be required for
each of these types of teeth.
In the present study, we evaluated the
efficacy of PRP as a scaffold in teeth with
complete pulp degeneration. At the end of
12 months, all teeth in the PRP group
showed resolution of signs and symptoms
(pain, swelling, fistulas, and/or sensitivity to
percussion and palpation), and 93% of teeth
in the PRP group showed various degrees of
increased root length or apical closure.
This study did not include collection of
tissue samples for histologic examination
because of ethical considerations. However,
the results of the present study are consistent
with those of recent histologic studies that
reported that PRP alone cannot significantly
affect treatment outcomes.32,36­39 Bezgin
et al.32 concluded that PRP successfully
created a scaffold for regenerative endodon-
tic treatment; however, treatment outcomes
did not differ significantly between PRP and
a conventional blood clot scaffold. In
another study, Martin et al.36 found that
PRP may enhance wound healing only if
parenchymal tissue has not been completely
destroyed; it may not otherwise induce tissue
regeneration. This would explain the similar
outcomes between PRP and the blood clot
in the present study because only totally
necrotic teeth were included.
Zhu et al.37 used PRP and dental pulp cells
in a canine study and found a lower rate of
dentin wall thickening and less mineralized
tissue formation when PRP was used alone.
This result was attributed to more rapid
degradation of growth factors in the PRP.
In the present study, 3D CBCT was used
to examine periapical and root length
changes based on the fact that previous
studies40,41 have revealed 3D CBCT to be
more sensitive than periapical radiographs
in detecting periapical lesion treatment out-
comes. Estrela et al.33 effectively used 3D
CBCT and periapical index scoring to meas-
ure radiolucent areas. In the present study,
bone density was quantitatively measured
using the tools within the software.
A significant decrease in lesion size and
increase in bone density were observed.
Narang et al.38 also concluded that blood
clots and PRP show comparable results in
terms of apical closure, root lengthening,
dentinal wall thickening, and periapical
healing. In another study by Jadhav
et al.,39 PRP was more effective than blood
clots in revascularization, and the authors
ascribed the success of PRP to stimulation
of collagen production; sustained release of
growth factors; and enhanced recruitment,
retention, and proliferation of undifferenti-
ated mesenchymal and endothelial cells
from the periapical area.
At the time of this writing, all patients
were still being monitored to determine the
long-term clinical success of PRP as a suc-
cessful scaffold for regenerative protocols.
Conclusion
The results of this study suggest that PRP can
act as a successful scaffold for regenerative
endodontic treatment. However, the results
of treatment with PRP were not significantly
different from those of the conventional
protocol using a blood clot as a scaffold.
What this paper adds
. Platelet-rich plasma can act as a success-
ful scaffold for regenerative endodontic
treatment.
. Platelet-rich plasma results in an early
and significant increase in root length
compared with the conventional protocol
using a blood clot as a scaffold.
