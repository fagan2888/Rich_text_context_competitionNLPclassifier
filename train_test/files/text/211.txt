Impaired Glucose Tolerance and the Likelihood of Nonfatal
Stroke and Myocardial Infarction
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
Adnan I. Qureshi, MD; Wayne H. Giles, MD, MS; Janet B. Croft, PhD
Background and Purpose--Although diabetes mellitus (DM) is known to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease (CVD), the
effect of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) on the risk remains unclear. We determined whether IGT was associated with an
increased likelihood for stroke and myocardial infarction in a nationally representative sample of US adults.
Methods--We evaluated the association between IGT (defined as a fasting glucose level of 140 mg/dL and a plasma
glucose level of between 140 and 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of 75 grams of an oral glucose load) and DM
(defined as the current use of insulin or an oral hypoglycemic medication, a fasting plasma glucose level of 140
mg/dL, or a plasma glucose level of 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of an oral glucose load) with a
self-reported physician diagnosis of stroke and myocardial infarction in 6547 adults aged 40 to 74 years participating
in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were used to
investigate these relationships.
Results--IGT and DM were observed in 1494 and 1532 adults, respectively. After adjustment for differences in age,
gender, race/ethnicity, education, hypertension, cholesterol, body mass index, and cigarette smoking, IGT was not
associated with stroke (odds ratio [OR], 0.9; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.5 to 1.6) or myocardial infarction (OR, 1.1;
95% CI, 0.7 to 1.6). DM was associated with both stroke (OR, 1.6; 95% CI, 1.0 to 2.6) and myocardial infarction (OR,
1.9; 95% CI, 1.3 to 2.8).
Conclusions--In contrast to DM, IGT was not associated with an increased likelihood of prevalent nonfatal stroke or
myocardial infarction. (Stroke. 1998;29:1329-1332.)

An association between asymptomatic hyperglycemia and
CVD was suggested in 1979 in a series of papers by the
International Collaborative Group, including a collective
analysis of 15 studies, that examined the relationship between
IGT and CVD.1,2 More recently, it has been hypothesized that
hyperglycemia below the level characteristic of DM may also
be associated with an increased risk of CVD.3 However, most
of the studies describing an association between IGT and
CVD were performed in populations of European origin in
which CVD was found to be more prevalent in subjects with
IGT than in normoglycemic controls.3 Controversy exists
regarding whether the relationship between IGT and CVD is
causal or results from common antecedents.3 Because the
prevalence of IGT and the rate of progression to DM varies
widely among populations,4 we performed this study to
analyze the independent association between IGT and nonfa-
tal stroke and myocardial infarction in a nationally represen-
tative sample of US adults.
Subjects and Methods
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention conducted the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey between 1988
and 1994 to estimate the prevalence of common chronic conditions
and associated risk factors among a nationally representative sample
of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.5 NHANES III
included a household interview; a medical examination at a mobile
examination center; and phlebotomy to measure a number of
hematologic factors, including glucose and cholesterol. The study
sample included 6547 persons aged 40 to 74 years who participated
in the NHANES III survey at the mobile examination center.
NHANES III participants who were examined at the mobile
examination center and who were not current users of insulin or oral
hypoglycemic medications underwent a 2-hour, 75-g oral glucose
tolerance test. Examinees provided a fasting glucose blood specimen
and then were administered an oral glucose challenge (Dextol-75)
containing the equivalent of 75 g of glucose. A second specimen was
drawn 2 hours after the first.
Participants were judged to have DM if they were current users of
insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication, if they had a fasting plasma
glucose concentration 140 mg/dL, or if they had a plasma glu-
cose 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of the 75-gram glucose
challenge.6,7 Participants were defined as having IGT if they had a
fasting blood glucose 140 mg/dL and a plasma glucose between 140
and 200 mg/dL 2 hours after administration of the oral glucose
challenge. Normal glucose tolerance (NGT) was defined as a fasting and
2- hour-postchallenge glucose value  140 mg/dL.
During the household interview participants were asked whether
they had ever been told by a physician that they had suffered a stroke

or heart attack; persons who answered in the affirmative were
defined as having the condition. Potential confounders in the
association between IGT and stroke and myocardial infarction
included age, gender, race/ethnicity, education, hypertension, cho-
lesterol, body mass index (weight [kg]/height [m2]), and cigarette
smoking. Subjects were judged to be hypertensive if they were
current users of antihypertensive medication or if they had an
average blood pressure greater than or equal to 140/90 mm Hg. This
average blood pressure was based on 3 blood pressure determina-
tions obtained during the medical examination.
t tests and 2 tests were used to compare groups defined by
glucose tolerance. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were
used to determine whether the likelihood of myocardial infarction or
stroke differed by glucose tolerance. The logistic regression model
adjusted for the following CVD risk factors: age, gender, race/
ethnicity, education, hypertension, cholesterol, body mass index, and
smoking status. To take into account the complex sampling design in
the NHANES III survey, SUDAAN8 was used to obtain standard
errors for the prevalence estimates and ORs.
Results
A total of 6547 adults aged 40 to 74 years either had DM or
underwent the oral glucose tolerance test. A total of 1494
persons had IGT and 1532 had DM. Compared with persons
with NGT, those with IGT or DM were older and had fewer
years of education; had higher mean body mass index,
cholesterol, and serum glucose values; and were more likely
to be hypertensive (Table 1). The IGT and DM groups were
less likely to be current smokers, while the NGT group was
more likely to include men. The racial/ethnic composition of
persons with IGT was similar to that for persons with NGT;
by contrast, there was a higher proportion of Hispanics
among the DM group than the NGT group.
The unadjusted prevalence of nonfatal stroke was higher
among the IGT and DM groups than the NGT group (Table
2). However, the age-adjusted likelihood of stroke was
similar for the IGT and the NGT groups (OR, 0.9; 95% CI,
0.5 to 1.7). By contrast, persons with DM had a significantly
greater likelihood of nonfatal stroke than did persons with
NGT (OR, 1.8; 95% CI, 1.1 to 3.0). Adjustment for other
CVD risk factors did not substantially alter the risk estimates.
The prevalence of nonfatal myocardial infarction was also
higher among the IGT and DM groups than the NGT group
(Table 3). However, the age-adjusted likelihood of myocar-
dial infarction for persons with IGT (OR, 1.1; 95% CI, 0.7 to
1.6) was similar to that for persons with NGT. In contrast,
persons with DM had a significantly greater likelihood of
myocardial infarction than did persons with NGT (OR, 2.0;
95% CI, 1.4 to 3.0). These relationships remained after
adjusting for CVD risk factors.
Discussion
Since the introduction of IGT as a diagnostic category, there
has been considerable interest in the possibility that IGT
might be associated with an increased risk of CVD, similar to
the relationship between diabetes mellitus and CVD. This
study in a nationally representative sample of US adults was
unable to demonstrate any association between IGT and
nonfatal stroke and myocardial infarction after the adjustment
for age and CVD risk factors.
A number of studies have investigated the incidence and
prevalence of CVD in subjects with IGT.9­13 All of these
studies used a standardized glucose tolerance test to evaluate
hyperglycemic status, maintain uniform criteria, and avoid

the biases associated with self-reported diagnosis. Although
there are multiple studies of European origin,9,11­14 relatively
few studies have been conducted in the United States.10 A
cross-sectional study in Gothenburg found that only hyper-
tension and heart failure were significantly associated with
IGT; angina pectoris and stroke were not associated with
IGT.9 A Colorado study found an increased prevalence of
coronary heart disease in non-Hispanic white persons with
IGT but no association in persons of Hispanic origin.10 The
Paris Prospective Study evaluated glucose tolerance among
7038 men aged 43 to 54 with no previous cardiovascular
disease.11 After 11 years of follow-up, persons with IGT at
baseline evaluation had approximately twice the risk of CVD
mortality as did those with NGT. The Whitehall study, which
followed 18 403 men aged 40 to 60 years for 18 to 20 years,
also found that subjects with IGT had approximately twice
the risk of CVD mortality as those with NGT.12 However,
because 2% to 16% of persons with IGT progress into overt
DM annually,14,15 the increased risk for CVD noted in
prospective studies, especially those of long duration, is
likely to be confounded by the undocumented development of
DM during follow-up. This finding is supported by results
from a Finnish study of elderly men aged 65 to 84 years,
which reported no excess risk for CVD mortality in persons
with IGT during a 5-year follow-up.13 In addition to study
duration, another potential explanation for the lack of an
association between IGT and CVD may be subject age. Our
study population included elderly persons, a subgroup in
which two other Finnish studies also failed to demonstrate
any association between IGT and CVD.13,16
The present study reported a higher prevalence of hyper-
tension and a higher mean cholesterol level in those with IGT
compared with those who had NGT. These findings are
consistent with previous studies that have demonstrated an
increased frequency of CVD risk factors in persons with
IGT.17,18 The increased prevalence of CVD risk factors among
persons with IGT may have confounded the association
between IGT and CVD reported in other studies. This finding
is further supported by our observation­before the adjust-
ment for age and CVD risk factors­of an increased preva-
lence of both stroke and myocardial infarction in persons with
IGT. This association disappeared after we adjusted for the
confounding of age and other CVD risk factors.
This report is subject to a number of potential limitations.
The definition of stroke and myocardial infarction used in the
NHANES III survey was based on a self-reported physician
diagnosis. O'Mahony et al19 validated the accuracy of assess-
ing lifetime history of stroke in a random sample of 2000
persons aged 45 years and older using a mailed questionnaire.
In that study, the accuracy of the participants' self-reports of
stroke was confirmed by a review of their medical records.
The sensitivity of the question was 95%, and the specificity
was 96%. Similarly high sensitivities (74% to 100%) and
specificities (94% to 99%) have been reported for estimations
of prevalent myocardial infarction.20,21 The questions on
myocardial infarction and stroke in the NHANES III survey
may in fact be more specific because not only was a physician
diagnosis inquired, but the information was acquired during a
personal interview rather than a mailed survey. Finally, the
methodology used in this study did not permit us to evaluate
the likelihood for fatal stroke and myocardial infarction. Fatal
strokes and myocardial infarctions represent less than one
third of all cardiovascular disease events.22­25 The exclusion
of fatal events may have reduced our ability to detect
significant differences; it is possible that IGT could be
associated with only fatal cardiovascular disease events.
However, previous studies have failed to demonstrate an
association between diabetes mellitus and fatal stroke.26­27
In conclusion, we were unable to demonstrate any associ-
ation between IGT and either prevalent stroke or myocardial
infarction in a nationally representative sample of US adults
although the relationship between DM and cardiovascular
disease was clearly demonstrable. Previous studies reporting
such a relationship may not have fully taken into account
many of the cardiovascular disease risk factors that may have
confounded this association.
