Abstract
Background: Idarucizumab is a monoclonal antibody fragment with high affinity for dabigatran that reverses its anti-
coagulant effects within minutes. It may exhibit the potential for patients under dabigatran therapy suffering ischemic
stroke to regain eligibility for thrombolysis with rt-PA and may inhibit lesion growth in patients with intracerebral
hemorrhage on dabigatran.
Aims: To provide insights into the clinical use of idarucizumab in patients under effective dabigatran anticoagulation
presenting with signs of ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.
Methods: Retrospective data collected from German neurological/neurosurgical departments administering idarucizu-
mab following product launch from January to August 2016 were used.

Results: Thirty-one patients presenting with signs of stroke received idarucizumab in 22 stroke centers. Nineteen
patients treated with dabigatran presented with ischemic stroke and 12 patients suffered from intracranial bleeding. In
patients receiving rt-PA thrombolysis following idarucizumab, 79% benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a median
improvement of five points in NIHSS. No bleeding complications occurred. Hematoma growth was observed in 2 out
of 12 patients with intracranial hemorrhage. The outcome was favorable with a median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points
and mRS 0­3 in 67%. Overall, mortality was low with 6.5% (one patient in each group).
Conclusion: Administration of rt-PA after reversing dabigatran activity with idarucizumab in case of ischemic stroke is
feasible, easy to manage, effective, and appears to be safe. In dabigatran-associated intracranial hemorrhage, idarucizumab
has the potential to prevent hematoma growth and improve outcome. Idarucizumab represents a new therapeutic option
for patients under dabigatran treatment presenting with ischemic stroke or intracranial hemorrhage.

Introduction
Neurologists use the direct thrombin inhibitor dabiga-
tran most frequently in secondary stroke prevention in
patients with atrial fibrillation. The RE-LY study1­3
showed superiority of dabigatran 150 mg bid for the
prevention of ischemic stroke compared to warfarin,
and in the subgroup of patients with prior TIA or
stroke, dabigatran was non-inferior to warfarin.4
Three other non-vitamin-K-antagonizing oral anti-
coagulants (NOACs) are approved for stroke preven-
tion in patients with atrial fibrillation.5­7 As a group,
NOACs have lower rates of bleeding complications in
comparison to warfarin, in particular when considering
intracranial hemorrhage.8 A major concern for the use
of oral anticoagulation is the lack of specific and
rapidly acting reversal agents for vitamin-K antagonists
or NOACs.
This has changed for dabigatran with the approval
of idarucizumab, a humanized Fab fragment of a
monoclonal antibody which binds specifically dabiga-
tran with very high affinity. It is indicated in dabiga-
tran-treated patients with life-threatening or
uncontrolled bleeding or those in need of urgent sur-
gery or intervention.9,10 To date, the use of idarucizu-
mab in patients with acute ischemic stroke who qualify
for systemic thrombolysis with rt-PA is limited to single
case reports.11­15
Aims
This report summarizes national experience with idar-
ucizumab administration in dabigatran-treated patients
suffering from acute ischemic stroke or intracranial
hemorrhage in Germany following market launch in
January 2016, for the first eight months until August
2016. We provide data about feasibility, potential
efficacy and safety of idarucizumab application in
these two important patient cohorts.
Methods
We retrospectively collected data from all German
neurological/neurosurgical departments who used idar-
ucizumab for the reversal of dabigatran for the first
eight months from when it became available in the
clinic in January 2016. The anonymized patient data
collected included baseline characteristics, clinical find-
ings, laboratory and coagulation parameters upon
admission, imaging diagnostics, clinical course and
status upon discharge from hospital and further co-
medication. In case of intracranial hemorrhage, we col-
lected information on hematoma growth with clinical
deterioration, adverse events of idarucizumab applica-
tion and outcome measured by modified Rankin score
(mRS) pre- and post-treatment. For ischemic stroke, we
considered NIHSS, mRS, bleeding and thrombotic
complications, clinical outcome and further co-medica-
tion. All data were retrospectively collected, anon-
ymized and transferred for analysis. A few previously
reported single case reports were included in this ana-
lysis as these cases are still rare and were considered
important for this multicenter collection of
patients.11­13,16 The study was approved by the inde-
pendent Ethics Committee (IEC), Medical Faculty of
Essen University.
Results
Our retrospective study retrieved 31 patients
presenting with either intracranial hemorrhage or
ischemic stroke from German Stroke Units, who
received idarucizumab between January and August
2016.

Ischemic stroke patients
Nineteen patients (58% female, 42% male; median age
78 years; median NIHSS upon admission 7) presented
with ischemic stroke (Table 1). Eighteen of these stroke
patients presented within the 4.5 h window for systemic
thrombolysis, and one patient suffered a wake-up
stroke. They did not display signs of bleeding or early
infarct signs on initial CT scan (see Table 1 for baseline
characteristics, laboratory examinations, clinical course
and outcome). All patients were on dabigatran, 14
receiving 110 mg bid; 17 had a history of non-valvular
atrial fibrillation (NVAF). Upon admission, the acti-
vated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) values were
normal in 68% of patients (13 out of 19 patients).
Initial thrombin time (TT) was available in 12 out of
19 patients. TT was prolonged above the upper limit of
normal in 92% (11 out of 12 patients). All individuals
received idarucizumab according to the prescribing
information. All coagulation parameters were normal-
ized in the patients where coagulation parameters were
available post idarucizumab administration (Table 1).
rt-PA was given to all patients according to prescrip-
tion protocol and local SOPs, and one patient under-
went additional thrombectomy. Fifteen out of 19
individuals benefitted from i.v. thrombolysis with a
median improvement of 5 points in NIHSS (mean
from 8 to 3.6 points; median from 7 to 2 points). One
patient had no change in NIHSS prior and after
thrombolysis. Two patients had an unfavorable out-
come. Patient #10 presented with signs of acute verteb-
robasilar stroke and deteriorated 24 h following
admission from NIHSS 7 to 18 due to a large brain-
stem, cerebellar and PCA infarction, while treated with
ASA 100 mg. Patient #9 died five days after idarucizu-
mab application, rt-PA thrombolysis and additional
endovascular thrombectomy after initial neurological
improvement due to severe pneumonia, deep vein
thrombosis, and bilateral pulmonary embolism. The
clinical complications developed a few days following
the index event under treatment with enoxaparin
40 mg/d and ASA 100 mg/d.
The majority of patients with signs of ischemic
stroke had a CrCl above 50 ml/min. Anticoagulation
was restarted between 24 h and 10 days post-ischemia
depending on infarct size in all surviving patients. In
total, 73.7% of patients (14 out of 19) were restarted on
NOAC (dabigatran n ¼ 12, apixaban n ¼ 1, edoxaban
n ¼ 1).
Patients with intracranial bleeding
Twelve patients presented with intracranial hemorrhage
(Table 2). Among these, the majority presented with
intracerebral hemorrhage (n ¼ 8). Three cases showed
a subdural hemorrhage on CT scans. One patient pre-
sented with subarachnoidal hemorrhage. Surgical inter-
vention was necessary in four individuals. All patients
were taking dabigatran for stroke prevention in atrial
fibrillation, and 5 of 12 patients were on the 150 mg bid
dose. The median age was 77 years, 50% were female
and median NIHSS upon admission was 8 points.
Creatinine clearance (CrCl) was above 50 ml/min in 9
out of 12 of cases. TT upon admission was elevated
substantially in all cases examined (n ¼ 9) while aPTT
was normal or slightly above reference (n ¼ 11; see
Table 2). There was no hematoma growth in 10 out
of 12 patients on follow-up CT scans. One patient
died; this patient presented with massive bleeding
(134.5 ml hematoma volume) and signs of herniation
on admission. Overall, outcome was favorable with a
median NIHSS improvement of 5.5 points (mean from
11.5 to 5.9 points; median from 8 to 2.5 points) and
mRS 0­3 in 67% of patients (8 out of 12; Table 2).
Discussion
Thrombolysis with rt-PA is well established and the
recommended therapy for acute ischemic stroke
according to guidelines. Lack of antidotes for patients
on effective oral anticoagulants has to date excluded
patients with acute ischemic stroke, who would other-
wise have been eligible for intravenous thrombolysis
with rt-PA, due to the potential risk of bleeding.
Prothrombin complex concentrates (PCC) are recom-
mended by cardiology and neurology guidelines for the
treatment of bleeding complications under oral antic-
oagulation with VKAs and NOACs; however, the effi-
cacy of this therapy has not been established in patients
with intracranial hemorrhage.17­19 In addition, PCC
has partial prothrombotic effects. A specific antidote
is now available for the reversal of the anticoagulant
effect of dabigatran. Idarucizumab is a humanized
monoclonal antibody fragment that binds dabigatran
$350 times more avidly than dabigatran binds throm-
bin. The standard dose of 5 g immediately reverses the
anticoagulant activity of dabigatran.9,20 Thrombolysis
in ischemic stroke is considered an urgent procedure
and intracranial bleeding is usually life-threatening.
Idarucizumab can be applied on-label for both disease
entities. Here, we report the first case collection
from clinical experience with idarucizumab for two
important neurological conditions: ischemic stroke
and intracranial hemorrhage under effective oral
anticoagulation.

appropriate laboratory tests. For patients on dabiga-
tran, aPTT is recommended as an appropriate test to
provide qualitative rather than quantitative informa-
tion about the presence and anticoagulant activity of
dabigatran. We suggest taking a blood sample for
aPTT immediately after idarucizumab infusion to
ensure an on-label application of rt-PA. Thrombolysis
with rt-PA may be started without delay and only ter-
minated if one of the coagulation parameters proves
still to be prolonged when analysis of the samples has
been performed (see Expert Opinion in this journal
issue). Thrombolysis with rt-PA was highly effective
in our patient series with a median NIH-SS improve-
ment of 5 points and a median mRS of 1 point at dis-
charge. This improvement was achieved without a
bleeding event. One thrombotic adverse event (bilateral
pulmonary embolism) leading to death occurred five
days after idarucizumab/rt-PA infusion. The pulmon-
ary embolism appeared most probably due to the fact
that effective anticoagulation was not restarted in this
patient. Idarucizumab infusion was generally well tol-
erated and anticoagulation with dabigatran could be re-
established after 24 h in the majority (66.7%) of
patients.
Patients with intracranial bleeding
Five out of 12 patients with primary intracranial bleed-
ing were taking high-dose dabigatran (150 mg twice
daily). However, hematoma growth could only be
documented in two patients. This is an important find-
ing, as previous data from the RE-LY trial showed that
the incidence of ICH was significantly lower in patients
on dabigatran; however, mortality was similar under
VKA or dabigatran treatment.21 In addition, data
from a subgroup of patients with intracranial hemor-
rhage were recently presented from the interim analysis
of the RE-VERSE AD trial, focusing on the ability of
idarucizumab to reverse the anticoagulant effects of
dabigatran in this patient group. The analysis showed
a rapid reversal of the anticoagulant activity and a mor-
tality rate similar to patients with non-ICH included in
the RE-VERSE AD trial.22
The mortality after idarucizumab treatment was
6.5% in this case collection of patients with hemor-
rhagic stroke as compared to 35% (D150 mg) to 41%
(D110 mg) mortality in the RE-LY trial.21 A recent
report by Purrucker and colleagues23 summarizes 61
consecutive patients with non-traumatic NOAC-asso-
ciated intracerebral bleeding. In this case cohort, the
mortality rate was 28% and hematoma expansion was
observed in 38%.
Multinational registries are necessary to quantify
effects on bleeding complications, hematoma growth,
thrombotic events, outcome and mortality in cases of
ischemic stroke and intracranial bleeding from patients
treated with dabigatran receiving idarucizumab or
other NOACs and anti-factor Xa inhibitor-antidotes
when they become available. In Germany, the
RASUNOA prime (registry of acute stroke under
novel oral anticoagulants, NCT02533960) study was
started in 2015 and plans to enroll 4000 patients with
atrial fibrillation receiving vitamin K antagonists,
NOAC or no therapy and suffering from ischemic or
hemorrhagic stroke. They will be monitored for acute
treatment and hematoma characteristics. With the case
series reported here, we hope to encourage activities in
other countries to evaluate and further develop guide-
lines for the treatment of cerebrovascular complications
under NOAC therapy.
In summary, our case collection illustrates:
1. Intravenous thrombolysis with rt-PA after antago-
nizing dabigatran with idarucizumab is feasible,
easy to manage in an emergency room or stroke-
unit setting, appears to be safe and should there-
fore be considered in cases where ischemic stroke
occurs in patients under effective dabigatran
therapy.
2. Idarucizumab application appears to prevent
hematoma growth and might reduce mortality
and/or improve outcome in cases of hemorrhagic
stroke or intracranial hemorrhage and should
therefore be given in all patients presenting with
intracranial bleeding and effective dabigatran
anticoagulation.
Clearly, this study has limitations with regard to the
small number of patients included in the analysis and
the retrospective nature of the study. However, this
case collection of administration of idarucizumab in
acute neurological emergencies displays the largest
real world experience available to date. Thus, this
case collection adds important clinical information
until further robust data from large prospective regis-
tries will be available.
