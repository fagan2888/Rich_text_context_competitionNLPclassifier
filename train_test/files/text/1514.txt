Abstract To improve understanding about genetic and
environmental influences on antisocial behavior (ASB),
we tested the association of the 44-base pair polymorphism
of the serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) and mal-
treatment using latent class analysis in 2,488 boys and girls
from Wave 1 of the National Longitudinal Study of
Adolescent Health. In boys, ASB was defined by three
classes (Exclusive Covert, Mixed Covert and Overt, and No
Problems) whereas in girls, ASB was defined by two
classes (Exclusive Covert, No Problems). In boys, 5-
HTTLPR and maltreatment were not significantly related
to ASB. However, in girls, maltreatment, but not 5-
HTTLPR, was significantly associated with ASB. A
significant interaction between 5-HTTLPR and maltreat-
ment was also observed, where maltreated girls homozy-
gous for the short allele were 12 times more likely to be
classified in the Exclusive Covert group than in the No
Problems group. Structural differences in the latent struc-
ture of ASB at Wave 2 and Wave 3 prevented repeat LCA
modeling. However, using counts of ASB, 5-HTTLPR,
maltreatment, and its interaction were unrelated to overt
and covert ASB at Wave 2 and only maltreatment was
related to covert ASB at Wave 3. We discuss these findings
within the context of sex differences in ASB and relevant
models of gene-environment interplay across developmen-
tal periods.

Antisocial behavior (ASB) is defined by acts that violate
established norms/rules (e.g., truancy, curfew), aggression
resulting in interpersonal harm (e.g., violence, assault), or
property damage (e.g., fire setting) (Dishion and Patterson
2006). ASB is one of the most common referrals for youth
mental health services in the United States (Kazdin et al.
2006). Disruptive behavior disorders, including oppositional
defiant disorder (ODD) and attention-deficit/hyperactivity
disorder (ADHD), were the most prevalent disorders in an
epidemiological sample of 4 year-old children (Lavigne et al.
2009). Externalizing behavior is clinically significant be-
cause it strongly predicts academic failure and adult
psychopathology (e.g., antisocial personality disorder) and
it is highly persistent over time (Farrington 1995). In fact,
stability estimates for aggression and ASB are comparable to
IQ, which has long been considered as one of the most stable
individual attributes (Olweus 1979). ASB is also responsible
for significant economic consequences. In the United States,
the cost of health care, academic support, and juvenile justice
was approximately $70,000 more for youths with conduct
disorder (CD) than youth without CD over a seven year
period (Foster and Jones 2005). Thus, ASB is an important
constellation of problems with clinical and public health
significance.
Existing models have differentiated dimensions of ASB
based on separable risk factors, underlying mechanisms,
and divergent patterns of association, including overt (e.g.,
fighting, bullying) and covert (e.g., lying, stealing) ASB
(Loeber and Schmaling 1985; Frick et al. 1993). In a study
of 391 preschool children, overt ASB was more strongly
associated with hyperactivity, conduct problems, and

classroom conflict than covert ASB (Willoughby et al.
2001). In two separate samples of boys and girls with and
without ADHD, a laboratory measure of childhood covert
ASB prospectively predicted adolescent delinquency sever-
ity 4­5 years later, controlling for initial ADHD, overt
aggression, and noncompliance (Lee and Hinshaw 2004,
2006). A recent meta-analysis also suggests that genetic
influences are substantially stronger for overt ASB than for
covert ASB (Burt 2009).
ASB also shows divergent patterns of association based
on its age of onset. Moffitt (1993) proposed two distinct
types of antisocial youth: life-course-persistent (LCP) and
adolescent-limited (AL). The LCP pathway is significantly
heritable, frequently comorbid with ADHD, and correlated
with physical aggression, neuropsychological deficits, and
parent psychopathology (Aguilar et al. 2000; Moffitt and
Caspi 2001). There is also evidence that LCP children have
higher levels of callous and unemotional traits (e.g., low
guilt, lack of empathy, less sensitive to punishment), which
is also predictive of aggression and delinquency (Frick et
al. 2003). In contrast, the AL pathway is associated with a
post-pubertal onset of ASB, desistance by late adolescence,
relatively few child and family risk factors, and a
predominance of non-aggressive offending (e.g., status
offenses). This pathway is driven predominantly by social
processes (e.g., deviant peer influences) and personality
factors (e.g., sensation seeking) (Moffitt 1993). Evidence of
a third subtype of ASB has also emerged (Moffitt et al.
2008). Compared to LCP and AL youth, Odgers et al.
(2008) found that the childhood-limited group had more
child conduct problems, but that these behaviors declined
by mid-adolescence. The prognosis for this group is poorly
understood, however (Odgers et al. 2007).
Sex Differences in ASB
Although some theories of ASB converge with patterns of
ASB observed in girls (Keenan et al. 1999), most studies
have focused on boys (Lahey et al. 1999), despite important
sex differences (Loeber and Stouthamer-Loeber 1998;
Silverthorn and Frick 1999). For example, girls are less
physically aggressive than boys (Silverthorn and Frick
1999) and CD is two- to four-times more common in boys
than in girls (Cohen et al. 1993). However, sex differences
in ASB narrow significantly by early adolescence with
girls, whose ASB begins in adolescence, showing worse
outcomes than boys with a similar onset (Fergusson et al.
2005). This convergence is largely explained by girls
engaging in non-aggressive ASB, including relational
ASB (i.e., spreading rumors, gossip, ostracizing peers) that
are comparable to boys. For example, in the Dunedin birth
cohort, rates of non-aggressive ASB were equivalent in
boys and girls at age 15, but boys were 3­4 times more
physically aggressive than girls (Moffitt et al. 2001). In
another study of 13,000 5­11 year-old children, girls and
boys were equal in physical aggression at age 5, but by age
11, female aggression decreased whereas aggression in
boys remained stable (Lee et al. 2007). Hipwell et al.
(2002) found that older girls showed higher rates of
oppositional/defiant behaviors and relational aggression
than younger girls in a community sample of 2,451 girls
(aged 5 to 8), suggesting that non-aggressive ASB increases
with age in girls. Overall, the literature suggests that age of
onset and the type of ASB are central to understanding
ASB across development.
Latent Class Analysis
Empirically-derived approaches that identify subgroups of
antisocial youth are heuristic for several reasons, including
the value of person-centered strategies (Bergman and
Magnusson 1997). Taxonomies traditionally assume homo-
geneity within a group, although thresholds may be
arbitrary or inaccurate (Schwartz et al. 2001). For example,
children who fall just short of diagnostic criteria for CD and
ODD are equally impaired as children who meet full
criteria (Levin 2008). Similarly, frequent comorbidity
challenges the assumption of homogeneity within a single
disorder, as evidenced by the fact that adolescents with CD
frequently have comorbid ADHD, anxiety, and substance
disorders (Loeber and Keenan 1994). Compared to single-
disorder and non-disordered cases, individuals with comor-
bidity have worse health outcomes, are more treatment
resistant, and more functionally impaired (Newman et al.
1998). Thus, single-disorder contrasts (e.g., CD vs. con-
trols) may exaggerate effect sizes because of high comor-
bidity and they may arbitrarily define groups based on
theory and clinical observation. However, empirically-
driven approaches have identified groups based on ASB
severity and clinical presentation that are not reflected in
current diagnostic approaches (Lee et al. 2007; De Nijs et
al. 2007; Reinke et al. 2008).
To complement traditional group-based approaches,
latent class analysis (LCA) creates a taxonomy based on
similar patterns of responses (McCutcheon 1987). Individ-
uals within the same latent class are homogenous and
distinct from other classes, provided the indicator variables
are locally independent (Magidson and Vermunt 2004).
LCA is a relatively anonymous approach where the number
of classes is determined through an iterative process where
the best fitting model determines the number of indepen-
dent classes (Magidson and Vermunt 2004). LCA is a more
"person-centered" approach, where groups of individuals
are prioritized rather than traditional approaches that
790 J Abnorm Child Psychol (2010) 38:789­801
prioritize variable-centered models (e.g., regression). In
addition, LCA allows modeling predictors of class mem-
bership and the use of covariates (Walrath et al. 2004).
Despite these benefits, there are few published LCA studies
of ASB. De Nijs et al. (2007) conducted LCA of the
Attention Problems, Aggression, and Rule-Breaking
Behaviors scales of the Child Behavior Checklist on
1,965 11- to 18-year-old boys and girls referred to
university clinics and mental health agencies. Six distinct
classes emerged with support for ADHD subtypes, but not
for separate aggressive or rule-breaking subtypes. The
failure to identify distinct aggressive and rule-breaking
dimensions may have been due to referral bias (e.g., clinic-
referred youth have an earlier age of onset of problems,
more severe psychopathology and impairment) that ulti-
mately obscured these two classes (Goodman et al. 1997).
Reinke et al. (2008) utilized LCA with 678 low-income
African-American children and found that boys were best
characterized by 4 unique classes (Academic Problems,
Behavior Problems, Academic and Behavior Problems,
and No Problems). Girls were similarly characterized,
only without the Behavior Problems group. Girls and
boys in the combined group of academic and behavior
problems had significantly higher rates of social impair-
ment, suggesting that the groups derived demonstrated
expected patterns of association with other domains.
However, none of these studies tested specific predictors
of group membership.
Serotonin Transporter Gene (5-HTTLPR)
Genes that regulate serotonin (5-HT) are implicated in
aggression across diverse experimental methods and
model systems. Although 5-HT functioning has been
extensively studied, the precise relationship between 5-
HT levels and aggression remains unclear (Carrillo et al.
2009). Some studies of 5-HT transporter knockout mice
suggest that lower levels of 5-HT in limbic and hypotha-
lamic regions increase aggression (Gibbons et al. 1997;
Holmes et al. 2002). Low cerebrospinal spinal fluid of
5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), which metabolizes
5-HT, has also been associated with aggression in non-
human primates (Higley et al. 1996), children with ODD
and CD (Van Goozen et al. 1999), and adults with a
history of violence (Brown et al. 1979). Conversely, other
studies have found that increased 5-HT transmission
increases aggression and violent suicidal ideation among
depressed, anxious, bipolar, and psychotic patients (Car-
rillo et al. 2009). Whereas most studies reported an
inhibitory effect of 5-HT on aggression (Carrillo et al.
2009), this effect is influenced by the type of aggression
assayed as well as other neural and psychosocial factors.
For example, in animal models, 5-HT neurotransmission
increased aggression if it was induced by social isolation
or stress (i.e., reactive-retaliatory aggression), but it
inhibited aggression if the animal was predatory (i.e.,
proactive-instrumental aggression) (Carrillo et al. 2009).
Other neural mechanisms may also be crucial in the
context of 5-HT and aggression; for instance, immediately
following an attack, mice responded with an increase
in prefrontal dopaminergic neurotransmission and a
corresponding decrease in 5-HT functioning (Van Erp
and Miczek 2000).
The serotonin transporter gene (5-HTTLPR) is of
particular interest to ASB because it transcribes proteins
which regulate the availability of 5-HT in the brain. In
humans, 5-HTTLPR is located on chromosome 17q12 and
consists of a 44 base pair (bp) polymorphism, resulting in
short (S) and long (L) alleles (Lesch et al. 1996). 5-
HTTLPR is particularly important to the amygdala, a
structure critical to emotion regulation and fear processes
(LeDoux 2000), with a recent meta-analysis estimating that
5-HTTLPR accounted for as much as 10% of the variance
in amygdala activation (Munafò et al. 2008). Neuroimaging
studies have consistently reported that the S allele is
associated with hyper-reactivity of the amygdala, which is
associated with decreased 5-HT transporter functionality
(Hariri et al. 2002). Individuals with CD, aggressive traits,
and histories of violence are more likely to carry the S
allele (Liao et al. 2004; Haberstick et al. 2006), but null
findings have also been reported (Patkar et al. 2002; Sakai
et al. 2006). These discrepancies may be due to phenotypic
differences in these studies that included sample specific
criterion (Sakai et al. 2006), parent and teacher rating scales
(Haberstick et al. 2006), and DSM-IV criteria (Liao et al.
2004). Moreover, few studies of 5-HTTLPR have differen-
tiated aggressive and non-aggressive subtypes of ASB. A
recent study of 872 male twins found that specific forms of
overt and deceptive (e.g., steals, lies, cheats) ASB shared
similar risk genes, and that unmeasured environmental
factors differentiated their expression (Barker et al. 2009).
For example, in addition to genetic factors, negative affect
and hostile perception of others were related to aggressive,
but not rule breaking, ASB (Burt et al. 2009). A recent
meta-analysis of 34 studies found that overt and covert
aggression show significant heritability differences (as
evidenced by non-overlapping ranges on the 95% confi-
dence interval) (Burt 2009). This finding is particularly
relevant given that most individual studies of heritability of
overt and covert ASB were likely under-powered. In light
of the different conclusions suggested by the Burt (2009)
meta-analysis and the recent large study of twins by Barker
et al. (2009), it appears that the precise nature of genetic
and environmental influences on different forms of ASB is
unknown.

Gene-Environment Interaction
Environmental influences on ASB are evident by virtue of
the imperfect concordance between monozygotic twins and
because environmental conditions influence gene expres-
sion (Moffitt 2005). There is replicated evidence that
childhood maltreatment is a robust risk factor for conduct
problems, ASB, and violence (see review by Glaser 2000).
Not only is maltreatment associated with disruptions of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, hippocampus,
amygdala, cerebellum and left neocortex (Teicher et al.
2003), animal models suggest that early adversity may
influence transcription (Champagne and Curley 2005),
making it a strong candidate for gene-environment interac-
tion (G x E) studies (Moffitt 2005). Reif et al. (2007)
examined 184 adult males and found a significant associ-
ation between 5-HTTLPR genotype and violence, but only
among adults that experienced childhood adversity. Similar
results have been reported in other serotonin-related
systems, including the monoamine oxidase A (MAOA)
gene (Caspi et al. 2002; Kim-Cohen et al. 2006).
Given concerns over statistical power in genetic associ-
ation studies (i.e., small sample size, small genetic effects,
incorrectly assigning a case to a control group, or vice
versa) (Hirschhorn et al. 2002), the use of traditional
methods to model the probability of group membership
may unduly reflect scaling artifacts or extreme samples
(Uher and McGuffin 2008). Thus, LCA is superior to
traditional categorical methods because LCA classes are
unidimensional and they afford greater statistical power,
although sample size remains important to LCA (Rindskopf
2009). We are currently unaware of any study that
incorporates molecular genetic assays with latent class
analysis of ASB. Todd et al. (2005) analyzed a pooled
sample of three ADHD studies; two community-based
twin samples and a third clinic- and advertisement-based
non-twin sibling sample. Using LCA, there was evidence
for eight distinct groups based on hyperactive­impulsive,
talkative, inattentive and combined symptoms. Significant
associations between the 9-repeat allele of the dopamine
transporter gene (DAT1) and the 7-repeat allele of the
dopamine receptor gene (DRD4) for the severe combined
subtype of ADHD were found, suggesting that LCA-
derived phenotypes were sensitive to genetic effects.
Crucially, these genetic effects were not evident when
traditional phenotypic definitions were used (e.g., diag-
nostic groups). Using a large sample of adolescents and
young adults who self-reported ASB, we had the follow-
ing aims: (1) To characterize the latent structure of
antisocial youth, separately for boys and girls, using latent
class analysis (LCA) and (2) To test the association of 5-
HTTLPR genotype and maltreatment on latent class
membership.
Method
Participants
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add
Health Harris et al. 2008) ascertained a stratified random
sample of youth from U.S. high schools. Details of the study
design can be obtained at http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/
addhealth. 20,745 adolescents were interviewed at Wave 1
(grades 7­12, ages 12­20 years during the 1994­1995 school
year; 47.5% male). Genetic data were obtained five years later
from full siblings and twins only. We analyzed the genetic
subsample in Wave 1, which consisted of 2,488 adolescents
(mean age=15.6, SD=1.6, 48% male). Although adolescents
with genetic data were slightly younger (15.7 years vs.
15.6 years, respectively) [F(1,20345)=5.65, p<0.001] than
adolescents without genetic data, they did not differ signifi-
cantly with respect to gender (F(1,20345)=2.81, p=0.09) or
family income (F(1,20345)=2.35, p=0.13). Finally, although
the genetic subsample was ethnically diverse (57.5% Cauca-
sian, 14.3% Hispanic, 18.1% African-American, 7.4% Asian,
1.7% Native American, and 0.9% "Other"), we emphasize
that it is not a nationally representative sample.
Measures
ASB was ascertained during an in-home interview con-
ducted at Wave 1. Respondents reported the frequency or
presence of seven ASB items, including assault with a
weapon, vandalism, selling marijuana, breaking and enter-
ing, and theft. Because the scaling of items was inconsistent
(e.g., frequency counts, categorical), all items were con-
verted to dichotomous data.
Maltreatment was assessed retrospectively during an in-
home interview at Wave 3 when subjects were 18­26 years
old. Subjects reported the frequency of each of the following
events prior to age 12: (1) parents or adult-caregivers not
taking care of the respondent's basic needs (e.g., hygiene,
food/clothing), (2) been slapped, hit or kicked by parents or
adult care-givers, and (3) been touched in a sexual way,
forced to touch someone else in a sexual way, or forced to
have sexual relations with a parent or adult caregiver.
Following expert recommendations (Haberstick et al.
2005), if an event occurred at least once, it was scored as
positive. 64.8% of youth reported no maltreatment history
and 35.2% reported at least one episode. Individuals with
genotype data did not differ in maltreatment from individuals
without those data (F(1,14033)=0.04, p=0.84).
Genotyping
Genomic DNA was isolated from buccal cells using
standard methods. The primer sequences were: forward,
792 J Abnorm Child Psychol (2010) 38:789­801
5-GGCGTTGCCGCTCTGAATGC-3 (fluorescently la-
beled), and reverse, 5- 46 GAGGGACTGAGCTGGA
CAACCAC-3. These primer sequences yield products of
484 or 528 bp (Heils et al. 1996). The long variant (528 bp)
has approximately three times the basal activity of the
shorter promoter (484 bp) with the deletion (Lesch et al.
1996). We followed previous strategies (Cicchetti et al.
2007) by comparing three genotypes with the following
distributions: SS (20%), SL (46.5%), and LL (33.5%).
Statistical Analyses
LCA was conducted in Mplus 4.0 (Muthen and Muthen
2006) using the mixture analysis command. To construct
the best fitting LCA model, we started with a single class
solution and fit successive models with an additional class
until the best fitting model was indicated. We report the
Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) value given that it is
more robust than other statistical indices (Nylund et al.
2007), as well as the adjusted BIC. To identify the best
model fit, we selected the model with the smallest BIC
value (Collins et al. 1993). We then added covariates (age,
race-ethnicity, family income) and predictors (5-HTTLPR,
maltreatment, and their interaction). Models were con-
structed separately for boys and girls based on the
significant difference between sex and latent class mem-
bership for the best fitting 2-class solution (2=39.85, df=
1, p<0.01). In addition, because the architecture of ASB in
girls is not well known (Eley et al. 1999), we used log-
linear regression in SAS PROC GENMOD (specifying
Poisson distributions) to analyze separate counts of overt
and covert ASB to supplement LCA. Finally, to capitalize on
the repeated measures design and to identify the latent
structure of ASB at different points in development, we
utilized the identical data analytic strategies described above
at Wave 1 (LCA and log-linear regression of overt and
covert ASB separately in boys and girls) again for Wave 2
(1 year follow-up) and Wave 3 (6­7 year follow-up).
Results
Population Stratification
We tested the association of genotype and race-ethnicity
because allele frequencies for 5-HTTLPR are known to
vary by race-ethnicity (Gelernter et al. 1999). 5-HTTLPR
genotypes were non-randomly distributed by race-ethnicity
in the overall sample (2=2.22, df=10, p<0.01), but they
were not significantly associated with LCA class member-
ship in males (=0.44, SE=0.11, p=0.66), and females
(=-0. 13, SE=0.14, p=0.35), thus minimizing the
possibility of population stratification (Hutchison et al.
2004). However, because race-ethnicity is associated with
ASB (Petras et al. 2004), we included this as a covariate in
all models.
Latent Class Models for Girls and Boys
LCA fit indices for latent class solutions of girls and boys
are summarized in Table 1. For girls, a 2-class solution was
optimal (BIC=2,531.73). When a third class was added, the
BIC and adjusted BIC increased, suggesting a worse model
fit. For boys, the 3-class solution was the best fit to the data
(BIC=3,758.79). When a 4-class solution was tested, the
increase in BIC suggested that the stability of the classes
decreased relative to the original 3-class model.
Figure 1 shows the prevalence of group membership and
probabilities for girls. Class 1, which accounted for 91% of
girls, was characterized by low probabilities for ASB (No
Problems). However, 8.8% of girls fell into Class 2
(Exclusive Covert), characterized by significantly higher
probabilities for endorsing covert forms of ASB [vandalism
(0.79), breaking and entering (0.45), and selling marijuana
(0.28)] but low probabilities for overt ASB [pulling a knife
or gun on someone (0.10) and shooting or stabbing
someone (0.04)]. Unlike boys, there was no evidence of a
third class for girls (e.g., mixed covert and overt).
Figure 2 shows the prevalence of class membership and
the probability of positively endorsing an item in boys.
Nearly 85% of boys fell into Class 1, characterized by
minor ASB (No Problems). These individuals had low
probabilities for endorsing vandalism (0.18), stealing
(<0.01), threatening other people with a weapon (<0.01),
and pulling a knife or gun on someone (<0.01). Class 2
(Exclusive Covert) consisted of 10.6% of boys with higher
probabilities for covert ASB [vandalism (0.79), stealing
(0.34) and selling marijuana (0.32)] but low probabilities
for overt ASB [pull a knife a gun on someone (<0.01),
shoot or stab someone (<0.01)]. 4.5% of boys fell into
Class 3, who had high probabilities for covert and overt
ASB (Mixed ASB group): stealing (0.65), selling marijuana
(0.52), threatening someone with a weapon (0.64), and
pulling a knife or gun on someone (0.89).
Predicting Latent Class Membership
We then modeled the probability of class membership using
latent class multinomial regression (Table 2). We first
compared the probability of membership in the Exclusive
Covert group vs. No Problems group in girls. Although 5-
HTTLPR genotype was not significantly related to class
membership (=0.62, SE=0.52, p=0.24), there were
significant effects for maltreatment (=2.49, SE=1.05,
p=0.02) and its interaction with 5-HTTLPR genotype (=
-1.98, SE=0.77, p<0.01) in predicting membership in the
J Abnorm Child Psychol (2010) 38:789­801 793
Exclusive Covert group. Among maltreated girls with the
SS genotype, the odds of being in the Exclusive Covert
group were 12 times higher than the odds of being in the
No Problems group. In contrast, the odd ratios (Exclusive
Covert vs. No Problems) for the SL (1.67) and LL groups
(2.77) were both not significantly related to the probability
of being in the Exclusive Covert group. There were also
no significant genotype effects for girls that were not
maltreated.
Using a parallel analytic strategy for boys, we first
compared the Mixed ASB to the No Problems group
(Table 3). Maltreatment (=0.39, SE=0.92, p=0.67), 5-
HTTLPR genotype (=-0.37, SE=0.51, p=0.47) and its
interaction (=0.67, SE=1.27, p=0.60) were not signifi-
cantly related to class membership. Next, comparing the
Exclusive Covert to the No Problems group, there were no
significant effects for maltreatment, 5-HTTLPR genotype,
and their interaction (=-0.24, SE=1.25, p=0.85; =
0.00, SE=0.57, p=0.99; =1.76, SE=1.58, p=0.27,
respectively). In addition, we note that when the interaction
terms were not included in the models, the effects for 5-
HTTLPR and maltreatment were not significant for boys or
girls (data available upon request).
Finally, because passive gene-environment correlation
(rGE) can complicate the interpretation of G x E (Jaffee and
Price 2007), we explored whether genotype was signifi-
cantly associated with maltreatment. After controlling for
age, race-ethnicity, family income and sex, maltreatment
was unrelated with 5-HTTLPR genotype (r=-0.007, df=
1,803, p=0.77), thereby reducing concerns that passive
rGE confounded the observed interaction.
Predicting Counts of ASB
To provide an additional characterization of variability in
ASB, we analyzed counts of overt and covert ASB at
Wave 1 (i.e., sum of positive endorsements for each item)
using log-linear regression (SAS PROC GENMOD) based

on 5-HTTLPR genotype, maltreatment, and their interaction
(controlling for age, race-ethnicity and family income).
Among boys, genotype and maltreatment were not signif-
icantly related to covert ASB (=0.12, SE=0.40, p=0.76
and =-0.70, SE=0.56, p=0.21, respectively) and overt
ASB (=0.08, SE=0.59, p=0.88 and =-0.20, SE=0.96,
p=0.84, respectively). In addition, the interaction between
genotype and maltreatment was not significantly predictive
of covert and overt ASB (=-0.03, SE=0.04, p=0.94 and
=-0.37, SE=0.76, p=0.62, respectively). However, in
girls, there was a significant effect for genotype for covert
ASB (=0.56, SE=0.25, p=0.02), but not for maltreatment
(=0.62, SE=0.41, p=0.13). The interaction between
genotype and maltreatment was also significant for covert
ASB (=-0.54, SE=0.27, p=0.05). For overt ASB in girls,
the effects for genotype and maltreatment were not signif-
icant (=0.81, SE=0.58, p=0.16 and =0.36, SE=1.12, p
=0.75), but their interaction was significant (=-1.82, SE=
0.82, p<0.05). Post-hoc probing of the interactions sug-
gested that the association between 5-HTTLPR genotype
and covert ASB was only significant for girls with a
maltreatment history (=0.50, SE=0.22, p=0.02), although
the same simple effect was not evident for overt ASB (=
0.78, SE=0.58, p=0.17). For girls that were not maltreated,
the relationship between 5-HTTLPR and ASB was not
significant for covert ASB (=0.02, SE=0.27, p=0.93) and
overt ASB (=-1.11, SE=0.62, p=0.07).
We then extended the same analytic approach (log-linear
regression with identical covariates) to counts of covert and
overt ASB at Wave 2 (1 year follow-up) and Wave 3 (6­
7 year follow-up) separately for boys and girls. For boys at
Wave 2, 5-HTTLPR and maltreatment were unrelated to
covert ASB (=-0.04, SE=0.22, p=0.85 and =-0.26,
SE=0.56, p=0.64, respectively) and overt ASB (=-0.37,
SE=0.44, p=0.40 and =-0.77, SE=0.89, p=0.38,
respectively). Similarly, for girls at Wave 2, 5-HTTLPR
and maltreatment were not significant predictors of covert
ASB (=-0.38, SE=0.27, p=0.16 and =0.25, SE=0.56,
p=0.65, respectively) and overt ASB (=0.45, SE=1.05,
p=0.67 and =0.68, SE=1.77, p=0.70, respectively).
Moreover, genotype x maltreatment interaction was not
significant for overt ASB (=0.87, SE=1.18, p=0.46 and
=-0.90, SE=1.67, p=0.59 for boys and girls, respec-
tively) and covert ASB (=-0.01, SE=0.51, p=0.98 and
=-0.37, SE=0.45, p=0.42, for boys and girls, respec-
tively). For boys at Wave 3, maltreatment significantly
predicted covert ASB (=-1.36, SE=0.58, p<0.05), but 5-
HTTLPR did not (=-0.25, SE=0.31, p=0.43). However,

Latent Structure of ASB Across Development
To investigate the structure of ASB at additional develop-
mental periods, we conducted LCA for ASB at Wave 2 and
Wave 3. LCA of ASB data at Wave 2 revealed that a 2-class
solution optimally characterized boys (BIC=2,893.70) and
girls (BIC=2,030.50). Relative to Wave 1, ASB in boys at
Wave 2 consisted of Mixed ASB and No ASB groups only
(LCA no longer derived an Exclusive Covert ASB class).
For girls, the latent class structure at Wave 2 approximated
their structure at Wave 1 (Exclusive Covert and No ASB
groups). At Wave 3, only a single latent class was detected
for boys and girls.
Discussion
To improve traction on the underlying structure of ASB, we
used latent class analysis (LCA) to empirically derive
groups of adolescents based on their self-reported ASB.
Our analyses yielded several key findings: (1) Boys and
girls differed in the number of empirically distinct groups,
with boys being optimally characterized by three classes
(No Problems, Exclusive Covert, and Mixed Covert and
Overt) whereas girls consisted of two classes (No Problems,
Exclusive Covert); (2) Maltreatment was significantly
related to the likelihood of Exclusive Covert ASB class
membership for girls, but not for boys; and (3) In girls, the
influence of maltreatment and Exclusive Covert ASB status
was moderated by 5-HTTLPR genotype. Among maltreated
girls, the SS genotype conferred a 12 times increase in the
odds of being in the Exclusive Covert group than in the No
Problems group. No significant interaction was found for
boys. Furthermore, genotype and maltreatment were not
significantly related with age, sex, family income, and race-
ethnicity controlled, thereby reducing the likelihood of
passive rGE. Finally, when ASB was assessed separately at
each wave across 6­7 years of development, we found that
the number of ASB classes derived decreased over time for
girls and boys. At Wave 2, boys and girls were similarly
characterized by two latent classes: for boys, Exclusive
Covert was no longer identified by LCA whereas the
structure of ASB in girls was similar to Wave 1. However,
by Wave 3, a single class solution characterized ASB in
boys and girls. The results suggest that overt and covert
forms of ASB are distinct in boys, but covert ASB prevails
in girls. These findings extend earlier factor-analytic studies
by Loeber and Schmaling (1985) and Frick et al. (1993) by
demonstrating that covert and overt forms of ASB are not
mutually exclusive, as overtly aggressive youth often
commit more non-violent offenses than exclusively non-
violent offenders (Farrington 1998). Specifically for boys,
violent offenders were more likely to participate in covert
ASB whereas covert offenders showed more specificity in
their offending. This pattern may be due to stronger genetic
influences for overt/aggressive ASB than covert/non-ag-
gressive ASB (Burt 2009). Moreover, there is considerable
genetic and phenotypic overlap between overt and covert
ASB (Willoughby et al. 2001), although there are also
unique genetic influences. Some genes may be specific to
overt ASB, although these investigations are still in their
infancy (Burt 2009). Our findings on the structural changes

in ASB from adolescence to adulthood reflect prevailing
theories about the reliable decrease in the frequency of ASB
and the number of offenders from adolescence to early
adulthood (Moffitt 1993). Alternatively, the processes
underlying adolescent ASB may be expressed in different
behaviors not captured by this particular assessment. For
example, substance use disorders may be more prominent
in early adulthood relative to developmentally-sensitive
forms of ASB and delinquency (Glantz et al. 2009).
For girls, ASB was exclusively covert in nature, with no
empirically-derived group of overt offenders. In this large
sample of girls, the absence of an overt class of ASB is
consistent with previous reviews (Keenan et al. 1999; Eley
et al. 1999; Archer 2004) that contend adolescent girls
engage disproportionately in non-aggressive ASB (Crick
and Zahn-Wexler 2003). Unfortunately, data on indirect
aggression were unavailable in this sample. Relational
aggression may be crucial to understand ASB in girls.
Crick and Zahn-Wexler (2003) found that 80% of girls
would not have been classified as "aggressive" without
including indirect aggression. Sex differences in empathy
may also contribute to the salience of covert ASB in girls
(Archer 2004; Keenan et al. 1999). By early adolescence,
girls express more empathy, guilt, and rumination than boys
following a conflict and may be less likely to use physical
aggression (Keenan et al. 1999). However, despite being
less overtly aggressive than boys, antisocial girls still
experience severe long-term consequences in adulthood,
including significant mental health, physical health, and
economic problems (Odgers et al. 2008), reflecting a
greater need to understand mediators of outcome among
covertly aggressive girls.
Importantly, we found a significant interaction between
maltreatment and 5-HTTLPR genotype in predicting
membership in the Exclusive Covert ASB group for girls,
but not for boys. In the presence of maltreatment, the SS
genotype was robustly related to ASB, with a 12 fold
increase in the odds of being in the Exclusive Covert group
than in the No Problems group. The S allele has been
consistently implicated in previous studies of ASB (Uher
and McGuffin 2008; Haberstick et al. 2006; Liao et al.
2004), given its association with decreased 5-HT transport-
er functioning (Hariri et al. 2002). However, the effect of
decreased 5-HT transporter functioning on cortical 5-HT
and subsequent ASB is not well understood (Beitchman et
al. 2006; Carrillo et al. 2009). Depleted 5-HT transporter
may be a strong risk factor for ASB in girls and 5-HTTLPR
genotype may differentially increase susceptibility to
maltreatment in girls than in boys. This may reflect
heightened sensitivity to environmental stressors. For
example, relative to boys, girls react more negatively to
family disruptions, peer problems, and stress perception
(Crick and Zahn-Wexler 2003; Keenan and Shaw 1997;
Keenan et al. 1999). In the context of peer problems, for
example, girls gain less from engaging in overt ASB,
relative to boys, because girls who engage in overtly
aggressive behaviors are often more rejected than their male
counterparts. Instead, they are more likely to gain peer
support by spreading rumors or lies, ostracizing others, and
engaging in other covert ASB (Keenan et al. 1999).
Emerging work also suggests that the S allele enhances
sensitivity to environmental conditions, both in the pres-
ence of environmentally negative and nurturing conditions
(Uher and McGuffin 2008; Belsky et al. 2009). For
example, SS homozygotes had the highest risk for
depression in combination with early childhood adversity,
but they also had the fewest symptoms of depression when
they were exposed to a positive rearing environment
(Taylor et al. 2006). Thus, putative risk genotypes may
simultaneously increase responsiveness to enriching envi-
ronments and perhaps to intervention as well. This theory
has yet to be thoroughly interrogated for ASB and other
phenotypes. Consequently, we await further tests that genes
concurrently influence responsiveness to environmental
adversity and nurturance.
Although our LCA uncovered distinct latent classes for
ASB in boys and girls, we supplemented the LCA approach
with log-linear regression models using counts of overt and
covert ASB. Notably, even when count data were used to
characterize ASB in girls at Wave 1, there was a significant
main effect for 5-HTTLPR genotype for covert ASB and a
significant interaction between 5-HTTLPR genotype and
maltreatment for both overt and covert ASB. Crucially,
LCA and log-linear models both indicated that genotype
and covert ASB at Wave 1 was associated only in
maltreated girls. However, to more thoroughly assess
potential for G x E effects across development, we
constructed identical log-linear models of overt and covert
ASB at Wave 2 and Wave 3 using maltreatment, genotype,
and their interaction. Unlike Wave 1, there was no effect of
maltreatment, genotype, or their interaction on overt and
covert ASB at Wave 2. Similarly, at Wave 3, there was only
evidence of maltreatment effects on covert ASB in boys
and girls, but no evidence of genotype or G x E effects.
Thus, the G x E effects on ASB was limited to Wave 1
when participants were 12­20 years. Finally, our LCA at
Wave 3 revealed no distinguishable latent classes for ASB
for either sex, suggesting that a distinction between covert
and overt ASB may not be empirically warranted later in
development (e.g., adulthood).
We emphasize several important limitations to our study.
First, ASB was ascertained through self-report, which may
underestimate ASB (Huizinga and Elliot 1986). Youth with
severe ASB are known to be elusive in some studies
because they are uncooperative and absent from school/
home (Farrington 1998). Additional informants and sources
J Abnorm Child Psychol (2010) 38:789­801 797
of ASB (e.g., official records) may improve measurement
accuracy (Caspi et al. 2002; Jaffee et al. 2004). In addition,
childhood maltreatment was assessed retrospectively, which
may be influenced by mood states or psychopathology,
inaccurate recall, and/or lack of trust. However, Smith et al.
(2008) compared self-reported maltreatment with official
state records of maltreatment and found that both methods
predicted antisocial outcomes in adolescence/adulthood, but
combining the measures did not improve predictive
validity. Second, to correct discrepancies in item response
types (e.g., count vs. dichotomous), we dichotomized all
responses. This may have reduced variance and statistical
power. However, Farrington and Loeber (2000) contend
that dichotomization does not greatly affect the strength of
associations. Third, recent findings suggest that the Lg
allele may be transcriptionally similar to the S allele and
that both "low expressing variants" are related to childhood
aggression (Beitchman et al. 2006). However, the Lg allele
was not genotyped in this sample. Fourth, our analysis of
sex differences in the G x E effect for ASB was not
formally indicated by a significant interaction. We con-
ducted a priori analyses separately in boys and girls based
on the number of different classes (3 and 2, respectively)
indicated by LCA and a significant difference in the
distribution of sex in the best fitting 2-class model. Fifth,
although latent transition analysis (LTA) is appropriate for
ASB trajectories, LTA necessitates that items and classes
are factorially invariant across each assessment (Cumsille et
al. 2002). One option to achieve factorial invariance is to
constrain responses probabilities to specific items at each
wave (Reboussin et al. 2007), thereby ensuring class
stability. However, given the strong effect of age on ASB
(overall and in this study) and the factorial variability
across the three waves in boys and girls, this approach was
prohibitive. Nevertheless, we cannot address whether an
interaction between maltreatment and 5-HTTLPR genotype
influences class membership trajectories. Finally, we
emphasize that the G x E effects on ASB were specific to
Wave 1, suggesting that G x E may be developmentally-
specific. For example, age moderated genetic and environ-
mental influences in a meta-analysis of ASB (Rhee and
Waldman 2002). Thus, given the centrality of environmen-
tal influences on gene expression, G x E effects must be
interpreted in the context of ongoing developmental
influences.
In summary, LCA derived distinct groups of ASB
offenders in boys and girls (three and two classes,
respectively). Consistent with previous studies (Loeber
and Schmaling 1985; Frick et al. 1993), adolescent boys
were best characterized by a No Problem, Exclusive
Covert, and Mixed Overt and Covert group of offenders.
However, among girls, a 2-class model was indicated,
consisting of No Problem and Exclusive Covert groups
only. We also uncovered evidence of G x E between
maltreatment and 5-HTTLPR, but only for girls. Specifi-
cally, maltreated girls with the SS genotype of the 5-
HTTLPR gene were more likely to be in the Exclusive
Covert group than girls with different genotypes. We
anticipate that integrated models of risk, incorporating
genetic and environmental constructs with empirically-
derived groups of youth, will facilitate the development
and implementation of targeted interventions to reduce the
considerable burden associated with significant ASB.
