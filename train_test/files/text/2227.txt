ABSTRACT
Background The escalating number of persons self-injecting medications, predominantly insulin, has generated concerns that the public is at
risk of acquiring blood-borne infections from discarded needles/syringes. Communities have developed disposal guidelines but a debate
continues over the need for further legislation and/or at-home safety devices. This study examines the number, characteristics, treatment and
costs of community-acquired needlestick injuries (CANSIs).
Methods US-representative CANSI rates and characteristics were derived from 2001­08 National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All
Injury Program data on product-related injuries treated at US emergency departments (EDs). CANSI-related medical care was examined using
2003­09 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys, representing all US ED visits. Cost analyses used 2010 Current Procedural
Terminology Coding and Medicare rates.
Results In 2001­08, an estimated 16 677 CANSIs were treated in US EDs, with an associated annual rate of 0.7 per 100 000 US citizens
(95% CI 0.6­0.8) and no observable temporal trend. The estimated maximum annual medical cost of ED-treated CANSIs was $9.8 million, or
$0.03 per citizen, $1.66 per insulin-injecting person and $0.0018 per insulin injection.
Conclusions US ED-treated CANSI rates are extremely low. Stricter disposal programs and the at-home use of safety devices do not appear to
be needed at this time.

Introduction
A number of medications are now available for therapeutic
self-injection, including epinephrine, in prefilled, auto-
injector syringes, for prevention of anaphylaxis. The 2007
US National Home and Hospice Care Survey found that 5
of 10 000 home healthcare patients used these devices.1
This figure is dwarfed by the number of individuals who
self-inject insulin. In 2010, an estimated 6.4% of the world's
adult population--285 million people--had diabetes melli-
tus. By 2030, that will grow to 7.8%.2 Between 1980 and
2010, the number of civilian, non-institutionalized Americans
with diabetes mellitus rose from 5.6 to 20.9 million.3 In 2010,
an estimated 5.7 million US adults with diagnosed diabetes
were taking insulin.4,5 These and similar data have generated
concerns that syringes/needles discarded in residential and
public settings may place the general public at increasing risk
of blood-borne infections--in particular, hepatitis B virus
(HBV), hepatitis C virus (HCV) and human immunodefi-
ciency virus (HIV).6­8
The relationships among diabetes mellitus, HBV, HCV
and HIV are multidirectional and do not necessarily translate
into greater prevalence of these infections in all diabetic
populations. HCV infection, HIV infection and associated
protease inhibitor therapy can lead to hyperglycemia and
insulin-requiring type 2 diabetes.9,10 HBV vaccine coverage
is inadequate in US adults, and the risk of acute HBV infec-
tion is higher in adults with type 2 diabetes.11 HBV and
HCV outbreaks associated with shared glucose-monitoring

equipment and breaks in glucose-monitoring-associated
infection-control practices have occurred in long-term-care
communities.12 Outbreaks have not been reported in associ-
ation with EpiPens or insulin syringes/pens.
Local communities, organizations and various government
bodies have instituted guidelines and recommendations for
safe needle/sharp disposal, with the goal of preventing
community-acquired needlestick injuries (CANSIs). In the
USA, there is an ongoing debate about whether further legis-
lation is needed13­15 and various companies are marketing
safety and `needless' devices for at-home use. Similar devices
helped decrease healthcare workers' risk of needlestick injur-
ies,16,17 but at considerable cost.
This study examines CANSIs treated at US hospital emer-
gency departments (EDs) to assess: (i) their characteristics
and incidence, (ii) whether their rate is increasing, (iii) the
associated medical care and (iv) the estimated maximum
cost of that care.
Methods
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All
Injury Program (NEISS-AIP), operated by the Office
of Statistics and Programming (OSP), National
Center for Injury Prevention and Control, US
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
and the US Consumer Product Safety Commission
(CPSC)
NEISS-AIP provides nationally representative incidence esti-
mates of non-fatal injuries treated in US hospital EDs,
based on injury-related visits at 66 of 100 NEISS hospitals,
a national stratified probability sample of hospitals with six
or more beds and a 24-h ED. Strata include children's hos-
pitals and four general hospital size strata defined by annual
number of ED visits.18 Each case is assigned a sample
weight; these are summed to provide national estimates.
Miscodings are minimized by: weekly reviews of random
samples of written narratives abstracted verbatim from the
medical record, five trained coders visually reviewing narra-
tives and coded data elements for every NEISS-AIP case,
CPSC supervisors visiting each hospital once or twice yearly
and blindly abstracting from the records of a random
sample of ED cases and extensive batch edits on the final
dataset. NEISS-AIP personnel estimate that ,1% of
records, on average, are miscoded (personal communication,
J. L. Annest, 17 July 2012).
NEISS-AIP analyses herein include all 2001­08 records
with NEISS product code 1716 (`hypodermic needles and
syringes') and/or comments with the letter strings:
`hypodermic', `needle', `needlestick', `needle-stick', `needle
stick', `percutaneous injur', `sharp injur', `sharps injur' or
`syringe' and without comments, indicating that the injury
was related to occupational activities, receipt or provision of
professional healthcare, medical training, drug use, lancets
or non-medical needles. Of note, inadvertent inclusion of
records related to these activities would bias toward an over-
estimation of CANSI rates. NEISS-AIP data and associated
medical records cannot be accessed by non-NEISS research-
ers. OSP personnel performed my specified record selec-
tions and SAS runs.
US National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care
Surveys (NHAMCS), directed by the National
Center for Health Statistics (NCHS), CDC
The elements and levels of CANSI-associated ED medical
service, procedures, treatment and medication were deter-
mined using publicly available 2003­09 NHAMCS files.19,20
NHAMCS include a four-stage systematic random sample
of all injury- and non-injury-related patient visits to
non-Federal hospitals, during randomly assigned 4-week
reporting periods. Trained hospital personnel complete
patient record forms, which are reviewed and validated by
NCHS staff and include data on the patient's complaint(s),
cause of the injury, diagnostic/screening services, medical
procedures, medications, types of providers seen, discharge
diagnoses, follow-up disposition (if any) and expected
source(s) of payment.19,20 NCHS field representatives review
the logs used for visit sampling to determine whether any
cases were missed and edit completed forms for missing
data, which is sought through consultation with hospital
staff and medical record review. Quality control for the
medical and drug coding operation, as well as straight-key
items, includes a two-way, 10% independent verification pro-
cedure. All forms with coding variations or illegible entries
related to the reason for a visit, diagnostic and therapeutic
procedures, diagnosis, International Classification of
Diseases (ICD) diagnosis E codes, or medication items are
reviewed and adjudicated at NCHS.
I could not access medical records, but I used the follow-
ing four-step process to select and internally validate the
cases used in the NHAMCS analyses herein: (i) I examined
each 2003­09 NHAMCS ED case with ICD-9-CM diagno-
sis E codes even vaguely consistent with the possibility of a
needlestick/sharp injury (E920.5, E920.8, E920.9, E928.8,
E928.9, E986, E988.8, E988.9 and E989). (ii) NHAMCS's
descriptive variable (`vcause') can be used to provide event
details. I examined vcause in each selected record and, if it
indicated the injury involved healthcare or intentional action,
US COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED NEEDLESTICK INJURIES 423
I excluded it from the analyses. (iii) If the `payment source'
variable was coded as `Worker's Compensation', I excluded
the record from analyses. (iv) If the `work-related' (`workrel')
variable was marked `yes' and this was consistent with the
vcause and payment source coding, I excluded the record from
analyses. For 16 records, workrel was coded `yes', payment
was not through worker's compensation and vcause did not
suggest that the injury was work-related. Those 16 records
were included in the NHAMCS CANSI analyses. Since
NHAMCS data were used solely to characterize CANSI-
related medical treatment and costs, this did not affect the
CANSI incidence estimate. Fifty-one NHAMCS records
met the criteria for the CANSI analyses.
In 2004 and 2005, NHAMCS and the NCHS's National
Ambulatory Medical Care Surveys (NAMCSs) collected nee-
dlestick injury data from outpatient departments and physi-
cians' offices. I examined those data and determined that, at
most, three records from outpatient departments and two
from physicians' offices might have been associated with
CANSIs. These are not included herein because (i) those
numbers of needlestick injuries were inadequate for analysis
and (ii) the data were not collected in other years.19­ 22
Cost estimates
I estimated costs associated with various elements/levels of
service using Current Procedural Terminology Coding
(CPT)23,24 and 2010 Medicare rates, with the assistance/
advice of physicians, CPT coding experts and hospital
billing officers. I based medication costs on a standard
course of therapy with generic medications, unless a particu-
lar brand name was specified in the NHAMCS record. For
each record, cost calculations took into account the specified
healthcare providers, time spent receiving care, procedures/
treatments, laboratory tests and medications.
In order to maximize the estimated cost of ED-associated
medical care, I made the following assumptions:
(i) NHAMCS forms have separate (yes/no) variables for
the following blood tests: complete blood cell count,
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, cardiac enzymes, elec-
trolytes, glucose, liver function tests, arterial blood
gases, blood alcohol, `HIV serology' (antibody status)
and `other blood test(s)'. If other blood test(s) was marked
`yes' and specified blood tests did not add up to the
specified `total number of laboratory studies done', I
assumed that HBV and HCV serology were done.
(ii) If HIV serology was blank and not marked `no' and
other blood test was marked `yes', I assumed that HIV
antibody testing was done.
(iii) If a patient's disposition was `refer to [another] phys-
ician/clinic for follow-up' or `refer to other physician',
I assumed that the referral was to an infectious disease
specialist and he/she provided an initial evaluation and
the maximum prophylaxis and follow-up recom-
mended for healthcare-associated NSIs, including
HBV immunoglobulin; HBV vaccine; HBV, HCV and
HIV serology; HIV prophylaxis (nelfinavir 1250 mg
b.i.d. Â 28 days and zidovidine 300 mg/lamivudine
150 mg b.i.d. Â 28 days); follow-up evaluation at 2­4
weeks with full serology; follow-up evaluation at 4­6
months with full serology and follow-up evaluation at
1 year with HIV serology.25 Of note, CANSIs rarely
require this full constellation of treatment and follow-
up (reference 25 and Appendix).
Other data sources
I obtained US population figures from census reports.26
Since most medical self-injections are of insulin, I used
these as a surrogate for all self-injections. Of note, this over-
estimates the per-person/per-injection cost of CANSIs. The
numbers of insulin-injecting US diabetes patients !18 years
old and insulin injections received per year were obtained
from the 2011 US Roper Diabetes Patient Market Study
Roper survey of non-military, non-institutionalized US
adults with diabetes, which estimated the annual numbers of
adults with diabetes by applying regressions of CDC's
National Health Interview Survey and Behavioral Risk
Factor Surveillance System estimates to Roper survey data
(Data provided by and cited with the permission of GfK

Data analyses
All analyses retained NEISS-AIP's and NHAMCS's weight-
ing, strata and primary sampling unit design variables and
used SAS SAS/STATw Version 9.2's survey module (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC). NEISS-AIP's sampling design permits
statistically reliable estimation if the estimate is based on
!20 records and the associated coefficient of variation is
30%; NHAMCS's design requires !30 records and an
associated standard error of the estimate of 30%.
Results
NEISS-AIP data
In 2001­08, an estimated 16 677 CANSIs required ED
treatment, for a median of 1937 per year, with no consistent
observed temporal trend in annual numbers (Table 1).
Persons ,10 and 20­39 years of age had the highest
424 JOURNAL OF PUBLIC HEALTH
CANSI rates (1.3 and 0.9 per 100 000, respectively, versus
0.6 for 10- to 19-year-olds and 0.4 for those .39 years
old). Fifty-six percent of recorded CANSIs were to women.
The type of needle was mentioned in 21% of records:
EpiPens, in 4%, and insulin syringes, in 17%.
NHAMCS data
Based on the vcause variable, 10 records with needlestick
injury-ICD codes involved an intentional injection (e.g.
therapeutic receipt of epinephrine) and 18 involved a com-
plication of illegal drug use (e.g. a drug overdose or infec-
tion at an injection site). At least 75 of these injuries were
received while the individual was providing healthcare,
working in a medical setting, or as a complication of receiv-
ing healthcare (e.g. `infiltration at the site of blood drawing').
At least 17 others were work-related. These (n ¼ 120) were
all excluded from NHAMCS analyses, leaving 51
CANSI-related records. If record inclusion had been based
solely on ICD coding, the CANSI number would have been
erroneously inflated over 3-fold (i.e. 171 versus 51).
For 26 of the 51 records, the vcause variable provided no
information other than `needle stick'. In 14 records, vcause
indicated the site of injury: finger (n ¼ 6), foot or `stepped
on a needle' (n ¼ 4), thumb (n ¼ 2), hand (n ¼ 1) and
forearm (n ¼ 1). In three records, vcause noted the injury oc-
curred while emptying garbage or handling a plastic bag;
one, walking barefoot in a hotel room; two, on a beach; one,
playing in a park and one, in an alley. In one record, vcause
noted that the source was unknown and in one, the needle
was a neighbor's. In three records, vcause referred to the
needle as `dirty' and in one, vcause noted that the patient
was concerned `it might be a drug needle and for HIV'. In
two records, vcause mentioned an EpiPen and in one, a
`syringe'.
All 51 CANSI-related NHAMCS records represented
initial visits. One patient was admitted for several hours of
observation. Three received intravenous fluids; two received
bronchodilator inhalation therapy. Two patients arrived by
ambulance. No information was available concerning the
reasons for these treatments, other than the injury code.
Forty-eight patients were treated by a physician. One
received a follow-up appointment to an associated clinic; 20
were referred to another physician. While in the ED, nine
received tetanus toxoid; two, HIV prophylaxis; two, HBV
vaccine and one, anti-HBV immunoglobulin.
Estimation of healthcare-associated costs
The median estimated cost of ED evaluation, diagnostic
studies and treatment was $575 (Table 2); the range was
$415 (for a patient who was not seen by a physician and
received no tests or medications) to $3371. When the poten-
tial costs associated with referral to infectious diseases physi-
cians were included in the calculations, the median estimated
cost of CANSI-associated medical treatment was $5078,
range $415­$6288.
Based on these median cost figures, the estimated annual
national medical costs of ED-treated CANSIs were $1.1
million for ED care alone and $9.8 million for both ED

Discussion
Main findings of this study
This study provides US-representative maximum incidence
and cost estimates for ED-treated CANSIs and has three
main findings. First, CANSI estimates should not be based
solely on ICD coding. Based on NHAMCS's descriptive
variables, doing so might overestimate actual rates by over
3-fold. Second, CANSIs requiring ED care are rare events
and require relatively minimal medical care. These findings
are consistent with and expand on those of several studies
done in local communities or health facilities in the UK,
the Netherlands and Canada.27 ­ 29 Third, although self-
administration of medications has escalated in the USA,
there has not been a concomitant increase in ED-treated
CANSIs.
What is already known on this topic
For any needlestick injury, the most critical medical question
is its likelihood of transmitting a blood-borne pathogen--
particularly HIV, HBV or HCV. Empirical data, scientific
evidence and theoretical considerations all support that
pathogen transmission from a CANSI is extraordinarily un-
likely (Appendix). The risk factors for transmission include
the involvement of a larger gauge hollow-bore needle (as
used in phlebotomy or blood sampling from a vascular line),
deep injury and/or a procedure involving a needle that was
in the artery or vein.30,31 Insulin devices and EpiPens have
small gauge needles. NHAMCS data herein support that
CANSIs are to extremities, not blood vessels. Worldwide,
there have been only three reported cases each of HBV32­34
and HCV35,36 and no documented case of HIV transmission
from non-healthcare-associated needlestick injuries.25 Two of
the HCV infections were from occupational exposure; all
three HBV transmissions were to persons without adequate
vaccination and/or post-exposure prophylaxis.
Despite this evidence, there are concerns that members
of the general public may be at increasing risk of infections
from injuries caused by: (i) used needles/syringes discarded
by persons legally self-injecting medication and (ii) disposed
needles/syringes that have been found, reused and redis-
carded by persons illegally self-injecting addictive substances
(IDUs). These concerns have led to guidelines for safe
needle/sharp disposal6­ 8,13,14 but further legislation, regula-
tions and programs are being advocated, including `take-
back programs' and `Extended Producer Responsibility' laws

aThe per-patient cost estimate was based on data extracted from 51
ED records in the 2003­09 National Hospital Ambulatory Medical Care
Surveys (NHAMCS). See the Methods section for details.
bIndividual patient costs were calculated using 2010 Medicare rates
and include all treatments, testing, radiographic studies and blood
work done in the ED. Referral costs include the projected costs
associated with the maximal care that would be provided by infectious
disease specialists (see the Methods section for details). Medical costs
that would be incurred if any patient developed HBV, HCV, HIV or
other infections, as a result of the needlestick injury, were not included
in these calculations. These costs also do not include expenses
associated with non-ambulance transportation, time lost from work,
child care needed while a patient was receiving medical care, etc.
cThe estimated median and mean total costs were calculated by
applying NHAMCS median and mean per-patient costs to the median
or mean annual number of injuries estimated from the 2001­08
National Electronic Injury Surveillance System All Injury Program
(NEISS-AIP). See the Methods section for NEISS-AIP details.

eThe number of US adult diabetes patients receiving insulin and the
number of insulin injections received in a year were estimated from
2011 Roper survey data concerning non-military, non-institutionalized
US adults (!18 years old) with diabetes, i.e. 561 000 adults with type
1 diabetes received insulin, with an average of 3.5 injections a day and
5 377 000 adults with type 2 diabetes received insulin, with an average
of 2.4 injections a day, for a total of 5.94 million insulin-injecting
adults with diabetes receiving insulin and 5.43 billion injections by
diabetic adults/year.

requiring that syringe manufacturers be responsible for
post-use disposal.15,37,38 In addition, some manufacturers are
marketing safety and `needleless' syringes for at-home use.
What this study adds
This study provides the first nationally representative data
on CANSIs, to help inform related policies and prevention
activities. These analyses indicate that, despite the ballooning
number of US persons self-injecting medications, ED-
treated CANSI rates have not increased and the associated
medical costs are relatively low.
Limitations of this study
This study is limited in the following respects. First, it
includes only US incidents. However, its results are consistent
with those of localized studies from other countries.27­29
Second, it examines only ED-treated injuries. I could not
locate any accurate data concerning the number or medical
significance of untreated CANSIs or concerning CANSIs
treated at non-ED facilities. Of note, the 2003­04 NCHS
surveys included needlestick injuries treated at outpatient
departments and physicians' offices; only five might have
been unrelated to healthcare or occupation. This suggests
that medical treatment is predominantly provided at EDs.
Third, these cost calculations do not include mental health-
care/counseling or non-medical expenses (e.g. child care
costs, travel expenses and/or income losses incurred while
obtaining medical care). Fourth, I could not externally valid-
ate these data or review the medical records of any of the
cases involved in this study. However, NEISS-AIP and
NCHS extensively validate their data18 ­ 20 and, in this study,
my selection process included internal validation checks.
Fifth, I could not determine the indications for the medical
care provided to these patients, other than what was repre-
sented by a diagnostic code. Some procedures (e.g. ambulance
transport, inhalation therapy and hospital observation) were
likely related to the patient's emotional reaction to their injury,
not the injury itself, but this could not be confirmed. Sixth,
these analyses support that ED-treated CANSIs are rare
events but, because of that rarity, these estimates are imprecise.
Seventh, it must be emphasized that the calculations herein
purposefully provide maximum estimates, to deter complaints
by legislation and safety device advocates that these data under-
represent the number and financial impact of CANSIs.
These limitations should be considered when interpreting
these estimates, but they do not negate the key finding of
this study: although the number of persons self-
administering insulin has ballooned in the past decade, there
has not been an observable increase in the incidence of
CANSIs requiring US ED treatment. Indeed, the incidence
of ED-treated CANSI was so low that statistically valid US
estimates could be derived only from NEISS-AIP, an
ongoing survey devoted to injuries. Based on these data, it
would be difficult to justify additional legislation or the
expense of using needle-free or safe-injection devices in a
community setting. Prevention of blood-borne infections
might be better served by funding HBV vaccination and
IDU syringe/needle exchange programs.

Appendix
Evidence supporting the low risk of HBV, HCV and/
or HIV transmission from a community-acquired,
non-healthcare-associated, non-occupational,
needlestick injury (CANSI)
Worldwide, there have been only three documented reports
of HBV transmission from a non-healthcare-associated nee-
dlestick injury. One case was reported in 1997, from Spain,
and involved a needlestick injury from a known HIV-
positive/HBV-positive source to a HBV-unvaccinated child
who did not receive post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP)32 (of
note, the child did not become infected with HIV). The
second HBV infection occurred in Tbilisi, Georgia, in a
woman with unknown immunization status, caring for a
mother with chronic HBV infection. It was not known if
the daughter received PEP.33 The third HBV infection oc-
curred in Australia, with seroconversion documented 2
months after a community-acquired accidental needlestick
injury, in a person with incomplete HBV vaccination and
who did not receive anti-HBV immunoglobulin.34 Three
cases of HCV transmission have been reported; two were
occupationally acquired. One occurred in Spain to a woman
cleaning a mausoleum.35 Two were reported from Australia,
one to a man doing the daily emptying of rubbish bins in a
caravan park and one to a woman walking through an inner
city car park.36 There has never been a documented case of
HIV infection occurring in a person injured by a needle dis-
carded in a public setting.25
The rarity of these case reports is not unexpected, when
one compares the characteristics of CANSIs to the known
risk determinants for HBV, HCV and HIV transmission via
a needlestick injury. These determinants are interrelated and
include: (i) the likelihood that the needle was previously
used to inject a person who was actively infectious for one
of these organisms; (ii) whether the injured person is sus-
ceptible, previously infected or vaccinated; (iii) the relative
transmissibility of the three organisms via blood, (iv) the
amount and viability of the organism transmitted, (v) the
invasiveness and severity of the injury and (vi) whether PEP,
if indicated, is provided at the time of the injury. These
determinants are reviewed in the following paragraphs.
Risk of exposure and susceptibility
The infection status of the source individual is rarely known
and often is also not known for the injured party. However,
the probabilities can be estimated using population statistics,
beginning with the national level. In the USA, all three
viruses are endemic; however, the prevalence rates in the
general population are low. HBV prevalence has declined
over the past decade,39 in large part because of the develop-
ment of an effective HBV vaccine and extensive post-natal
vaccination. HBV vaccine is recommended for the general
population but strongly encouraged for persons with dia-
betes.11 Ninety-one percent of people in the USA have re-
portedly received at least one dose of HBV vaccine but
many adults have not received the full series.11,39
HCV is the most common chronic blood-borne infection
in the USA, with a prevalence of 1.3%.40 Infected
persons are often clinically asymptomatic and can clear the
infection. In chronic infection, blood viral levels can be low
or non-detectable. Thus, a person receiving a CANSI could
already have been infected with HCV and be unaware of it.
US COMMUNITY-ACQUIRED NEEDLESTICK INJURIES 429
Only a minority of persons infected with HBV or HCV via
any route develop symptomatic or chronic infection. At this
time, there is not an effective HCV vaccine; however, there
are therapies for the treatment of clinically significant disease
and screening for infection is currently being encouraged.
The US CDC estimates that .1.1 million people in the
USA are living with HIV infection, and almost 1 in 5
(18.1%) are unaware of their infection, for a prevalence rate
of 447.8 per 100 000 population.41 The overall prevalence
of HIV infection in the USA varies by geographic area
(from 0.03% in North Dakota to 2.06% in Washington,
DC).40,42 Prevalence rates also vary greatly among subpopu-
lations within any given community (e.g. residents of a
nursing home would be far less likely to be infected with
HIV than would residents of transitional housing associated
with a drug treatment program). The principal means of
HIV transmission in the USA is through sexual contact or
sharing drug abuse equipment with an infected person.
Given this situation, a syringe/needle discarded in a location
frequented by persons illegally self-injecting addictive sub-
stances (IDUs) is more likely to be contaminated than one
contacted in a residential or general community setting.
Transmissibility through blood
In studies of healthcare personnel who sustained injuries
from needles contaminated with blood containing HBV, the
risk of developing clinical hepatitis if the blood was both
hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg)- and HBeAg-positive
was 22­31%; the risk of developing serologic evidence of
HBV infection was 37­62%.43 In comparison, the risk of
developing clinical hepatitis from a needle contaminated
with HBsAg-positive and HBeAg-negative blood was
1­6%, and the risk of developing serologic evidence of
HBV infection, 23­37%.43 Effective HBV vaccination obvi-
ates this risk and appropriate PEP of unvaccinated, exposed
persons effectively prevents infection (see below). HCV is
not transmitted efficiently through blood exposures. The
average incidence of anti-HCV seroconversion following ac-
cidental percutaneous exposure from an HCV-positive
source is 1.8% (range: 0­7%).43 For both HBV and HCV,
only a minority of persons infected via any route develop
chronic infection. For HIV, based on published
healthcare-associated HIV studies, the average risk of trans-
mission from a single exposure to known infected blood
would be, overall, 0.3%.40,44 However, this risk varies
with the nature of the exposure (see below) and, as with
HBV, prompt and appropriate HIV PEP reduces the risk of
transmission.
Viability of organisms
HBV, HCV and HIV can all survive outside the body for
hours to days, even in a dry state.40,45­ 49 However, survival
is extremely poor and it has been shown that HCV survival
is relatively poorest in insulin syringes, which have a low re-
sidual volume, compared with tuberculin and other syringes
with detachable needles.49
Nature of the injury
As noted above, based on published studies concerning
HIV infection and healthcare-associated needlestick injuries,
the average risk of HIV transmission from a single exposure
to known infected blood would be, overall, 0.3%.40,44
However, this figure is specifically for blood known to be
HIV contaminated and includes the full spectrum of pos-
sible injuries, from mildest to most severe. The following
factors were associated with a higher risk of HIV transmis-
sion (and also are likely associated with higher risk of HBV
and HCV transmission): deep injury (13-fold increase in
risk), visible blood on device (4.5-fold increase) and an
injury associated with a needle accessing an artery or vein
(3.6-fold increase).30 The risk associated with injuries lacking
these characteristics is ,0.3%. Epinephrine self-injector syr-
inges/needles and insulin syringes/needles have lower gauge
needles and are not likely to cause a deep injury. When used
correctly and for medically indicated purposes, these needles
do not enter an artery or vein. A CANSI rarely involves an
artery or vein.
Prophylaxis
A final determinant of infection risk is whether transmission
can be prevented, in the event of an exposure to infectious
organisms. At this time, there is not an HCV vaccine and
PEP protocols do not appear to be effective in preventing
HCV transmission. Post-exposure anti-HBV immunoglobu-
lin and HBV vaccination are available and effective if
initiated quickly. There is no HIV vaccine but evidence sug-
gests that HIV PEP is sometimes effective if taken early.
However, toxicities cause some individuals to stop therapy
before completion of a full 28-day course. HIV PEP is
recommended for non-healthcare setting exposures if the
source is known to be infected. Decisions about HIV PEP
for unknown-source exposures is made on a case-by-case
basis, taking into consideration the available information
concerning type of exposure, whatever is known about the
risk characteristics of the source and the HIV prevalence in
the exposure setting.25,40 It is not recommended routinely in
a case of CANSI.25,40
