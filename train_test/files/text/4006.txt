Introduction
Hypertension is a major risk factor for cardiovascular and
cerebrovascular diseases and mortality,1­4 affecting
approximately 1 billion individuals worldwide.5 It is esti-
mated that this number will escalate to more than 1.56 bil-
lion by the year 2025,6 putting a tremendous burden on our
health care systems.6­9 Hypertension is also a complex dis-
ease influenced by an interaction between environmental
and genetic factors.10 Regarding these environmental fac-
tors, lifestyle changes, including physical activity, play a
primordial role in the prevention and treatment of high
blood pressure (BP).11,12 There is substantial evidence sup-
porting the beneficial effect of aerobic endurance training
on resting and ambulatory BP (ABP).13­18 In addition, it
has also been demonstrated that one single bout of endur-
ance exercise may cause a transient reduction in BP for
prolonged periods of time.11,19­23 This phenomenon has
been called postexercise hypotension (PEH)11,21,22 and
may vary in magnitude and duration depending on the
exercise characteristics.16,24,25 However, it is also widely

Abstract
Hypothesis/Introduction: Polymorphisms of the angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) gene can interfere with
exercise-induced acute blood pressure (BP) reduction. This cross-over study investigated the acute effect of a single
walk on BP and tested whether polymorphisms of the ACE gene might explain the variation in BP responses.
Materials and methods: Thirty-four healthy medicated individuals were randomized to one control and one walking
session at 60­75% of heart rate reserve. Subjects left the laboratory wearing an ambulatory BP monitor until waking the
next morning.
Results: Overall, systolic BP was somewhat lower following the walking session (p=.06), which could be attributed to
a consistently lower systolic BP for 5 h after exercise (p-interaction<.04) compared with control rest. Similarly, II/ID
individuals had a lower systolic BP (p-interaction=.02) and diastolic BP (p-interaction<.01) for 5 h after walking compared
with control rest. Among DD individuals, a single walk did not induce a reduction in BP (p-interaction>.05).
Conclusions: Our results showed that postexercise hypotension can occur after a walk at moderate intensity in
carriers of the I allele; we were not able to demonstrate this in DD individuals. Our results suggest that genetic variation
in the ACE gene might affect the BP response to exercise, although more research is needed to confirm these findings.

known that not all individuals respond in the same way to
such an acute bout of exercise or to exercise training,
which might partly be explained by genetic variations.26
The HEalth, RIsk factors, exercise Training And Genetics
(HERITAGE) family study concluded that genetic factors
explain up to 17% of the training-induced reduction in sys-
tolic BP (SBP).27
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is
an important BP-regulating mechanism, with angiotensin
II (Ang II) being an important and powerful vasoconstric-
tor, increasing renal sodium and fluid reabsorption by
aldosterone release, and consequently resulting in an
increase in BP.10 Given its role in BP regulation, it is rea-
sonable to assume that genetic variations in the RAAS
influence BP and its response to exercise. Indeed, earlier
studies already demonstrated that individuals with the
deletion polymorphism (DD) of the angiotensin convert-
ing enzyme (ACE) gene have higher circulating ACE lev-
els compared with individuals with the insertion
polymorphism (II),28­30 resulting in a higher BP and an
increased risk for hypertension in DD homozygotes.31­34
Less is known about the role of the RAAS system and its
polymorphisms in BP reduction following a single exer-
cise session. It is generally accepted that in most subjects,
PEH is due to a persistent drop in vascular resistance,
which is not completely offset by increases in cardiac out-
put.35 Although the mechanisms of the vasodilatation
underlying this PEH largely remain to be elucidated,
changes in the sympathetic nervous system and nitric
oxide (NO) have all been implicated,35­38 with studies
demonstrating an association between RAAS and these
mechanisms.39,40 Similarly, ACE polymorphisms have also
been shown to be related to NO release postexercise, with
carriers of the I allele presenting greater NO bioavailabil-
ity after a single bout of aerobic exercise compared with
DD individuals, and consequently larger PEH.40 Finally,
exercise also triggers an increase in release ofAng (1­7) as
well as ACE2, which are vasodilators, leading to greater
NO production and resulting in a reduction in BP.36 To the
best of our knowledge, only a few studies have directly
investigated the effects of ACE polymorphisms on post-
aerobic exercise hypotension.19,26,40,41 Blanchard et al.26
observed a lower SBP in DD individuals compared with
individuals with an I allele after light-intensity exercise
(40% VO2max
) but not following moderate intensity exer-
cise (60% VO2max
). On the other hand, Santana et al.40
showed a significantly larger decrease in SBP over the
course of 1h after a maximal incremental cycle test and a
single bout of exercise at 90% of anaerobic threshold in II/
ID individuals compared with DD.
Nevertheless, participants in these studies were unmed-
icated healthy patients, or had been treated with medica-
tion but undergone a washout period before enrollment in
the study. However, today, 58.9% of the population are
treated with BP-lowering medication.42 Therefore, it
would be of interest to see whether exercise still has some
adjunctive effect in reducing BP in patients already treated
with medication. Therefore, given the current limited and
inconsistent results, we aimed in the present study (1) to
investigate the acute effect of one single walking session at
moderate intensity on PEH and (2) to test whether poly-
morphisms of the ACE gene contribute to the variation in
PEH response in medicated patients.
Methods
Subjects
Potential participants were recruited by means of
announcements in journals and magazines and on the
internet. After being screened and signing the informed
consent, 34 individuals (Table 1) performed one control
session and one exercise session. The inclusion criteria
were: healthy men or women without known cardiovascu-
lar or pulmonary disease, age 40 years, non-smokers,
clinically diagnosed with hypertension according to the
Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of High
Blood Pressure5 and having been treated for at least
3
months with antihypertensive medication acting on
RAAS. The study was approved by the Research Ethics
Committee of the State University of Londrina - Brazil
(232/2013).
Study design
This study was performed as a randomized controlled
cross-over trial. During the screening visit, patients
received information about the study and filled in a ques-
tionnaire about their habitual physical activity behavior,
medication and medical history. In addition, anthropomet-
rics (height and weight) and resting BP were assessed, and
volunteers completed a maximal graded exercise test on a
treadmill (T170, h/p/cosmos, Traunstein, Germany) until
volitional exhaustion using an individualized ramp proto-
col.43 The criteria for test interruption followed the recom-
mendations of the American Heart Association.44 The
oxygen uptake was evaluated continuously by a breath by
breath analysis of expired gases (QuarKCPET, Cosmed,
Rome, Italy), and a polar heart rate (HR) monitor (FS1,
Polar, Kempele, Finland) was used to assess the HR. Peak
oxygen consumption (VO2 peak
) was defined as the mean
oxygen uptake of the final 30 s of the exercise test. The
maximal duration of the test was between 7 and 12 min.
This test was used to define the target HR for the exercise
session and to evaluate the current physical fitness of the
participants.
Following this visit and having signed the informed
consent, participants returned to the laboratory twice, dur-
ing which they completed the control and the exercise
722 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 16(4)
session. The randomization order was determined by a
computer program (http://www.random.org/). All tests
were performed in the morning (9:00­12:00) at the same
time of day for each individual patient to control for diur-
nal variation in BP and to avoid any influence of time of
medication intake. All measurements were performed by
the same investigator (KG).
Exercise and control intervention
Each session started with a 10min seated rest period, after
which BP and HR were measured by means of an auto-
matic device (Omron HEM 742 INT, Comfort, Japan).
This pre-intervention BP was measured three times with a
5
min interval between measurements. Following pre-
intervention measurements, each volunteer performed one
of the two sessions in random order: a control session of
seated rest and one walking session of 55min, including a
warming up and cooling down of 5min each and 45min of
walking at 60­75% of HR reserve. During the supervised
walking session, training intensity was controlled by a HR
monitor (FT1, Polar, Kempele, Finland).
Ambulatory blood pressure monitoring
After the exercise and control sessions, individuals left the
laboratory wearing an ABP device (Meditech, ABPM04,
Budapest, Hungary) on the left arm until waking the next
morning. The ABP monitor was programmed to measure
BP every 30
min, and the first BP reading was assessed
30min following the sessions. Patients were instructed to
proceed with their normal daily activities and were asked
to fill in an activity diary. Daytime ABP was defined as the
average of all BPs recorded between 06:00 and 22:00;
nighttime BP was defined as the mean BP of all values
between 22:00 and 06:00. All ABP readings were manu-
ally checked and invalid measurements were excluded. A
reading was considered invalid if it differed by more than
40 mmHg from the previous and the next reading and this
could not be explained by a change in physical activity. We
subsequently manually calculated hourly averages on the
edited data.
Blood sampling and ACE genotyping
Blood samples (5 ml) were collected from the brachial
artery during the screening visit and prepared by an inde-
pendent biochemical laboratory (The Novaes Center for
Clinical Analysis), after which they were stored at -80ºC.
Genotyping was performed by the polymerase chain reac-
tion (PCR) method45 at the Laboratory of Biomechanical
and Molecular Biology (University of São Paulo). DNAwas
extracted from whole blood and the ACE gene (II/ID and
DD) was determined by means of a two-primer system (I/D:

with 12.5µl of each primer.Additionally, a solution was pre-
pared containing 0.3 µl MgCl2
, 0.2 µl dNTP mix, 1 unit of
Taq polymerase, 10 µl of PCR buffer 10× free Mg2+ and 6.3
µl of H2
O RNAase free. The DNA was amplified for 30
cycles with denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at
58°C for 1 min, and extension at 72°C for 2 min using a
thermal cycler (MJ Research, PTC-200, Peltier Thermal
Cycler, USA). The PCR product is a 190 bp fragment in the
absence of the insertion and a 490 bp fragment in the
presence of the insertion. A third fragment with an inter-
mediate molecular weight is present in PCR from hete-
rozygotes, and likely corresponds to a heteroduplex DNA
fragment.46 Amplification products were visualized after
electrophoresis in 1% agarose gels with loading buffer
(Figure 1).
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed by means of the
Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS 17.0,
Chicago, USA). The data are reported as mean and stand-
ard error for continuous data and number (%) for dichoto-
mous data. The Shapiro­Wilk test was used to check the
normality, followed by Mauchly's and Greenshouse­Geiser
for the sphericity. Independent Student's t-tests were used
to compare pre-intervention data across the different poly-
morphism groups, and dependent Student's t-tests were
used to compare pre-intervention BP between sessions.
Categorical variables were compared by means of 2 tests.
Two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with repeated
measures was performed to compare ABP (SBP and dias-
tolic blood pressure (DBP)) over time and between the two
experimental sessions. When applicable, the least signifi-
cant difference (LSD) post-hoc test was performed. BP data
are reported for 5 h because this is the time period over
which PEH was sustained following the exercise session.
To test whether the observed genotype frequencies were in
Hardy­Weinberg equilibrium, a 2 test with one degree of
freedom was used. Statistical significance was established
as p<.05 (one-tailed).
Results
Subject characteristics
The general characteristics of the subjects are presented in
Table 1. Overall, participants (35.3% men, mean age 61
years (range 40 to 79)) were overweight or obese individu-
als with controlled (n=20) or uncontrolled (n=14) hyper-
tension and above average physical fitness for individuals
of their age.47 Baseline characteristics were similar for the
two genotype groups. ACE allele and genotype frequen-
cies in our population did not differ significantly from
Hardy­Weinberg expectations (p allele frequency = .49; q
allele frequency = .51).
Blood pressure response
Overall study sample. As shown in Table 2, pre-interven-
tion BP was not different between the sessions (p>.05).
Following the walking session, no differences could be
observed for average daytime, nighttime or 24h ABP
(p>.05) compared with a non-exercise control session.
The hourly mean BP for 5 h following the interventions
can be seen in Figure 2. Over the course of 5 h, one single
walk induced a significantly more pronounced reduction
in BP compared with control for both SBP (p-interac-
tion=.04) and DBP (p-interaction=.001). Further, when we
calculated the average change over the 5 h period, Figure 3
shows that the average decrease in DBP (-6.5±1.5mmHg)
was significantly larger (p=.01) compared with
control rest (-3.1±1.5mmHg), and there was a borderline
non-significant (p=.06) larger reduction in SBP
(-5.7±2.6mmHg) following exercise compared with a
non-exercise control session (-1.3±2.6mmHg).
ACE polymorphisms (II/ID and DD). Figure 4((a)­(d)) shows
BP at baseline and after exercise and control sessions over
the course of 5 h by ACE genotype groups. Among the 24
participants with the ACE I allele (i.e. II/ID), we observed
a significant time effect for both SBP (p-time<.05) and
DBP (p-time<.001) and a significant treatment effect
(p-interaction SBP=.02; p-interaction DBP=.002) (Figure
4(a) and (b)). As demonstrated in Figure 5(a), the exercise-
induced decrease in DBP (6.3±1.9
mmHg) was signifi-
cantly larger compared with the non-exercise control

session (-2.9±1.9
mmHg) (p=.01 for II/ID). However, as
can be seen in Figure 4(c) and (d) and Figure 5(b), partici-
pants homozygous for the D allele of theACE gene showed
no significant change in BP following the interventions
(p-time >.05 for both; p-interaction > .05 for both).
Discussion
The purpose of this study was (1) to assess the acute effect
of a single walk at moderate intensity on PEH and (2) to
examine the effects of the ACE polymorphisms on the PEH
response to this walk in 34 hypertensive medicated men
and women. Our results demonstrate that a 45 min walk at
moderate intensity already results in BP reductions that last
for a 5 h period compared with a non-exercise control ses-
sion. Our results further show that carriers of the I allele
experience this PEH following a single walk, whereas a
reduction in BP is not observed among D homozygotes.
The acute effects of aerobic endurance exercise on BP
have been widely studied among different popula-
tions48­52 and using a wide variety of exercise proto-
cols.25,53,54 Previously, Guidry et al.55 suggested that PEH
following aerobic endurance exercise is a low-threshold
phenomenon. They reported that the immediate
BP-lowering effects of short-duration (15 min), lower-
intensity exercise (40% VO2peak
) are comparable to those
of higher amounts of exercise (30 min at 60% VO2peak
).55
In line with this, Mach et al.56 reported that PEH occurred
after any duration of moderate-intensity endurance exer-
cise in the laboratory. In our study, we used moderate-
intensity walking, which could easily be incorporated
into daily life and can safely be performed by any

individual. Our results are in line with previous studies
that have already demonstrated that PEH is a low-intensity
threshold phenomenon. Namely, for 5 h after the walk-
ing session, both SBP (-5.7±2.6 mmHg)and DBP
(-6.5±1.5mmHg) were lower compared with a non-exer-
cise control session, suggesting that a simple brisk walk,
which is accessible to a large proportion of hypertensive
patients worldwide, might already result in significant
health benefits. As is well known, the primary recom-
mendation for the treatment of high BP starts with life-
style modification; however, if the BP is not sufficiently
lowered, treatment with antihypertensive medication is
necessary.5 Previous studies have reported that BP con-
trol at normal levels is difficult, with only 25­62% of
patients being properly controlled;13,57­59 consequently,
most hypertensive patients receive antihypertensive med-
ication. In Brazil, 76% of patients are using drug ther-
apy.60 In view of the importance of external validity to
contribute to strategies for BP control in hypertensive
patients, we included medicated patients. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first study to investigate the acute effects
of exercise on BP in patients treated with ACE inhibitors
or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). Previously,
Ciolac et al.13 investigated a single aerobic exercise effect
on ABP in long-term-treated hypertensive patients. They
demonstrated for the first time that a single session of
aerobic exercise reduced ABP in long-term-treated
patients. In line with this, Melo et al.61 showed reductions

in BP over the course of 10h following a single bout of
resistance exercise at low intensity in women treated with
captopril.
However, not all individuals respond in the same way to
exercise, for reasons that still remain to be elucidated.
Forjaz et al.48 showed that only 65% of hypertensive
patients experienced a fall in ABP after one bout of exer-
cise, indicating that 35% of the patients did not. Further,
Fagard17 concluded that exercise characteristics, such as
intensity, frequency and duration, explain only 4.9% of the
variance in SBP and 1.1% in DBP in response to exercise.
Additionally, the HERITAGE62 study concluded that 30%
of the variance in resting BP can be explained by genetics.
This all suggests that genetic variation between individu-
als might also help to explain part of the different responses
to acute and chronic exercise.10,27
In this study, we focused on the effect of ACE polymor-
phisms on PEH. We observed a BP reduction after a simple
walk in subjects who carry the I allele, while we were una-
ble to show this effect in DD individuals. Others have
shown that individuals carrying an I allele (II/ID) are less
prone to develop hypertension, and the present results sug-
gest that they are also more responsive to the PEH effect.
This was explained by the observation of higher levels of
circulating ACE in DD homozygotes compared with indi-
viduals carrying the I allele.28 However, our results further
suggest that this lower risk for hypertension might also be
explained by their better responsiveness to exercise,
although this should be confirmed in larger studies. Our
results are in line with those of Santana et al.,40 who
showed that only individuals carrying an I allele presented
reductions in SBP after an incremental test and after 20
min of exercise at 90% anaerobic threshold. Earlier studies
investigating the chronic effects of exercise on BP found
similar results.63,64 Namely, Zhang et al.64 reported a
significant reduction in BP after 10 weeks of training only
in individuals with an I allele, and not in DD homozygotes,
while Hagberg et al.63 found larger reductions in BP fol-
lowing exercise in II and ID genotype individuals com-
pared with DD individuals.
On the other hand, Blanchard et al.26 demonstrated that
SBP was lower for 14 h after exercise at light but not mod-
erate intensity in homozygous DD individuals compared
with II/ID, suggesting that intensity might influence the
relationship between ACE polymorphism and PEH.
Finally, Taylor-Tolbert et al.41 reported larger reductions in
BP in II and DD compared with ID 24 h after a single bout
of vigorous exercise. However, it is difficult to compare
their results with ours, as they compared ACE homozy-
gotes (II and DD) with ACE heterozygotes (ID).
The present study was not designed to examine possible
mechanisms that could explain the different response
between the ACE polymorphisms. However, it has previ-
ously been shown that the DD allele of ACE is associated
with higher ACE circulating levels, resulting in a higher
BP due to an increase in Ang I and Ang II, triggering vaso-
constriction, water retention and sodium reabsorption, and
resulting in a higher blood volume.28 Others showed that
higher activity of Ang II may blind the vasodilatation
induced by bradykinin, resulting in reduced NO bioavail-
ability.31 Although we did not evaluate NO bioavailability,
a previous study demonstrated that ID/II individuals have
an increased NO release post incremental exercise test
compared with DD individuals.40 Further, Tanriverdi
et al.65 showed greater endothelium-dependent vasodilata-
tion in II-homozygous athletes compared with DD or ID,
due to increased NO bioavailability and bradykinin con-
centration. These mechanisms might in part explain the
PEH response, taking into account that bradykinin and NO
release are related to PEH.20,66

The present study has some limitations. We only evaluated
insertion/deletion polymorphisms of the ACE gene, and did
not include other polymorphisms or parameters of the RAAS,
such as plasma renin levels, ACE plasma levels, angiotensin
levels and angiotensinogen. Based on a previous review by
Pescatello et al.,67 we calculated that we would need a sample
size of 33 patients to detect an absolute net difference of 4.7
mmHg, assuming a standard deviation of 8.5 mmHg with a
statistical power of 0.8 and alpha of 0.05. Although the num-
ber of participants in the DD group corresponds to the overall
representation of this group in the general population, this
lower number of participants might have resulted in a lack of
power to detect changes in BP following exercise.
Consequently, we lacked the power to perform a three-way
ANOVAin which we could have included the polymorphism
groups as a covariate. Therefore, we suggest that the results of
this study should be interpreted as hypothesis generating, and
further studies are needed to confirm our findings.
Conclusions
In hypertensive subjects receiving medications for the
RAAS, a single walk at moderate intensity promotes a
reduction in BP compared with a rest session. Overall, a
single walk at moderate intensity promoted somewhat
larger reductions in BP compared with a control rest ses-
sion. Further, our results suggest that this PEH might be
influenced by genetic factors.
