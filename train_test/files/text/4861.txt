Fairer machine learning in the real
world: Mitigating discrimination
without collecting sensitive data
Michael Veale1 and Reuben Binns2
Abstract
Decisions based on algorithmic, machine learning models can be unfair, reproducing biases in historical data used to train
them. While computational techniques are emerging to address aspects of these concerns through communities such as
discrimination-aware data mining (DADM) and fairness, accountability and transparency machine learning (FATML), their
practical implementation faces real-world challenges. For legal, institutional or commercial reasons, organisations might
not hold the data on sensitive attributes such as gender, ethnicity, sexuality or disability needed to diagnose and mitigate
emergent indirect discrimination-by-proxy, such as redlining. Such organisations might also lack the knowledge and
capacity to identify and manage fairness issues that are emergent properties of complex sociotechnical systems.
This paper presents and discusses three potential approaches to deal with such knowledge and information deficits in
the context of fairer machine learning. Trusted third parties could selectively store data necessary for performing
discrimination discovery and incorporating fairness constraints into model-building in a privacy-preserving manner.
Collaborative online platforms would allow diverse organisations to record, share and access contextual and experiential
knowledge to promote fairness in machine learning systems. Finally, unsupervised learning and pedagogically interpret-
able algorithms might allow fairness hypotheses to be built for further selective testing and exploration. Real-world
fairness challenges in machine learning are not abstract, constrained optimisation problems, but are institutionally and
contextually grounded. Computational fairness tools are useful, but must be researched and developed in and with
the messy contexts that will shape their deployment, rather than just for imagined situations. Not doing so risks real,
near-term algorithmic harm.

Introduction
As machine learning techniques are taken up in an ever-
wider array of sectors for decision-making and deci-
sion-support, many have pointed to harms that might
result from their careless or malicious implementation.
Some harms surround fairness, as it proves to be diffi-
cult to make systems that do not exhibit bias, indirectly
or in subsets of data (Hajian, 2013; Kamiran et al.,
2012; Barocas and Selbst, 2016). These are nested
within a range of linked concerns, including algorithmic
transparency and accountability (Burrell, 2016; Keats
Citron and Pasquale, 2014; Kroll et al., 2016;
Nissenbaum, 1996), in-the-wild reliability (Z
 liobaite

et al., 2016); security against adversaries (Huang
et al., 2011; McDaniel et al., 2016); entrenchment of
inequality (boyd and Crawford, 2012; Harcourt,
2006); risks to privacy and due process (Hildebrandt
and Gutwirth, 2008); and the enablement of ambient,
ubiquitous surveillance systems (Hildebrandt, 2015;
Kitchin and Dodge, 2011). These have mobilised a

wide array of researchers and practitioners to consider
how these technologies can be utilised whilst minimis-
ing the pitfalls and risks that might accompany them.
This paper focuses on how fairness and discrimin-
ation in machine learning systems can be mitigated
within practical institutional constraints. Machine
learning systems, which identify and utilise patterns in
data, are designed to discriminate. We use these systems
to distinguish data points from each other based on
certain predictive characteristics. Some forms of dis-
crimination however are considered unacceptable
(Hellman, 2008). Legally `protected characteristics',
usually including disability, race, sexuality, gender,
pregnancy, among others, are broadly illegal to use in
most decision-making. These are not set in stone.
For example, while single-sex sports clubs, toilets, or
specific types of job advert (e.g. modelling) are usually
not illegal, acceptance of them is changing.
Discrimination usually also requires cases to be other-
wise comparable. In some situations, sex might not be
considered discriminatory where decisions hinge on dif-
ferences in statistical life expectancies (Berendt and
Preibusch, 2014).
Other bars for measuring fairness are less universal.
Judging based on appearance; on events that occurred
some time ago; on limited data; on actions an individ-
ual has already been sanctioned for, or in conditions
of high uncertainty and rapid change, is sometimes
acceptable, sometimes not. Judging based on arbitrary
characteristics, like favouring those who access online
forms with custom web browsers (Pinsker, 2015), might
also seem unfair, perhaps because of the opportunistic
short-lived nature of such correlations as well as the
associated ways it might discriminate against those
accessing forms from schools, or from libraries.
Some sources of unfair machine learning systems
There are several interacting ways that deployment of
machine learning can potentially lead to unfair or dis-
criminatory outcomes.
Unfairness in data, their collection and their processing. Many
of the fairness issues in machine learning are primarily
thought to arise from data. Some think, falling for
what could be called the `neutrality fallacy', that
machine learning will provide a more even and object-
ive treatment of individuals (Sandvig, 2015). As Latour
indicates, we are often more than happy to declare
value-laden issues as matters of fact, and let machines
settle them for us (1999). This is rarely appropriate.
The high demand for labelled data in the context of
supervised machine learning ­ the focus of this paper ­
can usually only be met by using data from previous
decision-making. If these historical data reflect existing,
unwanted discrimination in society, the model that is
learned from it ­ essentially a similarity engine ­ will
likely encode these same patterns, risking reproduction
of past disparities. Machine learning algorithms are
supposed to discriminate between data points ­ that is
why we use them ­ yet some logics of discrimination,
even if predictively valid, are not societally acceptable.
Furthermore, if some sub-groups are historically
undersampled, or exhibit more complicated, nuanced
or under-evidenced patterns compared to others,
models might exhibit differential performance. It is
not practically possible to have data on all individuals,
quantifying or classifying all factors important to some
social phenomenon. People, or aspects of their lives, are
always missing. These skews fast make their way into
data-driven systems.
Data are often also cleaned and transformed before
use, in subjective ways. `Feature engineering', where
input variables are transformed to make them more
amenable to modelling, has crucial downstream
impact on the behaviour of machine learning systems.
Feature engineering emphasises aspects of certain vari-
ables through augmentation, aggregation and summar-
isation of characteristics whilst downplaying others.
For instance, aggregating those who subscribe to dif-
ferent branches of a religious doctrine (e.g. Catholic,
Protestant; Shia, Sunni) within a single overarching
doctrine (Christian, Muslim) might collapse distinc-
tions which are highly relevant to questions of fairness
and discrimination within certain contexts. Including a
standard deviation of a characteristic as an input vari-
able will make it easier for a machine learning model
to emphasise divergence from a constructed average.
As with many issues in machine learning, the political
nature of this classifying and sorting has long been
recognised (Bowker and Star, 1999). Categorisation
does not just label people, it can create groups and
alter future outcomes (Hacking, 1995; Harcourt,
2006), just as feature engineering can in machine learn-
ing (Rouvroy, 2011).
Unfairness from selecting and specifying a machine learning
system. Humans carry their worldviews and make
value-laden choices, with both foreseeable and unfore-
seeable consequences, during the whole modelling pro-
cess. While machine learning is often portrayed as
automated, a great deal of subjective human labour is
involved in system design and deployment. Model
choice itself can be political. Neural networks or
random forests are more amenable to capturing syn-
ergy between variables than linear regression. Use of
regression might omit important contextual variance,
for example. Within a model family, further hyperpara-
meters must be specified. Higher regularisation param-
eters penalise complexity in a model, which might help it
2 Big Data & Society
generalise but might trade-off for certain complicated or
rare patterns not being retained. Different evaluation
mechanisms for models emphasise different aspects of
performance (Japkowicz and Shah, 2011).
Unfortunately, `neutral' choices in machine learning sys-
tems do not exist ­ candidates for these, such as software
defaults, are best thought of as arbitrary.
Finally, once a model has been built, there are vari-
ous ways it can be deployed in practice which may
introduce additional fairness issues. The extent to
which a model may have different impacts on different
groups may only become evident once that model is put
into a decision-making system; for instance, the setting
of thresholds for positive and negative outcomes could
have significant consequences for different groups
which may not be evident by merely studying the
model itself. The introduction of an algorithmic
system may also provide spurious justification for deci-
sions which would otherwise have been more open
to challenge under a purely human decision-making
process (Skitka et al., 1999).
As with any sociotechnical, value-laden problem,
we cannot expect to find simple or universal panaceas.
We are stuck with layered, messy techniques to
define, resolve and manage these complex challenges.
This paper zooms in to examine one piece of this
challenge ­ how potentially unfair patterns in datasets
that make their way into modelling and decision-
making processes might be remedied in practical
rather than theoretical machine learning situations.
We emphasise situations where actors designing and
deploying such systems wish to avoid bias themselves,
for regulatory and reputation-related reasons, rather
than adversarial situations where external investigators
wish to discover bias against the will of the organisa-
tions undertaking analysis. Legislative discussion
within a European context of the ability to investigate
algorithmic systems can be found in Edwards and
Veale (2017).
Can we statistically `debias' data and algorithms?
Computational techniques to prevent machine learning
methods from perpetuating these forms of bias have
been proposed in recent years by research communities
such as discrimination-aware data mining (DADM)
and fairness, accountability and transparency in
machine learning (FATML). They involve altering
usual data science processes in order to correct these
forms of bias. They can operate at several stages,
including pre-processing, in-processing and post-
processing (Hajian and Domingo-Ferrer, 2013). In
each case, the aim is to induce patterns that do not
lead to discriminatory decisions despite the possibility
of biases in the training data.
Anti-discrimination law has particularly motivated
DADM and FATML communities, who have
attempted to formalise these requirements for mathem-
atical implementation. For instance, heuristics such as
the US Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's
`80% rule', which provides a suggested level of permis-
sible disparity between protected groups and the
general population, have been used to set parameters
for fairness-aware models (Feldman et al., 2015).
Within European contexts, non-discrimination and
data protection are rights enshrined in the EU
Charter of Fundamental Rights, and both potentially
relate to the risks of unfairness inherent in machine
learning applications (Gellert et al., 2013). Recital 71
of the EU General Data Protection Regulation
(GDPR) refers in particular to fairness-aware data
mining technologies and organisational measures.
There are multiple ways to define fairness formally
in machine learning contexts. Most measures focus
on differences in treatment between protected and
non-protected groups, but there are multiple ways to
measure differences in outcomes. These include:
`disparate impact' or `statistical/demographic parity',
which considers classification rates between groups;1
`accuracy equity', which considers the overall accuracy
of a predictive model for each group (Angwin et al.,
2016; Dieterich et al., 2016); `conditional accuracy
equity', which considers the accuracy of a predictive
model for each group, conditional on their predicted
class (Dieterich et al., 2016); `equality of opportunity',
which considers whether each group is equally likely to
be predicted a desirable outcome given the actual base
rates for that group (Hardt et al., 2016); and `disparate
mistreatment', a corollary which considers differences
in false positive rates between groups (Zafar et al., 2016).
Other measures focus not just on actual outcomes and
their relation to true/false positives/negatives, but on
counterfactual scenarios wherein members of the pro-
tected groups are instead members of the non-protected
group (i.e. a woman classified by the system should get
the same classification she would have done had she
been a man) (Kusner et al., 2017).
Each of these measures of fairness are arguably rea-
sonable ways to measure fairness. One might therefore
hope that a fair system would satisfy all of these con-
straints. But unfortunately, recent work has formally
proven that it is impossible for a model to satisfy sev-
eral of these constraints at the same time, except in
exceptional cases which are unlikely to hold in the
real world (Berk et al., 2017; Chouldechova, 2017;
Kleinberg et al., 2016). As a result, choices between
the different measures will have to be made. In some
cases it may be more important to focus on differences
between positive classifications (e.g. loan applications),
and therefore an `equality of opportunity' measure
Veale and Binns 3
might be preferable; in others, the cost of a false nega-
tive might be higher (e.g. the risk a violent criminal
might pose to the public). Thus the choice of a particu-
lar fairness measure therefore ought to be sensitive to
the context.
Setting aside these definitional problems, fairness-
aware machine learning techniques are increasingly
seen as desirable, viable and even in some cases legally
recommended or required. However, an important
challenge remains. To be successful, these techniques
depend on knowledge about the potential correl-
ations between features in the training data and
protected characteristics that are the subject of anti-
discrimination and data protection law. In practice,
this is a condition that is either not always met, or
not always desirable to meet.
Why knowledge of protected characteristics
is both necessary and problematic?
To see why knowledge of protected characteristics is
necessary, it is helpful to consider why certain nai¨ve
approaches to removing bias from modelling are inad-
equate. One could simply delete any sensitive variables
related to discrimination, e.g. age, gender, race, or reli-
gion, from the training data. Unfortunately, this does
not guarantee non-discrimination in the models that
are trained on this data, as non-discriminatory items
might exist which in some conditions are closely corre-
lated with the sensitive attributes. Where geography
serves as a sensitive proxy, this phenomenon is
termed `redlining'. More broadly, it can be seen as an
issue of redundant encoding.
In order to discover redlining in training data, one
needs to be able to find out whether sensitive attributes
might be encoded by other, apparently benign ones.
For instance, to discover whether ZIP codes in a data-
set are correlated with, e.g. race, it will be necessary to
either have race as an attribute in the dataset, or to
have background knowledge about the demographics
of the areas in question (for instance, from census rec-
ords). Proposed approaches to non-discriminatory
machine learning assume that whoever is implementing
the technique has access to the sensitive attributes
which might be encoded (e.g. Hajian and Domingo-
Ferrer, 2013; Hardt et al., 2016). Such access is
necessary for assurance of computationally non-
discriminatory models (Z
 liobaite
_ and Custers, 2016).
Despite this, in many cases organisations deploying
machine learning will lack this necessary access, often
for legitimate reasons.
First, the collection of personal data inevitably
creates privacy risks. Many organisations have interna-
lised the dictum of regulators and privacy advocates
only to collect data that is necessary for their purposes.
The concepts of data minimisation and purpose limita-
tion within the GDPR are intended to prevent col-
lection and processing of data for unspecified
or disproportionate ends. Furthermore, the kinds of
protected characteristics involved in cases of discrimin-
ation raise higher privacy and data protection risks
than other kinds of data, and are given special protec-
tion under both the GDPR and other laws (Edwards
and Veale, 2017). The proposition that organisations
ought to collect a wide range of sensitive data that
isn't directly necessary for their primary purposes
contradicts this general dictum. Yet fairness-aware
machine learning seems to require organisations to do
exactly that to adequately inspect and modify their
models.2
It is not our aim here to analyse the extent to which
privacy and data protection law and best practice is
substantively in conflict with the collection and process-
ing of sensitive attributes for the purposes of fairness-
aware machine learning.3 It may be that collection and
processing for such purposes is legitimate; however, it
may still not be desirable. It would require data subjects
to share sensitive attributes along with non-sensitive
ones every time their data was to be used to train a
model. The general result would be much more sensi-
tive data in the hands of data controllers ­ a security
risk even if it is intended to be used for the legitimate
purposes of avoiding discriminatory outcomes. Even if
organisations are permitted to collect and process such
data, requiring consumers to provide it might make
their service less competitive, or less trusted. For pur-
poses of building a model that serves some narrowly
prescribed goal, they may not see the need to collect
sensitive data. In the context of data minimisation, the
data controller must argue that it is proportionate to
collect and process sensitive categories of data, and
they may not be sufficiently incentivised to do so.
Where individuals fear they are being treated unfairly,
the collection of sensitive data by the organisation in
question, even to explicitly remedy fairness issues,
might not alleviate that perception-based fear.
It could even make it worse.
Some approaches have been proposed to transform
training data with anonymisation procedures to protect
the sensitive attributes. This can be performed in
tandem with pre-processing techniques to prevent dis-
crimination (Hajian et al., 2014; Hajian and Domingo-
Ferrer, 2012). While promising, this still mandates the
comprehensive collection of sensitive attributes from
individuals in training data for each form of discrimin-
ation for which mitigation is desired. Despite meaning-
ful privacy protections, the concerns raised above are
still likely to apply. Individuals are unlikely to be happy
providing a comprehensive range of sensitive personal
data to the very organisations who are in position to
4 Big Data & Society
discriminate, no matter how technically robust their
anonymisation process is.
Three approaches for appraising and
improving fairness with limited data
Organisations developing learning systems need strate-
gies to mitigate discrimination concerns in the absence
of sensitive data. The challenge is to implement the
techniques, such as those outlined above, without
having to take on the additional burden and risk of
collecting detailed sensitive data on the training sample.
We present three alternative approaches to over-
come this challenge. The first is based on a multi-
party data governance model, suited to contexts
where little background knowledge about discrimin-
ation exists and a comprehensive assessment of poten-
tial forms of discrimination is needed. The second
involves a collaborative knowledge sharing approach
in which organisations can learn from each other's
experiences in similar contexts as well as relevant socio-
logical and demographic correlations. The third
involves exploratory analysis to build hypotheses of
potential unfair characteristics of the data or system,
which can be more formally tested as part of a due
diligence process. Figure 1 pictographically illustrates
these three distinct approaches.
We do not argue that these three methods are
perfect, nor that they provide complete solutions or
assurances to the multitude of challenges surrounding
machine learning systems. We argue instead that these
are avenues that are important to explore to make
fairer machine learning a practical reality in the multi-
tude of settings that automated and semi-automated
decisions will be occurring in our society in the
coming years and decades.
Trusted third parties holding protected
characteristics
Various proposals have been made for the involvement
of external parties in the evaluation and auditing of
algorithmic systems (Mantelero, 2016; Pasquale, 2010;
Sandvig et al., 2014; Tutt, 2016). Some of these are
reflected in law. Article 35 of the GDPR obliges organ-
isations to undertake `data protection impact assess-
ments' wherever `profiling' is used to automatically
make decisions which have legal or significant effects
on data subjects. In some cases these assessments may
be audited by a data protection authority (Recital 84).
In most governance approaches, external auditors are
given access to an organisation's policies, personnel,
data collection procedures, training data, models, pro-
prietary code, and other relevant aspects, in order to
assess the ethical dimensions and legal compliance of a
particular algorithmic system (see Binns, 2017).
This model assumes that the relevant information
required to perform an audit will lie in the hands of
the organisation being audited. As argued above, this
might not be the case, rendering external audit process
incapable of ensuring the kinds of algorithmic fairness
that DADM and FATML techniques aim for.
This might be different, were trusted third parties
enlisted to work alongside organisations from when
data collection begins. This proposal could be achieved
with a variety of different institutional and technical
arrangements. Below, we illustrate several possible
implementations.

The first party (the organisation implementing the
algorithmic decision-making system) has access to his-
torical data relevant to the classification or prediction
task for which they are building a model. However, the
first party does not and should not have access to any
of the protected characteristics associated with the
population used to train the model.
As discussed above, in order to statistically test the
model for potential discrimination, the protected char-
acteristics need to be linked somehow to the records
used in the training data. To achieve this, a trusted
third party is enlisted to collect data on the protected
characteristics of those individuals whose data is used
to train the model. For each individual, protected char-
acteristics like race, gender, religious beliefs or health
status are collected by the third party in parallel to the
collection of the non-protected characteristics by the
third party. The channel for communicating this infor-
mation from the individual to the third party may
depend on the platform (e.g. online, telephone, or in-
person). It could be as part of a separate collection
process, although this prove unwieldy, or be encrypted
simultaneously and seamlessly at the point of collection
(e.g. locally through JavaScript in a web browser4) with
the public key of a third party, and transmitted to the
organisation in question.5
Consider the following illustrative example:
An insurer wishes to use a machine learning model to
help determine customers' premiums. They have access
to historical customer, and use it to train a model to
predict the amount of compensation a customer will
claim over the term of their cover given certain attri-
butes (e.g. postcode, occupation, qualifications). The
estimated size of a potential claim ­ the output of the
model ­ is used to automatically set premiums.
The insurer enlists a third party organisation (for
instance, a consumer rights group) to simultaneously
collect protected characteristics about each customer
as they purchase their insurance policy. For online
purchases, the customer is directed to the consumer
rights group's domain, and asked to provide protected
characteristics for the purposes of discrimination
prevention.
Based on this multi-party data governance model,
there are multiple ways to proceed, depending on
whether the goal is merely to detect bias or to both
detect and prevent it, and what prevention techniques
will be used (e.g. pre-processing, in-processing, or post-
processing). We outline a set of possible variations here,
and discuss their relative advantages and drawbacks.
Variation 1: Third party as ex post disparate impact
detector. In cases where the third party's only role is
to detect discrimination (but not prevent it), the third
party need only collect protected characteristics from
each individual featured in the dataset used to train
(and test) the model, along with an identifier. The rec-
ords held by the first party for the purposes of model
training could be linked by this identifier to the records
held by the third party which contain the protected
characteristics. The third party would be given access
to the model developed by the first party (either directly
or via an application programming interface (API)).
By testing the outputs of the model on each of the indi-
viduals in their sensitive attribute dataset (using the
individual's identifier), the third party could detect dis-
parate impacts.
An advantage of this variation is that the third party
can only access the sensitive attributes, not the poten-
tially non-sensitive ones. Since each record only
contains sensitive attributes and an identifier this
represents a lesser privacy risk; while the data itself is
sensitive, it would be harder to re-identify an individual
without other data types. This may also be beneficial
from the perspective of a first party concerned about
keeping their proprietary model secret, as it has been
shown that unlimited access to a query interface for a
prediction model can allow an attacker to extract and
reconstruct a model (Trame
` r et al., 2016). In this case,
while the third party would have unrestricted ability to
query the model by individual identifiers, and thus learn
the distributions of outputs for each protected charac-
teristic, they would not be able to reverse-engineer the
model without access to the other, non-protected
characteristics.
The disadvantage of this variation is that it only
provides the first party with evidence of the disparate
impact of their model. Disparate impact is a blunt
measure of discrimination, because some disparities
may be `explicable', in the sense that the disparities
might be accountable by reference to attributes which
are legitimate grounds for differential treatment (Zafar
et al., 2016; Z
 liobaite
_ et al., 2011). Furthermore, meas-
ures of disparate impact may not be sufficient for the
first party to actually change their model to prevent it
from being discriminatory. For instance, to remove bias
from the training data, the first party would have to
know which data points to relabel, massage or re-
weight ­ i.e. the protected characteristics of the specific
individuals, which they would lack. More generally,
without the ability to check for redundant encoding
of protected characteristics by non-protected attributes,
it will be difficult for the first party to revise their
model.
Nevertheless, the mere ability to detect disparate
impact may be valuable in allowing third parties to
flag up problems, which can then be dealt with by
allowing the first party access to the necessary
6 Big Data & Society
additional data to investigate and transform their
model accordingly. Separating out detection of dispar-
ate impact and prevention could thus prevent unneces-
sary sharing of sensitive attributes and enable the third
party to perform continuous monitoring.
Variation 2: Third party as ex ante discrimination
mitigator. Alternatively, the third party could collect
both the protected attributes and the other features
used to train the model. This would enable the third
party to play a more significant role, not only detecting
disparate impact in model outputs but also helping to
ensure the disparities are attributable to disparate mis-
treatment (i.e. that they are not explainable), and also
to ensure that the model can be bias-free.
Third party as redlining detector. In this approach,
the third party has both the sensitive and potentially
non-sensitive characteristics, and puts them through a
common framework to produce summary information
that aims to flag obvious issues that might occur during
model building. Upon acquisition of a cleaned dataset,
the third party calculates and returns a set of redundant
encodings and their strengths. The returning document
might note that `race is correlated to zip code by 0.8';
`gender is correlated with aspects of profession by 0.2',
and so on. The first party could use this knowledge to
make trade-offs in the model ­ removing certain fea-
tures, or engaging in further discussions with the third
party about potential procedures to scrub unwanted
correlations from a model.
Naturally, such a framework could suffer from flaws
which made it unsuitable for some types of data or
problems, particularly highly contextual ones. Yet this
approach would create a focal point for the improve-
ment of discrimination detection methods for certain
contexts and data types, which would foster active dis-
cussion and debate about best practices and processes
that could be translated into on-the-ground practice
with relative ease.
Third party as data pre-processor. Another approach
would see the third party pre-process the training data
in such a way as to preserve anonymity and remove
bias, before handing it over to the first party. This
could be achieved by modifying the data to preserve
degrees of anonymity (using techniques such as statis-
tical disclosure control (Hundepool et al., 2012;
Willenborg and de Waal, 2012), and privacy-preserving
data mining (Agrawal and Srikant, 2000), which allow
the statistical properties of the data to be maintained),
followed by applying one of a range of anti-biasing
techniques described in the DADM/FATML litera-
tures (e.g. Feldman et al., 2015; Hajian and
Domingo-Ferrer, 2013; Kamiran et al., 2012).6
It would even be possible, if it were desired, to introduce
positive discrimination at this point, and some methods
have been proposed for how this could be achieved
(Verwer and Calders, 2013). As mentioned above,
more recently proposed techniques aim to render data-
sets both k-anonymous and non-discriminatory in a
single procedure with limited loss of accuracy (Hajian
et al., 2014; Hajian and Domingo-Ferrer, 2012). Having
transformed the data to increase privacy and remove
bias, the third party could then hand it over to the first
party for model development.
The advantage of this variation is that the first party
can develop whatever kind of model they like, without
the risk of it learning biases from the training data.
It also limits the involvement of the third party to a
single step, after which the data could be deleted.
Finally, it encourages the development of expertise on
the part of the specialist third party and doesn't require
the first party to have in-house knowledge about fair-
ness-aware machine learning. The disadvantage of this
approach is that the anonymisation techniques only
provide a degree of (quantifiable) anonymity. There is
a clear trade-off between degrees of anonymity and util-
ity of the dataset (Loukides and Shao, 2008), such that
useful datasets will still likely carry re-identification
risks. To the extent that such risks persist, the first
party could learn more about individuals' sensitive
characteristics in this variation than it could in the
other variations.
Who could act as a third party? We have thus far assumed
the existence of a suitable trusted third party, but it is
worth considering what kinds of organisations might
fulfil this role. This will likely depend on which of the
variations are adopted. Each might pose different
requirements of trustworthiness, technical expertise
and incentivisation. In the case of a third party whose
role is merely to detect disparate impact, relatively little
technical expertise would be required, making it suit-
able for organisations with fewer resources and tech-
nical skills. The fact that disparate impact is already the
focus of many civil society groups' research activities
may make them well situated to take on this role. Many
potentially affected minority groups already have active
representatives who could benefit from more formal
auditing roles. Depending on the application context,
it may be appropriate to involve different organisa-
tions; for instance, trade unions might be more
equipped to address the fairness of algorithmic
models deployed in human resources decisions.
If the third party is expected to be an ex ante dis-
crimination mitigator, they will require more data col-
lection and particular expertise in fairness-aware
techniques. It may therefore need to be a specialist
organisation, potentially working in collaboration
Veale and Binns 7
with appropriate civil society organisations. It could be
anticipated that consultancy or accountancy firms
might provide these services to corporate clients, as
they do with other forms of social auditing.7
Another option might be statutory or chartered
bodies whose remit includes monitoring discrimination,
promoting equality, or enforcing law. For instance, the
Equality and Human Rights Commission in the UK, or
the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the
US, are statutory bodies responsible for enforcing
equalities laws. While traditionally involved in review-
ing of individual cases for litigation, providing legal
assistance and intervening in proceedings, these
bodies could also take on more ongoing, data-driven
monitoring of data-driven discrimination. Bodies more
linked to data governance might help here too, such as
the Conseil national du nume´rique (French Digital
Council) or the data stewardship body recently recom-
mended by the Royal Society and the British Academy
(2017). State-sponsored API frameworks such as
GOV.UK Verify, where the public sector certifies com-
panies to provide verification services to third parties,
might also serve as a framework to allow auditors to
query trusted bodies for protected characteristics.
Knowledge bases about fairness
in data and models
Experiential knowledge concerning the construction or
attempted construction of ethical algorithmic systems
has been largely neglected in the DADM and FATML
communities. This has created a not insignificant know-
ledge gap that we believe has problematic consequences
on-the-ground. This neglect is surprising for several
reasons.
As data governance tools move increasingly towards
ex ante prevention and anticipation of harms, particu-
larly through data protection and privacy impact assess-
ments (Binns, 2017; Wright and de Hert, 2012), relying
solely on in-data analysis of unfairness appears not just
at tension with on-the-ground regulatory needs ­ it
could even be described as paradoxical. It certainly
seems problematic to have to link the data and train a
system before you can decide whether you should even
be doing either of those things. Many organisations
cannot legally or practically proceed with any data
work, even basic data access, cleaning, linking or explor-
ation, until this stage is passed. Yet DADM and
FATML approaches often implicitly assume that all
the ingredients are on the table to build the tool, and
the only decision to be made is whether to deploy or not.
Machine learning is a generic technology with
sector-specific applications. High profile, consequential
domains have included anticipating the geospatial dis-
tribution of crime (Azavea, 2015; Perry et al., 2013;
Wetenschappelijke Raad voor het Regeringsbeleid
(WRR), 2016), the need for child protection
(Vaithianathan et al., 2013) and the detection of tax
fraud (Khwaja et al., 2011; Sharma and Kumar
Panigrahi, 2012). Some ethical issues are sector- or
even location-specific, but others are likely to be
shared. Highly problematic issues might only appear
rarely, limiting their propensity to capture with in-
data analysis.
Limited implementation and education surrounding
DADM and FATML technologies threatens our ability
to cope with pressing issues in today's machine learning
systems. Even though this research field has some his-
tory (Andrews et al., 1995; Custers et al., 2013; Hajian,
2013; Pedreshi et al., 2008; Vedder, 1999), usable soft-
ware libraries remain largely unavailable, and little
training exists. Given the current lack of practical
ethics education in computer science curricula, rapid
change seems unlikely (Goldweber et al., 2011, 2013;
Spradling et al., 2008). A stopgap is sorely needed.
Diagnosing and addressing social and ethical issues
in machine learning systems can be a high capacity
task, and one difficult to plan and execute alone
or from scratch. Ethical challenges or appropriate
methods to tackle them might lurk within aspects of
envisaged that are easy overlooked, such as hyperpara-
meters, model structure, or quirks in data formatting or
cleaning. Some issues that might arise might also not
have their origins in the models or the data, but sur-
rounding social, cultural and institutional contexts.
Issues such as automation bias (Skitka et al., 1999),
where individuals either place too much trust or too
little trust in decision support systems, might be a syn-
ergistic result of both the model and the user interface.
Other issues might have their origins in a model but
likely solutions elsewhere. For example, for fairness
grievances which are particularly difficult to detect or
anticipate, better systems for decision subjects to feed-
back to decision-makers might be required. These
issues might not have one-size-fits-all answers, but
they are also unlikely to need to be treated as fresh
each and every time they arise.
Issues of changing data populations and correlations
are both currently under-emphasised in DADM/
FATML work and appear difficult to fully address
with in-data analysis. Concept drift or dataset shift
refers to either real or virtual (differently sampled)
changes in the conditional distributions of model
inputs and outputs (Quin
~ onero-Candela et al., 2009) ­
for example, how changes in law might qualitatively
affect prison population or the strategies of fraudsters.
Fairness and transparency are not static but moving
targets, and ensuring their reliability is important. But
anticipating change is technically difficult. Knowledge
around rates and causes of change can be tacit, obliging
8 Big Data & Society
us to carefully consider how best to use expert input
(Gama et al., 2013). In particular, these phenomena can
be hard to examine when changes are nuanced, or even
are a result of the actions of previous machine learning
supported decisions themselves. An important key role
for domain experts going forward is to explain and
record how and why certain types of concept drift
occur, rather than just help in their detection
(Z
 liobaite
_ et al., 2016).
Practical aspects of a knowledge base for fairness. Given the
above factors, we propose that a structured, commu-
nity-driven data resource containing practical experi-
ences of fair machine learning and modelling could
serve as a useful resource both in the direct absence
of sensitive data, and more broadly in its own right.
Such a resource, held online, would allow modellers
to record experiences with problematic correlations
and redundant encoding while modelling certain phe-
nomena, as well as sociotechnical ethical issues more
broadly (such as interpretability, reliability and auto-
mation bias), and detail the kinds of solutions and
approaches they used or sought to remedy them.
It could operate on a relatively open, trust-based
model, such as Wikipedia, or have third-party gate-
keepers, such as NGOs or sectoral regulators verifying
contributions and attempting to instil anonymity where
possible or desired. It would create a stepping-stone to
enable practical, albeit rudimentary, fairness evalu-
ations to be carried out today.
Linked data technologies have already seen sig-
nificant adoption in sectors where cross-organisational
collaboration around data is necessary (Bizer et al.,
2009). This does not necessarily mean an industry-
wide, comprehensive, rigid ontology for the purposes
of addressing the ethical challenges of machine learning
has to be adopted. Rather, a minimal adoption of
common practices would enable different organisations
to collaboratively annotate and describe the resource.
Several challenges would need to be addressed
before such a database could be implemented.
Similar variables and entities would need to be aligned
in order to make such a dataset structured and
navigable. Higher level common identifiers might be
needed to group variables even if the levels of such
variables were different. Some categorisations might
have given individuals the chance to specify non-
binary gender identities, or to opt out from this
question ­ but this is unlikely to make any correl-
ations or lessons found completely irrelevant or non-
transferable in practice. Database ontologies should
incorporate broader parts of the modelling process,
such as cleaning or user interfaces, but the best
format to do this is unclear. Arriving at it will likely
be a result of trial-and-error.
Metadata should also be standardised. What kind of
discrimination discovery methods were being utilised?
How could effect strength or statistical significance be
captured across these? It is likely that a descriptive
vignette would also be useful, particularly concerning
social processes and organisational context, but should
or could this take a standardised format whilst remain-
ing effective?
Such a dataset might benefit from discussion and
input from different viewpoints both within the organ-
isations submitting the information, but also externally.
Open annotation or discussion technologies might
contribute questions and context to the methods and
content of dataset entries (Pellissier Tanon et al.,
2016; Simperl and Luczak-Ro
¨ sch, 2014; Vrandec
 ic
´
and Kro
¨ tzsch, 2014). Technologies such as
StackExchange, a question and answer network ini-
tially aimed at developers, but recently with wider
adoption, have proved practically popular technical
and social tools for solving issues around software.
Such a database could take inspiration from the factors
that make knowledge communities run effectively in
these virtual environments. Allowing organisations to
trace the sources of the data in such collaborative
knowledge bases would also be key; in this respect,
much could be learned from proposed solutions to simi-
lar challenges in scientific data collaboration (Missier
et al., 2010).
Most data scientists are already used to working col-
laboratively online, through leading technologies in this
space such as Git, MediaWiki, or StackExchange. Yet
data scientists form only one part of the puzzle.
As discussed, fairness issues can concern different
parts of the modelling process, and as such viewpoints
from others such as user interface developers, project
managers and decision subjects would likely be valid
and useful. The technologies chosen should be clear
and accessible to those who are not used to working
in these virtual spaces, whilst incorporating the features
and extensibility that more developed solutions bring.
If they are not, they are likely to become exclusionary
and not see the widespread adoption that would make
them most useful.
It is not just modellers who can contribute informa-
tion to this knowledge base. Quantitative and qualita-
tive findings in the research literature that might be
relevant to particular fields or data sources could be
added. For example, considerable amounts of research
exist on areas such as financial literacy, recidivism
or child protection which are carried out with the
aims of improving their fields, but not directly to
make or inform decision support or decision-making.
These forms of evidence could be used to directly
inform model structure, or to inform in-data analysis
and search for ethical issues and concerns. Many of
Veale and Binns 9
these pieces of evidence are currently hard to locate ­
they are published across disciplines, behind paywalls,
or with research questions that do not make clear the
correlations that the research also unearths. In the
medium term, text mining and natural-language pro-
cessing might help populate such a database semi-
automatically.
DADM/FATML methods, given their own tech-
nical opacity to laypersons, come with their own
issues of transparency and legitimacy. Individuals are,
under the GDPR, entitled to know when automated
processing of their personal data is occurring, and for
what purposes, although there are practical caveats
regarding these rights (Edwards and Veale, 2017). Yet
for them to understand the potential harms that could
accrue to them by consenting is much trickier. Both
they and trusted independent third parties usually
lack the source data for investigative purposes. Even
if they had it, it is unclear that it would be hugely
useful or revealing given the rapidly changing nature
of these datasets and the patterns within and the
ample possibilities for data linkage that usually exist.
Yet what they are (usually) interested in is not the data
themselves, but the potentially problematic patterns the
data support. An evidence base might help individuals
or organisations understand what insights are held in
different forms of data.
Potentially confounding issues. The proposal is largely
grounded on the idea that organisations would be will-
ing to spend time and money on cooperating to create a
common resource. Primarily, this is a collective action
problem, as there are great incentives to free ride and
let others provide the information, which could result in
non-provision (Olson, 1971). This is compounded by
intellectual property concerns. If insights from data
are viewed through an IP or a trade secrets lens, this
could make organisations reticent to share.
Yet sharing of data for ethical purposes between
firms is far from unheard of, particularly in other sec-
tors facing similarly tricky societal challenges. Social
and environmental issues in the global clothing sector
are pervasive due to uncertainties around the environ-
mental impact of processes, materials and chemicals,
and uncertainties in the on-the-ground production sys-
tems characterised by multi-layered subcontracting.
The Sustainable Apparel Coalition (SAC) emerged as
a data-sharing body in 2010, now with over 180 mem-
bers representing well over a third of all clothing and
footwear sold on the planet. Together with the US
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), and with
several large data donations and collection projects
involving members, they have been developing the
open-source Higg Index to give designers tools to
better and more rigorously anticipate potential
products' sustainability further upstream. In some
ways, withholding data about ethical concerns and
potentially salient social issues could itself be seen as
a controversial, reputational risk.
Furthermore, the institutional field of the technology
sector does not seem unamenable to this form of
cooperation. Institutional fields create like-minded
communities of practice through three main mechan-
isms ­ coercive pressure, where influence from actors or
actants enforces homogeneity; mimetic pressures, which
stem from standard, imitative responses to uncertainty;
and normative pressures, which stem from how a field
coalesces and becomes professionalised (DiMaggio and
Powell, 1983). Some promising normative pressures can
be seen across the machine learning modelling field that
give hope for this ­ communities of voluntary support
on question­answer networks such as Cross Validated8
(which themselves support mimetic pressures); pro-
bono data science for non-profits on the weekends
through growing organisations like DataKind; virtual
discussions and events from field leaders on /r/
MachineLearning and Quora; expectations of contribu-
tions to open source software, to name a few. Proposed
coercive pressures, such as professional bodies, charters
or certification for data scientists might also play a role
here in the future.
Identifying and creating databases of `good' or `best'
practices is a common but also a problematic policy
approach to complex socio-technical challenges. This
approach can mislead, as practices are usually assumed
to lead to good outcomes rather than being treated as
hypotheses subject to serious monitoring and evalu-
ation. Even where evidence suggests good practices
work in one context, they may fail elsewhere
(Cartwright and Hardie, 2012). Instead of prescribing
`good practice', a database of experiences would serve a
more exploratory function. Several organisations are
well positioned to start or collaborate on such initia-
tives: private think-tanks such as Data and Society in
the United States, proposed bodies such as the national
data stewardship body described in a recent report by
the Royal Society and the British Academy (2017), or
one of many interdisciplinary collaborative melding
computer science and social science in universities
across the world. It might also connect individuals
facing similar challenges across the globe, creating cre-
ative, discussion-enabling support networks that help
like-minded individuals share advice, strategies and
even code to tackle the trickiest challenges together.
Exploratory fairness analysis (EFA)
The situations above assume that information on pro-
tected characteristics are either possible to obtain, or
available in parallel cases. Yet there may be situations
10 Big Data & Society
where such data is restrictively difficult to obtain at all.
Ambient computing, for example, judges people based
on rather disembodied and abstracted features that
environmental sensors can pick up, rather than through
a data-entry method. Yet these systems might also exhi-
bit fairness concerns; fairness concerns which might be
particularly tricky to deal with.
These situations, where the protected data are not
known, pose a difficult challenge for computational
fairness tools. Yet we propose that there are concrete
methods for these issues that while imperfect, could
prove useful practices to both explore and develop in
the future.
Building ex ante unfairness hypotheses with unsupervised
learning methods. Before building the model, data can
be examined for patterns that might lead to bias.
Exploratory data analysis is a core part of data ana-
lysis, but teaching, research and practice into it has
been historically marginalised (Behrens, 1997; Tukey,
1980). Results of previous research, such as DCUBE-
GUI or D-Explorer, have shown how visual tools
might help with the understanding of potentially dis-
criminatory patterns in datasets (Gao, 2015; Gao and
Berendt, 2011), even for novice users (Berendt and
Preibusch, 2014). Still, as with other methods, these
tools broadly come with the assumption that the sensi-
tive characteristics are available in the dataset, which
we have argued is often unrealistic.
If we assume that immediately sensitive data are
unavailable, simply understanding the correlations in
the dataset is of less use. Instead, the exploratory chal-
lenge can be seen primarily an unsupervised learning
problem. Unsupervised learning attempts to draw out
and formalise hidden structure in datasets. Through
unsupervised learning, we can hope to build an idea
of the structure of correlations within data. As we do
not have the sensitive characteristics, confirmatory ana-
lysis is difficult. This does not mean there is nothing to
be done. Exploratory data analysis has much to con-
tribute in the building of hypothesis and the directing of
future data and evidence collection as part of a broader
process of due diligence.
A relevant subset of unsupervised learning methods
we zoom in on here attempt to understand dataset
structure through estimating latent variables that
appear to be present. Some methods, such as principal
component analysis (PCA), try to create a lower dimen-
sional version of the data that captures as much vari-
ance as possible with a smaller number of variables.
Some social science methods such as Q-methodology
(McKeown and Thomas, 2013) use this approach to
try and pick up latent dimensions such as subjective
viewpoints. Other methods, such as Gaussian mixture
models, assume that datasets are generated from
several different Gaussian distributions, and attempt
to locate and model these clusters.
These forms of analysis can be used to build hypoth-
eses about fairness in datasets. For example, upon clus-
tering or identifying subgroups within a dataset (which
may or may not be related to any protected character-
istics), these groups can be qualitatively examined,
described and characterised. Experimental and sam-
pling techniques might be used to gain more contextual
information about the individuals in these clusters ­ for
example, if their sensed or captured behaviour correl-
ates with any sociodemographic attributes. These clus-
ters can be used before or during the model building
process to understand performance on different sub-
groups present in the data.
Building ex post unfairness hypotheses with interpretable
models. A second approach to in-data analysis without
access to protected characteristics examines trained
models, rather than the input data alone. Once
models have been trained, even complex models, there
are several methods that are available for trying to
understand their core logics in human-interpretable
ways.
The literature on understanding models such as
neural networks has traditionally distinguished between
decompositional interpretation and pedagogical9 inter-
pretation (Andrews et al., 1995; Tickle et al., 1998).
Decompositional approaches focus on how to represent
patterns in data in a way that both optimises predictive
performance whilst the internal logics remain semantic-
ally understandable to designers. Proponents of peda-
gogical systems on the other hand noted that not only
was it difficult to get a semantically interpretable logic
from models such as neural networks, although some
try (Jin et al., 2006). The tactic they have adopted,
which is broadly the domain of most current research
in interpreting complex systems, is to see the interpret-
ation as a separate optimisation problem to be
considered.
The concept of pedagogically interpretable models is
relatively simple to explain. The basic idea is to wrap a
complex model with a simpler one, which through
querying the more complex model like an oracle, can
estimate its core logics. Candidates include logistic
regression or decision trees. Increasingly, proposals
for the analysis of more complex models acknowledge
that the gap between the logics that can be represented
by the simpler model and the logics latent in a more
complex model are too vast to translate appropriately.
Image recognition is a case in point. Instead, proposals
in this area have tried to estimate the logics that locally
surround a given input vector ­ such as an image ­ to
understand why it was classified as it was (Ribeiro
et al., 2016b).10
Veale and Binns 11
Exploratory fairness analysts might manually exam-
ine mechanisms behind a model's core logics and ask if
they made sense. Specifically, analysts might wish to
consider whether they would be happy publishing such
information behind a model, or whether the public
might take issue with the way and reasons behind deci-
sions being made as they were. Some recent research that
has highlighted gender bias in word embedding systems,
which place words in relation to each other in high
dimensional spaces to attempt to map different dimen-
sions of their meaning, has gathered attention: and the
methods of bias identification in this area are related to
what we discuss here (Bolukbasi et al., 2017; Caliskan
et al.. 2017). Future research should tangibly explore
whether meaningful and relevant information about
datasets or models known to be somehow biased can
be discerned through this type of analysis.
Discussions and directions
Three approaches, three purposes
The three distinct approaches we have outlined in this
paper point to three possible avenues for exploration in
the research and practice of fairer machine learning.
Each of them is suited for different purposes.
The third-party approach, where another organisa-
tion holds sensitive characteristics that they use to
detect and potentially mitigate discrimination from
data and models, is primarily useful where trust in the
organisation interested in model building is low, or
potential reputational risk is high. Insurance or hiring
seem like prime cases here, particularly as they are areas
historically associated with bias over protected vari-
ables. A challenge with this approach is that it is not
easy to set up in low-resourced situations, or
unilaterally.
The collaborative knowledge base approach, where
linked databases featuring fairness issues noted and
experienced by global researchers and practitioners,
could be useful in a broad array of situations. It
might provide benefit where general uncertainty is
acute, risk assessment must be undertaken pre-
emptively, or risks are complex, changing and socio-
technical. Yet this requires a change of mindset.
Organisations involved in modelling should overcome
a reluctance to openly discuss their models, and will
need to dedicate time and money to give to as well as
take from such a shared resource. Anonymous contri-
butions could work as a model, but issues of who veri-
fies provenance of the information given, and how
easily it is to re-identify organisations based on model-
ling purpose would abound.
The exploratory approach requires the least organ-
isational set-up, as it can be undertaken unilaterally
on data where sensitive characteristics are not held.
Yet while this approach enables the construction of
questions and the probing of certain types of anomal-
ous or potentially problematic patterns in the data, on
its own it provides by far the least assurance that fair-
ness issues have been comprehensively identified,
assessed and mitigated. Further work should seek to
formalise methods of exploring data for these kinds
of patterns, and test modellers and processes for their
efficacy in identifying a range of synthetically induced
issues.
There are, unsurprisingly, limits to the effectiveness
of technological or managerial fixes to contested con-
cepts such as fairness. Unsupervised learning is particu-
larly challenging to evaluate fairness upon, given that
groups discovered are latent, although there has been
some recent work beginning to explore this space
(Chierichetti et al., 2017). Understanding fairness by
demographic will also be hard to grasp when those
demographics are latent ­ such as treating individuals
holding particular political views similarly in regards to
moderating content online (Binns et al., 2017). More
importantly, even though the three approaches we out-
line deal with different levels of formality and different
ways of understanding or conceiving fairness, they all
remain broadly centred on the software artefacts them-
selves. We do not suggest that either these approaches
or the broad mindsets that underpin them are sufficient
for understanding equity or mitigating discrimination
in a digital age. We do, however, tentatively suggest
that where these software artefacts are used to make
and support decisions, tackling technical aspects of
these issues is likely a necessary piece of the puzzle ­
neither more nor less important than others, such as
organisational culture, social methods of oversight, or
decisions about the intention or direction of deploy-
ment. We also would draw attention to larger chal-
lenges with predictive systems: that they might not
achieve social or policy goals at all by their nature
(Harcourt, 2006), or that fairness might not be the
most relevant issue as much as ideas of stigmatisation,
over-surveillance, or the devaluing of particular cul-
tural notions, such as family units (Blank et al.,
2015). Where there are inherent conflicting interests
between organisations deploying such systems and
those affected by them, co-operation may not be feas-
ible or desirable; affected groups may instead be drawn
(understandably) to more adversarial forms of resist-
ance and political action (Brunton and Nissenbaum,
2015; Danaher, 2016; Lyon, 2007).
Directions for empirical research
These three proposals illustrate how alternative institu-
tional set-ups and ways of knowing might help in the
12 Big Data & Society
governance of fairness in the context of machine learn-
ing. It focuses on one identified practical constraint ­
the absence of sensitive data. Each approach introduces
limitations, caveats and provides few guarantees of per-
formance. This might irritate researchers in this space,
yet it reflects the messy reality of many contemporary
on-the-ground situations.
We believe there are opportunities amidst the con-
straints. The practical limitations of fairness-improving
approaches, including these three, will only become
apparent upon their introduction and reflexive study
within real-world settings. In particular, our second
and third suggestions, concerning knowledge bases
and exploratory analyses, are not amenable to the
sort of mathematical guarantees that the DADM litera-
tures may find comforting. In these situation, process
evaluation is much more important than outcome evalu-
ation. Understanding the questions and challenges that
these methods do (or do not) address during the real
building, deployment and management of predictive
systems is key here. Only a small amount of work has
been done in this space (see Veale, 2017 for one exam-
ple), and we argue strongly that this should increase.
As we have noted, it is often unrealistic to assume
mathematically sound `debiasing' on-the-ground is pos-
sible, and this means it often unhelpful to apply the
validity conditions of traditional research in statistics
and computer science to discrimination-aware machine
learning. New technologies of this type should be at
least partially assessed on the extent of new capabilities
for responsible practices they afford practitioners ­ a
difficult, transdisciplinary and heavily value-laden task,
but a very necessary one.
Without this dimension, designed tools are likely to
stumble in surprising and even mundane ways, which
will affect their ability to deal with unfairness and dis-
crimination in the wild. It seems unlikely that statistical
guarantees of fairness will translate smoothly to indi-
viduals feeling that decisions about them were made
fairly ­ something as much a result of process as of
outcome. Researchers working in this space should
trial their proposed solutions, monitoring their imple-
mentation using rich and rigorous qualitative methods
such as ethnography and action research, and feed
findings from this back into tool revision and rethink-
ing. To adequately address fairness in the context of
machine learning, researchers and practitioners work-
ing towards `fairer' machine learning need to recognise
that this is not just an abstract constrained optimisation
problem. It is a messy, contextually-embedded and
necessarily sociotechnical problem, and needs to be
treated as such. This requires technical scholars to
better grasp the social challenges and contexts; but
also for social scholars to grapple more rigorously
with the technical proposals placed on the table,
and to ensure that critiques with operational implica-
tions reach the ears of the computing community.

Notes
1. Some of these measures have obvious shortcomings. In
particular, disparate impact has been criticised because it
fails to account for discrimination which is explainable in
terms of legitimate grounds (Dwork et al., 2012). For
instance, attempting to enforce equal impact between
men and women in recidivism prediction systems, if
men have higher reoffending rates, could result in
women remaining in prison longer despite being less
likely to reoffend.
2. Some have argued that a principle of data minmumisation
would enable better governance of these issues, rather
than mimalisation (van der Sloot, 2012). In some ways,
it could be argued that the existing regulation could be
already read through such a lens, but text interpretation
is not the focus of this paper.

could be applicable here, yet we do not seek to treat the
modelling organisation as a malicious adversary. The
methods here implicitly focus on organisations actively
wishing to increase trust and reduce discriminatory
outcomes.
6. Many researchers (e.g. Ossia et al., 2017) are currently
exploring how to bring parts of model training activities
away from cloud servers and onto a user's own device for
the purposes of increasing privacy, utilising mathematical
tools such as homomorphic encryption or zero-knowl-
edge proofs, and integration of fairness into these more
decentralised systems will likely be a research area for
future exploration.

space, such as Trilateral Research (http://trilateralre-

9. Pedagogical interpretation has recently been described as
`model-agnostic' interpretation (Ribeiro et al., 2016a).
10. This method is not exclusive to pedagogical methods, and
some recent work has shown how decompositional meth-
ods, which use components of model structure rather
than just treating it like a black box, also display strong
promise in this space (Montavon et al., 2017).
