Maternal Energy Stores and Diet Composition During
Pregnancy Program Adolescent Blood Pressure
Linda S. Adair, PhD; Christopher W. Kuzawa, BA; Judith Borja, PhD
Background--Fetal undernutrition is hypothesized to program blood pressure (BP) later in life. Human epidemiological
studies that use birth weight as a proxy for fetal malnutrition fail to identify specific aspects of maternal nutrition
responsible for programming.
Methods and Results--We examined how maternal nutrition during pregnancy and infant birth weight relate to systolic
and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) in 2026 Filipino adolescents. Data were collected prospectively during the Cebu
(Philippines) Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey. Women were assessed at 30 weeks gestation, and children
were followed from birth through adolescence. Regression models were used to examine how the mothers' total energy
intake, percentage of energy from protein and fat, triceps skinfold thickness during pregnancy, and infant birth weight
relate to adolescent BP, controlling for current age, height, and body mass index and other potential confounders.
Maternal triceps skinfold thickness was significantly inversely related to SBP among boys and to DBP in boys and girls.
Maternal nutrition variables attenuated but did not eliminate an inverse birth weight­SBP relationship in boys. SBP was
significantly inversely related to the mothers' percent of dietary energy from protein in boys. Among girls, SBP and
DBP were inversely related to the mothers' percentage of calories from fat. There was no evidence of confounding of
these relationships by current diet, maturation status, physical activity, or socioeconomic status.
Conclusions--Maternal diet composition and energy stores in the form of subcutaneous fat have long-term effects on
offspring BP in adolescence. (Circulation. 2001;104:1034-1039.)
Key Words: blood pressure  adolescents  pregnancy  nutrition
There is considerable evidence for an inverse relationship
between birth weight and blood pressure (BP) later in
life.1 Because fetal growth is largely a reflection of nutrient
and oxygen supply to the fetus, it is widely assumed that
prenatal nutrition is the most important programming stimu-
lus.2 The fetal programming hypothesis has led to the hope
that the risk of hypertension and other chronic diseases in
future generations might be reduced through improvements in
maternal nutrition during pregnancy.3 Birth weight is the
most commonly used measure of the quality of the prenatal
environment, but it is widely recognized as an imperfect
proxy for fetal nutrition. It is at best a sensitive but nonspe-
cific indicator of fetal growth reflective of a range of genetic,
hormonal, and nutritional factors. At present, the best evi-
dence that nutrition is an important programming stimulus
comes from studies of rats, showing that maternal protein
restriction during pregnancy leads to reduced birth weight
and elevated BP in offspring.4,5
Despite promising leads in animal models, few studies
have directly tested the fetal nutrition hypothesis in humans
by assessing the role of maternal nutritional status or dietary
intake during pregnancy. Several studies used maternal an-
thropometry to indicate nutritional status during pregnancy.
Clark and colleagues6 found that maternal weight gain be-
tween 18 and 28 weeks gestation was inversely related to
offspring BP among women with below-median triceps
skinfold thickness at 18 weeks gestation. Godfrey et al7
similarly found an inverse relation between maternal skinfold
thickness during pregnancy and offspring BP in Jamaican
children. In contrast, the study by Laor and colleagues8 of BP
in Jewish military conscripts found no evidence for an
association between BP and birth weight, maternal body mass
index (BMI) before pregnancy, or weight gain during
pregnancy.
Several studies have used the "natural experiment" of
famine to test the hypothesis, but results have generally been
contrary to expectations. Prenatal exposure to the Leningrad
Siege was found not to relate to adult BP.9 In the Dutch
Famine Study, individuals exposed to famine in utero did not
have elevated BP as adults, but their adult BP related
inversely to birth weight.10,11 A recent study from this cohort
found an inverse association between BP and the ratio of
protein to carbohydrates in the mother's diet during the third,
but not the first or second trimester, as reflected in ration

records collected during the war.12 There was no association
between offspring BP and maternal intake of total calories,
protein, carbohydrate, or fat, suggesting that diet composition
may be more important than total intake. Thus, the few
studies that include measures of maternal nutritional stress or
nutritional status during pregnancy provide mixed support for
the hypothesis that maternal nutrition is key to programming
in humans.
Our study examines the relationship of size at birth to BP
in Filipino adolescents, with and without considering indica-
tors of maternal nutritional status and dietary intake during
pregnancy. Our detailed longitudinal data also allow us to test
for potentially confounding variables such as current lifestyle
factors. Finally, we assess the contribution of current mater-
nal BP.
Survey Design and Sample
Data come from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition
Survey (CLHNS). This ongoing community-based survey
follows a cohort of 3080 infants born in 1983 to 1984. The
study area is Metro Cebu, the second largest metropolitan
area of the Philippines. The 33 communities randomly
selected for the survey include densely populated urban and
periurban neighborhoods and more isolated rural villages in
the mountains or nearby islands.
All pregnant women in the selected communities were
initially invited to participate and were included in the
longitudinal study if they gave birth between May 1, 1983,
and April 30, 1984 (n3327). Initial refusal rates were very
low (3%), but no data are available on those who declined
participation. Women were measured and completed a single
24-hour dietary recall during a baseline survey at a mean of
304 weeks gestation. Although numerous follow-up sur-
veys compose the CLHNS, the present analysis focuses on
data from the baseline, birth, and 1998 to 2000 follow-up
survey when adolescents were 14 to 16 years of age.
As indicators of the mother's nutritional status during
pregnancy, we used triceps skinfold thickness and dietary
intakes of protein, fat, and total energy at 30 weeks gestation.
Infant length was measured within 6 days of birth by trained
project staff using custom length boards. For hospital births,
birth weight was measured with hospital scales. Infants born
at home were measured by birth attendants provided with
Salter hanging-type scales and trained in their use. Gesta-
tional age was estimated from the mothers' reports of last
menstrual period date. If this was unknown, if pregnancy
complications occurred, or if the infant weighed 2.5 kg at
birth, gestational age was determined by the Ballard meth-
od.13 BMI was calculated as a measure of relative weight.
Anthropometric assessments in adolescents included
weight; height; arm, waist, and hip circumferences; and
triceps and subscapular skinfolds. Dietary intakes were mea-
sured with two 24-hour recalls on consecutive days, and the
mean was used in analyses. Energy and nutrient intakes were
calculated from Philippines Food Composition Tables pro-
duced by the Food and Nutrition Research Institute of the
Philippines. We included total energy and protein intakes in
our models. Physical activity was measured by Caltrac
accelerometer. Activity levels were categorized into high,
average, and low, representing thirds of the distribution of
24-hour Caltrac accelerometer counts. Adolescents were
asked about their smoking history and current smoking. BP
was measured in triplicate with a mercury sphygmomanom-
eter after a 10-minute seated rest, and the mean was used in
analyses. The same interviewer measured the adolescent's
and the mother's BP. The mother's BP during her pregnancy
with the index child was not measured. Household socioeco-
nomic status is represented by total household income and
possession of a television. We expect socioeconomic vari-
ables to affect BP primarily through more proximate deter-
minants, such as nutritional status and diet, but we include
them in analyses to account for other unmeasured determi-
nants of BP (such as stress levels).
From the original sample of 3080 single live births, 2089
adolescents were located and included in the 1998 follow-up
survey. Of these, 2026 had birth and current measurements,
and they form the main analysis sample. Slightly fewer
subjects (n1881) had maternal BP data. Birth weight and
length and BP in adolescence were not significantly different
in those with and without missing data. When data were
collected for the 1998 to 2000 survey, girls were completely
surveyed before boys. Consequently, boys are 1 year older
than girls. All analyses are stratified by sex.
Analysis Methods
Systolic and diastolic BP (SBP and DBP) were analyzed as
continuous variables by ordinary least-squares regression. We
first examined the relationship of birth characteristics to
adolescent BP, controlling for current age, height, and BMI.
We sequentially added maternal nutritional and BP variables.
We tested for confounding by current diet, activity, and
socioeconomic status of the adolescents, but because none of
these variables were shown to be confounders, we excluded
them from the final models.
Results
Characteristics of study participants are given in Table 1.
Cebu adolescents are relatively short and thin compared with
US adolescents. Compared with the new National Center for
Health Statistics reference,14 mean height z scores were
1.92 (SD0.81) for boys and 1.97 (SD0.86) for girls;
85.6% of boys and 70.7% of girls had a BMI below the age-
and sex-specific median; 40.8% of boys and 22.0% of girls
had a BMI below the 10th percentile. This BMI distribution
reflects delayed maturation relative to the US populations and
a higher prevalence of undernutrition. Median age at men-
arche was 13.1 years.15 No girls reported currently smoking,
but 5.5% of boys reported currently smoking regularly. Low
birth weight (2.5 kg) occurred in 10.0% of the analysis
sample, and 20.4% were small for gestational age (birth
weight for gestational age below the 10th percentile of a
commonly used reference population). We have no data on
prepregnancy BMI. On the basis of weight 2 months after
giving birth, 15% of women had a BMI suggestive of
chronic energy deficiency (BMI18.5).
There was no significant crude relationship of birth weight,
length, or gestational age to SBP or DBP in boys or girls.
Gestational age had no significant main effect, nor did it

modify the effects of birth weight or length, so it was dropped
from subsequent models. The adolescent's current diet, ac-
tivity, maturation status, household socioeconomic status, and
household socioeconomic status during the mother's preg-
nancy were not consistently associated with BP, nor did they
substantially alter the relationship of birth or maternal char-
acteristics to BP. Accordingly, we focus on results from 4
models. Model 1 includes birth weight and length and current
age, height, and BMI. Model 2 adds maternal anthropometry
during pregnancy, model 3 adds maternal diet during preg-
nancy, and model 4 adds current maternal BP. Results for
SBP and DBP are shown in Tables 2 and 3, respectively.
Systolic BP
In boys, there was a significant inverse relationship of birth
weight to SBP only after control for current height, age, and
BMI (Table 2, model 1). As expected, SBP was highly related
to current age, height, and BMI in both boys and girls.
Maternal height and triceps skinfold thickness during
pregnancy were significantly inversely related to SBP in
boys. Addition of maternal pregnancy variables in model 2
attenuated but did not eliminate the birth weight­SBP rela-
tionship. Birth size and maternal anthropometric variables
were unrelated to SBP in girls. The relationship of maternal
diet variables during pregnancy differed in boys and girls
(model 3). In boys, percent of dietary energy from protein
was inversely related to SBP, whereas in girls, a higher
percentage of calories from fat was significantly associated
with lower SBP. The relationship of the mothers' height and
skinfold thickness during pregnancy to SBP remained virtu-
ally unchanged when birth weight and length were omitted
(not shown). The mother's SBP was significantly related to
SBP in boys and girls (model 4), suggesting either a genetic
effect or an unmeasured effect of a shared environment.
As judged by the R2 values, birth and maternal nutritional
characteristics played a minor role. Birth weight, however, is
significantly positively related to height and BMI in adoles-
cence and thus may have direct and indirect effects on BP.
Diastolic BP
Among girls, birth length was inversely related to DBP after
control for current size. This weak relationship was un-

changed by the addition of maternal nutrition variables but
strengthened with the addition of the mothers' DBP. There
was no relationship of birth size to DBP in boys. Maternal
skinfold thickness during pregnancy was inversely related to
DBP in boys and girls, independent of birth weight and
length. A higher fat content in the mother's diet during
pregnancy was significantly associated with lower DBP in
girls, but there were no significant maternal diet­BP relation-
ships among boys. The mother's DBP was significantly
associated with boys' and girls' DBP in adolescence.
Discussion
The inverse relationship of size at birth with BP at later ages
is now well established by substantial animal and human
epidemiological evidence, although in humans, the relation-
ship is weakest during adolescence.1 Animal models of
dietary restriction during pregnancy implicate inadequate
maternal nutrition as the critical determinant of altered
physiology leading to elevated BP. Evidence from human
studies of maternal nutrition during pregnancy, however, is
sparse. Godfrey et al7 found an inverse relationship of
maternal triceps skinfold thickness at 15 weeks of pregnancy
with SBP in a small sample of 10- to 12-year-old Jamaican
children, but Laor et al8 found no relationship of maternal
anthropometry during pregnancy with BP in a large study of
17-year-old Israeli youths. Our study shows that low maternal
fat stores at 30 weeks gestation are associated with higher
SBP and DBP in adolescent boys. Consistent with other
studies,1 we also observed an inverse relationship of birth
weight to SBP in boys. The SBP­birth weight relationship,
however, was attenuated (but not eliminated) when maternal
triceps skinfold thickness was taken into account. The signif-
icant association of maternal triceps skinfold with BP, inde-
pendent of birth weight, suggests that maternal nutrition is
indeed an important programming stimulus. Our earlier
CLHNS studies show that maternal height and triceps skin-
fold thicknesses during pregnancy significantly predict infant
birth weight and length.16 Our BP results, however, suggest
that important aspects of maternal nutrition during pregnancy
are not fully captured by birth weight. At the same time, the
marginal birth-weight relationship with SBP in boys after
maternal nutrition is accounted for suggests that birth weight
serves as a marker for factors unrelated to the aspects of
maternal nutrition measured in this study.
There are several possible explanations for this finding.
First, our limited measures of maternal nutrition during
pregnancy most likely leave much variation in these factors
unmeasured. The birth-weight effect in boys might have been
further reduced if we had more comprehensive measures of
maternal nutritional status. Alternatively, birth weight may be
a proxy for some nonnutritional aspect of the maternal or fetal
environment. For example, fetal exposure to maternal glu-
cocorticoids triggered in response to stress reduces fetal
growth in rats and permanently programs activity of the
hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis in offspring, with effects
on postnatal BP regulation.17
Little is known about which specific aspects of maternal
diet serve as programming stimuli. Most animal models of
fetal programming of BP impose maternal dietary protein
restriction during gestation,5 although one study18 imposed a
30% energy restriction. The generalizability of these results
to human populations may be limited, because highly re-
stricted protein or energy intakes in the absence of other
nutrient deficiencies are not typically seen in humans. We
examined total energy intakes and the relative contribution of
protein and fat in the maternal diet during pregnancy. Among
adolescent boys, SBP was inversely related to the mother's
percentage of energy intake from protein during late gesta-

tion, independent of birth weight and maternal triceps skin-
fold thickness during pregnancy. This is consistent with
animal models that document elevated BP in the offspring of
rats fed a protein-deficient diet during pregnancy.5,19 In girls,
SBP and DBP were inversely related to the mother's percent-
age of energy intake from fat during pregnancy.
In a study of Aberdeen adults, Campbell et al20 found
different effects of the mother's carbohydrate intake on BP,
depending on the level of animal protein in the diet, with
low-carbohydrate, high-protein intakes related to reduced
placental size and increased BP later in life. These relation-
ships diverge from our findings, which suggest a BP-lowering
effect of maternal protein intake during pregnancy, as indi-
cated by the percentage of calories derived from protein. Our
findings are consistent with the recent observations of Rose-
boom and colleagues,12 who find evidence for an inverse
association between the ratio of protein to carbohydrates in
the maternal diet during the third trimester and offspring BP
but no association between total calories, protein, fat, or
carbohydrates and offspring BP. Our findings are similar in
showing a lack of association of total maternal energy intake
with offspring BP but an inverse association with percentage
of calories from protein. These results suggest an effect of
diet composition rather than total intake. Given the potential
for future public health preventive measures through altered
maternal diet during pregnancy, there remains a need to
clarify the role of the macronutrient and micronutrient com-
position of the maternal diet and its consequences for off-
spring physiology.
We find marked sex differences in relationships of early
exposures to BP. Other studies find inconsistent sex differ-
ences: some find effects in boys, others in girls, but as yet, no
physiological models have been proposed to explain these
findings. Among adolescents, maturational stage, insulin
resistance, and sex steroid levels are believed to alter BP
during puberty.21 Inclusion of maturation variables did not
reduce sex differences in our results, nor did maturation status
modify or confound the relationship of birth weight or
maternal nutritional status with adolescent BP. Measurements
of sex steroids are needed, however, to clarify the physiolog-
ical basis for sex differences in relationships between prenatal
exposures and later risk for cardiovascular disease.
The present study helps fill important gaps in the fetal
programming literature. First, few studies have been con-
ducted on adolescents in a developing country context, where
fetal programming may have the greatest importance. In
countries undergoing a nutrition transition, high rates of fetal
growth retardation in previous decades are now being fol-
lowed by substantial improvements in socioeconomic status
and a concomitant increase in exposure to cardiovascular
disease risk factors, such as sedentary lifestyle and increased
energy and fat intakes, which are contributing to increasing
obesity prevalence.22 Our results suggest that maternal nutri-
tion during pregnancy and fetal growth outcomes have
long-term implications for BP regulation in a population
relatively early in the nutrition transition.
Second, other studies have raised questions about the
degree to which the relationship of maternal nutrition or birth
weight to BP is confounded by exposure to other risk factors
in the period between birth and the measurement of BP. We
observed no confounding by the adolescent's diet, activity,
maturational status, or indicators of socioeconomic status.
Third, our study may contribute to the debate surrounding
the possible role of genetic factors with common influences
on fetal growth and BP regulation23 by assessing the role of
the mother's BP. Although we do not directly assess specific
genetic factors, our inclusion of maternal BP provides indi-
rect evidence of a possible role of genetics. Inclusion of
maternal BP in multivariate models strengthened associations
between birth length and BP in girls and between maternal
nutritional status and BP in boys. Thus, although there may
be some genetic determination of BP (as shown by the
positive association of maternal and adolescent BP), the
associations that we document are not likely to be explained
by genetic factors with common effects on BP and our
perinatal predictor variables.
In summary, this study supports the hypothesis that
maternal nutritional status during pregnancy has long-term
implications for offspring BP regulation in humans. Low
maternal energy stores during pregnancy predict higher
SBP and DBP in adolescent boys. Although inconsistent in
boys and girls, the inverse association of maternal protein
intake and offspring BP is consistent with findings in
animal models and deserving of further exploration in
human populations.
