Introduction
A large number of students learning English are facing the
challenges of carrying over their writing instructions to other
tasks, disciplines, and languages. In the academic writing
contexts of L1 and English as L2, students usually rely on
their intuitions developed throughout years of reading differ-
ent materials to achieve the purpose. To reconcile the dis-
crepancy that usually emerges in the students' L2 writing
performances, the English for academic purposes (EAP)
writing courses can offer a quick and promising solution
(James, 2010). That is, students who are offered EAP writing
are very likely to benefit from their learning in such a writing
class to perform equally well in other disciplines and also
languages (Marini & Genereux, 1995). This idea helps gather
that learning in one particular context is tantamount to devel-
oping skills for similar contexts. That is, it is likely that men-
tal structure or thought that is developed in one context is to
a large extent the determinant of writers' oral or written per-
formance. However, it must be borne in mind that the issue
of learning transfer can be a very intricate one which requires
in-depth investigation to be exhaustively mapped. In other
words, learning transfer can variably depend on context, stu-
dents, disciplines, languages, language components and even
the emotions of the instructor and students. Prompted by the
thorny issue of whether such a writing class can be helpful,
the present research thus aims to dig a bit deeper into learn-
ing transfer from an English for General Academic Purposes
(EGAP) writing course into tasks, disciplines, and two
languages.
Previous Studies on Learning Transfer in Writing
Writing courses can be aimed at either specific goals or gen-
eral purposes. In other words, writing can be viewed on a con-
tinuum ranging from specificity of learning outcomes
(English for Specific Academic Purposes or ESAP) to the
general features of the disciplines (English for General
Academic Purposes or EGAP), where learning outcomes are
transferred across disciplines (Jordan, 1997). In ESAP, learn-
ing is expected, due to its specificity, to transfer to tasks and
contexts which are almost similar to those already learned. In
contrast, EGAP is thought to permit transfer of learning out-
comes on a global level across similar and dissimilar tasks,
contexts, and disciplines. Having said that, the challenge that
arose is that while in ESAP transfer indisputably occurs due
to the specificity of features, in EGAP general features are
reportedly claimed to be elusive and not capable of transfer-
ring (Haskell, 2001). Moreover, despite the calls for disci-
pline specificity in university English for specific purposes
(ESP) contexts (Wardle, 2009; Zarei & Mansoori, 2011),
Hyland (2002) and Petraglia (1995) asserted that writing
instruction across the globe has turned to EGAP for the trans-
fer of learning to be achieved. Given the conditions around,

Learning Transfer in English for General
Academic Purposes Writing
Gholam Reza Zarei1 and Ali Rahimi2
Abstract
This article was launched to investigate if learning from an English for General Academic Purposes (EGAP) writing course
transfers to other writing contexts. The study focused on the issue of transfer across disciplines, tasks, and two languages
(English and Persian). The data were collected through interviews and writing samples from the participants' own EGAP
class and their other courses in the university (non-EGAP). The interviews were transcribed and coded for the self-reports
of learning transfer, and the writing samples were analyzed for the 10 learning outcomes already instructed in the class.
The results demonstrated that transfer of learning was variably achieved within interview-based transcriptions and writing
samples, though to a varying degree. Showing high degree of conformity and a roughly similar general regularity, both series
of data indicate that learning transfer does occur, though inconsistently, across disciplines, tasks, and the two languages.

though EGAP seems to be commonly practiced worldwide,
the effective role of EGAP writing instruction from a stand-
point of transfer is quite unclear theoretically and practically.
Theoretically, the position on the impossibility of transfer
is supported by a few researchers who have cast doubt over
the transfer from an EGAP course. For example, Johns
(1988) challenged the applicability of such an instruction for
preparing English as a second language (ESL) students to
start academic activities as he believed that general features
of the course are not conducive to enhancing the communi-
cation from one course to another. Likewise, Hyland (2002)
and Spack (1997) questioned the transfer of discipline-based
general skills and strategies across new situations. They
assumed that situational differences usually require students
to attend to a number of extraneous issues which are not nec-
essarily identical. Apart from the above L2-based explana-
tions, L1 writing researchers present no different comments
on the possibility of writing general skills transfer either. As
a case in point, Russell (1995) rejected the idea of the writing
skills transfer across all genres and activities as he believed
there is no generalizable set of strategies to be transferred.
Turning to the practical investigations, the results are far
from conclusive and seem quite mixed. The following expla-
nations review further the two important contexts of L1 and
L2 writing research and their ensuing conclusions on the
issue of transfer of writing skills.
As regard L1 writing instruction context, James (2010)
claimed that some general writing instruction projects in L1
have provided evidence of transfer, though they have involved
only the participants' self-reports. As two examples, Nelms
and Dively (2007) and Allen (2008) concluded their projects
with participants showing transfer of general writing skills
across different courses and improving their grades. This nar-
row view of transfer is also evidenced by Ahrenhoerster
(2006) who compared the scores of students after one-semes-
ter and two-semester long general writing instruction, with
the latter outperforming the former and hence concluding the
effect being that of transfer. In the same vein, Fallon, Lahar,
and Susman (2009) demonstrated the participants' self-
reports of transfer in a task and across one field of study, that
is, psychology. Contrary to the above pieces of research work
documenting transfer, some investigations have reported no
transfer through L1 general writing instruction. Wardle (2007)
carried out a study on transfer of learning and discovered that
students made no use of their instructions in general writing
courses.Also, in another study by Wardle (2009), the students
could not find any relationship between their general writing
course and some similar tasks in different courses. The fact
that students were not able to establish any link between their
instruction and writing does not necessarily rule out the pos-
sibility of transfer (James, 2010).
Unlike contradictory results of L1 settings reviewed
above, the research on L2 writing instruction has revealed
the transfer of learning from EAP writing courses. As an
example, Snow and Brinton (1988) produced evidence of
transfer across the two disciplines of geography and psychol-
ogy. Also, James (2006) showed that a content-based EAP
course led to the transfer for engineering undergraduates.
Two more studies on L2 writing courses have documented
occurrence of transfer to some degree (Leki, 1995; Leki &
Carson, 1994). In both of these studies, students were
required to identify the aspects or strategies of their previous
or current ESL which were helpful in their academic studies.
However, these students were concerned with EAP rather
than EGAP writing instruction. Spack (1997) investigated
academic literacy development in an EGAP writing course.
Though not particularly focused on transfer, the study
showed that the participant transferred from EGAP writing
course the strategies of what to do as for the gist and details
in the subsequent readings.
As seen above, all the above-mentioned studies in L2 con-
text have treated transfer indirectly and globally. But, James
(2008) focused on a variety of learning objectives deter-
mined in advance and concluded that learning can transfer
from EGAP writing course to other similar conditions. In
another study, James (2010) put transfer into a new perspec-
tive as it occurred in genuine tasks and across disciplines. He
also showed that transfer is likely where multiple tasks and
disciplines are considered.
As the above-reviewed studies in contexts of L1 and L2
give a very conflicting and unclear picture of transfer and
also due to the fact that EGAP writing instruction may help
students do their composing jobs in other academic programs
much better, and also prompted by the fact that inter-lingual
transfer of learning, especially from L2 to L1 can be a new
arena of exploration, the present study is intended to cast fur-
ther light on the issue. Moreover, the present study intends to
specify a number of learning objectives (targeted learning
outcomes) in one part of the study and decide on their trans-
ferability in addition to the global self-reported transfers of
the elements by students (general learning elements). Note
that learning elements refer to those general elements that the
participants reported in their interviews to have learned and
carried over to their writing tasks. And targeted outcomes are
those specific learning elements which have already been
determined, focused, and practiced in the writing class and
then studied for their transfer in other writing tasks. The
interview-based, participant-reported learning elements and
targeted outcomes as distinct categories of descriptions were
borrowed from the study already carried out by James (2010)
and applied as the model of analysis in this study.
Research Question
Research Question 1: Are learning elements in general
and targeted outcomes in particular likely to transfer from
EGAP to different writing conditions?
Research Question 2: Which learning elements or tar-
geted outcomes are most prone to transfer across disci-
plines, tasks, and two languages of English and Persian?

Method
Design and Participants
The study used a qualitative design as it is considered appro-
priate for portraying a detailed picture of phenomenon occur-
ring in natural contexts. Transfer of learning as the main goal
of the study was thus investigated qualitatively in a real con-
text of learning. The study conducted in 2009-2010 at Jihad
Education Center affiliated to Isfahan University of
Technology, involved 13 students of different fields, who
volunteered to attend an optional EGAP writing course. This
course was an optional one titled "English Writing," offered
as extracurricular and to be taken only by voluntary students.
These students were rather good at English language profi-
ciency as assessed through English language performance on
their university entrance exam (all had achieved 60% up to
76% on the nationwide exam) and wished to improve their
language command for pursuing their education at graduate
level. Of these participants, 8 were female, 5 male, all junior,
with the age range of 21 to 25, and all spoke Persian as their
mother tongue. The study continued for one 16-week-long
semester as it is believed that transfer requires some time to
occur and it cannot happen instantaneously (Haskell, 2001).
The study aimed at developing students' writing skills that
could be transferred to different university courses. With this
goal in mind, it was expected that the treatment would pave
the way for the transfer to occur across different disciplines,
tasks, and languages. It must be noted that the design of the
study was partly a replication of the James's (2010) study on
the same topic. Though the textbook and learning goals as
categories of description were taken from that study, the con-
text, subjects, and tasks used were not quite identical.
Furthermore, this study incorporated some different fields of
the study as the students attending the class came from a
variety of different disciplines. In respect of disciplines, this
study can hardly be considered an exact repetition of James's.
Most importantly, James's study did not take into account the
reverse direction of transfer which may be likely from L2 to
L1. Thus, the present study is distinct from that of James in
the analysis of inter-lingual transfer of writing skills.
Materials
Following the study by James (2010), the study used the
book named The St. Martin's Guide to Writing (Axelrod &
Cooper, 2004). The book incorporates some general writing
exercises such as arguing a position, proposing a solution to
a problem and also some writing strategies such as compar-
ing/contrasting, defining, and classifying. An interesting
point is that the book lists a number of different learning out-
comes for different disciplines (see Appendix A). These
learning outcomes were to be clearly studied as transfer ele-
ments and herein, modeled on James's study (2010), they
were identified as "targeted outcomes." The targeted out-
comes are thus distinguished from the self-reported learning
elements which are elicited from interviews. The rationale
for this distinction is not only to discover how participants
deal with and transfer the issues which bear resemblance or
otherwise across contexts and languages, but also to see if
the analyses through the two modes remain complementary
to and supportive of each other, in fact, a cross-verification
technique (triangulation).
Treatment
The class was taught by the first researcher who already had
a long record of teaching writing courses at undergraduate
and graduate levels. On reviewing and enhancing the book
contents in each session, the students were required to indi-
vidually compose, collaboratively revise, and proofread their
own drafts on different topics. The sessions were mainly held
in the English language with infrequent switches to Persian
wherever better communication was needed. The teacher
was also involved actively in reviewing and revising the stu-
dents' drafts to improve and finalize them. The topics stu-
dents worked on varied from remembering an event,
explaining a concept, to arguing for or against an idea. These
were supposed to represent three types of writing, namely,
narrative, explanatory, and argumentative, respectively; the
types of writing are not considered in the present study.
Data Collection
The first step to collect the data was taken through interviews
(Appendix B) in which the participants were asked about the
possible transfer of general learning elements into their writ-
ing samples (certain descriptive categories based on James's
study were considered as listed in Table 2). The possibility of
transfer was examined across tasks, disciplines, and languages.
One session of interview was done for each writing sample.
The interviews were audio-recorded and then transcribed for
the analysis of learning outcomes. The 39 interviews lasted for
15 min and max 22 min each, the average being 17 min.
The second step in collecting the data was related to the
participants' samples of writing in the EGAP class and their
own university disciplinary courses. They handed in their
writing samples written in Persian and in English to the
researchers for the analysis (see Table 1). Participants sub-
mitted a total of 39 samples from their writing class, each
participant with three samples. The EGAP samples were all
written at the end of the semester as we expected the partici-
pants to make use of or transfer what they had already
learned. They also handed in 29 samples of writing from
their own fields of studies (non-EGAP), 12 of which were in
Persian and 17 of them in English. It must be noted that with
the agreement and encouragement of the professors of differ-
ent courses, theses participants had written their course
assignments in English. The writing samples varied in con-
tent, length, organization, and format, with some being one
page, others more, and also of different kinds of tasks, for
example, reports, research projects, summaries of reading,
case studies (see Appendix C).

Data Analysis
First, the data obtained in the interview transcripts were
checked for the general learning elements participants
reported to have transferred in their samples. Then the writ-
ing samples were examined for the targeted learning out-
comes transfer from EGAP (see Table 3). For the analysis of
interview data, this study drew on the techniques used by
James (2010) and Miles and Huberman (1994). First, the
transcripts were divided into particular parts which focused
on different disciplines and tasks, and then later they were
organized into two categories of languages (English and
Persian). The tasks were categorized using Horowitz's
(1986) framework under four tasks, namely (a) Report (R),
(b) Research project (RP), (c) Summary of reading (SR), and
(d) Case study (CS) (see Appendix C).
The interview transcripts were carefully read for the
transfer of learning elements from EGAP. Learning elements
were determined based on the list originally developed by
Chapelle, Grabe, and Berns (1997), and used by James
(2010). The list of learning elements is presented in Table 2.
Moreover, the targeted outcomes for the writing samples
were identified using the list already prepared by James
(2010). This list consisted of 10 outcomes extracted from the
first chapter of the textbook (see Appendix A). The learning
outcomes were all selected from the first chapter of the
selected writing book as it is believed that participants must
have enough opportunity in at least one semester to transfer
the learning elements (James, 2010). To analyze the learning
elements in the writing samples, first all different tasks were
examined and the elements specified, and then they were
checked across languages and disciplines and tasks for their
possible transfer. The similarity between the discovered
points within the tasks and the learning elements guided the
researchers further to investigate the transfers and the exact
nature of them. The researchers argued away the differences
with one of the colleagues familiar with the procedure and
tried to settle the issues convincingly.
To ensure the consistency of the results, the researchers
repeated the procedure for data analysis after 3 months indi-
vidually and coded about 40% of the data again. The intra
coder reliability value turned out to be about 95%.
Results and Discussion
The study aimed to investigate the transfer of learning from
an EGAP writing class. Furthermore, it set out to see if trans-
fer can occur across tasks, disciplines, and the two languages
of English and Persian. The results of the analysis confirmed

that transfer occurs in all the above-mentioned situations to a
varying degree.
The following eight categories are the frequency-based
list of general learning elements which were discovered as
cases of transfer obtained in EGAP and non-EGAP in the
analysis of self-reported interview transcripts (see Table 2
for a summary). In the following analyses, the term case
actually indicates the exact instance of, for example, "vocab-
ulary" (then equal to the number of times), participants
reported each of the learning elements they transferred from
their writing course to the new writing tasks.
Interview-based learning elements
1. Vocabulary (45 cases across all four tasks, disciplines
and two languages). In regard to this particular case,
the students talked about some vocabulary items which
they had transferred to the new writing contexts form
the EGAP course. Most of these vocabulary items
were used in the English writings (n = 33) and also
some Persian equivalents in the Persian writings (n =
12). As regard the tasks, R, RP, SR, and CS received
17, 11, 9, and 8 of total transferred items, respectively.
Also, English writings had the most use of such trans-
ferred items (n = 19) followed by Psychology (n = 13),
Chemistry (n = 7), and Electrical engineering (n = 6).
The following is an excerpt from the interview, which
shows the student relied on EGAP for composing in
other contexts (all the following excerpts are rough
translations from Persian):
Researcher: Remember anything, for example, vocabu-
lary, . . . you used from your EGAP?
Student: Well, I think so. Anyway I usually depend on my
learning, sometimes things learned recently or in the past.
Researcher: Which vocabulary is here the one already
used in your class? Show me, please!
Student: Ok, let me see, . . . please see this example: "indi-
cate," "believe," . . .
2. Syntactic rules (27 cases across all tasks, disciplines,
and only English language). The second category
which was transferred most from the EGAP class was
syntactic patterns and rules learned in that course. The
subjects made direct or indirect reference to grammar
or structure of the language learned in the class which
was transferred to other writing contexts. From highest
to lowest frequency, the tasks of RP, R, SR, and CS and
disciplines of English language, Chemistry,
Psychology, and Electrical Engineering experienced
the transfer of learning. No mention of the transfer was
made concerning structural patterns in Persian writ-
ings. In the following excerpt, a participant discussing
his task explains that he corrected his sentence struc-
tures by resorting back to the EGAP class:
[In response to the inquiries of the researcher,] the student
said: "This is [pointing to a sentence before him] the
mistake I made in my class, but in this writing I avoided
it. I think the class helped me not to make that mistake
again."
Researcher: What is it? Can you explain the rule again?
Student: Oh, yes, after the subjunctive clause "require
that" I used "is" in the class, but in this "Report," I
know the correct form is "be."
3. Resource use (21 cases across all tasks, disciplines, and
languages). In this category, students discussed their
skills in gathering information, summarizing, using
quotes, and writing references correctly, taken collec-
tively as resource use. Of the tasks, R, SR, RP, and CS
involved 11, 6, 3, and 1 cases, respectively. Also,
Chemistry, Psychology, English language, and Electrical
Engineering were reported to have used cases of trans-
fer. It is interesting that the two languages used almost
equal transfer cases (English 10 and Persian 11). The
following is an excerpt from the interview with a stu-
dent who talked about his attention to the references:

Researcher: In your case study, did you also use your
learning from EGAP class?
Student: Yes, that course helped a lot. For example, I tried
to follow the referencing according to the instructions
from that book.
Researcher: Which of the references, in particular?
Student: All of them, both in the texts and the last list of
references, here look! The way this is italicized; the
pagination, and commas . . . etcetera.
4. Coherence (17 cases across all tasks, disciplines, and
English language only). This category involved stu-
dents' use of devices to achieve coherence such as
"transitions," "conjunctions," and the words "whereas,
hence, and nevertheless." Of the 17 cases of transfer
reported, SR, R, RP, and CS had 6, 4, 4, and 3 cases,
respectively. As for the disciplines, Psychology came
first and then English, followed by Chemistry and
Electrical Engineering. Persian writings were not
reported as enjoying the transfers of this category. This
does not mean that the Persian language does not enjoy
the property of coherence, but that the participants did
not mention their uses of coherence-related devices
emanating from their writing course, hence not consid-
ered transfer. The excerpt below is an example of the
use of what a student learned from her class:
Researcher: You have used "whereas" to show the con-
trast, did you know this before your class?
Student: No, this is also the word I learned from EGAP
class. Before that I did not know it.
Researcher: What is the meaning of the word?
Student: I know that this links two distinct and different
clauses; I mean in terms of meaning they must be
different.
5. Organization (16 cases across all tasks and three disci-
plines and the two languages). The students in this cat-
egory showed how they organized their writings
including the "introduction, body, and conclusion,"
sequencing of the ideas (problems first followed by
solutions) and the unity (thesis statement and para-
graph main and supporting sentences). The tasks which
were reported to have used this transfer case included
CS, R, RP, and SR, listed from highest to lowest.
Disciplines of English, Psychology, Electrical
Engineering, and Chemistry were the ones in which
transfer of this category occurred. Of the two lan-
guages, all the transfers were mentioned for the English
writings. The following is a piece of evidence from an
Electrical Engineering student who was asked about
the assignment (Report) he had handed in to his
teacher:
Researcher: It seems that you have divided your assign-
ment into a neat sections of "Introduction, body, . . .,"
Did you do this consciously or is it the way you usually
do?
Student: Well, this is certainly based on what I received
from my writing class.
Researcher: Did you actually find this method of arrang-
ing your assignments suitable and desirable?
Student: Yes, sure. I think this gives your writing a better
quality and on the whole can attract the attention of the
reader. Also, the reader can track down the steps very
clearly.
6. Process use (12 cases across all tasks, disciplines and
the two languages). This refers to the fact that students
carry out their jobs in a series of steps to get completed,
form the first drafts to the final one. The four tasks
were reported to have used this piece of learning each
3 times. From high to low frequency, the disciplines of
Chemistry, Psychology, English, and Electrical
Engineering showed transfer. Regarding the two lan-
guages, English writings used 8 and Persian writings
just 4 cases of transfer. The following example shows
that the student of psychology redrafted her writing
task before submission:
Researcher: . . . Ok, . . . the next point is, "did you have to
revise your writing again and again?"
Student: Yes, of course, one important strategy to com-
plete and finalize the work is to see the drafts again and
change them in order to improve the quality.
Researcher: Was this point learned in your writing class or
. . .?
Student: I knew something before but the EAGAP course
helped me think of this more and more and now I
remembered to do it because of the emphasis in the
class.
7. Topic development (10 cases across all the tasks and
the two languages). Students focused on the way they
developed their topics through using "examples, defi-
nitions, comparisons, and details." The tasks from high
to low frequency which relied on such transfer included
RP, R, SR, and CS. The disciplines were English,
Psychology, Chemistry, and Electrical Engineering. In
regard to the languages, English language used 9 cases
and Persian 1 of this transfer. For example, the follow-
ing student from English Major says that he always
stops to think of the direction of the discussions and
supporting examples, or any piece of document impor-
tant to the writing.
Researcher: What more did you learn from your class?
Zarei and Rahimi 7
Student: I came to understand that writing an argumenta-
tive essay needs some advance organization; so I
thought about the body and proper contents for my
writing.
Researcher: Any particular example for your proper con-
tent in this writing sample?
Student: Yes, after completing the introduction, I stopped
to think about the main body. There I found, for exam-
ple, the supporting sentence concerning the reasons for
the expansion of delinquencies as the topic of the essay.
My EGAP class helped me increase my reliance on the
explanations, reasons, and why of things very well.
8. Efficient writing (seven cases across three tasks, four
disciplines, and the two languages). This category
involved easy, fast, smooth writing of the tasks as a
result of the learning in EGAP. R, RP, and SR made use
of this transfer category. Chemistry, Psychology,
English, and then Electrical Engineering also relied on
the transfer of "efficient writing." English writings
enjoyed six cases of this transfer as reported by the
students, and Persian writings had just one case. The
following is an example from a student of Chemistry
who asserts his writing ability improved a lot due to
the instructions received in the class:
Researcher: Overall, do you think your EGAP class
affected your approaches to writing?
Student: Yes, of course. Before this class I usually
digressed from one point to another and had a hard
time finding the track to the end. Now, I first think
about the topic and very easily put my thoughts
together.
Researcher: Do you mean you can write more comfort-
ably now?
Student: Oh, yes. I think I can finish the job more quickly
and at the same time much better in terms of quality.
All in all, of these eight general learning elements, a total
of 155 cases of transfer were reported to occur. As for the
tasks, Reports (R) registered a record of 53 ranking first and
Case Studies (CS) hit the frequency of 26 standing in the last
position. In disciplines, it was English language (E) which
gained 58, being first in rank, and Electrical engineering
(EL) 19, standing last. Of the two languages, English wit-
nessed more transfer of learning (126 cases) and Persian just
29, that is, about 19%.
On the whole, all the participants reported that they had
transferred their learning from EGAP. Also, transfer was
almost common across all the tasks, disciplines, and the two
languages. Nevertheless, variations can easily be observed in
the disciplines, tasks, and the two languages. For example,
the discipline "English Language" enjoyed more of transfer
compared with others. In the same way, the task of "Report"
was more prone to transfer. Also, English writings made
more use of transfer in comparison with Persian, probably
because of the natural linguistic proximity between the
instruction and instructional textbook and those tasks.
Targeted outcomes.Apart from the results obtained from
interview transcripts above, the writing samples of the stu-
dents were also analyzed for certain categories of targeted
learning outcomes taught and practiced in the EGAP class.
The same issues of discipline, task, and language were inves-
tigated in the light of the 10 targeted learning outcomes from
the textbook (AppendixA).As stated before, students handed
in 68 samples of writing both from EGAP class and their
own courses where they were given the chance to write their
assignments in English in addition to Persian. A total of 387
cases from the 10 learning outcomes were identified to have
been transferred (Tables 3, 4, and 5). This total number
includes all the three variables of task, discipline, and lan-
guage, in each of which some variation was visible. To round
up the overall findings, we can gather that the students have
had the potential opportunity to use the learning outcomes
each at least once in their samples, amounting to 10 for each
sample and totaling 680 for the 68 samples analyzed. The
overall obtained frequency (387) compared with the poten-
tial opportunity of 680 generates 57% and a mean frequency
(MF) of 0.57 for all the 3 variables collectively considered.
Table 3 reveals the proportion of transfer used within the
selected disciplines. The 10 targeted outcomes are variably
and inconsistently scattered across the four investigated dis-
ciplines, with the "English Language" ranking first (MF =
7.1) and "Electrical Engineering" last (MF = 4.15) and the
other two standing in between. As regard individual learning
outcomes, the column highlighted under "Si," signifying use
of similes/metaphors, unfolds the most marked variation,
across the disciplines and also across the tasks and languages.
The two disciplines of "Chemistry" and "Electrical
Engineering" permit 0 and 1 case of transfer, respectively,
while the other two, namely, "Psychology" and "English
Language," show a multi-fold increase. This discovery prob-
ably originates in the differences between the disciplinary
requirements for such an issue as simile or metaphor (Si),
indicating that hard sciences unlike soft sciences may tend to
concretize the events rather than metaphorizing them.
Concerning the maximum observed transfer, the category
"Tra" or "using temporal transitions" shows the highest rate
(75), again with the first two hard sciences' representatives
registering a rather lower number, and similarly "English
Language" discipline highest. This finding may be accounted
for through the fact that the English major classes are doubly
directed and instructed to abide by the principles of writing.
The English discipline also shows the highest use of the 10
targeted learning outcomes with the MF of 7.1. The differ-
ences of the learning outcomes are however found to be
meaningfully distinct across the four studied disciplines.
Table 4 shows that the 10 targeted learning outcomes
spread irregularly across the 4 categories of the tasks. "SR"
8 SAGE Open
or summary of reading registers the lowest and highest fre-
quency in regard to the least common and most common
transfer categories of learning outcomes, namely, "Si" and
"Co," respectively. Whether by accident or design, a possible
explanation to this finding is that SR is very much bound by
the confines of the text that is read and has to be re-delivered
textually. It can be hypothesized that this particular task
(SR), because heavily dependent on the already polished
content, is thus removed from the imaginative nature of free
writing and composing process (in using "Si"), the result
being least metaphorical yet at the same time most observant
of a mechanical feature (in using "Co"). This may have also
arisen from the stylistic or rhetorical nature of special task
types, which of course could hardly be verified here due to
the holistic design of the study. Whatever the cause, this
issue opens up a new rewarding area for further inquiry.
Regarding the overall variations, it can be seen that "R"
(Report) shows the highest MF (6.3) and the other 3 almost
very close and around 5. The inferential analysis does not
demonstrate a meaningful difference among the tasks.
The last point was whether the two languages of Persian
and English differed in the transfer of the targeted learning
outcomes. As can be seen, most of the learning outcomes
have been transferred in the English language, nearly twice
those in Persian (MF = 6.23). Also, of the two categories of
"Si" and "Tra", representing least and most transferred out-
comes, respectively, English language, compared with
Persian, shows the highest rate of transfer. One reason for
this may be the greater portion of writing samples written in
English, though the MF also proves the same trend. Another
more plausible explanation could be the textbook which was
in English and also the instruction which was predominantly
given in English. The English dominated medium of instruc-
tion may sensitize and thus bias the learners toward the
English language as a purported carrier of such learning out-
comes taught. It may be claimed that writing performances
are strongly pinned down to some predetermined attributes
and outcomes which have been attained in the classroom.
Furthermore, it must be noted that learners' performances
usually tend to find most congruity with the instructional
materials especially in the case of language learning, where
unlike content courses, negligible latitude is expected on the
part of learners. The difference between the two languages,
as can be clearly seen, proves meaningful.
And finally, comparison of the two broad sets of data from
interview transcripts and writing samples show a high degree
of conformity. Interestingly, the cases of transfer are identi-
cally represented in the two languages and also disciplines
across interview transcripts and samples of writing. In both
sets of data, English and Persian as two languages show dis-
tinct transfer trends with English accommodating 2 times
more. Also, disciplines of English and electrical engineering
portray the same image of transfer, the former maximum and
latter minimum across the two sets of data. As for the tasks,
the maximum transfer reveals a similar disposition, with "R"
(Reports) coming first in both sets of data. The only

negligible inconsistency across tasks in the two sets of data
concerns the minimal transfer occurring in "CS" for interview
transcripts and "RP" for writing samples. Thus, the combined
results from the two sets of data show a high agreement and
illuminate the ubiquity of transfer across the disciplines,
tasks, and languages, though variation is inevitable.
The above-reviewed results of this study reconfirm the sig-
nificance of transfer to be addressed in EGAP or similarly in
EAP classes as students always have to implement their learn-
ing beyond their immediate needs to some more practical
areas of concern. As this study was partly related to the previ-
ous rather identical one by James (2010), a few comparative
words are thus in order. In regard to the results obtained from
interview-based transcriptions, the present study reveals a dif-
ferent general trend from that of James. The first and foremost
point is that the participants in this study dwelled on the
"vocabulary" as their first choice of transfer, while this is quite
reversed and receives the least attention, thus appearing at the
end in James's study. Similarly, and as a radical digression
from James's study, the transfer of "syntactic rules" occurs as
the second most important component in our study.Apart from
the differences, the two studies, however, bear some resem-
blance. For example, the two transfer cases of "coherence"
and "process" stand in the same positions, or also "efficiency"
appears to be close to each other in the standing in the two
studies, which may show that the participants in the two stud-
ies have found these two issues required in the same way. With
respect to the transfer across tasks, the two studies seem to
diverge widely, as our study reveals a comparatively more
consistent tendency with the transfer components occurring
across all the four tasks, excluding "efficiency" which has
been transferred across three out of four. The across-task trans-
fer for the James's study proves more varied, with "organiz-
ing" and "vocabulary" transferred across seven and one task
out of seven, respectively. "Disciplines" in the two studies,
though different and distinct, also enjoy the varied occurrences
of transfer.
The two studies compared on the basis of the second set
of data, that is, the samples of writing and targeted outcomes,
bear general similarities, though the tertium comparationis is
not absolutely identical because different tasks and disci-
plines have been used in the two studies. However, as for the
disciplines, the two studies converge on the fact that the dis-
ciplines associated with humanities in general, as compared
with natural or technical courses, seem to unfold in the same
way. But, within the disciplines, the types of targeted out-
comes are not similarly transferred. In the present study, the
maximum number belongs to "transitions" and minimum to
"similes, while this is quite different (min: "vis; sig; nar;
sim" and max: "Fus"). As for the transfer across tasks, the
two studies show almost the same trend, with all the tasks
receiving such transfers though they are not exactly similar.
The differences of the two studies point to the differences in
the conditions, tasks, and disciplines and also participants
and very likely their proficiency levels.
The findings here are in line with James's (2010), indicat-
ing that EGAP writing classes can result in the learning
transfer, though the transfer of learning may not be uniform
across different tasks and disciplines. Hyland (2002) also
stated that such writing instruction confirms the view of lit-
eracy that maintains technical skills and rules are usable
across any situation.
Another important result of this study is that the specific
learning outcomes related to the language use and mechanics
have been transferred most, especially as shown in the inter-
view-based data above, which is a verification of the results
obtained by James (2009) and a near contrast to the study of
James (2010).
The results of the study further shed light on the fact that
the observed consistency of transfer across tasks, as far as
studied here, would not be an indication that the tasks can
provide radically different conditions leading to sharp dis-
tinctions and demands for transfer variation. Thus, there may
be some other factors at work to modify the conditions under
which transfer may occur (Perkins & Salomon, 1994).
As an additional dimension of the present study, two lan-
guages of English and Persian revealed differences in the
transfer from the EGAP course. English language tasks of
writing showed twice more instances of transfer than the
Persian tasks. Yet, the interesting point is that both languages
made most use of "tran" as the targeted learning outcome.
The results of inter-lingual analysis of transfer somewhat
contradicts the idea that whatever thought developed by the
writers can be expressed and regenerated elsewhere not nec-
essarily tied to any special language (Berman, 1994). In other
words, this study demonstrates that the participants are rela-
tively less subject to transfer writing skills from L2 into L1
contexts than from L2 into L2 contexts. This finding may be
accounted for by the students' unbalanced linguistic reper-
toires in the two languages, including vocabulary or grammar
(Cummins, 1991), which requires further future inquiries.
Also the differences of transfer in the two languages show
that the second language learning contexts (e.g., James's
study) differ from the conditions in a foreign language learn-
ing setting (this study) where students may look up to the for-
eign language instruction for their performance in the same
language (L2) and thus distinguish their L1 skills from L2 in
a more polarized manner. Of course, this new dimension of
the L2-to-L1 transfer interface needs more substantiation
before the results could be generalized or practically used.
Conclusion
As a fundamental topic in education in general and L2 con-
texts in particular, transfer of learning has been empirically
under-investigated in the academic writing instruction
(Wardle, 2007). This study is thus a response to the call for
transfer-focused investigations directed toward the learning-
specific components such as exact skills, strategies, languages,
tasks, disciplines, or goals which are likely to affect transfer
10 SAGE Open
(Nelms & Dively, 2007). In regard to EGAP writing instruc-
tion, the results of the present study contribute to the literature
of and discussions around the issue, and in line with Wardle
(2009), Spack (1997), and Bergmann and Zepernick (2007)
reiterated the transferability of learning outcomes across dif-
ferent tasks, disciplines, L1 and L2. The findings further sup-
port Widdowson's (1984) suggestion that broad-based
education such as the general ESL instruction can lead to
transfer of learning while narrow training such as ESP instruc-
tion may fail to produce the same results. The same idea of
local knowledge versus global knowledge and the transferabil-
ity of the latter recommended by Perkins and Salomon (1988)
is also corroborated by the findings of the study here. However,
it must be noted that the variations observed across learning
outcomes and also typologies of tasks, languages, and disci-
plines suggest that EGAP classes are not to be taken as a tran-
scendental purveyor of skills, tackling the problems of any
kind arising in any academic program. In the same vein, James
(2010) asserted such investigations cannot meet all the global
needs of writing for all the students.
As commonly accepted, the transfer of learning occurs as
a function of different variables such as type of knowledge to
be transferred, conditions under which to transfer, individu-
als' preferences for transfer, tasks, and so on, occurring at
different rates and in different ways (Smit, 2004). To sub-
stantiate the idea and as a piece of evidence, James (2009)
discovered that learning outcomes of "language use" are
more likely to transfer than those related to "content or orga-
nization." Similarly, the findings of this research partly vali-
date James's discovery, as it was also found in the present
study that the most frequent category of transfer in interview
data, namely, "vocabulary" was an example of language use.
Nevertheless, the analysis of writing samples goes contrary,
revealing "use of temporal transitions," an instance of "orga-
nization," as the most occurring transfer, which obviously
stands in stark contrast with James's finding. This last point
of contradiction brings up the important issue of conditions
under which learning transfers. While L2 settings may call
for students' special perception of task for the transfer to be
achieved (James, 2010), L1 settings may demand students'
motivation (Bergmann & Zepernick, 2007) or also their
emphasis on amount of writing practiced (Nelms & Dively,
2007). As an interplay between L1 and L2, we have also
found that an English-medium EGAP tends to develop biased
conditions for the direction of learning transfer as the results
indicated the students' inclination toward carrying over their
learning from EGAP to the writings in English rather than in
Persian. In contrast to the above point, Berman (1994)
believed that thoughts that are generated by writers can be
expressed in different ways and that thoughts are not depen-
dent on any particular language. He thus tries to associate the
transfer of thoughts not to the language of instruction but to
the proficiency that students develop in a particular language
as well. Thus, he claims that transferability of writing skills
requires a threshold of grammatical competence. The role of
proficiency brings up an important point and can encourage
further studies on the inter-lingual transferability of writing
skills. Still, one point worth attention is that in such a study a
distinction must be made between the language-based ele-
ments of transfer and other conceptually driven skills in writ-
ing such as organization or planning, and so on. This is
because not all different learning elements can be transferred
universally. Moreover, we need to pay close attention to the
direction of transfer as well, to see whether it is L1 which
gives way to the transfer of learning more effectively or L2.
Theoretically, it seems that Cummins's (1991) interdepen-
dence theory of L1­L2 in the context of writing can account
for the variations of this direction. However, the differences
of conditions and contexts such as a foreign language versus
second language context and also limiting role of proficiency
and writers' depth and breadth of world knowledge can be
very important issues to consider.
Overall, the results suggest that EGAP classes be reori-
ented toward particular instructional goals focusing on the
transfer of certain learning outcomes which are useful to the
success of the prospective writers. The instructional goals may
be geared toward those outcomes that are more likely to trans-
fer under certain conditions. In this line of thinking, a number
of scholars (James, 2010; Johns, 1999; Perkins & Salomon,
1988;Willingham, 2009) recommend modifications to instruc-
tional approaches used in EGAP with premium given to teach-
ing-for-transfer techniques. The implementation of such
techniques can most probably save students lots of time and
energy in achieving the far-reaching and lifelong goals of edu-
cation. It must be noted that the variability observed suggest
that learners' cognitive capacity function flexibly and non-
mathematically in response to different types of input.
Consequently, we need to transform our classes into some
milieus that accommodate learners' individual differences. To
achieve this goal and actually that of moving away from
teacher-controlled instruction to learner-directed learning,
Mahdavi, Fazlollahtabar, Heidarzade, Mahdavi-Amiri, and
Rooshan (2008) recommended "relinquishing much of control
over planning and selection to learners" (p. 4604).
Limitations
Similar to any other study of descriptive nature, this study
suffers from a number of shortcomings, which may confound
the external validity of the results. As one important point,
this study considered all the participants on a holistic basis
while an intra-individual design could analyze individuals'
behaviors separately and come up with some clearer picture
of the differences and preferences. Also, the study focused
on the transfer within a pre-established range of learning out-
comes, whereas it could have taken into account peripheral
learning transfer not already defined. The present study can-
not categorically verify that all the transfers of learning pos-
sibly resulted from the writing course. To do this, a different
design examining the pre-instruction status of students seems
Zarei and Rahimi 11
necessary. For example, it is very likely that students' episte-
mological beliefs affect their learning and it would be quite
illuminating to consider their beliefs a priori. Taking stu-
dents' feedbacks on their performances, as it occurred in
interviews here, can offer an alternative. Furthermore, this
study stressed the frequency and amount of transfer while an
analysis of transfer effect on the performance of students
could make a very good choice of research. Another short-
coming stems from the short period of time, which seems not
to fit the longitudinal nature of transfer. This study did not
take into account the critical role of the learners' age or
socio-cultural backgrounds, which could make a big differ-
ence if learners are in their growing years.
Also, the claims made here in relation to EGAP could
have been more reliable if ESAP had also been investigated
for the transferability of local versus global knowledge.
