BACKGROUND: It has been hypothesized that exposure to exogenous estrogens may be associated with endometrio-
sis and uterine myomas. We sought to investigate the association between heavy metals which have been shown to be
hormonally active and these disorders using data from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1999­
2002. METHODS: Women aged 20­49 years who had data on metals and the outcomes of interest, were premenopau-
sal and neither pregnant nor breastfeeding were eligible (n 5 1425). Lead, cadmium and mercury were measured in
whole blood. Diagnosis of outcomes was based upon self-report. Logistic regression was used to examine the associ-
ation between tertiles of heavy metals and disease adjusting for age, race/ethnicity, use of birth control pills prior
to diagnosis and smoking status at diagnosis. RESULTS: A dose­response association between cadmium and endo-
metriosis was observed [tertile 2 versus 1: adjusted odds ratio (OR) 5 1.94, 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.73­
5.18; tertile 3 versus 1: adjusted OR 5 3.39, 95% CI 1.37­8.40]. This association persisted in subanalyses: (i) limiting
analysis to women diagnosed in the past 10 years and (ii) limiting analysis to women diagnosed since last pregnancy,
although limited by sample size. CONCLUSIONS: These results must be interpreted with caution given the cross-
sectional study design. The observed association between cadmium and endometriosis deserves further investigation
in properly designed studies.

Introduction
Endometriosis and uterine myomas are prevalent gynecologi-
cal disorders. Approximately 10% of women of reproductive
age in the USA are diagnosed with endometriosis (Wheeler,
1989) with lesions present in 20­50% of women undergoing
laparoscopy for infertility (Matorras et al., 1995). The inci-
dence of uterine myomas is 2­13 cases per 1000 person-years
with a lifetime cumulative incidence of 70­80% (Schwartz
et al., 2000; Baird et al., 2003). Given the prevalence of
disease and cost of treating the associated problems of inferti-
lity, pelvic pain and abnormal uterine bleeding, endometriosis
and uterine myomas represent a major public health problem in
the USA (Mauskopf et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2006a,b). Despite
this, few risk factors have been identified for either of these
disorders.
Endometriosis has been associated with being of white race,
higher socio-economic status, leaner body mass, earlier age at
menarche, non-smoker, exercise and various environmental
exposures (Mayani et al., 1997; Eskenazi et al., 2002;
Missmer and Cramer, 2003; Hemmings et al., 2004; Hediger
et al., 2005; Louis et al., 2005). Myomas have been associated
with being of black race, an increased body mass index
(BMI) and non-smoker (Schwartz et al., 2000). Both uterine
myomas and endometriosis are considered estrogen-dependent
diseases and have been associated with increased expression of
estrogen receptor-a (ERa) in diseased tissues compared with
non-diseased tissues (Brandon et al., 1995; Benassayag et al.,
1999; Matsuzaki et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2001). Given both
diseases are hormonally related, it has been hypothesized that
exposure to exogenous estrogens may be associated with
disease development (Hunter et al., 2000; Schwartz et al.,
2000; Birnbaum and Cummings, 2002; Rier, 2002).
Some heavy metals have been shown to have endocrine dis-
rupting properties, interfering with the hypothalamic­pitu-
itary­ovarian (HPO) axis. Many adverse reproductive effects
related to heavy metals have been observed in both toxicologi-
cal and epidemiological studies; however, studies in relation to
endometriosis and uterine myomas have been limited and
inconsistent (Gerhard et al., 1998; Krugner-Higby et al.,
2003; Heilier et al., 2004; Nasiadek et al., 2005; Heilier

et al., 2006). Lead, cadmium and mercury have all been shown
to inhibit the binding of estradiol to the ERa receptor (Stoica
et al., 2000; Martin et al., 2003; Brama et al., 2007) with
lead and mercury having potential anti-estrogenic effects
(Young et al., 1977; Martin et al., 2003) and cadmium
having estrogenic effects (Young et al., 1977; Stoica et al.,
2000; Johnson et al., 2003; Brama et al., 2007). All three
metals are ubiquitous in the environment; however, the main
sources of lead exposure are through lead-based paint, and con-
taminated soil, dust and drinking water; cadmium exposure is
primarily through cigarette smoke, air pollution and contami-
nated food and mercury exposure through fish consumption,
air pollution and dental amalgams (ATSDR, 1999a,b, 1990).
Given this evidence, we used data from the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) 1999­2002 to
examine the association between various heavy metals and
endometriosis and uterine myomas. Given the estrogenic prop-
erties of cadmium, we hypothesized that cadmium would be
positively associated with an increased odds of endometriosis
and uterine myomas, whereas lead and mercury would show
either no associations or protective associations.
Materials and Methods
Data source
We used data from NHANES 1999­2002 to examine the association
between heavy metal levels in blood and having a previous diagnosis
of endometriosis or uterine myomas. NHANES is a cross-sectional
national survey that assesses the health and nutrition of children and
adults in the USA through questionnaires, physical examinations
and laboratory tests. In 1999, the survey became a continuous,
annual survey with 5000 individuals interviewed per year. The
study population is a stratified, multi-stage probability sample of the
civilian, non-institutionalized US population. From 1999 to 2002,
the study was over-sampled for low-income persons, adolescents,
persons over 60 years of age, African Americans and Mexican Amer-
icans. NHANES includes both a household interview and mobile
examination component (MEC). Detailed information regarding the
NHANES survey can be found from the study website (http://www.
cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm).
Study population
Women participating in the MEC and who completed the reproductive
health questionnaire were eligible for analyses (n ¼ 6815) (Fig. 1).
Questions regarding endometriosis and uterine myomas were
restricted to those women 20­54 years of age, reducing the eligible
population to 2818 women. Women who were currently peri- or post-
menopausal (n ¼ 718), or pregnant and/or breastfeeding (n ¼ 581)
were excluded from analyses as their current heavy metal levels
may have been influenced by these circumstances and less representa-
tive of heavy metal levels at the time of diagnosis (Berkowitz et al.,
1999; Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2000; Garrido et al., 2003; Akesson
et al., 2002; Dorea, 2004). An additional 94 women where excluded
from analyses as they were missing data on heavy metal levels. This
resulted in further limiting the age range of eligible women to 20­
49 years of age as mercury was not measured on women 50 years of
age or older on the assumption they had completed their childbearing
years.
Diagnosis of endometriosis and uterine myomas was based upon
two questions: (i) `Has a doctor or other health professional ever
told you that you had endometriosis? Endometriosis is a disease in
which the tissue that forms the lining of the uterus/womb attaches
to other places, such as the ovaries, fallopian tubes etc.' and (ii)
`Has a doctor or other health professional ever told you that you
had uterine fibroids? Uterine fibroids are benign (non-cancerous)
tumors growing in various locations on or within the uterus/
womb'. Women reporting disease were further queried regarding
their age at first diagnosis. Additional information on menarche,
gravidity, parity and hormone use was obtained from the reproduc-
tive health questionnaire. Data on other factors of interest such as
demographics, alcohol and smoking were obtained from their
respective questionnaires.
Blood was drawn during the MEC for the purpose of measuring
heavy metal levels, with lead and cadmium measured for all individ-
uals 1 year of age or older and mercury measured for individuals 1­5
years of age and 15­49 years of age. Blood was collected in
EDTA-anticoagulant vacutainers prescreened for background metal
contamination. Analyses for lead and cadmium were done by graphite
furnace atomic absorption spectroscopy and mercury by cold vapor
atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The limits of detection were:
lead, 0.3 mg/dl; cadmium, 0.3 mg/l and mercury 0.2 mg/l.
Statistical analysis
Appropriate sample weights were used for analyses taking into
account the complex sampling design and non-response of the
NHANES survey. Sampling errors were estimated using the Taylor
series linearized method. Women eligible and ineligible (pregnant,
breastfeeding, peri- or post-menopausal or missing heavy metals
data) for analyses, as well as eligible women with and without
disease, were compared on various demographic, lifestyle and repro-
ductive health factors using Pearson's x2 test (categorical variables),
Student's t-test (continuous, normally distributed variables) and
Kruskal­Wallis test (continuous, non-normally distributed variables).
The association between tertiles of heavy metals and endometriosis or
uterine myomas was assessed using unconditional logistic regression
providing an odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI) for
the association between exposure and disease. An OR greater than
1.0 indicates a greater odds of disease associated with exposure,
whereas an OR less than 1.0 indicates a decreased odds of disease
associated with exposure or a potential protective effect. If the CI
does not include 1.0, then it is statistically significant. All three
heavy metals were entered into the multivariable models together in
order to examine the effect of the main metal of interest while control-
ling for the effects of the other two metals. Factors shown in the litera-
ture to be associated with heavy metals or the outcomes of interest or
that changed the association between heavy metals and outcomes by
more than 10% were examined as potential confounders. Furthermore
in selecting potential confounders, we took into consideration the
timing of diagnosis and measurement of exposure and whether
current information on the confounder would be relevant to the
exposure­outcome relationship. In the case of smoking and birth
control pills, we were able to determine use in relation to the timing
of diagnosis; however, we were unable to do so for alcohol consump-
tion or BMI based upon the data collected and therefore did not
include them as potential confounders. Parity and gravidity also
were not considered as potential confounders as timing of diagnosis
in relation to specific pregnancies could not be determined. Further
analyses limiting cases to those diagnosed within the last 10 years
and those diagnosed after their last pregnancy were undertaken
given concerns that heavy metal levels may have changed over
time. Additionally, we examined the association between metals and
outcomes among post-menopausal women, given the high proportion
of women with disease who had hysterectomies and were therefore

excluded from the main analysis. A P-value of ,0.05 was considered
statistically significant for all analyses. Stata, version 9.0 was used for
all analyses.
Results
Women who were 20­54 years of age and responded to the
endometriosis and fibroid questions were excluded from ana-
lyses if they were pregnant, breastfeeding, peri- or post-
menopausal or had missing data on heavy metals (Fig. 1).
Among excluded women (n ¼ 1393), 48% were premenopau-
sal, 13% were peri-menopausal, 35% were post-menopausal
and menopausal status could not be determined for 4%; 21%
reported having had a hysterectomy (data not shown). Ineligi-
ble women were significantly more likely to have been diag-
nosed with endometriosis or uterine myomas than eligible
women (P , 0.001) (Table I). This was most likely due to
the fact that the mean age of ineligible women was nearly
5 years older than eligible women (P , 0.001) and both endo-
metriosis and myomas tend to progress until menopause. Fur-
thermore, women with endometriosis or myomas were
approximately nine times more likely to have had a hyster-
ectomy than women without disease (P , 0.001) and were
therefore more likely to be excluded from analyses. Eligible
women also differed significantly from ineligible women by
race/ethnicity, poverty ratio, marital status, BMI, smoking,
alcohol consumption, gravidity, parity and ever use of birth
control pills (Table I). Ineligible women had significantly
higher blood lead levels, but significantly lower total blood
mercury levels than eligible women; there was no significant
difference in blood cadmium levels between the two groups.
Among the 1425 eligible women, 61 (6%) reported a pre-
vious diagnosis of endometriosis and 114 (8%) reported a pre-
vious diagnosis of uterine myomas. The above included 16
(1%) women who reported having a prior diagnosis of both
endometriosis and uterine myomas (Table I). The mean age

of the study population was 33.7 years. The majority of the
population was White, non-Hispanic (67%), had more than a
high school diploma (61%) and was married (61%). Approxi-
mately 25% of the women were current smokers and 22%
drank more than two alcoholic drinks per week at the time of
the survey. Twenty-six percent of women had never conceived
and 32% were nulliparous.
Women with endometriosis were significantly more likely to
be White, non-Hispanic than women without endometriosis,
but the two groups did not differ significantly by age,

metriosis diagnosis was 27.0 years. Women with uterine
myomas were significantly older (39.2 versus 33.0 years of
age; P , 0.001), and more likely to be Black, non-Hispanic
(21% versus 11%; P , 0.001) compared with women
without uterine myomas. The mean age of uterine fibroid diag-
nosis was 33.5 years.
Women with endometriosis [geometric mean (GM)
0.53 mg/l; 95% CI 0.44­0.64] had significantly higher
cadmium levels compared with women without endometriosis
(GM 0.42 mg/l; 95% CI 0.41­0.44) (Table III). Women with
uterine myomas had significantly higher lead (GM 1.25 mg/
dl; 95% CI 1.12­1.39 versus GM 1.12 mg/dl; 95% CI 1.08­
1.15) and mercury (GM 1.28 mg/l; 95% CI 1.03­1.59 versus
GM 0.97 mg/l; 95% CI 0.92­1.03) levels compared with
women without uterine myomas. Women who had diagnoses
of both uterine myomas and endometriosis did not have signifi-
cantly different metal levels than women who had neither
disease (data not shown).
There was a dose­response association between cadmium
exposure and endometriosis in unadjusted analyses with a stat-
istically significant association between the upper tertile of
exposure and disease (tertile 2 versus 1: OR ¼ 1.80, 95% CI
0.68­4.77; tertile 3 versus 1: OR ¼ 2.84, 95% CI 1.13­7.13)
(Table IV). This association persisted and became stronger
after adjusting for lead, mercury, race/ethnicity, smoking
status at the time of diagnosis, use of birth control pills prior
to diagnosis and age (tertile 2 versus 1: adjusted OR ¼ 1.94,
95% CI 0.73­5.18; tertile 3 versus 1: adjusted OR ¼ 3.39,
95% CI 1.37­8.40). A potential, non-significant protective
effect was observed between mercury and endometriosis in
both unadjusted and adjusted analyses. No association was
observed with lead. There was a borderline significant

association between increasing mercury levels and uterine
myomas in unadjusted analyses (tertile 3 versus 1: OR 1.86;
95% CI 1.02­3.39); however, this association was no longer
significant after adjusting for lead, cadmium, race/ethnicity,
smoking status at the time of diagnosis, use of birth control
pills prior to diagnosis and age (Table V). A possible protective
association was observed between lead and uterine myomas,
but was not significant; no association was observed between
cadmium and uterine myomas.
We examined blood metal levels in relation to the number of
years since diagnosis, as levels may have changed over time
(Table VI). Only blood mercury levels were found to have
changed significantly with years since diagnosis. When
women diagnosed 10 or more years prior to participation in
NHANES were excluded from analyses (25 women with endo-
metriosis and 30 women with uterine myomas), the results did
not change greatly overall; however, the association between
cadmium and endometriosis became stronger (tertile 2 versus
1: adjusted OR 1.96; 95% CI 0.51­7.61 and tertile 3 versus
1: adjusted OR 7.09; 95% CI 1.98­25.40) (data not shown).
Furthermore, the association between mercury and endome-
triosis continued to show a protective trend, although not
significant (tertile 2 versus 1: adjusted OR 0.71; 95% CI
0.31­1.63 and tertile 3 versus 1: adjusted OR 0.63; 95% CI
0.26­1.53) as did the association between lead and uterine
myomas (tertile 2 versus 1: adjusted OR 0.83; 95% CI 0.39­
1.77 and tertile 3 versus 1: adjusted OR 0.63; 95% CI 0.28­
1.42) (data not shown).
In additional sub-analyses, we limited cases to only those
that were diagnosed after their last reported pregnancy as preg-
nancies and breastfeeding have been shown to alter blood lead
levels (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2000; Dorea, 2004). This resulted
in 36 women with endometriosis and 79 women with uterine
myomas. Although the CIs became wider due to the smaller
sample size, there was little change in the effect estimates in
adjusted analyses.
We also examined the association between exposure and
disease among post-menopausal women given concerns of
the large percentage of women with disease that were excluded
due to hysterectomies. As the years since diagnosis was signifi-
cantly greater in this population than the main study population
(7.6 years since endometriosis diagnosis among premenopausal
women versus 13.6 years since endometriosis diagnosis among
postmenopausal women; P , 0.001) and would therefore
potentially influence heavy metal levels, we limited the analy-
sis to only women diagnosed within the past 10 years. Although
the analysis was limited by a small sample size (n ¼ 26 women
with endometriosis and 176 women without endometriosis),
the association between cadmium and endometriosis persisted,
though not significant (tertile 2 versus 1: adjusted OR 3.60;
95% CI 0.75­17.28 and tertile 3 versus 1: adjusted OR 5.61;
95% CI 0.98­32.06).

These results are consistent with animal and human studies that
have shown cadmium to be potentially estrogenic (Young
et al., 1977; Stoica et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2003; Brama
et al., 2007). Blood mercury levels showed a potential protec-
tive effect in relation to endometriosis in adjusted analyses,
consistent with the proposed anti-estrogenic effect of
mercury (Young et al., 1977; Martin et al., 2003). After adjust-
ing for potential confounders, no association was observed
between heavy metals and uterine myomas, except a potential
non-significant protective effect of lead.
The major sources of cadmium are through cigarette smoke
(both active and passive), shellfish and green leafy vegetables
with levels in food directly associated with contaminated
water and soil. Among women with endometriosis, 35% were
current smokers at the time of diagnosis, 6% former and 59%
never smokers. This differed from women without endometrio-
sis of whom 24% were current smokers at the time of the
survey, 15% former and 61% never smokers. Cadmium tends
to bioaccumulate in the tissues of the kidney and liver, but
has been found in uterine tissue (Nasiadek et al., 2005) and fol-
licular fluid (Zenzes et al., 1995) with levels significantly
higher in smokers than in non-smokers (Zenzes et al., 1995).
The half-life of cadmium in the kidney has been estimated to
be 6­38 years (ATSDR, 1999a). Overall, our study population
had low blood cadmium levels with 25% of women having
levels below the limit of detection (0.3 mg/l) and 90% of
women had levels less than or equal to 1 mg/l. This lack of
variability in exposure limited our ability to detect significant
associations; however, we still observed a statistically signifi-
cant association between the upper tertile of cadmium exposure
(0.5 mg/l) and endometriosis.
Although cigarette smoke is associated with anti-estrogenic
effects (Baron et al., 1990), cadmium, a contaminant in ciga-
rettes, has been associated with estrogenic effects. Studies
have shown that cadmium mimics estrogen activity in breast
cancer cells and can bind to and inhibit the ERa receptor
(Garcia-Morales et al., 1994; Young et al., 1977; Stoica
et al., 2000; Brama et al., 2007). In rats, cadmium has been
associated with earlier onset of vaginal opening, increased
uterine weights and enhanced mammary development
(Johnson et al., 2003), and decreased gonadotrophin binding
and altered steroidogenic enzyme activity in granulosa cells
(Priya et al., 2004; Nampoothiri and Gupta, 2006). In
women, cadmium induced menstrual cycle abnormalities
(Wang and Tian, 2004), difficulties conceiving (Wang and
Tian, 2004) as well as preterm deliveries (Laudanski et al.,
1991; Fagher et al., 1993).
Two previous studies investigating the association between
cadmium and endometriosis found no association (Heilier
et al., 2004, 2006). Both studies measured cadmium and lead
levels at the time of diagnosis of peritoneal endometriosis
(ENDO) and/or deep endometriotic nodules (DEN) and com-
pared them with controls. Blood cadmium levels were extre-
mely low in one study with a GM of 0.10 mg/l for all three
groups, substantially lower than our study population (Heilier
et al., 2004). The second study observed blood cadmium
levels (DEN ¼ 0.4 mg/l; ENDO ¼ 0.4 mg/l; both DEN and
ENDO ¼ 0.3 mg/l; controls ¼ 0.4 mg/l) similar to those we
observed in the NHANES analysis (Heilier et al., 2006). In
this study, they did find a borderline significant protective
effect in relation to blood lead levels when comparing DEN
alone (P , 0.05) and all types of endometriosis to controls
(P ¼ 0.046). Blood lead levels were slightly higher in this
study population (all cases ¼ 1.7 mg/dl; controls 2.2 mg/dl),
compared with the NHANES analysis. This protective effect
of lead is consistent with its hypothesized anti-estrogenic
effect, but in contrast to the NHANES analysis which found
no association, as well as a study of rhesus monkeys that
observed an increased risk of endometriosis associated with
lead exposure (Krugner-Higby et al., 2003). Only one study
has examined the association of cadmium and uterine
myomas, finding that cadmium tissue levels were significantly
lower in myoma tissue than in the normal myometrium (P ,
0.05) (Nasiadek et al., 2005). No studies examining the associ-
ation between either lead or mercury in relation to uterine
myomas were found in the literature.
This analysis has several limitations. As endometriosis and
uterine myomas were self-reported, and not confirmed
through medical records, it is likely there may be some mis-
classification of outcomes. We do not know if reported cases
were confirmed surgically; and therefore, some reported
cases may not truly be cases; however, within the Nurses'
Health Study, investigators reviewed medical records of
women self-reporting an endometriosis diagnosis and were
able to confirm 88.6% of all self-reported cases (Missmer
et al., 2004). Conversely, some women may have had undiag-
nosed endometriosis or uterine myomas as they were asympto-
matic or had not sought medical attention. The overall
prevalence of endometriosis in our sample of eligible women
(5.5%) was lower than the prevalence expected among
women of reproductive age due to our exclusion criteria;
however, the overall prevalence of endometriosis in
NHANES from 1999 to 2002 was 9.4%, similar to that
observed in other studies (Wheeler, 1989). If the misclassifi-
cation of disease status is non-differential by exposure status,
we would expect our results to be biased toward the null;
however, if the misclassification is differential, the direction
of bias could be in either direction.
Exposure misclassification is also a concern as exposure was
measured after the diagnosis of disease, in some cases many
years later. All three metals bioaccumulate in the body,
which may result in an increase in blood metal levels since
the time of diagnosis. However, in some instances, metal
levels may decrease as has been shown with lead due to the
mobilization of lead from bone during pregnancy and breast-
feeding resulting in potentially lower levels in women who
had intervening pregnancies (Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2000;
Akesson et al., 2002; Garrido et al., 2003; Dorea, 2004). If
heavy metal levels changed over time and are not representa-
tive of exposure prior to disease, it may bias the results.
Taking this into consideration, we examined heavy metal
levels by years since diagnosis, and did not see major
changes in metal levels. We carried out sub-analyses excluding
those women diagnosed 10 or more years prior to NHANES in
one analysis and women diagnosed prior to their last pregnancy
Heavy metals, endometriosis and uterine myomas
685
in a second analysis and did not observe substantial changes in
the risk estimates.
We excluded women who were peri- or post-menopausal,
pregnant or breastfeeding due to concerns that their heavy
metal levels would not be representative of levels at the time
of diagnosis based on prior research (Berkowitz et al., 1999;
Hertz-Picciotto et al., 2000; Akesson et al., 2002; Garrido
et al., 2003; Dorea, 2004). This resulted in women who
reported hysterectomies automatically being excluded from
analyses. Overall, women in NHANES who reported a diagno-
sis of endometriosis or uterine myomas were approximately
nine times more likely to report having a hysterectomy. By
excluding these women, we limited our sample size and may
have underestimated the true OR if there is an association
between metals and disease, especially if these women rep-
resent more severe cases that would be more readily diagnosed.
In further analyses, we did observe a positive, but non-
significant association between cadmium and endometriosis
among post-menopausal women when limiting analysis to
women diagnosed in the past 10 years. No information was
available regarding the staging of endometriosis, so we were
unable to explore the effect disease severity may have on the
association between exposure and disease.
Finally, given the limited research in this area, it is not clear
what the critical window of exposure might be in relation to
endometriosis or uterine myomas. In utero or early childhood
exposures may alter the development of the HPO axis resulting
in disease later in life; current exposures may target the HPO
axis, resulting in altered gonadotrophin secretion; or alterna-
tively current exposures may interfere with receptor binding
or number leading to, or exacerbating, disease. The differences
observed in the few studies examining the association between
heavy metals and gynecological disorders may be related to the
different timing of exposure assessment. These areas need
further exploration.
The NHANES data provided a nationally representative
sample in which to explore this research question making the
study results generalizable to the USA. Consistent with other
literature, White, non-Hispanic women were significantly
more likely to have a diagnosis of endometriosis than other
women; and Black, non-Hispanic women were significantly
more likely to have a diagnosis of uterine myomas compared
with other women (Marshall et al., 1997; Baird et al., 2003;
Missmer and Cramer, 2003). In addition, both current and
former smoking status at diagnosis showed a non-significant,
protective effect for endometriosis and uterine myomas after
adjusting for lead, cadmium, mercury, race/ethnicity, age
and use of birth control pills prior to diagnosis, as has been
reported elsewhere (Matorras et al., 1995; Baird et al., 2003;
Louis et al., 2005; Tsukino et al., 2005).
These results must be interpreted with caution given the
cross-sectional nature of this study with disease onset and diag-
nosis occurring prior to the measurement of heavy metals.
Although the study lacks temporality of association, we have
shown that lead and cadmium were not significantly different
by time since diagnosis, especially among those with diagnosis
less than 10 years prior to participation in NHANES. Despite
the limitations of the NHANES data to examine this study
question, we did observe a significant association between
increasing levels of cadmium and endometriosis. This associ-
ation deserves further investigation in a study designed to
answer this question specifically.
