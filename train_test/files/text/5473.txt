Ethnic differences often explain substantial patterns of social
inequality (e.g. Heath and Cheung, 2007; Heath et al., 2008;
Platt, 2005, 2007; Tomlinson, 1991). Ethnicity is far fuzzier a
concept than either occupation or educational attainment.
Most social surveys collect some level of information on eth-
nicity. In this article, we highlight a series of concerns for soci-
ologists using ethnicity measures in existing social surveys.
An aim of this article is to provide information for sec-
ondary data analysts who are not experts in the field of eth-
nicity. Experts are well aware of the opportunities provided
by the measures that are available in existing social surveys,
as well as their limitations and complexities, but these issues
are sometimes not appreciated by social survey analysts
whose interests might lie outside of ethnicity research. Ethnic
structures differ radically across nation states, therefore, in
order to ensure that this article provides clear prescriptions,
we confine most of our discussion to the United Kingdom
(although the issues which we cover are often equally rele-
vant to data from other nations).
How is ethnicity measured?
Ethnicity is frequently taken to represent a self-claimed or
subjective identity linked to a perception of shared ancestry
as a result of some combination of nationality, history, cul-
tural origins and possibly religion (Bulmer, 1996; Platt,
2011, 2007). There is an extensive literature which discusses
the meaning and use of the term ethnicity and how this con-
cept differs and overlaps with the neighbouring concepts of
race and national identity (for example, see Banton, 1998,
2014; Burton et al., 2008; Cornell and Hartmann, 2006;
Mason, 1995; Ratcliffe, 1994; Smith, 1991). The definition
of what constitutes an ethnic group or ethnicity is the subject
of much detailed theoretical discussion (see, for example,
Anthias and Yuval-Davis, 2005; Banton, 1998; Bulmer,
1996; Coleman and Salt, 1996; Murji and Solomos, 2005;
Solomos and Back, 1996; Solomos and Collins, 2010). The
focus of this article is on using those ethnicity measures
which are widely available in large-scale multi-purpose
social surveys.
Ethnicity and ethnic group measures in
social survey research

Abstract
This article is a review of issues associated with measuring ethnicity and using ethnicity measures in social science research.
The review is oriented towards researchers who undertake secondary analyses of large-scale multipurpose social science
datasets. The article begins with an outline of two main approaches used in social surveys to measure ethnicity, the `mutually
exclusive category' approach and the `multiple characteristics' approach. We also describe approaches to the use of ethnicity
measures in cross-national comparative research. We emphasise the value of sensitivity analyses. We also encourage
researchers to carefully consider the possible relationships between ethnicity and other important variables in order to
avoid spurious interpretations of the effects of ethnicity.

2 Methodological Innovations
In comparison with the measurement of occupations in
social surveys, there is no standard, widely accepted, proto-
col for the collection of ethnicity or ethnic group data. In the
United Kingdom, and many other countries, National
Statistical Institutes (NSI) have proposed standardised meas-
ures to classify individuals into ethnic groups. This has often
been driven by legal requirements associated with evaluating
anti-discrimination policies, the need to monitor change in
the social and economic circumstances of ethnic minorities
and the need to have accurate information about the size and
nature of the ethnic minority population (Bulmer, 1985). The
standardised measures advocated by NSIs are frequently
included within social surveys, but they are also common for
alternative measures that are connected to the concept to be
included (or constructed post-hoc). Indeed, researchers are
sometimes interested in specific aspects of ethnicity that are
not well captured by NSI standards, and/or the design of a
particular survey may push researchers away from using NSI
standards for pragmatic reasons, such as very low coverage
of some relevant minority groups.
Nandi and Platt (2012) describe two main perspectives in
the measurement of ethnicity.1 First, social surveys often
place individuals into mutually exclusive ethnic group cate-
gories. These are sometimes based upon a taxonomy that can
be defined through objective characteristics (e.g. country of
birth or parental country of birth). Alternatively, they may
involve asking respondents (or even interviewers or proxy
respondents) to allocate an appropriate category on substan-
tially subjective grounds. In either case, to many analysts,
the specification of categorical ethnic group measures is a
necessity for studying ethnic inequalities using social survey
data (Platt, 2011: 74). Second, social survey data collections
may include multiple questions on different aspects of an
individual's ethnic identity and use an analytical approach
that draws upon data from more than one measure (see
Burton et al., 2008).As a heuristic device, we will refer to the
first perspective as the `mutually exclusive category'
approach and the second perspective as the `multiple charac-
teristics' approach.
The mutually exclusive category approach
In this approach, the aim is to place individuals into the most
appropriate ethnic group category based on their characteris-
tics (Burton et al., 2008). These characteristics may include
skin colour or nationality (for example, Burton et al., 2008,
2010; Platt, 2011). In the United Kingdom (as in the United
States), the most commonly used measures of ethnic group
involve presenting individuals with a list of ethnic group cat-
egories which make reference to national origins and to skin
colour and asking them to indicate which category they feel
is most appropriate for them.2
In the United Kingdom, the Office for National Statistics
(ONS) recommends ethnic group measures for use in social
surveys (see Table 1 for the most recent measure, based on
the 2011 census). These recommendations are based on the
measures designed for the United Kingdom decennial cen-
suses, which themselves have been constructed on the basis
of wide consultations with a range of stakeholders and
National Institutes. The measures are different in the four
UK territories, reflecting the nature of the minority ethnic
population, different legal requirements and variations in the
prominent terminology used (ONS, 2013). Clear guidelines
are also produced for researchers who are analysing ethnicity
across the whole of the United Kingdom on recommended
ways to combine the different ethnic groups into higher level
ethnicity categories suitable for the UK-level analysis (see
ONS, 2013).
The ONS recommended standard includes provision for
various `mixed' categories, and it also allows individuals to
classify themselves as belonging to `other' unspecified eth-
nic groups and to write in their chosen description (see
Table 1). The use of this `write-in' section has been shown
to improve perceptions of the acceptability of this question
to respondents and to improve response rates (ONS, 2013).
In line with the aims of the `mutually exclusive category'
approach, data collectors may seek to re-allocate those indi-
viduals who have written-in their ethnic identity to one of
the existing ethnic group categories based on objective
guidelines (see ONS, 2013).
The ONS standardised measures have been adopted in a
number of large-scale social surveys (for a review, see
Afkhami, 2012). The use of these existing standardised
measures can facilitate the comparability of analyses across
studies. For many social science investigations using large-
scale social survey data, the use of these measures within a
multivariate analysis, along with other key variables, will
fulfil the requirement of providing increased control for the
ethnic group composition of the United Kingdom. The ONS
standard measures represent an extensively considered and
transparent approach (e.g. ONS, 2013), and although there
may sometimes be special circumstances that provide a com-
pelling reason for a specific study to depart from the ONS
standard categories, for theoretical or operational reasons,
such departures should generally be discouraged without
good reason.
A common complication in the United Kingdom survey
research arises when analyses are conducted using non-
standard ethnic group categories. This sometimes happens
because a standard format ethnicity measure is not available
in the survey data. In the case of analysis using large-scale
surveys, it more commonly arises because the researcher has
decided to re-code the measure of ethnicity into a non-stand-
ard format. Often this decision is made because of small
sample sizes in the different ethnic group categories.
Generally speaking, we would argue that researchers should
resist the impulse to generate derived and variant measures
when standardised taxonomies are available (see Lambert
et al., 2009). If standardised measures are not available in the
social survey used, and/or there are operational reasons that
Connelly et al. 3
preclude the use of standard categories (e.g. an analytical
focus on an ethnic division that is not captured by the stand-
ard measure), researchers should provide clear justification
for, and documentation and metadata about, how the meas-
ures were derived, in order that other researchers can test the
measures and adequately replicate results.3
An additional complexity arises when researchers seek
to use ethnic group measures from surveys collected at dif-
ferent periods in time. In the case of comparisons across
different time points (e.g. using repeated cross-sectional
surveys), finding equivalent measures might be difficult. In
the United Kingdom, the standard measures used in large-
scale social surveys are usually based on those of the UK
Census, and these are revised decennially4 (for a discussion
of the comparability of the ethnicity measures used in the
2001 and 2011 UK Censuses see ONS, 2012). Even if simi-
lar measures are collected over time, they may have only
`nominal equivalence' and lack `functional equivalence',
because the relative meaning of being in a certain category
may not be the same from one time point to another (Van
Deth, 2003). There are some published recommendations
of good practice for using standard ethnicity categories for
longitudinal comparisons (see Afkhami, 2012; Platt et al.,
2005; Simpson and Akinwale, 2007), and it is often the case
that previous comparative studies provide the most appro-
priate benchmarks for further endeavours. In the special
case when longitudinal data allow for records to be linked
for the same people at different time points, it is sometimes
possible to derive consistent ethnicity measures by focus-
sing upon the measures used at a particular agreed time
point (see Platt, 2005).
As well as challenges of temporal consistency, survey
data analysis projects often experience difficulties because
the survey data itself have coverage of ethnic groups that is

in some way sub-optimal. Large-scale nationally representa-
tive social surveys may have only a small numbers of cases
from certain ethnic minority groups. This sparsity can inhibit
some statistical analyses. A commonly used strategy to
respond to data sparsity when analysing ethnic group pat-
terns is to merge together smaller ethnic groups into com-
bined categories or to drop the groups from the analysis
altogether. These steps are usually taken for pragmatic rather
than theoretical reasons. This approach may be plausible in
some situations, but it is obvious that there are also risks that
more complex empirical patterns might be overlooked.
Some modern social surveys (e.g. the UK Millennium
Cohort Study and the UK Household Longitudinal Study)
have complex sampling designs, such as `boost' samples that
are designed to increase coverage of selected minority cate-
gories. This is not a simple solution to the problem of sparsity
as it adds complexity to the survey sample which should be
appropriately taken into account in analyses (for an accessible
introduction see Treiman, 2009: 195­224). Unfortunately, it
is common for survey researchers to generate summary statis-
tics from data with complex sampling designs that use meth-
ods which do not take account of the complex survey design.
This practice has the potential to introduce bias and/or ineffi-
ciency into statistical results (i.e. the inaccurate estimation of
statistical parameters and/or inaccurate conclusions about
their generalisability).
To bypass such complications, researchers interested in
studying ethnicity often deliberately focus on datasets that
maximisecoverageofethnicminoritygroups.Nevertheless,
while there are many possible strategies for dealing with
survey data that have sparse coverage of minority groups
and/or that have a complex sampling design, it is always
desirable to clearly communicate the approach taken (such
as merging categories), and when possible to explore dif-
ferent analytical strategies through theoretically grounded
sensitivity analysis (such as generating results with and
without sampling design controls or different merged
categories).
The multiple characteristics approach
Placing survey respondents in a single, mutually exclusive
category may overlook some important dimensions of eth-
nicity. In many accounts, ethnicity is a multidimensional
concept which includes a number of elements (e.g. ancestry,
national identity, religion and country of birth) (see Aspinall,
2011), and there is some evidence that the importance of dif-
ferent dimensions of ethnicity may vary between people. For
example, when providing descriptions of their ethnicity in
free-text responses, `Black' groups in the 1991 and 2001 UK
Censuses were found to emphasise their national identity
(i.e. being British) as a central element of their ethnic iden-
tity (ONS, 2006). South Asian groups, however, have been
found to emphasise their religion as a central element of their
ethnic identity (Modood et al., 1994).
Attention to multiple dimensions of ethnicity can be
important, for instance, when investigations require more
insight into how individuals view their own ethnic identity,
what characteristics make up this identity, or how important
this identity is to the individual (Burton et al., 2008). For
example, researchers might be interested in how an ethnic
identity is formed and how this changes over the life course
(French et al., 2006; Phinney, 1989, 1990; Phinney and
Alipuria, 1990; Torres, 2003). Similarly, investigating how
ethnicity relates to well-being (Mossakowski, 2003; Phinney
et al., 2001) or how self-esteem is influenced by ethnicity
(Bracey et al., 2004; Umaña-Taylor, 2004; Umaña-Taylor
and Shin, 2007) will probably require measures which cap-
ture more nuanced aspects of ethnicity.
The use of multiple measures within a social survey,
which examine different aspects of the concept of ethnicity,
offers an effective approach to the measurement of ethnicity
in more detail, since multiple responses across differing
characteristics allow respondents to provide more nuanced
information about their particular circumstances (Burton
et al., 2010). The measures developed for Understanding
Society (the United Kingdom Household Longitudinal
Study5) are a prime example of this approach (see Table 2 for
selected examples of the ethnicity questions used in the sur-
vey). In addition to measuring ethnicity using standardised
ethnic group measures, described above, a suite of measures
were also developed to provide information on various
aspects of ethnicity (e.g. country of birth, language, national-
ity, religion), and also the extent to which the respondents
felt these characteristics were important to their identity.
Nandi and Platt (2012) developed these questions to offer a
comprehensive set of measures suitable for the specialist and
detailed study of ethnicity in the United Kingdom. The use
of multiple measures has also been advocated as a solution
to comparability in cross-national survey research (see
Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and Warner, 2010).
In many analyses, a standardised categorical ethnicity
measure, for example, the ONS measure described above
will be sufficient when included in a multivariate analysis
with other key variables because this will provide suitable
additional statistical control to help to represent the demo-
graphic structure of the United Kingdom. Indeed, despite
their recognition of the relevance of multiple subjective
identities, Burton et al. (2008) point out that just as in most
situations, it is possible to study social class inequalities
without the need to measure class consciousness, therefore,
ethnic group inequalities can be studied using social survey
data without capturing an individual's conscious ethnic
identity.
In other analyses, using a standardised categorical ethnic-
ity measure may be less suitable. There are circumstances
where the analytical focus on ethnic inequalities involves
important divisions that are not well captured by the standard
ethnicity variables. Well-documented examples in the United
Kingdom include the importance of immigrant `generation'
Connelly et al. 5
to analyses of social inequality (e.g. Heath and Cheung,
2007) or the specific interest in `East African Asians' in the
United Kingdom in the late 20th century (e.g. Modood et al.,
1997). More generally, authors such as Yancey et al. (1976)
and, more recently, Aspinall (2012) have suggested that eth-
nicity is a changeable, complex and multidimensional con-
cept which cannot be measured by allocating individuals to a
single mutually exclusive category.
Relationships with other variables
Alongside definitional issues, an important consideration in
most analyses of ethnicity is the way in which ethnic catego-
ries are linked to other key differences between people. In
multivariate analyses, a common statistical objective is to
isolate the relative influence of background factors in order
to identify the distinctive empirical associates with a variable
of interest, net of other factors. In the case of measures of
ethnicity, there are strong correlations between ethnic cate-
gories and other socio-demographic differences, so particu-
lar care is needed in order to avoid drawing spurious
conclusions about ethnic differences. The key point is that a
misleading understanding of the influence of ethnicity might
emerge if measures are not considered in the context of other
correlations (see, for example, Heath and Martin, 2013).
Survey data analysts should place a suitable amount of
thought, into which key variables and demographic meas-
ures, they include within models that contain measures of
ethnicity and should develop their multivariate analyses
from theoretically guided exploratory data analyses.
One important issue to consider is that in the United
Kingdom, there are strong cohort demographic patterns that
are linked to ethnic minority groups due to concentrated
waves of immigration (Fryer, 1984; Hansen, 2000; Panayi,
1999; Spencer, 1997). Substantial age and regional settlement
differences arise between ethnic groups that reflect their
immigrant-cohort background (including some regional set-
tlement patterns that have led in time to disproportionate resi-
dence of some minority groups in areas of high deprivation).
Some social outcomes and many health outcomes vary
substantially according to age. Because certain ethnic groups
have younger age structures than others, there is a pressing
need to control for these differences in age when analysing
data (for details on the age profiles of ethnic groups in the
United Kingdom, see Haskey, 1996; Scott et al., 2001). In
statistical modelling approaches, additional controls for the
main effects of age may often be adequate. It is also plausible
that an ageing process itself may vary by ethnic group, these
patterns could ideally be explored by testing for statistical
interactions between measures of age and ethnicity.
For many ethnic minorities in the United Kingdom, data
that can be measured in relation to immigration may also be
very important to build into an analysis. For example, whether
or not individuals are born in the country of residence, how
long their family has lived in the country, their proficiency in
the host country language and whether their educational par-
ticipation was in the host or origin country, may be relevant to
some analyses. These patterns may affect important outcomes
such as chances and choices in the labour market.
In the social sciences, there is an analytical literature on
the differences between the experiences and outcomes of
immigrants, and those born in the host society (e.g. Algan
et al., 2010; Levels et al., 2008; Raftery et al., 1990; Schnepf,
2007). One common approach is to characterise survey
respondents into different `immigrant generations'. Typically

the `first generation' of immigrants are those born abroad
and the `second generation'are those born in the host society
whose parents were born abroad. Other categories are occa-
sionally identified such as the `third' and `subsequent gener-
ations'. In some cases, researchers also define the `1.5
generation', which are those who were born abroad but
moved to the host society as young children and had the bulk
of their schooling in the host country (e.g. Allensworth,
1997; Harklau et al., 1999; Quirke et al., 2010). Many studies
of ethnic inequalities in the United Kingdom have not taken
account of characteristics linked to immigration or differ-
ences between immigrant `generations'. However, large-
scale social surveys do often include measures related to
immigration, and some writers argue that these should be
increasingly central to research on ethnicity (Platt, 2005).
In the United Kingdom and in many other nations, some
ethnic minority groups exhibit sustained differences in pat-
terns of family formation and living arrangements in com-
parison with other groups. Most well-known in the United
Kingdom are patterns of larger household size and younger
average ages at marriage and family formation, among South
Asian ethnic minority groups (e.g. Coleman and Salt, 1996).
Differences in family patterns are often presumed to reflect
the influence of cultural heritage, but there are also complex-
ities to demographic differences between ethnic groups
which defy a characterisation based on cultural heritage
alone (e.g. Shaw, 2014). Family circumstances do have a
substantial influence on many other social outcomes within
the United Kingdom, including employment arrangements,
socio-economic circumstances and patterns of lifestyle and
social support. Accordingly, the association between ethnic-
ity and average variations in family circumstances is another
issue to consider. It might often be unsatisfactory to analyse
differences by ethnic group without considering other varia-
tions in average family circumstances.
There are pronounced ethnic differences in settlement
patterns within countries such as the United Kingdom
(Finney and Simpson, 2009; Ratcliffe, 1997). Compared
with other areas of the United Kingdom, some urban areas in
London, the North West of England and the English Midlands
have much higher ethnic minority populations. Ethnic minor-
ity groups are often clustered in areas of high deprivation,
and this may be particularly relevant to studies of social net-
works and neighbourhood effects (see, for example, Bécares
et al., 2009, 2011; Laurence, 2014). Equally, Finney and
Simpson (2009) argue that the extent and consequences of
regional segregation are sometimes exaggerated.
From a survey data analytical perspective, there is a per-
suasive argument for considering geographical issues when
studying patterns of ethnic difference. Conventionally,
higher level regional measures can be entered into analyses
to attempt to separate geographic from ethnicity effects. In
some applications, different regional settlement patterns by
ethnic groups in the United Kingdom are thought to occur
because of differential industrial and employment sector
opportunities (see Iganski and Payne, 1999). In this scenario,
an appropriate response to the recognition of regional settle-
ment differences may be to include measures of industrial
sector or employment circumstances in analyses rather than
crude measures of geography.
All of these additionally relevant factors have an influ-
ence on the interpretation of patterns of difference linked to
measures of ethnicity. Clearly, it is important for the
researcher to consider whether and how the relationship
between ethnicity and other measures is best represented
within the analysis. It may be a priority to `control for' sepa-
rable differences, for example, by using a multivariate statis-
tical technique that isolates the distinctive effect of one
variable (e.g. a measure of ethnicity) from any patterns that
might arise due to correlations with another variable (e.g.
age). Regression models are routinely used for this purpose
in social statistics, although both simpler and more compli-
cated, alternative statistical methods can also be used. The
important point to appreciate, however, is that the connec-
tions between ethnicity and other social differences (as
described above) are such that, in the United Kingdom at
least, it will ordinarily be the case that the pattern of effects
linked to ethnicity will not be the same with or without `con-
trols' of this nature.
It is also important to recognise that `controlling for' other
factors is not the only plausible approach to summarising
social patterns related to ethnicity. First, in some scenarios, it
may be theoretically irrelevant that another measureable fac-
tor is in some way driving some or all of a measured ethnic
difference. In this situation, the bivariate pattern of difference
between ethnic group categories may be all that a researcher
is interested in, and bivariate analytical techniques will be
appropriate tools of analysis. Second, there is increasing rec-
ognition and interest in the social sciences given to communi-
cating the distinctive experiences of individuals that arise due
to their unique constellation of circumstances according to a
number of different measurable factors. An extensive theo-
retical literature on `intersectionality' stresses, in particular,
that ethnic inequalities often work in complex combination
with other social differences (e.g. Anthias, 2001). From this
perspective, the best way to summarise ethnic inequalities is
often to regard the situations defined by important combina-
tions of circumstances (such as ethnicity, social class, gender
and age) as being of distinctive importance. For applied
researchers, an `intersectional' approach can potentially be
followed by summarising statistical patterns for different
distinctive social groups. In a statistical modelling approach,
the estimation of interaction terms between measures of eth-
nicity and other relevant measures of circumstances also has
considerable potential to communicate the average influences
associated with `intersectional' combinations.
In summary, when researchers are seeking to describe the
relationship between ethnicity and a key outcome of interest
(e.g. health or educational outcomes), the relatively strong
empirical relationship between measures of ethnicity and
Connelly et al. 7
other measureable aspects of individuals' circumstances, can
be responded to through at least three analytical approaches.
The relationship might be deliberately ignored on theoretical
grounds, leading to reports of bivariate summary patterns
between ethnicity measures and the outcome of interest.
Alternatively, efforts might concentrate upon `controlling
for' other measurable differences, such as by using regres-
sion models or other methods to isolate the effect of ethnicity
net of other correlated factors (such as age, region or family
circumstances). Last, analysts might, on the contrary, try to
prioritise the description of the intersection between ethnic-
ity and other factors, such as by communicating interaction
effects or using other summarising devices that focus on par-
ticular combinations of circumstances. Researchers might
make a choice, ideally with theoretical justification, over
which approach to follow. We would argue that the most
compelling approach in a scientific sense should be to under-
take and understand analytical patterns according to all three
of these frameworks. This should be expected to give the
researcher the most insight into the ethnic patterns that they
are exploring and should best equip them to make an appro-

Cross national comparisons
An emerging feature of contemporary social sciences is the
interest in conducting cross-nationally comparative analyses
with survey data (see Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and Harkness,
2005; Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and Wolf, 2003). In principle, the
analysis of ethnicity is an intrinsically international theme,
given its relationship with international migration. One dif-
ficulty arises because different countries have different histo-
ries of immigration, meaning that it is unlikely that
comparative studies of ethnicity will be dealing with compa-
rable minority groups in different countries.Astrategy some-
times followed is to identify and compare minorities from
the same background in different countries (e.g. Crul and
Vermeulen, 2003; Model, 2005). This strategy may still be
unsatisfactory because it is likely that there are differences
between migrants from the same nation who settled in differ-
ent countries. An alternative comparative strategy is simply
to study different ethnic minority groups in different coun-
tries and make only carefully qualified comparisons (e.g.
Heath and Cheung, 2007).
Some reviews have suggested ways for specific measure-
ment instruments to be applied consistently to facilitate
cross-national comparisons (e.g. Aspinall, 2007; Hoffmeyer-
Zlotnik, 2003; Lambert, 2005). These reviews identify a sec-
ond major challenge for cross-national comparative research
on ethnicity, namely that different nations have strong tradi-
tions of difference in the measures related to ethnicity that
they collect in surveys. In many countries, the measurement
of ethnicity is highly politicised, and an approach used in one
nation might never be considered acceptable in another. To a
limited extent, recent social survey instruments are begin-
ning to negotiate this problem, usually by collecting data on
multiple measures that could be subsequently adapted to the
researcher's needs. For example, Hoffmeyer-Zlotnik and
Warner (2010) encourage survey designers to collect meas-
ures of characteristics such as citizenship, country of birth,
parents' country of birth and language, regardless of national
traditions in measuring ethnicity.
Conclusion
Most nationally representative large-scale social surveys col-
lect information on ethnicity. We have provided an account
of how ethnicity is measured in social surveys and reflected
on the relationship between ethnicity and other social ine-
qualities. Researchers undertaking survey data analyses must
typically deal with a number of options and challenges that
relate to using ethnicity measures as key variables in their
research.
We argue that when studying ethnicity from the `mutually
exclusive category' approach, researchers should always use
existing measures that have agreed upon and well-docu-
mented standards, and which will facilitate comparability
and replication. We also advise researchers not to develop
their own ethnicity measures without strong justification or
use existing measures in an un-prescribed or ad hoc manner.
We have highlighted that general social surveys often con-
tain categorical measures of ethnicity based on the mutually
exclusive category approach. For many sociological research
questions, these measures will be adequate, especially when
all that is required is improved control for underlying pat-
terns in the data that are linked to ethnicity.
We have highlighted the potential impact of the inter-rela-
tionships between ethnic groups and other variables. When
exploring statistical patterns linked to ethnicity variables, we
advise researchers to be cognisant of the potential associa-
tions between ethnicity and a number of other variables (for
instance age, family situation, regional location and socio-
economic situation). This may help to better elucidate impor-
tant patterns in social outcomes. If unrecognised, such
undetected associations can lead to spurious interpretations
of ethnicity effects. Contemporary data analysis software
packages make it relatively straightforward to estimate sta-
tistical models that include multivariate controls for other
potentially related factors, and which can test interaction
effects between ethnicity and other variables. Controls and
interactions can often have an important effect on the conclu-
sions drawn from research, and we would advise any
researcher working on ethnic inequalities to consider a wide
range of controls and interactions when developing their ana-
lytical findings. As we have also said with regard to using
other social science variables, many of the different options
available when analysing measures of ethnicity can usefully
be explored by conducting additional sensitivity analysis,
something that is made relatively easy by contemporary

software capabilities. For instance, it is sensible to run a
series of analyses with and without different alternative ver-
sions of measures of ethnicity, and with and without different
additional controls and interaction terms.

3. Between 2008 and 2013, the `GEMDE' service (http://www.
dames.org.uk/gemde) provided an online archive of metadata
about ethnicity classifications which was designed specifically
to support this purpose ­ for instance, allowing a researcher to
deposit the software code that they used to construct a variant
ethnicity measure on a specific survey. We contend that there
is great value in this type of enterprise, and we hope that some-
time in the future this service is resumed.
4. The 1991 Census was the first to include an ethnic group
measure.
