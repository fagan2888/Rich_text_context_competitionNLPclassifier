Reflective practices are designed to transform professional
practice and experience to bring the best in educational
stakeholders. Experiencing this kind of transformation does
not happen in isolation, but requires the active involvement
of skilled educators who wish to grow professionally.
Reflective practice, by its very nature, begins with a degree
of self-reflection, cultivating a higher level of self-awareness
or consciousness (York-Barr, Sommers, Ghere, & Montie,
2006). Only when reflective practices have been applied to
the self can they be extended to others (Osterman &
Kottkamp, 2006). Reflective practice is gaining momentum
and becoming more visible in social studies contexts.
Reflective practice is critical for "significant and sus-
tained school improvement. Experience by itself is not
enough. Reflection on experience is the pathway to improve-
ment" (York-Barr et al., 2006, p. xvii). Educators should
familiarize themselves with reflective practice to better
understand how it can drive curriculum processes. Reflective
practice is one of the most effective ways teachers can help
sustain motivation and clear decision making.
In this article, current reflective practices in the social
studies are examined in light of how these strategies can add
value and meaning to social studies curriculums. Many of
these reflective practices were introduced within teacher
education programs' social studies methods courses, to
expose pre-service teachers to innovative teaching practices
that could be used in the classroom. While there is no uni-
versal definition of reflective practice, there are some per-
spectives that researchers have offered to help clarify how
one can engage in reflective practice. These perspectives
include
·
· Evaluate actions, decisions, or products by focusing
on the process of achieving stated goals.
·
· Use creative thinking and imagining to critically pon-
der current practices.
·
· Consider actions with the goal of improving practice.
·
· Question and develop a commitment to regular dis-
covery and analysis of data regarding actions.
·
· Use action-based processes that promote reaction,
forethought, and insight.
·
· Make rational choices and assume responsibility for
educational practices and policies.
·
· Explore underlying beliefs, biases, and knowledge in
a deliberate cognitive analysis of thoughts and ideas.

Moving Toward a Humanistic Social
Studies and History Curricula: A Review
of Recent Reflective Practices
Christopher Berg1 and Melanie Shaw2
Abstract
Current reflective practices in the social studies are examined in light of how these strategies can add value and meaning
to social studies curriculums. Many of these reflective practices were introduced within teacher education programs'
social studies methods courses, to expose pre-service teachers to innovative teaching practices that could be used in the
classroom. An ineffective textbook-centered curriculum has dominated education in the United States for over a century.
The researchers in this article argue for a new, reflective approach to teaching history and social studies curricula. New
pedagogical models are needed to revive an ailing social studies program in the public school system. This article includes a
selective examination of some traditional and non-traditional methods for promoting student learning and growth through
reflective practices. Those considered in this article include dialogue journals, textbooks, culturally responsive texts (CRT),
the Persona Doll Project, mask-making, primary source documents, and co-teaching. Each reflective practice strategy has its
merits and could be easily implemented to improve pedagogical practice.

A textbook-centered curriculum has dominated education
in the United States for over a century with negligible results
in student achievement gains (Christou, 2009; Ravitch,
2011). New pedagogical models, such as those discussed in
this article, are needed and reflective practitioners have
answered the call. They are conceiving new ways to revive
an ailing social studies program in the public school system
by going to the source--pre-service teaching education pro-
grams. The researchers selectively examine some traditional
and non-traditional methods for promoting student learning
and growth through reflective practices.
The Textbook Question and Explicit
Reasoning Text (ERT)
The textbook has dominated the history curriculum for more
than a century and the results, as measured through demon-
strable historical thinking skills in students, have been less
than satisfying (Lindaman & Ward, 2004; Pearcy, 2011;
Ward, 2007). Wineburg (2001) noted that most college his-
tory students believed the textbook to be authoritative and
trustworthy. History professors, however, viewed the text-
book with skepticism, noting it was the least trustworthy his-
torical document available. In spite of this revelation,
textbooks continue to dominate the history curriculum in
secondary and higher education.
Again, reliance on textbooks as the centerpiece of the cur-
riculum promotes a myopic and skewed understanding of
social studies, history, other cultures, and the world.
Textbooks tend to be nationalistic in their orientation with
some scholars suggesting they be treated as propaganda,
while also being filled with outdated "facts," omissions, and
errors (Schneider, 2011; Ward, 2007; Wineburg, 2001;
Wineburg, Martin, & Monte-Sano, 2011). VanSledright
(2010) argued that textbooks simply sugarcoat or ignore the
less appealing aspects of history in favor of more popular
narratives. This post-modernist assumption has become pop-
ularized in recent years, but insisting on covering more mate-
rial in an already dense textbook is not the answer either
(Calder, 2006). Schneider (2011) analyzed a series of text-
books from the 1960s and today and found, when analyzing
the Cuban Missile Crisis, that much of the same content
remained unchanged, though new evidence has come to light
and historiography has changed over the course of half a cen-
tury. To his amazement, Schneider noted, the textbooks sam-
pled were grossly inaccurate and promoted myth and
legend more than anything. "Sometimes, in fact," Schneider
lamented, "they're [textbooks] just plain wrong" (p. 126).
A point that is new in reflective practice literature is that
textbooks are not only dangerous to students and their
achievement, growth, and development but also to the pro-
fessional health of teachers. For Stacy (2013), the textbook is
nothing more than a "scripted curriculum" that impedes the
intellectual and professional development of teachers (p. 41).
Rather than substituting meaningful instruction with text-
book readings and written assignments culled from the text-
book, Stacy suggests facilitating dynamic classroom
activities, such as those discussed in this article, that chal-
lenge students, pique their interests, and grab their attention.
Textbooks do not engage students; why teachers, admin-
istrators, school boards, and teacher education programs
continue to insist on their use is baffling. In a recent compre-
hensive survey study of 328 teachers in the state of California,
researchers found that 96.6% of respondents used textbooks
regularly in instruction while 97.2% of respondents used lec-
tures predominantly to communicate to their students
(Campbell, Heath, Ingrao, & Middleton, 2012, p. 121). The
authors expressed concern over "the importance of using
other sources besides textbooks, the standardization of infor-
mation resulting in the limited opportunity for students to
immerse themselves in inquiry projects generated from their
curiosity about time and/or a place," and "the absence of cur-
ricular materials to help students engage with their world and
build a greater understanding of our global community"
(p. 123).
The title of Loewen's (2009) most recent book, Teaching
What Really Happened: How to Avoid the Tyranny of
Textbooks and Get Students Excited About Doing History, is
devoted to exposing the deleterious effects of the textbook
and persuasively argued for its removal from the curriculum.
In recent years, Loewen has been joined by Ravitch (2011) in
excoriating textbooks as the "de facto curriculum" across the
United States (p. 237). How can textbooks form the founda-
tion, the backbone, of the high school history curriculum,
when they are filled with factual errors, blatant misrepresen-
tations, omissions, political persuasions, and outdated
material?
In spite of the many flaws present in history textbooks,
some scholars believe there is a middle ground between
wholesale acceptance of textbooks and eliminating them
entirely from the curriculum. As Pearcy (2013) recently
observed,
Textbooks are deserving of much of the criticism aimed at
them--but the solution most often suggested, simply getting rid
of them, is at odds with the reality of most classrooms. What is
necessary, then, is not a wholesale abandonment of textbooks,
but a set of tools that enable a more meaningful use of them.
(p. 73)
One "middle ground" proposal that is worthy of consider-
ation is Lee's (2013) ERT. "Because textbooks continue to be
the most widely used historical resource for teachers and stu-
dents," Lee opted to retain textbooks in the classroom but
with one important modification--they would be filled with
explanatory notes that would "walk" students through vari-
ous historical processes developing their historical thinking
skills (p. 2). Truly, as Lee noted, this would be a "new type of
historical text" for students to explore history from a
Berg and Shaw 3
disciplinary point-of-view (p. 2). What distinguishes the
ERT from conventional textbooks (CTs), according to Lee, is
the student-centric approach of these narratives that eluci-
date the historical thinking process in a guided manner for
students to see rather than expecting (or hoping!) them to
come to these conclusions on their own. Lee's study posed
questions to students after randomly reading excerpts of the
Battle of Lexington from a CT and an ERT. Lee found that
students were able to answer her questions more fully and, at
times, to even pose their own questions to further a line of
inquiry after reading the ERT. What Lee is quick to note is
that, as Reisman and Wineburg (2008) have noted, "histori-
cal thinking is by its nature an invisible process" (p. 204).
The ERT method is an attractive alternative to CTs because it
reveals the historical logic and processes of an otherwise
ambiguous narrative (p. 204). On balance, Lee (2013)
concluded,
While replacing all history textbooks could prove challenging
and costly, this study suggests benefits might outweigh the
obstacles in exploring this new form of next text if we want
students to see history as more than one fact after another and to
learn to reason historically. (p. 12)
Dialogue Journals
The scholarly literature has reflected an increased awareness
of the usefulness of reflective practice and its incorporation
into teacher education programs. Camicia and Read (2011)
explored the relationship between a select group of pre-ser-
vice teachers and their fourth- and fifth-grade partners in a
study demonstrating the effectiveness of dialogue conversa-
tions recorded in journals and its connection to increased
awareness of civic mindedness among the participants. The
purpose of this qualitative study, according to the authors,
was to reveal a direct correlation between the reflective prac-
tice of journaling about social studies topics as a means of
sensitizing elementary school students to their eventual
duties as educated and informed citizens and of the demo-
cratic values embodied in the United States.
The study examined how dialogue journal activity might
help pre-service teachers understand the reading, writing, and
perspectives of elementary school students through an inter-
active experience that immersed pre-service teachers into the
"world" of elementary school students to better understand
how they think and learn. The authors argued that the social
studies have become "marginalized" and are no longer treated
as a viable subject worthy of consideration (Camicia & Read,
2011, p. 22). This attitude toward social studies has only
degenerated over the years with many teachers relying on
cookbook style textbooks to "teach" elementary school stu-
dents about history, geography, and government. In fact,
Camicia and Read's (2011) research corroborated the above
assertion, noting that most elementary school teachers relied
heavily on using a core textbook as the tried-and-true
curricular tool in their classrooms. This pre-fabricated,
mechanical curricular and pedagogical process hinders the
possibility of students engaging the material, challenging
their cognitive functioning, flexing their creative juices, and
exploring and making discoveries. A textbook-centered cur-
riculum has been shown to be the root cause of intellectual
stagnation and potentially damaging to a learner's ability to
develop critical or historical thinking skills (Pearcy, 2011;
Ravitch, 2004, 2011; Schneider, 2011; Ward, 2007).
Camicia and Read (2011) noted that the elementary school
students, teachers, and pre-service teachers benefited from
the dialogue journal exercises, specifically, the teachers were
afforded a lens into the minds of their students, while pre-
service teachers "gain[ed] valuable insights into the motiva-
tion, writing, and thought processes of elementary students
when the pre-service teachers form pen pal relationships
with elementary students" (Camicia & Read, 2011, pp.
24-25). Furthermore, the authors concluded that all the par-
ticipants benefited substantially from the dialogue journals.
The unconventional nature of the dialogue journals promoted
greater engagement, which resulted in student-led learning
among elementary school students. Moreover, the elemen-
tary school students and the pre-service teachers recognized
the importance and value of multiple perspectives, with
many of the pre-service teachers marveling at the marked
improvements shown by elementary school students in their
reasoning abilities, empathy, and general knowledge of
world events and cultures. Although a small study, Camicia
and Read (2011) have shown the learning possibilities hid-
den in reflective practices such as journaling that can be used
as an instructional tool for teachers who venture to construct
alternative curriculum choices.
Introducing dialogue journals, or "written conversations"
as the authors termed it, would facilitate dialogue and trigger
discussions between elementary students and pre-service
teachers exposing both to multiple perspectives, a valuable
conceptual framework in the study of history and in critical
thinking more generally. Pre-service teachers would not only
see a complementary viewpoint through the eyes of their
elementary school partner but, by going through this process,
also better understand the importance, indeed necessity, of
considering the voice of multiple perspectives. This is a fun-
damental consideration often missing from discussions cen-
tering on social studies or history curriculums at all levels of
education.
Culturally Responsive Teaching
Fitchett, Starker, and Good (2010) researched the effective-
ness of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) in the social
studies classroom. This qualitative study included an explo-
ration of 20 teacher candidates in a social studies methods
course where the authors used an interactive pedagogical
practice utilizing the "Review, Reflect, and React" concep-
tual model. The results of the data were mixed: On one hand,
4 SAGE Open
the authors concluded that the teacher candidates success-
fully integrated thematic analyses into their lesson plans due
to the reflective practice incorporated into the conceptual
model. However, the teacher candidates had a poor com-
mand of content knowledge resulting in the textbook becom-
ing the instructional tool of choice.
The authors argued that standardization in the way history
is recorded and presented in the secondary classroom is the
21st-century students' greatest enemy. To be more precise,
the authors are in fact advocating and advancing a post-mod-
ernist response to history and social studies education. They
allege that a uniform and standardized history curriculum
results in a lop-sided, perhaps even discriminatory, curricu-
lum. The current social studies and history curricula in the
United States conveys to non-White students that their "his-
tories" are unimportant and perpetuates the myth of an
ancient, grand narrative. In essence, the underrepresented
peoples are purposely marginalized and thus have no voice
or place in the history of their country as depicted by social
studies and history textbooks.
The specific language used by the authors, however, can
be traced back to another contentious and inflammatory intel-
lectual upheaval in the 1980s. The Orientalist debates between
Edward Said and Bernard Lewis were articulated with similar
verbiage: "pro-Western paradigm," "Eurocentrism," "mod-
ernist epistemology," and "cultural and intellectual dominion
over the other" to name a few (Fitchett et al., p. 2). Two par-
ticular phrases are worthy of note because of their connection
to Said. It could be argued that these phrases were invented by
Said--"the other" and "exhibitionism" (p. 2). Moreover, Said
alleged that the West perpetrated every conceivable crime
against a weak and unsuspecting East. These fabricated
crimes were at time couched in language that alleged sexual
violence against the East by the West. The specific use of the
term exhibitionism reminded the author of the sexual imagery
Said frequently used in his "critique" of the West.
While their post-modernist critique of social studies and
history curriculums is problematic, the authors pinpoint the
inherent danger of textbooks: "historical meanings are con-
structed as absolute truths" (Fitchett et al., p. 2). Here is why
the textbook is challenging as the preferred instructional
medium because the "omniscient voices" of the text bear the
unmistakable seal of authority (Lee, 2013, p. 1). Like the
article by Camicia and Read (2011), Fitchett et al. (2010)
noted that the social studies curriculum and its retelling of
events is a vital link or bridge between students and their
eventual roles as dutiful citizens. If the story they learn and
believe is flawed, so too will be their assumptions and beliefs
and the decisions they make based on their flawed reasoning.
In effect, they are unable to realize their full potential as citi-
zens in a democratic nation because they were taught to
accept the authorized version of history without question,
rather than exercising caution. Students do not need to be
schooled in textbook reading to become informed citizens.
What 21st-century learners need is to develop critical
thinking skills necessary to grapple with tough questions. The
passive activity of textbook reading only exacerbates the situ-
ation, leaving students gullible and fragile. Reflective practi-
tioners and other progressive educators have advocated for a
student-centered approach to teaching and the authors found
that in their study of culturally responsive teaching, a learner-
oriented curriculum works best when the textbook is subordi-
nated in favor of the student (Osterman & Kottkamp, 2006).
Persona Doll Project
Many of the reflective practices discussed in this essay were
experimentally tested in social studies methods courses in
teacher education programs. One of the most difficult tasks
confronting reflective practitioners and novice teachers are
changing innate theories-in-use (York-Barr et al., 2006).
Theories-in-use are ingrained deeply in everyone and merely
recognizing their presence is not enough to bring about sus-
tainable change. Introducing creative applications, such as
the Persona Doll Project (Logue & Kim, 2011), allow pre-
service teachers the opportunity to explore new ways to
become conscious participants in their own professional
development. Innovative curriculums, that include experien-
tial lessons, gently condition the pre-service teachers to
undergo a degree of metamorphosis, whereby old theories-
in-use are replaced with new, reflective properties.
Logue and Kim's (2011) expectations were to increase
pre-service teachers' awareness of diversity through a per-
sonal, experiential exercise pairing each participant with a
Persona Doll representing a "learner" from a socio-eco-
nomic/cultural background different from their own.
The Persona Doll was given to 63 students in a social
studies methods course. The desired outcome, explained the
authors, was for the pre-service teacher to become a vocal
advocate to the learner by being intimately exposed to the
learner's socio-economic background and unique personal
history and circumstances. A stated purpose of teacher edu-
cation programs is to prepare pre-service teachers for the
challenges of the classroom, one of which is teaching and
managing a class of diverse populations. Living in a multi-
cultural society requires that prospective teachers become
acquainted with their own privately held beliefs, prejudices,
and biases and developing an attitude of acceptance and
inclusion where students of various backgrounds will feel
safe and comfortable.
The Persona Doll Project endeavors to expose pre-service
teachers to reflective practice through the lens of diversity
education.
Diversity education that will change attitudes and teaching
practices helps candidates understand themselves and how their
own individual family and ethnic cultures affect their learning
and problem solving skills, and in turn, how they can use each
child's unique background to support teaching and learning.
(Logue & Kim, 2011, p. 3)
Berg and Shaw 5
Reflective writing practices, such as weekly journal writ-
ings, autobiographical sketches, and case studies were fun-
damental to tracing the evolutionary changes of the
pre-service teachers' general attitudes about diversity educa-
tion and their role in engendering that change. Logue and
Kim (2011) used a quasi-grounded theory approach relying
heavily on constant comparative analysis to mark noticeable
shifts or gradations of change in each teacher candidate's
attitudes and beliefs over the course of a semester. One of the
strengths of the study was the extended time period, which
covered 3 years and was conducted over the course of 4
semesters.
The Persona Doll Project gave many of these pre-service
teachers their first introduction to the types of myriad stu-
dents they would typically come across in school settings.
And, the authors contend, this allows them a chance to grap-
ple with tough situations they may have never encountered
before in an observational setting. This clinical trial bloom
would give them the skills necessary to successfully navigate
the emotional straits of a particular student's circumstances
without passing judgment and to handle delicate situations
with confidence.
Another strength of the Persona Doll Project was facilitat-
ing a discussion-based feedback system where fellow stu-
dents and teachers constructively critiqued and advised one
another in an effort to become more sensitive teachers. This
dynamic learning process is at the heart of reflective prac-
tice. Pre-service teachers regularly exercised critical think-
ing skills, where they presented ideas, received constructive
feedback, and analyzed and reflected on their thinking and
beliefs in light of their colleagues'suggestions, before finally
presenting to a "live" class. These simulations were useful
exercises. Their success, it can be argued, is in large part due
to the safe environment they worked in where they were able
to "build trust with one another," a key ingredient to reflec-
tive practice and self growth and development (Logue &
Kim, 2011, p. 6).
The study was successful in achieving its goals, which
were to expose pre-service teachers, in a meaningful way, to
diverse learning populations and, through that experience,
challenge and change their attitudes and beliefs toward
diverse learners so that they would become an advocate for
all learners.
Mask-Making
Infusing other closely related fields of study, such as the cre-
ative arts, into social studies curriculum and instruction is a
multi-dimensional avenue to capture the learner through
engaging their creativity through physical mediums (art)
while raising the learner's vested interest in the exercise by
learning more about the significance and history of the proj-
ect. Rule and Montgomery (2011) proposed a study that
intrigued their 65 pre-service elementary school teacher-par-
ticipants, in a social studies methods course, in a way rarely
offered in teacher education--mask-making. The greatest
hindrance, in the authors' opinions, is the "current assess-
ment-focused climate" which has reached epidemic levels
across the United States (p. 58). Because high-stakes testing,
assessment, and general standardization are the cornerstones
of education today, teachers are unable or reticent to try new
possibilities to engage their students. For many, it is a scary
proposition. But Pace reassures forward-thinking teachers to
remember that learning experiences are essential in the his-
tory classroom and that one isolated incident cannot properly
measure adequate levels of learning or comprehension. "It is
quite possible," Pace (2011) remarked, "that deep learning
requires a longer time to sink in and that it may only be fully
visible a year or even multiple years after the process has
been initiated in a particular class" (p. 117). With that in
mind, reflective teachers should proceed confidently, know-
ing that the simple fact of introducing a new concept or idea
may not result in immediate, demonstrable results but could
pay dividends in the future for their students. Continuing to
challenge and encourage students to think outside-the-box
and to approach learning with reckless abandon is the top
priority of the reflective teacher.
Rule and Montgomery (2011) argued for a curriculum
that values the merits of other disciplines, such as the arts,
and that there is a viable alternative to traditional social stud-
ies instruction. "Integration of the arts into social studies
learning can be an enriching endeavor," they assure their
readers (Montgomery & Rule, 2011, p. 58). Art, as well as
other marginalized subjects, can help infuse the social stud-
ies with creative outlets otherwise untapped and expose
learners to other cultures in a way that other activities cannot.
Mask-making allows students to engage mentally and physi-
cally with the material while exercising independence in cre-
ative license, thought, and processes that lead to the eventual
production of a pictorially accurate mask. This exercise is a
perfect outlet for expressionism while allowing students to
become more culturally "aware" and informed by seeing a
culture from a native perspective. In a multicultural society,
it is important to remember when studying other cultures to
acknowledge the native perspective as well as other valuable
perspectives to create a truer vision of the subject under
consideration.
The African mask-making activity allows students to cre-
ate a piece of living history that has significance--in a sense,
they become public historians and, through their artwork,
educate others about the African cultures represented in the
masks. They become ambassadors for the Bamana people of
Mali, the Yoruba people of Nigeria and Benin, the Chockwe
people of Angola, the Luba of the Democratic Republic of
the Congo, the Maasai of Kenya and Tanzania, and the
Bembe of Zambia. Studying other cultures can be difficult,
but opening up Africa's rich cultural history through an
exciting mask-making activity brings an element of wonder
and mystery that is palpable for all the pre-service teachers.
These masks are considered supernatural, the pre-service
6 SAGE Open
teachers come to learn, and are symbolic pieces used in ritu-
alized ceremonies and dances where cultural transmission
and legacies are passed from one generation to the next. Not
only is the mask-making activity a lens into another culture,
creating these masks also encourages the development of
spatial reasoning, a skill of "fundamental importance" for
elementary school students, in a fun and exciting medium
(Montgomery & Rule, 2011, p. 64).
Montgomery and Rule (2011) were pleased with the over-
all results of the study. They concluded that the pre-service
teachers became absorbed in the mask-making process and
learned a great deal too. For example, Montgomery and Rule
noted the pre-service teachers were able to identify the physi-
calandculturalgeographyoftheirspecificmask.Furthermore,
they were articulate in their demonstrations on how the col-
ors, patterns, and structural shapes of the masks were unique
to their African people, suggesting "that the masks were now
quite significant to them" (Montgomery & Rule, 2011, p. 71).
An interesting finding of the study showed that most of the
pre-service teachers would only attempt this activity with
upper elementary school students though the first and second
graders "successfully completed their masks and evidenced
much learning; the classroom teachers of these students were
thrilled with the results of the project" (Montgomery & Rule,
2011, p. 74). Exposing this group of pre-service teachers and
elementary school students to the mechanics of mask-making
allowed them to be transported to another time and place by
exploring their historical and creative imaginations. Though
the majority of pre-service teachers said they were open to the
possibility of replicating this exercise in their own class-
rooms, the very fact they participated in an unorthodox social
studies exercise allowed them to experience and weigh the
usefulness of such creative endeavors for future projects.
Co-Teaching
A seminal article in the opportunities and possibilities of co-
teaching social studies methods education courses titled A
Catwalk Across the Great Divide: Redesigning the History
Teaching Methods Course broached an underappreciated
topic in scholarly discourse. McDiarmid and Vinten-
Johansen (2000) teamed together to teach an experimental
course at Michigan State University. They believed combin-
ing talents would produce a more effective social studies
methods course illuminating the chasm that separated his-
torical theory and practice with educational pedagogy.
McDiarmid and Vinten-Johansen began their professional
association uneventfully but over the next few years, they
constantly refined their course and the improvement seen in
student projects and reflections was noticeable.
Primary Sources
Building on McDiarmid and Vinten-Johansen's (2000) model,
Sandwell (2012) purposed to bridge the "great divide" and
teach a social studies methods course for pre-service teachers.
However, the transition for Sandwell was fraught with hidden
obstacles and uncertainties. Streamlining the syllabus and the
primary instructional method for the course was paramount.
Sandwell (2012) believed that "one elective course in a
crowded teacher education curriculum" could bring about
remarkable change (p. 226). A theme threaded throughout her
article reflecting on her experiences teaching a social studies
methods course for pre-service teachers is the "relationship
between small practices and big ideas" (p. 226). The small
practice that would become the bedrock of her courses was
analyzing and extracting meaning from primary source docu-
ments. The textbook, in Sandwell's opinion, was a poor sub-
stitute and made history antiseptic. Using primary sources
"makes possible more and different kinds of learning activi-
ties then are provided by textbooks: it also appeals to `multi-
ple intelligences' theories of effective learning" (Sandwell,
2012, p. 228). For Sandwell, this was the surest way to
develop historical thinking skills, such as weighing and eval-
uating evidence, making judgments, drawing conclusions,
deriving meaning and significance from all these disparate
parts, and developing a workable interpretation. This could
only be possible by working like a historian.
A significant discovery for Sandwell (2012) was that
describing history's constituent parts would only go so far in
achieving content mastery. "It was only by engaging them in
the process that they would learn to think differently and to
think about history as process" (Sandwell, 2012, p. 232). To
guide student investigations into primary sources, Sandwell
would supply them with critical questions to keep in mind
while reading and constructing meaning from the documents.
As they began to develop a theory or insight, she would mod-
ify these questions to guide further inquiry. In her experi-
ence, this simple approach to evaluating primary sources and
extrapolating meaning from them was "liberating, invigorat-
ing, and empowering" for students (Sandwell, 2012, p. 237).
There are imposing challenges, however, that Sandwell
believed disadvantaged pre-service social studies teachers
before they ever stepped foot in their classrooms.
Given the structural problems confronting prospective history
teachers--the dearth of real disciplinary knowledge among
history majors graduating from most universities; the fact that
my student need only three university history courses to enter
into teacher education as secondary school history specialists;
the very short duration of teacher education programs generally,
and history teacher education in particular; the disdain for
disciplinary knowledge, especially in the case of history, in the
public school system; and the poor training in history education
that too many students continue to receive throughout the
country--in spite of all these factors, I think there are reasons to
celebrate the possibility of change at this point in time.

Reflective practitioners know that there are a few tried-
and-true methods for combating challenges and obstacles
Berg and Shaw 7
within the classroom and workplace. Specifically, continuing
professional development both individually and corporately
is an effective method to surmount challenges (Osterman &
Kottkamp, 2006; York-Barr et al., 2006). Other strategies
reflective practitioners rely on are forming relationships with
more experienced colleagues outside their department and
forming personal and professional relationships with them.
One way this practice can be articulated in school practice is
through co-teaching classes.
Co-Teaching Revisited
When Enfield and Stasz (2011) decided to co-teach two
teacher education methodology courses in language arts/
social studies and mathematics/science, they were unpre-
pared for the powerful insights they would glean from the
experience. Co-teaching was a foreign concept to both edu-
cators but they saw an opportunity to teach prospective
teachers by example the behaviors and attitudes they believed
reflective teachers should embody. There is a disconnect,
generally speaking, between 21st-century students and their
teachers (Diaz, Middendorf, Pace, & Shopkow, 2008). In an
effort to bridge the gap between teacher expectations and
practices and actual student learning, Enfield and Stasz
(2011) purposefully created their courses in interdisciplinary
methods courses with the expressed intent of meeting the
needs of their students.
Teacher educators ask future teachers to reflect on experiences.
However, teacher educators rarely offer explicit modeling of
effective reflection; often do not explain how reflection relates
to professional activity; or fail to make their own reflections
evident to future teachers. (p. 108)
An unexpected illness, however, changed the course of
the semester in ways Enfield and Stasz (2011) could not have
predicted. Unable to meet for their first class meeting, Stasz
joined the class via SkypeTM and, through active listening,
observed Enfield's ability to "reflect in the moment" as he
moderated class discussion (Enfield & Stasz, 2011, p. 111).
From a distance, Stasz became a "reflective listener" and,
during a class break, conferred with Enfield about the trajec-
tory of the class discussions and offered some possible start-
ing points for further discussion (p. 111). Enfield resumed
class discussion using Stasz's prompts and the result was a
"spirited discussion" that proceeded much longer than antici-
pated (p. 111). After the first day concluded, Enfield and
Stasz reconvened to analyze and reflect on the unusual hap-
penings of the methods class. They came to the conclusion
that "critical reflection as a listening endeavor" was highly
desirable and that Stasz's sudden illness contributed to the
coincidental discovery of its importance in instructional
practice but also in reflective practice (p. 112).
One of the reflective practices Enfield and Stasz (2011)
continually used with their students were discussion-based
activities. These were not ordinary student-led discussions
confined to a small block of time per class, but were sub-
stantial dialogues that involved active participation from
everyone including Enfield and Stasz. Enfield and Stasz
modeled the behavior they wanted their students to emulate
in their own classrooms and establishing a community of
like-minded learners where everyone felt comfortable to
actively participate led to discussions where ideas were
freely exchanged between students and professors alike.
Having that kind of educational and professional transpar-
ency inside the classroom over the course of a semester
undoubtedly made an impression on the pre-service teach-
ers. As the authors noted, reflective practitioners should
make it a practice to "reflect on action and to reflect in
action" to understand and model the behaviors they wish
their students to adopt (Enfield & Stasz, 2011, p. 113).
Enfield and Stasz took a calculated risk when they aban-
doned their carefully planned syllabus after the first day of
school in favor of a hands-on approach that evolved through-
out the semester. Looking back on the experience, they con-
cluded, "engaging in practices as we described here require
a willingness to take risks, to be fearless, and to make one-
self vulnerable" (Enfield & Stasz, 2011, p. 114). Their con-
clusions are what make reflective practice strategies, such as
co-teaching, such rewarding professional experiences for
teachers and students alike.
Conclusion
In recent years, there has been a resurgence in social studies
reflective practice literature. Those considered in this article
include textbooks, dialogue journals, culturally responsive
texts (CRT), the Persona Doll Project, mask-making, pri-
mary source documents, and co-teaching. Each reflective
practice strategy has its merits and could be implemented in
pedagogical practice easily. There is abundant literature on
the virtues of reflective practice for teachers, pre-service
teachers, and students. The ultimate goal of education dove-
tails with that of reflective practice--to make a positive
impact on professional educators and to transfer those influ-
ential attitudes, beliefs, and behaviors on to pre-service
teachers, who then transmit them to students.
In a social studies context, reflective practice is neces-
sary to bring meaning and value to a subject that is becom-
ing increasingly marginalized in the public school system.
Traditional teaching methods and curricular tools, such as
the textbook, have been shown to be dangerous to social
studies and history students in its present form but, as
some scholars have suggested, they can still serve a vital
function if they adapt to the needs of 21st-century
students.
The reflective practices discussed in this article offer via-
ble alternatives that are exciting and engaging for students
and teachers making learning dynamic and fun. As Pace
(2011) warned,
8 SAGE Open
It is clear from both the nature of historical practice and the
intellectual politics of the discipline that it would be very
unfortunate to attempt to force a single form of assessment of
student learning on the discipline from the top down. (p. 117)
The same disclaimer could warn against compartmental-
izing the myriad ways in which teachers can teach rather
than mandating one method over another. The strategies
reviewed in this article are an excellent beginning for a
teacher willing to take a risk and try something innovative.
