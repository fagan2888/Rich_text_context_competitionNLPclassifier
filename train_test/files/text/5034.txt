Introduction
The first examples of patents on wave energy converters
(WECs) were filed more than two centuries ago. Until
today, more than 500 devices have been proposed, such as
"rocking ducks" (Salter, 1974), "articulated rafts"
(Cockerell, 1980); McCabe, 1992), "oscillating buoys"
(Falnes and Budal, 1978), and "oscillating water columns"
(Wells, 1993). Despite the inventive fervor, only few of
these WECs were actually manufactured and tested. The
largest obstacle to the commercial development of WECs
is the high total cost. For instance, in the case of Oscillating
Water Column (OWC) devices, the construction of a rein-
forced concrete structure is required and this can constitute
up to 66% of total costs. A possible solution to reduce
these costs is the insertion of the OWC device inside a
breakwater. An example of this type of installation is the
one operating in the port of Sakata (Takahashi et al., 1992)
since 1989. In this way, the incidence of the cost due to the
structure for the OWC is drastically reduced, and the plant
fulfills a double purpose: to defend the stretch of water
behind it and to produce electrical energy by means of gen-
erators connected to one or more turbines (for instance,
high solidity Wells turbines). The Wells turbine is actually
a self-rectifying axial flow turbine (Raghunathan, 1995)
suitable for the conversion of the kinetic energy of the
oscillating air flow into unidirectional mechanical energy
of the turbine shaft. Another possibility is the use of
impulse turbines (Thakker and Hourigan, 2004). Both
Wells and impulse turbines have been examined in various

Abstract
Among the different technologies developed in order to harness wave energy, the Oscillating Water Column devices are
the most accredited for an actual diffusion. Recently, Boccotti has patented the REWEC1 (REsonant sea Wave Energy
Converter solution 1), a submerged breakwater that performs an active coast protection, embedding an Oscillating
Water Column device, which is capable of operating under resonant conditions with that sea state, which gives the
highest yearly energy contribution. The REWEC1 dynamic behavior can be approximated by means of a mass-spring-
damper system. According to this approximation, a criterion for evaluating the oscillating natural frequency of the
REWEC1 has been derived. This criterion has been validated against both experimental results and computational fluid
dynamics simulations, performed on a REWEC1 laboratory-scale model. The numerical simulations have shown a good
agreement between measurements and predictions.

configurations for wave energy conversion (e.g. Setoguchi
and Takao, 2006). In order to improve the energy conver-
sion process, both high and low solidity Wells turbines
need to be characterized by good efficiencies over a wide
range of flow rates (Curran et al., 1997; Raghunathan,
1995). Furthermore, turbine performance has to be opti-
mized not only considering the turbine as a standalone
machine but also as a whole together with the OWC plant.
Several experimental analyses have been carried out in
order to investigate the performance of Wells turbines. For
instance, wind tunnel tests have been considered under
both constant or reciprocating flow conditions (Torresi
et al., 2007), using scaled devices (Filianoti and
Camporeale, 2009), or in operative plants, such as the
LIMPET (Heath, 2009) and the PICO ones (Falcao, 2001).
More detailed investigations of the fluid dynamics of
Wells turbines have been carried out by means of compu-
tational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis, regarding hydrau-
lic low solidity Wells turbines (Camporeale et al., 2003),
or high solidity Wells turbines (Dhanasekaran and
Govardhan, 2005; Torresi et al., 2008). More recently,
Boccotti (1998, 2001) invented a family of WECs named
REWEC1 (REsonant sea Wave Energy Converter solution
1), which consists of several caissons placed close to
each other, in order to form a submerged breakwater
(Figure 1(b)). Each caisson encloses a pressurized air
volume, which is connected to a completely submerged
vertical duct open to the sea, where a hydraulic low solid-
ity Wells turbine can be placed for the direct conversion of
the kinetic energy of the OWC into mechanical energy
(Torresi et al., 2004).
Actually, the incident waves cause fluctuations of the
water free surface inside the pressurized caisson, and the
alternate exhalation and inhalation of the water in the ver-
tical duct drive the turbine. The main characteristic of the
REWEC1 is that it can be designed in order to operate
under resonance conditions with the characteristic fre-
quency of the sea state, which gives the greatest yearly
energy contribution. Under such conditions, the amplitude
of the fluctuations of the water free surface inside the pres-
surized caisson increases, increasing the amount of kinetic
energy of the OWC. Actually, the REWEC1 dynamic
behavior can be approximated by means of a mass-spring-
damper system. According to this approximation, a crite-
rion for calculating the oscillating frequencies of the
REWEC1 can be derived. This criterion has been validated
against both the experimental results and CFD simula-
tions, performed on a REWEC1 laboratory-scale model.
Previously, CFD simulations were also carried out in order
to study the dynamic behavior of a scaled model placed in
a wave flume (Scarpetta et al., 2015).
Experimental set-up
The REWEC1 (Figure 1(b)) is essentially a submerged
caisson with a U-tube inside. The first branch of the U-tube
is a vertical duct connecting the free water surface to the
second branch, a chamber in which an air pocket is gener-
ated by means of compressed air. The value of the
REWEC1 undamped natural frequency, fn
, depends on
the value of the height of the air pocket inside the chamber,

0
, under resting conditions (Figure 2(a)). In order to
reach the resonance conditions with the frequencies of the
fundamental seas, the value of 
0
can be modified varying
the value of the pressure inside the chamber. In order to
replicate the REWEC1 dynamic behavior in laboratory, an
experimental test rig (Filianoti, 2004) was specifically
designed (Figure 2(b)), in order to generate free damped
harmonic oscillations. A lower caisson replicates the
REWEC1, whereas an upper caisson is used in order to
simulate the REWEC1 submergence. The use of the upper
caisson is needed in order to be able to generate the non-
equilibrium initial condition, as will be explained in the
test procedure description. As a result of the free damped
harmonic oscillations, the value of the damped natural fre-
quency, fd
, was obtained. Then, taking into account the

schematics.

quency, fn

All the geometrical parameters (Figure 2(a)) of the
experimental device are summarized in Table 1.
The test procedure is as follows:
1. The valves of both upper and lower caissons are
opened, connecting each air pocket with the
atmosphere.
2. A specified amount of water is introduced in the
upper caisson and part of it overflows in the lower
one. During this operation, the valve in the lower
caisson is closed, in order to generate an air pocket
inside it with a  lower than 
0
.
3. Air is pumped inside the lower caisson until the
desired resting condition is achieved.
4. In order to generate the initial non-equilibrium
condition ( 
in

0
and p2,in
 p2,0
), the valve of the
upper caisson is closed and air is pumped inside it,
reaching p1
 patm
.
5. When the valve of the upper caisson is opened, the
value of the pressure in the upper caisson drops to
the atmospheric value and the free damped har-
monic oscillations occur.
In order to evaluate fd
and , the values of the pressure
inside the air pocket of both the upper, p1
, and the lower,
p2
, caissons were measured by means of pressure trans-
ducers. Table 2 summarizes the initial and resting condi-
tions during the test. The results of this test have been
compared with those computed by the analytical model
and the CFD simulations.
Analytical model
An analytical model, describing the behavior of the water
flow inside a REWEC1, has been developed under the
simplifying hypothesis of one-dimensional and incom-
pressible flow. Actually, the REWEC1 is essentially a
U-tube (Figure 3) and its fluid-dynamic behavior can be
correctly described along a streamline, which starts from
the air­water interface inside the lower caisson (point A)
and ends at the air­water interface inside the upper caisson
(point B).
Applying the generalized Bernoulli equation along that
streamline, one obtains

where HA
and HB
are the total heads in the points A
and B, respectively, while HW
is the sum of the head
losses along the streamline. The left hand side of Equation
2 is actually the integral of the Euler equation and, for
the sake of simplicity, can be computed considering

only the two vertical paths along the streamline, neglect-
ing the contribution of the local inertia of the water
below the bottom end of the duct. The first path goes
from the air­water interface inside the lower caisson to
the bottom opening of the vertical duct (C); the second
goes from the aforesaid aperture to the air­water inter-
face inside the upper caisson. Hence, the integral can be

the value of the pressure inside the air pocket. In order to
validate the analytical model, the value of fn
calculated
from Equation 16 will be compared to these resulting from
both the experimental and CFD analyses.
CFD analysis
The CFD analysis has been carried out using a computa-
tional domain, which reproduces the 2D schematic reported
in Figure 2(a)). This domain has been discretized by means
of the grid generator Pointwise adopting a multi-block
structured mesh. The total mesh size has approximately
60,000 cells. The numerical domain has been imported in
the ANSYS Fluent solver. The physical model under inves-
tigation is described by means of the Navier­Stokes equa-
tions written for an unsteady two-phase flow. These
equations are discretized according to a Finite Volume
approach, adopting a pressure-based algorithm in its
implicit formulation. The two-phase interaction is taken
into account by means of the Eulerian Volume of Fluid
(VOF) Model. Air is assumed to be compressible, in order
to take into account the compressibility of the air pocket
inside the chamber. The SIMPLE algorithm has been used
for the pressure-velocity coupling. Regarding the spatial
discretization of the equations, the Green-Gauss cell-based
scheme has been used for gradients, the PRESTO! scheme
for pressure, whereas first-order upwind schemes for
momentum and the energy. In order to evaluate the surface
of separation of the different phases, the Geo-Reconstruct
model has been used. Regarding the temporal discretiza-
tion, a time step t
=
0.001
s has been chosen and the first-
order implicit scheme has been used for the transient
formulation. Every two time steps, the values of the pres-
sure inside both the lower and the upper caissons have been
registered, allowing the analysis of the dynamic behavior
of the water inside the device during post-processing.
Results
In order to make a comparison with the experimental test,
a numerical simulation has been carried out, setting the
values of the initial and the resting conditions reported in
Table 2. The graph in Figure 4 shows a comparison
between the values of p2
registered during the simulation
and the experimental test (Filianoti, 2004). From the com-
parison, we can see that the values of the pressure regis-
tered in both cases are in quite good agreement in terms of
amplitude, while the values registered in the experimental
test seems to have a time delay with respect to the CFD
ones. The value of the time period between the second and
the third peak has been assumed to be equal to the damped
natural period, Td
, from which the values of the damped
natural frequencies, fd
, are equal to 0.893Hz in the exper-
imental test and 0.896Hz in the CFD simulation.
From both the experimental and the CFD analyses, the
value of the undamped natural frequency, fn
, has been cal-
culated from the value of fd
(Equation 1), in order to make
a comparison with the analytical result (Equation 16).
Torresi et al. 105
The value of the damping ratio, , has been evaluated com-
puting the logarithmic decrement,  , between the second
and the third peak of the oscillations. From the value of ,
the following equation has been used for the calculation of
the damping ratio,

Table 3 summarizes the results derived from the ana-
lytical model, the experimental test, and the CFD simula-
tion. Other CFD simulations have been carried out
considering the same resting conditions and varying the
initial ones (Table 4). From the registered value of p2
, the
values of  and fd
have been calculated for each simula-
tion according to the same methods described before.
The graph reported in Figure 5(a)) shows the values of 
for the different values of 
i
n. The trend shown in the graph
is due to the fact that the value of the damping ratio grows
with the absolute value of the difference between 
in
and

0
due to the increase of dissipations in the water flow. The
graph reported in Figure 5(b)) shows the values of fd
for
the different values of 
in
. Considering that the value of fn
remains constant, from Equation 1, we expect that also the
value of fd
grows with the absolute value of the difference

Finally, the graph reported in Figure 6 shows the compari-
son between the values of fn

erations, the values are in quite good agreement when the

Conclusion
The results derived from the CFD simulations are in good
agreement with the experimental test ones, showing that
the proposed 2D numerical model can be successfully used
for the evaluation of both the damped, fd
, and undamped,
fn
, natural frequencies of a REWEC1. The proposed ana-
lytical model, based on a simple analogy with a mass-
spring-damper system, has been also validated, allowing a
quite good prediction of the undamped natural frequency,
fn
, with respect to both numerical and experimental calcu-
lations. Finally, by means of the CFD analysis, the effect of
the initial conditions on both damped, fd
, and undamped,
fn
, natural frequencies has been considered under the
hypothesis of maintaining constant the resting condition.
