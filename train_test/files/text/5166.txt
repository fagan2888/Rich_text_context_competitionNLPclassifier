Introduction
One of the vexing issues bedeviling Nigeria in recent years
has been the violent militancy in some corners of the country.
The emergence of many of these militant groups such as the
Odua People's Congress (OPC) and the Niger Delta militants
is the result of poor governance by the various military juntas
that reigned for decades in Nigeria. The coercive nature of
their military rule opened channels for abuse, including the
abuse of office, corruption, human right violations, and gross
disregard for laws by the military leaders; hence, the emer-
gence of militant groups as a force intended to check the
excesses of the military. However, militancy has taken on a
full-blown violent dimension since the return of democratic
governance in the country in 1999. And the return of democ-
racy after a long period of military rule has emboldened the
chain of corruption in the country. This is evident from the
arrests of numerous top state and federal government offi-
cials for diverting wealth derived from crude oil revenue.
State governors and ministers have been arrested; some were
convicted whereas others are being prosecuted in court for
diverting, mismanaging, or outright theft of the wealth
intended for projects to aid the people. However, militancy is
due to variety of factors, such as ethno-nationalism, religious
extremism, and separatist movement, and each group has its
own desired objectives and methods. This article endeavors
only to describe how poor governance has exacerbated the
activities of Islamist violent militant group in northern
Nigeria.
The absence of projects and other basic needs have been
responsible for the increase in economic and social gaps
between the rich and the poor, and has led to a massive vac-
uum in infrastructural development. The result has been a
continued level of poverty, illiteracy, and unemployment
within the ranks of average Nigerians, thus creating the per-
fect arena for breeding violent militancy in Nigeria. Rotberg
(2004) observed that there is a link between poverty, poor
governance, and state failure, and this combination provides
a perfect breeding ground for militancy and subsequent
instability. One of the militant groups that emerged in north-
ern Nigeria is the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati Wal-
Jihad (JASLWJ), also known as Boko Haram, led by
Mohammed Yusuf. The JASLWJ leader was closely related

Cycle of Bad Governance and Corruption:
The Rise of Boko Haram in Nigeria
Mohammed Nuruddeen Suleiman1
and Mohammed Aminul Karim1
Abstract
This article argues that bad governance and corruption particularly in the Northern part of Nigeria have been responsible
for the persistent rise in the activities of Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (JASLWJ), Arabic for "people committed to
the propagation of the tradition and jihad." It is also known as "Boko Haram," commonly translated as "Western education
is sin." Based on qualitative data obtained through interviews with Nigerians, this article explicates how poor governance
in the country has created a vicious cycle of corruption, poverty, and unemployment, leading to violence. Although JASLWJ
avows a religious purpose in its activities, it takes full advantage of the social and economic deprivation to recruit new
members. For any viable short- or long-term solution, this article concludes that the country must go all-out with its anti-
corruption crusade. This will enable the revival of other critical sectors such as agriculture and manufacturing, likely ensuring
more employment. Should the country fail to stamp out corruption, it will continue to witness an upsurge in the activities of
JASLWJ, and perhaps even the emergence of other violent groups. The spillover effects may be felt not only across Nigeria
but also within the entire West African region.

to some renowned figures in the Izala sect,1 as he was a for-
mer brilliant student of the late Sheik Ja'afar Mahmud Adam
(Sani, 2011a). Ja'afar was an influential Izala-salafi adher-
ent; he was assassinated by unknown gunmen in 2007 during
prayers. Evidence suggests that Ja'afar and Yusuf parted
ways before 2007 due to irreconcilable difference concern-
ing their ideology toward teaching the tenets of Islam. Ja'afar
had on several occasions in Nigeria and Saudi Arabia tried to
admonish Yusuf to recant and reevaluate his stance,2 but
Yusuf always refused to come to an understanding based on
his principles, this subsequently led to the assassination of
Ja'afar.
This JASLWJ holds a puritanical view in adhering to
Islamic injunctions and tends to have strong disdain for
Western institutions due to the perceived belief that they sup-
port the inequitable political and economic system in
Nigeria.3 This trend was amplified by the perception that the
ruling elites perpetrated social injustice through the misman-
agement of the collective wealth of the nation. The JASLWJ
took the opportunity to propagate its doctrines in the heart of
the teeming disgruntled population. At the same time, the
JASLWJ was categorical in condemning democracy and its
institutions in Nigeria, because they believed it was in direct
variance with and contradicted the teachings of Islam. They
blamed all the ills of the nation as consequences of deviating
from the teachings of Islam. The President of the Civil Rights
Congress in Nigeria categorically sums up the intricacies fol-
lowing the rise of the group, and suggests that
Yusuf took advantage of poor quality of our educational system,
the incessant strikes, and cult activities. . . . the irresponsible
leadership at all levels of government, unemployment, poverty,
corruption and insecurity. And as he pointed out such failures,
citing verses of Quran and the saying of the prophet, the youths
saw him as the leader who will indeed deliver them from
malevolence to the Promised Land. (Sani, 2011a)
Mockaitis (2011) observed that ideology has the strong
capability to create social mobilization, and the group behind
the mobilization can effectively exploit the frustrations in a
society to promote its beliefs. The JASLWJ strategy of using
the holy Quran to captivate the mind of its followers (Walker,
2012), and attributing the ills faced by the nation to the influ-
ences of Western civilization, has created an army of sup-
porters. Nonetheless, this radical sect metamorphosed into a
bloody violent group in 2009 after a confrontation with
Nigerian security. This led to the death of about 800 mem-
bers of the group (Cook, 2011), and the arrest of some of the
group members, including their leader. The Nigerian police
took the sect leader into custody; however, he died some few
hours later under mysterious circumstances. Observers
believed that he was extra-judicially executed as reported by
the media ("Islamist Leader Killed in Nigeria," 2009). When
Yusuf was killed, Abubakar Shekau became the new leader
of the JASLWJ, and he is considered to be more aggressive
than the late leader Yusuf (Zenn, 2011), and equally far less
knowledgeable. The consolidation of Shekau as the new
leader of the group widens the parameter of the group's radi-
calism. The two qualities of the new leader being more radi-
cal and intellectually inferior played a major role in
radicalizing the movement after the death of Yusuf. From
2009 onward, the country has been beset with internal war
against a known but faceless group that has grown steadily
more formidable. This group introduced a new dimension to
its tactics by using suicide bombings to attack its targets. One
of the first targets of the group was the Nigerian Inspector
General of Police; he narrowly escaped when a suicide
bomber targeted his vehicle within the premises of his office,
a place previously considered to be one of the safest places in
the country. This was followed by another suicide attack on
the United Nations headquarters in Nigeria. Since then, the
casualties of these hostilities have been in the hundreds, from
civilians to combatants, as well as people across all ethnic
and religious sectors of the country. Furthermore, although
the JASLWJ originated in North Eastern Nigeria, it has
enjoyed widespread support attracting members from across
the Northern region of the country. Many young girls from
this region were indoctrinated using verses of the Holy
Quran, and were used as suicide bombers. A case in particu-
lar, in 2014 an indoctrinated father of a 13-year-old girl vol-
unteered his daughter for a suicide mission ("Girl Says
Father Gave Her to Boko Haram," 2014), but she recanted
few moment toward the target, while her colleagues blew
themselves off killing several people. Islam is indeed the
vehicle used by the JASLWJ for indoctrination, but this arti-
cle has demonstrated how bad governance which has created
myriad of problems such as unemployment is fueling the
activities of the group. The absence of employment opportu-
nities created by bad governance has increased the level of
poverty and it has become more pervasive. Some JASLWJ
members were arrested for attacking Ekklizivar Yan'uwa
Nigeria (EYN) Church, and they revealed that they were
paid about US$70 to carry out the attack (Ola, 2012). This
demonstrate the level of poverty, and the possibility of this is
reflected in the very statistics mentioned in (Appendix A),
which indicate that about 73% of the population in northern
Nigeria is living in absolute poverty. In acknowledging this
very fact, the then Chairman of the People's Democratic
Party (PDP), the ruling party, Bamanga Tukur, lamented to
the upsurge of the activities of the JASLWJ, and he posit that
"people feel aggrieved. They are angry because they are hun-
gry. Unless we remove the hunger, we too may not be able to
rest" (Fabiyi, 2012).
Method and Data
The source of the data in this research was taken from a PhD
research work. The study is based on semi-structured inter-
views with 50 stakeholders, who include two former Nigerian
presidents, ministers, governors, lawyers, non-governmental
Suleiman and Karim 3
organizations, senior lecturers, and journalists. The face-to-
faceinterviewswereconductedinNigeriabetweenDecember
2011 and March 2012 in Abuja, Port Harcourt, Sokoto,
Bayelsa, Kano, and Kaduna, whereas additional phone inter-
views were conducted in 2014 with some participants from
Gombe, Yobe, and Maiduguri. The participants represented
various religious and ethnic groups. The average recording
time for each interview was 45 min; they were voice recorded
and eventually transcribed verbatim. Documents were also
obtained from major anti-corruption agencies such as the
Economic and Financial Crimes Commission, the Nigerian
Financial Intelligence Unit, and the Independent Corrupt
Practices Commission. For the secondary data, the study
relies solely on reports from national and international news-
papers and journals.
Literature Review
The literature covering militancy in the northern part of
Nigeria dwelled mostly on the origin and activities of the
groups through their radicalization on a religious platform
(Aguwa, 1997; Ibrahim, 1991; Isichei, 1987; Smith, 2010;
Winters, 1987). These studies gave the historical account and
described the increasing level of sect rivalry among the vari-
ous sects within the Muslims of northern Nigeria, as well as
how the level of intolerance of other faiths in the northern
region has heightened tension. Furthermore, while there is
quite a bit of literature specifically on the current insurgent
movement of JASLWJ in the northern part of Nigeria, there
is a dearth of studies that tried to determine the extent to
which poor governance and corruption has exacerbated the
activities of the militant groups. Most of the analyses in this
literature were based on the emergence of the group through
a religious prism. Although Aghedo and Osumah (2012) pas-
sively tried to relate the Boko Haram insurgency with the
failure of leadership to provide basic needs, their study con-
centrated more on the radical ideology of the group, noting
the excessive killings of non-Muslims as well as the attempt
to impose shari'a, Islamic law, in the country. However, the
group's radical approach has led to the death of both inno-
cent Muslims and Christians by suicide bombings and direct
gun attacks.
In his study, Adesoji (2010) gave a chronological over-
view of radical Islamic sects and their quest to implement the
Islamic justice system in secular countries such as Nigeria.
The study noted the strong correlation between inequality,
poverty, and continued uprisings, be they religious, regional,
or ethnic. Another study by Onuoha (2010) gave a general
historical account of the emergence of Boko Haram and its
subsequent confrontation with the Nigerian government. It
also suggested that the bloody and violent confrontation with
government signified a link between the group and interna-
tional terrorist organizations like Al-Qaida. Although this
study cited Nigerian system decay as a pivotal reason for the
escalation of violence, it did not provide empirical evidence
to support the theory. In another related study, Waldek and
Jayasekara (2011) tried to unveil the historical evolution of
Boko Haram's leadership, its operational strategy, and its
hierarchal structure. It also attempted to evaluate the group's
connection with other radical groups within the regional and
international borders.
Cook's (2011) study about Boko Haram started by analyz-
ing the evolution of radical Islam in Nigeria, as well as the
numerous Muslim sects in Northern Nigeria and the rivalry
that existed among them. The study attempted to draw a
major inference that the period of democratization of Nigeria
starting in 1999 rekindled the quest by many Muslims to
adopt the shari'a legal system in the northern part of the
country. This gave Boko Haram the impetus to propagate its
puritanical views about the doctrines of Islam, and provided
a platform for the group to recruit the huge population of
Islamic adherents. The study noted that one of the main rea-
sons for the upsurge in membership of Boko Haram was the
extra-judicial killing of the leader of the group, Mohammed
Yusuf, by the Nigerian police.
Other studies on Boko Haram (Onapajo & Uzodike, 2012;
Onapajo, Uzodike, & Whetho, 2012) suggested multidimen-
sional reasons for the emergence of the group. The major
impetus proffered by these studies was the antagonist stand
toward Western civilization. Coupled with the failure of the
government to improve the lives of Nigerian citizens, this
aggravated the abhorrence of Western institutions, although
these studies took only a cursory look at the widespread pov-
erty as a reason for the emergence of Boko Haram. The study
depended wholly on secondary sources of data for its analy-
sis, but our study has augmented these with primary sources
of data to elicit more concise findings on the phenomenon.
Another study (Salaam, 2012) suggests that the history of
Boko Haram is synchronized with the lag in Western educa-
tion in northern Nigeria. The disparity between the northern
and southern regions in their attainment of Western educa-
tion has played a major role in the rise of militant groups.
Both before and after Nigeria gained independence from the
United Kingdom in 1960, the northern region remained
backward in Western education. This was because, in north-
ern region, Western education was perceived as an alien phi-
losophy, and was considered a tool used by the Christian
missionaries. This attitude continues to the modern day, and
the gap grows wider as the population increases. The study
pointed out the important role of poverty and unemployment
in the region as a major trigger for the group's activities; this
is also in line with our argument in this research. However,
we have delved further to expound how this is related to poor
governance, as well as to the threats to the Nigerian state
from the two major violent groups.
Another related study (Loimeir, 2007, pp. 24-27) endeav-
ored to analyze radical militancy in Northern Nigeria from a
historical prism of colonialism. The fusion of Western civili-
zation into the semi-feudalistic society of Northern Nigeria
during the colonial era brought about sudden change. As to
4 SAGE Open
be expected, many people were resistant to the change; this
led to the emergence of several sects, all professing Islam but
opposed to each other. The study suggested that Boko Haram
is an extension of the numerous sects that emerged in north-
ern Nigeria following independence.
Conceptual Framework
In trying to understand how poor governance fueled the
unrest and provided an enabling environment for the JASLWJ
to recruit members, it is necessary to contextualize the con-
cept of governance. In conceptualizing governance,
Kaufmann (2005) illustrated its three main elements: politi-
cal, economic, and institutional dimensions, thus defining
governance as follows:
The traditions and institutions by which authority in a country is
exercised for the common good . . . the government capacity to
effectively manage its resources and implement sound policies,
and the respect of citizens and the state for the country's
institutions. (pp. 41-43)
Rotberg (2009) posited that "governance is the delivery of
high quality political goods to citizens by government of all
kinds . . . political goods are security and safety, rule of law,
participation and human rights, sustainable economic oppor-
tunity and human development" (pp. 113-116). Hence, the
ability of the government to provide its people with the basic
needs and satisfaction remains the paramount objective of
government. Rotberg (2004) further stressed that when sov-
ereign countries are battered by continuous internal unrest
and failure to deliver the basic needs to the populace, the
nation tends to fail. Burgoon (2006) described how social
welfare policies such as social security, provision of health
care, education, and employment would go a long way in
reducing poverty, general insecurity, political and religious
extremism, thereby reducing the tendency for violent mili-
tancy in a society. Good governance is essential for maintain-
ing and sustaining the legitimacy of authority; its absence
becomes poor governance, allowing poverty, crimes, and
corruption to mushroom, affecting the performance of
authority and weakening its legitimacy.
Hence, this article uses some sections of Ted Robert
Gurr's Relative Deprivation (RD) theory. Gurr (1970)
defined RD as
actors' perception of discrepancy between their value
expectations and their value capabilities. Value expectations are
the goods and conditions of life to which people believe they
are rightfully entitled. Value capabilities are the goods and
conditions they think they are capable of getting and keeping
. . . and value position is the amount or level of value actually
attained.
These values are multidimensional and are comprised of
those things humans struggle to have for their sustenance.
Gurr categorizes the values into three groups: welfare values
(economic and self-actualization), power values (participa-
tion in society and security), and interpersonal (relationships
and place in society).
The theory suggests that the larger the discrepancy
between the expectations and the capabilities of people, the
greater the depth of discontent. In a society with inequitable
distribution of social and economic goods, when people
compare their current value position with that of others
within their society who are better off, and they know they
hold the same legitimate right and privilege to have what
those others have, it triggers an atmosphere of tension that
leads to violence (Bowen, 1977). This theory explains how
deprivation of social and economic goods leads to frustra-
tion, aggression, and ultimately to collective violence. When
people are denied the basic needs of life, especially when
those in charge of the distribution of social and economic
goods live flamboyant lives, it creates an atmosphere of ten-
sion that often leads to a combustible violence. Hence, this
theory is suitable to explain how corruption and bad gover-
nance by the Nigerian elite widened the population's social
and economic gap, thus creating an atmosphere of discontent
and protest, and resulting in violence. The return of democ-
racy to the Nigeria in 1999, after 30 years of military rule,
created high expectations of a rewarding future for the peo-
ple of the country under a transparent and accountable gov-
ernment. However, the tenets of democracy were
compromised by the ruling elites, causing grievances and
radicalization. This article uses the RD theory to explore how
poor governance led to RD and consequently fueled mili-
tancy, particularly after the return of democracy to Nigeria.
The RD theory illustrates how deprivation of social and eco-
nomic goods leads to frustration, aggression, and violence.
The escalation of poverty and unemployment in northern
Nigeria has drastically increased the potential for recruit-
ment by militant groups in the region. It is with this backdrop
that we hypothesize that poor governance in Nigeria has
been equally responsible for the upsurge in activity of the
insurgent group JASLWJ.
Findings
Northern Nigeria, which was once a separate colony, con-
tains the vast majority of poor people in the country (see
Appendix A). The pervasive backwardness of Northern
Nigeria was ignored by its longest serving military ruling
elites before they handed over power to a democratic govern-
ment in 1999. For instance, in 1998, at the eve of the return
of democracy to the country, the basic primary education
enrollment in the northern region was below 60% and even
below 20% in some states within the region (Okobiah, 2002).
As such, there is a wide difference in the literacy level
between the northern and southern parts of the country.
Borno, a state in the northern part, has a 14.5% literacy level,
whereas Lagos, a state in the south, achieved 92.0% (United
Suleiman and Karim 5
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization,
2012). Furthermore, even in the democratic era, the states in
the region did nothing to mitigate the issue, for instance,
since the return of democracy, Yobe has consistently allo-
cated an average of 16% of its total budget to education,
whereas the health sector is allocated 6% (Chinedu &
Olabimtan, 2010). However, even with such rates of alloca-
tion, the education sector remains in poor condition (see
Table 1). For instance, between 2004 and 2008, Ekiti, which
is in the south of the country, was able to build more primary
schools, as well as improve the teaching capability of the
teachers, whereas in Yobe, the teaching skills of the majority
of the teachers continue to deteriorate. Essentially, while
some of the state budget for education pays the salaries of
unqualified teachers, other funds drain into the funnel of
corruption.
In addition, in the northeast region, the health situation
has worsened (see Appendix C), and also the level of mater-
nal and child health has been retrogressing.About 139 deaths
occur in every 1,000 children, compared with only about 32
in 1,000 in the southern states. This is a result of a lack of
medical services (Doctor, Bairagi, Findley, Helleringer, &
Dahiru, 2011). Informants interviewed in this study believe
that the reoccurring uprising by JASLWJ in northern Nigeria,
though purporting to be religious, has been triggered mainly
by government corruption that escalated the level of poverty,
unemployment, and lack of basic needs for the people, which
in turn generated the radicalization of unemployed youth.
Although there are studies (such as Abadie, 2004; Krueger &
Maleckova, 2002, 2003; Pape, 2005) suggesting that poverty
and lack of education do not necessarily lead people to acts
of terrorism, other studies (such as Blomberg, Hess, &
Weerapana, 2004; Burgoon, 2006; Freytag, Krüger,
Meierrieks, & Schneider, 2009; Zaidi, 2010) have shown
how the reduction of poverty could reduce terrorism acts. In
the context of Nigeria, and particularly in the case of the
JASLWJ, the high level of corruption by public officials,
which has occasioned the persistent level of unemployment
and poverty, has created an environment of social tension,
resulting in an increased recruitment of youths to the ranks of
militancy.
In the northern region, Kano has been the commercial
nerve state from the pre-colonial era to modern northern
Nigeria, and remains the industrial hub of the region.
However, this is fast becoming a mirage, as the economic
potential of the region has been crumbling due to a multitude
of reasons: in particular, the collapse of agriculture, depen-
dency on oil rents, and the near total absence of electricity
supplied to industries in the last decade. These issues have
significantly affected the socio-economic health of the
region, resulting in unemployment and poverty. The rate of
unemployment (see Table 2) has significantly increased in
northern states where the JASLWJ has attracted followers.
Even though the statistics provided by the government are
often highly underestimated, the published rates of unem-
ployment are alarming.

The JASLWJ is largely perceived to be an Islamic move-
ment where radical elements are trying to impose Islamic
laws, and in the process killing non-Muslims. However,
recently, the victims of the JASLWJ activities have been
members of all faiths existing within the country. In
November 2014, suicide bombers killed several people in a
mosque where Emir Muhammadu Sanusi II had previously
castigated the movement of the group as un-Islamic, and he
called on all Nigerians to protect themselves against the
group ("Emir of Kano, Sanusi, Urges Nigerians to Defend
Selves Against Boko Haram," 2014). The group is no
respecter of any faith; even though they profess to champion
Islam, their activities revealed the contrary by the wanton
killings of innocent lives as well as forced conversion of
their captives to Islam.4
However, the vast majority of these victims have been
average Nigerians who rely on the government for social and
physical security. In this regard, one informant suggests that
[F]or me it is about poverty, forget about religion because
religion has very little to do with it. It is poverty and the people
just rose against those who lead them in the way that have led to
their being in the kinds of condition they are. There is a complete
disconnect between those who are in power in Nigeria and the
people of Nigeria for variety of reasons . . . Nigerian state has
become a criminal enterprise; that is what it is, let's be honest
with ourselves . . . The governors collect significant part of the
budget, called it security votes and put it in their pockets.
(Informant 27, personal interview, February 26, 2012)
The JASLWJ claims it wants to eradicate the perceived
social injustice in the country, and they believe this can only
be achieved through the establishment of and adherence to
strict Islamic shari'a, a belief shared by numerous Muslims
(Falola, 1998). In fact, the call for the establishment of
shari'a law as the formal state law did not start with the
JASLWJ; after the return of democracy in 1999, many north-
ern political elites felt the application of shari'a law would
cleanse the corrupt society and ensure social justice, so they
implemented the shari'a law in some northern states
(Mustapha, 2010). However, the implementation of shari'a
law by 12 state governors in northern Nigeria did nothing to
prevent corruption by political elites (Brulliard, 2009); the
ruling elites continued with what some Muslims from north-
ern Nigeria consider abhorrent to shari'a. For example, a
Muslim governor from the enclave of the JASLWJ was
caught on videotape giving money to an Arab prostitute in a
club in Dubai (Kperogi, 2012). This confirmed the percep-
tion in the north that the law has become a political instru-
ment for achieving political gains by the elites.
Consequently, the failure of the ruling elites, coupled with
the politicization of shari'a law in northern Nigeria, has
deepened the mistrust of government by the governed. The
apparent disregard of shari'a by the political elites contrib-
uted to the radicalization of JASLWJ members, because the
group felt the law should be implemented to its extreme.
Instead, the political elites were using it to further their per-
sonal agendas. JASLWJ seized the opportunity to uphold and
radically expand the elements of shari'a law. As articulated
by the group's purported spokesperson, Abu Qaqa, "We have
been motivated by the stark injustice in the land . . . Poor
people are tired of the injustice, people are crying for saviors,
and they know the messiahs are Boko Haram" (Monica,
2012). This is consistent with the assertion of another infor-
mant who averred,
I said that whether it is in the Niger Delta or in Maiduguri or in
Jos there is always, always an initial cry for justice which is
ignored and it is the ignominy that you give to that leads to
frustrations, that lead to violence. I am one of those who believe
that clearly the social condition, though not excusable, but create
a ripe environment for these sorts of activities to strive . . .
(Informant 20, personal interview, February 21, 2012)
Furthermore, the strategic approach of citing social injus-
tice to recruit members into the movement is evidently work-
ing. The young, unemployed Nigerians, who rarely eat more
than one meal a day, swiftly join the group due to the per-
ceived social injustice by the ruling elite. The Nigerian Secret
Service revealed that some communities are shielding mem-
bers of Boko Haram (Yemi, 2012), which inevitably makes it
very difficult for law enforcement to curtail the group's
activities. People who are aggrieved about the unabated
nature of the elites' corrupt behavior are easily recruited to
act against the system, particularly when such calls are made
on the platform of religion. Another informant reiterates the
role of corruption and poverty, suggesting that
people who are poor, who can't afford three square meals, are
prone and easy to be persuaded by people who could promise
them anything . . . poverty which is as a result of massive
corruptioninthecountryhasdirectcorrelationwithradicalization
in certain element in our society. Because somebody who is
gainfully employed, who could afford three square meals, who
has a family, who has a decent accommodation will hardly want
to be a suicide bomber. (Informant 11, personal interview, March
12, 2012)
Available statistics from the Nigerian Bureau of Statistics
(NBS) have shown the social and economic disparities in
northern Nigeria, particularly in the northeastern section
where the activities of JASLWJ have been severe. According
to the NBS (2012) report, an average of 74% of the total
population in each of the northern states lives in absolute
poverty (see Appendix A); it is implicit from this that the
majority of the youths there are out of a job, and they form
unrestrained groups that roam the streets of the communities.
One informant concludes,
It is not surprising that this Boko Haram insurgency started and
has largely been a northeastern phenomenon. The roots of all
these problems are poverty and lack of opportunity, those are the
roots of all these problems . . . when you look, you will see it is
Suleiman and Karim 7
young people between the ages of 18 and 30 that are engaged in
most of these activities and it is because of lack of opportunity
. . . Boko Haram started from the Northeast because of poverty.
It is the fundamental issue and I think unless you address that,
you will continue to have this kind of problem all over the place.
(Informant 29, personal interview, January 28, 2012)
The northern Nigerian region comprises 19 states. The
economy of the region has been based in the past on agricul-
ture and mining of natural resources. However, these sectors
have been in abysmal disarray for more than four decades,
because of two particular developments, that is, the disband-
ment of regional governments, concentrating power in the
central government; and almost total dependency on crude
oil revenue. Thus, overdependence on crude oil revenue by
the northern Nigerian ruling elites has blurred the economic
potency of the region and subjected the citizens to artificial
hardship. The population of northern Nigeria is mostly
engaged in agriculture as a profession, but overemphasis of
government revenue projections has focused on seeking
crude oil rents from other regions, jeopardizing the potential
of the agricultural sector of northern Nigeria. The overde-
pendence on crude oil revenue by northern political elites has
created tension with the crude oil producing areas in the
southern states. The culture of crude oil dependence was fur-
ther strengthened by all the 19 state governors with the return
of democracy in 1999; producing crude oil is an easy money-
making venture, which the Nigerian Constitution guarantees
to all federating states, so the states neglected other sources
for revenue. The political elites have created culture in
Nigeria that is characterized by a lack of accountability and
transparency in governance (Aluko, 2002), as such public
wealth is highly secretive and controlled by public officers.
This diverts the wealth meant for people-oriented projects to
private pockets. The overreliance on crude oil rents by the
northern state governors has drastically marginalized the
labor force, destabilized the region's productive economy,
and has bred corruption in the management of public wealth.
In addition to the vast arable land in northern Nigeria,
each of the 19 states in the region has large quantity of unex-
ploited solid mineral resources; for example, the Federal
Government Report mentions indicates large deposits of
gold as well as other solid mineral resources in the states of
Kaduna, Zamfara, Kogi, and Kebbi (Ministry of Mines and
Steel Development, 2010). The lack of attention to the min-
ing sector has been detrimental to the economy of northern
Nigeria. Olokesusi (2010) observed that the persistent inflow
of migrants from West African countries has increased the
level of illegal mining in Nigeria, thereby causing the gov-
ernment to lose about US$30 million yearly. One of the
major reasons for this lack of attention to other potential rev-
enue sectors in northern Nigeria has been the timely reim-
bursement of the state governments' accounts with crude oil
rents. Solid mineral mining requires capital and long-term
investment; and political elites always prefer to invest in a
short-term project that will yield a political profit, not neces-
sarily as a dividend of democracy for the people.
Furthermore, the Federal Government acknowledged that
"the growth, prosperity and national security of any country
are critically dependent upon adequacy of its electricity sup-
ply industry" (Presidential Action Committee on Power and
Presidential Task Force on Power, 2010). However, from
1999 to 2007, about US$16 billion was spent to revive the
power sector with no positive improvement, as revealed by
the investigative panel of the National Assembly. The panel
accused the former president Olusegun Obasanjo with com-
plicity and corrupt practices in the matter ("Obasanjo Denies
Power Corruption," 2008). No effective action has been
taken to prosecute those involved, but money continues to be
channeled into the sector without commensurate results, and
the country is still struggling with insufficient power. The
lack of electricity for industries in Nigeria, who use it as their
major source of energy, has caused a number of industries
and factories to collapse; in northern Nigeria, many indus-
tries have closed down due to power outages. This has
reduced the availability of jobs in northern Nigeria, increas-
ing unemployment, and adversely affecting the socio-eco-
nomic structure of the region. This informant revealed that
the level of poverty and unemployment in the north has links to
the violence in the region . . . I personally have a factory, a
furniture factory for the last 25 years and when we started 1988
at Sharada industrial estate . . . I had more than 200 people
working for me at that time. Now if you go to that same industrial
area where I still have my factory there, first of all my factory is
closed . . . from staff strength of 200 staff to probably now 5 . . .
So where are those people now? They must be somewhere and
they must feed themselves. (Informant 12, personal interview,
January 28, 2012)
When large industries shut down, their now unemployed
workers have no money to buy goods, which causes smaller
businesses to fail. This eventually results in an increase in the
number of alms seekers in the street. A vivid statistic in an
official report states that Kano, only 1 of the 19 northern
States in Nigeria, had more than three million beggars in
2006 (Ndagi, 2012). Such a large number of alms beggars on
the street of an otherwise wealthy nation portend serious
danger; Awofeso, Ritchie, and Degeling (2003) concluded
that the potential for recruiting hungry children into the ranks
of militant groups is very possible.
Pinstrup-Andersen and Shimokawa (2008) argued that
"poverty, hunger and food insecurity, together with a very
unequal distribution of income and other material goods,
generate anger, hopelessness, and a sense of unfairness and
lack of social justice," and this creates an atmosphere of
tension that leads to violence (p. 513). The northeast part of
the country where the JASLWJ emerged was particularly
backward, and has suffered from various forms of inequal-
ity. For instance, Langer, Mustapha, and Stewart (2007)
8 SAGE Open
found horizontal inequality in the northeast: Maternal mor-
tality was 939% greater than the level found in the
Southwest. Moreover, the northeast is the region where in
every state an average of 74% of the population lives in
absolute poverty (see Appendix A). These types of inequal-
ities trigger violence and insurgency (Murshed & Gates,
2003). Furthermore, other forms of horizontal inequities
are evident in almost every social and economic aspect of
the region (see Appendix B: Tables B1-B5). All these ineq-
uities have been the result of bad governance that origi-
nated in the military era, and continues unabated in the
democratic era.
Conclusion
As the ongoing level of corruption in the domain of gover-
nance in Nigeria increases, the gap between the governed
and the leaders widens. There are several former state gover-
nors currently facing corruption charges for squandering
public funds. In 2013, only two governors were convicted
through a plea bargain deal with the federal investigators.
Others escape justice, like Peter Odili, the former governor
of Rivers state from southern Nigeria, to whom a court
granted a perpetual injunction, which remains in effect, to
avoid his arrest and investigation. Hence, the complete dis-
connect in the constitutional norms of governance, which is
indicative of the retrogressive attitude of the political leader-
ship in various strata of the Nigerian society. This disconnect
and the total absence of social and economic services create
a feeling of disorientation in the average citizen of the coun-
try, more especially the vulnerable ones that barely have
enough to eat. This environment facilitated the recruitment
of youths by a group that promises to bring change and solve
their problems through adherence to puritanical religious
doctrines.
This article has argued that poor governance in Nigeria
has changed the internal dynamics of the socio-political and
economic systems of the country. Political leaders, particu-
larly in northern Nigeria, are receiving revenue from sales of
crude oil every month, thereby jeopardizing other potentially
productive sectors of economic development in the region.
The near total absence of basic infrastructure, coupled with
dependence on crude oil revenue, has centralized the wealth
of the northern states in the hands of ruling elites. This has
caused pervasive corruption in public governance, thus
negating the primary objective of adhering to the basic attri-
butes of good governance as enshrined in the Nigerian
constitution.
Although JASLWJ has been known for its fundamental-
ist doctrine, this article concludes that a major reason for its
surge of activity has not been religious fervor, but the level of
social injustice that gave rise to poverty and unemployment
in the country. Curtailing the activities of the group would
require the political elites to address one deep-seated issue:
pervasive corruption. Furthermore, until and unless the
leaders recognize crude oil as a secondary source of revenue
and revitalize other existing sources of income, social and
economic justice and a sustainable economy in Nigeria will
in all probability continue to be dwarfed by corruption.

Notes
1. The sect preaches the removal of innovation in Islam and
it advocates for the strict entrenchment of the teaching of
Prophet Mohammed in practicing Islam. More on the history
of the sect can be seen in Amara (2012).
2. The interview with Ja'afar was in Hausa, a local dialect in
northern Nigeria, he revealed that Yusuf acknowledged his
mistakes and promised to correct (see "Sheik Mahmud Ja'afar
Adam Kan Mohammed Yusuf," 2011).
3. Yusuf has always voiced out his feelings about Nigerian
government in this respect. In June 2009, just few weeks
before he was killed, he delivered a sermon in Hausa lan-
guage to his followers with the title Budeddiyar wasika
zuwaga Gomnatin Tarrayyar Nigeria (open letter to the gov-
ernment of Nigeria). In it, he castigated the government and
its institutions.
4. Senior Islamic scholars in Nigeria such as Sheik Dahiru Bauchi
and Shiek Ahmad Gumi have voiced out their disapproval of
the Jama'atu Ahlis Sunna Lidda'awati wal-Jihad (JASLWJ)
approach. This is in line with the Islamic injunctions in the
holy Qur'an, which states, "There shall be no compulsion in
the religion" (Qur'an Chapter 2, verse 256). And also, "But
whoever kills a believer intentionally--his recompense is
Hell, wherein he will abide eternally, and Allah has become
angry with him and has cursed him and has prepared for him a
great punishment" (Qur'an Chapter 4, verse 93).
