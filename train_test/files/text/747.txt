Antioxidant Nutrients and Pulmonary Function: The Third National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III)
Guizhou H u ^ and Patricia A. Cassano1
Recent studies of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease have raised interest in its relation to nutrition.
Several dietary antioxidants have been positively associated with lung function in healthy, general population
samples. This study considered the separate and joint effects of vitamin C, vitamin E, p-carotene, and selenium
intake and used both dietary assessment and serum biomarkers of antioxidant status. The authors used data
from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey comprising a sample representative of the US
population in 1988-1994 (n= 18,162 subjects aged £17 years). Multiple linear regression analysis examined the
separate and joint effects of the antioxidants on the ratio of forced expiratory volume in the first second
(FEV^/height2 adjusted for covariates. Each of the dietary and serum antioxidant nutrients was significantly
associated with FEVr
When they were considered simultaneously (dietary and serum variables considered in
separate models), independent associations were observed for most nutrients. Serum p-carotene was less
positively associated with FEV, in smokers than nonsmokers, while serum selenium had a stronger positive
association with FEV, in smokers. The authors found that higher levels of antioxidant nutrients are associated
with better lung function. The finding that the antioxidants differ in both their overall association with lung function
and in whether this association varies by smoking status has implications for further research. Am J Epidemiol

Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a
major cause of death and disability in the United States
and worldwide (1, 2). Increasing evidence indicates
that COPD may be caused partly by oxidative damage
coupled with a failure of antioxidants to protect lung
tissue (3, 4). These findings suggest that antioxidant
nutrients such as vitamin C, vitamin E, P-carotene, and
selenium may protect against the risk of developing
COPD. Several published studies have reported that in
the general population, a higher dietary intake of vita-
min C and vitamin E was positively associated with
lung function, an indicator of COPD risk (5-8). In the
First National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES I) (1971-1974), dietary vitamin C
intake was inversely associated with lung function (6).
In NHANES H (1976-1980), dietary vitamin C and

serum vitamin C were both found to be inversely asso-
ciated with chronic respiratory symptoms (5).
To our knowledge, no studies to date have investi-
gated the major dietary antioxidant nutrients together,
examining the association with lung function of not
only each individual antioxidant nutrient but also the
simultaneous or joint effect of several antioxidants.
This study investigated the association of the dietary
intake of vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotene, as well as
the serum level of vitamin C, vitamin E, P-carotene,
and selenium, with lung function among adult partici-
pants of NHANES m (1988-1994).
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study population
NHANES m was conducted from 1988 through
1994 on a nationwide probability sample of approxi-
mately 33,994 persons aged 2 months or more.
Complete details of the survey design and examination
procedures have been published by the National
Center for Health Statistics (9). For this study, the sam-
ple was restricted to adult subjects aged 17 years or
more, yielding a sample size of 18,162. Among eligi-
ble adults, 1,469 (8.1 percent) were missing a value for

forced expiratory volume in the first second j
because either they were excluded from testing or the
tests were unreliable or unreproducible. An additional
2,275 (12.5 percent) subjects were excluded from
analyses of dietary data because the 24-hour recall
they provided was not representative of usual intake
(as reported by the subject).
Data collection
Trained interviewers administered a detailed socio-
economic and medical history questionnaire to each
participant. Included were standardized respiratory
symptom questions and questions about smoking
(years of smoking, current number of cigarettes
smoked per day, years since quitting, etc.) and vitamin
supplement use history (use of any vitamin supplement
in the month prior to the interview). Further measure-
ments were taken at mobile examination centers,
where subjects completed medical examinations and
provided blood samples for biochemical assays. All
subjects were asked to provide a 24-hour dietary recall
that was recorded by using the Dietary Data Collection
system (9). Food intake data were merged with the US
Department of Agriculture's survey nutrient database
to calculate nutrient intake. Serum samples were ana-
lyzed for total vitamin C by using high-performance
liquid chromatography with an electrochemical detec-
tor, and serum levels of vitamin E (a-tocopherol) and
P-carotene were measured by using isocratic high-
performance liquid chromatography with detection at
two different wavelengths (10). Serum selenium was
measured by using atomic absorption spectrophotome-
try (10).
The medical examination included spirometry
assessments that met the American Thoracic Society's
minimum recommendations (11). The spirometry sys-
tem included a customized Ohio Censored 822 or 827
dry rolling seal spirometer with breathing tubes and a
calibration syringe (9). An attached computer was pro-
grammed to analyze the expiratory curves, calculate
the key pulmonary parameters, and determine the
acceptability of the tests. Subjects were excluded from
testing if they had had chest or abdominal surgery
within the past 3 weeks or if they had a history of
myocardial infarction. Each eligible subject performed
about five trials, and reproducibility was checked
according to the recommended American Thoracic
Society standards. FEV, was recorded as the highest
value obtained from all acceptable maneuvers.
Statistical analysis
The relation of dietary or serum antioxidant nutri-
ents to FEV, was explored by using regression meth-
ods. Because of the complex, multistage probability
sample design of NHANES HI, variance estimates in
which simple random sampling is assumed are known
to be biased (9). Thus, unbiased variance estimates for
all regression coefficients were computed by using
SUDAAN software (Research Triangle Institute,
Research Triangle Park, North Carolina). The
NHANES HI study population was oversampled in
certain age groups and race groups, necessitating the
use of weighting variables to compute descriptive
information representative of the general US popula-
tion (9). The objective of this study was to explore bio-
logic relations across all major strata of the population;
thus, the use of weighting variables was less critical.
Nevertheless, subgroup analyses were explored to
ensure that the relation between diet and lung function
was approximately similar across strata defined by age
and race groups. Further analyses determined whether
the use of weighting variables in regression influenced
the results.
Preliminary analyses determined the optimal adjust-
ment for sex, age, and height, the three most important
determinants of FEV]. The height-squared propor-
tional model (FEVi/height2 = sex + age + age2) was
optimal when residuals and explained variance in
FEVj (^?2) were considered. This model remained opti-
mal when race, body mass index (weight in kilograms
divided by height in meters squared), and income
index were added.
A second preliminary step was to find the best rep-
resentation of cigarette smoking. Smoking is associ-
ated with both dietary and serum antioxidant levels,
and it has well-known effects on FEV]. Thus, cigarette
smoking is an important confounding variable when
assessing the association of dietary or serum antioxi-
dants with FEV,. The number of cigarettes currently
smoked per day was used to assess current smoking
exposure. Cumulative smoking exposure was assessed
by determining pack-years (the product of the number
of packs smoked per day and the number of years of
smoking), smoking duration (the number of years of
smoking), and the number of years since quitting (for
former smokers). Model development considered non-
linear terms for each variable, nonlinear calculation of
pack-years (e.g., the square of the number of packs
smoked per day multiplied by the number of years of
smoking), and dummy variable coding to represent
current smoking and former smoking. The final repre-
sentation of cigarette smoking was chosen to maxi-
mize the variance in FEV, explained by smoking.
The relation of each dietary antioxidant or each
serum antioxidant to FEV] was examined separately
and then simultaneously, but dietary and serum mea-
surements were always considered in separate models.

Antioxidant Nutrients and Lung Function 977
Given prior interest in whether the effect of antioxi-
dant nutrients on lung function differs according to
smoking status, the relation of each antioxidant to lung
function also was examined by stratifying on smoking
status.
RESULTS
The average age of subjects included in the analysis
was 46 years, and 47 percent were male (table 1).
Subjects excluded because of missing lung function
data were, on average, older and more likely to have a
prevalent respiratory condition. Excluded subjects
were also more likely to be former smokers and to use
vitamin supplements, behaviors that may partly be
explained by age. While such exclusions may have
reduced the representativeness of the sample, they did
not affect the internal validity of the findings.
The baseline height-squared proportional regression
model included the covariates sex, age, age2, race,
body mass index, and income, as well as several smok-
ing variables. The associations of these variables with
FEV, (data not shown) were consistent with previous
reports (12). Antioxidant nutrient status was assessed
in two ways, by using a 24-hour dietary recall and by
bioassay of serum samples. The dietary recall may best
reflect short-term intake and may be subject to mis-
classification caused by day-to-day variation in intake
and by other sources of measurement error (13). The
serum nutrient level is more likely to reflect long-term
nutrient status and nutrient bioavailability, but it may
be subject to physiologic homeostatic regulation.
Dietary antloxidants
The first series of models was used to consider each
dietary antioxidant nutrient separately while adjusting
for total caloric intake (table 2). Vitamin C, vitamin E,
and total carotene all were positively associated with
FEVj. Dietary fat intake also was adjusted in models
in which vitamin E was considered, because fat intake
is related to both vitamin E intake and lung function;
therefore, it is a potentially confounding variable. The
increase in FEV, (given a height of 1.70 m) for one
standard deviation increase in dietary vitamin C, vita-
min E, and carotene was 9.5,16.4, and 18.2 ml, respec-
tively. When all three dietary antioxidants were con-
sidered simultaneously, the increase in FEV, for one
standard deviation increase in all three antioxidants
was 24.6 ml. Thus, the combined effect was higher
than the effect of any single dietary component con-
sidered alone but was not as high as the simple sum of
the separate effects. In this analysis, a standard devia-
tion increase in vitamin C, vitamin E, and carotene
intake referred to an increase of 111 mg/day (e.g.,
about one and one-half cups (355 ml) of orange juice

one-half cup (118 ml) of sunflower seeds with hulls
(14)), and 1,017 retinol equivalents/day (e.g., about
one raw carrot (14)), respectively. Correlation among
these nutrients (correlation coefficient, r = 0.4-0.6)
because of their common food sources probably led to
a reduction in the coefficients in the simultaneous
model, and only the coefficient for carotene remained
statistically significant.
Stratified analyses were used to explore whether the
positive effect of the dietary antioxidants on lung func-
tion differed according to smoking status. The associ-
ation of each nutrient with FEV] was found to vary
somewhat based on smoking status, but these differ-
ences were generally not statistically significant. For
carotene, the association of dietary intake with FEV!
varied by smoking status (p = 0.07 for the addition of
the interaction term to the regression model). Among
current smokers, the relation of carotene intake to
FEV, was weaker when compared with the relation
among nonsmokers and former smokers (table 2).

Serum antioxidant status was considered in regres-
sion models that examined each antioxidant separately
(vitamin C, vitamin E, (3-carotene, and selenium) and
then all antioxidants simultaneously (table 3). All mod-
els were adjusted for the same covariates listed above

for dietary antioxidants, and serum total cholesterol and
triglycerides were adjusted in models considering vita-
min E and P-carotene (two fat-soluble vitamins trans-
ported in serum lipid). For a person 1.7 m tall, an
increase of one standard deviation in serum vitamin C,
vitamin E, p-carotene, and selenium was associated
with an increase of 28.1, 49.1, 27.5, and 23.7 ml in
FEV,, respectively. In a single model that considered
the simultaneous effect of all four serum antioxidants,
all four constituents retained an independent associa-
tion with lung function (table 3). An increase of one
standard deviation in all four components was associ-
ated with an increase of 93.7 ml in FEV,. The joint
effect of 93.7 ml was slightly less than a simple addi-
tive effect (expected 128.5 ml) because of shared vari-
ance among the serum measurements of antioxidant
status. The simple correlations among serum measures
ranged from 0.3 to 0.4 for vitamins C and E and for P-
carotene but were lower for selenium (0.03, 0.15, and
0.01 for selenium with vitamin C, vitamin E, and p-
carotene, respectively). A 94 ml difference in FEV, is
about equivalent to the difference between people
approximately 4 years apart in age (given that with
each year of aging, FEV, declines by about 24 ml).
The potential modification of these effects by ciga-
rette smoking was explored. While the association of
serum vitamin C with FEV, was about the same
across smoking strata, the association of serum vita-
min E was weaker for former smokers (p -- 0.01). The
association of P-carotene was weaker (p -- 0.03) and
that of selenium was stronger (p = 0.01) for current
smokers compared with nonsmokers and former
smokers (table 3). Current smokers were further clas-
sified as light or heavy smokers, and the association
of P-carotene and selenium with FEV, was examined.
The association of serum P-carotene decreased as the
amount of smoking increased. An increase of one
standard deviation in serum P-carotene was associated
with an increase in FEV, of 17.6 and 2.9 ml, respec-
tively, for light and heavy current smokers. The asso-
ciation of serum selenium with lung function showed
little or no difference according to current smoking
dose. An increase of one standard deviation in serum
selenium was associated with an increase in FEVj of
40.2 and 38.8 ml, respectively, for light and heavy
current smokers (table 3).
Thirty-six percent of the study population reported
using some form of vitamin supplement in the month
before the study. There was little or no difference in
FEV, between subjects who used supplements and
those who did not. Further analysis of the effect of spe-
cific vitamin supplements was not possible because of
a lack of information on the specific kind of vitamin
used and the dose taken.
All results shown in this paper were derived from
regression models in which SUDAAN software was
used to compute correct variance estimates. The
results were robust and were essentially unchanged in
models that included the weighting variables or in
mixed models (PROC MIXED software; SAS
Institute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) that included a
random effect for place (primary sampling unit and
strata combine to yield 98 "places" sampled in
NHANESm).
DISCUSSION
This study examined the association of all major
antioxidants, measured by dietary intake and by serum
level, with lung function in a representative sample of
the US population. Each serum antioxidant was inde-
pendently associated with lung function when the four
constituents were considered jointly. The joint effect of
the dietary intake of the antioxidants was higher than
when any single component was considered separately,
although dietary intake of only carotene remained sta-
tistically significant. Dietary intake of vitamin C, vita-
min E, and carotene was highly correlated in part
because some of the food sources of the antioxidants
are similar. This fact, coupled with the greater potential
for measurement error in the dietary assessment, may
explain the lack of an independent association when the
dietary components were considered simultaneously.
A strength of this study was the availability of bio-
markers of nutritional status. Some nutrients, notably
selenium, are not well assessed by dietary intake meth-
ods that use food composition tables that rely on a con-
stant quantity of the nutrient in foods (13). In addition,
a single 24-hour recall provides inadequate information
about usual intake (13), and the biomarkers of nutri-
tional status comprise exposure data that are somewhat
more time integrated although also subject to limita-
tions depending on the nutrient under consideration.
Different antioxidants may have different pathophys-
iologic ways of protecting lung tissue against oxidant-
induced damage. While vitamin C is responsible for
maintaining the antioxidant capacity in the aqueous
phase of the cell, such as cytoplasm (15), vitamin E is
a major scavenger of free radicals in the lipid phase,
such as in cell membranes (16). The antioxidant prop-
erty of p-carotene depends on the oxygen pressure in
the microenvironment of the cell (17). Selenium is a
cofactor for glutathione peroxidase, an important
antioxidant enzyme (18).
Since the antioxidants may operate via different
mechanisms, it follows that the antioxidants consid-
ered here may exhibit different effects across cate-
gories of smoking. The magnitude of the association of
serum vitamin C with FEV, was about the same in the
Am J Epidemiol Vol. 151, No. 10, 2000
980 Hu and Cassano
three smoking groups. The magnitude of the associa-
tion of P-carotene with lung function was weaker
among current smokers and weaker still as the smok-
ing dose increased, and this finding was consistent
across dietary and serum data. The association of sele-
nium with lung function was stronger among current
smokers compared with former smokers and non-
smokers but did not vary according to smoking dose.
Why does the association of a particular antioxidant
vary by smoking status? Each antioxidant is purported
to be positively associated with lung function because
of its ability to neutralize oxidants that would other-
wise damage tissue. Nonsmokers have some body bur-
den of oxidants, which might be described as general
oxidants. Smokers have a body burden of oxidants
comprised of these same general oxidants and oxidants
in cigarette smoke. At least two scenarios might exist
that would be consistent with the findings reported
here. First, some antioxidants may be more efficient
than others in neutralizing general versus cigarette
smoke oxidants. Second, the efficiency of an antioxi-
dant may vary depending on the level of oxidant bur-
den; that is, some antioxidants may have a stronger
effect when the burden of oxidants is high. Either of
these scenarios is consistent with the finding that the
strength of the association of an antioxidant with lung
function varies across smoking categories.
Serum P-carotene had less of a positive association
with lung function among current smokers, and the
positive effect decreased further as smoking dose
increased. Thus, the effect of p-carotene may decrease
as the total quantity of oxidants increases, p-carotene
may be less efficient in neutralizing cigarette smoke
versus general oxidants, or both. A recent study
reported that rather than protecting cigarette smokers
from developing lung cancer, P-carotene increased the
risk (19). Similarly, P-carotene and/or a-tocopherol
supplementation has been found to have little or no
association with the incidence or recurrence of respira-
tory symptoms in cigarette smokers (20). While the
association of serum selenium with FEVf
was stronger
among current smokers, there was no evidence of a
dose-response relation. Thus, selenium may be more
efficient in neutralizing cigarette smoke than general
oxidants, but its efficiency may not depend on the
amount of oxidant exposure.
The association of P-carotene and selenium with
FEV, among former smokers was similar to that
among nonsmokers rather than intermediate between
current smokers and nonsmokers. This finding might
have occurred because the average number of years
since quitting was about 15, making former smokers
far more similar to nonsmokers than to smokers, hi
addition, current antioxidant status might not have
been a good reflection of antioxidant status when for-
mer smokers did smoke; thus, a differential effect of
antioxidant status on lung function would not have
been observed.
The results of the present study confirm and extend
several previous reports suggesting that antioxidant
nutrients are related to lung function. In NHANES I, a
higher intake of vitamin C was associated with
increased FEV! (6). In NHANES H, self-reported
chronic respiratory symptoms were associated with
lower dietary vitamin C intake and with lower serum
levels of vitamin C (5). Among 2,633 randomly
selected adult subjects in Great Britain, higher dietary
intakes of vitamin C and vitamin E were related to
higher FEV,; when vitamin C and vitamin E were con-
sidered simultaneously, only vitamin C retained an
independent association (7). In a small study of elderly
subjects (n = 178, aged 70-96 years), dietary vitamin
E was positively associated with FEV, (8). In a study
of rural Chinese subjects (n = 3,085, aged 35-65
years), dietary vitamin C intake estimated by house-
hold food record was positively associated with FEV,
(21).
NHANES HI data are cross-sectional, and antioxi-
dant status was assessed at a single point in time and
was measured at the same time as lung function. The
hypothesis that antioxidants are related to better lung
health posits an association of long-term antioxidant
nutrient level with lung function, although the exact
timing of dietary pattern in relation to lung function
has not been well specified. Therefore, the relevance
of the present analysis to the hypothesis is based on the
assumption that current antioxidant levels represent
usual long-term, average levels.
NHANES III contains extensive data to characterize
smoking, an important confounding variable in these
analyses since it may be related to lower intake of
antioxidants, differences in the metabolism of antioxi-
dants, and clearly to lower levels of lung function. In
models that did not adjust for smoking, the crude pre-
dicted difference in FEV, associated with one standard
deviation increase in serum vitamin C, vitamin E, P-
carotene, and selenium was 33.8, 45.0, 31.3, and 34.0
ml, respectively. Thus, adjustment for smoking was a
critical component of these analyses, and while resid-
ual confounding by smoking cannot be ruled out, eight
variables were used to capture the variation in FEV,
explained by smoking. It is important to note that the
consistent associations found for nonsmokers could
not be explained by residual confounding by smoking.
In analyses limited to smokers, residual confounding
by qualitative aspects of smoking (e.g., dose, depth of
inhalation, and other smoking behaviors) may be pres-
ent. While residual confounding cannot explain the

finding that the association of (3-carotene was weaker
for current smokers, we cannot exclude the possibility
that for current smokers, the stronger association
observed between selenium and FEVj was caused by
residual confounding. Residual confounding by other
factors, such as socioeconomic status, is not likely to
have been important since analyses with and without
adjustment for these factors (data not shown) showed
little or no differences in the coefficients for the rela-
tion of nutrients to lung function.
The findings reported here are probably unique in
that four of the major dietary antioxidants were con-
sidered, antioxidant status was measured by using both
dietary assessment and bioassay of serum samples, and
all antioxidants were associated with FEVl
after
adjustment for smoking and other covariates. The
study provides evidence to support the hypothesis that
several antioxidants are associated with better lung
function, but the cross-sectional design of NHANES
HI precludes causal inference. It also provides evi-
dence that the positive association of antioxidants with
lung function differs according to smoking status, and
these findings merit further investigation in prospec-
tive studies of lung disease.
