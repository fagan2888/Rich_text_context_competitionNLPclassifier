ABSTRACT: Low or high hematocrit levels are associated with
increased morbidity and mortality, mediated via anemia or thrombo-
embolic events, respectively. It is therefore important to identify
factors that influence hematocrit. Although androgens are known to
stimulate hematopoietic cells, it is unknown whether circulating sex
steroid hormones affect hematocrit. The association between serum
sex steroid hormone concentrations and hematocrit in men aged
$20 years was evaluated in a cross-sectional study of 1273 men in
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988­
1991). Outcomes were low (,10th percentile), high (.90th
percentile), and mean hematocrit. Men with low free testosterone
levels had a lower hematocrit than men with normal free testosterone
levels (P 5 .03), although no relationship was found between total
testosterone level and hematocrit. The relationship between sex
hormone­binding globulin (SHBG) and hematocrit was complex, with
both low (P , .001) and high (P 5 .01) SHBG levels associated with
lower hematocrit in men aged $20 years and only high (P 5 .01)
SHBG levels in men aged $50 years. The odds ratio (OR) of high vs
normal hematocrit increased as total estradiol (OR, 2.84; P trend 5
.04) and free estradiol (OR, 2.23; P trend 5 .09) levels increased. In
this nationally representative study of men, sex steroid hormone
levels, particularly low free testosterone and high SHBG levels, were
associated with lower hematocrit, and high total and free estradiol
levels were associated with high hematocrit. Thus, changes in sex
hormone levels with aging may contribute to the increased
prevalence of anemia and thromboembolic stroke in men as they
age.

Both low and high levels of hematocrit have been
observed to be associated with adverse health
outcomes. Specifically, anemia, defined as low hemo-
globin (,13 g/dL), is associated with an increased risk of
falls and fractures, cognitive impairment, mortality, and
decreased physical ability (Penninx, 2007). Anemic men
older than 85 years had more than twice the risk of
death than men without anemia (Izaks et al, 1999). In
the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Study (NHANES III), a nationally representative
sample of Americans, anemia was present in 11% of
men older than age 65 years (Guralnik et al, 2004).
Among hospitalized older patients, the prevalence of
anemia is even higher (24% to 40%) (Joosten et al, 1992;
Smieja et al, 1996). High hematocrit was associated with
an increased risk of death from cardiovascular disease in
both the Honolulu Heart Program (Carter et al, 1983)
and Framingham Heart Study (Gagnon et al, 1994). In
addition, in disease states with elevated red cell mass, as
in polycythemia vera, the prevalence of thrombosis
ranges from 12% to 39% (Elliott and Tefferi, 2005).
It is unknown why anemia is so common in elderly
men. Changes in sex steroid hormone levels with age
may alter hematocrit and could contribute to this
finding. It is well documented that with increasing age,
serum testosterone concentrations decline in men and
the prevalence of clinically low testosterone levels
increases (Harman et al, 2001). There is some evidence
that suggests that androgens raise hematocrit. For
example, hemoglobin levels rise in boys during puberty
(Garn et al, 1981) and with pharmacological doses of
androgens in patients with hypogonadism (Tenover,
1992; Sih et al, 1997; Saad et al, 2007), whereas
This is the 12th study from the Hormone Demonstration Program,
which is supported by the Maryland Cigarette Restitution Fund at
Johns Hopkins.

hemoglobin levels decline with chemical or surgical
castration (Weber et al, 1991; Fonseca et al, 1998).
Additionally, previous research has shown that men older
than 65 years with low testosterone levels have a higher
risk of anemia (Ferrucci et al, 2006). However, these
studies have focused on select populations (eg, pubescent,
hypogonadal, castrated, and elderly men), effectively
assessing the association among men with very high or
low levels of testosterone. Estrogen levels also decline
with age in men, although not to the same extent as
testosterone levels (Orwoll et al, 2006). There is no known
mechanism by which estradiol directly increases hemat-
ocrit; however, estradiol may blunt the effects of hypoxia-
induced erythropoietin expression (Mukundan et al,
2002). In addition, men have higher age-matched hemo-
globin concentrations than women at particular altitudes;
this effect is seen after puberty but is not evident at
postmenopausal ages (Leon-Velarde et al, 2000).
We hypothesized that sex steroid hormone levels in
men, in both diseased and healthy populations, are
associated with hematocrit levels, leading to alterations in
risk of clinical and subclinical disease, respectively
(Figure). In this study, we evaluated the association
of serum levels of testosterone, estradiol, and their
main binding globulin, sex hormone­binding globulin
(SHBG) with hematocrit across the full male adult age
range using data from a national population-based study.
Materials and Methods
Study Population
NHANES III, a cross-sectional study of the US population
aged $2 months, was conducted between 1988 and 1994 by the
National Center for Health Statistics. NHANES III used a
multistage, stratified, clustered probability sample with over-
sampling of Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic African Amer-
icans, and older Americans to ensure an adequate sample size
for generating prevalence estimates for these groups. In total,
33 944 people participated, of which 14 781 were male. The
protocols for the conduct of NHANES III were approved by
the institutional review board of the National Center for Health
Statistics, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.
Informed consent was obtained from all participants. The assay
of these stored serum specimens for sex steroid hormones was
approved by institutional review boards at the Johns Hopkins
Bloomberg School of Public Health and the National Center for
Health Statistics, US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention.

NHANES III was conducted in 2 phases (1988­1991 and
1991­1994). Participants were randomly assigned to morning
or afternoon examination sessions. Unbiased national esti-
mates of health and nutrition characteristics can be generated
when using either phase and the morning or afternoon
sessions. For our analysis, 2205 men aged $20 years who
attended the morning examination session of the first phase
were eligible for inclusion. We selected the morning session to
decrease the variance due to diurnal sex hormone production.
The NHANES III repository held serum from 1470 of these
men. We excluded men with a self-reported history of cancer (n
5 40); missing testosterone, estradiol, or SHBG concentra-
tions (n 5 21); missing data on hematocrit (n 5 26); and
missing data on percent body fat, physical activity, smoking
status, or number of cigarettes smoked per day (n5110),
leaving a final study population of 1273 men.
Measurement of Hematocrit
Detailed documentation of the laboratory methods used to
measure hematocrit in NHANES III has been published
(Gunter, 1996). Whole blood was collected in tubes containing
EDTA, and a complete blood count was performed (Gunter,
1996). Hematocrit was calculated using a Coulter S-Plus Jr
electronic counter (Coulter Electronics, Hialeah, Florida)
(Gunter, 1996).
Sex Steroid Hormones
Sex steroid hormone concentrations were measured in blood
samples that were centrifuged, aliquoted, and subsequently stored
at 270uC in Dr Nader Rifai's laboratory (Children's Hospital,
Boston, Massachusetts). Competitive electrochemiluminescence
immunoassays were performed on a 2010 Elecsys autoanalyzer
(Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, Indiana) to measure serum
concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, and SHBG. Laboratory
technicians were blinded to sample identifiers and participant
characteristics. The lowest detection limits of the assay were
testosterone, 20 ng/dL; estradiol, 5 pg/mL; and SHBG, 3 nmol/L.
Coefficients of variation for quality control specimens were
testosterone, 5.9% and 5.8% at 2.5 and 5.5 mg/L, respectively;
estradiol, 6.5% and 6.7% at 102.7 and 474.1 mg/L, respectively;
and SHBG, 5.3% and 5.9% at 5.3 and 16.6 nmol/L, respectively.
In a separate quality control sample run for this study, the
interassay coefficient of variation was 2.5% for an estradiol
concentration of 39.4 pg/mL, which is in the range of typical male
estradiol concentrations. Serum hormone concentrations detected
in the men in NHANES III were generally within the range of
reference values used for men (testosterone, 194­833 ng/dL;
estradiol, #50 pg/mL [Beers et al, 2006]; and SHBG, 13­71 nmol/
L [Fauci et al, 2008]). Serum total testosterone, total estradiol,
SHBG, and albumin concentrations were used to estimate free
testosterone and free estradiol levels with mass action equations
(Vermeulen et al, 1999; Rinaldi et al, 2002).
Assessment of Covariates
Covariates considered in the analysis were those known to
influence either hormone concentrations or hematocrit.
Participants in NHANES III provided information on age,
race/ethnicity, smoking status, number of cigarettes smoked
per day, and physical activity. A standardized method was
used to code and classify each type of physical activity by rate
of energy expenditure (Ainsworth et al, 1993; Rohrmann et al,
2005). Weekly frequency of moderate and vigorous walking,
jogging, or running; biking; swimming; aerobics; dancing;
calisthenics; gardening; and lifting weights was measured.
Other physical activities were considered to be at the
moderate level if they met age-specific cutoffs of the
metabolic equivalent (MET) of the activity when compared
with rest: $3 METs for ages 20 to 39 years; $2.5 METs for
ages 40 to 64 years; $2.0 METs for ages 65 to 79 years, and
$1.26 METs for ages $79 years. Levels of moderate physical
activities were categorized as follows: 0, 0 to 4.7, and $4.8
times/week. Additionally, those who were able to walk 1 mile
without stopping, irrespective of whether the intent was
exercise, were categorized as being physically active (.0
times/week). Percent body fat was calculated from bioelectric
impedance, height, and weight measurements using previously
published formulas (Plan and operation of the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, 1994; Chumlea
et al, 2002). A trained examiner measured height and weight.
Bioelectrical impedance was estimated using a 1990B Bio-
Resistance body composition analyzer (Valhalla Scientific,
San Diego, California).
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using SUDAAN (Research
Triangle Park, North Carolina) as implemented in SAS version
9.1 (Cary, North Carolina) software. In each analysis, we
applied sampling weights. Those in the highest 10th percentile
of hematocrit ($47.7%) were categorized as having high
hematocrit, those in the lowest 10th percentile of hematocrit
(,41.0%) were categorized as having low hematocrit, and
those with hematocrit between 41.0% and 47.6% were
categorized as having normal hematocrit. Select participant
characteristics were compared among those with low, normal,
and high hematocrits. Both crude and age-adjusted means and
proportions were calculated.
Total testosterone, total estradiol, SHBG, free testosterone,
and free estradiol levels were categorized into tertiles based on
the distributions among all men included in the analysis.
Multivariable logistic regression was used to estimate the odds
ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals of low hematocrit
compared with normal hematocrit and high hematocrit
compared with normal hematocrit by tertile of hormone
concentrations, with the lowest hormone tertile as the
reference group. The models were adjusted for age, race/
ethnicity, smoking status (current, former, never) and number
of cigarettes smoked per day by current smokers, physical
activity, percent body fat, and other hormone levels (tertiles of
total estradiol, total testosterone, and SHBG levels were
simultaneously included in a model, free testosterone was
adjusted for tertiles of total estradiol, and free estradiol was
adjusted for tertiles of total testosterone).
The mean hematocrit levels of men with low and high
concentrations of testosterone, estradiol, SHBG, free testos-
terone, and free estradiol were compared with the mean
1334 Journal of Andrology N NovemberÙDecember 2012
hematocrit levels of men with normal concentrations of these
hormones. Cut points for low hormone concentrations were
based on either clinical cut points or the 10th percentile of
the distribution: total testosterone, ,250 ng/dL (Greenspan,
1994); total estradiol, ,20 pg/mL (Greenspan, 1994); SHBG,
,13 nmol/L (Bukowski et al, 2000); free testosterone, ,5 ng/
dL (Greenspan, 1994); and free estradiol, ,0.59 pg/mL (,10th
percentile). The cut points for high hormone concentrations
were defined as $90th percentile as follows: total testosterone,
$800 ng/dL; total estradiol, $50.0 pg/mL; SHBG, $66 nmol/
L; free testosterone, $160 ng/dL; and free estradiol, $1.37 pg/
mL. Multivariable linear regression was used to estimate mean
hematocrit concentrations, adjusted for age, race/ethnicity,
percent body fat, current smoking status and number of
cigarettes smoked per day by current smokers, and frequency
of physical activity and mutually adjusted for other hormones.
A subanalysis was carried out, restricting the analysis to men
aged $50 years because these men were more likely to have
lower testosterone, estradiol, and hematocrit levels.
We repeated the analysis excluding men with chronic kidney
disease (CKD) because this condition is a common cause of
anemia and then further stratified by the presence or absence
of major chronic diseases to assess whether prevalent disease
explained the association between hormones and hematocrit
(ie, reverse causation) based on our hypothesis in the Figure.
We considered prevalent chronic disease to be a history of
diabetes, emphysema, chronic bronchitis, stroke, myocardial
infarction, or congestive heart failure.
Results
Selected characteristics of this study population are
shown in Table 1. After age adjustment, the mean
hematocrits in those with low, normal, and high levels
were 39.3%, 44.3%, and 48.9%, respectively. The mean
age was 41.5 years. Men with low hematocrits were
significantly older (51.3 years) than those with normal
hematocrits (40.5 years), and men with high hematocrits
were significantly younger (39.4 years) than those with
normal hematocrits (P , .05). After adjustment for age,
men with low hematocrits were more likely to be non-
Hispanic African American and less likely to be non-
Hispanic white or Mexican American than those with
normal hematocrits (P , .05). There was no difference
in percent body fat by hematocrit category. Men with
high hematocrits were more likely to be current
smokers, in agreement with prior analyses (Whitehead
et al, 1995). After age adjustment, those with high
hematocrits were less likely to be physically active than
those with normal hematocrits (P , .05), consistent with
previous findings (Wannamethee et al, 2002).
Table 2 presents ORs of low (,41%) and high
hematocrits ($47.7%) across tertiles of total and free
estradiol, total and free testosterone, and SHBG levels
after multivariable adjustment. Men with concentra-
tions of total estradiol in the highest tertile had almost 3
times the odds of high hematocrit (OR, 2.84; 95%
confidence intervals, 1.05, 7.66; P trend 5 .04) than men
in the lowest tertile. The odds of high hematocrit also
increased with increasing tertiles of free estradiol level (P
trend 5 .09). Although not statistically significant, there
was a suggestion that men in the highest tertiles of total
and free testosterone and total estradiol levels had
decreased odds of low hematocrit (Table 2).
We repeated these analyses excluding men with CKD,
and the results were similar (see Supplemental Table,
available online at www.andrologyjournal.org). When
we excluded men with CKD and then stratified by
prevalent chronic disease, the associations of total (P
trend 5 .04) and free estradiol (P trend 5 .07) levels
with high hematocrit in men without prevalent chronic
disease were similar to the overall findings, whereas
these associations were not present in men with
prevalent chronic diseases (Table 3).
Mean hematocrit did not differ in men who had low,
normal, or high total testosterone concentrations
(Table 4). However, men with low free testosterone
concentrations had a lower hematocrit (43.6%) com-
pared with men in the normal range of free testosterone
(44.3%; P 5 .03); the finding was similar when the
analysis was restricted to men aged $50 years (42.4% vs
43.7%, respectively; P 5 .008). Hematocrit levels were
significantly lower in men with both low SHBG
(hematocrit, 41.4%; P , .001) and high SHBG (hemat-
ocrit, 43.8%; P 5 .01) levels as compared with normal
SHBG levels (hematocrit, 44.4%). For men aged
$50 years, those with high SHBG concentrations had
lower hematocrits than men with normal SHBG levels
(42.7% vs 43.8%; P 5 .01) (Table 4).
Table 5 summarizes the most important findings in
this manuscript.
Discussion
Both low and high hematocrit levels have detrimental
health effects. Increased mortality has been documented
in patients with anemia, as well as those with
erythrocytosis, which may increase predilection for
thrombosis through multiple mechanisms (Gagnon et
al, 1994; Izaks et al, 1999; Elliott and Tefferi, 2005;
Penninx, 2007). Thus, it is important to identify
predictors of both high and low levels of hematocrit
among men. In this nationally representative sample of
men, we found that men with clinically low free
testosterone levels had lower hematocrits than men with
the normal range of free testosterone. We also observed
that high total and free estradiol concentrations were
associated with high hematocrit. In addition, both low
Paller et al N Sex Steroid Hormones and Hematocrit 1335
and high SHBG levels were associated with low
hematocrit; the association between high SHBG level
and low hematocrit was similar when the analysis was
restricted to men aged $50 years, whereas the associ-
ation between low SHBG level and hematocrit was
nonsignificant. Although the observed differences in
hematocrit were often small (1% to 3%), they were
statistically significant, and changes of as little as 2% in
hematocrit have been shown to be associated with
significant increases ($20%) in the frequency of major
ischemic heart disease events (Carter et al, 1983;
Wannamethee et al, 1994).
Our finding that men with clinically low concentra-
tions of free testosterone (,5 ng/dL) had significantly
lower hematocrits than those with free testosterone in
the normal range is compatible with findings in clinical
studies that consistently show an association between
low total testosterone level, via surgical or chemical
depletion, and low hematocrit (Weber et al, 1991;
Fonseca et al, 1998). Our findings are also consistent
with those of Ferrucci et al (2006), who in the Tuscany
InCHIANTI study of men aged $65 years, found that
those with low total and bioavailable testosterone
concentrations had a higher odd of anemia as assessed
by hemoglobin and that men with low baseline
bioavailable testosterone had an increased risk of
developing anemia. In that study, men with lower total
testosterone levels had 5 times the odds of anemia than

those with higher total testosterone levels and those
with lower free testosterone levels had 13 times the
odds of anemia than those with higher free testosterone
levels. The smaller OR for total testosterone levels seen
by Ferrucci et al (2006) and the lack of significant effect
of lower total testosterone levels in our study could be
explained by the high variability of older men in SHBG
and albumin levels, both of which have strong effects
on the bioactive portion of total testosterone. With
respect to men aged $50 years in our analysis, low free
testosterone levels were also associated with a lower
hematocrit. The stronger associations observed in the
InCHIANTI study than in our study may be due to the
older age and thus lower testosterone levels of the men.
Unlike clinical studies in which pharmacological doses
of exogenous testosterone were administered, resulting
in an elevated hematocrit (Tenover, 1992; Sih et al,
1997; Snyder et al, 2000; Saad et al, 2007), we did not
observe an increased risk of high hematocrit levels in
the highest free or total testosterone tertiles. Similar to
our analysis, Yeap et al (2009) explored a cross-
sectional analysis of 492 men from Australia aged 30
to 94 years and found that overall, hemoglobin and
SHBG levels were inversely correlated. In addition, free
testosterone levels were associated with hemoglobin
levels, consistent with our findings (Yeap et al, 2009).
We hypothesized that androgens would be associated
with hematocrit because they are known to activate
hematopoietic stem cells and stimulate erythropoietin
production, thereby regulating hematopoiesis (Besa,
1994). We did not have a hypothesis about the asso-
ciation between estradiol and hematocrit because to
our knowledge, there is no direct mechanistic link
between estradiol and erythropoiesis. Yet, we found
that men with higher concentrations of total and free
estradiol were less likely to have low hematocrits and
more likely to have high hematocrits, even after adjust-
ments for total testosterone level and percent body fat.
We adjusted for testosterone, which is converted to
estradiol via catalysis by aromatase in fat, to be able to
determine the independent association for estradiol.
Our results for estradiol are compatible with a clinical
study of testosterone supplementation in hypogonadal
men that found that 12 of 14 men with an elevated
hematocrit also had elevated estradiol levels (Dobs et
al, 1999). As previously mentioned, estradiol blunts the
effects of hypoxia on erythropoietin production in
women but has unclear significance in men and would
not explain our findings; thus, another possibility is
that these findings occurred by chance.

The relationship between SHBG and hematocrit
appears to be complex. Consistent with a prior Japanese
study of men aged 52 to 74 years (Kato et al, 1992),
in our study, high SHBG levels were associated with
lower hematocrit levels overall and among men aged
$50 years. The finding that low SHBG concentrations
were associated with lower hematocrit in our overall
study population is a novel finding to our knowledge.
There is no known mechanism for this finding; however,
the different trends seen with age could relate to the fact
that SHBG starts to rise in the fourth and fifth decades
in men (Feldman et al, 2002) and steroid negative
feedback is known to change as men age (Winters and
Wang, 2009). In addition, the association between
SHBG and hematocrit could be affected by confounding
disease states such as liver disease.
Based on previous analysis of the NHANES III data,
anemia appears to be related to a deficiency in iron,
vitamin B12
, and/or folate in one-third of cases, renal
insufficiency in one-third, and unexplained anemia in
the remaining third of patients (Guralnik et al, 2004).
Although renal insufficiency is a known cause of low
erythropoietin production, in multivariable-adjusted
models, the odds of a glomerular filtration rate
,60 mL/min/1.73 m2 did not change with tertiles of
hormones with the exception of high free estradiol levels
having 3 times the odds of a decreased glomerular
filtration rate (Yi et al, 2009). In sensitivity analyses, we
excluded men with chronic kidney disease and the result
was not remarkably changed (see Supplemental Table).
In healthy men, altered hematocrit may mediate the
association between hormones and health outcomes;
however, in men with chronic disease, the disease may
alter both hematocrit and hormone levels. Thus, we
stratified by the presence of major chronic disease. In
men without prevalent chronic disease, the association
between high estradiol levels and high hematocrit was
similar to that of the main analysis; however, in the men
with prevalent chronic disease, no associations were
observed between any of the hormone levels and
hematocrit. Thus, there was no evidence supporting
our hypothesis that disease status will alter both
hematocrit and hormone levels; however, we could not
take into account the duration or severity of these
diseases or the nature or success of the treatments for
these diseases.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine
the association between sex steroid hormones and
hematocrit in a large, nationally representative sample
of the US adult male population. The men in this study
were aged $20 years, allowing the association between
hormones and hematocrit to be evaluated in an age
range wider than that in previous studies of older men.
Similarly, this analysis benefited from the standardized
measurement of demographic characteristics, anthropo-
metric measures, and laboratory analytes. The large
sample size and resulting power of the NHANES III
analysis provided us with a unique opportunity to detect
small differences even after adjustment for relevant
covariates, including measures of smoking. Analyses of
hemoglobin showed results similar to those for hemat-
ocrit (data not shown). However, the study was limited
by insufficient power involving men with prevalent
disease (Table 3) and men aged .50 years (Table 4). An
important limitation of our study is that the cross-
sectional design did not allow for discerning the
temporality of the observed associations of sex steroid
hormones and SHBG with hematocrit.
In this nationally representative study of men, sex
steroid hormones, in particular total and free estradiol,
free testosterone, and SHBG, appeared to influence
hematocrit levels. Although causal relationships cannot
be determined from our analysis, future studies should
be conducted to address whether it might be beneficial
to treat older men who have low circulating testoster-
one, estradiol, or SHBG levels to increase hematocrit
levels and general well-being.
