Background: Use of opioids for chronic noncancer pain
is increasing, but standards of care for this practice are
poorly defined. Psychiatric disorders are associated with
increased physical symptoms such as pain and may be
associated with opioid use, but no prospective population-
based studies have addressed this issue.
Methods: Analysis of longitudinal data from 6439 par-
ticipants in the 1998 and 2001 waves of Healthcare for
Communities, a nationally representative telephone com-
munity survey.
Results: Two hundred thirty-seven subjects (3.6%) re-
ported regular prescription opioid use in 2001. In un-
adjusted logistic regression models, respondents with a
common mental health disorder in 1998 (1165 [12.6%];
major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disor-
der, or panic disorder) were more likely to report opi-
oid use in 2001 than those without any of these disor-
ders (odds ratio [OR],4.43; 95% confidence interval
[CI],3.64-5.38; P.001). Risk was increased for initia-
tion (OR,3.26; 95% CI, 2.44-4.34; P.001) and con-
tinuation (OR,2.30; 95% CI,1.02-5.17; P=.04) of opi-
oids. Respondents reporting problem drug use (136
[2.0%]; OR,3.57; 95% CI,2.32-5.50; P.001) but not
problem alcohol use (401 [6.5%]; OR,0.73; 95% CI,0.43-
1.24; P=.25) reported higher rates of prescribed opioid
use than those without problem use. In multivariate lo-
gistic regression models controlling for 1998 demo-
graphic and clinical variables, common mental health dis-
order (OR,1.96; 95% CI,1.47-2.62; P.001) and problem
drug use (OR,2.98; 95% CI,1.68-5.30; P.001) re-
mained significant predictors of opioid use in 2001.
Conclusions: Common mental health disorders and prob-
lem drug use are associated with initiation and use of pre-
scribed opioids in the general population. Attention to
psychiatric disorders is important when considering opi-
oid therapy.

IN PRIMARY CARE SETTINGS AROUND
the world, 5% to 35% of patients
have pain not associated with
cancer that persists for at least 6
months and is associated with dis-
ability or seeking health care.1 Between
1980 and 2000, the rate of prescribing opi-
oids at US outpatient visits for chronic
musculoskeletal pain doubled from 8% to
16% of visits.2 This increase has been in-
terpreted by some specialists as evidence
of better treatment of unrelieved pain,3
whereas others have expressed concern
about the safety and effectiveness of long-
term opioid therapy for chronic noncan-
cer pain.4
Patients with mental disorders gener-
ally have been excluded from random-
ized trials to test the effectiveness of opi-
oidsforchronicnoncancerpain,butresults
from observational studies suggest an as-
sociation between mental disorders and in-
creased opioid use for chronic noncancer
pain.5-8 It has not been possible to deter-
mine from these small or cross-sectional
studies whether this association is found
outside of specialty pain clinic settings. It
also has not been possible to determine
whether mental disorders increase the risk
of opioid use or whether opioid use in-
creases the risk of mental disorders. The
present study investigates this associa-
tion by using data from the 1998 and 2001
waves of a large, nationally representa-
tive, population-based survey, Health-
care for Communities (HCC). We hypoth-
esized that, controlling for pain-related
interference and other covariates, indi-
viduals with common mental health and
substance abuse disorders in 1998 would
be more likely to report regular use (in-
cluding initiation and continuation) of pre-
scribed opioids in 2001 than those with-
out these disorders.

METHODS
SAMPLE
Data are from HCC, a part of the Robert Wood Johnson Foun-
dation's Health Tracking Initiative. The HCC was a nationwide
telephone survey designed to track the effects of the changing
health care system on individuals at risk for alcohol abuse, drug
abuse, and mental health disorders. Study methods have been
described previously.9 The HCC respondents were a stratified
probability sample of participants in the Community Tracking
Study, a nationally representative survey of the US civilian popu-
lationfrom1996through1997.10 TheCommunityTrackingStudy
includes a sample clustered within 60 randomly selected US com-
munities and a national sample. The first wave (HCC1) was con-
ducted in 1997 and 1998, and the second wave (HCC2) was con-
ducted in 2000 and 2001. From the 14 985 respondents selected
for HCC1, 9585 complete interviews were obtained, for a re-
sponse rate of 64.0%. In HCC2, all HCC1 respondents were fol-
lowed up with a response rate of 69.5%, yielding 6659 com-
pleted interviews. We used sample weights designed by HCC
statisticians to adjust for the probability of selection, nonre-
sponse to the 2001 HCC2 survey, and the number of house-
holds in the Community Tracking Study survey that did not have
a telephone. We excluded respondents reporting cancer diag-
noses other than skin cancer within the past 3 years (n=132) to
isolate noncancer pain. Those missing data for key variables
(n=88; most often presence of arthritis [n=48] or health insur-
ance plan [n=33]) were also excluded, resulting in a sample of
6439. Informed consent was obtained orally before the inter-
view, and the study was approved by the institutional review
boards at University of California at Los Angeles and RAND.
VARIABLES
Dependent Variable
The HCC respondents were asked about all prescribed medica-
tionsthattheyhadtaken"atleastseveraltimesaweekforamonth
or more" in the past 12 months. Respondents were asked to read
the names of all their medications directly from their pill bottles
to the interviewers. These medications were later grouped into
therapeutic categories by study staff. From these data, we con-
structed a dichotomous measure of regular prescription opioid
use of at least 1 month. A total of 350 individuals reported such
regular opioid use at 1 or more time points. We sorted respon-
dents into 4 groups on the basis of their HCC1 and HCC2 regu-
lar prescription opioid use: no use (n=6089), 1998 use only
(n=113), 2001 use only (n=159), or both 1998 and 2001 use
(n=78). Of the 237 subjects reporting opioid use in 2001, 183
(77.2%) confirmed use for at least 2 months. The strength of the
association between common mental disorders and opioid use
was similar for this group confirming more long-term opioid use
but was somewhat larger. Although we do not have data on the
reasons these opioids were prescribed, pain is the primary indi-
cation for opioids, and only 10 respondents (4.2%) using opi-
oids in 2001 did not report a chronic pain condition or pain in-
terference at that time.
Independent Variables
Our model is based on the work of Andersen11 who posited that
access to medical treatment is a function of patient need, pre-
disposing factors, and enabling factors. We used several comple-
mentary measures of physical health and chronic physical con-
ditions as measures of the need for opioid treatment. These
measures included the Physical Component Summary­12, which
isanaggregatemeasureofphysicalhealthfunctioning,andamea-
sure of self-reported health (excellent, very good, good, fair, or
poor), both from the Medical Outcomes Study Short Form­
12.12 The HCC contains information about 17 self-reported
chronic medical conditions. Our final models included the num-
ber of chronic conditions and those individual conditions asso-
ciated with opioid use (P.10): arthritis, chronic low back pain,
chronic headaches, and other chronic pain conditions. We also
included a dichotomized measure of pain interference with re-
spondents' normal work (including work outside the home and
housework) derived from the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form­12 pain item (extremely/a lot vs moderately/a little bit/
not at all). All independent variables were from the 1998 wave.
The presence during the preceding 12 months of the men-
tal disorders most commonly diagnosed and treated in pri-
mary care (major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety
disorder, and panic disorder) was assessed by using short-
form versions13 of the World Health Organization's Compos-
ite International Diagnostic Interview (CIDI),14 which is based
on the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Re-
vised Third Edition.15 The CIDI is a fully structured interview
designed to be administered by lay interviewers.
Problem alcohol and drug use were assessed with common
assessment tools. These scales do not exactly replicate Diagnos-
tic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third Edi-
tion diagnoses of substance abuse or dependence (eg, they lack a
cleardeterminationoflossofcontroloveruse),soweusetheterms
problem alcohol use and problem drug use. Alcohol problems were
assessed by using the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test,

lemdrugusewasdesignatedonthebasisofansweringyestoeither
of 2 items adapted from the CIDI--indications of tolerance to the
medicationand/oremotionalorpsychologicalproblemsfromdrug
use (such as depression, anhedonia, paranoia, delusions, or hal-
lucinations). Problem use of prescription drugs was defined for
the respondent as use "on your own, meaning without a doctor's
prescription, or in larger amounts than prescribed, or for a longer
period than prescribed." These questions thus captured a broader
group than do classic substance abuse criteria. Significant prob-
lems have been noted with the sensitivity and specificity of the
DiagnosticandStatisticalManualofMentalDisorders,RevisedThird
Edition criteria for opioid abuse and dependence when applied

tions were asked in a section of the survey separate from ques-
tions about prescription medication use. Other covariates in-
cludedsex,income,maritalstatus,insurancestatus,workdisability,
race, age, education, and region of the country.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
In separate logistic regressions, we regressed opioid use in 2001
on the presence of any 1 of the 4 common mental disorders in
1998 (major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety disor-
der, or panic disorder) and each disorder separately. In separate
logistic regressions, we focused on initiation of opioids be-
tween 1998 and 2001 (by excluding those using opioids in 1998)
and on the continuation of the use of opioids (by excluding those
not using opioids in 1998).
Using multiple logistic regressions, we then investigated the
effects of having any of the 4 common mental disorders and
problem substance use in 1998 on regular opioid use in 2001,
first adjusting for sociodemographic factors, and then socio-
demographic and clinical factors. There were no significant in-
teractions between common mental disorders and any of the
other independent variables. We repeated these analyses in sub-
sets focusing on opioid initiation (those not using opioids in
1998) and continuation (those using opioids in 1998). All analy-
ses were conducted by using SUDAAN 9.019 with sample weights

mates of standard errors. Results are reported in raw numbers
of respondents, but percentages are weighted to be interpret-
able with respect to the general population.
RESULTS
Regularprescriptionopioiduse(atleastseveraltimesaweek
for a month or more) during at least 1 assessment period
was reported by 350 subjects (5.4%). Demographic and
clinical characteristics of the HCC total sample and of the
opioid use groups are shown in Table 1. A total of 6202
(96.3%)respondentsreportednoregularopioidusein2001,
whereas 237 (3.6%) reported regular opioid use; 1165
(12.6%) met criteria for at least 1 of 4 common mental dis-
orders (major depression, dysthymia, generalized anxiety
disorder, or panic disorder) in 1998. In unadjusted logis-
tic regression models, respondents with any of these dis-
orders in 1998 had higher rates of prescription opioid use
in2001thanthosewithout(oddsratio[OR],4.43;95%con-
fidence interval [CI], 3.64-5.38; P.001) (Figure). Each
individual 1998 disorder was also significantly associated
with opioid use (P.001) and the ORs were large (2.56-
6.51). The OR for generalized anxiety disorder was sig-
nificantly lower than those for panic (P=.02) or dysthy-
mia (P=.02). Individuals with problem drug use diagnosed
in 1998 (n=136) also had higher rates of prescribed opi-
oidusein2001(OR,3.57;95%CI,2.32-5.50;P.001)than
thosewithoutproblemdruguse(n=6303).Drugsmostfre-
quently used by those noting problem drug use were mari-
juana (n=74), analgesics (n=61), and sedatives (n=42).
Individualswithproblemalcoholusein1998(n=401)were
not more likely to use prescription opioids (OR,0.73; 95%
CI,0.43-1.24; P=.25) than those without (n=6038).
In separate logistic regressions, mental disorder in 1998
was associated with increased risk for initiation of regu-
lar opioid use between 1998 and 2001 (OR,3.26; 95%
CI,2.44-4.34; P.001). Problem drug use in 1998 also was
associatedwithincreasedriskofopioidinitiation(OR,4.03;
95% CI,2.63-6.17; P.001) but problem alcohol use in
1998 was not (OR,0.68; 95% CI,0.29-1.61; P=.38). Com-
mon mental disorder also was associated with increased
risk of continuation of opioids from 1998 through 2001
(OR,2.30;95%CI,1.02-5.17;P=.04).Neitherproblemdrug
usein1998(OR,0.59;95%CI,0.12-2.86;P=.51)norprob-
lem alcohol use in 1998 (OR,0.29; 95% CI,0.07-1.22;
P=.09) was associated with opioid continuation.
Patients receiving opioids were 2 to 3 times more likely
to report a perceived need for mental health treatment
(10% vs 19%-32%) (Table 1). Patients receiving opioids
at any time point did not report a greater perceived need
for substance abuse treatment. Among the 237 regular
users of prescribed opioids in 2001, 21 (8.9%) reported
opioid use beyond physician's prescription and 8 (38.1%)
of these 21 reported having physical or psychological
problems because of misusing drugs.
After we adjusted for sociodemographic and 1998 clini-
cal factors (Table 2), including the presence of chronic
pain conditions and level of pain interference, common
mental disorder in 1998 (OR,1.96; 95% CI,1.47-2.62;
P.001) and problem drug use (OR,2.98; 95% CI,1.68-
5.30; P.001) but not problem alcohol use (OR,0.63; 95%
CI,0.35-1.15; P=.13) remained significant predictors of
opioid use in 2001. If we adjusted for 2001 rather than
1998 pain interference, common mental disorder in 1998
(OR,1.77; 95% CI,1.29-2.43; P.001) and problem drug
use (OR,2.37; 95% CI,1.25-4.48; P.01) remained sig-
nificant predictors of opioid use in 2001. In the adjusted
models, "other" race, education levels of less than high
school and college or higher, location in the southern
United States, arthritis, chronic back pain, and high pain
interference remained significant predictors of opioid use.
In the 1998 adjusted models, any common mental dis-
order (OR,1.80; 95% CI,1.26-2.58; P.01) and prob-
lem drug use (OR,3.29; 95% CI,1.79-6.05; P.001) re-
mained significant predictors of opioid initiation. In these
adjusted models, any common mental disorder (OR,1.75;
95% CI,0.67-4.57; P=.24) and problem drug use
(OR,1.13; 95% CI,0.19-6.63; P=.88) were no longer sig-
nificant predictors of opioid continuation.
COMMENT
This study provides the first prospective, population-
based data about the association of common mental and
substance use disorders with the regular use of pre-
scribed opioid medication. In adjusted models, respon-
dents with a mental health disorder in 1998 were twice
as likely to use prescribed opioids in 2001. Respondents
with a mental health disorder who were not using opi-
oids in 1998 were more likely to initiate opioid use dur-
ing the 3-year follow-up. Although those with problem
drug use in 1998 were 3 times as likely to use prescribed
opioids in 2001, this group is far smaller than the num-
ber of patients with common mental health disorders. In-
dividuals receiving opioids long term also reported greater
perceived need for mental health care but not substance
abuse care. This association of mental disorders with in-
creased opioid use is consistent with results from our pre-
vious cross-sectional analysis of a larger 1998 sample.8
Why are individuals with psychiatric disorders more
likely to use opioids long term? It is well known that de-
pression and anxiety disorders are associated with in-
creasedratesofpsychologicalandphysicalsymptoms.Pain
arisingfromchronicmedicaldisordersalsoisratedasmore
severe in the presence of major depression.20 One intrigu-
ing possibility is that opioids may be used to treat a poorly
differentiated state of mental and physical pain. We be-
lieve effects of mental disorder may be stronger for initia-
tion than continuation of opioids because initiation may
be related more directly to patient distress, whereas con-
tinuation also is determined by response to opioids, which
may be inhibited in those with depression.21
Our findings are consistent with population-based evi-
dence that unmet need for mental health care is associ-
ated with higher rates of substance use.22 There is also a
centuries' long history of opioids being used by physi-
cians to treat depression and other mental disorders.23
Exogenous opioids elevate mood and endogenous opi-
oids modulate basal emotional state.24 Recent study re-
sults suggest that treatment-resistant depression25 and ob-
sessive-compulsive disorder26 may respond to opioid

*Data are given as number (weighted percentage) unless otherwise indicated. The number is the actual number noted in the sample; percentages are weighted
for oversampling, clustered design, and nonresponse to be reflective of the general population.
Percentage qualifying for any diagnosis does not equal the sum of the 4 individual diagnoses because respondents may have had more than 1 disorder.

treatment. Use and abuse of opioids appears to be com-
mon in individuals with posttraumatic stress disorder,
borderline personality disorder, and other dissociative dis-
orders.27,28 However, evidence suggests the condition of
these individuals may deteriorate with opioid use,29,30 and
they may actually improve psychiatrically by using the
opioid antagonist naltrexone hydrochloride.31 Al-
though substance abuse and major depression increase
the likelihood of using prescribed opioids, few data sup-
port this use because patients with substance abuse and
major depression have been excluded from most con-
trolled trials of opioids for chronic pain.32
Our data suggest that diagnosis and treatment of psy-
chiatricdisordersareimportantstepswhenconsideringpa-
tients for opioid therapy. However, existing guidelines and
consensus statements concerning the use of opioids for
chronic noncancer pain vary widely in their recommen-
dations about depression and other psychiatric disorders.
Some guidelines33,34 mention the importance of the assess-
ment of psychiatric disorders, but other guidelines35,36 and
reviews37,38 makenomentionofpsychiatricdisorders.How-
ever, adequate care for depression may improve chronic
pain, a finding suggested by results from a recent trial of
collaborative care for depression in older adults that dem-
onstrated that arthritis pain intensity and pain interfer-
ence were reduced by improved treatment for depres-
sion.39 Such depression treatment effects might reduce the
need for long-term analgesic therapy or permit shifting pa-
tients to less addictive pain treatments than opioids.
The strengths of our study include the use of prospec-
tive data from a large nationally representative sample
of the general population, which avoids the selection bias
common in the clinical samples in which opioid use has
been studied to date and allows interpretation of our re-
sults in terms of the national population. The HCC also
uses the systematic and well-validated World Health Or-
ganization CIDI approach to psychiatric diagnosis. Fi-
nally, the HCC provides extensive data about demo-
graphic and clinical covariates that could confound the
relationship between psychiatric disorders and opioid use.
Our study has a number of limitations. First, the re-
sponse rates to the telephone survey were 64.0% in 1998
and 69.5% in 2001, which is similar to other general popu-
lation telephone surveys performed at that time. For ex-
ample, the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System40
had a 63.5% response rate after determining household
eligibility in 1998. Compared with responders to the 2001
survey, nonresponders were more likely to be younger
than 30 years; to be of race other than white; to be black
or Hispanic; to be single; to have less than a high school
education; to have an annual income less than $19 000;
to not be insured; to have fair to poor general health; and
to meet criteria for dysthymia, generalized anxiety, or
panic disorder. Because these are many of the signifi-
cant predictors of opioid use in 2001, their loss to fol-
low-up introduces a conservative bias to our findings. Sec-
ond, substance abuse disorders were assessed with
abbreviated versions of the World Health Organization
CIDI interview that did not fully document all the cri-
teria needed for a drug abuse diagnosis. Third, there was
no direct clinical observation of the study subjects. All
assessments were conducted by telephone and rely on
self-report. Physical health status was documented
through a count of chronic conditions and the physical
component score of the Medical Outcomes Study Short
Form­12. Fourth, subjects read the names of their opi-
oids from their pill bottles and verified that they were
taking them regularly, but we do not know why they were
prescribed opioids or if they were abusing them. Fi-
nally, this is an observational study from which it is not
possible to derive unbiased data about the effects of opi-
oid use on clinical outcomes.

In summary, our study results demonstrate that com-
mon psychiatric disorders (depression, anxiety, and drug
abuse) predict initiation and ongoing regular use of opi-
oids in patients with chronic pain. Although much atten-
tion has been given to the possibility of substance abuse
in regular users of prescribed opioids, our data suggest that
common depressive or anxiety disorders also are associ-
ated strongly with opioid use and may pose a more sig-
nificant clinical problem in this population because they
are much more common. Greater attention to these com-
