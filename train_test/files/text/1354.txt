The authors examined influences of asthma and household environment (passive smoking, use of a gas stove,
and having a dog or cat) on five measures of spirometric lung function among 8- to 16-year-old subjects, as
measured cross-sectionally in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) (1988­
1994). In regression models, independent variables included asthma status, household environmental factors,
age, and anthropometric measurements. Regression analyses were weighted by the NHANES III examination
sample weighting factor, and results were adjusted for clustering in the sampling design. There were distinct sex
differences in the results. In girls, lung function was lowest among active asthmatics taking prescription
respiratory medicine, whereas lung function in other active and inactive asthmatics did not differ greatly from that
in nonasthmatics. In boys, however, all groups of asthmatics had substantially lower lung function than
nonasthmatics. Differences in lung function between active asthmatics and nonasthmatics were stable with
increasing age. However, the lung function of inactive asthmatic girls and boys returned to and diverged from
nonasthmatics' levels, respectively. In asthmatic girls, passive smoking was associated with reduced lung
function; having a dog or cat was associated with increased lung function; and gas stove use was associated with
reduced lung function among subjects not taking prescription respiratory medicine.

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
have been conducted since the 1970s by the National Center
for Health Statistics. These surveys characterize the health
and nutritional status of the US population. They are cross-
sectional and employ a complex stratified, multistage proba-
bility sampling design. They collect extensive information
on health and nutritional status, demographic and socioeco-
nomic factors, household characteristics, and other factors.
Thus, they offer investigators the opportunity to assess influ-
ences of host and environmental factors on health-related
outcomes on a national scale.
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted from 1988 to 1994.
A detailed description of the design of NHANES III can be
found elsewhere (1). The NHANES III examination
included measurement of spirometric lung function, defi-
cits in which can reflect pulmonary air flow limitation
(obstruction). In adults, obstructive spirometric deficits are
strongly associated with smoking and with premature
mortality (2­4). In both children and adults, such deficits
are also associated with obstructive respiratory disorders
such as asthma and chronic obstructive lung disease. The

long-term health consequences of stable spirometric defi-
cits in children and adolescents are not fully understood,
but available evidence suggests that they signal respiratory
health impairment in adulthood (5­8). It is therefore impor-
tant to understand influences of host and environmental
factors on children's and adolescents' lung function and to
ascertain the reversibility of lung function deficits in this
age group.
In the present study, we examined the influences of asthma
and of three household environmental factors (smoking by
household members (household passive smoking), use of a
gas stove for cooking, and the presence of a dog or cat in the
home) on spirometric lung function in nonsmoking
NHANES III subjects aged 8­16 years. We also evaluated
whether asthmatics' lung function returned to nonasth-
matics' levels with increasing age.

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data collection
In NHANES III, standardized questionnaire interviews
were administered to subjects in their homes and at mobile
examination centers, and extensive physical and laboratory
examinations were carried out at the mobile examination
centers. Lung function was measured in subjects aged 8
years. For child subjects aged birth to 16 years, most ques-
tionnaire information, including asthma history, was
provided by a surrogate respondent, usually the mother.
Subjects over the age of 16 years responded for themselves.
Preliminary analyses suggested that there were systematic
differences between surrogate-reported asthma prevalences

and self-reported asthma prevalences. Therefore, in this
report we consider only subjects aged 8­16 years.
The spirometric testing protocol and quality control proce-
dures followed the spirometry guidelines issued by the
American Thoracic Society in 1987 (9). Lung function was
measured at the mobile examination centers with dry rolling-
seal volume spirometers that recorded data electronically.
Subjects performed a minimum of five and a maximum of
eight forced vital capacity (FVC) maneuvers. Spirometry
was quality-controlled by the National Institute of Occupa-
tional Safety and Health (Morgantown, West Virginia) (10).
Measurements of FVC and first-second forced expiratory
volume (FEV1
) were judged reproducible if their largest and
second-largest values from acceptable maneuvers were
within the greater of 5 percent or 100 ml.
Five lung function metrics were examined in data analysis:
FVC; FEV1
; forced expiratory flow between 25 percent and
75 percent of FVC (FEF25­75
); and the ratios of FEV1
and
FEF25­75
to FVC (FEV1
/FVC and FEF25­75
/FVC, respec-
tively). The analyzed FVC and FEV1
values were the largest
volumes achieved in any acceptable FVC maneuver. The
FEF25­75
was taken from the acceptable maneuver with the
largest sum of FVC and FEV1
.

Deficits in all of these metrics except FVC reflect reduced
patency of the lung's airways, with resulting air flow limita-
tion (obstruction). A selective deficit in FEV1
reflects
obstruction mainly of larger (proximal) airways. FEF25­75
detects small-airways obstruction more sensitively than does
FEV1
. Persons with purely obstructive airways disorders
generally achieve normal FVC, though slowly. Division of
FEV1
and FEF25­75
by FVC provides standardization for lung
size beyond that provided by statistical adjustment for age
and anthropometric measurements.
Data analysis
Questionnaire respondents were asked whether a doctor
had ever told them that they had asthma and, if so, whether
they still had asthma. Subjects who answered "yes, yes" and
"yes, no" were classified as having active and inactive
asthma, respectively. Data inspection revealed that mothers
reported a higher prevalence of active asthma than did other
questionnaire respondents. Analysis was thus restricted to
subjects for whom the mother responded. Nonasthmatic
subjects for whom the mother reported wheezing without

colds but no wheezing in the past 12 months were also
excluded.
Respondents were asked about use of prescription respira-
tory medication in the past month. A history was considered
positive if the subject reported taking any of the following:
"adrenal corticosteroids" (Food and Drug Administration
code 1032), "antiasthmatics/bronchodilators" (code 1940),
"respiratory tract" medication (code 1900), or "steroids-
inhalation/nasal" (code 1947). Under code 1940, approxi-
mately 65 percent, 25 percent, and 10 percent of positive
responses were for beta agonists (bronchodilators), theo-
phylline and its derivatives, and cromolyn sodium, respec-
tively.
Information on personal smoking history was obtained
through confidential interviews with subjects. The preva-
lence of personal smoking was strongly positively associated
with age. We excluded subjects who were current smokers or
had smoked 5 packs of cigarettes during their lifetime, to
avoid the potential confounding of personal smoking effects
with effects of age on lung function.
Previous studies have shown sex differences in the effects
of asthma and of host and environmental factors on lung
function and respiratory symptom prevalence (11­14). We
therefore conducted sex-specific analyses. Preliminary anal-
yses showed no appreciable effects of urban versus rural
status, day-care attendance, or the presence of any siblings,
older siblings, or younger siblings in the NHANES III data
set. Reported use of an exhaust fan had no discernible influ-
ence on the effect of using a gas stove for cooking. Among
nonasthmatics, there were no appreciable effects of prescrip-
tion respiratory medication use, wheezing in the past 12
months, or parental history of asthma or hay fever. There-
fore, these characteristics were not considered in the final
models.
Regression models were constructed. Outcome variables
were the natural logarithms of lung function metrics. Data
analysis was conducted in three steps. Step 1 was intended to
characterize overall influences of asthma on girls' and boys'
lung function. Step 1 models included three 0/1 dummy vari-
ables (main effects) for active asthmatics taking and not
taking prescription respiratory medication and for inactive
asthmatics. Models also included the following independent
covariates: 1) natural log of age in years (age in months/12);
2) anthropometric measures--the natural logs of standing
height (cm) and body mass index (weight (kg)/height (m)2)
and a dummy variable for exceeding the age- and sex-
specific 90th percentile value for triceps skinfold thickness;
3) household environmental factors (all dummy variables)--
having one smoker in the home, having two or more smokers
in the home, use of a gas stove for cooking, having a dog,
and having a cat; 4) ethnicity (all dummy variables)--non-
Hispanic Black, Mexican American, non-Mexican Hispanic
American living in the Northeast census region (where about
half of all Hispanic Americans were Puerto Rican Amer-

Step 2 was intended to assess whether active and inactive
asthmatic girls' and boys' lung function returned to nonasth-
matics' levels with increasing age. Step 2 models included
dummy variables and age interaction terms for active and
inactive asthmatics and a dummy variable for use of respira-
tory medication in asthmatics. Other covariates were defined
as in the step 1 models.
Step 3 was intended to examine influences of household
environment on lung function. Factors of interest were
household passive smoking, use of a gas stove for cooking,
and having a dog or cat. Separate models were constructed
for asthmatics and nonasthmatics. Asthmatics' models
included dummy variables for inactive asthma and age at
asthma onset <3 years among active and inactive asthmatics.
These models included dummy variables for use of respira-
tory medication, using a gas stove and taking respiratory
medication, using a gas stove and not taking respiratory

defined as in the step 1 models. Nonasthmatics' step 3
models were identical to those of the step 1 models, except
that they did not include terms for asthma status or respira-
tory medication.
All regression analyses employed SUDAAN software
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, North
Carolina), which calculates sample variances to adjust for
stratification and geographic clustering in the sampling
design. Regression analyses were weighted by the examina-
tion sample weighting factor, which corrects for nonrepre-
sentative sampling on ethnicity, age, sex, and other factors.
Predicted lung function was depicted for selected models;
exponentials (antilogs) of modeled log(lung function) were
plotted by age using S-Plus 2000 software (Insightful Corpo-
ration, Seattle, Washington). Category-specific exponentials
were fitted with quadratic regression curves.
RESULTS
Subjects' characteristics are shown in table 1. Weighted
ethnic distributions differed from unweighted ones, because
Blacks and Mexican Americans were intentionally oversam-
pled in NHANES III. In the analyzed weighted sample, 68.9
percent of subjects were non-Hispanic White, 15.1 percent
were non-Hispanic Black, and 8.5 percent were Mexican
American. Weighted prevalences of active and inactive
asthma were higher in boys than in girls. Weighted preva-
lences of use of prescription respiratory medication in the
past month were 1.4 percent, 41.4 percent, and 0.4 percent in
nonasthmatics, active asthmatics, and inactive asthmatics,
respectively. Among active asthmatics, the weighted preva-
lence of prescription antiasthmatic/bronchodilator use was
substantially higher in boys than in girls. Only 8.5 percent
(weighted) of active asthmatics reported using steroids in the
past month.
Weighted characteristics are shown, by asthma status, in
table 2. Among girls, prevalences of asthma-associated char-
acteristics were quite consistently highest in active asth-
matics taking prescription respiratory medicine, second-
highest in other active asthmatics, second-lowest in inactive
asthmatics, and lowest in nonasthmatics. Among boys, this
tendency was less consistent, though prevalences of these
characteristics were generally highest in active asthmatics.
In both sexes, prevalences of wheezing, visiting a physician
or an emergency room for wheezing, and hospitalization for
wheezing in the past year were distinctly highest in active
asthmatics taking prescription respiratory medication.
Among inactive asthmatics, wheezing was more prevalent in
girls (53.2 percent) than in boys (11.2 percent).
Results of the step 1 analyses are summarized in table 3
and figures 1 and 2. Table 3 shows model-predicted lung
function for non-Hispanic Whites and p value levels for each
lung function metric in each asthmatic group in relation to
nonasthmatics. Figures 1 and 2 show predicted FEF25­75

Predicted levels of all metrics but FVC were lower in asth-
matics than in nonasthmatics. Effects of asthma were gener-
ally clearest in the ratio metrics log(FEV1
/FVC) and
log(FEF25­75
/FVC). Among girls, predicted ratio metrics
were clearly lowest in asthmatics taking prescription medi-
cation. Among other active and inactive asthmatic girls,
these metrics generally did not differ greatly from those in
nonasthmatics. Among boys, however, these metrics were
distinctly and statistically significantly lower (at  = 0.05) in
all asthmatic groups than in nonasthmatics and did not differ
appreciably among asthmatic groups.
In step 2 analyses, differences between the lung function
of active asthmatics and that of nonasthmatics were reason-
ably stable with age (for the interaction of active asthma with
age across all sex-specific lung function metrics, p  0.436).
In contrast, the lung function of inactive asthmatic girls
tended to return to nonasthmatics' levels, and that of inactive
asthmatic boys tended to diverge from nonasthmatics'
levels, with increasing age. In girls, the sign of the interac-
tion of inactive asthma with age was positive for all metrics
but FVC. In boys, this interaction was negative for all
metrics but FVC. Among girls, p values for this interaction
were 0.175, 0.030, 0.081, and 0.047 for log(FEV1
),

FEF25­75
/FVC by age in nonasthmatics, active asthmatics,
and inactive asthmatics, as derived in step 2 models.
In step 3 analyses, household environmental factors
consistently influenced lung function in asthmatic girls but
not in other sex-asthma groups. In asthmatic girls, the pres-
ence of two or more smokers in the home was associated
with reduced lung function (table 4 and figure 4). This asso-
ciation was statistically significant for log(FEF25­75
) and
log(FEF25­75
/FVC) and was marginally significant for
log(FEV1
) and log(FEV1
/FVC). In asthmatic boys, modeled
lung function was also generally lowest in the presence of
two or more smokers but not significantly so. In asthmatic
girls, use of a gas stove in the absence of prescription respi-
ratory medication was consistently associated with reduced
lung function (table 5 and figure 5). No such association was
observed for gas stove use when respiratory medication was
taken. There was no consistent influence of gas stove use on
asthmatic boys' lung function. The presence of a dog or cat
in the home was consistently and significantly associated
with increased lung function in asthmatic girls but not in
asthmatic boys (table 6 and figure 6).
Among nonasthmatics, the presence of two or more
smokers in the home was associated with significantly
increased predicted FVC (p = 0.011) in boys and with
nonsignificantly increased predicted FEV1
(p = 0.274) in
boys. Otherwise, the presence of two or more smokers was
associated with nonsignificant reductions in nonasthmatics'
lung function. There were no appreciable effects of gas stove
use, having a dog, or having a cat on predicted lung function
in nonasthmatics (data not shown).
DISCUSSION
When interpreting these results, it is important to note that
different subpopulations were present in different propor-
tions in the US population and the weighted NHANES III
sample. For example, non-Hispanic Whites constituted over
two thirds of our weighted analytical sample. Therefore, this
group counted more heavily than other ethnic groups in the
computation of effect estimates. The estimates derived in our
models should be regarded as composite nationwide esti-
mates for persons aged 8­16 years. They should not be
generalized beyond this age group, and they may not be
equally applicable to all ethnic groups.
The NHANES III data set does not provide information on
mother's smoking, the number or ages of siblings, or the
specific ethnicity of Hispanic Americans other than Mexican
Americans. In addition, breastfeeding influences the devel-
opment of asthma and wheezing (15) and a mother's
smoking during pregnancy influences children's lung func-
tion (16). In NHANES III, this information was collected

only for children aged birth to 5 years and children aged birth
to 11 years, respectively. Inability to adjust the analytical
models for these factors limits interpretation of these find-
ings somewhat.
Use of prescription respiratory medication was associated
with clinically severe asthma, especially in girls (table 2).
Deficits in lung function were especially pronounced among
asthmatic girls who took such medication (table 3). Other
investigators have also observed larger lung function deficits
in asthmatics taking such medication than in those not taking
it (11, 12). Overall, the literature suggests strongly that
medical treatment does not yet compensate for lung function
deficits in asthmatic children and adolescents. It would be
highly desirable to assess whether the effectiveness and
accessibility of asthma treatment are improving over time.
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys
provide the opportunity to conduct such assessment nation-
ally, although the current survey does not include lung func-
tion testing.
Asthmatic subjects were classified as active or inactive
according to their mothers' perceptions. This classification is
subject to some uncertainty, especially in girls, in whom
wheezing during the past 12 months was reported for over
half of inactive asthmatics and in whom the frequency of
school absence was nearly as high in inactive asthmatics as
in active asthmatics (table 2). Nevertheless, in both girls and

boys, weighted frequencies of most asthma-related charac-
teristics were appreciably lower in inactive asthmatics than
in active asthmatics. This was true even for wheezing in
girls. In addition, among inactive asthmatics, no girls and
only one boy had taken prescription respiratory medication
in the past month. On balance, we believe that the chosen
classification method is reasonable.
Absolute differences between the lung function of active
asthmatics and the lung function of nonasthmatics were quite
stable with age. This observation is broadly consistent with
the literature, which suggests that lung function deficits
associated with childhood asthma sometimes improve after
childhood but do not disappear entirely. Among children
aged 6­18 years, Gold et al. (11) observed that absolute defi-
cits in lung function associated with asthma and wheezing
increased with age. Percentage deficits did not change
substantially with age. In southern California, Berhane et al.
(12) made similar findings in asthmatic children and adoles-
cents; asthma-associated deficits were somewhat larger in
boys than in girls.

Youth Lung Function in NHANES III 187
Am J Epidemiol 2003;158:175­189
In our analyses, inactive asthmatic girls' lung function
appeared to "catch up" with nonasthmatics' lung function,
whereas inactive asthmatic boys' lung function diverged
from nonasthmatics' lung function as age increased. These
trends were observed for multiple lung function metrics and
were often statistically significant. These trends are subject to
uncertainty, because unweighted sample sizes were small and
because the NHANES III data are cross-sectional. Age trends
observed in cross-sectional studies can differ from those in
longitudinal ones (17, 18), largely because of unadjusted
birth cohort effects in cross-sectional data. We cannot rule
out the possibility of subtle cohort effects in the present study.
In addition, one might expect wheezing to be associated
with worsening, not improving, lung function. Wheezing
was reported for more than half of the inactive asthmatic
girls, so the observed age trends might seem counterintui-
tive. Even so, these trends persisted when additional dummy
variables for wheezing in nonasthmatics and asthmatics
were entered into the step 2 model. This caused the absolute
magnitudes of effect estimates for the interaction of inactive
asthma with age to diminish by less than 10 percent, with no
changes in their signs and only small changes in p values.
When variables for age at asthma onset were entered into the
step 2 model, the inactive asthma-age interaction tended to
increase, and its p value to decrease, in girls. Furthermore, in
separate models, the interaction of wheezing with age in
ever-asthmatics was positive for all metrics but FVC in girls
and was negative for all metrics in boys.
Thus, we submit that the observed age trends in inactive
asthmatics may well reflect actual sex differences in the
natural history of asthma between the ages of 8 and 16 years.
Long-term deficits in asthmatics' lung function may result
from permanent restructuring of the airways (airway remod-
eling) (19, 20), which may be mediated in turn by chronic
airway inflammation (21, 22). Conceivably, among inactive
asthmatics, 8- to 16-year-old boys might be more susceptible
than girls to these processes, even though the girls have a
higher prevalence of wheezing. The prevalence of positive
skin tests was higher in inactive asthmatic boys than in inac-
tive asthmatic girls. In addition, the prevalence of a positive
history of asthma or hay fever in both parents was substan-
tially higher among inactive asthmatic boys than among
inactive asthmatic girls or active asthmatic boys (table 2).
Therefore, one might hypothesize that in the studied age
group, susceptibility to airway remodeling could be more
closely associated with one or both of these characteristics
than with wheezing.
We examined five lung function metrics, including the
ratios of FEV1
and FEF25­75
to FVC. Our results underscore
the importance of considering such ratios. O'Connor et al.
(23) reported that FEF25­75
/FVC is particularly effective in
detecting effects of asthma and maternal smoking on chil-
dren's lung function. In our analyses, ratio metrics generally
provided the clearest distinctions not only regarding the
effects of asthma and passive smoking on lung function but
also regarding the effects of gas stove use and having a dog
or cat in asthmatic girls.
In the present study, the lung function of asthmatic girls
was influenced, negatively and positively, by exposure to
household environmental factors. Household passive
smoking was clearly associated with reduced lung function
in this group, as was gas stove use in asthmatic girls not
taking prescription respiratory medication. It appeared that
use of such medication conferred protection against the
effects of gas stove use, even though overall, asthma was
most clinically severe among asthmatic girls taking such
medication.
The presence of a dog or cat in the home was consistently
associated with increased lung function in asthmatic girls.
Previous studies suggest that the presence of animals in the
home can protect against incident asthma (24­27). It has also
been proposed that such protection may be conferred by a
modified T-helper cell type 2 (Th2) response to cat antigen.
Such a modified Th2 response might stimulate production of
immunoglobulin G and not of immunoglobulin E as usually
associated with the Th2 response. Such a modified response
might lead in turn to reduced skin-test sensitivity to cat
antigen (28). It is not known whether such a "desensitiza-
tion" response could reduce clinical severity or lung function
deficits in preexisting asthma. If so, it might be more likely
to occur in girls than in boys and it might progress with

increasing age or increasing duration of pet ownership. In the
present study, there were too few asthmatics for us to test
these hypotheses reliably or to test the separate effects of
having a dog and having a cat.
In asthmatic girls, the association of having a dog or cat
with increased lung function could reflect selective avoid-
ance of pets (29, 30). If so, the prevalence of having a dog or
cat should be lower in asthmatic girls than in nonasthmatic
girls. In fact, weighted prevalences were very similar in asth-
matic and nonasthmatic girls (47.3 percent and 48.3 percent,
respectively). Thus, we doubt whether avoidance of pets
accounted for this association.
To assess the sensitivity of household environmental
effects to model specification, we constructed several addi-
tional models. Specifically, we entered a term for wheezing
in separate models. We also constructed a model with no
adjustment for nonreproducibility of FVC or FEV1
and
another excluding nonreproducible measurements. House-
hold environmental effects were actually somewhat stronger
in the model with an additional term for wheezing than in the
step 3 model.
Use of a gas stove and having a dog or cat had little or no
influence on lung function in asthmatic boys or in nonasth-
matics of either sex. In addition, modeled lung function was
usually lowest, though not statistically significantly so,
among subjects with two or more smokers in the home. We
reran the analytical models as weighted mixed models (the
MIXED procedure in SAS/STAT software; SAS Institute,
Inc., Cary, North Carolina), treating strata and clusters as
random effects. In nonasthmatic girls, for all metrics but
log(FVC), there were significant or marginally significant
associations of the presence of two or more household
smokers with reduced lung function (p < 0.054). In nonasth-
matic boys, the presence of two or more smokers was signif-
icantly associated with increased log(FVC) and log(FEV1
)
and with reduced log(FEV1
/FVC) and log(FEF25­75
/FVC)
(data not shown). Thus, SUDAAN may yield somewhat
conservative results regarding the effects of passive
smoking.
Mannino et al. (31, 32) investigated the effects of passive
smoking among children and adolescents in NHANES III.
They excluded subjects who reported active smoking and
whose serum cotinine level was greater than 20 ng/ml; they
then divided subjects into tertiles of cotinine level as a metric
of passive smoking. In both the whole sample (31) and the
sample of asthmatics (32), Mannino et al. reported signifi-
cantly lower lung function in the high-cotinine tertile than in
the low-cotinine tertile. Our results regarding the effects of
passive smoking are qualitatively similar to those of
Mannino et al., although we observed a statistically signifi-
cant effect only in asthmatic girls. Differences between
results may well reflect differences in analytical strategy.
For example, Mannino et al. used serum cotinine as the
metric for passive smoking, whereas we used questionnaire
responses. In addition, Mannino et al. appear to have
combined both sexes into single models, with adjustment for
sex. In view of the marked sex differences in the effects of
covariates in this age group, we conducted sex-specific anal-
yses.
The literature is somewhat inconsistent regarding effects
of household environmental factors on respiratory health and
regarding sex differences in sensitivity to these factors. In
the Netherlands, Cuijpers et al. (13) reported that boys' lung
function was negatively associated with passive smoking but
was not affected by the presence of unvented gas-fueled
kitchen geysers (water heaters) or pets. In girls, passive
smoking and the presence of geysers exhibited limited nega-
tive associations with lung function. In southern California,
Peters et al. (33) observed reduced lung function among chil-
dren living in homes with gas stoves. In Italy, among house-
holds using gas stoves, Corbo et al. (34) observed a
significant negative association of time spent in the kitchen
with girls' lung function but not boys'.
Gas stoves emit the air pollutant nitrogen dioxide. In the
United States, Neas et al. (35) observed no consistent associ-
ation of indoor nitrogen dioxide with children's lung func-
tion, but they did observe a statistically significant positive
association with respiratory symptoms, including wheezing,
in girls. In Japan, Shima and Adachi (36) also observed a
stronger association of indoor nitrogen dioxide with respira-
tory symptoms in girls than in boys. Overall, the current
literature, like the present study, suggests that there are
stronger respiratory effects of gas cooking among girls than
among boys. Further research is needed to ascertain why
effects of household environmental factors differ across
locations and subpopulations.
