Objective: Comprehensive tobacco control policies for US colleges and universities have been
proposed by several groups in order to counter the rising use of tobacco by students enrolled in these
institutions. Student opinion of these policies is not known, and concern about student opposition is one
barrier that deters administrators from adopting the policies. This study measured student support for
recommended college tobacco control policies.
Design: Mailed survey of US college students (2001 Harvard School of Public Health College Alcohol
Study).
Setting: 119 nationally representative, four-year colleges and universities in the USA.
Participants: 10 904 randomly selected undergraduate students enrolled at participating schools.
Main outcome measures: Students' opinion of 7 proposed tobacco control policies.
Results: A majority of students supported each policy. Over three quarters of students favoured smoke-
free policies for all college buildings, residences, and dining areas, while 71% supported prohibiting
tobacco advertising and sponsorship of campus social events, 59% favoured prohibiting tobacco sales
on campus, and 51% supported smoke-free campus bars. All policies had more support among non-
smokers than smokers (p < 0.001). Among smokers, support for policies was inversely related to inten-
tion to quit and intensity of tobacco consumption. Because college students' tobacco consumption is
low, a majority of smokers favoured banning smoking in college buildings and dining areas and pro-
hibiting tobacco marketing on campus.
Conclusions: Student support for proposed campus tobacco control policies is strong, even among
smokers, and broadly based across demographic subgroups. These findings should provide
reassurance to college administrators who are considering adopting these policies.
Tobacco use among young adults aged 18­24 years is a
growing public health concern.1 In 1997, 31% of young
adults attended a college or university, making these
institutions important channels for influencing young adult
behaviour.2 The prevalence of cigarette smoking among US
college students rose 28% between 1993 and 1999.3 4 The rea-
son for this increase is unclear, but elements in the college
environment may encourage tobacco use. In 1999, only 27% of
US colleges banned smoking in all buildings including student
residences.5 Tobacco products were readily available on college
campuses, and access to tobacco treatment services was
limited.5 Furthermore, a growing body of evidence from
tobacco industry documents demonstrates that the industry
markets actively on and around college campuses, advertising
in college and alternative newspapers and sponsoring social
events on campus and at nearby bars where free cigarettes and
other brand items are distributed.6­8 Exposure to tobacco pro-
motions at social events has been associated with increased
tobacco use by college students.9
To discourage tobacco use among college students, a similar
set of tobacco control policies for US colleges and universities
was recommended by the American College Health Associ-
ation and American Cancer Society.10 11 These organisations
developed their recommendations independently, each adapt-
ing to the college environment tobacco control policies that are
effective in the general population. Both groups recommended
that colleges prohibit smoking in all campus buildings
(including student residences and eating areas), prohibit
tobacco advertising on campus and in college publications,
prohibit tobacco sponsorship of campus events, prohibit the
sale of tobacco on campus, and provide ready access to smok-
ing cessation treatment. While there is limited evidence for
the efficacy of these recommended policies in the college envi-
ronment at present, data are beginning to appear. For
example, one cross-sectional study found an association
between smoke-free policies in student residences and lower
smoking prevalence, especially among students who did not
enter college as regular smokers.12
A survey of 50 US public universities conducted in 2001
reported a low prevalence of recommended tobacco control
policies, despite a recent increase in the prevalence of smoke-
free policies in student residences.13 There is little other infor-
mation about the prevalence of recommended tobacco control
policies or about which factors facilitate and impede their
adoption. Existing data indicate that college administrators do
not regard tobacco use to be a high priority problem, in part
because it has less immediate morbidity and mortality than
other problems, such as alcohol use.5 14 Furthermore, adminis-
trators do not perceive strong student demand for strengthen-
ing tobacco control policies, and some are concerned about
potential student opposition to changing campus tobacco
control policies.14 15 Students' opinion of the proposed tobacco
control policies has not been measured, but it could provide
valuable information with the potential to influence adminis-
trators' policy decisions.
We analysed survey data from a large, nationally represen-
tative random sample of US college students to identify the
extent and predictors of student support for recommended
campus tobacco control policies. We hypothesised that support
for all policies would be stronger among non-smokers than
smokers.

random sample of students enrolled in 120 four-year US col-
leges and universities.16 For the survey, each school provided a
list of 215 randomly selected students from all full time
undergraduate students enrolled during the 2000­01 school
year. One college was excluded from analysis because its
response rate was substantially lower than the others, leaving
119 schools.
The schools, located in 38 states and the District of Colum-
bia, were selected to create a nationally representative sample
of four-year US colleges and universities.17 Sixty nine per cent
of respondents attended public colleges and 31% attended
private colleges; the corresponding US distribution is 68% and
32%, respectively.18 Forty seven per cent of respondents
attended large colleges (> 10 000 students), 23% attended
medium sized colleges (5001­10 000 students), and 29%
attended small colleges (< 5000 students); the national
distribution is 37%, 24%, and 40%, respectively.18 Large colleges
are over represented in the CAS sample because they were
selected with probability proportional to size. Thirteen per
cent of students attended schools with a religious affiliation,
compared with 16% nationwide.18
Surveys were mailed to 21 055 students in February 2001.
Three separate mailings were sent within three weeks: a ques-
tionnaire, a reminder postcard, and a second questionnaire.
Responses were anonymous. Cash prizes were offered to
encourage response. The response rate was 52% (n = 10 904).
Questionnaire and measures
The questionnaire assessed students' demographic character-
istics, tobacco use, opinion of proposed tobacco control
policies, awareness of their school's policy about smoking in
student residences, and the current smoking policy of their
residence. Demographic factors assessed were age, sex,
ethnicity, year in school, marital status, and residence
(on-campus or off-campus). Students were asked if they lived
in housing designated as smoke-free, and if not, whether they
would like to do so. Students who reported smoking a
cigarette in the past 30 days were defined as current smokers.
Cigarette smokers were asked to specify daily cigarette
consumption and frequency of smoking ("On how many of
the past 30 days did you smoke cigarettes?").
To assess attitudes regarding tobacco control policies on
campus, students were asked, "To what extent do you support
or oppose the following possible school policies about
smoking?" Response options were strongly support, support,
oppose, and strongly oppose. Students were asked about three
types of tobacco control policies: clean indoor air (four items),
tobacco marketing restrictions (two items), and tobacco sales
restrictions (one item). Clean indoor air policies tested were
smoking prohibitions in: (1) all campus buildings; (2) all parts
of residence halls including student sleeping quarters; (3)
on-campus restaurants or dining areas; and (4) on-campus
bars or pubs. Marketing restrictions assessed were prohibi-
tions on tobacco industry sponsorship of school parties or
events and tobacco advertisements in student newspapers.
Students were also asked their opinion of prohibiting the sale
of tobacco products on campus.
A separate written questionnaire was sent to administrators
at each school in the sample. In 2001, two questions asked
about the school's smoking policies. Administrators were
asked whether smoking was prohibited everywhere on
campus, and if not, whether smoking was prohibited in
residence hall private rooms and common areas. Responses
were obtained from all schools.
Analysis
Statistical analyses were carried out using STATA.19 Data were
weighted to account for colleges' different sampling fractions
and to match each college's distribution of sex, race
(white/non-white), and age (< 18 years, 18­22 years, > 22
years). Analyses were conducted to examine the potential bias
introduced by non-respondents. Response rates did not differ
between colleges that did and did not (1) prohibit smoking
everywhere on campus (p=0.85) or (2) prohibit smoking in
student residences (p = 0.60). The Spearman correlation
coefficient between a college's current smoking rate and its
response rate was 0.15 (p = 0.10). There was no significant
difference in current smoking rates between students who
responded before and after the second mailing (24.8% v 26.0%,
p = 0.19). College response rate was included as a continuous
covariate in all multivariate regression models to control for
non-response bias.
Attitudes toward policies were dichotomised into two
categories: support or oppose. Bivariate analyses identified
student level and college level characteristics associated with
attitudes toward tobacco control policies. Significance was
assessed with 2 tests and 2 tests of trend for categorical vari-
ables and t tests for continuous variables. Multivariate models
were created to identify student level and college level factors
that were independently associated with each proposed policy.
All models adjusted for each schools' survey response rate and
included student age, sex, ethnicity, year in school, marital
status, and current cigarette smoking. College level factors
included in models were size of enrollment (< 5000,
5000­10 000, or > 10 000 students), geographic region, public
versus private status, competitiveness for admission (based on
percentage of applicants accepted), school smoking policy (for
college residences), and school smoking rate (divided into ter-
tiles). We used the generalised estimating equations (GEE)
approach to fitting the logistic regression models to account
appropriately for clustered outcomes arising in our sampling
scheme.20 21 Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence limits
are reported.
RESULTS
Characteristics of the sample
Table 1 shows the demographic characteristics of the 10 904
respondents and compares their age, sex, and racial distribu-
tion with the distributions of these characteristics among all
full time undergraduates at the 119 participating schools and
among a national sample of full time undergraduates.18
Respondents' age and race were comparable to the compari-
son populations, but a greater proportion of respondents were
female than in the comparison populations. Of the 119 schools
in the sample, 22 (18%) prohibited smoking everywhere on
campus. An additional 31 schools (26%) prohibited smoking
in private rooms in college residences but not everywhere on
campus.
Attitudes about tobacco control policies
A majority of students supported each of the seven proposed
policies (table 2). More than three quarters of students
supported a ban on smoking in all campus buildings, includ-
ing residence halls and dining areas. Nearly as many
supported restrictions on tobacco marketing on campus. Sixty
per cent supported banning tobacco sales on campus and half
favoured banning tobacco in campus bars.
Support for all policies was significantly stronger among
non-smokers than smokers (table 2). However, even among
smokers, a majority favoured five of the seven policies, includ-
ing smoke-free residence halls and dining areas, and bans on
tobacco sponsorship of campus social events and tobacco
advertising on campus. Table 2 also shows that among smok-
ers, support for each policy was inversely related to tobacco
consumption.
Additional support for smoke-free residences is found in
students' responses to questions about their preferences for
living quarters. Of the 39% of respondents who lived in a cam-
pus residence, 59% reported that their housing was designated

as smoke-free, and over half (58%) of those who did not live in
smoke-free housing stated that they would prefer to do so.
Factors associated with support for tobacco control
policies
Tables 3 and 4 display independent predictors of student sup-
port for the proposed tobacco control policies. Support for all
policies was most strongly associated with student smoking
status, even after adjustment for other student and college
level factors.
When these multivariate analyses were repeated among
current smokers only, support for all tobacco control policies
was greater among smokers who planned to quit in the next
30 days than among smokers not planning to quit (for exam-
ple, for prohibiting smoking in all campus buildings: adjusted
odds ratio (AOR) 1.58, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.23 to
2.03; p < 0.001). Support for smoking restrictions in student
residences, dining areas, campus bars, and all campus
buildings was greater among lighter smokers (< 10 cigarettes/
day) than among heavier smokers (for example, for prohibit-
ing smoking in all campus buildings: AOR 1.52, 95% CI 1.14 to
1.98; p < 0.01) and among occasional smokers compared with
daily smokers (AOR 1.39, 95% CI 1.08 to 1.82; p < 0.05). Sup-
port for marketing restrictions and for banning tobacco sales
on campus did not vary by intensity of tobacco use.
Tables 3 and 4 demonstrate that all policies were more
popular among females and married students than among
males or unmarried students. Student support for all policies
was higher at colleges in western states, at colleges with a
lower smoking prevalence, and at schools that had already
banned smoking in student residences.
Smoke-free policies for student residences and campus
buildings were also more popular among schools in the north
central states. These policies were less popular among
students who live in campus residences. Smoke-free bars had
more support among students in higher grades and among
students at smaller schools. Support for tobacco marketing
and sale restrictions, unlike smoke-free policies, varied by
race, being more popular among non-whites than whites.
These policies were also more popular at smaller schools. Age
was a factor only for one policy: tobacco sales restrictions.
Younger students were less supportive of this policy than older
students, independent of grade level.
DISCUSSION
To our knowledge, this is the first study to report college stu-
dents' opinions about the campus tobacco control policies rec-
ommended by the American College Health Association and
American Cancer Society. The study found strong support for
all proposed policies among a large, nationally representative
sample of US college students. College administrators and
policymakers may not have previously been aware of the
breadth and depth of student support for tobacco control poli-
cies. Our findings should reassure officials who may have been
concerned about student opposition to the policies.
As we hypothesised, support for tobacco control policies
was stronger among non-smokers than smokers. Even so,
most policies had substantial support among smokers,
because support was inversely related to tobacco consump-
tion, and 76% of the smokers in the sample were either occa-
sional smokers or light daily smokers. The multivariate analy-
ses indicated that opposition to tobacco control policies was

concentrated in the small subgroup of heavy daily smokers
who did not intend to quit. It is possible that the inverse rela-
tion between policy support and tobacco consumption may
apply to populations beyond college students. If so, the finding
would have special relevance for populations with few heavy
smokers, such as young adults in general. In these popula-
tions, support for tobacco control policies may be higher than
many policymakers assume if they use tobacco prevalence as
a rough measure of opposition to tobacco control policies.
Multivariate analyses further demonstrated that support
for proposed tobacco control policies was broad and strong in
all sociodemographic groups and types of colleges. Some col-
leges have voiced concern that the adoption of a smoke-free
policy in student residences might discourage prospective stu-
dents who smoke from choosing to attend the school. Our data
suggest otherwise. Even among smokers, 45% preferred a
smoke-free dorm policy, and the majority of students who
currently lived in a residence that permitted smoking stated a
preference for a smoke-free residence. We did observe that
students who lived in dormitories were less in favour of
smoke-free residence policies than students who lived in off-
campus housing. Students who do not live in dormitories may
find it easy to favour a policy that does not affect them, while
students who live in a dormitory may be more reluctant to
impose rules on classmates.
Support for tobacco control policies of all types was stronger
among students attending colleges with a low smoking preva-
lence. The relative absence of smokers on these campuses may
foster positive attitudes toward proposed tobacco control poli-
cies. Support for all types of tobacco control policies was also
stronger among students who reported that housing on their
campus was already smoke-free. One interpretation is that
students who live in smoke-free residences like them and may
find it easier to support additional tobacco restrictions. Alter-
nately, colleges with smoke-free residences may attract
students with more support for tobacco control policies.
Because this is a cross-sectional survey, it is impossible to dis-
tinguish between alternate interpretations of the finding.
Smoking bans in campus bars and prohibiting tobacco sales
on campus were the least popular tobacco control policies. This
may reflect the fact that both policies directly impact smokers.
Smoke-free bar policies make it difficult for students to smoke
in one of the last places where smoking has been allowed,
while banning tobacco sales on campus makes access to
tobacco products less convenient. In this context, smokers'
strong support for bans on smoking in campus buildings,
housing, and dining areas is remarkable. It probably reflects
students' perception of social norms about where smoking is
now acceptable in US society. It also reflects larger public
opinion; state and community smoke-free bar laws face
stronger opposition than do smoking bans for public places,
worksites, and restaurants.
Proposed restrictions on tobacco marketing, which have
little direct effect on students, had little opposition, even
among smokers. Tobacco company sponsorship of campus
events is a new tobacco industry strategy for recruiting young
adult smokers.6­8 It occurs widely and students who attend
these events have higher rates of tobacco use than students
who do not.9 Our survey suggests that students will not oppose
efforts to stop these promotional activities.
The prevalence of smoke-free dormitory policies in 2001 in
our sample (44%) was substantially higher than the 27%
prevalence observed in 1999 in a larger national sample of US
colleges.5 This apparent discrepancy probably represents an
increase in smoke-free policy adoption between 1999 and
2001. A survey of 50 US public universities conducted in 2001
found a doubling in the prevalence of smoke-free dormitories
between 1999 and 2001.13
The results of this study are subject to several limitations.
The survey response rate of 52% raises the potential for selec-
tion bias. However, the sociodemographic characteristics of

the sample resembled those of a national sample, and
response rates did not correlate with smoking prevalence or
differ between schools with and without smoke-free policies.
These facts suggest that selection bias is not a large concern.
Second, our results are generalisable to students enrolled in
US four-year colleges and universities but cannot be assumed
to represent the opinions of students attending two-year col-
leges. Nonetheless, the results do apply to a large number of
young adults--an estimated 5.3 million young adults attend
four-year colleges.2 Finally, because of survey length limita-
tions, we did not assess all proposed campus tobacco control
policies. We did not solicit student opinions of bans on smok-
ing outside building entrances or at all campus events, about
the provision of free smoking cessation treatment, or on free
distribution of tobacco products on campus.
In summary, this study elicited student opinions about a
range of policies and derived data from a large, random sam-
ple of students at a nationally representative sample of US
colleges. These data provide strong support for tobacco control
policymakers, advocates, and college administrators who are
considering whether to adopt policies to discourage tobacco
use among college students. Policy strategies are important for
the college population because of their broad reach. They can
discourage both the uptake and continuation of tobacco use
and they have the potential to affect a much larger number of
students than traditional smoking cessation interventions in
this setting. Future research should include surveillance of the
prevalence of college tobacco control policies, identification of
factors that facilitate and impede policy adoption, and evalua-
tion of the impact of specific tobacco control policies on
tobacco use prevalence. In the meantime, this study provides
support for adopting college tobacco control policies, which
should be a high priority for college administrators, public
health policymakers, and practitioners.

What this paper adds
Tobacco use among young adults in the USA rose through
the 1990s. One third of US young adults attend college,
making these institutions important channels for discourag-
ing tobacco use. The American College Health Association
and American Cancer Society have independently recom-
mended a similar set of tobacco control policies for college
campuses. Student opinion of these policies is not known,
and concern about student opposition deters some admin-
istrators from adopting the policies.
This survey of a large random sample of US college stu-
dents found strong support for the proposed college
tobacco control policies, even among smokers. These find-
ings should provide reassurance to college administrators
who are considering adopting the policies.

The Society for Research in Nicotine and Tobacco (SRNT) and World Health Organization
(WHO), in a collaborative initiative between public and private organisations, have
created a free internet based resource, www.treatobacco.net, for those working on the
treatment of tobacco dependence. This innovative project was started with a grant from three
pharmaceutical companies, GlaxoSmithKline, Novartis, and Pharmacia. Support has also
been received from the American Cancer Society, National Cancer Institute (US), and
National Institute on Drug Abuse (US), but support over the last year has come mainly from
the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation.
www.treatobacco.net presents evidence based information about the treatment of tobacco
dependence, under five headings: efficacy, safety, health, economics, policy, epidemiology, and
demographics and health effects. Each of these sections is chaired by an expert with a small
supporting team, the chairs being, respectively: Lindsay Stead, Neal Benowitz, Trevor
Woollery, Ann McNeill, and Corinne Husten. All information on the website is reviewed by an
independent editorial board chaired by Ron Davis, once head of the Office on Smoking and
Health in the USA and past editor of Tobacco Control.
The evidence is collated and reviewed by over 40 international experts and is periodically
updated to incorporate new research. Commentaries and supporting references accompany
key findings, with links to original sources for easy reference. Referenced power point slide
kits summarising this evidence can be downloaded from the site. It will be invaluable to cli-
nicians, researchers, teachers and policy makers, and is currently available, free, in 10
languages: English, Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and
Spanish. Arabic is being added now.
