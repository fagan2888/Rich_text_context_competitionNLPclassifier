ABSTRACT
NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors) mediate the pre-
dominantly excitatory neurotransmission in the CNS (central
nervous system). Excessive release of glutamate and overac-
tivation of NMDARs during brain ischemia and the hypoxia
process are causally linked to excitotoxicity and neuronal
damage. GluN3 subunits, the third member of the NMDAR
family with two isoforms, GluN3A and GluN3B, have been
confirmed to display an inhibitory effect on NMDAR ac-
tivity. However, the effect of GluN3 subunits in brain is-
chemia and hypoxia is not clearly understood. In the present
study, the influence of ischemia and hypoxia on GluN3 sub-
unit expression was observed by using the 2VO (two-vessel
occlusion) rat brain ischemia model and cell OGD (oxygen
and glucose deprivation) hypoxia model. It was found that
GluN3A protein expression in rat hippocampus and the pre-
frontal cortex was increased quickly after brain ischemia
and remained at a high level for at least 24 h. However,
the expression of the GluN3B subunit was not remark-
ably changed in both the animal and cell models. After
OGD exposure, rat hippocampal neurons with GluN3A sub-
unit overexpression displayed more viability than the wild-
type neurons. NG108-15 cells overexpressing GluN3A pre-
sented pronounced resistance to glutamate insult. Block-
ing the increase of intracellular Ca2 + concentration may
underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of up-regulated
GluN3A subunit. Suppressing the generation of hydroxyl rad-
icals and NO (nitric oxide) is probably also involved in the
neuroprotection.

INTRODUCTION
NMDARs (N-methyl-D-aspartate receptors) are ionotropic
glutamate receptors that mediate the vast majority of ex-
citatory neurotransmissions in the mammalian CNS (cen-
tral nervous system) and play critical roles in neurodevelop-
mental, neurophysiological and neuropathological processes
(Traynelis et al., 2010). Conventional NMDARs are believed to
form a heterotetramer between two GluN1 and GluN2 sub-
units and to require co-activation by glutamate and glycine.
The third member of the NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) fam-
ily, the GluN3 subunit, was discovered in 1995 (Ciabarra et al.,
1995; Sucher et al., 1995; Forcina et al., 1995). New evidence
shows that functional NMDARs are comprised of GluN1 and
at least one GluN2 subunit or of GluN1 and both GluN2 and
GluN3 subunits. The GluN3 subunit has been proven to dis-
play an inhibitory effect on NMDAR activity (Henson et al.,
2010; Low and Wee, 2010). Compared with NMDAR formed
by GluN1/GluN2 subunits, coexpression of GluN3 with GluN1
and GluN2 subunits decreases the amplitude of NMDAR cur-
rent, unitary conductance, Ca2 + permeability and Mg2 +
sensitivity (Sucher et al., 1995; Das et al., 1998; Nishi et al.,
2001; Chatterton et al., 2002; Matsuda et al., 2002; Sasaki
asnneuro.org / Volume 5 (4) / art:e00120 231
H. Wang and others
et al., 2002; Pina-Crespo et al., 2010). The GluN3 subunit has
two isoforms: GluN3A and GluN3B. Both show restricted spa-
tiotemporal distributions, with GluN3A being predominantly
expressed during early development, although the expression
in certain neuronal populations persists in adults (Wong et al.,
2002). GluN3B was once thought to be expressed only in mo-
toneurons (Nishi et al., 2001). However, it has been found to
be expressed in the rat hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cau-
doputamen, nucleus accumbens, cerebellum and lumbar sec-
tions of the spinal cord. This distribution is the same as that
of GluN1 (Wee et al., 2008).
Ischemic cerebrovascular disease is of great concern be-
cause of its high morbidity, mortality and pronounced ten-
dency to cause disability (Woodruff et al., 2011). The patho-
physiology of brain ischemia is complicated and involves
numerous processes, including increased intracellular Ca2 +
levels and excitotoxicity. During brain ischemia, glutamate
is released by reversed operation of glutamate uptake carri-
ers. The extracellular accumulation of glutamate activates
NMDARs and leads to an excessive Ca2 + influx through
NMDAR-operated channels, which disrupts neuronal intra-
cellular homeostasis and consequently triggers excitotoxic-
ity (Lipton and Rosenberg, 1994; Albrecht et al., 2010). The
GluN3 subunits can decrease excitotoxicity by depressing
NMDAR activity. Our previous study showed that the expres-
sion of GluN3A on rat hippocampus had a time-dependent
pattern. Resistance to ischemic injury was positively related
to the increased expression level of GluN3A in rat hippocam-
pus (Wang et al., 2012). Transgenic and knockout mice also
indicate the neuroprotective role of GluN3A (Nakanishi et al.,
2009). However, the effects and mechanism of GluN3 sub-
units that may perform during brain ischemia and hypoxia
remain unclear. In the present study, the influence of brain
hypoxia and ischemia on GluN3 expression was observed by
setting up a rat 2VO (two-vessel occlusion) brain ischemia and
hypoxia model and cell OGD (oxygen and glucose deprivation)
model. The effects of GluN3A subunits on brain hypoxia and
ischemia were observed using a GluN3A overexpression cell
model. The results revealed that the GluN3A subunit was up-
regulated during ischemia and hypoxia and exerted a neu-
roprotective effect against ischemia- and hypoxia-induced
neuronal damage. Blocking the rise of intracellular Ca2 + lev-
els may underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of GluN3A
subunits, and suppression of hydroxyl radicals and NO (nitric
oxide) generation may be also involved in the protection.
MATEREIALS AND METHODS
Animals
Male S­D (Sprague­Dawley) rats weighing 180­220 g were
maintained at a constant temperature (22 +
- 1C) and relative
humidity (50%) under a regular light­dark cycle (lights on
at 7 a.m. and off at 7 p.m.) with free access to food and
water. The animals were treated in accordance with the NIH
Guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals (1996)
and with those of the local ethical committee. All efforts were
made to minimize animal suffering and to reduce the number
of animals required.
Cells
Isolation of primary neurons from rat brains and
subsequent cell culture
Hippocampal and cortical neurons were isolated using a com-
bination of established methods (Kay and Wong 1986; Das
et al., 1998). Briefly, rats born within 12 h were decapitated
and the brains were promptly removed and placed in a stor-
age vessel with cooled HBSS (Hanks' balanced salt solution,
137 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaHCO3
, 0.35 mM Na2
HPO4
, 5.4 mM
KCl, 0.45 mM KH2
PO4
, 1.25 mM CaCl2
, 0.5 mM MgSO4
,
0.5 mM MgCl2
, 5 mM HEPES and 20 mM glucose, pH 7.4). Tis-
sues of the hippocampus and the prefrontal cortex were seg-
regated individually and enzymatically dissociated by 0.25%
Trypsin (Sigma). They were then mechanically dispersed into
a single-cell suspension and plated onto a 35 mm dish coated
with 0.1 mg/ml poly-L-lysine (Sigma) at high density (5×105
cells per 35 mm dish). Cells were maintained in neurobasal
medium supplemented with B27, 0.5 mM glutamine in the
incubator (37C, 8% CO2
) for 1­3 weeks and were used for
Western blot or transfection.
GluN3A overexpression
The GluN3A-pcDNA3.1( + ) plasmid, which had a copy
of the G418 resistance gene, was kindly donated by Dongx-
ian Zhang from the Sanford-Burnham Medical Research In-
stitute. As per the manufacturer's recommended protocol,
5 g of GluN3A-pcDNA3.1( + ) cDNA was transfected into
NG108-15 cells (5×106, about 85% confluence) in a 100 mm
dish with10 l of LipofectamineTM 2000 (Invitrogen). Clones
with resistance to G418 (800 g/ml) were selected and ex-
panded. The expression of GluN3A protein from these clones
was assessed using Western blot analysis. Stable transfec-
tion was achieved in NG108-15 cells. Wild-type and trans-
fected NG108-15 cells were grown in tissue culture as pre-
viously described (Adie and Milligan, 1994), except that the
transfected cells were also maintained in the presence of
G418 (800 g/ml). Control cells were transfected with the
pcDNA3.1( + ) plasmid without the GluN3A gene.
cDNA of GluN3A-pcDNA3.1( + ) (2 g) was transfected
into hippocampal neurons cultured in a 35 mm dish by us-
ing 4 l of LipofectamineTM 2000, as recommended, on the
sixth cultured day. Neurons were maintained in an incubator
(37C, 5% CO2
) for 42­48h followed by cell injury models.
The estimated transfection efficiency was about 15%, based
on the results of parallel control experiments by transfect-
ing GFP (green fluorescent protein)-containing plasmids into
neurons.

GluN3A subunit exerts a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia and hypoxia
Figure 1 The 2VO rat brain ischemia model was verified using laser Doppler flowmetry and TTC staining
(A) Animals with blood flow (FLUX1) reduced at least 50% were used as 2VO models. `FLUX1, DC1 and Speed' indicated blood flux,
intensity of all detected light and the mean speed of blood, respectively. (B) After 3 h of occlusion, only a small part (white part) of the
brain around the hippocampus was injured (left). Nearly the whole hippocampus was infarcted after 24 h of occlusion (right).
Rat brain ischemia and hypoxia models and cell
injury models
2VO in the rat brain ischemia and hypoxia model
Male S­D rats weighing 180­220 g (Animal Center,
AMMS) were anesthetized with 4% (w/v) chloral hy-
drate (5.5 mg/10 g, intraperitoneal injection) and surgically
prepared for use in the brain ischemia models according to
previously described methods (Cechetti et al., 2010). During
surgery, room temperature was maintained within 20­25C,
and two surgical lights were used for illumination and main-
tenance of the animals' normal temperature. Each surgery
was completed within 5 min. A sham operation was per-
formed on all control animals. Occlusion was verified by using
laser Doppler flowmetry (Moor) to monitor relative cerebral
blood. As shown in Figure 1(A), animals in which blood flow
was reduced by at least 50% were used as 2VO models. TTC
(2,3,5-triphenyltetrazolium chloride) staining was also per-
formed to determine the severity of brain injury. Infarcted
tissue could not be stained with TTC and was white after TTC
staining. As shown in Figure 1(B), only a small part of the
brain around the hippocampus was injured (left) after 3 h
of occlusion. Nearly the whole hippocampus was infarcted
after 24 h of occlusion (right). The animals were killed after
brain ischemia lasting different periods of time and the brain
tissues were frozen for storage in liquid nitrogen.
Cell OGD model
Rat hippocampal and prefrontal cortex neurons were cul-
tured for 25 days and treated under OGD exposure condi-
tions modified according to a previously described method
(Zhang et al., 2011) with 300 mM sodium dithionite in the
glucose-free Earle's medium (122 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl,
2.6 mM NaH2
PO4
, 0.8 mM MgSO4
, 1.8 mM CaCl2
, 26.2 mM
NaHCO3
and 20.1 mM HEPES) for 4 h. The wild-type cells and
OGD cells were collected after OGD exposure and used for
Western blot analysis.
Glutamate injury in NG108 cells
NG108-15 cells were exposed to 100 M glutamate (Sigma)
with 10 M glycine (Sigma) for 30 min in an incubator (37C,
5% CO2
) to induce excitotoxicity as described previously
(Gonzalez et al., 1998). Exposure was terminated by replace-
ment with growth media. Cell death assessments were per-
formed later. For groups treated with MK-801, a selective
and non-competitive NMDAR antagonist (Wong et al., 1986),
100 M MK-801, was added 30 min before glutamate injury.
Analysis of NMDAR subunit protein
Brain tissue protein and cell protein preparation
In all experiments, for protein preparation, 100 l of cold
RIPA lysis buffer [50 mM Tris-acetate, 150 mM NaCl, 1%
(v/v) NP-40, 0.1% (w/v) SDS, pH 7.4] and freshly mixed pro-
tease inhibitor cocktail (1 mM PMSF, 20 g/ml benzamidine,
10 M leupeptin and 1 M pepstatin) was added to 10 mg of
dissected brain tissue or 1×106 cells. The brain tissue in the
lysis buffer was homogenized in a Potter homogenizer (cells
were not needed for this step). After lysis in ice for 20 min,
tubes containing the tissue homogenates or cells were cen-
trifuged at 12000 g for 15 min at 4C. The supernatants
were moved to new tubes and subsequently frozen for stor-
age at - 80C. The protein concentrations were determined
by using a BCA (bicinchoninic acid) protein assay (Thermo

Scientific), and 50­100 g of protein was loaded for SDS gel
electrophoresis.
Western blot hybridization
In brief, SDS/PAGE was used to separate proteins that
were then transferred to PVDF membranes. Membranes were
blocked in TBST [tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% (v/v)
Tween-20] and 5% (w/v) non-fat dried skimmed milk pow-
der for 1 h at room temperature and incubated with primary
antibodies for GluN1 (1:4000, Abcam, ab17345), GluN2B
(1:1000, Millipore, Cat. #06-600), GluN3A (1:2000, Upstate
Biochemicals, Cat. #07-356), GluN3B (1:2000, Upstate Bio-
chemicals, Cat. #07-351) and -actin (1:10000) overnight at
4C, respectively. Before incubation of an HRP (horseradish
peroxidase)-conjugated secondary antibody with membranes
at room temperature for 1 h, membranes were washed three
times (10 min each) with TBST to remove unbound pri-
mary antibodies. Then membranes were washed three times
(10 min each) with TBST and bands were identified by use of
the ECL (enhanced chemiluminescence) Plus Western blotting
detection system (Kodak). Images were scanned and quanti-
fied using ImageJ software (version 1.33 u; National Institutes
of Health, Bethesda, MD, U.S.A.).
Analysis of RNA of GluN3A
RNA extraction
Total RNA was extracted using Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen)
according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The yield
of total RNA was determined by measuring the absorbance
(260­280 nm) of ethanol-precipitated aliquots of the sam-
ples by using spectrophotometer (Pharmacia). Isolated RNA
was finally frozen at - 80C until further processing.
RT (reverse transcription)
A PrimeScript® RT reagent Kit with gDNA (genomic DNA)
Eraser (TaKaRa) was used. gDNA in samples was eliminated
first. The reaction mixture (10 l) contained 1 g of total
RNA, 1 l of gDNA Eraser, 2 l of 5×Buffer and RNase-free
H2
O. Reactions were performed for 2 min at 42C. Then the
purified RNA samples were reverse transcribed. Each mixture
(20 l) contained 1 g of total RNA, 4 l of 5×RT buffer,
1 l of PrimeScript RT Enzyme Mix, 1 l of RT Primer Mix
and RNase-free H2
O. Reactions were performed for 15 min
at 37C, and terminated by 5 s at 85C. The reaction mix-
ture was maintained at - 20C until it was used for PCR
amplification.
qRT-PCR (quantitative real-time PCR)
qRT-PCR of GluN3A mRNA was performed in trip-
licate using gene-specific primers and SYBR Green
(SYBR Premix Ex TaqTM, TaKaRa). Oligonucleotide primers
were designed by using Primer Express 3.0 soft-
ware (Applied Biosystems). The primer sequences of
GluN3A were P1:5 -CTTCCATGCTGGATCGTCTGT-3 and P2:5 -
TCTTGAACTTGATTGGCACTGTGT-3 . As an internal control for
normalization, PCRs were performed concurrently with the
amplification of a reference gene, -actin with the primers
P3:5 -GGGAAATCGTGCGTGACATT-3 and P4:5 -GCGGCAGT-
GGCCATCTC-3 . Real-time PCR was performed on CFX96
TouchTM Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with the
following thermal cycler settings: 40 cycles of 30 s at 95C
and 30 s at 63C. The reaction mixture (25 l) consisted of
0.5 l of cDNA (1 g), 5 nM of each primer, 12.5 l of SYBR
Ex Taq and 11 l of RNase-free H2
O. The relative change in
the mRNA expression studied after ischemia was determined
using Bio-Rad Manager TM Software.
Analysis of cell resistance to injury with
overexpressing GluN3A
PI/DAPI double stain
DAPI (Sigma) is a blue fluorescent dye that stains the con-
densed chromatin in apoptotic cells more brightly than
normal chromatin. PI (Sigma), a red fluorescent dye, only
permeates dead cells. The double stain provides a rapid and
convenient way of assaying normal, apoptotic and dead cells.
After OGD exposure, double staining was performed directly
on living cells without fixation, as follows: DAPI and PI were
added to the culture medium at a final concentration of
1 g/ml for each reagent and incubated for 10 min at 37C
in the dark. Medium containing floating cells was gently
removed and cells were observed using fluorescence mi-
croscopy (Olympus). Three separate experiments were per-
formed. For each experiment, and each incubation time, at
least three microscopic fields were photographed.
MTT assay
The MTT assay is commonly used to assess cell viability (Hen-
gartner, 2000). After cell injury, 10 l of MTT (Amresco)
suspended in PBS (5 mg/ml) was added to each well and
incubated for 4 h at 37C in the dark. MTT solution was
then aspirated and formazan was instantly dissolved by the
addition of 150 l of DMSO. The absorption was read with
the multi-label counter (Tecan). Three separate experiments
were performed. For each experiment, each data point was
assessed in at least five replications.
FCM (flow cytometry) assay
An Annexin V-FITC apoptosis kit (Saibao) was used. After
digestion with 0.25% trypsin, cells were gathered and rinsed
with ice-cold PBS and then resuspended in 200 l of binding
buffer according to the manufacturer's instructions. Then
10 l of Annexin V stock solutions were added to the cells and
incubated for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. After

15 min incubation, 300 l of binding buffer with 5 l of PI
was added to the cell mixture. The mixture was immediately
analyzed by using FCM (BD).
Analysis of anti-injury mechanisms
Ca2 + imaging assay
Cells were loaded with the fluorescent Ca2 + indicator fluo4-
AM (Invitrogen). According to the manufacturer's instruc-
tions, the medium was replaced with HBSS containing 2 M
fluo4-AM and returned to the incubator (37C, 5% CO2
). Af-
ter 30 min of incubation, cells were rinsed three times with
HBSS and placed on the stage of a laser scanning confocal
microscope (PerkinElmer). Images of cells were obtained and
analyzed using the Velocity imaging system (version 6.0.1).
Before glutamate injury, images were obtained for several
minutes to establish a stable baseline Ca2 + measurement.
Then 100 M glutamate and 10 M glycine were applied,
and images were obtained at 2 s intervals.
NO measurement and hydroxyl radical measurement
A NO assay kit (Jiancheng) and hydroxyl radical assay kit
(Jiancheng) were used independently to monitor the NO and
hydroxyl radicals in cells after glutamate injury. Procedures

GluN3A subunit exerts a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia and hypoxia
Figure 5 Double staining of hippocampal neurons with DAPI (D) and PI with or without OGD exposure
The row number of 1, 2, and 3 represented control cells without OGD, control neurons with OGD, and GluN3A overexpressed neurons
with OGD exposure, respectively. The capital letters for each column indicated the morphological pictures of neurons (A), neurons with
DAPI stained (B), PI stained (C) and merging (D) of two images, respectively. Neurons with DAPI and PI staining distinguished the typical
features of apoptosis (fragmented bright D+ /PI- ), necrosis (D- /PI+ or weak D+ /PI+ ), and normal (D+ /PI- ). Merging (D) of the
two images of (B) and (C) allowed detection of double-stained cells and indication of late apoptosis and dead neurons. The results
suggested that hippocampal neurons overexpressing GluN3A subunits were more resistant to OGD exposure induced injury than wild-type
cells.
those observed in the hippocampus, of which changes of
GluN3B protein levels were not significant, GluN1 expression
showed little increase, whereas GluN2B decreased at first,
increased after 3 h, peaked at 6 h, and decreased to original
levels at 24 h after ischemia.
Real-time PCR and Western blot revealed a quick increase
in GluN3A mRNA (F = 30.37, P < 0.01, n = 5, Figure 2E) and
protein levels (F = 94.40, P < 0.01, n = 5, Figure 2F) in the

in vitro. Here, we exposed two different kinds of neurons,
hippocampal (Figure 3A) and prefrontal cortex neurons (Fig-
ure 3B) to OGD and investigated changes in the level of
protein expression of NMDAR subunits by using Western
blot analysis. It was found that GluN3A increased after ex-
posure to OGD by 160 +
- 5 and 170 +
- 4% (P<0.01, n = 3)
in hippocampal and prefrontal cortex neurons, respectively,
relative to the control group. No significant changes in
GluN3B were observed in either type of neuron. Protein
levels of GluN1 increased by 122 +
- 7% (P < 0.01, n = 3)
and 109 +
- 1%, respectively, relative to controls. GluN2B de-
creased by about 50% (P<0.01, n = 3) in these two kinds of
cells.
Resistance to injury of cells overexpressing
GluN3A
To observe the protective effect of the GluN3A subunit
against ischemia and hypoxia, cells with GluN3A overexpres-
sion were achieved by transfection of GluN3A-pcDNA3.1( + )
plasmid into rat hippocampal neurons and NG108-15 cells,
respectively. Western blot showed that GluN3A overexpres-
sion was achieved on rat hippocampal neurons (Figure 4A)
and NG108-15 cells (Figure 4B), with the overexpressed effi-
ciency of 25 and 80%, respectively.

Figure 6 Relative ratio of cell death of hippocampal neurons (A) after
OGD injury and NG108-15 cells (B) after glutamate injury was
determined by MTT assay
The sample absorbance was converted to relative death ratio. Data are pre-
sented as means +
- S.E.M., **P<0.01, *P<0.05 compared with vector alone
(control).
The cell OGD model and glutamate injury model were used
to compare the cell viability with and without GluN3A trans-
fection. Hippocampal neurons overexpressing GluN3A sub-
units were more resistant to injury than wild-type cells as
indicated by PI/DAPI double-stain results after OGD expo-
sure (Figure 5).
MTT assay revealed that, among wild-type hippocampal
neurons, OGD insult killed 31.7 +
- 2.5% of the cells. However,
among the cells overexpressing GluN3A, the cell death rate
attributable to OGD insult was only 10.7 +
- 1.2% (Figure 6A).
As shown in Figure 6(B), MTT assay showed that NG108-
15 cells overexpressing GluN3A were more resistant to
glutamate injury than wild-type cells. In NG108-15 cells
without overexpressing GluN3A, glutamate insult resulted
in a 25.4 +
- 1.5% death rate. The death rate dropped to
15.0 +
- 1.7% when the cells were pretreated with non-
competitive NMDAR antagonist MK-801. Among NG108-15
cells overexpressing GluN3A, glutamate insult caused a death
rate of only 9.6 +
- 0.9%. And the death rate was further low-
ered to 4.8 +
- 0.7% when MK-801 was also applied. The death
rates of the three test groups were all significantly different
from the control group (Figure 6B, F = 97.16, P<0.01, n = 3).
FCM also indicated a lower death rate among GluN3A
transfected cells subjected to glutamate insult (Figure 7). Cell
death attributable to glutamate insult in wild-type NG108-
15 cells, wild-type NG108-15 cells pretreated with MK-
801, NG108-15 cells overexpressing GluN3A, and NG108-15
cells overexpressing GluN3A pretreated with MK-801 were
28.7 +
- 1.7, 16.2 +
- 1.8, 9.7 +
- 1.2 and 8.5 +
- 0.8%, respectively.
The death rates among the three test groups were all sig-
nificantly lower than that of the control group (Figure7B,
F = 127.4, P<0.01, n = 3). The group overexpressing GluN3A
with MK-801 pretreatment showed the highest viability.
However, the changes of apoptosis ratio displayed a different
characteristic (Figure 7C). Only NG108-15 cells overexpress-
ing GluN3A presented an apoptosis ratio (9.3 +
- 0.7%) lower
than that of control group (16.5 +
- 0.5%, P<0.01, n = 3). MK-
801 had no effect on the apoptosis induced by glutamate in-
sult in NG108-15 cells without overexpressing GluN3A with
the ratio of 16.6 +
- 0.6%, and even increased the apop-
tosis ratio of NG108-15 cells overexpressing GluN3A from
9.3 +
- 0.7 to 12.4 +
- 1.0% (P<0.01).
Generation of hydroxyl radicals and NO in
NG108-15 cells overexpressing GluN3A after
glutamate injury
Fluo4-AM served as a Ca2 + indicator and was used to monitor
changes in intracellular Ca2 + levels after glutamate insult.
Wild-type cells turned bright green quickly, indicating influx
of large amounts of Ca2 + into cells (Figures 8A and 8B).
However no such obvious changes occurred in cells overex-
pressing GluN3A or cells pretreated with MK-801. This sug-
gested that cells overexpressing GluN3A were less permeable
to Ca2 + . Figures 8(D) and 8(E) show changes in the concen-
trations of hydroxyl radicals and NO after glutamate injury in
each group. Compared with wild-type cells, the concentra-
tions of hydroxyl radicals and NO level in cells overexpress-
ing GluN3A decreased from 567 +
- 14 and 49.7 +
- 1.6% to
437 +
- 8.6 and 28.0 +
- 1% after glutamate insult, respectively
(P<0.05, n = 3).
DISCUSSION
The GluN3 subunits (GluN3A and GluN3B) are newly rec-
ognized players in the well-established field of NMDARs.
GluN3A protein has been shown to be widely expressed in
the postnatal and adult mammalian CNS (Wong et al., 2002;
Wang et al., 2012). GluN3B was once thought to be expressed
only in motoneurons (Nishi et al., 2001). However, new evi-
dence reveals that GluN3B is also expressed in the CNS, such
as the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, caudoputamen, nucleus
accumbens, cerebellum and lumbar sections of the spinal
cord (Wee et al., 2008). Compared with conventional NM-
DARs comprised of GluN1/GluN2 subunits, GluN3-containing
NMDARs exhibit several different properties, including lower
amplitude currents and lower Ca2 + permeability (Low and
Wee, 2010; Henson et al., 2010), which suggest that GluN3
subunits play a negative modulation role on NMDAR activity.

Several review articles have summarized the functions of
the GluN3A subunit. Specifically, it influences the dendritic
spine density, synapse maturation, memory consolidation and
cell survival, and it may be involved in certain neuropatholo-
gies (Henson et al., 2010; Low and Wee, 2010). The neuro-
protective roles of GluN3A subunits have also been proved
(Nakanishi et al., 2009; Wang et al, 2012). Cultured neu-
rons prepared using GluN3A-knockout mice display greater
sensitivity to damage from NMDA, and cultured neurons
expressing transgenic GluN3A display greater resistance to
NMDA-mediated neurotoxicity than the wild-type neurons.
Similarly, in vivo, adult GluN3A transgenic mice subjected
to focal cerebral ischemia show less damage than wild-type
mice.
The expression of GluN3A subunits shows a temporal pro-
file (Wong et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2012). From postnatal

day 7 (P7) to P21, there is an obvious decrease in the pro-
tein levels of GluN3A, which remains low into adulthood
(Wong et al., 2002). It is clear that the low expression of
GluN3A in the physiological condition will hinder its func-
tion to execute. Therefore it is worthwhile exploring what
happens to GluN3A subunits during brain ischemia and hy-
poxia. In the present experiment, the influence of brain is-
chemia and hypoxia on the expression of GluN3A protein is
examined using the rat 2VO model and cell OGD models. It is
found that, among all the NMDAR subunits, only GluN3A pro-
tein expression is raised remarkably in the hippocampus and
the prefrontal cortex. GluN1 expression shows little increase,
whereas GluN2B expression decreases at first, increases after
3 h, and retunes to the original level at 24 h after ischemia.
However, the expression of GluN3B subunit remains stable in
the animal and cell models (Figures 2 and 3). The increased
expression of GluN3A subunit protein could be detected only
10 min after occlusion, and remains at a high level for at
least 24 h. As the expression of GluN3B protein does not
show any visible changes during brain ischemia and hypoxia,
it is suggested that the GluN3B subunit is probably not in-
volved in the pathological processes evoked by ischemia and
hypoxia.
In the present study, it is demonstrated that the expres-
sion of GluN3A is inducible during the ischemia and hypoxia
process. The quick up-regulated expression of GluN3A makes
it credible that GluN3A could play a neuroprotective func-
tion. Coincidently, other scientists (Mart´
inez-Turrillas et al.,
2012) have also proved that the expression of GluN3A sub-
units protects vulnerable populations of striatal neurons from
excitotoxic damage caused by the mitochondrial neurotoxin
3-NP. They also show that GluN3A-mediated neuroprotection

GluN3A subunit exerts a neuroprotective effect in brain ischemia and hypoxia
is dose-dependent, which is also consistent with our previous
results (Wang et al., 2012).
To evaluate the effects of up-regulated GluN3A subunits
in the brain under ischemic and hypoxic conditions, overex-
pression cell models are made. We compare cell viability of
rat hippocampal neurons exposed to OGD with and without
GluN3A transfection. The hippocampal neurons overexpress-
ing GluN3A present more pronounced ability of resisting cel-
lular damage than the wild-type neurons in the OGD model.
To verify that the protective function is directly related to
suppressing NMDARs and reducing neural excitotoxicity, we
compared the viability of NG108-15 cells with glutamate in-
sult with and without GluN3A transfection. NG108-15 cells
overexpressing GluN3A display a lower injury rate than the
wild-type cells exposed to glutamate. Both MTT and FCM
assays display the lowest death rate in NG108-15 cells over-
expressing GluN3A with pretreatment of MK-801, a non-
competitive NMDAR antagonist. The results are consistent
with previous reports (Chrysanthy et al., 1999; Pohl et al.,
1999) that MK-801 might induce neuroprotection. They also
proved that MK-801 could increase neuronal apoptosis in
the immature brain, which is consistent with our findings
that the apoptotic rate of cells pretreated with MK-801 is
higher than those without MK-801 pretreatment in GluN3A
overexpressing cells after glutamate insult (Figure 7).
The pathophysiology of brain ischemia is complicated and
involves numerous processes and mechanisms. Ca2 + over-
loading has been confirmed to trigger excitotoxicity and re-
sult in neuron damage during the brain ischemia process.
Because excessive Ca2 + influx into neurons is a crucial step
for excitotoxicity, we investigate the influence of GluN3A
overexpression on the intracellular Ca2 + concentration. Ad-
ministration of glutamate and glycine is found to markedly
increase intracellular Ca2 + levels in wild-type NG108-15
cells. When cells are pretreated with MK-801, the influx of
Ca2 + is totally suppressed, suggesting that the increase in
intracellular Ca2 + levels is predominantly evoked by activa-
tion of NMDARs. The increase in intracellular Ca2 + levels also
nearly disappears in GluN3A overexpressed NG108-15 cells
(Figure 8A). It is suggested that suppression of the increase in
intracellular Ca2 + levels may be the cause of the neuropro-
tective mechanism of GluN3A. It is known that GluN1/GluN3
channels are less permeable to Ca2 + than the conventional
NMDARs. Activation of GluN1/GluN3 receptors evoke far
less Ca2 + -triggered Cl2
current than GluN1/GluN2 recep-
tors when Ca2 + is present in the external solutions (Chatter-
ton et al., 2002). Our results imply that the NMDARs exhibit
dramatically decreased Ca2 + permeability when excessive
GluN3A subunits present in cells. Of course more evidence
is needed to demonstrate the existence and increase of NM-
DARs comprised of GluN1/GluN3 or GluN1/GluN2/GluN3.
Since high levels of hydroxyl radical and NO are involved in
ischemia-induced neuron damage, we also evaluated changes
of hydroxyl radical and NO concentrations in cells overex-
pressing GluN3A. Our results reveal that cells overexpressing
GluN3A show much lower concentrations of hydroxyl radi-
cals and NO than wild-type cells after glutamate exposure
(Figures 8D and 8E). It is suggested that suppression of hy-
droxyl radicals and NO generation may also be involved in cell
protection because the expression of GluN3A is up-regulated
during ischemia and hypoxia.
In conclusion, our results demonstrate that brain ischemia
and hypoxia could induce rapid up-regulation of the expres-
sion of the GluN3A subunit, but not the GluN3B subunit.
Overexpression of GluN3A could play a neuroprotective role
during the pathophysiological processes of ischemia and hy-
poxia. Blocking the increase in intracellular Ca2 + concentra-
tion may underlie the neuroprotective mechanism of GluN3A,
and suppression of hydroxyl radicals and NO generation may
also be involved in the neuroprotection.
