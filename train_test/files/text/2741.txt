Abstract
Background: Sodas are widely sold in vending machines and other school venues in the United States, particularly in high
school. Research suggests that policy changes have reduced soda access, but the impact of reduced access on consumption
is unclear. This study was designed to identify student, environmental, or policy characteristics that modify the associations
between school vending machines and student dietary behaviors.
Methods: Data on school vending machine access and student diet were obtained as part of the National Youth Physical
Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS) and linked to state-level data on soda taxes, restaurant taxes, and state laws
governing the sale of soda in schools. Regression models were used to: 1) estimate associations between vending machine
access and soda consumption, fast food consumption, and lunch source, and 2) determine if associations were modified by
state soda taxes, restaurant taxes, laws banning in-school soda sales, or student characteristics (race/ethnicity, sex, home
food access, weight loss behaviors.)
Results: Contrary to the hypothesis, students tended to consume 0.53 fewer servings of soda/week (95% CI: -1.17, 0.11) and
consume fast food on 0.24 fewer days/week (95% CI: -0.44, -0.05) if they had in-school access to vending machines. They
were also less likely to consume soda daily (23.9% vs. 27.9%, average difference = -4.02, 95% CI: -7.28, -0.76). However, these
inverse associations were observed primarily among states with lower soda and restaurant tax rates (relative to general food
tax rates) and states that did not ban in-school soda sales. Associations did not vary by any student characteristics except for
weight loss behaviors.
Conclusion: Isolated changes to the school food environment may have unintended consequences unless policymakers
incorporate other initiatives designed to discourage overall soda consumption.

Introduction
Sugar-sweetened beverage (SSB) consumption has become one
of the primary targets of childhood obesity prevention efforts in the
United States (U.S.) [1]. The negative health effects of SSB
consumption are well-documented [2,3], including recent ran-
domized trials that found SSB consumption was associated with
higher weight gain [4,5]. Sodas are the most popular SSB among
adolescents in the U.S. [6,7] and were the biggest source of
calories of any food/beverage group among 14­18 year-olds in
2005­06 [8]. Recent evidence suggests that adolescents have
gradually been replacing soda with other SSBs, but soda remains
the most heavily consumed sweetened beverage [6].
Numerous policy initiatives have been proposed to reduce
consumption of soda and other SSBs, including taxes, marketing
regulations, limits on portion sizes, and limits on sugar content [9­
12]. One of the most widespread initiatives is banning the sale of
SSBs within schools [13,14]. Evidence at all grade levels suggests
that policies that ban SSBs have succeeded in reducing students'
access to SSBs [15­18], though policies at the high school level
tend to focus exclusively on soda. Nationally, the proportion of
high school students who could purchase soda in school declined
steadily from 53.6% in 2006­07 to 25.3% in 2010­11, but most
high school students could purchase some type of SSB in school in
2010­11 (87.8%) [19].

Policies have achieved their direct goal of reducing SSB access,
but there is relatively little evidence that such changes influence
students' consumption of soda or overall SSBs. Several studies
reported that consumption was unaffected [16,20­22] even if
policies reduced in-school access [16]. These studies utilized
several independent data sources that sampled students nation-
wide. In contrast, however, studies in specific states or districts
reported that sweetened beverage restrictions succeeded in
reducing sweetened beverage intake [23,24].
These inconsistent findings could be explained by numerous
demographic, behavioral, environmental, or policy characteristics.
Previous studies have already suggested that the effects of policies
on student behavior may be modified by race/ethnicity [21,22], or
whether the policy targets SSBs other than soda [16] and whether
it targets all school venues [24,25]. Additionally, experts have
pointed out that students can easily obtain SSBs from other
sources (e.g., home, convenience stores) [10,20,26] and thus
improvements to the school food environment may be less
successful among students who have more access outside of
school. The impact of school nutrition policies could also depend
on whether school-based changes are complemented by policies in
other sectors (e.g., soda taxes). Finally, health consciousness could
play a role, as a recent study of calorie labels found that this
initiative was more effective among consumers who were less
health conscious [27].
To enhance school policy effectiveness, policymakers must
consider how effects are modified by factors at the individual,
local, or state level. The objective of this study was to determine if
the association between school vending machine access and soda
consumption varies by demographic, environmental, or policy
measures in a nationally representative sample of high school
students. We further analyzed dietary behaviors outside of school
(e.g., fast food consumption) to assess whether students who do not
have access to vending machines in school obtain more unhealthy
foods/beverages elsewhere.
Methods
This cross-sectional study linked student data from the National
Youth Physical Activity and Nutrition Study (NYPANS), con-
ducted by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
in Spring 2010, with state-level data on soda taxes, restaurant
taxes, and laws governing the sale of soda in schools, collected as
part of the Bridging the Gap (BTG) research program. The study
was approved by the Institutional Review Boards of the University
of Illinois at Chicago and the University of Texas Health Science
Center at Houston.
Student sample
The objective of NYPANS was to measure diet, physical
activity, and sedentary behaviors, and environmental determinants
of such behaviors, in a nationally representative of 9th­12th grade
students [28]. Students were sampled using a 3-stage cluster
sample design; school and student participation was voluntary, and
local permission procedures were followed. The school response
rate was 82%, the student response rate was 88%, and the overall
response rate was 73%. In total, 10887 public school students
participated in NYPANS.
For the purpose of our study, students were excluded because
they were missing data on vending machine access within school
(n = 691), soda consumption (n = 42), fast food consumption
(n = 10), lunch source (n = 496), or other variables of interest
(n = 209), or if they were unsure if vending machines that sold
sweetened beverages were available in school (n = 1194). Students
who were excluded did not differ from the study sample with
respect to weight status, soda consumption, or gender, but they
were more likely to be racial/ethnic minorities (p,0.001), tended
to be in lower grade levels (p,0.001), were less likely to have
access to vending machines (p,0.001), were more likely to obtain
lunch away from home/school (p = 0.02) and reported more fast
food intake (p,0.001). The final study sample included 8245
students in 27 states.
Student-level measures
All data were obtained using a written questionnaire completed
in class. The independent variable of interest was whether the
school had ``a vending machine that students can use to purchase
soda or pop, sports drinks, or fruit drinks that are not 100% juice,
such as Coke, Gatorade, or Sunny Delight?'' Hereafter, we use the
term ``vending machines'' to refer specifically to this type of
vending machine.
Our dependent variables of interest were soda consumption, fast
food consumption, and whether students obtained their lunch
away from home or school on schooldays. We focused only on
soda, not other SSBs, because soda has been the primary target of
policy changes on the high school level. Soda consumption was
modeled as both a continuous measure of the number of servings
consumed in the past 7 days (ranging from none to ``4 or more per
day'') and a binary measure of whether students consumed at least
one soda per day in the past 7 days (hereafter referred to as ``daily
consumption''). The questionnaire explicitly told students to report
consumption of diet soda separately; analyses in this study only
utilized data on regular soda consumption. Fast food was modeled
as a continuous measure of the number of days in which students
consumed fast food in the past 7 days. Students were instructed to
include consumption of soda and fast food from all sources
regardless of time or location.
Analyses for this study also utilized data on race/ethnicity, sex,
grade, availability of food at home, and weight loss behaviors.
Students' race/ethnicity was categorized as non-Hispanic White
(ref), non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and non-Hispanic Other.
Home food access was categorized based on whether students
usually or always had access to fruits/vegetables or unhealthy
snacks (``chips, cookies, or cake'') at home; we cross-classified
students as having access to fruits/vegetables only (ref), unhealthy
snacks only, both, or neither. Weight loss behaviors were
measured using a series of 10 questions that asked students if
they had tried to lose weight in the past 30 days through various
behaviors. For our purpose, we classified 5 of the 10 behaviors as
healthy (exercising, consuming less food or fewer high-fat foods,
consuming fewer calories, consuming more fruits/vegetables,
drinking more water) and the remaining 5 as unhealthy (skipping
meals, fasting, smoking, vomiting or taking laxatives, taking diet
pills/powders/liquids without a doctor's advice). Note that these
classifications reflect the general health of the behaviors, not the
behaviors' effectiveness as weight loss methods. Students were then
grouped into 3 mutually exclusive categories of weight loss
behavior ­ those trying to lose weight only through healthy
behaviors, those trying to lose weight through at least one
unhealthy behavior, and those not trying to lose weight.
We considered analyzing whether the association between
vending machine access and dietary behaviors varied by weight
status (normal weight, overweight, obese) based on height and
weight data obtained by CDC staff. However, this analysis was
dropped because the quantity of missing height/weight data was
relatively large and exploratory analyses suggested that the
associations of interest did not vary by weight status.

State data
The study included analyses of whether the associations of
interest varied by state tax rates for soda sold in grocery stores,
state tax rates for foods sold in restaurants, or state laws governing
the availability of soda in all school venues. Tax rates were
compiled from state statutory and administrative law using
primary legal research methods [29,30] and were confirmed by
the state [31,32]. They were modeled as a continuous measure of
the difference between soda/restaurant tax rates versus the general
food tax rates (i.e., ``disfavored'' amount) [33]. Laws regarding the
availability of soda in high school vending machines, school stores,
and cafeterias (a la carte) in the 2009­10 school year were
obtained from the Westlaw and Lexis-Nexis legal research
databases and verified against secondary sources [34­36]. Laws
for the 3 venues were combined to create one binary indicator of
whether the state prohibited soda in all 3 venues. Of the 27 states
that were sampled as part of NYPANS, eight banned soda in high
schools in the 2009­10 school year; of these 8, four states
implemented the ban starting in 2009­10 and four states
implemented the ban prior to 2009­10. We explored categorizing
states based on the length of their ban, but judged that the sample
sizes were insufficient for such an analysis.
Both the state tax rate data and the state laws governing soda
availability in schools were compiled by the Bridging the Gap
research program at the University of Illinois at Chicago.
Statistical analysis
Due to their respective distributions, the 4 dependent variables
were analyzed using different types of regression models ­ a
negative binomial model for total servings of soda in the past 7
days, a Poisson model for fast food consumption in the past 7 days,
and a logistic model for daily soda consumption and lunch source.
All analyses accounted for the complex sampling design in
NYPANS and utilized the `margin' command in Stata, Version
12, to calculate the average marginal effects (AME) of interest.
First, we estimated the association between vending machine
access and each dependent variable. Students with no access to
school vending machines were the referent, and thus the
parameters of interest were hypothesized to be positive (e.g.,
higher soda consumption in students with access to school vending
machines). These models controlled for race/ethnicity, sex, grade,
home food access, state median household income (obtained from
the 2010 Census), and Census region (Northeast, Midwest, South,
West).
Subsequently, we added interaction terms between vending
machine access and race/ethnicity, sex, grade, home food access,
weight loss behaviors, disfavored soda tax (when modeling soda),
disfavored restaurant tax (when modeling fast food and lunch
source), and state law banning soda in all school venues.
Interaction terms for each variable were modeled separately.
When modeling interactions with variables that were not in the
original model (e.g., soda tax), the main effect of these variables
was also added. Weight loss behavior was initially modeled as a 3-
category variable, as described earlier, but we combined 2 of the
categories ­ students who were trying to lose weight through
unhealthy behaviors and students who were not trying to lose
weight ­ after analyses revealed that the associations of interest
were virtually identical in these 2 groups. When modeling
interactions with state taxes and state soda bans, Census region
was modeled as a 3-category variable (South/Midwest, Northeast,
West) due to the limited distributions of region within categories of
state taxes/laws. Home food access was removed from models that
included state soda taxes because it may mediate any effect of taxes
on soda consumption.
One state, Colorado, was excluded from all analyses of lunch
source because it had an extraordinarily high proportion of
students who obtained lunch away from school or home (42.0%,
versus 6.1% in the remaining sample) and had unusually high
leverage as a result.
Results
Table 1 displays characteristics of the study sample overall and
by vending machine access. Nearly all categorical measures had
similar distributions regardless of vending machine access. The
exception was that students with vending machines were more
likely to be from the Midwest (30.0%) and less likely to be from the
Northeast (11.1%) relative to students without vending machines
(15.8% and 24.9%, respectively.) Students without vending
machines were less likely to be obese but more likely to be
overweight, and they reported slightly more servings of fast food
and soda, relative to students with vending machines.
The adjusted associations between vending machine access and
soda consumption, fast food consumption, and lunch source are
displayed in Table 2. The negative associations indicate that,
contrary to the hypothesis, overall soda and fast food consumption
were lower among students who had access to vending machines
in school. Most notably, students were less likely to report
consuming at least 1 soda per day if they had access to school
vending machines (23.9%) compared to those who did not have
access (27.9%). Students also reported eating fast food on fewer
days per week, on average, if they had access to school vending
machines (1.82 versus 2.06, AME = -0.24, 95% CI: -0.44, -0.05).
They were slightly less likely to obtain a lunch away from home or
school, but the difference was more modest.
The associations represented in Table 2 were consistently
modified by state tax rates and, to a lesser degree, state laws
regarding soda sales in school (Table 3). Results suggested that the
unexpected negative associations in Table 2 were generally limited
to students in states with no disfavored taxes ­ i.e., states that taxed
soda and restaurant food at the same rate as other foods. For
example, in states with no disfavored soda tax, vending machine
access was associated with 1.14 fewer servings of soda per week
(95% CI: -1.92, -0.36), but this difference became progressively
smaller as tax rates increased. The implications of this are
displayed in Figure 1. In short, model estimates predict that the
inverse association between vending machine access and soda
consumption is eliminated if the state tax rate for soda exceeded
the general food tax rate by 7.25% (the maximum amount in the
study sample.) Similar patterns were observed across all four
outcomes.
Similar patterns were also observed when modeling the
interaction between vending machine access and state laws
banning soda in all venues. In the lower portion of Table 3, the
``main effect'' of vending machine access represents the association
between access and the outcomes of interest in states that did not
ban soda; for example, the probability of students drinking soda
every day was 6.23 percentage points lower if they had access to
vending machines (95% CI: -9.52, -2.93), relative to students
without access, in states with no ban. However, the interaction
between vending machine access and in-school soda ban was of
approximately the same magnitude (AME = 5.79, 95% CI: 0.00,
11.6), essentially meaning that the inverse association between
vending machine access and daily consumption was eliminated in
states that banned soda. The same pattern was observed for fast
food consumption and lunch source ­ i.e., the inverse ``main
effect'' of vending machine access was balanced by the interaction

with state soda ban ­ though parameter estimates were not as
precise for these outcomes.
In contrast to Table 3, the associations between vending
machine access and the dependent variables did not consistently
vary by most student or environmental characteristics (see
Appendix S1). The exception to this was student weight loss
behaviors. There was some evidence that the inverse associations
noted in Table 2 were limited to students who were not actively
trying to lose weight through healthy behaviors. For example,
having access to vending machines was associated with 1.14 fewer
servings of soda per week if students were not trying to lose weight
(95% CI: -2.06, -0.22), but 0.18 more servings per week if students
were trying to lose weight (95% CI: -0.55, 0.92).
Discussion
The effectiveness of removing soda and other SSBs from schools
has been questioned by some [10,20,26] and advocated by others
[14,37,38], in part because previous research on policies and in-
school SSB access has produced a mixed bag of results [15­18,20­
24]. Our objective was to explore explanations for the discrepan-
cies by identifying student, environmental, or policy measures that

modified the association between vending machine access and
overall consumption of soda, fast food, and lunch source. We
found evidence that these associations were modified by three
variables that each has important policy implications.
Two of these variables were other state policies related to soda
consumption ­ taxes and laws that regulate the sale of soda in
school. The unexpected inverse association between vending
machine access and soda/fast food consumption was generally
limited to states that did not tax soda and restaurant foods,
respectively; likewise, the inverse association between vending
machine access and daily consumption was limited to states that
did not ban the sale of soda in school venues. These results
underscore the limitations of isolated changes to the school food
environment. In the absence of any other change, children have
numerous sources of soda and other high-fat, high-calorie foods
and beverages in most middle- and high-income countries [39]. It
is unrealistic to expect a single target to have a positive impact
within the obesogenic environment to which children are
continuously exposed. This challenge is not unique to school
nutrition policies or the U.S.; in any country and any domain,
health-related or otherwise, policy resistance often occurs when
policies singularly focus on specific targets without considering the
broader context [40]. Unintended consequences often occur, and
our results are an example of individuals possibly overcompensat-
ing for an isolated policy/environmental change and engaging in
more unhealthy behavior as a result.
This study focused on only one aspect of the school food
environment without considering other changes (e.g., strengthen-
ing school meal standards). This was done intentionally because
our objective was to identify variables that may explain why some
policy initiatives have been less successful than other. At a glance,
the results may appear discouraging to those who advocate for
school nutrition reform, but results should be interpreted in the
context of existing literature on school nutrition policies. Studies
that evaluated more comprehensive policy changes (e.g., those that
required specific limits on nutrition content of competitive foods
and beverages) found stronger evidence [24,25,41]. The impor-
tance of comprehensive change was exemplified by evaluations of
school nutrition policy changes in Texas, where minor changes to
the school food environment initially had little effect on diet
because students compensated [42], but more comprehensive
changes later had a positive effect [24]. Furthermore, our study did
not analyze how long state policies had been in place, which has
been shown to influence the impact of school-based nutrition
policies [25].
We also found evidence of unintended consequences among
students who were not trying to lose weight. Students who were
not engaging in healthy weight loss behaviors consumed consid-
erably more soda and fast food if they did not have access to
vending machines at school. Students' healthy weight loss
behaviors, in themselves, were a strong, consistent predictor of
soda and fast food consumption in this study, but this association
became even stronger when vending machines were not available.
This raises questions of whether school environmental changes can
induce behavioral change among individuals who are not
otherwise motivated to lose weight. With that said, this study did
not examine whether environmental changes increased students'
motivation to lose weight, and this question should be explored in
future research.
Future research should examine the mechanisms through which
soda or fast food consumption may increase when school vending
machines are not available. It is impossible to ascertain from this
study whether elevated intake of soda and fast food was a direct
consequence of not having vending machines. One could
speculate that students who desire soda and do not have access
at school simply leave campus to obtain soda elsewhere. Not only
would this overcome the absence of vending machines, but it
would also lead students to rely on sources that are available 7 days
per week (e.g., convenience stores), which could explain why daily
consumption was higher when vending machines were not
available. If that were the case, it would have important
implications for policies that limit students from leaving campus.
Another possibility is that schools with vending machines sold
other SSBs in place of soda, a trend that has been observed
throughout the U.S. [19], and this led students to consume less
soda by replacing it with other SSBs. These are only two possible
mechanisms, and longitudinal research is needed to study this
topic in greater detail.
Results should be interpreted cautiously due to other study
limitations. Students were not asked which specific beverages were
being sold in vending machines, so it is unknown if those with
access could even purchase soda. This is a crucial distinction that
should be addressed in future studies. We did not analyze intake of
other SSBs because it was beyond the scope of this study, but this
is a critical topic given that adolescents' SSB choices have shifted
in the U.S. in recent years [6]. We did not analyze weight status
either because this association may be confounded by many
factors, including the possibility that schools are more likely to
remove vending machines if obesity is highly prevalent. The cross-
sectional design limited our ability to control for such character-
istics. Associations may have been biased by unmeasured variables
such as socioeconomic status (SES), a potentially important
covariate given the socioeconomic disparities in obesity [43] and
the food environment outside of school [26,44,45]. Finally, all
student data were self-reported and may be vulnerable to
measurement error [46], nor did they contain specific measures
of nutrient intake. The lack of specific nutrient data makes it
difficult to assess whether the associations that we observed were of
a sufficient magnitude to have a public health impact. For
example, a difference of 0.24 days of fast food, as presented in
Table 2, may or may not have an important effect on students'
health, depending on the composition of students' fast food
consumption.
Conclusions
School nutrition policy research is a rapidly evolving science. As
the evidence base continues to grow, it is becoming apparent that
policy effects on student intake are partially determined by
interactions between policies and the broader environment in
which students live. This study provided another example of where
small-scale changes did not appear to improve students' diet,
particularly in the absence of other policies. Research suggests that
comprehensive changes can have a positive effect, but small-scale
changes may potentially backfire unless complemented with
nutrition education and other initiatives to improve the nutritional
quality of other foods and beverages within and outside of school.
Policymakers must be cognizant of how minor changes can have
unintended consequences, and investigators should continue to
study the dynamics between within-school changes and broader
policy and environmental measures.
