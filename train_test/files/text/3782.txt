Introduction
Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation
in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFREF)
has detrimental long-term effects such as water and salt
retention as well as promoting adverse ventricular remod-
eling. Outcomes in HFREF patients have drastically
improved during the past two decades through strategies
that have targeted RAAS activation.1­4 Plasma renin activ-
ity (PRA) and plasma aldosterone levels are biomarkers
that quantitatively reflect RAAS activation and might be
used for risk stratification in HFREF. Indeed, previous
studies have linked higher levels of RAAS activation to
more advanced disease stages and worse outcomes both in
acute and chronic HFREF.5­9 Most of these studies have
focused on PRA as renin is the rate-limiting step of the
RAAS, and a more reliable reflection of RAAS activation
compared to serum aldosterone.10,11 However, these

Abstract
Background: Renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) activation in heart failure with reduced ejection fraction
(HFREF) is detrimental through promotion of ventricular remodeling and salt and water retention.
Aims: The aims of this article are to describe RAAS activity in distinct HFREF populations and to assess its prognostic
impact.
Methods: Venous blood samples were prospectively obtained in 76 healthy volunteers, 72 patients hospitalized for
acute decompensated HFREF, and 78 ambulatory chronic HFREF patients without clinical signs of congestion. Sequential
measurements were performed in patients with acute decompensated HFREF.
Results: Plasma renin activity (PRA) was significantly higher in ambulatory chronic HFREF (7.6
ng/ml/h (2.2; 18.1))
compared to patients with acute decompensated HFREF (1.5 ng/ml/h (0.8; 5.7)) or healthy volunteers (1.4 ng/ml/h (0.6;
2.3)) (all p < 0.05). PRA was significantly associated with arterial blood pressure and renin-angiotensin system blocker
dose. A progressive rise in PRA (+4 ng/ml/h (0.4; 10.9); p < 0.001) was observed in acute decompensated HFREF patients
after three consecutive days of decongestive treatment. Only in acute HFREF were PRA levels associated with increased
cardiovascular mortality or HF readmissions (p = 0.035).
Conclusion: PRA is significantly elevated in ambulatory chronic HFREF patients but is not associated with worse
outcome. In contrast, in acute HFREF patients, PRA is associated with cardiovascular mortality or HF readmissions.

studies largely predate the current era of HFREF treatment
in which angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-
i), angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB), beta-blockers and
mineralocorticoid receptor antagonists (MRA) are guide-
line-recommended therapies. Indeed, nowadays cardiolo-
gist uptitrate ACE-i/ARB and beta-blockers to the highest
achievable dose without intolerable side effects (e.g. sys-
tolic blood pressure <90 mmHg, symptomatic orthostatic
hypotension, decline in renal function, hyperkalemia).12
Moreover, whether RAAS activation during decongestive
therapy has prognostic significance remains unclear.13
Therefore, the objective of this study is to describe the
extent of RAAS activation, and its prognostic impact in
well-characterized HFREF populations on optimal medi-
cal therapy.
Methods
Study design
This prospective cohort study was carried out in a single
tertiary care center (Ziekenhuis Oost-Limburg, Genk,
Belgium) between September 2011 and October 2015. The
study complies with the Declaration of Helsinki and the
institutional review board approved the study protocol. All
participants provided written informed consent before any
study-specific intervention was performed.
Study population
Patients were eligible for study inclusion if 18 years of
age and able to give informed consent. Healthy volunteers
were recruited through general announcements and had (1)
no history of cardiac or renal disease, (2) a normal clinical
examination, and (3) normal cardiac function on transtho-
racic echocardiography.
Patients with acute decompensated HFREF had (1) the
presence of 3 signs or symptoms of volume overload
(edema, jugular venous distention, orthopnea, rales or pul-
monary vascular congestion on chest X-ray); (2) plasma
N-terminal of the prohormone of B-type natriuretic pep-
tide (NT-proBNP) levels >1000 ng/l; (3) a left ventricular
ejection fraction (LVEF) 45%; and (4) a clinical diagno-
sis of HF with evidence of impaired LVEF 40% within
six months before inclusion (5) on optimal medical ther-
apy according to current guideline recommendations or12,14
(6) were hospitalized with an anticipated treatment strat-
egy of intravenous loop diuretics. Exclusion criteria were
(1) administration of intravenous diuretics before study
inclusion; (2) mechanical ventilation; (3) inotropic or
vasopressor support; (4) concurrent diagnosis of an acute
coronary syndrome; (5) renal replacement therapy; or (6)
ventricular assist devices, including the use of an intra-
aortic balloon pump, at any time during the index hospi-
talization. During and after index hospitalization
neurohumoral blockers were uptitrated to the highest pos-
sible dose without side effects according to guideline rec-
ommendations (defined as optimal dose) and at the
discretion of the treating cardiologist.15
Ambulatory patients with chronic HFREF had (1) a
clinical diagnosis of HF with evidence of impaired LVEF
40% within six months before inclusion; (2) no hospital
admission for worsening HF signs or symptoms within six
months before inclusion; (3) stable New York Heart
Association (NYHA) functional class I­III for 3 months;
(4) unchanged pharmacological therapy with ACE-i, ARB,
beta-blockers, MRA and diuretics during the last three
months prior to inclusion; (5) optimal medical therapy
according to current guideline recommendations.12,14
Study endpoint
Cardiovascular mortality and HF readmissions (defined as
hospitalizations because of signs or symptoms of conges-
tion or low cardiac output that warranted treatment with
parenteral drugs) were prospectively registered in all study
patients from inclusion up till three years after which they
were censored.
Laboratory measurements
Venous blood samples were obtained at the moment of
study inclusion with the patient in the supine position after
an adaptation period of 30 minutes. Plasma NT-proBNP
levels were measured by the Roche Diagnostics Assay
(Roche, Rotkreuz, Switzerland). PRA was determined
using the Gamma-coat*radio immunoassay (DiaSorin,
Sallugia, Italy). Plasma aldosterone levels were assessed
by the Aldosterone Maia radioimmunoassay (Adaltis,
Rome, Italy).
Within the subpopulation of acute decompensated
HFREF sequential venous blood samples were obtained
before the start of intravenous therapy (baseline), after
three days of decongestive therapy, and during ambulatory
follow-up approximately six weeks after discharge.
Treating physicians were blinded to test results and treat-
ment during hospitalization was at their own discretion.
Statistical analysis
Continuous variables are expressed as mean±standard
deviation, if normally distributed, or otherwise by median
(interquartile range). Normality was assessed by the
Shapiro-Wilk statistic. Categorical data are expressed as
percentages and compared with the Pearson ²-test. One-
way analysis of variance (ANOVA) testing or the Kruskal-
Wallis H test were used as indicated. Repeated measures
within the acute decompensated HFREF group were com-
pared using the paired Student's t-test or the Wilcoxon
signed-rank test as appropriate. To establish associations
Nijst et al. 3
between PRA and anticipated factors, a multivariable lin-
ear regression model was constructed after the logarithmic
transformation of PRA to correct for the non-normal distri-
bution. Variables with a p value <0.100 in univariable
regression analyses were included in a standard multivari-
able model. Cumulative survival rates were calculated
according to the Kaplan­Meier method with the log-rank
test used for comparison among tertiles of PRA. Statistical
significance was always set at a two-tailed probability
level of <0.05. All statistics were performed using SAS
JMP Pro (version 11.2 for Windows).
Results
Study population
Seventy-six healthy volunteers, 72 patients with acute
decompensated HFREF and 78 ambulatory chronic
HFREF patients were included. Table 1 summarizes their
baseline characteristics. Compared to healthy controls,
acute and chronic HFREF patients were older and had a
severely impaired LVEF (25±10 vs 33±7, respectively).
Neurohormonal blocker use was high in both cohorts of
HFREF patients. However, compared to chronic ambula-
tory HFREF patients, fewer patients with acute decompen-
sated HFREF were on maintenance therapy with an ACE-i
or ARB (50% vs 87%). Instead, 26% of acute decompen-
sated patients were taking oral vasodilators (hydralazine
and/or nitrates). Loop diuretic use was highest in the cohort
of acute HFREF patients.
RAAS activation in distinct populations of
HFREF
PRA was significantly higher in ambulatory chronic
HFREF patients (7.6 ng/ml/h (2.2; 18.1)) compared to
acute decompensated HFREF patients (1.5 ng/ml/h (0.8;
5.7)) or healthy volunteers (1.4ng/ml/h (0.6; 2.3)) (both
p <0.0001). There was no significant difference in PRA
levels between acute decompensated HFREF patients
and healthy volunteers (p = 0.13) (Figure 1). Plasma
concentrations of aldosterone were the lowest in acute

decompensated HFREF but not significantly different
from healthy individuals (p = 0.08) or ambulatory
chronic HFREF patients (p = 0.19) and comparable
among the two other groups (p = 0.76). Overall, PRA
was significantly associated with blood pressure, ACE-i/
ARB dose and MRA dose after multivariable regression
analysis. There was no significant association between
PRA and either loop diuretic dose or NT-proBNP level
(Table 2).
PRA during decongestive therapy and
uptitration of neurohormonal blockers in
patients with acute decompensated HF
During decongestive treatment (from baseline to day 3) in
patients with acute decompensated HFREF, the absolute
and relative increase in PRA was +2.4 ng/ml/h (-0.2; 6.9)
and +107% (-12%; 553%), respectively (both p < 0.001).
Seventy-one percent of patients showed an increase in
PRA during decongestion and uptitration of neurohormo-
nal blockers (Figure 2, Table 3). Additionally, from day 3
until six weeks after discharge, neurohormonal blockers
were further uptitrated, and 58% of patients showed an
additional increase in PRA, which was however non-sig-
nificant (+0.5 ng/ml/h (-2.3; 7.8) (p = 0.35)) (Figure 2).
Taken together, from admission until six weeks' follow-up
79% of patients showed an increase in PRA (+4 (0.4; 10.9)
ng/ml/h or +238% (30; 654) compared to baseline; p <
0.001)). Similar trends were observed with regards to
serum aldosterone concentration.
PRA and clinical outcome
During the entire follow-up period, 36 events occurred in
patients with acute decompensated HFREF (22patients died
from cardiovascular causes and 14 patients were readmitted
for worsening HF). PRA levels at admission in the highest
tertile were associated with a significantly increased event
rate (log rank=0.035) (Figure 3). There was no difference in
outcome between patients with a PRA rise vs decline during
recompensation (from baseline until day 3) (log rank=0.96)
(Figure 4, Table 3 Supplementary Appendix). In the sub-
group with ambulatory chronic HFREF patients, one death
and six HF readmissions occurred. PRA levels were not
associated with clinical outcome (log rank = 0.99) (Figure 3).

Discussion
Longitudinal data from distinct well-characterized HFREF
populations in the current era of treatment with neurohor-
monal blockers provide a unique opportunity to examine
RAAS activation. The primary findings of this study are
(1) significant PRA is present in ambulatory chronic
HFREF patients without signs and symptoms of conges-
tion, while PRA seems depressed during episodes of acute
decompensated HFREF with clear signs of volume over-
load; (2) PRA levels correlate significantly to worse out-
comes only in patients with acute decompensated HFREF
before initiation of decongestive treatment; and (3)
treatment with neurohormonal blockers significantly influ-
ence neurohormonal levels.
The RAAS
To better appreciate the study results, a brief review of the
RAAS is useful. Renin, an enzyme released by juxtaglo-
merular cells of the renal afferent arteriole, starts a cascade
in which angiotensinogen is cleaved first into angiotensin
I, which is further metabolized to angiotensin II (Ang II)
by ACE. Ang II causes systemic and renal arteriolar vaso-
constriction, promotes renal tubular sodium and water
reabsorption, and is a potent stimulator of aldosterone
release from the adrenal glands. Upon an acute drop of the
cardiac output, RAAS activation helps to preserve organ
perfusion in general and the glomerular filtration rate in
particular.16­18 Renin is released from the afferent arteriole
in response to three main stimuli: (1) decreased arterial
blood pressure sensed by baroreceptor cells in the afferent
arteriolar vessel wall, (2) decreased chloride concentra-
tions in macula densa cells lining the renal tubules at the
end of Henle's loop, and (3) sympathetic nerve system
activation.19,20 As a result, renin release is physiologically
inhibited by normal or elevated systemic blood pressure
and a diet high in salt.21­23 Persistent and excessive RAAS
activation causes adverse ventricular remodeling and con-
tributes to fluid retention with signs and symptoms of
congestion.24­30
High PRA in ambulatory chronic HFREF
More than two decades ago, before the standard use of
neurohormonal blockers in HFREF, Francis et al. com-
pared neurohormonal activation--including PRA--in
healthy volunteers vs asymptomatic HFREF patients vs

HFREF patients with signs and symptoms of congestion.
The authors concluded that neurohormonal activation
already occurred in patients with left ventricular dysfunc-
tion before the onset of symptoms, which was further
exaggerated as overt HF ensued and diuretics were added
to therapy.7 Remarkably, important increases in neurohor-
monal activation were mainly seen in the patients with
symptomatic HFREF, while the PRA increases in asymp-
tomatic patients were modest. This is in contrast to our
findings in a contemporary cohort of HFREF patients,
where the most pronounced PRA rise was observed in
ambulatory chronic HFREF patients without signs and
symptoms of congestion but well treated with ACE-i,
ARB, beta-blockers and MRA.
Indeed, ACE-i and ARB tend to lower aldosterone con-
centrations, but increase PRA, while beta-blockers might

lower both, and MRA increase both.31­37 Although none of
the patients included in this study were taking an angioten-
sin receptor blocker-neprilysin inhibitor (ARNI), in light
of the new HF guidelines it may be interesting to point out
that previous studies have demonstrated that the associa-
tion of sacubitril, a neprilysin inhibitor, does not affect
PRAor serum aldosterone concentration.38,39 Hypertensive
patients treated with neurohormonal blockers demonstrate
increased PRA and plasma aldosterone levels.40­42 Yet, the
individual response to medication varies greatly because
of genetic polymorphisms.6,43­47 Our data corroborate this
as we observed a wide spread both in PRA and plasma
aldosterone levels among patients with ambulatory chronic
HFREF. Overall, patients with ambulatory chronic HF had
significantly higher levels of PRA compared to acute
decompensated HF patients while exhibiting a much lower
risk. Thus, the association between PRA and outcome
seems to apply only to the higher-risk groups of HF
patients. Therefore, most probably the PRA and serum
aldosterone levels do not reflect disease-related (harmful)
RAAS activation and are not a reliable surrogate for down-
stream receptor activation.48,49 Interestingly, the RAAS
consists of two main axes: the classical ACE/Ang II and
the counteracting ACE2/angiotensin 1 to 7 (Ang 1­7)
axis.50 ACE2, a homolog of ACE, degrades Ang II into
Ang 1­7. Ang 1­7 exerts a wide array of actions, many of
which are opposite to those attributed to Ang II (vasodila-
tion, decrease in fibrosis and cardiomyocyte hypertrophy,
inhibition of aldosterone secretion etc.).50,51 In our study
we measured PRA, the rate-limiting step of the RAAS sys-
tem and common to both axes and serum aldosterone.
However, we did not measure Ang II, Ang 1­7 or other
products of intermediate steps of the complex RAAS. It
has been shown that in response to ACE-i, PRA rises but
plasma levels of Ang 1­7 also increase. A high percentage
of ambulatory chronic HF patients, but also acute decom-
pensated patients were on ACE-i as well as MRA.
Therefore, it may be a logical hypothesis that the increased
renin activity due to efficient blockade of the classical
ACE/Ang II axis leads to stimulation of the counteracting
and beneficial axis of the RAAS (ACE2/Ang 1­7), which
may be partly responsible for the beneficial effects of this
therapy in HF patients. This could be an interesting topic
for further research for the development of new targets for
HF therapies.
PRA in acute HFREF
As neurohormonal activation is often perceived as the key
driver in HFREF disease progression, it may seem odd that
PRA and serum aldosterone levels are significantly lower
in patients with signs and symptoms of congestion.
Furthermore, this contradicts former observations in med-
ication-naive HFREF patients.7 Yet, most chronic HFREF
patients in the current study were on maximally tolerated
dosages of neurohormonal blockers and also have rather
low blood pressure. Both are powerful predictors of PRA
levels in our overall population (Table 2). In contrast, most
patients with acute decompensated HFREF present with
elevated rather than low arterial blood pressure, a finding
also present in the current study.52 Intriguingly, this might
indicate that the RAAS in advanced HFREF treated with
neurohormonal blockers remains appropriately responsive
to hemodynamic changes including blood pressure and
volume overload. Also, the most important increase in
RAAS activation during the treatment of acute HFREF is
seen in the first days of hospitalization, which seem to be
linked to decongestive therapy (reduction in plasma vol-
ume as well as intensified diuretic therapy) and introduc-
tion and/or uptitration of neurohormonal blockers.
Therefore, one might speculate that PRA could be a poten-
tial surrogate for effective circulatory volume assessment.
Prognostic value of PRA
PRA levels correlate significantly to worse outcomes
only in patients with acute decompensated HFREF
before decongestive treatment. High levels of neurohor-
mones in stable HFREF patients are not predictive for
rehospitalization due to water and salt retention or death.
Also, the relation of high PRA levels and negative out-
come in acute decompensated HFREF might not be
driven by higher neurohormonal activation but rather
reflect more advanced disease in this subgroup, reflect-
ing volume overload and low pressure, both known to be
related to worse outcome.50,51 In conclusion, it seems
that the association between an RAAS biomarker and
adverse outcomes applies only to the setting and not to
its absolute value.
Study limitations
First, we recruited and compared two groups of HFREF
patients. Although we were able to characterize these
groups in detail, it is uncertain to what extent observed
differences in RAAS activation were due to heterogeneity
between groups. The fact that all patients were recruited
from a single institution, the limited sample size and event
rates makes findings hypothesis-generating and ask for
separate confirmation. Second, patients with urgent need
for administration of loop diuretics, inotropic/vasodilator
or mechanical support were not included in this study.
Thus, our data do not apply to severely decompensated
HF patients or patients in cardiogenic shock. Third, all
patients were put in a semi-supine position for an adapta-
tion period before a venous blood sample was drawn.
However, besides physical activity, PRA also depends on
many other variables such as circadian rhythm, sodium
intake, and presence/absence of disease states that could
not be accounted for in this cohort study.53

Conclusion
PRA is decreased in a state of acute decompensation com-
pared to ambulatory chronic HFREF. An increase in PRA
activity is observed in the majority of patients during
decongestive treatment and neurohormonal blocker upti-
tration. However, increased PRAis associated with adverse
outcomes only in the setting of acute decompensated
HFREF before initiation of decongestive treatment.
