Longitudinal Trajectories of BMI and Cardiovascular Disease
Risk: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health
Samantha M. Attard1, Amy H. Herring2,3, Annie Green Howard 2,3 and Penny Gordon-Larsen1,2
Objective: In adulthood, excess BMI is associated with cardiovascular disease (CVD); it is unknown
whether risk differs by BMI trajectories from adolescence to adulthood.
Design and Methods: The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, a nationally representative,
longitudinal adolescent cohort (mean age: 16.9 years) followed into adulthood (mean age: 28.8 years)
[n 5 13,984 individuals (41,982 observations)] was examined. Separate logistic regression models for dia-
betes, hypertension, and inflammation were used to examine odds of risk factors at given adult BMI
according to varying BMI trajectories from adolescence to adulthood.
Results: CVD risk factor prevalence at follow-up ranged from 5.5% (diabetes) to 26.4% (hypertension) and
31.3% (inflammation); risk differed across BMI trajectories. For example, relative to men aged 27 years (BMI
5 23 kg/m2 maintained over full study period), odds for diabetes were comparatively higher for men of the
same age and BMI  30 kg/m2 with 8 BMI unit gain between 15 and 20 years (OR 5 2.35; 95% CI, 1.51,
3.66) or in those who maintained BMI  30 kg/m2 across the study period (OR 5 2.33; 1.92, 2.83) relative
to the same 8 BMI unit gain, but between 20 and 27 years (OR 5 1.44; 1.10, 1.87).
Conclusions: Specific periods and patterns of weight gain in the transition from adolescence to adult-
hood might be critical for CVD preventive efforts.

Introduction
The transition from adolescence to young adulthood is a risk period
for excess weight gain (1,2). Associations between adult BMI and
diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation risk are well established
(3-5); however, BMI trajectories from adolescence into adulthood
may differentially associate with cardiovascular disease (CVD)
risk. Studies relating past and current BMI to CVD risk have gener-
ally been conducted in small samples (6), in one sex or ethnic group
(6-12), or used recalled/self-reported BMI (13-15) rather than meas-
ured anthropometry or examined discrete obesity rather than BMI
trajectories. Thus, there is a need to investigate relationships
between BMI trajectories and later CVD risk using measured
anthropometry in large, population-based samples with adequate var-
iation in magnitude and timing of BMI changes.
It is also unknown whether weight gain during specific periods in the
adolescence to young adulthood transition or current weight is most
relevant for adult CVD risk. While overweight duration and CVD risk
has been addressed in older adult populations (10,11), we know little
about the specific periods within the high risk transition from adoles-
cence to adulthood, when precursors of CVD rapidly develop (16-20).
We have shown that diabetes risk is particularly high in individuals
who were obese as adolescents relative to those with adult-onset
obesity (1), but we do not know about the effects of differential BMI
gain trajectories on diabetes, inflammation, and hypertension, which
can inform targeted disease prevention and lifestyle intervention
efforts.
To address whether BMI trajectories across 12 years from adoles-
cence into adulthood are associated with differential CVD risk, we
capitalize on a nationally representative, prospective cohort of

adolescents followed into adulthood across three surveys. We
hypothesize that at the same age and BMI, adults have differential
diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation risk depending upon their
BMI trajectory from adolescence to adulthood, and, specifically, that
weight gain in late teen years is more strongly associated with com-
paratively higher risk than weight gain in the third decade of life.
Methods
Data source
The National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) is
a longitudinal cohort representative of US middle and high school stu-
dents in 1994-95 at baseline (wave I; n 5 20,745; mean age: 15.7
years). Participants were surveyed a maximum of four times over a 12-
year period, with measured anthropometry collected at waves II, III,
and IV and blood pressure and biomarkers collected at wave IV. Data
from this analysis comes from waves II (1996; n 5 14,738; mean age:
16.2 years), III (2001-2002; n 5 15,197; mean age: 22.0 years), and
IV (2008-2009; n 5 15,701; mean age: 28.5 years). Survey procedures
have been described elsewhere (21) and were approved by the institu-
tional review board at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.
Inclusion criteria
The primary inclusion criteria for this study were that respondents:
had a survey weight (n 5 14,800), had either: HbA1c, blood pres-
sure, or CRP measured at wave IV (excluded n 5 150), and were
not pregnant at time of measurement (excluded n 5 529), resulting
in a total eligible sample of 14,121. Native Americans (n 5 110)
were excluded due to small sample size as were 27 individuals with
missing race/ethnicity information, resulting in a final analytic sam-
ple of 13,984 respondents.
Dependent variable measurement
Blood pressure (BP) was collected at wave IV using standardized
procedures. Systolic and diastolic BP were measured on the right
arm three times (average of second and third used for analysis) at
30-s intervals after 5-min seated rest using the appropriate cuff size
and a Microlife BP3MC1-PC-IB oscillometric BP monitor (Micro-
Life USA; Dunedin, FL). Hypertension was defined as systolic/dia-
stolic BP  140/90 mmHg (3), self-reported doctor diagnosis of
hypertension, or use of BP-lowering medication.
HbA1c was measured using colorimetric assays from whole-blood
spot assays collected from finger pricks (22). Diabetes was defined
as HbA1c  6.5% (23), self-reported doctor diagnosis of diabetes,
or indicating the use of diabetes medication.
CRP was measured using the sandwich ELISA method from whole-
blood spot assays collected from finger pricks (24). Following
previously established recommendations, individuals with CRP  10
mg/L were excluded due to likely acute infection, which obscures
CRP as a marker for elevated CVD risk. Inflammation was defined
as CRP  3 mg/L (5).
Independent variable measurement
Main exposure. Height and weight were measured during in-
home surveys in waves II, III, and IV using standardized procedures.
BMI was calculated as weight(kg)/height(m)2 and annualized change
between each measurement wave (BMITime 2
-BMITime 1
/year).
Control variables. Age, sex, current smoking status, and race/
ethnicity were collected using traditional survey methods. Individu-
als reported medication use in the last 4 weeks, including diabetes,
hypertension, or anti-inflammatory medication. Additional controls
were: parental history of diabetes (diabetes model) and use of
inflammatory medication, presence of subclinical infection markers,
and reported current infection/inflammatory disease (inflammation
model).
Statistical methods
CVD risk factor models. All analyses were conducted in Stata
12 (Stata, College Station, TX). In separate logistic regression mod-
els, we estimated odds of having diabetes, hypertension, or inflam-
mation at wave IV. Main exposure variables were a series of BMI
values [wave II BMI (adolescence) and annualized BMI change
between waves II-III and III-IV], which allowed us to assess associ-
ations of CVD risk factors with: (1) wave II BMI and (2) BMI
changes between waves II, III, and IV while controlling for wave II
BMI. We used post hoc tests of group differences to test differences
across the BMI trajectories. We allowed associations to vary by sex
by including interaction terms between sex and main BMI exposure
variables. Other covariates included sex, race (white, black, His-
panic, Asian), smoking status (yes/no current smoker waves II, III,
and IV), wave II age, region of residence (West, Northeast, South,
Midwest), parental history of diabetes (yes/no) [diabetes model] and
anti-inflammatory medication use (yes/no), presence of subclinical
infection markers (0, 1, 2, or 3 markers), current infections/infla-
matory disease (0, 1, 2, or 3 infections/inflammatory diseases at
survey) [inflammation model]. We used Wald tests with significance
value set at P 5 0.1 to test inclusion of specific interaction terms in
the models. We used cross-sectional survey weights, and clustered
at the school level (primary sampling unit) using a sandwich var-
iance estimator to account for survey design methods and nonres-
ponse bias (25).
To take advantage of all available information, the three models had
different sample sizes (diabetes: n 5 12,904; observations (obs) 5
38,712; hypertension: n 5 13,643; obs 5 40,929; inflammation: n
5 11,027; obs 5 33,081) due to missingness in outcome measures
and model-specific exclusions.
Missing data. We are missing height and weight measurements
in 6,008 individuals across all waves. Our largest source of missing-
ness (59%; n 5 3,556/6,008) was due study design (wave II fol-
lowed only school-aged students, including high school drop-outs,
although all wave I participants were eligible for wave III and IV)
rather than loss to follow-up (39%; n 5 2,365/6,008 missing at
wave III; none missing at wave IV as per inclusion criteria) or
anthropometry refusal [2%; n 5 89/6,008 at one or more visits [obs
5 304 wave II; obs 5 820 wave III; obs 5 164 wave IV)]. We
used multiple imputation chained equations (MICE) in Stata 12
(26,27) to estimate missing BMI values (obs 5 3,860 wave II; obs
5 3,185 wave III; obs 5 164 wave IV; of these, 145 wave II and
247 wave III observations were dropped due to pregnancy at time of
survey) or smoking (obs 5 3,558 wave II; obs 5 2,370 wave III;
obs 5 41 wave IV). Five imputation data sets were created, and all

subsequent analyses used Rubin's rules for the combination of mul-
tiply imputed data sets (28).
The imputation model included age at each wave, race, parental his-
tory of diabetes, variables correcting for survey design including:
longitudinal survey weights, region, and indicator variables for over-
sampled groups: disabled, blacks from well-educated families, Chi-
nese, Cubans, and Puerto Ricans. Diabetes, hypertension, and
inflammation were included in the imputation model for BMI and
smoking to preserve outcome-predictor associations appropriately
(29). Cross-sectional sample weights and clustering at the school
level (primary sampling unit) accounted for survey design methods
and nonresponse bias. Imputation was carried out separately by sex,
due to differing relationships between race, age, and BMI by sex.
Evaluation of the multiple imputation for missing data.
Imputation models assume data are missing at random conditional
on included covariates. We examined differences between the sam-
ple with any missing data (n 5 6,008) versus complete information
(n 5 7,976) to assess our imputation model assumptions using chi-
squared tests (categorical variables) and t tests (continuous varia-
bles) at a Bonferroni-corrected significance level of 0.006 (type 1
error rate 5 0.05, nine comparisons). Sensitivity analyses were used
to examine differences in the imputed and nonimputed data (pre-
sented in results).
Presentation of results. We examined differential associations
in diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation at wave IV (mean age:
28.8 years) as a function of wave II BMI (mean age: 16.9 years)
and BMI change between: (1) waves II-III, mean ages: 16.9-22.3
years, and (2) waves III-IV, mean ages: 22.3-28.8 years. Model
coefficients are presented in tabular form. We derived BMI trajecto-
ries based on a priori research interests in baseline weight (wave
II), timing of weight gain between waves, and adult weight (wave
IV) at wave IV in relation to cardiometabolic risk in adulthood.
From our multivariate model, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and
95% confidence intervals (CIs) for diabetes, hypertension, or inflam-
mation for these a priori BMI trajectories relative to a "healthy"
referent (stable BMI 5 23 kg/m2 at all waves) and then used post-
hoc tests to examine trajectory group differences across the BMI
trajectories.
Results
Our ethnically diverse sample had a baseline mean age of 16.9 years
(Table 1). Average BMI increased over time. At wave IV, hyperten-
sion and inflammation were prevalent in under a third of the cohort
and 6% had diabetes.
Mean BMI and BMI change are presented across diabetes, hyperten-
sion and inflammation status in Table 2, with significantly higher
mean values in individuals with (versus without) diabetes, hyperten-
sion, or inflammation.
In general, in adjusted models (Table 3) wave II BMI and BMI
change from waves II-III and from III-IV were significantly and
positively associated with the three CVD risk factors. In model test-
ing, we additionally included interaction terms to test whether wave
II BMI modified associations between BMI change from waves II-
III and III-IV with CVD risk factors, and whether these interactions
were also modified by sex. Wald tests for inclusion of all interac-
tions terms between wave II BMI and the BMI change variables
were not significant at a priori-determined 0.1 level for diabetes (P
5 0.52), hypertension (P 5 0.11), or inflammation (P 5 0.66), thus
these terms were not retained in the models.
We derived 10 BMI trajectories (Figure 1) based on: (1) a priori
research interests regarding baseline weight, timing of weight gain,
and adult weight in association with future cardiometabolic risk; and
(2) distributions of BMI and BMI change in our nationally represen-
tative sample, ensuring that the 10 selected BMI trajectories were

well represented in the sample (and thus in the United States). We
chose the following distributions of BMI and BMI change to con-
struct our trajectories: wave II BMI (23, 30, and 36 kg/m2 represent-
ing the 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles, respectively), BMI change
between waves (1, 4, or 8 BMI unit increase between waves II-III
or III-IV representing the 20th, 60th, or 90th percentiles of BMI
change, respectively), and wave IV BMI (23, 30, and 36 kg/m2 rep-
resenting the 25th, 60th, and 85th percentiles, respectively). With
these 10 BMI trajectories, we then tested hypotheses regarding dif-
ferential associations between BMI trajectories and CVD risk factors
among individuals at the same wave IV BMI. Hereafter, we refer to
BMI at a given age x as BMIx
; i.e., BMI at age 27 is denoted
BMI27y
and BMI change across age by BMI15-27y.
In Table 4, we present ORs for diabetes, inflammation, and hyper-
tension across each of the 10 trajectories with the stable BMI15-27y
5 23 kg/m2 trajectory as the referent. We used post hoc tests to
assess trajectory group differences in ORs. We found higher odds of
diabetes for men in group A: BMI15y
5 23.0 kg/m2, large BMI15-27y
gain, small BMI20-27y
gain [OR 5 2.35 (1.51, 3.66)] compared to
group B: BMI15y
5 23.0 kg/m2, small BMI15-20y
gain, large BMI20-
27y
gain [OR 5 1.44 (1.10, 1.87)], despite the fact that groups A
and B had a similar BMI27y
(30 kg/m2). While wave II BMI and
BMI change from waves II-III and III-IV were strongly associated
with hypertension, we observed only small differences in hyperten-
sion ORs for men with BMI27y
 30 kg/m2 (groups A-D) or 36 kg/
m2 (groups E-I) using post-hoc testing.
At a given BMI27y
, women with small BMI15-27y
gain (groups D
and G) had significantly lower odds of inflammation compared to
referent (stable BMI15-27y
5 23 kg/m2) than women with medium or
large BMI15-27y
gain (groups A-C, E-F, H-I) (Table 4). In fact, the
OR for inflammation at age 27 years in women with stable BMI15-
27y
 36 kg/m2 [group G; OR 5 3.80 (3.00, 4.81)] was lower than
the OR for group C: BMI15y
5 23 kg/m2, medium BMI15-27y
gain,
and BMI27y
30 kg/m2 [OR 5 4.07 (3.41, 4.86)].
In sensitivity testing, we assessed differences in the imputation ver-
sus full sample. Respondents with any missing data (n 5 6,008) ver-
sus complete data (n 5 7,976) were older, a greater proportion were
minority race/ethnicity, and they had higher CVD risk factor preva-
lence (P < 0.006) (Supporting Information Table 1). Further, there
was strong agreement in mean BMI and proportion of smokers in
the sample for whom we had anthropometry measures versus the
full analytic sample (n 5 13,984) (Supporting Information Table 2).
We replicated the central models (Tables 3 and 4) in respondents
with complete (nonmissing) data (n 5 7,976). Coefficients and ORs
did not differ from main analytic sample (n 5 13,984), which
included measured (n 5 7,976) and imputed (n 5 6,008) data, sug-
gesting that imputed values did not introduce bias into estimates for
diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation (Supporting Information
Tables 3 and 4).
We also replicated the central models (Tables 3 and 4) with the
inclusion of potential confounders. Attained education (as a measure
of socioeconomic status) did not meet the 10% change-in-estimate
criterion for confounding on main exposure variables in any model,
thus it was not retained (Supporting Information Table 5). In a sepa-
rate test, we included diet and physical activity variables; again, the
10% change-in-estimate confounding criterion was not met and
these variables were not retained (Supporting Information Table 6).

Finally, to test sensitivity of our findings to intentional weight loss
after CVD risk factor diagnosis (more likely to occur between waves
III-IV [mean ages: 22.3-28.8 years] than waves II-III [mean ages:
16.9-22.3 years], we repeated analyses excluding BMI change
between waves III-IV. Coefficients for wave II BMI and BMI
change between waves II-III did not alter direction or strength of
effect (results not shown).
Discussion
In this nationally representative, prospective cohort of adolescents
followed into adulthood, we found that for adults at equivalent BMI,
odds of diabetes, hypertension and inflammation differed according
to BMI trajectories from adolescence to adulthood. Weight gain
between ages 15-20 years was associated with comparatively higher
odds of diabetes and hypertension than weight gain from ages 20-27
years. Particularly in women, medium or large weight gain between
ages 15-27 years was associated with higher odds for inflammation
at age 27 years, even if age 27 years BMI was lower. Our finding
that BMI and BMI change between waves II-IV (mean ages: 17-29
years) was strongly associated with diabetes, hypertension, and
inflammation at wave IV (mean age: 29 years), suggests that this
time period is a crucial window during which clinicians can impact
future cardiometabolic health. Thus, in addition to intervening dur-
ing pediatric years (a difficult period for lifestyle intervention), the
period between adolescence and the third decade of life provides
another important opportunity for prevention and screening efforts,
particularly given that this period is one where precursors of adult
CVD are rapidly developing (16-20).
Previous studies focusing on weight history and CVD risk have typi-
cally used data from two visits, relied on self-reported/recalled BMI
(13-15), or were conducted in one sex or ethnic group (6-8,10-12),
had small sample size (6), and examined older adult (10,11) or
obese populations (14) rather than population-based samples. Studies
have shown that BMI gain between ages 40-55 years (15) or longer
obesity duration (4,7,8,15) more strongly relates to diabetes risk
than recent obesity incidence, with some exceptions (6). Yet, there
is a dearth of prospective studies using measured anthropometry
across the adolescent to early adult periods to examine associations
with CVD risk factors. Our nationally representative, longitudinal
dataset spanning the teen to adult years provides sufficient variation
to examine associations between well-represented BMI trajectories
across these periods and CVD risk factors in adulthood.
For diabetes, higher age 15 years BMI and large BMI gain between
ages 15-20 years was more strongly associated with diabetes at age
27 years than weight gain between ages 20-27 years. For given age

27 years BMI, we observed highest diabetes odds for individuals
with stable and high BMI trajectories from ages 15-27 years.
Together, our findings of stronger associations with diabetes for past
BMI and distal BMI gain suggest diabetes risk is compounded by
time spent at elevated BMI, potentially through efficiency of insulin
secretion and action (4,30).
We observed that age 27 years BMI was more predictive of current
hypertension status than BMI trajectory from ages 15-27 years. Simi-
larly, other researchers have found comparatively stronger associations
between current BMI (31) [versus overweight duration (6,13,14)] and
hypertension risk and that previously overweight but currently normal
weight (BMI < 25 kg/m2) individuals did not have higher hypertension
risk than individuals who maintained normal weight over time (11,32)
Current BMI may be particularly related to hypertension in our cohort
because of the immediate effects of excess weight on BP in terms of
greater cardiac output and vascular resistance (33).
BMI gain during the transition from adolescence to adulthood was
associated with greater odds of inflammation than current (age 27
years) or past (age 15 years) BMI alone. For women in our sample,
even at lower age 27 years BMI, medium/large BMI gain (versus
stable BMI) between ages 15-27 years was associated with higher
odds of inflammation. In general, studies suggest comparatively
stronger associations between BMI gain or loss with CRP increase
(34) or decline (35) than current BMI (12). Yet the published
research has not addressed the transition from adolescence to young
adulthood in an ethnically diverse, prospective cohort. Current
debate concerning the direction of association between CRP and
BMI (36) suggests that this association might capture respondents
most likely to continue gaining weight, rather than reflecting
increased risk from past weight gain.
Our study is not without limitations. Given that we do not have ear-
lier measures of BP, HbA1c, and CRP or a history of date of diag-
noses, it is possible that our trajectories include time before and
after CVD risk factor onset, and thus intentional weight loss after
diagnosis may have resulted in weakened observed associations,
even in our relatively young sample (mean ages: 17-29 years). Simi-
larly, we do not know about pre-existing obesity prior to study
entry, although our study spans 12 years during a time of substantial
weight gain. We were unable to distinguish Type 1 and Type 2 dia-
betes (T2D), which is of concern as weight change is thought to be
related to the development of T2D; collapsing the groups likely
underestimates associations between BMI trajectories and T2D. A
growing literature suggests differential associations between BMI
and CVD risk factors by race/ethnicity (37), thus our findings may
not be generalizable beyond the US, though national representation
FIGURE 1 Constructed BMI trajectories used to examine differential odds of diabetes, hypertension, and inflammation in par-
ticipants aged 15 years at wave II, from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health.a. aWe derived 10 BMI trajecto-
ries (Figure 1) based on: (1) a priori research interests regarding baseline weight, timing of weight gain, and adult weight in
association with future cardiometabolic risk; and (2) distributions of BMI and BMI change in our nationally representative
sample, ensuring that the 10 selected BMI trajectories were well represented in the sample (and thus in the United States).
We chose the following distributions of BMI and BMI change to construct our trajectories: wave II BMI (23, 30, and 36 kg/
m2 representing the 25th, 75th, and 95th percentiles, respectively), BMI change between waves (1, 4, or 8 BMI unit
increase between waves II-III or III-IV representing the 20th, 60th, or 90th percentiles of BMI change, respectively), and
wave IV BMI (23, 30, and 36 kg/m2 representing the 25th, 60th, and 85th percentiles, respectively). With these 10 BMI tra-
jectories, we then tested hypotheses regarding differential associations between BMI trajectories and CVD risk factors. The
consistent BMI 5 23 kg/m2 trajectory over the full follow-up period was used as the referent in statistical modeling.)
aSmall (20th percentile), medium (60th percentile), and large (90th percentile) annualized change in BMI between waves
II-III or waves III-IV are based upon the distribution in the analytic sample.

provides generalizability in the US. Because of survey design and
loss to follow up across the study period, we imputed missing BMI
data for 25% of our observations using state-of-the-art, well-vali-
dated statistical techniques in an imputation model that included
covariates associated with missingness and corrected for survey
design. Given that our largest source of missingness was related to
study design and because the Add Health cross-sectional survey
weights account for non-response bias (25), we had justification to
impute these missing values. We present detailed sensitivity analyses
to examine model differences using imputed versus nonmissing data.
Our findings suggest that use of imputed data does not alter our con-
clusions from the central analyses.
Despite these limitations, our study makes several contributions to
the literature. The age span of our sample is a strength of our study.
Indeed, it is quite interesting that in this short span of time and at
these young ages, BMI and BMI change related differentially to dia-
betes, hypertension, and inflammation. Our derived BMI trajectories
were well-represented in our nationally-representative sample.
Indeed our sample provides the only nationally representative, longi-
tudinal sample with measured height and weight that spans the late
teen and early adult years. With innovative modeling strategies, we
estimated contributions of BMI trajectories during the adolescence
to adulthood transition relative to attained BMI on diabetes, hyper-
tension, and inflammation risk; this modeling approach can now be
adapted for use in other ethnicities and during other life cycle peri-
ods to better understand associations between BMI trajectories and
CVD risk factors as well as high-impact periods for CVD prevention
and intervention efforts.
In this nationally representative, ethnically diverse, prospective
cohort, diabetes risk in adulthood was strongly related to BMI dur-
ing adolescence and BMI gain between the "school years" (teen
years) and "college years" (early 20s). In contrast, hypertension risk
in adulthood was strongly related to current BMI, whereas inflam-
mation risk was positively associated with BMI gain, rather than
current BMI. Our findings suggest that for given adult BMI, varying
BMI trajectories from adolescence to adulthood are associated with
differential CVD risk, and that there is utility in targeted counseling
on weight and CVD prevention during these periods. Given increas-
ing prevalence of childhood and adolescent obesity, as well as
potential for large weight gain in the teens and 20s, there is need for
further inquiry into mechanistic links between BMI trajectories and
CVD risk at different periods of the lifecycle. O
