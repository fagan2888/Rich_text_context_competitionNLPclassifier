Introduction
Current technology offers numerous teaching applications to
help course instructors impart knowledge and facilitate
learning. Availability of such technology makes way to the
development of blended learning, which is a teaching
approach that takes advantage of such teaching application
tools. One such tool is the video that plays an important role
in replacing the instructor in his or her absence. However,
technology is just a tool. To be able to use the tool, one has to
have the know-how and the motivation to use the tool, while
overcoming the fear of not being able to catch up with the
fast evolving technology.
Muirhead and Salmon (2002) stated that there is a neces-
sity to motivate students with poor level of independence as
online learning lacks face to face interaction. On the con-
trary, social interaction is an inherent characteristic of con-
ventional teaching approach settings. To have an effective
blended learning approach, a student must have interest in
the material taught; be a self-motivated, independent, and
self-directed learner; be a critical thinker; enjoy family sup-
port; receive positive and timely feedback; accept responsi-
bility for own learning; be organized; and possess practical
knowledge in the use of computers; deficiency in any of
these factors may cause poor social interaction among stu-
dents'community (Irizarry, 2002). Thus, a sufficient solution
to develop a strong sense of community in students who
would feel isolated in a fully online course is to offer one
with no complete loss of face-to-face contact.
We have developed a blended learning module for a sub-
ject called Introduction to Statistics (Md Noh, Yusoff, &
Yusoff, 2015) and had implemented the module to students
enrolled in the subject for the past three semesters at a public
university. The first two semesters were a success where fail-
ure rate among students who were taught using the blended
learning module was small and grades achieved were signifi-
cantly better than students who were taught using conven-
tional approach (Md Noh et al., 2015). However, in the third
semester, a sudden increase in failure rate to more than 25%
had opened our eyes to look further into the strengths and
weaknesses of blended learning especially when it involves

Blended Learning Approach for Less
Proficient Students
Sarah Yusoff1, Rohana Yusoff1, and Nur Hidayah Md Noh1
Abstract
This article describes the implementation of blended learning in a higher education institution by focusing on the less proficient
students. Malaysia's Ministry of Higher Education has urged every university to introduce blended learning in their teaching
and learning processes as a new approach. Nevertheless, there are less proficient students who are hesitant, less motivated,
and face difficulty in associating learning with technological applications. Our main purpose is to show how blended learning
can be designed to suit the less proficient students by first identifying their learning styles and then creating a motivating
supportive learning system through the use of teaching technology applications. The sample size for this study is 64 business
program students from four groups taking the course Introduction to Statistics in two consecutive semesters. These are
students who had to repeat a few subjects including Introduction to Statistics as well as students who entered university with
lower qualifications and had to undergo one semester of booster certification program. Final examination scores are used as
a measure of students' performance. Comparison using examination marks scored is shown using independent t test, mean
effect size, and Box and Whiskers plot. Results showed noticeable difference in examination scores obtained by the different
groups of students. As a conclusion, while blended learning approach bears many benefits, it has to be tailored to suit the
different students' cognitive levels as well as learning styles.

learning can be designed to suit the less proficient students.
Comparison in grades scored in the final examination is pre-
sented to show the effect of the redesigned module.
Literature Review
Mobile Devices and the Uses of Social Media in
Blended Learning
Technology is undeniably changing the face of education,
and the technology impact is widely felt by educators and
learners. A study was conducted by Gikas and Grant (2013)
to understand learning perceptions with mobile computing
devices and the roles of social media. This study revealed
that mobile computing devices and the use of social media
created opportunities for interaction and provided opportuni-
ties for collaboration, student engagement with the content,
and communication using social media, and Web 2.0 tools.
Another perception study about social media, the Twitter,
was also conducted by Tur and Marín (2015). This study
revealed that students perceive that mobile technology is
useful in education and are willing to use the Twitter as a tool
of learning. A similar study about online tools by Montero-
Fleta, Pérez-Sabater, and Pérez-Sabater (2015) concluded
that Twitter can increase students' confidence in using
English as a communication language. Likewise, students
view online tools as an easier learning method and less
intimidating way to search new vocabulary. Another similar
study about the use of mobiles for learning higher education
by Al-Emran, Elsherif, and Shaalan (2016) also suggested
that mobile-learning can be one of the teaching pedagogies
in higher education. Even with slow Internet connectivity,
students still view and accept blended learning favorably
(Thang et al., 2013).
There are numerous online teaching materials available
for every subject with various different approaches. In
Mathematics and Statistics, websites like Khan Academy,
OpenEd, Sophia.org, Ted Ed, Learn Zillion, DreamBox,
Edmodo, and Blendspaces are taken as references to produce
high quality teaching materials in blended learning. These
websites use good software applications such as ShowMe,
Educreation, Knowmia, and Explain Everything in produc-
ing interesting and excellent materials for teaching and learn-
ing tools.
Challenges of Implementation in Blended
Learning
There are several challenges in implementing blended learn-
ing as a mode of teaching. Khan, Shaik, Ali, and Bebi (2012)
mentioned an effective way to overcome the challenges is
sufficient technology support and infrastructure. The biggest
challenge in implementing blended learning is to adopt the
method into the teaching and learning system. The same
challenge is highlighted in a study by de Jong, Savin-Baden,
Cunningham, and Verstegen (2014). De Jong highlighted six
major issues that are relevant to designing blended learning
systems. Two main issues are cultural adaptation and tech-
nology know-how. Students must be able to change to adopt
the new teaching and learning style. However, one should
note that social interaction and communication should not be
jeopardized at the expense of technology usage. The role of
teacher, careful selection of collaboration tools, and techni-
cal preparation are important considerations when designing
and implementing blended learning. Teaching materials pro-
vided online must be carefully chosen to assist successful
teaching and learning process.
Lim and Morris (2009) highlighted four categories of good
instructional design. They are instructor qualities, quality of
learning activities, learning support facilities, and study
workload. Challenges of blended learning implementation
highlighted by Ocak (2011) are complexity of the instruction,
the lack of planning and organization, effective communica-
tion, institutional support, and the lack of electronic means.
Other challenges identified by Butcher (2016) are time con-
suming, changing roles, difficulty in adopting new technolo-
gies, and the frustration with technical infrastructure and
individual learner distraction. Ocak pointed that successful
implementation of the blended courses can be affected by
their highly complex and different teaching patterns. Despite
the challenges, Kim, Bonk, and Teng (2009) predicted that
blended learning will become a new teaching pedagogy in the
future trend. The use of technology can be seen as an innova-
tive challenge to restructure the teaching-learning process and
integrate Information and Communications Technology in
independent, collaborative, and interactive work. In addition,
the blended students are more successful in transferring their
knowledge to their projects than the ones in the face-to-face
group (Demirer & Sahin, 2013). This finding implies that
blended learning approach has a positive effect on the transfer
of learning.
Good blended learning materials can motivate good stu-
dents to learn. This is because good students have high moti-
vation to learn (Lim & Morris, 2009). Salili, Chiu, and Lai
(2001) found that students, who are confident and motivated
to learn, spend more time and effort and achieve higher lev-
els of performance than those who are not confident and not
motivated. This is supported by Sankaran and Bui (2001)
who found that less motivated learners did not perform as
well on knowledge test as motivated students. These less
motivated students do not have the same amount of excite-
ment toward the subject matters as the good students. This is
the human part of the challenges that an educator has to face
when implementing blended learning.
Figure 1 shows the blended learning components and per-
centage of students who face problems in blended learning.
The components are online assessment, classroom tutorials,
and video power point. The red line represents the component
with the highest percentage of student who face problems,
Yusoff et al. 3
while the green line represents the component that best helped
students' understanding. The components that have the high-
est percentage of students facing problems are online assess-
ment and video power point. Meanwhile, the component that
best helped students' understanding is classroom tutorials.
These results were obtained by Yusoff et al. in 2015.
Proficiency Levels
The term proficiency is used in a variety of ways in educa-
tion. Other similar terms for less proficient students are less
effective learners, ineffective learners, poor readers, unsuc-
cessful learners, or unskilled learners. Educators evaluate
tests or other forms of assessments by giving scores and
scales, and thereafter categorize students into several profi-
ciency levels. This method of categorizing students is widely
used in education to assess students' achievement.
Most studies found that high proficient students make use
of strategies more consciously, more purposefully, more
appropriately, and more frequently than do poor learners
(Oxford & Nyikos, 1989). Similarly, Naiman, Frohlich,
Stern, and Todesco (1978) found that high proficient stu-
dents use a great variety of appropriate strategies for both
receptive and productive tasks, whereas less effective learn-
ers have a smaller range of strategies and often do not choose
appropriate strategies for the task.
Mehrdad, Ahghar, and Ahghar (2012) studied reading
comprehension across three levels of proficiency (elemen-
tary, intermediate, and advanced). Mehrdad et al. found
that an elementary (less proficient) student is not able to
benefit from the cognitive and metacognitive strategies
compared with intermediate and advanced learners.
Mehrdad et al. further found that elementary readers
mainly attend to the factual information in the text and fail
to relate such information to the general content. Poor
readers are not aware of the use of strategies to monitor
their comprehension of texts as well as their strategy use
(Mokhtari & Reichard, 2002). Lower achiever student's
use less metacognitive strategies compared with higher
achiever students (Park, 1997).
Pammu, Amir, and Maasum (2014) focused on reading
strategies for less proficient tertiary learners. Panmu, Amir,
and Maasum found that the less proficient learners used top-
down strategies for better comprehension. The reading strate-
gies used was setting purpose for reading, previewing text,
determining what to read, resolving conflicting information,
and confirming prediction. Another study by Mistar (2001)
found that good and poor students in Indonesia use similar
strategies but good learners use the strategies more frequently
and effectively than poor learners do. Chen (1990) found that
more proficient learners actually use fewer communication
strategies, though they use them more effectively than less
proficient students. Generally, proficiency has been deter-
mined on the basis of the educators' judgments about their
students based on the marks or grades and their personal "on-
balance" assessment of their students given the descriptors of
high proficiency or good, middle proficiency or fair, and low
proficiency or poor (Magogwe & Oliver, 2007).
Approach for Less Proficient Students
"If I cannot learn the way you teach, will you teach me the
way I can learn?" a simple quote from Ignacio Estrada
(Courtesy of David Zats). In practice, not all teaching meth-
ods can fit all students. Everyone is unique and needs differ-
ent approach. Some of us are fast learners and some of us are
slow learners. Slow learner is a term used to describe a stu-
dent with the ability to acquire all necessary academic skills,
but at a rate and depth below that of the average student
(Muppudathi, 2014). Muppudathi suggested that every
teacher or educator should build self-confidence among slow
learners, be able to repeat (saying the same thing over and
over), and encourage other learning activities. In summary,
an educator must have innovative approaches or strategies
for less proficient students. For example, to build up stu-
dents' confidence level, an educator may use a simple
approach first before gradually introducing a more complex
but important approach. From experience, we observe that
this approach is effective especially for mathematical and
statistical subjects.

Method
The sample size for this study is 64 business program stu-
dents from four groups taking the course Introduction to
Statistics in two consecutive semesters. The four groups of
students are divided into two samples called Sample A and
Sample B.
Sample A consists of 31 students who took the course
Introduction to Statistics from June to October 2015.
Whereas Sample B consists of 34 students who took the
same course from December 2015 to March 2016. Sample
A is divided into two groups; one group contains 10 stu-
dents who had to repeat the subject while the other group
contains 21 students comprising of those who had under-
taken a booster program because they entered the univer-
sity with lower qualification, repeaters, and a few good
students (according to their cumulative grades [CGPA]).
Sample A was taught using the Original Blended Learning
(OBL) module.
Sample B is also divided into two groups; one group con-
sists of 21 students who had either repeated the subject once,
twice, or had dropped the subject when they should have
taken it in earlier part of the program. The other group of 13
students is made up of those who had undertaken a booster
program because they entered the university with lower qual-
ification, repeaters of the subject, and several good students
(according to their CGPA). Students from Sample A who
failed their examination and had to repeat the subject are
included in Sample B. Furthermore, both samples of students
were instructed by the same lecturer (Mrs. Rohana). Sample
B was taught using the Redesigned Blended Learning (RBL)
module. Apart from very few good students, the rest of the
students in both samples are considered less proficient in the
course. To give a better insight to readers, a summary of the
characteristics of each sample is shown in Table 1.
We have tried to control all possible variables to reduce
the differences between the two samples. From Table 1, we
can see that Characteristics 1 to 5 for both samples are very
similar. To show whether the redesigned blended module is
more effective for less proficient students, we compare final
exam marks and the total marks (final exam marks plus
continuous assessments marks) for the two samples using t
test and look at the mean effect size. The final exam scores
can be used for comparison because for every semester, stu-
dents' answer scripts are inspected by an audit committee
elected by the university to make sure that markings are
according to the marking scheme and no unsolicited marks
given to students' answers willfully. As such, the scores can
be taken as true data.
Brief Description of the OBL Module
The blended learning module that we developed consists of
three dimensions: face to face (F2F) sessions, self-learning,
and assessments. The total four contact hours per week is
divided into 2 hr F2F and 2 hr self-learning (a ratio of
50:50). F2F sessions are class sessions where students can
ask questions, discuss, and solve problems in the lecturer's
presence. At the same time, the lecturer facilitates, explains,
and provides exercises for students to work on. This is the
time when lecturers can ensure that students solve problems
using correct methods and understand concepts correctly.
Self-learning sessions require students to learn indepen-
dently anywhere and at their own convenient time. Students
are provided with videos on all the topics in the syllabus,
lecture notes, and tutorial exercises.Assessments are embed-
ded in both F2F and self-learning sessions. They consist of
short written quizzes, assignments, and tests. The final
examination is conducted at the end of the semester after a
week of "study leave" where no formal lectures are allowed
during the week. During F2F sessions, a minimal technol-
ogy application is used; most of the time, instructors use
"chalk and talk" method. While during self-learning, com-
munication among students and instructor is made easy with
instant messaging applications (WhatsApp and Telegram).
The university online learning application is also available
for forums, online quizzes, and online accessible storage of
all teaching materials.
To make it easy to differentiate between the OBL module
and the redesigned module, we are going to call the original
module as OBL module and the redesigned module as RBL
module.

RBL Module
The following paragraphs describe how the components of
the three dimensions of the OBL were tailored to suit the less
proficient students.
Technology applications.During F2F sessions, technology
applications used in RBL module are Explain Everything
and Padlet, while during self-learning, similar communica-
tion applications as in OBL module are used.
Investigate learning styles. The first two semesters of students
instructed using the OBL module had proven blended learn-
ing is suitable for diverse learning styles. Thus, applying the
same method of teaching to all students during F2F and
assessments are acceptable. However, results from the third
semester of blended learning showed that the statement might
be true only up to a certain cognitive and motivational level.
Below a certain threshold level, we still have to be sensitive
and cater for the different learning styles when teaching.
Thus, at the beginning of the first class, we asked students to
answer a questionnaire on visual, auditory, and kinesthetic
learning styles (VAK questionnaire). Results showed that all
of the less proficient students are kinesthetic whereas the few
good students are all either visual or auditory or both. This is
quite an interesting finding that implies watching and listen-
ing to an instructor's explanation will get the less proficient
students nowhere near to comprehending what is being taught
and what more to remember the facts and figures. To learn
quicker, these students have to be doing more activities con-
nected to the subject rather than only watching and listening.
Realizing that the students are mostly kinesthetic in learn-
ing style, we have redesigned the original module to include
more activities. But that is not enough because asking them
to do more activities may only rouse complaints as they may
have to spend more time on our subject while other subjects
also demand their attention. Hence, the instructor has to bal-
ance between the enthusiasm to get the students to learn her
subject with the amount of workload given to students.
Moreover, students will not do the exercises, quizzes, and
assignments if they are not motivated enough.
Integrate videos and lecture notes. Some students have voiced
out that they find difficulty in concentrating to academic vid-
eos. It is well understood that listening to academic videos
may be a boring activity as academic videos do not have the
attractions of a movie and the likes. What more if some theo-
retical concepts are not understood by the students? To over-
come the problem of understanding the videos, during F2F
session, instructor uses the power point videos converted to
portable document format (PDF) as lecture notes. This is to
familiarize students with the slides in the videos as well as
facilitate students' memory of the content. Students could
ask questions about the slides and redo the examples when
they watch the video again.Instant feedback on short written
quizzes. Each of the quizzes takes about 10 to 15 min of the
2 hr F2F session. The objective is to strengthen memory of
what has been learnt before as well as to motivate students to
put in effort to learn. It is a way to avoid students passively
watching a video which does not achieve any level of rich
learning as it does not require the student to do anything but
sit, watch, and, with a bit of luck, absorb information. For
each chapter, students are required to watch a fixed number
of video slides and a topic for the quiz is given. After the
quiz, students'answers are redistributed among them and the
correct answers are presented together with the marking
scheme. Students then mark their friends'answers and return
the papers to their owners when finished marking. In this
way, students get instant feedback on their mistakes. All
marks achieved are recorded and contribute to a portion of
the continuous assessment mark. The reason for this is to
eradicate any idea by the students that the quiz is unimport-
ant and so no need to be concerned with.
Proportion of F2F to self-learning.The proportion of F2F to
self-learning in OBL module was set to 50:50. In RBL mod-
ule, F2F stays 2 hr but the amount of time allocated for com-
pletely independent self-learning is reduced to 1 hr while
another hour of self-learning is set for open book quizzes. So
the proportion becomes 50:25:25 or 2:1:1. There is at least
one open book quiz for every chapter. Every student has to
submit their individual quiz and marks given will be a pro-
portion of their continuous assessments. Students may
choose not to be in class, but they have to come to class to get
the question paper. This is to ensure that they make them-
selves available to do the quiz. They are allowed to discuss
and to look up notes and books, but it is compulsory for them
to submit in a specified time set by the instructor. The quiz
was designed so that students can finish in 1 hour. Instructor
is not present in class but is available online to answer any
query about the quiz except to give direct answer. Students
are encouraged to teach and to learn from each other. Espe-
cially, the better ones are encouraged to teach while the
weaker ones are encouraged to ask. In this way, we hope to
create a happy and lively study environment for the students.
This method overcomes the main disadvantage (Muirhead
and Salmon, 2002) of blended learning which is the lack of
face to face social interaction.
The main objective for implementing open book quizzes
is to motivate students to study. Although they are open book
quizzes, they need to have basic knowledge to hasten their
understanding so that they can finish the quizzes in the speci-
fied time. Marks for these open book quizzes are given for
submission, not for the correct methods and answers per se.
However, different marks are given for the different amount
of questions answered completely. This method of assess-
ment helps to relieve the instructor from having to correct
too many quizzes. The answers to an open book quiz are dis-
cussed in the following F2F session. Students who are absent
are given a link to Padlet for online submission.
6 SAGE Open
Continuous assessment proportion.The continuous assess-
ment consists of tests, quizzes, and open book quizzes. Out
of 100% total final mark, tests constitute 30% and quizzes
and open book quizzes constitute 10%. Tests are meant to
evaluate understanding of the subject material whereas quiz-
zes and open book quizzes are meant to motivate students.
That is why for each set of short instant quizzes, open book
quizzes, and online quizzes, only the best scores from 30%
of the total assigned short instant quizzes, open book quiz-
zes, and online quizzes are counted for the 10%. To motivate
students, this information is kept secret.
Analysis and Results
Table 2 shows the comparison between summary statistics of
students' performance under both OBL and RBL modules.
Two different scores are used in the comparison: (a) final
exam scores only and (b) final exam plus ongoing assess-
ment scores. The mean, median, minimum, and maximum
values for OBL module are all lower than the mean, median,
minimum, and maximum values for RBL module. In addi-
tion, lower dispersion in scores (lower standard errors) for
OBL module indicates that the rest of the scores are close to
the mean value. These results indicate that in general, stu-
dents in RBL module perform better than students in OBL
module.
We also extend the analysis to effect size analysis to know
how much the effect of RBL module is over the OBL module.
We have used the effect size given by Cohen's d . The mean
effect size for final exam scores only is d = 0.83 while d = 0.93
for final exam and ongoing assessment scores. This indicates a
large effect size suggesting high practical significance.
Table 3 shows the comparison of scores using box-
plots. From the plots, we can see that the distributions of
final exam scores are almost normal for both OBL and
RBL modules. However, the distribution of final exam
and ongoing assessment scores for OBL module is left
skewed showing the impact of ongoing assessment scores
on the total scores. If the ongoing assessments measure
students' effort, then we can conclude that only half of the
students had dedicated reasonable effort while the other
half had dedicated less than reasonable effort. However,
in the RBL module, the distribution of final exam and
ongoing assessment scores is still almost normal.
Further analysis using independent sample t test is con-
ducted to compare the scores. Results in Table 4 show that
there is a significant difference between scores for OBL and
RBL modules; that is, mean score for RBL module is signifi-
cantly higher than the mean score for OBL module.
Limitation
Apart from the difficulty in obtaining identical samples for
conducting comparison, the other limitation is that the RBL
module has been verified on only two groups of students in
one semester. Further verification with more groups of stu-
dents is necessary to get more reliable results.
Conclusion and Recommendations
Nowadays, blended learning is a must. If students cannot
learn the way we teach them, then as instructors, we must find
ways to change our teaching method. Hopefully, teaching and
learning can be joyful as well as a satisfying experience for
both students and instructors. Results from this study show
that blended learning can be used as a teaching approach for
less proficient students in the course Introduction to Statistics.
However, the dimensions of the blended learning have to be
tailored to suit the students' learning styles. This is because
even though an average proficient student can quickly famil-
iarize and adapt to blended learning approach, less than aver-
age proficient students need to have additional monitoring to
encourage higher participation.
One important element in the RBL module is the increase
in opportunity for academic social interaction among stu-
dents. Through open book quizzes, students have the chance
to socialize academically through discussion while complet-
ing the questions. This has a tremendous effect on elevating
shyness and individualistic behavior among students. As a
result, they become more helpful, more caring toward each
other, and more importantly have higher motivation to study.
Finally as a reminder for us, technology is just a tool; to get
students to work and motivate them to put in effort, the teacher
is most needed. However, motivation through talking and
advice will not have a transcendental effect if not supported by
a good learning system.Agood learning system for a course is
one that offers many opportunities for student enhancement
such as abundant and easy access course materials, instant
feedback on progress through quizzes and tests, and an envi-
ronment of helpfulness among colleagues and instructors.

This redesigned blended learning module provides a system
whereby like it or not students are forced to put in effort to
learn the subject through instant feedback on short quizzes as
well as involvement in academic discussion among colleagues
during open book quizzes. Through the use of technology,
they have easy access to abundant course materials as well as
two-way communication with instructors and colleagues.
Thus, we recommend three elements essential in blended
learning for less proficient students: easy access to course
materials, instant feedback, and academic social interaction.
