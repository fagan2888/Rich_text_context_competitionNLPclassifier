Background
Approximately 80per cent of breast cancers will be oes-
trogen-receptor positive, and adjuvant endocrine therapy
(AET), including tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, is
recommended (Keen and Davidson, 2003). AET taken
for 5­10
years has proven effectiveness in preventing
recurrence and decreasing mortality from breast cancer
(ATAC Group, 2008; Coombes et al., 2004; Davies et al.,
2013; Dowsett et al., 2009; Fisher et al., 1996; Goss et al.,
2003; Gray, 2013; Howell et al., 2005). However, to gain
these potential benefits, women need to adhere to the
medication as prescribed, and reported rates of non-
adherence are relatively high. Reviews report that 10­
50per cent of women either do not take the correct dosage
at the prescribed frequency or discontinue therapy
leading to a 20
per cent increase in mortality (Banning,
2012; Chlebowski and Geller, 2006; Gotay and Dunn,

Abstract
This study evaluated the Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire to explore adherence to adjuvant endocrine therapy after
treatment for breast cancer (BMQ-AET). Factor structure of the BMQ-AET was explored alongside internal consistency,
convergent validity and acceptability. The BMQ-AET Specific Scale fitted the original 10 item model. Internal consistency
of the BMQ-AET was much improved compared to the original BMQ and convergent validity showed predicted direction
of correlation, although correlation with BMQ-AET concerns scale was low. Acceptability was good. The evaluation of
the BMQ-AET is encouraging, and could facilitate future research around adherence to AET.

et al., 2013).
Beliefs about medications as factors influencing patient
adherence behaviour have been reported in various clinical
groups (Van-Dulmen et al., 2007). Investigating women's
beliefs about endocrine therapies is crucial to explore their
perception of risk and perception of benefit from taking the
medication and develop interventions to improve adherence.
The Beliefs about Medicine Questionnaire (BMQ) has
been tested in a wide variety of patient populations and is a
valid and reliable measure of medication beliefs (Horne
and Weinman, 1999). A recent meta-analytic review reports
that across studies, higher adherence was associated with
stronger perceptions of necessity of treatment (odds ratio
(OR)=1.742, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.569­1.934,
p<.0001) and fewer concerns about treatment (OR=0.504,
95% CI=0.450­0.564, p<.0001). These relationships
remained significant when data were stratified by study
size, the country in which the research was conducted and
the type of adherence measure used (Horne et al., 2013).
While it has been used to assess the beliefs and perceptions
of women taking endocrine therapy after breast cancer
(Corter et al., 2013; Grunfeld et al., 2005; Wouter et al.,
2013), in other cancers (Llewellyn et al., 2005, 2007), no
psychometric evaluation of this measure for this population
has been reported.
The BMQ-AET adapted wording of the BMQ-Specific
Concerns and BMQ-Specific Necessity items to be more
relevant to women taking AET following breast cancer.
This study aims to evaluate the factor structure, internal
consistency and acceptability of the BMQ-AET-Specific
scale in a sample of women-prescribed AET for breast
cancer.
Methods and procedures
Design
A cross-sectional study was carried out to explore women's
experiences ofAET.As part of this study, women completed
the BMQ-AET within a self-report postal questionnaire.
Sample
Participants included women aged 36­85years taking AET
following treatment for breast cancer. These women had
previously participated in the Joint Aches Cohort Study
(JACS) looking at women's experiences of joint aches,
pain and stiffness in breast cancer (Fenlon et al., 2014).
During JACS, participants were asked to indicate their
willingness to participate in future studies; we re-
approached only this subsample for this adherence study.
All participants had been diagnosed with primary oestro-
gen-receptive positive breast cancer and had been pre-
scribed AET. Exclusion criteria included women with more
advanced cancer, women seriously ill with other conditions
and women who had a poor comprehension of English.
Procedure
Ethical approval was gained from the University Research
Ethics Committee (UREC). Informed consent was gained,
and postal questionnaires were sent out in July 2014, with a
reminder sent after 3
weeks of non-response. Participants
took approximately 20
minutes to complete the question-
naire, which include a range of nominal and multiple-
choice questions asking about their experiences of taking
AET and two scales: the Medical Adherence Rating Scale
(MARS; Thompson et al., 2000) and the BMQ-AET-
Specific scales.
Measures
The Beliefs about Medicines Questionnaire (BMQ) was
originally developed to aid understanding of people's per-
ception of medicine regimes and to help understand adher-
ence to medication. It is an 18-item self-report measure of
beliefs about medicine (Horne and Weinman, 1999) derived
from a pool of items representing commonly held beliefs
about medication in a chronic illness sample (Asthmatic,
Cardiac, Diabetic, Renal, Psychiatric, and General; Horne
and Weinman, 1999). Specific (10 items) and General (8
items) beliefs were analysed separately. The measure com-
prises two sections, each divided into two subscales. The
BMQ Specific comprises two five-item subscales: the
`Specific Necessity' subscale (i.e. beliefs about the neces-
sity of taking that specific medication to remain healthy)
and the `Specific Concerns' subscale (i.e. concerns about
the negative effects of taking that specific medication). The
BMQ-General comprises two 4-item subscales assessing
beliefs that medicines are harmful which should not be
taken continuously (General-Harm) and that medicines are
overused by doctors (General-Overuse). All items of the
BMQ are rated on a 5-point likert scale where 1 represents
strongly agree and 5 represents strongly disagree. Scores
obtained for the individual items are summed to give a total
score for each subscale, and the two sections of the BMQ
can be used in combination or separately.
Table 1 identifies the modifications made to the original
BMQ for the BMQ-AET. The term `hormone treatment' is
used instead of AET, as the former is a more recognised
terminology for this treatment among women. Changes
were made in consultation with service users and the expert
advisory team for this study that included a breast cancer
surgeon, an oncologist, a general practitioner (GP), a health
psychologist, a professor of cancer nursing and a medical
sociologist. Most items had minor changes to make the
items relevant to the population. However, the item `my life
would be impossible without medicines' was changed to
`taking hormone treatment makes me feel I am taking
Brett et al. 3
positive steps to remain well' because AET is not taken by
women to reduce side effects of a condition, but to reduce
the risk of recurrence of breast cancer and is therefore not
relevant to this population.AET can often cause side effects
that make it difficult to continue with the treatment, and
therefore, adherence is more related to taking personal con-
trol to avoid the return of a condition rather than controlling
a pre-existing condition; this factor was not covered else-
where and so deemed a relevant replacement item.
Service users from Independent Cancer Patients' Voice
(n=2), cancer experts (n=4), and a representative from the
charity Breast Cancer Care evaluated the face validity of
the modified items during the development of the question-
naire, with minor adjustment to the final wordings made to
ensure comprehension. As items on the General beliefs
subscale are not condition specific, it was not necessary to
amend wording.
The Medical Adherence Report Scale (MARS-5)
(Thompson et al., 2000) assesses adherence to treatment
and was used to provide a measure of convergent validity
with the BMQ-AET. The MARS-5 consists of five general
statements about suboptimal adherence behaviour (I forget
to take my AET medicine, I alter the dose of my AET medi-
cine, I stop taking my AET medicine for a while, I decide to
skip one of my AET tablets and I take AET less than pre-
scribed) answered on a 5-point scale where 1 represents
`always' and 5 represents `never'. Items were not summed
but used individually in determining types of adherence
and non-adherence.
Analysis
COnsensus-based Standards for the selection of health
Measurement INstruments (COSMIN) were used in the selec-
tion of evaluation methods for the analysis (Mokkink et al.,
2010). Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using direct
oblimin rotation was used to explore the factor structure of the
modified measure. PCA was chosen over factor analysis
because it offers a more pragmatic psychometric solution,
reducing the number of observed variables to a smaller num-
ber of components (factors) which account for most of the
observed variance, thus avoiding some of the potential prob-
lems of factor interdependency which are associated with
other types of psychometric scale development methods
(Bartholomew et al., 2002). Furthermore, this method mirrors
that used in the development and evaluation of the original
BMQ (Horne and Weinman, 1999), and it was our intention to
be able to compare across these two versions.
The resultant factors were subjected to internal consist-
ency testing using Cronbach's alpha tests. Convergent
validity was explored by comparing correlation between
the BMQ-AET and MARS; due to non-parametricity of
MARS data, Spearman's correlation tests were used.
Acceptability was examined by exploring missing data
and floor/ceiling effects, and face validity was assessed
through discussions with service users and clinicians dur-
ing the development stage of the questionnaire.
Results
Questionnaires were returned by 211 women (73%), all of
whom completed the BMQ-AET scale and 206 completed
the MARS. The socio-demographic characteristics and
health status of responders are summarised in Table 2.
Factor analysis
Standard diagnostic tests were run to ensure that the data
were suitable for factor analysis. Both the Kaiser­Meyer­
Olkin (KMO
=
.791) test of sampling adequacy and
Bartlett's test of sphericity (p=<.001) indicated that the
current data were indeed appropriate.

As is usual practice, an initial scree plot analysis was
undertaken suggesting that a two-factor solution was the
most parsimonious fit for the data, and this corresponded
with the factor structure of the original BMQ. More recent
practice has also been to consider a Parallel Analysis
Monte Carlo simulation (using randomly generated data)
to verify the number of required factors (Velicer et al.,
2000). Using the method described by Hayton et al. (2004)
which employs an upper bound of the 95
per cent CI for
eigenvalues, averaging across 100 random data sets, this
procedure confirmed that two resultant factors were
appropriate.
Table 3 shows the factor structure matrix (with Kaiser
normalisation) resulting from the principle components
analysis; this accounted for 56.936 of the total variance
(individual factor variances also indicated). Where items
loaded onto multiple factors, they were retained only for
the factor onto which they loaded most strongly.

Analysis indicated that the factor structure of the BMQ-
AET-specific items mapped exactly onto the factor struc-
ture of the original scale; the original subscale names were
thus retained whereby Factor 1 became the concerns sub-
scale and Factor 2 became the necessity scale. Only one
item loaded with a very low factor loading (`Hormone
treatment is a mystery to me') with the remainder meeting
recommended criteria (Stevens, 1992: 283). The low factor
loading item was included in the final measure as removing
this item did not improve overall psychometric properties
of the scale, so it was retained to uphold the original struc-
ture of the measure.
Internal consistency
Cronbach's alpha's statistics provide an indication of how
well items within a given scale are measuring a similar and
stable construct. Typically, subscales with a Cronbach's
alpha of less than .7 are considered inadequate; however,
Cortina (1993) notes that the method of calculating this sta-
tistic is biased by item numbers whereby factors on a scale
with fewer items tend usually to produce a lower alpha
coefficient as a bi-product of the statistical calculation
(Cortina, 1993). As our two subscales of specific beliefs
scored alpha coefficients of .776 and .795 for concerns and
necessity, respectively; even when bearing in mind
Cortina's caution (which is relevant given that only 5 items
appear in each subscale), these two scales exceed the usual
cut-off for acceptability reliability. These figures are
aligned with, and in some cases exceed, those reported in
the confirmatory factor analysis reported by Horne and
Weinman (1999).
Convergent validity
The MARS is a self-report scale of adherence to medica-
tion and so provided an adequate measure of convergent
validity for these data, whereby we would anticipate a neg-
ative correlation between both specific concerns and adher-
ence and a positive correlation between specific necessity
beliefs and adherence. Correlations tests indicated a signifi-
cant correlation between higher treatment necessity beliefs
(BMQ-AET Specific Necessity) and greater adherence
(MARS) scores (rs
=.215, p=.001). However, correlations
between BMQ-AET Specific Concerns and MARS, while
showing the expected direction of association (higher treat-
ment concern beliefs correlated with lower adherence
scores), failed to reach statistical significance (rs
=-.038,
p=.100).
Acceptability
Acceptability of the two individual scales was determined
by examining the rate of missing responses to each item, as
this provides an indicator of how acceptable the instrument
is in a given population (Fitpztrick et al., 1998). The BMQ-
AET was completed by all 211 respondents, with only 5
cases having missing responses for one or more items.
Floor and ceiling effects (i.e. the percentage scoring the
minimum and maximum score) were examined for the
BMQ-AET Specific Concerns and the BMQ-AET Specific
Necessity. The Specific Concerns scale had a 3.4
per cent
ceiling effect and a 1
per cent floor effect; The Specific
Necessity had a 0per cent ceiling effect and a 8.7per cent
floor effect. As a proportion of up to 15per cent can be con-
sidered a low effect (Terwee et al., 2007), the data show
acceptable ceiling and floor effects.
Discussion
The BMQ-AET was included in a questionnaire survey to
explore women's experiences and views of taking AET to
identify factors that may be associated with adherence or
non-adherence. Independent testing of the BMQ for

6 Health Psychology Open 
women-prescribed AET following breast cancer has not
previously been reported. The BMQ was modified so the
wording was suitable to women who were taking AET. The
evaluation of the BMQ-AET showed a similar factor struc-
ture to the original BMQ-Specific subscale (Horne and
Weinman, 1999), and we report good internal consistency,
encouraging convergent validity and good acceptability
within this sample. The modified scale may therefore pro-
vide a valuable assessment of women's specific beliefs
around AET.
The results show that all factors had sufficient factor
loading to be included, and therefore, the original factor
structure proposed by Horne and Weinman (1999) was
retained. This is an important finding as it suggests that
the factors represent `core themes' underpinning com-
mon representations of Specific Beliefs in this population
which may generalise out to other specific condition
groups. One item `my life would be impossible without
medicines' was changed to `taking hormone treatment
makes me feel I am taking positive steps to remain well'
because AET is not taken by women to reduce side effects
of a condition, but to reduce the risk of recurrence of
breast cancer and is therefore not relevant to this new
population. AET can often cause side effects that make it
difficult to continue with the treatment and therefore
adherence is more related to taking personal control to
avoid the return of a condition rather than controlling a
pre-existing condition. Although the meaning of the item
is slightly different, our psychometric analysis of the
scale demonstrates that the new item is still correlated
with the other cluster items within the factor group. As
such we would suggest that while the new item represents
some deviation, it is both a pragmatic and psychometri-
cally valid alternation to make the scale relevant to this
patient population.
Other studies have reported similar findings in primary
care, general medical populations, and mental health popu-
lations in the United Kingdom and across cultures (Browne
et al., 2005; Cuevas et al., 2011; Salgado et al., 2013). In
this study, the only exception to this was the item `Hormone
treatment is a mystery to me' and so this may require some
further investigation in future uses of the scale. Internal
consistency exceeded that reported by Horne in the original
evaluation of the measure, which has also been reported in
other patient populations, including Stroke and Asthma
indicating the generalisability of the BMQ (Horne and
Weinman, 2002; Sjölander et al., 2013). Furthermore,
results reported good completion rates, acceptable ceiling
and floor effects. Face validity of the modified scale was
confirmed prior to completion of the questionnaire through
consultation with service users and health professionals in
the advisory group for this study.
Correlation between BMQ-AET-specific subscales and
MARS was in the predicted direction, although only the
association between treatment necessity beliefs and
adherence reached significance. The low correlation between
treatment concern beliefs and adherence may have been due
to the subjective nature of capturing non-adherence on self-
reported measures such as the MARS. Correlation with
objective measures, such as pill counts, may provide a better
gold standard in future studies. A recent meta-analysis
reported significant correlation between both Concerns and
Necessity in 33 and 31 studies correlating with MARS
(Horne et al., 2013). However, they concluded that stratify-
ing by long-term condition and adherence measurement
revealed a need for further studies using objective measures
in longer term conditions to ensure greater accuracy of meas-
uring non-adherence long-term. Furthermore, a larger study
may have given greater power to the study at which point we
may expect these effects to more likely reach statistical sig-
nificance cut-offs.Afurther meta-analysis exploring associa-
tions between the BMQ and different measures of medical
adherence concluded that they were correlated at a popula-
tion level and across the majority of included conditions
(Foot et al., 2015).
This work is based on a self-selected sample that may
have presented response bias. The majority of the sample
were white Caucasians, so may not be generalisable to eth-
nic minority groups. While this study reports a correlation
between the modified BMQ-specific subscales and MARS
in the predicted direction, more studies, possibly with larger
samples, may improve the statistical power to gain signifi-
cance in both the BMQ-AET Necessity and the BMQ-AET
Concerns. Further confirmatory factor analysis is also
advised to ensure that this factor structure is retained across
multiple samples with less exploratory methods of statisti-
cal modelling. Additional studies investigating the psycho-
metric properties of BMQ in other settings and populations
may be beneficial to confirm our finding that suggests
beliefs provide `core themes' which are not necessarily
population specific.
In conclusion, the BMQ-AET for women-prescribed
AET following breast cancer has good internal consistency,
encouraging convergent validity and good acceptability for
the Specific Beliefs about the necessity of and concerns
regarding taking AET, and could facilitate future research
in this field. Women are prescribed AET between 5 and
10
years after completion of primary cancer treatment
(Davies et al., 2013; Goss et al., 2005; Gray, 2013), and
adherence over the entire course is generally low, with con-
sequent increased risk of cancer recurrence and mortality
(Hershamn et al., 2010; McCowan et al., 2008; Makubate
et al., 2013; Partridge et al., 2003). Reasons for not adher-
ing to AET need to be investigated at an individual and
population level. The BMQ-AET evaluated in this article
could facilitate a better understanding of factors which
affect adherence to AET following breast cancer, to help
develop interventions to support patients in engaging with
this treatment and coping with the challenging side effects
that might result.
