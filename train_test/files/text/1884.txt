Abstract
Background: Recent reports suggest that alcohol use may have a protective effect on obesity.
This study explores association between obesity and alcohol consumption in the non-smoking U.S.
adult population.
Methods: We analyzed data on a total of 8,236 respondents who participated in the Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey. Body mass index (weight-kg/height-m2) was
derived from measured height and weight data and categorized into: normal weight, overweight,
and obese. Alcohol consumption was measured using following measures: history of drinking, binge
drinking, quantity of drinks/day, frequency of drinking, and average volume of drinks/week.
Results: Mean body mass index in this sample of non-smokers was 26.4 (95% CI: 26.1, 26.7).
Approximately 46% of respondents were classified as current drinkers. Current drinkers had lower
odds of obesity (Adjusted odds ratio = 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55, 0.97) as compared to non-drinkers. The
odds of overweight and obesity were significantly greater among binge drinkers and those
consuming four or more drinks/day. However, those who reported drinking one or two drinks per
day had 0.46 (95% CI: 0.34, 0.62) and 0.59 (95% CI: 0.41, 0.86) times the odds of obesity,
respectively. Similarly, the odds of obesity were significantly lower among those who reported
drinking frequently and consuming less than five drinks per week. The association between
overweight and other alcohol measures was less pronounced.
Conclusion: The results suggest further exploring the possible role of moderate alcohol drinking
in controlling body weight in adults.
Background
The proportion of the population that is overweight or
obese has increased steadily in many developed nations
including the U.S. [1,2]. The continual rise in the preva-
lence of obesity is of concern to public health agencies
because of its potentially explosive effect on the health of
individuals and the cost to the health care system [3,4].
Alcohol consumption is common in the U.S., with the
past-month prevalence of consuming at least one drink is
reported at fifty percent among 12 years and older [5].
Average intake of alcohol among adults in the U.S. is
approximately 10% of the total daily energy intake [6].

Alcohol, which is the second most energy dense macronu-
trient consumed [7], is known to reduce oxidation of fat
and favors fat storage which may result in weight gain [8].
However, previous studies have shown that despite the
added calories, alcohol drinkers do not gain extra weight
as compared to non-drinkers [6]. Other studies have
reported a J-shaped relationship between alcohol con-
sumption and body mass index and waist-to-hip ratio
such that light to moderate drinking has beneficial effect
in reducing weight whereas non-drinking and heavy or
risky drinking having the opposite effect [9,10]. However,
the inverse association between alcohol drinking and
weight gain has been prominent among women with the
results among men remaining inconclusive [9,11-14]. The
aims of this study were to assess the cross-sectional rela-
tionship between alcohol drinking and obesity in a
nationally representative sample of non-smoking adults,
using different measures of alcohol consumption.
Methods
Sample selection
The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
III is a large cross-sectional survey of non-institutionalized
U.S. population conducted between 1988 and 1994 [15].
Data for this study were extracted from two data files: the
adult questionnaire and the physical examination data
file. Initially, a total of 19,618 respondents 18 years or
older were selected. Those who were pregnant (n = 322)
or whose information on lifetime drinking (n = 2850) or
drinking in the previous 12 months (n = 2) were missing
were excluded from the analysis. The analysis was limited
only to lifetime non-smokers leaving a final sample size of
8,236.
Variables
The main dependent variable was body mass index (BMI
= Weight in kg/height in m2). Weight and height were
measured during physical examination of study partici-
pants. BMI was recorded from the physical examination
data file and categorized into normal weight (BMI<25 kg/
m2), overweight (BMI 25 kg/m2­29.9 kg/m2) and obese
(BMI 30 kg/m2).
The main independent variable of interest was alcohol
consumption. Alcohol consumption was measured using
these questions: 1) History of drinking: in your entire life,
have you had at least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic bever-
age (variable MAPE1)? In the past 12 months did you have at
least 12 drinks of any kind of alcoholic beverage (variable
MAPE2)?; 2) Quantity of drinking: on the average, on the
days that you drank alcohol, how many drinks did you have a
day (variable MAPE4)?, those consuming four or more
drinks were classified as heavy drinkers; 3) Frequency of
drinking (Number of drinking days): in the past 12 months,
how many days of the year did you drink any alcoholic bever-
ages (variable MAPE3s)?; 4) Average volume of drinking
alcoholic beverages = frequency*quantity/52, and 5)
Binge drinking: In the past 12 months, how many days of the
year did you have 5 or more drinks on a single day (variable
MAPE6S)? The variables MAPE1 and MAPE2 were used to
classify respondents to non-drinker, ex-drinker, and cur-
rent drinker categories. A drink was considered as a 12-oz
beer, a 4-oz glass of wine, or an ounce of liquor. In
NHANES III no distinction was made between different
types of alcoholic drinks. The covariates included in the
model were gender, age, race/ethnicity, marital status,
poverty income ratio, education, rural/urban, self-rated
health, and leisure time physical activity.
Statistical analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to describe the characteris-
tics of the study sample by drinking status. The association
between weight status and risky alcohol drinking, which
included both heavy drinking and binge drinking, was
modeled using logistic regression analysis. The associa-
tion between BMI and different measures of alcohol con-
sumption was assessed using chi-square statistics.
Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to
assess relationship between the categorical BMI variable
and alcohol consumption adjusted for all the covariates.
In a multinomial logistic regression model the odds of
associations for both the overweight and obese categories
were compared simultaneously to the normal weight cat-
egory which was used as a common referent. Odds ratios
and 95 percent confidence intervals were computed and
adjusted for the confounding effects of age, sex, race/eth-
nicity, poverty income ratio, education, marital status,
rural/urban, self-rated health, and leisure time physical
activities. Because of the complex survey design, STATA
statistical software version 8.2 (College Station, TX),
which allows incorporation of sampling weights, strata,
and primary sampling units, was used to perform all the
analyses.
Results
The overall prevalence of overweight (25 kg/m2<BMI< 30
kg/m2) and obesity (BMI30 kg/m2) in this sample of
never smokers was 31.4 percent (95% CI: 29.5, 33.4) and
21.9 percent (95% CI: 20.0, 23.8), respectively. Although
men had the highest prevalence of overweight 39.6 per-
cent (95% CI: 36.1, 43.1), the prevalence of obesity was
highest among women 24.9 percent (95% CI: 22.3, 27.4).
Non-Hispanic Blacks had the highest prevalence of obes-
ity (33.0 percent, 95% CI: 30.5, 35.5).
Approximately 46 percent of the sample was categorized
as current drinkers; about ten percent were classified as
heavy drinkers, consuming four or more drinks per day
(Table 1). The prevalence of current drinking was almost
twice among male non-smokers as compared to female

non-smokers (63 percent vs 35 percent, p < 0.001). The
mean (geometric mean) number of alcohol drinks con-
sumed per day by the respondents was 2.3; 2.8 drinks/day
among men and 1.9 drinks/day among women. Almost
one-third of obese individuals were current drinkers.
Table 2 presents the cross-sectional relationship between
obesity and drinking patterns. The odds of obesity among
current drinkers were 0.73 times lower than the odds
among non-drinkers (95%CI: 0.55, 0.97). Significantly
greater odds of overweight and obesity were observed

among those engaged in binge drinking. Similarly, those
who reported drinking four or more drinks per day had 30
percent greater odds of being overweight (95%CI: 1.00,
1.68) and 46 percent greater odds of obesity (95%CI:
0.98, 2.17); however respondents who reported drinking
one or two drinks/day had significantly lower odds of
obesity. When examining the frequency of drinking days,
significantly lower odds of obesity were observed among
respondents in higher quartiles. Similarly, those who con-
sumed less than five drinks/week had 0.62 times reduce
odds of obesity (95%CI: 0.46, 0.82) as compared to non/
ex-drinkers (Table 2). The results were less pronounced in
the overweight category.
Discussion
This cross-sectional study found an inverse relationship
between moderate consumption of alcohol and obesity in
a large representative sample of non-smoking U.S. adults.
Current drinkers had the lowest odds of obesity. A dose-
response relationship was observed with increasing quan-
tity of drinks and odds of obesity. Study participants
reporting drinking one or two drinks per day had lower
odds of obesity. The association was less pronounced in
the overweight category.
The major limitation of our study lies in its cross-sectional
nature which precludes establishing any cause and effect

relationship. The strength of our study was that it includes
anthropometric measurements of body mass index which
makes our results more reliable and avoids potential bias
that may result from self-reported height and weight data.
However, we note that our findings confirm those
reported in studies using self-reported height and weight.
We used different measures of alcohol drinking habits to
illuminate the role of alcohol drinking on obesity, which
only few of the cross-sectional studies have done before.
However, the accuracy of self-reported data on alcohol
consumption is subject to debate. Assuming under-report-
ing of alcohol consumption by study respondents, it is
likely that our study results are biased downwards. Meas-
urement of alcohol use also has not been consistent in
epidemiological studies. Differences in measurements can
make cross-study comparisons difficult. Our study was
limited to persons who never smoked; hence findings are
not generalizable to smokers or past smokers. Use of odds
ratio, instead of prevalence ratio, as an effect measure in a
cross-sectional study of diseases of high prevalence has
been shown to overestimate the true association [16]. Sta-
tistical methods to estimate prevalence ratio and its vari-
ance in a survey sample using a categorical outcome
variable are not well developed; hence the odds ratio
remain the effect measure of choice in such studies.
In this study, the odds of overweight and obesity were sig-
nificantly higher among those who indulged in binge
drinking and/or heavy drinking (consuming four or more
drinks/day). In contrast, light-to-moderate drinking (con-
suming one or two drinks/day) was associated with lower
odds of overweight and obesity. We observed a J-shape
pattern, reported by others [9,10] among women binge
drinkers and both men and women heavy drinkers (con-
suming four or more drinks/day). The odds of obesity
were twice (Adjusted OR = 2.36, 95%CI: 1.58, 3.53) as
likely among women binge drinkers and non/ex-drinkers
(Adjusted OR = 2.09, 95%CI: 1.46, 2.99) as compared to
non-bingers. No significant association was found among
overweight women or overweight and/or obese men. For
heavy drinkers, the adjusted odds of obesity were 2.40
(95%CI: 1.23, 4.58) for women and 2.25 (95%CI: 1.45,
3.48) for men heavy drinkers and 1.82 (95%CI: 1.32,
2.51) for women and 1.52 (95%CI: 1.00, 2.30) for men
non/ex-drinkers, as compared to those who consumed
less than fours drinks/day. In our earlier study of primary
care patients we did not observe any association between
obesity and binge drinking, possibly due to a small sam-
ple size [13]. Binge drinking is considered as high risk
drinking and consumption of a high amount of alcohol
has been associated with increased morbidity, mortality,
and poor self-rated health [17-19]; approximately 8% of
the U.S. adult population engages in risky drinking behav-
ior [20]. In a prospective study of British adults, Wannam-
ethee and Shaper [18], reported that heavy alcohol
drinkers ( 30 g/d) had the highest prevalence of weight
gain and obesity, irrespective of the type of alcohol con-
sumed.
Other studies have shown an inverse association between
increasing quantity of alcohol consumption and weight
gain. In a study of Danish adults, Vadstrup et al [21]
found an inverse association of waist circumference
(measured ten years after the baseline) with total drinks of
wine consumed per week. Those who consumed one to
seven drinks per week had smallest waist circumference.
No information on other measures of drinking was avail-
able. In a randomized controlled trial of German adults,
Flechtner-Mors et al. [22] evaluated the effectiveness of
energy restricted diet among moderate alcohol drinkers
(consuming one/two drinks/day) and found a reduction
in body weight among overweight and obese individuals.
Breslow and Smothers [14] assessed the relationship
between the continuous measure of BMI and four catego-
ries of quantity of drinking and also found a linear dose-
response relationship between BMI and increasing quan-
tity of drinking alcohol. Our results were similar but pro-
vided additional information that the beneficial effect of
drinking disappears beyond consuming two drinks a day
and may actually result in weight gain with heavy drink-
ing.
The frequency of drinking was inversely related to obesity
in this sample. Respondents consuming alcohol more fre-
quently were less likely to be obese. In a recent study of
primary care patients attending community clinics, we
[13] found a significantly lower odds of obesity among
those who consumed alcohol three or more days per
month as compared to non-drinkers (Adjusted OR = 0.49,
p = 0.037). Tolstrup et al [23] studied both the quantity
and frequency of drinking in a Dannish population. The
odds of obesity were lower among frequent drinkers, con-
suming alcohol seven days a week, as compared to those
drinking less frequently. Similarly, Breslow and Smothers
[14] also found the lowest BMI among persons who drank
small quantities regularly. The effect was primarily
observed among females. In our study the association was
similar among males and females. The consistency of the
inverse relationship observed between obesity and fre-
quency of drinking suggest that the beneficial effect of
drinking on obesity is present when the alcohol is con-
sumed in moderate amounts on a regular basis.
We also explored association between overweight/obesity
and average volume of drinking per week. Those drinking
less than five drinks per week had lower odds of obesity.
It has been argued that the association between BMI and
alcohol consumption is obscured when average volume is
used as a measure of alcohol consumption [14]. However,
BMC Public Health 2005, 5:126 http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2458/5/126

our results were consistent with the results obtained using
other measures of alcohol consumption in the study.
Conclusion
The beneficial effect of moderate use of alcohol beverages
on diabetes and other chronic diseases has been well
established [24-27]. However, prospective epidemiologi-
cal studies are needed to confirm if the same beneficial
effects can be extended to the obesity. Actively promoting
moderate use of alcohol as a strategy to combat obesity
would be inappropriate at this early stage of our under-
standing about the underlying mechanisms that link alco-
hol use with weight control. Furthermore, it should be
noted that the data give no evidence to advise non-drink-
ers to start drinking alcohol just for reducing body weight.
However, the evidence reported here argues against a
strategy of promoting complete abstention at-least among
those who regularly consume alcohol.
