Article
Even though we cannot say that there is a universal lack of
workers, depending on the occupation, region, and industry,
we can say that there are some skill shortages (Bryant &
Jaworski, 2011; Bryant & King, 2007; R. Hall & Lansbury,
2006). These skill shortages lead employers to want to retain
the employees that they need. Retention management uses
HR strategies that are effective to reduce voluntary turnover
of employees, which organizations find undesirable (De Vos
& Meganck, 2008).
The issue of retention is the opposite of the intention to
leave. Mobley, Horner, and Hollingsworth (1978) show an
increase in dissatisfied employees at work wanting to leave
their job. There are many studies on the relationship between
causal variables and the intention to leave (or turnover):
studies focusing on remuneration (Dale-Olsen, 2006;
Griffeth, Hom, & Gaertner, 2000; Min, 2007; Myers &
Dreachslin, 2007; Shaw, Delery, Jenkins, & Gupta, 1998),
training (Davies, Taylor, & Savery, 2001), the selection pro-
cess (Barrick & Zimmerman, 2005, 2009; Myers &
Dreachslin, 2007; O'Connell & Kung, 2007), company size
(Min, 2007), work life balance (D'Annunzio-Green,
Maxwell, Watson, & Deery, 2008), the relationship between
workers and their superiors, and commitment to supervisors
(DeConinck, 2009; Paillé, 2009; Vandenberghe & Bentein,
2009). Other researchers tackle factors that may predict turn-
over. Griffeth etal. (2000) point out in their meta-analysis
that the best predictors of turnover are job satisfaction, orga-
nizational commitment, job search, the comparison of
alternatives (compared with the baseline), withdrawal, and
intention to leave.
When employees leave their organization, this has an
effect both on individual careers and on the organization. In
a labor market marked by skill shortages, there are individu-
als who have no organizational boundaries and there are
organizations which want to retain employees inside their
boundaries. The maritime transport industry is currently
experiencing some skill shortages especially among deck
officers despite their efforts to retain them. Our research
question stems from interviews showing that future deck
officers expect their career at sea to last from 10 to 15 years.
We therefore wish to know the possible consequences of this
on the maritime transport industry and propose a model of
interwoven careers, that is, mixing careers within and across
organizational boundaries. In this article, we start by review-
ing career literature, the maritime context, and some com-
plexity theories. We continue with our methodological and
epistemological choices, and finish with our results and a
discussion.

From a Seafarer's Career Management to
the Management of Interwoven Sea- and
Shore-Based Careers
Marie-Noëlle Albert1, Nadia Lazzari Dodeler1, and Emmanuel Guy1
Abstract
This study proposes a model of interwoven careers. This topic stems from interviews that showed that although future deck
officers expect their future career at sea to last from 10 to 15 years and that the rest will be spent on shore, the maritime
transport industry's only goal is to attract and retain them as seagoing officers. This ambivalent situation leads us to develop
a model of interwoven careers that is new. It takes into account both the individual and the organization. This is neither a
traditional career model nor a boundaryless model. We used Morin's complexity theory to understand boundaries, which
move "within" organizations when, for instance, maritime industries offer deck officers to work on shore and sometimes at
sea, and "across" organizations when they develop partnerships to help their employees attain their goals as well as retaining
them in their organization.

Careers
Although traditional careers within an organization, often
focusing on the same job, are characterized by hierarchical
advancement without taking into account individuals' envi-
ronment, new forms of careers focus on individuals'mobility
within a professional field or the labor market (DeFillippi &
Arthur, 1996). Since D. T. Hall's (1976) article, career stud-
ies have often referred to the concept of the Protean career.
D. T. Hall describes it as the opposite of a traditional career,
in which the person is in charge (whereas, traditionally, it is
the organization), the degree of mobility is high, and the core
values are freedom and growth rather than advancement.
DeFillippi and Arthur (1994) are among the first authors to
speak of "boundaryless careers" based on the individual and
not on the organization. This kind of career would replace
the traditional one (e.g., Arthur, 2008; Arthur, Inkson, &
Pringle, 1999; Arthur & Rousseau, 1996; Hassard, Morris, &
McCann, 2012). Even for Gunz (1989), it is important to
manage careers both at the individual and at the organiza-
tional levels. To Gunz, Bergmann Lichten, and Long (2002),
boundaries could enclose several kinds of social systems,
such as organizational, regional, or industry. Dries, Van
Acker, and Verbruggen (2012) explain that contemporary
career literature makes three general assumptions: First, the
best people are in boundaryless careers; second, these kinds
of careers are usually more satisfying; and, third, the empha-
sis is placed on career self-management rather than organiza-
tional career management (Forrier, Sels, & Stynen, 2009).
Employees have the ability to manage their careers as "free
agents" (Tulgan, 2001). In recent years, this concept has
been more criticized and more nuanced: Organizational
careers are not completely extinct, and boundaryless careers
are not necessarily better for people (Dries & Verbruggen,
2012). Hassard etal. (2012) show that "new careers" may
increase insecurity and anxiety among employees. These
authors do not find proof that boundaryless careers exist.
Their sample included managers who were bound by many
factors, such as location, spouse's occupation, family obliga-
tions, and so forth.
Super's (1957) model shows that individuals go through
four stages of career development during their professional
lives: exploration, establishment, maintenance, and disen-
gagement. Recently, research has shown that the mainte-
nance phase can be shortened, that exploration and
establishment can happen several times, and that there can be
multiple occurrences of disengagement instead of just one at
the end of a career. Other researchers have shown that the
priorities of individual careers change. The theory of career
anchors proposed by Schein (1978, 1996) shows that the
self-concept (talents, skills, values, motivation, and needs)
developed by individuals throughout their professional expe-
riences can be articulated around eight anchors among which
only one would be dominant. The "technical" anchor refers
to individuals who are mainly interested in the technical side
of their work; the "managerial" anchor refers to individuals
who prefer skills related to management; the "autonomy/
independence" anchor refers to individuals who wish to
become their own boss and work at their own pace; the
"security/stability" anchor refers to persons seeking a career
that gives them stability and a long-term employment; the
"creativity/stability" anchor refers to those who have entre-
preneurial attitudes and want to work in an environment that
allows them to be creative; the "dedication to a cause" anchor
is found in individuals who wish to help others; the "pure
challenge" anchor refers to people who like challenges and
want to solve problems considered intractable; and finally,
the "quality of life" anchor refers to individuals looking for
satisfaction and harmony between work and family life.
However, the theory of career anchors is challenged by
more recent studies, including those of Lévy-Leboyer,
Louche, and Rolland (2006); Martineau, Wils, and Tremblay
(2005); and Lazzari (2012) who believe that individuals can
change their anchors during their work life and that many
anchors can coexist in the same individual. Indeed, as noted
by Feldman and Bolino (1996), this multiplicity of anchors is
due to the fact that some anchors respond to career choices,
while other anchors characterize the individual's needs and
values at a given moment of a career. According to Super
(1980) and Williams and Savickas (1990), balancing profes-
sional and personal life also seems to be an important ele-
ment for individuals in the maintenance phase; for other
individuals, it is a priority (Ng & Feldman, 2007).
Finally, it is important to note that historically the theory
of careers is constructed from models based on male partici-
pants (Sullivan, Mainiero, Perrewé, & Ganster, 2007). Thus,
whether we are talking about traditional or new, these career
models do not seem to fit with the complexity of women's
careers. Moreover, studies are increasingly focusing on chal-
lenges faced by men to reconcile work and family. All these
theories reveal turning points in careers often related to fam-
ily responsibilities. It therefore seems desirable that organi-
zations implement a human resources management (HRM)
that focuses on each individual for the purpose of job reten-
tion. There is tension between individuals who aspire to
careers without organizational boundaries and organizational
goals which seek to retain employees, as explained in the
following section.
The Maritime Context
When maritime studies turned to career issues, they histori-
cally tended to frame the problem in terms of the supply and
demand of manpower. For example, McConville (1979) pon-
ders on the threats posed by the decline of British seafarers in
the wake of the raise of open registry flags. Most influential
in this trend are certainly the surveys led by the Baltic and
International Maritime Council (BIMCO) and the
International Shipping Federation (ISF). This exercise is
made of a series of national surveys supported by both
Albert et al. 3
employers and unions, first conducted in 1990 and updated
every 5 years, evaluated the number of ratings and officers
available to man the world fleet, as well as their nationality
and their age profiles. The surveys gave rise to a number of
critics among researchers (Obando-Rojas, 1999) but were
nonetheless instrumental in documenting upcoming skill
shortage, in particular for officers. They contributed to estab-
lishing the feared shortage as a central issue for many ship-
ping advocacy groups worldwide (Fei & Lu, 2015; Leggate,
2004; Obando-Rojas, 1999; Thai, Balasubramanyam, Yeoh,
& Norsofiana, 2013). In the French­Canadian context, the
manpower shortage paradigm is one of the dominant ratio-
nales of the Comité sectoriel de main-d'oeuvre de l'industrie
maritime, which recently commissioned a new study to eval-
uate the future balance between supply and demand for job
positions in the St. Lawrence maritime industry (Zins
Beauchesne et associés, 2013). This focus on the number of
available certified seafarers not only frames the debate in
research circles but also orients policy responses toward
recruitment. Public awareness campaigns--aimed at young
people completing their high school studies, and sending the
message that seafaring offers great career opportunities with
high salaries and technology-filled tasks--appear as the
most frequent response to avoid the apprehended skill short-
age in Canada and in Europe (Langevin, Beaudry, Guy, &
Frenette, 2009). The immediate goal is to increase the num-
ber of cadets in training. In contrast, recent non-specific
industry contributions to HRM frequently adopt a more qual-
itative approach focusing on personal motivation and satis-
faction at work. The argument is that in a competitive context
in which skilled workers are rare, employers should pay
greater attention to the retention of current employees. A few
recent contributions take this perspective with respect to the
maritime industry. Cahoon, Caesar, and Fei (2014) and
Caesar, Cahoon, and Fei (2015) expose how proactive HRM
can develop and maintain a sustainable seafarer workforce.
De Silva, Stanton, and Stanton (2011) show the importance
of long-term career prospects, smooth and fair recruitment
process, employee-friendly organizational culture, and a bet-
ter relationship with maritime authorities for seafarer reten-
tion. Moving from seagoing to shore-based employment is
recognized as an important phase in this perspective. Haka,
Borch, Jensen, and Leppin (2011) explore difficulties
involved in this transition and where they originate. In the
recent past, seagoing careers stopped when children (often at
the second one) were born or when a shore-based job oppor-
tunity appeared (Honoré, 2010). Thomas, Sampson, and
Zhao (2003) show the impact of work conditions on seafar-
ers' families and explore how companies could minimize the
impact of a seafaring lifestyle.
Ship officers also seem to be drawn to boundaryless
careers. Indeed, the careers of ship officers begin by training
at sea, allowing sailors to access all careers in the maritime
industry, as well as structuring individual careers in two
stages, that is, one at sea and one on land. As we will
demonstrate with the empirical material presented in this
article, deck cadets who we interviewed envisioned working
at sea only for a few years (for different reasons). Some com-
plexity theories helped us better understand the tension
between the expectations of cadets and those of the
industry.
Some Complexity Theories
Etymologically, the word complexity comes from the French
word complexité, which comes from the Latin complexus
which mean interwoven (Edmonds & Gershenson, 2013).
Alhadeff-Jones (2008) describes three generations of com-
plexity theories. In the first generation, we can find some
information and communication theories, or cybernetics, that
emerge from the Second World War. In the second genera-
tion, there are studies developed during the 1960s such as
Simon (1962). Two kinds of paths are distinguished for the
third generation (1980s). The first path is often encountered
in the English-speaking field of non-linear dynamics, evolu-
tionary biology, and artificial sciences. The second path is
linked to French thinkers such as Le Moigne or Morin. For
the purpose of this study, we have aligned our concept of
complexity with the latter group.
Morin (2007) proposes a difference between two kinds of
complexity. He calls the first one "restricted complexity"
because it is limited to systems that are empirically complex
since they come in a variety of processes with multiple rela-
tionships, which are interdependent and associated retroac-
tively. In fact, complexity is never questioned nor thought of
from an epistemological perspective. In the restricted com-
plexity, scientists want to "decomplexify" to find universal
principle. On the contrary, generalized complexity "relates to
our knowledge as human beings, individuals, persons and
citizens" (Morin, 2007, p. 21). We based our choice of epis-
temological paradigm on the generalized complexity.
Complexity is not merely composed of indicators of tension
or conflicts occurring within organizations. If this was the
case, it would only be difficulties--albeit complex ones--
needing to be clarified for good decision making to occur.
They can neither seem to be reduced to a simple source of
uncertainty that should be factored in by good practices of
organizational risk management, nor should they be seen as
solvable by improved communication practices. In other
words, as a conceptual framework, we refute considering
complexity as a negative problematic dimension. Rather, we
propose to view it as fundamental characteristics of manage-
rial situations. At individual, organizational, and institutional
levels, complexities exist and are ever present. Therefore, the
challenge faced by researchers appears to be integrating in
their thinking the ambivalent nature of their object of study
as opposed to study factors causing complexity, to explore
ways around it. Hence, this simple theoretical posture has
important methodological implications that we will discuss
in the next section.

Epistemology and Method
The paradigm of pragmatic constructivism is based on radi-
cal constructivism as conceptualized by von Glasersfeld
(2001), Le Moigne, as well as Dewey and Piaget (Avenier,
2010). In this epistemological paradigm, knowledge neither
claims to reflect an ontological reality (for nobody could
rationally prove its existence) nor does it reveal its character-
istics when this reality exists. The pragmatic constructivism
is not so extreme that it rejects the notion of essence entirely
(Grint, 1998). In this paradigm, while knowledge is being
constructed, there is no disjunction between the inquirer and
the phenomenon being inquired into (Avenier, 2010). They
simply cannot be separated because what results from the
observer's viewpoint (an explicit or implicit theoretical
hypothesis) is that which influences observations. Pragmatic
constructivism considers that Truth is meaningless because
of the way knowledge is built from human representations to
give meaning to situations in which people are involved.
Therefore, producing knowledge does not mean having a
true representation of reality but rather possessing ways and
means to understand life.
Reflexive work is what researchers do when they behave
as reflexive practitioners of scientific research. It consists of
tracking what seems self-evident and digging into both the
implicit assumptions and the deep meaning of the notions
that are used or newly introduced. The researcher often uses
a large body of academic literature to understand local
knowledge, not to seem scientific but to stand back and
understand it differently (Albert & Couture, 2015).
This methodological process is schematized in Figure 1.
It starts with the definition of the research topic. With their
practical experiences and their theoretical knowledge,
researchers can build an initial model (pre-model). Some
experiential testimonio (Albert & Couture, 2014) from prac-
titioners have been iteratively investigated, reformulated,
and interpreted in literature. This process makes it possible
for researchers to highlight theoretical gaps. In interpreting
local knowledge, researchers can build generic knowledge
that can be communicated to the scientific community and
to practitioners. This knowledge can be appropriated by
practitioners and contextualized again to become guidelines
for action. Some feedback on this possible activation may
help to improve this knowledge. This research therefore rep-
resents an abductive process, that is to say, a constant back
and forth motion between empirical information and the
theories and concepts used to understand this process.
In this article, we present the first loop in this process.
We investigated some testimonies and interpreted them with

literature. We produced some generic knowledge and com-
municate them. This knowledge allows us to pursue our
investigation and start a second loop. For the exploratory
step of the research, we interviewed five deck cadets and
three professors from a maritime institute in the hopes of
understanding how to manage the careers of future deck
officers. Participants had completed about two thirds of
their sea time and courses. Teachers were deck officers who
go back at sea every year. Interviews were conducted with a
guide (Patton, 2002). Some issues to be explored have been
listed (how deck cadets expect to live their future career at
sea, if they anticipate a boundaryless or a more traditional
career, how teachers choose to stop their seagoing career,
and how they expect their future career at sea or ashore).
They are similar to the informal conversational interview
(Patton, 2002) on career choices of the participant and their
career aspirations. This kind of interview resembles more
like a chat, during which the participants may sometimes
forget that they are being interviewed. Most of the questions
asked flow from the immediate context.
This kind of instrument provides more complex informa-
tion than standardized open-ended interview, which is more
consistent with our paradigm choice. We are aware that it is
impossible to make generalizations as our sample was small.
This was a first loop in our process. However, this is not a
validity criterion in the paradigm of pragmatic constructiv-
ism. The epistemic work related to each interview is more
important than the number of participants. The objective is
not to validate and generalize a model, but to build knowl-
edge that can make sense and be reinterpreted by others. We
presented the results of this study to practitioners who were
interested. In pragmatic constructivism, this pragmatic inter-
est is a quality criterion.
Results and Discussion
We interviewed cadets who had completed about two thirds
of their sea time and courses, and who wished to continue in
this career. We know that many cadets do not continue in the
seafarer career (Cahoon etal., 2014; Gekara, 2009; Gould,
2010); they usually graduate knowing they will not work at
sea.
In the words of an experienced teacher:
And I think that those who don't see themselves in the process,
quickly, from the moment they come on board as officer cadet,
will know if they like it or not.
Participants said they enjoyed life at sea but were not sure
they wished to continue as deck officers until their
retirement.
A cadet who expected to work about 15 years at sea:
Well, I'm finishing my course next year, and I really intend to
sail. Mainly locally, I think. I think I would like to do one or two
foreign going trips. But I prefer the Gulf, the river, maybe the
lakes too. I really liked my experience on lakes, too, the seaway.
I prefer coastal navigation, maneuvering, berthing, loading/
unloading. I find it . . . but the foreign going trip, we have to
admit it, it's the foreign going certificate that we'll get. I'd still
hope to use it one day. But, actually, to make a living
professionally, I imagine myself more onshore, near the coast.
. . . At least, it's sailing to get my master certificates because it
opens doors onshore too. It's a certificate that allows you to
work on smaller boats, yes, but always as a master. For me, the
objective is to aim higher so that I have more options. At least 15
years, I hope. 15 years, maybe less, let's say more or less 5%.
A cadet who wanted to continue, but just part-time:
Up to now, I'm really happy with my internships and experience.
Well, obviously, when I get there, I'll be 39 years old. So if I
work 15 years, that makes me 55 or 54, and I intend to work
until I'm 65 years old. So, I'll probably slow down when I reach
50 or 55. Often, as an officer, you get $100,000 for 6 months of
work. A captain gets a lot more. Since I've been back at school
. . . we've been able to live on $30,000 per year, my girlfriend,
my daughter and me. So, that's it, do I work to make money or
do I work to save money to do more on my time off? In my case,
I choose the second. So, instead of working 6 months making
$100,000, maybe when I get to 50 I'll work 3 months making
$50,000. That way I'll have enough to live on.
A cadet who wanted more opportunities:
Do this [for my entire career]? Maybe not. Well, of course, over
the years, you go up the ladder and get better jobs. You become
chief officer, captain, and from there you can choose what you
want to do because the doors are open to you.
A young woman cadet who wished to work only about 10
to 15 years at sea but was open to going back to sea after:
Maybe 15 years, about. Until, well, right now I'm 21 years old.
Well, I'm 20. So that leads to 30 or 35. At least 35, and after that
. . . work in admin, most likely. In a company office. . . . the only
reason to stop, right now, would be to have a family, to have
children. So, I think, 30 or 35 is pretty much the limit. So, that's
mainly why. Maybe after having my kids, when we're older, I
could certainly get back on board.
According to Sullivan etal. (2007), it is important to offer
other career models to women who want to reconcile work
and family. Such new models may be interesting for an
increasing number of men who also want to find a balance
between their work and family life. This is consistent with
the findings of Williams and Savickas (1990). For this rea-
son, it is important to create new career models.
All of the cadets interviewed had established that they
liked life at sea and expressed commitment to start a seafar-
ing career. All voiced the wish to obtain their master mariner
certification. However, all had already planned to stop work-
ing at sea in 10 to 15 years. As such, it appeared difficult to
separate sea and shore-based careers. In a study on French
6 SAGE Open
maritime industries, Honoré (2010) shows that a seafarer's
career is usually a sequence of periods of activity at sea and
ashore. He proposes to develop a model that creates career
paths for alternating periods, in the more or less long term,
spent at sea and spent ashore. Thus, it would be important for
the maritime industry to manage these two kinds of interwo-
ven careers. This is close to Morin's (2001) dialogical prin-
ciple that combines two notions or principles, whether
antinomic or antagonistic, and therefore according to the
Aristotelian logic, while they should exclude one another, in
practice, they appear complementary, indissociable, and
indispensable to understand a particular phenomenon.
Teachers could work both at shore and at sea.
An experienced teacher:
It's something [boarding once in a while] that I think is
interesting because it allows me to keep a direct contact with the
industry. It also allows me to keep my name in the network,
which is a good thing, and allows me to stay up to date in the
field regarding the various rules and regulations, and how one
experiences being a seafarer.
A new teacher:
I'll go back to sail during the summer because I still love sailing.
However, it could be difficult to go back to sea after a few
years spent ashore. For Barnett, Gatfield, Overgaard, Pekcan,
and Graveson (2006), it is hard for a seafarer who has been
ashore for more than 5 to7 years to adapt well to modern sea
life. Even if there is a lack of officers and an interest in for-
mer officers, it may be tough for them to return to sea.
However, this is contrary to a teacher's experience:
It depends on the person. Some will stop. I knew a captain who
stopped for 4 to 5 years. He was completely out of the business,
studied in accounting, was working in a small accounting office,
when he noticed that his spouse had more free time that he'd
thought. So, he decided to go back to the sea. But there are other
people who retire or come ashore after a certain amount of time
because they have to. The maritime industry being such a small
world, word of mouth is all you need to find yourself on a boat.
You ask, "Who needs a captain? Do you know a captain?" "Yes,
captain so and so, he hasn't worked in x number of years, but I
don't know if he still feels like it." So, 3 or 4 phone calls later,
people start coming out of the woodwork! There can be a culture
shock for those who haven't sailed in a long time because they
haven't kept their certificates up to date. They need to write their
exams again. They start studying again, and learn the changes that
were made. There is less culture shock for Canadian vessels than
foreign vessels. Someone who has always sailed in Canada and
goes to another country will find it harder. Someone who has sailed
for other countries or here all there life will find it hard too if they
end up here. It's not the same reality, not the same mentality either.
This verbatim implies more than a bridge from seagoing
to shore-based employment; it means recognizing that the
two may be closely knit. Employers have to anticipate the
second part of their seagoing staff's career to be more pro-
ductive. For some crewing managers this may seem counter-
productive. It may be judged "dangerous" to suggest to
seafarers to work ashore. However, interviews clearly show
that cadets started their career already with this in mind.
There is a need to take into account this reality and to man-
age it. Lesca (2008), based on Aguilar (1967), uses a radar
metaphor to show the importance of looking ahead in busi-
ness. Firms are like ships in storms. Ships need radars and
firms need to look ahead. According to Lesca (2008), look-
ing ahead or anticipating means detecting warning signs of a
possible change in the environment, to act as soon as possi-
ble before the change is complete. To do this, firms must be
active and not just wait for information to come to them.
Without anticipation, a firm is like a ship caught in a storm
without radar, it would probably be inefficient. Lesca (2008)
distinguishes anticipation from forecast. With forecast, we
expect a unique solution and certitude, and we are angry if
what was predicted does not happen. By anticipating, we can
prepare several plans and choose the most appropriate when
the time comes. We are ready to act efficiently and not just
react to the environment. Anticipation is really important in
a complex environment. Human beings are complex. They
are non-trivial machines, not only because the outside
observer cannot predict all human behavior with certainty
but also because humans carry in themselves a principle of
uncertainty that is their freedom. They are non-trivial
machines because they have the possibility of deviating from
the norm, they have a potential for catalysis, they can dis-
cover, and they can make decisions. Each invention and cre-
ation reveals the non-trivial nature of the human mind
(Morin, 2001).
Viljoen and Müller (2012) explore their understanding of
relationships between seafarers and their families. These
authors show how such relationships are complex and con-
tradictory. Seafarers have to manage different purposes that
seem to be opposed. So, their Self has integrated these con-
tradictions, and the seafarer may or may not choose to priori-
tize them.
An experienced teacher:
The other phenomenon is that those who sail for a long time will
find that the people around them change a lot. We have students
who keep their girlfriends all along. She may or may not
understand that as a cadet you do go to sea, but once it's done
he'll be home more often, or whatever. Except that when young
officers start to sail, they try to get to sea as quickly as possible,
and when the people around them are faced with this reality--
that what they lived during training is what their career will be
like--some couples find it hard and break up. Some survive it,
but some don't. So, then, this creates a change, and I think that
it's a determining factor, it's the willingness to prioritize either
family life, life onshore, or life at sea.
Employers cannot act on seafarers'families or friends, but
they can obtain information about them and learn about their
feelings to better anticipate. In this way, they can discover
Albert et al. 7
the different career anchors for each seafarer. Indeed, deck
officers (as other workers) can change their anchors through-
out their working lives, and several anchors can coexist
within them (Lazzari, 2012).
Each officer is a person. A person is both unique and
multi-faceted, different from others. Hence, a person cannot
be understood by observing only one facet, and though
grasping all of them may seem difficult, researchers and spe-
cialists must keep in mind a person's multi-faceted composi-
tion (Melé, 2012). Each individual lives his experiences as a
singular subject (Morin, 2001). For instance, among the
cadets interviewed, some liked routine work, whereas others
avoided it. A unique optimal solution is therefore unlikely.
Companies have to build several models to answer the needs
of their seagoing workforce. Without HRM centered on per-
sons--who they are and their aspirations--companies
expose themselves to increased hidden costs associated with
poor retention and the loss of precious operational expertise.
Although management often only looks into the costs related
to their division, there are numerous other hidden costs
(Garman, Corbett, Grady, & Benesh, 2005). It may be less
costly for the organization to consider all of the skills avail-
able in an organization as well as the individual's aspirations,
even if they are not measurable. Happy people are less
stressed. Thus, the American Institute of Stress estimates that
work-related stress costs American companies over US$300
billion per year (Bishara & Schipani, 2009). Thinking HRM
differently in the maritime industry may help companies
avoid a certain amount of recruiting and all costs related to
training, absenteeism, and presenteeism (Cascio & Boudreau,
2010). As Cahoon and Haugstetter (2008) note,
[C]areer options need to be explained at an early stage because
GenerationYmay make their career choices on those that provide
the most opportunities. Perhaps at best, the shipping company
should be intending on retaining the seafarer in the organization
whether this is at sea or onshore. The second option is attempting
to retain the seafarer within the shipping industry to ensure the
industry retains valuable and experienced staff. (p. 8)
For these reasons, it is time for the maritime industry to
propose new career models to attract young people and retain
them in the industry as a whole and not only at sea. This
involves getting to know people, their lives, their aspirations,
their career anchors, and so on, to offer adequate training and
manage with complexity cannot be managed, but it is possi-
ble to manage with ambivalence because a person is both
rational and non-rational (Morin, 2001). If we want to put
things in small boxes to put them in order, we cannot manage
with ambivalence. The maritime industry should therefore
manage persons by taking into account the importance of
managing with ambivalence. It should be important to con-
ceive of deck officer careers not as disjunctive but preferably
as the management of interwoven sea and shore-based
careers. This could be in the same organization or in a
maritime industry network. Araujo, Dubois, and Gadde
(2003) conclude with the notion of indirect capabilities of
focusing interfirm networks to move conventional boundaries
in organizations. Indirect capabilities are required to access
complementary and dissimilar capabilities detained by third
parties (Loasby, 1998). Trust among organizations plays an
important role in multi-partner alliances and poses difficulties
to its implementation (Thorgren, Wincent, & Eriksson, 2011).
This construction of collective actions between organizations
should be viewed in a dynamic way through the concept of
"interaction" and not just the static concept of "sharing." This
dialogical mediation allows inter-organizational cooperation
(Lorino & Mourey, 2013). So, cooperation between organiza-
tions should be seen as an alternative coordination mecha-
nism to market and hierarchies (Araujo et
al., 2003).
Organization boundaries should change with cooperation
mechanisms. Future deck officers expect boundaryless
careers. Recruitment and retention policies for at sea work
only are neither sufficient nor efficient. We need to move
beyond traditional boundary career management. New mod-
els must be invented by maritime management to remain
aligned with seafarers' expectations and actions. This new
boundaryless career model must not be organized by individ-
uals or disempowered organizations; it should be managed by
both organizations (and organization networks) and people.
Conclusion
In this article, we presented the results of our interviews and
suggestions regarding how to manage the seagoing and
shore-based employment of officers as interwoven careers.
Our discussion enabled us to propose the development of
new career models for future deck officers. These models
need some changes. Employers should anticipate employees'
wish to change career paths. To do this, they must learn about
their deck officers'lives, aspirations, projects, and so on, and
accept a type of management that includes ambivalence. If
employers do this, they may limit some hidden costs and
become more efficient. The interwoven career model that we
propose is new. It takes into account both the individual and
the organization. This is neither a traditional career nor a
boundaryless career model. Employees could change within
and across organizations. Ambivalent situations experienced
by maritime industries are often unacknowledged and hidden
because they are disturbing. Ambivalence cannot be deemed
usual. These complex realities lead us to propose a complex
solution where all factors are linked and interwoven even if
this leads to a paradigm revolution. Indeed, this complex
solution requires accepting to find solutions in non-
traditional ways. For this solution to work, one agrees to
being open to moving boundaries both within organizations
(when, for instance, maritime industries propose that deck
officers be on shore and sometimes at sea) and across organi-
zations (when they develop partnerships to retain their
employees as well as help the latter attain their goals).
