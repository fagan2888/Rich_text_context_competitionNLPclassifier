Introduction
Teachers have a tremendous impact on students' academic
achievement, and they vary greatly in their effectiveness
(Rockoff, 2004; Weisenberger, Sexton, Mulhern, & Keeling,
2009). There is no doubt that most teachers in schools are
effective and are committed to their students and profession,
and are trying their best to meet students' needs every day.
Research has shown that effective teachers can lead all stu-
dents to learn, even those from poor families or who have
uninvolved parents (Stronge, 2010). But, the key question is,
"If most teachers are effective, does it matter that a small
percentage of them are ineffective?" The answer to this
question is that yes, it matters a lot because one ineffective
teacher inhibits the learning of a large number of students
over time. Teachers are responsible for anywhere from 20 to
200 students each year depending on the school size, class
size, and school level (whether primary or secondary). From
these estimates it is plausible that an ineffective teacher can
depress the achievement and inhibit the learning of many
students during the course of his or her career (Chait, 2010).
The problems posed by ineffective teachers to students
are numerous, and some of the most vivid and influential
memories that students have come from devastating incidents
with ineffective teachers in a hostile learning environment
(Walls, Nardi, von Minden, & Hoffman, 2002). An ineffec-
tive teacher makes it difficult for students to learn or decreases
their desire to learn by a lack of enthusiasm for the subject, by
a hostile or inappropriate behavior toward the students, by a
failure to maintain discipline in the class, or by unfairly pre-
ferring some students to others. Research findings based on
value-added scores of students in schools in the United States
indicates that three straight years of the most ineffective
teachers produce children who average the 45th percentile
nationally. By comparison, three straight years of the most
effective teachers produce children that average the 95th per-
centile. Furthermore, research shows that students do not
"make it up" the next year. The damage of an ineffective
teacher lingers, even if the student has more effective teachers
in the following years (Lasagna, Laine, & Behrstock-Sherrat,
2011; Shearon, 2001).

Abstract
This study examined the salient characteristics of trained ineffective teachers in secondary schools in Kenya. Participants
comprised 80 students from eight schools drawn from four provinces in the country. Of the 80 participants, 40 were females
and 40 were males.This qualitative research adopted phenomenological design.Two research instruments--a biographical
form and a blank sheet of paper--were used in data collection. Content analysis method was used in analyzing the written
and nonquantitative data collected. Results of data analysis revealed 20 salient characteristics of trained ineffective teachers
in secondary schools.These characteristics are as follows: wastage of students' time, poor mastery of the subject, source of
boredom to students, partial treatment of students, lack of respect for students, low level of self-confidence, poor mastery of
teaching skills, emotional immaturity, inappropriate dressing, injurious to students, fond of frivolous talk, miscommunicate in
class, poor in providing feedback, nondialogical in class, poor in maintaining discipline, immoral in behavior, unapproachable to
students, poor in counseling, poor psychological health, and autocratic to students.The findings of this study may be useful to
stakeholders in education in developing instruments that may be used to identify ineffective teachers in schools.

There is evidence in the literature that governmental and
nongovernmental organizations all over the world are grop-
ing for solutions to ineffective teaching. For example, the
U.S. government is hoping to solve the problem by identify-
ing ineffective teachers for assessment, assistance, and sup-
port, and then dismissing them if they do not improve (Jerald,
2009). However, research shows that it is difficult to accu-
rately identify ineffective teachers, that teachers are rarely
dismissed from employment for ineffective teaching, and
that dismissal of ineffective teachers as a means of improv-
ing students' academic performance has received least atten-
tion and mixed reactions. Teacher unions in particular are
against dismissal of ineffective teachers because they believe
that poor academic performance among students is a com-
plex problem that cannot be attributed to ineffective teaching
only. They also argue that there are no proper measures in
place to identify ineffective teachers (Coggshall, 2009).
The proper documentation of the characteristics of inef-
fective teachers is a significant step toward identification of
teachers who possess the characteristics so that they can be
assisted to improve or advised to discontinue discharging
their teaching duties. The identification of ineffective teach-
ers is a worthwhile exercise because poor academic perfor-
mance is common among secondary school students in many
countries including Kenya. For instance, in the year 2010, a
total of 307,171 candidates sat for Kenya Certificate of
Secondary Education (KCSE) examination. A small number
of this candidates--97,134 (32%)--performed well and
obtained grade C+ and above, and therefore qualified to pursue
university education. A large number of the candidates--
201,037 (68%)--performed poorly, got grades C and below,
and did not meet the minimum university entry requirement
(Siringi, 2011). There is no doubt that ineffective teaching is
one of the key factors contributing to this poor academic per-
formance among secondary school students in Kenya.
One of the things educators know for sure about educa-
tion is that there is nothing anyone can do to improve student
achievement that is as important as providing effective
teachers (Chance, 2008). They also agree that every student
has a right to highly effective teachers and there is no justifi-
cation whatsoever for retaining ineffective teachers in
schools who are doing more harm than good to innocent stu-
dents (Acikgoz, 2005). The qualities of effective teachers
have been investigated by several scholars and are fairly well
known. For instance, Stronge, Tucker, and Hindman (2004)
reported that effective teachers are knowledgeable in their
subjects, caring toward their students, fair and respectful to
students; have positive attitudes toward teaching as a profes-
sion; are sociable in class; and are motivating to learners.
Okpala and Ellis (2005) reported that effective teachers are
caring, encouraging, approachable, enthusiastic, respectful,
knowledgeable, empathetic, passionate, and having a sense
of humor. Walls et al. (2002) conducted a qualitative study in
which they examined the qualities of effective teachers and
the characteristics of ineffective teachers. Their findings on
the qualities of effective teachers agree with those reported
by Okpala and Ellis, and by Stronge et al. They reported that
there are five characteristics of ineffective teachers, which
are as follows: partial in treating students, disorganized, less
resourceful, discourage students from asking questions, and
authoritarian in class.
The researchers of this study felt that the five characteris-
tics of ineffective teachers as reported by Walls et al. (2002)
and the four characteristics of ineffective teachers (yelling at
students, giving empty threats, failing to give prompt feed-
back, and giving too much work to students) reported by
Horton (2009) were not exhaustive perhaps because they
involved university students as the participants in their stud-
ies. The purpose of this study therefore was to reexamine the
characteristics of ineffective teachers at the secondary school
level of education. The study sought to identify all aspects of
ineffective teaching that persist in individuals even after they
have been trained and qualified as teachers. The ineffective
teachers whose characteristics were described by the partici-
pants in this study were all trained and qualified as second-
ary school teachers in Kenya.
Objective of the Study
The single objective of this study was to identify the salient
characteristics of trained ineffective secondary school teach-
ers in Kenya. From this objective, one research question was
posed and answered:
Research Question: What do secondary school stu-
dents believe are the salient characteristics of
trained ineffective teachers?
This question was answered by investigating the per-
ception of secondary school students on the characteristics
of their ineffective (worst) teachers. The method used in
this study is explained in the following section.
Method
A qualitative research method was used in this study because
it was most appropriate in the generation of rich narrative
data from students on the characteristics of trained ineffec-
tive teachers in secondary schools in Kenya. This method
involved collection and analysis of nonquantitative data.
Qualitative data collection methods often include open-ended
interviews, direct observations, focus group discussions, and
written documents such as open-ended questionnaires
(Bowen, 2005). In our study, the participants wrote their
descriptions of the characteristics of ineffective teachers on
blank sheets of paper that were provided. The data-gathering
method was chosen to be a written document because open-
ended, face-to-face interviews carry the potential of the
participants feeling pressured, intimidated, or in some way
stressed due to the presence of the interviewer (Jahangiri &
Kodero et al. 3
Mucciolo, 2008). The participants of this study were adoles-
cent secondary school students who could have been intimi-
dated if they were asked by an interviewer to identify a worst
teacher and verbally describe his or her characteristics.
Moreover, this study was conducted during school hours
when involving students in time-consuming open-ended
interviews was considered prohibitive by the researchers.
Within the qualitative research method, the study adopted
phenomenological design because the researchers were
interested in the perceptions of participants to understand inef-
fective teaching as a phenomenon. According to Brumfield
(2006), perceptions of individuals on a phenomenon can be
best investigated through phenomenological studies. Miller
and Salkind (2002) described phenomenology as a method
that seeks to describe the experiences of individuals who are
intimately involved or confronted with a concept or a phe-
nomenon. The participants of this study were secondary
school students who were intimately involved with ineffec-
tive teachers in class. The students have had firsthand experi-
ences with ineffective teachers, and they could vividly describe
the conduct of these teachers. They were therefore chosen for
participation in this study because they were in the best posi-
tion to describe the characteristics of these teachers. In short,
the design enabled the researchers to capture how secondary
school students perceive, describe, and judge ineffective
teaching in their classrooms.
Population and Setting
The research population comprised Form 3 secondary school
students drawn from four provinces (Nyanza, Western, Rift
Valley, and Nairobi) out of the eight provinces in Kenya.
Nyanza, Western, and Rift Valley are provinces in the west-
ern part of Kenya, whereas Nairobi, which is the capital city,
is a cosmopolitan province in the central part of the country.
The dominant ethnic group living in Nyanza is Luo, in Rift
Valley is Kalenjin, in Western province is Luhya, and the
most populous ethnic group in Nairobi is Kikuyu. Participants
from different ethnic backgrounds were considered suitable
in this study because research has shown that ethnicity influ-
ences people's perception (Merchant & Dupuy, 1996). The
researchers believed that ineffective teaching as a phenom-
enon could be perceived differently by participants from
different provinces in the country. Thus, conducting this
study in many provinces enabled the researchers to accu-
rately capture the perceptions of secondary school students
on the characteristics of ineffective teachers in Kenya.
Form 3 students were considered suitable for this study
because they had been in secondary school for 3 years and
had therefore interacted with ineffective teachers for a long
time. Their inclusion based on length of stay in school was
supported by Patton's (2002) report that a phenomenologi-
cal research is to address issues that pertain to experience
whereby responses are obtained from participants who have
lived through the particular experience for a long time. Form
3 students have longtime experience with ineffective teach-
ers and therefore were believed to have a better grasp of the
characteristics of these teachers. Thus, they were involved in
this study because of their expertise regarding their own
experiences on ineffective teaching. Forms 1 and 2 students
were not involved in this study because they had learned in
secondary schools for a short time and were considered
unsuitable to provide well-informed descriptions of the char-
acteristics of ineffective secondary school teachers. Form 4
students who had stayed longest in secondary schools were
also not involved in the study because they were busy pre-
paring for their final-national secondary school examination
(KCSE) at the time of data collection.
Sample
The participants of this study were 80 adolescents within the
15 to 17 age bracket. Although Polkinghorne (1989) recom-
mended that a phenomenological study should have between
5 and 25 participants, this study involved a large sample size
of 80 participants (20 from each of the four provinces)
because Kenya is a multiethnic society and ethnicity is known
to influence people's perception. The participants (40 males
and 40 females) were selected from eight provincial second-
ary schools (four boys' and four girls' schools) using crite-
rion sampling technique.According to Green and Christensen
(2006), criterion is the most appropriate sampling technique
to use in a phenomenological research because it ensures
that all participants are purposefully selected based on the
fact that they have experienced a similar phenomenon, in
this case, ineffective teaching in schools. Provincial sec-
ondary schools were involved in the study because they are
well-established government schools and all teachers in
these schools are trained and qualified. The researchers
wanted to find out the characteristics of trained ineffective
teachers in secondary schools in Kenya.
Instrumentation and Procedures
Two research instruments were used in data collection: a
biographical form and a blank sheet of paper. A biographi-
cal form developed by the researchers was used to collect
data on the participants' profiles. On this form, the partici-
pants were asked to indicate their unique characteristics
such as age, gender, class, ethnic background, geographi-
cal location (province), whether they volunteered to par-
ticipate in the study, and whether they knew an ineffective
teacher in their class/school whose characteristics they
were willing to describe. They were also asked to state on
this form that the teacher they described was trained and
qualified, and to indicate the duration they have known the
ineffective teacher.
The other instrument used in data collection was a blank
sheet of paper on which the participants were individually
instructed to identify the most ineffective (worst) teacher who
4 SAGE Open
was teaching their class and to describe the characteristics of
that teacher on the paper. The instructions were typed at the
top of the blank sheets of paper issued to the participants. The
participants were also instructed orally and on the informed
consent letter not to write the name of the teacher they were
describing, and not to write their own names and admission
numbers on the paper. This step was taken to ensure that the
participants were protected and that they remained anony-
mous throughout the duration of the study.
Permission to conduct this study was obtained from the
Ministry of Education and from the head teachers of the
schools involved. The research instruments were adminis-
tered to the participants by the researchers. The participants
were given 1 hr to complete the biographical form and to
describe the characteristics of their ineffective teachers on the
papers provided. They were instructed not to discuss their
experiences during this period because the researchers were
interested in tapping their own unique experiences. All par-
ticipants were proficient in English. At the end of the data
collection exercise, the papers were serially coded from 1 to
80 for ease of reference and for data analysis purposes.
Ethical Considerations
The researchers explained the objectives of the study to head
teachers, class teachers, and to the participants involved
in the study. The participants were requested to read and sign
the informed consent letter before participating in the study.
They were informed that there were no physical or psycho-
logical risks involved and that their participation in this study
was voluntary. The respondents had the freedom to decline
or withdraw from it at any time they deemed fit. They were
also assured of the anonymity and confidentiality of their
responses and that they were not required to write their
names on any of the research instruments used in the data
collection. Finally, they were instructed not to write, any-
where, the names of the ineffective teachers whose charac-
teristics they described.
Data Analysis and Interpretation
Content analysis method was used in analyzing the written
data on sheets of paper collected from the participants. Content
analysis is a careful, detailed, systematic examination and
interpretation particularly of written documents in an effort
to identify patterns, themes, and meanings (Berg, 2009).
According to Leedy and Ormrod (2005), content analysis
provides a method of obtaining good access to the words of
participants in text or written documents. This method was
appropriate for this study because it enabled the researchers
to analyze, synthesize, and interpret the words written by the
participants about the characteristics of trained ineffective
teachers in secondary schools. Under this method, the
researchers undertook gist and verbatim analyses. According
to Yin (2011), gist analysis should be undertaken in qualita-
tive research to capture the meaning of the statements made
by the participants about the phenomenon under investiga-
tion, whereas verbatim analysis is done to report the direct
quotations from the statements made by participants to cap-
ture their feelings about the phenomenon. Through gist
analysis, the researchers identified and named the character-
istics of ineffective teachers, and through verbatim analysis,
they reported the strong feelings the participants had about
ineffective teaching in schools.
The data analysis process started with participants' hand-
written responses on the blank sheets of paper that were coded
from 1 to 80, photocopied for each of the three researchers
involved in data analysis to receive a copy. Each paper was
independently analyzed by the researchers after thorough
discussion and agreement on the procedures and rules to fol-
low. It was agreed that the data analysis would begin with an
exploration of the descriptions made on papers by the par-
ticipants on the characteristics of ineffective teachers. This
exploration was an attempt to grasp participants'expressions
and meanings in the broadest context (Reisetter et al., 2004).
Each paper was then read a number of times to identify the
significant statements as verb-referent phrases on the charac-
teristics of ineffective teachers. The significant statements
made by the participants were annotated on the right-hand
margin of the paper (e.g., late to class, rigid in class, boring
in class, rude to students).
The researchers then identified and eliminated the over-
lapping or redundant significant statements as they read
the participants' descriptions. The nonredundant significant
statements were written on sheets of paper and were counted.
The order of the statements provided was based on the serial
coding of the papers on which the descriptions were made by
theparticipants.ThestatementsthatemergedfromParticipant
Serial Number 1 came first and those that emerged from
Participant Serial Number 80 came last on the list. In total,
102, 98, and 96 statements emerged from the data analyses
of the three researchers.
In the next stage of data analysis, the researchers indi-
vidually and critically examined the significant statements in
search of the connections among them. In this examination,
the meaning and not the frequency of the statements was
central to the researchers. The statements that were related or
had connections with others were grouped together into
"meaning units," which were extracted into meaningful ana-
lyzable units called emergent themes (Smith & Osborn,
2008). This was an analytical and theoretical process that led
to clustering of the statements. Some of the statements clus-
tered together and some did not. The statements that did not
connect with others were considered here as solitary themes.
The numbers of emergent themes that were generated from
the data analyses done independently by the three research-
ers were 22, 20, and 18.
Kodero et al. 5
In the final stage of the analysis, the researchers worked
together to negotiate and compare their emergent themes.
The process involved one of the researchers selecting an
emergent theme considered to be representative of ineffec-
tive teacher characteristic (e.g., wastage of students' time,
poor mastery of the subject taught, immoral in behavior) and
asking whether the other researchers had a similar emergent
theme. When all researchers agreed that the emergent theme
and the significant statements under it were correct, the theme
was noted down and the researchers moved to the next emer-
gent theme. This process continued until all researchers had
exhausted all of their emergent themes. Disagreement among
the researchers occurred on three themes. These themes were
as follows: (a) "nondialogical in class"--one researcher
recorded this theme as "nonparticipatory in class," (b) "injuri-
ous to students in class"--one researcher noted it as "punitive
to students in class," and (c) "poor psychological health"--
one researcher referred to this theme as "having mood dis-
order." These differences were resolved through discussion
and agreement on the title of the emergent theme. Overall, all
the three researchers agreed on 96% of the emergent themes,
an indicator that the interrater reliability was higher than .90.
Results
At the end of the discussion and negotiation among the three
researchers, 20 emergent and 4 solitary themes were agreed
on. This large number of emergent themes that resulted from
the data analyses reflects the richness of the descriptions the
participants had about the characteristics of ineffective teach-
ers in secondary schools in Kenya. The emergent themes
captured what the participants collectively perceived as the
characteristics of trained ineffective teachers. The 20 emergent
themes were named and accepted by the researchers as accu-
rate reflection of the characteristics of ineffective teachers in
Kenya. However, the 4 solitary themes retained their initial
names and were treated as isolated cases atypical of the char-
acteristics of ineffective teachers. They were discarded and
not included among the characteristics of ineffective teachers.
The 20 emergent themes, which were regarded in this study as
the characteristics of ineffective teachers, and the 4 solitary
themes, which were discarded, are presented in Table 1.
Under each emergent theme, the significant statements are
reported to clearly show how the 20 characteristics of ineffec-
tive teachers were arrived at by the researchers of this study.
The result of verbatim analysis is reported here in the
form of excerpts of the descriptions made by the participants
about their ineffective teachers. They are reported as direct
quotations, which capture vividly the strong feelings of the
students about their ineffective teachers. In other words, they
tap the "voices" of the participants involved in the study. The
excerpts are reported under the 20 characteristics of ineffec-
tive teachers identified in this study:

Wastage of Students'Time
Time wastage featured prominently as one of the character-
istics of ineffective teachers. For instance, Participant Serial
Number 1 wrote that
My worst teacher comes to class very late without any
particular reason. She lies to us whenever we ask her
why she came late to class.
Participant Serial Number 3 wrote that
My ineffective teacher is one who never keeps time--
comes to class late and is too lazy to teach for
40 minutes as provided for in the school timetable.
The teacher leaves class before the bell which marks
the end of the lesson is rang.
Poor Mastery of the Subject
A large number of participants felt that ineffective teachers
are poor in the subjects they teach. For example, Participant
Serial Number 11 wrote that
My worst teacher does not know the subject he is
teaching us and he is not ready to answer any ques-
tions from students. When a student asks him a ques-
tion he gets annoyed and refuses to answer the
question because he does not know the answer.
Participant Serial Number 76 wrote,
My ineffective teacher comes to class only to intro-
duce a new topic and teaches nothing about that topic.
He tells students to make notes on what they do not
Kodero et al. 7
understand. I always feel like walking out of class
when he comes to class because I don't gain anything
from him.
Source of Boredom to Students
The participants were unanimous that ineffective teachers
were boring in class. For instance, Participant Serial Number
15 wrote,
My biology teacher is so boring that I have developed
a bad attitude towards the subject. My request to God
is that she will change before I get to Form 4 so that
I will not fail in this subject in my KCSE exam. The
teacher cannot even make a silly joke to enable me be
attentive and alert. To me she looks as if she just died
and came back to life.
Participant Serial Number 36 wrote,
My worst teacher is boring and not lively in class. The
teacher will not care about how much you score in his
subject. When you fail he will tell you "you are not fit
for this subject and I think you are in the wrong place".
I always feel pissed off when he is in class.
Partial inTreating Students
The participants in this study identified discrimination
against students based on their ethnicity, ability, or gender as
one of the characteristics of ineffective teachers. For
instance, Participant Serial Number 19 wrote,
My worst teacher is the one who is tribalistic and
always praises students from his own tribe and con-
demns students from other tribes for no good reason at
all. He also favours brilliant students hence demoral-
izes the weak students.
Participant Serial Number 45 wrote,
My worst teacher is my biology teacher. She has taught
us since Form 1. She has a bad attitude towards those
who don't pass exams in biology and those who are
slow learners. I think she was never meant to be a
teacher because teachers are trained to understand their
students. She has a bad heart, she cannot spare her time
to assist us in difficulty.
Lack of Respect for Students
The participants perceived respect for students as an integral
part of teaching, and they believed that teachers who under-
rate their students were ineffective. For instance, Participant
Serial Number 71 wrote,
My bad teacher always abuses students in class. He
once told me to "scan my brain" because I did not
answer a question correctly. This actually makes a
student develop hatred towards the teacher until he
cannot understand what the teacher is teaching.
Participant Serial Number 64 wrote,
My worst teacher does not respect students and to him
students are nothing but fools who are struggling to
learn his subject.
Low Level of Self-Confidence
A number of participants perceived self-confidence as impor-
tant in teaching, and those who lacked it were seen as inef-
fective. For instance, Participant Serial Number 51 wrote that
My worst teacher has low self-confidence e.g. if you
laugh in class he thinks that you are laughing at him.
He does not like jokes and he is always stone faced.
Participant Serial Number 4 wrote that
My ineffective teacher is not confident in class. He
lacks a defined plan for the lesson and he is aloof and
does not mingle with students. His subject is the worst
performed in the entire school.
Poor Mastery ofTeaching Skills
Some participants view ineffective teachers as those who
lacked teaching skills. For example, Participant Serial Number
45 wrote,
My ineffective teacher has inadequate teaching skills,
as such might have graduated not long ago and is still
in the process of learning how to teach.
Participant Serial Number 58 wrote,
My worst teacher appears to know the subject, but
does not know how to teach it. He looks at the chalk-
board instead of looking at the students when he is
teaching.
Emotional Immaturity
Teachers perceived as emotionally immature were described as
ineffective. For instance, Participant Serial Number 24 wrote,
My worst teacher behaves like a child, she cries in
class when disturbed by students. In fact, some stu-
dents laugh at her when she is crying which makes her
to cry more.
8 SAGE Open
Participant Serial Number 58 wrote,
My worst teacher is short tempered and gets annoyed
due to small mistakes made by students in class. She
is actually temperamental and abusive in class.
Inappropriate Dressing in Class
The participants considered dressing as an important attri-
bute in their male and female teachers. For example,
Participant Serial Number 49 wrote,
My worst teacher comes to school dressed in a manner
likely to suggest otherwise. She leaves her cleavage
open which is provocative and she wears clothes that
"start too late and end too early".
Participant Serial Number 63 wrote,
My ineffective teacher is dressed as if his salary is
paid to somebody else. When he is in class you imag-
ine that you are being taught by an insane person
dressed in rugs or by an old dirty man in the village.
Injurious to Students in Class
The teachers who caused physical injury to students were
seen as ineffective in their duty. For example, Participant
Serial Number 51 wrote that
My worst teacher canes students in class for no good
reason at all. He does not take time to advice students.
This has created a tense atmosphere in class and stu-
dents find it hard to concentrate during his lessons.
Participant Serial Number 75 wrote in small and capital
letters that
My worst teacher punishes me by caning me whenever
I fail his exam. I hate the teacher because punishment
CANNOT MAKE ME PASS and I have a BAD
ATTITUDE TOWARDS HIM.
Fond of FrivolousTalk in Class
The participants of this study perceive teachers who engage
them in chit chat in class as ineffective. For instance,
Participant Serial Number 5 wrote,
My worst teacher wastes a lot of time talking about
irrelevant things in class e.g. her house, husband, chil-
dren and the number of cars she owns.
Participant Serial Number 41 wrote,
My worst teacher comes to class only to back bite
students and staff. Sometimes I just feel like telling
him to stop because it is a waste of our learning time.
Miscommunicate in Class
Teaching requires good communication, and teachers who
are poor in it were regarded as ineffective. For example,
Participant Serial Number 55 observed that
My bad teacher is keen on completing the syllabus and
not on teaching us to understand the subject. This atti-
tude makes the teacher to rush and hence we do not
understand what is being taught.
Participant Serial Number 44 wrote,
My worst teachers just enters the class, greets students
with a serious face and starts giving his lectures as if
the students are in a university.
Poor in Providing Feedback
Students wanted to know their performance in the subjects
they learned and so perceived a teacher who did not give
them feedback as ineffective. For example, Participant Serial
Number 61 wrote,
My worst teacher gives assignments but does not
mark them. He is also very poor in marking stu-
dents' exams. When a question requires three points,
if the first response is wrong, he marks all of them
wrong.
Participant Serial Number 52 wrote,
My ineffective teacher does not give exercises to stu-
dents in order to know whether or not the students are
following what she is teaching. I feel she hates to mark
students' work.
Nondialogical in Class
A number of participants perceived teachers who did not
encourage dialogue in class as ineffective. For example,
Participant Serial Number 36 wrote,
My worst teacher does not ask questions about what
she has taught. She also does not answer any question
posed by students in class. At the end of her lesson we
learn nothing because she lectures us as if we were
university students.
Participant Serial Number 47 wrote,
Kodero et al. 9
My English teacher is ineffective. She does not teach
and the only thing she does is to tell us to turn to a
certain page and answer the questions or to do the
exercise in that page.
Poor in Maintaining Discipline
Inability to maintain discipline in classroom was perceived
by the participants as a sign of ineffectiveness in teachers.
For example, Participant Serial Number 77 wrote,
My ineffective teacher is not in control of the class,
students have no respect for him and they can do any-
thing they want when he is class.
Participant Serial Number 64 wrote,
My worst teacher is quite traditional, he does not
understand the "Dot.com age". He denies the boys
opportunities to entertain themselves and to play foot-
ball which is important for their physical health and
development.
Immoral in Behavior
The participants involved in this study perceived teachers
who displayed immoral behavior as ineffective. For exam-
ple, Participant Serial Number 72 wrote,
My ineffective teacher brings boyfriends to students in
school, so that they talk to the girls and the teacher
himself grooves with the girls up to the extent of hav-
ing sex with them. And when you refuse to be his
friend, you will be abused for the rest of your life in
school.
Participant Serial Number 65 wrote,
My ineffective teacher is a perpetual drunkard and
there is no single time you would find him sober. After
drinking he spends most of his time chasing students
and giving them heavy punishment. He also fights stu-
dents like his own age mates.
Unapproachable to Students
Participants perceived teachers who were unapproachable as
ineffective. For example, Participant Serial Number 75
wrote,
My worst teacher is always in bad mood and not will-
ing to talk to students inside and outside class. This
makes students to fear answering his questions or ask-
ing him questions.
Participant Serial Number 49 wrote,
My worst teacher does not socialize with students and
therefore you can't consult him on any issue. I remem-
ber one day I went to consult him about what he had
taught and he furiously told me to walk out of his
office.
Poor in Guidance and Counseling
Counseling was perceived as being central to the teaching
profession, and the teachers who did not offer it to students
were considered ineffective. For instance, Participant Serial
Number 56 wrote,
My worst teacher keeps on talking to other teachers
and workers about my weaknesses instead of helping
me to overcome the weaknesses.
Participant Serial Number 71 wrote,
My worst teacher only thinks of academic work. He
does not take his time to address emerging issues such
as HIV/AIDS and drug abuse. This makes his lessons
boring and monotonous.
Poor Psychological Health
The participants were concerned about the psychological
health of their teachers, and they described ineffective teach-
ers as having mood disorders. For instance, Participant
Serial Number 80 wrote,
My worst class teacher is always moody and unpre-
dictable and one cannot know the right time to
approach her to solve a problem.
Participant Serial Number 54 wrote,
My worst teacher is a lady who is boastful and she
likes showing off to students and staff. I am telling
you she makes me sick and mad when I see her in
school.
Autocratic to Students in Class
The participants perceived teachers who are dictatorial and
domineering as ineffective in their work. Participant Serial
Number 70 wrote,
We have a certain teacher in this school who is dis-
liked by three quarters of the students. This teacher is
a dictator and uses modes of dictatorship which are not
used even by the government nowadays.
10 SAGE Open
Participant Serial Number 59 wrote,
My worst teacher is harsh and dictatorial in class. She
likes to punish students by ordering them to get out of
the class. I really hate this teacher and wished she was
never my teacher.
Discussion
The single objective of this study was to identify the charac-
teristics of ineffective trained teachers in secondary schools
in Kenya. This objective was achieved through gist analysis
in which 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers were iden-
tified and named. Moreover, this study captured through
verbatim analysis the strong feelings the participants had
about each characteristic of ineffective teachers. But, it is
important to note here that no single participant involved in
this study produced a rich description that contained all
these 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers. This was
interpreted by the researchers to mean that no single ineffec-
tive teacher possessed all these characteristics. Indeed, an
ineffective teacher must have some but not all of these char-
acteristics. The study did not investigate the average number
of these characteristics a teacher needs to have to be per-
ceived as ineffective; this could be an objective for another
study. Also, this study did not investigate whether the inef-
fective teachers described by the participants may have been
effective in the past and lost their motivation to teach, or
whether they may have always lacked the skills needed to be
effective.
This study has provided perhaps one of the most compre-
hensive descriptions of characteristics of ineffective teachers
in secondary schools. Other studies found in the literature
reviewed have reported fewer characteristics of ineffective
teachers. For instance, a study by Walls et al. (2002) gener-
ated only five characteristics of ineffective teachers, which
were as follows: partial in treating students, disorganized,
less resourceful, discourage students from asking questions,
and authoritarian in class. Four of these characteristics match
the ones we identified in our study. The only characteristic
that they reported and does not directly correspond to the
ones we identified is "disorganized." Perhaps it does not
match the characteristics we reported because it is not spe-
cific in meaning; for instance, a teacher who wastes time or
has poor psychological health may be described by students
as disorganized.
In another study, Horton (2009) identified 4 characteristics
that make a teacher ineffective, which are as follows: yelling
at students, giving empty threats, failing to give prompt feed-
back, and giving too much work to students. Again, all these
characteristics reported by Horton are captured in the find-
ings of our study except the last one. The participants involved
in our study did not report "giving too much work to stu-
dents" as a characteristic of ineffective teachers. It appeared
that they did not mind being given a lot of work, but they did
mind not being given feedback by teachers on the assign-
ments they have done. One of the most comprehensive listing
of the characteristics of ineffective teachers was made by
Magar (2009). According to Magar, ineffective teachers have
9 characteristics, which were as follows: no smart goals, no
self-control, motivated by their own desires, do not realize that
they are boring, lack self-discipline, bribe students, threaten
students, are empty shells, and do not know how to please stu-
dents.Acritical examination of this list reveals that only one of
the characteristics mentioned does not correspond at all to any
of the 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers we reported in
our study. The characteristic is "bribe students." Perhaps it did
not feature in our study because bribery is so common in the
Kenyan society that the participants failed to perceive it as
one of the characteristics of ineffective teachers.
The literature reviewed indicated that most studies have
been conducted on the qualities of effective teachers and that
very few studies have been done on the characteristics of
ineffective teachers. The assumption behind this disparity in
research is that some researchers believe that by knowing the
qualities of effective teachers the characteristics of ineffec-
tive teachers will be implicit (Marsh, 1991). According to
Marsh (1991) this assumption is not right because the char-
acteristics of ineffective teachers can only be best understood
by studying the teachers who possess them. In fact, the find-
ings of our study support Marsh's position. For example, a
study by Haydn (2007) investigated the views of secondary
school pupils on the qualities of effective teachers. He
reported the following eight qualities: talks to students nor-
mally, knows the subject well, explains things well, makes
the subject interesting, good at stopping other pupils from
spoiling the lesson, friendly, enthusiastic about their subject,
and has a sense of humor. Attempt to make these statements
negative and use them to describe ineffective teachers may
be problematic. For instance, converting "talks to students
normally" to "talks to students abnormally" does not make
semantic sense. Moreover, a participant in our study reported
that one characteristic of an ineffective teacher is "chewing
gum in class." If our study had investigated the qualities of
effective teachers to understand the characteristics of inef-
fective teachers, it is unlikely that this participant or another
participant would have reported that one quality of an effec-
tive teacher is "does not chew gum in class."
A scrutiny of the 20 characteristics of ineffective teach-
ers identified in our study shows that some of these charac-
teristics can be eliminated administratively in schools, for
instance, wastage of students' time, injurious to students, and
wearing inappropriate dress in class. The school administra-
tion can ensure that teachers do not report to class late, leave
class early, or miss class without permission. Wastage of time
is common in schools where there is laxity in administration
and there is no vigilance on the conduct of teachers. In Kenya,
corporal punishment is outlawed, and no class teacher is
allowed to cane or kick a student in school. It is the respon-
sibility of the school administration to ensure that any teacher
Kodero et al. 11
who causes physical injury to students is dealt with accord-
ing to the law. It is also the duty of the school administration
to ensure that teachers do not go to class poorly dressed.
A teacher who is not well dressed should be advised by the
school administration to mind his or her dressing.
Finally, the findings of our study challenge the assump-
tion that qualified teachers are quality teachers (Rice, 2010).
All teachers whose characteristics were described by partici-
pants involved in this study were trained and qualified, yet,
numerous characteristics of ineffective teaching were identi-
fied, and excerpts reported strong feelings the participants
had about ineffective teaching in schools. This assumption
should be put aside, and concerted effort should be made to
identify and help ineffective teachers improve their perfor-
mance. The authors of this article are not aware of any
effort made by stakeholders in education in Kenya to iden-
tify these teachers.
Conclusion
The findings of this study and other studies indicate that
there are very many characteristics of ineffective teaching
that remain in some individuals after they have been trained
and qualified as teachers. There is no doubt that training
improves effectiveness in teaching, but it does not necessar-
ily eliminate all characteristics of ineffective teachers in
secondary schools. There is therefore a need for trained sec-
ondary school teachers to undergo regular observations and
participate in regular in-service training. These should be
organized by the stakeholders in education as part of continu-
ing professional development aimed at enhancing teaching
effectiveness. The 20 characteristics of ineffective teachers
reported in this study may be used to develop an assessment
instrument that can help identify ineffective teachers in sec-
ondary schools. Finally, some of the characteristics of inef-
fective teachers identified in our study can be addressed and
eliminated by the school administration by being vigilant of
the conduct of teachers in secondary schools.
