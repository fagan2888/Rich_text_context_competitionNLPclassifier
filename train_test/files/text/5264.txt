Abstract
Objective: Low systolic blood pressure (SBP) is associated with an increased risk for cardio-
vascular morbidity/mortality in older patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). The present
study evaluated the association between range in blood pressure and first care-needs certification
in the Long-term Care Insurance (LTCI) system or death in community-dwelling older subjects
with or without CKD.
Methods: CKD was defined as an estimated glomerular filtration rate <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or
dipstick proteinuria of þ or greater. Our study was conducted in 1078 older subjects aged 65­94
years. Associations were estimated using the Cox proportional hazards model.
Results: During 5 years of follow-up, 135 first certifications and 53 deaths occurred. Among
patients with CKD, moderate SBP (130­159 mmHg) was associated with a significantly lower
adjusted risk of subsequent total certification (hazard ratio [HR] ¼ 0.44) and subsequent certi-
fication owing to dementia (HR ¼ 0.17) compared with SBP < 130 mmHg. These relationships
were not observed in non-CKD subjects.
Conclusion: Lower SBP of <130 mmHg may predict a higher risk for subsequent first care-
needs certification in LTCI, especially for dementia, in community-dwelling patients with CKD.

Introduction
Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an impor-
tant public health problem, especially in the
older population. This is because the preva-
lence of CKD increases with age according
to an age-dependent decline in estimated glo-
merular filtration rate (eGFR) in the general
population.1 The prevalence of CKD in the
adult Japanese population was estimated to
be 13% in 2009, and is expected to further
increase with aging of the Japanese popula-
tion.2 Blood pressure (BP) is often elevated
in people with CKD, and higher BP is asso-
ciated with an increased risk of cardiovascu-
lar events, especially in older patients
with CKD.3 The Japanese Society of
Hypertension Guidelines for the
Management of Hypertension (JSH 2014)4
recommend a target BP with antihyperten-
sive treatment for older hypertensive
patients aged !75 years of <150/90 mmHg.
These guidelines recommend attempting to
lower BP to <140/90 mmHg if possible,
and for hypertensive patients with CKD, a
target BP of <140/90 mmHg should be
attempted. These guidelines also recommend
attempting to lower BP to <130/80 mmHg
when accompanied by diabetes mellitus5,6 or
clinical proteinuria.7 However, recent obser-
vational cohort studies have suggested that
the risk of cardiovascular morbidity/mortal-
ity in patients with CKD may be increased in
those with systolic BP (SBP) in the lower
range. This relationship with increased car-
diovascular morbidity/mortality,8 all-cause
mortality,9­12 and stroke events13 in the
low range of SBP, including
<130 mmHg,9,10 has been shown in patients
with CKD. However, this pattern has not
been observed in the general population.
CKD in older people is closely related to a
decline in physical function14 and cognitive
function.15,16 Moreover, CKD was reported
to be an independent risk factor for care-
needs certification in the Long-term Care
Insurance (LTCI) system in older Japanese
adults.17 However, the association of a range
in BP with care-needs certification in LTCI
has not been examined in community-
dwelling older patients with CKD.
Therefore, this study aimed to determine
whether a lower range in BP of <130/
80 mmHg is a risk factor for care-needs cer-
tification in LTCI or death among
community-dwelling older subjects by com-
paring risk factors between those with CKD
and without CKD (non-CKD).
Materials and methods
Subjects
We analysed cohort data of a town with a
population of approximately 30,000. In
April 2008, the local government provided
public health centre-based annual health
check-ups to community-dwelling uncerti-
fied older people aged !65 years.
294 Journal of International Medical Research 46(1)
Among 4050 older people, complete infor-
mation from the health check-up was
obtained in 1091. Of these, 13 moved out
of the town during 5 years, and a total of
1078 subjects were included in our study.
Baseline examinations
CKD was defined as an eGFR < 60 ml/min/
1.73 m2,18 or with clinical proteinuria de-
fined as a dipstick result of þ or greater for
spot urine, corresponding to a urinary pro-
tein level > 30 mg/dl.19 Major risk factors
for CKD were defined based on current na-
tional guidelines. Hypertension was defined
as BP ! 140/90 mmHg or use of antihyper-
tensive agents. Diabetes mellitus was defined
as fasting blood glucose ! 126 mg/dl, non-
fasting glucose !200 mg/dl, HbA1c
!6.5%,
or use of hypoglycaemic agents or insulin.
Hyperuricaemia was defined as serum uric
acid levels !7.0 mg/dl in males and
!6.0 mg/dl in females. Dyslipidaemia was de-
fined as fasting serum total cholesterol levels
!220 mg/dl, triglyceride levels !150 mg/dl,
high-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels
<40 mg/dl, or use of lipid-lowering agents.
Hypoalbuminemia was defined as serum al-
bumin levels <4 g/dl as previously reported.20
Baseline BP was measured according to JSH
20144 by trained observers.
Outcome measures
Outcome measures were first care-needs
certification in LTCI by the Regional
Comprehensive Support Centre (RCSC) of
the local government, or death during
5 years. The services of the LTCI program
are provided to frail or disabled older
adults who are certified as requiring sup-
port or care, according to their care needs
and the nationally standardized certifica-
tion assessment system in Japan.17 We
also recorded the first disorder that required
certification in the primary care physician's
statement, and classified the causative
disorders into four categories of arthral-
gia/fractures, dementia, stroke, and other
diseases.
Statistical analysis
The study population was first divided into
CKD and non-CKD subjects. The popula-
tion was further classified into three groups
based on baseline SBP (<130, 130­159, and
!160 mmHg) and diastolic BP (DBP; <80,
80­89, and !90 mmHg). The associations
of CKD and range of BP with first care-
needs certification in LTCI or death were
analysed using Kaplan­Meier analysis and
the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox propor-
tional hazards regression analysis was used
to evaluate the association between the
range in BP and care-needs certification in
LTCI or death. Using Cox proportional re-
gression analysis, the adjusted hazard ratio
(HR) for each baseline BP (SBP: 130­
159 mmHg; DBP: 80­89 mmHg) in non-
CKD subjects and the 95% confidence
interval (CI) were estimated. Variables for
Cox regression hazard analysis were select-
ed according to the results of v2 analysis (or
Fisher's exact test when needed) for cate-
gorical variables and Mann­Whitney U
analysis with Bonferroni's correction for or-
dinal variables in baseline clinical charac-
teristics. A value of P < 0.20 was used as a
cutoff in this analysis. Analysis was per-
formed in all subjects, and then in sub-
groups of subjects stratified by age !75
years, male sex, receiving antihypertensive
treatment, diabetes mellitus, and clinical
proteinuria. We also examined models
using the four classes of causative diseases
for care-needs certification in LTCI as out-
comes. Data were analysed using SPSS
(version 22.0, Chicago, IL, USA).
Ethical considerations
This study was conducted in accordance
with the guidelines of the Declaration of
Himeno et al. 295
Helsinki, and was formally approved by the
Clinical Research Ethics Committee of
Kanazawa Medical University (receipt no.
48). We received baseline data and informa-
tion on new care-needs certification in
LTCI or death during the follow-up
period. These data were anonymised from
the RCSC of the local government.
Results
Study population
Among the 1078 community-dwelling older
subjects, 135 were first certified as needing
support/care. Fifteen subjects died after
care-needs certification in LTCI and 38
died without certification. A total of 53 sub-
jects died during the 5-year period. Subjects
with first care-needs certification in LTCI or
death showed a significantly higher mean
age and higher female ratio compared with
older residents with certification-free
survival (Table 1). Age, sex, living alone, hy-
pertension, diabetes mellitus, CKD, hyper-
uricaemia, hypoalbuminaemia, prior history
of stroke, and prior history of heart disease
were associated with the risk of first care-
needs certification in LTCI, in total or by
any cause, or death in univariate analyses
(Table 1). Accordingly, these variables
were included as confounders in the final
Cox hazards regression model. Among the
total subjects, 468 (43%) had CKD. Of
these, 380 were diagnosed with CKD be-
cause of their eGFR (range in eGFR: 22 to
<60 ml/min/1.73 m2), and 88 were diag-
nosed with CKD because of clinical protein-
uria, despite having an eGFR ! 60 mL/min/
1.73 m2. Patients with CKD were associated
with a more advanced age, a higher BMI, a
higher rate of diabetes mellitus, receiving an-
tihypertensive treatment, hyperuricaemia,
and a history of heart disease compared
with non-CKD subjects (Table 2). In the
CKD group, a lower range of SBP
(<130 mmHg) or DBP (<80 mmHg) was
related to a lower rate of receiving antihy-
pertensive treatment and a higher rate of
history of heart disease (Table 2).
Care-needs certification in LTCI and death
Kaplan­Meier analysis showed that the cu-
mulative incidence of care-needs certifica-
tion in LTCI in subjects with SBP
<130 mmHg tended to be lower compared
with those with SBP of 130­159 mmHg in
the non-CKD group (P ¼ 0.050, log-rank
test), but this incidence was higher in the
CKD group (P ¼ 0.047, log-rank test)
(Figure 1(a)). The adjusted HR for first
care-needs certification in LTCI for 5 years
was significantly higher in patients with CKD
and a baseline SBP of <130 mmHg compared
with patients with CKD and a baseline SBP of
130­159 mmHg (HR ¼ 2.24, 95% CI ¼ 1.48­
4.12, P < 0.001) with non-CKD subjects with
a baseline SBP of 130­159 mmHg
(HR¼ 1.58, 95% CI ¼ 1.01­2.52, P ¼ 0.049),
and with non-CKD subjects with a baseline
SBP of <130 mmHg (HR¼ 2.25, 95%
CI ¼ 1.22­4.13, P < 0.001). However, there
was no difference in HRs among each of the
baseline SBP classes in non-CKD subjects
(Figure 2(a)). The adjusted HR for death
was significantly higher in patients with
CKD and SBP of !160 mmHg compared
with either patients with CKD and a baseline
SBP of 130­159 mmHg (HR ¼ 4.50, 95%
CI ¼ 1.38­14.7, P ¼ 0.013) or non-CKD sub-
jects with a baseline SBP of 130­159 mmHg
(HR¼ 4.03, 95% CI ¼ 1.09­15.2, P ¼ 0.026)
(Figure 2(b)). There was no significant differ-
ence in HR among each of the baseline DBP
classes in CKD and non-CKD subjects
(Figure 1(c) and 1(d)).
Figure 3 shows HRs for first care-needs
certification in LTCI or death in each group
of lower and moderate SBP (<130 vs. 130­
159 mmHg) and DBP (<80 vs. 80­
89 mmHg) in CKD and non-CKD subjects.

0.72, P ¼ 0.001), although non-CKD sub-

(Figure 3). Among the 135 subjects with
care-needs certification in LTCI, 50 were
certified because of arthralgia/fractures, 32
for dementia, 15 for stroke, and 38 for other
diseases during the study period (Table 1).
Patients with CKD and a moderate baseline
SBP of 130­159 mmHg also had significant-
ly lower adjusted HRs for first care-
needs certification in LTCI because of
dementia (HR ¼ 0.17, 95% CI ¼ 0.05 ­0.55,
P ¼ 0.003) and for other diseases
(HR ¼ 0.33, 95% CI ¼ 0.13­0.82, P ¼ 0.017)
for 5 years, although non-CKD subjects with
moderate SBP did not (Figure 3). There were
no significant differences in the HRs for first
care-needs certification in LTCI between the
baseline DBP classes, or in the HRs for death
between each of the baseline SBP and DBP
classes, in the CKD and non-CKD groups
(Figure 3).
A J-shaped relationship with a beneficial
effect of SBP of 130­159 mmHg on total
care-needs certification in LTCI compared
with SBP of <130 mmHg was maintained in
the subgroup of patients with CKD aged
!75 years (HR ¼ 0.47, 95% CI ¼ 0.28­
0.81, P ¼ 0.007). This relationship tended
to be more evident in male patients with
CKD than in female patients with CKD
(HR ¼ 0.23, 95% CI ¼ 0.09­0.58,
P ¼ 0.002), with a P value for interaction
of 0.093 (Figure 4). A beneficial effect of
SBP of 130­159 mmHg on total care-needs
certification in LTCI compared with SBP of

treatment, in those without diabetes melli-
tus, and in those with and without clinical

Discussion
The present study showed that 43% of
community-dwelling older Japanese subjects
had either an eGFR <60 ml/min/1.73 m2 or
clinical proteinuria. This finding indicates
that CKD is common in this population.
Several previous studies have demonstrated
an association of lower SBP with increased
cardiovascular morbidity/mortality in
patients with CKD.8­13 The present study
adds evidence that comorbidity of CKD is
one of the main factors associated with an
increase in HR at a lower SBP of
<130 mmHg for subsequent care-needs cer-
tification in LTCI in Japanese older subjects.
Previous studies have shown that a lower
range in SBP is associated with an increased
risk of mortality, which varies with a more
advanced mean age in patients with CKD.
Indeed, the risk of cardiovascular mortality
was increased in patients with CKD and
SBP <110 mmHg in relatively younger
CKD populations in the Gonryo study,
with a mean age of 60.0 years.8 All-cause
mortality was increased in patients (mean
age, 68.1 years) with CKD and SBP
<133 mmHg in the Salem Veterans Affairs

68.4 years) with SBP <130 mmHg in the
Indianapolis Veterans Affairs Hospital
study,10 and in those (mean age, 73.8
years) with SBP <130 mmHg in US veter-
ans.11 Moreover, Weiss et al.12 showed a
J-shaped relation for a higher risk of mor-
tality with a stepwise increase in the lower
range of SBP according to more advanced
age in a cohort of older patients with CKD.
They found a higher risk of mortality with
SBP <131 mmHg in those aged 65­70
years, with <141 mmHg in those aged 71­
80 years, and with <151 mmHg in those
aged > 80 years. The mean age of patients
with CKD in the present study was 74.3
years. Therefore, the range in SBP of
<130 mmHg, which was associated with
an increased risk for first care-needs certifi-
cation in LTCI, appears to be partially
compatible with these previous studies.9­11
The Systolic Blood Pressure Intervention
Trial (SPRINT) was a randomized, con-
trolled trial in subjects aged !50 years
that excluded those with diabetes mellitus
or a history of stroke.21 This trial recently
demonstrated more beneficial effects of
lowering SBP to a target of <120 mmHg
(intensive treatment) on cardiovascular
morbidity/mortality compared with those
with a target of <140 mm Hg (standard
treatment). One of the reasons for the dis-
crepancy between the present study results
and SPRINT results could be a difference in
outcome measures. The support/care-need
certification is assessed based on a decline

in physical and mental functions of individ-
ual older people. Therefore, not only new
onset of causative disorders, but also occur-
rence of harmful adverse events by hyperten-
sion treatment would affect the outcome. In
fact, rates of serious adverse events, includ-
ing hypotension, syncope, electrolyte abnor-
malities, and acute kidney injury or failure,
were higher in the intensive-treatment group
than in the standard-treatment group in the
SPRINT.21 Findings in these previous stud-
ies and in our study suggest the importance
of avoiding BP that is too low because a
lower BP may relate to unexpected appear-
ance of a J-shaped relationship in high-risk
older populations, including older patients
with CKD.22
The present study showed that the disad-
vantageous effect of a low range in SBP of
<130 mmHg on subsequent care-needs cer-
tification in LTCI in patients with CKD
was maintained in those aged !75 years,
and it was more prominent in men
(Figure 4). Moreover, stratified analysis
showed that a low range in SBP was asso-
ciated with an increased risk of subsequent
certification because of dementia (Figure 3).
The mechanism(s) that might contribute to
the association of the low range of SBP and
increased risk of dementia in older patients
with CKD remains unclear. Okumiya
et al.23 reported a relationship with a signif-
icant decline in cognitive function during
3-year follow-up when SBP was
<125 mmHg in community-dwelling older
Japanese subjects. CKD is an independent
potential risk for small vessel disease.24
Therefore, a possible explanation for this

and moderate baseline systolic blood pressure (130­159 mmHg) with adjusted hazard ratio for first total
support/care-need certification, stratified by the presence or absence of chronic kidney disease in various
subgroups of confounding factors for cardiovascular diseases.

association may be that hypoperfusion
caused by low BP could increase the risk
of cerebral small vessel disease with conse-
quent worsening of cognitive impairment.25
Indeed, patients with vascular cognitive im-
pairment25 or vascular dementia26 are older
and more frequently male. Another expla-
nation for this association may be that
older patients with CKD and baseline SBP
<130 mmHg might be originally at high
risk of Alzheimer dementia. This is because
SBP has been reported to decline in the
years before the onset of Alzheimer demen-
tia, but not vascular dementia, in
community-dwelling older subjects.27
Recent evidence has also showed an associ-
ation of mild CKD with an increased risk of
Alzheimer dementia, as well as an associa-
tion of moderate to severe CKD with vas-
cular dementia.28 The precise mechanism(s)
responsible for onset of dementia in the low
range of SBP remains to be determined.
Previous studies have shown an advanta-
geous effect of a low range in SBP of
<130 mmHg in patients with hypertension
and diabetes mellitus for a reduction in risk
of stroke based on a meta-analysis of 31
intervention trials29 and for renoprotective
outcomes.5,6 However, the ONTARGET
study of 25,584 patients with antihyperten-
sive treatment showed a J-shaped relation-
ship for the risk of cardiovascular
morbidity and mortality, except for
stroke.30 This study showed nadirs in SBP
at the J-shaped relationship of 129 and
130 mmHg in non-diabetic and diabetic hy-
pertensive patients, respectively. Our find-
ings of a J-shaped association of SBP of
<130 mmHg for an increased risk for sub-
sequent care-needs certification in LTCI in
non-diabetic CKD subjects and in patients
CKD with and without antihypertensive
treatment (Figure 4) may be partly compat-
ible with the findings of the ONTARGET
study.30 Kovesdy et al.9 found a J-shaped
association between SBP and all-cause mor-
tality, and the outcome was associated with
older age and lower proteinuria after mul-
tivariate adjustments in veterans with
CKD. Agarwal10 also demonstrated that
the J-shaped association between SBP and
all-cause mortality was especially pro-
nounced in patients with CKD and an
older age or the absence of clinical protein-
uria. In the present study, a J-shaped asso-
ciation between the lowest range in SBP
and an increase in risk of subsequent certi-
fication was observed in patients with CKD
with and without clinical proteinuria
(Figure 4). The reason(s) for this difference
between studies should be evaluated in the
future. Nevertheless, our findings suggest
that introduction of antihypertensive
drugs and treatment goals should be indi-
vidually evaluated in older fragile patients
with CKD, especially in those aged !75
years.
This study has several limitations.
First, we conducted a single community
study. Second, we could not consider
CKD data in the majority of
community-dwelling older people who
did not undergo an annual health check-
up, and who might have a higher preva-
lence and different subclass patterns of
CKD and BP because of less concern
about their health. Third, our study had
relatively small numbers of patients with
CKD and non-CKD subjects, especially
those with a higher SBP of !160 mmHg.
Finally, the analyses performed in our
study do not imply causation between an-
tihypertensive drug overtreatment and an
increased risk of care-needs certification in
LTCI. This is because a J-shaped relation-
ship was observed in patients with CKD
with and without antihypertensive treat-
ment (Figure 4). The risk of an excess
reduction in BP on frailty or dementia
in older hypertensive patients with CKD
should be examined in future, randomized
studies.
In conclusion, in older patients with
CKD, the lower range in SBP of

<130 mmHg may be a useful prognostic
marker for subsequent care-needs certifica-
tion in LTCI, especially for dementia.
