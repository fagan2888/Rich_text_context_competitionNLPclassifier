Studies of erectile dysfunction draw their sample
populations in two fundamentally different ways.
Each method has de®nite strengths and weaknesses
that must be kept clearly in mind in assessing the
information in hand. The ®rst method, clinical
studies, recruits samples from the patients who
attend clinics because they have, or suspect they
have, a particular health problem. Constituting the
vast preponderance of available empirical studies
on erectile dysfunction, such studies can reveal a
great deal about the nature of erectile dysfunction in
particular patients, even with concomitant disease
processes like hypertension or diabetes, because of
the detailed opportunities to collect carefully mon-
itored physiological and biologically relevant tests,
physical examinations and case histories that permit
the exploration of complex etiologies and courses of
dysfunction (cf. references 1 and 2).1,2 One must
realize, however, that such samples are drawn from
the population at large in highly biased or selective
ways that are dif®cult or impossible to gauge or
evaluate and thus they can tell us little about the
prevalence of the problem in the population at large.
The second method, probability-based surveys,
recruits representative (cross-section) samples from
well-de®ned populations at large that are indepen-
dently de®ned from the health condition of inter-
est Ð that is, both healthy and af¯icted persons are
included in the sample in direct proportion to their
prevalence in that population universe. A central
problem in these types of studies is the validity and
reliability of identi®cation of those who have the
health condition and those who do not. The problem
arises because the rich array of diagnostic techni-
ques available in clinical studies are not practicable
in most population surveys and reliance must thus
be placed on self-reports with their well-known
biases of under-reporting due to concerns about
social stigmatization or due to lack of awareness
because the condition is asymptomatic or undiag-
nosed. Moreover, self-reports vary in their ability to
tap accurately the health condition of interest since
these indicators may also capture other conditions.
There are only three population-based surveys of
erectile dysfunction known in the literature, but
only two of these are based on modern probability-
based sampling strategies. Alfred Kinsey et al3 (cf.
reference 4)4 reported on erectile dysfunction based
on their large and broadly selected sample, but
Kinsey himself explicitly rejected the notion that
randomly drawn samples could be drawn to study
sensitive sexual phenomena and thus relied on
volunteer samples from an ill-de®ned region of
northern Indiana and the Chicago area, plus addi-
tions from other places. It is well known that
volunteer samples are biased in favor of those who
are especially interested in the phenomena under
investigation Ð in this case, sexual behavior, and are
therefore likely to overestimate the incidence and
prevalence of various behaviors and conditions
related to sexuality (cf. Laumann et al5: Chapters 2,
Appendices A and B). Estimates from Kinsey's work
can thus only be taken as suggestive and cannot
reliablybeusedin systematic,over-timecomparisons.
The other two surveys are recent and use modern
probability sampling techniques. The Massachus-
sets Male Aging Study (MMAS), consisting of 1709
free-living, non-institutionalized men between the
ages of 40 and 70 y living in the greater Boston area
in 1987 ± 1989 at baseline, gathered extensive phy-
siological measures, demographic information, and
self-reported erectile functional status (cf. references
6 to 8).a Because of the rigorous requirements for
collecting blood samples from the respondents early

in the morning, the length of time required, and the
usual dif®culties of recruiting male respondents, the
sample completion rate was only 53%, raising some
concerns about possible biases in participation. The
National Health and Social Life Survey (NHSLS) is a
national probability survey of 1410 men and 1749
women between the ages of 18 and 59 y living in
households throughout the United States in 1992
(cf. reference 5, pp. 368 ± 374.9 It accounts for about
97% of the population in this age range Ð roughly
150 million Americans. It excludes people living in
group quarters such as barracks, college dormitories,
and prisons, as well as those who do not know
English well enough to be interviewed. The sample
completion rate was greater than 79%. While the
central focus of the MMAS was on impotence among
aging males, the NHSLS was principally directed to
a broad-ranging inquiry into US sexual practices and
beliefs among younger adults. As a result, it
collected only limited information on sexual dys-
function, broadly de®ned, and physical health
conditions. The two surveys thus complement one
another rather nicely, with the MMAS providing
especially detailed opportunities to investigate the
relevance of changing hormonal levels across ages
on erectile functioning, among other things, but
with a more limited capacity to generalize to the
country as a whole. In contrast, the NHSLS has only
limited information on erectile dysfunction per se
but the capacity to place it in the much broader
perspective of US demographics and sexual dys-
function more broadly conceived (see, for example,
reference 10). As we shall see, where the ®ndings of
these two studies overlap, they are remarkably
consistent.b
Sexual dysfunction was indexed in the NHSLS
according to seven dichotomous response items,
each measuring the presence of a critical symptom
or problem during the past 12 months.c Response
items included: (1) lacking desire for sex; (2) arousal
dif®culties (i.e., erection problems in men, lubrica-
tion dif®culties in women); (3) inability achieving
climax or ejaculation; (4) anxiety about sexual
performance; (5) climaxing or ejaculating too
rapidly; (6) physical pain during intercourse; and
(7) not ®nding sex pleasurable.d (The NHSLS
measure of erectile dysfunction, because it asks the
respondent to identify a problem of at least several
months duration, seems roughly equivalent to the
MMAS's de®nition of moderate to complete impo-
tence. For the men aged 40 to 59 y in both samples,
roughly comparable rates of self-reported erectile
dysfunction are observed.) Table 1 provides the
prevalence of six male dysfunction items by demo-
graphic characteristics, including age, marital sta-
tus, education and race or ethnicity.e The adjusted
odds ratios in the table take into account all the
demographic predictors plus controls for religious
af®liation and residence in rural, suburban or urban
areas. Note that, except for marital status and age,
the other demographic characteristics are unrelated
to the prevalence of erectile dysfunction. For
comparative purposes, it is worth noting that there
are differential distributions of the other sexual
dysfunctions across demographic categories. It is
also worth noting that while erectile dysfunction is
clearly related to age, the crude prevalence of
erectile dysfunction among 18 to 29-year-olds stands
at 7%, and that is likely to be under-estimated
because of the strong social concerns about stigma-
tization among younger men.
Also, for comparative purposes, it is worth
knowing how the ®ve other dysfunctions co-exist
with erectile dysfunction.f The respondent was
permitted to check as many dysfunctions as applied
to him. One can thus compute the conditional
probability of having a particular dysfunction, given
that the man also has an erectile dysfunction.
Accounting for the prevalence of the other dysfunc-
tions in question, one can compute the odds of
having both sexual dysfunction A and erectile
dysfunction against the odds of having erectile
dysfunction alone.
Odds ratios of both sexual dysfunction A and
erectile dysfunction vs erectile dysfunction only:
Lacked interest in sex 4.58; Climax too early 4.06;
Anxious about performance 10.53; Unable to
achieve orgasm 14.24; Sex not pleasurable 7.69;
Experienced pain during sex 7.46.
Risk factors for erectile function
A latent class analysis (LCA) was used to evaluate
the syndromal clustering of individual sexual
dysfunctions or symptoms. Latent class analysis is
a statistical method well suited for grouping cate-
gorical data into latent classes11,12 and has a number
of medical applications, such as evaluation of
diagnostic systems13 ± 15 and generation of epidemio-
logical estimates using symptom data.16,17 Latent
class analysis tests whether a latent variable,
speci®ed as a set of mutually exclusive classes
accounts for the observed covariation among man-
ifest, categorical variables. By accounting for ob-
served covariation among dysfunction items, LCA,
in essence, attempts to improve on construct
validity which is more problematic when using
information from one survey indicator. These
categories, then, represent a typology of disorders
for sexual dysfunction found in the US population,
indicating both prevalence and types of symptoms.
(See the Appendix for detailed information on the
association of speci®c symptoms with the four
categories of sexual dysfunction.)
Only those respondents reporting at least one
partner in the prior 12-month period were included

in the LCA. This procedure may limit the results
because excluded respondents may have avoided
sex because of sexual problems. However, this
procedure was necessary to ensure that each
respondent answered all the symptom items since
three items were asked only of sexually active
respondents. A total of 139 men were excluded on
this basis. These excluded men were more likely to
be single and have lower levels of education. We
expect that this will bias our estimates of prevalence
of sexual dysfunction downward since sexually
inactive men generally reported higher rates of
symptoms. With respect to erection problems, 14%
of excluded men reported this problem in compar-
ison to a 10% prevalence among men included in
the analyses.
The results of LCA allow for analyzing risk factors
and quality-of-life concomitants in relation to
categories of sexual dysfunction, rather than indivi-
dual symptoms. These results indicate that the
clustering of symptoms according to syndrome can
be represented by four categories of men. Latent
class analysis also estimates the size of each class as
a proportion of the total sample, a result correspond-
ing to prevalence of categories of sexual dysfunction
in the US population. Finally, LCA identi®es each
class's symptoms, indicating the likelihood that
respondents in that class will exhibit a given
symptom, thus providing researchers with informa-
tion about what elements characterize each category.
Although not equivalent to clinical diagnosis, this
approach offers a statistical representation of sexual
dysfunction.
A large proportion of men (70% prevalence)
constitutes an unaffected population in the age
range of 18 to 59-year-old men. The remaining three
classes consist of premature ejaculation (21% pre-
valence), erectile dysfunction (5% prevalence), and
low sexual desire (5% prevalence). Overall, the LCA
procedure estimates 5% prevalence for erectile
dysfunction, a ®gure that is lower than the 10%
estimate using the single indicator. This difference
can be explained by the lower validity using only
the single indicator, which is likely to include other
causes of the indicator that are unrelated to erectile
dysfunction per se. Tables 2 and 3 present multi-
nomial logistic regressions on categories of sexual
dysfunction. Adjusted ORs indicate the relative risk
of experiencing a given category of sexual dysfunc-
tion vs reporting no problems for each risk factor,
while controlling for other characteristics.
Table 2 classi®es risk factors into three sets:
health and lifestyle, social status, and sexual
experience. With regard to health and lifestyle risk
factors, those who experience emotional or stress-
related problems are more likely to experience
sexual dysfunctions de®ned in each of the cate-
gories. Men with poor health have elevated risk for
all three categories of sexual dysfunction. The
presence of urinary tract symptoms appears to
impact premature ejaculation and erectile dysfunc-
tion. But having ever had a sexually transmitted
infection, indulging currently in moderate to high
alcohol consumption, and being circumcised, gen-
erally do not result in increased odds of experien-
cing sexual dysfunction.
Social status variables, which measure an indivi-
dual's socioeconomic and normative position rela-
tive to other persons, assess how sociocultural
position affect sexual function. Deterioration in
economic position, indexed by falling household
income, doubles the likelihood of erectile dysfunc-
tion but has no association with the other two
categories of male dysfunction. Men with liberal or
`hedonistic' attitudes about sex are approximately
1.75 times more likely to experience premature
ejaculation; this is the only attitude complex that is
signi®cantly associated with a sexual dysfunction.
Finally, various aspects of sexual experience
result in an increased risk of sexual dysfunction.
Sexual history, indicated by having more than ®ve
lifetime partners and by engaging currently in
masturbation practices, does not increase relative
risk for men. But men reporting any same-sex
activity are more than twice as likely to experience
premature ejaculation and low sexual desire. Male
victims of adult ± child contact or forced sexual
contact are three times as likely to experience
erectile dysfunction and approximately two times
as likely to experience premature ejaculation and
low sexual desire than those who have not been
victims of adult ± child contact. Finally, men who
have sexually assaulted women are 3.5 times as
likely to report erectile dysfunction. Indeed, trau-
matic sexual acts continue to exert profound effects
on sexual functioning, some effects lasting many
years beyond the occurrence of the original event
(cf. reference 18).
Quality of life concomitants
The experience of sexual dysfunction is highly
associated with a number of unsatisfying personal
experiences and relationships. Table 3 highlights
the associations of categories of sexual dysfunction
with emotional and physical satisfaction with
sexual partners and with feelings of general happi-
ness. However, no causal order should be assumed
since quality-of-life indicators are concomitant out-
comes of sexual dysfunction. Men with erectile
dysfunction and low sexual desire experience
diminished quality of life, but those with premature
ejaculation are not affected. Despite the obvious
adverse effects of sexual dysfunctions for quality of
life, only one in ten men reporting sexual dysfunc-
tion sought help from healthcare professionals.

Comment
Low sexual interest and erection problems are age-
dependent disorders, possibly resulting from phy-
siological changes associated with the aging process.
Indeed, the NHSLS results are consistent with those
generated by the MMAS, which determined that
9.6% of its sample experienced complete impotence
and showed a strong age association increasing from
5% to 15% between subject ages 40 ± 70 y.
The NHSLS data indicate that emotional and
stress-related problems generate elevated risk of
experiencing sexual dif®culties in all phases of the
sexual response cycle. While we caution that the
causal order of this relationship is uncertain, these
results suggest that psychosocial disturbances affect
sexual functioning. This does not imply that the
impact of poor health is negligible. In fact, the
opposite is demonstrated since age, health pro-
blems, and urinary tract infections result in elevated
risk of experiencing sexual dysfunction as well.
Rather, both physiological and psychosocial sta-
tuses are independent factors that affect sexual
functioning.
Appendix
Table A1 shows latent class and conditional
probabilities for the best-®tting four-class model
produced by the latent class analysis. Both the
prevalence of a category of sexual dysfunction and
the likelihood that a class member will exhibit a
given symptom are indicated. Note that erectile
dysfunction (ED) as a symptom is differentially
distributed across the latent class categories: about
1% of those classi®ed as having `no problem' report
ED, 24% of those with premature ejaculation, 97%
of those classi®ed as having ED (but notice the high
rates for other symptoms as well), and 0% for those
reporting low desire. Each category of dysfunction
has a notably different pro®le of symptoms.
The procedures used to generate our ®nal latent
class model consisted of three stages: (1) selection
and cross-classi®cation of manifest variables (i.e.,
the six sexual dysfunctional symptoms), (2) genera-
tion of the best-®tting models, and (3) assignment of
individual cases to latent classes. We used six
manifest, dichotomous variables, which generated
a corresponding cross-classi®cation table with
26  64 cells. The mean frequency of men per cell
is 19.7. We excluded one symptom, pain during
intercourse, in the analysis. This is justi®ed partly
on theoretical and partly on empirical grounds. This
symptom was the least prevalent in the general
population (only 3%) and, by including it, would
drop the mean frequency per cell to 9.8, causing
sparse data problems in the analysis.
Next, we generated a series of latent class models.
Typically, goodness-of-®t tests utilize df calcula-
tions that are reclaimed when conditional probabil-
ities are found to be zero or one.12,19 However, while
this is a convenient strategy, it is not, strictly
speaking, correct.20 Instead, we performed good-
ness-of-®t tests that did not reclaim df.21 As shown
in Table A2, the best-®tting model is a four-class
solution. Here, the ®ve-class solution did not have
any advantages over the four-class solution, and the
latter is the most parsimonious model. Finally, in
assigning individual cases to the latent classes, the
procedure correctly allocated 87.1% of the men.

Notes
a Another important feature of the MMAS is its
longitudinal character. The follow-up sample suc-
ceeded in re-interviewing 1290 persons some eight
years later, thus affording an opportunity to estimate
incidence as well as prevalence rates.
b For example, the MMAS's estimate rates of
complete impotence and the NHSLS's rates of
erectile dysfunction for several months or more by
5-year age categories are as follows:
MMAS (%) NHSLS (%)
40 ± 45 years old 5 9
46 ± 50 years old 8 11
51 ± 55 years old 9 22
56 ± 60 years old 10 14
c Appearing in Section 9 on Physical Health, the
question ran as follows: `During the last 12 months,
has there ever been a period of several months or
more when you F F F , had trouble achieving or
maintaining an erection? (MALE RESPONDENTS
ONLY).'
d Taken together, these items cover the major
problem areas addressed in the Diagnostic and
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth
Edition (1994) classi®cation of sexual dysfunctions,
which are characterized by disturbances in sexual
desire and in the psychophysiological changes
associated with the sexual response cycle in men
and women. Self-reports about sexual dysfunctions,
especially in face-to- face interviews, are subject to
underreporting biases arising from personal con-
cerns about social stigmatization. Moreover, there
may be systematic biases in underreporting related
to particular attributes of the respondents. For
example, older or less educated women or younger
Hispanic men might be more reluctant to report
sexual problems. Lack of privacy during interviews
could also result in underreporting. However,
analyses indicate that reporting biases due to lack
of privacy are negligible in NHSLS data (reference 5,
pp. 564 ± 570).
e Although Laumann et al9 discuss both male and
female sexual dysfunction and draw cross-gender
comparisons at least with respect to prevalence, we
shall discuss only male dysfunction here because of
the focus of this society's concerns on impotence.
Much less appears to be known clinically about
female dysfunction (in comparison to what is
known about male dysfunction). We believe the
opportunity to examine erectile dysfunction in the
broader context of the other male sexual dysfunc-
tions should prove instructive.
f The prevalence of `pain during intercourse' was
so low among men (3% of all men but 14.4% among
women) that it could not be reliably investigated
with a sample of this size and was thus dropped
from the analysis of male dysfunction in the latent
class analysis described below. For comparative
purposes, however, we have included pain during
intercourse in the list of odds ratios concerning
individual sexual dysfunctions.
