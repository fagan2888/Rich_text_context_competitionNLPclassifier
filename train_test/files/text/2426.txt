Abstract
Purpose The main aim of this article is to investigate to what extent the
relationships between risk factors and offending by males are similar from
one generation to the next.
Methods The Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development is a prospective longitu-
dinal survey of 411 London males who were originally studied at age 8. This article
compares these males (generation 2 or G2) with their biological parents (generation 1
or G1) and biological children (generation 3 or G3). Ninety-four per cent of G2 males
were interviewed at age 32, while 85 % of G3 males were interviewed at an average
age of 25.
Results Up to age 21, 34 % of G2 males were convicted, compared with 20 %
of G3 males. Eleven risk factors were significant predictors of both G2 and G3
offending: a convicted father and mother, harsh discipline, poor parental super-
vision, a disrupted family, low family income, large family size, poor housing,
low school attainment, daring/risk-taking and antisocial child behaviour. The findings
were markedly different for only three risk factors: parental conflict, low social class and
hyperactivity/attention problems. Over 20 risk factors, G2 effect sizes correlated .80
with G3 effect sizes.
Conclusions G2 results were similar to G3 results. While risk factors were not exactly
comparable between generations, most of the findings in one generation were replicated
in the next generation.

Introduction
A key issue in criminology is to what extent are risk factors for offending similar over
time and place? This question has rarely been investigated, despite the classic book on
Historical and Geographical Influences on Psychopathology [6]. It concerns the
strength of the relationship between risk factors and offending, not the prevalence,
level or magnitude of risk factors. For example, numerous childhood (age 8­10) risk
factors for offending (especially measured by convictions) have been identified in the
Cambridge Study in Delinquent Development (CSDD), which is a prospective longi-
tudinal study of 411 London boys born mostly in 1953 (see later). To what extent can
these results be generalized to other times and places? For example, broken homes have
increased in the UK since the 1960s, and family size has decreased. Nevertheless, are
the relationships between broken homes and offending, and between large family size
and offending, similar for the next generation, and specifically for the children of the
original 411 males?
The importance of historical context was emphasized by Elder [8]. He stated (p.2)
that "historical forces shape the social trajectories of family, education, and work, and
they in turn influence behavior and particular lines of development". He also empha-
sized the importance of life events and life transitions (e.g. early childbearing and
joining the military) on development. Cohen et al. [6], in their Preface (pp. ix-x), argued
that, if incidence rates are stable across time and place, this suggests that biological
factors are more important than environmental factors. If incidence rates vary over
time, researchers should focus on historical events as possible explanations. If inci-
dence rates vary across nations or cultural groups, researchers should focus on risk
factors that differ across these groups.
In order to investigate the replicability of risk factors for delinquency over time and
place, Farrington and Loeber [20] compared results in the CSDD for the 411 boys aged
8­10 in 1961­1963 with results in the Pittsburgh Youth Study (PYS) for 508 boys aged
10 in 1987­1988. Efforts had been made to measure risk factors in the later survey that
were comparable to those measured in the earlier survey. In both cases, the strength of
relationships between childhood risk factors (usually dichotomized, for comparability,
into the "worst" quarter vs the remainder), and court appearances for delinquency
between ages 10 and 16, were compared. They found that most childhood risk factors
were similarly related to delinquency in the 1960s in London and in the 1990s in
Pittsburgh.
This article compares risk factors for offending in two successive generations. To a
large extent, it focusses on changes over time and holds constant other (e.g. geograph-
ical) influences. In studying risk factors in successive generations, it is important to
have comparable measures. It is also important to measure risk factors prospectively, in
order to avoid retrospective bias. Most early studies of intergenerational transmission
(at least up to the special section of Developmental Psychology edited by Serbin and
Stack [37]) compared retrospective reports in one generation with prospective reports in
the next generation.
By the time of the next special section on intergenerational transmission, in the
Journal of Abnormal Child Psychology edited by Capaldi et al. [4], most of the articles
David et al.
were based on prospective reports in successive generations. The major studies by
Capaldi et al. [5] in Oregon and Thornberry et al. [39] in Rochester investigated the
intergenerational transmission of antisocial behaviour and the extent to which it was
mediated by parental and other (e.g. socio-economic) risk factors. Later special sections
(e.g. [2]) and special issues (e.g. [3]) also focussed on mediating factors that might
explain intergenerational transmission. For example, Bailey et al. [1] in Seattle and
Farrington et al. [16] in the CSDD investigated the extent to which family risk factors
mediated the intergenerational transmission of antisocial behaviour and offending.
We have not found any prospective longitudinal study that explicitly compared risk
factors with offending in successive generations. This requires a three-generation study,
since family risk factors in generation 1 need to be compared with children's offending
in generation 2, and family risk factors in generation 2 need to be compared with
children's offending in generation 3. The most relevant studies are probably those by
Menard and Johnson [34] and Johnson et al. [31]. Both analysed the National Youth
Survey-Family Study to investigate the extent to which particular theories of offending
were applicable in successive generations. Menard and Johnson [34] tested the appli-
cability of the integrated theory proposed by Elliott et al. [9]. They found that the most
important risk factor in both generations was delinquent peer bonding but that school
strain (low grades and low academic expectations) was more important for the second
generation. Johnson et al. [31] tested the importance of general strain theory in
two generations and concluded that strain variables (e.g. low expectations of
getting a good job and graduating from college) were directly related to delinquency in
both generations.
The present article examines the replicability of risk factors for offending in three
successive generations in the CSDD: the original 411 boys, their biological parents and
their biological children. The original boys are called generation 2 (G2), while their
biological parents are generation 1 (G1), and their biological children are generation 3
(G3). This article compares parental, family and socio-economic risk factors in G1 with
offending by G2, and parental, family and socio-economic risk factors in G2 with
offending by G3. It also compares childhood individual (attainment, impulsiveness and
behavioural) risk factors in G2 with later offending by G2, and similar individual risk
factors in G3 with offending by G3.
A great deal is known about the most important childhood risk factors for
offending by the G2 males (e.g. [17]). These include parental and family
factors such as a convicted parent, poor parental supervision and a disrupted
family; socio-economic factors such as low family income, poor housing, and
large family size; individual factors such as low intelligence, low school
attainment, high daring/risk-taking and hyperactivity/poor concentration; and
behavioural factors such as troublesomeness and dishonesty. The main aim in
this article is to measure, as far as possible, similar risk factors in the next
generation and to compare them with offending by the G3 males. In both
generations, the strength of relationships between dichotomized risk factors and dichot-
omized convictions is measured using the odds ratio (OR). As far as possible, risk
factors and offending are measured at the same ages. The independently important
predictors are assessed using forward stepwise logistic regression analyses.

Method
The CSDD
As mentioned, the CSDD is a prospective longitudinal survey of the development of
offending and antisocial behaviour in 411 London males from age 8 onwards. The
CSDD began in 1961, and for the first 20 years, it was directed by Donald West. David
Farrington started working on it in 1969 and began directing the CSDD in 1982. The
most recent data collections have been jointly directed by David Farrington and Jeremy
Coid. Results of the Study have been described in six books [22, 36, 40­43], and in five
summary articles [11, 12, 17, 25, 26]. These works should be consulted for more
information about the CSDD.
At the time they were first contacted in 1961­1962, the G2 boys were all
living in a working-class area of South London. The vast majority of the
sample was chosen by taking all the boys who were then aged 8­9 and on
the registers of six state primary schools within a 1-mi (1.6 km) radius of a
research office which had been established. In addition to 399 boys from these
six schools, 12 boys from a local school for educationally subnormal children
were included in the sample, in an attempt to make it more representative of
the population of boys living in the area. Therefore, the boys were not a
probability sample drawn from a population, but rather a complete population
of boys of that age in that area at that time.
Most of the G2 boys (357, or 87 %) were Caucasian in appearance and of British
origin, in the sense that they were being brought up by parents who had themselves
been brought up in England, Scotland, or Wales. Of the remaining 54 boys, 12
were Afro-Caribbean, having at least one parent of West Indian (usually) or
African origin. Of the remaining 42 boys of non-British origin, 14 had at least
one parent from the North or South of Ireland, 12 had parents from Cyprus,
and the other 16 boys were Caucasian and had at least one parent from another
Western industrialized country.
On the basis of their fathers' occupations when they were aged 8, 94 % of the G2
boys could be described as working class (categories III, IV or V on the Registrar
General's scale, describing skilled, semi-skilled or unskilled manual workers), in
comparison with the national figure of 78 % at that time. The majority of the boys
were living in conventional two-parent families with both a father and a mother figure;
at age 8, only 6 % of the boys had no operative father and only 1 % had no operative
mother. This was, therefore, overwhelmingly a traditional Caucasian, urban, working-
class sample of British origin.
Interviews
The G2 males have been interviewed nine times, at ages 8, 10, 14, 16, 18, 21, 25, 32
and 48. At all ages except 21 and 25, the aim was to interview all the G2 males who
were still alive, and it was always possible to interview a high proportion: 405 (99 %) at
age 14, 399 (97 %) at age 16, 389 (95 %) at age 18, 378 (94 %) at age 32 and 365
David et al.
(93 %) at age 48. The main focus in this article is on the information collected at age 32,
when most of the G3 children were under age 10.
Between 2004 and 2013, efforts were made to interview the biological children of
the G2 males. These interviews were carried out over a 9-year period because of
intermittent funding. There were 691 G3 children whose name and date of birth were
known. Only children aged at least 18 (born up to 1995) were targeted. The ethical
requirements of the South-East Region Medical Ethics Committee required that we
contact the G2 male and/or his female partner in trying to interview the G3 children and
that we only interview G3 children aged at least 18. Twenty children whose fathers
refused at age 48, and 7 children whose father was dead at age 48 (and where no female
partner was available) were not eligible to be interviewed. An additional six G3 males
who had died and three who were disabled (one Down's syndrome, one mental health
problems, one severe attention deficit-hyperactivity disorder), together with two who
did not know that the G2 male was their father, were considered to be not eligible. Of
the 653 eligible G3 children, 551 were interviewed (84.4 %) at an average age of 25,
including 291 of the 343 G3 males (84.8 %) and 260 of the 310 G3 females (83.9 %).
Of the remainder, 39 children refused, 33 parents refused, 13 children could not be
traced, 14 were elusive (agreeing or not refusing but never being available to inter-
view), and 3 were aggressive or problematic. Of the 29 children living abroad, 17 were
interviewed, usually by telephone.
Criminal Record Searches of the G2 Males
These searches have been described in previous publications (e.g. [14, 19]). The
minimum age of criminal responsibility in England and Wales is 10. Recent
searches of criminal records of the G2 males took place in July 2002 and
December 2004 in the Police National Computer (PNC), at which time most of
the males were aged 51. The Home Office report [15] and many previous
analyses were based on the criminal records up to age 50 derived from these
searches. A further search of the PNC was completed in March 2011, when
most males were aged 57. The criminal records of the G2 males are therefore now
known up to age 56 [22].
For comparability with the G3 children, it was recently decided to count officially
recorded cautions as well as convictions in the PNC, since cautions were routinely
recorded on a national basis from 1995 [24]. In total, 177 G2 males were convicted up
to age 56 (43.8 % of 404 at risk) for a total of 909 offences, including 51 cautions. In
this article, "convictions" include cautions. Convictions were only counted if they were
for "standard list" (more serious) offences, thereby excluding minor crimes such as
minor traffic infractions and simple drunkenness. The most common offences included
were thefts, burglaries and unauthorized takings of vehicles, although there were also
quite a few offences of violence, vandalism, fraud and drug use. The definition of what
is a "standard list" offence changed over time. In particular, common assault became a
standard list offence in July 1995, drunk driving was added to the standard list from
January 1996, and being drunk and disorderly was added in April 1997. All of these
types of offences were counted.

Criminal Record Searches of the G3 Children
As mentioned, there were 691 children whose name and date of birth were known.
Their median year of birth was 1981, and more than half were born between 1977 and
1985. They were first searched in the microfiche records in 1994, and they were then
searched in the PNC in 2003, 2006, and 2011­2012. The median age at which they
were last searched was 30, and more than half were last searched between ages 25 and
33. The 29 G3 children who were abroad could not be searched, but 658 of the
remaining 662 were searched. (In the other four cases, the identity of the convicted
person was not clear.) These included 344 G3 males and 314 G3 females. The focus in
this article is on the G3 males. Nearly all G3 males were searched up to age 21 at least,
and 70 (20.3 %) were convicted up to age 21. For comparison, 137 out of 404 G2 males
at risk (33.9 %) were convicted up to age 21 (excluding 7 males who emigrated before
age 21 and were not searched abroad). It is known that the probability of conviction has
decreased over time in England and Wales (see e.g. [18]).
Age 8­10 G1 Risk Factors for G2 Male Offending
For comparability, all risk factors were dichotomized, as far as possible, into the
"worst" quarter versus the remainder (see [21]).
Parental Convictions of the G1 father and G1 mother up to age 32 were obtained from
criminal record searches. (Age 32 was chosen for comparability in different genera-
tions.) Authoritarian attitudes to parenting by G1 fathers and G1 mothers were based on
the Parental Attitude Schedules created by Gibson [27]. Example items are "Strict
discipline develops a good strong character in children" and "Children who are made to
obey will thank their parents later". Young G1 mothers were those who had their first
child before age 21, and young G1 fathers were those who had their first child before
age 23. These ages were also chosen for comparability across generations. Nervousness
of the G1 father was based on social worker ratings and psychiatric treatment.
Nervousness of the G1 mother was based on both of these measures together with
the Mother's Health Questionnaire [28].
Family Uninvolved G1 fathers were identified by a questionnaire on the extent
to which the G1 father joined in the G2 boy's leisure activities (see [10, 38,
42], for more information about all G1 and G2 measures). The uninvolved G1
fathers rarely or never joined in the G2 boy's leisure activities. Harsh attitude
and discipline at age 8­10 was based on social worker assessments of both G1
parents, as was poor parental supervision, which referred to the extent to which
the G1 parents knew what the G2 boy was doing when he was out. Parental
conflict was also rated by the social workers based on their interviews with the
G1 parents, and it referred to chronic tension or disagreement in many fields, raging
conflicts or estrangement. A disrupted family referred to the temporary or permanent
separation from a G1 parent before the G2 boy's tenth birthday for reasons other than
death or hospitalization.
David et al.
Socio-economic Low G1 family income at age 8 was rated by the social workers. Large
family size referred to five or more children born to the G2 boy's mother up to his tenth
birthday. Poor housing was rated by the social workers and referred to living in
dilapidated slum premises. Low social class referred to G1 fathers who had an unskilled
manual job when the G2 boy was age 8­10.
Attainment Low nonverbal IQ (90 or less) of the G2 boy was measured by the
Progressive Matrices test, while low verbal IQ was based on verbal comprehension
and vocabulary tests, all completed at ages 8 and 10. Low junior school attainment of
the G2 boy was based on school records of arithmetic, English and verbal reasoning
tests completed by the G2 boys at age 10­11.
Impulsiveness High daring was rated by parents and peers and identified G2 boys who
took many risks in traffic, climbing, exploring, etc. High impulsivity was based on the
G2 boy's scores on three psychomotor tests, the Porteus Maze, the Spiral Maze, and the
Tapping test. High hyperactivity was based on ratings by teachers of whether the G2
boy lacked concentration or was restless in class (at ages 8 and 10).
Behaviour High troublesomeness was rated by peers and teachers and identified the G2
boys who got into trouble most. High dishonesty was rated by peers.
Risk Factors for G3 Male Offending
Parental Convictions of the G2 father and G2 mother up to age 32 were obtained from
criminal record searches. Authoritarian attitudes to parenting of G2 fathers and G2
mothers were obtained from the same Parental Attitude Schedules used with the G1
parents, completed by the G2 males and their G2 female partners when the G2 male
was age 32. As for G1, young fathers referred to G2 males who were under age 23 at
the time of the birth of their first child, and young mothers referred to G2 mothers who
were under age 21 at the birth of their first known child. (We only have records of
children that the G2 female had with the G2 male.) Anxiety/depression of the
G2 father was measured using the General Health Questionnaire [29], and depression of
the G2 mother was based on her reporting at least eight of the nine diagnostic criteria for
major depressive disorder from the DSM-IV. (This was only available when the G2 male
was age 48.)
Family Uninvolved G2 fathers were those who spent the least time in activities
with their children each week (according to their reports at age 32). Physical
punishment referred to the G2 father hitting or smacking his children when they
were very naughty. Physical punishment was reported by both the G2 male at
age 32 and by the G3 male (in retrospective questions about his childhood).
Poor parental supervision referred to the G2 father not knowing where his
children were when they were out, and this was also reported by the G3 male.
Parental conflict was based on the G2 father's report of frequent rows, and the
Intergenerational similarities
G2 father also answered about whether he had a child living elsewhere by age
32. The G3 male, in his interview, reported on whether he had lived with his
G2 father for the whole time period up to his 16th birthday or whether he had
been separated.
Socio-economic Low take-home pay was reported by the G2 male at age 32.
Large family size referred to five or more people living in the G2 male's
household when he was age 32. Poor housing of the G2 male at age 32 was
rated by the interviewer, based on whether the home was dirty, smelly, damp,
neglected, overcrowded and inadequately furnished, had vermin, or had struc-
tural problems. Low social class at age 32 indicated that the G2 male had a
semi-skilled or unskilled manual job.
Attainment Early school leaving was based on the report of the G3 male that he had left
school before age 16. He also reported on whether he had passed any advanced level
examinations.
Impulsiveness The G3 male reported on whether he often or very often took many risks
under age 12, and on whether he always had difficulty paying attention at school.
Behaviour The G3 male also reported on whether he had ever been suspended from
school and on whether he had been a frequent truant (1 day per week or more).
Results
Age 8­10 Risk Factors for G2 Male Offending
Table 1 shows the strength of relationships between the age 8 and 10 risk factors and
convictions of the G2 males up to age 21. Three of the eight parental risk factors were
significant predictors, and having a convicted G1 father was a somewhat stronger
predictor than having a convicted G1 mother. Four of the five family risk factors were
significant predictors: all except low G1 paternal involvement with the G2 boy. Three
of the four socio-economic risk factors were significant predictors: all except low social
class. All of the individual risk factors (measuring attainment, impulsiveness and
behaviour) were significant predictors.
Logistic regression analyses were then carried out to investigate independent pre-
dictors. They were first of all carried out within categories of risk factors (e.g. parental
or family), and the independently important variables were then included in a final
logistic regression analysis. Only explanatory risk factors were studied; behavioural
variables were excluded. Forward stepwise analyses were performed in order to
minimize problems of multicollinearity. Table 2 shows that five risk factors were
independently predictive: one parental (convicted G1 father), one family (disrupted
family), one socio-economic (large family size), one attainment (low junior school
David et al.
attainment) and one impulsiveness (high daring). (Large family size is included here
although it was not quite significant on a two-tailed test. One-tailed tests are quite
justifiable here in light of the directional predictions.) Numerous prior analyses of the
CSDD have found that about five risk factors at age 8­10, typically drawn from
different categories, are independent predictors of later G2 offending (e.g. [17]).

Risk Factors for G3 Male Offending
Table 3 shows the strength of relationships between risk factors and convictions of the
G3 males up to age 21.1 Of the parental risk factors, a convicted G2 father and a
convicted G2 mother were significant predictors. As with the G1 parents, G2 parental
authoritarianism and young parents were not predictive of G3 offending. Four of the
family risk factors were significantly related: poor supervision according to both the G2
male at age 32 and the G3 male, physical punishment reported by the G3 male and
separation from a G2 parent before age 16 according to the G3 male.
All of the socio-economic risk factors at age 32, including low social class of the G2
father, were significantly predictive of G3 offending. Both of the G3 attainment risk
factors, together with early risk taking, suspension and frequent truancy, were related to
G3 offending. Poor attention at school was not related to G3 offending.
Table 4 shows the results of a logistic regression analysis predicting G3 male
offending. As before, the behavioural variables were excluded. The strongest indepen-
dent predictors were a convicted G2 father (a parental risk factor), risk-taking under age
12 (measuring impulsiveness), low G2 take-home pay (a socio-economic factor) and
1 1. Because all the children are not all independent, it is necessary to adjust the variance of the odds ratio to
take account of the clustering of children in families. It is easiest to do this by referring to the standardized
mean difference d. Clustering has no material effect on the value of d but it increases the variance of d (see,
e.g. [30]). The variance is increased by [1+(n - 1)*ICC], where n is the number of individuals in a cluster and
ICC is the intraclass correlation. This correction has been known for many years and has been called the
design effect (e.g. [32]) or the variance inflation factor (e.g. [7]).
It is well known (see e.g. [33], p. 202) that
Ln OR
ð Þ ¼  * d = sqrt 3
ð Þ
or Ln OR
ð Þ ¼ 1:81 * d
Therefore; SE Ln OR
ð Þ
½  ¼ 1:81* SE d
ð Þ
Since SE [Ln (OR)] increases in direct proportion to SE(d), it follows that the variance of Ln(OR), like
the variance of d, needs to be increased by [1+(n-1)*ICC] to take account of clustering. For the dichotomized
measure of conviction, the ICC was .37, indicating a considerable degree of clustering of convictions in
families. Since there were 344 boys in 220 families, the average number of boys in a family was 1.56.
Therefore, the variance of Ln(OR) was increased by [1 + 0.56*0.37], or by 21 %, to take account of the
clustering of convictions. This is equivalent to increasing the standard error of Ln(OR) by 10 %.

three family factors (physical punishment, poor supervision and separation). All six risk
factors were originally significant in the analysis, but only two were significant on a
two-tailed test after the variance inflation factor described in Note 1 was applied.
In order to obtain a quantitative measure of the similarity of risk factors in the two
generations, effect sizes for G2 offending were correlated with effect sizes for G3 offending

Intergenerational similarities
over 20 similar risk factors. Because the ORs are ratio variables, the effect sizes were Ln
(OR), which is an interval scale variable. Where there were both G2 and G3 effect sizes (for
physical punishment, poor supervision and separation), these were averaged. Remarkably,
the correlation between effect sizes was r=.80 (p<.0001), and the mean effect sizes for G2
and G3 offending were similar (OR=2.09 for G2 and OR=1.93 for G3). The G2 and G3
effect sizes were significantly different only for parental conflict (z=2.56, p=.010).
Discussion
Of the parental risk factors, convicted fathers and convicted mothers were important for
both G2 and G3 offending. Authoritarian parental attitudes were not important. This
may be because the parental attitude questionnaire became increasingly out of date, and
authoritarian parental attitudes decreased considerably over time [38]. A young mother
or father was not a significant predictor of offending, contrary to previous findings [35].
Nervousness or depression of parents was not very important for offending, although it
was previously found to be an important predictor of psychopathy [13].
Of the family risk factors, poor supervision and disrupted families were important
for both G2 and G3 offending. Low paternal involvement with the child was not
important for either G2 or G3 offending. Harsh discipline was important for G2 and
physical punishment was important for G3 (according to G3 males). The G2 risk factor
included a cold attitude as well as harsh discipline. Parental conflict was important for
G2 but not for G3. This may be because the earlier risk factor reflected more extreme
conflicts, in an era when divorce was rare. The later risk factor reflected rows between
parents, but G2 parents with the most extreme conflicts may already have been
divorced. In general, the family risk factors for G3 offending were problematic because
the information came from the father rather than from the mother, because the father at
age 32 was answering for his children in general rather than for the specific G3 male,
and because the G2 father may sometimes have been separated from the G3 male.
Of the socio-economic factors, low family income, large family size and poor
housing were important for both G2 and G3 offending. However, the two variables
measuring family size were not very comparable, as family size in the earlier time
period referred to the number of children born to the G1 mother, whereas family size in

the later time period referred to the number of people in the G2 male's household. Low
social class was important for G3 offending but not for G2 offending. This may have
been because, for the G1 males, some unskilled manual jobs had relatively high wages,
whereas this was less true for the G2 males. Indeed, the OR between low income and
low social class was significantly greater (5.66) in the later time period than in the
earlier time period (2.95; z=2.15, p=.032).
Of the individual risk factors, measures of attainment and impulsiveness were
important for both G2 and G3 offending. Unlike the earlier prospective measures, the
G3 measures were obtained retrospectively from the G3 males. Therefore, the analysis
of risk factors for G3 males is not always strictly predictive.
The logistic regression analyses (as with previous comparable analyses) indicated
that one risk factor from each of five categories independently predicted G2 offending.
One risk factor from four categories independently predicted G3 offending, but family
factors were relatively more important. All these results should be the starting point for
formulating and testing developmental theories of offending (see [23]).
Summarizing the main results, risk factors for G2 offending were highly correlated
(r=.80) with risk factors for G3 offending. Eleven risk factors were significant predic-
tors of both G2 and G3 offending: a convicted father, a convicted mother, harsh
discipline, poor parental supervision, a disrupted family, low family income, large
family size, poor housing, low attainment, daring/risk-taking and antisocial child
behaviour. A nervous/depressed mother was marginally significant for G2 offending
but not significant for G3 offending. Several risk factors were not significant predictors
of either G2 or G3 offending: authoritarian parents, young parents, a nervous/depressed
father, and an uninvolved father. The findings were markedly different for only three
risk factors: parental conflict (the only significant difference between G2 and G3), low
social class and hyperactivity/attention problems.
While we did our best to measure comparable risk factors in the different genera-
tions, it has to be admitted that some risk factors were not very comparable. For
example, hyperactivity in G2 was not the same as attention problems in G3. More
efforts are needed to investigate the replicability of risk factors (and protective factors)
over time and place. To the extent that risk factors are replicable in successive
generations, this helps to answer objections that results obtained in one time period
are not relevant to a later time period. Where results vary in different time periods, it is
important to investigate cohort or time period effects that might explain the differences.
In our comparisons, we conclude that most of the findings in one generation were
remarkably replicable in the next generation.
