Abstract
Objective: To investigate the levels of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and matrix
metalloproteinase-9 (MMP-9) proteins in patients with glioma, in order to determine if either
protein has prognostic value.
Method: The presence of VEGF and MMP-9 proteins in paraffin-embedded tumour specimens
from patients with glioma was detected using immunohistochemistry. The correlation between the
levels of VEGF and MMP-9 proteins and tumour grade was analysed.
Results: A total of 32 patients with low-grade gliomas (World Health Organization [WHO] grade
II) and 48 patients with high-grade gliomas (WHO grades III­IV) participated in the study. Positive
immunohistochemical staining of VEGF and MMP-9 proteins was detected in 58/80 (72.5%) and
60/80 (75.0%) of patients, respectively. The level of VEGF immunostaining was significantly
positively correlated with the level of MMP-9 immunostaining (r ¼ 0.78). Significantly more high-
grade gliomas (grades III­IV) demonstrated positive VEGF and MMP-9 immunostaining compared
with the low grade gliomas (grades I­II).
Conclusions: These data suggest that VEGF and MMP-9 play an important role in the malignant
behaviour of gliomas.

Introduction
Gliomas are highly malignant and invasive
tumors with tendrils that extend far from the
primary tumor site.1 Gliomas are further
divided into low-grade gliomas (World
Health Organization [WHO] grade II) and
high-grade gliomas (WHO grade III­IV) by
pathologic evaluation of the tumour.2 Low-
grade gliomas are well differentiated,
whereas high-grade gliomas are undifferen-
tiated or anaplastic. The latter are malignant
and carry a worse prognosis.3
Although a small portion of low grade
gliomas display benign features, most of
these tumours are malignant and usually
indicate a poor prognosis.4 Despite modern
diagnostic methods and treatment strate-
gies, the median survival time does not
exceed 15 months.5 This is mainly due to
the fact that at the time of surgery, cells from
the primary tumour have already invaded
normal brain tissue.6 Therefore, it is extre-
mely important to search for sensitive and
specific markers that can provide valuable
information for the early diagnosis and
identification of poorly responsive tumours
that may benefit from a modified treatment
regimen.
Tumour metastasis is a multistep process
involving a variety of tumour­host cell inter-
actions. Angiogenesis, one such interaction,
is the outgrowth of endothelial cells from
pre-existing capillary vessels and their migra-
tion from parental vessels under the stimu-
lation of vascular endothelial growth factor
(VEGF),7 which is a homodimeric protein
identified as a mitogen for endothelial cells
in vitro and an angiogenesis promoting fac-
tor in vivo.8 Glioma cells produce large
amounts of VEGF and high grade gliomas
(glioblastoma multiform) produce more
VEGF than lower grade astrocytomas.7,8
Clinical studies have demonstrated that
circulating VEGF has a negative prognostic
value in cancer patients, correlating with
tumour grade and vascularity in gliomas.9,10
Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) are
zinc-binding endopeptidases capable of
degrading extracellular matrix (ECM) com-
ponents such as collagen, fibrinogen and
proteoglycans.11 One member of this family,
MMP-9, has been assigned an important
role in tissue-specific remodelling in normal
and pathological processes, most notably
during angiogenesis and tumour invasion.12
Elevated levels of MMP-9 have been found
in patients suffering from various types of
tumours in vivo and a correlation has
been established between the secretion of
MMP-9 and experimental metastasis.13­16
Furthermore, overexpression of MMP-9 in
transfected nonmetastatic tumour cells ren-
ders them invasive.13,14, Proliferating endo-
thelial cells subsequently remodel the ECM
via MMPs, align into tube-like structures,
and eventually form new functional blood
vessels.11 In malignant cells, upregulation of
angiogenic factors, such as VEGF and
MMPs, is closely linked to invasion and
metastasis.17 There have been few reports on
the role of VEGF and MMPs in gliomas.18
The present study, therefore, investigated
the levels of VEGF and MMP-9 protein
using immunohistochemical staining in
order to determine if either protein has any
prognostic value in patients with gliomas
Patients and methods
Patients
Consecutive patients with gliomas who had
been diagnosed, treated and followed-up in
the Department of Neurosurgery, First
Hospital of Jilin University, Changchun,
Jilin Province, China between May 2009
and July 2011, and for whom archival
primary tumour material collected at diag-
nosis, prior to radiotherapy, was available,
were enrolled in the study. For all patients,
the original diagnosis and tumour grading
was peer-reviewed by two experienced
pathologists according to the principles
laid down in the latest World Health
Ma et al. 199
Organization (WHO) classification system.2
The tumours were classified as low grade
gliomas (WHO grades II) or high-grade
gliomas (grades III­IV).
Computed tomography and magnetic
resonance imaging data were available in
all patients. In each patient, the presence
and extent of necrosis (focal/extensive) was
also assessed and compared with those in
noncancerous adjacent tissues specimens
(>3 cm away from the tumor site). There
were no other inclusion/exclusion criteria
for this study. All patients gave written
informed consent to participate in the
study. This study was approved by the
Ethics Committee of Jilin University,
Changchun, Jilin Province, China.
Immunohistochemical staining
Primary tumour specimens were fixed in
10% buffered formalin, dehydrated in etha-
nol, embedded in paraffin wax and cut into
4-mm sections for use in immunohistochem-
istry. Serial sections were cut from each
specimen and mounted on Superfrost slides
(Menzel Gla
¨ ser, Braunschweig, Germany),
dewaxed with xylene, gradually rehydrated
and left to dry overnight at 37C. After
deparaffinization, immunostaining was
performed using the two-step peroxidase
technique with a peroxidase-conjugated
polymer. Antigen retrieval was achieved by
pressure cooking in 0.01 M citrate buffer
(pH 6.0) for 5 min. After blocking with 3%
bovine serum albumin (Sigma-Aldrich, St
Louis, MO, USA) in 0.01 mM phosphate-
buffered saline (PBS; pH 7.2) at 37C for 1 h,
the sections were incubated with mouse
monoclonal antibodies against human
VEGF or MMP-9 (both from Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) at a
dilution of 1:500 overnight at 4C. The slides
were then washed three times in 0.01 mM
PBS (pH 7.2) for 5 min at room temperature.
The sections were then incubated with
biotin-labelled rabbit antimouse antibody
(1:500 dilution; ZSJB-BIO, Beijing, China)
for 2 h at 37C. After washing with 0.01 mM
PBS (pH 7.2) three times, immunostaining
was visualized using a commercial strepta-
vidin­peroxidase reaction system, and then
developed with 3% diaminobenzidine­H2
O2
(all reagents from Wuhan Boster Biological
Technology, Wuhan, Hubei, China).
The intensity of the immunostaining was
graded using a four-point scoring system as
follows: 0 if no immunoreactive cells were
observed (negative); 1þ if the proportion of
immunoreactive cells was <25% (weak); 2þ
if the proportion of immunoreactive cells
was 25­75% (moderate); and 3þ if the
proportion of immunoreactive cells was
>75% (strong). In cases with variable stain-
ing intensities, the most common pattern
was recorded. Tissue samples with 0 or 1þ
staining were classified as negative, and
tissue samples with 2þ or 3þ staining were
classified as positive. Five fields were ran-
domly selected from each slide and exam-
ined at a magnification of Â200 using a
Leica DM2700 M light microscope (Leica,
Solms, Germany), and were scored inde-
pendently by two observers who were
blinded to the clinicopathological data and
clinical outcomes of the patients. Five cases
with discordant results were re-evaluated by
the two observers to obtain agreement.
Negative control sections were incubated
with normal mouse serum instead of
primary antibody.
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed using
the SPSSÕ statistical package, version 16.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for Windows
and the SAS statistical package, version 9.1
(SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). The asso-
ciation between the level of VEGF and
MMP-9 protein immunostaining and
tumour grade was analysed using 2-test.
The correlation between the level of VEGF
and MMP-9 protein immunostaining was

analysed using Spearman's rank correlation
coefficient analysis. A P-value <0.05 was
considered statistically significant.
Results
A total of 80 patients with glioma (male:fe-
male ratio 53:27) with a median age of
59 (range 19­82) years were included in
this present study. Thirty-two patients with
low-grade gliomas (grades II) and 48
patients with high-grade gliomas (grades
III­IV) were included in this study.
Positive immunohistochemical staining
(i.e. 2þ or 3þ staining intensity) for VEGF
and MMP-9 proteins was detected in 58/80
(72.5%) and 60/80 (75.0%) of patients,
respectively. Based on immunohistochemical
staining (Figure 1), VEGF protein was
primarily located within the cytoplasm and
MMP-9 protein was primarily located
within the cytoplasm and the plasma mem-
brane of the tumour cells. In contrast,
noncancerous adjacent tissues showed no
VEGF and MMP-9 immunostaining (image
not shown).
The correlation between the level of
VEGF and MMP-9 immunostaining in all
patients was assessed using Spearman's
rank correlation coefficient analysis. The
level of VEGF immunostaining was signifi-
cantly positively correlated with the level
of MMP-9 immunostaining (r ¼ 0.78,
P < 0.01) (Table 1).

Discussion
Malignant glioma is characterized by rapid
expansion, invasion of adjacent central
nervous system tissues and aberrant vascu-
larization.19,20 A growing understanding of
the underlying molecular biology of glioma
has identified several molecules pertinent to
the pathophysiology. For example, VEGF
is a secreted mitogen and the dominant
factor that regulates angiogenesis in both
normal development and tumour growth.21
During the process of haematogenous
metastasis, VEGF is suggested to play a
key role by participating in the regulation
of angiogenesis.22 VEGF exerts its growth-
promoting influence not on the tumour
cells themselves but on the vascular endo-
thelial cells, promoting both proliferation
and new vessel formation.23 Chaudhry
et al.24 demonstrated that the expression
of VEGF in primary gliomas correlated
with an increase in local microvessel dens-
ity in the tumour tissue, development of
pulmonary metastasis and poor prognosis
for patients with glioma. These findings
suggest that VEGF secreted by glioma cells
stimulates angiogenesis, which critically
contributes to the development of the
pulmonary metastasis of glioma.25
Moreover, previous research demonstrated
that glioma cells produce large amounts of
VEGF and high-grade gliomas (glioblast-
oma multiform) express more VEGF than
lower grade astrocytomas.23,24 The results
of this present study were in agreement
with the earlier findings because a signifi-
cantly higher proportion of high-grade
gliomas (grades III­IV) demonstrated posi-
tive VEGF immunostaining compared with
the low grade gliomas (grade II)
(P < 0.01).23,24
Tumour invasion is a cascade of sequen-
tial events that involves detachment of

malignant cells from their site of origin and
invasion through the surrounding stroma
into the lymphovascular channels.25 All of
these steps are associated with ECM deg-
radation and the proteolytic breakdown of
major ECM components requires specific
proteases. MMPs are proteolytic enzymes
that degrade ECM components at neutral
pH.10,26 Numerous studies have demon-
strated that individual MMPs play crucial
roles in tumour invasion and metastasis.27,28
In the present study, positive immunohisto-
chemical staining for MMP-9 protein was
detected in 60/80 (75.0%) of patients, and
noncancerous adjacent tissues were shown
to be negative for MMP-9 immunostaining,
which was consistent with previous
findings in other human tumours.10,29,30
Moreover, the level of VEGF immunostain-
ing was significantly positively correlated
with the level of MMP-9 immunostaining
(r ¼ 0.78, P < 0.01).
The details of the roles of VEGF and
MMP-9 in malignant glioma remain unclear
and need to be elucidated in further studies.
Although our study showed that MMP9 and
VEGF expression are related to WHO
glioma grade, associations with clinico-
pathological factors including age, sex,
tumour size and overall survival of patients
were not investigated as the data were not
available. Further studies should be con-
ducted in which this information is
collected.
In conclusion, the upregulation of VEGF
or MMP-9 proteins may be an important
feature of malignant glioma. The combined
immunohistochemical evaluation of the
levels of VEGF and MMP-9 proteins in pri-
mary tumours might be of benefit in pre-
dicting a poor prognosis of survival in
patients with malignant glioma.
