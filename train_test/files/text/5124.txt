The Socioeconomic Context
Gilgit-Baltistan, most recently known as Northern Areas, is
a partially self-governing territory under Pakistani control. It
forms parts of Pakistan's international borders with China to
the northeast, Afghanistan to the northwest, and Indian- and
Pakistan-administered Kashmir to the southeast.
In the last census (1998), the population of Gilgit-Baltistan
was 870,347. The population is growing with the rate of
2.8% and, according to a recent estimation, the population
has approached 1 million (Government of Pakistan, 2010).
Despite some positive socioeconomic changes, the region
remains one of the most disadvantaged in Pakistan. The geo-
graphical isolation, hard climatic conditions, mountainous
environment, and scarcity of resources contribute to the
region's continuing socioeconomic backwardness. People
have very limited access to essential facilities such as health
care, education, communication, electricity, and transporta-
tion. Most people (90%) live in sparsely scattered remote vil-
lages. The annual per capita income is estimated at 60% of
the national standard of US$1,047 (Government of Pakistan,
2009a). The communities depend for their livelihood on a
variety of sources such as substance farming, employment
with government and private sector organizations, and lim-
ited commercial activities (e.g., trade with China, tourism,
retailing, transport, and running restaurants). The major
source of livelihood, however, remains subsistence farming
of wheat, corn, barely, vegetables, fruits, and cattle. Marketing
of fresh and dried fruits such as apple, pear, cherries, apricot,
almond, and walnut contributes to families' income (The
Aga Khan Rural Support Program, 2000).
The education indicators for Gilgit-Baltistan Pakistan fall
below the national average, and the quality of education in
the region is inferior to that of the rest of Pakistan (The Aga
Khan Development Network [AKDN], 2001). The adult lit-
eracy rates are 64% for males and 34% for females
(Government of Pakistan, 2010). The gross school enrolment

A Case Study of the Common Difficulties
Experienced by High School Students in
Chemistry Classroom in Gilgit-Baltistan
(Pakistan)
Takbir Ali1
Abstract
This article reports a research study conducted with four chemistry teachers in three high schools (two government schools
and one private school) in Gilgit-Baltistan region of Pakistan.The study investigated questions concerning common difficulties
high school (Grades 9 and 10) students experience in chemistry classroom,the possible reasons for these difficulties,and the
ways in which teachers help students overcome these difficulties. A qualitative case study method was used to investigate
the questions, which used in-depth interviews with teachers, classroom observation, and postobservation discussion with
the teachers, as main data collection tools.The key findings of the study allude to a huge gap between what is intended in the
National Curriculum in terms of students' learning in chemistry and what actually happens in the classroom where students
learn chemistry. Promoting in-depth learning appeared to be an uphill task for the teachers.The main hurdle lies in students'
inability to demonstrate a good understanding of very basic concepts of the subject. Despite faced with such a challenge, the
teachers appear to be committed to teaching their subject.The implications of the results of the study are explained in the
context of schools,teachers,and other educational stakeholders by emphasizing the need for synchronization and integration
of efforts on the part of schools.

and literacy rates, particularly the level of participation in
middle and secondary education, vary substantially from
place to place within the region, both rates being generally
lower for women (AKDN, 2001).
The most widely recognized challenge to school improve-
ment in Gilgit-Baltistan comes from deeply entrenched
instructional practices that make students memorize a great
deal of information with the limited purpose of reproducing
it in the Board Examinations (The Aga Khan Education
Service, 2005; The Aga Khan Foundation, 1998; Shafa,
2003; World Bank, 2004). The Aga Khan Education Service
(2005) noted, "Teaching methods are teacher-centered and
do not encourage student participation. Rote memorization
and moral dictates go hand in hand with a punitive school
environment" (p. 24). It further points out that the quality of
education is particularly low in the rural areas because
schools have insufficient material resources and staff, and
teachers are either untrained or poorly trained. The report
also says that most teachers have little exposure to English
and few opportunities to practice it and that, in many cases,
teachers have inadequate content knowledge, particularly in
mathematics and science.
Background of the Study
The National Education Policies in Pakistan including the
recent one (Government of Pakistan, 2009b) have consid-
ered quality education in general and science education in
particular as a means to achieving radical social develop-
ment. The Government of Pakistan (2009b) stressed that
comprehensive social development can be achieved by
developing a strong base of workforces that is equipped with
cutting edge scientific and technological knowledge and
skills. By and large, the education system in the country has
failed to ensure provision of quality and purposeful science
education for the young generation. This failure is mainly
attributed to such factors as irrelevant science curriculum,
school milieu, and classroom practices to ignite the interest
of students and inculcate in them positive attitude toward
science. A critical look at the status of science education in
Pakistan reveals a dismaying situation, which is reflected in
students' low achievement in core science subjects such as
chemistry, biology, mathematics, and physics, particularly at
secondary level, which is a critical stage for students to
decide about their field of study after Grade 10. Chemistry
is taught as a compulsory subject to Grades 9 and 10 stu-
dents who opt for science as their main field of study at
secondary level in high school in Gilgit-Baltistan. The
chemistry curriculum prescribed for secondary classes
(Grades 10 and 12) contains a wide spectrum of concepts
pertaining to organic, inorganic, and physical chemistry that
are to be learnt and mastered by the students in a 2-year
period. Nation Chemistry Curriculum of 2006 for Grades 9 and
10 is a well-constructed document. The aims and objectives
are comprehensive and well articulated, and standards and
benchmarks are well defined and aligned appropriately with
aims and objectives. The National Chemistry Curriculum
states:
Chemistry Curriculum builds on the vertical progres-
sion of the K-VIII science curriculum. It offers a rela-
tively in-depth study of chemistry as a major,
independent science. It focuses on content, process
skill, problem solving, inquiry, and critical and ana-
lytical thinking skills . . . The aim of the curriculum is
to produce students who will be capable of doing
independent thinking, asking questions, and looking
for answers on their own. (p. 01)
The curriculum is based on three broad categories of
activities that define the critical abilities of scientifically lit-
erate students in Pakistan. These are knowing and using sci-
ence knowledge (learning science), constructing new science
knowledge (doing science), and reflecting on science knowl-
edge (thinking science). These broad performance indicators
are connected with standards and benchmarks that describe
what knowledge and skills students should acquire in the
subject. These standards emphasize "higher order thing,"
"deep knowledge," "substantive knowledge," and "connec-
tion to the world beyond the grade room" (Government of
Pakistan, 2006, p. 04).
The ultimate learning outcomes intended in the National
Curriculum are quite ambitious, requiring teachers to adopt a
comprehensive vision of pedagogies and engage in practices
premised on constructivist philosophy of learning that empha-
sizes centrality of students in the learning process. How this
happens in reality? My experiences allude to a wide gulf that
exists between the ideal curricular goals and what actually
happens in most of chemistry classrooms in Pakistan in gen-
eral and in rural Gilgit-Baltistan in particular.
The spiral science curriculum followed in schools in
Pakistan includes a wide range of concepts; the number of
concepts and knowledge around these concepts grow com-
plex with change of class (Grades 1-10). Like the curricula
of social sciences, the school curriculum of natural science
are also subject to criticism. The most common criticism of
the schools' science curricula is that the curricula are not
necessarily designed by taking into account the research in
the field of cognitive science and educational psychology.
This pitfall in the process of the development of curriculum
has resulted in a large gap between curricular learning targets
and level of students' cognitive abilities; some of these abili-
ties develop with age. So the curriculum prescribed for vari-
ous grades is not pitched at the actual cognitive capacity of
different grade students to acquire and process knowledge
(Iqbal & Shayer, 1995, 2000). In a study in Pakistan, Iqbal
and Shayer (1995) found visible gaps in between-curricular
demands and cognitive levels of middle grade students (aged
11-13). The researcher, using the developmental stages pro-
posed by the Jean Piaget as reference points, investigated the
Ali 3
relationship between curriculum demands and the cognitive
levels of Grades 6 to 8 students. The researchers found visi-
ble gaps between the demands of middle grades science cur-
riculum and cognitive levels of students. The researchers
concluded, "It becomes evident that there exists a gap--
which becomes increasingly wider--between curricular
demand and the cognitive levels of middles school students"
(p. 48). This made it difficult for teachers to teach the cur-
riculum for understanding, and as a result, students were
forced to learn by rote. The teachers also need to adapt cur-
riculum to students' level of cognitions and experiences by
adjusting modifying instructions, adjusting materials, and
designing tasks to engage students in process-based learning,
and employing motivational techniques to increase students'
interest, confidence, and competence in science at secondary
level.
Most of the children who study chemistry at the secondary
level are not satisfied with their experiences of learning, in
schools in general and public system schools in particular. As
mentioned above, curriculum standards emphasize acquisition
of specialized knowledge that needs certain attitudes, frame of
mind, and skills on the part of students. Teaching of chemistry
in government as well as in private schools in Gilgit-Baltistan
contributes little to attainment of the critical knowledge, skills,
and attitudes envisaged in the National Curriculum document.
Resultantly, students find it difficult to engage in in-depth
learning of content knowledge in chemistry. With a weak
foundation, students even after passing Secondary School
Certificate (SSC) examination fail to make any strong connec-
tion with the subject. According to Iqbal, Azam, and Rana
(2009), "The traditional approach starts from predetermined
body of knowledge . . . The traditional way of teaching science
is strictly based on textbooks and teacher is believed to be a
dispenser of knowledge" (pp. 5-6).
Based on my experiences and my reflections as a learner,
as teacher, and lately as a teacher, I developed interest in the
kind of research I have reported in this article. The experi-
ences I gained working with students and teachers in govern-
ment schools in different parts of Pakistan are reminiscent of
my early experiences as a student. I recall how much time
and effort I needed to put into memorizing factual informa-
tion from textbook. Teacher would force us to memorize
subject matter in chemistry (definitions, theories, principles,
chemical equations, etc.) merely to be able to recall this
information in the examination. I found my perceptions
about teaching and learning developed during student life
influencing my practices as a teacher. Gradually, exposition
to new experiences that came through formal training and
ongoing reflections, my perceptions about teaching and
learning science changed. I began to believe that there is no
real value in learning scientific knowledge through memori-
zation; learning subject matter knowledge in science is pow-
erful after going through certain cognitive processes such as
constructing hypothesis, test hypothesis, classifying infor-
mation, controlling variables, making predictions, carrying
out practical activities, doing observation, recording and
analyzing data, and making sense of the data. Until and
unless a leaner practices or undergoes some of these cogni-
tive process in the science classroom, gaining conceptual
understanding into science concepts remains a utopian dream
for majority of students. Students' transition into secondary
science curriculum without having command over knowl-
edge of subject matter in middle-level science curriculum
becomes really a challenge for the students as well as for the
teachers. As a result, majority of students in high school
struggles with their science subjects, particularly chemistry
course. More than 50% students would require to retake their
examination in the chemistry course. Even the students who
pass the course usually do not gain desired depth in under-
standing the knowledge of subject matter. There has been a
lack of systematic and in-depth investigation into the situa-
tions and issues that surround teaching and learning of chem-
istry in high school in Gilgit-Baltistan. Research studies are
needed to better understand the problems as well as the pos-
sibilities of improving teaching chemistry in high schools in
Gilgit-Baltistan and Pakistan at large.
Literature Review
Researchers around the world have examined a wide range
of issues and practices in chemistry classrooms from various
angles. The findings from this body of research suggest
ways for improving teaching chemistry at the secondary
level. However, research studies conducted in chemistry
classroom at the secondary level, both in Pakistani and inter-
national context, have predominantly focused on identifying
students' misconceptions around a wide range of chemistry
concepts. Typically, the studies, interested in students' mis-
conceptions, have used different diagnostic tools, such as
test instrument, checklist, and so on, or conducting diagnos-
tic interviews with students or with teachers, to elicit their
misconceptions and its origin. There have been hardly any
efforts on the part of researchers interested in misconception
to situate them in the social context of the classroom. Studies
of conceptual difficulties in chemistry more often than not
take place within an environment created by the researcher
to serve the specific purpose of his or her study.
The complexity of classroom life is important to be con-
sidered because students and teachers are expected to col-
laborate on every aspect of classroom life involving teachers
relating to students and students relating to each other
through various ways such as discussion, debating, and com-
municating ideas. The complex interaction between teacher
and students and among students constitutes the social con-
text of classroom environment where teachers and students
are engaged in a collective process of learning that produces
shared understanding and generates new knowledge or per-
spectives and helps students take responsibility of their own
learning (e.g., Brown & Campione, 1996; Tahir & Treagust,
1999). This requires teachers to balance the tensions
4 SAGE Open
and discrepancies between students' ideas and scientific
knowledge, and ensure that classroom activities are geared
toward in-depth understanding of important science ideas
and practices (Crawford, Kelley, & Brown, 2000). This
underscores the need for investigating students' tensions and
difficulties by situating them in the social context of
the classroom where teachers and students are engaged in
collective process of constructing knowledge of scientific
phenomena.
Moreover, secondary-level chemistry course requires sig-
nificant prerequisite knowledge and understanding of very
basic concepts. The researchers showing interest in students'
or teachers' misconception have predominantly focused on
eliciting a sophisticated understating of advanced-level con-
tent and thereby "taking for granted" the common difficul-
ties that arise from the lack of understanding of a range of
very basic concepts and terms that are commonly used in
chemistry classroom as a base to understand advanced-level
scientific knowledge. It is therefore pertinent to ask as how
students, particularly students in rural settings, such as
Gilgit-Baltistan, where a variety of general and context-spe-
cific challenges paint a poor picture of teaching and learning
science, grapple with such basic concepts in chemistry class-
room. The issues and challenges students confront at various
levels are complex and may not be grasped only through
using diagnostic test instruments; rather, they can be cap-
tured in a more comprehensive way by studying them as they
occur in the complex social environment of the classroom
during routine teaching.
"Misconception research" has produced a great deal of
knowledge about misconceptions or alternative frameworks
that hamper students' in-depth learning of concepts in chem-
istry. A large number of studies in international context as
well as in Pakistan have investigated students' misconcep-
tion around a wide range of concepts in secondary chemistry.
Some of these concepts are atoms and molecules (e.g.,
Griffiths & Preston, 1992; Harrison & De Jong, 2005;
Teichert, Tien, Anthony, & Rickey, 2008); gases and related
concepts such as temperature, pressure, kinetic molecular
theory, diffusion (e.g., Benson, Wittrock, & Baur, 1993;
Krnel, Watson, & Glazar, 1998); chemical bonding (e.g.,
Coll & Taylor, 2001; Frailich, Kesner, & Hofstein, 2009;
Othman, Treagust, & Chandrasegaran, 2008); solution, solu-
bility, and solubility equilibrium (e.g., Ebenezer & Erickson,
1996; Pinarbasi & Canpolat, 2003; Raviolo, 2001); electro-
chemistry and related concepts (e.g., Coll & Treagust, 2003;
Sanger & Greenbowe, 1997; Taber, 1997); structure and
properties of molecular and ionic compounds (e.g., Butts &
Smith, 1987); particle theory (Johnson, 1998a, 1998b;
Mursaleen, 1999); chemical equilibrium (e.g., Banerjee,
1991); acids and bases (e.g., Drechsler & Schmidt, 2005;
Hand, 1989; Lin & Chiu, 2007; Nakhleh, 1994; Schmidt,
1995).
The studies cited above have revealed several misconcep-
tions or alternative conceptions that serve as barriers to
in-depth learning of concepts in chemistry. Some of these
studies have also investigated the origins of these miscon-
ceptions (e.g., Bano, 1998; Driver, Squires, Rushworth, &
Wood-Robinson, 1994; Harrison & Treagust, 2002; Krnel
et al., 1998; Syed, 2003; Wandersee, Mintzes, & Novak,
1994). A common but a key finding that cuts across the les-
sons learnt in these studies is about the students' lack of
understanding of the Particulate Theory because almost
every concept in chemistry depends on the particulate nature
of matter, which lays the foundation for understanding of
other concepts (Harrison & Treagust, 2002). As noted by
Taber (1997), many students' problems in chemistry lie in
not understanding the relation between the molecular and
macroscopic representations because students have not
grasped the role of models in chemistry. Students' miscon-
ceptions regarding these concepts are based on the fact that
they live and operate within macroscopic world of matter
and do not easily follow shifts between macroscopic and
submacroscopic levels. Consequently, they tend to develop
alternative conceptions and nonscientific mental models.
Adding to the problem is the fact that the teachers tend to
consider the particulate nature of matter as one of the simpler
topics to be dealt with quickly at the beginning of the year.
To sum up, as indicated by the above-cited studies, stu-
dents generally do not understand the fundamental ideas of
the Particulate Theory. Misunderstanding of basic ideas
relating to the Particulate Theory pervades other concepts, as
it serves to establish an alternative conception in students'
minds that causes them to misunderstand further content
knowledge in chemistry presented to them. Much of research
in science education has capitalized on the work of cognitive
psychologists. Learning in science is viewed as a highly
complex cognitive activity. Researchers have explored the
effect of diverse cognitive and personality characteristic on
children's learning science. However, the pioneering work
done by cognitive psychologists, Piaget and Vygotsky, the
two renowned cognitive psychologists, have made signifi-
cant contribution to learning science. In fact, their theories
provided a conceptual base to constructivism, one of the
major contemporary theory of learning. Central to Piaget's
cognitive constructivism and Vygotsky's social constructiv-
ism is the emphasis on the role of social world in the cogni-
tive development of a child. Despite their agreement on the
inseparable nature of the relationships between individual
and the environment, the two cognitive psychologists differ
in the way in which they conceive the role of social world
and the individual. According to Piaget (1977, cited in
Atherton, 2011), the development of the child is a result of
an adaptation to the social and the physical milieu. Social life
is a necessary condition for the development of logic (Piaget,
1977, cited in Wood, 1998). Vygotsky built his theory on
the premise that individual intellectual or cognitive develop-
ment can be better understood with reference to the social
milieu in which social support in the form of interaction with
others that also involve skills, which have developed in a
Ali 5
sociohistorical context, mediate intellectual activity. Thus,
individual development, from Vygotsky's point of view,
becomes a high mental process that cannot be understood
within the context of social interactions.
Yet another type of research within the genre of research
in science education is attitude based or attitudinal research.
The attitudinal research is based on the premise that students'
meaningful engagement in learning science is primarily
determined by their level of motivation and positive attitudes
and optimism towards the subject (Osborne, Simon, &
Collins, 2011; Rogoff, 2006). The attitude-based research
studies conducted in Pakistan (e.g., Anwar & Bhutta, 2010;
Iqbal et al., 2009; Iqbal, Nageen, & Pell, 2008) and else-
where in the world (e.g., Foley & McPhee, 2008; Haussler &
Hoffmann, 2003) typically have focused on students' atti-
tudes toward learning science. In the attitude-based research,
the main focus has been on perceptions, experiences, emo-
tions, thoughts, opinions, enthusiasm, likes and dislikes, and
so on. In the attitudinal research, researchers have used a
variety of variables as units for attitude analysis such as age
level or study grades, gender, social context, rural and urban
sites, and so on. Overview of the various finding from attitu-
dinal research literature can be summarized into three inter-
related broad or general principles: first, students' attitude
toward science is an important determinant of how students
relate to the subject that in turn influences how they learn
science; second, students' attitude toward science is shaped
by numerous factors from the sociocultural environment in
which students live and undergo social experiences which in
turn influence students' cognitive or intellectual abilities;
and third, positive attitude towards science are inherently
linked with their social and life experiences and thereby stu-
dents' level of success in learning science is attributed to the
level of motivation they bring to learning the subject. These
principles, emanating from attitudinal research, have impor-
tant implications for efforts toward improving science edu-
cation. These principles are further briefly examined with
the help from the researcher literature.
Iqbal et al. (2008), using an attitude scale used by research-
ers in the United Kingdom (Pell & Jarvis, 2001, cited in Iqbal
et al., 2008), explored primary and elementary school
(Grades 4-8) children's attitude toward science, with particu-
lar interest to see if there was a difference in the level of the
effect of Islamic values on students' attitude compared with
the British secular societal values. The study used students'
gender and schools' locations (urban and semiurban context)
as important units of analysis. The findings suggested that
despite many sociocultural differences, no significant varia-
tions in predetermined attitude indicators were found in the
Pakistani and the British study. Pakistani children, both from
urban and semiurban locations, seemed to be in accord with
their peers in British schools who considered exploratory and
discovery-based learning as means to effective learning in
science. The overarching conclusion of the study is that
despite the acute lack of resources for science education in
schools, boys and girls both from urban and semiurban
schools hold positive views about learning science. Children
in semiurban environment bring positive attitude toward sci-
ence despite the fact that they do not get opportunity in
schools to do experimentation. The researchers infer, "exper-
imental approach to science is attractive to children regard-
less of gender and geographical locations" (Iqbal et al., 2008,
p. 281). It is interesting to note that children from semiurban
context displayed more positive attitude toward becoming
scientists compared with their peers in urban schools. This,
according to the researchers, is due to the fact that parents
reinforce the perception among children that in underprivi-
leged rural or semiurban context getting education in the
field of science is an easy way to finding reasonable employ-
ment and improving living conditions. Pakistani studies (e.g.,
Anwar & Bhutta, 2010; Iqbal et al., 2008) are not in accord
with international studies that have reported the role of sex as
being the most influential variable related toward children's
attitudes to science. Boys have consistently shown positive
attitude towards science than girls, although both Pakistan
studies did not see any significant influence of gender on stu-
dents' attitude toward science.
Research in science education has established that stu-
dents'level of success in learning science is inherently linked
with their positive attitude toward science that in turn is
attributed to the level of motivation they bring to learning the
subject. Research has revealed that students' motivation in
science learning plays a pivotal role in promoting conceptual
change and engaging in deep and reflective thinking, which
are instrumental in enhancing students'science achievement.
This suggests that stimulating students' motivation to learn
science becomes an intervention on the part of teachers.
Research in Pakistan and other countries on the role of
focused intervention in improving students' learning out-
comes in science have found positive correlation between
the two. The implication of attitude-based research is that
teachers are not merely to focus on modifying their own
classroom practices rather they have to play a role in chang-
ing the conditions in the inextricably entwined contexts of
classroom, school, home, and the larger society. A study by
Iqbal and Shayer (2000) investigated the impact of a 2-year
intervention program undertaken to accelerate students' cog-
nitive development in selected public and private secondary
schools in Pakistan. The intervention program, tested previ-
ously in a research study in the United Kingdom, involved
teacher training and visit of experts to selected schools sites
to provide on-the-spot guidance to teachers regarding con-
ducting lessons. To assess students' level of cognitive devel-
opment, pre- and posttests were conducted using the
Piagetian test. The analysis of the data showed notable dif-
ferences in the performance of students from control and
experimental schools; the intervention seemed to have visi-
ble impact on students' cognitive development manifested
by their ability to construct meaning, engaging in metacogni-
tion and logical reasoning. All these cognitive skills are
6 SAGE Open
critically important for learning science with understanding.
The researchers concluded that factors such as quality of the
input (teacher skills and attitude), school philosophy, and
general cultural of the schools came to play to determine the
overall impact of the intervention.
Efforts on the part on individual teacher or schools to
improve secondary students' learning outcomes in science
need to be cognizant of the complex nature of the learning in
science. In-depth learning of science is influenced by multi-
ple interactive factors. To understand the impact of contex-
tual factors on learning science, it is necessary to examine
the circumstances around teaching and learning of science
and the meaning given to these by teachers and schools as
well as by parents and community members. Teachers and
school, trying to improve students' learning outcomes in sci-
ence, find themselves confined within a set of conditions that
may support or hinder effective learning in science. By creat-
ing those conditions that support effective learning, teachers,
managers, and parents can enhance the opportunity for aca-
demic improvement to become a permanent part of the
school and the classroom environment. Those conditions
that hamper improvement in teaching and learning pro-
cesses, if remain unrecognized, lead to failure despite all
efforts on part of teachers and school.
Method
The Participants of the Study
This study involved four secondary school teachers (three
male, one female), teaching chemistry at the secondary
level, who were selected through purposive sampling pro-
cess, coming from three high schools (two associated with
government and one belonging to a private, not-for-profit
school system) characterized by their relatively good reputa-
tion for imparting quality science education at the secondary
level. To study science, students from other neighboring
elementary or high schools would take admission in the
sampled schools. The four participants drawn from these
schools were selected as a representative of those surveyed
in purposive sampling process, and all displayed a high level
of commitment towards teaching their subject. The selection
criteria considered to include chemistry teachers in the
sample who had at least 5 years of experience in teaching
chemistry and were interested in improving their teaching
methods and modifying and adjusting their instruction for
the purpose of improved students'learning in chemistry. The
information that helped to identify the schools and the teach-
ers within these schools was collected through visiting
schools and district offices, meeting with headteachers,
teachers and students, district officials, and reading through
documents such as examination results.
Through written application, I obtained administrative con-
sent from competent authorities of the schools and from the
participants. I provided the authorities and the participants
with detailed information about my study: the purpose of
the study, its intended benefits, sampling criteria, the demands
on teachers' time, the timeline of the study, data collection
tools and procedure, and assurance of confidentiality and
anonymity.
I did not directly interact with students. However, I
observed them learning chemistry in the classroom. In this
way, they become secondary participants in my study.
I observed teaching and learning process in three different
classrooms having students in chemistry class ranging from
30 to 40 students. So, on average, I could collect data about
100 students' learning chemistry during routine lessons in
the classroom.
As articulated above, primarily the study is not concerned
with exploration of students' misconception around certain
topics in chemistry; rather it aims to create a context for dis-
cussion and reflection on common issues, tensions, and chal-
lenges faced by students in chemistry classroom in high
schools in Gilgit-Baltistan. The underlying purpose is simply
to gain a better contextualized understanding into how the
rhetoric of change (engaging students in variety of processes
to foster scientific thinking and cognitive development)
reflected in the National Curriculum interacts with the reali-
ties of practice in the context of students' learning of chem-
istry in high schools in Gilgit-Baltistan.
I employed qualitative case study method to generate
relevant data in the study. The case study method helped in
collecting rich qualitative data about classroom processes
such as instructions, teacher­student interaction, students'
encounter with knowledge of subject matter, and teachers'
pedagogical tactics. Multiple data collection tools, such as
in-depth interviews, classroom observations, and postobser-
vation reflective discussion with the teachers were used to
gathered qualitative data. Classroom observations helped
document activities and processes, critical incidences, and
anecdotal evidence about students' difficulties in learning
concepts and teacher's pedagogical moves to remedy these
difficulties. The postobservation reflective discussion with
the teachers and in-depth interview with the research partici-
pants helped access the participants' experiences, beliefs,
and values that underpin their teaching practices. To facili-
tate in-depth interviews with individual participants, open-
ended questions were used that allowed further probing.
The teachers were interviewed for about an hour regard-
ing their teaching of chemistry in general and about teaching
primary concepts in particular. They were asked to reflect on
the instructional strategies, instructional materials, class-
room activities, and home tasks, catering to individual stu-
dents'learning needs. The interviews were recorded on audio
cassettes and were transcribed and analyzed.
I observed five routine lessons (35- to 40-min long
instruction time) of each teacher. The purpose of the obser-
vations was to examine in depth how the teachers organize
activities around the topic under consideration, what chal-
lenges confronted students in in-depth learning of subject
Ali 7
matter, and how the teachers helped them in the learning pro-
cess and improved students' understanding of the subject
matter.
The in-depth interviews with teachers, classroom obser-
vations, and postobservation reflective discussions with
teachers were guided mainly by the following general
questions:
· What common difficulties do students experience
during routine chemistry lessons?
· What are the possible reasons for these difficulties?
· How do teachers, in their day-to-day teaching, help
students overcome these difficulties?
Data Analysis
The above three questions represent together a framework
for collection and analysis of data provided. The data analy-
sis was guided by three main categories: (a) teachers'experi-
ences about conceptual learning of subject matter; (b) the
issues, tensions, and challenges associated with in-depth
learning of basic chemistry concepts; and (c) the manner in
which teachers assist students to overcome conceptual dif-
ficulties and tensions.
Based on the above categories, content analysis (Miles &
Huberman, 1994) was carried out, which involved reading
and rereading of transcripts, identification of small key ideas,
and grouping and regrouping these ideas into key themes.
The key themes were compared across the four cases to iden-
tify cross-cutting key themes. The broad cross-cutting themes
were formulated into key findings, which were further ana-
lyzed and interpreted to reach plausible conclusions.
Findings
Analysis of the data collected through classroom observa-
tion, postobservation reflective discussion, and in-depth
interviews with the teachers helped identify certain critical
incidences and anecdotal evidences that explain the common
difficulties faced by students in chemistry classrooms, the
causes underlying these difficulties, and teachers' responses
to these difficulties. Triangulation of data from three differ-
ent sources helped identify key cross-cutting themes. These
themes are translated into the following key findings.
First, there is a huge gap between what is intended in the
National Curriculum and what actually happens in the class-
room where students learn chemistry. The realities of prac-
tice suggest that for chemistry teachers, fostering in-depth
learning in line with and in the true spirit of the aims and
objectives of the National Curriculum is a task easier said
than done. Realization of such curricular goals as develop-
ment of higher order thinking, knowing and using scientific
knowledge, and constructing new science knowledge
remains a utopian dream in high school in Gilgit-Baltistan.
Second, there are multiple reasons contributing to stu-
dents' failure to engage in meaningful learning in chemistry
classrooms. However, the main hurdle lies in students'
inability to demonstrate a good understanding of very basic
concepts of the subject. Due to huge gaps in students' under-
standing of fundamental concepts, they are unable to engage
in in-depth learning of advanced level content. This finding
accords with the lessons reported by other studies that
emphasize the inherent link between students' prior knowl-
edge and new knowledge (e.g., Gollub, Bertenthal, Labov, &
Curtis, 2002; Mayhill & Brackley, 2004; Perkins, 1993).
Third, despite working against all odds, the teachers
appear to be committed to teaching their subject. They do try
to assist students to overcome the difficulties in their effort to
make a good sense of the subject matter presented to them.
The teachers do make deliberate efforts to value and explore
students' prior knowledge and use it as a basis to help stu-
dents construct an understanding of concepts under consid-
eration. They do try out their own unique remedial tactics
and instructional strategies to engage students in meaningful
learning. These strategies include using examples, analogies,
questioning, cues and probing, and prompting; offering alter-
native explanation; supplying information to fill knowledge
gaps; reinforcing key points; and backtracking. Backtracking,
however, remains a dominant instructional strategy the
teachers use to bridge the gaps that existed between students'
prior knowledge and the content knowledge under consider-
ation. These pedagogical tactics are very much grounded in
the teachers' personal experiences as learners and resulting
intuitive understandings of ways through which to help stu-
dents grasp concepts by constructing their own meaning and
making connections.
The teachers are familiar with the variety of challenges
faced by students in in-depth learning of subject matter. They
demonstrate awareness about the ways through which to
address these challenges or at least mitigate the adverse
effect of these challenges on students'learning. Akram Khan
(pseudonyms), for example, reflects on such a challenge and
his approach to dealing with it. He says,
In my view, Periodic Table of elements is the back-
bone of chemistry. Understanding of the chemistry is
contingent upon understanding of the Periodic Table.
Had I been the author of this book [Chemistry], I
would have kept the Periodic Table as the first chapter.
In chemistry, the Periodic Table should be taught first.
Students' learning about concepts such as valency is
dependent on their understanding of the concepts of
"Groups" and "Periods" [in the Periodic Table]. I
would say children who understand the Periodic Table
well can easily grasp the whole subject. (Excerpt from
teacher's interview)
Afzal Ali (pseudonyms), another participant, makes simi-
lar observations when he says,
The textbook defines the concept of valency as "the
ability of an element to combine with another element
8 SAGE Open
to form a compound." This is vague, and that is why it
takes us three days to make children understand the
concept of valency. We need to emphasize a deeper
knowledge of Periodic Table first. (Excerpt from
teacher's interview)
Here the teachers criticize the chemistry textbooks
because their sequencing of chapters and topics lacks inter-
nal logic and coherence. The Periodic Table provides very
basic information about the characteristics of the elements.
Therefore, their suggestion of resequencing textbook's chap-
ters and shifting the Periodic Table from Chapter 3 to Chapter
1 may make a sense.
Furthermore, the teachers consider learning as a develop-
mental process in which earlier experiences provide the foun-
dations for making sense of later ones. They believe that their
students can construct knowledge through an interaction
between what they know already and the new learning they
experience. Nargis Bano (pseudonyms), for example, consid-
ers linking students' prior understanding to a new concept as
central to promoting conceptual learning. She argues, "If stu-
dents'prior understanding of a concept is probed in-depth and
breadth, it helps a great deal in fostering deeper understand-
ing of the subject matter" (excerpt from teacher's interview).
Muhammad Basheer (pseudonyms) also echoes Nargis
Bano's emphasis on prior knowledge when he says, "For me
it is highly desirable to consider how can I make connections
between new learning and prior learning and how those con-
nections can variously support or confound students' acquisi-
tionofnewunderstanding"(excerptfromteacher'sinterview).
Arguing in a similar vein, Afzal Ali (pseudonyms) says,
"Students possess a quite complex structure of ideas and
experiences; and, if motivated and provided with proper help,
they can gain deep understanding through interactions
between new knowledge and previous knowledge of the con-
cept" (excerpt from teacher's interview). Akram Khan holds
similar views about building students' understanding of sub-
ject matter on what they already know about the concept. For
example, reflecting on one of his instructional decisions dur-
ing a chemistry lesson, he explains:
The task I assigned to student was a little bit challeng-
ing because I believe that students possess the abilities
for doing everything. If we provide them with oppor-
tunities they can do it [learn on their own]. Children
carry with them a rich collection of ideas and informa-
tion. The only thing they need is guidance. (Excerpt
from postobservation discussion)
In the above, the teachers'reflections underscore the need
for valuing students' ideas, conceptions, opinions, experi-
ences, and knowledge and linking them with a new knowl-
edge or experiences.
The Situations Revealing Students'Tensions
and Difficulties
Students' tensions and difficulties were manifested by the
close observation of the following situations in the class-
room: when the teacher introduced a new concept in a lesson
and students could not cope with it; a lesson involving more
advance-level information pertaining to the subject matter
under consideration; students recalling factual information
(word to word) instead of describing the ideas, information,
or meaning in their own words; students' inability to linking
ideas or making conceptual connections; students' not offer-
ing explanation in support of their viewpoint; and students
not asking question. All these situations were recognized by
the triangulation of data from my field notes (classroom
observation), teachers' interviews, and teachers' reflection
on anecdotes and critical incidences.
Classroom Anecdotes and Critical Incidences
Example 1 (Atomic model/structure). In one of the chemis-
try lessons, Akram Khan was teaching chemical equation,
but given the situation he needed to revisit the atomic model.
The students confused the definition of atomic number with
mass number, position, and characteristics of atomic parti-
cles in the atom with each other (e.g., associating negativity
with proton and positivity with electron). Primarily, the dif-
ficulty in gaining in-depth understanding of the concept of
atomic model seems to be embedded in the complex and
abstract nature of the concept, as noted by many studies con-
cerned with the particulate theory of matter. The teacher
explained by using diagram of atomic model (labeling and
describing parts of atom) and did backtracking (recalling
information previously learnt).
Example II (Ionic bonding). A lesson dealt with formation of
the ionic compound calcium chloride (CaCl
2
). Students
thought that in CaCl
2
, Ca+2 combined with 2Cl-1. The mis-
conception lied in the fact that Cl-1 + Cl-1 = 2Cl-1 instead of
conceiving it as Cl-1 + Cl-1 = 2Cl-2. Students were also con-
fused that why Ca+2 + (Cl-1 + Cl-1) is written as CaCl
2
why
not 2CaCl. The teacher verbally explained the law of definite
proportion and showed on the blackboard how it applied to
the example at hand: Ca carries two plus charges (Ca+2),
whereas Cl carries one minus charge. So to form ionic bond
between Ca and Cl, two atoms of Cl are required. The total
charge on Cl atoms taking part in the reaction will be -2.
Example III (Chemical equations). In one of the lessons
involving chemical equations, students could not easily deal
with the question of balancing chemical equation, and sec-
ond could not explain to the teacher as why did they write 2
with H on the left-hand side and 2 with H
2
O on the right-
hand side of the equation, that is, 2H
2
+ O
2
= 2H
2
O and 2Na
+ Cl
2
= 2NaCl. In fact, the teacher was preparing students for
Ali 9
a lesson about chemical bonds. The lesson began with teach-
er's question: "Who can tell me chemical formula of water?"
Two students (29 students were present in the class) kept
quiet, the rest raised their hands, indicating that they knew
the answer. The teacher chose one student to answer the
question. Students correctly recalled the answer (H
2
O).
Teacher posed second question: "Who can describe for me
how water (H
2
O) forms?" This time the number of raised
hands decreased (23 students raised their hands) implying
some students' inability to recall or describe the process
involved in the formation of water molecule. After a pause,
one student correctly recalled the information: "Two mole-
cules of hydrogen combine with one molecule of oxygen to
form water." The teacher wrote the statement on the chalk-
board and invited students to represent it in the form of
chemical equation (using symbols). This time, relatively a
less proportion of students, showed their interest to come
forward and write the chemical equation. One student came
forward and, with trial and error, she wrote the equation: H
2
+ O
2
= H
2
O. The teacher praised the student's effort and at
the same time challenged her that what she had produced
was not 100% correct. The teacher invited other students to
recognize what was lacking in the equation and then to add
the missing element so that a "balanced equation" was
obtained. The teacher asked the class to complete the equa-
tion on their notebooks. It appeared that only a few students
seemed to have the ability to correctly answer the question
(successfully attempted the question: 2H
2 +
O
2
= 2H
2
O).
Finally, teacher asked for justification (reasoning) as why it
required them to add 2 with H
2
(reactant) on the left-hand
side and 2 with H
2
O (product) on the right-hand side of the
chemical equation. Hardly 2 students out of 29 present in the
class offered reason as why modification was required in the
equation and how it was made.
Discussion
To reflect through the findings regarding the difficulties
underlying in-depth student learning, I briefly examined the
nature and the causes of the difficulties students are faced
with in coping with the concepts cited above and teacher's
action to remedy the situation.
In chemistry, the concept of "atomic model" and allied
subconcepts form the very foundation on which learning of
the entire discipline depends. It may not be an exaggeration
to describe knowledge of atomic model combined with some
of its primary allied concepts as a backbone of the under-
standing of the knowledge base of the whole discipline. Poor
understanding of these fundamental concepts, therefore, has
tremendous implications for the conceptual learning of
numerous concepts in the temporal chemistry curriculum.
The teachers' reflection combined with observation of a
couple of chemistry lessons revealed atomic model to be a
problematic area where students lacked depth and breadth of
understanding. They often confused the definition of the
"atomic number" with the definition of "mass number" and
position of the atomic particles and their characteristics with
each other (e.g., associating positivity with electron and neg-
ativity with proton, locating proton in the orbit, and associat-
ing electron with nucleus). In normal learning setting (like in
schools in Gilgit-Baltistan), students do not have the facility
to do experimentation or physically observe phenomena to
verify the information and ideas presented to them about the
concept through textbook or teacher's lecture. Usually anal-
ogies, models, diagrams, and imageries are used in the text-
books and by the teachers to help facilitate the learning about
atomic model and its allied concepts. These strategies are
important and effective on their own right; however, they
may not provide sufficient conditions to help develop con-
ceptual understanding of the topic. This necessities an ongo-
ing quest for instructional strategies and resources to
effectively deal with the challenge of teaching atomic model
and its allied concepts in the context of chemistry classroom.
The federal government has provided computers in many
high schools under the national computer literacy program.
Teachers in these schools can use computer simulation to
help students better comprehend basic abstract scientific
ideas related to atomic structure.
In the above Example II, the difficulty lied in students'
poor understanding of the primary knowledge in the back-
ground of the formation of ionic compounds or bonding rela-
tionship between and among elements. They have already
been introduced to the "law of definite proportion" in chem-
istry, but they were unable to apply it to the situation at hand:
formation of the ionic compound CaCl
2.
Students thought
that in the CaCl
2
, Ca+2 combined with 2Cl-1; the misconcep-
tion lied in the fact that Cl-1 + Cl-1 = 2Cl-1 instead of con-
ceiving it as Cl-1 + Cl-1= Cl-2 (Cl
2
: molecule of chlorine with
two negative charges). Students were confused that why
Ca+2 + (Cl-1 + Cl-1) is written as CaCl
2
why not 2CaCl. This
misconception must have different origins. The teacher
believes that, may be thinking in a linear way, the students
applied the rule of algebra, in which, x-1 + x-1 can be written
as 2x-1, so why Cl-1 + Cl-1 should not be written as 2Cl-1.
The teacher's remedial efforts appeared to be rigorous
enough to help students overcome the conceptual confusion
they harbored and bridge the knowledge gap. The teacher
verbally as well as diagrammatically explained the law of
definite proportion and showed on the chalkboard how it
applied to the example at hand. He explained that Ca carried
two plus charges (Ca+2), whereas Cl carried one minus
charge. So to form ionic bond between Ca and Cl, two atoms
of Cl were required. The total charge on Cl molecule taking
part in the reaction would be -2, and the number of chlorine
atoms in the chemical formula of the ionic compound would
be represented by Cl
2
instead of 2Cl, which has an entirely
different meaning in the context of balancing chemical
equations.
In the example at hand (2H
2
+ O
2
= 2H
2
O), students were
required to balance the chemical equation and explained the
10 SAGE Open
process (what was done and why?). Presumably, the students
who were reluctant to raise their hand might have had diffi-
culty in recalling the information. For some students, it was
difficult to symbolically represent (H
2
+ O
2
= H
2
O) the state-
ment about formation of the water molecule. Other students
were able to answer the question; nevertheless, they legged
behind in demonstrating yet another level of knowledge of
the topic, balancing the equation (2H
2
+ O
2
= 2H
2
O). Fewer
students even demonstrated the knowledge about balancing
chemical equation (probably out of memory, not out of
understanding), but they failed to explain why they added 2
with H on the left-hand side and 2 with the product on the
right-hand side of the equation. In other words, they were
unable to physically explain the phenomenon.
The conceptual hurdles students are faced with in learn-
ing subject-matter knowledge, such as balancing chemical
equation, do not exist in isolation; rather, they are interlinked
in complex ways. This implies that "understanding" concept
such as chemical equation is a multilayered and dynamic
phenomenon. As seen in the above example, student's recall-
ing or constructing equation of the formation of water mol-
ecule does not necessarily amount to confirmation of their
learning the concept with understanding. A clear trend is
reflected in this example, in which, as the concept grows
complex, students' responses decrease sharply. This exem-
plifies the multilayered and dynamic natures of the notion of
in-depth learning of scientific concepts.
These various facts explain the complexity of the situa-
tion teachers are faced with in dealing with the situations
such as assessing students' prior knowledge of the subject
matter, catering to or dealing with individuals' level of
understanding or learning needs and thereby achieving uni-
formity in students' level of understanding of the topic.
The mediocre culture that prevails in science classroom in
public and private schools in Gilgit-Baltistan may be attrib-
uted to the challenges faced at multiple levels ranging from
lack of educational resources (laboratory equipment and
library resources) to poorly qualified or untrained teachers to
teach science subjects. Students studying science course in
secondary schools in Gilgit-Baltistan are ill prepared to pur-
sue higher studies in science. The study has provided insight
into some of the common factors that contribute toward the
invariable decline in the quality of science education
imparted in schools in Gilgit-Baltistan. Various social fac-
tors, contextual or cultural factors, and academic factors
combine to affect students' attitude, their ability to engage
in science learning, and their achievement. Science curricu-
lum cannot be developed and implemented in isolation.
Development and implementation of curriculum need to take
into account social structures and economic conditions of the
local context into account.
Conclusions and Implications
The main learning objectives emphasized in the chemistry
curriculum not only stress the need for students to learn and
master primary concepts of chemistry but also undergo intel-
lectual development as scientifically literate citizen. These
objectives can only be achieved if students gain conceptual
understanding in science knowledge. Not a single factor
contributes to conceptual learning but it occurs within a
milieu which in turn is a result of interplay of multiple fac-
tors ranging from curriculum to teachers'ability to structural
and human resources. Efforts toward promoting conceptual
learning in science classroom or development of students'
cognitive skills need to be informed by the knowledge and
understanding contributed by different genre of research
such as a cognitive psychology, social psychology, and atti-
tudinal and intervention-based research. It is now well estab-
lished that what an individual learns is as a result of the
learner's actively relating what is already known to what is
being taught or experienced.
The anecdotal evidence from the research participants'
teaching context presented and discussed above exemplify
the challenges and the common conceptual difficulties stu-
dents usually face in learning subject matter in chemistry
classroom in high schools in Gilgit-Baltistan. It appears that
in the context of each situation presented above, the crux of
the matter lied in the poor background knowledge students
brought to the learning situation. It is evident from the above
examples that students of Grades 9 and 10 (age level 15-16)
failed to demonstrate very basic understanding of chemistry
concepts. Fundamentally, the challenges seem to arise from
students' poor subject knowledge background, which appar-
ently is the consequence of the poor teaching, inadequate
academic support and guidance, and insufficient individual
attention they received from their environment (subject
teacher, school, parents, and peers). Lacking essential knowl-
edge of the primary chemistry concepts, which needed to be
learnt and mustered at lower secondary levels, students
seemed confused despite teacher's good efforts to communi-
cate the concept using a variety of simple examples and
explanations. This suggests that until and unless students
bring a good understanding of the very basic concepts to the
learning situation, they may not be able to cope with the
advanced level knowledge. This underscores the critical
importance of students' learning basic science concepts in
the early stages with understanding.
The insights offered and the concerns raised in the article
seem to have important implications for understanding class-
room realties (imperatives and impediments of in-depth stu-
dent learning) in Pakistan in general and in Gilgit-Baltistan
in particular. Specifically, the implications of the results of
this study can be seen and explained in the context of schools,
teachers, and other educational stakeholders.
Students' learning of subject matter with deeper under-
standing may not take place in the classroom in an isolated
fashion. In-depth leaning is closely connected with various
conditions inside and outside the classroom. This calls for
synchronization and integration of efforts on the part of
school. Schools need to create situations where teachers are
encouraged to reflect on their own practices and engage in
Ali 11
efforts to improve their general as well as subject-based ped-
agogical skills. The high demands of conceptual learning
require chemistry teachers to letting go of transmission-ori-
ented practices; they need to carefully prepare lesson plans,
student worksheets, assignments, and assessment tasks to be
able to think about and convey the subject matter in different
ways.
Recognition of the teacher's vital facilitative role in in-
depth student learning necessitates equipment of teacher
with professional competencies (knowledge, skills, and dis-
position). Unfortunately, most traditional pre- and in-service
teacher training program in Pakistani context do not provide
necessary conditions to help inculcate and nurture these criti-
cal professional qualities in teachers. This entails a new
vision of education and professional growth for teacher com-
patible with a vision of pedagogy. So the efforts in the con-
textofreformingscienceteachereducationinGilgit-Baltistan
as well as in the country need to be geared toward "pedagogy
of understanding" (Perkins, 1993) to help science teachers
acquire the requisite knowledge and skills. The "pedagogy
of understanding" may be explained in terms of teachers
knowing about creative ways of promoting in-depth student
learning. Teachers need to make instructional selections
from among an array of choices comprising teaching meth-
ods and models, teaching acts and instructional strategies
such as practical work, interactions through group work or
pair work, presentations, whole class discussion, application
of knowledge, use of creative motivational techniques, ques-
tioning, and applying problem solving or inquiry-oriented
instructional strategies. It is only thorough these action, the
goals of National Curriculum can be realized.
All of the above would require schools to recognize the
vital importance of long-term planning, preparation, and
well-structured and well-thought strategies instead of
depending on incidental measures to deal with the difficul-
ties arising from teachers' inability to promote in-depth stu-
dent learning in such important curriculum subjects as
chemistry. Most of the high schools in Gilgit-Baltistan enroll
students from Nursery to Grade 10. Science course is an inte-
gral part of school curriculum. The schools need to pay heed
to the fact that the way science course is taught in schools is
not helpful at all to nurture scientific thinking and develop a
strong base for advance studies in science. Schools need to
take all possible measures to create an environment in pri-
mary science classroom where teachers and students engage
in activities that help them enhance their cognitive skills and
develop mastery of primary science concepts. Students tran-
siting to upper grades with adequate knowledge base and
cognitive skills can easily cope with the demands of the mid-
dle or secondary science curriculum. Moreover, schools,
teachers, district education department, and the authorities
(examinations boards) need to work together to help evolve
an examination system that gives importance to learning and
cognitive development instead of the traditional emphasis on
syllabus coverage, which has become almost a necessary
evil. Teachers and schools need a certain degree of freedom
in making decisions with regard to syllabus coverage and
preparing students for internal and external test/exams.
Finally, lessons learnt in this study have important impli-
cations for all key stakeholders, including teachers, adminis-
trators, students, parents, practitioners, and policy makers.
Improvement in science education in schools may not be
achieved in schools, in general, and in government schools,
in particular, without concerted and consistent efforts on the
part of the above key stakeholders.
