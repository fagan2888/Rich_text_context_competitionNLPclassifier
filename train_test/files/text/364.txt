Air Pollution and
Hospital
Admissions for
Respiratory
Causes in Minneapolis^St. Paul and Birmingham
Suresh H. Moolgavkar,1 E. Georg Luebeck,1 and Elizabeth L. Anderson2
We investigated the association between air pollution and
hospital admissions for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and pneumonia among the elderly in Minneapolis-St. Paul,
MN, and Birmingham, AL, over the period January 1, 1986, to
December 31, 1991. Pollutants inciuded in our analyses were
PM10 (particulate matter less than 10 jjlui in aerodynamic
diameter), SOz, NOz, 03, and CO in Minneapolis-St. Paul,
and PMl0, 03, and CO in Birmingham. After adjusting for
temperature, day of week, season, and temporal trends, we
found little evidence of association between air pollution and
hospital admissions for respiratory causes in Birmingham. In
contrast, we found that air pollution was associated with hos?
pital admissions for respiratory causes in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
Among the individual pollutants, 03 was most strongly asso?
ciated with admissions (estimated increase in hospital admis?
sions associated with a 15-parts-per-billion increase in 03 on
the previous day = 5.15%; 95% confidence interval = 2.36-
7.94%), and this association was robust in the sense that it was
little affected by the simultaneous consideration of other pol?
lutants. PM10,S02, and N02 were also associated with hospital
admissions, although none could be singled out as being more
important than the others. (Epidemiology 1997;8:364-370)
Keywords: generalized additive models, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide, particulate matter, sulfur dioxide, ozone.
A number of epidemiologic studies over the past decade
have reported associations between air pollution and
human health effects, including mortality1-5 and hospital
admissions for respiratory6-9 and cardiovascular diseas?
es.10 Unfortunately, most of these studies were not de?
signed to evaluate the role of air pollution in human
health. Rather, attention was focused on the particulate
component of air pollution, with (usually) one other
pollutant considered as a possible confounder. In studies
of daily mortality, S02 was most often considered as a
confounder.1,5 Studies of hospital admissions generally
considered particulates and ozone.6,7
In previous publications11,12 on the association be?
tween air pollution and mortality, we have argued that
air pollution is a complex mixture and that the currently
available regression techniques cannot isolate the effects
of individual components of this mixture. In this con?
text, results of regression analyses that consider only a
few of the criteria pollutants are even more difficult to
interpret because the possibility of confounding by the
omitted pollutants cannot be ruled out.

In this study, we undertook analyses of air pollution
and daily hospital admissions for respiratory causes in
the cities of Birmingham, AL, and Minneapolis-St. Paul,
MN, during the period 1986-1991. Earlier analyses6,7 in
these cities had considered hospital admissions for the
4-year period 1986-1989 and investigated associations
between particulates (PM10, particulate matter less than
10 jjim in aerodynamic diameter) and ozone and hospital
admissions for respiratory causes. Our analyses extended
the data to 6 years and included all of the criteria
pollutants for which data were available.
Methods
The U.S. Health Care Financing Administration
(HCFA) maintains records of admissions from all hos?
pitals for persons age 65 years and older. These records
contain the date of admission and the discharge diagno?
sis, coded according to the International Classification of
Diseases, 9th revision (ICD-9). We obtained informa?
tion on the daily number of hospital admissions for
pneumonia (ICD-9, 480-487) and chronic obstructive
pulmonary disease (COPD, ICD-9, 490-496) among
individuals 65 years and older in the Birmingham and
Minneapolis-St. Paul standardized metropolitan statisti?
cal areas during the period January 1, 1986, to December
31, 1991, from HCFA.
We obtained air pollution data from the Aerometric
Retrieval Service of the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency. We used the averages of the daily readings from
all of the monitoring stations in our analyses. Measure?
ments on all of the criteria pollutants (PM10, S02, NOz,
03, CO) were available in Minneapolis-St. Paul over the

was available for every day of the study period. Readings
for PM10 were available for 1,979 (90.3%) of the 2,191
days, and NOz concentrations were available for 2,185
days (99.7%). Data on N02 were not available in Bir?
mingham; readings for PM10 and CO were available for
2,098 (95.8%) and 2,191 (100%) days, respectively.
Ozone was not measured during the winter months, and
readings were available for 1,652 (75.4%) days. Sulfur
dioxide readings were available only for 1,307 (59.7%)
days. During the period April 2, 1987, to December 31,
1989, with the exception of a few days, S02 data were
not available.
We obtained information on daily temperatures from
the weather stations at the airports for the two cities.
Table 1 shows the distribution of the hospital admis?
sions, air pollution, and weather data in Minneapolis-St.
Paul and Birmingham. Table 2 shows the correlations
among the pollution and weather variables.
Methods of Analysis
We used a series of semiparametric Poisson regression
models (generalized additive models) for analyses of the
data.13 All models inciuded an intercept term, indicator
variables for day of week and for season (defined as
follows: winter of a given year was December of that year
and January and February of the next year; spring was
March, April, and May; summer was June, July, and
August; fall was September, October, and November),
nonparametric smoothers for temperature and day of
study (the latter to adjust for temporal trends and vari?
ations in hospital admissions not attributable to pollu?
tion or weather), and one or more of the pollution
variables. In the "basic" model, with which we began the
analyses, temporal trends were adjusted by a 20 degree of
freedom smoothing spline. To investigate the impact of
smoothing on the estimates of pollutant effects, we then
increased the degree of smoothing. We used the Akaike
Information Criterion (AIC) to comoare models.13 The
TABLE 2. Correlation among Pollutants and Temperature in Minneapolis*St.
Paul and Birmingham
AIC is the sum of the residual devi-
ance and twice the number of degrees
of freedom used up in fitting the model
to the data; it can be thought of as the
deviance with a penalty term added to
take account of the number of param?
eters in the model. In a comparison of
two models, the model with the
smaller AIC is preferred.
We first undertook a limited explo-
ration of the lag between exposure to a
pollutant and hospital admissions.
Specifically, we examined lags of 0, 1,
2, and 3 days for each of the pollutants
and picked the lag that yielded the
strongest association with respiratory
admissions, although this lag was not
366 MOOLGAVKAR ET AL Epidemiology July 1997, Volume 8 Number 4
necessarily the lag that minimized the AIC. We then
considered models with various combinations of pollut?
ants using that lag structure for each poiiutant. We also
investigated the lag structure for temperature. We found
that a strong association between mean daily tempera?
ture and respiratory admissions persisted even with a lag
of 10 days. Here, we present results of analyses in which
we controlled for temperature by using a smoother with
10 degrees of freedom either for the current-day mean or
for a 7-day running average. Finally, with all covariates
in the model, we examined the effect of using smoothers
with varying degrees of freedom for day of study to
control for temporal trends in hospital admissions. We
found that the AIC decreased with increased smoothing
of temporal trends until it reached a minimum and
reversed trend to increase again. Thus, by the AIC, there
is an optimal degree of smoothing for temporal trends.
All models were fit using the statistical software pack-
age S-PLUS.
Results
Table 1 shows the distributions of hospital admissions,
daily mean temperature, and pollutants in Minneapolis-
St. Paul and Birmingham, respectively. The pollutants
in both cities were moderately correlated (Table 2). We
present the results of analyses with the lag structure for
individual pollutants that maximized the effect of that
poiiutant. Unless otherwise stated, all results are pre?
sented for the total of COPD and pneumonia admis?
sions, which we call total respiratory admissions. We
considered total respiratory admissions to increase the
daily number of hospital admissions. We also analyzed
COPD and pneumonia admissions separately (see Dis?
cussion). For total respiratory admissions in Minneapo?
lis-St. Paul, the lag structure that maximized the associ?
ation was 1 day for PM10, ozone, and NOz, and 2 days for
S02. Carbon monoxide showed only weak and incon?
sistent associations with total respiratory admissions. In
Birmingham, we did not consider S02 because of the
large number of days with missing information. Carbon
monoxide showed a weak association with total respira?
tory hospital admissions. Since the focus of previous
analyses was PM10 and ozone, we present the results of
these analyses in detail. Both PM10 and ozone showed
generally inconsistent associations with hospital admis?
sions, with the coefficients either positive or negative
depending upon the lag chosen (Table 3). The strongest
positive association of ozone with hospital admissions
was found with a lag of 2 days. For PM10, the strongest
association was seen with a lag of 0 days, that is, with
concentrations of PM10 on the same day.
In both datasets, day of week, season, and temperature
were strongly associated with hospital admissions for
respiratory disease. In both cities, admissions were high?
est in winter and lowest in summer after controlling for
the other covariates. Temperature was associated with
hospital admissions even with lag times on the order of
10 days. In our analyses, we considered either a 7-day
running average or the mean temperature on the same

day. In both cases, the effect of temperature was modeled
nonparametrically using a 10 degree of freedom smooth?
ing spline. In Minneapolis, we found that the 7-day
running average of temperature was more strongly asso?
ciated with hospital admissions than the same-day mean
temperature. The opposite was true in Birmingham.
There are likely to be temporal trends in hospital
admissions not related to the covariates considered in
the regression models. In previous analyses, we have
controlled for these by considering the seasons sepa?
rately and by using indicator variables for year. Because
of the rather small datasets (only 6 years of observation
in each city) analyzed here, we focused our efforts on
analyzing the entire time series in each city. We used
nonparametric smoothers to control for temporal trends
in hospital admissions. We used the AIC as an explor-
atory tool to investigate what degree of smoothing best
described the data. We found, in both datasets, that the
AIC decreased with increasing smoothing to a minimal
value. Further smoothing increased the AIC, suggesting
that, for each dataset, there was an optimal level of
smoothing. For the Minneapolis dataset, this optimum
appeared to be at approximately 130 degrees of freedom
for a smoothing spline. For the Birmingham data, the
optimum appeared to be at approximately 60 degrees of
freedom for a smoothing spline. These procedures are
roughly equivalent to using 17-day and 3 7-day running
average filters on the hospital admissions in Minneapolis
and Birmingham, respectively.
Estimates of the association between air pollutants
and hospital admissions for respiratory causes are shown
in Figures 1-3 and in Tables 3 and 4. We initially
conducted analyses with the basic model (defined
above). In Minneapolis (Figures 1 and 2; Table 4), each
of the pollutants, with the exception of CO, was asso?
ciated with total respiratory hospital admissions when
considered alone in the basic regression model. The
estimated effect for each pollutant, reported as the per?
centage change in hospital admissions associated with
an increase in pollutant level approximately equal to the
interquartile range (20 /xg per m3 for PM10, 15 parts per
billion for 03, 10 parts per billion for NOz, and 3.5 parts
per billion for S02) were as follows: PM10

Here PM10
? 1 indicates that this estimate is for a lag of
1 day, etc. Carbon monoxide showed inconsistent asso?
ciations with hospital admissions for COPD and pneu?
monia combined, with the coefficients either positive or
negative, depending upon the lag structure used. We
found, however, that CO was associated with hospital
admissions for COPD alone (see Discussion). When we
considered PM10 and ozone together in the regression
model, both continued to be strongly associated with
hospital admissions, with the coefficient of each atten-
uated somewhat (Figure 1). When the four pollutants
PM10, S02, ozone, and N02 were considered simulta?
neously in the regression models, the association of
ozone with respiratory admissions was the strongest (Fig?
ure 2). With increased smoothing, the pollution effects
were somewhat attenuated, as would be expected. The
AIC decreased with increasing smoothing until it
reached a minimum at approximately 130 degrees of
freedom for the smoothing spline (Figure 2). Among
PM10, S02, and NOz, it was not possible to single out
one as being more important than the others. Although
the degree of smoothing affected the estimates of effects
associated with the pollutants, it did not affect the
relative importance of the pollutants. With the optimal
degree of smoothing as judged by the AIC, ozone was
still strongly associated with hospital admissions.
In Birmingham, neither PM10 nor ozone showed con?
sistent associations with hospital admissions for respira-
tory causes (Table 3). The estimated coefficients (log of
the relative risks) for these pollutants were either posi?
tive or negative depending upon the lag structure used in
the regression models. The coefficient for CO, although
small, was positive for the lag structures investigated.
Positive associations of hospital admissions with PM10
and with ozone were seen with lags of 0 and 2 days,
respectively. Results of analyses with both pollutants
inciuded with these lag structures are shown in Figure 3.
As indicated above, the mean of the current-day tem?
perature was more strongly associated with hospital ad?
missions in Birmingham than the 7-day running average
and also described the data better as judged by the AIC
(AIC = 1,717 for model with 7-day running average;
AIC = 1,708 for model with same-day mean tempera?
ture; models include both pollutants).
Discussion
In previous analyses of time series data on daily mortal?
ity, we have advocated separate analyses by season. In-
deed, we have reported that seasonal factors modify the
effect of pollution on mortality. We would have liked to
investigate effect modification by season in this study as
well. The short time series and the small number of daily
admissions for respiratory diseases made this infeasible,
however. As we accumulate more years of data, season-
specific analyses should become possible.
Previous analyses of respiratory admissions in Minne?
apolis6 and Birmingham7 concluded that PM10 was
strongly associated with admissions for both COPD and
pneumonia in both cities. Ozone was reported to be
weakly associated with pneumonia admissions in Min?
neapolis and with both pneumonia and COPD admis?
sions in Birmingham. Our analyses in this paper with 2
more years of data and consideration of other pollutants
did not confirm these results. In Minneapolis, we found
a strong and consistent association of ozone with total
daily respiratory admissions. Although PM10 was strongly
associated with respiratory admissions when considered
as the only pollutant in regression models, its effect was
greatly attenuated when ozone, N02, and S02 were
simultaneously considered, as can be seen by comparing
Figures 1 and 2. With a 20 degree of freedom smoothing
spline for temporal trends, the estimated increase in
hospital admissions associated with a 20-u,g per m3 in?
crease in PM10 dropped from about 3% to about 2%.
With more smoothing of temporal trends, this estimate
was further attenuated until it stabilized at about 1%
(Figure 2, second, third, and fourth panels). Ozone con-
tinued to be strongly associated with respiratory admis?
sions. Among PM10, N02, and S02, however, no single
pollutant stood out as being more important than the
others. In Birmingham, we could detect no consistent
association of any of the available pollutants with hos?
pital admissions for respiratory diseases. Unfortunately,
data on N02 levels were not available, and the informa?
tion on S02 had a large missing chunk. Therefore, we
were unable to investigate the effects of these pollutants.

FIGURE 2. Effect of smoothing of temporal trends on parameter estimates and confidence intervals in Minneapolis-St. Paul.
The degree of smoothing of temporal trends and the resulting AIC for the model are given in each panel. AH pollutants were
simultaneously entered into the models, which contained, in addition, an intercept term, indicators for day of week and season,
and a spline smoother for temporal trends with different degrees of freedom. PM10, 03, and N02 were considered with lags of
1 day, and S02 was considered with a lag of 2 days. Note the lower AIC with increased smoothing of temporal trends. As
throughout this paper, all estimates are for concentration changes equal to the interquartile ranges, which are shown on the

are summarized in a recent review.14 Most studies have
reported positive associations between levels of particu?
late matter and hospital admissions with various lag
times. The interpretation of these studies is limited,
however, by the fact that they have considered at most
one other pollutant along with the particulates. More?
over, these studies did not explore the sensitivity of the
results to various methods of adjusting temporal trends.
Our analyses suggest that the procedure used for adjust?
ing temporal trend could have substantial impact on the
conclusions.
We have used the AIC as an exploratory tool in this
paper. We are not suggesting that AIC be used to choose
among models when other information is available. Ide-
ally, biological plausibility should play an important role
in the choice of a model. Unfortunately, however, there
is little biology to guide us in the choice, for example, of
the optimal degree of smoothing for analyses of time
series in air pollution epidemiology. Even if one had a
prior hypothesis based loosely on biological consider-
ations, how could one justify rejection of a model that
described the data better as judged by an objective
criterion? As pointed out above, our choice of smoothers
for temporal trends corresponds roughly to using a 17-
day running average filter in Minneapolis and a 3 7-day
running average filter in Birmingham. Similar filters
have been used in the past in the analyses of air pollu?
tion data- In both Minneapolis and Birmingham, the
AIC indicated that there was an optimal degree of
smoothing of temporal trends. Smoothing beyond this
point led to models that had a worse fit as judged by the
AIC. Second, although there was some attenuation of
the air pollution effects with increased smoothing, these
effects were not wiped out. In particular, the effect of
ozone on hospital admissions in Minneapolis was re-
markably robust.
In Minneapolis, we explored as well the effect of air
pollution on COPD and pneumonia admissions sepa?
rately. Table 3 shows the estimated associations between
the pollutants and these diseases while controlling for
season, temperature, and day of week. For COPD and
pneumonia, optimal smoothing of temporal trends oc?
curred with 100 and 130 degree of freedom smoothers,
respectively. S02 and N02 appeared to have little asso?
ciation with admissions for COPD; CO appeared to have
little association with admissions for pneumonia. The
most striking association was that of ozone with admis?
sions for pneumonia. No other single poiiutant stood
out.

with both pollutants considered simultaneously. In the left panel, temperature is controlled by using a smoothing spline for the
7-day running average. The optimal smoother for temporal trends in this case was a 50 degree of freedom smoothing spline.
In the right panel, temperature is controlled by a smoothing spline for same-day mean temperature. The optimal smoother for

same-day mean temperature is used in the regression model.
In Birmingham, we could not detect an association
between air pollution and hospital admissions. In fact,
by the AIC, a regression model incorporating day of
week, season, a 60 degree of freedom smoother for
trends, and same-day mean temperature described the
admissions data better (AIC = 1,699) than the identical

cluded (AIC = 1,703). Moreover, the
associations of the pollutants with re?
spiratory admissions were not consis?
tent, being either positive or negative
depending upon the lag chosen (Table
3). We obtained similar results when
admissions for pneumonia and COPD
were each analyzed separately. Because
the original analyses7 of hospital ad?
missions in Birmingham were carried
out with 4 years of data (1986-1989),
we repeated our analyses with the data
restricted to these 4 years. We consid?
ered total daily respiratory admissions
in Birmingham and fitted models that
inciuded an intercept term, indicator
variables for day of week and season,
spline smoothers for same-day mean
temperature and for temporal trends,
and one or more pollution covariates.
We found that a 30 degree of freedom
smoother best described the data. We
considered PM10 with a lag of 0 and
ozone with a lag of 2. With these lag
370 MOOLGAVKAR ET AL Epidemiology July 1997, Volume 8 Number 4
structures, and with each poiiutant considered individ-
ually in the model, the estimated increase in respiratory
admissions for an increase of 30 /xg per m3 (interquartile
range) in PM10 on the same day was 2.2% (95% CL =
?0.3%, 4-7%)- For an increase of 15 parts per billion
ozone (interquartile range) 2 days before admission, the
estimated increase was 0.27% (95% CL = -0.2%,
0.74%)- With both pollutants in the model, the estimate
for ozone remained unchanged (0.27%; 95% CL =
-0.2%, 0.74%), whereas the estimate for PM10 de?
creased (0.9%; 95% CL = -2.4%, 4.2%). We note,
however, that the analysis with PM10 alone in the model
was based on virtually the entire 4-year series (there are
few days with missing PM10 data), whereas the analyses
for ozone and both pollutants together were based on
many fewer days because ozone readings were not avail?
able in winter.
Our findings in Minneapolis are in general agreement
with the conclusions of an earlier analysis.6 We found an
association between air pollution and hospital admis?
sions after adjusting for weather and temporal trends.
Both ozone and PM10 were associated with admissions
when considered individually or together. We found, in
contrast to the earlier analysis, however, that the effect
of ozone was stronger than the effect of PM10. Moreover,
the ozone effect was robust, whereas the effect of PM10
was greatly attenuated when S02 and N02, which were
not considered in the earlier analysis,6 were entered in
the regression together with PM10 and ozone. In Bir?
mingham, we were unable to find an association be?
tween air pollution and hospital admissions, as reported
in a previous study.7 There could be several explana-
tions. First, we analyzed 2 more years of data; when we
restricted analyses to the 4 years of data considered in
the original analysis, we found a weak association with a
lag of 0 for PM10 and a lag of 2 days for ozone. With
different lag structures, however, the estimated coeffi?
cients were negative. We controlled for temperature and
temporal trends differently from the original analysis,
and a second possibility is that the results are sensitive to
the form in which these covariates are entered into the
model.
In conclusion, there was clearly an association be?
tween air pollution and daily hospital admissions for
respiratory diseases in Minneapolis-St. Paul. Of the pol?
lutants considered, ozone was strongly associated with
daily hospital admissions, and this association was robust
in the sense that it persisted with other pollutants in the
model and was relatively little affected by the degree of
smoothing used to control for temporal trends. Although
PM10, S02, and N02 were positively associated with
hospital admissions, no single one of this group of pol?
lutants stands out as being more important than the
others. Our analyses in Minneapolis showed positive
associations between individual pollutants and hospital
admissions in regression models, even with multiple
pollutants in the model and when concentrations of
some pollutants (for example, S02) were quite low. The
appropriate interpretation of this finding is that daily
fluctuations in the concentration of the pollutant re-
flected fluctuations in the air pollution complex associ?
ated with hospital admissions. In contrast to findings in
Minneapolis, there was no clear indication of an associ?
ation of air pollution with hospital admissions in Bir?
mingham in the 6 years of data we examined.
Driven largely by the regulatory imperative, air pol?
lution research has focused on single pollutants. This
research has often been opportunistic because the avail?
able data, which have been collected for regulatory
purposes, are inadequate to address many issues that arise
in a research setting. It seems clear, however, on patho-
physiologic grounds, that the component constituents of
air pollution could not act independently of each other
and of weather. The recent Health Effects Institute
study15 of air pollution and daily mortality in Philadel?
phia found evidence of the interaction of individual
pollutants with each other and with weather and season.
If we are to make further progress in this important area
of science, the focus must shift from individual pollut?
ants to the consideration of air pollution as a complex
mixture.
