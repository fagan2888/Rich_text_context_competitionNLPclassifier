Effects of Humor Production, Humor
Receptivity, and Physical Attractiveness
on Partner Desirability
Michelle Tornquist1 and Dan Chiappe1
Abstract
This study examined women's and men's preferences for humor production and humor receptivity in long-term and short-term
relationships, and how these factors interact with physical attractiveness to influence desirability. Undergraduates viewed
photographs of the opposite sex individuals who were high or low in physical attractiveness, along with vignettes varying in humor
production and receptivity. Participants rated physical attractiveness and desirability for long-term and short-term relationships.
The main findings were that individuals desired partners who were high in humor production and receptivity, though the effects
were particularly pronounced for women judging long-term relationships. Moreover, humor production was more important
than receptivity for women's ratings of male desirability. Notably, we also found that ratings of physical attractiveness were
influenced by the humor conditions. These results are discussed in terms of the fitness indicator, interest indicator, and
encryption hypotheses of the evolutionary functions of humor.

Introduction
Much research in evolutionary psychology has examined the
role humor plays in mate selection (e.g., Kuhle, 2012; Lundy,
Tan, & Cunningham, 1998; McGee & Shevlin, 2009; Wilbur &
Campbell, 2011). The evolutionary function of humor in mat-
ing, however, remains unresolved and several hypotheses have
been offered (Kuhle, 2012). One hypothesis maintains that
humor functions primarily as an indicator of fitness because
it relies on mechanisms underlying human intellectual and
creative ability (Bressler, Martin, & Balshine, 2006; Hone,
Hurwitz, & Lieberman, 2015; Miller, 2000). Another holds that
humor is used to communicate that a person is interested in
initiating or maintaining a romantic relationship, and it is used
when a person is attracted to an individual and is not a cause of
the attraction (Cowan & Little, 2013; Li et al., 2009). A third
view claims that because humor encrypts a lot of background
information, it can be used to assess the compatibility of indi-
viduals (e.g., sharing values and cultural knowledge), a factor
relevant not just in romantic relationships but in all types of
social bonding and collaboration (Curry & Dunbar, 2013;
Flamson & Barrett, 2008). The present study tests these views
by examining male and female preferences for humor produc-
tion and receptivity in short-term and long-term partners, and
how these factors interact with physical attractiveness to deter-
mine desirability.
Humor as an Indicator of Genetic Quality
Miller (2000; Miller & Todd, 1998) proposed that humor is
used as a way of identifying mates with high-quality heritable
psychological traits. This is because in this view, humor
requires intelligence, verbal skills, and the ability to creatively
combine linguistic symbols (Miller & Todd, 1998). Because
approximately one third of human genes are expressed in the
brain, displays of humor offer a reliable indication of the

quality of those genes (Miller, 2000). Humor can therefore be
used in courtship as a hard-to-fake signal of heritable psycho-
logical fitness. In support of this claim, Howrigan and MacDo-
nald (2008) found that general intelligence predicted ratings of
humor and did so independently of personality characteristics.
It is important to keep in mind, however, that the relationship
between humor and intelligence is likely to depend on how
these concepts are defined, including the types of humor, as
Galloway's (1994) review examining the connection between
these variables uncovered conflicting results.
The fitness indicator hypothesis also holds that humor pro-
duction may be more important for female mating decisions
(Bressler et al., 2006; Kuhle, 2012). This is because women are
generally choosier due to the greater minimal investment they
make in reproduction compared to men (Trivers, 1972). Men
need to advertise their physical and psychological traits to
prove their worth to women, and women need to be capable
of identifying high-quality men. In this view, then, men should
be the predominant displayers of humor and women should be
the predominant appreciators of humor.
Consistent with the fitness indicator theory, studies carried
out over the last decade have found that although both men and
women value a sense of humor in a romantic partner, they mean
very different things (e.g., Bressler et al., 2006; Hone et al.,
2015; Wilbur & Campbell, 2011). Women primarily refer to
men's abilities to produce jokes that make them laugh (i.e.,
humor producers), while men refer to women's tendencies to
appreciate and laugh at the humor they produce (i.e., humor
receptivity). For example, Bressler, Martin, and Balshine
(2006) showed that although humor receptivity was rated as
desirable by both genders, the ability to produce humor by a
partner was rated more desirable by women than men. More-
over, when the task required them to choose between a partner
that was high in humor production and low in humor receptiv-
ity or low in humor production and high in humor receptivity,
women tended to choose the former and men the latter. These
gender differences were particularly evident in the context of
dating and long-term relationships but not one-night stands or
short-term relationships. Hone, Hurwitz, and Lieberman (2015)
replicated these findings, and using a trait purchasing task also
showed that for women humor production is a necessity, while
humor receptivity is a luxury. For men, the opposite is the case.
Wilbur and Campbell (2011) also tested the fitness indicator
hypothesis by asking college students about what humor strat-
egy they would be more likely to use when getting to know a
romantic partner. They found that men reported they would use
humor production, whereas women were more likely to report
that they would use humor evaluation strategies. In another
study examining an online dating site, they found that men
were more likely to offer humor, while women were more
likely to make humor production requests. Moreover, women's
ratings of romantic interest were positively correlated with
their humor production ratings of the men, but men's ratings
were unrelated to women's humor production. For women,
ratings of humor were also positively correlated with their rat-
ings of men's intelligence and warmth.
Humor as Relationship Interest Indicator
Another account of the evolutionary function of humor in mat-
ing holds that it serves as a signal of relationship interest
(Cowan & Little, 2013; Li et al., 2009). Humor is produced
when a person (male or female) wants to initiate a romantic
relationship or is seeking to maintain an existing one. Depend-
ing on how the recipient of humor responds, the producer can
determine whether the interest is reciprocal. If the recipient
responds with genuine laughter, for example, the producer will
likely infer desire in a relationship. On the other hand, if the
recipient does not laugh, the producer will likely infer that the
person is not interested in initiating a romantic relationship, or
does not feel the same way about an existing relationship. By
conveying this information implicitly, it allows individuals to
save face, as the costs of rejection are likely to be lower than if
an explicit statement of interest is made. A key implication of
this view is that attraction precedes humor and is not the cause
of it. Humor is produced when an individual is attracted to
another person, and if the recipient is attracted to the producer,
they respond positively.
A set of experiments by Li et al. (2009) provided support for
this hypothesis. In one study, participants imagined interacting
with someone they were either attracted to or not attracted to.
They were asked to indicate how likely they would be to initi-
ate a general conversation and how likely they would be to
initiate humor. They found that men and women would be
much more likely to initiate a conversation and to initiate
humor if they were attracted to the individual than if they were
not attracted. Moreover, if attracted, they reported being more
likely to initiate humor than a general conversation. Partici-
pants also reported being much more likely to respond posi-
tively with laughter to the other person's humor if they were
attracted to them. A second study also found that humorous
statements were rated as being funnier by men and women if
the participants believed that they came from a person that they
were attracted to and wanted a relationship with, a pattern that
held for both men and women. In a third study, Li et al. (2009)
found that third-party observers watching a mock ``speed dat-
ing'' session rated males using humor as being more interested
in the female recipient than if they simply offered a general
conversation. Moreover, females that responded positively to
the humor were much more likely to be rated as interested in
the male when he produced humor than females that responded
negatively to the humor.
Cowan and Little (2013) also found that physical attractive-
ness can increase the ratings of how funny a person is. In their
study, participants were presented with audio clips on their own
and as part of a video showing a person's face. The audio clips
were responses of the person in the video to a question asking
the person which two of three objects they would bring to a
desert island, and how they would use it. Participants had to
rate how humorous the responses were. They found that for
both men and women, humor ratings for the attractive faces
increased relative to the audio-only condition, while for the less
attractive faces, humor ratings decreased relative to the
2 Evolutionary Psychology
audio-only condition. In a follow-up study, they found that
humor used to answer the questions in males and females was
positively correlated with perceived flirtatiousness, a finding
consistent with the interest indicator hypothesis.
Humor as an Encryption of Compatibility
According to the encryption hypothesis, humor functions as a
reliable signal of shared common knowledge, values, prefer-
ences, and goals (Curry & Dunbar, 2013; Flamson & Barrett,
2008). Identifying individuals similar in these respects is
important because when people choose partners for cooperative
ventures, they have to choose those with whom they are com-
patible. Humor can serve this purpose because although jokes
are explicit statements, understanding and appreciating them
often require possessing implicit knowledge, values, and atti-
tudes. After all, not everyone understands the same jokes, and
even if they do understand them, they may not find them funny.
In this view, then, people produce humor as a way of broad-
casting information about themselves, and monitoring the reac-
tions of others indicates whether they share the background
culture needed to appreciate that humor. In the context of mat-
ing, two individuals laughing at the same things can serve to
indicate that they are culturally compatible and likely to be
successful in the joint venture of raising children and building
a life together. Consistent with this claim, Murstein and Brust
(1985) found that couples with a similar sense of humor are
likelier to stay together. An important virtue of this hypothesis,
however, is that it readily explains the role of humor in various
contexts outside of mating, including friendships and other
long-term partnerships where a shared vision is crucial.
Flamson and Barrett (2008) provided evidence supporting
the encryption hypothesis. They examined whether prior famil-
iarity with the topics of jokes affects how funny people regard
them. In one experiment, they presented participants with jokes
that were either ``low encryption'' or ``high encryption'' by
manipulating whether or not information relevant to under-
standing the jokes was made explicit in the jokes themselves.
They also assessed whether or not participants had prior famil-
iarity with the topics. Their results were that participants found
jokes to be funnier when they had prior knowledge of the
topics, and those with prior knowledge preferred the highly
encrypted, less explicit, versions of the jokes. In contrast, those
with less familiarity preferred the less encrypted versions. In a
second experiment, the jokes were the same across conditions
and what was manipulated was whether or not a preceding
paragraph contained information that decrypted the joke by
providing relevant information. They found that those with
greater prior knowledge appreciated the jokes more than those
with less prior knowledge, and decrypting information
increased the appreciation of the jokes of those who were less
familiar with the topics.
More recently, Curry and Dunbar (2013) have examined
whether similarity in appreciation of humor affects people's
perceptions of whether they are likely to get along with others
and whether humor is more effective in this regard than other
indications of shared culture. Participants were presented with
either a set of jokes or a set of first lines of novels. Those
receiving jokes had to indicate whether or not they thought
they were funny, and those receiving opening lines were asked
to rate whether or not they liked them. Later on they were
presented with the profile of another (fictional) individual who
varied in terms of how similar their judgments of the jokes
were to those of the participants, or how similar their judg-
ments of the opening lines were. Participants were asked sev-
eral questions to measure the degree of affiliation they perceive
with those individuals, including how well they would get
along with them, if they would like them, whether they would
enjoy working with them, and whether they believe they have a
lot in common. In addition to measures of affiliation, they were
asked to rate the other person's intelligence, trustworthiness,
popularity, and attractiveness.
Curry and Dunbar (2013) found that as similarity
increased, so too did the affiliation scores. The type of stimu-
lus did not seem to matter, as the same effects were produced
by jokes and preferences for first lines of novels. They did
find, however, that similarity of humor predicted altruistic
responses. At the end of the study, participants were given
the option of sharing a portion of their compensation with the
other individual, and they found that shared appreciation of
humor predicted degree of altruism, while shared appreciation
of first lines did not. Also noteworthy was their finding that
although similarity in humor and first-line preferences pre-
dicted affiliation, it did not influence ratings of the person's
other characteristics, including their attractiveness. The
effects on affiliation were thus unique to cooperation and did
not influence overall the evaluations of others.
Current Study
The current study presented undergraduate students with
photographs of opposite sex individuals that were either higher
or lower in attractiveness, along with vignettes that described
their humor production and receptivity as either high or low.
For each, they rated their desirability for short-term and long-
term relationships as well as rating their physical attractive-
ness. The design allowed us to test key predictions of the fitness
indicator, interest indicator, and encryption hypotheses.
The fitness indicator hypothesis predicts that because humor
is an indicator of good genes and (more proximally) of desir-
able psychological qualities such as intelligence and creativity,
detecting the presence of humor should increase the desirability
of both physically attractive and physically unattractive indi-
viduals. Moreover, the hypothesis predicts that humor is impor-
tant for both long-term and short-term mating, as in both
contexts, people would be attracted to qualities that can be
passed onto offspring. Moreover, the hypothesis predicts that
humor production should be more important to females than
males as well as being more important to women than humor
receptivity. Finally, it predicts that humor receptivity should be
more important to men than humor production and more
important to men than to women.
Tornquist and Chiappe 3
The interest indicator hypothesis predicts that humor, espe-
cially humor production, should boost the desirability of indi-
viduals more if they are higher in attractiveness than if they are
lower in attractiveness. This is because the perception of humor
depends on whether an individual is already attracted to the
person. People should thus welcome humor more in the physi-
cally attractive than in the less attractive. Moreover, the interest
indicator hypothesis predicts that the effects of humor on desir-
ability should be equally robust in short-term and long-term
mating contexts. This is because it holds that humor serves to
indicate interest in both types of relationships, either to initiate
a relationship or to indicate interest in maintaining it. Finally,
the theory does not predict any sexually dimorphic patterns in
terms of the effects of humor production or humor receptivity.
In this view, men and women use both humor production and
humor receptivity to indicate interest in a relationship.
The encryption hypothesis predicts that humor production
and receptivity should both boost the desirability ratings of
men and women, as both offer a means of assessing the com-
patibility of potential mates. In addition, the hypothesis pre-
dicts that the effects of humor should be particularly pronounced
in long-term mating. In the case of short-term mating, assess-
ments of compatibility are not likely to be relevant, because the
individuals do not foresee engaging in activities where a great
deal of cooperation and coordination are required. Finally, the
encryption hypothesis predicts that the desirability of opposite
sex individuals should be boosted by humor production and
receptivity, regardless of the level of physical attractiveness.
Discovering that someone makes you laugh and laughs at your
offers of humor should increase feelings of affiliation toward
that person and does not depend on any preexisting attraction
to the individual based on surface characteristics.
The present study also had participants rate the physical
attractiveness of individuals in the photographs, in addition
to short-term and long-term mating desirability. This was done
to determine whether nonphysical characteristics such as
humor can influence judgments of physical attractiveness.
Although many studies have shown that physical beauty influ-
ences perceptions of psychological and social traits (e.g.,
Dion, Berscheid, & Walster, 1972), little research has exam-
ined whether characteristics such as personality, humor, or
intelligence can influence how physically attractive someone
is judged to be (Swami, 2012). Because personality and other
psychological characteristics influence the fitness value of a
person just as their physical traits do, it is possible that judg-
ments of beauty integrate both physical and nonphysical
dimensions.
In one of the few studies examining the issue, Kniffin and
Wilson (2004) had participants rate the physical attractiveness
of people in their yearbook, along with how familiar they were
with them, how likeable they were, and how much they
respected them. They also had strangers rate the photos for
physical attractiveness. As they were unfamiliar with the peo-
ple in the yearbook, the strangers made their judgments based
solely on physical characteristics. Using a stepwise regression
procedure, Kniffin and Wilson (2004) found that nonphysical
factors including liking and respecting explained variance in
ratings of physical attractiveness beyond what could be
explained by the strangers' ratings of physical attractiveness.
Moreover, women's ratings of physical attractiveness were
more strongly influenced by nonphysical factors than were
men's ratings. For the latter, a greater proportion of the var-
iance in physical attractiveness ratings was explained by the
ratings of the strangers. This is consistent with previous find-
ings that men tend to emphasize women's ability to make a
physical investment in reproduction, while women emphasize a
man's ability to provide resources for the raising of offspring
(Feingold, 1990; Smith, Waldorf, & Trembath, 1990).
Based on these considerations, the fitness indicator hypoth-
esis predicts that participants' ratings of physical attractiveness
will be influenced by information regarding humor, with those
portrayed as having a better sense of humor also being rated
more physically attractive. Moreover, it predicts that women's
ratings of male physical attractiveness should be more strongly
influenced by the humor information than men's ratings, as
women tend to weigh more heavily nonphysical characteristics
in mate selection, especially during the nonovulatory phase of
their cycle (Gangestad, Garver-Apgar, Simpson, & Cousins,
2007). In contrast, the interest indicator hypothesis does not
predict that physical attractiveness should be influenced by
information regarding sense of humor. In this view, humor is
not the cause of attraction. Instead, humor is produced when
attraction is already present. The encryption hypothesis also
does not predict that information regarding humor will affect
judgments of physical attractiveness. The reason for this is that
as Curry and Dunbar (2013) state, the effect of humor is ``spe-
cific to cooperation, and not the result of a more positive gen-
eral evaluation of the `other' person'' (p. 129). They failed to
find evidence, for example, that similarity of humor predicted
evaluations of attractiveness of the other individual.
Material and Method
Participants
One-hundred and thirteen undergraduate students (54 women
and 59 men) from California State University, Long Beach
participated. They were recruited from the Introductory Psy-
chology subject pool and received course credit. A requirement
for inclusion was that students had to identify with a hetero-
sexual orientation. Mean age was 18.7 years (range 17­24
years). Their self-reported ethnicity was 25% White, 33% His-
panic Latino, 30% Asian, 4% Black African American, 4%
Native Hawaiian Pacific Islander, and 6% other. Two women
and two men were dropped for failing to complete all parts of
the experiment. The study was approved by California State
University, Long Beach's Institutional Review Board.
Material
Humor-style vignettes. To examine men's and women's humor
preferences, we developed 24 vignettes (6 for each humor
4 Evolutionary Psychology
condition, 2 adapted from Bressler et al., 2006). Each one,
presented on a computer screen, described a unique scenario
in which the participant was approached by a stranger of the
opposite sex who initiated a friendly conversation with the
participant. They described the strangers as varying in humor
production and receptivity. In particular, they were described
as being high in humor production and low in humor receptiv-
ity (HP/LR), high in humor production and high in humor
receptivity (HP/HR), low in humor production and high in
humor receptivity (LP/HR), or low in humor production and
low in humor receptivity (LP/LR). Sample vignettes are shown
in Appendix A.
Facial stimuli. Participants were shown 24 facial photographs of
the opposite sex (11 cm wide Â 12 cm long), one photograph
for each vignette. Photographs were of individuals who varied
in age, from approximately 20 to 30 years, as well as ethnic
background. All photographs were of a person looking directly
into the camera with a neutral expression and against a white
background. A total of 24 female and 24 male faces were
selected based on their attractiveness. To obtain this set, 40
male and 40 female photographs were prerated for physical
attractiveness using an 8-point Likert-type scale (1 ¼ very
unattractive, 8 ¼ very attractive). Preratings were done by 23
individuals who did not take part in the main study (10 men and
13 women). Each person rated opposite-sex photographs. From
the 80 photographs, 12 women rated higher in attractiveness
(M ¼ 5.78, SD ¼ 1.05) and 12 men rated higher in attractive-
ness (M ¼ 5.69, SD ¼ 0.68) were selected, all receiving a mean
rating of 5 or higher. In addition, 12 women rated lower in
attractiveness (M ¼ 2.08, SD ¼ 0.90) and 12 men rated lower
in attractiveness (M ¼ 1.58, SD ¼ 0.53) were selected, all
receiving mean ratings of less than 4. The ratings of the higher
attractiveness female photos did not differ significantly from
those of the higher attractiveness males, t(21) ¼ 0.24, p ¼ .81.
The ratings of the lower attractiveness females also did not
differ from those of the lower attractiveness males, t(21) ¼
1.67, p ¼ .11. For females, however, the ratings of the more
attractive group were higher than for the less attractive group,
t(9) ¼ 9.66, p < .001. Likewise, the ratings of the more attrac-
tive males were higher than those of the less attractive males,
t(12) ¼ 24.97, p < .001.
Each photo appeared in each of the four humor conditions,
so that faces were not confounded with humor type. The photo-
graphs were retrieved from The Center for Vital Longevity
Face Database (Minear & Park, 2004), from The Beautycheck
Website (Gruendl, n.d.), and by asking people from outside the
university to take their photograph to use in a research study.
Desirability ratings. Participants rated each photographed indi-
vidual presented alongside a vignette for his or her desirability
along different dimensions, on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 ¼
very undesirable, 7 ¼ very desirable). In particular, they had to
rate ``how desirable is this person as a short-term partner?'' and
``how desirable is this person as a long-term partner?'' Short-
term and long-term relationships were defined to ensure the
same understanding of these terms among the participants
(short term: one-night stand, occasional dating; long term: boy-
friend or girlfriend, living together, marriage). In addition,
participants had to rate ``how physically attractive is this indi-
vidual?'' on a 7-point Likert-type scale (1 ¼ very unattractive,
7 ¼ very attractive).
Procedure
After reading and signing the consent form, participants com-
pleted a demographic survey that had them state their gender,
ethnicity, and age. Once completed, they were instructed that
they would have to view a number of photographs paired with a
vignette (i.e., profiles) describing a hypothetical interaction
between the participant and the individual in the photograph.
In line with the study conducted by Didonato, Bedminister, and
Machel (2013), participants were told that during the experi-
ment they should imagine themselves as a single person who is
willing to meet people and who is available for dating. They
were also told that the potential partner in the vignettes
should be regarded as available and interested in the partici-
pant. This is because prior studies have shown that partici-
pants' relationship status (Lydon, Meana, Sepinwall,
Richards, & Mayman, 1999) and the relationship status of
potential partners (Koranyi, Gast, & Rothermund, 2013) may
influence participants' judgements of partner desirability.
The participants were also instructed to listen carefully while
the experimenter read them the vignettes, which would also
be shown on the computer screen.
For each pair of photographs and vignettes, participants
rated each individual for his or her desirability as a short-
term partner, long-term partner, and physical attractiveness,
in that order. Each of the 24 trials consisted of a sequence of
four computer screens. On the first, participants saw the photo-
graph on the left-hand side, with the vignette on the right. After
the experimenters read the vignettes, participants could take
their time to review them before pressing the space bar to see
the remaining screens. On the second, participants saw the
photograph along with the question asking them to rate desir-
ability as a short-term partner. The 7-point rating scale
appeared below the question. The third and fourth screens were
the same except that they asked participants to rate the desir-
ability as a long-term partner and physical attractiveness,
respectively. Participants entered their ratings using the num-
bers on the keyboard. They advanced to the next screen auto-
matically once they entered a number.
All participants were exposed to six profiles in each of the
four humor conditions (HP/LR, LP/HR, HP/HR, and LP/LR).
Half of the profiles in each humor condition had photographs of
higher attractiveness individuals and half had photographs of
lower attractiveness individuals. Items were presented in a ran-
dom order for each participant. The experiment took up to 1 hr
to complete. Demographics, vignettes, photographs, and ques-
tions were presented to participants on a stationary computer
via E-Prime 2.0 software (Psychology Software Tools, Pitts-
burgh, PA, USA).

Results
In what follows, we examine the effects of humor production,
humor receptivity, and physical attractiveness of photographs
on participants' ratings of partner desirability using a series of
2 Â 2 Â 2 Â 2 mixed factors analyses of variance (ANOVAs).
In these analyses, gender (male/female) is between subjects
factor and humor receptivity (high/low), humor production
(high/low) and physical attractiveness (higher/lower) are the
repeated measures factors. Separate ANOVAs were carried out
on the ratings of long-term partner desirability, short-term part-
ner desirability, and physical attractiveness. All results are
summarized in Appendix B.
Long-Term Partner Desirability
The analysis revealed a significant main effect of gender on
desirability as a long-term partner, F(1, 112) ¼ 5.02, p ¼ .03,
Z2
p
¼ .04, with men giving higher long-term desirability ratings
than women. There was also a significant main effect of humor
production, F(1, 112) ¼ 53.89, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .33, with high
producers rated as more desirable than low producers. The
effect of humor receptivity was also significant, F(1, 112) ¼
54.03, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .33, with highly receptive individuals
receiving higher desirability ratings than individuals low in
humor receptivity. Results also revealed a marginally signifi-
cant interaction between production and gender, F(1, 112) ¼
3.38, p ¼ .068, Z2
p
¼ .03. For women, there was a significant
effect of production, F(1, 54) ¼ 34.98, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .39, as
there was for men, F(1, 58) ¼ 18.51, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .24;
however, the effect was stronger for women. Results also
showed a significant interaction between humor receptivity and
gender, F(1, 112) ¼ 5.13, p ¼ .03, Z2
p
¼ .04. Simple effects
tests revealed that for women, there was a significant effect of
receptivity, F(1, 54) ¼ 46.30, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .46. There was
also a significant effect of receptivity for men, F(1, 58) ¼
12.71, p ¼ .001, Z2
p
¼ .18, although the effect was stronger for
women. There was also an interaction between humor production
and humor receptivity, F(1, 112) ¼ 14.78, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .12.
All of these effects, however, were qualified by a significant
interaction between gender, humor production, and humor
receptivity, F(1, 112) ¼ 13.53, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .11.
To examine the three-way interaction, we performed sepa-
rate 2 (humor production: high/low) Â 2 (humor receptivity:
high/low) ANOVAs for women's and men's long-term partner
desirability ratings. Figure 1 illustrates these findings. For
women, the results revealed a significant interaction between
humor production and humor receptivity, F(1, 54) ¼ 20.92, p <
.001, Z2
p
¼ .28. Simple effects tests revealed that, holding level
of humor production constant, women rated men who were
high producers more desirable long-term partners when they
were also high in humor receptivity (M ¼ 3.92, SE ¼ 0.17) than
when they were low in humor receptivity (M ¼ 3.13, SE ¼
0.15), F(1, 54) ¼ 51.19, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .49. For men low in
humor production, however, receptivity had no effect on their
desirability, F(1, 54) ¼ 2.97, p ¼ .09, Z2
p
¼ .05. These results
suggest that humor production is more important than recep-
tivity for women, as being highly receptive to humor-only
matters if a man is also a high humor producer.
In contrast, for men rating the long-term mating desirability
of women, the interaction between humor production and
humor receptivity was not significant, F(1, 58) ¼ 0.02, p ¼
.89, Z2
p
¼ .00. Thus, for men, humor receptivity is desirable
regardless of the level of humor production.
With respect to effects of physical attractiveness of the
photographs, we found that it strongly affected desirability of
long-term mates, F(1, 112) ¼ 503.02, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .82. This
was especially the case for males, as revealed by a significant
interaction between gender and attractiveness, F(1, 112) ¼
11.64, p ¼ .001, Z2
p
¼ .09. Simple effects tests showed that
there was a significant effect of attractiveness for women's
ratings of male desirability, F(1, 54) ¼ 224.98, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .81, but the effect was slightly stronger for men's ratings of
female desirability, F(1, 58) ¼ 286.38, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .83.
Results also showed a marginally significant interaction
between physical attractiveness and humor receptivity, F(1,
112) ¼ 3.59, p ¼ .06, Z2
p
¼ .03. Simple effects analyses
revealed that individuals who were higher in physical attrac-
tiveness were perceived as more desirable long-term partners
when they were high in humor receptivity (M ¼ 4.87, SE ¼
0.11) than when low in humor receptivity (M ¼ 4.44, SE ¼
0.11), F(1, 112) ¼ 36.49, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .24. The pattern was in
the same direction for individuals lower in physical attractive-
ness such that those high in humor receptivity (M ¼ 2.36, SE ¼
0.11) were also considered more desirable than those low in
humor receptivity (M ¼ 2.08, SE ¼ 0.10), F(1, 112) ¼ 25.34, p
< .001, Z2
p
¼ .18. The effect of humor receptivity, however,
was stronger for the more attractive individuals, as indicated by
the larger effect size. Humor receptivity therefore enhances the
desirability of individuals as long-term partners, especially if
they are more physically attractive.

Short-Term Partner Desirability
The analysis of short-term partner desirability ratings revealed
that males gave higher ratings than females, F(1, 112) ¼ 10.14,
p ¼ .002, Z2
p
¼ .08. High humor producers were also rated
more desirable short-term partners than low producers,
F(1, 112) ¼ 12.10, p ¼ .001, Z2
p
¼ .10, and highly receptive
individuals were rated more desirable than low receptive indi-
viduals, F(1, 112) ¼ 15.44, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .12. Unlike with
long-term ratings, production did not interact with gender,
F(1, 112) ¼ 0.086, p ¼ .77, Z2
p
¼ .001, and receptivity did
not interact with gender, F(1, 112) ¼ 0.003, p ¼ .96, Z2
p
¼ .00.
We did find a significant interaction between humor produc-
tion and humor receptivity, F(1, 112) ¼ 4.24, p ¼ .04, Z2
p
¼
.04. There was also a marginally significant interaction
between humor production, humor receptivity, and gender,
F(1, 112) ¼ 2.99, p ¼ .09, Z2
p
¼ .03.
To examine the three-way interaction, we performed sepa-
rate 2 (humor production: high/low) Â 2 (humor receptivity:
high/low) ANOVAs for women and men. These results are
presented in Figure 2. For women's ratings of men's desirabil-
ity as short-term partners, there was a significant interaction
between humor production and humor receptivity, F(1, 54) ¼
4.82, p ¼ .03, Z2
p
¼ .08. Holding the level of humor production
constant, women judged men who were high in production as
more desirable when they were also high in humor receptivity
(M ¼ 3.36, SE ¼ 0.12) than when they were low in receptivity
(M ¼ 3.06, SE ¼ 0.12), F(1, 54) ¼ 9.16, p ¼ .004, Z2
p
¼ .15.
When men were low in humor production there was no differ-
ence in desirability between high receptivity and low receptiv-
ity males, F(1, 54) ¼ 0.03, p ¼ .86, Z2
p
¼ .001. As with the
long-term ratings, short-term results suggest that humor pro-
duction is more important to women than is receptivity. For
men rating women, the interaction between humor production
and humor receptivity did not reach significance, F(1, 54) ¼
0.10, p ¼ .76, Z2
p
¼ .002. Thus, for men, the effect of humor
receptivity was not affected by the level of humor production.
Regarding the effects of the physical attractiveness of the
photographs, we found a large effect on short-term mating
desirability, F(1, 112) ¼ 1,453.09, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .93. There
was also an interaction between gender and attractiveness, F(1,
112) ¼ 5.42, p ¼ .022, Z2
p
¼ .05. Simple effects tests showed
that there was a significant effect of attractiveness for women's
ratings, F(1, 54) ¼ 649.55, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .92, and a slightly
stronger effect for men's ratings, F(1, 58) ¼ 811.95, p < .001,
Z2
p
¼ .93. There was also a significant interaction between
humor receptivity and physical attractiveness, F(1, 112) ¼
7.59, p ¼ .007, Z2
p
¼ .06. Simple effects tests revealed that
individuals who were higher in physical attractiveness were
rated more desirable when they were high in humor receptivity
(M ¼ 5.02, SE ¼ 0.09) than when they were low in receptivity
(M ¼ 4.78, SE ¼ 0.09), F(1, 112) ¼ 18.81, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .14.
For individuals low in physical attractiveness, there was no
difference between those high in receptivity and those low in
receptivity, F(1, 112) ¼ 1.50, p ¼ .22. Thus, for short-term
partners, being receptive to humor did not boost the desirability
of partners when they were low in physical attractiveness. This
contrasts with the long-term desirability ratings where there
was a difference between the two levels of receptivity when
attractiveness was low. No other interactions reached
significance.
Ratings of Physical Attractiveness
Serving as a manipulation check, we found that photographs
in the ``higher attractiveness'' category received higher rat-
ings of physical attractiveness by our experimental partici-
pants than the photographs in the ``lower attractiveness''
category, F(1, 112) ¼ 482.34, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .81. Results also
revealed that individuals who were high in humor production
received higher ratings of physical attractiveness than indi-
viduals low in humor production, F(1, 112) ¼ 102.39, p <
.001, Z2
p
¼ .48. Individuals high in humor receptivity were
also rated more physically attractive than individuals low in
receptivity, F(1, 112) ¼ 115.61, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .51. These
findings demonstrate that judgments of physical attractive-
ness can be influenced by information regarding the person-
ality characteristics of individuals.
Results also showed that men gave higher physical att-
ractiveness ratings than women, F(1, 112) ¼ 7.41, p ¼ .008,
Z2
p
¼ .06. There was also a significant interaction between
humor production and gender, F(1, 112) ¼ 4.98, p ¼ .03,
Z2
p
¼ .04. Simple effects tests revealed that the effect of
humor production on attractiveness was significant for men's
ratings, F(1, 58) ¼ 30.57, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .35, but the effect
of humor production was much stronger for women's ratings,
F(1, 54) ¼ 78.26, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .59.

significant. In addition, the interactions between gender, humor

icant. All of these effects were qualified by a significant
four-way interaction between humor production, humor recep-
tivity, physical attractiveness, and gender, F(1, 112) ¼ 4.76,
p ¼ .03, Z2
p
¼ .04. To examine the nature of the four-way
interaction, we performed 2 (humor production: high/low) Â
2 (humor receptivity: high/low) Â 2 (physical attractiveness:
higher/lower) ANOVAs for women and men separately.
Women's ratings of male physical attractiveness. The three-way
interaction between humor production, humor receptivity, and
physical attractiveness was significant, F(1, 54) ¼ 13.14, p ¼
.001, Z2
p
¼ .20. To examine the three-way interaction, we con-
ducted 2 (humor production: high/low) Â 2 (humor receptivity:
high/low) ANOVAs for each level of physical attractiveness
separately. These results are shown in Figure 3. For women's
physical attractiveness ratings of the more attractive male
photographs, there was a significant interaction between humor
production and humor receptivity, F(1, 54) ¼ 46.31, p < .001,
Z2
p
¼ .46. Holding the level of humor production constant, for
the high humor production condition, men high in humor
receptivity (M ¼ 4.93, SE ¼ 0.18) were perceived as more
physically attractive than men low in receptivity (M ¼ 3.33,
SE ¼ 0.15), F(1, 54) ¼ 81.95, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .60. The one-way
ANOVA for the low humor production condition did not reach
significance, F(1, 54) ¼ 0.009, p ¼ .92, Z2
p
¼ .00.
For women's physical attractiveness ratings of the less
attractive male photographs, the interaction between humor
production and humor receptivity was also significant though
the effect size was smaller than for the more attractive male
photographs, F(1, 54) ¼ 30.44, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .36. Men who
were high in humor production were perceived as more phy-
sically attractive when they were also high in humor receptiv-
ity (M ¼ 2.71, SE ¼ 0.20) than when they were low in
receptivity (M ¼ 1.95, SE ¼ 0.15), F(1, 54) ¼ 30.53, p <
.001, Z2
p
¼. 36. For men who were low in humor production,
receptivity did not have an effect on perceptions of physical
attractiveness, F(1, 54) ¼ 1.52, p ¼ .22, Z2
p
¼. 03. These
results parallel the findings for women when rating the desir-
ability of long-term partners and short-term partners, with
humor receptivity only boosting desirability when combined
with high humor production.
Men's ratings of female physical attractiveness. Unlike women's
ratings, the three-way interaction between humor production,
humor receptivity, and physical attractiveness was not signifi-
cant for men, F(1, 58) ¼ 1.28, p ¼ .26, Z2
p
¼ .02. Nonetheless,
to examine how humor production and humor receptivity
affected men's ratings of physical attractiveness, we performed
2 (humor production: high vs. low) Â 2 (humor receptivity:
high vs. low) ANOVAs. We did so for each physical attrac-
tiveness group separately in order to parallel our analyses of
women's ratings of male attractiveness. Results of these anal-
yses are depicted in Figure 4. For the higher attractiveness
female photographs, the interaction between humor production
and humor receptivity was significant, F(1, 58) ¼ 8.55, p ¼
.005, Z2
p
¼ .13. Holding humor production constant, for the
high production condition, women who were high in humor
receptivity (M ¼ 5.39, SE ¼ 0.14) were rated more physically
attractive than those low in receptivity (M ¼ 4.14, SE ¼ 0.13),
F(1, 58) ¼ 57.51, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .50. For the low humor
production condition, the ANOVA revealed that women high
in humor receptivity were also rated more physically attractive
(M ¼ 4.51, SE ¼ 0.13) than those low in receptivity (M ¼ 3.87,
SE ¼ 0.14), F(1, 58) ¼ 22.26, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .28.
For the lower attractiveness female photographs, the inter-
action between humor production and humor receptivity was
also significant, F(1, 58) ¼ 9.12, p < .004, Z2
p
¼ .14. Women
who were high in humor production were perceived as more
physically attractive when they were high in humor receptivity
(M ¼ 2.51, SE ¼ 0.19) than when low in receptivity (M ¼ 2.06,
SE ¼ 0.14), F(1, 58) ¼ 20.36, p < .001, Z2
p
¼ .26. For women
who were low in humor production, humor receptivity did not
have an effect on men's ratings of physical attractiveness, F(1,
58) ¼ 0.36, p ¼ .55, Z2
p
¼ .006. For the attractive females, then,
their physical attractiveness was enhanced when they were
receptive to humor even when their humor production was low.
This was not the case for the less attractive females. For them,
both high production and receptivity needed to be present to
boost their physical attractiveness.
Discussion
This study examined the effects of humor production and
humor receptivity on the desirability of men and women who

vary in physical attractiveness. The goal was to assess the
evolutionary function of humor in the context of mating, focus-
ing on whether it functions predominantly as an indicator of
fitness, as an indicator of romantic interest, or as an encryption
of compatibility.
With respect to the effects of humor on the desirability of
long-term mates, the results revealed that both humor produc-
tion and humor receptivity were desired by men and women.
Consistent with the fitness indicator hypothesis, however,
humor production had a stronger effect on women's ratings
than it did on males. According to this view, because males
make a smaller minimum investment in reproduction, they
have to display their traits to prove their worth to females, the
high investing sex. The production of humor serves to indicate
desirable and heritable psychological characteristics including
intelligence, creativity, and language ability (Miller, 2000).
Also consistent with the fitness indicator view, humor produc-
tion in a prospective partner was more important to women
than was humor receptivity. This was evidenced by the fact
that humor receptivity only had an effect on women's ratings
when the men were also high producers of humor. This is
similar to Hone et al.'s (2015) finding that for women, humor
production is a necessity, while humor receptivity is a luxury.
Even though humor production was more important to
women than receptivity to humor, we also found that receptiv-
ity had a stronger effect on women's ratings of long-term part-
ner desirability than on men's ratings, a finding that goes
against the fitness indicator hypothesis. The fact that a man's
receptivity to humor is very important to women is consistent
with the encryption hypothesis. After all, failure to appreciate a
woman's humor may convey that the man does not share a
woman's values or cultural experiences and is therefore less
likely to be successful at engaging in cooperative ventures such
as childrearing (Curry & Dunbar, 2013). Indeed, in conversa-
tions, laughter has been found to be an indicator of agreement
and affiliation with the person talking (Vettin & Todt, 2004).
There is nothing in the encryption view, however, that predicts
that women should value both production and receptivity to
humor more than men, as compatibility should be a concern
to both. Nonetheless, this finding is consistent with previous
research showing that women generally pay more attention to
the internal attributes of potential mates than do men (e.g.,
Furnham, 2009).
In addition to the humor conditions predicting long-term
ratings, we also found that physical attractiveness strongly pre-
dicted desirability. Despite the importance of physical attrac-
tiveness, we only found modest evidence supporting the
interest indicator hypothesis. The hypothesis holds that how
humor is perceived depends on whether there is an attraction
between individuals (Li et al., 2009). People produce humor
when they want to indicate they are interested in someone, and
if the recipient is attracted to the person, they will respond more
positively to the humor that is offered. As a result, humor
should boost long-term partner desirability when physical
attractiveness is high but not when it is low. The only evidence
consistent with this hypothesis was a marginally significant
interaction between humor receptivity and attractiveness, with
receptivity boosting desirability of the physically attractive
individuals more than the less attractive. We did not, however,
find an interaction between humor production and physical
attractiveness. Instead, humor production caused an increase
in desirability of the lower and higher physically attractive
individuals equally, as predicted by the fitness indicator
hypothesis and the encryption hypothesis.
With respect to short-term partner ratings, we found that the
effects of physical attractiveness were even stronger than they
were for long-term partner ratings. This is similar to Buss and
Schmitt (1993), who found that physical attractiveness was
more important for short-term mating than for long-term mat-
ing. In contrast, although humor production and receptivity
boosted the desirability of potential partners, the effects of the
humor conditions were generally either smaller than for long-
term ratings or they disappeared altogether. For example, we
found that humor production was more important to women
than receptivity, as the latter only had an influence when pro-
duction was high. This effect, however, was smaller than in the
case of long-term partner ratings. Furthermore, we did not find
interactions between production and gender, or receptivity and
gender, in the case of short-term desirability. This is consistent
with Bressler et al. (2006) and Hone et al. (2015) who found
that sex differences in humor were present only in the case of
long-term relationships but not short-term relationships. Find-
ing stronger effects of the humor manipulations for long-term
mating is inconsistent with the fitness indicator hypothesis, as it
predicts that genetic factors should be important in both mating
contexts. The findings are also inconsistent with the interest
indicator view, as it claims that humor is used to convey inter-
est in both long-term and short-term mating contexts. The
results are consistent, however, with the encryption hypothesis,
which predicts that issues of compatibility should be particu-
larly important in long-term relationships, as it is only therein
that cooperation on important tasks is likely to be an issue.

and less attractive women as a function of humor production (high and

Tornquist and Chiappe 9
An exception to the finding that effects of humor were more
pronounced for long-term partners than short-term partners is
the interaction between humor receptivity and attractiveness,
which was only marginally significant in the former. Thus, the
strongest support for the interest indicator theory came in the
case of short-term mating, where the effect of humor receptiv-
ity on desirability ratings was evident only for the more attrac-
tive individuals. We note, however, that the interest indicator
hypothesis also predicts that humor production should boost
desirability of attractive individuals more than less attractive
individuals, and this result was not borne out in either long-
term or short-term contexts. This is the case despite the fact that
humor production on its own did cause an increase in desir-
ability in both contexts and did so particularly for females in
the case of long-term mating.
Although several studies have examined the effect of humor
production and receptivity on mate selection, ours is the first to
examine whether humor can also influence ratings of physical
attractiveness. The question of whether judgments of physical
attractiveness can be affected by nonphysical characteristics has
generally been understudied (Kniffin & Wilson, 2004; Swami,
2012). We found that both, high humor production and high
humor receptivity, can increase these ratings. Humor production,
however, was particularly important for women's ratings of male
physical attractiveness, and humor receptivity boosted physical
attractiveness ratings only when combined with high humor
production. These results are most consistent with the fitness
indicator hypothesis, as humor, which is linked to heritable psy-
chological characteristics, caused an increase in desirability.
Finding that humor can influence judgments of physical
attractiveness is inconsistent with sequential models of mate
selection and cue integration. According to Miller and Todd
(1998), for example, cues important to mate selection are not
available simultaneously and require different amounts of time
to assess. As a result, they cannot be integrated all at once to
determine judgments of how desirable someone is as a prospec-
tive mate. Instead, they argue that criteria are implemented
sequentially, each with a certain threshold level to ascertain
whether to continue courtship or to terminate it. Physical attrac-
tiveness is the first filter, which determines who one will
approach. Only individuals who exceed some threshold for
physical attractiveness will be talked to. Other characteristics
like intelligence and personality are evaluated later on and
require much more time to judge. Some factors will be assessed
after a conversation, including intelligence, while other person-
ality characteristics may require much more time.
What our findings show is that such a model is too linear.
The information one finds out about an individual, including
their sense of humor, can feed back on the original judgment of
physical attractiveness and either increase it or decrease it. We
found this to be particularly the case for women's ratings of
male physical attractiveness, though men's ratings were also
influenced by humor. This is consistent with Kniffin and Wil-
son's (2004) results showing that women's ratings of physical
attractiveness of men that they knew were more likely to be
influenced by nonphysical information including likeability
than were men's ratings of physical attractiveness. The latter's
ratings were more similar to the ratings of men who did not
know the women. In short, judgments of physical attractiveness
encode not just information about a person's heritable physical
characteristics, they also integrate information about a person's
heritable psychological characteristics.
Taken together, the present results provide the most support
for both the fitness indicator and encryption hypotheses. The
fitness indicator hypothesis can explain the finding that high
humor production and receptivity caused an increase in the
desirability of long-term and short-term mates regardless of the
physical attractiveness of the individuals, and also why humor
was able to increase ratings of physical attractiveness. It can
also explain the finding that humor production was more
important to women than it was to men. It cannot explain,
however, the fact that receptivity was also more important to
women than to men, and why generally humor had a stronger
effect in long-term mating contexts than short-term mating
contexts. The encryption model, in addition to explaining why
humor production and receptivity can increase desirability of
mates, can also explain why the humor conditions should have
a stronger influence in long-term mating contexts than short-
term mating contexts. It does not explain, however, why humor
production and receptivity were more important to women, and
why humor influenced judgments of physical attractiveness.
Indeed, Curry and Dunbar (2013) found that although similar-
ity of humor influenced the ratings of affiliation, it did not
influence the evaluations of other characteristics of individuals.
The view receiving the least support was the interest indicator
hypothesis. It was only supported by finding that in the case of
short-term mating, humor receptivity had a stronger effect for
women rating the more attractive male faces.
To conclude, our study suggests that the most important
functions of humor may be to indicate the fitness of prospective
mates and their compatibility in terms of shared goals, back-
ground knowledge, and values. In a more minor role, humor
may serve as an indicator of romantic interest. Given the com-
plexity of humor, it is not surprising to see that it likely plays
multiple roles (Galloway, 1994). Of course, it is important to
keep in mind that our findings pertain only to the context of
mating. Outside of this context, it is quite possible that humor's
role as an indicator of fitness may be minimized, while its role
as an encrypted indicator of compatibility becomes even more
important. After all, just because another person possesses
many great heritable characteristics, it does not follow that they
will be sufficiently compatible to make cooperation on long-
term projects feasible. Moreover, sex differences observed in
the context of mating may disappear altogether in other situa-
tions such as same-sex friendships.

it's her (his) time to place her order, she (he) gives you her (his)
phone number and tells you that it was nice talking to you. As
you wait for your turn, you consider whether you will call her
(him) or not.
Sample low in humor production/low in humor receptivity. Please
imagine that you are having lunch in the school cafeteria when
this woman (man) you have never met before comes up to talk
to you. As you give her (him) your permission to join you for
lunch, you talk about your hometowns, school, and your inter-
ests. You are having a natural and easygoing conversation.
Although she (he) is talking about things that you find inter-
esting, you note that she (he) doesn't try to crack that many
jokes. Moreover, she (he) pays close attention to what you are
saying and she (he) smiles at you frequently, but she (he)
doesn't laugh very much at your funny comments. Both of you
realize that you have to get to class and you exchange phone
numbers. On your way to class, you consider whether you will
call her (him) or not.
