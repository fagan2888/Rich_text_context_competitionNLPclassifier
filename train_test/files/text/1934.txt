Background. Liver-related mortality among those infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) has been described,
but little is known about non­liver-related mortality. Our objective was to determine HCV-associated all-cause,
liver-, and non­liver-related mortality in the general US population.
Methods. A prospective cohort study of 9378 nationally representative adults aged 17­59 years was performed
utilizing the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES III) Linked Mortality File that
was made publicly available in 2010. HCV status was assessed from 1988 to 1994, with mortality follow-up of the
same individuals through 2006.
Results. There were 614 deaths over a median follow-up of 14.8 years. After adjusting for all covariate
risk factors, HCV chronic infection had a 2.37 times higher all-cause mortality rate ratio [MRR] (95% CI: 1.28­4.38;
P 5 .008), a 26.46 times higher liver-related MRR (95% CI: 8.00­87.48; P , .001), and 1.79 times higher non­liver-
related MRR (95% CI: .77­4.19; P 5 .18), compared with being HCV-negative. This represents an estimated 2.46
million US adults aged 17­59 years with chronic HCV infection who had an estimated 31,163 deaths from all causes
per year, of which 57.8% (95% CI: 21.9%­77.2%) were attributable to HCV. Among those, there was an estimated
9569 liver-related deaths per year, of which 96.2% (95% CI: 87.5­98.9%) were attributable to HCV. Non­
liver-related deaths were not significantly associated with HCV status.
Conclusions. Chronic HCV all-cause mortality is more than twice that of HCV-negative individuals. This
suggests that those with chronic HCV infection are at a higher risk of death even after accounting for liver-related
morbidity and should be closely monitored.
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is a bloodborne infection
that affects nearly 2.2% of the world's population, or
130 million people [1]. Approximately 55%­85% of
newly infected cases progress to chronicity; of those,
20%­30% will develop liver fibrosis, cirrhosis, and
liver failure, and 2%­5% will advance to hepatocel-
lular carcinoma [2­6].
In the United States, data from the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES
III) and 1999­2002 NHANES estimated that the num-
ber of persons positive for HCV antibodies (anti-HCV
positive) increased from 3.9 million persons in
1988­1994 to 4.1 million in 1999­2002 [7, 8]. Over the
same time period, the number of chronically infected
persons (anti-HCV positive and HCV-RNA positive)
increased from 2.7 million to 3.2 million. Population
growth and the chronic nature of HCV are likely the
main factors behind the increased prevalence despite
prevention efforts (primarily motivated by human im-
munodeficiency virus [HIV] risk), which resulted in
a drop in incident HCV cases from 230,000 per year in
the 1980s to its current level of 19,000 cases per year [6].
Chronic HCV infection is currently the cause of 40% of

all chronic liver disease (CLD) in the United States. Approxi-
mately 8000­10,000 CLD-related deaths occur annually, and
HCV-associated end-stage liver disease is the leading indication
for liver transplantation among adults [9­11].
Multiple studies have sought to quantify or project the
burden of mortality from HCV. Data from the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimated that an
average of 12,000 HCV-related deaths from CLD occur each
year [12]. Other studies produced more modest findings and
ranged between 3340 and 7427 HCV-related deaths per year
[13, 14]. These latter calculations were based on conservative
estimates of deaths among individuals with CLD or HIV-
infected patients with concurrent HCV infection, rather than
a broadly representative sample of HCV-infected individuals
from the US population.
Since HCV is predominantly asymptomatic and not routinely
tested for in the general US population, it is difficult to quantify
the overall long-term mortality burden, particularly among
those without liver disease. However, the recent release in 2010
of the NHANES III Linked Mortality File with mortality follow-
up through December 31, 2006, provides a unique opportunity
to address this question. In this study, we evaluated the associ-
ation of HCV status with all-cause and cause-specific mortality.
Since mortality was ascertained in the same NHANES III par-
ticipants over 12­18 years, this study is a true prospective cohort
study among HCV-infected individuals in a representative
sample of the general US population.
METHODS
Study Participants
Participants from the NHANES III survey aged $17 years at
initial enrollment and with vital status follow-up data in 2006
were included in this analysis. NHANES III is a multistage
probability survey conducted during 1988­1994 by the National
Center for Health Statistics [15] designed to represent
noninstitutionalized American civilians, which oversampled
non-Hispanic blacks, Mexican Americans, and older adults
[16]. Our initial analysis included all participants $17 years
(n 5 16,509), and was subsequently narrowed to only 9378
participants aged 17­59 years for whom HCV covariate risk
factor information was available (including drug use and sexual
activity data), and additional covariate-adjusted analyses could
be performed. The University of Maryland School of Medicine
Institutional Review Board formally reviewed this study and
determined the secondary analysis of this de-identified data set
to be exempt.
Study Variables
NHANES III survey and data collection procedures [15], and
detailed descriptions of laboratory assays and quality control
procedures are available elsewhere [17]. Briefly, NHANES in-
cluded an interview, physical examination, and blood draw.
Testing for antibody to HCV (anti-HCV) was performed using
a second-generation enzyme immunoassay (EIA) and a supple-
mental test (EIA 2.0 and HCV MATRIX, Abbott Laboratories).
HCV-RNA was tested on anti­HCV-positive samples using
reverse-transcriptase-polymerase-chain reaction amplification
of the 5# noncoding region (Boehringer Mannheim) [7].
Body mass index (BMI, kg/m2) was calculated using mea-
sured height and weight. Self-reported number of alcoholic
drinks over the previous 30 days of ,30, 30­60, and .60 drinks,
were classified as ,1, 1­2, and .2 drinks/d, respectively. Par-
ticipants self-reported age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, non-Hispanic black, Mexican American, other), marital
status, education, smoking status, lifetime number of sex
partners, lifetime marijuana and cocaine use, and physician
diagnosis of cancer and diabetes. Poverty income ratio was
computed as the total family income divided by the poverty
threshold based on year of interview, as defined by the US
Census Bureau.
This analysis used the 2010 public-release NHANES III
Linked Mortality File which included mortality follow-up
through December 31, 2006, by probabilistic matching to Na-
tional Death Index records using 12 identifying variables.
Matching was validated via manual review of a subsample of
death certificates. Cause of death was classified using the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision [18], for
deaths during 1988­1998, and using the International Statistical
Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision (ICD-10) [19] for deaths
during 1999­2006. Deaths during 1988­1998 were recoded
based on ICD-10 causes. The primary outcome studied was all-
cause mortality. Mortality ascribed to liver-related causes in-
cluding malignant neoplasm of liver (code C22), viral hepatitis
(codes B15­B19), alcoholic liver disease (code K70), and other
chronic liver disease and cirrhosis (codes K73­K74) was a sec-
ondary outcome.
Statistical Analysis
To accommodate the complex survey design, we used the survey
package of R software version 2.10.0 [20]. We calculated stan-
dard errors using linearization to account for stratification and
clustering [21]. All estimates were weighted to represent the US
population. Survey-weighted all-cause mortality rates and 95%
confidence intervals (CI) stratified by HCV status, age, and sex
were calculated for participants aged $17 years. A separate
comparison for participants aged 17­59 years was made between
anti-HCV negative, anti-HCV positive, and anti-HCV and
HCV-RNA positive (chronic HCV infection), with respect to
baseline characteristics using Wald v2 tests or t-tests and
all-cause mortality using weighted Kaplan-Meier survival curves
and weighted Cox proportional hazards models [22]. Those who

were anti-HCV positive but HCV-RNA negative were included
with those who were anti-HCV positive and RNA positive
(chronic HCV infection) under the ``anti-HCV positive'' group
and were not analyzed as a separate group due to small num-
bers. Three models assessed associations of HCV status with
mortality. First, we fit a model adjusted for age and sex, followed
by a partially adjusted model that additionally included
demographics (race/ethnicity, marital status, education, poverty
income ratio), lifestyle behaviors (alcohol consumption, smok-
ing, lifetime cocaine and marijuana use, lifetime number of
sexual partners), BMI, and comorbidities and viruses (cancer,
diabetes, hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis E antibody). Finally, we
fit a fully adjusted model that additionally included liver func-
tion biomarkers (ALT and total bilirubin). We initially planned
to adjust for hepatitis B virus surface antigen but excluded it due
to data sparseness, given that only 45 participants tested positive
for it among whom only 4 were also positive for anti-HCV, and
only 3 were also positive for HCV-RNA. A sensitivity analysis
showed that exclusion of HBV had negligible impact on model
estimates (data not shown).
Results from the fully adjusted model were used to calculate
expected survival. Weighted Cox proportional hazards models
were also used to separately analyze liver-related and non­
liver-related mortality. Due to small numbers of liver-related

deaths, partial adjustment factors were age, sex, white race,
poverty income ratio, alcohol consumption, smoking status,
BMI, and number of comorbidities/viruses (sum of cancer,
diabetes, hepatitis A antibody, hepatitis E antibody).
We calculated national estimates for the annual total number
of deaths from all causes for those aged 17­59 years who were
anti-HCV positive and those with chronic HCV infection. The
estimates were calculated as weighted average annual mortality
rates 3 N, where N was the estimated total population aged
17-59 years who were anti-HCV positive or chronically HCV-
infected. We calculated the attributable risk percentage as
(mortality rate ratio [MRR]-1)/MRR 3 100 from the fully
adjusted Cox models. We performed similar calculations for
liver-related and non­liver-related deaths. All P-values were
2-sided; P , .05 was considered statistically significant.
While NHANES III did not collect data on HIV serostatus,
which may confound the association between HCV and mortality,
the NHANES III Linked Mortality File included HIV as a cause
of death (codes B20­B24). As a sensitivity analysis, we reanalyzed
the data by censoring deaths ascribed to HIV. Among those

RESULTS
Among 16,509 participants aged $17 years, 3853 deaths
occurred over a median follow-up of 14.3 years (interquartile
range 12.7­16.2 years). Seventy-seven (2.0%) deaths were
ascribed to liver-related causes: malignant liver neoplasms
(n 5 24), viral hepatitis (n 5 7), alcoholic liver disease (n 5 17),
and other chronic liver diseases (n 5 29). Table 1 shows all-
cause mortality rates by HCV status for those aged $ 17 years.
There were 11.1 (95% CI:10.1­12.2), 14.8 (95% CI:9.9­22.1)
and 16.5 (95% CI:10.5­26.0) deaths per 1000 person-years for
anti-HCV negative, anti-HCV positive, and chronic HCV-in-
fected individuals, respectively. Mortality was highest for
chronically infected individuals and lowest for anti-HCV nega-
tive individuals for all subgroups defined by age and sex, except
for men aged 17­29 years where mortality rates were similar.
Liver-related mortality rates (Table 2) for those aged $17
years were 0.16 (95% CI: .10­.25), 3.8 (95% CI:1.5­9.7), and 4.4
(95% CI:1.5­12.9) deaths per 1000 person-years for anti-HCV
negative (58 deaths), anti-HCV positive (19 deaths), and
chronically infected individuals (17 deaths), respectively.
In our covariate-adjusted analysis of the subset of 9378 par-
ticipants aged 17­59 years, there were 614 deaths over a median
follow-up of 14.8 years (interquartile range 13.3­16.4 y).
Twenty-seven (4.4%) deaths in this age group were ascribed to
liver-related causes: malignant liver neoplasms (n 5 5), viral
hepatitis (n 5 6), alcoholic liver disease (n 5 8), and other
chronic liver diseases (n 5 8). The chronically infected partic-
ipants (N 5 203) had 44 deaths, including 9 from liver-related
causes. The remaining deaths were ascribed to HIV (n 5 5),
other infectious diseases (n 5 2), cancer (n 5 3), cardiovascular
disease (n 5 6), diabetes (n 5 3), and other causes (n 5 16).
Participants who were anti-HCV positive (N 5 251) had 6 ad-
ditional deaths, for a total of 50 deaths (cancer [n 5 3], car-
diovascular disease [n 5 3]).
The 17­59-year-olds included in analysis were younger, had
a higher poverty income ratio, were more likely to be married,
high school graduates, non-Hispanic white, and to have used
cocaine compared with 17­59 year olds excluded from analysis
(all P , .05). All other variables were similar between excluded
and included participants (all P $ .05).
Table 3 shows that among participants aged 17­59 years,
those who were anti-HCV positive, or chronically infected, were
more likely to be male, non-Hispanic black, single, high-school
drop-outs, current smokers, and anti-HIV positive (all P , .05)
than those who were anti-HCV negative. Those who were anti-
HCV negative also had higher incomes, fewer sexual partners,
less marijuana or cocaine use, and lower ALT levels (all
P , .001).

Table 4 shows that among individuals aged 17­59 years, the
mortality rate was consistently highest among those who were
chronically infected, followed by those who were anti-HCV
positive, compared with those who were anti-HCV negative.
After adjusting for all covariates except for liver function bio-
markers, being anti-HCV positive was associated with a 2.34
times higher mortality rate (95% CI: 1.35­4.04, P 5 .004), a
finding that was attenuated to 2.11 after adjusting for liver
function biomarkers. The analogous mortality rate ratio (MRR)
for those chronically infected was 2.65 (95% CI: 1.51­4.66,
P 5 .001), which was attenuated to 2.37 after adjusting for liver
function biomarkers. Figure 1A shows that the estimated un-
adjusted 10-year mortality incidence was 3% for those who were
anti-HCV negative, 10% for those who were anti-HCV positive,
and 11% for those chronically infected; whereas Figure 1B shows
that the 10-year expected mortality incidence adjusted for co-
variates (covariates set at survey-weighted means) was 2% for
those who are anti-HCV negative, 3% for those who were anti-
HCV positive, and 4% for those who were chronically infected.
Table 4 additionally shows mortality rate ratio (MRR) sepa-
rately for liver-related deaths and non­liver-related deaths for
participants aged 17­59 years. After adjusting for all covariates
except for liver function biomarkers, anti-HCV positive partic-
ipants had a liver-related MRR of 26.02 (95% CI: 7.64­88.56,
P , .001), which was attenuated to 19.73 after adjusting for liver
function biomarkers. Chronically infected participants had a
liver-related MRR of 36.40 (95% CI: 10.04­131.9, P , .001),
which was attenuated to 26.46 after full adjustment. HCV status
was not significantly associated with non­liver-related mortality
after partial and full covariate adjustment (P . .10).
After generalizing to the US population, the estimated total
population size of 17­59-year-olds who were anti-HCV positive
was 3.22 million. Table 5 shows that within this group there was
an estimated 33,759 deaths per year from all causes occurring
from 1988 to 1994 through 2006, of which, after adjusting for all
covariates, 52.6% (95% CI: 15.2%­73.3%) were attributable to
the presence of anti-HCV. Similarly, the estimated total pop-
ulation size of those aged 17­59 years and chronically infected
was 2.46 million among whom an estimated 31,163 deaths per
year occurred, of which 57.8% (95% CI: 21.9%­77.2%) were
attributable to HCV infection. There was an estimate of 9569
liver-related deaths per year among those who were chronically
infected, of which 96.2% (95% CI: 87.5%­98.9%) were attrib-
utable to HCV infection.
When deaths ascribed to HIV were treated as censored,
all-cause mortality MRRs for anti-HCV were attenuated by
2%­4%, but all were still statistically significant. Similarly,
all-cause mortality MRRs for anti-HCV and HCV-RNA were
attenuated by 3%­6%, but all were still statistically significant.
DISCUSSION
Using data from a large representative sample of US adults
enrolled in the NHANES III study in 1988­1994, and followed
up until 2006, we found that all-cause and liver-related mor-
tality among adults with positive anti-HCV antibodies, and
those with chronic HCV infection was higher than those who
were anti-HCV negative. Our reported liver-related deaths
were 9569 per year, which is consistent with other estimates
that ranged between 12,000 annual HCV-related deaths esti-
mated by the CDC and 3340­7427 deaths per year in other
studies [12­14, 23]. The lower estimates in these latter studies
may be explained by (1) their narrow definition of HCV-
related deaths that depend on coexisting CLD or HIV as the
cause of death; and (2) our more inclusive definition that
incorporated ICD codes for liver-related malignant neoplasms,
viral hepatitis, and alcoholic liver disease.
Our reported deaths from all-causes, however, were much
higher than those of previous studies [24­27]. A study in the
United Kingdom following HCV-infected patients at secondary

probabilities from weighted Kaplan-Meier (A), and covariate-adjusted
expected survival probabilities from weighted Cox proportional hazards
models (B).

care centers found a 3-fold higher mortality than the general
English population, but no difference in non­liver-related
deaths [24, 25]. Another report from Switzerland followed
HCV-infected patients attending secondary and tertiary care
centers for 2 years and found no excess mortality compared with
the general Swiss population after adjusting for lifestyle factors,
HIV, and other diseases [26]. Another study of transfusion
recipients showed no increase in all-cause mortality among
HCV-infected patients compared with uninfected controls [27].
However, it is plausible that our findings may still underestimate
boththetrueall-causeandliver-relatedmortalityburden.NHANES
III participants were informed of their infection after HCV testing
andhadtheopportunityto(1) seek better medical care and follow-
up; (2) benefit from improved therapeutic modalities and better
harm reduction initiatives that were adopted since their enroll-
ment; and (3) appropriately manage other comorbidities such as
HIV coinfection, all of which may have greatly reduced their
mortality. Furthermore, NHANES III results are only generaliz-
able to noninstitutionalized individuals and likely underestimate
mortality among institutionalized individuals. A study of US
correctional facilities (prisons and jail systems) found that HCV
infection among inmates was more than 10-fold higher than in the
general US population [28].
Most of the non­liver-related deaths in our study were ascribed
to HIV, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, and other causes, al-
though they were not significantly associated with HCV. This is
biologically plausible given that several studies describe an asso-
ciation between HCV and diabetes [29, 30], and between HCV
and coronary and carotid artery atherosclerosis [31­34].
Non­liver-related deaths may also be due to other factors such as
high-risk behaviors, lower socioeconomic status (as reflected by
significantly lower poverty index), barriers to accessing health
care, and genetic predisposition. This last point is illustrated in
a study of siblings of HIV/HCV­coinfected patients that showed
higher mortality in this group compared with siblings of either
HIV monoinfected patients or control subjects [35, 36].
Few studies have attempted to examine long-term excess
mortality due to HCV infection, particularly non­liver-related
mortality [24­27]. To our knowledge, only one other study in
the United States described significant excess liver-related and
non­liver-related mortality among anti-HCV positive blood
donors compared with a matched sample of anti-HCV negative
donors over a mean follow-up period of 7.7 years [37]. Although
this study sample is not representative of the general US pop-
ulation, it is more similar to our study in that the participants
were not previously aware of their HCV infection, and hence
HCV-positive individuals without any known liver morbidity
could be included. Their inclusion of a large number of
HCV-positive individuals (.10,000) may explain their signifi-
cantly higher non­liver-related mortality.
Our current study had many strengths including a large
representative sample of US adults with no prior knowledge
of their HCV status, objectively measured HCV antibody and
HCV RNA, a long follow-up period, and validation using
multiple analysis techniques. Some limitations should be
noted when interpreting study results. First, while the
mortality was prospectively assessed, NHANES III was an
observational study; therefore, the potential exists for
unmeasured or excluded confounding factors. We attempted
to mitigate this possibility by controlling for many known
confounders and performing sensitivity analyses. Second, this
study relied on self-reported data for behaviors and co-
morbidities. Third, non­liver-related deaths may have been
overestimated due to underlying undiagnosed liver disease.
Conversely, unknown antiviral treatment or liver trans-
plantation may have lowered liver disease mortality, espe-
cially in the latter years of the study. Lastly, the fully adjusted
analyses were limited to those who provided complete data
on high-risk covariates; however, sensitivity analyses showed
robust study conclusions.
In conclusion, this study suggests that mortality among HCV-
infected individuals in the general US population is higher than
previously described. Given these findings, and the greater
availability and affordability of various HCV testing methods,
perhaps increased testing, earlier therapy, and closer monitoring
of all HCV-positive individuals, particularly those with
non­liver-related morbidities, should be considered by health
care providers.
