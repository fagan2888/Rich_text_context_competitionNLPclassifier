Aims We hypothesized that subjects with a normal body mass index (BMI), but high body fat (BF) content [normal weight
obesity (NWO)], have a higher prevalence of cardiometabolic dysregulation and are at higher risk for cardiovascular
(CV) mortality.
Methods
and results
We analysed 6171 subjects .20 years of age from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) and the NHANES III mortality study, whose BMI was within the normal range (18.5­24.9 kg/m2),
and who underwent a complete evaluation that included body composition assessment, blood measurements, and
assessment of CV risk factors. Survival information was available for .99% of the subjects after a median follow-
up of 8.8 years. We divided our sample using sex-specific tertiles of BF%. The highest tertile of BF (.23.1% in
men and .33.3% in women) was labelled as NWO. When compared with the low BF group, the prevalence of meta-
bolic syndrome in subjects with NWO was four-fold higher (16.6 vs. 4.8%, P , 0.0001). Subjects with NWO also had
higher prevalence of dyslipidaemia, hypertension (men), and CV disease (women). After adjustment, women with
NWO showed a significant 2.2-fold increased risk for CV mortality (HR ¼ 2.2; 95% CI, 1.03­4.67) in comparison
to the low BF group.
Conclusion Normal weight obesity, defined as the combination of normal BMI and high BF content, is associated with a high
prevalence of cardiometabolic dysregulation, metabolic syndrome, and CV risk factors. In women, NWO is indepen-
dently associated with increased risk for CV mortality.

Introduction
The prevalence of obesity in the USA has risen remarkably over
the past four decades, increasing from 13% in the 60s, to over
30% in the most recent analyses of the National Health and Nutri-
tion Examination Surveys (NHANES).1­ 3 Although the gold stan-
dard definition of obesity is considered an excess in body fat
(BF),4 clinicians and epidemiologists usually rely on body mass
index (BMI) as a means of defining the presence of adiposity or
obesity. Body mass index has shown many advantages as
a surrogate of BF, such as simplicity and reproducibility, and epide-
miologic studies have shown an association between extreme
values of BMI and increased mortality.5­ 8 However, a significant
limitation of using BMI is its failure to differentiate between an elev-
ated BF content and preserved or increased lean mass, especially in
patients with a BMI ,30 kg/m2.9 ­15
An excess in adiposity has been clearly associated with numer-
ous comorbidies and pathophysiologic processes, including insulin
resistance, altered lipid metabolism, and endothelial dysfunction.16
Therefore, the determination of adiposity by methods more

accurate than BMI could have public health implications.3,17 ­20 We
hypothesized that (i) BF, measured as a continuous variable, is
associated with the prevalence of metabolic syndrome and its
components in individuals with normal body weight, and that
(ii) subjects who have normal body weight based on BMI and
high BF content [normal weight obesity (NWO)] are at higher
risk for cardiometabolic dysregulation and cardiovascular (CV)
mortality when compared with normal weight subjects with low/
preserved BF content.
Methods
Study design and subject selection
The NHANES III examined a representative sample of the US non-
institutionalized civilian population from 1988 to 1994. It consists of
a periodic survey using a stratified multistage probability sampling
design to produce a generalizable health estimate of the US population.
Details on design and conduct of the survey are available to the public
at http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm. Briefly, of a sample of 39 695
people selected for the NHANES III, 33 994 were interviewed and
30 818 submitted to an examination by a physician at a mobile exam-
ination centre which included extensive anthropometric, physiological,
and laboratory testing. For this study, 14 025 adult subjects aged .20
years had bioelectrical impedance analysis to estimate body compo-
sition.21 From those, we selected subjects with blood samples and
with a normal BMI (18.5­24.9 kg/m2), as defined by the US National
Institutes of Health, resulting in a sample of 6171 subjects, 3042 men
and 3129 women.
Anthropometric measurements and body
composition analyses
All personnel performing NHANES III anthropometric and body com-
position measurements were previously trained and followed a strict
protocol.21 ­24 Body weight was measured with an electronic load
cell scale to the nearest 0.01 kg. Participants wore only under-shorts
and disposable paper shirts, pants and foam slippers. Stature was
measured to the nearest 0.1 cm using a fixed stadiometer. Participants
were positioned with heels, buttocks, back, and head against the
upright surface of the stadiometer with the head positioned in the
Frankfort horizontal plane. Waist and hip circumference were
measured by a trained examiner and determined using a measuring
tape positioned at the high point of the iliac crest for the waist and
at the greatest circumference of the buttocks. The measurement
was made with a minimal respiration to the nearest 0.1 cm, with the
tape snug but not compressing the skin.24 Body mass index was
calculated as weight in kilograms divided by squared height in meters
(kg/m2) and waist-to-hip ratio was calculated as waist circumference
divided by hip circumference. Children younger than 12 years of age,
pregnant women and subjects with pacemakers were ineligible for
bioelectrical impedance analysis. All subjects were requested to
avoid eating or drinking anything except water during the fasting
period. There were no restrictions on physical activity or alcohol con-
sumption before the fasting period. The prediction equations for total
body water and fat free mass use resistance measured with data from
RJL bioelectrical impedance analyzers (Clinton Twp, MI, USA).25
NHANES III resistance data were obtained using Valhalla impedance
analyzers. Therefore, bioimpedance resistance was converted to RJL
Res values (V) and was used to calculate BF as previously described
by Chumlea et al.26 The prediction equations used to estimate lean
mass are the following:
Men: Lean mass ¼210.678 þ 0.262 kg þ 0.652 S2/Res þ 0.015 Res
Women:Leanmass ¼29.529 þ 0.168 kg þ 0.696S2/Res þ 0.016Res
where S2/Res represent the stature squared divided by resistance
(cm2/V). We then calculated BF % as follows:
BF% ¼

cedure is presented elsewhere.26
Laboratory measurements
Lipids were measured enzymatically with the use of commercially avail-
able reagents (Cholesterol/HP, cat. no. 816302, and triglycerides/GPO,
cat. no. 816370, both from Boehringer Mannheim). HDL cholesterol
was measured in the clear supernatant after precipitating the other
lipoproteins with heparin and MnCl2
(1.3 g/L and 0.046 mol/L, respect-
ively) and removing excess Mn2þ by precipitation with NaHCO3
. The
biases (coefficients of variation) for cholesterol, triglycerides, and
HDL-C averaged ­0.3% (1.7%), ­2.1% (3.9%), and 0.3% (3.4%),
respectively. Glucose was measured using standard assay (Sigma
chemical, St Louis, MO, USA), and plasma insulin was measured with
the Pharmacia insulin radioimmunoassay kit (Pharmacia diagnostics,
Sweden). We determined the insulin sensitivity index using the
updated computer model homeostatic model assessment (HOMA2)
index.27 The apoB and apoAI were measured by radial immunodiffu-
sion in the first 8.2% of the specimens during the first 5 months of
the study and by rate immunonephelometry for the remaining speci-
mens.28 Serum leptin concentrations were measured by radioimmuno-
assay at Linco Research, Inc. (St Charles, MO, USA).29 C-reactive
protein was measured using a modification of the Behring latex-
enhanced C-reactive protein assay (Behring Diagnostics, Westwood,
MA, USA), as previously described.30 Detailed methodology on labora-
tory procedures of NHANES III is published elsewhere.31
Normal weight obesity, metabolic syndrome,
and cardiovascular risk factor definitions
Normal weight obesity was defined as subjects with a normal BMI
(18.5­24.9 kg/m2) and an excess in BF%, defined by the highest sex-
specific tertiles of BF% (.23.1% in men and .33.3% in women).
The updated ATP-III definition of metabolic syndrome17 was met
when three or more of the following criteria were present: (1) waist
circumference !102 cm in men and !88 cm in women; (2) HDL
,1.04 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in men and ,1.30 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in
women; (3) triglycerides !1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL) or specific treat-
ment for this lipid abnormality; (4) systolic blood pressure!130
mmHg or diastolic blood pressure !85 mmHg or treatment of pre-
viously diagnosed hypertension; and (5) fasting glucose !5.5 mmol/L
(100 mg/dL) or previously diagnosed diabetes. Subjects were con-
sidered to have dyslipidaemia if they reported current usage of lipid
medications, a self-reported diagnosis of hypercholesterolaemia, and/
or HDL-cholesterol ,1.04 mmol/L (40 mg/dL) in men and
,1.30 mmol/L (50 mg/dL) in women, and/or triglycerides
!1.7 mmol/L (150 mg/dL), and/or LDL-cholesterol !4.10 mmol/L
(160 mg/dL).32 Subjects were considered to be hypertensive if they
were taking antihypertensive medications or had a self-reported diag-
nosis of hypertension or if their systolic pressure was !140 mmHg or
diastolic pressure was !90 mmHg.33 Subjects were considered to
have diabetes if they reported current usage of anti-diabetic medi-
cations (insulin and oral medications), a self-reported diagnosis of
diabetes and/or if their fasting morning plasma glucose was

!7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL).34 Cardiovascular disease was defined as the
composite of self-reported history of myocardial infarction and
stroke.35 Subjects were considered as never or ever smokers (have
you ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes in your life?).
Total and cardiovascular mortality
assessment
NHANES III participants aged 17 years or older for whom data were
available for matching were matched to the National Death Index to
determine mortality status. The National Death Index was searched
through 31 December 2000, for follow-up. NHANES III and the
National Death Index are linked by probabilistic matching in the
NHANES III mortality study. The National Center for Health Statistics
conducted the linkage and created scores for potential matches. For a
selected sample of NHANES III records, the Center reviewed the
death certificate record to verify correct matches. Overall, 20 024
adult NHANES III participants were eligible for mortality follow-up
by linkage with the National Death Index, of whom 3384 were ident-
ified as deceased. A complete description of the methodology used to
link NHANES III records to the National Death Index can be found
elsewhere.36 Cardiovascular deaths were defined as those with
ICD-9 codes 390­398, 402, and 404­429 and ICD-10 codes I00­
I09, I11, I13, and I20­I51 (NHANES III codes 53­75). Person-months
of follow-up were calculated for each participant based on the end of
follow-up (date of death for those assumed deceased or 31 December
2000, for those assumed alive minus the date of the NHANES III exam-
ination). Mortality and CV mortality at follow-up were ascertained for
99% of our sample.
Statistical analyses
Data for anthropometric and cardiometabolic variables were summar-
ized by calculating means and standard errors for quantitative variables
and numbers and percentages for categorical variables. We used BF as
a continuous variable for the primary analysis in this study. For second-
ary analyses, we divided our sample of normal BMI subjects into sex-
specific tertiles of BF: low BF content (,18.65% in men and ,28.9%
in women); medium BF content (second tertile); and high BF content,
defined as NWO (.23.1% in men and .33.3% in women). We stra-
tified all our analyses by sex based on the biologic effect of this variable
on BF. All analyses were adjusted for age and race/ethnicity.
Only subjects with fasting and morning samples (n ¼ 2127) were
used for analyses of HOMA2, glucose, and metabolic syndrome. We
performed log transformation to reduce the skewness of HOMA2, tri-
glycerides, C-reactive protein, and leptin. We defined subjects as
having an elevated apoB/apoAI ratio, C-reactive protein, and leptin if
they were in the upper sex-specific quartile of these measurements.
We calculated the prevalence and P-values for trend (adjusted for
age and race) for metabolic syndrome, CV risk factors, and cardiome-
tabolic measures between BF groups at baseline. To assess the effects
of central obesity, we performed similar analyses using sex-specific ter-
tiles of waist circumference and used the lowest tertile as the refer-
ence combining men and women. After testing the linearity of the
association between BF% and metabolic syndrome, we used logistic
regression models adjusted for age and race to determine if there
was a dose response association between sex-specific quartiles of
BF% with insulin sensitivity (lowest quartile as the reference). We
applied Cox proportional hazard regression to estimate relations
between BF% as a continuous variable and sex-specific tertiles of
BF% with total and CV mortality for men and women (lowest tertile
used as the reference). Hazard ratios were calculated after adjusting
for age and race and smoking (model 1-reference), further adjustment
for waist circumference (model 2), waist-to-hip ratio (model 3), and
further adjustment for CV risk factors, namely dyslipidaemia, hyperten-
sion, diabetes, history of CV disease (model 4). The assumption of
hazard proportionality was confirmed by examining interactions of sur-
vival time and timed-dependent variables in Cox models. Finally, to
assess the generalizability of our results, we compared our selected
population of subjects with normal BMI with body composition ana-
lyses and blood measurement to subjects in NHANES who did not
have these measurements. A two-sided alpha of 0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All analyses were weighted according to
NHANES methodology and were performed using SAS version 9.1
and SUDAAN 9.0.3.
Results
Our study sample included 6171 subjects. Overall, weighted mean
age+standard error was 41.3+ 0.31 years. From the total
weighted sample, 77.7% were Non-Hispanic Whites, 9.4% were
Non-Hispanic Blacks, 4.1% were Mexican Americans, and 8.6%
were from a different ethnicity. The sample included in this study
had similar distributions for age, sex, race, and BMI in comparison
with the group excluded from the analysis that had a normal BMI
but did not undergo body composition and laboratory evaluations
(data not shown). All data are presented in our three pre-
established tertiles of BF and stratified by sex.
Cardiometabolic parameters according
to body fat
As age increased, the observed BF increased as well. After
controlling for sex, age, and race, each BF percent was significantly
associated with lower levels of HDL (b ¼ 20.0008 mmol/L,
P-value,0.0001) and higher levels of LDL (b ¼ 0.027 mmol/L,
P-value ,0.0001), triglycerides (b¼0.026 mmol/L, P-value
,0.0001), apoB/A-I ratio (b ¼ 0.011, P-value ,0.0001),
C-reactive protein (b¼1.02 mg/dL, P-value ,0.0001), and leptin
(b ¼ 1.15 ng/dL, P-value ,0.0001). The results were similar
when BF was categorized using sex-specific tertiles (Tables 1 and
2). In subjects with fasting morning blood samples (n ¼ 2127),
insulin sensitivity (HOMA-S) diminished progressively as BF
increased (b ¼ 22.78, P-value ,0.0001, Figure 1A and B). Similar
results were obtained for triglycerides (b ¼ 1.93 mg/dL, P-value
,0.0001) and insulin (b ¼ 0.97 mg/L, P-value ,0.0001), but not
for fasting blood glucose (b ¼ 0.0003 mg/dL per 1% increase of
BF, P-value 0.21).
Metabolic syndrome and cardiovascular
risk factors according to body fat
The prevalence of metabolic syndrome and of its individual com-
ponents increased as the BF content increased in men and
women (Tables 3 and 4). After adjusting for sex, age, and race/
ethnicity, BF was associated with higher odds of having metabolic
syndrome (OR ¼ 1.11, 95% CI 1.09­1.14, for each percent of
BF). With respect to CV risk factors, as BF increased, men had
higher prevalence of dyslipidaemia and hypertension (Table 3),
while in women, similar differences were observed in the preva-
lence of dyslipidaemia and CV disease (Table 4).

Total and cardiovascular mortality
according to body fat
After a median follow-up of 8.83 years (interquartile range 7.25­
10.33, 22 600 person-years), there were 787 deaths (34.64
deaths/1000 person-years), 470 in men (44.66 per 1000 man-
years) and 317 in women (11.65 per 1000 woman-years). Of
those, 337 were classified as CV deaths (14.91 CV deaths/1000
person-years), 195 in men (18.53 CV deaths/1000 man-years)
and 142 in women (5.22 CV deaths/1000 woman-years).
In men and women, total and CV mortality increased as BF
increased (Table 5). When BF was analysed as a continuous vari-
able, BF was neither associated with the risk of death in men
(HR 0.99, 95% CI 0.97­1.02) nor in women (HR 1.01, 95% CI
0.97­1.05). The lack of association was observed after adjusting
for dyslipidaemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, smoking
status, and waist circumference (HR in men 0.99, 95% CI 0.96­
1.02; HR in women 1.01, 95% CI 0.97­1.05). Similarly, when we
analysed mortality by tertiles, subjects with NWO were not at
an increased risk for total mortality compared with the lowest sex-
specific tertile of BF% (for men, HR ¼ 0.90; 95% CI, 0.63­1.27 and
for women HR 1.06, 95% CI 0.69­1.62, Table 5).
Interestingly, BF was associated with an increased risk for CV
mortality in women (HR 1.06 per each percent of BF, 95% CI
1.01­1.12) and the association was stronger after adjusting for
dyslipidaemia, hypertension, metabolic syndrome, smoking
status, and waist circumference (HR 1.07, 95% CI 1.01­1.14).
A similar association was found when we analysed CV mortality
in women using BF tertiles; NWO women were at significantly

higher risk for total CV mortality (HR 1.84, 95% CI 1.02­3.32).
This association prevailed even after further adjustment (HR
2.2, 95% CI 1.03­4.67, Table 5). In men, BF was neither associ-
ated with CV mortality as a continuous variable (adjusted HR
0.99, 95% CI 0.95­1.04) nor as sex-adjusted tertiles (adjusted
HR for NWO in men 1.07, 95% CI 0.67­1.72 when compared
with the lowest tertile).
Impact of central obesity on
cardiovascular risk and mortality
Figure 2A and B shows that sex-specific tertiles of waist circumfer-
ences were associated similarly to CV risk as sex-specific tertiles of
BF%, suggesting that waist circumference can also stratify the risk
for cardiometabolic dysregulation within subjects with a normal
BMI. However, in contrast with NWO, the highest sex-specific
tertile of waist circumference was not associated with an increased
risk for CV mortality in women (HR ¼ 1.42, 95% CI 0.69­2.94).
Furthermore, the association between NWO and CV mortality
in women was independent of waist circumference, as demon-
strated in multivariate models including waist circumference as a
covariate (Table 5). Additionally, waist circumference and
waist-to-hip ratio were not significantly associated with a higher
risk for total mortality in men or women.
Discussion
Metabolically obese normal weight subjects have been described since
the late 1990s.37 These subjects have been characterized as having
blunted insulin sensitivity and low lean mass despite having a
normal BMI, characteristics similar to subjects with NWO

but its prevalence has never been studied in the general popu-
lation. Results from our study suggest that NWO might be a key
factor in the emerging worldwide epidemic of obesity, metabolic
syndrome, diabetes, and coronary artery disease.
Our study shows that NWO is significantly associated with car-
diometabolic dysregulation and a high prevalence of metabolic syn-
drome, which is in fact, similar to the prevalence of metabolic
syndrome described in overweight subjects.38 Additionally, this is
the first study showing that in women, NWO is independently

associated with an increased risk for CV mortality. These findings
provide important insights into understanding obesity--subjects
who would otherwise considered non-obese, based on a normal
BMI, may actually have an excess in BF, and therefore be at
high risk for cardiometabolic dysregulation and CV mortality.
A normal BMI therefore does not necessarily imply protection
from consequences of increased BF.
Supporting our current observations, recent studies have
reported the presence of several metabolic abnormalities in
women with normal BMI with a medium-to-high BF content.
De Lorenzo et al.39 reported that 28 women with high BF
(.30%) had a significantly lower resting metabolic rate and
oxygen consumption, when compared with 20 women with
normal BMI and no excess in BF (,30%). Furthermore, in a
similar group of women (n ¼ 20), De Lorenzo et al.40 noted that
plasma levels of several inflammatory biomarkers, including
interleukins, and C-reactive protein were significantly higher in
women with a normal BMI but high BF content, supporting the
concept that subjects with NWO may be predisposed to
develop metabolic syndrome and CV disease.
Because bioimpedance does not give information about fat dis-
tribution, we explored the impact of central obesity in our results
by performing analyses using sex-specific tertiles of waist circum-
ference. Interestingly, an increased waist circumference (.87 cm
in men and .82 cm in women) was similarly associated with CV
risk as were sex-specific tertiles of BF% (Figure 2A and B). This
has important clinical implications because devices for measuring
BF are not widely available in clinical practice. In contrast, waist cir-
cumference can be easily and inexpensively measured. However, it
is important to note that an increased waist circumference was not
related to higher CV mortality as was BF content in subjects with
NWO and only 2% of men had central obesity according to the
ATP-III criterion. Thus, while central deposition of fat may play a
crucial role in cardiometabolic abnormalities,41 ­43 it does not
fully account for the higher risk for CV mortality noted in subjects
with NWO. Furthermore, we found that the higher CV mortality
noted in subjects with NWO remained significant, even after
adjustment for central obesity. Finally, the association between
NWO and CV mortality persisted in women, even after adjusting
for CV risk factors, several of which could be considered inter-
mediate mechanisms linking NWO and mortality.
Our study has several potential limitations. First, we used an
arbitrary cut-off for BF% based on tertiles to define NWO. The
harmful effects of an excess in BF very likely follow a continuum
rather than a specific threshold for acquiring clinically significant
cardiometabolic disturbances. Unfortunately, neither the World
Health Organization nor any major scientific society involved in
the study of obesity has defined a normal value for BF%. We
believe that the use of tertiles to classify those with a relatively
high BF% is more valid than using an arbitrary cut-off not pre-
viously validated. Second, misclassification could have occurred in
this study, as subjects could have had changes in their body com-
position during the follow-up period. However, this concern is
true for most epidemiologic studies that only use baseline

information on the exposure variable, including those evaluating
BMI. Third, bioelectrical impedance underestimates upper-body
obesity, especially in athletes and elderly patients.44 Other more
accurate methods to estimate BF%, such as hydrostatic weighing
or dual energy X-ray absorptiometry, may be preferable to esti-
mate body composition.45 Nevertheless, bioelectrical impedance's
acceptable accuracy, simplicity, lack of radiation, and relatively low
cost make it a practical and feasible alternative for measuring body
fatness, especially in large populations.46,47 Fourth, there were rela-
tively few CV events at follow-up in our sample, limiting the stat-
istical power to assess the relationship between NWO and
mortality. The low rate of events may have occurred because
our sample of normal weight subjects comprised a relatively
healthy, young group, with a mean age of just over 40 years.
Finally, due to the cross-sectional nature of our analyses linking
BF content to cardiometabolic dysregulation, we cannot establish
causality or directionality between these two factors. However,
numerous studies in different settings have shown that increases
in adiposity worsen most cardiometabolic measures, while adi-
posity reduction has been related to improvements in most cardi-
ometabolic markers.14,16 Furthermore, there is strong evidence
showing an association between metabolic syndrome and CV mor-
tality, supporting the notion that NWO may increase CV mortality
by increasing cardiometabolic dysregulation.
Implications
Based on the latest US census and obesity prevalence data, we esti-
mate that NWO is present in 30 million Americans, many of
whom may be unaware of their heightened cardiometabolic risk
despite their normal BMI. Because self awareness of a condition
is the initial step in behavioural modification and incorporation of
therapeutic lifestyle changes, it might be relevant to incorporate
BF measurement in the regular physical exam, using simple
methods to diagnose NWO in clinical practice. The cardiometa-
bolic dysregulation found in subjects with NWO, such as insulin
resistance, altered lipid profile, and metabolic syndrome are poten-
tially remediable if appropriately treated with diet, exercise, and
possibly pharmacological therapies.
Conclusions
Normal weight obesity is associated with significant cardiometa-
bolic dysregulation, including metabolic syndrome and CV risk
factors. Furthermore, NWO appears to be associated indepen-
dently with increased CV mortality in women. Screening for adi-
posity in subjects with a normal BMI could better identify those
at higher risk for cardiometabolic disturbances and CV mortality.
