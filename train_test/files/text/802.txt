Who Helps Employers Design
Their Health Insurance
Benefits?
More than half of employers use outside consultants when designing health
benefits, but this practice does not result in a different type of benefit
package.
by M. Susan Marquis and Stephen H. Long
Many specialists help employers
to design health insurance plans,
but little is known about the
number and characteristics of employers na-
tionwide that depend on these specialists to
help them make decisions. Moreover, we
know little about the relationship between
use of these specialists and the resulting char-
acteristics of health benefits plans.
Jon Christianson, in his case studies of em-
ployers' role in twelve community health sys-
tems, offers some hypotheses about the use of
outside advisers.1 He found that it was com-
mon for small employers to use "intermediar-
ies" in dealings with health plans, whereas
most large employers did not appear to use
them. In some communities purchasing coali-
tions, often sponsored by chambers of com-
merce, served small businesses, while in other
communities insurance brokers served the
small-employer market. This suggests that
purchasing coalitions and brokers may serve
as substitutes in helping small employers to
make decisions about health benefits. Regard-
less of the type of intermediary they used, em-
ployers saw the intermediary's role as helping
to locate low-cost insurance. Extrapolating
from this observation, we might expect that
other factors that lower the price or reduce
price variation in insurance--such as states'
small-group rating reforms--would reduce
employers' need for outside advisers.
The work of Deborah Garnick and col-
leagues on insurance agents in New Jersey,
while primarily focused on the individual
market, also offers some hypotheses about
outside advisers.2 They cite a national trend of
decline in the use of agents, resulting from the
growth in availability of managed care to
small employers and the fact that health
maintenance organizations (HMOs) do not
use agents as frequently as indemnity insurers
do. They also discuss the potential interaction
of insurance market reform and the use of
agents in the individual market. The stan-
dardized benefit packages, rating reforms,
and improved consumer information that are
often a part of insurance market reform
should mean that consumers (and, analo-
gously, employers in the small-group market)
will have less need for agents and brokers to
provide information and advice. Yet despite
the strict reforms in New Jersey's individual
market, 71 percent of new policyholders in the
individual market used an insurance agent.
Might we expect a similar result in the small-
group market?
This paper takes advantage of a new na-
tional survey of employers to address these
issues.

Methods
We used data from the 1997 Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Employer
Health Insurance Survey to measure the ex-
tent and effects of employers' use of outside
consultants in health insurance benefits deci-
sions. The survey interviewed 21,545 private
employers throughout the nation, drawn from
the Dun's Market Identifiers national census
of employment establishments. The sample
was concentrated in the sixty
communities followed by the
RWJF Community Tracking
Study and in twelve states
having significant small-group
insurance reforms.3 Within
geographic units the samples
were further allocated to strata
defined by the number of
workers at the establishment.
The sample establishments
were weighted for these analy-
ses to represent all private em-
ployment establishments in the continental
United States that have at least one employee
and that offer insurance.
Data were collected by computer-assisted
telephone interviews averaging thirty min-
utes each. The interview was conducted with
the person or persons in each establishment
most knowledgeable about health benefits
and firm and worker characteristics. The re-
sponse rate was 60 percent.
n Outside consultants. A number of spe-
cialized concepts and definitions are used in
this work. We asked all employers that offer
insurance, "Are the decisions regarding your
health insurance benefits based on input pri-
marily from internal staff, primarily outside
consultants, or both?" We then classified em-
ployers as basing decisions on input from in-
ternal staff only or on input from external
consultants, the latter including businesses
using primarily outsiders and those using
both internal and external parties. When ex-
ternal consultants were used, we further clas-
sified employers by the type of outsider used:
insurance agent or broker, third-party admin-
istrator (TPA), or professional benefits con-
sultant. We emphasize that the focus of these
questions was on substantive decision mak-
ing about the design of benefits. An employer
might answer "internal staff only" but use an
insurance agent or broker to arrange for the
purchase of a health plan.
Although the sample and analysis unit is
the establishment--a physical location of
business--for many analyses we categorized
establishments according to the size of the
firm, which includes employees at all loca-
tions nationwide. Insurance
decisions typically are made at
a regional or national level for
firms with several estab-
lishments.
n Employer character-
istics. We classified employers
as self-insured if they offer at
least one self-insured plan,
based on the respondent's as-
sessment.4 Several other classi-
fications were based on the re-
spondent's self-assessment,
including participation in a pooled purchas-
ing arrangement and whether a plan is an
HMO.5
Employers are classified as "offering a
choice of plans" if they offer two or more
plans, whether of the same or a different type
and whether through the same or different
carriers. We grouped employers as "carving
out" special benefits--specifically, mental
health or prescription drugs--if they offer a
separate single-service plan for these benefits
or if they separately contract for these benefits
with specialized providers as part of their
self-insured plan. Employers offering a choice
of plans were classified as "incorporating
managed competition incentives" if they pay
the same dollar amount for single coverage
under each plan, with the employee paying
the full difference between the total premium
and the employer amount. This provides em-
ployees with an incentive to choose lower-
price plans.
n Quality. We also report whether em-
ployers shop for quality in the plans they
choose to offer and whether employees are
"There is no sys-
tematic relation-
ship between the
use of external
consultants and
employers' plan
costs."

provided with comparative quality informa-
tion to facilitate their choice of plan. The sur-
vey collected these data only for firms having
500 or more employees nationwide. For the
latter variable the respondents were further
restricted to firms offering a choice of plans.
The specific types of information considered
for these variables are enrollee satisfaction
ratings and plan performance measures.
n Premium levels. We measured both
the current health insurance premium level
and the change since the past year. The cur-
rent premium level is based on plan-specific
data, reported separately for single and family
rates. Some employers offer coverage for spe-
cial services, such as dental care or prescrip-
tion drugs, in plans that are separate from the
general medical plan. We constructed premi-
ums for the package of benefits offered by
adding together the premiums paid for the
general medical plan and the plans covering
special services.6 We adjusted the reported
premiums to control for differences in the
quantity of coverage provided by different es-
tablishments--that is, we report a "quantity-
adjusted" premium.7 The measure of change
since the past year is based on an estab-
lishment-level question about change in total
health insurance cost per enrollee since the
previous year.
n State small-group reform. Finally, we
classified establishments by the degree of
small-group reform in their state, measured as
the interaction of whether all insurance prod-
ucts must be guarantee issued and how
tightly premium rates are regulated, if at all.
We define three classes: high (all products are
guaranteed issue, and rates cannot be based
on health status, as well as limited or no age
variation), medium (all products are guaran-
teed issue, and rates cannot be based on
health status, but no or limited restriction on
age variation), or low (everything less restric-
tive or no restrictions).8
We explore the relationship between
whether external consultants participated in
employers' decision making and the charac-
teristics of the health insurance plans offered
by employers. We caution that even if an as-
sociation is found, the direction of causation
is not clear. On the one hand, any difference
might be the result of the advice offered by the
external consultant. On the other hand, it
could just as easily reflect the fact that em-
ployers that are inclined to choose a particular
plan feature will seek the advice of outsiders
with expertise to help them to achieve their
goal.
Results
Fifty-four percent of all employers nation-
wide use external consultants to help make
decisions about health benefits (Exhibit 1).
Employers' reliance on outside experts in-
creases with firm size. While fewer than half
of employers with fewer than twenty-five em-
ployees rely on input from external sources,
nearly two-thirds of those with 500 or more
employees involve consultants in their deci-
sion-making process.
n Determinants of consultant type.
Among employers depending on external con-
sultants, both the type of specialist and
whether more than one type is used vary with
firm size (Exhibit 1). Small employers (fewer
than 100 employees) generally use only one
type of outside adviser, and this consultant is
nearly always an insurance agent or broker.
Even when more than one type is consulted,
an agent or broker is generally involved in the
decisions. Medium-size businesses (100­499
employees) also show considerable reliance
on agents and brokers, but they are more
likely to call on others in addition. TPAs are
more likely to be used by self-insured employ-
ers. Large employers (500 workers or more)
show a greater tendency to rely on benefits
consultants to help with health insurance de-
cisions, both exclusively and in combination
with others.
It may seem surprising that fewer than half
of all small businesses report using an agent or
broker to design their benefit plan. However,
employers' responses to this survey may not
reflect whether insurance was purchased
through an agent--an insured health plan
typically can only be obtained from a licensed
agent. Rather, the results likely indicate em-

ployers' perceptions of the sources of informa-
tion they use in planning the type, scope, and
breadth of benefits to offer.
We expected that use of external sources
of information might be more common among
employers that were redesigning their insur-
ance benefit package or designing it for the
first time. However, only among large employ-
ers was there evidence that external sources
were used more frequently if a recent change
had been made in the benefit package. Among
employers with 500 or more workers, 84 per-
cent that had changed their offerings in the
past year used consultants, in contrast to 61
percent of other large employers.
We also looked for evidence that partici-
pation in purchasing alliances or other forms
of pooled purchasing might substitute as a
source of information, and thus employers us-
ing these purchasing mechanisms would be
less likely to report using agents, brokers, or
other third parties in designing their benefit
plans. However, those in purchasing alliances
or other purchasing pools were as likely as
employers not participating in pools were to
report using external sources (not shown).
n Plan characteristics and use of con-
sultants. We found little association between
plan characteristics and the participation of
external consultants in the decision-making
process (Exhibit 2).9 Contrary to the notion
that growth of managed care obviates the need
for agents and brokers, we found essentially
the same rate of offering an HMO among em-
ployers that use internal staff only as among
those that use outside consultants in three of
four size groups.
Employers using external consultants are
somewhat more likely to offer a choice of
plans. On the other hand, the association with
carving out a special benefit, incorporating
managed competition incentives, and using
quality measurement is either inconsistent
across the size groups or is not in the ex-
pected direction. There is no systematic rela-
tionship between the use of external consult-
ants and employers' plan costs, whether
measured by current premiums or change
over the past year.
n Effect of small-group reforms. In
states with the strongest small-group insur-
ance reforms there is somewhat less use of
consultants by small businesses than in states
with medium or low reforms (Exhibit 3). This
is not a reflection of the general patterns in
these groups of states, as indicated by the esti-
mates for larger businesses. Nonetheless, out-
siders are still used by more than 40 percent of
employers in these states. Therefore, even
with reforms that guarantee access and limit

price variability, a sizable share of employers
apparently believe that they need help in ac-
quiring information about options and choos-
ing the right plan or plans.
Discussion
The use of outsiders to help design health
benefits is extensive, and it occurs across all
sizes of businesses. In fact, the use of outside
consultants is more prominent among large
businesses than small ones, in contrast to re-
ports from studies of selected communities.
Contrary to our expectations, there is not
nearly as much difference in the charac-
teristics of health benefits between employers
that use internal staff only and those that use
external consultants. That is, their involve-
ment does not seem to make a difference, at
least in the observable characteristics we
measured. However, there may be more subtle
differences that we could not observe. Appar-
ently, the majority of employers would rather
pay outside consultants to acquire informa-
tion and design plans than to use internal re-
sources for this process, even though resul-
tant plan designs do not differ.

Our findings suggest that small-group re-
form may permit some employers to stop us-
ing outside consultants. These results come
only a few years after the reforms were passed,
however. This is an area that deserves to be
monitored over time as state regulations con-
tinue to evolve and as employers and markets
have more experience under them.

chased from an insurance company or HMO, or
is it a self-insured plan?" For further discussion

5. All establishments that offer insurance were
asked, "Does your company purchase health in-
surance through: a health insurance purchasing
cooperative or alliance; a business coalition; a
multiple employer trust or a multiple employer
welfare association; or a trade or professional as-
sociation or other membership organization?"

6. For establishments offering multiple plans, we
computed an average premium for the estab-
lishment by weighting the premiums for the
separate plans by the number of enrollees.
7. To do this, we measured the actuarial value of
the plan benefits by estimating the expected
share of a standardized expenditure distribution
each plan would cover. The adjusted premium
was then measured as the observed premium
multiplied by the ratio of the average share of
benefits paid by all plans to the expected share of
benefits paid by this plan.

medium groups.
9. The estimates control for firm size because both
the likelihood of using external participants and
the characteristics themselves are correlated
with firm size.
