Abstract
Objective: The rs10229583 polymorphism near paired box gene 4 (PAX4) is associated with
insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes. Mutations in the PAX4 gene may be associated with impaired
differentiation/development of pancreatic islet beta cells during fetal development and, conse-
quently, a compromised insulin response to high blood glucose. To ascertain whether this
polymorphism plays a role in gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM), we investigated the genotypic
and allele frequency differences between GDM and normal pregnancies.
Methods: A total of 310 GDM and 440 normal pregnancies were evaluated. Allele and genotype
frequencies of rs10229583 were determined for all participants with Sanger sequencing and
SNaPshot. Association of the allele and genotypes of the single nucleotide polymorphism with the
disease was analyzed using Pearson's 2 test and OR (odds ratio).
Results: The G allele was more frequent in patients with GDM compared with controls
(OR ¼ 1.47, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.12­1.939). The GG genotype frequency of rs10229583
was significantly different between subjects with GDM and normal controls (OR ¼ 1.411, 95% CI:
1.032­1.928). The OR of the GA þGG genotype was 3.182 (95% CI: 1.294­7.826) for patients with
GDM compared with controls.
Conclusion: The present study suggests that rs10229583 is associated with GDM.

Introduction
Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is
defined as glucose intolerance first diag-
nosed during pregnancy and is associated
with increased risk of preeclampsia, peri-
natal mortality of the fetus and type 2
diabetes (T2D) development.1 During preg-
nancy, women experience increased periph-
eral insulin resistance, which is explained, in
part, by increased production of estrogen,
human placental lactogen and prolactin.2­4
To maintain glucose homeostasis, insulin
secretion is increased. GDM occurs in cases
where insulin secretion fails to compensate
for insulin resistance. Women with a history
of GDM are at a higher risk of developing
T2D later in life.5 GDM and T2D are
multifactorial disorders with a common
pathogenesis. The diseases share several
features, including pancreatic beta-cell dys-
function, insulin resistance and association
with similar risk factors. A variety of risk
factors, including obesity, family history,
lifestyle, ethnicity, genetics and physical
inactivity, contribute to the development of
both GDM and T2D.6 Earlier studies
strongly supported the possibility that
GDM and T2D share the same genetic
background. Over the past few decades,
numerous studies have focused on the iden-
tification of accumulating genetic variants
that are strongly associated with T2D.7
The rs10229583 polymorphism is located
downstream of the paired box gene 4
(PAX4) gene, which is located on chromo-
some 7q32 and belongs to a family of
transcription factors. The gene plays an
important role in the differentiation and
development of pancreatic islet beta cells
during fetal development.8,9 A number of
investigations to date have identified
rs10229583 near PAX4 as a locus for
T2D.10 However, little is known about its
potential association with GDM. Based on
these findings, we hypothesized that the
rs10229583 single nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) is associated with predisposition to
GDM. Therefore, PAX4 may be a novel
target candidate gene for GDM therapy.
In the current study, we examined the
genetic, clinical and biochemical differences
between GDM and normal pregnancies
according to the Strengthening the
Reporting of Genetic Association Studies
initiative.11 We aimed to clarify the relation-
ship between rs10229583 and GDM as well
as its association with clinical and biochem-
ical parameters. Our results may provide
better insights into the mechanisms under-
lying PAX4 gene variations in the develop-
ment of GDM.
Materials and methods
Subjects
The 310 patients with GDM and 440 normal
pregnancy subjects selected for study were of
Han Chinese ethnic origin. Between 2010
and 2014, subjects were recruited from the
International Peace Maternity and Child
Health Hospital affiliated with the Medical
School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University
and Bao'an Maternal and Child Health
Hospital, Shenzhen, China. No previous
diagnosis of chronic hypertension, type 1
or type 2 diabetes, infection, renal dysfunc-
tion, rheumatoid arthritis or systemic lupus
erythematosus was reported in any case.
GDM diagnosis was performed according
to the International Association of the
Diabetes and Pregnancy Study Groups
criteria,12 which later was also imple-
mented by the World Health Organization

pdf). Our study protocol was in accordance
with institutional ethic guidelines and
national laws. Informed written consent
was obtained from all subjects. This study
was approved by the Ethics Committees of
the International Peace Maternity and Child
Health Hospital affiliated with the Medical
School of Shanghai Jiao Tong University
and Bao'an Maternal and Child Health
Hospital and conducted in accordance with
the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki.
Study protocol
All subjects underwent a 75-g oral glucose
tolerance test between 24 and 28 weeks of
gestation to screen for GDM. Subjects were
examined in the morning after a 12-h over-
night fast between 08:30 and 09:30. Plasma
glucose levels were measured at 0, 1 and 2 h
during the glucose challenge. GDM was
diagnosed in cases where one of the glucose
values met or exceeded the threshold. Body
mass index (BMI) for all pregnancies before
delivery was calculated as the ratio of weight
(kg) to the square of height (m2).13 Large,
appropriate and small for gestational age
rates were recorded. Biochemical data,
including plasma glucose, glycosylated
hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) and triglyceride
levels, were additionally measured in all
cases.
Genotyping
Genomic DNA samples were extracted from
peripheral whole blood using the TIANamp
Blood DNA kit (TIANGEN Biotech,
Beijing, China). Genotyping was performed
using SNaPshot (ABI Prism SNaPShot
multiplex kit; Applied Biosystems) on an
ABI PRISM 3730 genetic analyzer accord-
ing to the manufacturer's instructions and
evaluated using ABI GeneScan software.
Approximately 15% of the samples in our
study were sequenced using an ABI PRISM
3730 genetic analyzer to reconfirm genotype.
Reproducibility of data was 100%. The
proportion of technically successful geno-
typing out of all samples assessed for geno-
type was 98%.
Primers for amplification were designed
using Primer3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/). All
primers were synthesized by Sangon Biotech
Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China). Fragments of
the variant were amplified from 100 ng DNA
in a 20-ml reaction mixture containing
50 mmol MgCl2
, 50 mmol dNTP, 1 mM for-
ward primer, 1 mM reverse primer and 0.5 U
Taq polymerase (TaKaRa). A touchdown
PCR program was used according to the
manufacturer's instructions. The primer
sequences for PCR amplification were as
follows: forward 50-CAACAGTGCTGCCT
ATTCCC-30 and reverse 50-TAGGAAAGG
AGATGCCCTCA-30.
Statistical analysis
Statistical analyses were performed using
the Statistical Package for the Social
Sciences Windows version 17.0 (SPSS Inc.,
Chicago, IL, USA). Continuous variables
were expressed as mean Æ standard devi-
ation and compared using the Student's
t-test. Association of the allele and genotype
of the SNP with the disease was analyzed
using Pearson's 2 test and OR (odds ratio).
Deviation from Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium was assessed using the Chi-square test.
All tests were two-sided, and a value of
p < 0.05 was accepted as statistically
significant.

differences in gestational age or neonatal
birth weight were observed between subjects
with GDM and normal controls. BMI,
maternal age and concentrations of plasma
glucose, HbA1c and triglycerides were sig-
nificantly higher in subjects with GDM
compared with those of normal controls
(p < 0.05).
Genotyping and allelic frequencies
Genotypes were in Hardy­Weinberg equi-
librium for all subjects. The distributions of
genotypes and allelic frequencies are pre-
sented in Table 2. The genotypes of
rs10229583 were AA, GA and GG, with
frequencies of 1.93% (6/310), 27.10%
(84/310) and 70.96% (220/310) in subjects
with GDM and 5.91% (26/440), 30.68%
(135/440) and 63.41% (279/440) in normal
controls, respectively. The A and G allele
frequencies were 15.48% (96/620) and
84.52% (524/620) in patients with GDM
and 21.25% (187/880) and 78.75% (693/
880) in control subjects, respectively.
The G allele was associated with GDM
risk (OR ¼ 1.47, 95% CI: 1.12­1.939,
p < 0.005) (Table 2). The OR of the
GA þ GG genotype was 3.182 (95% CI:
1.294­7.826, p ¼ 0.008), and that of the GG
genotype was 1.411 (95% CI: 1.032­1.928,
p ¼ 0.031) for patients with GDM compared

Association of rs10229583 with clinical
and biochemical characteristics in subjects
with GDM
Association analysis of the rs10229583 SNP
with clinical and biochemical characteristics
in subjects with GDM revealed no signifi-
cant differences between the AA, GA and GG
genotypes in terms of BMI, large/appropri-
ate/small for gestational age status or
plasma glucose, HbA1c or triglyceride
levels (Table 3).
Discussion
GDM is a multifactorial disease caused by
the complex interplay of multiple genetic,
environmental and immunologic fac-
tors.14­17 As GDM appears to share the
same genetic background as T2D, candidate
genes for GDM have been identified based
on those associated with T2D. A number of
genetic variants related to T2D are also
reported to be associated with GDM.18
Several genome-wide association studies
have suggested that mutations or poly-
morphisms in PAX4 are associated with
both type 1 and 2 diabetes.19­20 To clarify
whether PAX4 is linked to GDM, we
evaluated the possible association between
the rs10229583 locus and GDM for the first
time in this study.
Consistent with earlier findings, BMI and
plasma glucose, HbA1c and triglyceride
concentrations were significantly higher in
subjects with GDM compared with those of
normal controls. However, neonatal birth
weight did not differ between subjects with
GDM and normal controls. All pregnant
women diagnosed with GDM in the clinic
underwent diet and exercise therapy to
ensure that weight before delivery and new-
born birth weight were effectively con-
trolled. Pharmacological therapy was also

priate blood glucose control.
Our data revealed a significant associ-
ation of the rs10229583 SNP with GDM. In
particular, the G allele may be a risk factor
for development of the disease. The relative
risk for GA þ GG was 3.182 (95% CI: 1.294­
7.826, p ¼ 0.008), while that for GG was
1.411 (95% CI: 1.032­1.928, p ¼ 0.031) for
patients with GDM. The rs10229583 poly-
morphism is located downstream of PAX4.
While several studies to date have focused
on the effects of PAX4 in the pathogenesis of
T2D, to the best of our knowledge, none
have addressed its potential association with
GDM. PAX4 is a transcription factor
belonging to the PAX family of proteins
that contains a paired box domain, a paired-
type homeodomain and an octapeptide
involved in fetal development and tumor
growth. PAX4 is expressed in early pancre-
atic endocrine cells, which is necessary for
differentiation, development, proliferation
and insulin secretion of pancreatic islet
beta cells. The protein stimulates the expres-
sion of PDX1, a key transcription factor for
islet development.21,22 Targeted disruption
of PAX4 in mice has been shown to reduce
beta-cell mass at birth. Shimajiri et al.
reported that the R121W mutation in
PAX4 is significantly associated with
T2D.11 Ma and colleagues identified an
association of rs10229583 near PAX4 with
elevated fasting plasma glucose and
impaired beta-cell function in controls and
earlier age at diagnosis in Chinese popula-
tions.23 Moreover, the rs10229583 locus was
associated with T2DM in a Mongolian
population in China.24
To determine the functional implications
of the rs10229583 SNP in GDM, we per-
formed an association analysis between
these variants and biochemical characteris-
tics. Notably, the GG genotype of
rs10229583, the risk variant for GDM, was
not associated with BMI, neonatal birth
weight or plasma glucose, HbA1c or
triglyceride levels. Further research is
required to elucidate the precise mechanisms
by which these loci contribute to GDM
susceptibility.
In conclusion, rs10229583 near PAX4 has
been identified as a novel locus associated
with GDM in Chinese populations, provid-
ing further insights into the pathogenesis of
this disease.
