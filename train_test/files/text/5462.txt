Little is documented on Botswana's university students'
intentions to seek psychological help and/or their attitudes
toward seeking psychological help. This is despite the World
Health Organization's (WHO) estimations that in 2001
alone, 121 million people suffered from depression; 24 mil-
lion suffered from schizophrenia; 70 million were affected
by alcohol use disorders; and 5 million were negatively
affected by drug use disorders. While these statistics are
global, they still suggest that in a lifetime, any individual
may suffer from a mental disorder, come into contact with
someone with a mental disorder, and/or have to care for
someone with a mental disorder. The statistics also suggest
that individuals need knowledge to realize when they or oth-
ers may be suffering from psychological disorders, and to
know when to seek help or to advice their close others to
seek help. Such need is also exacerbated by research that
suggest that university students are a high-risk population for
mental health illness problems (Ryan, Shochet, & Stallman,
2010) as being at university may present threats to the stu-
dent's emotional well-being (Wittenberg, 2001).
In Botswana, this might be worsened by the generally
negative historical views of mental illness (Seloilwe &
Thupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007) and the fact that a large
number of students in Botswana have to relocate from
many different remote areas to the capital city for their uni-
versity education. Such migrations, coupled with interac-
tions with new groups of people, loss of contact with
familiar people, and changing environmental conditions
(Sabone, 2009) may further add to the challenges students
face as they adapt to the new environments (i.e., the city
and university environments).
The University of Botswana is the largest university in
Botswana, and like many universities across the world, it has
a counseling service for the students. While existence of such
facilities should be applauded, researchers have reported
that, generally, few university students seek professional
help when experiencing problems (Wade, Post, Cornish,
Vogel, & Tucker, 2011). This makes it important for research-
ers and practitioners to investigate factors that may facilitate
or inhibit intentions to seek psychological help.

Predicting Intentions to Seek
Psychological Help Among Botswana
University Students: The Role of Stigma
and Help-Seeking Attitudes

Abstract
The current study had two main objectives. The first was to investigate Botswana's university students' intentions to seek
psychological help. The second was to investigate whether (a) Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help
(ATSPPH), (b) Self-Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH), and (c) Social Stigma of Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH) predicted
the students' intentions to seek psychological help. A total of N = 519 (283 females and 236 males) students from the
University of Botswana completed the survey. Results indicated that generally, the students had moderate intentions of seeking
psychological help. Multiple regression analysis revealed that of the three predictors, only ATSPPH and SSRPH significantly
predicted intentions to seek psychological help. The current study is important because while it has been established that
university students are a high-risk population for mental health problems, there is close to nothing documented on university
students in Botswana. Findings of the current study will undoubtedly increase knowledge relating to psychological help-seeking
and its predictors in Botswana and may inform interventions that aim to encourage young people to seek psychological or
counseling help.

In line with the currently ongoing debate about the possi-
bility of indigenizing psychology in the African context
(Moll, 2002), there is a need to address the issue of why
knowledge documented elsewhere about stigma and help-
seeking behaviors might not be adequate to address the chal-
lenges specific to a country like Botswana. Furthermore,
Mpofu (2002) also noted the benefits of including and docu-
menting African experiences in the literature of psychology,
arguing that it will not only enrich the discipline, but will
also make it globally relevant. The current study is important
more so that psychology is a fairly new discipline in
Botswana. For example, to the knowledge of the authors, the
only existing psychology department (i.e., a university teach-
ing department) in the whole country was only established in
2004 at the University of Botswana (www.ub.bw).
According to Plattner and Moagi-Gulubane (2010), it was
observed that the majority of counseling services in commu-
nities around Botswana were being offered by individuals
who were not specifically trained as psychologists. To bridge
the gap in the provision of these essential services, the
BPsych program at the University of Botswana was tailored
to provide the graduates with skills that would enable them
to work as professionals under supervision. However, a lot
remains to be done in terms of educating the public and get-
ting them to appreciate the need to seek psychological help.
Outside Botswana, factors contributing to people's reluc-
tance to seek psychological help include stigmatization of
mental illnesses (Corrigan, 2004; Narikiyo & Kameoka,
1992), emotional openness (Komiya, Good, & Sherrod,
2000), self-reliance (Tata & Leong, 1994), and age (Currin,
Hayslip, Schneider, & Kooken, 1998), while others include
fear (Kushner & Sher, 1989), a person's outcome expecta-
tions (Fischer, Jome, & Atkinson, 1998; Halgin, Weaver,
Edell, & Spencer, 1987; Kim, Ng, & Ahn, 2005; Vogel,
Wester, Wei, & Boysen, 2005), gender (Addis & Mahalik,
2003; Pederson & Vogel, 2007; Tata & Leong, 1994), one's
discomfort with self-disclosing information (Vogel & Wester,
2003), and one's cultural orientation (Tata & Leong, 1994).
While these factors may also be significant in Botswana, this
has not been confirmed through research. Specific to
Botswana, the challenges may include preferences of other
sources of intervention such as traditional doctors, family,
and religious leaders. For instance, it has been documented
that irrespective of the level of education and social status,
Batswana continues to seek help from traditional healers
(Stockton, Nitza, & Bhusumane, 2010). Furthermore, the
need for understanding university students' intentions of
seeking psychological help and/or their attitudes toward seek-
ing psychological help is further heightened by the Botswana's
HIV/AIDS challenges, alcohol and drug problems, high
unemployment rate, and the scourge of "passion killings."
In line with the above-mentioned gap in research, the cur-
rent study was an exploratory study with two main objec-
tives. The first was to investigate Botswana's university
students' intentions of seeking psychological help. The
second was to investigate whether (a) Attitude Toward
Seeking Professional Psychological Help (ATSPPH), (b)
Self-Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH), and (c) Social Stigma
of Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH) predicted the stu-
dents' intentions to seek psychological help. The findings of
the current study might also inform human services pro-
grams, the educational programs, researchers, and practitio-
ners, and also enable them to have targeted programs that
encourage help-seeking behaviors for university students in
Botswana and in other similar countries.
Theoretical Background
Intentions to Seek Counseling
Research suggests that there are many factors that may
affect one's decision to seek help when faced with a psycho-
logical problem. Furthermore, it has been noted that inten-
tion is one of the good predictors of such behavior (e.g.,
Bathje & Pryor, 2011). As suggested by Mechanic (1966),
the care-seeking process can be influenced by social and
cultural factors. Others added that personal and agency fac-
tors (i.e., factors relating to counseling services such as the
service and the counselor) may also affect intentions
(Fischer, Winer, & Abramowitz, 1983; Setiawan, 2006).
Seloilwe and Thupayagale-Tshweneagae (2007) further
added that care of the mentally ill in most societies takes
place within complex historical, economic, political, social,
and cultural contexts, pointing to the need to investigate fac-
tors that may facilitate help-seeking behaviors in different
socio-economic-cultural-political contexts.
The current study focused on Botswana university stu-
dents because researchers have also highlighted problems in
accessing mental health services (Kurtz & Street, 2006) and
on the decision to seek mental health services for individuals
from minority ethnic groups and university students. It is
also important to understand the reception of mental health
services in contexts like Botswana where the treatment
modalities, the practices, and the approaches used in psycho-
therapy are mostly imported from the Western world. It is
noteworthy that Botswana has transformed from a society
that solely associated mental disorders with witchcrafts and/
or possession of bad spirits to a society that has recognized
the need for counseling centers and mental hospitals
(Seloilwe & Thupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007).
Studies conducted elsewhere have consistently revealed
that many individuals who could potentially benefit from psy-
chological services do not seek help or follow-through with
treatment (Corrigan, 2004; Jorm, 2000). This makes it impor-
tant for Botswana practitioners and researchers to understand
some of the barriers to seek counseling or any other related
mental health services within Botswana. Pepin, Segal, and
Coolidge (2009) classified barriers associated with seeking
and utilizing mental health services into intrinsic barriers (i.e.,
barriers that operate within an individual) and extrinsic
Pheko et al. 3
barriers (i.e., barriers that operate outside of an individual).
The current study focused on intrinsic factors only that
included a negative view of mental disorders, stigma associ-
ated with seeking or receiving mental health services, or lim-
ited knowledge about the potential benefits of psychotherapy.
While it is understood that having intentions to seek treatment
is a different process, distinct from actually contacting the
mental service providers (Saunders, 1993), the current study
only measured students' intentions to seek counseling and
factors that might influence such a process. Given the
Batswana's general negative cultural and historical views of
the mentally ill (Seloilwe & Thupayagale-Tshweneagae,
2007), it was predicted that university students may have low
intentions of seeking psychological help.
Attitudes Toward Seeking Psychological Help
Greenwald and Banaji (1995) defined attitudes as favorable
or unfavorable dispositions toward an attitude object, such
as people, places, and policies. They further explained that
positive correlations have been established between mea-
sured attitudes and the favorable aspects of observed behav-
ior. It has also been revealed that people from ethnic or
minority groups are likely to hold negative and stigmatizing
attitudes toward mental disorders and the mentally ill
(Papadopoulos, Leavey, & Vincent, 2002). Moreover, peo-
ple who have little knowledge and contact with the mentally
ill are likely to hold even stronger negative attitudes toward
people with mental disorders (Papadopoulos et al., 2002).
Other studies have revealed that such negative attitudes
toward help-seeking are strongly related to lower intentions
to seek counseling (e.g., Bathje & Pryor, 2011). Specifically,
negative attitudes toward help-seeking have been found to
reduce the likelihood of using mental health care services
and the likelihood of perceiving the need to seek psycho-
logical help (Mojtabai, Olfson, & Mechanic, 2002).
Stigma in Seeking and Receiving Psychological
Help
Researchers have also revealed that stigma associated with
mental disorders may be one of the key factors that inhibit
individuals from seeking help from mental help profession-
als (Saunders, 1993; Vogel, Wade, & Haake, 2006). This is
because being diagnosed with a psychological disorder and
the actual act of seeking treatment appear to be stigmatizing
(Ben-Porath, 2002). For example, in one study, Kurtz and
Street (2006) revealed the participants' fear of the stigma
surrounding mental health and also the effect of such stigma
on young people's reluctance to discuss their challenges
with individuals they did not know or did not trust. In coun-
tries like Botswana, even families with persons who show
signs of any mental disorder may also be stigmatized, which
may lead them to avoid seeking the necessary assistance for
fear of being either labeled or ostracized (Seloilwe &
Thupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007). According to Corrigan
and Watson (2002), different components or types of stigma
are commonly present in the general public, and even in the
stigmatized individuals. For instance, individuals may
expect to be socially rejected before they receive psycho-
logical help, or actually experience social rejection after
participating in mental health treatment (Link, 1987;
Verhaeghe, Bracke, & Christiaens, 2010). They may then
consequently engage in self-rejection or self-stigma (i.e.,
experience shame and feelings of inferiority as a result of
receiving or seeking mental health service; Verhaeghe et al.,
2010). Corrigan (2004) differentiated between public stigma
(we also referred to this type of stigma as social stigma) and
self-stigma, and other researchers have also emphasized the
need to study multiple dimensions and multiple outcomes of
stigma experiences (e.g., Verhaeghe et al., 2010). Therefore,
in the current study, the impact of public/social stigma and
self-stigma on the intentions of seeking psychological help
were investigated separately.
Public/SSRPH
The public/social stigma is influenced by the societal
response to people who seek or receive help for psychologi-
cal distress (Bathje & Pryor, 2011). This type of stigma may
be viewed as a form of prejudice comprising affective,
behavioral, and cognitive reactions to the individual seeking
psychological help (Corrigan et al., 2005). Furthermore, it
may involve the actual negative stereotypes and/or discrimi-
nating behaviors against the stigmatized individuals
(Corrigan, 2004), or in some instances, the awareness of
responses to people with mental disorders or people who
seek mental health services. People with mental disorders
may be viewed as dangerous (Crisp, Gelder, Rix, Meltzer, &
Rowlands, 2000), embarrassing, socially disagreeable
(Coolidge, Mincic, & O'Riley, 2005), and/or even responsi-
ble for their own illnesses (Corrigan et al., 2005). Social
stigma associated with seeking or receiving psychological
help does not only affect those diagnosed or perceived as
mentally ill. For instance, Lefley (1989) and Corrigan,
Watson, and Miller (2006) suggested that stigmatization of
the mentally ill generalizes to their family members because
of social barriers that are erected against the relatives and
households of the mentally ill. Corrigan, Watson, et al.
(2006) further explained that the behaviors of persons with
psychotic disorders may also diminish the family's reputa-
tion, and jeopardize relationships with friends and neighbors.
Therefore, a negative relationship between social stigma of
seeking psychological help and intentions of seeking profes-
sional psychological help was expected.
SSOSH
The self-stigma is the individual self-labeling that can nega-
tively impact one's participation in society at large (Holmes
4 SAGE Open
& River, 1998). Self-stigma has also been shown to nega-
tively impact one's perceived self-worth, self-esteem, and
has also been linked to outcomes such as depression and
reluctance to seek help (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr, 2006;
Holmes & River, 1998; Link & Phelan, 2001). Bathje and
Pryor (2011) conceptualized it as the internalized impact of
social stigma. Accordingly, Holmes and River (1998) sug-
gested that adequate help of individuals coping with mental
disorders should involve addressing societal and self-stigma.
Kroska and Harkness (2008) explained that self-stigma
works in such a way that when an individual is first diag-
nosed with a mental illness, cultural ideas and stereotypes
that have been linked with the mental illness or the mentally
ill individuals become personally relevant and promote neg-
ative self-feelings. Thereafter, the individual expects others
to reject him/her, in turn, triggering defensive behaviors
aimed at preventing the rejection. Such defensive behaviors
may include: hiding one's treatment history, withdrawing
from social interaction, and/or teaching others about mental
illness. Such conceptualization of self-stigma suggests that
awareness and endorsement of public/social stigma are nec-
essary to generate self-stigma (Corrigan, Watson, & Barr,
2006). Overall, understanding stigma is important for
researchers and practitioners as it gives insights into why
individuals with significant life problems may be hesitant to
seek professional help (Vogel et al., 2006). As a result of the
above discussions, the following hypothesis were formulated
and tested:
Hypothesis 1: Students will report low intentions of seek-
ing professional psychological help.
Hypothesis 2: Positive attitudes toward seeking profes-
sional psychological help positively predict intentions
of seeking professional psychological help.
Hypothesis 3: Public/social-stigma of receiving psycho-
logical help negatively predicts intentions of seeking
professional psychological help.
Hypothesis 4: Self-stigma of seeking psychological help
negatively predicts intentions of seeking professional
psychological help.
Method
Participants
A convenient sample of total of N = 519 (283 females and
236 males) University of Botswana students completed the
survey. Participants between the ages of 16 and 20 comprised
38.7% of the sample, 21 and 24 comprised 35.0% of the sam-
ple, 26 and 30 comprised 5.0% of the sample, and above 31
comprised 8.9% of the sample. In terms of nationality, 82%
indicated they were Batswana, 2.1% indicated that they were
other African nationalities, and 0.4% indicated that they
were other nationalities. The majority (90.0%) of the partici-
pants were single, 9.6% were married, and 4% were
widowed. Most of the participants did not have children
(81.8%). The sample consisted of 147 first-year students,
139 second-year students, 97 third-year students, 106 fourth-
year students, 28 fifth-year students, and 1 student who was
in the sixth year. There were no group differences on any
other sociodemographic variables.
Procedure
EthicsclearancefortheresearchwasobtainedfromBotswana's
Ministry Health. Data were collected using paper-and-pencil
surveys. Specifically, questionnaires were distributed to stu-
dents in classroom settings. Participants were treated in accor-
dance with the ethical principles of the Botswana's Ministry
Health. Specifically, the questionnaire started with a partici-
pant information cover page that detailed research objectives,
informed the participants of their right to withdraw from the
research at any time, and requested their consent. It took
between 20 and 30 min to complete the questionnaire.
Measures
Intentions of seeking psychological help. Intentions of seeking
psychological help were assessed with the Intentions to
Seeking Counseling Inventory (ISCI) by Cash, Begley,
McCown, and Weise (1975). The ISCI is a 17-item scale that
measures participants' intentions to seek counseling services
for a range of specified problems. The scale contains some of
the following items: weight control, excessive alcohol use,
depression, test anxiety, and loneliness. For each item, par-
ticipants were asked to rate on a scale from 1 (very unlikely)
to 4 (very likely) how likely they were to seek counseling if
they were experiencing the listed problem. Support for con-
struct validity of the ISCI has been provided by the findings
that participants who reported greater self-stigma associated
with seeking psychological help as measured by the SSRPH
had less intentions to seek treatment for psychological and
interpersonal concerns as measured by the ISCI (Vogel et al.,
2006), and positive association between the ISCI and the
ATSPPH (Kelly & Achter, 1995). Coefficient alpha in the
current study was  = .91, indicating a strong reliability.
Attitudes Toward Seeking Professional Psychological Help
Scale.ATSPPH was measured with the 10-item shortened
version of the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psycho-
logical Help Scale (Fischer & Farina, 1995) originally devel-
oped by Fischer and Turner (1970). A sample of items on the
scale included: "If I were experiencing a serious emotional
crisis at this point in my life, I would be confident that I
could find relief in psychotherapy" and "I would want to get
psychological help if I were worried or upset for a long
period of time." Items on this scale were scored on a scale
from 1 (disagree) to 4 (agree). Higher scores on this measure
reflected a more positive ATSPPH. Internal consistency of
the measure has been found to be acceptable ( = .82; Vogel
Pheko et al. 5
et al., 2005). The scores on the Self-Stigma of Seeking Psy-
chological Help scale also significantly predicted ATSPPH
(Vogel et al., 2006), indicating a good construct validity.
Coefficient alpha in the current study was  = .50.
Self-Stigma of Seeking Help Scale. The self-stigma associated
with seeking psychological help was measured with the Self-
Stigma of Seeking Help (SSOSH) scale (Vogel et al., 2006).
The SSOSH has 10 questions and responses on this scale
were rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher scores indi-
cated a greater perception of self-stigma associated with
seeking psychological help. Sample items on this subscale
include "Seeking psychological help would make me feel
less intelligent" and "It would make me feel inferior to ask a
therapist for help." In the current study, internal consistency
for this scale was  = .66.
Social Stigma of Receiving Psychological Help Scale.SSRPH
was measured with the Social Stigma of Receiving Psycho-
logical Help Scale (Komiya et al., 2000). The scale contained
five questions each rated on a 4-point Likert-type scale rang-
ing from 1 (strongly disagree) to 4 (strongly agree). Higher
scores in this scale indicated greater perceptions of social
stigma associated with receiving professional psychological
help and lower scores indicated lesser perceptions of social
stigma associated with receiving professional psychological
help. Sample items on this scale included "Seeing a psychol-
ogist for emotional or interpersonal problems carries social
stigma" and "People will see a person in a less favorable way
if they come to know that he or she has seen a psychologist."
The coefficient alpha for the SSRPH was initially found to be
 = .73 (Komiya et al., 2000), and in another study it was .76
(Vogel et al., 2006). In the current study,  =.73.
Results
Statistical Analyses
First, Cronbach's alpha coefficients () were calculated to
assess the internal consistency of the measuring instruments
(Clark & Watson, 1995; Cortina, 1993). Table 1 presents
the means, standard deviations, and alpha coefficients of
measures.
Second, for those scales yielding a low alpha (i.e.,
ATSPPH and SSOSH) further analyses were conducted to
identify problematic items. Despite the low Cronbach's
alpha, the item analyses on both scales did not indicate that
the removal of any of the items would improve the scale's
Cronbach's alpha. To further identify the problem with the
scales, the items were factor analyzed using Exploratory
Factor Analysis (EFA) and principal axis factoring analysis
with a direct oblimin, that is, an oblique rotation. The scales
were expected to manifest unidimensional set of items to
reflect variance in their latent variables.
For the SSOSH scale, the initial EFA analysis results
(Table 2) identified all the reverse-coded items as problem-
atic as the items loaded on the separate extracted factor.1
Another problematic scale was the scale measuring
ATSPPH. Following a low alpha, the scale was also sub-
jected to EFA. The results presented in Table 3 show that
similar to the SSOSH scale, all the reverse-coded items and
one extra item that was not necessarily reverse-coded (i.e.,
"Considering the time and expense involved in psychother-
apy, it would have doubtful value for a person like me") also
failed the unidimensionality test.2
As per recommendations of Hair, Babin, Money, and
Samouel (2003) regarding the use of alphas below .70 in pre-
liminary studies, a decision was made to still use all the
scales in further analysis. Items from each scale were there-
fore summed together to form indexes measuring ATSPPH,
intentions of seeking counseling (ISC), SSOSH, and SSRPH.
The second set of statistical tests was conducted to assess
the students' ISC. Table 4 shows the descriptive results of
students' scores of ISCI. Other researchers have identified
three subscales (i.e., Interpersonal Problems, Academic
Problems, and Drug/Alcohol Problems; Cepeda-Benito &
Short, 1998) of the ISCI. In the current study, an attempt was
made using EFA to evaluate the factor structure of the 17
items. Unfortunately, the current data did not yield the factor
structure identified by Cepeda-Benito and Short (1998).
Nonetheless, other researchers have summed the items of
the ISCI to yield scores ranging from low to high, with higher
scores indicating a greater likelihood of seeking counseling
for the various problems (e.g., Kelly & Achter, 1995; Leech,
2007). In the current study, the items were also summed to
yield scores ranging from 17 to 68. The summed scores were
also used to conduct correlations and multiple regression
analyses. To examine students' intentions of seeking help, it
was also deemed necessary to evaluate students' intentions to
seek help for each one of the listed items. Finding past
research that established cutoffs for the scale was difficult.
Therefore, in the current study, it was decided that as the
responses ranged from 1 = very unlikely, 2 = unlikely, 3 =
likely, to 4= very likely, for each item, any scores 2.0 and
below will indicate that the participants were unlikely to seek
help for the identified problem. In addition, any score between

2.1 and 3.0 were used to reflect that the individual has low to
moderate intentions to seek help, while the scores above 3.0
indicated that the individuals were more likely to seek help
for the specified problem. The results revealed that for most
of the areas of concern, the mean scores ranged from 1.96 to
3.45. The average mean score was 2.82 (SD = 0.61).
Predictive Analyses Using Multiple Regression
Before conducting multiple regression analysis, descriptive
statistics and intercorrelations were calculated for all study
variables. The correlation matrix is presented in Table 5.
Conducting correlation analysis was important in detecting
multicollinearity that may occur when predictor variables are
overcorrelated. Multicollinearity may cause some problems
in validation, interpretation, and analysis of the model (Feng-
Jeng, 2008). A general rule of thumb is that variables with a
correlation (r < .75) may cause multicollinearity. In our
study, all correlation coefficients were below .40.
The last step of the statistical analysis involved using
multiple regression analyses to test the hypotheses that
ATSPPH, SSOSH, and SSRPH predict the students' inten-
tions to seek counseling (i.e., Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4). Table 6
summarizes the results of the regression analysis. The total
model was statistically significant, R2 = .20, F(3, 379) =
31.50, p < .01. This indicates that 20% of the variance was
explained by the three predictors. Hypothesis 2 stated that
ATSPPH positively predicts ISC. In our data, Hypothesis 2
was supported (B = .38, t = 7.58, p < .001). Hypothesis 3
stated that SSRPH negatively predicts ISC. Hypothesis 3
was also supported (B = -.11, t = -2.60, p < .05). Hypothesis
4 stated that SSOSH negatively predicts ISC. While the rela-
tionship was in the hypothesized direction, the hypothesis
was not supported (B = -.05, t = -.86, p > .05).3

Discussion
As expected, correlation analysis showed that perceived
social stigma was positively related to self-stigma; self-
stigma and perceived social stigma were negatively associ-
ated with the attitudes toward seeking psychological help
and ISC; and that positive attitudes toward seeking psycho-
logical help were positively associated with ISC.
Results from the current study revealed that the University
of Botswana's students generally have low to moderate
intentions to seek counseling. In particular, depression,
excessive alcohol use, and drug problems received the high-
est mean scores. The only area of concern that the students
were unlikely (i.e., receiving a mean score of less than 2.0) to
seek counseling for was weight control. Other areas of con-
cern receiving the lower mean scores included speech anxi-
ety, difficulty with friends, and difficulties of dating.
The ISCI was used in another study aimed at measuring
the effects of mental health education on students' willing-
ness and intentions to seek counseling by Hobson (2008). In
Hobson's study, the experimental group was exposed to
mental health education and the control group was not. The
findings revealed that means on the ISCI for the experimen-
tal group were found to be significantly higher (M = 42.45,
SD = 8.24) than the means for the control group (M = 37.21,
SD = 9.42; Hobson, 2008). In another study, where 732 stu-
dents also completed questionnaires about their perceived
likelihood of seeking professional psychological help, the
findings revealed a mean of 45.86, SD = 16.45 (Cepeda-
Benito & Short, 1998). In another study by Kelly and Archer
(1995), the mean score for the ISCI overall scale was 46.04,
SD = 17.1. The mean for the current study (M = 47.91, SD =
10.40) was therefore considered slightly higher than Kelly
and Archer's (1995) and Cepeda-Benito and Short's (1998)
studies and was comparatively higher than in Hobson's
(2008) study.
While the ISC scale yielded a very good alpha, some of
the items in this scale might have been perceived as not war-
ranting the need for one to seek psychological help. For
example, being in the plus size range is not necessarily per-
ceived negatively by Batswana and subsequently not an issue
worth the attention of a counselor. Problems related to speech
anxiety, difficulty with friends, and difficulties of dating also
received lower mean scores. Lack of knowledge on the avail-
ability of counseling resources could be one possible con-
tributing factor, especially as noted earlier that psychology as
a profession is relatively new in the country of Botswana and
formal training for undergraduates was only introduced in
2004. Another possible explanation is that, in Botswana, the
practices and approaches used in psychotherapy are mostly
imported from the western world. As a result, the majority of
the population might still prefer traditional avenues like tra-
ditional healers, priests, family, and/or friends to deal with
challenges like dating problems.
These findings also point to the need for exposure to psy-
chological education as these might help to dispel myths
about the field and make people more aware of the benefits
that one can accrue from seeking counseling. Furthermore,
the Batswana's cultural and historical views of the mentally

ill as explained by Seloilwe and Thupayagale-Tshweneagae
(2007) might also keep the students from seeking counseling
for certain psychological problems.
Regression analysis showed that a positive attitude toward
seeking psychological help positively predicted intentions to
seek psychological help. These findings support past research
that has shown that negative attitudes toward help-seeking
has been found to reduce the likelihood of using mental
health care services (e.g., Bathje & Pryor, 2011; Mojtabai et
al., 2002). As predicted, the results also showed that SSOSH
and SSRPH were negatively correlated with the intention to
seek psychological help. However, it was only the SSRPH
that significantly predicted intentions of seeking psychologi-
cal help. The findings that perceived social stigma and nega-
tive attitudes negatively affect utilization of psychological
services are consistent with literature on the centrality of
sociocultural factors of negative perceptions of mental disor-
ders for those afflicted with mental disorders (Kgathi, 2005;
Papadopoulos et al., 2002) among groups that has not tradi-
tionally used psychological help. Researchers have noted
among these ethnic groups that where there is perceived
negative reaction of the family and the community (i.e.,
where salient beliefs and valued social norms are incongru-
ent with seeking psychological help), individuals are less
likely to have intentions to seek help when faced with a psy-
chological problem (Goldston et al., 2008).
Contrary to the stated hypothesis, internalized self-
stigma was not found to significantly predict ISC among
the University of Botswana students. While researchers
have suggested that individuals from groups with collective
orientations may face greater self-stigma associated with
seeking counseling (e.g., Goldston et al., 2008); such sug-
gestions were, however, refuted in the current study.
Researchers have suggested that stigma vary across cul-
tures as it might be influenced by social and cultural con-
texts (Pescosolido, Martin, Lang, & Olafsdottir, 2008).
This may also be explained by suggestions that individuals
tend to have either independent or interdependent self-con-
struals (Schein, 1984), and this might affect whether they
are impacted more by the self-stigma or the social stigma.
In collectivistic cultures like Botswana, identity may be
embedded in social groups in which interdependence
among group members is emphasized (Cheung & Halpern,
2010; Markus & Kitayama, 1991). For individuals with
interdependent self-construals, endorsing the societal ste-
reotype of people who seek or receive help for psychologi-
cal distress might be easier than for people with independent
self-construals because how "others" view them is impor-
tant for the development of the self. Furthermore, public/
social stigma might also be more damaging as the individu-
als might also like to protect their family/group image from
associations with mental disorders as it has been suggested
that in countries like Botswana even families with persons
who show signs of mental disorders may also be stigma-
tized (Seloilwe & Thupayagale-Tshweneagae, 2007).
Limitations of the Current Study
In interpreting the findings from the current study, some lim-
itations should be taken into account. First, while the study
used existing instruments that have been used broadly in
studying self-stigma, social stigma, intentions of seeking
psychological help, and ATSPPH, in the current study, some
of the instruments revealed low alphas necessitating removal
of certain items to strengthen reliability. These findings sug-
gest that the instruments that have been designed from differ-
ent contexts need to be piloted first to ensure their validity
and/or reliability. Still relating to this limitation, even after
removing some of the items from the Attitude Toward
Seeking Psychological Help scale, the scale still yielded an
alpha lower than the recommended critical cutoff value.
While the use of scales with such alphas has been recom-
mended for preliminary studies, caution in interpreting the
results still need to be exercised as such measures might have
inflated or deflated the results.
In addition, the study's sample limits the generalizability
of the findings such that the findings might only apply to the
context of the University of Botswana. The study also used a
cross-sectional design where all the variables were assessed
at one point in time. However, data analysis did not control
for intervening and moderating variables that could have
contributed to the relationships. The results were also based
on self-reporting, and these could have inflated the magni-
tude of relationships due to common method variances.
Despite these limitations, the results of the current study
expand previous findings regarding college students' inten-
tions to seek counseling and also highlighted important simi-
larities in a different culture.
Implications and Suggestions for Future Research
Overall, the limitations of the present study point out several
avenues for future research. For example, the low reliability
of the ATSPPH and the SSOSH suggests that researchers in
different contexts might need to design their own instru-
ments or use varying instruments for measuring the two con-
structs. Furthermore, to address concern regarding
intervening variables, testing moderational models, media-
tional models, longitudinal designs, and experimental
designs might provide a more rigorous test of the proposed
relationships. The role of variables such as gender, upbring-
ing, age, and even spiritual beliefs could also be assessed
when exploring the relationships between attitudes, stigma,
and Batswana college students' ISC. For instance, the seem-
ingly existence of a parallel system where Batswana con-
tinue to seek help from professional counselors and traditional
healers (Bhusumane, 2007) requires professionals to under-
stand how indigenous method and practices may enhance or
comprise the counseling process.
Research has also suggested that university students tend
to seek help from a variety of sources; however, the present
Pheko et al. 9
study has only focused on help-seeking from mental health
professionals. It is therefore important to investigate the stu-
dent's intentions to seek help from other sources. Another
important issue that needs to be investigated is whether
intentions to seek counseling are also related to actual behav-
iors. While researchers such as Ajzen (2001) have demon-
strated the link between the attitudes, intentions, and
behavior, it is still important for us to conduct research that
fully examines the link between intentions and behavior in
the Botswana context.
Given the importance of cultural norms and values, future
research should also explore the intentions to seek psycho-
logical help from a cultural orientation point of view. For
example, Botswana is a country developing economically
and socially, and such developments directly impact the cul-
tural landscape of Batswana; hence, longitudinal studies
would be vital to examine the effects of those changes on
perceptions of psychological help-seeking patterns.
The findings also have implications for research and psy-
chological intervention program designs as there might exist
specific sociocultural factors that differently influence
Batswana university students' decision to seek psychological
help. Such interventions may include psychological education
and outreach. Practitioners in Botswana may also need to be
innovative in coming up with varying treatment options for
individuals who may be experiencing or anticipating social
stigma or any other negative consequences of seeking help.

Notes
1. After removing the reverse-coded items from the Self-Stigma
of Seeking Help (SSOSH) scale, the remaining items were
again subjected to item analysis. The Cronbach's alpha using
five items was .716 and this was deemed to be satisfactory.
The five items were therefore summed together to form an
index measuring SSOSH.
2. For the Attitude Toward Seeking Professional Psychological
Help (ATSPPH) scale, the negatively worded items were also
removed and item analysis conducted again. Removing these
problematic items resulted in improvement of the Cronbach's
alpha to .58. This alpha was nonetheless still lower than the
recommended cutoff value. The five items from the ATSPPH
were also summed together to form an index measuring
ATSPPH.
3. The following correlations were reported: ATSPPH and inten-
tions to seek counseling (ISC; r = .46, p < .01), ATSPPH and
SSOSH (r = -.25, p < .01), ATSPPH and SSRPH (r = -.23,
p < .01), ISC and SSOSH (r = -.15, p < .01), ISC and Social
Stigma of Receiving Psychological Help (SSRPH; r = -.23,
p < .01), SSOSH and SSRPH (r = .45, p < .01). Regression
analyses were also conducted with the scales after removing
the items that reduced the alpha of the scale. The results using
the abridged revealed that ATSPPH, SSOSH, and SSRPH
predicted the students' intentions to seek counseling (i.e.,
Hypotheses 2, 3, and 4). The total model was statistically
significant (F = 41.75 p < .01) and R2 = .25. This indicates
that 25% of the variance was explained by the three predic-
tors. Hypothesis 2 stated that ATSPPH positively predicts ISC.
In our data, Hypothesis 2 was supported (B = .45, t = 9.63,
p < .001). Hypothesis 3 stated that SSRPH negatively predicts
ISC. Hypothesis 3 was also supported (B = -.13, t = -2.60,
p < .001). Hypothesis 4 stated that SSOSH negatively pre-
dicts ISC. Hypothesis 4 was not supported (B = .01, t = .13,
p > .001). The results using shorter scales were not extremely
different from the results using longer original scales. It is,
however, important to highlight the shorter scales revealed
better reliabilities, better correlations, and the three predic-
tors explained more variance (i.e., 25%) while using the two
shorter scales.
