Abstract
Variation in testosterone (T) is thought to affect the allocation of effort between reproductive and parenting strategies.
Here, using a large sample of elderly American men (n = 754) and women (n = 669) we examined the relationship between T
and self-reported parenthood, as well as the relationship between T and number of reported children. Results supported
previous findings from the literature, showing that fathers had lower T levels than men who report no children.
Furthermore, we found that among fathers T levels were positively associated with the number of children a man reports
close to the end of his lifespan. Results were maintained when controlling for a number of relevant factors such as time of T
sampling, participant age, educational attainment, BMI, marital status and reported number of sex partners. In contrast, T
was not associated with either motherhood or the number of children women had, suggesting that, at least in this sample, T
does not influence the allocation of effort between reproductive and parenting strategies among women. Findings from
this study contribute to the growing body of literature suggesting that, among men, pair bonding and paternal care are
associated with lower T levels, while searching and acquiring sex partners is associated with higher T levels.

Introduction
Humans are among a relatively restricted group of mammals,
5% or less, that display male paternal care [1,2]. It is not
uncommon for fathers to provide direct care to dependent
offspring well into the second decade of their life, often even
caring for multiple overlapping offspring at the same time (e.g.,
[3,4]). As a consequence of paternal investment human males must
regulate the time and energy they allocate between mating and
parental effort [2,3].
Wingfield, Hegner, Duffy, and Ball's `challenge hypothesis',
based on research from bird species, suggests that testosterone (T)
helps to regulate the trade-off between mating and parenting [5].
Specifically, it explains the function of varied T levels in seasonally
breeding birds, wherein T levels rise in the mating season and then
subsequently drop during the period of brooding and parental
care. The challenge hypothesis, reviewed in [6], has since been
adapted to also account for changes in mating and parenting effort
in humans (review in [7], example: [8]). Of course, in humans,
breeding does not follow a seasonal pattern, instead human males
experience high chronic T levels and can pursue mating
opportunities throughout their lifespan [9]. Nonetheless, research
on the life history of human males appears to support the idea that
T is intricately involved in regulating mating and pair bonding/
parenting behavior (for review: [10]). Low male T levels have been
shown to promote features relevant to parenting or investment [7].
For example, married men are known to have lower T levels than
samples of matched men who are unmarried (e.g., [11­14]).
Likewise, men who are in committed relationships have been
shown to have lower levels of T than uncommitted single men
(e.g., [14­16]). A complementary line of research has shown that
the transition to fatherhood is also associated with a decrease in T
levels (e.g., [13,17­20]). The role of low T in facilitating parenting
seems to be robust: in non-Western populations fathers have also
been found to have lower T levels than non-fathers [17,19­21].
The adjustment of T levels upon the transition to fatherhood has
been proposed to facilitate better fathering through priming men
to provide care [22]. Yet, T levels have been found to be
negatively related to paternal investment in three studies from
non-Western cultures [17,21,23]. The notion of low levels of T
being associated with nurturing responses is, however, consistent
with recent laboratory based work by van Anders and colleagues
[24] who showed that providing a nurturing response to a crying
doll decreases male T levels. However, it should be noted that this
sample consisted mostly of non-fathers. In line with van Anders
et al. findings [24], men who express a greater need to comfort a
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60018
crying baby experience an even larger decrease in their T levels
than men who do not express such a need [22]. However, a
different study showed an increase in T levels among fathers in
response to crying by infants [25]. Moreover, to date, there is no
conclusive evidence that T levels in males are negatively related to
interaction with children. One study using data on Jamaican
fathers [26] and one study on Filipino fathers [27] did not find any
significant relationship between T levels and interaction with
children. A study by Storey and colleagues found a negative
relationship between amount of time spent interacting with
toddlers and percent change in T levels in a sample of Canadian
fathers [28].
In contrast to findings suggesting that low T levels are related
to nurturing behaviors, high T levels are known to promote
mating behaviors. For example, T levels are known to increase
when men view sexually explicit videos [29] and after they have
had sex [30]. Likewise, male T levels increase after a brief non-
physical social interactions with women [8,31]. Men with
elevated T levels also show more affiliative behaviors towards
women [32]. Finally, high T levels are positively associated with
the number of sex partners a man reports [33­35], and, more
broadly, have been argued to be positively related to male
reproductive effort in humans [9].
There is also evidence that T levels regulate the tradeoff
between mating and parental effort in women. For example, it has
been shown that single women have higher levels of T than
partnered women [36], married women have lower T levels than
single women [37], and mothers have lower T levels than non-
mothers [37,38]. However, the evidence linking T levels to mating
and parental effort is far scarcer for females than it is for males,
especially when compared across species.
Here, we present data that allowed us to explore the
relationship between being a parent, number of children and T
levels in a sample of elderly men and women. To our knowledge,
no study in humans has yet examined the relationship between T
levels and breeding success in men and women with at least one
child in a large sample. We predicted, in line with the
aforementioned literature, that fatherhood and motherhood would
be negatively associated with T levels. In addition, we predicted
that, among fathers, breeding success would be higher among men
with relatively higher levels of T as these men may be more
inclined to focus on mating effort. Among mothers we also
explored this latter relationship, but we did not expect a higher
breeding success for women with high T levels, as it seems unlikely
that women would increase their number of children via mating
effort in the same way men do.
Methods
1. Ethics Statement
This paper makes use of secondary data analysis of a previously
collected data source, which is available to researchers via a data
archive (ICPSR, www.icpsr.org). Ethical review was waived for the
current research project by the Ethics Review Board (VCWE,
Faculty of Psychology and Pedagogics, VU University Amster-
dam). The ethics approval of the original data collection can be
found in the NSHAP codebook (see: http://www.norc.org/
Research/Projects/Pages/national-social-life-health-and-aging-
project.aspx).
2. Dataset
Our predictions were tested using an archival dataset of older
Americans aged 57­85 from the National Social Life, Health, and
Aging Project (NSHAP) (N = 3,005; [39]). Relative to the American
population the dataset oversampled men, African-Americans,
Latinos, and the eldest age groups. Trained interviewers from
the National Opinion Research Centre (NORC) conducted the
face-to-face interviews between July 2005 and March 2006.
Participant response rate was 75.5% (for the full description of
the data collection see [39] or [40]). At the time of the
interview participants also provided several in-home biomea-
sures (e.g. Testosterone, Cotinine) and were given a leave-
behind questionnaire. We limited the sample to White
participants (74% of the male working sample, n = 754; 70%
of the female working sample n = 669), as exploring the
relationship in other ethnicities left us with too few cases
(Males: Hispanics: n = 111; African Americans: n = 129; Other
n = 29; Females: Hispanics: n = 108; African Americans: n = 157;
Other n = 18). While these numbers are much higher than some
published samples for T and paternal behavior (e.g., [22]), given
the high level of noise in these data and the small effects we
expect at the end of participants' reproductive lifespan, samples
of around 150 are likely not sufficient. In addition, there are
suggestions that ethnicities differ both in their T levels (e.g.,
[41]) as well as in their reproductive behavior (e.g., [42­44]). In
ESM S1 we present the results for the full sample with all
ethnicities. These results are quite similar to those reported
below. However, given that the reported effects are predomi-
nantly driven by White participants (.70% of working sample)
and the reasons outlined above, we have chosen to report the
results for White participants rather than those of the pooled
sample.
3. Testosterone
Ninety percent of the overall sample complied in providing
saliva samples (N = 3,005). Participants who failed to have a
saliva samples taken successfully were excluded (4.5% of overall
sample failed to provide a sample or provided a sample which
was not valid due to equipment failure (N = 135)). Saliva
samples were transported from interviews using cold packs and
dry ice and were shipped to Salimetrics for analysis in duplicate
(75.3% of the saliva samples provided actual T values, see [39]
for further details). The procedure and assay are described in
[35] and [45]. We excluded outliers of two standard deviations
above the mean (.166.75 pg/ml for males; .93.58 pg/ml for
females). As the key independent variable we used the mean
scores of the T values from both hormone assays, which we
subsequently logarithmically transformed as values did not
follow a normal distribution.
4. Childlessness and Number of Living Children
Number of children and childlessness were used as the
dependent variable. This was captured by the items: ``How many
living daughters do you have'' and ``How many living sons do you have''
([39]: p. 32-ff.). When participants asked if they should include or
exclude step-sons/daughters they were told that they could include
them. It is thus possible that responses to these items include non-
biological children. However, we believe that the error as a result
from asking about and reporting non-biological children can be
considered as random noise, which is unrelated to T levels.
Therefore, it seems unlikely that this noise would influence the
statistical conclusions of our results.
5. Control Variables
While some findings suggest that in older men the circadian
rhythm in T is blunted or even lost (see [46]), we included the time
of sampling as a control variable (coded as am/pm). Further, since
male T levels are known to decrease with age [47], participant age
T and Male Childlessness and Offspring Count
PLOS ONE | www.plosone.org 2 April 2013 | Volume 8 | Issue 4 | e60018
was also used as a control variable. Educational attainment (four
categories) and Body Mass Index (BMI; measured by a trained
interviewer) were included as these may be factors which influence
circulating T and perhaps its relation to childlessness or offspring
count. Similarly, since previous research has shown that men with
higher T levels are more likely to divorce [12] and that T
influences the likelihood of remarriage [35] we controlled for
marital status. Furthermore, it is possible that any relationship
between childlessness and T is an artifact of these males being in a
committed relationship. Thus, marital status is a necessary control
variable to distinguish whether or not the effect is driven by
differences in T or differences in marital status. We also explored if
the number of opposite sex partners a participant reported
influenced our main findings, because males with higher T have
been shown to report more female sex partners (e.g., [33­35]).
These findings are described in the ESM S2. The descriptive
statistics of the aforementioned control variables can be found in
ESM S3.
6. Statistical Analyses
We used Generalized linear models with Maximum Likeli-
hood estimation to analyze the data. We use negative binomial
regression to analyze childlessness (GZLM; with NBR, [48]).
This method was preferred over logistic regression as it deals
with overdispersion better. For individuals with at least one
child, offspring count was analyzed via adjusted Poisson models,
given that we are dealing with skewed count data. The number
of children can be conceived as count data following a Poisson
distribution (number of events in an unknown sequence). Indeed
a Poisson model proved a much better fit to the data than a
linear model (all models DAIC.50 (Poisson vs. linear), although
the conclusions drawn from our results were the same for both
models. The standard errors for the models we present were
adjusted for model deviance, and thus take into account the
under- or overdispersion in any given model [48,49].
We reported model fit (AIC, BIC) and parameter statistics for
our models. Our modeling strategy was as follows: (1) we first
examined a baseline model with no control variables; (2) we then
sequentially added control variables, and only maintained these
variables when they improved model fit (Akaike Information
Criterion (AIC); smaller-is-better; [50]). As a rule of thumb, two
units indicates an indistinguishable difference between models,
whereas ten units indicates a large difference between models and
more support for model A over model B [51]. This procedure is an
information theoretic approach which leads to the best fitting
model from our given set of variables [52,53]. Additionally, we
reported also the Bayesian information criterion for each model
(BIC, [54]) which tends to be more conservative. We presented the
results separately for males and females, as the distributions for T
and offspring count are expected to differ significantly between the
sexes. All statistical tests were performed with SPSS version 16.0.
Values are mean 6 standard error means (SE) unless otherwise
specified. For illustrative purposes, we used raw T scores or Z
scores, rather than log (T) scores within the (online) figures.
Results
1. Males: Childlessness
Testosterone levels were associated with male childlessness (see
Fig. 1 and Table 1). Men who reported no living children had
higher T levels (90.79+/24.11 pg/ml) than men with living
children (76.46+/21.04 pg/ml), see also Fig. 1. The Negative
Binomial Regression Model showed indeed that log (T) was
positively associated with childlessness. This effect remained after
controlling for marital status (see model 2 in Table 1). However,
the odds ratio (exp(B)) for log(T) dropped from 21.08 to 8.48 after
inclusion of Marital Status, suggesting that the relationship
between log(T) and childlessness is mediated by not being married.
Model 2, with marital status and log(T) as predictors, could not be
improved by adding the other control variables (DAIC,1).
2. Males: Offspring Count among Men with Living
Children
When examining only men with at least one child, male T levels
were significantly and positively associated with the number of
living children (see Figure 1 and Table 2). At baseline, the model
predicts that an increase of one standard deviation from the mean
in raw T levels amounts to an increase of.12 children (see ESM
S4). The significant association between T and offspring count
remained after controlling for age and educational attainment (see
model 2 and 3 in Table 2). Older and lower educated men tended
to have more children than younger and higher educated men
respectively. Model 2 and Model 3 were virtually indistinguishable
in terms of model fit (DAIC,2). Using a Bayesian approach, one
would select model 2 over model 3 (DBIC.11). Model 3 could not
be improved by adding other control variables, such as marital
status (DAIC,1). As described in the endnote controlling for the
number of reported opposite sex partners or remarriage does not
alter this finding.
3. Females: Childlessness and Offspring Count
For women there was no association between log (T) and
childlessness (Negative Binomial Regression Model; B = .572+/
2.44; x2 test = 1.694; p = .193). Similarly, there was no association
between log (T) and offspring count among women who reported
living children (Poisson Model; B = 0.071+/2109; x2 test = 0.424;
p = .515).
Discussion
Three main findings emerge from this research. Firstly, we
replicated the finding that fathers have lower T levels than non-
fathers (e.g., [13,17­19,22]). However, to our knowledge, this is
the first time that this has been demonstrated in a large sample of
elderly men. The decrease in T levels upon the transition to
fatherhood is thought to facilitate the allocation of energy to
activities related to parenting. Yet, there are several studies
indicating that T levels can be negatively related to paternal
investment in males [17,21,23]. In contrast, the notion that T is
positively related to fathering is supported, for example, by the
finding that men who experience a greater need to comfort a
crying baby experience a larger decrease in their T levels [22]. It is
also consistent with findings that providing a nurturing response to
crying baby actually decreases male T levels [24], though the
majority of this sample consisted of non-fathers. However, it is still
unclear whether T levels and interacting with offspring are
consistently related in males (see [26­28]). Our results add to the
current literature by showing that in old age there still is a marked
significant difference between (self-reported) fathers and non-
fathers in T levels, though from this cross-sectional study it is
unclear what the mechanism driving this decrease among fathers
is. One potential mechanism could be close interaction with young
grandchildren, rather than fatherhood status per se. However, the
finding that (putative) fatherhood is associated with low T levels in
old age, seems at odds with recent findings by Gettler and
colleagues who showed that while T levels decreased when Filipino
men became fathers, T levels returned to similar levels before
fatherhood as their children aged [17]. These findings suggest that
T and Male Childlessness and Offspring Count

longer-term effects of fatherhood on T levels are perhaps not
universal and that they may differ between Western and non-
Western societies.
Secondly, we showed that among elderly men who reported
being fathers, those with higher T levels reported more (living)
children than those with lower T levels. To our knowledge, our
study is the first to demonstrate in a large sample of putative
fathers that T levels are related to the reported number of children
towards the end of man's reproductive lifespan. While in theory,
men in our sample may still have more offspring, they are likely to
be close to the end of their reproductive lifespan as they were on
average 69 years old. That fathers with higher T levels would have
more children is consistent with the predictions of the Challenge
Hypothesis [7] and with T being involved in mating effort in
humans [9]. According to both these perspectives, in contexts
where mating effort is required, e.g. to acquire sex partners, T
levels are (chronically) higher. Consequently, those fathers with
higher T levels may engage more frequently in attracting
(additional) partners for sex, thereby increasing their likelihood
to father additional children. This may be accomplished either
through increased promiscuity, extramarital affairs or new
marriages. Indeed, in this same dataset we have previously shown
that men with higher T levels report more sex partners [35].
Similarly, previous research has shown that men with higher T
levels are more likely to get divorced [12]. Taken together, these
behaviors may result in the fathering of more children during their
lifespan than fathers who did not engage in the acquisition of more
sex partners. However, our results did not show that fathers with
high T levels had more children because they remarried or
because they had more sex partners. It may be that this effect was
obscured because of social desirability in responses, which could
especially cause men with a family (i.e., fathers) to underreport
extramarital affairs.
Apart from the acquisition of more sex partners by men with
high T levels, additional mechanisms are plausible. It could be that
those fathers with high T levels were more fertile than those with

lower T levels. In line with this reasoning, it is well established that
T is crucial for male reproductive effort, fertility and the
maintenance of spermatogenesis ([9,10,55] for mechanisms see
[56,57]) and, not surprising, low T levels are associated with male
infertility [58]. However, when considering fertile men, a recent
study found no relationship between semen quality and T levels
[59]. This latter finding suggests that increased fertility is not a
likely explanation for our finding. It could be that, although a
certain level of T is mandatory for fertility, higher T levels do not
lead to increased fertility among men who are already fertile.
Furthermore, rather than a direct effect of T on fertility, there
could also be a number of indirect effects of T on the number of
children a man has. For example, lower T levels are positively
associated with obesity, stress and exposure to industrial pollutants
(reviewed in [60]). It could thus be that those men with high T
levels have more children since they are more physically motivated
and capable, and thus experience more opportunities for mating
than men with lower T levels. However, this relationship does not
seem that likely since we controlled for BMI, which is an
important health indicator.
Finally, we found that T levels were not associated with either
motherhood or number of living children in our female sample.
This finding is in contrast to the results of Kuzawa and colleagues
[38]. However, it is possible that among women there are no
measurable associations between T and childlessness or offspring
count at an older age, while these do exist at other periods
throughout a female's life span, as the findings by Kuzawa and
colleagues on women in their reproductive window suggest. In this
respect, it is important to note that androgen levels of postmen-
opausal women are substantially different from those of women of
reproductive age (e.g, [61]). Moreover, the population and context
of the Philippines, is very different from that of the United States,
which likely makes the populations hard to compare (see [62,63]).
Therefore these findings are not necessarily at odds with those of
Kuzawa and colleagues [38].
There are several notable limitations to this study. Firstly, our
conclusions are based on self-reports. It could be that men with
higher T levels are more prone to boast their number of children,
or alternatively, be more likely to include stepchildren as their own
children. However, this seems unlikely since the effect of T on the
number of self-reported children was not mediated via remarriage.
Secondly, this study could not disentangle the mechanism through
which fathers with higher T levels had more children: it could be
that they had more sex partners (although they did not report
them), that they were more fertile, that they had sex with their
partner more frequently, or that they preferred sex partner(s) who
wanted relatively more children. Similarly, men with high T levels
might have actually paired with more fertile women. Thirdly, the
fathers in our study were not yet at the end of their theoretical
reproductive life span and could therefore conceive additional
children. The survey items also specifically asked participants to
report on the number of living children. One implication of our this
finding is that fathers with high T could invest less time towards
parenting effort, which could potentially reduce the quality, health
or even survival of their offspring. If it is true that survivorship of
children was affected by high T fathers, findings reported herein
may be somewhat underestimated. Finally, our interpretation of
the relationship between number of offspring and T levels assumes
that individual differences in T levels demonstrate some stability
over time. Indeed, there is some evidence that this so, since it has
been shown in a longitudinal study covering 30 years that male
free T is at least moderately correlated (r = 0.5, [64]). The results
from this study contribute to the growing literature that shows that
pair bonding and paternal care are associated with low T levels,
while searching for and acquiring sex partners is associated with
high T levels. An interesting avenue to pursue in future research
could be to look more closely at how age of children or contact
with children might interact with the effects reported herein.
Future research on T and reproductive success should take into
account that while fatherhood may decrease T levels in both the
short and long term, once a father, higher T levels are positively
associated with number of children.
