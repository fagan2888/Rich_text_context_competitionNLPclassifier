Introduction
Houttuynia cordata Thunb (H cordata) is a medicinal plant
that is considered to have anti-inflammatory and antiviral
effects,1 antiobesity effects,2 and anticancer activity because
it inhibits cell growth and induces apoptosis in human
colorectal cancer,3,4 leukemic cancer,5 and lung cancer
cells.6 However, the potential anticancer activity and mech-
anisms of H cordata in human liver cancer cells have not
yet been investigated. Therefore, we aimed to determine
whether H cordata has anti­liver cancer activity and
whether such effects are associated with induction of apop-
tosis in the human liver cancer line HepG2.
The ability to induce apoptosis is an important marker
for cytotoxic antitumor agents. Some natural compounds
have been shown to modulate apoptosis pathways that are

Abstract
Houttuynia cordata Thunb (H cordata), a medicinal plant, has anticancer activity, as it inhibits cell growth and induces cell apoptosis in
cancer. However, the potential anti-cancer activity and mechanism of H cordata for human liver cancer cells is not well understood.
Recently, we identified hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-1A, Forkhead box (FOX)O3, and MEF2A as proapoptotic factors induced
by H cordata, suggesting that HIF-1A, FOXO3, and MEF2A contribute to the apoptosis of HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells.
FOXO3 transcription factors regulate target genes involved in apoptosis. H cordata significantly increased the mRNA and protein
expression of HIF-1A and FOXO3 and stimulated MEF2A expression in addition to increased apoptosis in HepG2 cells within 24
hours. Therefore, we determined the potential role of FOXO3 on apoptosis and on H cordata­induced MEF2A in HepG2 cells.
HIF-1A silencing by siRNA attenuated MEF2A and H cordata­mediated FOXO3 upregulation in HepG2 cells. Furthermore, H
cordata­mediated MEF2A expression enhanced caspase-3 and caspase-7, which were abolished on silencing FOXO3 with siRNA.
In addition, H cordata inhibited growth of human hepatocellular carcinoma xenografts in nude mice. Taken together, our results
demonstrate that H cordata enhances HIF-1A/FOXO3 signaling, leading to MEF2A upregulation in HepG2 cells, and in parallel, it
disturbs the expression of Bcl-2 family proteins (Bax, Bcl-2, and Bcl-xL), which results in apoptosis. Taken together, these findings
demonstrate that H cordata promotes the activation of HIF-1A­FOXO3 and MEF2A pathways to induce apoptosis in human
HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells and is, therefore, a promising candidate for antitumor drug development.

frequently blocked in human cancers and, thus, provide
novel opportunities for cancer drug development.7 Hypoxia-
inducible factor 1 gene (HIF-1A) is a subunit of the het-
erodimeric transcription factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1
(HIF-1).8,9 HIF-1A functions as a tumor promoter in cancer-
associated fibroblasts and as a tumor suppressor in breast
cancer cells.10 HIF-1A increases the risk of castrate resis-
tance and metastases in prostate cancer11 and metastases in
patients on androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer.12
Conversely, HIF-1 significantly promotes apoptosis via
several proapoptotic target genes, RTP801, and the Bcl-2
family of proapoptotic factors.13,14 Forkhead box proteins
are a family of transcription factors, including FOXO1
(FKHR), FOXO3 (FKHRL1), FOXO4 (AFX), and FOXO6,
which have been implicated in cell growth, proliferation,
differentiation, apoptosis, and longevity.15,16 Previous stud-
ies have demonstrated that Akt/protein kinase B phosphory-
lates FOXO transcription factors, which attenuates the
nuclear translocation of FOXOs and their binding with
14-3-3 protein, resulting in proteasomal degradation.17,18
Furthermore, FOXO3, a Forkhead box class O (FOXO)
transcription factor, is known to be a key tumor suppressor
in breast cancer.15 Conversely, FOXO3 and FOXM1 are
known to be key players in cancer initiation, progression,
and drug resistance.19 Therefore, we designed experiments
to dissect the mechanisms that regulate FOXO3 and apop-
tosis and to elucidate the potential role of FOXO3 in H
cordata­mediated apoptosis in HepG2 cells.
In the present study, we investigated the apoptotic pathway
induced by H cordata extract in HepG2 cells. The data herein
clearly showed that H cordata triggers the activation of HIF-
1A­FOXO3 and MEF2A pathways and the caspase-3- and
caspase-7-mediated pathways to cause cancer cell death.
Methods
Plant Material, Extraction, and Fractionation
The dried whole plant of H cordata Thunb was procured
from Hanwoori Herbs Company (Seoul, Korea). A voucher
specimen (BP1234283) was deposited at the Korean
Collection for Type Cultures and Biological Resource
Center in the Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and
Biotechnology (Jeongeup, Jeollabuk, Korea). Dried whole
plants of H cordata (100 g) were extracted with 1 L of
methanol (MeOH) in a shaking incubator at room tempera-
ture for 24 hours. The residue was re-extracted twice under
the same conditions. The resulting extract was filtered
through a 0.45-µm filter, evaporated to dryness using a vac-
uum rotary evaporator (Rotavapor, Switzerland) at 80°C,
and weighed (6.002 g W/W, dry base) to determine the yield
of soluble constituents. The crude dried MeOH extract was
then suspended in water and partitioned by ethyl acetate
(EtOAc; 0.872 g) fractionation.
LC-MS Analysis of H cordata Extract
Agilent 6410B Triple Quadrupole liquid chromatography
mass spectroscopy (LC MS; Agilent Technologies,
Wilmington, DE) equipped with an Electrospray ionization
(ESI) source was used for the analysis. Sample weighing 100
mg was mixed with 1 mL of MeOH and centrifuged.Aliquots
of 5 µL of the processed samples were injected into the HPLC
system (1200 Series LC, Agilent Technologies) fitted with
Phenomenex Synergi Hydro-RP 4 µm, 80 Å, 150 × 2 mm2
column, maintained at 30°C. ESI was operating at +3000 V
and a source temperature of 380°C. Capillary voltage, cone
voltage, and source offset were set at 3 kV, 30 kV, and 30 V,
respectively. The gas flow of desolvation and the cone was set
at 650 L/h and 150 L/h, with a nebulizer pressure of 15 bar. A
mobile phase composed of 0.1% formic acid in distilled water
(buffer A) and 0.1% formic acid in acetonitrile (buffer B) was
used to separate the analysis specimens and pumped into the
ESI chamber at a flow rate of 0.5 mL/min for 20 minutes.
Fragmentor voltage and collision voltage were set at 90 and
20 V, respectively. Detection of the sample was carried out in
the multiple-reaction monitoring mode (MRM) by monitor-
ing the transition pairs of m/z 252.1  136.1.
Cell Culture
Human liver HepG2 hepatocellular cells were purchased from
theAmerican Type Culture Collection (Rockville, MD, USA).
Cells were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% (v/v)
FBS (Gibco/Invitrogen, Grand Island, NY) and 1% (w/v)
penicillin-streptomycin (Gibco/Invitrogen) in a 37°C incuba-
tor with 5% (v/v) CO
2
in a humidified atmosphere. Cells were
grown to confluence, trypsinized, and then sub-cultured.
Fluorescence-Assisted Cytometric Spectroscopy
To detect apoptosis, propidium iodide (PI)-annexin-V stain-
ing was performed using an Annexin-V-FLUOS Staining
Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. Briefly,
HepG2 cells were treated with 1 and 10 µg/mL of H cordata
EtOAc fraction for 24 hours, harvested, and washed twice
with phosphate buffered saline (PBS). The cell suspension
was centrifuged at 2000 rpm (1200g) for 2 minutes and was
then incubated with 0.2 mg/mLAnnexin-V-FLUOS and 1.4
mg/mL PI for 15 minutes at room temperature. Staining was
measured using an Image Cytometer (NUCLEOCOUNTER
NC-3000, ChemoMetec, Copenhagen, Denmark) at an
excitation of 488 nm with a 530/30 nm band pass filter to
detect Annexin-V and a 670 nm high-pass filter to detect PI.
Acquired Nuclear Fraction
HepG2 cells were prepared by incubation with a medium
for 2 days. The cells were scraped, and 2 mL was added per
362 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(3)
dish of homogenization buffer A (25 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 2
mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 1 mM DTT, protease inhibitor
cocktail, 1 mM PMSF, and 0.02% Triton X-100), and it was
homogenized 15 times using a 15-mL Dounce homogenizer
with pestle A, and centrifuged at 100000g for 30 minutes.
The supernatant cytosolic fraction was transferred into a
new tube, and 500 µL of homogenization buffer B (homog-
enization buffer A containing 1% Triton X-100) was added
to the pellet. The pellet was resuspended by sonication,
incubated for 30 minutes at 4°C by rocking, and centrifuged
at 100000g for 30 minutes. The supernatant nuclear frac-
tion was transferred into a fresh tube. The protein contents
of the cytosolic and nuclear fractions were determined
using a bicinchoninic acid (BCA) assay kit (Thermo
Scientific, Rockford, IL) and analyzed by western blotting
against anti--catenin antibodies.
Western Blot Analysis
HepG2 cells were treated with H cordata EtOAc fraction (1
and 10 µg/mL) for 24 hours, harvested, and washed twice
with PBS. The cells were lysed using a lysis buffer from
iNtRON (Seoul, Korea), and protein concentration was
determined using a BCAprotein assay kit (Pierce Chemical,
Rockford, IL, USA), according to the manufacturer's proto-
col. Then, 30 µg of denatured proteins were separated using
10% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and transferred
onto nitrocellulose membranes. The membranes were
blocked for 1 hour with 5% (w/v) skimmed milk in 0.1%
Tween-20 and Tris-buffered saline (TTBS). They were then
incubated with diluted (1:1000) primary antibodies against
Bax, Bcl-2, Bid, tBid, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9,
p-AKT, and PARP (all from Cell Signaling Technologies,
Beverly, MA) and AKT, FOXO3, HIF-1A, MEF2A, and
p-FOXO3 (all from Abcam, Cambridge, MA). The mem-
branes were washed thrice with TTBS for 5 minutes, fol-
lowed by incubation with diluted horseradish
peroxidase­conjugated goat antimouse or rabbit antigoat
IgG (1:2000) in TBS containing 5% (w/v) skimmed milk at
room temperature for 1 hour. The membranes were then
rinsed thrice with TTBS for 5 minutes, and an enhanced
chemiluminescence system (Thermo Scientific, San Jose,
CA) was used to visualize the bands on a ChemiDoc MP
system (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA).
RNA Extraction
Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Life
Technologies, Carlsbad, CA) according to the manufactur-
er's protocol. RNase-free DNase I (Promega, Madison, WI)
was used to reduce the DNA contamination. Total RNA
concentration and purity were determined by measuring the
absorbance ratio at 260:280 nm in a spectrophotometer
(RNA samples with ratios greater than 1.8 were used for the
analyses). The integrity of the RNA samples was also ascer-
tained by analyzing 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA using a
Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, Santa
Clara, CA).
Gene Expression Profiles
For microarray analysis, HepG2 cells (1 × 106 cells) were
seeded into 100-mm-diameter cell culture dishes. After 24
hours, the cells were treated with 1 or 10 µg/mL H cordata
extract for 6 hours. For control and test RNAs, synthesis of
target cRNAs and hybridization were performed using the
Low RNA Input Linear Amplification Kit PLUS (Agilent
Technology) according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Briefly, 0.5 µg total RNA from each sample was mixed with
diluted Spike Mix and T7 Promoter Primer Mix followed
by incubation at 65°C for 10 minutes. cDNA Master Mix
(5× first-strand buffer, 0.1 M DTT, 10 mM dNTP mix,
RNase-Out, and M-MLV reverse transcriptase enzyme) was
prepared and added to the reaction mixture. Amplified and
labeled cRNA was purified on RNase Mini Spin Columns
(Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) according to the manufacturer's
protocol. The labeled cRNA target was quantified using an
ND-1000 spectrophotometer (NanoDrop Technologies,
Wilmington, DE). After checking labeling efficiency, each
750-ng sample of cyanine 3­labeled and cyanine 5­labeled
cRNA target was mixed, and cRNA fragmentation was per-
formed by adding 10× blocking agent, 25× fragmentation
buffer, and incubating at 60°C for 30 minutes. The frag-
mented cRNA was resuspended in 2× hybridization buffer
and directly pipetted onto an assembled Agilent Human GE
4x44K microarray. The arrays were hybridized at 65°C for
17 hours using an Agilent hybridization oven. The hybrid-
ized microarrays were washed according to the manufac-
turer's washing protocol (Agilent Technology).
Data Acquisition and Analysis
The hybridized images were analyzed by an Agilent DNA
microarray scanner, and data quantification was performed
using the Agilent Feature Extraction software. The average
fluorescence intensity for each spot was calculated, and
local background was subtracted. All data normalization and
selection of fold-changed genes were performed using
GeneSpring GX 7.3 (Agilent Technology). Genes were fil-
tered by removing the flagged-out genes in each experiment.
Intensity-dependent normalization (Lowess) was performed,
where the ratio was reduced to the residual of the Lowess fit
of the intensity versus ratio curve. The means of the normal-
ized ratios were calculated by dividing the average of nor-
malizedsignalchannelintensitybytheaverageofnormalized
control channel intensity. Functional annotation of genes
was performed according to criteria of the Gene Ontology
Consortium (http://www.geneontology.org/index.shtml)
Kim et al 363
using GeneSpring GX 7.3. Gene classification was based on
searches performed on BioCarta (http://www.biocarta.
com/), Database for Annotation, Visualization, and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID; http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.
gov/), and MEDLINE databases (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/). Bioinformatic gene network analyses were performed
using IPA (http://www.ingenuity.com) to examine the bio-
logical functions of differentially regulated genes and pro-
teins according to ontology-related interaction networks.
IPAprovides protein interaction networks based on the regu-
larly updated "ingenuity pathways knowledgebase." The
network is optimized to include as many proteins from the
input expression profile as possible and aims to produce
highly connected networks.
Real-Time PCR
The sequences of forward and reverse primers for FOXO3
(NM_001455), HIF-1A (NM_181054), and MEF2A
(NM_001171894) were as follows: FOXO3 (forward)
5-ACA TGG GCT TGA GTG AGT CC-3 and (reverse)
5-GCC TGA GAG AGA GTC CGA GA-3; HIF1A (for-
ward) 5-TGCATC TCCATC TCC TAC CC-3 and (reverse)
5-CCT TTT CCT GCT CTG TTT GG-3; and MEF2A (for-
ward) 5-TCA GCT CTC TTG TTG CTG GA-3 and
(reverse) 5-AAA TCG GTT CGG ACT TGA TG-3. The
forward primer sequence for GAPDH (NM_002046) was
5-GGT CTC CTC TGA CTT CAA CA-3, and the reverse
primer sequence was 5-AGC CAA ATT CGT TGT CAT
AC-3. Total RNA (1 µg) was reverse transcribed to cDNA
according to the manufacturer's instructions (M-MLV
Reverse Transcriptase; Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Reactions
were carried out on an ABI Prism® 7900HT Sequence
Detection System (PEApplied Biosystems, Foster City, CA),
and relative transcript levels were determined using GAPDH
as the endogenous control (SYBR Green method). Each reac-
tion was performed in triplicate. Thermal cycling conditions
were 95°C for 10 minutes followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for
10 s, 60°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 20 s. Data were analyzed
using the Sequence Detection System software (SDS version
2.0, PE Applied Biosystems).
Biochemical Analysis
Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) were purchased from ST
Pharm (Seoul, Korea). The nucleotide sequence for HIF-1A
siRNAs was 5-AAG TCT GCA ACA TGG AAG GTA-3
(NM 181054.2), for FOXO3 siRNA was 5- GTG GAG CTG
GAC CCG GAG T-3 (NM_201559.2), and that for MEF2A
siRNA was 5-AAG CCT ATG AAC TTA GTG TGC-3
(NM_005587.2). Transfection of siRNAs into HepG2 cells
was performed using Lipofectamine RNAiMAX reagent
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) in accordance with the manufac-
turer's instructions. Cells were then treated with 10 µg/mL H
cordata for 48 hours.
Tumor Xenograft Experiment
For tumor xenograft experiments, 1 × 106 HepG2 cells sus-
pended in DMEM were injected subcutaneously into the
hind limb of 5-week-old nude (nu/nu Balb/c) mice, which
were then treated with PBS (6mice) or 20mg/kg H cordata
EtOAc fraction (6
mice) once daily for 20
days. The mice
were housed in a facility approved by the Association for
Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care
on a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle with food and water
ad libitum. The mice were killed humanely 21 days postin-
jection. Tumors were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in
PBS. The animal study was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the Korea
Basic Science Institute.
Immunohistochemistry
A 5-mm-thick section was cut across the dorsoventral diam-
eter of the tumor and fixed in ice-cold 10% paraformalin
overnight and embedded in paraffin. Serial sections (4-µm
thick) were cut and processed for immunohistological stain-
ing. Paraffin sections on the microslides were deparaf-
finized in xylene and rehydrated in sequential ethanol baths.
Antigen retrieval was achieved by incubation with 10mM
citrate buffer (pH
6.0) in a domestic microwave oven at
700W for 30minutes. The slides were quenched in hydro-
gen peroxide (3%) to block endogenous peroxidase activity
and washed in TBS (0.05
M, pH
7.6). The slides were
blocked with 3% BSA in PBS for 1hour at room tempera-
ture and incubated overnight at 4°C with primary antibodies
against the following: MEF2A (1:500; Dako), HIF-1A
(1:500), and FOXO3 (1:500). The Labeled Streptavidin
Biotin kit (Dako) based on the avidin-biotin peroxidase
complex method was used for detection, and slides were
counterstained with hematoxylin. Slides were dehydrated in
sequential ethanol baths, rinsed with xylene, and mounted
with Permount (ThermoFisher, Pittsburgh, PA).
Image Acquisition and Protein Quantification
Samples were analyzed with a Zeiss AxioImagerZ1 micros-
copy system with a charge-coupled device camera and the
TissueFAXS automated acquisition system (TissueGnostics,
Vienna, Austria). The percentages of antibody-positive and
stemness marker­positive tumors were determined and
depicted as scattergrams. Images were digitalized, and pro-
tein expression was quantified. Statistical analysis was per-
formed with the HistoQuest software (TissueGnostics).
Statistical Analysis
For gene expression profiles obtained by microarray, data
analysis was performed using GeneSpring GX version 7.3
(Agilent Technologies). Differentially expressed genes
364 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(3)
were identified using the Student's t-test with a P-value cut-
off of .05 and a fold-change threshold of 2.0. One-way anal-
ysis of variance (ANOVA) was used to determine significant
differences between untreated control and treated samples.
Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction
(RT-PCR) results were expressed as the mean ± SD from at
least 3 independent experiments. Data were analyzed using
Student's t-test. P values <.05 were considered statistically
significant.
Results
Quantification of H cordata Extract
LC-MS/MS analysis of H cordata extract revealed the pres-
ence of 5 compounds in the EtOAc, including neochlorogenic
acid, myricitrin, 2-O-acetylquercitrin, 6-O-acetylgenistin,
and thalifendine (Figure 1).
Effect of H cordata Extract on Cell Death
The effect of H cordata extract on cell death was analyzed
quantitatively using PI staining followed by flow cytometry
(Figure 2A). Specifically, the relative proportion of viable
and apoptotic cells can be measured on costaining with
annexin V. Treatment of HepG2 cells with 1 and 10 µg/mL
H cordata extract led to the induction of late apoptosis. The
proportion of apoptotic cells increased dramatically from
25.7% in control cells to 86.6% in cells treated with 10 µg/
mL of H cordata extract. However, no changes were
observed after treatment with 1 µg/mL of H cordata extract
(13.4%-15.7% early apoptotic cells and 24.4%-25.7% late
apoptotic cells). Thus, HepG2 cells appeared to be sensitive
to H cordata extract when used at 10 µg/mL.
Effect of H cordata Extract on Expression of
Apoptotic Proteins
HepG2 liver carcinoma cells expressed Bax, Bcl-2, Bid,
tBid, caspase-3, caspase-7, caspase-9, and PARP. Based on
the observation that H cordata extract induces apoptosis in
HepG2 cells, we examined the expression of apoptosis-
related signaling proteins using western blot analysis
(Figure 2B). H cordata extract treatment activated cas-
pase-3- and caspase-7-mediated apoptosis. The expression
of inactive caspase-3 (35 kDa) was decreased and that of
active caspase-3 (17 kDa) increased with increasing con-
centrations of H cordata extract (Figure 2B). Other pro-
apoptotic markers, such as Bax, increased slightly, whereas
the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 showed decreased expres-
sion following H cordata extract treatment.
Effect of H cordata Extract on Gene Expression
Profiles
To identify the potential genes involved in the anticancer
activity of H cordata, we performed a gene expression
microarray in HepG2 hepatocellular cancer cells after treat-
ment with H cordata extract. Among the 41
000 unique
genes (using Agilent's Human GE 4x44K Microarray)
tested, 18732 genes were expressed in cells treated with 1

quadrupole LC-MS for quantitative analysis; 100 mg of extract was mixed with 1 mL of methanol. Aliquots of 5 µL of the processed
samples were injected into the HPLC system. Data acquisition was performed with the MassHunter Software (version B.04.00).

or 10 µg/mL of H cordata extract. Among these 18
732
genes, 950 and 1910 genes were upregulated by treatment
with both 1 and 10 µg/mL H cordata extracts compared
with the untreated control at 6 hours. Conversely, these
treatments downregulated 117 and 693 genes, respectively.
The genes that were upregulated or downregulated by more
than 2-fold were significantly handled in data mining
categories.
Biologically relevant features were constructed using the
DAVID tools (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/). Gene lists cor-
responding to 2-fold up- and downregulation in the H cordata
extract­induced liver cancer cells were uploaded to DAVID
forGeneOntologyanalysis(Figure3Aleftpanel).Upregulated
genes included those involved in the regulation of mRNAtran-
scription, cell cycle, apoptosis, and chromosome segregation.
Downregulated genes included those involved in chromosome
organization, negative regulation of cell proliferation, and
response to stress. To compare the results obtained on H cor-
data extract treatment with potential genes that are involved in
apoptosis, we identified candidate genes using the GeneCards
database (http://www.genecards.org/). The intersection
obtained by hierarchical clustering is presented along with the
gene lists in Figure 3A (right panel). The signal network of
apoptotic genes in response to glucose is shown in Figure 3B.

Effect of H cordata Extract on Expression of
Transcriptional Regulators
Upstream regulator analysis using IPA identified the
upstream regulators (transcription regulators) of the apop-
totic network (eg,AHR, BRCA1, FOXO3, HIF-1A, MDM2,
MEF2A, and MEF2C) when comparing H cordata extract
treatment to untreated cells (control; Figure 4A). Based on
the microarray results, the expression levels of 3 upstream
regulators (transcription regulators: FOXO3, HIF-1A, and
MEF2A) were evaluated using RT-PCR. RT-PCR evalua-
tion indicated that the expression levels of these upstream
regulators were increased (about 2.5, 5.5, and 2.5-fold,
respectively) in a time-dependent manner on treatment with
1 and 10 µg/mL of H cordata extract, especially FOXO3 at
6 and 24 hours, when compared with controls (Figure 4B).
H cordata Regulated the Expression and
Intracellular Localization of FOXO3
To investigate whether H cordata affected the expression of
FOXO3 and HIF-1A, we analyzed the levels of HIF-1A,
FOXO3, and MEF2A in HepG2 cells under treatment with H
cordata. Western blot assay revealed that H cordata signifi-
cantly enhanced the expression of HIF-1A, FOXO3 (all
nucleus and cytosol), and MEF2A in a time-dependent man-
ner within 6 to 24 hours (Figure 5A). Akt can phosphorylate
FOXO transcription factors, which stimulates proteasomal
degradation. Therefore, we investigated the levels of Akt
phosphorylation (p-Akt) and also examined whether p-Akt
affected FOXO3 activation. p-Akt was significantly decreased
in HepG2 cells under H cordata treatment (Figure 5A).
FOXO3 Affects the Expression of Bcl-2 Family
of Proteins in HepG2 Cells Treated With H
cordata
To assess the apoptotic process, we performed western blot
analysis to evaluate the potential effect of FOXO3 on protein
levels of the Bcl-2 family. Our results revealed that FOXO3
silencing increased Bcl-2 and Bcl-xL expression, whereas it
decreased Bax, indicating that FOXO3 regulated the transcrip-
tion levels of the Bcl-2 protein family (Figure 5B). These data
suggested that the HIF-1A FOXO3 pathway is responsible for
H cordata­induced disturbance of Bcl-2 family of proteins.
HIF-1A Modulated H cordata­Induced FOXO3
Expression in HepG2 Cells
To investigate the effect of HIF-1A on H cordata­mediated
expression of FOXO transcription factors, we inhibited
HIF-1A activation by siRNA. Western blot results revealed
that HIF-1A expression increased rapidly in HepG2 cells

under H cordata treatment, which was reduced after tran-
sient transfection with HIF-1A siRNA (Figure 6A). Western
blot assay demonstrated that H cordata increased FOXO3
and p-FOXO3 protein levels, which were abolished on
HIF-1A silencing (Figure 6A), indicating that HIF-1A
increased FOXO3 transcription. Moreover, FOXO3
increased Bax expression, whereas decreasing Bcl-2 and
Bcl-xL expressions were also reversed by HIF-1A silencing
(Figure 6A). These data indicate that H cordata­induced
FOXO3 expression in HepG2 cells was modulated at least
in part by HIF-1A and that HIF-1A increases FOXO3 tran-
scription during apoptosis.

H cordata­Mediated FOXO3 Expression
Upregulates MEF2A and Activates Apoptosis-
Associated Caspases
Upregulation of MEF2A was detectable at 6 hours after
treatment with H cordata and was consistently observed
after treatment with H cordata for 24 hours (Figure 6A).
Inhibition of FOXO3 by siRNA transfection significantly
reduced MEF2A expression in HepG2 cells under H cor-
data. These data indicate that FOXO3 contributes to H cor-
data­induced MEF2A expression. We analyzed the
expression of MEF2A and apoptotic proteins in HepG2
cells transfected with FOXO3 siRNA. As shown in Figure
6B, FOXO3 silencing significantly reduced MEF2A, cas-
pase-3, and caspase-7. MEF2A silencing also reduced cas-
pase-3 and caspase-7 expression. These data indicate that
FOXO3 upregulates MEF2A expression, resulting in apop-
tosis induced via caspase-3 and caspase-7 activation.

Discussion
This study examined the biological effects of H cordata on
human liver HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cells. We per-
formed a cytotoxicity test to calculate the 50% growth
inhibitory (GI
50
) concentration of H cordata using an MTT
assay to determine the challenging dose for microarray
analysis. After 24 hours of incubation, the H cordata extract

showed moderate activity with a GI
50
of 10 µg/mL (data not
shown). We determined the effects of H cordata on the cell
cycle and on cell death after incubation of HepG2 cells with
the H cordata extract for 24 hours. H cordata extract at 10
µg/mL induced a significant increase in HepG2 apoptosis
(Figure 2A). Apoptosis of HepG2 cells by H cordata extract
was also associated with downregulation of antiapoptotic
Bcl-2 and upregulation of proapoptotic Bax protein expres-
sion. H cordata extract treatment induced proteolytic acti-
vation of caspase-3, caspase-7, and caspase-9 protein
expression (Figure 2B). These results were inconsistent
with those of a previous study demonstrating that H cordata
extract induces proteolytic activation of caspase-36 in
human lung cancer A549 cells. The apoptotic signaling
pathway was also observed in HepG2 cells treated with H
cordata extract in a microarray (Figure 3). Interestingly,
many kinds of transcriptional regulators were induced after
treatment with H cordata extract (Figure 4A). The expres-
sion levels of these transcriptional regulators--such as
FOXO3 (red-colored node in Figure 4A), HIF-1A (red-col-
ored node in Figure 4A), and MEF2A--in the H cordata
extract­treated HepG2 cells were confirmed by RT-PCR
and western blot in a dose- and time-dependent manner
(Figure 4B, 5A). The expressions of MEF2A, HIF-1A, and
FOXO3 were also slightly increased in xenografts (Figure
7). These findings suggest the possibility that HIF-1A,
FOXO3, and MEF2A function are significant regulators in
H cordata­mediated apoptosis of HepG2 cells. Parody
et al20 reported that FOXO3, a member of the FOXO family,
triggers the mitochondrial apoptotic pathway in the rat pre-
neoplastic liver through modulation by interferon 2b. To
our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the role of
HIF-1A and FOXO3 in H cordata­induced cancer cell
apoptosis.Thus, the underlying mechanism of HIF-1A and
FOXO3 pathways in H cordata­induced cancer cell apop-
tosis is still not fully understood. In this study, we revealed
that FOXO3 upregulated Bax and downregulated Bcl-2
(Figure 5B) and that HIF-1A increased FOXO3 expression
under H cordata treatment (Figure 6A). Furthermore, acti-
vation of the transcription factor FOXO3 causes MEF2A to
induce the activation of casapse-3, caspase-7, and Bax, in
addition to disturbing the expression of Bcl-2 family pro-
teins, which are critical mediators of apoptosis in HepG2
cells (Figure 5B, 6B). In mammals, the ability of FOXO
factors to mediate cell cycle arrest, DNA repair, and apop-
tosis makes them attractive as tumor suppressor candi-
dates.17,19 In this study, we investigated FOXO3 expression
in HepG2 cells and identified a novel connection between
FOXO3 and H cordata­induced apoptosis. siRNA-medi-
ated HIF-1A inhibition also attenuated p-FOXO3 (Figure
6A). FOXO transcription factors can be phosphorylated by
Akt, a serine/threonine-specific protein kinase. p-Akt atten-
uates FOXO3 translocation into the nucleus, its binding
with 14-3-3 protein, and eventual proteasomal degradation.
Our results revealed that H cordata attenuated p-Akt in a
time-dependent manner (Figure 5A) and that H cordata

daily for 20days. Tumor tissues were collected in 10% ice-cold paraformaldehyde and paraffin-embedded blocks were prepared for
immunohistochemistry of MEF2A, HIF-1A, and FOXO3. (B) Quantification of MEF2A, HIF-1A, and FOXO3. Data are presented as the

treatment resulted in a significant increase in the expression
of HIF-1A and FOXO3 (Figures 5A and 5B), indicating that
H cordata decreased the proteasomal degradation of
FOXO3.
In a previous study, a pivotal role for the Reactive
Oxygen Species -p38 Mitogen activated Protein kinase
(ROS-p38 MAPK) axis was demonstrated in controlling
the tumor-initiating capacity of glioma-initiating cells
(GICs).21 Meanwhile, the activation of the ROS-p38 axis
has a significant inhibitory effect on tumor growth.22
MEF2 is also activated via the p38-dependent pathway.23
The p38-MEF2 pathway signals survival-promoting gene
regulation, but when interrupted by excessive caspase
activation, this pathway becomes proapoptotic.24 Our
results reveal that H cordata­mediated HIF-1A upregu-
lated MEF2A directly (Figure 6A) and also indirectly via
FOXO3 (Figure 6B). Based on these results and previous
studies, we speculated that MEF2A functions as a signifi-
cant regulator in H cordata­mediated apoptosis of HepG2
cells. Thus, activation of the ROS-p38 axis is responsible
for MEF2A expression, suggesting that the ROS-p38-
MEF2 pathway becomes proapoptotic on excessive cas-
pase-3 and caspase-7 activation. Taken together, the
multipathway proapoptotic function and the unique acti-
vation of HIF-1A­FOXO3 and MEF2A pathways suggest
that H cordata may be a promising natural product extract
for potential use in liver cancer. We found that H cordata
induces apoptosis through the activation of transcription
regulators, such as HIF-1A, FOXO3, and MEF2A. It will
also be important to identify the precise cellular targets of
H cordata, which may help further elucidate the mecha-
nisms of its antitumor functions and contribute to the
development of more effective anticancer drugs.
Conclusions
Our results demonstrate that H cordata­mediated HIF-1A
upregulates MEF2A directly and also indirectly via
FOXO3 in HepG2 cells. Thus, we have demonstrated
that H cordata shows anticancer activity in liver cancer
cells by inducing apoptosis through activation of tran-
scription regulators, such as HIF-1A, FOXO3, and
MEF2A. These findings not only suggest that an EtOAc
fraction derived from H cordata is a promising natural
extract for potential use in liver cancer therapy, but also
demonstrate that exploring compounds capable of induc-
ing apoptosis and activity of upstream transcription regu-
lators is a promising strategy for drug discovery against
liver cancer.
