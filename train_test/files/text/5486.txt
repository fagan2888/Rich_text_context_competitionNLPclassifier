2 The percentage of cells with chromosome aberrations or micronuclei induced by low doses of acute
(dose rate of 47 cGy/min) or chronic (dose rate of 0.01 cGy/min) gamma-irradiation was studied
in vitro in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, human lymphocytes, and Vicia faba seeds and seedlings.
The sensitivity of the indicated biological entities to low doses was greater than expected based on
linear extrapolation from higher doses. The dose-response curves for cytogenetic damage that were
obtained were nonlinear when evaluated over the full range of the doses used. At very low doses,
the dose-response curves appeared linear, followed by a plateau region at intermediate doses. At high
doses the dose response curves again appeared linear with a slope different from that for the low-dose
region. There was no statistically significant difference between the yields of cells with micronuclei
induced by low doses of acute versus chronic irradiation. Similar data were obtained both for human
lymphocyte culture and for roots and seeds of Vicia faba. Our experiments revealed that the dose
range over which the plateau occurs depends on the type of cells irradiated. We have also shown that
the modifying effects of the repair inhibitor caffeine and the radioprotector mercaptoethylenamine
(MEA) are absent at low doses of gamma irradiation and that caffeine increased the number of cells
with cytogenetic damage when evaluated over the plateau region. In the presence of MEA, the upper
end of the plateau region was extended from just above 1 Gy to about 2 Gy. We therefore provide
direct evidence that a plateau exists in the dose-response curve for the indicated radiation-induced
stochastic effects. Furthermore, our results suggest that, for low linear energy transfer radiation, the
induction of DNA repair occurs only after a threshold level of cytogenetic damage and that the higher
yield of cytogenetic damage per unit dose at low radiation doses is attributable to an insignificant
contribution or the absence of DNA repair processes.

INTRODUCTION
The linear no-threshold (LNT) hypothesis is the basis for radiation pro-
tection standards at low doses. However, questions about the validity of the
LNT model remain. Validation of the LNT model is the most important is-
sue related to radiation risk assessment. Studies of cytogenetic effects can
provide key information related to the validity of the LNT model. Cyto-
genetic effects of ionizing radiation have been studied in vitro in human

(Fenech and Morley, 1985; Mitchell and Norman, 1987) and mouse and
rat (Erexson et al., 1991) lymphocyte cultures, and in cultures of mam-
malian cells (Marples and Joiner, 1993; Zaichkina et al., 1995; Shmakova
et al., 2002). They have also been studied in vivo in mouse bone marrow cells
(Jenssen and Ramel, 1976, 1978; Cole et al., 1981; Jagetia and Ganapathi,
1994) and in plant cells (Oudalova et al., 2002). However, dose-response
curves obtained by the different research groups using the various cell types
are different. With human lymphocyte cultures, a linear dose­response re-
lationship was found (Fenech and Morley, 1985), whereas in other studies
a departure from a linear relationship was reported (Mitchell and Norman,
1987). In mice, a deviation from the linear dose-response curve was revealed
for in vivo exposure. Jagetia and Ganapathi (1994) used the micronucleus
assay in mice and showed that the dose-response curve had a linear-quadratic
form. However, a linear dose-response curve was also obtained by others us-
ing the same method (Cole et al., 1981; Uma Devi and Sharma, 1990). Many
years ago it was shown by Russel (1965) that the mutation yield per unit
dose was higher at low doses of radiation than at high doses. Similar results
were obtained by studying radiation-induced cytogenetic damage (Luchnik
and Sevankaev, 1976; Pohl-Rulling et al., 1983; Lloyd et al., 1988; Zaichkina
et al., 1997), transformation (Oftedal, 1990), and cell survival (Joiner, 1994;
Joiner et al., 1996). Joiner et al. (2001) showed that most cell lines have hyper-
radiosensitivity to very low radiation doses, which is not predicted by back-
extrapolation of the cell survival curve from higher doses. Such nonlinear
data have led to the recent view that biological effects of ionizing radia-
tion should not be extrapolated from high to low doses based on the LNT
model.
The aim of the present study was to investigate the shape of the dose-
response relationship for specific cytogenetic effects after low doses of low-
linear-energy-transfer (LET) ionizing radiation using mammalian and plant
cells.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
In our previous studies, we initiated investigations of biological responses
to ionizing radiation exposure using the occurrence of chromosomal rear-
rangements as the endpoint scored (Zaichkina and Ganassi, 1984; Zaichkina
et al., 1992, 1995). Based on results of those studies, we have subsequently
used different radiation dose ranges for the different bioassays associated
with our studies of radiation-induced stochastic effects.
In our present study, Chinese hamster fibroblasts (clone 431) were culti-
vated at 37C, in a humidified atmosphere under 5% CO2. Cell culture was
grown in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium containing 10% calf serum and
antibiotics. The cells were irradiated with acute doses of 0.05­2 Gy of 60Co

gamma-rays at a dose rate of 28.2 Gy/h. The chronic gamma-irradiation was
carried out for 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 days at room temperature at a dose rate
of 0.0061 Gy/h, with cumulative doses of 0.14, 0.28, 0.42, 0.56, and 0.84 Gy,
respectively. The technique for preparation of samples for the micronucleus
test has been previously described (Zaichkina and Ganassi, 1984).
When the cells were fixed immediately after chronic irradiation, no dam-
age was observed. To detect cytogenetic damage, the irradiated and control
cells kept at room temperature were stored for 24 h at 37C before fixation.
Several experiments were performed for each radiation dose. About 10,000
cells were analyzed for each radiation dose point.
Whole human blood from ten essentially healthy males was irradiated
with acute doses of 0.1­0.5 Gy at a dose rate of 28.2 Gy/h. Other blood
samples were also chronically irradiated at a dose rate of 0.0061 Gy/h at a 37C
temperature during 0.5, 1, and 2 days with cumulative doses of 0.07, 0.13, and
0.27 Gy, respectively. Whole blood (0.2 ml) was cultivated by the micromethod
(Zaichkina et al., 1997). Cytogenetic analysis was carried out based on 150­200
metaphase cells scored from each blood sample. All structural chromosome-
type and chromatid-type changes were recorded. Preliminary experiments
showed that the conditions of blood-sample irradiation affected neither the
background level of chromosomal damage nor radiosensitivity (Zaichkina
et al., 1997).
Air-dried seeds of Vicia faba were soaked and germinated at 21C during
36­48 h until the roots reached 1­1.5 cm in length. The roots of Vicia faba
were irradiated with doses of 0.1­2.5 Gy of acute gamma irradiation at a
dose rate of 28.2 Gy/h. The end of the 1.5­2-mm roots were fixed 24 h after
irradiation and stained by the Fulgen method; 50­100 plants were used for
each variant, and 1000 cells from each plant were analyzed.
Air-dried seeds of Vicia faba were also irradiated with doses of 2­40 Gy at a
dose rate of 1.4 Gy/min, soaked, germinated, and processed for cytogenetic
analysis as described earlier.
All cytological slides were coded blind and analyzed by the investigators
independently. Experiments were repeated at least three times. In the figures,
results are presented as means +/- standard error.
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
The dose dependence of the yield of cytogenetic damage in Chinese
hamster cells after acute and chronic gamma-irradiation is presented in
Figure 1. The dose­response curve used is discontinuous. At very low doses,
the dependence of cytogenetic damage on dose was fitted by a linear re-
gression with a zero intercept. In the dose range of about 0.5­1 Gy, there
is a plateau, and above this range the curve again appears linear but with a
different slope. There was no statistically significant difference between the

results for the low doses of chronic and acute irradiation for the investigated
dose range.
Similar results were obtained for human lymphocyte culture. The dose
dependence of the yield of chromosome aberrations in human lymphocytes
induced by acute and chronic gamma-irradiation is presented in Figure 2.
It can be seen that the obtained high- and low dose rate data for chromo-
some aberrations were adequately described by single, discontinuous dose-
response relationships with an initial linear increase followed by a plateau.
Thus, as was the case with Chinese hamster fibroblasts, for the low-dose re-
gion, no influence of dose rate was found.
The dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in root cells of Vicia
faba by gamma-ray exposure can also be described using a similar discon-
tinuous function, but the plateau spans a different dose range, 0.5­1 Gy
(Figure 3), than in Figure 1. Using the radioresistant model of Vicia faba dry
seeds, we found that the dose-response curve for micronuclei induction is
similar to the dose-response curves in Figure 3, except that the plateau was
observed in the dose range of about 8­32 Gy (data not shown). Thus, our ex-
periments revealed that the dose range over which the plateau occurs differs
for the different biological systems. For radiosensitive systems, the plateau
occurs at lower doses than for radioresistant systems.

Our data demonstrate that the dose-response curves for micronuclei in-
duction in Chinese hamster fibroblasts, human lymphocytes, and root cells
and dry seeds of Vicia faba exposed to acute and chronic gamma-radiation
can all be described by a discontinuous function comprising three parts:
(1) a low-dose linear segment (linear segment 1); (2) a plateau at interme-
diate doses; and (3) a high-dose linear segment (linear segment 2).
We hypothesized that the indicated complex shape of the dose-response
curves relates to the status of DNA repair processes. Previously we have shown
that caffeine, an inhibitor of DNA repair, increases the number of cells with
micronuclei in linear segment 2 (Zaichkina et al., 1992, 1995). To verify the as-
sumption that low doses of gamma-radiation do not induce repair processes,
we studied the influence of the DNA repair inhibitor caffeine on the dose de-
pendence of the induction of chromosome aberrations in Chinese hamster
fibroblast cultures. Figure 4 shows the dose-response curves for micronuclei
induction in fibroblasts irradiated with low doses of gamma-radiation in the
presence of caffeine and without caffeine. Caffeine was added to the culture
medium (final concentration 0.08 M, pH 6.5­6.8) prior to irradiation. The
cells were kept in the medium with caffeine after irradiation up to fixation.

(28.2 Gy/h) gamma-irradiation with and without caffeine treatment. Caffeine was added to culture
medium prior to irradiation at a final concentration of 0.08 M, pH 6.5­6.8. Results (means ± standard
errors) of six experiments without caffeine and three experiments with caffeine treatment are shown.

There was no modifying effect of caffeine for linear segment 1; however,
for the plateau region and for linear segment 2, caffeine caused significant
changes in the dose-response curve. More specifically, caffeine treatment led
to the disappearance of the plateau (effectively extending linear segment 1).
Another approach for validating our hypothesis was to investigate the
action of low doses of secondary radiation from 70 GeV protons and neu-
trons (90%) and of chronic monoenergetic neutrons generated by the
Serpukhov charged particle accelerator on cytogenetic damage in mam-
malian cells. Using inhibitors of DNA repair we have shown that high doses
of gamma-radiation induced repair, in contrast to neutrons which inhibit
repair of cytogenetic damage (Zaichkina et al., 1995). It was found that, in
contrast to the gamma-irradiation, the dose-response curves after exposure
to high-LET neutrons for all the cytogenetic endpoints were linear; that is,
the plateau was absent (Rozanova et al., 2000). These results suggest that
the induction by gamma-rays of DNA repair processes occurs in the dose
range corresponding to the plateau. Thus, it can be assumed that the in-
duction of repair by low-LET radiation occurs only after a threshold level
of cytogenetic damage and that the increased yield of cytogenetic damage
per unit dose at low radiation doses is attributable to an insignificant con-
tribution or the absence of DNA repair. Recently, Rothkamm and Lobrich
(2003) have shown a lack of DNA double-strand-break repair in primary hu-
man fibroblasts exposed to very low doses (approximately 1 mGy) of ionizing
radiation.
Figure 5 shows the dose-response curves for micronuclei induction in the
culture of Chinese hamster fibroblasts irradiated in the presence and with-
out b-mercaptoethylenamine (MEA), a well-known radioprotector. MEA was
added (final concentration 0.1 mM) to the culture medium 15 min before
irradiation and the cells were kept in the medium with MEA for 2 h after
irradiation. As with caffeine, no modifying effect of MEA in linear segment
1 was observed but the plateau region was extended from just above 1 Gy to
about 2 Gy. This is direct evidence that a plateau exists and that our interpre-
tation of the experimental results are plausible.
Recently in our study involving irradiated mice, we showed that the in vivo
dose-response curve for micronuclei induction in bone marrow cells is also
nonlinear and also consists of the three indicated segments (linear segment
1, plateau, linear segment 2) (Zaichkina et al., 1998).
The results we have presented indicate that dose-response curves both in
mammalian and plant cells are nonlinear and reflect hypersensitivity of cells
to low radiation doses that is not predicted by back-extrapolation of cytoge-
netic response from higher doses. Although further studies are required to
reveal the molecular mechanisms associated with the observed dose-response
relationships, our results suggest that the hypersensitivity may be attributed
to a lack of induced DNA repair at very low radiation doses. Altogether, our

containing MEA for 2 h after irradiation. Results (means ± standard errors) of six experiments without

results provide additional evidence that low doses of low-LET radiation could
have more significant genetic consequences than would be expected based
on extrapolating from high to low doses based on the LNT model
