BACKGROUND: The reasons blacks have higher mortality rates from colorectal cancer (CRC) than non-Hispanic
whites are not fully understood. Blacks have higher rates of vitamin D deficiency than non-Hispanic whites, and vita-
min D deficiency has been associated with CRC. The authors of this report investigated the association of vitamin D
deficiency with excess risk for CRC mortality for blacks in the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) that was conducted from 1988 to 1994. METHODS: The association between serum 25(OH)D levels and
CRC mortality and its contribution to elevated risk among blacks were studied using baseline data from NHANES III
and CRC mortality data through 2006 from the National Death Index. By using survival models, the adjusted risk of
death from CRC for African Americans was examined with and without adjusting for vitamin D deficiency, which was
defined as an 25(OH)D level <20 ng/dL. RESULTS: Black race (hazard ratio [HR], 2.03; 95% confidence interval [95%
CI], 1.04-3.95), age (HR, 1.12; 95% CI, 1.09-1.15), not having health insurance (HR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.12-5.36), and a history
of CRC (HR, 7.22; 95% CI, 2.12-24.6) predicted CRC mortality. When added to the model, vitamin D deficiency was
associated significantly with CRC mortality (HR, 2.11; 95% CI, 1.11-4.00), and the effect of race was decreased (HR,
1.60; 95% CI, 0.87-2.93); the 40% attenuation was statistically significant (F1,49
¼ 4.85; P ¼ .03). Similar results were
observed when participants who had a history of CRC were excluded from the analysis. CONCLUSIONS: The current
findings were consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin D deficiency contributes to excess African-American mor-
tality from CRC. Cancer 2011;117:1061­9. V

African Americans have higher incidence and death from colorectal cancer (CRC) than non-Hispanic white Ameri-
cans,1 and disparities have been widening.2 The reasons for this disparity remain uncertain.3 Sociodemographic and insur-
ance factors contribute but may not fully explain racial disparities in incidence and survival.3,4 In addition, larger and
more proximal colonic polyps are observed more often among blacks than among non-Hispanic whites.2,5,6 These find-
ings have led to speculation that differences in tumor biology,4,7 in addition to differences in screening and follow-up,8,9
may contribute to these disparities.
Low serum vitamin D levels represent a possible mechanism for the higher CRC incidence and mortality observed
among blacks. Black Americans have significantly lower mean serum levels of vitamin D than whites across the life-
span.10,11 This difference is attributable largely to darker skin pigmentation, which reduces the activation of oral vitamin
D,12 in addition to lower intake of foods that contain vitamin D13 and less sun exposure.14
Growing observational data suggest that low serum vitamin D levels are associated with colonic adenomas, CRC,
and CRC mortality.15-18 The International Agency for Research on Cancer of the World Health Organization reviewed
evidence and concluded that evidence for vitamin D levels in reducing cancer risk was strongest for CRC, but randomized
controlled trials were needed to confirm a causal role.19 Thus, if causality can be established, then it is plausible that low
vitamin D levels might contribute to the observed racial disparity in CRC mortality.20,21

Original Article
The objective of the current study was to test the hy-
pothesis that low serum vitamin D levels may help to
explain the correlation between black race and CRC mor-
tality. Specifically, we examined whether vitamin D defi-
ciency assessed at baseline in a national US sample would
be associated with CRC mortality and whether this associ-
ation may partly mediate the racial disparity in CRC
mortality.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Participants
We constructed a retrospective cohort using publicly
available data from the nationally representative Third
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III), which was conducted from 1988 to
1994.22 Our sample was restricted to participants aged
!20 years who participated in the baseline examination
and were eligible for mortality follow-up. Serum
25(OH)D levels were available for 15,772 individuals,
corresponding to 95.2% of the target population
(weighted).
Vitamin D
Serum 25(OH)D was measured using a radioimmunoas-
say kit (DiaSorin, Stillwater, Minn).23 Although 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D is the biologically active form of vita-
min D, serum 25(OH)D is regarded as the best indicator
of vitamin D status in individuals without kidney dis-
ease.24 We defined vitamin D deficiency based on a
25(OH)D level <20 ng/dL.25 This corresponds to the
lowest quintile in the NHANES sample.
Race and Ethnicity
We assessed race and ethnicity based on self-reported race
and ethnicity (white, black, Latino, and other).
CRC Deaths
Assessment of death continued from data collection until
December 31, 2006 and was based on the NHANES III
Linked Mortality file from the National Death Index
using International Statistical Classification of Diseases,
10th Revision (ICD-10) 3-digit codes.26 CRC mortality
was based on codes C18 through C21. Publicly available
data do not permit coding below this level. Follow-up was
censored at the date of death for individuals who died of
other diseases and at December 31, 2006 for those who
were not identified as dead.
Covariates
To address confounding of the relation between vitamin
D and CRC, we assessed a range of potential variables that
have been associated previously with colonic neoplasia
and/or CRC mortality. These included educational level
(<high school, high school, or >high school),27 house-
hold income as a percentage of the Federal Poverty Level
(<100%, 100%-149%, 150%-199%, 200%-299%, or
!300%),28 health insurance status (insured or unin-
sured),29,30 smoking status (current, former, or never),31
body mass index (<20 kg/m2, 20-25.5 kg/m2, 25.5-29.9
kg/m2, or !30 kg/m2),32 diabetes (based on self-report, a
fasting glucose level >126 mg/dL, or glycohemoglobin
>6%),33 physical activity level (both self-reported physi-
cal inactivity [about the same or less than most individu-
als] and average metabolic equivalent task score per
month),33 alcohol intake (g/day),33 dietary calcium intake
(g/day),34 meat intake (servings/day),33 dietary fiber
intake (g/day),35 and dietary saturated fat intake
(g/day).36 We also included the region of the country (a
series of dummy variables) and the month of vitamin D
testing. Region is associated with vitamin D levels because
of differences in sunlight (ie, ultraviolet [UV] radiation
exposure)2 and with rates of CRC screening.37 Vitamin D
levels fluctuate according to the time of year because of
differences in UV exposure.2 We also included a dichoto-
mous variable for reported history of CRC at baseline.
Statistical Analyses
Analyses were conducted with the SUDAAN (version,
10.01; RTI International, Research Triangle Park, NC)
and Stata (version 10.1; Stata, Inc., College Station, Tex)
statistical software packages. The analyses were adjusted
for the complex survey design of NHANES III to yield
appropriate standard errors and population parameter
estimates.
We implemented Cox semiparametric proportional
hazards survival analyses and compared the results with
proportional hazards parametric log-linear (Poisson)
regression models.38,39 In the Poisson models, each indi-
vidual contributed an observation for each full or partial
year of follow-up, and offset terms were used to control
for variations in observation lengths. The adjusted hazard
ratios (HRs) estimated in the Cox models were very simi-
lar to the adjusted incidence rate ratios estimated in the
Poisson models. The parametric Poisson models were
developed because they allow formal statistical compari-
son of parameter estimates among nested models. Two
main models were developed. Model 1 excluded vitamin

D, and Model 2 included vitamin D. The parameter esti-
mates for black individuals from the 2 Poisson models
were compared using the method of Clogg et al40 as a test
for the hypothesis that vitamin D partly mediates the
increased CRC mortality risk for African Americans.41
The percentage attenuation was defined as 100*(bModel 1
À bModel 2
)/(bModel 1
), where b is the parameter estimate
for black race.
Independent variables that were included in the
analyses were age, sex, race/ethnicity (non-Hispanic
white, black, Hispanic, and other), and serum 25(OH)D
deficiency (present or absent). To minimize bias from
missing data and avoid over fitting, we omitted potentially
confounding variables that met the following criteria: 1) P
values >.20 and 2) an effect on the parameter estimates of
25(OH)D or race by <10%. The final model included
education, health insurance, BMI, and history of CRC.
For each of the covariates in our regression models, we
examined smoothed scatter plots of the scaled Schoenfeld
residuals versus follow-up time to assess the appropriate-
ness of our proportional hazards specification.42
Sensitivity analyses were used to examine the contri-
bution of nonlinear components of all continuous covari-
ates, including 25(OH)D as a continuous variable or by
quintiles and excluding individuals who had CRC at base-
line. We also examined interactions between 25(OH)D
and age, sex, and race.
RESULTS
The mean serum 25(OH)D level in the sample was 29.5
ng/mL (73.6 nmol/L). Table 1 shows the distribution of
baseline characteristics among individuals with and with-
out deficient levels. In bivariate analyses, 25(OH)D defi-
ciency was associated with older age; being a man or being
black; region of the country; the time of year tested; less
education; lower income; no health insurance; currently
smoking; higher BMI; less physical activity; diabetes; and
less intake of fiber, meat, saturated fat, and calcium.
There were 91 CRC deaths (0.4% of total mortality;
population weighted) among individuals who had no
missing data. The association of risk factors with CRC
death is summarized in Table 2. In Model 1 (25[OH]D
omitted), CRC death was associated with older age, black
race, not having health insurance, and a history of CRC.
Blacks had twice the risk of dying of CRC as non-His-
panic whites. This relation was not affected appreciably
by forcing the inclusion of any of the covariates, including
poverty, into the model. When vitamin D was added
(Model 2), deficiency was associated with a 2-fold
increased risk of CRC mortality. Notably, adding vitamin
D deficiency to the model attenuated the CRC mortality
risk associated with being black by 40%, and the attenua-
tion was significant (F1,49
¼ 4.85; P ¼ .03).
The sensitivity analyses produced no evidence for
nonlinear effects for any of the continuous variables and
revealed a significant effect for 25(OH)D when it was
included as a continuous variable (and attenuation of the
parameter estimate for black race was consistent with that
reported). Analyses that excluded individuals who had
CRC at baseline were consistent with those presented.
There were no significant interactions between 25(OH)D
and age, sex, or race.
DISCUSSION
By using a nationally representative sample of adults from
the United States, we examined the hypothesis that vita-
min D deficiency contributes to the black-white racial dis-
parity in death from CRC. We observed that being black
was associated with higher CRC mortality compared with
being whites, and adjusting for vitamin D deficiency atte-
nuated this race effect by 40%. The attenuation did not
appear to be attributable to a range of potential confound-
ers, including those related to socioeconomic status,
health insurance, or behavioral risk factors. These findings
are consistent with the hypothesis that vitamin D defi-
ciency explains a portion of the observed black-white dis-
parity in CRC mortality and raise the possibility that
vitamin D supplementation may reduce this disparity.
The current study adds to a growing body of evi-
dence indicating that there is an association between vita-
min D and CRC incidence and/or mortality. The
adjusted risk of vitamin D on CRC mortality observed in
our study was slightly higher than the risk on CRC inci-
dence derived from meta-analysis18 but similar to an effect
on mortality that was observed with a shorter follow-up
period in this cohort.43 The findings of the current study
are consistent with prior observational studies but go
beyond previous research to explore the relation between
vitamin D deficiency and CRC disparities among African
Americans.
A review of the published literature on the associa-
tion between vitamin D and CRC revealed a lack of evi-
dence from randomized controlled trials that vitamin D
supplementation prevents CRC.44 Therefore, causality
has not been established definitively, and chemopreven-
tion has been proven effective only for intermediate

points to a link between vitamin D deficiency and CRC.
These data include geographic incidence and UV expo-
sure studies, biologic mechanism studies, and data from
observational studies of serum levels on the incidence of
adenomas and of CRC with accompanying dose-response
relations.
To summarize these different lines of evidence, pre-
vious epidemiologic studies demonstrated a higher inci-
dence of CRC at higher latitudes and/or with greater UV

exposure in the United States and Asia.45-47 However, in
the study from China, the effects were observed only in
women.46 In a study from Norway, no north-south gradi-
ent was observed for CRC mortality, but survival was
improved among those who were diagnosed in summer
and fall, when serum levels of vitamin D were highest.48
More recent studies explain possible mechanisms of
vitamin D that protect against colorectal neoplasia. Vita-
min D, possibly in combination with calcium intake,
appears to promote colorectal epithelial cell differentia-
tion and apoptosis, increase DNA mismatch-repair pro-
teins, and reduce oxidative damage and adenoma
recurrence.49-54 Furthermore, polymorphisms in the vita-
min D receptor have been associated with the risk of ade-
noma and cancer in various studies.55,56 Although these
data come from mostly studies that were conducted on
participants without neoplasms at baseline, it is possible
that similar processes accelerate the progression of cancer,
potentially affecting both incidence and survival.
In contrast to geographic and mechanistic studies,
the current study contributes to a body of research exam-
ining associations between serum vitamin D levels and
CRC risk. A meta-analysis of serum 25(OH)D and the
incidence of colonic adenomas revealed an inverse, graded
response.15 Gorham et al conducted a quantitative meta-
analysis of nested case-control studies on serum levels of
prediagnostic 25(OH)D and the subsequent incidence of
CRC.18 In 3 of the 6 studies, statistically significant asso-
ciations were observed. A meta-analysis of all 6 studies
revealed a significant effect and dose-response with the
very lowest levels associated with the highest incidence. A
subsequent meta-analysis that was conducted by different

investigators and included 8 studies reached similar con-
clusions.57 A large, nested case-control study from Europe
that was published after the meta-analyses were conducted
also revealed a strong, inverse, linear relation between se-
rum 25(OH)D and CRC incidence.17 In addition, higher
vitamin D levels predicted improved CRC survival.58
Consistent with these studies, our findings reveal a signifi-
cant association between low serum levels of 25(OH)D
and CRC mortality.
To date, limited attention has been paid to the possi-
ble role of vitamin D deficiency in the black-white dispar-
ity in CRC21 despite documentation of much higher rates
of vitamin D deficiency among blacks of all ages.10,11 The
current results suggest that the racial disparity in CRC
mortality is explained in part by vitamin D deficiency in
the NHANES III cohort. We observed no interaction
between race and serum 25(OH)D levels. Thus, given the
high rates of vitamin D deficiency among blacks in this
national sample and the finding of an overall effect of low
levels with CRC mortality, it is not surprising that defi-
ciency among blacks contributed to the racial disparity in
CRC deaths. This finding is noteworthy. If it is demon-
strated that vitamin D supplementation reduces CRC,
then it could have a substantial impact on the racial dis-
parity in CRC mortality.
Important limitations of these findings include the
sample size, the ascertainment of CRC deaths, a single
measurement of vitamin D, and the potential for unmeas-
ured confounding. Consistent with previous studies,29,30
lack of insurance remained a significant predictor of CRC
death in the final model, yielding a 2.5-fold increase in
risk. However, that variable was measured only at base-
line, and subsequent changes in health insurance may
have confounded the correlation between race and CRC
mortality. Socioeconomic status is a multidimensional
construct that arguably includes factors such as commu-
nity of residence, which were not available in these data,59
and residual confounding between race and socioeco-
nomic status is possible. Furthermore, although our initial
cohort was fairly large, the relatively small number of
CRC deaths reduced our power to detect effects, and the
confidence intervals were wide.
Death certificate data appear to be reasonably accu-
rate for ascertaining CRC deaths but may over-report co-
lon cancer deaths and under-report rectal cancer.60
Findings from a meta-analysis demonstrated effects of
vitamin D on both colon cancers and rectal cancers.57
Thus, this misclassification may be moot. The level of
coding of cancer permitted in public data may have
included anal cancer. The pathophysiology of anal cancer
differs fundamentally from that of CRC but likely had a
negligible effect on our findings given its very low
incidence.61
Although we measured vitamin D at a single point
in time, prospective studies have revealed moderate corre-
lations (0.7) over time.58 Any change in levels likely
would bias the results toward the null because of measure-
ment error. Finally, although we controlled for multiple
factors, confounding cannot be fully excluded in observa-
tional studies. Previous cancer protective effects observed
for various nutrients have failed to hold up in randomized
controlled trials and, in some cases (for example, beta car-
otene for smokers), has been associated with increased
risk.62
In conclusion, the current findings add to the grow-
ing body of literature on the association between vitamin
D and CRC57 and provide the first direct evidence that
high rates of vitamin D deficiency among blacks may
account for some of the racial disparity in CRC deaths.
These findings underscore the need for randomized con-
trolled trials, such as the Vitamin D and Omega-3 Trial
(VITAL) Study,63 to assess whether supplementation
with much higher doses than currently recommended not
only will reduce deaths from CRC in general but also will
reduce the black-white racial disparity in the second lead-
ing cause of cancer-related death in the United States.
