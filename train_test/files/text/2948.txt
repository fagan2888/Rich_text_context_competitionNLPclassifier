Enterprises' financing structure and their response to monetary policy
stimuli - an analysis based on the Deutsche Bundesbank's corporate
balance sheet statistics
Summary
The traditional monetary policy transmission mechanism is based on the fact that, in the wake
of a restrictive monetary policy stance, the interest rate rises and that therefore
interest-rate-related variables, such as corporate asset formation, dec1ine or increase less
sharply than at the given interest rate. For some years now economists - especiaIly in the
Anglo-Saxon countries - have been discussing the credit channel approach, which embraces
the credit supply as weIl as the interest rate channeL A crucial factor in this context is that
information between the lender and the borrower is asymmetric. This primarily affects small
enterprises, whose creditworthiness is, as a rule, not as good as that oflarge firms and which
are heavily reliant on bank credit. The credit channel theory states that, for small enterprises,
a stricter monetary policy stance results in a higher cost of borrowed funds than for larger
enterprises or even in credit rationing. The result is that this group ofenterprises cuts its asset
formation particularly sharply.
A number of studies have confirmed the existence of the credit channel, particularly for the
United States. By contrast, only few German studies to date have analysed the susceptibility
of enterprises' investment behaviour to monetary policy stimuli in the context of the credit
channel. The verification of this link is the subject of the present study. The Bundesbank's
corporate balance sheet statistics serve as a database. These statistics inc1ude not only
enterprises subject to disc10sure requirements but also relatively small firms, which dominate
the German corporate landscape. A simple descriptive-statistical approach was chosen for the
evaluation owing to the limitation to group data and to periods with a restrictive monetary
policy. To this extent, this research is a first contribution to the credit channel discussion in
Germany.
The existence of the credit channel cannot be demonstrated empirically by means of the
available source material for Germany, in contrast to the United States. Regardless of the
period under review and the legal form ofthe firms, bank loans and other liabilities as weIl as
the cost ofcredit provide no indication for any discrimination of smaller enterprises by banks
in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy stance. Two aspects no doubt playa role in this
context: the house bank principle, which is widespread in Germany, and the nature of
bankruptcy legislation and property law, whieh in Germany is more favourable to ereditors
than abroad, reduce the asymmetrie distribution of information between banks and small
finns.
The source material used constitutes a positive sample ofenterprises, however. Owing to the
construetion ofcylindered samples it comprises enterprises whieh are at least five years old,
i.e. it contains no very young finns. Moreover, the data are derived ftom the annual accounts
submitted in the context ofrediscount business, whieh means that the enterprises sampled all
have a relatively good creditworthiness. Even if, consequently, hardlyany "marginal finns"
are ineluded in the source material, the rejection ofthe credit channel hypothesis for the core
ofthe manufacturing sector ultimately seems to be quite justified owing to the specific insti
tutional regulations in Gennany.

Enterprises' financing structure and their response to monetary policy
stimuli - an analysis based on the Deutsche Bundesbank's corporate
balance sheet statistics*
1. Introduction
Up to about the middle of the eighties the model of frictionless or perfect financial markets
prevailed in macroeconomics. The financial system only had the character ofa "veil". Both
the traditional textbook ISILM analysis and real business cyc1e models set out from this
assumption. For over ten years now an extensive literature based on the market error of
asymmetrie information flows between lender and borrower1 has been emerging which
shows that the financial sphere certainly can influence real economic developments. The
monetary policy transmission mechanism is also affected by this. Besides the usual interest
rate channel, the so-called credit channel has a bearing. Interest-rate-related responses of
economic agents are intensified by information-related restrietions of the credit supply.
This mainly affects small enterprises whose creditworthiness is, as a role, worse than that
of large firms and which are particularly reliant on bank loans. A restrictive monetary
policy stance then results not only in higher interest rates on securities but also in relatively
higher costs of borrowed funds or even in credit rationing for small enterprises owing to
moral hazard and adverse selection. The consequence is - according to the credit channel
literature - that this group offirms has to cut its asset formation particularly sharply. Hence,
monetary policy has a different effect on enterprises depending on their size. There were
similar approaches during the fifties, but it was only in the context ofthe discussion on the
credit channel that these ideas were given an extensive microeconomic foundation through
the integration ofinformation economics in the transmission mechanism.
The discussion on the credit channel is currently still in fuH swing and unlikely to be
conc1uded for a long time.2 This applies, in particular, to the studies which seek to verify

suggestions and comments.
1 This market error can be characterised as folIows: "In financial markets, infonnational asymmetries are
particularly pronounced. Borrowers typically know therr collateral, industriousness, and moral rectitude better
than do lenders; entrepreneurs possess 'inside' infonnation about therr own projects for which they seek
fmancing." (LelandIPyle, 1977, p. 371).

Monetary Policy" (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, 1995) and from the Journal of Economic Perspectives
(9, 1995).

the theoretical approach empirically and to ascertain its macroeconomic significance. So
far a great number of US studies have found indications suggesting the existence of the
credit channel; however, on closer examination, their validity is not completely convincing.
The difficulty is, in particular, that an identification problem has to be solved. The credit
channel argument is based on supply-side responses in respect of bank loans, whereas in
the traditional approach the trend in bank loans is determined by demand. By contrast, the
only observable factor is the "equilibrium" credit volume, in which supply and effective
demand are identical.
For Germany there have only been a few studies to date which deal with the dependence of
enterprises' behavioural responses on the financing structure; this applies above all to the
linkage ofthis phenomenon to the monetary policy context. The verification or negation of
this link is the subject of the present study. The Bundesbank's cOIporate balance sheet
statistics serve as a database. These statistics are superior to other available databases both
in terms ofquality and volume. A particular advantage is the fact that these statistics cover
not only large public limited companies - as is mostly the case in the literature - but also
relatively small firms, which dominate the German corporate landscape and which are most
likely to be affected by the existence of a credit channel, according to theoretical
perceptions. Owing to the limitation to group data and to periods of a restrictive monetary
policy stance, a simple descriptive-statistical approach was chosen for the empirical
evaluation. Based as it is on the corporate balance sheet statistics, this study is to be seen as
a first contribution to the credit channel discussion for Germany.
The study begins with abrief overview of the credit channel approach. First of all, the
traditional textbook transmission channel is outlined so as to be able to elaborate the
characteristics ofthe credit channel more clearly in section 3. Apart ftom the description of
the theory, particular importance has been attached to the numerous empirical approaches
which have so far been developed to solve the identification problem (section 4). Section 5
provides an empirical analysis on the basis of the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet
statistics. Following a detailed description of the data and methodology used, the periods
1978-82 and 1988-93 are examined to see whether the existence of the credit channel can
be demonstrated for Germany. The final section critically discusses the results and
considers possible approaches for further research in this field.

2. Conventional transmission mechanism
The traditional transmission mechanism known from macroeconomic textbooks, which is
also known as the interest rate channel or money view channel,3 can be briefly described as
follows: a reduction in the money stock, regarded as an exogenous variable, results in an
increase in the interest rate which leads to a reduction in asset formation by virtue of the
optimum condition that the interest rate equals the marginal productivity of capital. In line
with this, interest-rate-related consumption declines as weIl. In the 1SILM diagram, this
leads to a shift ofthe LM curve to the left - from LM( to LM
2 - given a movement along
the IS\ curve (see figure 1; for the 1S
2
curve, see section 3.3). At least in the short term,
without further price adjustments, monetary policy has a real impact since overall output
declines from Y( to Y
2 ¬∑ In these models there are only two financial assets, namely money
and securities, with all other possible assets being regarded as perfect substitutes for
securities. A further key characteristic is the assumption of aperfeet capital market. This
means, firstly, that the financial strueture of enterprises has no significance for real
decisions (Modigliani/Miller, 1958) and, secondly, that banks play only a passive roIe in
economie activity (Fama, 1980). These properti~s are uItimately reflected in the idea that
the supply of financial resources is completely elastie vis-a-vis the prevailing interest rate.
Overall, the financial sphere has the eharacter ofa "veil".

3. Credit chaooel approach
In the mid-eighties several US economists attempted to supplement the traditional
monetary transmission channel by a microeconomically founded approach. This was
triggered, in particular, by the observation that fixed asset formation and stockbuilding
frequently responded strongly to restrictive monetary policy measures, although the central
bank's interest rate changes tended to be small. A suitable basis for the explanation was a
research theory which, since Jaffee/Russell (1976) and StiglitzIWeiss (1981), had dealt
with information problems in the financial markets. As a result, on the basis of asymmetric
information between lender and bolTOwer, both the existence of banks and the financing
structure ofeconomic agents were accorded significance for the real sphere; this means that
the paradigm of the "veiI" of the financial system and of the perfect capital market was
abandoned.4 A key feature of the credit channel argument is that bank loans play an
important role. They can no longer be regarded as a perfect substitute for securities but
instead have to be integrated into the transmission process as an autonomous assel.
Monetary policy measures no longer affect only the interest rates for securities but also the
credit supply, Le. the interest rate charged on bank loans.s In this way a restrictive
monetary policy stance may have a relatively great impact on asset formation, even though
central bank interest rates rise only slightly. The basic features of the approach described
here were already discussed in the fifties under the heading "availability doctrine", but the
approach now has a much firmer microeconomic foundation since the "supply problems"
are no longer specified exogenously.6 In terms of its intention, the credit channel theory is
ascribable to new Keynesian macroeconomics, which seeks, in contrast to new classical
macroeconomics and the real business cycle theory, to substantiate disequilibria or cyclical
fluctuations, i.e. traditional Keynesian positions, by taking account of market faHures, such
as external effects, imperfect competition and asymmetric information.7 The literature on
the credit channel meanwhile distinguishes two variants - the balance sheet channel and the
bank lending channel - which are based on different mechanisms but ultimately have
4 Tbe fundamental importance of the financial sphere has been repeatedly discussed since the fifties without
ultimately predominating over the irrelevance hypothesis. Examples are Gurley/Shaw (1955, 1960), Minsky
(1975) and Kindleberger (1978). A detailed overview ofthe "older" literature is given by Gertler (1988).
~ As Gertler/Gilchrist (1993, pp. 45-50) strongly emphasise. the credit channel is based on corresponding
interest rate movements, with the result that the market is cleared, andIor on slow interest rate adjustments
coupled with cremt rationing.

similar effects. Before dealing with the economic policy implications, the two channels
will initially be explained in greater detail.
3.1. Balance sheet channel
For the balance sheet channel, which is also called the "broad credit channel" or "financial
accelerator" in the literature, the influence ofmonetary policy on the goodwill or net wealth
of the firm is paramount.8 The theory postulates that a restrictive monetary policy reduces
the (net) wealth or creditworthiness of the enterprise and thus its access to bank loans 
either through credit rationing or a corresponding increase in lending rates. As a result,
asset formation falls below the interest rate channel. The balance sheet channel primarily
affects small enterprises because their financial position or creditworthiness is less
favourable than that of large firms and because a further deterioration is likely to lead to
financing bottlenecks. In the literature several possibilities are discussed to establish how
monetary policy may affect the "net wealth" of a firm (see Mishkin, 1995). Probably the
oldest variant can be ascribed to Fisher (1933) and describes an unexpected decline in the
price level as a result ofa restrictive monetary policy. The consequence is a rise in real debt
or a fall in net wealth. Besides this, an increase in interest rates is frequently associated
with a decrease in share prices, which likewise indicates a decline in net wealth. If
goodwill is regarded as the present value of a11 future income surpluses, a higher interest
rate (or discounting factor) reduces the net wealth and therefore the creditworthiness of the
enterprise. A reduction in net wealth results in an increase of moral hazard and adverse
selection. In order to absorb the associated risks, the lenders will have to intensify their
credit assessment and monitoring activities, which is compensated for by an add-on to
interest rates in the form of a premium.9 Figure 2 shows this for the microeconomic case.

on the corporate sector (Bernanke/Gertler, 1995, pp. 44-45). 

9 In the case of credit rationing the interest rate does not respond at all or responds only marginally and, 

instead, the adjustment is made via the credit supply. Since the losses to be expected exceed the interest yield, 

the interest rate is not raised correspondingly, despite positive excess demand.

a fonnal exemplification ofthe balance sheet channel theory.

3.2. Bank lending channel
The bank lending channel is based on the assumption that small finns are largely reliant on
bank loans, whereas large enterprises may obtain financial resources through several
channels. Owing to asymmetric infonnation, small enterprises, in particular, are unable to
tap additional sources of finance through the issue of shares or securities. A restrictive
monetary policy stance causes banks to cut down the imperfect substitutes loans and
securities in the wake of a reduction in their deposit base. Since no alternative outside
funds are available, the credit supply decreases and the cost of credit rises more sharply
than the securities rate. The bank lending channel, too, can be illustrated by means of
figure 2. SI is the credit supply curve given asymmetric infonnation, the COInmon basis of
the bank lending and balance sheet channels. Owing to the unequal state of infonnation,
external financing is more expensive than internal financing. The perfect capital market is
characterised by SVK as a benchmark. An increase in securities rates from rl
to r2 as a
result of a tighter monetary policy leads not only to a parallel shift of SI but to a spiralling
as a result ofthe scarcer credit supply mentioned. The relevant supply curve is described by
S2; the amount of asset fonnation is 12 at the prevailing equiIibrium lending rate. In spite
ofdifferent mechanisms, the bank lending channel and the balance sheet channel ultimately
arrive at the same result. The bank lending channel is strongly disputed in the literature,
however.12 In particular, it is questioned whether, in the wake of financial innovations, the
credit supply really can be rigorously restricted. For banks - and this is the prevailing
argumentation in the United States - may increasingly decouple themselves from monetary
policy by obtaining funds, for example, through certificates of deposit not subject to
minimum reserve requirements so as tocbe able to continue to meet enterprises' requests for
credit. To this extent, recent developments in the financial market sphere are likely to have
at least resulted in a weakening of the bank lending channel theory. "In summary, because
of financial deregulation and innovation, the importance of the traditional bank lending
channel has most likely diminished over time" (Bernanke/Gertler, 1995, p. 42). Compared
with the bank lending channel theory, which appears to be very "mechanistic", the balance
sheet channel argument seems to be more convincing. In more recent articles, the bank
lending channel - though in a slightly modified fonn - is treated as a special case of the
balance sheet channel (see section 4.1). The creditworthiness of small banks (like that of
small enterprises) declines more sharply in the case of a restrictive monetary policy than

-7
that of large banks which, in turn, has an adverse impact on both the procurement of funds
and lending.
3.3. The credit channel and its economic poUcy significance
An interesting aspect of the credit channel is that monetary policy no longer has a
symmetric effect on economic agents but, for information-related reasons, a selective one;
as a rule, small enterprises are likely to be affected more strongly by restrictions in the
credit supply than large ones.13 Monetary policy may then even have regional effects
owing to varying geographicallocations of finns (see CarlinolDeFina, 1996). As a result of
the asymmetric effects on the cOIporate landscape. interest rate subsidies and other
government assistance for cOIporate loans. such as warranties and garantees, may be
understood as measures which - contrary to the usual opinion - do not necessarily "weak:en"
monetary policy on account of the lower cost of finance but instead may smoothen the
selective effect ofrestrictive monetary policy stimuli (see Bernanke/Gertler. 1990, pp. 104
109).
Compared with the interest rate channel, the credit channel implies a stronger effect of
monetary policy on real economic variables as a result of the additional restriction in the
form of bank lending. In the ISILM model this is reflected in the fact that a restrictive
monetary policy not only results in a shift in the LM curve - as usual - but also in the IS
curve since, in keeping with the microeconomic analysis, asset formation additionally
depends on the lending rate or the availability of credit.14 Hence, output declines more
sharply over the short tenn than in the model with the perfect capital market. In figure 1
this is reflected by a shift in the IS curve from ISI to IS2
and in a fall in output from Y2 to
Y
3 ¬∑ It is to be noted that such a reaction may also be evoked by other occurrences which
have an adverse effect on bank lending, such as bank runs. To this extent, credit problems
triggered by any kind of shocks - fundamentally contribute to explaining cyclical
fluctuations; monetary policy is ultimately only one possible variant for producing supply
restrictions.ls Conversely, the credit channel at the same time provides a new interpretation
13 This selective effect ofmonetary policy on sma11 and large enterprises was discussed by Galbraith (1957),
Meltzer (1960). BachIHuizenga (1961). SiberlPolakoff(1970) and Ou (1979).
14 Compare BernankeIBlinder (1988) and GreenwaldlStigiitz (1990). For a comprehensive attempt at
integrating imperfect financial markets in macroeconomic models. see Schlick (1994).
15 "At all events, taking account of imperfect information ... offers a promising new possibility of designing 

explanations for the links between monetary and rea1 variables. Information problems are no doubt more than 

only insignificant disturbing factors in rea1ising Walrasian equilibria." (Clemenz, 1987, p. 247). Tighter credit 

.restrictions owing 10 asymmetrie information also serve to explain financial crises such as the Great 

-8 

of the Keynesian liquidity trap. Expansionary monetary policy measures do not lead to an
increase in output if other factors effectively impede lending and the banks frustrate
monetary policy through sluggish interest rate adjustments (see Gischer, 1988, p. 136).
The question of what responsibility monetary policy is assigned for business activity is
ultimately at the centre ofthe economic policy implications of the credit channel approach.
On the one hand, the ability to influence the economic situation tends to become greater as
a result of the additional supply effect. This may lead to the call to handle a restrictive
policy more cautiously so as to moderate the downswing. Conversely, the opportunities of
stimulating business activity improve.16 On the other hand, the transmission channel
becomes more complicated and less calcu1able owing to the interaction of information
asymmetries and institutional conditions, with the resu1t that it may seem expedient to
refrain from fine-tuning measures. To this extent, the credit channe1 also provides a
substantiation for a steadying monetary po1icy (see Neuberger, 1994, p. 31; Neumann,
1995, p. 141).17

lHubbard, 1995, p. 63).
6 Even in the credit channel literature itself, however, there is disagreement about whether the credit
channel may generate additional positive effects in aperiod of expansionary monetary stimuli (see
OlinerlRudebusch, 1996a, pp. 4, 9-10).
17 On the basis of a Keynes-oriented approach, a rejection of active anti-inflation policies can thus be
derived. Illing (1992, pp. 195-198) speaks in this context of a theoretical foundation of regulatory policy by
new Keynesian macroeconomics.

4. Empirieal foundation of the eredit ehannel
4.1. Approaches to solving the identiftcation problem
On account ofthe phenomenon ofinfonnation asymmetries, the extension ofthe traditional
transmission mechanism to include the credit channel appears to be meaningful. However,
the theoretical framework needs to be supplemented by an empirical foundation: firstly, in
order to substantiate the credit channel hypothesis and, secondly, to be able to assess the
macroeconomic significance of this new variant. Most ofthe studies which are to be found
in the literature deal with the extent to which the credit c~el can be verified empirically.
The central problem is to identify whether the movement of credit can be explained by the
demand side or by the supply side. The fact that there are now a great number of
approaches using the most varied methods and data sources shows how difficult it is to
tackle this identification problem. Owing to the lack of knowledge about supply-side credit
restrietions gained through surveys, recourse must be bad to indirect investigations based
on evaluating statistics. In the first place, banking and corporate statistics are used; some
studies also seek to obtain information on the credit channel on the basis of interest rate
data. The following sections give abrief overview of the individual variants using
exclusively US literature. Attempts have also been made to demonstrate the existence of
the credit channel empirically for some other countries.18 Studies on the credit channel in
Germany are then discussed in the subsequent section.
An example frequently cited to demonstrate the existence of the credit channel is the study
by BemankeIBlinder (1992). Using a VAR approach, they examined the behaviour of bank
aggregates and overall economic variables in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy.
They showed that in the United States bank loans declined perceptibly with a time lag of
approximately three quarters. At the same time, a rise in unemployment was found. As
deposits and securities holdings started to rise again - after a decrease in the first nine
months, they interpreted these observations as evidence of the operation of the credit
channel. "The fact that the timing ofthe responses of loans and unemployment to monetary
policy innovations are so similar is circumstantial evidence that this channel is operative
..." (BernankeIBlinder, 1992, p. 920).
18 For example, for Canada: Bank of Canada (1995), for tbe United Kingdom: DalelHaldane (1993), for
ltaly: ButtiglionelFerri (1994), for Japan: Hoshil KashyaplScharfstein (1991).

The conclusion by BernankelBlinder has met with severe criticism in the literature,
however.19 After all, the response of bank loans might just as weIl have been triggered by
the traditional interest rate channel. Rising interest rates imply lower asset fonnation and
thus lower demand for credit - albeit with a certain time lag. In order to be able to
distinguish between supply-side and demand-side reactions, a number of studies consider
other fonns of credit in addition to bank loans - as a measure of the effective demand for
funds. If there are disturbances on the supply side, bank loans are likely to decrease relative
to other borrowed funds.20 On the other hand, the fact that all fonns of credit decrease in
the wake ofa restrictive monetary policy, Le. that their proportions remain constant, argues
for the existence of the interest rate channeL This idea was taken up by
Kashyap/SteinIWilcox (1993) who monitored the movement of commercial paper in
addition to that of bank loans. They showed that a restrictive monetary policy is associated
with a decline in bank loans and a concurrent increase in commercial paper. This suggests
that the corporate sector has a demand for credit which is not satisfied by the banks on
account of supply restrictions.
One objection to the studies outlined so far is that they are based on aggregated data.
Kashyap/SteinIWilcox (1996) extended their study of 1993 by means of a disaggregated
analysis at the corporate level so as to be able to make more differentiated statements.21
For small finns the ratio of bank loans to trade credits declined, whereas trade receivables
increased in the case of large finns. The increase in commercial paper that was
simultaneously observed ultimately served to finance the loans to small finns. The credit
restrictions imposed by the banks were at least partly offset by means of credit operations
between enterprises. In addition, Kashyap/Stein (1995) conducted similar investigations for
small and large banks. The reason for this is that large banks, in particular, do not
necessarily have to respond to a restriciive monetary policy by lowering their credit supply
as they have alternative options and the net wealth of small banks decreases more sharply
than that of large banks - as in the balance sheet channel scenario (see section 3.2). The
authors confinn these hypotheses and show that the lending behaviour of banks differs
according to their size.
19 Even the co-author Bernanke has meanwhile dissociated himself from the "circumstantial evidence" (see
Bemanke/Gertler, 1995, p. 44).
20 In most theoretical credit channel approaches, only bank loans and securitised debt are regardedas
external fmancing. The corporate balance sheets show other forms of credit as weH, however. These are
predominantly intercompany loans such as trade credits. If the supply of bank loans is restricted, finns may
try to resort to such "substitutes". For the information-theoretical preconditions of such responses, see
section 5.2.3 (footnote 49).
21 That study resulted from a criticism ofthe aggregated analysis by OlinerlRudebusch (1995, 1996b).

~-----_.~ 
Most empirical studies on the credit channel use corporate data and examine the extent to
which asset formation and stockbuilding are influenced by "financial variables". The
starting point ofthis research was the study by FazzariJHubbardIPetersen (1988) who tested
the significance ofthe cash flow for asset formation for various groups ofenterprises using
panel data (combined cross-sectional and longitudinal-sectional data). Subsequently, a
great number ofsimilar studies were carried out.22 They ultimately came to the conclusion
that the elasticity of the liquidity parameter is distinctly higher and more significant for
small enterprises than for large firms. Besides the estimation ofan explicit asset fonnation
function, there are also some studies, for example HubbardlKashyap (1992) and Whited
(1992), which use the Euler equation to test whether investment behaviour depends on
financial restrictions. This was triggered by a dispute about the extent to which the
significance of liquidity variables actually reflects financing constraints. This can be
avoided by testing the first-order condition derived from the "dynamic" optimisation
calculatioIl, i.e. the Euler equation. The advantage of this method is that no complete asset
fonnation functions have to be specified.23
Besides this core ofcorporate studies, further approaches are found in the literature which
demonstrate the relevance of the financing structure and, moreover, establish a direct link
with monetary policy measures. Gertler/Gilchrist (1994), for example, investigated
stockbuilding via a simple descriptive-statistical means, using a VAR model and finally by
estimating a function for stockbuilding.24 As a result ofall three approaches it is found that
the stocks of small enterprises decrease considerably more shaIply than those of large
enterprises in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy. The different reaction of bank
loans is identified as a cause. Parallel to the deterioration in the financial position, the trend
in bank loans is much more restrained for smaII firms than for large ones. This result is
interpreted as indicating that smaIl enterprises are hit harder than large ones by a tightening
of the monetary policy stance through credit supply restrictions and that therefore their
stock levels respond more strongly as weH.
As an alternative to the studies of the movements of different fonns of credit, one may
attempt to test for the credit channel by means ofthe trend in the cost ofcredit. In the case
of credit supply restrictions, it is likely as a rule that lending rates will rise more sharply
22 Other stodies, for example Sharpe (1994), examined the dependence ofthe level of employment on finns' 

financing structure. 

23 For a comprehensive comparison of the two approaches, see Cbirinko (1993). For a critical discussion,

than market mtes25 or even respond more slowly as a result ofcredit rationing. The idea is
simple, but its empirical implementation is difficult. Statistics on bank lending rates are
relatively poor and, in addition, other tenns are stipulated in loan agreements besides
interest rates, such as the amount of collateral and the possibilities of influencing business
activity. "The problem is that the true 'price' of a bank loan is multidimensional, involving
not only the contractual interest rate but a variety of other tenns and conditions ..."
(Bemanke, 1993, p. 58). Hence, interest rates may move in line with market mtes, whereas
other variables, which can hardly be monitored, are adjusted. This may mean that the "true"
interest mte rises much more sharply. Various reasons are mentioned in the literature to
explain why lending mtes may actually respond more slowly than the market rate.26 For
example, in periods of a restrictive monetary policy banks mise their interest mtes less than
expected in order not to increase the insolvency risk of their customers; in expansionary
periods, by contrast, the scope for cutting rates is not fully utilised by way ofcompensation.
In their multi-country study CottarellilKourelis (1994) showed that the fluctuation of
interest rates depends on a great number of institutional factors and is not always
attributable to the market failure of infonnation asymmetries. Owing to the difficulties
described, most other authors express the opinion that hardly any conclusions on the credit
channel can be derived from published interest rate data (see Davis, 1995, p. 58).
Even if a number of studies suggest that the credit channel exists, this says Httle about its
macroeconomic significance. Even for the United States there have been few investigations
into this question and, moreover, they arrive at divergent results. McCallum (1991) found
for the period 1950-85 that about half of the change in gross domestic product (GDP)
caused by the restrictive monetary policy was attributable to credit rationing. By contrast,
the relevance of the financial sphere for macroeconomic variables was considered to be
rather small by BergerlUdell (1992) and Fuerst (1995). The fonner used microdata, namely
just over 1 million credit agreements, for assessing credit rationing. They showed that,
while there are supply restrictions on the part of the lenders, one cannot speak of a
macroeconomically significant phenomenon. Finally, Fuerst integrated money market and
financial market imperfections into a real business cyc1e model. However, theresulting
fluctuations hardly differed from the results obtained with perfect markets.
Even if a number of studies show positive results for the existence ofthe credit channel for
the United States, it would be premature to simply transfer such studies to other countries.
It is precisely the institutional differences, such as the relationship between banks and

enterprises, which may weil influence the "operation" ofthe credit channel. An infonnative
example of the relevance of national peculiarities IS the study by
Hoshi/Kashyap/Scharfstein (1991) for Japan. Finns which are organised in industrial
associations ("Keiretsu") traditionally have very close relationships with their house bank.
It is found that such enterprises are less affected by credit restrictions than enterprises
outside the "Keiretsu".
4.2. Credit channel in Germany?
In contrast to the United States, there are only a few studies for Gennany which investigate
the relevance of the financing structure of enterprises and credit supply restrictions by
banks. Both FrisseIFunkelLankes (1993) and Winker (1996) stated that financial variables
play an important role for corporate asset fonnation. Whereas the fonner used data oflisted
public limited companies from the industrial and¬∑distribution sectors and carried out a
panel study similar to FazzarilHubbardIPetersen (1988),27 a large number of approaches
are found in Winker. What is interesting is the attempt to demonstrate credit rationing
directly, i.e. by means of survey data on obstacles 10 innovation from the ifo innovation,
investment and business surveys. It is difficult to assess, however, how reliable enterprises'
answers concerning restrictions by banks are. In addition to the microeconomic
confinnation of credit rationing, Winker tries to assess also the macroeconomic effects of
this phenomenon. For this purpose, the aggregated credit supply and credit demand
functions were estimated in a first step and it was shown that a positive excess demand of
roughly 10 % of the credit volume existed in 1985. This bad similar effects on
macroeconomic asset fonnation. As a result of credit not granted, asset fonnation was
about one-tenth lower than it would have been in the absence of rationing. It is to be
critically notOO that a positive excess demand was found for 1985 but not for 1981.
According to Winker, the market cleared in 1981, despite very high central bank interest
rates and the recession. Theoretical considerations would suggest the emergence of credit
supply problems, particularly during such a phase.
Attempts were made to produce further evidence for the relevance ofthe financial sphere in
Germany by evaluating the Bonn sampie, which is basOO on the annual accounts of public
limitOO companies from the industrial sector. EIs10nlAlbach (1994) discussOO the
investment behaviour of firms which are designated as "bank-dependent" since banks were
also shareholders in them. The so-called independent enterprises were then comparOO with
this control group. For the period 1983-92 the authors demonstrated that liquidity variables
influenced the investment behaviour of independent firms, whereas enterprises with elose

ties to their banks showed no financing restrictions. These results indicate that the structure
of the Gennan banking system is an aspect that should not be neglected. This was already
pointed out by Cable (1985, pp. 129-130) in an earlier study for Gennany: "Empirical
estimates show that ... there is a significant, positive relationship between the degree of
bank involvement in leading industrial companies and their financial perfonnance." In a
further study AudretschlElston (1994) classified enterprises by size categories (small,
medium-sized, large). However, the results can hardly be used as evidence for the common
hypothesis that small finns are most affected by credit rationing, for in the estimation
period 1977-85 the liquidity parameter was highly significant and showed the highest
value, particularly for the large public limited companies.
Neuberger (1994) tried, on the basis of credit and interest rate data, to analyse supply-side
credit disturbances. She investigated the extent to which the trend in lending or lending
rates can be explained by corporate insolvencies. Ultimately, no indication of a credit
disturbance on the supply side, i.e. by banks, was found.
The studies quoted so far exarnined the significance ofthe financing structure from various
angles. However, none of the studies locates this aspect directly in the monetary policy
context, as is the case with foreign studies. An exception is the investigation by Tsatsaronis
(1995) who tested the existence of the credit channel in periods of a restrictive monetary
policy for the United States, the United Kingdom, Japan and Gennany. By means of
aggregated data and using different statistical methods, he concluded from the reactions of
output, the money stock and the credit volume that there are hardly any indications of the
existence of the credit channel for Gennany. "... monetary policy in Gennany seems to
work mainly through the conventional 'money' channeI." (Tsatsaronis, 1995, p. 167).
Owing to the different findings in the individual studies, the operation of a credit channel
for Gennany, in addition to the traditional interest rate channel, cannot be established
unambiguously. Particularly studies based on corporate data show no direct link with
monetary policy measures and can therefore give only initial indications of the
phenomenen in question. In addition, owing to their limitation to listed public lirnited
companies, the databases are not a representative yardstick for Gennany. By contrast, as
described at the beginning of the paper, the Deutsche Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet
statistics offer the advantage that they include small and medium-sized finns as wen as
unincorporated enterprises. For according to the theoretical predictions, the credit channel
is likely to affect precisely these finns. In the course of the present study the corporate
balance sheet statistics will be evaluated with respect to this question for periods of
restricted monetary stimuli. First, however, the methodology and the database are
described.

5. Credit ehannel in the Bgbt oftbe eorporate balance sbeet statisties
5.1. Database and methodology
The Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics are based on the annual accounts
submitted in the context of rediscount business. The annual accounts are the basis of the
statutorily prescribed examination of the creditworthiness of parties to bills of exchange.
According to section 19 of the Bundesbank Ac!, the Bundesbank is required to purchase
only bills ubacked by parties known to be solventu. As a result, comprehensive source
material in the form of profit and loss accounts and balance sheets is available only for
economic sectors in which the trade bill is an important financing instrument. These sectors
primarily include the manufacturing and construction sectors as weH as the wholesale and
retail trade. In the present study only the data for the manufacturing sector are used,
however, since the database for this sector is the most comprehensive in the context of the
Bundesbank statistics an~ at the same time, statements can be made on the most
significant and cyclically susceptible economic sector in Germany.18
Since the literature on the credit channel deals primarily with restrictive monetary policy
periods, this study is likewise confined to such periods. Accordingly, two cylindered
sampies for the years 1978-82 and 1988-93 were fonned from the source material available
to the Bundesbank; this means that the firms included in each sampie submitted annual
accounts to the Bundesbank for every year of the review period. In the first period the
sampie comprises 13,163 enterprises and in the second 10,027 firms. The two periods were
chosen because clear monetary policy phases or monetary stimuli can be identified.19 This
assessment was based on the trend in central bank interest rates and on the statements made
in the Bundesbank's Annual Reports on the orientation of monetary policy. This procedure
foHows the narrative approach of RomerlRomer (1989) and the approach taken by
BernankeIBlinder (1992) which used the Federal funds rate as a yardstick for monetary
policy for the United States. Even if particularly the RomerlRomer approach to
determining the stance of monetary policy has numerous shortcomings, such as a certain
inaccuracy in assessing the start ofmonetary stimuli, both procedures are frequently used in
18 In 1988. wbich is to serve as a reference year for the comparison of the Bundesbank sample with the
overall survey (see footnote 37). for example. two--fifths oftotal turnover. one-third of gross value added and
aImost one-third ofall persons employed in Germany were accounted for by the manufacturing sector. (In the
present study reference is made only to the data for western Germany.)
29 According to Duwendag et al. (1993, p.228), monetary stimuli are defined as changes in monetary
variables, such as the money stock and various types of interest rates.

the literature.30 Moreover, it is not important in this context to split monetary policy phases
precisely into very short intervals (months or quarters) because only annual data are
available from the corporate balance sheet statistics.31
Apart from the lowering of the lombard rate in autumn 1980, a restrictive monetary policy
stance was pursued in the periods 1979-81 and 1989-92, judging by the interest rate curves
and the statements in the Annual Reports (see figure 3).32 Throughout 1982 and 1993
central bank: interest rates declined; this means that there was a renewed reversal in
monetary policy. Nevertheless, both years are included in the analysis because, owing to
certain lag structures, the effects of the credit channel on real variables may still be found
relatively late.33 In 1978 central bank: interest rates remained unchanged overall; in
addition, a certain nonnalisation of economic activity was recorded. For that reason, that
year will be used as a reference point for the discussion of certain finn-specific stylised
facts. The year 1988 is to be interpreted in a similar way even though central bank: interest
rates were raised in the second halfofthe year owing to emerging inflationary risks. Owing
to the time lags already mentioned, the influences on the finns' annual data are hardly
noticeable, with the result that the real period under review does not start until 1989.
30 For an overview ofthe various approaches to classifying monetary policy, see BernankelMihov (1995). 

31 In the United States, by contrast, quarterly corporate balance sheets are available. 

32 An analogous delimitation for Germany is obtained if the difference between long and short-term interest 

rates is taken as a basis.

The corporate data available on the manufacturing sector are broken down by size category
and legal form. These are group data and not microdata, i.e. there is only an average figure
for each size category and balance sheet item.34 The size (which - according to the credit
channel theory - is decisive for the creditworthiness and the bank dependence of the
enterprises) is c1assified by turnover.35 Such adefinition is not unproblematical, however,
since there are overlaps with other corporate features which may distort the results. But
such overlaps cannot be avoided either in other c1assification characteristics used in the
literature, such as the age of the firm, access to the capital market, or the amount of
dividend distributions.36 Owing to the different accounting regulations and the liability of
the private assets of sole proprietors and partnerships (which relativises the exc1usive use
of the level of the own funds ratio as a gauge of!iable assets), a distinction is also made by
legal form. In this context, it has to be borne in mind that, in terms of numbers, firms of
dependent legal status dominate the corporate landscape in Germany and also predominate
in the Bundesbank sampie; these firms may behave differently from incorporated
enterprises. Hitherto, studies ofGermany, and sometimes ofother countries, have had to be
confined to the large incorporated enterprises because data for other firms were not
available.
T0 assess the degree of representativeness of the data, it was necessary to compare the
Bundesbank sampie with statistics which reflect the universe. The Bundesbank database
for 198837 comprises 3 % of the enterprises shown in the turnover tax statistics for the
manufacturing sector; however, almost half of the tumover was accounted for by the firms
in the Bundesbank sampie. This suggests that 1arge enterprises predominate. It has to be
borne in mind, however, that the turnover tax statistics inc1ude numerous entities which are
enterprises not obliged to draw up'a balance sheet. The units covered by the corporate
balance sheet statistics account for just over one-fifth of industrial firm loans recorded in
the banking statistics. The ratio of short-term to long-term bank loans is 72 %, compared
with 67 % in the banking statistics. Considerable differences are found in the size category
34 Hence, it is implicitly assumed that a11 enterprises behave like the average within a given group. 

35 A distinction is made between the size categories "small" (turnover of up to DM 5 million), "medium

sized" (tumover of DM 5 to 50 million) and "Iarge" (tumover of over DM 50 million). Altematively, some 

authors use the balance sheet total as a criterion. 

36 For an overview of the various classification characteristics, see Bernankel Gertler/Gilchrist (1994). 

Possible errors ofexogenously specified characteristics are reduced if discriminant variables from the original 

data are ascertained endogenously with the aid ofcluster and discriminant analyses. 

37 Solely the year 1988 was used as a reference since the tumover tax statistics for 1978 are not directly 

comparable because of the modification of the industrial classification system in 1980. The two cylindered 

sampies ofthe Bundesbank sample were formed according to the classification valid as from 1980, 

-19
structure. According to the tumover tax statistics, just over 90 % of the tax payers have a
tumover of less than DM 5 million; they have a share of just over 10 % in the
manufacturing sector's total tumover. According to the Bundesbank data, only one-fifth of
the enterprises. accounting for less than I % ofthe tumover. come into this category. In the
Bundesbank sampIe the large firms with a tumover of over DM 50 million account for
23 % of the enterprises and almost 87 % of the tumover, while in the universe of the
tumover tax statistics just over I % of the firms of this size generate 71 % of the tumover.
Broken down by legal form, enterprises of dependent legal status come to 83 % and
generate just over one-third of the tumover, according to the official statistics; in the
Bundesbank's data these make up nearly 50 % of the firms and account for 23 % of the
tumover. These brief statements show that the sampie used here, as measured by the
turnover tax statistics and the banking statistics, is of considerable size and reflects the
range of enterprises better than comparable databases but that it also has a certain bias in
favour of larger firms. The extent to which the findings for the credit channel are
influenced by this will be discussed in the last part of this study.
As section 4 shows, there are in principle three methodological approaches to evaluating
corporate data for information on the credit channel. The VAR approach or other
time-series-based methods cannot be applied to the Bundesbank data since the number of
observations is too small. In the United States this is possible because both relatively long
data series and quarterly data are available. Consequently, the best approach would be to
estimate an asset formation function by means of panel data. If the liquidity constraint is
found to be significant, this is regarded in the literature on the credit channel as proofofits
existence.38 Although this is undisputed in theory, the empirical implementation is
problematic, which is only partly attributable to the general difficulties in the statistical
recording ofinvestment behaviour. In particular, it is not clear what a Iiquidity variable, for
example the cash flow, represents exactly. On the one hand, it represents the internally
generated financial resources and, on the other, it is relatively closely correlated with the
profit situation or tumover. This means that no unambiguous conclusion as to pure
fmancing problems can be drawn from a significant influence of the liquidity variables and
that, from this angle, the great number of studies with corresponding results are to be
interpreted with caution. A way out of this dilemma is the estimation of the Euler
equation - the first-order condition; however, this variant has some disadvantages, too. The
38 In the case ofa perfect capitaJ market. by contrast, there can be no liquidity constraints for a finn since the

-20
results react very sensitively to the model specification and to the size of the sampies;
moreover, the violation of the first-order condition need not necessarily be caused by
financial constraints.39
Owing to the aforementioned "technical" problems and the fact that group data were used,
a simple descriptive-statistical approach has been chosen in the present study along the
lines of Gertler/Gilchrist (1994). An attempt is made to solve the identification problem of
whether bank loans show supply disturbances by considering the reactions ofbank loans in
individual size categories. A below-average trend in the case of small and medium-sized
enterprises (SMEs) vis-a-vis large finns might indicate the existence ofthe credit channel.
This - it is commonly argued - is the cause of the strong decline in fixed asset fonnation
and stockbuilding of SMEs observed in the wake of a restrictive monetary policy. In
addition to bank loans, all other fonns ofcredit shown in the Bundesbank's source material
are investigated, particularly supplier's credit and loans arising from participating interests
(inc1uding proprietors' and partners' loans) to identify the actua1 demand for credit or the
credit channe1.40 Whereas the inc1usion of trade credits as an "auxiliary variable" is quite
widespread in the literature, the explicit analysis of loans between affiliated enterprises or
proprietors' and partners' loans has not yet been documented. The reaction ofbank loans in
relation to other liabilities is likely to be infonnative, too. If their proportion declines, this
argues for the credit channel, according to Kashyap/SteinIWilcox (1993, 1996). Apart from
analysing the trend in credit, the study examined whether the trend in lending rates paid by
enterprises (as far as they can be computed on the basis ofthe balance sheet data) supplies
further infonnation. Appropriate conc1usions could be drawn if the interest level paid by
small finns always developed differently from that paid by large enterprises. To this extent
this study attempts to evaluate the available source material as comprehensively as possible
for the detection ofthe credit channeL
39 The various problems involved in estimating the asset formation function and the Euler equation were 

discussed by FazzarilPetersen (1993) and GiIchristIHimmelberg (1995). 

40 Bernanke (1993, p. 59) explicitly demanded that fonns ofcredit other than bank loans should be included 

in the analysis.

S.2. Behaviour of firms in the period 1978-82
S.2.1. Economic situation
According to the relevant literature, the cred.it channel serves to explain an economic
downswing as a result of a tighter monetary policy. To this extent, it appears to be sensible
to analyse overall economic developments before empiricaIly testing for the credit channel
so as to locate the reactions of the individual relevant firm data within the cyclicaI and
monetary context.41
After the recession had been overcome at the end of 1975, the Gennan economy grew
fairly strongly. In 1978 and 1979 growth amounted to 3 % and just over 4 %, respectively.
In the producing sector output increased by as much as 5 % in 1979. At that time, the
unemployment rate came to roughly 3 1/2 % ofthe labour force. Whereas at the beginning
of the period under review consumer prices moved within an acceptable range, they rose
sharply, at 4 %, in 1979 in the wake of the second oil price wave; in conjunction with a
sharp expansion of the money stock, this led to several increases in the discount and
lombard rates (to 6 % and 7 %, respectively). In 1980 consumer prices went up by 5 ~ %
and the index ofimport prices rose by as much as 15 %. The dramatic increase in the prices
of petroleum and the global economic adjustment processes caused industrial output to
stagnate and real GDP to grow by only about I %. In the first half of 1980 central bank
interest rates reached a level of7 ~ % and 9 Y2 %, respectively. In the two subsequent years
the economic downswing accelerated; in 1982 total and industrial output declined by as
much as I % and just over 3 %, respectively. The unemployment rate reached almost 7 %.
The curbing of inflation, associated with improved externaI conditions, made it possible,
however, to lower centraI bank interest rates throughout the year. In May 1982 the special
lombard rate, which bad amounted to 12 % upon its introduction at the beginning of 1981
and which bad already been lowered from the autumn of 1981, was replaced by the
standard lombard; the latter bad been reduced to 6 % by the end of the year, which
corresponded to the level of mid-1979. In 1983 economic output rose again for the first
time in three years (+ I Y2 %), and price inceases bad moderated noticeably, at 3 Y2 %.
This shows that the overall economic environment in 1978-82 corresponded to the
conditions for the "operation" of the credit channel described in the literature. Before
investigating the credit channel, some firm-specific characteristics that are relevant in
terms ofthe new transmission approach will be anaIysed in greater detail.

In the first year of the period, 1978, it can be noted, on the liability side of the balance
sheets ofincOlporated entetprises (INCs), that the own funds ratios rose distinctly with the
size ofthe finns (see table 1.) This suggests a 10wer creditworthiness of small entetprises,
in particular, which finns in turn - as a mirror image, so to speak - showed by far the
greatest bank dependence; both are aspects on which the credit channel approach is
premised. Whereas their bank loans amounted to 26 % of the balance sheet total, the figure
was only 12 % in the case of finns with a tumover of over DM 50 million. In the case of
SMEs the ratio of long-tenn to short-tenn bank debt amounted to almost 110 %, whereas
large entetprises, at roughly 200 %, were clearly oriented to the longer tenn. Besides bank
loans, trade credits playamajor role. Including the relevant debtors on the asset side, all
size categories of the manufacturing sector considered here were net creditors with regard
-23 

to supplier's credit; this was increasingly the case with rising turnover which, on balance,
indicates the possibility of lending by large farms to small enterprises.42
The database for 1978-82 included just over twice as many SPsIPs as INCs (see table 2).
The latter were much larger, however. They accounted for about three-quarters of total
turnover, tangible fixed assets and stocks. The database was dominated by the large INCs;
8 % of the enterprises generated 70 % of turnover. The smaU SPslPs, which accounted for
one-quarter ofall farms, carried only very Iittle weight economically. They achieved a share
in the turnover of aU enterprises of 1 Y2 %, and their share in bank loans amounted to not
quite 3 %.

The essential difference between INCs and SPsIPs in 1978 is the level ofown funds. In the
case ofSPsIPs the relevant ratio averaged only about 20 %, according to table 1, and hardly
varied between the individual size categories.43 At the same time, their dependence on
banks was much greater; in the case of small firms it came to 32 % of the balance sheet
total, and in the case of large firms to a still considerable 17 Y2 %. Trade credits displayed a
size-dependent pattern, though again all categories were net creditors. Long-term Iiabilities
arising from participating interests, which in some cases exceeded long-term bank loans,
42 According to the corporate balance sheet statistics, the retail trade was a net debtor in respect of supplier's 

credit. This means that the manufacturing sector possibly granted loans to the retail trade. 

43 The own funds ratios of SPslPs are statistically understated, however, since - apart from limited 

partnerships - private assets are also part of the liable assets. 

-24
reached quite a considerable level.44 In view of their ratio of long-term to short-term bank
loans of just over 130 %, the SPs/Ps among the SMEs seemed to have a longer-term
orientation than the small and medium-sized INCs; the opposite seemed to be true for the
large SPs/Ps, at a value of 120 %.
With regard to the credit channel, the stylised facts described above suggest that small
firms tend to be affected to a greater degree by monetary policy. Firstly, their bank
dependence is greater and, secondly, their creditworthiness - at least in the case oflNCs - is
likely to be lower than that of large enterprises. At first sight, this reaffirms the theoretical
assumptions. The following sections will examine whether this hypothesis can in fact be
maintained for the subsequent years when monetary policy makers adopted a tighter stance.
The clear differences in the case of own funds and bank loans seem to justify the separate
treatment by legal forms. In addition, special attention will be paid to the other forms of
credit, some ofwhich reach considerable orders ofmagnitude.
5.2.3. Incorporated enterprises and the credit channel
As mentioned, the credit channel approach is based on the pronounced bank dependence
and the lower creditworthiness of small enterprises compared with large ones. A restrictive
monetary policy may cause a restriction of the credit supply which affects the size
categories to varying degrees and which has a greater impact on small firms, in particular.
The pattern of bank dependence was outlined in the preceding section, but only the own
funds ratio in 1978 provided some information on creditworthiness. Since, however, the
balance sheet channel theory focuses on the influence on goodwill and creditwortbiness
over time, this factor will first be examined on the basis ofvarious ratios. Subsequently the
behaviour of enterprises will be investigated. The study will examine whether size-specific
patterns can be observed in fixed asset formation andlor stockbuilding, as in the United
States. If tbis is confirmed, it will be clarified to what extent "credit problems" can be held
responsible for this.
Enterprises' creditworthiness will be characterised by the usual variables own funds ratio,
profit for the year and cash flow45 as weIl as by the coverage ratio - the ratio of interest
44 Trus is due, inter alia, to the fact that, for liability and tax reasons, withdrawals by limited liability
partners are often made available again to their firms in the form ofloans.
45 In the context of the Deutsche Bundesbank's credit assessments (1992a), the own funds ratio (own
fundslbalance sheet total), the capital recovery rate (cash flow/capital input) and the profit-turnover ratio
(profit for the year/tumover or total output) proved to be the most informative indicators. In the present study
25
paid to the profit for the year (including interest paid). This ratio, which represents nothing
else than an interest coverage ratio,46 is designated in US literature as a variable that is
simple to compute and one by which the financial position of a firm can be adequately
described byapproximation47.
Irrespective of which ratio is used, there is a graduation specific to the size category. In no
group is the trend in the data so unfavourable as in the case offirms with a tumover of less
than DM 5 million (see table 3). This actually resulted in a loss in 1982, although two years
earlier - at the beginning of the recession - the profit-tumover ratio had amounted to just
over 2 %. Generally speaking, in 1980 the tighter course ofmonetary policy since 1979 and
the downswing starting in 1980 had little effect on the corporate balance sheets of INCs;
from 1981 the ratios of SMEs especially were a sustained reflection of economic
developments. By contrast, nearly all indicators improved in the case of firms with a
tumover of over DM 50 million as early as 1982. The creditworthiness of the individual
size categories thus developed as expected. The smaller the enterprises, the worse their
financial position in the period 1979-82.
total output is used as a reference variable for the profit for the year and the cash flow. (Total output includes
the change in stocks ofown products and other intemally produced real assets as weIl as tumover.)
46 The higher the coverage ratio, the worse is the assessment ofthe fum's fmancial position.
47 Gertler/Gilchrist (1994, p. 334) substantiated the use of this variable as follows: "We refrain from using
indicators that measure assets directly because we have infonnation only on book values. However, the
coverage ratio is highly correlated with the other prominent balance sheet indicators. It is thus reasonable to
view variation in the coverage ratio as proxying for movements in fums' overall ftnancial positions."

To show the reactions of firms to a restrictive monetary policy stance, most authors resort
to fixed asset formation and stockbuilding. In contrast to what is claimed for the United
States by Gertler/Gilchrist (1994), for example, the database used here does not provide
any evidence that the stockbuilding of small enterprises declines more sharply than that of
large firms in periods oftighter monetary stimuli. According to table 4, a general decline in
stockbuilding was recorded between 1979 and 1981; in the last year under review here
stocks were actually run down at a rate that was in fact somewhat more pronounced for
medium-sized and large firms than for small enterprises. However, the size-specific
behaviour described in the credit channel literature can be confirmed for tangible fixed
assets (see table 4). Whereas in 1980 the stock of tangible fixed assets was increased fairly
sharply in all size categories, this was only the case in the subsequent years in enterprises
with a turnover of over DM 50 million. Their investment ratio was largely stable over the
years, despite very high interest rates and despite the recession. From 1981 the net asset
formation of SMEs slumped dramatically. The invesment ratios declined by 0.6 percentage
point in each case. The small enterprises in fact reduced their stock of tangible fixed assets
rather sharply in 1982, which was ultimately also clearly reflected in the relevant balance
sheet ratios. While in 1979 the ratio of tangible fixed assets to the balance sheet total had
still amounted to 33 Y2 %, it was barely 31 % three years later. This balance sheet ratio was
much more stable in the case ofmedium-sized and large firms.

Now we must assess to wbat extent the differing investment bebaviour can be explained by
credit restrictions - as evidence for the cred.it cbanneL A comparison of the growth rates in
bank loans shows that up to and including 1980 - Le. two years after the tightening of the
monetary policy stance - loans increased very sharply at double-digit rates regardless of the
size category (see table 5).48 In the two subsequent periods the trend varied fairly sharply.
For the medium-sized enterprises a virtual stagnation can be found, while at firms with a
turnover of over DM 50 million loans initially expanded at + 13 %; in 1982 they declined
perceptibly in absolute terms, which may be due to the fact that internat resources increased
fairly strongly again. The small enterprises displayed a completely different trend. In 1981
bank loans grew even more strongly than in the years before and in 1982, too, a rise (albeit
a smaller one) of5 % was recorded. Since the analysis ofthe growth rates may be distorted
owing to the sharply diverging levels of bank loans, it appears appropriate to include the
relevant ratios to the balance sheet total. In the case of small firms the share of loans
increased by almost 6 percentage points between 1979 and 1982, while it stagnated or rose
only slightly in the case of the other size categories. The trend in bank loans was associated
with an increase in the ratio of short-term to long-term loans throughout. For the SMEs the
ratio reached a value of clearly above 100 %; for the large firms the ratio was nearly
balanced in 1981, although the volume oflong-term loans bad been twice.as large as that of
short-term ones in 1978.
48 These are the growth rates of nominal variables; this means that, depending on the movement of prices,
positive growth rates may signify real declines.

Kashyap/Stein/Wilcox (1996)49 argued that in restrictive monetary policy periods large
enterprises which have no problems in obtaining funds open up financial scope to small
firms through trade credits if the latter face bank credit restrictions. According to the
aforementioned statements, such restrictions are not evident in the Bundesbank database
but supplier's credits may perhaps provide additional information. The trade creditors of
small firms moved differently from those of medium-sized and large firms with the
beginning of the recession in 1980. Whereas the trend in the latter remained positive until
1981 and did not dec1ine in absolute terms until 1982, that ofsmall firms had fallen already
in 1980. The granting of trade credits to small firms appears to be handled relatively
restrictively. On the asset side of the balance sheet trade debtors moved more or less in
para1lel with trade creditors, with the result that, on balance, no additional financing or
lending through trade credit can be found in any size category. To this extent, at least for
the manufacturing sector in Germany, there is nothing to suggest (contrary to the original
assumption) that additional credit channels were opened through supplier's credits between
1979 and 1982.50
In the period under review no size-specific behaviour could be observed for the item other
creditors.51 Since the relevant claims52 showed a slightly rising trend and all categories
49 Similar reactions were found for the United States by Meltzer (1960) and for the United Kingdom by
BrechlinglLipsey (1963). For the different reasons why firms tend to be more willing to lend than banks, see
Jaffee/Stiglitz (1990, pp. 879-880). From the point of view of information economics it is argued that
information structures between firms can weIl be more efficient than between firms and banks.
50 This tallies with a longer-term study ofthe Deutsche Bundesbank (1992b). The result was also confirmed
for preceding periods (Timmermann, 1971).
51 These include other short-term creditors, creditors arising from participating interests and other long-term
creditors.

were net debtors, net liabilities declined in general, and so there was no additional source
of credit. On the liability side the available source material enabled a differentiation of
long-tenn trade creditors by other creditors and loans arising from participating interests.
This subdivision is of significance because it may be assumed that in the case of this fonn
ofcredit asymmetrie information flows will hardly be significant and that this type ofcredit
is granted more willingly than bank funds. In the case of enterprises with a turnover of less
than DM 5 million, creditors arising from participating interests increased slightly, while
they remained relatively constant in the case of the other size categories. This might
suggest that there was an additional source of credit for small INCs.S3 This source was no
larger, however, than the increase in long-term bank loans, which grew much more sharply.
If there were a "supply shortage" of bank credit to small INCs, it might be expected that
particularly the loans between finns would grow at a relatively faster pace.
If, finally, the ratio ofbank loans to all other 16ans is considered, no "takeover effect" could
be found for firms with a turnover of less than DM 5 million in the sense ofother fonns of
credit expanding more sharply than bank loans. The ratio rose steadily in favour of bank
loans from just under 60 % to 74 % (see table 6). In the next size category the growth was
much smaller and in the case of large enterprises the ratio remained largely constant. It can
be concluded from this that the small enterprises can cover their additional financing
requirements resulting from a decrease in own funds by bank loans and that they do not
have to resort to alternative forms of credit. The results found here provide no indications
for a discrimination ofsmall firms in terms ofbank lending; the

than DM 5 million fell in every year. whereas most ratios of the large firms were even
more favourable in 1982 than a year before. On the basis of the ratios available, a clearly
size-dependent trend in the creditworthiness can be confrrmed. As for the INCs, a
noticeable deterioration in the creditworthiness of the SPsIPs can be found only from 1981,
when central bank interest rates peaked and the cyclical downswing was in its second year.
Since stockbuilding displays no size-specific pattern over time, fixed asset formation will
now be analysed in greater detail (see table 8). Here the SMEs and large firms differ

tion. The decline in investment ratlos was particularly pronounced for small finns. By
contrast, enterprises with a tumover of over DM 50 million expanded their capital stock
over the entire period, even though the growth rates decreased. In 1982 this was
perceptible, however, only in the stock variable (which is influenced by valuations) but not
in the investment ratio. The share of tangible fixed assets in the balance sheet total
increased slightly in that year, whereas it dropped considerably in the case ofsmall finns.
As in the case of INCs, bank dependence, creditworthiness and fixed asset fonnation
displayed the size-specific pattern typical of the credit channel. It remains to be examined
to what extent bank lending restrictions can be held responsible for this. Short and long
tenn bank loans, taken together, displayed hardly any size-specific pattern in 1979 and
1980, according to table 9. The picture changed from 1981. There were only one-digit
nominal increases, with the small firms still achieving higher rates than the large ones. In
the entire period 1979-82 the size-dependent trend in credit is reflected very clearly in its
share in the balance sheet total. In the case of finns with a low credit rating which depend
stronglyon bank credit, this share rose by 7 percentage points, compared with 3 percentage
points in the case ofmedium-sized enterprises and barely ~ percentage point in the case of
large finns. The maturities differed perceptibly from those of INCs. The large SPsIPs
expanded their ratio of short-tenn to long-term bank loans markedly to more than 100 %,
whereas the other two size categories still preferred long-term credit, despite a rise in short
tenn loans. In spite of differing financing patterns, the trend in bank loans for finns of
dependent legal status was similar to that of INCs. In both categories there was no
indication that small firms are disadvantaged vis-a-vis large ones in the case oflending. As
in section 5.2.3, the other forms of credit. too, will be considered as a yardstick for the
actual demand for credit.

The "rough" aggregate of other creditors and other debtors showed no pronounced size
specific pattern. As measured by the balance sheet total, creditors declined throughout
while debtors moved in the opposite direction. with the result that, in net terms, creditors
decreased (even slightly more sharply in the case of small enterprises than in the other
categories). Long-term loans from participating interests likewise fell from 1979 to 1982;
hence the growing long-term bank: 10ans and the possibly easier availability of corporate
10ans or proprietors' and partners' loans do not suggest that the supply of the latter is
limited for SMEs.
As in the case of the INes, supplier's credits provide no indication for the SPsIPs that a
possible fmancing need is covered by this form of credit instead of bank loans. The
patterns between the individual size categories differ, however. In the case of small firms
the trade creditors and trade debtors declined already at the start of the economic
downswing in 1980 but on the whole (net) creditors increased sligthly. This is found for
medium-sized firms as weIl, although the asset and liability sides of the balance sheet
declined only from 1982. Since the large SPsIPs even expanded their debtors in 1982, the
balance might provide an indication of some lending to other size categories. but the
additional financing scope was comparatively small compared with the expansion of bank:
loans.
If. finally, bank: 10ans are measured against all other creditors, the results derived from the
above statements are confirmed (see table 10). The other forms of credit were not used by
enterprises as additional sources of finance in lieu of possibly restricted bank: loans.
Instead, the ratio of bank: loans to other loans increased considerably, particularly for
-33
SMEs, whereas it remained nearly constant for the large finns. This seems to indicate that
the SMEs cover their need for external resources predominantly through the banks.

5.2.5 Conclusion
Ifthe trend in bank loans for all enterprises is eonsidered, the decline ofnearly 4 % in 1982
could be interpreted as an indication ofa supply-determined reaction caused by a restrictive
monetary policy and the recession. The disaggregated analysis chosen here shows,
however, that the fall in bank loans was attributable mainly to the large INCs, which played
a dominating role in terms of volume and to which, according to the assymetrical
information theory, the phenomenon of bank lending restrictions should least apply. This
reveals how important the differentiated analysis by size categories and legal forms iso
Although the databases for the INCs and the SPslPs differed in several respects,54 similar
results were obtained for the most important aspects. The creditworthiness and the asset
formation responses displayed parallel size-specific patterns over time. The analysis ofthe
trend in the various credit forms clearly shows that there was no discrimination against
small firms in terms of bank lending - irrespective ofthe legal form. On the one band, the
growth rates were largest for finns with a tumover of less than DM 5 million and, on the
other, the increase in the ratio of bank loans to all other loans was largest in the case of
these firms. Another indication is the trend in long-term bank loans compared with
creditors from participating interests and proprietors' and partners' loans. The extent to
which this is attributable to typical institutional regulations in Germany or to other causes
will be discussed at the end of this paper. First the period 1988-93 will be analysed in
greater detail in line with the procedure adopted for the earlier period.
54 Bearing in mind tbe credit cbannel argument the diverging levels of bank dependence and own funds
should be mentioned. Irrespective of this, tbe differing structure of bank loans (shott-term versus long-term)
does not seem to influence tbe results either.

5.3. Asset formation and loans 1988-93
5.3.1. Overall economic environment
Whereas west Gennan real GDP grew only moderately in the middle of the eighties,
economic momentum increased from 1988. By 1991 output in western Gennany had risen
by an average of 3 ~ %, not least owing to the stimuli imparted by Gennan reunification.
The unemployment rate fell to 5.7 %, a level that had last been undershot ten years earlier.
This trend was also reflected in consumer prices. Along with an accelerated monetary
growth and external factors, the upward movement of prices which began in the course of
1988 was a factor in triggering the increase in the discount and lombard rates from 2 ~ %
and 4 ~ %, respectively, to 3 ~ % and 5 ~ % in the second half of the year. The rise in
consumer prices reached a provisional peak, at 4 %, in 1992 when the cyclical climate
cooled perceptibly. GDP rose by only 1 % %, and industrial output dropped by just over
I %. In the ensuing year, when the price level rose again slightly, the economyslipped into
a recession which hit the producing sector particularly hard (- 7.0 %). However, as earlyas
1994 a relatively strong economic recovery set in. Monetary policy makers continued the
tighter course they had adopted in mid-1988 until the autumn of 1992. At that time the
discount and lombard rates amounted to 8 % % and 9 % %, respectively. Central bank
interest rates were lowered from September 1992 throughout 1993. Interest rates were cut
in seven steps, and at the end of 1993 the key interest rates amounted to 5 % % and 6 % %,
respectively.
As for the preceding period 1978-82, the financing structUre in the first year of the period,
1988, will first be described.
5.3.2. Corporate structure in 1988
Table 11 shows that there were pronounced differences between all three size categories of
the INCs on the liability side ofcorporate balance sheets. The own fund ratio, in particular,
increased sharply with the size of the finns while the reverse was the case for the
significance ofbank loans - in line with the movement among INCs in 1978. For the small
INCs, the share of bank 10ans in the balance sheet total came to nearly 30 %, but for the
large ones to only 6 %. As regards the maturity, the large finns, with a ratio of

long-tenn to short-tenn bank loans ofjust over 150 %, were oriented more strongly to the
long tenn than the SMEs (almost 100 %). Apart from bank loans, trade credits and other
short-tenn creditors55 played an important role. As regards trade credits, a11 size categories
were net creditors, with the medium-sized and large firms predominating. Tbe data on
short-term debtors from participating interests56 - together with the size-specific structure
ofother creditors - pennit the conclusion that large firms may have lent resources to SMEs.
In line with section 5.2, enterprises ofdependent legal status will be analysed in addition to
INCs. Tbe small firms accounted for just over 9 % of all enterprises in both legal
categories, although they played only a marginal role as far as tumover and other variables
were concemed (see table 12). Tbe large enterprises dominated the Bundesbank sampie.
Tbe large INCs generated. just over two-thirds of tumover while accounting for only one
eighth ofall finns; only in the case ofbank loans was their share distinctly lower, at 50 %.
This influence of the large enterprises was not quite as pronounced in the case of SPslPs.
Enterprises with a tumover ofover DM 50 million, which accounted for 10 % ofall finns,
generated 16 % of total turnover; in the case of bank loans their weight was just over one
fiftb. Tbere were also c1ear differences between the two databases as regards balance sheet

ratios. Although, according to table 11, the small INCs and the small SPs/Ps had almost the
sa~e own funds ratio, the medium-sized and large firms showed differences of 7 and 1l
percentage points, respectively, between the two categories. The bank dependence of the
two legal forms decreased with their sizes but was clearly greater for SPsIPs than for INCs.
The bank debt ofthe SPsIPs was more strongly oriented to the Iong term than that ofINCs.
In the case of small SPs/Ps,the long-term orientation was most pronounced at a ratio of
long-term to short-term Ioans of 150 %.57
The two periods 1978-82 and 1988-93 were evaluated separately not least because the
databases showed different structures and may therefore influence the results in respect of
the credit channel. Strong structural shifts could be observed for both legal forms between
the two initial years 1978 and 1988 (see tables 2 and 12). The significance of small firms
declined dramatically in every respect.

The "winners" were particularly the large SPsIPs and the large INCs,58 As regards the
balance sheet data, a marked decline in the own funds ratios of SMEs was recorded
57 For a detailed discussion of the differences in the capital structure of small and medium-sized enterprises
ofthe two legal forms, see Deutsche Bundesbank (1993, pp. 34-38).
58 This results, inter aUa, from the fact that, despite the growth in tumover, fIXed size categories were used
for both observation periods and that the private limited company has gained increasing significance as a

-37
irrespective of the legal form (see tables I and 11). Bank dependence moved in the
opposite direction. In 1988 the share of bank loans in the balance sheet total of SMEs was
considerably larger than in 1978, although a movement in the opposite direction was found
for the large enterprises - reflecting increasing disintermediation.59 For both periods,
however, the small unlimited-liability firms were indebted to the banks over a longer term
than their large counterparts, whereas the opposite was the case with the INCs.
In line with the stylised facts outlined above, the credit channel theory would lead us to
expect that the small enterprlses react more sensitively to restrictive monetary policy
measures. In addition, firms might tend to provide greater indications for the existence of
the credit channel in the observation period 1988-93 than in the period 1978-82 because the
trend in creditworthiness and bank dependence suggests a more acute impact of monetary
policy on corporate behaviour. As the approach adopted was the same as that described in
section 5.2, only the most significant results will be discussed below.
5.3.3. Incorporated enterprises and the credit channel
As regards the financial position of INCs over time, all ratios analysed deteriorated for the
SMEs in the period 1989-93, and this trend was most pronounced for small firms. This
becomes immediately evident from the coverage ratios which, according to table 13,
amounted to roughly 44 % in 1989 for both size categories. Several years later the small
INCs showed a ratio of 127 % (which means that they did not even generate the interest
paid), while the medium-sized firms had a ratio of 84 %. The firms with a turnover ofover
DM 50 million recorded only a very moderate deterioration oftheir financial position; only
in 1993 was a slight "slippage" of the own funds ratio registered. Despite unfavourable
underlying conditions, the cash flow indicator even displayed a positive trend from 1992.
This confirms the result derived for the earlier period, namely that in phases ofa restrictive
monetary policy the impact on creditworthiness increases inversely to the size of the
enterprises. It should be noted that this trend was agam recorded in the context of an
economic downswing.
Just like bank dependence and creditworthiness, fixed asset formation showed a size
specific trend (see table 14).60 The small INCs increased their tangible fixed assets sharply
59 For the longer-term trend in own funds and bank creditors, see Deutsche Bundesbank (1992b, pp. 26-27).
60 For stockbuilding no size-dependent reactions typical ofthe credit channel could be found.
-38
until 1991 but reduced their asset formation with the start of the economic downswing,
which is also reflected in the negative investment ratio in 1993. By contrast, the net asset
formation of enterprises in the two other size categories was positive in 1992 as weIl, with
rising shares of tangib1e fixed assets in the balance sheet total. From 1993, however, the
medium-sized and large firms, too, could not avoid reducing their capita1 stock. The credit
channe1-specific indicators disp1ayed a pattern which was largely in line with that described
in section 5.2. Since, however, asset formation responded more strongly in the period
1988-93 than before, supp1y restrictions by the banks may perhaps now be confirmed as an
explanation. As before, bank loans of the individual size categories will be considered in a
first step.

Until 1991, the peak of the high-interest-rate phase, bank loans were comparatively
expansionary (both in absolute and relative terms) for all size categories; subsequently the
increase decelera~ and in 1993 bank loans even fell absolutely for large firms. The small
enterprises continued to fare best. Total short and long-term loans grew by 6 % and 2 % in
nominal terms; their share in the balance sheet total rose by nearly 4 percentage points
compared with 1991. Hence, at least in this cross comparison, no discrimination against
small enterprises in lending could be found. The trend in bank debt was associated with an
increase in the ratio ofshort-term to long-term loans to over 100 % for all size categories;
in 1988 this ratio bad been not quite two-thirds for INCs with a turnover of over DM 50
million.
The other relevant liabilities, trade credits and other creditors, likewise provide no
indication that possible credit requirements may have been covered through these channels
rather than bank loans. The ratio of bank loans to allother forms of credit increased very
distinctly for the SMEs, while the ratio remained largely constant for the large firms
throughout the years under review. Apointer to credit rationing might be given by the
subitem long-term creditors from participating interests. Their share in the balance sheet
total increased slightly for small firms, whereas it tended to decline for the two larger
groups. This suggests that in contractionary periods small firms also obtain credit from
affiliated enterprises. Since, however, large firmst debtors from participating interests did
not increase this might be due to loans by partners and proprietors. There was still no
"overtake effect", however, since long-term bank loans gained much more in importance,
which means that credit institutions are the preferred source offinance ofINCs. Although 
-40
as outlined above - the conditions for the emergence of the credit channel were fairly
favourable, uo indications ofits operation could be found in the period 1988-93.
5.3.4. Sole proprietorships/partnerships and the credit channel
The results found for INCs hold true for enterprises of dependent legal status as weH.
During the period 1989-93 the creditworthiness of small enterprises was affected most (see
table 15). In the last year of that period the own funds ratios of the SMEs even fell below
the 10 % mark.61 Firms in aH three size categories expanded their capital stock until 1992;
in 1993, when the full force of the recession was feIt, the stocks of tangible fixed assets
were reduced, as is shown in table 16. Irrespective of whether it is measured by the
percentage change in tangible fixed assets, the balance sheet ratio or the investment ratio,
the effect on investment behaviour was most pronounced in the case of firms with a
tumover of less than DM 5 million. Like the INCs, firms having legal capacity reduced
their asset formation more sharply than at the beginning ofthe eighties.

Bank loans showed positive growth rates for all size categories throughout the period
1989-93 (see table 16); until 1991 the growth rates of small enterprises were lowest, but
61 In 1982 their corresponding own funds ratios had been 13.1 % and 15.6 %, respectively.
-41
two years later they were distinctly higher than that offirms with a tumover ofover DM 50
million. Measured by their share in the balance sheet total, bank loans of small firms
actually increased most sharply over the entire period under review. This can be rated as
evidence that bank lending is not squeezed to the disadvantage of small firms, as is claimed
in the credit channelliterature. All enterprises increased their ratio of short-term to long
term loans but only the SMEs remained predominantly long-term-oriented as in the first
year of the period under review 1988.

Neither supplier's credits nor other creditors gave any indication of an "overtake effect".
Gross trade credits fell for all firms; this was accompanied by a largely parallel trend in the
corresponding debtors. The long-term creditors from participating interests declined for all
size categories. By contrast, the long-term bank loans of small enterprises increased
distinctly. The trend in the ratio of bank loans to other credits, which may also be used as
an indicator of the operation of the credit channel, showed a pronounced rise for the small
firms. This rise was so strong that in 1993 bank loans exceeded other creditors by almost
30 %; five years previously, the ratio bad been nearly even. This is also to be seen as
evidence of the bank dependence of small firms, which can be seen to increase over time.
The contrary would have to be expected according to the credit channel theory.
-42
5.3.5. Conclusion
The proposition that asset fonnation of small enterprises declines more sharply in
restrictive monetary phases can be clearly confinned for the INCs and SPs/Ps in the period
1988-93. For neither legal fonn~ however, was there any size-specific discrimination in
bank lending. Neither the trend in bank loans in a cross comparison nor the ratio of bank
loans to other credits showed corresponding patterns. Compared with the findings for
1978-82, these results are largely similar,62 although the two databases differed
considerably regarding the financial position and the bank dependence of the finns
analysed.63 The descriptive method chosen for observing the individual fonns of credit in
the various size categories thus seems to have reached the limits of its infonnative value.
All that remains is to examine whether infonnation on restrictions ofcredit for small finns
can be derived from the movement of the size-specific interest rates. Here, too, only data
from the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics for the manufacturing sector were
evaluated.
5.4. Comparison offirm-specific cost ofcredit
According to the credit channel approach, any size-specific discrimination against finns
should also be reflected in the interest rates levied on bank loans. Either interest rates
should increase far more sharply for small enterprises thari market rates in the wake of a
restrictive monetary policy and the associated supply shortages, or else they should actually
move more slowly owing to credit rationing. The approach usually adopted in the literature
is geared to published interest rates, which for the reasons already mentioned (see
section 4.1) ean hardly supply infonnative results. This section is based on interest rates
derived from corporate data. The interest rates of enterprises with a turnover of over
DM 50 million were used as the control variable as they could be expeeted to be relatively
undistorted and most nearly in line with market eonditions beeause large finns are probably
least affected by asymmetrie infonnation. It is then investigated whether the eost of credit
of other size eategories systematieally differs from the "referenee interest rates" over time.
This is examined for the periods ofrising interest rates (1978-81 and 1988-91) and for eaeh
legal fonn. It has to be borne in mind that only average rates, not marginal interest rates,
62 The bank loans of an finns increased slightly, however, in 1993 against 1992, whereas they fell in 1988 

compared with 1987. 

63 Regarding the maturity of the debt structures there are hardly any deviations between the two periods 

under review. 

-43
could be ascertained; this reduces the informative value since it is not exactly the interest
rate for a credit unit of additional demand that can be detennined - as would be desirable in
theory.64
The average interest rate is detennined from the ratio of interest paid to interest-bearing
creditors. Interest-bearing creditors include bank loans, loans from participating interests
and allother creditors. The method of calculation shows that the average interest rate is a
somewhat problematic variable. Unlike creditors, interest paid cannot be split into short
term and long-term. Liabilities themselves are a very heterogeneous variable. They include
items for which it is not known whether any interest was charged at all and, if so, what
amount. Particularly loans from participating interests, which include proprietors' and
partners' loans, are likely to be the subject of "window-dressing" by accountants, and the
other credits include items such as laX liabilities and unpaid wages and salaries. Finally,
creditors are only available as end-of-year levels and not as averages for the year, regarding
the maturity, too, no further differentiation beyond short-term and long-term is possible.
According to table 17, a clear size-specific graduation of average interest rates could be
found for both legal forms in 1978. The smaller the enterprise, the higher was the average
interest rate. The differentiation was even more pronounced for the SPslPs than for the
INCs. This graduation suggests the existence of premiums in line with the theory of
asymmetric information, but it can also be explained by other factors. Possible causes are
the negotiating strength of the fmns or the existence of fixed costs for the credit agreement,
which in the case of small loans, must be paid for through higher interest rates. The debt
structure of the individual size categories - short-term versus long-term loans, the share of
bank loans in interest-bearing creditors65 - offers no explanation for the differences in
credit costs. The relatively low level of average lending rates in comparison with market
rates in the corporate balance sheet statistics may be due, inter aUa, to the fact that no
interest was paid on various components included under interest-bearing creditors - which
seems likely.
64 Generally¬∑ the difference between the annual average interest rates likewise provides no precise
am>roximation for the marginaJ cost of crediL
65 The structure of creditors could playa role because, according to figure 3, the interest rates for current
account credits are higher than for long-tenn loans or because, in the case of bank loans. it can certainly be
assumed that the firms incur interest costs.

With the rise in central bank interest rates from 1979, the average interest rates paid by
. INCs ofall size categories likewise increased steadily up to and including 1981, the peak of
the interest rate trend at the time. For the SMEs the increase was markedly sharper, at
almost 4 %, than for the large firms (+ 3 Yz %). This might be regarded as an indication of a
supply shortage for firms with weaker creditworthiness and a strong dependence on banks,
in line with the credit channel theory. Exactly the reverse trend was found for the SPslPs,
however, among which enterprises with a tumover ofover DM 50 million ultimately had to
pay higher interest rates than the medium-sized firms. This matches neither the trend in
financial ratios nor the trend in the structure of creditors. The slightly sluggish interest rate
adjustment for the SMEs might suggest credit rationing; it appears rather implausible,
however, to simultaneously give higher premiurns as the reason for the reaction of the
small and medium-sized INCs. Furthermore, such a "dual" argumentation contradicts the
consistent base structure for 1978.
If the period 1988-92 is considered, there was initially a size-dependent differentiation of
interest rates both for INCs and for SPsIPs in 1988, although the interest rate differences
were larger in the case of firms of dependent legal status (see table 18). Up to the peak of
the interest rate phase in 1992, the cost of credit for the two legal forms did not move in
parallel, however; the trend even deviated distinctly from the observation period 1978-81.
In the case of INCs, the rise increased with the size category, so that ultimately the
structure of 1988 almost levels out. For the SPsIPs interest rates rose irrespective of the
size by 2.6 to 2.7 percentage points. These diverging trends, which argue both for and
against a discrimination against small enterprises, cannot plausibly be explained by the
trend in the debt structure or the creditworthiness ratios.

The analysis of the average interest rates at first appears rather promising for the initial
years 1978 and 1988. The clearly size-specific structure could indeed be explained by
means ofpremiums cbarged to firms with a weaker creditworthiness. However, other inter
pretations are possible, with the result that no¬∑ clear conclusion can be drawn as to a
discrimination as predicted by the credit channel theory. Once the analysis is extended to
the "hot" monetary policy pbases, any consistency in the initial years is lost. Nearly all
variants of cbanges in interest rates occur; the result is that neither credit rationing nor
rising interest rates as a result ofa tighter supply can be confirmed. On the whole it can be
said that the attempt to draw conclusions on the credit channel from the cost of credit on
the basis of the balance sheets is just as unsuccessful as the approach adopted in the
literature hitherto. Ultimately the available data are not precise enough to aHow an exact
clarification of the facts. The interest rate reactions cannot supply any additional
information for the analysis ofcredit movements.

6. Conclusions and outlook 

The credit channel theory says that restrictive monetary policy measures operate not only
via the interest rate effect but, in addition, via restrictions on the credit supply side which 
over and above market interest rate levels - lead to rising lending rates andlor credit
rationing with a correspondingly sluggish interest rate adjustment. Owing to their greater
bank dependence and weaker creditworthiness, this is likely to affect primarily small
enterprises. The approach to testing the credit channel theory adopted in the present study
with the aid of the Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics is based on a cross
comparison ofthe movement ofbank loans between firms ofthe individual size categories
and on the movement ofbank loans against other forms ofcredit; furthermore, size-specific
reactions ofinterest rates for corporate loans were examined. The credit channe1 theory has
precise response anticipations for all these aspects. Past findings for the United States and
in some cases other countries in favour of the credit channel are very impressive, but they
cannot be confirmed for the manufacturing sector in Germany. Irrespective of the period
under review and the legal form of the firms, bank loans and other creditors provide no
indication of any discrimination by banks against small enterprises.66 Supply-induced
selective effects of monetary policy, which might serve as an argument, say, for interest
rate subsidies to cushion structural distortions, are thus not identifiable. Hence, the credit
channel offers no explanation for the fact that the fixed asset formation of small firms
responded more strongly than that of large firms in the periods analysed. In the aggregate,
this means that the extent of the economic downswings in 1980-2 and 1992-3 can scarcely
be attributed to credit restrictions induced by monetary policy in the sense of the credit
channel approach. To this extent, the results obtained here are in line with the analyses by
Neuberger (1994) and Tsatsaronis (1995) who, using econometric methods and overall
economic data, found no indications ofsupply disturbances by banks.
The results derived in this study contradict numerous studies for other countries. Three
aspects seem to be particularly relevant for explaining this difference: institutional
conditions in Germany, characteristics of the source material and shortcomings of the
evaluation method.
66 Stricdy speaking, it cannot be mied out that the potential demand for credit, which cannot be measured,
exceeds actually observable credits to small enterprises and that therefore credit was rationed. Nor can any
dear statements be made on possible size-specific premiums which may have formed part of the cost of
credit, since the mterest rate reactions derived from the corporate balance sheets show no systematic and
mterpretable pattem.
-47 

The asymmetric distribution of information and the associated credit restriction as a result
of a deterioration of creditworthiness, which are the premises on which the balance sheet
channel is based, can be reduced by various institutional structures within the financial
system.67 Such structures include, in particular, the relationship between banks and
borrowers. In Germany the house bank principle is one of the mainstays for the SMEs, in
particular.68 Traditionally there are very close links between the two agents, and financial
transactions, including private transactions, are predominantly or even exclusively settled
via the house bank.69 Owing to long-standing relations, this results, firstly, in a good
knowledge of the situation of the firm and, secondly, banks have a certain overview of the
private financial position. This is ofparticular importance in the case of firms ofdependent
legal status which, according to the corporate balance sheet statistics, have a very low own
funds ratio and whose proprietors are also personally liable. Compared with many other
countries, there is a further difference in the nature of property law and bankruptcy
legislation. 80th are designed relatively favourably for creditors in Germany. In contrast to
other countries, real collateralisation is possible without special formal requirements and,
moreover, loan collateral is very largely acknowledged in the event of insolvency, whereas
abroad it is frequently not the interests of the secured creditors which are to the fore.70 It
follows from this that banks, especially house banks, can limit their losses in the event of
bankruptcy and are able to grant their loans "at smaller risks" than in countries where no
such regulations exist. The house bank principle and the relevant legal regulations reduce
the information asymmetries between lenders and borrowers; in this way they moderate the
non-neutrality (which can be theoretically substantiated) ofthe fmancial sector in respect of
economic activities. As a result, the credit channel, and especially the balance sheet
channel, may not be effective in Germany because the financial system "cushions" moral
hazard and adverse selection by the mechanisms described above. As mentioned in section
3.2, the "transfer" of the bank lending channel hypothesis is also affected by institutional
factors. The more highly developed the financial markets are, the less significant this
67 For the theoretical argumentation. see Neuberger (1994) and PetersenlRajan (1994).
68 Owing to the possibility (wbich is exeluded in other countries) for credit institutions to acquire
participating interests in large enterprises. there are also relatively elose relationsbips between banks and
large enterprises in Gennany (see Cable, 1985; AllenIGale, 1995).
69 It is to be assumed, however, that even small and medium-sized enterprises normally have several
connections with cremt institutions other than their house bank. In some of the literature a declining
significance ofthe house bank relationsbip is derived from this (see Fischer, 1990).
70 Tbe scale of collateralising in Germany is likely to be very luge. According to a study by
DrukarczyklDuttielRieger (1985), 80 % of the credit agreements and 70 % of the cremt volume - with
reference to short and medium-term loans - are collateralised. It is to be assumed that the share of collateral
for long-term loans is even bigher.
-48
influence is like1y to be. This situation applies above all in the United States, whereas the
following is true for Germany: "Financial markets in Germany are relatively undeveloped
compared to most other industrial countries." (Allen/Gale, 1995, p. 183). Accordingly, the
bank lending channel should in fact operate very strongly in Germany. As in the case ofthe
balance sheet channel, however, the house bank principle may have a moderating effect for
the banks hold potentially liquid assets or sell securities in order to be able to satisfy
enterprises' requests for credit (see Gertler/Gilchrist, 1993, p. 47). It is to be assumed that
good customers, in particular, benefit from such buffers offered by their house banks and
are therefore not faced with additional supply restrictions.
Although the house bank principle and comprehensive collateralising options reduce credit
supply restrictions, it is questionable whether new, young firms benefit from this as well.
To this extent, the credit channel might operate in that segment. This group of enterprises
is not represented in the Bundesbank's source material, however, for, owing to the
cylindered sampie structure used, enterprises are at least five or six years old, irrespective
of the size category (see section 5.1). This implies, furthermore, that the probability of
insolvency is much smaller for enterprises inc1uded in the Bundesbank statistics than it is
for young firms and that therefore a restriction of the credit supply by banks is on average
less likely despite dec1ining creditworthiness over time.71 Even though the database does
not inc1ude these enterprises and thus distorts the degree of representativeness, the "error"
in respect of the credit channel is difficult to assess. Small firms, which as a rule is the
category in which young firms are found, have only a very small economic weight even in
the universe, as is shown by the tumover tax statistics. It is therefore questionable whether
steep economic downswings (which the advocates of the credit channel seek to explain)
can be substantiated by means of such a special segment.72 The statistics used select not
only by age but also systematically by size and creditworthiness, although all three features
overlap. The dominance of larger enterprises becomes immediately evident from a
comparison with the relevant data from the tumover tax statistics (see section 5.1). As
regards creditworthiness, trade bills are accepted by the Bundesbank only from firms with a
good credit rating. This means that, for prudential reasons, the commercial banks take care
to submit only high-quality bills of exchange to the Bundesbank so as to avoid rejection.
71 For the link between age and insolvency, see, for example, Angele (1996).
72 Irrespective of their relevance to the transmission mechanism, credit restrictions for young frrms are a
major economic policy problem in the context of structural change. The Gerrnan house bank system, which
institutionalises lending to "old" customers, may even have a negative impact, owing to a possible braking
effect, on the process of change in the corporate landscape (see Audretsch, 1995).
-49
For that reason, commercial banks grant bill-based loans primarily to good customers. It
follows from the age of the firms, the size and the bill of exchange practices that the
balance sheet statistics present a special selection of enterprises. Although they represent
the core of the corporate landscape of the manufacturing sector, they do not embrace the
marginal segments.73 In order to reduce this ttquality bias" and to be able to analyse the
credit channel more precisely, there are various possibilities for improving the database.
The inclusion of new, young firms requires supplementary analyses of data which are
available to banks which promote business start-ups. In addition, surveys among borrowers
and lenders might provide information on the amount ofcollateral and on credit rationing,
Le. about the "true" interest rate or the potential demand for credit, on which the official
statistics contain no direct data. Finally, besides corporate data, the Bundesbank's
borrowers statistics could be evaluated. For one thing, that would obviate the need to
confine the analysis to the manufacturing sector as all corporate loans are included; for
another, the quarterly data available are more sensitive to monetary stimuli than the annual
data from the corporate balance sheets. A further option would be to evaluate the balance
sheets of banks. Following KashyaplStein (1995), the credit patterns of small and large
banks could be investigated; size-specific lending might provide indications of the
existence ofa credit channel.
Apart from the data selection, a further bias might result from the methodology used.
Although data disaggregated by size categories and legal forms as weil as types of credit
are used, there is a danger of a considerable loss of information owing to the use of group
data; moreover, the analysis was confined to the observation ofrates ofchange or the trend
in specific ratios. There is a good theoretical basis for interpreting the figures, but the
procedure necessarily implies limitations on the informative value of the results. An
improvement may be possible by means of microeconometric analysis. Even if the results
of the panel studies have not yet been able to provide convincing proof ofthe existence of
the credit channel, it appears sensible to pursue this approach both theoretically and
empirically. Perbaps the results obtained here can be formulated more precisely by
estimating the size-specific investment behaviour. The use of corporate data in Germany
has the disadvantage that the applicability oftime-series-analytical methods is very limited.
0wing to the limitation to annual data and the numerous structura1 breaks, the number of
consistent points of observation is relatively small; moreover, the informative value of a
73 Tbis is confmned by the below-avemge insolvency risk of firms represented in the Bundesbank's source
material compared with all German enterprises (see Deutsche Bundesbank. 1992a).
-50
long time series would be extremely distorted owing to the survivor bias.74 The borrowers
statistics can be ofsome help as the quarterly data at least permit a time series analysis.
The above statements show that there may be various reasons why this study could not
confirm the credit channel hypothesis for Germany. Although there is a distinct bias of
corporate data in favour of firms of good creditworthiness, it must be remembered that the
Bundesbank's corporate balance sheet statistics are more comprehensive than all other
databases available. In particular, they contain a great number of small firms and also
unincorporated enterprises. Moreover, the result can be underpinned in terms of
institutional economics. Institutional regulations reduce credit restrietions by banks which
may result from the market failure of asymmetrie information; the rejection of the credit
channel theory for the core sector of the German economy - the manufacturing sector 
therefore appears to be quite justified.
74 This applies if, as with a cylindered sampie, every enterprise is included in the sampie in every year.
