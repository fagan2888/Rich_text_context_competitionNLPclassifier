Graphical study of reasons for engagement in
physical activity in European Union
Daniel Ríos*, Marta Cubedo and Martín Ríos
Abstract
We collect data on 15 reasons why people in the 27 EU countries engage in physical activity, from the European
Commission's Special Eurobarometer. A graphical output was obtained using classical Principal Component Analysis
techniques in order to analyse types of motivation in the EU. Cluster Analysis method were used to define the
interrelationship between the data in the 27 countries. People in Sweden, Denmark and Finland were the most
highly motivated. High rates were detected in Austria, Germany, Slovenia, Estonia, Luxembourg and Latvia while
low rates were found in Bulgaria, Romania, Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Hungary, Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal
and Slovakia. The lowest motivation rates were in the Netherlands. Regarding the reasons for engaging in exercise
(a sport or physical activity), we observed two motivation types. The first group was related to health and physical
appearance while the second was associated with social reasons: to be with friends, to better integrate into society,
to meet people from other cultures. For citizens of Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania, health and physical appearance
carried greater importance than the European average while for citizens of Germany, Finland and Sweden the
second motivation type was higher than the European average.

Introduction
Physical activity is closely related to reduced morbidity
and mortality in developed countries, where rates of non-
communicable diseases have increased rapidly in recent
years, (World Health Organization 2002). The World
Health Organization, (Bauman et al. 2005), recommended
that people engage in physically active daily.
In spite of the benefits of physical activity, most people
in the European Union (E. U.) do not exercise, (defined
as the deliberate performance of a physical activity that
requires exertion). Over 30% report that they seldom or
never engage in any physical activity and 25% are virtu-
ally inactive (European Commission, 2010). Research
suggests that up to 50% of people who start an exercise
programme drop out within the first six months, (Wilson
& Brookfield, 2009). Therefore, it is of interest to study
what motivates people to exercise. This information would
be of useful to design strategies to encourage people to
participate in and adherence to exercise programmes.
Previous studies have suggested that a better under-
standing of motivation would benefit initiatives to promote
physical activity (Dishman & Sallis, 1994; Trost et al. 2002)
reviewed the range of demographic, biological, psycho-
logical, social, cultural and physical environment factors
associated with physical activity in adults.
Motivation to exercise differs between stages of live
(Allender et al. 2006). (children and adolescents, adults
and elderly) and countries. It is not appropriate to base
physical activity recommendations for children and ado-
lescents on evidence of morbidity and mortality; how-
ever in this group proposing physical activity as a way
to enhance social interaction would be suitable. During
adulthood, there is a need to reduce premature risk fac-
tors for a range of chronic diseases and conditions and
to maintain an energy balance. Furthermore physical
activity has the potential to improve mental health. In
the elderly motivation to engage in physical activity may
be that it slows the ageing process and contributes to
maintaining functional capacity.
Early work on motivation for sport and exercise (Alderman
& Wood, 1976) proposed that young athletes in Canada
participated in sports for fitness, challenge and fun.
(Williams & Cox, 2003) stated that the reasons for partici-
pation were linked to social prestige and status. Other

reasons for engaging in these practices include personal
challenge and satisfaction, fitness and the desire to lose
weight and improve health, (Daley & Duda, 2006; Edmunds
et al. 2006). The role of appearance/weight, health/fitness
and social engagement motives in exercise participation
was tested by (Markland & Ingledew, 2007; Ingledew &
Markland, 2008).
A theoretical approach to determining the motivation
behind participation in exercise and physical activity can
be found in (González-Cutre et al. 2010).
In the present study, we explored the reasons why
people in 27 European countries exercise and we propose
strategies for practical application of these data in the
E. U. We used principal component analysis (PCA)
(Anderson, 1958; Muirhead 1982), to display the results
according to the different populations. Small distances
on the graph indicate similar populations, whereas large
distances show dissimilar populations in their motivation
to exercise. This analysis allowed us to identify motiv-
ational level differences between countries. For this pur-
pose, 15 variables corresponding to types of motivation
to engage in sport or physical activity were considered
for each country. First, we classified the countries using
cluster methods. We then plotted the output data for
these countries as points on a graph in a low-dimensional
Euclidean space. Classical PCA was used to obtain the
final graphical output.
Methods
Reported cases
The data presented in this study were provided by the
European Commission (2010) and can be further fil-
tered, tabulated, charted and downloaded. They are
available at: http://ec.europa.eu/public_opinion/archives/
ebs/ebs_334_en.pdf. This information permit to repeat
the work.
The data analysed correspond to 27 European countries
and one "average" country. The following 15 variables
were proposed as reasons to practice sport or engage in
physical activity: to improve health, to improve fitness,
to relax, to have fun, to improve physical appearance, to
improve physical performance, to control weight, to be
with friends, to counteract the effects of ageing, to im-
prove self-esteem, to develop new skills, for the spirit
of competition, to make new acquaintances, to better
integrate into society and to meet people from other
cultures.
Statistical analysis
As the data (proportion of citizens in each country),
were obtained from large populations they can be con-
sidered as random normally distributed variables.
Each country and one "average" country was associated
with the n-dimensional random vector Xh
= (Xh1
,...,Xhn
)
where Xhi
represents the proportion of citizens in the
country h that have the motivation i = 1,...,n, to participate
in sport or engage in physical activity (see "Reported cases"
section above). In this study h = 27 + 1 = 28 and n = 15.
For each country, we have a realization x = (x1,...,xn).
The distance between the population x = (x1,...,xn) and
y = (y1,...,yn) is given by d ¼

The interdistance matrix D was used to obtain a graph-
ical output through taxonomic analysis. Similar objects
were grouped into clusters (subsets of a set of objects); two
clusters may be separate. On the basis of the distance be-
tween pairs of objects, the distance between the new cluster
and all other objects was defined. We used the unweighted-
pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA).
PCA was performed using the distances obtained. This
method represents a set of points in n-dimensional space
by a subspace of smaller dimensions. The main purpose
is to reduce the data from a large number of variables
to a smaller number of components, there by facilitat-
ing the detection of similarities and differences between
the countries.
Statistical significance was set at p < .05. All analyses were
conducted using the (SPSS Statistical Package version 17.0
2009; Statgraphics® Centurion, STATGRAPHICS® Centurion
XVI User Manual 2010).
Results
The PCA is summarised in Table 1. All coefficients of
the principal components and all eigenvalues are shown.
The inertia percentages accounted for by the first two
axes were 60.4% and 8.9%. These components explained
more than 69% of the total variation. The first compo-
nent was the "size", with all coefficients positive, and it
represents the overall motivation. In the second compo-
nent, the coefficients corresponding to improving health,
increasing fitness, having fun, looking better, boosting
physical performance, controlling weight and counteracting
the effects of ageing were negative, while the rest (to
relaxing, being with friends, improving self-esteem, de-
veloping new skills, exercising the spirit of competition,
making new acquaintances, better integrating into so-
ciety, meeting people from other cultures) were posi-
tive. These observations highlight two types of motivation
to engage in sport or physical activity, the first related
to health and physical appearance and the second asso-
ciated with social reasons. This component takes large
values for countries where social reasons are more im-
portant and small values for countries where reasons
related to health and physical appearance are more im-
portant. The two-dimensional display obtained is shown
in Figure 1.

The first PCA component was positive (indicating
globally higher motivation to exercise) in 8 countries
(Sweden, Germany, Finland, Austria, Germany, Estonia,
Luxembourg, Slovenia and Latvia; from highest to lowest)
and negative (indicating a globally lower motivation to
exercise) in 12 countries (the Netherlands, Bulgaria,
Romania, the Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Hungary,
Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia; from
highest to lowest). The second PCA component was
positive (indicating greater importance of social motives
to exercise) in 3 countries (Germany, Finland and Sweden;
from highest to lowest) and negative (indicating higher
motivation to exercise related to health and physical ap-
pearance) in 3 countries (Latvia, Bulgaria and Romania;
from highest to lowest).
On the basis of the tree reconstructed by UPGMA
(Figure 2) and Figure 1, we identified seven population
groups:
Group I: Denmark, Finland and Sweden.
Group II: Austria, Germany, Estonia, Luxembourg
and Slovenia.
Group III: Latvia.
Group IV: Belgium, Republic of Cyprus, France,
Ireland, Malta, The United Kingdom and
the "average" country.
Group V: The Czech Republic, Greece, Spain, Hungary,
Italy, Lithuania, Poland, Portugal and Slovakia.
Group VI: The Netherlands.
Group VII: Bulgaria and Romania.

Groups I and II were the most motivated to exercise
(Figure 2). Countries included in Groups VI and VII had
the lowest values for the first component, thereby indi-
cating the lowest motivation to engage in physical activ-
ity. The countries with near-average values for the first
component are in Group IV, suggesting that these coun-
tries were in the mid-range.
For the second component, the largest values corre-
sponded to Group I and the lowest to Group III while
moderately high values corresponded to Group V. Group IV
countries showed high motivation although the second
component was close to zero.
Discussion
Here we examined the reasons why citizens in the E. U.
engage in sport and physical activity. A graphical repre-
sentation of the percentage of the populations with a spe-
cific motive to exercise was used to plot the data for the
various countries. This approach was useful because all
coefficients of the first component clearly represented
the "size", i.e., the overall reasons for engaging in sport
or physical activity. The second axis had 7 negative and
8 positive components. This axis represented the type
of motivation, i.e. the populations of countries repre-
sented by points whose second component had a high
positive value were considered to be highly motivated
by health and physical appearance. Conversely when the
coordinates of the points had a second component with
a lower this was interpreted as indicating population
highly motivated to engage in sport and physical activity
for social reasons. The taxonomic method was used to
group the countries.
Our findings reveal that the types of motivation vary
between E. U. countries. On the basis of the tree and
principal component representation, the Nordic countries:
Denmark, Finland and Sweden showed the largest propor-
tion of citizens motivated to engage in sport or physical
activity and this motivation was social. Latvia showed high
motivation reasons being related mainly to health and
physical appearance. In contrast the Netherlands showed
the lowest motivated population and the driving reasons
to engage in exercise were mainly of a social nature. A low
proportion of the people in Bulgaria and Romania were
motivated for exercise and those that did engage in this
activity were driven by reasons mainly associated with
health and physical appearance.
The countries comprising Group I (Nordic countries)
were found to be the most physically active in the
E. U. Less than 20% of the population of these countries
report never exercising or engaging in sport (European
Commission 2010). This finding is explained by the
fact that these countries are the most motivated with
regard to exercise. Group V and Group VII counties are
reported to have the fewest citizens engaging in sport
or exercise, as confirmed by these countries showing
the lowest motivation to exercise. It therefore follows
that countries with high proportion of motivated citi-
zens engage in more physical activity and sport than
the "average" country and those whose populations show
little interest in physical activity are less active than
"average" country.

The countries in Groups II and IV were highly motivated
to exercise and were driven mainly by reasons of health
and physical appearance. In Figure 1 these countries are lo-
cated in quadrant IV, having the following coordinates;
positive abscissa and negative ordinate. A greater pro-
portion of their populations engaged in sport and phys-
ical activity than the "average" country.
Group V countries showed low motivation to exercise
however, those exercising reported motivation linked to
social interactions. In Figure 1 these countries are located
in quadrant II, having the following coordinates; negative
abscissa and positive ordinate. A lower proportion of their
populations engaged in sport and physical activity lower
than the "average" country.
On the basis of all these observations, we can deduce
that the motivations related to health and physical ap-
pearance is more decisive for physical activity. However,
there are some exceptions.
In the Netherlands a low proportion of the population
was motivated to engage in sport and physical activity
however, curiously, this population is among the most
physically active as only 28% report never engaging in
sport or physical activity. People (73%) in the Netherlands
expressed satisfaction with local councils regarding sports
and exercise provision and report a high degree of satis-
faction with their local sports clubs, which are particu-
larly popular.
The people in Latvia were found to be highly motivated
however, a proportion of citizens, more than average of
the E. U. reported never taking any exercise. This finding
could be attributed to the poor economic situation of
the country and consequently of its people.
Bulgaria and Romania are the two countries that most
recently joined the E. U. People in these countries show
little inclination to engage in sport and physical activity
and motivation was essentially related to health and the
regulation of energy expenditure. A relatively high pro-
portion of citizens, more than average of E. U. reported
never engaging in physical exercise. This finding is
explained by the lack of opportunities to be physically
active and to socio-economical limitations.
Conclusions
It is widely accepted in the E. U. that sport and physical
activity contribute to health. We show that in most E. U.
countries there is a link between health and the motiv-
ation to keep physically fit and active. Exceptionally, in
the Nordic countries: Denmark, Finland and Sweden most
people have a strong social motivations to exercise and a
high proportion of the people in these countries do more
physical exercise than the E. U. average.
People in the Netherlands lack motivation to exercise
and when they do engage in this activity it is essentially
for social reasons. Therefore its inhabitants engage in less
sport and physical activity than the E. U. average.
Bulgaria and Romania show low motivation. People in
these countries report being motivated by health issues
and are physically more inactive than E. U. average.
One of the main objectives of the article; to present a
large number of data in summary form without sacri-
ficing too much information, has been achieved and also
aims to encourage future researchers to present informa-
tion accompanied by methods of summary representation.
Others detailed socio-demographic information to help
understand the reasons why sections of European society
(gender, age, education levels, ..), engage in sport and
physical activity. But this should be analyzed by each
country, and is outside the scope of this study.
