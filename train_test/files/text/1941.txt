THERE is growing recognition of the importance of
within-family variability in understanding intergenera-
tional relationships (Davey, Janke, & Savla, 2005; Suitor,
Sechrist, & Pillemer, 2007). The majority of adults were not
raised as the only child in their family (Eggebeen, 1992),
and an extensive literature documents that siblings may ex-
perience different relationships with parents throughout
childhood (McHale, Updegraff, Jackson-Newsom, Tucker,
& Crouter, 2000; Richmond, Stocker, & Rienks, 2005;
Stocker, 1995; Tucker, McHale, & Crouter, 2003; Volling &
Belsky, 1992), and these differences and their effects may
persist into adulthood (Davey, Eggebeen, & Savla, 2007;
Shaw, Krause, Chatters, Connell, & Ingersoll-Dayton, 2004).
In the present study, we examine within-family variability in
adult siblings' recalled experiences with their parents and
association with positive and negative affect across midlife.
Across the lifespan siblings experience what has been
referred to as a "shared environment" in which they all are
exposed to the same environmental factors, such as parents'
average level of affection and discipline, economic status,
and other characteristics of their environment that work to
create similarities between siblings (Daniels & Plomin,
1985). In addition to genetic differences (Pike, Manke,
Reiss, & Plomin, 2000), siblings also have nonshared expe-
riences characterized by those environmental factors that
work to make siblings from the same family different from
one another (Dunn & Plomin, 1990; Rowe & Plomin, 1981).
Nonshared experiences include siblings' relative treatment
by their parents (i.e., favored vs. unfavored) and changes
that occur in the home environment at different ages for
each sibling (e.g., parental health may decline after older
siblings are grown, and younger siblings may experience a
sickly parent in adolescence; Dunn, 1993). A goal of this
study is to consider how two aspects of nonshared environ-
ment (NSE), adult siblings' recollections of parental treat-
ment and characteristics of their home environment, are
connected to current positive and negative affect.
Research on differential treatment in childhood high-
lights its importance for individual well-being (McHale
et al., 2000), but the extent to which perceived differences
persist into adulthood (Boll, Ferring, & Filipp, 2005; Cicire-
lli, 1995) and whether these disparities are associated with
current well-being are unclear. On the one hand, perceived
differences may diminish over time. Parents clearly differ-
entiate between younger and older siblings in early child-
hood, but as siblings enter adulthood, parents may treat
them more comparably (Dunn & Plomin, 1990) or children
may come to accept perceived disparities in treatment as a
stable family dynamic or eventually reappraise these rela-
tionships in adulthood (Levine & Bluck, 1997; Piazza,
Charles, & Almeida, 2007). On the other hand, theorists ar-
gue that once families establish patterns of differential treat-
ment when offspring are young, it is difficult to break these
patterns in adulthood (Fingerman & Bermann, 2000; Troll,
1996). Indeed, studies find that adults retain distinct ideas
about who was the favorite sibling in the family (Bedford,

Background. We examined within-family variation in siblings' memories of experiences with parents and their as-
sociations with current positive and negative affect.
Methods. Participants were 1,369 adults with at least 1 sibling, aged 26­74 years from 498 families in the MacArthur
Study of Midlife in the United States (Mage = 47 years, 59% women, 94% White).
Results. There was considerable variability in recalled maternal and paternal treatment across the dimensions of affection
(intraclass correlation coefficients [ICCs] 0.33 and 0.41, respectively), discipline (ICCs 0.39 and 0.43), and conflict (ICCs 0.24
and 0.26). In turn, recalled parental treatment, particularly affection, made unique contributions to current positive (ICC 0.12)
and negative affect (ICC 0.08) over and above individual and familial level characteristics such as offspring demographic char-
acteristics, extraversion and neuroticism, family structure, recalled early family environment, and parents' current status.
Conclusions. Results link adults' memories of experiences with their parents in childhood to their current well-being
and highlight the importance of considering within-family models for family theory.

1992; Suitor & Pillemer, 2000; Suitor, Sechrist, Steinhour,
& Pillemer, 2006). In childhood, less favored siblings may
suffer emotionally, experience decreased self-esteem, and
exhibit behavioral problems (Brody, Stoneman, & Burke,
1987; McHale et al; Stocker, 1995; Tamrouti-Makkink,
Dubas, Gerris, & van Aken, 2004). Other studies find that
adult children who feel even slightly favored report better
well-being. We expect that offspring with memories of
being treated more poorly than their siblings in childhood
would fare worse on indicators of positive and negative af-
fect in midlife, over and above average recalled levels of
treatment by parents within the family.
Previous studies suggest that parental differential treat-
ment may vary by domain (Hamilton-Giachritsis & Browne,
2005; McHale et al., 2000; Tucker et al., 2003). Parents may
not only favor one sibling with greater affection but also dis-
cipline that sibling more often. Differential treatment may
exist with regard to affection, but not with regard to disci-
pline. Moreover, studies suggest the domain in which differ-
ential treatment occurs has implications for adjustment in
childhood (Tucker et al). Most studies of adults' past relation-
ships with parents have been confined to memories of affection
(e.g., Andersson & Stevens, 1993; Rossi & Rossi, 1990; Shaw
et al., 2004) without considering other kinds of experiences,
but studies considering adults' memories of problems with par-
ents have found that adults readily recall negative aspects of
their relationship experiences (Amato, 1991; Fingerman, 1997;
Whitbeck, Simons, & Conger, 1991). Given the multifaceted
qualities of parent-offspring relationships, this study focused
on siblings' memories of parental affection, discipline, and
conflict. Of course, these memories are reconstructed in the
present and may reflect present situations as well as past ones
(Andersson & Stevens, 1993; Field, 1981; Halverson, 1988).
Yet, regardless of their accuracy, recollections of prior experi-
ence may be important for understanding positive and negative
affect for individuals as well as the nature of their relationships
with others in adulthood (Amato, 1991; Brewin, Andrews,
& Gotlib, 1993; Shaw et al., 2004).
We compare differences in memories of offsprings' relation-
ships with parents "within the same family" to compare sib-
lings'memoriesofparentaltreatmentaboveandbeyondfamily
characteristics. Thus, we considered (a) characteristics which
may vary across siblings within the same family and (b) char-
acteristics which vary across siblings between families.
Characteristics that vary within families: Individual
characteristics of each sibling we could examine were (a)
child demographic characteristics (e.g., age, gender, marital
status, educational attainment, and employment or parental
status) and (b) child personal characteristics (e.g., personal-
ity and health). We also considered birth order, which has
been linked with parental differential treatment in child-
hood (Kowal, Krull, & Kramer, 2004; McHale, Crouter,
McGuire, & Updegraff, 1995; Tucker et al., 2003).
Age was included because younger siblings tend to be
favored in early childhood, but it is not clear whether these
effects continue throughout adolescence and into adulthood.
Gender was included because mothers tend to favor daugh-
ters over sons, and fathers tend to favor sons (Harris &
Morgan, 1991; Lytton & Romney, 1991; Siegal, 1987;
Tucker et al., 2003). Finally, adult siblings vary in their cur-
rent characteristics (e.g., education, employment, marital
status, and parental status), and variability in these charac-
teristics may be associated with differences in ties to par-
ents as well as predict their current well-being (Belsky,
Jaffee, Caspi, Moffitt, & Silva, 2003).
Siblings also bring different features to their relationships
with their parents that may carry over into differential treat-
ment. Evidence suggests that parents favor easygoing chil-
dren with more love and nurturance beginning at an early
age (Brody et al., 1987; Brody, Stoneman, & McCoy, 1992a,
1992b) and are less responsive to difficult or anxious babies
(Rutter et al., 1997). Continuity of individual differences in
temperament or personality is beyond the scope of this
study (Angleitner & Ostendorf, 1994; Mroczek, Spiro, &
Griffin, 2006), but we consider whether adult personality
characteristics are associated with memories of prior expe-
riences with parents. Finally, prospective as well as cross-
sectional studies have shown that individuals' assessment
of their general health and comparative self-rated health are
important predictors of their later social and psychological
well-being (Benyamini, Idler, Leventhal, & Leventhal,
2000) and even subsequent mortality (Mossey & Shapiro,
1982). We therefore include these two variables as a mea-
sure of the personal characteristic of each sibling in the
family.
Characteristics that vary between families: Previous re-
search has shown that parents with more education are less
likely to treat siblings differently based on gender (Harris &
Morgan, 1991), so we expect siblings' memories of ties to be
associated with parents' education. We also include parents'
health and work involvement when children were young to
provide information about the earlier family environment.
We added parents' current health status to our model because
this might be associated with the recollection of memories of
parental treatment and relationships (Davey et al., 2005). Fi-
nally, we consider family-level characteristics such as sibship
size and gender composition. Previous work has shown that
smaller sibships are characterized by greater parental differ-
entiation than larger ones (Freese, Powell, & Steelman, 1999;
Harris & Morgan, 1991) and that the balance of sons and
daughters shapes parent­offspring ties in adulthood (Connidis,
Rosenthal, & McMullin, 1996).
In summary, we used within- and between-family com-
parisons to address the following research questions: (a)
What proportion of the variability in recalled parental treat-
ment and positive and negative affect is explained by family
membership? (b) What within-family and between-family
factors predict variability in adults' recollections of mater-
nal and paternal affection, discipline, and conflict? and (c)
To what extent are recollections of parental treatment
PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARENTS 127
associated with current positive and negative affect,
controlling for both within-family and between-family
characteristics?
Methods
Data are drawn from a study of siblings conducted as part
of the National Survey of Midlife Development in the
United States (MIDUS) sponsored by the MacArthur Foun-
dation Research Network on Successful Midlife Develop-
ment. The initial phase of the study included a random
probability sample of 3,485 English-speaking, noninstitu-
tionalized adults ages 25­74 years, oversampling men and
older respondents. A study of siblings was derived from this
initial sample.
By design, the MIDUS sibling sample was confined to
families where siblings shared the same biological mother
and father. As a result, it provides a more conservative test
of parental differential treatment than might be the case if
step or half siblings were included. Five hundred and twen-
ty-nine of the MIDUS participants who reported that they
had one or more living biological siblings were randomly
selected for this study. Siblings were recruited by asking
these MIDUS participants to provide contact information
and to personally communicate with their siblings about
participation before a recruiter called. Nine hundred and
fifty-one of these siblings ages 25­74 years agreed to par-
ticipate, for a total of 1,480 individuals. Based on partici-
pants' reports of the number of siblings they actually had
while growing up, this sample represents over 88% of the
siblings available in these 529 families (MIDUS did not so-
licit information regarding sibling mortality). As a result of
this inclusion criterion, participants in the sibling data set
were more likely to have grown up with both parents (83%)
than nonsibling MIDUS participants (75%).
To ensure that the overall sample was representative of
each family size, we used fertility patterns for the mother's
birth cohort to adjust the MIDUS sampling weights to ac-
curately reflect the number of only-child families (Taeuber,
1996). Families which included twins (N = 31 families rep-
resented by 98 siblings) and only children (N = 234) were
excluded from analysis. Our results were essentially identi-
cal when only children were included in the sample. An ad-
ditional 13 cases were excluded because of inconsistencies
regarding sibship characteristics which we were unable to
resolve. Our final sample thus consisted of data from 498
families, for an overall sample size of 1,369.
As with almost any large, nationally representative sur-
vey, the MIDUS data set contains partially missing observa-
tions. While no single variable in our study was missing for
a large proportion of our sample, use of listwise deletion
with a large number of variables is not recommended (e.g.,
Acock, 2005; Schafer & Graham, 2002) and would have
resulted in the loss of a relatively large number of observa-
tions. As a result, we constructed five imputed data sets
(Schafer, 1997). Analyses were then run separately for each
imputed data set and results combined using multiple impu-
tation inference. This approach allows for valid parameter
estimates to be obtained while retaining an appropriate
amount of uncertainty in standard errors due to missing
observations.
Procedure
Participants completed three research protocols: one 30-
minute telephone interview and two self-administered ques-
tionnaires sent by mail. Questions used in this study were
distributed throughout the research battery. The original
MIDUS participants completed this battery first, and their
siblings completed the same battery approximately 10­15
months later.
Measures
Because the preceding literature review points to a wide
variety of sources of both differential recalled parental treat-
ment and positive and negative affect, we included measures
of each source in our statistical models, as they were avail-
able in the MIDUS data set.
Predictor Variables
"Child demographic characteristics" included age in
years, whether the child was a daughter (0 = no, 1 = yes),
whether the child was currently married (0 = no, 1 = yes), the
highest grade of school or year of college completed (1 =
some grade school to some high school, 2 = GED or gradu-
ated high school, 3 = some college, 4 = graduated college to
other professional degree or doctorate), whether the child
was currently employed (0 = no, 1 = yes), the number of
marriages, and whether the child was a parent (0 = no,
1 = yes).
"Child personal characteristics" included measures of
neuroticism, extraversion, perceived self-rated health (coded
as 1 = poor to, 5 = excellent), and perceived health relative
to age­peers (1 = much better to 5 = much worse). The Neu-
roticism scale (a = .74) consists of items measuring re-
sponses to the question: "Please indicate how well each of
the following describes you: Moody, Worrying, Nervous,
and Calm [reverse-scored]." Extraversion (a = .78) was
measured using the same item stem question and the adjec-
tives outgoing, friendly, lively, active, and talkative (Lach-
man & Weaver, 1997).
To assess "family structure," we initially considered a
range of variables based on theory and previous research.
For example, we were able to consider family size, coded as
the number of siblings. Birth order was not significant in
any model, so it was not retained. Gender composition of
the sibship was initially considered in a variety of ways,
based on Steelman, Powell, Werum, and Carter (2002). We
considered whether there were any daughters, the proportion
DAVEY ET AL.
128
of male siblings, and the proportion of opposite-sex sib-
lings. In the end, only the last variable was retained. We also
considered spacing of children within the sibship, coded as
total span between oldest and youngest sibling, average age
gap between siblings, and age gap with closest sibling.
None of these was a significant predictor in our models.
Thus, the final family structure variables retained in our
model were family size and proportion of opposite-sex
siblings.
Several indicators of "recalled family environment" were
available in the MIDUS data set. Specifically, we had indi-
cators of maternal and paternal health status when the child
was 16 ("Looking back to when you were 16, how would
you rate your biological [mother's/father's] health at that
time?" 0 = deceased, 1 = poor, 2 = fair, 3 = good, 4 = very
good, 5 = excellent), maternal and paternal educational at-
tainment (coded as 1 = no school/some grade school to 12 =
PhD or other professional degree), and maternal and pater-
nal work involvement during childhood ("How much of
your childhood did [your mother/father] either work for pay
or in a family business?" 1 = not at all to 5 = all). The only
two indicators regarding "parents' current status" that could
be coded for all individuals was whether the mother and
father were currently still living (0 = no, 1 = yes).
Outcome Variables
Recalled parental treatment.--Our first set of models pre-
dicted "quality of maternal and paternal relationships"
across three dimensions. Siblings rated the "degree of affec-
tion" received in childhood from each parent. This index
was developed for the MIDUS study and included five items
pertaining to parental affection (Rossi, 2001). For example,
participants provided a global rating of the quality of the
relationship with each parent in response to the question:
`How would you rate your relationship with your mother
during the years when you were growing up using a scale of
1 to 5 (1 = poor, 5 = excellent)?' Other items assessed ability
to confide in parent, parental expression of love and affec-
tion, empathy concerning problems, and time and attention
provided (a for mothers and fathers = .90 and .92, respec-
tively). Participants also completed a 5-item index of "disci-
pline" received from each parent (Rossi, 2001). These items
were rated on a 4-point scale (1 = a lot, 2 = some, 3 = a little,
4 = not at all) and included harshness of discipline, consis-
tency of discipline, being allowed to engage in activities that
other children the same age were allowed to play, and so
forth (a = .73 and .79 for mothers and fathers, respectively).
A final index of "conflict" with the parent was derived from
a 3-item version of Straus's (1979) Conflict Tactics Scale,
which assessed emotional, physical, and severe physical
conflict with the mother and father. Each dimension of con-
flict was assessed with a single item. For example, emotion-
al conflict was assessed by asking participants to indicate
how often their mother/father: insulted or swore at them,
sulked or refused to talk to them, did something spiteful,
threatened them, or stomped out of the room. Participants
rated the frequency of such behaviors on a 4-point scale (4 =
never, 3 = rarely, 2 = sometimes, 1 = often). Physical con-
flict included pushing, grabbing, slapping, and throwing ob-
jects. Severe physical conflict involved being kicked, bitten,
or hit you with a fist or other object, beat up, choked, burned,
or scalded. We recoded each item as 0 = never, 1 = all other
responses, and summed the items across emotional, physi-
cal, and severe physical conflict to generate an indicator of
level of conflict in which each parent was reported to have
engaged. Thus, scores could range from 0 (none of the be-
haviors ever happened) to 3 (conflict occurred in each of the
three domains at least occasionally; a for dichotomized
items = .65 and .68 for mothers and fathers, respectively).
In order to differentiate overall family levels of maternal
and paternal affection, discipline, and conflict from the dif-
ferential experiences of specific children within those fami-
lies,wealsocalculatedaveragelevelsofaffection,discipline,
and conflict among all siblings in the family and relative
(i.e., deviations from the family mean) treatment compared
with one's siblings (i.e., favored vs. unfavored). Thus, all
offspring from the same family would have the same aver-
age levels of recalled parental treatment, but each offspring
within the same family could have different relative levels
of recalled parental treatment.
Individual positive and negative affect.--Measures of
current positive and negative affect were used to assess in-
dividual well-being, after preliminary analyses indicated
that measures of variables such as depressive symptoms had
very low means and little variability in the sample. Partici-
pants rated their positive and negative affect during the past
30 days using 6-item, 5-point scales (1 = all the time, 5 =
none of the time). Positive feelings included being cheerful,
in good spirits, extremely happy, satisfied, and full of life.
Items assessing distress included feeling nervous, so sad
nothing could cheer you up, hopeless, restless, and fidgety.
Development of these measures has been reported previ-
ously (Mroczek & Kolarz, 1998; a = .91 and .87 for positive
and negative affect, respectively). Descriptive statistics for
all study variables are presented in Table 1.
Analysis Plan
To account for the nonindependence of observations from
multiple siblings within the same family, we used general-
ized estimating equations to estimate all models (see Liang &
Zeger, 1986; Szinovacz & Davey, 2001). This class of models
is very flexible, permitting a wide variety of outcome vari-
ables (continuous, categorical, etc.) and error structures (ex-
changeable, autoregressive, etc.). Additionally, as estimated
using the Stata software package, it was possible to obtain
robust (to violations of the specified error structure) standard
error estimates.
PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARENTS 129
Our analysis proceeded in three distinct steps. To address
our first research question, regarding the proportion of vari-
ance in each of our outcomes which could be explained by
family membership, we estimated intercept-only models
(i.e., no predictors) to obtain these estimates directly (Table
1). In order to address our second research question, regard-
ing within- and between-family predictors of recalled pa-
rental treatment, we estimated separate models for each
dimension of recalled maternal and paternal treatment (Ta-
ble 2). Affection and discipline were treated as continuous
variables, and conflict was treated as ordinal. These vari-
ables, in turn, became predictors for our models predicting
positive and negative affect to address our third research
question. For these analyses, we included both average and
relative levels of recalled parental treatment as predictor
variables in order to differentiate the effects of between-
family and within-family predictors, respectively (Table 3).
Results
Proportion of Variability Shared Within Families
A number of approaches can be used to reflect within-
family similarity (cf. Maguire, 1999). Hox (2002) suggests
that one useful way is the intraclass correlation coefficient
(ICC), which can be interpreted as the expected correlation
between two units (i.e., siblings) from within the same
group (i.e., family). As can be seen in Table 1, there was
considerable within-family similarity in recalled parental
treatment. Specifically, the ICC was 0.33 for recalled mater-
nal affection, 0.39 for maternal discipline, and 0.24 for ma-
ternal conflict. ICC values were similar but consistently
higher for fathers, as 0.41, 0.43, and 0.26 for affection, dis-
cipline, and conflict, respectively. Consistent with expecta-
tions, family membership was somewhat less predictive of
variations in neuroticism (0.17) and extraversion (0.19) and
even less so for positive and negative affect, with ICC val-
ues of 0.12 and 0.08, respectively. Overall, then, this sug-
gests that family is an important source of common variance
in recalled parental treatment.
Predictors of Variability in Recalled Parental Treatment
Having established that a considerable proportion of the
variation in recalled parental treatment can be explained by
family membership, we next identified predictors of this
variation to address our second research question. Results
are presented in Table 2.
Maternal affection.--Several demographic characteris-
tics predicted recalled maternal affection. On average,
daughters reported lower maternal affection than sons (b =
­0.19, p < .01). Married children recalled mothers as more
affectionate (b = 0.15, p < .01), but subsequent marriages
were associated with lower recalled maternal affection (b =
­0.12, p < .01). Additionally, individuals recalled mothers
as less affectionate if they were themselves parents (b =
­0.18, p < .01). Child personal characteristics were also im-
portant. Individuals recalled greater maternal affection if
they were lower on neuroticism (b = ­0.07, p < .05) and
higher on extraversion (b = 0.18, p < .01). None of the fam-
ily structure characteristics were significant predictors of
recalled maternal affection. Recalled family environment,
however, included several significant predictors. Children
recalled mothers as being more affectionate if they also re-
ported that fathers were in better health when the child was
16 (b = 0.05, p < .05) and mothers had more formal educa-
tion (b = 0.04, p < .05).
Maternal discipline.--None of the offspring demograph-
ic characteristics predicted recalled maternal discipline. In
terms of offspring personal characteristics, discipline was
perceived as stricter if offspring were more extraverted (b =
0.14, p < .01). Offspring recalled their mothers to be stricter
when fathers had lower formal education (b = ­0.03,

p < .05), but mothers had higher education (b = 0.03, p <
.05). No other recalled family environment characteristics
were associated with maternal discipline.
Maternal conflict.--Older offspring recalled less mater-
nal conflict (b = ­0.02, p < .05) and offspring higher on
neuroticism recalled more maternal conflict (b = 0.55, p <
.01). The higher the proportion of opposite-sex siblings (b =
­0.65, p < .01) and smaller the families (b = 0.12, p < .01),
the lower the recalled maternal conflict. Recalled conflict
was lower if mothers were in better health when the off-
spring was 16 (b = ­0.09, p < .05).
Paternal affection.--Older offspring (b = 0.01, p < .05),
married offspring (b = 0.16, p < .01), those with less formal
education (b = ­0.07, p < .05), who had fewer previous mar-
riages (b = ­0.09, p < .05), and were more extraverted (b =
0.22, p < .01) recalled greater paternal affection. Siblings
from smaller families (b = ­0.03, p < .05) recalled their
fathers to be more affectionate. Offspring also recalled their

health when the offspring was 16 (b = 0.04, p < .05).
Paternal discipline.--Sons (b = ­0.15, p < .01) and mar-
ried offspring (b = 0.17, p < .01) recalled stricter paternal
discipline, as did offspring who were more extraverted (b =
0.14, p < .01) and those in poorer self-rated health (b = ­0.06,
p < .05). Discipline was recalled to be more strict (b =
0.03, p < .05) when offspring came from larger families. No
recalled family environment variables predicted recalled
paternal discipline.
Paternal conflict.--Younger offspring (b = ­0.02, p < .05)
and sons (b = ­0.56, p < .01) recalled more conflict with
fathers, as did individuals higher in neuroticism (b = 0.51,
p < .01). Offspring recalled less paternal conflict if they had
more opposite-sex siblings (b = ­0.57, p < .01) and smaller
families (b = 0.16, p < .01). Recalled conflict was lower if

PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARENTS 131
fathers were in better health when the offspring was 16
(b = ­0.14, p < .05).
Given the systematic nature of variations within and be-
tween families in recalled parental treatment, we were next
interested in determining the extent to which recalled paren-
tal treatment was associated with positive and negative af-
fect. Results are presented in Table 3.
Positive affect.--Married individuals reported higher
levels of positive affect than did those without a spouse
(b = 0.133, p < .01). Individuals reported higher levels of
positive affect if they were lower on neuroticism (b = ­2.69,
p < .01), higher on extraversion (b = 1.80, p < .01), and in
better self-rated (b = 0.43, p < .01) and age-relative health
(b = ­0.50, p < .01). At the family level, higher average
maternal affection (b = 0.75, p < .01) and stricter maternal
discipline (b = 0.52, p < .05) were both associated with
higher levels of positive affect. Offspring who reported
higher relative levels of maternal affection than their siblings
(b = 0.62, p < .05), but lower levels of maternal discipline
(b = ­0.74, p < .01) reported higher positive affect.
Negative affect.--Offspring who were married reported
lower levels of negative affect (b = ­1.05, p < .01). Individu-
als higher on neuroticism (b = 2.46, p < .01), lower on ex-
traversion (b = ­0.55, p < .01), and in poor self-rated (b =
0.52, p < .01) health reported more negative affect. No fam-
ily structure or recalled family environment variable was
associated with negative affect. In terms of recalled parental
treatment, those recalling greater maternal affection than
their siblings also reported lower levels of negative affect
(b = ­0.91, p < .01).
Discussion
In this study, we set out to identify the extent to which
recalled parental treatment could be explained by family
membership, to identify within- and between-family pre-
dictors of these variations and, in turn, the extent to which
shared and unique aspects of recalled parental treatment
were associated with current positive and negative affect.
This study extended previous research in several regards.
First, it employed a within-family design to investigate the
correlates of differential treatment, both between and within
families simultaneously. Second, it extended consideration
of the effects of differential treatment into midlife, examin-
ing a representative sample of adults aged 26­74 years.
Third, our models included several of the most important
potential confounds likely to affect differential treatment
using retrospective data regarding recalled parental treat-
ment. Specifically, we considered the role of child social
index variables, child psychological variables, particularly
personality and physical health, family structure, recalled
early family environment, and parents' current status.
What Proportion of the Variability in Recalled Parental
Treatment and Positive and Negative Affect Can Be
Explained by Family Membership?
As noted at the beginning of this paper, a number of fac-
tors are potentially confounded in between-family studies
examining recalled parental treatment and its associations
with positive and negative affect. Well-adjusted parents may
tend both to parent well and to have well-adjusted children.
To what factor or factors should we attribute positive out-
comes among offspring? Similarly, it is important to rec-
ognize that families develop over time. Thus, the family
environment experienced by the oldest child may differ
dramatically from the environment experienced by the

youngest child. However, effects of birth order and family
size are confounded in between-family designs.
Although differential treatment from parents is well
established earlier in the lifespan the persistence of these
differences into midlife is not clear. In this study, we found
that a considerable proportion of the variance, typically one
quarter to two fifths, was associated with family member-
ship, consistent with previous research (e.g., McCrae &
Costa, 1988b), and can thus be attributed to sources such as
parents and shared family environment. The remainder,
however, is unique to each child within the family.As would
be expected, the unique component is substantially larger
for the more situationally determined constructs of positive
and negative affect and intermediate for the theoretically
mediating constructs of neuroticism and extraversion (cf.
Block, 1971; McCrae & Costa. 1988b).
The behavioral genetics literature reveals that although
siblings share an environment, individual experiences also
account for a considerable portion of the variance in spe-
cific outcomes similar to positive and negative affect and
that this proportion may increase in adulthood. Indeed, the
ICCs of 0.20 to 0.40 are similar or even relatively high com-
pared with what other studies in this area find (e.g., McCrae
& Costa, 1988b).
Socialization theories assume that shared experiences
lead to similarities among siblings. Our finding that the ma-
jority of variance in each outcome is explained by within-
family rather than between-family variability is consistent
with the results from a substantial behavioral genetics re-
search base that consistently indicates that most variance
lies within rather than between families (Maccoby & Martin,
1983) and results in vast differences between siblings raised
in the same family with regard to personality and well-being
(Dunn & Plomin, 1990; Plomin & Daniels, 1987). These
differences between siblings in the same family are believed
to be due largely to four sources of NSE: differential treat-
ment, differential sibling experiences, differential peer
experiences, and accidents and illnesses unique to the indi-
vidual (Plomin & Daniels, 1987). NSE experiences are
more common than shared experiences and accumulate over
time to create increasing differences between siblings across
development. Similarities between siblings are primarily
believed to be the result of genetic influences rather than a
common family environment.
What Individual and Family Factors Predict Variability in
Adults'Recollections of Maternal and Paternal Affection,
Discipline, and Conflict?
Given that there is substantial variability both within and
between families in recalled parental treatment, we next
considered which factors were systematically associated
with the dimensions of recalled affection, discipline, and
conflict with mothers and fathers. We find that adult siblings
within the same families often have different recalled
experiences with parental treatment, that these differences
are systematic in nature, and that predictors differ both
across domains of treatment and between mothers and fa-
thers. Looking toward child demographic characteristics,
we find that having a spouse generally appears to be linked
with recalled parental treatment in a positive way, being as-
sociated with maternal and paternal affection, as well as
paternal discipline. By contrast a greater number of previ-
ous marriages is associated with recollection of less affec-
tionate parenting by both parents. In addition to spouses, the
presence of biological children is also associated with lower
recalled maternal affection. Whether this is evidence that
current social relationships are important in determining
how early relationships are (re)interpreted or that early ex-
periences shape current relationship functioning requires
longitudinal data (Andersson & Stevens, 1993; Main,
Kaplan, & Cassidy, 1985).
Personality also appears to have a consistent role in re-
called differential treatment, with extraversion being most
strongly associated with the positive aspects of parenting by
mothers and fathers, and neuroticism most consistently as-
sociated with the negative aspects of parenting, specifically
maternal and paternal conflict. These findings are consistent
with a variety of previous research suggesting that parent-
ing and person characteristics color interpretations of events
and life circumstances and vice versa (e.g., Halverson,
1988; McCrae & Costa, 1988a, 1988b). Similarly, although
we cannot rule out the possibility that a positive home envi-
ronment in early life contributes to high extraversion and
low neuroticism, we can at least say that recalled parenting
is independently associated with midlife positive and nega-
tive affect even controlling for personality. We find evidence
consistent with previous research suggesting systematic dif-
ferences in recalled parental treatment as a function of per-
sonality characteristics. Specifically, offspring higher in
extraversion recalled both mothers and fathers as more af-
fectionate and stricter disciplinarians, whereas offspring
higher in neuroticism recalled greater conflict with both
parents and less affection from mothers.
One of the unique aspects of this study was the use of a
within-family design in order to consider the importance of
several aspects of family structure as predictors of recalled
parental treatment. Several consistent findings emerged.
Specifically, fathers were recalled as less affectionate in
larger families. Both recalled discipline and conflict were
lower for offspring with a higher proportion of opposite-sex
siblings. Preliminary models did not find any evidence for
the importance of factors such as age spacing between sib-
lings or effects of birth order; however, other within-family
research from the mother's perspective has suggested that
the position of youngest child may hold special significance
(Suitor et al., 2007).
Because so few studies have applied within-family de-
signs to consider differences in recalled parental treatment
in adulthood, there is little theoretical or conceptual
PAST RELATIONSHIPS WITH PARENTS 133
guidance regarding which aspects of the family environ-
ment are likely to be most important. As well, existing sur-
veys such as MIDUS include relatively few indicators of the
recalled early family environment. Those indicators that
were available to us were associated with some aspects of
recalled parental treatment, but not all. To understand the
importance of recalled family environment, it is important
to recognize that families are systems, and as a result many
influences may be indirect as well as direct. For example, it
is fathers' health that is associated with recalled maternal
affection. Fathers who are in better physical shape may also
have higher earnings or be more involved in parenting, im-
proving the overall family environment.
Likewise, fathers' educational attainment predicts both
lower recalled maternal discipline and less recalled conflict
with fathers. Future research, then, should consider ways of
more directly assessing the early family environment in or-
der to better understand the nature of these associations.
One immediate implication of these findings, however, is
that later-born children are likely to experience lower levels
of maternal discipline and paternal conflict than their older
siblings because parents' educational attainment is higher
(as are income and socioeconomic status), on average, for
later-born offspring than earlier-born offspring.
In the current study, it is notable that age was not consis-
tently associated with recalled parental treatment. The only
age effect we detected involved conflict with mothers and
fathers; older adults recall slightly less conflict. This finding
is consistent with other studies of remembered negative ex-
periences; prior research has found that older adults recall
bad experiences less negatively than younger adults do
(Levine & Bluck, 1997; Piazza et al., 2007). Clearly, re-
called differential treatment by parents persists into midlife.
But is there evidence that this recalled treatment exerts inde-
pendent associations with positive and negative affect over
and above the current contextual sources that also affect it?
To What Extent Are Recollections of Parental Treatment
Associated With Current Positive and Negative Affect,
Controlling for Both Individual and Family
Characteristics?
The demographic and personal characteristics associated
with positive and negative affect are remarkably consistent.
As was found for recalled parental treatment, being married
is associated with higher levels of positive affect and lower
levels of negative affect and is the only significant demo-
graphic predictor. Thus, current relationships with spouse
or children might influence the way that past relationships
with parents are remembered. Alternatively, childhood ex-
periences with parents may be associated with a greater or
lesser likelihood of marrying and/or having children of
one's own.
All four personal characteristics were significant for both
positive and negative affect, with higher neuroticism
predicting lower positive affect and higher negative affect,
higher extraversion predicting higher positive affect and
lower negative affect, better self-rated health predicting
higher positive affect and lower negative affect, and poorer
age-relative health predicting lower positive affect and
higher negative affect.
In terms of implications, the fact that memories of child-
hood experiences show persistent associations with well-
being across the full adult range suggests the potency of these
experiences in forming life trajectories and experiences.
We connect this research to the premise that early experi-
ences with parents in the context of families (i.e., siblings)
may have persistent (albeit minor) effects into late life,
even after individuals have established ties to spouses and
children of their own. Moreover, consistent with prior studies
(Shmotkin, 1999), memories of parents may play a role in the
well-being of adults even after their parents are deceased.
In contrast, none of the family structure or recalled family
environment variables was important for either positive or
negative affect. This is consistent with the lower within-
family variability observed for these outcomes, compared
with recalled parental treatment. Whereas the recalled envi-
ronment itself was not important, recalled parental treatment
within that environment was significantly associated with
positive and negative affect, and the results are informative
for considering differences within and between families.
Average recalled maternal affection, a between-family
characteristic, predicts higher positive affect. Thus, all off-
spring benefit from growing up in a household where moth-
ers are seen as more affectionate. Relative perceptions of
maternal affection, a within-family characteristic, is also
important, however, with offspring who report greater lev-
els of recalled maternal affection than their siblings also
reporting higher levels of positive affect. In contrast, only
higher relative maternal affection predicts lower negative
affect. Thus, the benefits of favored status (or at least the
perceptions of favored status) continue to have positive im-
plications for well-being into midlife, consistent with what
has been found with younger siblings (Stocker, 1995).
Somewhat contrasting findings emerge for the effects of
maternal discipline. Average recalled maternal discipline
predicts higher positive affect. For all offspring within the
family, then, there appear to be benefits of a stricter house-
hold. However, there was also a negative association be-
tween recalled relative maternal discipline and positive
affect. In other words, this is particularly true if mothers
were recalled as less strict for oneself than one's siblings.
What we cannot discern from these data is how the shared
and individual experiences translate into parental behavior.
Does strict maternal discipline translate into greater atten-
tion and concern and thus predict better current function-
ing? Did offspring who received stricter maternal discipline
from mothers than their siblings exhibit more problematic
behaviors in childhood which required greater maternal
control, the effects of which carry over into adulthood?
DAVEY ET AL.

Mothers are more involved with child care and have
closer relationships with their children than fathers do. Most
early within-family comparisons of differential treatment
focused on mothers, but mothers and fathers interact with
their offspring in distinctly different ways (Parke, 1978;
Siegel, 1987). Research comparing mothers' versus fathers'
differential treatment shows that mothers and fathers en-
gage in similar amounts (Brody et al., 1992a, 1992b;
McHale et al., 1995). Comparison of mothers versus fathers
in various domains, however, reveals that in the domains of
affection and temporal involvement, less than half of moth-
ers and fathers reported the same differential treatment pat-
tern (Tucker et al., 2003). Despite these studies, little is
known about fathers' role in this dynamic and highlights the
importance of including reports of mothers' and fathers' dif-
ferential treatment.
Limitations
Although the use of a large, representative sample across
a wide age range is clearly an important strength of the cur-
rent study, there are also several limitations. To begin, these
data are cross-sectional in nature, limiting the ability to
reach any causal inferences because both our predictor vari-
ables and outcomes were assessed on the same occasion. In
addition to the usual biases associated with retrospective
data, which we attempted to control as fully as possible, the
measures considered here are still relatively crude with re-
gard to early parental treatment. It is not clear whether the
full range of parenting behaviors have been adequately re-
flected in the positive and negative aspects of parental treat-
ment available in the MIDUS data set. Certainly, too, the
measures blur the range and dynamics of earlier experiences
either by selecting a specific time point (i.e., age 16) or ag-
gregating across periods of childhood ("How much of your
childhood . . ." or "When you were growing up . . ."). De-
spite these limitations, the current study suggests that repre-
sentations of past relationships with parents continue to vary
in systematic ways both within and between families. In
turn, these systematic differences continue to independently
predict current psychological well-being across midlife.
Longitudinal data linking childhood relationships with
parents to adult outcomes are nearly nonexistent in the
United States and certainly not in the types of national stud-
ies we have with MIDUS. Therefore, sociologists have
commonly used memories of parental relationships as a
proxy for ties to parents in childhood, and researchers also
commonly refer to these memories as representations of the
actual relationship in childhood (e.g., Rossi & Rossi, 1990;
Shaw, 2006; Shaw et al., 2004; Willson, Shuey, & Elder,
2003). Thus, our approach represents a somewhat more so-
phisticated take on the meaning of these variables. As prior
sociological research points out, these variables do repre-
sent past experiences, but they also represent potential re-
constructions of the past (based on present circumstances).
To extend these arguments into implications for the
field, we consider the research of scholars who have shown
that narrative life construction has implications for health
and well-being in late life (e.g., McAdams, 2001). In other
words, it is not simply the events we experienced in the
past, but the way we view those events that makes a differ-
ence for psychological well-being. As this study of sib-
lings suggests, even individuals who grow up in the same
household and who share the same parents may have very
different ways of constructing or remembering that past,
and those memories have implications for their individual
well-being.
Directions for Future Research
What remains for future research to address is the precise
source of these within-family differences. Whether these
differences reflect true long-term effects of parental differ-
ential treatment in a fashion consistent with children's NSE
(Dunn & Plomin, 1990; Plomin & Daniels, 1987) or whether
we are tapping another dimension of the implications of the
parent­child tie on well-being in adulthood (Umberson &
Chen, 1994) remains to be addressed. Although the mea-
sures refer to individual siblings' childhood experiences,
these relationships have been (re)interpreted by individuals
and their siblings into adulthood and midlife. The subse-
quent importance of continued sibling (and parental) ties
may be every bit as important as the early childhood experi-
ences themselves. In sum, we are aware that the study as-
sessed memories, which probably reflect some truth
regarding the early environment as well as factors that have
shaped those memories since that time.
