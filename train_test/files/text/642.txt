Self-report data regarding alcohol, cigarette, and marijuana use were
collected biennially from ages 14 to 20 in a nationally representative panel
sample of adolescents (N 5 1,897) from the Monitoring the Future study.
Growth curve analyses were performed using hierarchical linear modeling
to consider psychosocial background, motivation and school attitudes, and
parental and peer influences at age 14 as predictors of concurrent substance
use and change in substance use. Results indicated that school misbehavior
and peer encouragement of misbehavior were positively associated with
substance use at age 14 and with increased use over time; school bonding,
school interest, school effort, academic achievement, and parental help with
school were negatively associated. The protective effects of positive school
attitudes and perceptions of high status connected to academics were
stronger for low-achieving compared with high-achieving youth. Implica-
tions for a developmental perspective on substance use etiology and
prevention are discussed.

Adolescents who have difficulty in some arenas of their life are likely to
have difficulty in other arenas (Dryfoos, 1990; Gottfredson & Hirschi, 1994;
Jessor & Jessor, 1977). Based on decades of research, negative school
experiences are known risk factors for substance use (Hawkins, Catalano,
& Miller, 1992; Petraitis, Flay, & Miller, 1995). In particular, students with
negative school experiences (including low academic achievement, low
motivation, truancy, or acting out in the classroom) are more likely than
those with more positive school experiences to use alcohol, cigarettes, and
marijuana (e.g., Bachman, Johnston, & O'Malley, 1981; Bryant, Schulen-
berg, Bachman, O'Malley, & Johnston, 2000; Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002;
Diem, McKay, & Jamieson, 1994; Smith & Fogg, 1978). Adolescence is the
time when substance use typically begins and then escalates (Johnston,
O'Malley, & Bachman, 2002), and patterns of behavior related to both
academic difficulties and substance use are likely to be established over
the course of adolescence, setting the stage for subsequent other problem
behaviors and multiple health risks.
Despite the extensive literature on substance use and academic failure,
many important gaps remain. In general, a fuller understanding of the
impact of academic experiences on adolescent substance use requires a
more in-depth consideration of which academic factors are most
important (and for whom) and how these factors relate to both concurrent
substance use and, particularly, to increased use over time. In the present
study, we addressed three gaps in the literature, including the lack of
empirical emphasis on (a) diverse indications of academic success and
failure, including motivation and school attitudes as well as students'
perceptions of the academic beliefs of parents and peers; (b) change in
substance use over multiple time points during adolescence; and (c)
population-based variations across gender, ethnicity, and achievement
level. Using our conceptual model, we examined adolescents' academic
psychosocial background, motivational system, and perceptions of
parents and peers as they relate to the course of substance use from age
14 to age 20 in a nationally representative sample, focusing on similarities
and differences as a function of gender, ethnicity, and eighth-grade
achievement level.
From a human ecological perspective, adolescents' problem behaviors
and attitudes are linked across multiple developmental contexts including
family, school, and peer settings (Brofenbrenner, 1979). Jessor and Jessor's
(1977) problem behavior theory suggests that such school-related
behaviors as acting out or skipping classes are likely to be related to
problem behaviors in other contexts such as using substances or other
delinquent acts. When students are not behaviorally or psychologically
engaged in the classroom, they tend to cut class, fail to complete their
362 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
schoolwork, and otherwise misbehave (Brophy, 1996; Steinberg, 1996). This
misbehavior may transfer to other settings and provide adolescents with
more opportunities to use substances. Beyond connections among
behaviors, Jessor and Jessor's theory also highlights how demographics,
motivation and belief structures, and students' perceptions of their peer and
family environments provide linkages among problem behaviors, creating
a web of beliefs and behaviors that extends across contexts. By focusing
only on academic and substance use problem behaviors, we may overlook
adolescents' academic beliefs and perceptions of their environment.
Figure 1 illustrates the conceptual model for the present study. The key
concepts are drawn from Jessor and Jessor's (1977) problem behavior
theory, including school problem behaviors, motivation and school
beliefs, perceived environment, and demographics. As shown in
Figure 1, academic beliefs and behaviors and demographics are expected
to be directly related to concurrent adolescent substance use as well as to
changes in substance use over time. Ethnicity, gender, and perceptions of
one's ability are associated both with how adolescents negotiate
developmental transitions and also with adolescents' decision-making
across contexts (Crockett, 1997; Maccoby, 1995; McLoyd, 1998; Wigfield,
1994); thus, one would expect these factors to moderate the extent to which
experiences and beliefs affect the course of change in substance use. In the

current model, we also examined how the direct effects of adolescents'
psychosocial background, motivational system, and perceived environ-
ment system on concurrent substance use and change in use over time are
moderated by adolescents' achievement level and gender and ethnicity
(see lighter dotted lines in Figure 1).
The model includes direct effects of academic achievement on
concurrent substance use and change in use over time, but not the direct
effects of substance use on achievement variables. This decision was based
on previous research indicating that academic achievement and other
academic variables (particularly grades) are stable during adolescence
(Bryant et al., 2000; Mounts & Steinberg, 1995; Osborne, 1997), that
academic difficulties typically occur before substance use initiation, and
that over time academic variables such as grades and school misbehavior
are more predictive of substance use than vice versa (Bryant et al., 2000).
To some extent, especially during high school, it is likely that adolescents'
academic beliefs and behaviors are reciprocally related to their beliefs and
behaviors regarding substance use. Nonetheless, it appears that the
preponderance of the influence works from academic variables to
substance use (Bryant et al., 2000; Schulenberg, Bachman, O'Malley, &
Johnston, 1994). Thus, the focus of the current article is on the impact of
adolescents' academic beliefs and behavior on concurrent substance use
and change in use over time. Such an analysis may help to clarify the role
that academics may play in preventing substance use increases over time.
The following sections summarize the research literature and expectations
for the current research based on the direct and interaction effects on
adolescents' substance use presented in Figure 1.
Academic Achievement
Many theories explaining substance use during adolescence, such as
family interaction theory (Brook, Whiteman, & Gordon, 1983), the social
development model (Hawkins & Weis, 1985), and problem behavior
theory (Jessor & Jessor, 1977), have associated adolescents' academic
achievement and skills with substance use (Petraitis et al., 1995). In
empirical studies, school failure has been well documented as a risk factor
for problem behaviors in general (Dryfoos, 1990) and for substance use
specifically (Bachman et al., 1981; Eccles, Lord, Roeser, Barber, &
Jozefowicz, 1997; Hawkins et al., 1992; Schulenberg et al., 1994; Smith &
Fogg, 1978). Relatively few studies, in comparison, have associated
adolescents' achievement levels with change in substance use over time
(for exceptions, see Bryant et al., 2000; Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002; Luthar
364 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
& Cushing, 1997). Consistent with previous research, we expect that
adolescents who report low academic achievement will report higher
concurrent use of substances and, to a lesser extent, increased substance
use over time. Some studies revealed links between academic achieve-
ment and change in substance use over time (e.g., Bryant et al., 2000;
Luthar & Cushing, 1997) whereas others have not (e.g., Bryant &
Zimmerman, 2002).
The direct effects of achievement on substance use may be moderated
by demographic factors. Previous studies have indicated that males and
Whites have higher rates of substance use compared with their adolescent
counterparts (Johnston et al., 2002) and that there are demographic
differences related to school failure as a risk factor for substance use.
Research suggests that White adolescents may be more vulnerable than
African American adolescents to the impact of school-related risk factors
on substance use (Wallace & Muroff, 2002). In general, girls report higher
grades than boys (Frome & Eccles, 1998), and low achievement seems to
affect girls more negatively than boys. Girls with low levels of academic
achievement are more at risk than boys with low levels of academic
achievement for psychological distress and low academic self-concept
(Frome & Eccles, 1998; Pomerantz, Altermatt, & Saxon, 2002), suggesting
that school failure may put girls at more risk than boys for problem
behaviors such as substance use. Thus, in the current research we expected
that low academic achievement would be a stronger risk factor for
substance use for White adolescents than for ethnic minority adolescents
and for girls than for boys.
Psychosocial Background
Problem behaviors such as psychological distress and a propensity to act
out and misbehave are likely to co-occur during adolescence (Jessor &
Jessor, 1977). A number of studies have linked truancy and psychological
distress with adolescent substance use and abuse (Dryfoos, 1990; Hawkins
et al., 1992; Newcomb & Bentler, 1989; Newcomb et al., 2002). Relatively
few studies, in comparison, have associated negative school behaviors and
psychological distress with change in substance use over time (for
exceptions, see Bryant et al., 2000; Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002; Luthar &
Cushing, 1997; Orlando, Ellickson, & Jinnett, 2001; Scheier, Botvin, Griffin, &
Diaz, 2000; Wills, Sandy, & Yaeger, 2002). Based on the findings from
these studies, we expected to find stronger positive associations between
school misbehavior and concurrent substance use, weaker positive
associations between loneliness and concurrent substance use, and
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 365
weaker positive associations between these two factors and change in
substance use over time.
Demographic and achievement differences may moderate the links
between psychosocial background and substance use. For example, with
respect to achievement differences and distress, research suggests that the
impact of self-esteem on substance use varies by achievement level (Eccles
et al., 1997). Regarding ethnicity and academic behaviors, research on
urban adolescents indicates that truancy is a risk factor for some
substances for African American adolescents and for other substances
for White adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002). Concerning gender
differences, females tend to report less school misbehavior and more
psychological distress than males, and truancy and problem behavior in
general appear to be less predictive of increased substance use for females
(Brunswick & Messeri, 1984; Bryant et al., 2000; Bryant & Zimmerman,
2002; Ge, Conger, & Elder, 2001; Windle, 1990); thus, we expected to find
these same differences in the current national study. Research on urban
adolescents also suggests that psychological distress as a risk factor for
substance use varies by both ethnicity and gender, although findings are
not always consistent: School stress has been identified as a risk factor for
concurrent substance use for females but not for males (Brunswick &
Messeri, 1984); for males but not for females (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002);
and for White, suburban females (not males) but not for urban males or
females who were predominantly African American or Hispanic (Way,
Stauber, Nakkula, & London, 1994). The present study allowed us to
consider these mixed findings regarding gender and ethnic differences as
well as achievement level differences in a nationally representative
sample.
Motivation and School Attitudes
Consistent with problem behavior theory, adolescents' beliefs about
school and their academic expectations appear to be related to problem
behaviors (Dryfoos, 1990; Hawkins et al., 1992), although, as we
mentioned earlier, there are some gaps in the research linking measures
of motivation and school attitudes to adolescents' involvement in
substance use. Youth with high levels of achievement motivation and
positive attitudes who report that they like and are interested in school
and have high self-perceptions of academic competence and academic
values are less likely to engage in substance use (Brook, Whiteman,
Gordon, & Cohen, 1986; Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002; Hawkins & Weis,
1985; Roeser, Eccles, & Freedman-Doan, 1999; Scheier & Botvin, 1998;
366 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
Smith & Fogg, 1978; Voelkl & Frone, 2000). Having high academic goals,
such as planning to graduate from college, is a protective factor associated
with less substance use among adolescents (Bachman et al., 1981;
Schulenberg et al., 1994). As is true for research on adolescents' school
behaviors, the research examining school beliefs and change in substance
use over the course of adolescence is limited. Adolescents' school beliefs
and motivation--including their perceptions of school importance, value
of school experiences, academic self-efficacy, school bonding, and college
plans--appear to be strongly associated with concurrent substance use,
but evidence is mixed about whether they are strongly associated with
change in substance use during high school (Bryant et al., 2000; Bryant &
Zimmerman, 2002). In the current study, we expected to find links
between motivation and concurrent substance use, and we considered the
mixed previous findings regarding change in substance use, as well.
Some research suggests that positive attitudes toward academics are
particularly protective against substance use for high-achieving students
compared with low-achieving students, indicating an interactive effect of
achievement (as included in Figure 1; Evans & Skager, 1992). It is likely
that it is the combination of high achievement, high motivation, and
positive attitudes that protects against increases in substance use over
time (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002). Generally, girls' academic self-
perceptions are lower than boys' self-perceptions, even though girls'
reports of achievement are higher (Frome & Eccles, 1998; Pomerantz et al.,
2002); therefore, gender differences may exist in the association between
motivational beliefs and substance use, as well. Positive school attitudes as
protective factors against substance use may be less important for African
American or other minority adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002).
Examining these interactive effects in a nationally representative sample
should help us to understand their meaning--we expected that measures
of achievement motivation would have greater association with substance
use for high-achieving youth, females, and White students than for their
peers.
Perceived Environment: Peer and Family Influences
Adolescents who have positive attitudes toward school and whose
parents and peers support their education are less likely to use substances
than are youth from less education-oriented environments. In general,
when parents are aware of and monitor their adolescents' daily activities,
adolescents are less likely to engage in problem behavior (Hawkins et al.,
1992; Pilgrim, Schulenberg, O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 2003); a key
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 367
aspect of parental monitoring is knowledge of and involvement with
adolescents' schoolwork (Adalbjarnardottir & Hafsteinsson, 2001; Chen,
Greenberger, Lester, Dong, & Guo, 1998; Kerr & Stattin, 2000). Compared
with nonusers' parents, parents of adolescents who use substances
monitor their schoolwork less and have fewer rules about how they
spend their time (Coombs & Paulson, 1988). Some research suggests that
although adolescents' perceptions of their families are important for
educational outcomes, perceptions of peers (peers' substance use, in
particular) may be more strongly associated with substance use outcomes
(Kandel & Andrews, 1987; Mounts & Steinberg, 1995; Steinberg, 1996).
Considerable research has shown that adolescents who use cigarettes,
alcohol, and marijuana are more likely to have friends who also use
substances (Hawkins et al., 1992), reflecting both selection and socializa-
tion effects (e.g., Kandel & Andrews, 1987; Newcomb & Bentler, 1989;
Schulenberg et al., 1999). Adolescents who perceive that their friends use
substances and skip school are more likely to use substances and
misbehave in school than students who perceive that fewer of their
friends are involved in deviant behaviors (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002;
Fuligni, Eccles, Barber, & Clements, 2001). A positive network of friends
who model and encourage positive behaviors can provide a shield against
risks for students who may be having trouble in school (Brown, Dolcini, &
Leventhal, 1997).
Regarding the relationship between adolescents' perceptions of parents
and peers and change in adolescents' substance use over time, recent
findings based on growth modeling analyses indicate that adolescents
who perceive that peers and parents are using fewer substances and that
their parents monitor their activities are less likely to increase their own
substance use over time (Barnes, Reifman, Farrell, & Dintcheff, 2000;
Curran, 2000; Curran, Stice, & Chassin, 1997; Wills, Sandy, Yaeger, &
Shinar, 2001). Much less is known about how adolescents' perceptions of
parental and peer attitudes and behaviors regarding academics are
associated with change in substance use over time. In the current research,
we expect, given previous findings, that adolescents' perceptions of peer
disapproval of misbehavior and approval of academic success will have
stronger negative effects on adolescent substance use and change in use
over time than adolescents' perceptions of parents' school help.
Research involving an urban sample of youth provides suggestions
regarding the interaction effects of academic achievement and demo-
graphics on perceived environment. The perception that friends believe
doing well in school is important may be particularly protective against
using alcohol and other substances for low-achieving students compared
with those who are doing better academically, and for African American
368 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
adolescents compared with White adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman,
2002). In addition, the social support from friends may be a more
important protective factor against substance use for girls than for boys
(Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002). Finally, research suggests that the negative
effects of peer pressure and the positive effects of parental monitoring
on adolescent substance use may be stronger for females than for
males (Farrell & White, 1998; Webb, Bray, Getz, & Adams, 2002). Research
on a nationally representative sample should help to clarify whether
these differences generalize beyond urban samples of adolescents--we
expected that peer effects would be stronger for low-achieving and female
adolescents, and that parent effects would also be stronger for females
than for males.
Overview
The main focus of this study was on links between youths' academic
experiences and their substance use over the course of adolescence. In
particular, we examined how academic experiences, attitudes, and
perceptions are related to changes in substance use in a nationally
representative panel of students followed from age 14 to age 20. The study
addressed the gaps in the existing research by linking motivation to
substance use, considering change in substance use over time, and
including a close examination of achievement and demographic differ-
ences in a nationally representative sample of adolescents. We sought to
describe and explain how initial levels of substance use and intraindivi-
dual changes in substance use are predicted by interindividual factors
(psychosocial, motivation, and perceived environmental variables) in the
total sample and as a function of ethnicity, gender, and level of academic
achievement. Growth curve analysis using hierarchical linear modeling
(HLM) is an advantageous strategy for examining this multilevel model in
which interindividual factors are included to predict differences among
individuals in their initial levels of substance use and rates of change in
use over time.
METHOD
This study used data from the Monitoring the Future project, an ongoing
study of adolescents and young adults (Johnston et al., 2002). The project
has surveyed nationally representative samples of 12th-grade students
(from the 48 contiguous United States) each year since 1975, using
questionnaires administered in classrooms. In 1991, the project was
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 369
expanded to include 8th- and 10th-grade students. Of the approximately
37,000 eighth-graders surveyed in 1991 and 1992, 2,000 individuals were
selected in each cohort for follow-up surveys by mail. Participants were
surveyed in school in eighth grade and then surveyed by mail biennially
for three additional time points (i.e., average ages 16, 18, and 20). Not all
students were 14 in eighth grade; thus, age was included as a predictor in
the models.
Sample
The final panel sample used for the analyses included 1,897 students from
two cohorts (1991 and 1992) of nationally representative samples.
(Corrective weights were used to adjust for the oversampling of
individuals estimated to be at high risk for school dropout in the panels
so that the samples best represent the original national samples.)
The original sample included 4,000 eighth-grade participants. There are
two forms of the questionnaire; based on within-classroom random
assignment, approximately half of the students completed one form
(n 5 1,975) and half completed the other form (n 5 2,025). Only students
who completed the first form were included in the present sample because
the variables of interest were only on this form.
Students were White (64.5%), African American (11.3%), Latino (9.1%),
or other minorities (15.1%). The sample is 51.8% female. On average,
participants reported that either their mother's or their father's highest
level of schooling was ``some college.'' Most youth came from two-parent
households (78.4%).
Because of the requirements of HLM, it is necessary to exclude
respondents who are missing data on any of the predictors; incomplete
data are permitted for dependent variables, although information is
required for at least one time point (see Table 1 for sample sizes for
dependent variables at each time point). Of the 1,975 respondents, 78 were
missing data on gender or ethnicity, and 661 were missing data on one or
more of the other eighth-grade predictors. (For numbers for each of the
predictors, see Table 2. Note that loneliness, peer support for misbehavior,
and status of academic success had sizeable missing data--these items
were on the last page of the questionnaire.) Rather than excluding a sizable
portion of the sample for the present HLM analyses, we imputed missing
data for all of the predictor variables except for gender and ethnicity.
Multiple imputation (MI) techniques provide methods for handling
missing data where m values are imputed for each missing variable to
complete the data (Rubin, 1987). In following standard procedures, MI
370 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
was performed for the predictor variables using multiple linear regression
plus a random component to produce the imputed values (missing value
analysis in SPSS 10.0 was used). Predictor variables used in the estimation
process included all of the eighth-grade data for each participant. Five
(m 5 5) imputed data sets were generated; the value of m 5 5 was chosen to
yield estimates that were approximately 95% efficient (Rubin, 1987;
Schafer & Graham, 2002).1 Separate HLM analyses were performed using
all five of the imputed data sets, and the HLM results represent the effect
sizes averaged across the five sets of estimates. We excluded students who
were missing gender or ethnicity information, bringing the final sample to
1,897 students (weighted N; unweighted N 5 1,891). T tests on all variables

of missing gender and ethnicity data (n 5 78; 3.9%) reported lower grades
at age 14 than adolescents who were included in the analyses (n 5 1,897);
no other significant differences were found.
Measures
Two levels are included in growth curve models. Level 1 represents
repeated measures that vary within the individual over time--in this case,
substance use. Level 2 represents factors that vary between individuals--
in this case, eighth-grade predictor variables that include demographic,
psychosocial background, motivation, and contextual factors.
Level 1--Intraindividual change. Means, standard deviations, and
skewness information for Level 1 substance use variables from age 14 to
age 20 are presented in Table 1. These measures, which have been used

Cigarette use. In each survey, respondents reported how frequently they
smoked cigarettes during the past 30 days; item responses ranged from 1
to 7 (1 5 not at all, 2 5 less than 1 cigarette per day, 3 5 1­5 cigarettes per
day, 4 5 about 1/2 pack per day, 5 5 about 1 pack per day, 6 5 about 1 1/2
packs per day, 7 5 2 or more packs per day).
Alcohol use. Respondents also reported how many occasions (if any)
they had alcoholic beverages to drink during the past 30 days. Item
responses ranged from 1 to 7 (1 5 0, 2 5 1­2, 3 5 3­5, 4 5 6­9, 5 5 10­19,

Marijuana use. Respondents reported how many occasions (if any) they
used marijuana or hashish during the last 30 days; item responses ranged
from 1 to 7. (Possible responses are the same as for alcohol use earlier.)
Adolescents' monthly substance use was measured every survey year
(ages 14, 16, 18, and 20). At age 14, among adolescents with valid data,
17.4% of the respondents reported that cigarette use, 26.7% reported
alcohol use, and 4.1% reported marijuana use during the previous
month. These measures, which have been used in national panel studies
for decades, have adequate psychometric properties (O'Malley, Bachman,
& Johnston, 1983).
Level 2--Interindividual factors. Means, standard deviations, and
scale information for Level 2 (individual) psychosocial background,
motivation factors, school attitudes, and perceived environment variables
are reported in Table 2. All variables were measured at eighth grade.
Ethnicity, gender, and age. Students reported their gender, a description
of their ethnicity, and their age in years. Possible ethnicity responses
were Native American or American Indian, Black or African American,
Mexican American or Chicano, Cuban American, Puerto Rican
American, Other Latin American, Oriental or Asian American, White or
Caucasian, or other. Groups used in the analyses included White
(comparison group), African American, Latino, and other (because of
the relatively small subsamples, all of the other minority students were
included in the other minority group for the analyses). Students reported
how old they were on their last birthday: 1 511 years old or less, 2 5 12
years old, 3 5 13 years old, 4 5 14 years old, 5 5 15 years old, 6 5 16 years
old, 7 5 17 years old, 8 5 18 years old or more; responses were recoded to
represent years of age.
Parental education. Participants reported the highest completed
level of schooling of their father and of their mother separately, and
the higher of the two was used in the analyses. Possible responses
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 373
included: 1 5 completed grade school or less, 2 5 some high school,
3 5 completed high school, 4 5 some college, 5 5 completed college,
6 5 graduate or professional school after college, 7 5 don't know or does
not apply (categorized as missing data).
Academic achievement. Academic achievement was measured by a
single item--youths' self-report of their average grade during the
previous year: 1 5 D and 9 5 A.
School misbehavior. This composite consisted of a mean of students'
standardized reports of school suspensions in their lifetime (3-point scale),
days of school skipped (7-point scale), and classes skipped (6-point scale)
during the previous 4 weeks, as well as reports of how often in the past
year respondents were sent to the office or had to stay after school because
they misbehaved (5-point scale; four items, Cronbach's alpha 5 0.66;
Bryant et al., 2000).
Loneliness. Students reported on a 5-point scale how much they agreed
or disagreed with two statements about loneliness (i.e., ``A lot of times I
feel lonely, I often feel left out of things''; Cronbach's alpha 5 .72;
Schulenberg, Wadsworth, O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 1996).
School interest. Students reported on a 5-point scale how often over the
previous year they found their course work interesting (one item).
Perceived school difficulty. Students reported on a 5-point scale how
often over the previous year they found their schoolwork too hard to
understand (one item).
Effort. Students reported on a 5-point scale how often over the previous
year they tried to do their best work in school (one item).
School bonding. Respondents indicated on a 5-point scale how much they
enjoyed, and how much they hated (reverse coded), being in school during
the previous year (two items, Cronbach's alpha50.77; Bryant et al., 2000).
College plans. Students reported on a 4-point scale how likely it is they
will graduate from college (four-year program; one item).
Parental school support. Respondents reported on a 4-point scale how
often their parents (or stepparents or guardians) check on whether they
have done their homework and provide help with their homework when it
is needed (two items, Cronbach alpha 5 0.83).
Peer support for school misbehavior. This was a composite of adolescents'
report of how they think most of the students in their classes would feel if
they (the respondents) cheated on a test or intentionally did things to make
the teacher angry (two items: 1 5 they would like it very much, 5 5 they
would dislike it very much; reversed coded) and how often they find that
their friends encourage them to do things that their teachers would not
like (one item: 1 5 never, 5 5 almost always; total of three items, Cronbach
alpha 5 0.51; Schulenberg et al., 1996).

Status of academic success at school. Respondents reported how im-
portant good grades and college plans are for being looked up to or having
high status at school (1 5 no importance, 5 5 very great importance; two
items, Cronbach's alpha 5 .83).
Data Analytic Approach
In HLM growth curve models, intraindividual factors (Level 1 factors) are
the occasions of measurement (Time 1, Time 2, etc.) nested within
individuals; interindividual factors (Level 2) are demographic, psychoso-
cial, motivational, and family and peers variables (Bryk & Raudenbush,
2002). At Level 1 in the current research, adolescent substance use was
included at ages 14, 16, 18, and 20 in addition to a linear component with
initial use at age 14 (eighth grade) as the intercept. At the interindividual
level (Level 2), demographic, psychosocial background, motivational, and
family and peer factors were entered to explain differences in adolescents'
substance use at age 14 (concurrent use), and rates of intraindividual
linear and quadratic change in substance use from ages 14 to 20. The linear
factor describes the linear growth in substance use, and the quadratic
factor describes acceleration in the rates of change. The growth models
were estimated separately for cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana using full
ML estimation in HLM. In the final set of analyses, interaction effects of
ethnicity, gender, and achievement level were examined. The interaction
models were estimated using full ML estimation including z-scored
predictors for noncategorical variables; consistent with standard practice
in the literature, all dummy variables (gender and ethnicity) were reco-
ded (­1,1), and interaction terms were created where each predictor
was multiplied in turn by ethnic minority status, then gender (e.g., Afri-
can American students 5 1, Whites 5 ­1; females 5 1, males 5 ­1), and
achievement status at age 14 (standardized age 14 academic achievement;
Aiken & West, 1991). Omnibus tests were performed to reduce the
probability of Type I errors. Details regarding the analyses are presented in
the Appendix.
RESULTS
Unconditional Model (Average Growth Models)
Results from the unconditional growth model for cigarettes, alcohol, and
marijuana are presented in Table 3 (described in Equations A1­A4 in the
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 375
Appendix). The results from the unconditional model indicated a
significant linear increase for all three substances and a significant
quadratic effect in rates for alcohol and marijuana use (see the mean

growth rates and mean acceleration in the fixed effects portion of
Table 3). The significant linear effect for all three substances was posi-
tive, indicating that adolescents, in general, increased their use over
time; the significant quadratic effect for alcohol was positive, indicating
an acceleration in the rate of increase over time; and the significant
quadratic effect for marijuana was negative, indicating a deceleration in
the rate of increase over time. The random effects portion of Table 3
indicates that adolescents differed significantly in their initial (age 14)
levels of cigarette and alcohol use (po.0001), that the rates of
linear increases in cigarette and marijuana use differed significantly
across individuals, and that acceleration in rates of alcohol use and
deceleration in rates of marijuana use differed across individuals.
Although 4.1% of the adolescents reported some use of marijuana
at age 14 (and the mean was significantly different from zero as indi-
cated in the top portion of Table 3), there was no significant variation
(p4.50) in the means on the 7-point scale. The reliabilities for
estimating the intercepts and slopes were acceptable, though not very
high, especially for the marijuana use intercept (whereas the relia-
bilities for estimating the linear and quadratic change rates of marij-
uana use were high). Reliabilities are typically lower when there is
less observed variance in the outcome across the sample (Bryk &
Raudenbush, 2002).
We considered the homogeneity of Level 1 variance, an assumption in
HLM, across the time points by modeling time as a predictor of the
common variance s2 (Bryk & Raudenbush, 2002; see the Appendix). We
found that time was not a predictor of Level 1 variance for alcohol use
(p 5 .86); time was related to Level 1 variance in cigarette use (po.01),
where planned contrasts revealed that the variance at the third and
second time points was less than the variance at the first time point
(po.001); and time was related to Level 1 variance in marijuana use
(po.001), where planned contrasts revealed that variance increased
significantly at every time point except between the third and fourth
time points (po.001).
Explaining Substance Use Differences
In the models of age 14 status and linear and quadratic change in
substance use, the intercepts (substance use at age 14) and slopes
(substance use linear and quadratic change rates) become out-
comes. The effect sizes associated with these results are presented in
Table 4 (results are based on averages across the m 5 5 imputed data

sets).2 (Note that because there was no significant variance in the
marijuana use intercept, alcohol use linear growth, and cigarette use
quadratic growth, the corresponding columns in Table 4 are blank.) Effect
sizes were calculated using the variances in initial statuses and growth
rates from the unconditional models (Raudenbush & Liu, 2001) from Table 3
(see Table 4 for details). Using the conventional guidelines suggested by
Cohen (1977), small effects are defined at 0.1, medium effects are defined
at 0.3, and large effects are defined at 0.5; however, Rosenthal, Roshow,
and Rubin (2000) warned against strict interpretation of these definitions.
Cigarette use. Based on the model including all eighth-grade
predictors, and as indicated in the first column of Table 4, eighth-grade
(age 14) cigarette use was higher for females than for males, and higher for
White students than for African American and Latino students. In terms of
psychosocial background, eighth-grade cigarette use was higher for
students who reported lower academic achievement and higher school
misbehavior than their counterparts; likewise, regarding motivation and
school attitudes, cigarette use was higher for students who reported lower
levels of effort, school bonding, and college plans compared with their
counterparts. In terms of perceived environment, eighth-grade cigarette
use was higher among students who perceived that their peers would
support their school misbehavior than those who did not.
In regard to predicting variation in change in cigarette use over time, the
linear increase in cigarette use from age 14 to age 20 was greater for Whites
than for African Americans and Latinos, and was greater for those with
lower eighth-grade academic achievement.
Alcohol use. Based on the model including all eighth-grade
predictors, eighth-grade (age 14) alcohol use was higher for females
than for males, and higher for White students than for African American
students (see Table 4). Students who reported higher levels of school
misbehavior and lower levels of loneliness reported higher concurrent
eighth-grade alcohol use. In terms of motivation and school attitudes,
adolescents who reported lower levels of school interest and college plans
reported higher concurrent alcohol use in eighth grade compared with
2 Because the substance use was not normally distributed (see skewness and kurtosis in
Table 1), and because the measure of substance use in this study was not an equal unit scale,
multiple approaches were used to examine whether results were robust to assumption
violations. Results were similar when HLM analyses were performed where the substance use
variables were treated as ordinal (distances between the seven categories of use were permitted
different thresholds) and count data (using an overdispersed Poisson distribution). Details
regarding these analyses are available from the first author.

their counterparts. Regarding the perceived environment, students who
reported that their peers supported misbehavior and that they received
less school help from parents were more likely to report concurrent eighth-
grade alcohol use.
In terms of quadratic growth, females' rates of increase in alcohol use
showed less acceleration from age 14 to age 20 compared with males, and
African American adolescents' rates of increase in alcohol use also showed
less acceleration over this period compared with White students. With
regard to psychosocial background, for adolescents who reported more
school misbehavior, their rates of increase in alcohol use showed less
acceleration from age 14 to age 20 compared with adolescents who
reported less school misbehavior. At age 14, adolescents who reported
high school misbehavior were already using more alcohol than adoles-
cents who reported low misbehavior; therefore, their trajectory starts off
much higher and has a slower rate of increase. In contrast, adolescents
who reported higher3 college plans reported less alcohol use at age 14, but
their alcohol use rates accelerated quickly from age 14 to age 20 compared
with youth with lower college plans (see Figure 2). As Figure 2 indicates,
adolescents with college plans at age 14 actually were using more alcohol
by age 20 than their peers without college plans (it is likely that most of
these students were at age 20 in college where alcohol use is common; e.g.,
see O'Malley & Johnston, 2002; Schulenberg et al., 1994).
Marijuana use. The data in Table 4 indicate that, for linear growth in
the model including all eighth-grade predictors, females increased their
marijuana use more than males, and other minority students (not African
Americans or Latinos) increased their marijuana use less than White
students. In terms of psychosocial background, students who reported
higher levels of school misbehavior and lower levels of academic
achievement and loneliness increased their marijuana use more than
their counterparts. Adolescents who reported higher levels of school
difficulty in eighth grade increased their marijuana use less than those
who reported lower levels of school difficulty. In addition, adolescents
who reported that more friends condoned misbehavior in eighth grade
increased their marijuana use more than those who reported that their
friends condoned misbehavior less.
The quadratic results for marijuana use indicated that females
decelerated their rates of increase in marijuana use more than did males
during this period. Compared with White students, other minority

students increased their use less yet accelerated their use more from age 14
to age 20. In addition, low-achieving students increased their marijuana
use more than did high-achieving students, but their marijuana use rate
had more deceleration from age 14 to age 20 compared with high achievers
(see Figure 3). The findings for high-misbehaving students mirrored those
for low achievers: High-misbehaving students increased their use more

than that of low-misbehaving students during this period.
Interaction Effects of Ethnicity, Gender, and Achievement Level
In the substance use models with interaction terms, all of the ethnicity
(African American­White, Latino­White, other minority­White), gender
(female­male), and achievement level (high­low) interactions for each of
the predictor variables (psychosocial background, motivation, and
perceived environment factors) were included in a single model. Because
these models included 73 predictors to model both substance use at age 14
and rates of linear and quadratic change in substance use, the possibility of
making a Type I error was high. Thus, an omnibus test was performed for
the set of interactions as a whole for the intercept and each of the slopes
across each of the substances (with p set at .05); in addition, only
individual effects significant at the po.01 level were considered. The
omnibus test for all interactions (the null hypothesis was that no
interactions exist) was significant for the cigarette use intercept, w2(57) 5
111.37, po.0001, and for the linear slope, w2 (57) 5 76.73, po.05; was
significant for the alcohol use intercept, w2(57) 5 90.86, po.01, and
quadratic term, w2(57) 5 79.51, po.05; and was significant for the
marijuana use linear slope, w2(57) 5 79.70, po.05, but not for the marijuana
use quadratic term, w2(57) 5 73.95, p 5 .065.
For the cigarette use intercept (monthly cigarette use at age 14), two
interactions were significant at the po.01 level. As reported earlier, eighth-
grade school misbehavior was a risk factor for concurrent cigarette use,
but the significant interaction revealed that it was more of a risk factor for
Whites than for African American students (po.001). In addition, a gender
interaction revealed that high-achieving females use more cigarettes than
males in general and than low-achieving males (po.01). A Gender Â
Achievement interaction was also found for the linear slope, where low-
achieving girls use fewer cigarettes in eighth grade but increase their use
much more than boys or high-achieving girls over time (po.01; similar to
the quadratic effect described next for alcohol use and shown in Figure 4).
An Achievement Â School Misbehavior interaction revealed that having
high grades was protective only for students with low school misbehavior;
adolescents reporting high levels of misbehavior did not differ in their
marijuana use by achievement level (po.01; similar to the quadratic effect
described next for alcohol use and shown in Figure 5).
For the alcohol use intercept, two achievement interactions were found:
High levels of school bonding and college plans were actually risk factors
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 383
for adolescents who reported high grades but were more protective for
those who reported low grades (po.01). For the acceleration in alcohol
use from ages 14 to 20 (quadratic term), ethnicity and achievement
interactions were found. As noted previously, college plans at eighth
grade were associated with an acceleration in the rate of increase in alcohol
use; however, this risk factor held for White students but not for the other
minority group of adolescents (po.01). Although we found that females in

general showed less acceleration in the increase in their alcohol use over
time compared with males, the significant Gender Â Achievement Group
interaction revealed that this was not true for females with low academic
achievement (grade point average) at eighth grade; indeed, this group of
females was found to accelerate the most in their rate of alcohol use
increase compared with males and other females (po.001; see Figure 4).
Furthermore, although low school misbehavior at eighth grade was
associated with an acceleration in the rate of increase in alcohol use over
time (because of the associated relatively low intercept), this was true only
for students with low academic achievement (po.01; see Figure 5).
Regarding the linear slope of marijuana use, we found two interactions.
Although perceived school difficulty at eighth grade was an overall risk
factor for increased marijuana use over time, it was more so for other
minority students than for White students (po.01). Second, although
females tended to have greater increases in marijuana use over time
(compared with males), this was a particular tendency of females who
reported at eighth grade that they put higher effort into their schoolwork
(po.01). These results suggest that for females, putting effort into doing
their best work in school could be stressful, or it could be that both using
marijuana and reporting increased effort to do good work in school is
associated with social desirability for females.
DISCUSSION
Key challenges for advancing our understanding of difficulties during
adolescence concern how various domains of young peoples' lives
interrelate concurrently, how risk and protective factors unfold over time,
and how key formative experiences vary in their impact as a function of
demographic characteristics (Hawkins et al., 1992; Jessor, 1992; Mounts &
Steinberg, 1995; Schulenberg, Maggs, Steinman, & Zucker, 2001). Our
purpose in this study was to advance the understanding in these areas by
addressing three specific gaps in the literature: the lack of empirical
emphasis on (a) diverse indications of academic success and failure,
including motivation and school attitudes as well as students' perceptions
of the academic beliefs of parents and peers; (b) change in substance use
over multiple time points during adolescence; and (c) population-based
variations across gender, ethnicity, and achievement level.
This study provides new and needed evidence that school-related
factors beyond low academic achievement contribute to both concurrent
substance use and changes in substance use over time. As expected from
problem behavior theory, high levels of reported school misbehavior and

low levels of academic achievement early in adolescence were associated
with high concurrent cigarette use and increased cigarette and marijuana
use over time. These findings build on problem behavior theory in their
attention to the relation between problem behaviors rather than clustering
problem behaviors together (Jessor & Jessor, 1977). The study also
provides some support for including motivation and school attitudes in
current models regarding academics and substance use (e.g., Hawkins &
Weis, 1985; Voelkl & Frone, 2000). When adolescents reported higher
levels of school interest, school effort, school bonding, and college plans,
they were less likely to report concurrent cigarette and alcohol use. We
found evidence that Jessor and Jessor's (1977) perceived environment
factors likely play a part in the link between academic difficulties and
substance use. Adolescents' perceptions of their parents' provision of
school help and their peers' attitudes regarding misbehavior were
associated with concurrent substance use and change in use over time.
This helps to show that the perceived environment includes school
behaviors as well the substance use values and behaviors of parents and
peers, whose effects on adolescent substance use have been well
documented.
Although these results do not establish causal connections among these
expanded academic factors and substance use, they provide strong
support for models of problem behavior and of substance use prevention
that include consideration of adolescents' academic beliefs and behaviors.
Accounting for these different behavioral, motivational, and perceived
environment factors related to school may help us tap into the low school
engagement that Brophy (1996) and Steinberg (1996) have suggested
indicates a lack of structure in adolescents' lives. Adolescents with a
combination of negative school experiences and negative attitudes may
miss out on formative academic experiences in the classroom and, instead,
may affiliate with other delinquent peers and skip school. This lack of
structure and exposure to delinquent peers is likely to permeate multiple
contexts of development and be associated with increased substance use
and problem behavior (Jessor & Jessor, 1977; Larson, 2000).
We expand on previous research regarding academics and substance
use by providing information about how the different academic factors
were associated with change in substance use from early to late
adolescence. Notably, the patterns of change in substance use from age
14 to age 20 varied depending on the type of substance, yet similarities
could be identified in terms of predictors of change. Adolescents who
reported higher grades in early adolescence were less likely to increase
their cigarette and marijuana use over time. The study provided little
support, however, for the motivation variables as predictors of change in
386 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
substance use over the course of adolescence. This suggests that the
protective effects of enhanced achievement motivation and positive
school attitudes early in adolescence do not provide added value at the
end of and beyond high school, beyond their possible indirect contribu-
tion via early educational success. The context of substance use is altered
during these latter years, when more of the adolescents who were high
achievers in early adolescence may be using substances--particularly
alcohol and, to a lesser extent, marijuana. It may be that early experiences
of achievement and high levels of motivation are protective factors against
increased cigarette use over time but not as protective against alcohol and
marijuana use. Well-adjusted and motivated young adolescents may be
less inclined to initiate alcohol and marijuana use early but have the
potential to increase their alcohol and marijuana use at a faster rate during
the transition to the college years (Schulenberg & Maggs, 2002). Entering
college, for many adolescents, is associated with major developmental
transitions regarding social relationships with peers, contexts of social
interaction, and self-regulation and self-perceptions, all of which could
also be associated with alcohol use (Bachman, Wadsworth, O'Malley,
Johnston, & Schulenberg, 1997; Maggs, 1997; Schulenberg & Maggs, 2002).
In the nationally representative sample used here we found that the
results were generally, but not entirely, robust with respect to adolescents'
gender, ethnicity, or achievement level. The close attention to context,
however, emphasized by Steinberg, Darling, and Fletcher (1995), adds
depth to our understanding of the links between academics and substance
use and may provide information for more context-specific prevention
models. Some evidence indicated that school misbehavior was a risk
factor for concurrent cigarette use more for Whites than for African
American students, suggesting that school misbehavior and cigarette use
may have stronger associations in terms of problem behavior for White
youth, or that the contexts of use may be different for African American
and White adolescents (Bryant & Zimmerman, 2002; Wallace & Muroff,
2002). We also found that the protective effects of school attitudes vary by
achievement level, supporting some previous limited evidence (Bryant &
Zimmerman, 2002). College plans and bonding to school were more
protective in terms of concurrent alcohol use for adolescents reporting low
grades and more of a risk factor, even at eighth grade, for concurrent
alcohol use for students with higher grades. For youth who are having
difficulty in school, bonding to school and having plans for college may
compensate for the increased risk due to their school difficulties. In terms
of the high achievers, Evans and Skager's (1992) work also suggests that
academically successful substance users have high educational aspira-
tions during early adolescence. The gender differences indicated that
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 387
low-achieving girls, in particular, those who have difficulty in school, may
be at risk for increased cigarette, alcohol, and marijuana use over time.
This suggests that low-achieving girls may cope differently with school
stresses or difficulties or have different social supports or peer groups
compared with boys or high-achieving girls. Replicating some of the
subgroup findings from urban samples in the national sample, as well as
identifying additional subgroup differences, helps to validate the
inclusion and examination of contextual factors in models of substance
use etiology and prevention.
Similar to the findings regarding concurrent substance use, the results
regarding change in substance use were largely the same across ethnicity,
gender, and achievement level. The interactions regarding acceleration in
the alcohol use slope provide additional information vis-a
`-vis varying
levels of risk for alcohol use increases, particularly for low-achieving
students. Low-achieving females and low-achieving adolescents who
reported low school misbehavior also reported lower levels of alcohol at the
first wave, but both groups were more likely to increase their alcohol use at
faster rates over time. Together, these results suggest that although low
achievement may not be a salient marker for risky concurrent alcohol use
among young adolescents, it may indicate heightened risk for alcohol use
increases over time for females and for students who do not exhibit other
school problem behaviors. The ethnicity interactions brought to light the
fact that the risk for accelerated future alcohol use associated with having
high college plans discussed previously may not apply to students from
some ethnic minority groups (not African Americans or Latinos). Indeed,
having difficulty with school and low college plans are risk factors for these
other ethnic minority students for faster substance use increases over time.
Strengths and Limitations
Several strengths and limitations--including issues related to general-
izability, measurement, and longitudinal designs and methods--need to
be recognized in the current research. In the understanding of develop-
mental phenomena, large-scale longitudinal survey research can help
provide a needed emphasis on populations and important subgroups. The
current study involves a nationally representative sample of adolescents
from the United States, permitting conclusions to be generalizable across
this population and defined subgroups; furthermore, youth are followed
over multiple time points, permitting the consideration of trajectories of
substance use. The conclusions, however, must be considered in light of
missing data and attrition, a limitation ubiquitous to large-scale long-
388 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
itudinal studies. Youth who were missing substance use data at the last
time point were more likely to use substances earlier, resulting in less
variation in the outcome variables. Thus, the effects of predictors may, in
fact, be underestimated. In addition, the same model was used for the
missing data imputation as in the HLM data analysis. Although this is
standard procedure, using different multiple imputation models (for
example, using additional variables to predict missing values, but not
using those variables in the analysis) could conceivably strengthen the
HLM results and better meet the assumption of multiple imputation that
data are missing at random (Schafer & Graham, 2002).
Though extensive in scope, the study is limited to some degree by the
measurement of the predictors and of substance use. All of the measures are
based on adolescents' self-report and some are based on single-item
measurement. Including more reliable measures and additional informa-
tion from peers, parents, and teachers regarding the nature of adolescents'
experiences in peer, home, and school contexts would help us understand
school and substance use connections. Collecting substance use data more
frequently (rather than at 2-year intervals) would also help provide a
more accurate representation of substance use among youth during
adolescence.
Although we considered predictors of change in substance use over
time, we did not consider issues of causality or reciprocal effects. Many
aspects of adolescents' academic trajectories, including beliefs and
behaviors, have been established before eighth grade and may have
already contributed to and been affected by adolescents' behaviors and
beliefs about substance use before the study began. Nonetheless, we were
able to consider correlates of change in substance use over the course of
adolescence with some suggestions as to how these may be related to
adolescents' academic experiences and beliefs.
As suggested earlier, a major strength of the study is the longitudinal
design covering middle to late adolescence when extensive change in
substance use tends to occur. This research could be extended by
examining how change in, in addition to the static influences of, academic
experiences and beliefs relates to change in substance use over time. For
example, Hawkins, Guo, Hill, Battin-Pearson, and Abbott (2001) showed
how school bonding (which we found to be one of the more powerful
predictors of concurrent, but not change in, substance use) changes over
the course of adolescence, and it would be beneficial to see how these
various ``moving targets'' work together. Our study helps set the stage for
such future efforts by covering an extensive range of academic factors and
showing how these factors relate to substance use among adolescents in
the United States.
ACADEMICS AND ADOLESCENT SUBSTANCE USE 389
Implications
The results indicate that multiple dimensions of adolescents' academic
experiences, more than just school failure, relate to substance use and
change in substance use over time. Prevention implications from Hawkins
et al.'s (1992) review of the literature on risk and protective factors for
substance use included promoting academic achievement and commit-
ment to school. The findings presented here underscore those efforts and
further suggest that school misbehavior is a key risk for substance use, and
multiple dimensions of motivation and school support from parents and
peers are additional protective factors that may help promote positive
youth outcomes. The current findings expand on current research by
considering models of substance use change over time and draw attention
to the fact that risk factors for change in use over time may not be the same
as risk factors for concurrent use, particularly during times of multiple
developmental transitions (Schulenberg et al., 2001). Developmentally
appropriate interventions that target the needs of the different age levels
and groups may help youth negotiate transitions to high school or
college and avoid health risks (Schulenberg & Maggs, 2002). Preparing
youth before they make transitions can buffer them against social and
academic stressors they may face in the new school environments.
Targeting the school behavior and attitudes of adolescents and the
contexts of peers and family will also contribute to healthy outcomes for
adolescents and the reduction of problem behaviors. School-based
substance use prevention programs that have multiple targets and
multiple points of intervention are most likely to be effective (Botvin,
1996). The results support the enrichment of education, the improvement
of achievement (e.g., increased grades, graduation rates), and reduction of
school misbehavior and truancy as desirable outcomes of prevention
programs in schools.
Our results suggest that some risk and protective factors differ in their
salience depending on the substance, on whether we refer to concurrent
use or changes over time, and on the background characteristics of the
adolescents. The challenge, then, for researchers, prevention scientists,
and those interested in promoting healthy outcomes for youth is how to
design programs that best target these risk and protective factors for
vulnerable young people at developmentally appropriate times.
APPENDIX
Details regarding the hierarchical models are described as follows.
390 BRYANT, SCHULENBERG, O'MALLEY, BACHMAN, JOHNSTON
Models of Intraindividual Change (Level 1)
In the intraindividual change or Level 1 model, occasions of measurement
are nested within the individual. The following equation specifies the
growth model within students:
Yti
¼ 0i
þ 1i
ati
þ 2i
a2
ti
þ eti
ðA1Þ
where Yti
is the observed status (substance use) at time t for individual i;
0i
is the intercept (initial status at age 14) or the substance use of
individual i at ati
5 0; p1i
is the yearly rate of change in substance use for
individual i from age 14 to age 20; ati
is the linear term where 0 is age 14, 2 is
age 16, 4 is age 18, and 6 is age 20 (the same time interval is used for all
individuals); p2i
is the rate of acceleration in the change (or the curvature of
the change); and ati
2 is the quadratic term, which is the linear term
squared. Errors are represented by eti
with common variance s2; the
assumption of homogeneity of this variance at Level 1 (across the time
points) is described in the Results section.
Interindividual Models (Level 2)
The first step in a growth curve model is to estimate a Level 1
(intraindividual) model that is unconditional at Level 2 to examine
whether there are significant linear and quadratic increases in substance
use across all students (fixed effects), and whether students differ in their
initial status (p0i
) and their rates of change (p1i
, p2i
; random effects). These
unconditional models were estimated using full maximum likelihood
(ML) estimation in HLM for each of the substances (cigarettes, alcohol,
and marijuana) separately. In the interindividual level, or Level 2, model,
the growth parameters (p0i
, p1i
, p2i
) become outcomes modeled as a
function of student characteristics. In the unconditional model, no
individual-level predictors were included. That is,
0i

þ r0i
ðA2Þ
1i
¼ 1 0
þ r1i
ðA3Þ

þ r2i
ðA4Þ
where significant bs indicate that initial substance use (b0 0
) and linear
(b1 0
) and quadratic (b2 0
) increases in use are significantly greater than
zero. Significant between-student variance in r0i
, r1i
, and r2i
, the errors at
the individual level, indicates that students differ significantly in their
initial status and rates of change.

Individual-level predictors were introduced into the Level 2 models in
the next step, which was estimated using full ML estimation in HLM, to
model the significant variance in the intercepts (initial status at age 14) and
linear and quadratic slopes (rates of change and acceleration or
deceleration in rates of change between ages 14 and 20):

where the bs in Equation A5 represent the individual effects on initial (age

represent the individual effects on linear and quadratic rates of change in
substance use.
