Abstract
Objective: To analyze the effects of the acetabular fracture index (AFI) and other factors on the
functional outcome of patients with acetabular fractures involving the posterior wall.
Methods: Forty-eight patients who underwent surgery in our department were reviewed.
According to the AFI, which indicates the percentage of remaining intact posterior acetabular arc,
the patients were divided into Group A (AFI 25%, 11 patients), Group B (25% < AFI 50%,
23 patients), Group C (50% < AFI 75%, 7 patients), and Group D (75% < AFI 100%, 7 patients).
The AFI was measured with a computed tomography picture archiving and communication system
or calculated with the cosine theorem. A nonparametric test and ordinal regression were used to
determine the role of the AFI and other factors on the functional outcome. Perioperative
information, including demographic and fracture-related data, reduction quality, physical therapy
duration, association with a lower limb fracture and avascular necrosis of the femoral head were
prospectively gathered.
Results: The mean AFIs of A, B, C, and D groups were 14.3%, 35.9%, 59.5%, and 81.2%,
respectively. No statistically significant differences were observed among the groups for
demographic and fracture-related data. A better reduction quality (OR ¼ 4.21, 95%CI
1.42 $ 12.43, 2 ¼ 6.781, P ¼ 0.009) and a larger value of AFI (OR ¼ 2.56, 95%CI 1.18 $ 5.55,
2 ¼ 5.648, P ¼ 0.017) result in a higher functional score. The functional outcome of a physical
therapy duration of more than 12 months (OR ¼ 0.15, 95%CI 0.02 $ 0.90, 2 ¼ 4.324, P ¼ 0.038)
was better than that of less than 12 months. Lower limb fracture (OR ¼ 0.13, 95%CI 0.02 $ 0.74,
2 ¼ 5.235, P ¼ 0.022) and avascular necrosis of femoral head (OR ¼ 0.02, 95%CI 0.00 $ 0.87,
2 ¼ 4.127, P ¼ 0.042) were found to correlate with a lower functional score.

Conclusion: With a greater of AFI, the functional outcome score would be better. Other factors,
including reduction quality, physical therapy duration, association with a lower limb fracture, and
avascular necrosis of the femoral head, most likely also affect hip functional recovery.

Introduction
Fracture of the posterior acetabular wall
accounts for 47% of all acetabular fractures,
ranking as the most common type of
acetabular fracture.1 The combination of
anatomic reduction of the articular surface,
rigid internal fixation, and early mobiliza-
tion has become the gold standard since a
consensus on the operative treatment of
these fractures was established in 1993.2
The incidence of a final unsatisfactory out-
come of a posterior wall acetabular fracture
is reportedly as high as 30%.3
Several factors contribute to poor out-
comes of repair of posterior wall acetabular
fractures, including advanced age, severe
obesity, avascular necrosis, marginal impac-
tion, severe intra-articular comminuted frac-
ture, association with a posterior column
fracture, femoral head or neck fracture,
lower limb fracture, residual displacement
of >2 mm, and delay in reduction of the hip
for >12 hours.4­6 Computed tomography
(CT) is more sensitive than plain radio-
graphs for detecting comminution and def-
icits, loose fragments, marginal impaction,
and femoral head lesions.7­11 Appropriate
treatment is also affected by the CT find-
ings.12,13 The acetabular fracture index
(AFI), defined as the percentage of remain-
ing intact posterior acetabular arc as mea-
sured by CT, is used to determine hip
stability in patients with posterior wall
acetabular fracture.14 The AFI is an object-
ive index used to define the size of the
posterior wall fragment. It can be easily
attained from a CT scan and has obvious
superiority to subjective parameters such as
a large fragment, significant segment,
incompetent posterior wall, and hip stabil-
ity. The AFI is useful for preoperative and
intraoperative evaluation when open reduc-
tion or internal fixation is needed and for
predicting the prognosis of a posterior wall
acetabular fracture.12
Several studies have been performed to
evaluate the relationship between the AFI or
fragment size and the stability of the
hip,12,14,15 but few have determined the
role of the AFI in the postoperative func-
tional outcome in patients with posterior
wall acetabular fracture. The aim of this
retrospective case study was to determine
the inter-relationship of the AFI and other
factors with the functional outcome of
acetabular fractures involving the posterior
wall, including an isolated posterior wall
fracture, a posterior column fracture with an
associated posterior wall fracture, and a
transverse fracture with an associated pos-
terior wall fracture.
Patients and methods
Patients
A retrospective study was conducted on
52 patients presenting with an acetabular
fracture involving the posterior wall. All
patients underwent surgical treatment by the
corresponding author at the Traumatic
Orthopaedics Department of Xiangya
Hospital from June 2007 to October 2013.
Four patients were excluded: one because of
Long et al. 1395
total hip arthroplasty and three because of
unavailable CT images. Ultimately, 48
patients were included in the study.
Clinical data
Of these 48 patients, 41 were male (85.4%)
and 7 were females (14.6%), with a mean age
of 44.25 Æ 12.17 years (range, 16­73 years).
Twenty fractures were on the right side
(41.7%), 27 were on the left (56.2%), and 1
was bilateral (2.0%). The fracture etiologies
included traffic accidents (35 patients,
72.9%), falls from a height (7 patients,
14.6%), and crush injuries (6 patients,
12.5%). With respect to complications, 31
patients had hip dislocation (64.6%), 11 had
primary sciatic nerve injury (22.9%), 17 had
lower limb fracture (35.4%), 5 had brain
injury (10.4%), and 1 had iatrogenic sciatic
nerve injury (2.1%). The mean duration
from fracture to surgery was 9 days (range,
3­30 days). The average surgical duration
was 149.5 minutes (range, 75­360 minutes),
and the mean blood loss was 725 ml (range,
300­3300 ml). The average duration of phys-
ical therapy was 24 months (range, 6­68
months). Follow-up evaluations were per-
formed in our clinic at 2, 4, 6, 12, 24, and
36 months after surgery. Physical therapy,
such as lower extremity muscle activity
and continuous passive motion, was
encouraged in all patients. Some patients
came from rural areas and had no access to
a physical therapy center for physical
therapy. All patients were traced for
follow-up functional assessment. The qual-
ity of fracture reduction was evaluated
according to the Matta radiological scoring
system.16,17
On the CT image of the fractured side, we
selected the section that demonstrated the
largest amount of fractured posterior acet-
abulum (i.e., the smallest intact remaining
posterior acetabulum). In our patients, the
selected section was sometimes at the level of
the central acetabular fossa. A contralateral
section was selected and matched by com-
paring the sizes of the femoral heads and the
configuration of the femoral fovea, acetab-
ular fossa, and pelvis. These sections were
used for measurements.
AFI measurement
The AFI was defined as the percentage of
remaining intact posterior acetabular arc
(A).12 It is described by the following
relationship:
A ¼ 2pR Â a b
ð Þ=360
Furthermore,
AFI ¼ A a
ð Þ=A b
ð Þ ¼
2pR Â a=360
2pR Â b=360
Â 100 ¼
a
b
Â 100
where A is the acetabular arc, R is the
radius, a is the angle formed by the arc line
to the remaining intact posterior acetabular
margin on the fractured side, and b is the
angle formed by the arc line to the posterior
acetabular margin on the contralateral
normal side (Figure 1).
Two methods were used to measure a and
b: (1) For most patients whose CT scans
(Definition Syngo Somatom CT 2008G;
Siemens, Munich, Germany) were per-
formed in our hospital, we made direct
measurements with a CT picture archiving
and communication system (PACS) (DHC
Software Co., Ltd., Beijing, China). (2) For
two patients whose CT scans were per-
formed in other hospitals, we performed
calculations using the cosine theorem on
their CT films:

where L is the straight line created by the

acetabulum on the fractured side and
contralateral normal side (Figure 2).
For every patient, we repeated the meas-
urement using multiple CT image section
levels to ensure that the greatest percentage
of posterior wall fracture involvement was
identified. All measurements were repeated
three times by the same radiologic professor
and orthopedic professor to minimize
errors. The mean AFI for all patients was
40.96 Æ 22.82 (range, 0.00­85.90).
Grouping
The 48 patients were classified into the
following groups according to the
AFI: Group A (AFI 25%, 11 patients),
Group B (25% < AFI 50%, 23 patients),
Group C (50% < AFI 75%, 7 patients),
and Group D (75% < AFI 100%, 7
patients). The data regarding this subgroup
classification are shown in Table 1.
Implant selection
Different implants were used according
to the AFI and other factors of posterior
wall acetabular fracture. For an AFI of
25% to 75%, lag screws, neutralization
plates, and spring plates were used. For an
AFI of >75% or the presence of a large
articular defect in the posterior wall,
Figure 1. The center of the acetabular arc is marked, and the angles (a/b) were created from the remaining
intact posterior acetabulum on the fractured side and contralateral side.
Long et al. 1397
a gluteus medius pedicled greater trochanter
bone flap plus lag screws and neutralization
plates were used. Lag screws and neutral-
ization plates were used in 24 patients
(50.0%); lag screws, neutralization plates,
and spring plates were used in 14 patients
(29.2%); and a gluteus medius pedicled
greater trochanter bone flap plus lag screws
and neutralization plates were used in
4 patients (8.3%) to reconstruct the poster-
ior wall.18
Statistical analysis
EpiData 3.0 was used to establish a
database, and statistical analysis was per-
formed using SPSS 17.0 for Windows (SPSS
Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). Measurement data
are presented as mean Æ standard deviation,
median, semi-interquartile range, lower
(25th) quartile, and upper (75th) quartile.
Enumeration data are presented as percent-
ages or proportions. Two-sample t-tests
and rank-sum tests were used for compari-
sons among the groups. Single-factor
analysis was performed using two indepen-
dent-sample nonparametric tests or multiple
independent-sample nonparametric tests.
Because a variety of factors had
mutual interference and it was difficult to
assess the influence of each factor on the
functional outcome using single-factor
analysis, multiple-factor analyses were
also used. Multiple-factor analysis was
performed using ordinal regression. All
data were analyzed at a significance level
of P < 0.05. Complete statistical ana-
lysis was performed by a biostatistician
consultant.
Results
All patients underwent follow-up evalu-
ations at every time point. No serious peri-
operative complications were observed.
Only one patient had an iatrogenic sciatic
nerve injury. This patient was treated with
neurotrophic drugs for 3 months, and the
muscle strength and sensation were finally
completely restored to normal at the 1-year
follow-up visit. All fractures were com-
pletely united at the 4-month follow-up
visit, which was confirmed by radiologic
examination.

Twenty-nine (60.4%) patients achieved
anatomical reduction, 15 (31.3%) achieved
good reduction, and 4 (8.3%) achieved poor
reduction. Heterotopic ossification accord-
ing to the Brooker grading system was
observed in 11 (22.9%) patients with grade
I ossification, 5 (10.4%) with grade II, and 1
(2.1%) with grade III; 31 (64.6%) patients
had no heterotopic ossification. Two (4.2%)
patients had traumatic arthritis, and one
(2.1%) had necrosis of the femoral head.
The functional outcome according to the
modified Merle'd Aubigne and Postel hip
scoring system was excellent in 20 cases
(41.7%), good in 19 (39.6%), fair in 5
(10.4%), and poor in 4 (8.3%). The demo-
graphic and fracture-related data are shown

Long et al. 1399
Comparison among groups
No significant differences in demographic
and fracture-related data were observed
among the groups, including sex, age, com-
binations with dislocation, primary and
iatrogenic sciatic nerve injury, lower limb
fracture, brain injury, trauma-to-surgery
time, operation duration, blood loss, reduc-
tion quality, heterotopic ossification, trau-
matic arthritis, avascular necrosis of
the femoral head, and physical therapy
duration.
Single-factor analysis
Two independent-sample and multiple
independent-sample nonparametric tests
showed that the factors affecting functional
outcome were blood loss (P ¼ 0.024),
physical therapy duration (P ¼ 0.035),
reduction quality (P ¼ 0.001), and hetero-
topic ossification (P ¼ 0.042). Blood loss
of >1000 ml, physical therapy duration of
<1 year, poor reduction quality, and
heterotopic ossification were most likely to
impair the functional outcome. The results
of the single-factor analysis are shown in
Table 2.
Multiple-factor analysis
Ordinal regression showed that five factors
(AFI, reduction quality, association with
a lower limb fracture, physical therapy
duration, and avascular necrosis of the
femoral head) were associated with the
final functional outcome after surgery
(Table 3). A better reduction quality (odds
ratio [OR] ¼ 4.21, 95% confidence interval
[CI] ¼ 1.42 ­ 12.43, 2 ¼ 6.781, P ¼ 0.009)
and a larger AFI (OR ¼ 2.56, 95% CI ¼
1.18 ­ 5.55, 2 ¼ 5.648, P ¼ 0.017) resulted
in a higher functional score. The functional
outcome associated with a physical therapy
duration of >12 months (OR ¼ 0.15, 95%
CI¼ 0.02­ 0.90, 2 ¼ 4.324, P ¼ 0.038) was
better than that associated with a physical
therapy duration of <12 months. Lower limb
fracture (OR ¼ 0.13, 95% CI ¼ 0.02­ 0.74,
2 ¼ 5.235, P ¼ 0.022) and avascular necrosis
of the femoral head (OR ¼ 0.02, 95%
CI¼ 0.00­ 0.87, 2 ¼ 4.127, P ¼ 0.042) were
correlated with a lower functional score.
Discussion
Several methods can be used to measure the
size of posterior wall acetabular fracture
fragments. Keith et al.19 used CT scans to
measure the size of the remaining acetabular
depths at the level of the transverse slice
compared with the normal contralateral side
through the fovea of the femoral head in
adult cadavers. Moed et al.14 and Reagan
and Moed15 used the level of the transverse
slice through the greatest percentage of
posterior wall fracture involvement on CT
scans. Calkins et al.12 selected the section
containing the largest amount of fractured
posterior acetabulum on the CT scan using a
plastic template to mark the center of the
acetabular arc and a goniometer to measure
the acetabular arc angle. The straight line of
the posterior acetabulum was measured to
calculate the approximate AFI, which clo-
sely approximates the real AFI. In the
present study, this measurement was similar
to that described by Calkins et al.12 Several
modifications were performed to collect
higher-quality data. First, we used CT
PACS software to confirm the center of the
acetabular arc, draw the acetabular arc, and
measure the acetabular arc angle, which was
more convenient and precise than using a
plastic template and goniometer. Second, we
used the cosine theorem to calculate the
acetabular arc angle and the real AFI
instead of the approximate AFI.
With respect to the influence of the size of
the posterior wall acetabular fracture frag-
ment, some studies have focused on the
stability, articular contact area, and contact
stress of the hip, but few have disclosed the
relationship between the fragment size and

that fragments involving 25% of the acet-
abulum do not affect joint stability, while
fragments involving !50% can affect joint
stability. The stability of fragments invol-
ving 25% to 50% is determined by the
posterior capsule. Calkins et al.12 found
that all hips with <34% of the remaining
posterior acetabulum were unstable and that
hips with >55% were stable. Hips were
either stable or unstable between these
values. In the present study, we found that
the size of the posterior wall acetabular
fracture fragment could affect the hip joint
functional outcome. The functional out-
come score was better with a greater AFI.
Many factors other than the fracture frag-
ment size of the posterior wall affect the hip
joint functional outcome, including hip dis-
location, sciatic nerve injury, femoral head
injury or necrosis, reduction quality, trau-
matic arthritis, heterotopic ossification,
physical therapy, and others. Reduction
quality is considered to be an important
factor.21,22 Mears et al.23 showed that stable
anatomic reduction of most displaced acet-
abular fractures affords an optimal progno-
sis, especially in younger patients. In the
present study, we also found that the reduc-
tion quality significantly influenced the func-
tional outcome. Our study also showed that
the functional outcome was better with
a physical therapy duration of >12 than
<12 months. This result may be attributed
to the different medical conditions among
the 48 patients studied. Some patients came
from rural areas without any medical insur-
ance or access to a nearby physical therapy
center. The patient's economic capability is
another factor affecting systemic or long-
term postoperative physical therapy. Thus,
poor physical therapy conditions may result
in a poor functional outcome. Heterotopic
ossification is a very common postoperative
complication of acetabular fractures.24
A significant amount of ectopic bone could
result in a !20% loss of hip motion. The
iliofemoral surgical approach was found to
be highly correlated with ectopic bone for-
mation.25 Whether prophylactic indometh-
acin prevents heterotopic ossification is still
debated.26­28 In the present study, prophy-
lactic indomethacin was not used for all
patients. The incidence of heterotopic
ossification was 27.1% without severe het-
erotopic ossification that impaired hip
function.
The present study has some limitations.
The first is the relatively small sample size of
each group. The study included only one
patient with avascular necrosis of the fem-
oral head and two with traumatic arthritis;
therefore, valuable statistical results were
difficult to obtain. We plan to enlarge the
sample size in future research. Second, little
consideration was given to the effects of the
number, configuration, displacement, and
distribution of fracture fragments; multi-
fragmentary fracture pattern; marginal
impaction; intra-articular fragments; and
extension of the fracture into the weight-
bearing dome, all of which may affect the
stability of the weight-bearing area and the
clinical outcome.
In conclusion, a higher AFI is associated
with a better functional outcome score.
Other factors, including reduction quality,
physical therapy duration, association with
a lower limb fracture, and avascular necrosis
of the femoral head, are also likely to affect
hip functional recovery.
