Prevalence Of Selected
Employer Health
Insurance Purchasing
Strategies In 1997
How many employers are following the leaders' example?
by M. Susan Marquis and Stephen H. Long
ABSTRACT: This paper provides information about the nationwide prevalence
of selected employer health insurance purchasing strategies. These strategies
include raising the share of medical costs borne by employees; the use of
quality information in choosing which plans to offer; and direct contracting with
provider systems. The data are primarily from the 1997 Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation Employer Health Insurance Survey.
Observers of the employment-based health insurance
scene during the 1990s have remarked on the rapid transi-
tion of the employer's role from passive payer to active pur-
chaser. They cite innovative strategies adopted by leading employ-
ers to contain costs while maintaining or enhancing quality of care.
These practices have been labeled as "managed competition," "active
purchasing," "responsible purchasing," and "value purchasing."1
Strategies in the purchaser's tool kit include (1) offering a choice
of plans, with an emphasis on managed care; (2) sharing costs and
responsibility with employees, by benchmarking employer contri-
butions to the lowest-cost plan and through increased cost-sharing
amounts or reduced benefits; (3) measuring plans' quality of care
and using this information in decision making; (4) forming and
participating in purchasing coalitions; and (5) bypassing insurers
and health plans by contracting directly with provider systems.
Primarily using case-study methods, researchers have selected
and interviewed private corporations, purchasing coalitions, and
state governments representing the cutting edge of the field. This
work provides rich context and institutional detail; it also generates
hypotheses. However, the study cases may not represent the practices
of typical employer purchasers. Nationally representative data are re-
quired to find out if most other employers are following the leaders.

The purpose of this paper is to provide new national estimates of
the prevalence of selected employer health care purchasing strate-
gies. In previous work we examined managed competition and
pooled purchasing.2 Here we focus on three remaining topics: (1)
increasing employees' share of costs by reducing the scope or
breadth of benefits; (2) using quality information in choosing which
plans to offer; and (3) direct contracting with provider systems.
Before turning to our findings, we briefly summarize the previous
literature on each of these topics.
n Cost sharing. Citing numerous sources, Robert Kuttner con-
cluded that employers shifted health care cost increases to their
workers by incorporating financial inducements to choose em-
ployee-only as opposed to family coverage, increasing employee con-
tributions to premiums, capping coverage for special benefits, and
increasing deductibles or copayments.3
n Quality measures. Several recent studies have explored rates
of employers' use of quality measures in making purchasing
decisions, with quite different results. Judith Hibbard and others
found that about half of very large employers in four selected markets
use National Committee for Quality Assurance (NCQA) accredita-
tion, Health Plan Employer Data and Information Set (HEDIS) meas-
ures, and consumer satisfaction surveys in their purchasing
decisions.4 They found that employers whose workforce was spread
across more states were less likely than were those with more geo-
graphic concentration to use HEDIS and satisfaction surveys.
Jon Gabel and colleagues, however, found that only 5­11 percent
of large employers used quality information in their purchasing
decisions.5 Anthony Lo Sasso and others found that only a minority
of employers considered quality measures to be very important in
their purchasing decisions.6 They were considered more important
by large employers and members of purchasing alliances, but
counter to hypothesis, not by the self-insured.
n Direct contracting. Firms' directly contracting with provider
networks is viewed as a relatively rare practice, nationwide.7 How-
ever, a recent survey of business coalitions found that about one-
third negotiated directly with providers for their members, suggest-
ing that direct contracting may be more common among businesses
participating in pooled purchasing arrangements.8 The best-
documented example of direct contracting is the Buyers Health Care
Action Group in Minnesota. Tom Bodenheimer and Kip Sullivan
suggest that companies are most likely to contract directly alone if
they are located in markets with low managed care penetration.
Further, a firm is more likely to contract directly if its employees are
geographically concentrated in one or a few health care markets.9

Data And Methods
n Sample. Our data are primarily from the 1997 Robert Wood
Johnson Foundation (RWJF) Employer Health Insurance Survey,
which collected information from a national sample of 21,545 private
business establishments. The sample was drawn from the Dun's
Market Identifiers national census of employment establishments.
Establishments in the sixty communities followed by the RWJF's
Center for Studying Health System Change (HSC) Community
Tracking Study and in twelve states with significant small-group
insurance reforms were oversampled.10 Within geographic areas, the
samples were allocated to strata defined by the number of workers
at the establishment. We used sample weights to make estimates for
several different units of observation: all private employment estab-
lishments in the continental United States that had at least one
employee and that offered health insurance, all employees of such
establishments, and all enrollees in their employer plans.
Data were collected by computer-assisted telephone interviews
conducted with the person or persons most knowledgeable about
health benefits and firm and worker characteristics. The response
rate to the survey was 60 percent.
For our analysis of increasing employees' share of costs, we meas-
ure trends between 1993 and 1997. To make these estimates we
compare data from the 1997 RWJF survey to those from the Na-
tional Employer Health Insurance Survey (NEHIS). The NEHIS is a
national survey of 34,604 private employers, which collected infor-
mation about health insurance offerings in 1993. Our methods for
comparing these survey data are described elsewhere.11 (All differ-
ences that we cite in the text are statistically significant at p = .05.)
n Concepts and definitions. We used a number of specialized
concepts and definitions. We report the actuarial value of plan
benefits, measured as the expected plan benefit payments relative to
the expected total health expenditures for a standardized popula-
tion. Also, we examine actuarial values for two subpopulations:
health service users whose spending was below the median for all
users and those whose spending was above the median.
Our measures of patient cost sharing are the deductible and a
coinsurance rate. Deductible amounts for 1993 have been inflated to
1997 dollars for comparison with the RWJF data using the medical
care services component of the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for all
urban consumers (U.S. city average). Health plans use either dollar
copayment amounts or percentage coinsurance rates. Our survey
collected whichever approach was used for physician office visits.
To convert to a standard percentage scale, we divided the copay-
ments by a standard office visit price of $50.

We measure employee contribution rates for single and family
coverage. The NEHIS and RWJF surveys collected information
about employer and employee contributions for each plan offered.
Some employers offered coverage for special services, such as dental
care or prescription drugs, in plans that were separate from the
general medical plan. We constructed employee contributions for
the package of benefits held by enrollees by adding together the
contributions that were paid both for the general medical plan and
for any plans covering special services.
We explore whether employers considered quality information
when choosing which plans to offer to their employees. The 1997
survey collected these data only for establishments with 500 or more
employees. Respondents were asked if their organization consid-
ered the following: (1) plan accreditation by a national board or
commission, (2) the results of patient satisfaction surveys, and (3)
scores on a report card of selected outcomes, such as HEDIS meas-
ures. For this analysis we classify an employer as using quality infor-
mation if it used one or more of these measures.
For employers offering a self-insured plan, respondents were
asked, "Does your company or its administrative representative con-
tract directly with particular physician groups or hospitals to pro-
vide health care to employees?" We used these data to classify em-
ployers as engaging in direct contracting.
Although the sample and analysis unit is the establishment--a
physical location of business--for some analyses we categorized
establishments according to the size of the firm, which includes
employees at all locations nationwide. Insurance decisions typically
are made at a regional or national level for firms with several estab-
lishments. As a measure of the degree of a firm's operation in a single
health insurance market, we used the number of the firm's employ-
ees working in the same state as the sampled establishment, divided
by the number of the firm's employees nationwide.12
We classified employers as self-insured if they offered at least one
self-insured plan, based on the respondent's self-assessment.13 Sev-
eral other classifications were based on self-assessment, including
participation in a pooled purchasing arrangement and whether a
plan is a health maintenance organization (HMO), a preferred
provider organization (PPO), a point-of-service (POS) plan, or a
conventional indemnity plan.14
HMO penetration, measured for the sixty Community Tracking
Study sites, is based on tabulations from the employer survey data of
the share of employees enrolled in their employer's plan who were in
an HMO. It is defined as "low" if the community is in the bottom
quartile, "high" if in the top quartile, and "medium" otherwise.

Study Results
n Increasing employees' share of medical costs. One action an
employer could take to raise employees' costs is to tighten rules
governing which of them are eligible for coverage or how long they
must wait for benefits. But most discussions of employer strategies
to decrease their own costs focus on moves to create better incen-
tives for enrollees to engage in cost-conscious behavior. One strat-
egy is to reduce the value of plans, either by increasing patient
cost-sharing amounts or by reducing the number or breadth of cov-
ered benefits. An alternative is to increase the employees' share of
premiums. While this might be done across the board, the managed
competition approach calls for raising employee contributions most
for higher-cost plans to induce enrollment in lower-cost plans.
In contrast to Kuttner's conclusion, we find little evidence that
employees' share of medical costs increased over the 1993­1997 pe-
riod (Exhibit 1). Eligibility rules were quite stable, whether we con-
sider the minimum hours of work per week required for eligibility or
waiting periods from the date of employment.
Overall, the value of plans rose slightly. The expected share of
aggregate spending that would be covered for health plan enrollees
rose from 85 percent to 88 percent. However, this increase primarily
results from more generous coverage for large medical expenditures
in recent years. The expected reimbursement share of total spending
for persons with health care spending above the median rose from
86 percent to 89 percent as a consequence of lower out-of-pocket
maximums in PPO and indemnity plans (not shown).
Expected insurance payments for spending by health care users
whose expenditures were below the median, in contrast, remained
unchanged. This stability masks underlying changes in several di-
rections, however. As we have documented elsewhere, enrollees
shifted from indemnity plans to HMOs.15 The latter have lower cost
sharing and more generous expected benefits for small health ex-
penditures than other types of plans have. At the same time, cost
sharing for small expenditures in HMOs and PPOs increased over
the period, as seen by higher coinsurance rates in HMOs and by the
fall in the expected insurance reimbursement share for HMO and
PPO enrollees with low health care spending. For low-spending
HMO enrollees, the reimbursement share fell from 82 percent of
spending to 75 percent; for PPO enrollees, from 68 percent to 65
percent. Expected insurance payments for low-spending indemnity
plan enrollees, on the other hand, increased. With the vast shift
away from indemnity coverage that occurred, this perhaps indicates
that only the more generous indemnity plans continued to be chosen.
Benefit breadth also changed. For example, the percentage of en-

rollees covered for each of four special services--mental health, pre-
scription drugs, and dental and vision care--rose during the period,
contributing to higher plan benefit values (data not shown).16
Finally, employers did not make large net changes in workers'
contribution shares to premiums during the mid-1990s. Moreover,
the slight increase observed in Exhibit 1 does not appear to be the
result of a rush to adopt the managed competition­style incentives
of raising employee contributions for higher-cost plans. That is be-
cause few employers practiced managed competition, and others
were not moving in large numbers to adopt it.17
n Use of quality information. Nearly 60 percent of large em-
ployers said that they used information on quality of care when
choosing which health plans to offer their employees; the figure rises
to nearly 70 percent of those offering HMOs or POS plans, the types
for which quality information is most widely available (Exhibit 2).
These estimates are considerably higher than those from most pre-
vious studies. The comparison between studies is never exact, how-
ever. Other researchers have used slightly different measures of
quality information; some have asked only about situations where it
was deemed "very important" to decisions; or they have looked at
employers in a different size range. In an effort to limit our data to

match others' estimates as closely as possible, especially by compar-
ing employers of similar size and offering a similar range of plan
types, our estimates remain much higher than previous ones.
We find mixed evidence when exploring the hypotheses about
which employers were more likely to use quality information. Our
data show a positive relationship between firm size and the use of
quality information, consistent with previous studies (Exhibit 2).
They also show some support for the self-insurance hypothesis, at
least among employers offering an HMO or POS option. However,
they show a strong inverse relationship between using quality infor-
mation and participating in pooled purchasing. We do not find
support for the hypothesis advanced by Hibbard and others con-
cerning multistate location. Essentially the same share of employers
with half or more of their workers in-state reported using quality
information as did those with less than 10 percent of operations
in-state. Finally, we hypothesized that employers that shifted more
decision-making responsibility about insurance to their employees
would be less likely to use quality information than were employers
who assume a greater agency role. This is not borne out by the
relationship between offering a choice of plans and the use of quality
information. Employers offering a choice were more likely to take
quality information into account in selecting the menu of plans than
were employers offering only a single insurance plan.
n Direct contracting and carve-outs. Although only 5 percent
of establishments engaged in direct contracting, they accounted for
19 percent of employees; 15 percent of health plan enrollees were in a
direct-contract plan (Exhibit 3). This is because the likelihood of
direct contracting rises sharply at larger firms: One-fifth of estab-
lishments of firms with 500 or more employees reported that they
use direct contracting to arrange for at least one health plan.
The literature suggests several hypotheses about the types of em-
ployers that are more likely to engage in direct contracting--specifi-
cally, those in markets with little managed care, those participating
in purchasing pools, and those whose employees are geographically
concentrated. We found that large employers in markets with low
HMO penetration were about 1.5 times as likely to contract directly
as those in markets with high HMO penetration (Exhibit 3). The
data do not support the other two hypotheses, however.
We estimate that direct contracting is far more prevalent than is
commonly believed. Our respondents might have had other pur-
chasing arrangements in mind when they reported engaging in di-
rect contracting. They may have been referring to carve-out arrange-
ments for specialized benefits (for example, prescription drugs or
mental health care), rather than direct contracting for the full bene-

fit package. We asked a separate question about the practice of carv-
ing out a specialized benefit. About 60 percent of the establishments
reportingdirect contractingalso reported using carve-outs (Exhibit 3).
Unfortunately, our data do not permit us to distinguish between those
who do both and those who answered affirmatively to the direct-con-
tracting question (which came first in sequence) when the only direct
contracting they practice is through a carve-out.
Discussion
Most of the literature on employer health insurance purchasing
strategies has been based on case studies that focus on "pathfind-
ers"; unfortunately, it is difficult to tell how well-traveled these
pathways are by all employers. Our national survey data permit
estimates of the prevalence of these practices in 1997. In earlier
work, we have documented the widespread shift to managed care,

the limited adoption of managed competition principles, and mod-
est participation in purchasing pools among both small and large
employers. Here we find that increasing employees' share of medical
costs was not widely practiced, at least not during the mid-1990s. A
majority of large employers reported using quality information in
choosing which health plans to offer, considerably more than has
been reported previously. Finally, our respondents reported that
they engaged in direct contracting for health benefits far more often
than observers had guessed.
We have some cautionary notes about projecting these findings
to the future. The mid-1990s was a period of low health cost infla-
tion, and employers were moving rapidly toward managed care
plans as their main cost-control effort. Because most covered em-
ployees are now enrolled in managed care plans and because premi-
ums now seem to be increasing more rapidly, employers might move
to raise employees' share of costs in the near future. However, a
recent survey suggests that as of 2000, employers had shielded em-
ployees from premium increases.18 Our measure of using quality in-
formation comprises many types of quality measures and many lev-
els of intensity of use. Although we think that it shows more interest
in quality information than earlier studies have done, it does not say
how important this information was in the final health plan selec-
tion. Finally, our effort to measure direct contracting was, to our
knowledge, the first in an employer survey. Direct contracting is a
relatively recent practice and, therefore, subject to more ambiguity
of definition and name recognition.19
The health system trends we have identified deserve
continued monitoring. In the case of direct contracting, we
also encourage further efforts to define and measure the con-
cept. This is especially important in a dynamic health care system
where new arrangements among purchasers, insurers, third-party
administrators, and providers are constantly being developed.
