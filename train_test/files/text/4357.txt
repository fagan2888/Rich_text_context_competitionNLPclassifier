Abstract
People typically process information to confirm their prior held attitudes and stereotypes. As the
political relations between NATO and Russia have distinctively drifted apart in recent years, we
were interested in how far old-established color depictions referring to the Cold War's
demarcations (USSR ¼ red; NATO ¼ blue) might reinforce people's political perception of an
East versus West antagonism nowadays. Participants received a fabricated news article in which
both world powers were either depicted on a map as Russia ¼ red and NATO ¼ blue or vice versa
(Study 1). Testing a different sample in Study 2, we fully removed color assignments and used
hachured distinctions or no distinctions at all. We revealed that perceived political distance
between both sides increased particularly for participants with negative attitudes toward Russia,
but only when Russia was depicted in red. Thus, colors referring to the old-established Cold War
patterns can indeed shape the political perception and reinforce stereotypical East versus West
thinking.

From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the
Continent.

Although political systems and territorial boundaries have shifted since the seminal speech
by Winston Churchill, his words seem as topical as ever since the fall of the Iron Curtain

26 years ago. Along with the annexation of Crimea by the Russian Federation, threatening
East versus West depictions returned in common news coverage, often accompanied by
illustrations visualizing old-established Russia versus NATO stereotypes (referring to the
former USSR with red and to the NATO member states with blue; Gebauer, Raab, &
Carbon, 2016). In fact, research has shown that color can increase the perceived
polarization between Democrats and Republicans among the American electorate
(Rutchick, Smyth, & Konrath, 2009), and that subtle visual metaphors depicted on a map
can affect people's attitudes (Schoormans, Carbon, & Gattol, 2011).
In many real-world contexts, like when reading a newspaper or watching the newscast,
people do not process information in a neutral way; instead, they search for information
that confirms their prior held attitudes and stereotypes (Kruglanski, 2004), even affecting a
mental distance gap between East and West (Carbon & Leder, 2005). Following these ideas, we
aimed at investigating how far participants' perception--especially for those holding strong
attitudes against Russia--of the political relationship between Russia and the NATO members
might be affected by the mere visualization of the territories of both power blocks. In Study 1
(N ¼ 75; 39 male; Mage
¼ 23.1 years, SD ¼ 2.4), we implemented a map either visualizing the
typical colorization used during the Cold War, that is, Russian territory in red and NATO
territory in blue, or showing an inversed and thus atypical color assignment (Figure 1, left
column). In Study 2 (N ¼ 70; 43 female; Mage
¼ 23.7 years, SD ¼ 2.9), we removed the color
classifications and replaced them either with hachured distinctions or no graphical distinction
at all (Figure 1, right column). All participants were invited to read and to evaluate a fabricated
news article that was the same in both studies and conditions and only differed in the type of
map embedded. The text described the armament of Russia as well as of the NATO states in a
matter-of-fact style, with an equal amount of text for both sides. A pretest (N ¼ 20; 14 female;
Mage
¼ 28.2 years, SD ¼ 9.0) showed no significant difference between the level of induced
threat regarding the written description of Russia (M ¼ 3.30, SD ¼ 1.56) and the NATO
states (M ¼ 3.75, SD ¼ 1.55), F(1,19)¼ 1.03, p ¼ .324, Z2
p
¼ .05. Before reading the fabricated
news article, all participants in both studies, which were conducted simultaneously in July 2015
to ensure a maximum of comparability, were asked to rate on a 6-point semantic differential
``Who is to blame for the Ukraine Crisis?'' (NATO vs. Russia). Blame scores did not differ
significantly in any of the conditions used in Study 1 and Study 2, F(3,141)< 1, p ¼ .731,
2
p
¼ .009. After participants read the article, they were asked to rate the perceived political
distance between both power blocks using the following item: ``The political distance between
the NATO states and Russia seems extremely strong to me'' (1¼ strongly disagree, 7 ¼ strongly
agree). As a last step, all participants were debriefed in Study 1 as well as in Study 2.
In Study 1, regressing political distance scores onto map condition (Russia red vs. Russia
blue; dummy coded), blame assessments (continuous and centered), and their interaction
showed no main effect for map condition, b ¼ .12, SE ¼ .32, t(71) < 1, p ¼ .708, R2 ¼ .002, and
none for blame assessment, b ¼ .29, SE ¼ .20, t(71)¼ 1.43, p ¼ .157, R2 ¼ .069. The two-way
interaction, however, turned out to be significant, b ¼ 1.03, SE ¼ .34, t(71)¼ 2.59, p ¼ .012,
R2 ¼ .080 (Figure 1; bottom of left column). The interactions in Figure 1 are plotted at one
standard deviation above and below the centered mean of the blame assessment scores (Aiken
& West, 1991). Simple slope analysis revealed that blame assessments (Russia high) significantly
and positively predicted political distance scores in the Russia¼ red condition, b ¼ .81,
SE ¼ .23, t(71)¼ 3.46, p < .001, but not in the Russia¼ blue condition, b ¼ À.22, SE ¼ .32,
t(71) < 1, p ¼ .492. Additionally, among participants with high blame assessments toward
Russia, political distance scores were higher in the Russia¼ red condition, b ¼ 1.01, SE ¼ .77,
t(71) ¼ 2.14, p ¼ .036. There was no simple effect of condition, in contrast, among participants
with low blame assessments toward Russia, b ¼ À.76, SE ¼ .47, t(71) ¼ 1.63, p ¼ .108.

Study 2 showed that regressing political distance scores onto map condition (hachured vs.
plain gray; dummy coded), blame assessments (continuous and centered), and their
interaction revealed neither a main effect for map condition, b ¼ .09, SE ¼ .32, t(66) < 1,
p ¼ .792, R2 ¼ .001, nor for blame assessments, b ¼ .07, SE ¼ .17, t(66) < 1, p ¼ .661,
R2 ¼ .003, and additionally no interaction effect, b ¼ .08, SE ¼ .33, t(66) < 1, p ¼ .821,

Results indicate that colors depicting the old-established Cold War patterns can indeed
affect participants' political perception of an East versus West conflict that has come full
circle. Such color schemes can induce a higher perceived political distance, especially for
those who strongly blame Russia for this crisis. Thus, these depictions might not affect
people per se but can confirm and reinforce prior held attitudes--whether the strong effect
of the color red in our study can be attributed to a kind of red-negative-associations or
stereotypical red-Soviet Union-associations cannot fully be decided within the scope of the
current study; also note that although red ¼ negative stereotypes have been documented so
far, other authors also claim positive relations with the color and others fail to find any main
effect of red at all (Hesslinger, Goldbach, & Carbon, 2015). To create a better understanding
of colors and political thinking, future research might extend these findings to other
antagonistic country pairs (e.g., India and Pakistan1), where neither is associated with the
color red. However, our findings are a first step toward a fairly undiscovered field of
psychological research and are in accordance with former findings showing that prior
attitudes can bias information processing (Kruglanski, 2004) and mental representations
(Carbon & Leder, 2005; Hesslinger et al., 2015). Additionally, findings might help to better
understand the power of specific depictions in news coverage by applying these ideas to the
domain of color-induced stereotypes.
