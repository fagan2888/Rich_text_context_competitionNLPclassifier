Stereotypes of speech are important to study because they not
only describe how things are but also prescribe how things
should be in social interactions (Popp, Donovan, Crawford,
Marsh, & Peele, 2003). Stereotypes may actually prevent
effective communication between people (Biernat & Vescio,
1983; Hughes & Baldwin, 2002). Importantly, research has
indicated that when White women deviate from stereotypes
by speaking assertively, they may be judged negatively as a
result (Carli, 2001; Crawford, 1995). This phenomenon may
be particularly true for women in leadership positions because
they already face a trade-off between being perceived as like-
able or competent (Eagly & Karau, 2002). It is also likely that
this double bind exists for other stigmatized groups in the
workplace, such as ethnic minorities.
Previous studies have documented that gender and racial
stereotypes (specifically, stereotypes regarding African
Americans) include beliefs about communication style
(Edelsky, 1976; Hughes & Baldwin, 2002; Kramarae, 1981;
Lakoff, 1973; Leonard & Locke, 1993; Ogawa, 1971; Popp et
al., 2003; Rich, 1974; Siegler & Siegler, 1976). With only one
exception (Popp et al., 2003), however, studies have failed to
examine race and gender stereotypes about speech style in the
same study. This is problematic because research has found
that separate examination of race and gender categories can
lead to normative assumptions (Fiske, 1998; Hamilton, 1991).
More specifically, this research has found that when partici-
pants are not made explicitly aware of a target's gender or
race, they default to the categories of White and male.
In Popp et al.'s (2003) study, gender and race stereotypes
were jointly investigated by having White college students
categorize the speech style of a fictional Black male, Black
female, White male, or White female college student.
Participants rated targets' typical talk style using 31 bipolar
words and phrases (e.g., emotional­unemotional, articu-
late­inarticulate, soft­loud, active­passive). The results
indicated that Black people's speech, in general, was viewed
as more direct, less socially appropriate, more emotional,
less playful, and tending to be more dominant than White
people's speech. Women's speech was believed to be more
emotional and slightly less direct than men's speech. Thus,
gender and race affected perceptions of speech style. The
effects for race were stronger than those for gender.
However, the two variables did not interact, suggesting that
a target's communication style might be judged according to
whether race or gender is more salient in a particular situa-
tion. These findings are important not only in the context of
Popp et al.'s study but also in other areas where people
interact and communicate, such as the workplace.
Researchers have dedicated an increasing amount of study
to stigmatized groups, and how stigma is related to status and
hierarchy. Meta-analyses conducted by Davison and Burke
(2000) and Swim, Borgida, Maruyama, and Myers (1989)
have shown that women are stigmatized in the workplace

Communication Stereotypes and
Perceptions of Managers
Jessica H. Carlson1 and Mary Crawford2
Abstract
Previous research has documented that gender and racial stereotypes affect beliefs about communication style.This study
sought to investigate whether these stereotypes would be replicated in a sample of White working adults and whether
participants thought that a social skills training program that is usually targeted at women would have an impact on managerial
targets' speech.Results indicated that racial stereotypes were more salient than gender stereotypes,with participants viewing
White managers' speech as more socially appropriate and less emotional, but also as more dominant and articulate than
Black managers' speech. Participants also perceived female managers' speech as more emotional than male managers'. After
training, participants thought that men's and White managers' speech would become more emotional, despite the fact that
this training has been targeted specifically at female managers.Overall,our findings highlight the importance of examining race
and gender in evaluating managerial communication.

when they take on stereotypically male-dominated roles such
as being a leader. Manifestations of gender- and racial dis-
crimination in the workplace can be subtle but are important
to examine because they can have significant consequences.
Although women account for about 50% of managerial and
professional positions in organizations today, the percentage
of women in top managerial positions remains in the single
digits (Helfat, Harris, & Wolfson, 2006; Tyson, 2003).
Women hold only 15.2% of corporate officer jobs in Fortune
500 companies (Catalyst, 2008) and comprise only 1.8% of
CEOs in the Fortune 500 (Helfat et al., 2006). A similar situ-
ation exists for Black managers. Current statistics indicate
that Black men account for 2.9% of managers and officials,
whereas Black women account for 2% of the total number
(Nkomo & Cox, 1990). Moreover, women of color account
for only 3.2% of Fortune 500 corporate officers (Catalyst,
2008). Scholars have hypothesized that a "double stigma"
exists for women of color making it even more difficult for
them to obtain leadership positions in the workplace (Botsford
Morgan, Gilrane, McCausland, & King, 2011).
The goals of this study were twofold. First, we aimed to
replicate and extend Popp et al.'s (2003) study of communi-
cation stereotypes by using the same design but using a
sample of working adults rather than the college students
used in the original study, and by changing the targets to
White male, White female, Black male, and Black female
managers. Our second goal was to examine whether partici-
pants drew upon communication stereotypes in assessing
the effects of a social skills training program on the com-
munication style and managerial effectiveness of targets.
Theoretical Underpinnings for the Stigma
of Female and Minority Leaders
The social stigma of female leaders can be explained by role
congruity theory, which is based on social role theory, and
the stereotype fit hypothesis. The former posits that the
social role of being "feminine" is incongruent with the social
role of being a "leader," which occurs because people
observe men in management roles and then correlate the
characteristics of men with the definition of an effective
leader (Eagly & Karau, 2002). In support of this assertion,
Eagly and Karau (2002) also found that female managers are
seen as effective when characteristics such as cooperation or
affiliation are required, a situation in which there is per-
ceived congruence between the two roles. However, Eagly,
Makhijani, and Klonsky (1992) found that women who lead
in an autocratic, stereotypically masculine way are evaluated
negatively. This role incongruity results in three main conse-
quences for women in management: They are evaluated less
favorably than comparable men, they have more difficulty
becoming leaders than men, and they are not recognized as
being as effective as men (Eagly & Karau, 2002).
Heilman's (2001) concept of stereotype fit leads to a com-
parable hypothesis, which can help to explain the manager-
as-White stereotype. The thinking here is that stereotypes of
managers and ethnic minorities might not coincide, or "fit"
with one another. In support of this hypothesis, Tomkiwicz,
Brenner, and Adeyemi-Bello (1998) found that participants'
ratings of Whites and managers were significantly corre-
lated, whereas the relationship between perceptions of
Blacks and managers were not. In other words, they found
that managers were judged to have attributes more typically
associated with Whites than Blacks. Moreover, there is a
relatively large body of literature documenting Black­White
differentials in performance appraisals. These findings were
confirmed in Roth, Huffcut, and Bobko's (2003) meta-anal-
ysis, which found that Whites were rated more highly than
Blacks on objective performance measures. Similarly, Cox
and Nkomo (1986) used the performance appraisal ratings of
125 first-level managers to investigate the extent to which
criteria for Black and White managers differed. They found
that social-behavioral factors were more strongly correlated
with the job performance of Black managers. Finally,
Greenhaus, Parasuraman, and Wormley (1990) found that
Black managers felt less accepted in their organizations,
received lower performance and promotion ratings from
supervisors, and had a lower amount of career satisfaction,
as compared with White managers.
Gender and Racial Stereotypes of Speech
There is a generally held belief that women and men speak
differently (Crawford, 1995, 2001), and these communica-
tion styles are very often portrayed as dichotomous. Lakoff
(1975) identified a cluster of speech features that she believed
constituted a distinctive "women's language" style convey-
ing hesitancy and powerlessness. Tannen (1990) theorized
that girls and boys learn different communication styles from
early childhood, and characterized their speech as "report
talk" (for men) and "rapport talk" (for women). Mulac and
his colleagues have conducted an extensive research program
aimed at uncovering gendered speech features (Mulac,
2006). Researchers have looked for sex differences in emo-
tional communication (Guerrero, Jones, & Boburka, 2006),
instigating and detecting deception (Burgoon, Blair, Buller,
& Tilley, 2006), supportive talk (Burleson & Kunkel, 2006),
and many other features and types of speech style. It is only
recently that the search for sex differences has been put in a
larger context of differences and similarities (Dindia &
Canary, 2006) and considered from a social constructionist
perspective (Crawford & Kaufman, 2006).
Overall, research from the 1970s onward has found that
men's speech is stereotyped as articulate, forceful, aggres-
sive, dominating, and blunt, whereas women's speech is
characterized as polite, emotional, talkative, gentle, and
lacking in humor (Crawford, 2003; Crawford & Gressley,
1991; Edelsky, 1976; Kramarae, 1981; Lakoff, 1973;
Siegler & Siegler, 1976; Spender, 1979). Recent research
confirms that these stereotypes remain as social prescrip-
tions: Speakers still are sanctioned for violating gendered
conversational expectations. In other words, to be
Carlson and Crawford 3
considered socially appropriate, speakers should adhere to
gender-based norms (Carli, 2001; Lindsey & Zakahi, 2006;
Palomares, 2009).
Similarly, research indicates that Black people's speech
is stereotyped as loud and aggressive (Hughes & Baldwin,
2002; Leonard & Locke, 1993; Ogawa, 1971; Popp et al.,
2003). The little empirical research that has been done in
this area indicates that White participants typically rate
Black people's speech as being more emotional, aggressive,
talkative, straightforward, and argumentative--in sum, less
socially appropriate (Leonard & Locke, 1993; Niemann,
Jennings, Rozelle, Baxter, & Sullivan, 1994; Ogawa, 1971).
Leonard and Locke's (1993) research indicates that racial
stereotypes of speech may also be dichotomous in nature.
When asked to describe the speech of White people and
Black people on a 21-item adjective checklist, their partici-
pants differentiated between Whites and Blacks on 18 of the
21 adjectives.
Gender, Race, and Managerial
Effectiveness Interventions
Solutions to the lack of parity in management would require
change at many levels; however, most interventions, have
focused on the individual level, and most have focused on
women, implicitly on White women. These change efforts
assume that women are in need of compensatory training.
Examples include assertiveness training programs, special
courses designed for women in management, and self-help
books that provide tips on getting ahead in corporate America
(e.g., Frankel, 2004; Heim & Golant, 1992; Hollands, 2002;
White, 1995). A large amount of self-help literature in the
1970s and 1980s was directed at women in an effort to
increase their assertiveness--the underlying message being
that women should stop being doormats and stand up for
themselves (e.g., Bloom, Coburn, & Perlman, 1975).
In recent years, however, there has been a growing back-
lash which recommends training in the opposite direction,
suggesting that women are too assertive or even aggressive.
For example, Hollands's (2002) Same Game Different
Rules: How to Get Ahead Without Being a Bully Broad, Ice
Queen, or "Ms. Understood" offers management strategies
to female managers and executives. Her self-improvement
strategies include using a softer voice, adopting a submis-
sive body language, smiling when speaking, dressing less
"militantly," learning to apologize more, even disparaging
oneself and affecting a stammer to appear less threatening
to others. These strategies prescribe many of the same
behaviors that the assertiveness training of the 1970s and
1980s sought to eliminate. Indeed, the executive Bully
Boss training program (GLC website, n.d.-a) can be thought
of as "anti-assertiveness" training.
As Ashcraft and Allen (2003) pointed out, organizational
communication scholars have focused increasingly on how
organizations are gendered, yet ignored the ways in which
they are raced. Allen (2007) argued that research has drawn
from and circulated "White universalistic paradigms
without problematizing or even acknowledging Eurocentric
limits . . . [and that] . . . this bias impedes our discipline from
effecting social change related to race" (p. 259). Although
Hollands's (2002) intervention is particular to women, it can
be argued that the same type of self-help strategies might be
perceived as improving all nonnormative groups as stereo-
types of these groups'communication styles do not coincide
with White men's.
There are numerous problems with individualistic
approaches to gender and racial inequalities in the work-
place. First, they ignore important interactional and social
structural level changes that need to be made for women and
ethnic minorities to achieve equality in management.
Second, they are implicitly White and do not encompass
diversity. Finally, they create double bind situations for
women and ethnic minorities in management. More specifi-
cally, they create a trade-off between perceived competence
and perceived likeability. Individual-level interventions are
particularly troublesome given that reviews of gender and
assertiveness show few gender differences and that these
differences are even smaller in African American popula-
tions than White (Carli, 2001; Crawford, 1995).
In this study, Hollands's (2002) self-help "Bully Broad"
intervention was made gender neutral ("Bully Boss") and
used as stimulus material that participants evaluated. The
theoretical rationale for using this particular intervention
was that it contained self-help advice for female managers
in particular. Furthermore, after reviewing the most recent
self-help literature geared toward managers, this interven-
tion was one of the more publicized, as evidenced by
frequent appearances in the media, and was even the basis
for the plot in one episode of the television show Ally
McBeal (http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Silicon+Valley+
Author+Jean+Hollands+Appears+on+Oxygen+Network's
. . . -a093259822). Finally, this intervention uniquely lent
itself to our purposes because it was not only a self-help text
but also a program to which companies could pay to send
their employees, thus creating a "training" intervention that
could be evaluated by participants.
In sum, we know that there are stereotypes about women
and men's communication styles; more specifically, that men
tend to be dominant and forceful, whereas women tend to be
soft and polite. These stereotypes may be weaker than in the
past, but they are still there (Popp et al., 2003). We also know
that there are stereotypes about African Americans' commu-
nication style, for example, being loud and inappropriate,
and these stereotypes may be quite strong (Popp et al., 2003).
However, we do not know much about how these gender and
racial stereotypes interact, how general they are, how they
extend to targets other than college students, or how they
affect perceptions of competence and effectiveness. This
study replicates and extends previous research by (a) exam-
ining gender and racial speech stereotypes of managers from
4 SAGE Open
the perspective of working adults, (b) jointly studying gen-
der and race, and (c) investigating the perceived effect of a
female-targeted social skills training on White male, White
female, Black male, and Black female managers' communi-
cation style and managerial effectiveness.
Hypotheses
Based on our review of the relevant literature, the following
hypotheses were generated:
Hypothesis 1: It was expected that pre-training com-
munication style stereotypes of race would rep-
licate those found in Popp et al.'s (2003) study,
specifically that Black targets would be rated as
more dominant and emotional, and less socially
appropriate than White targets.
Hypothesis 2: We hypothesized that female manag-
ers may be stereotyped differently than in Popp et
al.'s (2003) study due to their higher status position,
such that a "Bully Broad" stereotype might emerge
which would counter traditional stereotypes of
women (i.e., female managers may be perceived as
more dominant, and less socially appropriate than
their male counterparts).
Hypothesis 3: Regarding communication effective-
ness, it was expected that nonnormative groups'
(e.g., Black and female) speech would be perceived
as improving more than the normative groups (e.g.,
White and male) as a result of "Bully Boss" training
because they are perceived to need it more.
Hypothesis 4: In line with expectations about changes
in communication style, it was also predicted
that nonnormative groups would be perceived as
improving in terms of their managerial effective-
ness as a result of the training, whereas normative
groups would be viewed as unchanged or nega-
tively affected by the training.
Hypothesis 5: Finally, it was expected that, when rat-
ing nonnormative groups, participants would be
more in favor of company policies that give access
to or require "Bully Boss" training.
Method
Participants
Participants were working adults who were recruited by
students in undergraduate psychology courses as part of an
extra credit assignment. Students were instructed to recruit
participants who were currently employed full-time, to tar-
get as many different fields of work as possible, and to
preserve anonymity by having participants seal their com-
pleted surveys in unmarked envelopes and send them
directly to the first author. Surveys were collected from 157
job incumbents. In all, 67 job titles were represented in the
sample. The most frequently occurring job titles were man-
ager (n = 21), administrative assistant (n = 12), teacher (n =
11), accountant (n = 5), and engineer (n = 5). Examples of
other titles included consultant, interior designer, social
worker, postal employee, firefighter, project analyst, nurse
practitioner, financial advisor, lawyer, and sales associate.
Participant ages ranged from 20 years to 73 years (M =
40.62, SD = 12.07). Education level ranged from 1 (some
high school) to 6 (graduate degree), M = 3.98, SD = 1.24.
Workforce tenure ranged from 1 to 55 years (M = 17.88, SD
= 12.12). Fifty-five percent of the respondents were women,
84% were White or nonminority, 5% were Black/African
American, 3% were Hispanic/Latino/Latina, 7% were
Asian/Asian American, and 1% was Native American. As in
Popp et al. (2003), participants who did not self-identify as
White were removed for methodological and theoretical
reasons, yielding a final sample of 133 White participants,
including 71 women and 62 men.1
Procedure
Participants were told that they were taking part in a study
about management training. Modeling the procedure from
Popp et al.'s (2003) study, participants were randomly
assigned to one of four experimental conditions based on
the target's race and sex (i.e., White male manager, White
female manager, Black male manager, or Black female
manager) and were then asked to rate the average or typical
target group member's "usual everyday communication
style" on 31 bipolar items which ranged from 1 to 7. Some
example items are "sensitive­insensitive," "polite­impo-
lite," "strong­weak," "competent­incompetent." For exam-
ple, in the Black female condition,
Please rate the following adjectives on the extent to
which they reflect the usual, everyday communication
style of the typical Black female manager, boss and
executive on a scale from 1 to 7. We are asking for
your opinion about this group in general. Please
describe the average, or typical, Black female manag-
er's communication style in your ratings.
Each participant was then given a vignette to read
regarding "Bully Boss Syndrome" and its associated anti-
bully training, which was explained to be particularly use-
ful with their target's group (see the appendix for vignette;
the description was generated using phrasing and wording
from Hollands's [2002] book). The last sentence of the
vignette varied based on target group. For example, the last
line of the vignette in the Black female condition read as
follows:
This training has been found to be particularly useful
with Black female managers, bosses and executives.
Carlson and Crawford 5
Therefore, the remainder of these materials will focus
on Black women as participants.
Next, participants were asked to rate what effect they
believed this training would have on the typical target group
member's behaviors and outcomes on a scale ranging from 1
(very negative effect) to 5 (very positive effect). This scale
consisted of 10 items that were developed for this study:
"role as a leader," "role as coworker," "being liked," "ability
to get ahead (move up to a higher level of management) in a
company," "productivity," "effectiveness as a manager,"
"general job performance," "being taken seriously," "benefit
from the training," and "effectiveness in change (as a result
of training)." Cronbach's alpha for internal consistency
was .89.
Participants were also asked to indicate the extent to
which they agreed with four statements regarding organiza-
tional policies about the training, on a scale ranging from 1
(strongly disagree) to 7 (strongly agree). Again, these state-
ments were developed for this study and included "This
training program would be a waste of a company's Human
Resources budget," "There is no reason for companies to
provide this training as an employee benefit," "This training
would be useless in general (for any manager who took it),"
and "Companies should require this training." Cronbach's
alpha for internal consistency was .87.
Next, participants were presented with the same 31 bipo-
lar adjective items from the beginning of the survey, in a
different order, and were asked to rate the typical target
group member's communication style after participating in
"Bully Boss" training. Again, responses ranged from 1 to 7.
Speech items were combined using the factor structure in
Popp et al.'s (2003) study. In that study, the two strongest
factors were social appropriateness, consisting of 14 items
(e.g., sensitive, polite, pleasant, intelligent, warm, compe-
tent, inoffensive, soft, cooperative, does not interrupt), and
dominance, consisting of 7 items (e.g., strong, dominant,
active, self-assured, decisive). In this study, the alpha esti-
mates of internal consistency for social appropriateness and
dominance were .86 and .78, respectively. The other three
factors in Popp et al.'s study, which were directness, emo-
tionality, and playfulness, did not have high enough alphas to
create subscales in this study; thus, the single items "articu-
late," "emotional," and "humorous" were used instead.
Composite measures of social appropriateness and domi-
nance were formed by taking the mean of the relevant items.
Higher scores indicate more socially desirable speech char-
acteristics (i.e., high social appropriateness and low domi-
nance). Means were also used for the three single-item
measures, with higher scores indicating more articulate
speech, less emotional speech, and more humorous speech.
Finally, participants completed the Ambivalent Sexism
Inventory (ASI; Glick & Fiske, 1996), the Modern Racism
Scale (MRS; Swim, Aiken, Hall, & Hunter, 1995), and the
Motivation to Control Prejudice Reactions Scale (MCPRS;
Dunton & Fazio, 1997). The ASI is a 22-item measure that
assesses two components of sexism: hostile sexism and
benevolent sexism. Some example items include "Most
women interpret innocent remarks or acts as being sexist,"
and "Women seek to gain power by getting control over
men." The MRS is a 6-item measure that assesses modern, as
opposed to old-fashioned, racist beliefs. An example item is
"Over the past few years, the government and news media
have shown more respect to Blacks than they deserve."
Finally, the MCPRS is a 17-item measure of social desirabil-
ity in relation to individuals' attempt to control prejudiced
reactions. An example item is "I always express my thoughts
and feelings, regardless of how controversial they may be."
The alpha estimates of internal consistency for these three
scales were .80, .73, and .73, respectively.
Results
Managerial Speech Stereotypes
As modern racism, hostile sexism, motivation to reduce
prejudice reactions, and age were correlated with dependent
measures, they were used as control variables in this analy-
sis. Composite scores were analyzed using a 2 (target sex)
× 2 (target race) × 2 (participant sex) multivariate analysis
of covariance (MANOVA). The MANCOVA revealed a
significant main effect for target sex, F(5, 113) = 2.47, p <
.05, and for target race, F(5, 113) = 4.32, p < .01. No other
main effects or interactions were found. Given the overall
experiment-wise error protection of this procedure, it was
followed by five 2 (target sex) × 2 (target race) × 2 (par-
ticipant sex) univariate analyses of covariance (ANCOVAs)
--one for each of the five dependent measures.
Social Appropriateness
In support of Hypothesis 1, there was a significant main
effect for target race, F(1, 122) = 5.49, p < .05, 
p
2 = 0.04,
with White targets rated higher in social appropriateness (M
= 4.64, SD = 0.80) than Black targets (M = 4.31, SD = 0.73).
Dominance
This analysis also revealed a significant main effect for tar-
get race, F(1, 122) = 8.51, p < .01, 
p
2 = 0.07. However,
contrary to our prediction in Hypothesis 1, White targets
were rated as more dominant (M = 5.19, SD = 0.79) than
Black targets (M = 4.87, SD = 0.72).
Articulate
In this analysis, there was a significant main effect for target
race as well, F(1, 122) = 8.87, p < .01, 
p
2 = 0.07, with White
6 SAGE Open
targets perceived as more articulate (M = 5.41, SD = 1.03)
than Black targets (M = 4.67, SD = 1.24).
Emotional
This analysis revealed a significant main effect for target
sex, F(1, 122) = 4.16, p < .05, 
p
2 = 0.03, and for target
race, F(1, 122) = 10.37, p < .01, 
p
2 = 0.08, with women
and Black targets perceived as more emotional (M = 3.63,
SD = 1.24; M = 3.5, SD = 1.17) than men and White targets
(M = 3.99, SD = 1.22; M = 4.14, SD = 1.24). Higher scores
on this item indicate less emotional speech. These findings
support Hypothesis 1, which predicted that Black targets
would be perceived as more emotional than White targets,
but counter Hypothesis 2, which predicted that women
would be seen as less emotional than men.
Humorous
There were no significant main effects or interactions for
this dependent measure.
Effects of CommunicationTraining on
Managerial Speech Stereotypes
In examining the prediction that training would be differen-
tially effective or beneficial, a 2 (target sex) × 2 (target race)
× 2 (participant sex) × 10 (time) repeated-measures
MANCOVA was conducted. Dependent measures were the
two pre-training composite and three single-item scores
(ratings of the target before Bully Boss training), and the
two post-training composite and three single-item scores
(ratings of the target after Bully Boss training). Because
modern racism, benevolent and hostile sexism, motivation
to reduce prejudice reactions, and age were correlated with
the dependent variables, they were entered as covariates in
the analysis. The analysis revealed a significant interaction
for time × target sex, F(9, 107) = 2.00, p < .05, and for time
× target race, F(9, 107) = 1.94, p < .05. No other main
effects or interactions were found.
Given the overall experiment-wise error protection of
this procedure, it was followed by five 2 (target sex) × 2
(target race) × 2 (participant sex) repeated-measures uni-
variate ANCOVAs--one for each of the five dependent
measures. The analyses revealed a significant interaction
effect on the dependent measure "emotional" for time ×
target sex, F(1, 122) = 3.87, p < .05, 
p
2 = 0.03, and time ×
target race, F(1, 122) = 5.71, p < .05, 
p
2 = 0.05. More spe-
cifically, male targets were perceived as less emotional than
women before training (M = 3.99, SD = 1.22 vs. M = 3.63,
SD = 1.24), but were equal with women after training (male
M = 3.60, SD = 1.14 vs. female M = 3.66, SD = 1.22), t(131)
= 0.31, ns. Furthermore, White targets were perceived as
less emotional than Black targets before training (M = 4.14,
SD = 1.24 vs. M = 3.50, SD = 1.17) but were equal with
Blacks after training (White M = 3.63, SD = 1.27 vs. Black
M = 3.63, SD = 1.08), t(131) = -0.02, ns. These findings
contradict the predictions made in Hypothesis 3, where our
expectation was that nonnormative groups would be per-
ceived as changing more than normative groups. No signifi-
cant results were found on the other four dependent
measures.
Effect ofTraining on Perceptions of
Managerial Effectiveness and Company Policy
Opinions
In examining our prediction that training would differen-
tially affect perceptions of managerial outcomes, a univari-
ate ANCOVA was conducted on the composite score for
effectiveness. Benevolent sexism was added as a covariate
because it was correlated with the dependent measure.
The ANCOVA on perceptions of managerial effective-
ness revealed a significant interaction effect for target sex ×
participant sex, F(1, 123) = 7.48, p < .01, 
p
2 = 0.06, where
female participants gave higher effectiveness ratings to
female targets than to male targets (M = 4.08, SD = .70 vs.
M = 3.70, SD = .99), and male participants gave higher rat-
ings to male targets than to female targets (M = 3.82, SD =
.53 vs. M = 3.59, SD = .93). In general, participants thought
that the training would have a slightly positive effect on
managerial effectiveness for all targets, as evidenced by
means that are just above the scale's midpoint. No other sig-
nificant main effects or interactions were found for manage-
rial effectiveness.
In examining our prediction that training would differen-
tially affect participants' opinions of company policies, a
univariate ANOVA was conducted on the composite score
for policy opinions. No covariates were used in this analysis,
as none of the control measures were correlated with the
dependent variable. The analysis revealed no significant
main effects or interactions. Thus, Hypotheses 4 and 5 were
not supported.
Discussion
The goals of this study were twofold. First, we aimed to
investigate communication stereotypes about managers, and
we included both race and gender as target attributes.
Previous research had demonstrated communication stereo-
types about race and gender among college student samples
assessing student targets (Popp et al., 2003). However, our
search of the literature found no research assessing percep-
tions of the communication style of targets who were man-
agers. Research on the stigma of both gender and race in the
workplace has repeatedly shown that negative consequences
can occur for women and ethnic minorities in leadership
positions because of these stereotypes. Thus, we chose a
sample of working adults as the most relevant group in
Carlson and Crawford 7
which to assess such stereotypes. Assuming that we would
find evidence of communication stereotypes in this popula-
tion, our second goal was to examine whether participants
drew upon these stereotypes in assessing the effects of a
social skills training program on the communication style
and managerial effectiveness of targets. We discuss these
two aspects of our results in turn.
DoWorking Adults Hold Race- and Gender-Based
Stereotypes of Managers' Communication Style?
Overall, our results show a consistent pattern of stereo-
typical judgments based on race. Participants viewed the
communication style of White managers, female and male,
as more socially appropriate (polite, sensitive, coopera-
tive), dominant (decisive, self-assured, strong), articulate,
and less emotional, than the communication style of Black
managers. There were fewer results based on gender; how-
ever, women were perceived as more emotional than men.
These results can be compared with Popp et al.'s (2003)
research on communication stereotypes using college stu-
dent participants and targets. Popp et al. found that the
communication style of Blacks was seen not only as less
appropriate and more emotional but also as more direct.
They also found that gender stereotypes were minimal;
similarly, our results showed differences for target gender
only on the dependent measure of emotionality. Overall,
for college student and working adult participants, race
seems to be more salient than gender in evaluating others'
speech style.
What Are the Perceived Effects of
Communication SkillsTraining on Managers?
Next, we investigated working adults' perceptions of the
effects of a social skills training program on communication
style and managerial behaviors. Despite the fact that "Bully
Broad" training has been targeted specifically at female
managers, our participants thought that White and male par-
ticipants would be most affected by becoming more emo-
tional. Counter to our predictions about nonnormative
groups being perceived as needing to be "fixed" more than
normative groups, our results indicate that participants
thought the normative groups would benefit most from more
sensitive communication. One possible explanation for this
is that White and male managers are seen as having the most
power in the workplace and occupying the highest echelons
of organizations, and thus are perceived as having the most
potential for "bullying" behavior. Although research has
documented negative evaluations of women who deviate
from gender stereotypes in their speech, female (and Black)
managers were perceived to have more emotional speech
than White or male managers prior to training, which is
reflective of general race and gender stereotypes in society.
It appears that participants viewed the training program as a
way to equalize emotionality, bringing White and male man-
agers to the same level and Black and female managers.
Another interesting finding was that participants did not
think training would have much of an effect on managerial
effectiveness (M = 3.82 on a 5-point scale), although female
participants thought it would have more of an effect on
female targets, whereas male participants thought it would
have more of an effect on male targets. Participants did not
have strong feelings regarding whether training should be a
part of organizational policy (M = 4.42 on a 7-point scale).
Implications, Limitations, and Future Research
Since the 1970s, women have received conflicting mes-
sages about how to communicate effectively. In the 1970s
and 1980s, assertiveness training for women was a thera-
peutic fad (Crawford, 1995). More recently, the trend has
been to provide "anti-assertiveness" training, as in the Bully
Broad program. The recent backlash on assertiveness may
be detrimental to women attempting to climb the corporate
ladder because it suggests that, to be successful, they should
engage in behaviors that other working adults do not view
as particularly helpful, effective, or necessary. Despite the
large amount of publicity given to "Bully Broad" training
(GLC website, n.d.-b), it seems that our sample of working
adults did not perceive overly aggressive female managers
as a major workplace problem. Neither male nor female
managers were perceived as bullies; the ratings for both
groups were moderate. The selling of "Bully Broad" train-
ing to corporate human resources departments may depend
more on evoking outdated stereotypes of powerful women
than on any real need.
Overall, these findings point to the necessity of examin-
ing communication, race, and gender in a managerial con-
text. Importantly, our study examined race and gender
together. Being a member of a minority racial category and
being gendered female are sources of prejudice and discrimi-
nation in our society. Because the race and gender categories
are not often studied together, little is known about whether
the effects of membership in two stigmatized categories are
additive, multiplicative, or whether they might even cancel
each other out. In the study by Popp et al. (2003), the gender
and the race of a target influenced evaluations of the target's
communication style, but the effects were separate and non-
interacting. In our study, race proved more important than
gender with respect to initial stereotypes; however, gender
played a role in the evaluation of managerial effectiveness.
Although race and gender did not interact in this study, it is
still important to investigate both variables simultaneously
to better understand their relationship. Although scholars
have hypothesized that Black women will experience a dou-
ble disadvantage in leadership positions based on the dual
stigma of race and gender, recent research has shown that
this is not so clear. A recent study done by Livingston,
Rosette, and Washington (2012) indicated that the
8 SAGE Open
combination of two stigmatized categories may interact in
unexpected ways. In their experiment, the researchers found
that using a dominant leadership style had negative conse-
quences for White women and Black men, but not for Black
women. They hypothesized that double stigmatization put
Black women in a unique position, rendering them invisible
and affording them the opportunity to behave in a more
assertive way without penalty (even though penalties may
prevent them from becoming leaders in the first place).
One major limitation of this study was the use of an all-
White sample. It would be interesting to investigate the
effects of this research with a more diverse population that
would enable interaction effects to be examined. In addition,
it would be important to explore whether the differences
found in this study extend to other racial categories. Future
research should further investigate beliefs about racial differ-
ences in leadership style. The strong negative stereotypes of
African American communication style found in earlier
research with college students were not completely repli-
cated here. Nevertheless, Black managers were evaluated as
less socially appropriate, less articulate, and more emotional
than White managers. There is a need for more research on
racial stereotypes as expressed in beliefs about communica-
tion style. In particular, why are Black managers perceived
as communicating less appropriately? In addition, when and
how does managerial status override racial stereotypes about
communication?
Unlike race, gender was relatively unimportant in affect-
ing judgments about communication effectiveness. This
study underscores how much the beliefs about women's
communication skills (and by implication, their managerial
competence) have changed over the past decades. However,
it also suggests that beliefs about African Americans' lack of
social appropriateness may still undermine the effectiveness
of Black managers.
Appendix
ExampleVignette
How Not to Be a "Bully Boss"
An important part of management training is providing
executives with the skills to be effective communicators.
One new approach is the "Bully Boss Boot Camp," where
tough, direct, and successful executives are being enlisted by
their supervisors--said to be intimidated by their style--for
reprogramming to change their assertive ways and "tone it
down." This 3-month intensive "Bully Boss" program costs
up to US$20,000. Clients continue to meet as a group once
a month afterward for as long as they want. In this training
program, high-powered executives are told to ditch the hard-
ball stuff and relearn softer behavior and tactics. Participants
are told to let go of the idea of total control, to show others
that they are vulnerable by revealing their weaknesses, to
use a softer voice, to smile when they speak, to talk slowly
so that others can understand, and even to put themselves
down or to affect a stammer to appear less threatening to
others.
Here are some other pieces of advice that are given to
participants:
Adopt a submissive body language
Be more willing to listen
Learn to apologize more
Hesitate when speaking
Talk about your feelings
Dress less militantly
Wait until two or three people have spoken before
speaking
Adopt a more equivocal vocabulary (e.g., using more
phrases like "I don't know," "I'm not sure," and "I
guess")
This training also suggests that these managers walk
more slowly so that people do not feel bowled over. The
program is designed to help "Bully Bosses" to "fine tune"
the way they behave at work--It attempts to change the way
they communicate by helping them to adopt a gentler, less
abrasive management style. This training has been found to
be particularly useful with White male managers, bosses,
and executives. Therefore, the remainder of these materials
will focus on White men as participants.

Note
1. Only 16% of the sample identified an ethnicity other than
White. Of this amount, the highest group was Asian/Asian
American at 7%. As with Popp, Donovan, Crawford, Marsh,
and Peele (2003), it was therefore impossible to make mean-
ingful intergroup comparisons. Based on the theoretical and
methodological reasoning discussed in Popp et al., we also
decided to restrict our sample to White participants. However,
contrary to Popp et al., we found that 100% of participants
were able to identify the race and sex of the target during the
manipulation check; therefore, we did not need to exclude any
further participants from our analyses.
