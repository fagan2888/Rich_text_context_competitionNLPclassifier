Substantial increases in the relative and absolute number of older persons in our society
pose a challenge for biology, social and behavioral science, and medicine. Successful aging
is multidimensional, encompassing the avoidance of disease and disability, the
maintenance of high physical and cognitive function, and sustained engagement in social
and productive activities. Research has identified factors predictive of success in these
critical domains. The stage is set for intervention studies to enhance the proportion of our
population aging successfully.

Successful Aging1
John W. Rowe, MD2 and Robert L Kahn, PhD3
In an earlier article (Rowe & Kahn, 1987), we pro-
posed the distinction between usual and successful
aging as nonpathologic states. Our purpose in
doing so was to counteract the longstanding ten-
dency of gerontology to emphasize only the distinc-
tion between the pathologic and nonpathologic,
that is, between older people with diseases or dis-
abilities and those suffering from neither. The im-
plicit assumption of that earlier gerontology was
that, in the absence of disease and disability, other
age-related alterations in physical function (such as
increases in blood pressure and blood glucose) and
Cognitive function (such as modest memory impair-
ment) were "normal," determined by intrinsic aging
processes, primarily genetic, and not associated
with risk.
We hoped that the distinction between two
groups of nondiseased older persons -- usual (non-
pathologic but high risk) and successful (low risk and
high function) -- would help to correct those ten-
dencies, stimulate research on the criteria and deter-
minants of successful aging, and identify proper tar-
gets for interventions with "normal" elderly. In
recent years, "successful aging" has. become a famil-
iar term among gerontologists (Abeles, Gift, & Ory,
1994; Baltes & Baltes, 1990; Garfein & Herzog, 1995;
Hazzard, 1995) and a considerable body of research
has accumulated on its characteristics. Much of this

Research Network on Successful Aging. In this article
we summarize the central findings of that work, pro-
pose a conceptual framework for successful aging,
and consider some pathways or mechanisms that
make for successful old age.
Defining Successful Aging
We define successful aging as including three
main components: low probability of disease and
disease-related disability, high cognitive and physi-
cal functional capacity, and active engagement with
life. All three terms are relative and the relationship
among them (as seen in Figure 1) is to some extent
hierarchical. As the figure indicates, successful
aging is more than absence of disease, important
though that is, and more than the maintenance of
functional capacities, important as it is. Both are im-
portant components of successful aging, but it is
their combination with active engagement with life
that represents the concept of successful aging
most fully.
Each of the three components of successful aging
includes subparts. Low probability of disease refers
not only to absence or presence of disease itself,
but also to absence, presence, or severity of risk
factors for disease. High functional level includes
both physical and cognitive components. Physical
and cognitive capacities are potentials for activity;
they tell us what a person can do, not what he or
she does do. Successful aging goes beyond poten-
tial; it involves activity. While active engagement
with life takes many forms, we are most concerned
with two -- interpersonal relations and productive
activity. Interpersonal relations involve contacts and
transactions with others, exchange of information,

emotional support, and direct assistance. An activity
is productive if it creates societal value, whether or
not it is reimbursed. Thus, a person who cares for a
disabled family member or works as a volunteer in a
local church or hospital is being productive, al-
though unpaid (Herzog & Morgan, 1992).
Staying Healthy: Reducing Risk Factors for Disease
and Disability in Late Life
The concept of usual aging as a large subset of
those elderly previously considered to be "normal"
is depicted in Figure 2 (Rowe, 1990). The curve
farthest to the right, labeled "Death," displays the
1980 age-specific mortality experience of the United
States. The area to the left of the curve labeled
"Disability" estimates that portion of the population
without disability, and the envelope between the
Death and Disability curves denotes the disabled
population. The area to the left of the curve labeled
"Disease" represents the nondiseased, nondisabled
population. The final curve, labeled "Risk," esti-
mates the portion of the nondiseased population at
significant risk for developing disease. The increas-
ing dominance of this population with advancing
age reflects emergence of the "usual aging syn-
drome" associated with risk of chronic disease. The
area at the extreme left and bottom of the figure in-
cludes the nondiseased population at lowest risk,
i.e., those who are aging "successfully" with respect
to risk of emergence of disease. While the death,
disability, and disease curves traditionally originate
at 100%, i.e., with none of the population affected at
birth, the risk curve arbitrarily originates at 80% not

affected, to reflect the fact that many individuals
begin at risk, either because of genetic factors or the
psychosocial environment in which they are born.
Heritability, Lifestyle, and Age-related Risk
The previously held view that increased risk of
diseases and disability with advancing age results
from inevitable, intrinsic aging processes, for the
most part genetically determined, is inconsistent
with a rapidly developing body of information that
many usual aging characteristics are due to lifestyle
and other factors that may be age-related (i.e., they
increase with age) but are not age-dependent (not
caused by aging itself).
A major source of such information is the Swed-
ish Adoption/Twin Study of Aging (SATSA), a subset
of the Swedish National Twin Registry that includes
over 300 pairs of aging Swedish twins, mean age 66
years old, half of whom were reared together and
half who were reared apart. About one third are
monozygotic, while two thirds are dizygotic. Com-
parison of usual aging characteristics in twins of dif-
fering zygosity and rearing status enables estima-
tion of the relative contributions of heritable and
environmental influences.
SATSA-based studies have determined the heri-
tability coefficients (the proportion of total variance
attributable to genetic factors) for major risk factors
for cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease in
older persons. These are .66-.70 for body mass
index, .28-.78 for individual lipids (total cholesterol,
low- and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol,
apolipoproteins A-1 and B, and triglycerides), .44 for
systolic and .34 for diastolic blood pressure (Heller,
deFaire, Pedersen, Dahlen, & McClearn, 1993; Hong,
deFaire, Heller, McClearn, & Pedersen, 1994;
Stunkard, Harris, Pedersen, & McClearn, 1990).
Heritability trends across decades of advanced
age revealed a reduction in the heritability coeffi-
cients for apolipoprotein B and triglycerides (see
Figure 3) and for systolic blood pressure (.62 for
people under 65 years old and .12 for those over 65).

Consistent with these age-related reductions in her-
itability are mortality data from a 26-year follow-up
of the entire Swedish Twin Registry, 21,004 twins
born between 1886 and 1925 (Marenberg, Risch,
Berkman, Floderus, & deFaire, 1994). Among male
identical twins, the risk of death from coronary
heart disease (CHD) was eightfold greater for those
whose twin died before age 55 than for those
whose twin did not die before age 55, and among
male nonidentical twins the corresponding risk was
nearly four times greater. When one female identi-
cal twin died before the age of 65, the risk of death
for the other twin was 15 times greater than if one's
twin did not die before the age of 65, and 2.6 times
greater in the case of female nonidentical twins.
Overall, the magnitude of the risk associated with
one's twin dying of CHD decreased as the age at
which the twin died increased, independent of gen-
der and zygosity.
Beyond twin studies, other evidence indicates the
importance of lifestyle factors in the emergence of
risk in old age. For instance, advancing age is associ-
ated with progressive impairment in carbohydrate
tolerance, insufficient to meet diagnostic criteria for
diabetes mellitus but characterized by increases in
basal and post-glucose challenge levels of blood
sugar and insulin. The hyperglycemia of aging carries
increased risk for coronary heart disease (Donahue,
Abbott, Reed, & Yano, 1987) and stroke (Abbott,
1987), with progressive increases in the usual aging
range associated with increasing risk. Similarly, the
hyperinsulinemia associated with aging is an inde-
pendent risk factor for coronary heart disease (Fty-
orala, 1979; Foster, 1989). Several studies have now
demonstrated that the dominant determinants of this
risk are age-related but potentially avoidable factors,
such as the amount and distribution of body fat
(Elahi, Muller, Tzankoff, Andres, & Tobin, 1982; Kohrt,
Staten, Kirwan, Wojta, & Holloszy, 1990) and reduced
physical activity and dietary factors (Zavaroni et al.,
1986).
Substantial and growing evidence supports the
contention that established risk factors for the

emergence of diseases in older populations, such as
cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease, can be
substantially modified (Hazzard & Bierman, 1990;
Sticht & Hazzard, 1995). In a study demonstrating
the modifiability of "usual aging," Katzel and col-
leagues (Katzel, Bleecker, Colman, Rogus, & Sorkin,
1995) conducted a randomized, controlled, pro-
spective trial comparing the effects of a 9-month
diet-induced weight loss (approximately 10% of
body weight) to the effects of a constant-weight aer-
obic exercise program and a control program on a
well characterized group of middle-aged and older
men at risk for cardiovascular disease. The study
participants were nondiabetic and were obese
(body mass index 30 kg/m2), with increased waist-
hip ratios and modest increases in blood pressure,
blood glucose, insulin, and an atherogenic lipid
profile. Compared to controls, the reduced-energy
intake diet resulted in statistically significant reduc-
tions in weight, waist-hip ratio, fasting and post-
prandial glucose and insulin levels, blood pressure
and plasma levels of triglycerides, low-density
lipoprotein/cholesterol, and increases in high-den-
sity lipoprotein/cholesterol. While the older weight
loss subjects (over 60 years old) lost less weight
than the middle-aged subjects and had more mod-
est improvements in carbohydrate tolerance, they
participated fully in the reductions in other risk fac-
tors. In general, the weight loss intervention had
greater effects than the constant-weight aerobic ex-
ercise intervention.
Taken together, these reports reveal three consis-
tent findings. First, intrinsic factors alone, while
highly significant, do not dominate the determina-
tion of risk in advancing age. Extrinsic environmen-
tal factors, including elements of lifestyle, play a
very important role in determining risk for disease.
Second, with advancing age the relative contribu-
tion of genetic factors decreases and the force of
Vol. 37, No. 4,1997 435
nongenetic factors increases. Third, usual aging
characteristics are modifiable. These findings un-
derline the importance of environmental and be-
havioral factors in determining the risk of disease
late in life.
Intra-lndividual Variability: A Newly Identified
Risk Factor in Older Persons
The traditional repertoire of risk factors identified
in studies of young and middle-aged populations
may not include some additional risk factors unique
to, or more easily identified in, elderly populations.
In this regard, the MacArthur Foundation's Studies
of Successful Aging point to a previously unrecog-
nized risk factor -- altered within-individual vari-
ability in physiologic functions -- which may be im-
portant in determining the usual aging syndrome.
Most gerontological research, and indeed re-
search in all age groups, is not geared to the mea-
surement of short-term variations and changes.
Study designs generally focus on the absolute level
of a variable, perhaps comparing levels at two or
more time points that may be separated by months
or years. Nesselroade and colleagues (Kim, Nessel-
roade, & Featherman, 1996), reasoned that short-
term variability in a number of physiological or per-
haps psychological characteristics might reflect a
loss of underlying physiological reserve and repre-
sent a risk factor for emergence of disease or dis-
ability. To study the impact of short-term variability,
they examined between-person differences in simi-
larly aged residents of a retirement community.
They assessed various aspects of biomedical, cogni-
tive, and physical functioning every week for 25
weeks in a group of 31 individuals and a matched
group of 30 assessed only at the outset and the end
of the 25-week period, and they followed the sub-
jects for several years to ascertain the relationship
between within-person variability and its risk.
Within-person variability of a joint index of physi-
cal performance and physiological measures (gait,
balance, and blood pressure) was an excellent pre-
dictor of mortality five years later (R = 0.70, R2 =
0.49). Variability of the composite measure was a
better predictor of mortality than mean level, which
did not represent a statistically significant risk factor
(Nesselroade, Featherman, Agen, & Rowe, 1996). A
similar pattern of findings held for the psychologi-
cal attributes of perceived control and efficacy, for
which average level was not a significant predictor
of mortality but intra-individual variability scores
predicted 30% of the variance in mortality (Eizen-
man, Nesselroade, Featherman, & Rowe, in press).
It should be emphasized that some functions are
highly variable under normal conditions and others
much less so. The significant aspect of intra-individ-
ual variability as a potential measure of decreased
capacity and increased risk must be a change from
the normal variability, regardless of whether the
change is an increase or decrease. For example, a
decline in beat-to-beat variability in heart rate has
been shown to be a predictor of mortality in patients
who have previously suffered a myocardial infarc-
tion. While in the physiological measurement used
in this study, an increase in variability was associated
with increased risk; in other highly regulated sys-
tems, a decrease in variability may be detrimental
and represent decreased reserve and increased risk.
Maximizing Cognitive and Physical Function
in Late Life
A second essential component of successful
aging is maximization of functional status. One
common concern of older people relates to cogni-
tive function, especially learning and short-term
memory. Another functional area of major interest
is physical performance. Modest reductions in the
capacity to easily perform common physical func-
tions may prevent full participation in productive
and recreational activities of daily life.
The MacArthur Foundation Research Network on
Successful Aging conducted a longitudinal study of
older persons to identify those physical, psycholog-
ical, social, and biomedical characteristics predic-
tive of the maintenance of high function in late life.
The 1,189 subjects in this three-site longitudinal
study were 70-79 years old at initial evaluation and
were functionally in the upper one third of the gen-
eral aging population. Smaller age- and sex-
matched samples (80 subjects in the medium func-
tioning group and 82 subjects in the low functioning
group) were selected to represent the middle and
lowest tertiles. Initial data included detailed assess-
ments of physical and cognitive performance,
health status, and social and psychological charac-
teristics (the MacArthur battery), as well as the col-
lection of blood and urine samples. After a 2.0-2.5
year interval, 1,115 subjects were re-evaluated, pro-
viding a 91% follow-up rate for the study.
Predictors of Cognitive Function
Cognitive ability was assessed with neuropsycho-
logical tests of language, nonverbal memory, verbal
memory, conceptualization, and visual spatial abil-
ity. In the initially high functioning group, four
variables -- education, strenuous activity in and
around the home, peak pulmonary flow rate, and
self-efficacy -- were found to be direct predictors
of change or maintenance of cognitive function, to-
gether explaining 40% of the variance in cognitive
test performance. Education was the strongest pre-
dictor, with greater years of schooling increasing
the likelihood of maintaining high cognitive func-
tion (Albert et al., 1995). This finding is consistent
with several cross-sectional studies, which identify
education as a major protective factor against re-
ductions in cognitive function. Since all the subjects
had high cognitive function at first evaluation, it is
unlikely that the observed effect merely reflected
ability to perform well on cognitive tests or was the
result of individuals with greater innate intelligence
having received more education. Instead, the re-
sults suggest either or both of two explanatory
mechanisms: a direct beneficial effect of education
436 The Gerontologist
early in life on brain circuitry and function, and the
possibility that education is a proxy for life-long in-
tellectual activities (reading, crossword puzzles,
etc.) which might serve to maintain cognitive func-
tion late in life.
Pulmonary peak expiratory flow rate was the sec-
ond strongest predictor of maintenance of cogni-
tive function. In previous studies, this function was
a predictor of total and cardiovascular mortality and
a correlate of cognitive and physical function in el-
derly populations (Cook et al., 1989).
A surprising finding of this study was that the
amount of strenuous physical activity at and around
the home was an important predictor of maintain-
ing cognitive function. In a follow-up study to eval-
uate a possible mechanism of this effect, Neeper,
Gomez-Pinilla, Choi, and Cotman (1995) measured
the effect of exercise on central nervous system lev-
els of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in
adult rats. These investigators found that increasing
exercise was associated with very substantial "dose-
related" increases in BDNF in the hippocampus and
neocortex, brain areas known to be highly respon-
sive to environmental stimuli. These data provide a
potential mechanism whereby exercise might en-
hance central nervous system function, particularly
memory function.
A personality measure, perceived self-efficacy, was
also predictive of maintaining cognitive function in
old age. The concept of self-efficacy developed by
Bandura is defined as "people's beliefs in their capa-
bilities to organize and execute the courses of action
required to deal with prospective situations" (Ban-
dura, 1995). In students and young adults, self-effi-
cacy influences persistence in solving cognitive
problems (Brown & Inouye, 1978), heart rate during
performance of cognitive tasks (Bandura, Cioffi, Tay-
lor, & Brouillard, 1988), mathematical performance
(Collins, 1982), and mastery of computer software
procedures (Cist, Schwoerer, & Rosen, 1989). Lach-
man and colleagues have proposed a role for self-ef-
ficacy beliefs in maintenance of cognitive function
among older people (Lachman, & Leff, 1989; Lach-
man, Weaver, Bandura, Elliott, & Lewkowicz, 1992).
In addition to these findings of predictors of main-
tenance of cognitive function, evidence is accumulat-
ing to indicate that it can be enhanced in old age. For
example, older people who showed a clear age-
related pattern of decline in fluid intelligence (induc-
tive reasoning and spatial orientation) showed sub-
stantial improvement after five training sessions that
stressed ways of approaching such problems and
provided practice in solving them (Schaie & Willis,
1986). Moreover, repeated measurement indicated
that the improvements were maintained. Studies
from the Max Planck Institute in Berlin confirm the
finding that cognitive losses among healthy older
people are reversible by means of training, although
they also show a substantial age-related training ef-
fect in favor of younger subjects (Kliegl, Smith, &
Baltes, 1989). There is a double message in these
findings: first, and most important, the capacity for
positive change, sometimes called plasticity, persists
in old age; appropriate interventions can often bring
older people back to (or above) some earlier level of
function. Second, the same interventions may be still
more effective with younger subjects, which sug-
gests an age-related reduction in reserve functional
capacity. These demonstrations of plasticity in old
age are encouraging in their own right and tell us
that positive change is possible.
Predictors of Physical Function
In the MacArthur studies, maintenance of high
physical performance, including hand, trunk, and
lower extremity movements and integrated move-
ments of balance and gait, was predicted by both
socio-demographic and health status characteristics.
Being older and having an income of less than
$10,000 a year increased the likelihood of a decline
in physical performance, as did higher body mass
index (greater fat), high blood pressure, and lower
initial cognitive performance. Behavioral predictors
of maintenance of physical function included mod-
erate and/or strenuous leisure activity and emo-
tional support from family and friends. Moderate
levels of exercise activity (e.g., walking leisurely) ap-
peared in these studies to convey similar advantages
to more strenuous exercise (e.g., brisk walking).
Continuing Engagement with Life
The third component of successful aging, engage-
ment with life, has two major elements: mainte-
nance of interpersonal relations and of productive
activities.
Social Relations
At least since Durkheim's classic study of suicide
(Durkheim, 1951), isolation and lack of connected-
ness to others have been recognized as predictors
of morbidity and mortality. Five prospective studies
of substantial populations have now demonstrated
causality throughout the life course in such associa-
tions: being part of a social network is a significant
determinant of longevity, especially for men (see
Figure 4; House, Landis, & Umberson, 1988).
Research on the health protective aspect of net-
work membership has emphasized two kinds of
supportive transactions: socio-emotional (expres-
sions of affection, respect and the like) and instru-
mental (direct assistance, such as giving physical
help, doing chores, providing transportation, or giv-
ing money (Cassel, 1976; Cobb, 1976; House, Kahn,
McLeod, & Williams, 1985; Kahn, & Antonucci, 1981;
Kahn & Byosiere, 1992).
The three-community MacArthur study tested
both instrumental and emotional support as predic-
tors of neuroendocrine function and physical per-
formance. Neuroendocrine measures were also
studied as possible mediators of the effects of sup-
port. Over a three-year period, marital status (being
married), presumably a source of emotional sup-
port, protected against reduction in productive ac-
tivity (Glass, Seeman, Herzog, Kahn, & Berkman,
1995). Men with higher emotional support had sig-
Vol. 37, No. 4,1997 437
nificantly lower urine excretion of norepinephrine,
epinephrine, and cortisol, and for both men and
women, emotional support was a positive predictor
of physical performance. Instrumental support, on
the other hand, had few significant neuroendocrine
relations for men, none for women, and was associ-
ated with lower physical performance, probably as
an effect rather than a cause (Seeman, Berkman,
Blazer, & Rowe, 1994; Seeman, Berkman, Charpen-
tier, Blazer, Albert, & Tinetti, 1995).
These varying effects of social support are consis-
tent with research relating the effect of support to
the specific situation in which it is offered. For ex-
ample, instrumental support rather than emotional
support influenced the promptness with which
older people who experienced cancer-suspicious
symptoms actually saw a physician (Antonucci,
Kahn, & Akiyama, 1989). Opposite results came from
a nursing home experiment, however: socio-emo-
tional support (verbal encouragement) had positive
performance effects, whereas instrumental support
(direct assistance) had negative effects on perfor-
mance (Avorn & Langer, 1982).
Several conclusions seem warranted regarding
the properties of social relations and their effects:
a. Isolation (lack of social ties), is a risk factor for
health.
b. Social support, both emotional and instrumen-
tal, can have positive health-relevant effects.
c. No single type of support is uniformly effective;
effectiveness depends on the appropriateness
of the supportive acts to the requirements of
the situation and the person.
Productive Activities
Older people are not considered "old" by their
families and friends, nor do they think of themselves
as "old," so long as they remain active and produc-
tive in some meaningful sense (Kaufman, 1986). In
legislative policy, Congressional discussion as to
whether the nation can "afford" its older people is as
much a debate about their productivity as their re-
quirements for service, especially medical care.
Part of the confusion stems from lack of clarity
about what constitutes a productive activity. Our
national statistics define Gross Domestic Product
(GDP) in terms of activities that are paid for, and ex-
clude all unpaid activities, however valuable. Sev-
eral current studies (ACL, MacArthur, HRS) utilize a
broader definition that includes all activities, paid or
unpaid, that create goods or services of economic
value (Kahn, 1986), and these studies have gener-
ated age-related patterns very different from those
for paid employment alone (Herzog, Antonucci,
Jackson, Kahn, & Morgan, 1987; Herzog, Kahn, Mor-
gan, Jackson, & Antonucci, 1989).
The nationwide Americans Changing Lives (ACL)
study found that, contrary to the stereotype of un-
productive old age, most older people make pro-
ductive contributions of some kind, more as infor-
mal help-giving and unpaid volunteer work than
paid employment. When all forms of productive ac-
tivity are combined, the amount of work done by
older men and women is substantial. Among those
aged 60 or more, 39% reported at least 1500 hours
of productive activity during the preceding year;
41% reported 500-1499 hours, and 18% reported
1-499 hours. The relationship between age and pro-
ductive activity depends on the activity. While
hours of paid work drop sharply after age 55, hours
of volunteer work in organizations peak in the mid-
dle years (ages 35-55), and informal help to friends
and relatives peaks still later (ages 55-64) and re-
mains significant to age 75 and beyond.
Both the ACL and MacArthur studies address the
question of what factors enable sustained produc-
tivity in old age. Both include longitudinal as well as
cross-sectional data, and in some respects the stud-
ies are complementary -- national representative-
ness over the full adult age range in the ACL survey,
biomedical and performance measures as well as
self-report in the MacArthur research. Three factors
emerge as predictors of productive activity: func-
tional capacity, education, and self-efficacy.
Functional Capacity. -- Men and women high in
cognitive and physical function are three times as
likely to be doing some paid work and more than
twice as likely to be doing volunteer work. More-
over, for all forms of productive work except child
care, functional status also predicts the amount of
such work. Indicators of functional decrement, such
as limitations with vision and number of bed days
during the three months preceding the data collec-
tion, predict lesser productive activity.
Education. -- Educational level is a well established
predictor of sustained productive behavior, paid and
unpaid (Chambre, 1987; Cutler & Hendricks, 1990;
Harris & Associates, 1981; Herzog, Franks, Markus, &
Holmberg, 1996; Herzog & Morgan, 1993; Lawton,
1983; Morgan, 1986). The possible mechanisms of this
effect include the role of education as a major deter-
minant of occupation and income, both of which are
major influences on the life course, the selective pro-
cess in education that probably includes genetic
elements and certainly includes parental socioeco-
nomic status, and the tendency of education to incul-
cate values and establish habits that express them-
selves in later life as higher functional status and
engagement in productive behavior.
Self-Efficacy. -- Self-efficacy and the related con-
cepts of mastery and control are consistent predic-
tors of sustained activity in old age. The ACL study,
in addition to identifying a positive relationship be-
tween self-efficacy and productive activity, found
that two other variables, labeled vulnerability and
fatalism, essentially inversions of self-efficacy, were
negatively related to productivity. Consistent with
these findings, in the MacArthur sample only one
factor -- mastery -- emerged as relevant for both
increases and decreases in productivity; increases
in mastery led to increased productivity; decreases
in mastery had the opposite effect.
438 The Gerontologist
Response to Stress
If we had continuous rather than occasional mea-
surement of successful aging, we would expect to
find that even older people who are aging success-
fully have not met the criteria at every moment in
the past. They have moved "in and out of success/'
just as healthy people can be said to move in and
out of illness. Under the most fortunate circum-
stances, aging brings with it some repetitive experi-
ence of chronic or recurrent stresses, the "daily
hassles" of life (Lazarus & Folkman, 1984) and their
cumulative effects. Most older people have also ex-
perienced more acute episodes, the "stressful life
events" that have been much-studied (Dohrenwend
& Dohrenwend, 1974; Holmes & Rahe, 1967). For ex-
ample, older men and women may have been seri-
ously ill, temporarily disabled by accident or injury,
disoriented after a stroke, or depressed by the
death of a spouse. Apart from such crises of illness
and bereavement, but similarly stressful, are the ex-
periences of forced retirement, sudden reduction
in income, mugging, and burglary.
We propose the concept of resilience to describe
the rapidity and completeness with which people
recover from such episodes and return to meeting
the criteria of success. Determination of resilience
in dealing with a specific stressful event would re-
quire assessment of relevant functions before the
stressing challenge is encountered and subsequent
monitoring to observe the initial decremental ef-
fect, the time required to regain stability of func-
tion, and the level of function regained. While no
research has yet robustly evaluated resilience, a
number of studies are relevant to it. The work by
Nesselroade and his colleagues, described earlier,
demonstrated the importance of short term variabil-
ity in physical function and blood pressure as a pre-
dictor of mortality among elderly subjects. We may
interpret low variability in blood pressure as an in-
dicator of resilience, but the interpretation must be
tentative; we do not know the challenges or stres-
sors to which these subjects were responding.
Conclusion
Recent and projected substantial increases in the
relative and absolute number of older persons in our
society pose a significant challenge for biology, social
and behavioral science, and medicine. Gerontology is
broadening its perspective from a prior preoccupa-
tion with disease and disability to a more robust view
that includes successful aging. As conceptual and em-
piric research in this area accelerates, successful
aging is seen as multidimensional, encompassing
three distinct domains: avoidance of disease and dis-
ability, maintenance of high physical and cognitive
function, and sustained engagement in social and
productive activities. For each of these domains, an
interdisciplinary database is coalescing that relates to
both reducing the risk of adverse events and enhanc-
ing resilience in their presence. Many of the predic-
tors of risk and of both functional and activity levels
appear to be potentially modifiable, either by individ-
uals or by changes in their immediate environments.
The stage is thus set for intervention studies to iden-
tify effective strategies that enhance the proportion
of our older population that ages successfully.
