Abstract
Background: End-stage renal disease rates rose following widespread introduction of high fructose corn syrup in the
American diet, supporting speculation that fructose harms the kidney. Sugar-sweetened soda is a primary source of
fructose. We therefore hypothesized that sugary soda consumption was associated with albuminuria, a sensitive marker for
kidney disease.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Design was a cross-sectional analysis. Data were drawn from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999­2004. The setting was a representative United States population sample.
Participants included adults 20 years and older with no history of diabetes mellitus (n = 12,601); after exclusions for missing
outcome and covariate information (n = 3,243), the analysis dataset consisted of 9,358 subjects. Exposure was consumption
of two or more sugary soft drinks, based on 24-hour dietary recall. The main outcome measure was Albuminuria, defined by
albumin to creatinine ratio cutpoints of .17 mg/g (males) and .25 mg/g (females). Logistic regression adjusted for
confounders (diet soda, age, race-ethnicity, gender, poverty). Interactions between age, race-ethnicity, gender, and
overweight-obesity were explored. Further analysis adjusted for potential mediators: energy intake, basal metabolic rate,
obesity, hypertension, lipids, serum uric acid, smoking, energy expenditure, and glycohemoglobin. Alternative soda intake
definitions and cola consumption were employed.
Results: Weighted albuminuria prevalence was 11%, and 17% consumed 2+ sugary soft drinks/day. The confounder-
adjusted odds ratio for sugary soda was 1.40 (95% confidence interval: 1.13, 1.74). Associations were modified by gender
(p = 0.008) and overweight-obesity (p = 0.014). Among women, the OR was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.37, 2.53); the OR among males
was not significant. In the group with body mass under 25 kg/m2, OR = 2.15 (95% confidence interval: 1.42, 3.25).
Adjustment for potential mediators and use of alternative definitions of albuminuria and soda consumption did not
appreciably change results. Diet sodas were not associated with albuminuria.
Conclusions: Findings suggest that sugary soda consumption may be associated with kidney damage, although moderate
consumption of 1 or fewer sodas does not appear to be harmful. Additional studies are needed to assess whether HFCS
itself, overall excess intake of sugar, or unmeasured lifestyle and confounding factors are responsible.

Introduction
The rising incidence of End Stage Renal Disease (ESRD)in the
United States over the past three decades is only partially
attributable to increasing prevalence of recognized risk factors,
most prominently diabetes mellitus [1]. The etiology of diabetes is
multi-causal, but increased energy intake and a diet rich in high-
glycemic-index foods are two likely culprits. Trends in the U.S.
diet further contribute to obesity, which has recently emerged as
an independent risk factor for kidney disease [2,3,4,5]. Trends in
diabetes, obesity and kidney disease have all followed the
introduction of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) in the American
diet [6,7]. In the United States, highly caloric carbonated soft
drinks are often sweetened with HFCS [8], which makes soda
inexpensive to produce. While sugary sodas may be sold cheaply
as a food item and yield a profit, they provide little satiety [9].
Kidney disease exacts an extensive human and economic price
through both ESRD and greatly elevated cardiovascular disease
risk [10,11,12]. Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is assessed in a
number of ways. In epidemiologic studies, estimated glomerular
PLoS ONE | www.plosone.org 1 October 2008 | Volume 3 | Issue 10 | e3431
filtration rate (GFR) and albuminuria are most commonly used
[13]. Albuminuria has the advantage of being a sensitive marker
for early kidney damage, and is prevalent in over 10% of the U.S.
adult population [14]. In the general population, albuminuria
predicts incident kidney failure [15] and cardiovascular disease,
even at levels considered ``normal'' [16,17,18].
Three mechanisms may relate soda consumption to albumin-
uria. First, as noted, the low cost of HFCS makes it profitable for
manufacturers and inexpensive for consumers, encouraging
consumption of large amounts of soda. Over-consumption of
sugars in any form may lead to the development of subclinical
diabetes, which may eventually manifest as kidney damage years
before clinical diagnosis and the onset of overt diabetes [19].
Obesity, also related to CKD, may be another consequence of
high levels of sugary soda consumption [9]. Second, fructose itself
may cause kidney damage, perhaps mediated by uric acid [6].
Third, other ingredients in soda, such as phosphorus in dark cola,
may lead directly to kidney damage [20].
Therefore, we sought to determine whether sugary soft drink
consumption was associated with albuminuria, a sensitive marker
of early kidney damage, in the general population.
Methods
Data were drawn from the U.S. population-based National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), 1999­
2004. The NHANES is a complex, nationally representative
sample of the entire non-institutionalized United States popula-
tion, now conducted in continuous bi-annual waves by the Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention [21]. We included only those
subjects 20 years and older without self-reported history of
diabetes and not missing diabetes status (n = 12,601). Exclusions
were made for those missing albuminuria outcome (n = 1,193),
missing dietary recall information (n = 693), and/or missing
confounder data (n = 2,020). A total of 3,243 subjects were thus
excluded, yielding an analysis dataset of 9,358 subjects with
complete data (74.3% of the non-diabetic cohort age 20 and
older). The current study was approved by the Loyola University
Chicago Stritch School of Medicine Institutional Review Board.
Albuminuria, the outcome variable in the primary analyses, was
defined by sex-specific albumin to creatinine ratio (ACR) cutpoints
of $17 mg/g in males and $25 mg/g in females; following
Mattix and colleagues, lower sex-specific cutpoints for males were
chosen based on their higher urinary creatinine concentrations for
any given level of albumin excretion [22]. GFR was estimated
using the abbreviated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease
(MDRD) estimating equation [23]. While GFR was compared
between albuminuria cases and non-cases, it was not the focus of
this study and was only included in secondary analyses. According
to available information, missing subjects had +1.20 mg/L higher
urinary albumin concentration (p,0.001 on the log scale). Missing
subjects were on average 1.6 years younger than non-missing
subjects (p,0.001) and had a body mass index that was an average
of 0.50 kg/m2 lower (p = 0.008).
All analyses were weighted by mobile examination clinic (MEC)
weights to account for the complex survey design, and analyzed
using STATA version 9.2 svy commands (STATA Corp., College
Station, TX) according to NHANES analytical guidelines [24].
Soda consumption was obtained from 24 hour dietary recall
(USDA Food Codes 92400000 through 92411610). Sugar-
sweetened and diet sodas were separately dichotomized as 0­1
(reference) vs. 2 or more drinks per day. The choice of this
cutpoint was based on preliminary analyses, which showed the
association between sugary drinks and albuminuria was similar for
0 and 1 drinks per day (8.7 and 9.6%, respectively; see Figure 1).
Unadjusted logistic regression was first conducted for associations
with albuminuria. Next, Model 1 adjusted for diet soda
consumption (2 or more, vs. 0­1 per day), age, non-Hispanic
black race or Hispanic ethnicity (reference: non-Hispanic white),
gender, and poverty; following Martins and colleagues, we defined
poverty as falling below twice the U.S. federal poverty guidelines
(for a non-elderly household of 2 in the year 2000, this was an
annual household income under $23,180) [25]. Race-ethnicity was
by self report, according to pre-set categories. A further analysis

(Model 2) included several variables assumed to be mediators of
any association, to see if any association with soda consumption
persisted. Model 2 included all of the variables in Model 1, plus
hypertension, glycohemoglobin A1C, total caloric consumption,
smoking (current vs. former or never), obesity, total cholesterol,
and a summary measure of physical activity (the sum of all reported
physical activity weighted by metabolic equivalent level or MET for
each activity, expressed as total MET-minutes; see http://www.cdc.
gov/nchs/data/nhanes/frequency/paqiaf_doc.pdf for more detail).
Hypertension was a dichotomous variable defined according to
Seventh Joint National Committee guidelines as systolic blood
pressure $140, diastolic blood pressure $90, self-reported history
of hypertension and/or use of antihypertensive medication [26].
In order to investigate effect measure modification of associa-
tions, interaction terms were introduced into the model between
consuming 2 or more sugary sodas and indicator variables for the
following: gender (male or female); self-reported race-ethnicity by
pre-defined categories (Non-Hispanic White, reference; Non-
Hispanic Black; or Hispanic of any race); age; and by
overweight/obesity category ($17.5 & ,25, ``low to normal
weight''; $25 & ,30, ``overweight''; and $30 kg/m2, ``obese'').
Significant interaction was defined at the p = 0.10 level, indicating
effect measure modification and warranting subgroup analyses.
Because serum uric acid levels have been associated with fructose
consumption [6,27], we assessed interaction with serum uric acid
(as a continuous variable) and with hyperuricemia (categorically
defined as the highest quartile of serum uric acid, 6.3 mg/dL or
higher). We then investigated whether any associations between
sugary soft drinks and albuminuria differed between sugar-
sweetened or diet colas and non-colas.
Several sensitivity analyses were conducted. Because 24-hour
recall is an imperfect measure of caloric intake and has known
biases by BMI [28,29,30,31], we compared the consumption
pattern of 2+ sodas per day as a function of both BMI category
and quartile of energy intake. We calculated Pearson x2 p-values
for row (BMI category within energy intake quartile) and column
(energy intake quartile within BMI categories) differences in
proportion in sugary soda intake; if there are significant biases by
BMI category, then x2 p-values for rows should be significant. We
expect column x2 p-values to be significant, since sugary soda
consumption should rise with increasing total daily energy intake.
Table 1 does not indicate any systematic biases by BMI category,
except for the 2nd quartile of energy intake (p = 0.035);
nevertheless, the pattern is for greater sugary soda consumption
to be reported among underweight and obese subjects, which is
not consistent with the prediction that underreporting would be
greatest in the obese subjects [31,32].
In order to determine that the results of Models 1 and 2 were
not due to macroalbuminuria, we excluded those subjects with
ACR$300 mg/g (n = 120, 1.3% of the analysis dataset). We then
used linear regression with log-transformed urinary albumin as the
dependent variable, and soda consumption (dichotomized as
above) as the main exposure of interest, adjusting for age, race,
ethnicity, gender, poverty, and the reciprocal of urinary creatinine;
we modeled the log of albumin concentration, rather than ACR,
as the dependent variable because the latter approach may
introduce spurious correlation [33]. Next, a logistic model similar
to Model 1 was used, but rather than categorizing sugary soda
consumption at the cutpoint of 2+ vs. 0­1, we instead defined
exposure as highest quintile group of sugary soda consumption (by
grams of sugar intake from soda). Further models adjusted for total
energy intake (in total kilocalories), alone or in combination with
basal metabolic rate (estimated using the Harris-Benedict
equation, [34]). We then used continuous eGFR in a linear
model, and dichotomized eGFR in logistic models; the dichoto-
mous models employed both the KDOQI guideline for Stage 3
CKD (eGFR,60 ml/min/1.73 m2), and a cutpoint with greater
specificity (eGFR ,45 ml/min/1.73 m2) as suggested by Go [35]
and Shoham [36].
Results
The study population was distributed evenly by gender and was
predominantly non-Hispanic White (55.6%); due to oversampling,
25.5% of the study population was African-American, and 33%
Hispanic. Summary statistics, overall and by albuminuria status,
are reported in Table 2 (note that results reported in the tables
take into account the complex survey design, including over-
sampling, and extrapolate back to the population from which they
are drawn). The mean age of the study population was 45.1 years.
Seventeen percent reported consuming two or more sugary sodas
a day, while 11% had elevated albuminuria (n = 1326; the
prevalence is extrapolated back to the general population).
Participants with albuminuria were more likely to be African-
American, obese, hypertensive, be physically inactive, or live
below twice the poverty line than participants without albumin-
uria. Mean ACR, triglyceride and total cholesterol level, BMI and
blood pressures were higher, and mean GFR lower, in
albuminuria cases compared to non-cases. There were no crude
differences in sugary soda consumption between cases and non-

cases. However, younger participants (ages 20­29) were more
likely than older ones (ages 65+) to drink sugary sodas (27.5% vs.
5.3%; p for trend,0.001), yet the younger subjects are also less
likely to have albuminuria. Figure 1 shows that there is no crude
relationship between sugary sodas and albuminuria (p for
trend = 0.84), while age adjustment reveals a clear, positive dose-
response relationship (p for trend,0.001).
Using the ``basic'' Model 1, adjusting for consumption of 2 or
more diet sodas per day, age, race-ethnicity, gender, and living
below twice the poverty level (Table 3), there was 40% increased
odds of having albuminuria associated with consuming two or
more sugary sodas per day (odds ratio [OR]: 1.40; 95% confidence
interval [CI]: 1.13, 1.74). Diet soda consumption was not
associated with albuminuria. Model 2 (Table 3), which added
several variables thought to be confounders and mediators of the
sugary soda and albuminuria association, yielded similar results to
Model 1.
There was no interaction between sugary soda consumption
and age (p = 0.14), black or Hispanic race-ethnicity (p = 0.88 and
0.33, respectively), continuous serum uric acid level (p = 0.52), or
hyperuricemia (p = 0.35). There was a significant negative
interaction between sugary soda consumption and being over-
weight (p = 0.005) or obese (p = 0.02) and with male gender
(p = 0.008), indicating the need for subgroup analyses. Among
women, the OR was 1.86 (95% CI: 1.37, 2.53). In the group with
low-to-optimal body weight (BMI 17.5­25 kg.m2), consumers of 2
or more sugary sodas had 2.15 times the odds of albuminuria as
those who consumed 0­1 sugary drinks (95% CI: 1.42, 3.25).
Associations in other subgroups were weak and imprecise.
The finding of negative interaction between obesity and sugary
soda consumption was unexpected, warranting further investigat-
ed of the relationship between BMI, soda consumption, and
albuminuria. We conducted a stratified analysis, fitting Model 1
within categories of underweight, optimal weight, overweight, and

obesity. Because the relationship between sugary soda consump-
tion and albuminuria appears to be modified in a quadratic
manner (Figure 2), we added to the variables in Model 1 the
following: BMI, BMI-squared, and interaction terms between soda
consumption and continuous BMI and BMI-squared (respective p-
values for interaction: 0.04 and 0.10). Due to the interaction terms,
there is no true main effect for sugary soda consumption in this
model. The results are reported in Figure 3, which shows that the
strongest association between sugary soda consumption and
albuminuria was at the low end of BMI: at 18.7 kg/m2 (the
midpoint of the lowest decile of BMI), the odds ratio was 2.48
(95% CI: 1.39, 4.42), while at a BMI of 40.2 (the midpoint of the
highest decile), the OR was 0.97 (95% CI: 0.62, 1.50). We
conclude that sugary sodas are most strongly associated with
albuminuria at the low end of body weight.
We then categorized sugary soda consumption as sugary cola,
sugary non-cola, diet cola, and diet non-cola, with the reference
being all other beverages. The strongest associations appeared for
consuming 2 or more sugary non-colas per day (OR = 1.77;
95%CI: 1.28, 2.45). Sugary cola, diet cola, and non-cola
consumption were not associated with albuminuria. Adjusting
for basal metabolic rate (BMR) yielded comparable results to
Model 1; energy intake adjustment yielded similar results to model
1 (OR = 1.45, 95% CI: 1.14, 1.83), whether or not BMR was also
included in the model. Defining high-intake consumers by top
quintile of sugar intake from soda yielded attenuated results yet a
slight improvement in precision (OR = 1.27, 95% CI: 1.04, 1.53).
Sensitivity analyses yielded robust results. Excluding subjects
with macroalbuminuria had no appreciable effect on the estimates.
When we fit a linear regression model with log-transformed
urinary albumin as the outcome, we obtained results consistent
with Model 1: consumers of 2 or more sugary soft drinks having on
average 1.13 mg/L higher albumin concentration than consumers
of 0­1 drinks (95% CI: 1.06, 1.21 mg/L). Interaction terms with
2+ sugary drinks were significant for gender (p = 0.03), and for
overweight (p = 0.01) but not for obesity (p = 0.42). Furthermore,
log-transformed urinary albumin concentration was 1.09 mg/L
higher among drinkers of 2 or more sugary colas (95% CI: 1.01,
1.18 mg/L), and 1.23 mg/L higher among sugary non-cola
drinkers (95% CI: 1.09, 1.40 mg/L), than among non-soda
drinkers; neither diet colas nor non-colas were related to
albuminuria. Modeling continuous eGFR as a function of the
covariates used in Model 1 did not yield statistically significant
association with sugary soda consumption (p = 0.586); there was
also no association when Stage 3 CKD (defined by eGFR,60 ml/
min/1.73 m2) was substituted as the dependent variable in model
1 (p = 0.347). When the CKD cutpoint was changed to ,45 ml/
min/1.73 m2, the odds ratio increased to 2.82 ((95%CI:1.63,4.89),
indicating that there may be an association between sugary soda
and more advanced CKD.
Discussion
We have found an association between sugar-sweetened sodas
and albuminuria, which is a marker of early kidney damage. To
our knowledge, this is the first report of such an association. In the
United States, sugary sodas are predominantly sweetened with
high fructose corn syrup [9,37]. Over the past 30 years, both the
availability of HFCS [38] and sugary soft drink consumption [8]
have risen markedly. The prevalences of obesity, diabetes, and
ESRD have all followed these trends; Figure 4 shows the temporal
correlation of ESRD due to diabetes with calories due to high
fructose corn syrup and soda consumption [6,7]. While ESRD
rates prior to 1992 may have risen due to better recognition and
expanding treatment by renal replacement therapy, more recent
trends likely reflect genuine increases in kidney failure [1,39].
Because there are many unobserved characteristics that also
change over time, inferring causation from correlated trends is
problematic. Nevertheless, the finding of an individual-level
association between sugary soda consumption and albuminuria
are consistent with the hypothesis that HFCS is contributing to the
kidney disease epidemic [6,7]. We note that neither diet soda nor
moderate intake of one serving of sugary soda was associated with
albuminuria in this study.

The strongest associations were seen among those with lower
body weight and females. It is not clear why females should be
more susceptible to sugary soft drinks than males. Women were
much less likely to consume 2 or more sugary drinks per day,
eliminating residual confounding as an explanation. Women are
also more likely to under-report (and men more likely to over-
report) their energy intake according to perceived social norms
[40]. Such misclassification may differentially bias results toward
the null, because the absolute degree of under- or over-reporting
differs by gender. Biological differences, such as lower energy
intake need among women, might also account for the interaction
of consumption and gender. However, this interaction was not an

artifact of using gender-specific albuminuria cutpoints, because
when we used log urinary albumin as the dependent variable, we
still found significant interaction between gender and sugary soda
consumption.
Optimal body weight may increase susceptibility because
obesity is a competing mechanism by which sugar consumption
could cause kidney damage [3]. If subjects are already obese, and
their albuminuria is due to obesity, then any additional effects of
sugary sodas would be attenuated. Alternatively, differential
reporting may account for the apparent lack of association among
the overweight and obese, as food intake is more likely to be
underreported as BMI increases and body image satisfaction
decreases [31,32]. Nevertheless, underreporting by BMI is not
supported by these data, as evidenced by the lack of a significant
association between BMI categories and sugary soda consumption
within quartiles of energy intake (Table 1).
Our results suggest that fructose may be nephrotoxic via
pathways other than diabetes, long-term blood glucose level,
hypertension, or obesity, because adjusting for these potential
mediators did not eliminate the association. We caution that
mediator-adjusted models are not causal models, and they rarely
meet the conditions necessary to accurately identify independent
effects of the main exposure [41]. Nevertheless, were these factors
to truly explain our findings, we should have seen greater
attenuation of the odds ratio than we did. It may be that fructose
causes both kidney damage and obesity in parallel. Although
fructose has not been directly linked to kidney disease, Johnson
and Nielson have speculated that it may be directly pathogenic to
human kidneys [6,7]. The results are consistent with laboratory
studies implicating fructose in rat models of kidney disease
[42,43,44]. Johnson hypothesized that fructose ­ kidney associa-
tions may be explained by uric acid [6]. However, adjustment for
uricemia did not attenuate this association in our study.
Identification of pathways leading from albuminuria to kidney
damage would strengthen the case for the observed association
being a causal one.
Recent reports have shown that fructose consumption in the
form of soft drinks increases the risk of kidney stones and gout
[45,46], which suggest a link between soda consumption, high
fructose corn syrup, and chronic kidney disease. Diet sodas have
also been associated with the development of metabolic syndrome
[47,48], which is itself a risk factor for CKD, although we did not
find an association. We know of just one prior study directly
examining soda consumption and kidney disease. Saldana and
colleagues conducted a case-control study of 465 newly diagnosed
chronic kidney disease patients in North Carolina, comparing
their carbonated beverage consumption to 467 community
controls [20]. They found an association between sugar-sweetened
and diet colas with CKD, but not non-cola carbonated beverages.
Our study differs from theirs in several respects. First, we used
albuminuria as the outcome variable rather than diagnosed CKD.
Albuminuria is a subclinical condition that may appear years
before diagnosed CKD, and CKD may follow pathophysiological
pathways that do not involve albuminuria. Second, the focus of
Saldana's analysis was on carbonated beverages and cola
consumption, not sugary soft drinks. They found similar odds
ratios of sugar-sweetened and diet colas with CKD, while we
found an association only with sugar-sweetened sodas, but not diet
colas or other diet sodas. Third, they asked subjects to recall
average adult beverage consumption prior to 1980, while
NHANES was a cross sectional study that employed a 24-hour
recall instrument. Studies relying on retrospective recall may yield
biased results [49], although Saldana and colleagues discount the
possibility of differential recall because data were collected before
researchers suspected cola consumption might be linked to kidney
disease. Another potential reason for the differences in findings is
that carbonated beverages were overwhelmingly sweetened with
sucrose in the early 1980s [50], perhaps accounting for Saldana's
finding of similar associations between sugar-sweetened and diet
cola beverages; in contrast, HFCS was in wide use when our study
was conducted (see Figure 4) [38]. Finally, our study used
nationally representative data, while theirs was confined to
hospital patients and community controls in North Carolina.
Several limitations must be noted. First, this study was cross-
sectional, precluding us from observing longitudinal associations.
In particular, we could not determine if the complex interaction
between BMI, soda consumption, and albuminuria was confound-
ed by processes such as wasting associated with chronic disease
[51]. Second, the NHANES surveys employ a 24 hour dietary
recall and did not have measurement of diet over time, which may
have led to underreporting of intake by obesity status. However,
24 hour recall provides valid estimates of group-average dietary
intake [30]. Third, we did not have a direct measurement of intake
of HFCS, which is ubiquitous in the American diet. If HFCS is the
salient exposure, and non-consumers of sugary sodas have
significant intake of HFCS from other sources, then we may have
misclassified people by using soda consumption, underestimating
the true effect. Fourth, albuminuria was assessed using a single
specimen. In a random population-based sample (including non-
diabetics), microalbuminuria persist in only 61% of participants
with a single positive result [52]. Nevertheless, albuminuria
persistence should be non-differential with respect to soda
consumption, making the results reported here underestimates.
Finally, tastes serve as markers of social class [53], suggesting that
soda consumption is linked to myriad lifestyle factors that have not
been fully captured here. This leaves open the possibility that these
results are due to residual confounding, a problem generic to
nutritional epidemiology studies. Understanding why sugary soda
drinkers consume these beverages, while others do not, would
improve both control of confounding, and potentially lead to more
successful interventions.
In spite of these limitations, several strengths deserve mention.
First, we used nationally representative data drawn from the
NHANES surveys, yielding population-based measures of associ-

ation that are generalizable to the general population, including
racial and ethnic minorities. Second, because we had over 9,000
subjects and over 1,000 cases, we could explore effect measure
modification (interactions) and estimate associations within
subgroups of participants. Third, the richness of the NHANES
dataset allowed us to adjust for a host of potential confounders and
mediators, and associations with sugary soda consumption
remained elevated even after adjusting for these factors. We
conducted several sensitivity analyses, including modeling the log
of albumin excretion, use of energy intake to define soda
consumption, and adjustment for overall energy intake and basal
metabolic rate. The associations were robust to different
definitions of exposure, outcome, and adjustment factors. Finally,
we found that the association of sugary soda consumption with
eGFR below ,45 ml/min/1.73 m2 was stronger than the
association with albuminuria, which may reflect an association
with more advanced chronic kidney disease [35]
In conclusion, we have found that sugary soft drink consump-
tion is associated with albuminuria. While these results are
consistent with prior knowledge, they can only suggest that HFCS
plays a causal role in kidney disease. Longitudinal studies, with
measures of HFCS and other sugar consumption, are needed to
formally test this hypothesis. At this point in time, policy
recommendations regarding soda consumption or HFCS would
be premature. Our findings should be seen in the context of
disparate associations with CKD and metabolic syndrome that
have recently been found for colas (but not sugary non-colas) and
diet sodas [20,47,48]. Additional study is needed before we may
determine whether these findings are due to unmeasured lifestyle
factors, other residual confounders, or truly causal associations.
