Statement of Problem
A flood is the accumulation of too much water which rises to
overflow land which is not normally submerged
(Mukhopadhyay, 2010; Ward, 1978). Flooding can comprise
overflow of a river as a result of prolonged seasonal rainfall,
rainstorm, snowmelt, dam-breaks, accumulation of rainwater
in low-lying areas with a high water table, or inadequate
storm drainage. Floods could also be caused by intrusion of
sea water onto coast lands during cyclonic/tidal surges
(Handmer, Penning-Rowsell, & Tapsell, 1999; Stoltman,
Lidstone, & DeChano, 2004).
The terms used to describe flooding are numerous and
may mean different things to different scholars with respect
to the context in which they are used (Brooks, 2003; Brooks,
Adger, & Kelly, 2005). Social scientists and climate scien-
tists often mean different things when they use the term "vul-
nerability"; whereas social scientists tend to view
vulnerability as representing the set of socio-economic fac-
tors that determine people's ability to cope with stress or
change (Allen, 2003), climate scientists often view vulnera-
bility in terms of the likelihood of occurrence and impacts of
weather- and climate-related events (Fussel & Klein, 2006;
Hinkel, 2011; Malone & Engle, 2011; Nicholls, Hoozemans,
& Marchand, 1999; Vincent, 2004; Yusuf & Francisco,
2009). Vulnerability as used in this work is those biophysical
and socio-economic factors that determine people's ability to
cope with flooding.
The occurrence of floods in Nigeria is not a recent phe-
nomenon (Adeloye & Rustum, 2011; Ayoade, 1979; Ayoade
& Akintola, 1980; Olaniran, 1983; Ologunorisa & Terso,
2006). The recent occurrences of flooding in the country
such as the Sokoto flood in 2010, Ibadan flood in 2011,
Lagos flood in 2011, and the 2012 floods in parts of Lokoja,
Makurdi, Asaba, Ogbaru, Yenegoa and so on, had shown that
flooding is one of the major environmental problems faced in
Nigeria. Most research works had examined extensively the
causal factors and have attributed flooding to topography,
soil/vegetation/river alteration, increased heavy rainfall, land
use change, and unplanned urbanization (Adeloye & Rustum,
2011; Folorunsho & Awosika, 2001; Ogba & Utang, 2008;

Spatial Analysis of Vulnerability to
Flooding in Port Harcourt Metropolis,
Nigeria
Thecla I. Akukwe1 and Chinedu Ogbodo1
Abstract
This study analyzed the vulnerability to flooding in Port Harcourt metropolis, Nigeria, by creating vulnerability indices and
comparing these indices across the 13 zones that make up Port Harcourt metropolis. The integrated vulnerability assessment
approach using indicators was adopted. The indicators were grouped into adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure based
on the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change definition of vulnerability. The data on these indicators were obtained
from fieldwork, questionnaire, and map measurements. Principal component analysis was performed to obtain the first
component scores which were used to weight the variables before calculating the vulnerability indices of the 13 zones. The
vulnerability indices results show that Mgbuosimiri (Zone K) is relatively the most vulnerable, whereas the least vulnerable
is Eligbolo (Zone D). Cluster analysis was used to group the different vulnerability indices to produce a vulnerability map
showing the spatial pattern of the different flood vulnerability levels (i.e., very high, high, low, and very low vulnerability
levels). The spatial pattern of the vulnerability levels increases toward the north west, south west, south, and north east, and
decreases toward the central of Port Harcourt. However, the vulnerability map can be used for the reduction of damage
potential by integrating its outputs into spatial planning and emergency planning.

Ologunorisa, 2004; Onokerhoraye, 1995; Oriola, 1994;
Parker, 1999). The impacts and effects of flooding have also
been noted to range from submerging roads, obstruction of
traffic, coastal erosion, disruption of economic activities,
displacement of people, loss of property, to loss of lives
(Etuonovbe, 2011).
Scientific studies suggest that climate change is likely to
cause shifts in the global pattern and intensity of flood events
in some regions, thereby increasing the exposure of popula-
tions to severe flooding (Few, 2003), and that the impacts of
future changes in climate extremes are expected to fall dis-
proportionately on the poor (Intergovernmental Panel on
Climate Change [IPCC], 2001, 2007; Midgley, Davies, &
Chesterman, 2011).
Studies on vulnerability to climate change and climate
risks, including floods, have been undertaken in different
regions of the world (Ali, 2007; Aragon-Durand, 2007;
Bankoff, 2003; Dutta, Khatun, & Herath, 2005; Gbetibouo &
Ringler, 2009; Heltberg & Bonch-Osmolovskiy, 2011;
Metzger & Schroter, 2006; Midgley et al., 2011; Thieken,
Kreibich, & Merz, 2007; Thorton et al., 2006; Yusuf &
Francisco, 2009). Some excellent conceptual and applied
work has emerged in the fields of climate change vulnerabil-
ity and adaptation (Adger, 2006; Fussel & Klein, 2006; Smit
& Wandel, 2006; Vincent, 2004). However, it has been chal-
lenging to convert conceptual and qualitative approaches
into a quantitative index of vulnerability (Hinkel, 2011).
Climate risk and vulnerability mapping have been con-
ducted mostly for the developed countries, but in develop-
ing countries, there however exists a gap in the knowledge
of vulnerability and coping capacities of African societies
to flood hazards, where many of recorded flood disasters
are consequences of natural hazards aggravated by devel-
opment flaws in affected communities (Adelekan, 2010;
Olorunfemi, 2011). Nigeria is not an exception; knowledge
is still sparse in the literature on flood vulnerability map-
ping in the country. However, some studies have been car-
ried out on flood vulnerability assessment in some Nigerian
areas using different approaches (Ologunorisa, 2004;
Ishaya, Ifatimehin, & Abaje, 2009; Ologunorisa, 2004).
The study approach of Ologunorisa (2004) was basically an
assessment of flood vulnerability zones in the Niger Delta
using hydrological techniques based on some measurable
physical characteristics, whereas Ishaya et al. (2009)
mapped areas vulnerable to flood hazard in Gwagwalada
urban area of Abuja using LandsatTM image of 1991 and
2001. Adelekan (2010) approach was based on using the
vulnerability characteristics of people to assess the disas-
trous Abeokuta flood that occurred in 2007. Hitherto, none
of these studies provides information on the integrated
flood assessment in any part of the country. This is unfortu-
nate, because it has increasingly been acknowledged that an
area like the Niger Delta region, which experiences peren-
nial floods owing to its location and low-lying topography,
and heavy rainfall (Ogba & Utang, 2008; Ologunorisa &
Abawua, 2005), should have been assessed using the inte-
grated method. Port Harcourt is one of such areas consid-
ered to be vulnerable to flooding (Oku, Wichendu, &
Poronaike, 2011). In 2006, Port Harcourt experienced an
unprecedented flooding which submerged houses, para-
lyzed economic activities, and rendered some people inter-
nally displaced in some zones (Zabbey, 2006). Therefore,
the need to show the spatial variations to flood vulnerabili-
ties within zones in Port Harcourt metropolis, which will be
used in emergency planning and policy making, forms the
purpose of this study.
Objectives of the Study
The objectives of the study are to
1. examine the socio-economic characteristics and
adaptive capacities of residents,
2. examine the sensitivity and exposure indicators used
in creating the vulnerability for the 13 zones in Port
Harcourt metropolis,
3. assess and map the vulnerable areas/zones using both
biophysical and socio-economic indicators,
4. examine the spatial pattern of flood vulnerability lev-
els in Port Harcourt metropolis, and
5. suggest measures for reducing future flood vulnera-
bility in the study area.
The Study Area
Location
Port Harcourt metropolis is located between Latitude 4°45'N
and Latitude 4°55'N, and Longitude 6°55'E and Longitude
7°05'E in Rivers State. It is a city in the Niger Delta region
of Nigeria. The city lies at the mouth of River Bonny in
Rivers State. It is located at about 25 km from the Atlantic
Ocean and is situated between the Dockyard creek/Bonny
River and the Amadi creek. It lies at an average altitude of
about 12 m above mean sea level. Port Harcourt metropolis
spans over two local government areas (LGAs) viz Port
Harcourt and Obio/Akpor (Figure 1 and Figure 2).
Climate
The study area lies within the Koppen Tropical Rainy Af cli-
matic zone of the Koppen classification (Koppen, 1936).
Here, the average temperature for every month is above
18°C, and there is adequate moisture in virtually all the
months. Port Harcourt metropolis experiences two seasons,
that is, dry and rainy seasons. Temperatures over Port
Harcourt metropolis are constantly high with a mean maxi-
mum of about 34°C and a mean minimum of about 21°C.
The highest temperatures are recorded between the months
of April and October.

Research Method
To achieve the aim of this research work, the already delin-
eated map of Port Harcourt metropolis into 13 zones by the
Survey Department was used (Figure 3). These zones are
Rumukwurushi (Zone A), Rumuodara (Zone B), Elekahia
(Zone C), Eligbolo (Zone D), Bori Camp (Zone E), Bodo
(Zone F), Orogbum (Zone G), Golf Course (Zone H),
Mgbuoba (Zone I), Rumuepirikom (Zone J), Mgbuosimiri
(Zone K), Amatagwolo (Zone L), and Town (Zone M).
Zones A to M were arbitrarily assigned by the researcher
and were in most cases used for analyses instead of the
zones' respective names.
Field Techniques
Field survey, questionnaire, and interviews were used to
achieve the objectives of this research. According to Yamane
(1967) and Israel (1992), the sampling size of any population
that is more than 100,000 persons is 400 using the equation
below at ±5% level of precision:

where n is the sample size; N is the population, that is, census
population figure; and e is the level of precision/sampling
error.
A total of 650 copies (although these exceeded the bench-
mark of 400 persons as the population of Port Harcourt
metropolis is more than 1,000,000 persons) of questionnaire
were purposively distributed; 50 for each zone for equal and
unbiased representation, and 613 were retrieved. The simple
random sampling technique was adopted in administering
the copies of questionnaire, from which the respondents'
household income level, level of education, ownership of
radio/TV/phone, physical structures (building quality),
impact of floods on welfare and income earning opportuni-
ties, economic diversification, residents' experience with
flooding, past flood experience, and flood resilience periods
were understood. The period of study was from 2010 to
2012.
Poverty was measured using the United Nations poverty
line, which says that anybody who earns less than $2/day is
considered poor. Therefore, in this study, anybody who earns
between N5,000 and N9,000 monthly is counted poor ($1 =
N155, 310 × 30 days = N9,300).
Secondary data such as rainfall data were collected from
the Port Harcourt meteorological station while a map show-
ing the 13 zones in Port Harcourt metropolis was collected
from the Survey Department, Port Harcourt.
Vulnerability Assessment and Indicators
Assessment of flood vulnerability is an important factor in
determining where there are zones of different flood risk and
why they are at risk. The integrated assessment approach and
the indicator method in which both biophysical and socio-
economic factors are systemically combined to determine
vulnerability were adopted in this study to calculate the zonal
vulnerability indices. Indicators were adopted to assess the
exposure, sensitivity, and coping/adaptive capacity of the

respondents based on the definition of vulnerability given by
IPCC (2007) where vulnerability is defined as " . . . a func-
tion of the character, magnitude and rate of climate variation
which a system is exposed, its sensitivity, and its adaptive
capacity" (pp. 89-90).
The selected vulnerability indicators and their determi-
nants are shown in Table 1.
Adaptive capacity indicators were chosen based on the
following factors: socio-economic/physical factors that
influence the ability of people to adjust to flooding, to

moderate its potential/actual damages, to take advantage of
opportunities arising from it, or to cope with the conse-
quences (adapted from IPCC, 2007). Six adaptive capacity
indicators were used, these are, monthly income (in Naira),
educational qualification of respondents, group/association
membership, receipt of assistance/relief materials, radio/TV/
phone ownership, and quality of housing structures.
Sensitivity is the degree to which a system is affected
either adversely or beneficially, by climate variability, for
example, frequency of flooding (adapted from IPCC,
2007).
Four sensitivity indicators were used, these are, frequency
of floods, severity of flood experienced, pre-flood aware-
ness, and past (6 months) flood experience.
Exposure is seen as the nature and degree to which a sys-
tem/people is/are exposed to significant flooding (adapted
from IPCC, 2007). Two exposure indicators were used, these
are, distance of dwelling units to a major river and height/
depth of flood.
Data on the various indicators were collected using ques-
tionnaire except for those of proximity of dwelling units to a
river, which were measured using maps.
Thus, vulnerability to flooding was calculated according
to Deressa, Hassan, and Ringler (2008) as follows:

This equation was adopted because flooding is one of the
consequences of climate change.

Data Analysis
Both the descriptive and statistical methods of analysis were
used in this work. SPSS Version 20.0 was used to run the
correspondence analysis, principal component analysis
(PCA), and cluster analysis. The weightings used in the cor-
respondence analysis were based mainly on the assumptions
made in Table 1. ArcGIS 10.0 was used to generate the vul-
nerability map.
Correspondence Analysis, PCA, and Cluster
Analysis
Correspondence analysis was run on the variables to trans-
form the non-metric data to a metric level and perform
dimensional reduction. In essence, correspondence analysis
was used to quantify the qualitative data obtained from
questionnaire.
PCA was run on the variables, and weights were gener-
ated and attached using the first principal component scores
of the indicators. The reason for assigning the weights deter-
mined by PCA to indicators is to avoid the uncertainty of
equal weighting given the diversity of indicators used
(adapted from Deressa et al., 2008). Thus, for the construc-
tion of the zonal vulnerability indices, the selected indicators
of sensitivity and exposure were negatively associated with
their first principal component because it is assumed that
areas/zones with higher frequencies of flooding were sub-
jected to higher sensitivity due to the adverse effects of
flooding as well as being more exposed. On the other hand,
adaptive capacity was positively associated with the first
principal components because it is assumed that people with
higher adaptive capacity are less sensitive to damages caused
by flooding, holding exposure level constant. Thus, higher
values of the vulnerability indices show less vulnerability
and vice versa (adapted from Deressa et al., 2008; Madu,
2011).
Finally, hierarchical cluster analysis was performed on
the vulnerability indices to group the zones according to sim-
ilarity in their degrees of vulnerability using average linkage
method, and the spatial pattern of the different vulnerability
levels was mapped.
Discussion of Results
Result of the PCA
The PCA of the data set on vulnerability indicators extracted
three components with eigenvalues greater than 1. Table 2
reveals that these three components explained 64.69% of the
total variance in the data set. The first principal component
explained most of the variation (43.036%), the second prin-
cipal component explained 12.488%, and the third compo-
nent explained the least (9.170%). The first principal
component, which explained the majority of the variation in
the data set (Table 3), was taken (i.e., it served as the weight)
and used in the computation of the vulnerability indices of
the different zones.

variations in the tables show how individuals often vary in
terms of age, occupation, level of education, economic sta-
tus, access to technology, and so on, within and across differ-
ent zones/regions.
Generally, in Port Harcourt metropolis, majority of the
respondents are between the ages of 25 and 34 years, and this
is followed by those between 35 and 44 years of age, 15 and
24 years, 45 and 54 years, 65 years and above, and finally by
those between the ages of 55 and 64 years. These are repre-
sented by 38.30%, 23.30%, 17.70%, 12.10%, 4.80%, and
3.8%, respectively, of the sampled respondents (Table 4).
It is conceived that there is a negative correlation between
monthly income of respondents and their zones' vulnerabil-
ity levels, as well as their educational level and their zones'
vulnerability levels.
In Port Harcourt metropolis, majority (15.40%) of the
respondents earn N50,000 and above monthly, and this is
followed by those who earn between N35,000 and N39,000,
whereas only 2.70% of the respondents earn between
N5,000 and N9,000 monthly. This shows that only 2.70%
of the respondents live below the poverty line of $2 per day
(Table 5).

On average, in Port Harcourt metropolis, literacy level is
high, as 47.6% of the respondents hold either HND/BSc,
MSc, or PhD, whereas 30% and 20.6% hold OND/NCE and
WAEC/SSCE, respectively. Only 1.8% hold FSLC as their
highest educational qualification (Table 6).
Membership in a support network improves social capital
of members and thereby, their resilience. However, there is
an inverse relationship or negative correlation between group
membership of respondents and their zones' vulnerability
level. In Port Harcourt metropolis, 70.5% respondents belong
to a group and 29.5% do not (Table 7).
A high percentage of respondents have never received
relief materials or assistance of any form to help them recover
from the shock of flood. This is believed to have a direct
negative effect on the vulnerability levels of the individual
zones. On average, in the study area, only 34.2% of the
respondents indicated that they received assistance of any
kind, whereas 65.8% did not (Table 8).

The ownership of radio/TV/phone is a measure of access
to technology, and this is necessary as a means through which
information on impending flood hazards could be dissemi-
nated. The data obtained (Table 9) indicate that only 2.1%,
2.2%, and 4.0% do not have access to either of these techno-
logical devices in Zones C, K, and M, respectively. All the
respondents in other zones either own a radio set, television
set, or phone. This indicator was among the least factors that
determined the vulnerability levels of zones because the
number of respondents without access to either radio or TV
or phone did not vary significantly across the zones.
The quality of housing structure influences the degree of
damage of flooding. Analysis of the collected information
revealed that majority of the respondents live in houses con-
structed with concrete rather than zinc or wooden houses.
Only 2% and 4% of the respondents in Zone M indicated that
they live in houses constructed with zinc and wood, respec-
tively (Table 10).

Sensitivity and Exposure Indicators
Frequency of flood has to do with how often flooding occurs
in the various zones. It is however conceived that the more
frequently floods occur in a zone, the higher that zone's vul-
nerability level. It could be ascertained from Table 11 below
that flooding is a problem in Port Harcourt metropolis
because on average, only a few persons (11.7%) indicated
that flooding occurs rarely, whereas 46.50% and 19.3%

informed that floods occur whenever it rains and throughout
the rainy season, respectively. In terms of severity of floods,
floods experienced in the study area are moderate with 37.5%
indicating this. The percentage of respondents who indicated
that the intensity of the flood experienced is severe and mild
are 35.4% and 27.1%, respectively (Table 12).
Pre-flood awareness influences the place where people
reside, flood preparedness, and thereby their exposure to
flooding. Therefore, the higher the number of respondents
with high flood perception, the lower their zones'vulnerabil-
ity levels (holding every other factor constant). In Port
Harcourt metropolis, the highest proportion (36.2%) of the
respondents indicated that they had little awareness of flood,
which is followed by those who were fairly aware of flood
events (29.2%). The next is the group that indicated that they
were not aware at all (18.6%), and the minority (16.0%) indi-
cated that they were highly aware (Table 13). There is also a
direct relationship between past flood experience and vulner-
ability level. The majority of the respondents who had expe-
rienced flood in the last 6 months reside in Zones C, H, K, L,
and M representing 63.8%, 68.1%, 79.1%, 80.0%, and
87.8%, respectively, of the total number of responses in the
zones (Table 14).
The location of houses in terms of their proximity to
major rivers or creeks gives a measure of exposure to flood
hazard. Relatively, Zone K recorded the mean shortest dis-
tance of any of its dwelling units to a river, whereas Zone D
recorded the farthest (Table 15). With respect to the sampled
population in all the zones and the location of houses, mea-
surement results show that 39.32% of the respondents reside
in zones located between 125 m and 360 m away from a
major river. The percentage of respondents who are residing

in zones that are located about 2,200 m to 2,700 m away
from a major water body is 8.16%. The percentage of respon-
dents who live in zones situated about 3.6 km to 4.7 km away
from a water body is 14.52%, and 22.18% reside in zones
that are located more than 5.6 km away from a river. The
result shows that more than one third of the respondents stay
in zones that are exposed to flooding in terms of their prox-
imity to a major river, creek, or stream. Table 15 below
shows the mean proximity of dwelling units of respondents
to a major water body.
How deep flood waters are in any zone has a positive cor-
relation with its vulnerability level, in the sense that the
deeper the flood waters, the more the damage and the vulner-
ability. About 49.2% respondents estimated the height of
flood water to be between ankle and knee, 34.7% said it is
often at knee length, 13.8% indicated it to be above knee
length, and 2.3% informed it is often waist high in Port
Harcourt metropolis (Table 16).

Results of the Vulnerability Indices to
Flooding in Port Harcourt Metropolis
Using Equations 2 and 3, the vulnerability indices for the 13
zones were computed using the values in Tables 3 and 17
(derived from Tables 5-16). Table 18 shows the vulnerability
indices for all the 13 zones that make up Port Harcourt
metropolis. As indicated in the research methodology, factor
scores from the first principal component were used to con-
struct vulnerability index for each zone. For instance, the
vulnerability index for Rumukwurushi (Zone A) is calcu-
lated as follows:

The vulnerability indices calculations for the rest of the
zones followed the same procedure (Table 18).
Table 18 reveals that Zone K (Mgbuosimiri) is the most
vulnerable among all the zones followed by Zone J
(Rumuepirikom), Zone I (Mgbuoba), Zone L (Amatagwolo),
Zone M (Town), Zone A (Rumukwurushi), Zone B
(Rumuodara), Zone G (Orogbum), and Zone H (Golf Course).
These zones recorded a vulnerability index ranging from 0 to
3. The least vulnerable zone is Zone D (Eligbolo), followed by
Zone E (Bori Camp), Zone F (Bodo), and Zone C (Elekahia),
whose vulnerability indices are between 4 and 8 (Table 19).
Classification of the Vulnerability
Indices of the Thirteen Zones in Port
Harcourt Metropolis
The zones were grouped according to their similarity in
degrees of vulnerability using average linkage cluster analy-
sis method of classification. The grouping shows four clus-
ters representing four different zonal vulnerability levels in
Port Harcourt (Figure 4 and Table 19).
The dendrogram (tree graph) reveals that four clusters
(vulnerability groups) were obtained with six zones in the
first cluster; three zones in the second cluster; three zones in
the third cluster, and only a zone in the fourth cluster.
Table 19 shows that Amatagwolo, Town, Mgbuoba,
Rumuepirikom, Mgbuosimiri, and Rumukwurushi (i.e.,
Zones L, M, I, J, K, and A) have very high vulnerability lev-
els with a mean index of 0.43, whereas Rumuodara,
Orogbum, and Golf Course (Zones B, G, and H) have high
vulnerability level with a mean index of 3.02. The above
Zones are therefore known as the flood vulnerability
"hotspots." The table also reveals that Bori Camp, Bodo, and
Elekahia (Zones E, F, and C) have low vulnerability level
with a mean index of 5.41, whereas Eligbolo (Zone D) has
very low vulnerability level with a mean index of 7.72.
Spatial Pattern of Flood Vulnerability
Levels in Port Harcourt Metropolis
The mapped result of the cluster analysis shows that the spa-
tial pattern of the vulnerability levels in Port Harcourt
metropolis tends to increase toward the north west, south
west, south, and north east, and decreases toward the central
(Figure 5). This vulnerability map was generated using
ArcGIS 10.0. The observed spatial pattern in the vulnerabil-
ity levels of the zones as inferred from field investigations
and data analyses is highly attributed to the differences in
distance of these zones to major water bodies in Port Harcourt
metropolis. Those zones (e.g., K, M, etc.) that are closer to
water bodies recorded higher vulnerability levels than those
farther away from major water bodies (e.g., Zone D; see
Table 15). It is quite surprising that Rumukwurushi and
Mgbuoba (Zones A and I) recorded a higher vulnerability
than Elekahia (Zone C), which is closer to a water body than
them. This indicates that other factors also influence flood
vulnerability levels in study area.
Moreover, the zones in the first and second clusters (i.e.,
toward the north west, south west, south east, and north east
of Port Harcourt metropolis) are highly vulnerable to flood-
ing, because they have only few people who belong to an
association/group; who received assistance/relief; and who
had pre-flood awareness (see Tables 7, 8, and 13, respec-
tively). In addition, their high vulnerability can also be attrib-
uted to having highest number of people who earn between
N5,000 and N9,000 monthly and those who had experienced
floods in the last 6 months (Tables 5 and 14, respectively).
Those who earn between N5,000 and N9,000 monthly were
considered poor as indicated in the methodology. The reverse
is the case with the third and fourth clusters (the central of
the study area), which is why they have relatively low vul-
nerability levels.
Recommendations
Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDs)
A sustainable drainage system aims to mimic as closely as
possible the natural drainage of an urban area to minimize
the impact of urban development on the flooding and pollu-
tion of waterways. These may take the form of areas of veg-
etation such as grassy banks or green roofs, or natural water

storage features such as ponds.Although the components can
differ greatly, researchers have suggested that all SUDs use
one or more of the following:
·
· Encouraging uptake of water by the ground
("infiltration"),
·
· Reducing peak flow rates of runoff ("attenuation"),
·
· Transferring runoff in a controlled manner to other
sites ("conveyance"),
·
· Capturing water directly on-site for controlled dis-
charge later ("storage").
This approach would take all the zones into consideration.

reduces the probability of damage. This type of risk preven-
tion is of great importance for areas with great flood depth.
Low-cost houses in less flood-prone areas in Port Harcourt
metropolis should be built by the government where affected
residents or evacuated victims especially from the flood vul-
nerability "hotspots" could stay temporarily during flood
peak periods till dry season.
Therefore, National Emergency Management Agency
(NEMA) should equally be equipped to evacuate victims
during flood emergencies as well as distribute relief materi-
als to relieve victims of sustained shocks. Observations and
interviews show that NEMA had demonstrated a poor capa-
bility in managing flood disasters in Port Harcourt metropo-
lis. Although, NEMA is a Federal parastatal, the Government
of Rivers State can give subvention to this agency to help in
times of flood emergencies.
Demolition of Illegal Structures
Structures that are built on the pathways of flood waters in all
the zones should be demolished, and the Master Plan of the
Greater Port Harcourt City Development Plan (GPHCDP)
should be implemented. This would reduce the increased rate
of uncontrolled urbanization/urban creep and decongest Port
Harcourt City where affected people would be encouraged to
relocate to unsaturated areas.
Awareness Creation/Sensitizing the People on
Pre-Flood and Post-Flood Actions
Awareness and perceptions of a problem shape action or
inaction on the problem (Speranza, 2010). Fieldworks and
interviews revealed that most residents of Port Harcourt
metropolis do not have in-depth understanding of flood
problem and its implications. It is essential that residents of
the study area recognize flooding as part of their environ-
ment. Thus, it is very important to explain the various causes,
consequences, and things to be done to reduce the adverse
effects of flooding through radio/TV programs. The integra-
tion of the knowledge of flood problems, prevention, and
protection, as well as mitigation into Rivers State's primary
and secondary education programs, would also go a long
way improving people's resilience to flooding. Effective and
efficient sensitization of the residents on early warning signs
of floods and what to do before, during, and after flood epi-
sodes (i.e., preparing them for the worst case) would help
reduce the damages caused by flooding in all the zones.
Monetary Compensation of Flood Victims
A compensation system should be established by the Rivers
State Government to support the victims of flood disasters to
restore their economic basis and their living conditions in
due time. This would also help in alleviating non-insurable
public damage.

Conclusion
This study analyzed the vulnerability to flooding in Port
Harcourt, Nigeria, by creating vulnerability indices and com-
paring these indices across the 13 zones that make up Port
Harcourt metropolis. The vulnerability analysis followed the
IPCC (2007) definition of vulnerability, which gave room for
adaptive capacity, sensitivity, and exposure indicators to be
adopted. The integrated vulnerability assessment approach
was adopted to analyze vulnerability in Port Harcourt
metropolis, which combined the socio-economic and bio-
physical variables.
The calculated vulnerability indices range from 0 to 7
with 0 representing the highest vulnerability and 7 represent-
ing the lowest vulnerability. The vulnerability indices were
grouped using cluster analysis, which revealed four clusters
representing four different vulnerability levels, that is, very
high, high, low, and very low in the study area, of which
zones with very high and high vulnerability levels were
termed the flood vulnerability "hotspots." The identified
flood vulnerability "hotspots" are Amatagwolo, Town,
Mgbuoba, Rumuepirikom, Mgbuosimiri, Rumukwurushi,
Rumuodara, Orogbum, and Golf Course (i.e., Zones L, M, I,
J, K,A, B, G, and H). Bori Camp, Bodo, and Elekahia (Zones
E, F, and C) had low vulnerability levels, whereas Eligbolo
(Zone D) had very low vulnerability level. These were
mapped, and the spatial pattern revealed that the vulnerabil-
ity levels in Port Harcourt metropolis tend to increase toward
the north west, south west, south, and north east and decrease
toward the central, and the major determinant was the prox-
imity of the 13 zones to a major river/stream/creek.
Finally, the study has demonstrated that some areas in
Port Harcourt metropolis are indeed more vulnerable to
flooding than others. Therefore, the vulnerability map pro-
duced from this study, which shows the spatial pattern of dif-
ferent flood vulnerability levels can be used for the reduction
of damage potential by integrating its outputs into spatial
planning and emergency planning in Port Harcourt
metropolis.
