Abstract The housing search process is an overlooked mechanism in the scholarly
research that seeks to understand the causes of persistent racial residential segre-
gation in the United States. Past research has explored in detail the preferences
people hold in terms of the racial and ethnic composition of their neighborhoods,
and more recently some have also examined the correspondence between racial and
ethnic neighborhood preferences and current neighborhood racial/ethnic composi-
tion. But an intermediate stage--the racial/ethnic composition of where people
search--has not been investigated. We analyze a subsample (n = 382) from the
2004­2005 Chicago Area Study to demonstrate the value of systematically studying
the matches--or mismatches--between preferences, search locations, and neigh-
borhood outcomes. We find that for whites, not only their current neighborhoods but
also the neighborhoods in which they search for housing have larger percentages of
whites than they say they prefer. In contrast, blacks--and to a lesser extent Lati-
nos--search in neighborhoods that correspond to their preferences, but reside in
neighborhoods with a larger percentage own group. Logistic regression analyses
reveal that mismatches are associated with both a lack of information and inade-
quate finances, but also may be due to socially desirable responding for whites in
particular. Our results provide suggestive evidence of the importance of unpacking
the search process more generally and draw attention to what are likely to be

Introduction
Racial and ethnic residential segregation remains high for blacks and is growing for
Latinos in the United States (Timberlake and Iceland 2007; Logan and Stults 2011).
Racial residential preferences are one of the three main explanations offered by
scholars seeking to understand continued racial residential segregation in the United
States (e.g., Clark 1992; Schelling 1971). Although some work demonstrates that
residents prefer to live among co-ethnics (e.g., Charles 2006), it is also the case that
many Americans express a desire for some racial and ethnic diversity in their
neighborhoods. Latinos and African Americans, however, express this desire more
than whites (e.g., Charles 2006; Farley et al. 1994). At the same time, most
Americans live in neighborhoods with mostly people of their own race (Crowder
et al. 2012; Iceland et al. 2002). One possible reason for this mismatch is that people
answering survey questions about neighborhood racial preferences feel a need to
provide interviewers with socially desirable answers. People might want to think of
themselves as tolerant and over-state their true desire for diversity (e.g., Krysan
1998; Krysan and Couper 2003). They therefore actually search for housing, this
argument goes, in neighborhoods with less diversity than they say they prefer.
Alternatively, people might honestly desire the level of diversity they report to
interviewers but that desire for diversity is outweighed by other factors in the
housing search. That is, people may need to choose between neighborhoods based
on the neighborhood's racial diversity, ease of travel to jobs, school quality, and
affordability (among other neighborhood features), and they might value the latter
neighborhood characteristics more than its racial diversity. Relatedly, with
comparatively few integrated neighborhoods in any given metropolitan area, the
possibility of finding a neighborhood with the desired level of integration might be
relatively small. This is complicated by the fact that racial composition tends to
correlate with other neighborhood characteristics (e.g., Krysan et al. 2009), making
it even harder to satisfy all criteria in the housing search. The tension between stated
preferences (those that respondents tell interviewers) and revealed preferences
(those preferences inferred by people's actions) has been thoroughly debated in the
literature (e.g., Vasanen 2012).
But missing from this debate is that both of these explanations rely on the
assumption that the ultimate move residents make reflects the outcome of choices
made during a search process. The housing search process--and especially its
racial and ethnic dimensions--is something that is largely unstudied. The social
desirability explanation would maintain that people do not search for housing in
areas as diverse as they say they want. The revealed preferences literature would
suggest that people do search for housing in diverse neighborhoods but compromise

on their preference for diversity for other neighborhood amenities. Regardless of
which of these interpretations is correct, what is clear is that the process that links the
stated preferences and revealed preferences--the actual housing search--has not been
studied systematically. The purpose of this analysis is to begin to do just that. We use
the most detailed data available on expressed racial preferences and housing searches,
combine it with theoretically grounded expectations about why preferences, searches,
and outcomes may be (mis)matched, and thereby provide an exploratory analysis
intended to lay the groundwork for future data collection and theorizing about housing
searches and their role in shaping neighborhood racial patterns.1
Specifically, to demonstrate the value of focusing on the search process, we use
the 2004­2005 Chicago Area Study (CAS). For reasons we will delineate, these data
are not ideal; however, this is the most complete data available which include
residents' stated racial residential preferences, retrospective residential search
histories in 41 communities in the Chicago metropolitan area, and current
residential location, thus enabling us to examine how racial and ethnic composition
between these three types of communities (where people prefer, where they search,
and where they live) might differ. In doing so, we begin to shed light on the search
process as an overlooked mechanism that can help explain the perpetuation of racial
residential segregation nearly a half-century after the end of the Civil Rights
Movement and the passage of the Fair Housing Act. Drawing on spatial
assimilation, place stratification, and housing information theories, we explore the
possible direction of (mis)matches between the racial and ethnic composition of
where people say they would ideally like to live, where they searched for housing,
and where they currently live. Two main research questions guide our analysis: (1)
Do whites, blacks, and Latinos search for housing and reside in neighborhoods they
say they prefer in terms of the neighborhood's racial and ethnic composition and (2)
what factors contribute to a mismatch between preferences, the racial/ethnic
composition of search locations and the current neighborhood?
Previous Research
Many studies investigate racial and ethnic residential preferences, with most of
them using a show card method in which respondents evaluate hypothetical
neighborhoods that show varying degrees of racial and ethnic diversity (e.g., see
Farley et al. 1994, 1978). This research demonstrates that an individual's race is an
important factor in shaping neighborhood preferences. Whites tend to favor
predominantly white neighborhoods, while blacks prefer integrated neighborhoods
(i.e., a 50 % white, 50 % black neighborhood) and see `all white' but also `all black'
1 Note that this emphasis on housing searches can shed light on how racial residential segregation is
perpetuated--or how it can be reduced--and it can also inform the lively debate throughout social
sciences on the issue of neighborhood effects. Specifically, there is a thorny selection problem in any
studies trying to understand how one's neighborhood impacts a range of outcomes, including health for
example. The question is whether the neighborhood impacts one's health, for example, or whether people
who are unhealthy ``select'' a certain kind of neighborhood. By focusing on the search process, and
understanding how people end up living where they do, we can inform this debate (Krysan et al. 2014).

neighborhoods as least desirable (Bobo and Hutchings 1996; Clark 1991; Farley
et al. 1994; Krysan and Farley 2002). For their part, Latinos favor a 50 % Latino,
50 % white neighborhood over an `all Latino' neighborhood (Charles 2005).
Because the original show card method created only a limited set of racial
compositions and because it showed only two groups at a time (Farley et al. 1978),
Charles (2000) created a different survey instrument in which respondents were
asked to create their ideal neighborhood composition. Using this tool, Charles
(2006) found that all groups drew quite integrated neighborhoods but also had a
preference for at least a substantial number of co-ethnics that exceeded the share of
any other outgroup. This was true for all groups, but especially for whites.
More recently, studies seek to uncover the factors that underlie these ethnic
neighborhood preferences. Vignette experiments, in which respondents were
presented with hypothetical neighborhoods in which relevant neighborhood
characteristics systematically varied, have been successfully used to separate
ethnic/racial motivations from socioeconomic concerns. These studies indicate that
part of the racial preference patterns can indeed be attributed to neighborhood
concerns that are related to race, such as poverty or crime (Emerson et al. 2001;
Krysan et al. 2009; Lewis et al. 2011; St. John and Bates 1990). However, race itself
remains an important factor in shaping residential preferences.
Studies have begun to investigate how these stated racial residential preferences
correspond to the actual neighborhood racial composition of an individual. Clark
(1992) demonstrated that although most blacks preferred an integrated black­white
neighborhood, only 7 % realized this preference. Among whites and Latinos, most
realized their preference for either a predominantly white (for whites) or
predominantly Latino (for Latinos) neighborhood. Importantly, however, of those
who preferred an integrated neighborhood, a large majority still moved to a
neighborhood that was predominantly inhabited by their own group.
Freeman (2000) examined the role of racial/ethnic preferences in residential
attainment processes, while taking into consideration household income, wealth,
and other background characteristics. He showed that black and Latino preferences
for living with whites were positively related to the percentage white in the
respondent's actual neighborhood. Similarly, Ihlanfeldt and Scafidi (2002)
concluded that blacks with a stronger preference for black neighborhoods are also
more likely to reside in such neighborhoods, though they maintained that
preferences played only a minor role in residential attainment. Finally, Adelman
(2005) demonstrated that preferences do not perfectly correspond with actual
neighborhoods. His study in Atlanta, Boston, Detroit, and Los Angeles showed that
middle-class blacks who prefer to live in a racially integrated neighborhood live on
average in neighborhoods that are 60 % black and 30 % white, while middle-class
whites who prefer racially integrated neighborhoods reside in predominantly white
neighborhoods (i.e., on average 85 % white).
Overall, the above studies showed that--although residential preferences
correlate with actual compositions--generally respondents live in neighborhoods
with more co-ethnics than they report preferring. The purpose of this study is to
draw attention to the intermediate stage between preferences and outcomes--
namely, the housing search process itself--as a possible mechanism for
E. Havekes et al.
123
understanding how this (mis)match occurs. Treating the housing search as the
intermediate stage between what people say they want and what they have, we can
imagine at least two ways a mismatch can occur. A mismatch between preferences
and current neighborhood composition could occur because people might not search
in neighborhoods that match their preferences (henceforth, we refer to this as Stage
1) or they might search in preferred neighborhoods but end up living in
neighborhoods that do not match the search locations (i.e., Stage 2).
To date, there are only a few studies that examine the role of racial composition
in housing searches. Krysan (2008) found that in the Detroit metropolitan area
whites mainly search in all white communities, whereas blacks explore more varied
types of neighborhoods, ranging from predominantly white to predominantly black.
Relatedly, Krysan and Bader (2007) investigated the Detroit-area neighborhoods
people would ``seriously consider'' and ``never consider.'' Whites mainly consider
predominantly white neighborhoods as serious options, while blacks would
seriously consider neighborhoods with large as well as small percentages of blacks.
Bader and Krysan (2015) replicate their research in the Chicago area and find that
the patterns of whites' racial matching and blacks' openness to communities of
many racial compositions. They find that Latinos were open to many communities,
but search patterns emulated white preferences after controlling for economic
factors.
In the present study, we examine the neighborhood preferences of whites, blacks,
and Latinos and their relationship to the racial and ethnic composition of
neighborhoods in which they searched for housing and in which they currently
live. Although we are highlighting a new way to think about the causes of racial
residential segregation--by focusing on the housing search process--we draw on
existing theories of spatial assimilation, place stratification, and housing information
to inform our understanding of why mismatches might occur and how housing
searches contribute to them. The existing models emphasize constraints during the
process of neighborhood selection that result in a mismatch between preferences
and outcomes. Yet, the nature of the constraints highlighted by these theories differs
and they are likely to operate at different stages of the process. In the following, we
discuss these theories and elaborate on who is likely to have a mismatch, in what
stage, and in which direction.2
2 As noted above, an alternative to these substantive explanations for the mismatch is a methodological
one: individuals may state a preference for more diversity in their neighborhoods than they actually desire
due to social desirability pressures to report more liberal racial attitudes in a survey interview. Existing
research suggests this bias is stronger for whites than African Americans; little is known about its
influence on Latinos (Krysan 1998; Krysan & Couper 2003). In all cases, however, we expect social
desirability pressures to be strongest for the measure of residential preferences, and so its contribution to
possible mismatches is greater at stage one of the process, where individuals do not search in
neighborhoods that match their preferences in the first place because those preferences for diversity are
over-stated.

123
Who is Likely to Have a Mismatch, at What Stage, and in Which
Direction?
The spatial assimilation model (Alba and Logan 1993; Massey 1985) argues that the
ability of individuals to realize their residential desires is a function of a household's
opportunities and constraints--particularly socioeconomic. Socioeconomic
resources (such as income and education) increase a household's available choice
of alternatives in the housing market (De Groot et al. 2011) so that mismatches
between preferences and outcomes may be due to inadequate socioeconomic
resources to actualize preferences. Applying this model to our research, (a lack of)
socioeconomic resources might create a mismatch at either stage. First, people may
search in neighborhoods similar to their preferences, but those places might turn out
to be financially unattainable (Stage 2). Additionally, households might consider
their financial possibilities when making a first selection of possible neighborhoods
to search and, hence, a lack of socioeconomic resources might also prevent people
from searching in neighborhoods that match their preferences (Stage 1).
We expect the role of socioeconomic resources in shaping the direction of
mismatches to function differently for whites, blacks, and Latinos, because of the
relationship between neighborhood socioeconomic characteristics and neighbor-
hood racial/ethnic composition. The racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods
is strongly related to its socioeconomic status. Neighborhoods with substantial
African American and Latino populations (as compared to white populations) are
generally associated with socioeconomic disadvantage and poverty (e.g., Charles
2003; Krivo et al. 2009). Consequently, a lack of socioeconomic resources for
blacks and Latinos would likely result in more `own group' members in their
neighborhood than they prefer, while for whites, fewer resources will result in fewer
`own group' members than they prefer.
The place stratification model (Alba and Logan 1993; Massey 1985) emphasizes
institutional barriers that have their origin outside of the household as the primary
driver of segregation. This model expects racial and ethnic minority groups to be
less likely to realize their residential preferences because of discrimination. Housing
discrimination could influence the housing search by generating mismatches at both
stages. First, a person might search in a particular neighborhood, but be deterred
from living thereby discriminatory actions by real estate agents, landlords, or loan
officers. This would create a mismatch between the search locations and outcomes
(Stage 2). Given patterns of discriminatory treatment, this would be most likely to
affect African Americans and Latinos.
But geographic steering, a less direct form of discrimination that continues to be
uncovered by audit studies (Turner and Ross 2005) is another way that place
stratification theories can shed light on the housing search process. Specifically,
geographic steering is the idea that different racial and ethnic groups are shown
different kinds of neighborhoods during the search process. This likely decreases the
opportunity to search and reside in neighborhoods that match racial and ethnic
preferences. Since geographic steering takes place when people are searching for a
place to live, it may be especially influential on the neighborhoods in which people
E. Havekes et al.
123
search for housing (and, thus, constitute a mismatch in Stage 1). The direction of
steering and its impact on mismatches varies depending on the race and ethnicity of
the searcher. Specifically, whites are encouraged to consider predominantly white
and more affluent neighborhoods, whereas blacks and Latinos are steered to a more
restricted number of less affluent minority neighborhoods (Farley 1996; Turner and
Ross 2005). In this way, processes of geographical steering might lead to whites,
blacks, and Latinos both searching and subsequently residing in neighborhoods that
have a larger percentage of their own group than they prefer.
Finally, housing information theories emphasize a factor that is largely neglected
in traditional spatial assimilation and place stratification arguments, i.e., knowledge
of housing options, which may influence the mismatch between preferences and
search locations in particular (i.e., Stage 1). This fits in the general category of the
cognitive resources used in housing searches (O
¨ zu
¨ekren and Van Kempen 2002),
but for our purposes, we focus specifically on knowledge of the communities in
which one might search (e.g., see Krysan and Bader 2009). Specifically, insufficient
knowledge of the housing market may prevent people from searching in
neighborhoods that match their preferences, resulting in a mismatch between
residential preferences and actual spatial patterns. To successfully find housing in
neighborhoods that meet the wishes of residents in terms of racial/ethnic
composition, residents need at least some knowledge about the possible commu-
nities in their search area that fit their preferences (Brown and Moore 1970; Krysan
and Bader 2009). It is unlikely (though not impossible) that people search in
communities they know nothing about, or at least the search costs of gathering
information about these communities are higher (Krysan and Bader 2009).
Additionally, knowledge of the specific neighborhoods in an area has an important
impact on where people eventually end up living (Clark 1986).
To the extent that knowledge differs for racial/ethnic groups and to the extent that
knowledge varies depending on the racial/ethnic composition of the neighborhood,
then this knowledge can help us to understand who experiences mismatches in the
search process, and in which direction. Krysan and Bader (2009) showed, for
example, that Latinos have less general knowledge about different communities in
the Chicago metropolitan area and African Americans' generally less knowledge
about overwhelmingly white and distant suburbs might complicate the search for
housing in more integrated neighborhoods. Whites, on the other hand, are less aware
of racially mixed--even those that are diverse but still majority white--neighbor-
hoods. Hence, whites, blacks, and Latinos alike have better knowledge of
neighborhoods dominated by their own racial/ethnic group and this might lead to
searches (and moves) to neighborhoods that have larger percentages of their own
group than they would prefer.
Finally, to the degree that individual searches are informed by social networks,
we may find that individuals both search and reside in neighborhoods with greater
percentages of their own group because these likely race-homogenous networks
provide information that is similarly racially homogenous. In particular, individuals
who search using informal methods, such as relying on family and friends, may be
more likely to search in places with greater numbers of co-ethnics than they desire.
This is because social networks tend to be racially segregated, and so the search
Realizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...
123
information provided by these networks may be less varied, as social capital
theorists would predict (Granovetter 1973). More specifically, since social networks
tend to be racially and ethnically segregated and community knowledge is shaped
by race, those who rely on their network when searching for housing may be more
likely (compared to those who use, e.g., newspaper ads or real estate agents) to
search in neighborhoods with a greater percentage own group than they might
prefer.
The extant theories of residential segregation processes just reviewed have clear
expectations about how the housing search process unfolds; importantly, though,
these expectations are often implicit and almost always unmeasured. In this paper,
we offer a rare and exploratory but systematic look at elements of this process. By
assessing the mismatches--and where they occur--we can offer ideas about future
data collections and, importantly, policy interventions that might break the cycle of
segregation that the outcomes of these searches perpetuate.
Data and Measures
Chicago Area Study
We use data from the 2004/2005 Chicago Area Study, a cross-sectional3 survey
consisting of a multistage area probability sample (stratified by neighborhood racial/
ethnic composition) representative of adults 21 years and older living in households
in Cook County, Illinois (which includes the city of Chicago and many surrounding
suburbs). In addition to residential preferences, these data include retrospective
information on housing searches and the racial/ethnic composition of current
neighborhoods. Black and Latino respondents and those living in racially mixed
neighborhoods were oversampled. A total of 789 respondents were interviewed
face-to-face between August 2004 and August 2005 (response rate: 45 %). For the
purpose of our research, we have insufficient numbers of other racial/ethnic groups
to do separate analyses, and so we limit our study to white, black, and Latino
respondents (n = 769 in the total sample, though as noted below our analyses are
limited to a smaller subset).
Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences
Following Charles (2000), to measure racial and ethnic neighborhood preferences
respondents were asked to imagine a neighborhood that had the racial/ethnic mix
3 The cross-sectional nature of our data bears special mention since we measure preferences, search
locations, and outcomes all at a single point in time. Therefore, issues of causal direction remain uncertain
as preferences might not only influence the choice for a particular neighborhood, but experiences during
the search process and the racial/ethnic composition of the current neighborhood might also affect
people's preferences. Our data do not allow us to address this problem of reverse causality. Instead, our
goal is to illuminate the degree to which preferences differ from searches and current neighborhood
conditions and the individual factors associated with possible mismatches. As we note in the conclusion
of the paper, we fully acknowledge the limitations of our data, but we argue that it is the best we have and
is suitable for our purposes of illuminating this understudied element of segregation processes.

they personally would feel most comfortable living in (the exact question wordings
of the main survey questions used in our analyses can be found in the appendix).
Next, they were presented a card showing a neighborhood with 15 houses of which
the middle house represented their own house (see Fig. 1). Respondents used the
letters `W' for white, `B' for black, `L' for Latino, `AS' for Asian American, and
`AB' for Arab American, to fill out their ideal neighborhood racial/ethnic
composition. We calculated the percentage of houses that were of the respondent's
own racial/ethnic group. Respondents who did not complete the housing card were
listwise deleted (n = 18). To reduce the possibility of socially desirable responses,
as much as possible respondents were matched to an interviewer of similar race or
ethnicity. In our final sample, 75 % of the respondents were interviewed by
someone of their own race.
Racial/Ethnic Composition of Search and Current Neighborhood
Respondents were also shown a booklet of maps that labeled 41 communities in the
Chicago metropolitan area (see Fig. 2), including neighborhoods in the city of
Chicago (n = 15 of the total 77) as well as suburban communities (n = 26 of the
total 288). Inside the city of Chicago, the communities represent administrative
boundaries (so-called Communities Areas) that are well known among Chicago area
residents, and roughly correspond to `neighborhoods.' Suburban communities are
administrative boundaries defined by the census as `census designated places'
(CDPs) that usually align with community jurisdiction boundaries. The 41
communities identified on the map were purposively selected to cover substantively
important categories (e.g., a range of different racial compositions, different housing

prices, locations, etc.) and to be sure that areas would likely be known to a fair
number of Chicago residents (i.e., very small communities were excluded). Table 1
compares the racial and ethnic composition of the neighborhoods and communities
that were shown on the map (Column 1) with those that were not (Column 2).
Communities with populations over 85 % white (``all white'' neighborhoods) are
underrepresented on the map, whereas racially/ethnically mixed communities are
overrepresented compared to their presence in the entire Chicago metropolitan area.
Respondents marked all the identified neighborhoods on the map in which they
had searched for housing in the past 10 years. We removed those respondents
(n = 209) who had lived for more than 10 years at their present address and had not
actively searched for housing in the meantime. There were also a total of 160
respondents who did search for housing in the past 10 years but who indicated that
they had not searched for housing in any of the 41 communities shown on the map.
These were also removed from our analytic sample, resulting in a final sample size
of 382 (123 white, 114 black and 145 Latino respondents).4
Fig. 2 Map provided to the respondents as a tool to indicate their search locations
4 Additional analyses indicated that in the removed subsample (i.e., those who did not search for housing
in the past 10 years and those who did not search in one of the 41 communities), whites, blacks, and older
people are slightly overrepresented. Furthermore, the omitted respondents are slightly more likely to have
an own group neighborhood preference and to live in a neighborhood with larger shares of their own
group. Nevertheless, patterns of mismatches between preferences and current neighborhoods are similar
to the ones found in the analytic sample.

current neighborhood, based on 2000 census tract statistics.5
Measuring Mismatches
To measure if whites, blacks, and Latinos search for housing and reside in the
neighborhoods they say they prefer we calculated the percentage of respondents in
each racial/ethnic group that searched and currently reside in neighborhoods with a
similar, larger or smaller percentage of their own racial/ethnic group than in their
ideal neighborhood. If the average percentage of own racial/ethnic group in the
search locations or in the current neighborhood of a respondent falls within a range
of plus or minus 15 % compared to the percentage own group in their ideal
neighborhood, we considered preferences and search locations/current neighbor-
hood to be a `match.' Preferences measured using the neighborhood cards are not
continuous (they increase in increments of 7 % for each additional house) and,
hence, this 15 % difference equals approximately the addition (or subtraction) of
two same-race neighbors from a respondent's neighborhood card. This means that
respondents who have a mismatch should have added or removed at least two
houses on the preference card to match their average search locations and current
neighborhood. Similarly, the percentage of respondents who reside in a neighbor-
hood with a similar, larger, or smaller percentage of own group than in their average
search location were calculated.
The variables percentage own racial/ethnic group in respondents' ideal neighbor-
hood, average search neighborhood, and current neighborhood as well as their
associated mismatches are summarized in Table 2. All presented analyses use a weight
that incorporates a selection weight and an adjustment for nonresponse (which was the
inverse of the response rate in each primary sampling unit). Furthermore, they account
for the clustered nature of our sampling approach, using Stata's ``svy'' command.
Descriptive Results
We start this section with an overview of the search behaviors of whites, blacks, and
Hispanics in the Chicago metropolitan area. The number of indicated search locations
ranged from 0 to 41, but on average respondents indicated 3.6 communities on the map
in which they had actively searched for housing in the past 10 years. The number of
communities in which people reported searching differs among racial and ethnic
5 We acknowledge that the variation in the geographical scale of the neighborhoods in the various
measurements could in itself create a mismatch in racial and ethnic composition. The show card used for
the ``ideal'' neighborhood implies a small area (See Fig. 1), whereas the ``current'' and ``searched''
neighborhood measures use larger census tracts and communities. Mismatches might arise either because
individuals may attach particular importance to the racial/ethnic composition of their immediate (micro)
neighborhood (rather than the larger community), or because individuals live in a micro neighborhood
that matches their preferences but that is located in a larger community that does not match. Yet, we
believe that this possible bias is similar for whites, blacks, and Latinos. It seems, therefore, unlikely that
differences in the geographic scale of neighborhoods across our measurement instruments could account
for racial/ethnic differences in the degree of mismatch.

groups, whereas whites indicated on average 2.8 search communities, Hispanics and
blacks generally searched in 4.2 and 4.8 communities, respectively.
The average distance between the communities where respondents said they
searched for housing and the respondents' current neighborhood is 13.3 km. The
distance is largest for blacks (17.8 km), followed by whites (12.3 km), and
Hispanics (11.4 km). The distance between the average search communities and
current neighborhoods is smaller than the average distance between the 41
communities on the map and the current neighborhoods (20.9 km). This suggests
that people tend to focus their searches on geographically proximate areas. Due to
the cross-sectional and retrospective nature of the data, we cannot make too much of
this finding, however, since we do not know where the respondent was living when
they undertook the search they are reporting about (it could have been their current
neighborhood; it could have been somewhere else altogether).
Table 3 presents an overview of the mean stated racial/ethnic neighborhood
preferences, racial/ethnic composition of the search locations, and the composition
of the current neighborhood for whites, blacks, and Latinos. First, Panel A shows
that all groups drew rather diverse neighborhoods but they also prefer to live in a
neighborhood with at least a substantial number of co-ethnics. This is especially true
for whites and less so for blacks (F = 6.00, p \ 0.05) and Latinos (F = 18.84,
p \ 0.01). Second, all groups currently reside in a neighborhood in which the
majority of residents belong to their own racial/ethnic group, though this pattern is
stronger for whites (F = 20.31, p \ 0.01) and blacks (F = 7.31, p \ 0.01) than for
Latinos (Panel B of Table 3). Panel C shows that whites mainly search in
neighborhoods with a substantial proportion of their own group and this is less
prominent for blacks (F = 48.60, p \ 0.01) and Latinos (74.5, p \ 0.01). Blacks
and Latinos search in neighborhoods with a substantial proportion of their own
group but even larger shares of whites (Panel C of Table 3).
Table 4 identifies the percentage of respondents who have a (mis)match in
various combinations of the percentage of their own racial/ethnic group in (1) their
ideal neighborhood; (2) their current neighborhood; and (3) their search locations.
Panel A reports the extent to which racial/ethnic preferences are reflected in the
composition of the neighborhoods where respondents currently live. The majority of
white (68 %), black (64 %), and Latino respondents (56 %) live in neighborhoods
that have more of their own racial/ethnic group than they say they prefer (statistical
tests do not reveal differences across groups on this measure). Panel B of Table 4
shows, furthermore, that the majority of whites in our sample (52 %) search in
neighborhoods with a larger share of their own group than they say they prefer. This
percentage is significantly larger compared to 21 % of blacks (F = 14.2, p \ 0.01)
and 29 % of Latinos (F = 6.63, p \ 0.05). A majority of blacks (62 %) and a
plurality of Latinos (47 %) search in neighborhoods that match their preferences
with respect to the percentage own group.6 Finally, Panel C of Table 4 shows that
nearly two-thirds of whites generally reside in neighborhoods that match the
6 Additional analyses in which we calculated if at least one search location (instead of the average
location) matched their ideal neighborhood, showed a similar pattern. Blacks (and to a smaller extent
Latinos) search more often than whites in at least one neighborhood that matches their preferences in

of whites is almost double the approximately one-third of blacks (F = 6.27,
p \ 0.05) and Latinos (F = 8.59, p \ 0.01) who live in neighborhoods with similar
proportions of own-group residents as the communities in which they searched.
Most blacks (60 %) and Latinos (56 %), on the other hand, reside in neighborhoods

with a larger share of their own group than in the average neighborhood they
searched for housing.
In sum, whites both seem to search and reside in neighborhoods with a larger
percentage own group than they say they prefer. These descriptive results imply that
whites experience a mismatch in an early stage of the residential process (i.e., Stage
1); namely, they do not search in neighborhoods that match the racial composition
they say they prefer. Meanwhile, blacks and Latinos search in neighborhoods with
their preferred percentage of own group, but they live in neighborhoods with larger
percentages of their own group than those in which they searched (and those which
they preferred). As a result, we conclude that blacks and Latinos experience a
mismatch at the later stage of the process (i.e., Stage 2) since they reside in
neighborhoods that have both more of their own group than they desire, and also
than the neighborhoods in which they searched.
What Factors are Related to Mismatches?
Our primary aim in this study is to explore the extent to which housing searches
match preferences and outcomes; we also laid out a theoretical framework that
suggests a range of possible explanations for these mismatches. The preceding
group-level analyses suggest that mismatches do occur, and that their patterns are
generally consistent with a number of possible explanations. Data constraints--in
particular, small sample sizes and a lack of longitudinal data--do not permit a
detailed analysis of the individual-level predictors of a mismatch at the two stages.
However, our dataset includes a number of variables that allow us to explore the
individual-level factors associated with mismatches. We examine who is more
likely to have ``too many'' of their own group by examining its relationship to
socioeconomic resources, information resources and experiences of self-reported
housing discrimination, variables that correspond to spatial assimilation, place
stratification, and information theories.
Estimating Correlates of Stage One Mismatches Among Whites
In exploring which factors are related to a mismatch, we focus on the most common
kind of mismatch within each racial and ethnic group. For whites, we model the
Stage 1 mismatch: the probability that whites search in a neighborhood with more
whites than in their ideal neighborhood (Table 5). Based on our theoretical
framework, the relevant factors are measures of knowledge (i.e., whites might not
know about the places that match their preferences) and education (to capture social
desirability effects which operate more strongly among the more highly educated).
Information resources were measured by a respondent's knowledge about different
neighborhoods in the Chicago metropolitan area that we obtained by asking which
neighborhoods on the map (identical to Fig. 2) they did not know anything about.
We used the number of neighborhoods a respondent indicated as a measure of a
general lack of knowledge of the housing market. To assess whether respondents
had racially/ethnically biased knowledge of the housing market, we calculated the
Realizing Racial and Ethnic Neighborhood Preferences?...
123
average percentage of a respondent's own group in the neighborhoods they
indicated they do not know anything about and compared this to the average
percentage own group in the neighborhoods which they did not indicate (and thus
presumably do know about). We created a dummy variable identifying those
respondents for whom the average percentage own group in the neighborhoods they
do know is larger than in the ones they do not know. We controlled for how many
years the respondent has lived in the metropolitan area since people who have lived
longer in the area likely know more about the places in it. We measured a
respondent's education with four dummy variables: less than high school degree,
high school degree, some college but less than a Bachelor's degree, and Bachelor's
degree or higher (reference).
The results from Table 5 indicate that whites who possess greater knowledge of
white neighborhoods than integrated ones search in neighborhoods with more
whites compared to their stated ideal neighborhood. White preferences mismatched
their search neighborhood 55 % of the time for whites who possessed greater
knowledge of white neighborhoods, compared to 33 % of whites with less racially
biased knowledge of neighborhoods.7 We found no association between education
and a mismatch between stated preferences and searches.
Estimating Stage Two Mismatches Among Blacks and Latinos
We concentrate on the mismatch at Stage 2 for Blacks and Latinos: the probability
that blacks and Hispanics reside in a neighborhood with more own group than in the
average search location (Table 6). Here the relevant factors are income (i.e., blacks
and Latinos might not be able to afford to live in the neighborhoods where they
search for housing) and experience with discrimination (i.e., they might face
barriers after searching in these neighborhoods). We measured household income in
four categories: \$20,000; $20,000­39,999; $40,000­79.999; and [$80,000

(reference). Self-reported housing discrimination was measured by three items.8
Respondents answered ``yes'' or ``no'' to the following questions: (1) whether or not
they ever felt they were denied housing by a landlord or real estate agent because of
their race/ethnicity, (2) whether or not they ever felt that a real estate agent was
showing them only homes in certain neighborhoods because of their race/ethnicity,9
and (3) whether or not respondents ever lived in a neighborhood where neighbors
made life difficult because of their race/ethnicity. We combined these items into a
summary scale of self-reported housing discrimination, running from 0 (did not
experience any of these) to 3 (experienced all three).
Table 6 shows that blacks in the lowest income category (i.e., \$20,000) are
more likely to reside in a neighborhood with more co-ethnics than in the average
neighborhood in which they searched for housing. This finding suggests that black
residents with low incomes may search in neighborhoods similar to their racial
preferences but be unable to afford those neighborhoods, a finding that supports the
predictions of the spatial assimilation model.
Conclusion and Discussion
Past research has examined the association between preferences for particular racial
and ethnic neighborhood compositions, and the composition of the current
neighborhood. In this paper, we draw on novel data that allow us to provide a
preliminary look at how an important intermediate step--the search for housing--
influences these relationships. Overall, our results draw attention to the value of
examining the search process that precedes the final choice when studying the

correspondence between residential preferences and behaviors in particular, but also
as an important component to the perpetuation of racial residential segregation.
In line with earlier research that focused only on the differences between
residential preferences and current neighborhood racial/ethnic composition without
information on the search itself (e.g., Adelman 2005; Clark 1992), we found that
residents generally live in neighborhoods with a larger percentage of their own
racial/ethnic group than they report preferring. Yet, our study goes beyond these
earlier ones because we find interesting racial and ethnic differences in the stage at
which these disparities arise, thus emphasizing the value of studying the search
process in relation to residential attainment. Our results suggest that whites
experience a mismatch between preferences and behavior at an early stage of the
residential process: they generally do not search in neighborhoods that match their
preferences. In contrast, blacks--and to a lesser extent Latinos--are more likely to
search in neighborhoods that more closely correspond to their preferences in terms
of their own racial and ethnic group, but when it comes to where they actually live,
their neighborhoods have larger percentages of blacks and Latinos, respectively.
The greater degree of match for blacks and Latinos in their search locations and
preferences suggests that the explanation for the mismatch between where they
prefer and where they actually live should be sought in constraints that prevent the
final choice from being the one that matches residential preferences rather than in
the choice of search destinations in the first place.
Although our data limit the extent to which we can test a range of theoretical
explanations for mismatches at an individual level, our analyses does point to some
hints about the sources of the mismatches we observe. For whites, we find that the
racial blind spots that Krysan and Bader (2009) identified--such that whites are less
likely to be aware of racially diverse neighborhoods--may play a role in the
mismatch. That is, white Chicago residents with bigger racial blind spots were the
significantly more likely to search in communities that had more whites than they
said they prefer. Although education did not predict mismatches, which would have
been consistent with a social desirability interpretation, this is a rather weak test.
Thus, we suggest that it is still possible that the mismatch for whites at Stage 1 is
due in part to whites not being as open to integrated neighborhoods as they say they
are. Influenced by social desirability, it may be that whites report a preference for
integrated neighborhoods when in fact they favor predominantly white neighbor-
hoods, contributing to a discrepancy between preferences and residential behaviors.
That whites do not search in neighborhoods that match their reported preferences is
consistent with this interpretation.
However, there are other possibilities apart from social desirability.10 For
example, it could be that the relative availability of neighborhoods in the
metropolitan area that approximate whites' racial and ethnic preferences is
unfavorable. Whites say they prefer a rather diverse neighborhood as long as
whites constitute the largest racial/ethnic group. Although these diverse neighbor-
hoods are overrepresented on the search location map (see Table 1), which would
imply we overestimate the chances that there will be a match, we see that whites end

up living in predominantly white neighborhoods. So, relatively rare as they are, our
maps actually increased the possibility for a match between whites' ideal diverse
neighborhoods and being able to report on our maps that they searched in one.
Nevertheless, whites (in contrast to blacks and Latinos) live in the most ``available''
type of neighborhoods, i.e., predominantly white neighborhoods. This means that
the relative availability of neighborhoods could play a role in the mismatch we
found.
Furthermore, it may be that people tend to start searching close by their current
residence (wherever that might be). If this is the case, and in light of patterns of
segregation, for whites, these `nearby' neighborhoods are more likely to be white
neighborhoods as well (whereas for blacks and Latinos there is a greater chance that
the nearby neighborhoods are more diverse). This spatial dynamic of searches
therefore precludes more diversity in whites' search locations. Additionally, it may
be that the `daily routines' of whites may be particularly circumscribed, translating
into less exposure to diverse neighborhoods and therefore, a lower likelihood that
there is sufficient knowledge to seriously consider diverse neighborhoods as
destinations.11
With respect to the mismatches of blacks and Latinos, we find some suggestion
of the role of spatial assimilation for blacks. That is, blacks with an income of less
than $20,000 are more likely to reside in a neighborhood with more blacks than in
their search locations. These results also lend indirect support to the place
stratification model, since the searches may have been unsuccessful due to
discriminatory barriers that discouraged blacks and Latinos from residing in the
more integrated neighborhoods that they prefer. Although our self-reported measure
of housing discrimination did not reveal significant findings, as we noted, we have
no measure of actual discrimination experienced by the searchers.
Our study draws attention to a number of directions for future research that put
the spotlight on the search process itself as critical to understanding residential
outcomes. For example, all we know from our survey data is that a person searched
in a particular neighborhood--we do not know what they learned about the
neighborhood or what they experienced in it when they searched. It may be, for
example, that neighborhoods that are similar to whites' preferences for more
integrated neighborhoods come with race-related factors that stopped them from
even searching in these neighborhoods. Indeed, some scholars have asked whether
people really have a preference for a particular racial and ethnic composition, or
whether these preferences are driven by socioeconomic concerns instead (Harris
2001). Outcomes of vignette experiments indicate that part of the racial preference
patterns found in studies using the show card method can be attributed to
neighborhood concerns that are related to race, such as poverty, criminality, and bad
school quality (Emerson et al. 2001; Krysan et al. 2009; Lewis et al. 2011; St. John
and Bates 1990). Nevertheless, the racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods
11 This might imply an interaction between `general lack of knowledge' and ``composition of the
neighborhoods about which the respondent claims little knowledge'' as a predictor of the mismatch
between preferences and search locations. In separate analyses (not shown) we included this as a predictor
but it was not statistically significant. It may be that the small sample sizes are responsible for this null
finding.

remained an important and independent factor in shaping residential preferences. In
addition, taking into account socioeconomic factors of the neighborhood, Crowder
(2000) and Crowder and South (2008) demonstrate that the racial and ethnic
neighborhood composition is still an important determinant of whites' residential
mobility. Understanding the manner by which whites determine where to search--
and the role of race/ethnicity versus social class--is of great importance.
Overall, in examining the racial and ethnic composition of neighborhoods in
which people searched for housing, we seek to highlight the potential role that
housing searches play in contributing to the discrepancy between residential
preferences and current neighborhood racial and ethnic composition, in particular.
More broadly, however, our goal is to bring systematic attention to the role of
housing searches to the residential attainment processes and their stratified
outcomes. Our data have several limitations, but these suggestive results draw
attention to the need to better understand the housing search process and call for the
identification of data collection and research design strategies that can address them
and provide a more decisive answer to the broader theoretical frameworks that
underlie our analyses.
In interpreting our results, several of these shortcomings should be kept in mind.
First, we used a non-random sample of 41 communities on our map of the Chicago
metropolitan area. For those who prefer white neighborhoods, the proportion of
neighborhoods on the map that match their preferences is smaller than they in fact
are. Similarly, for those who prefer racially and ethnically mixed neighborhoods,
the proportion of neighborhoods on the map is larger than they would encounter in
Chicago as a whole. It is hard to determine what consequences of imperfectly
measuring the relative racial and ethnic distribution of neighborhoods has for our
observed mismatches. Yet, given that a majority of respondents say they prefer very
mixed areas, we believe that it most likely reduced mismatches because respondents
had more opportunities among the 41 to choose their ideal (which many said was
racially mixed).
Second, the use of cross-sectional data means that we cannot draw causal
inferences. With respect to the correlate of mismatches, for example, we have
measured income at the time of the survey, not at the time of the search; it is very
possible that economic constraints were very different at the two times. In addition,
with respect to our key measures of interest, information on preferences and current
neighborhood were measured at the same time, and information on respondents'
searches (though not their reporting of them) predated statements of preferences.
Because of this, we cannot rule out the possibility that residents adjusted their
preferences based on their search experiences. Similarly, not only searches, but also
people's current neighborhood might have informed racial residential preferences as
they were measured simultaneously in time. This might have affected our results in
two ways: it might have either underestimated mismatches in the case of people
who could not realize their initial preference but adjusted their attitudes to the
situation in the current neighborhood (or based on their search experiences) or
overestimated mismatches for those residents who search or reside in a neighbor-
hood that matched their original preferences but--for whatever reason--change
their preferences.
E. Havekes et al.
123
Thus, we clearly do not have the appropriate temporal order of preference,
search, and move data. We ask respondents to indicate their current preferences,
fully aware that their past searches and current residences might influence their
current racial preferences. Future research should prospectively investigate
residential preferences and where people move. Such a study is obviously
complicated by the fact that the very nature of moving makes following respondents
difficult; the payoff, however, would be clear insight into an area potentially ripe for
intervention--encouraging residents to search in neighborhoods with their stated
level of diversity even if it is not on their initial list of search destinations.
This focus on housing searches not only has value in terms of social science
debates and understanding of the causes of residential segregation as well as
neighborhood selection processes that relate to a range of `neighborhood effects'
research, but also there are significant policy implications as well. Indeed, the U.S.
Department of Housing and Urban Development recently issued a 5-year Research
Roadmap (Office of Policy Development and Research 2013), citing one of HUD's
four programmatic goals to ``Build inclusive and sustainable communities free from
discrimination.'' The Research Roadmap identified a number of top priority research
projects to accomplish this goal, including one that examined the housing search
process of racial and ethnic minorities. Understanding this process was identified as
foundational for a number of core HUD programs and policies, including the
Housing Choice Voucher program, housing integration strategies, and discrimina-
tion testing and enforcement. As the Roadmap notes,
...HUD does not know how households search for housing and what their
preferences are when searching for housing. This research will shed light on
how housing search and preference affect HUD's fair housing/Affirmative
Furthering Fair Housing goals and how they promote or deter goals to build
inclusive communities (2013, p. 98).
Our research contributes to this policy debate, suggests next steps, and reinforces its
importance.
The present study is, therefore, a first step in pointing out the mismatch between
stated preferences, search locations, and outcomes. The results compel future
research to gather new large-scale longitudinal data in which residential preferences
and complete housing search and neighborhood careers can be followed over time to
test our causal implications and to take into account the full set of possible
residential destinations. It is also important for future studies to link these housing
careers to information about individual socioeconomic resources, housing market
knowledge and local discrimination to understand more thoroughly the relevance of
the housing search for interpreting spatial assimilation, place stratification, and
information models. Using an innovative dataset that measured for the first time the
search locations of residents of a major metropolitan area, we have drawn attention
to the possibility of the mismatch between stated preferences, search locations, and
outcomes in general, and the importance of examining more carefully the search
process in particular if we hope to better understand the way in which racial
residential segregation is perpetuated--or the possibilities for helping to break it
down.

Table 7 Exact question wording of main (non-demographic) survey questions
Variables/predictors Exact question wording
1. Racial/ethnic composition of ideal
neighborhood (racial/ethnic neighborhood
preferences)
Now I would like you to imagine an ideal
neighborhood that had the ethnic and racial mix you
personally would feel most comfortable in. Here is a
card that shows a neighborhood with several houses
in it. Using the letters W for Whites, B for Black, H
for Hispanic, As for Asian American and AB for
Arab American, please put a letter in each of these
houses to represent your ideal neighborhood where
you would most like to live.
2. Racial/ethnic composition of search locations This is a booklet of maps of the Chicago metropolitan
area. The map shows major roads and several
communities as well as specific areas in the city of
Chicago. For each of the questions I ask, please
mark all of the communities or towns that fit your
answer. On the third map, mark the communities
where you have searched for a house or apartment in
the past 10 years
3. Knowledge about different neighborhoods in
the Chicago metropolitan area
On this first map, please mark any communities that
you don't know anything about
4. Reported housing discrimination Now I would like you to ask about several experiences
you might have had when looking for housing
Have you ever felt that you were denied housing
because a landlord or real estate agent didn't want to
sell or rent to you because of your race or ethnicity?
Have you ever felt that a real estate agent was
showing you only homes in certain neighborhoods
because of your race or ethnicity?
Have you ever lived in a neighborhood where
neighbors made life difficult for you or your family
because of your race or ethnicity?
