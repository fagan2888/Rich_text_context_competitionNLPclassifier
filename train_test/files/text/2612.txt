OBJECTIVEdTo determine whether the relationship between age and physical and mental
health varies by diabetes status in older U.S. adults.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdUsing data from the National Social Life,
Health, and Aging Project, a national sample of 3,005 adults aged 57­85 years, we tested the
significance of the interaction between age and diabetes in association with health states.
RESULTSdRespondents with diabetes in the youngest age cohort had more medical condi-
tions than those without diabetes, a difference that narrowed with age (P for interaction ,0.01).
The youngest cohort with diabetes had a higher rate of depression compared to those without
diabetes (14 vs. 8%). Depression declined with age and did not differ by diabetes status in the
oldest respondents (P = 0.01 for age-diabetes interaction).
CONCLUSIONSdDiabetes differentially affects self-rated overall health and depression by
age, with convergence in the oldest age-group with and without diabetes.

Individualizing care of type 2 diabetes
(1), particularly for older patients (2),
has become a priority. Age influences
the diabetes phenotype and therefore pa-
rameters guiding individualization of care.
Earlier-onset type 2 diabetes is often more
severe and insulin deficient (3,4), has a
higher relative and absolute risk of mortal-
ity (5), and allows more time for complica-
tions to develop (6). Age also influences
patient-specific illness perception. Older
patients often have less diabetes-related
distress than younger ones (7).
Our goal in this report was to deter-
mine whether diabetes differentially im-
pacts physical and mental health by age.
We hypothesized that diabetes would have
a greater impact on self-reported physical
and mental health in middle age than in
old age comparing persons with diabetes
with those without diabetes within age
cohorts.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODSdWe obtained permis-
sion to use data from the National Social
Life, Health, and Aging Project (NSHAP),
a national area probability sample of
community-dwelling Americans age 57­85
years. Detailed in-home interviews of re-
spondents selected from the U.S. popula-
tion in a stratified random sample were
conducted in English and Spanish in
2005­2006. Of 4,017 eligible subjects,
3,005 participated (75.5%). Survey meth-
ods and procedures have previously been
described (8). The institutional review
boards of the University of Chicago and
the National Opinion Research Center ap-
proved the NHSAP protocol; the Partners
HealthCare Institutional Review Board
deemed this analysis exempt.
Demographic information and medical
conditions were obtained byself-report (9).
Diabetes diagnosis was based on an af-
firmative response to the following ques-
tion: "Has a medical doctor ever told you
that you have . . . diabetes or high blood
sugar?"
Outcome variables included comor-
bidity score, depression, and self-rated
physical and mental health. The comor-
bidity score summed available self-reported
conditions excluding diabetes (9). Symp-
toms of depression were assessed using
an 11-item version of the Center for Epide-
miological Studies-Depression (CES-D)
scale in which a score of $9 indicates de-
pression (10,11). Physical health and men-
tal health were self-rated as excellent, very
good, good, fair, or poor; responses were
dichotomized into poor and fair versus
good, very good, and excellent. Health sta-
tus relative to peers was rated much better,
somewhat better, about the same, some-
what worse, or much worse, with responses
dichotomized into somewhat and much
worseversusaboutthesame,somewhatbet-
ter, and much better.
All analyses were conducted using
SAS software, version 9.2 (SAS Institute,
Cary, NC) with statistical procedures (proc
surveymeans, proc surveyfreq, and proc
surveyreg) that accounted for the complex
sampling design using weights to adjust for
the probabilities of being selected to par-
ticipate in the study and of not responding
based on demographic and survey stratifi-
cation characteristics. We tested the signif-
icance of the interaction of age-group and
diabetes for each outcome variable.
RESULTSdDetails of demographic and
clinical characteristics of the cohort can be
found in Supplementary Table 1. The total
comorbidity score tended to increase in
both groups with age, but among subjects
with diabetes the score started from a
higher baseline and rose less steeply,
showing a significant interaction between
diabetes and age-group (P = 0.02) (Fig. 1A).
The CES-D score decreased with age
among diabetes respondents and increased

with age among respondents without dia-
betes, converging among respondents in
the oldest age-group (P for difference be-
tweendiabetesandnondiabetesintheoldest
age-group = 0.31; P for age-diabetes inter-
action = 0.002) (Fig. 1B); results were sim-
ilar when CES-D score was dichotomized
to indicate depression (Fig. 1C).
The relationships between self-rated
physical health, health relative to peers,
and mental health by diabetes status and
age are shown in Fig. 1D­F with the P value
for the crude interaction term. Among re-
spondents with diabetes, 18% rated their
physical health fair or poor in the 57­64
years age-group, decreasing to only 10% of
the oldest age group, while 6­7% of
respondents without diabetes rated their
health fair or poor across all age-groups
(P = 0.006 for age-diabetes interaction)
(Fig. 1D). Health status relative to peers
showed a more pronounced pattern (P for
difference between diabetes and nondiabe-
tes in the oldest age-group = 0.16; P for age-
diabetes interaction = 0.04) (Fig. 1E). Poor
or fair self-rated mental health showed a
similar pattern, though the age-diabetes in-
teraction was not significant (Fig. 1F).
In multivariable models predicting
depression and poor or fair self-rated phys-
ical health, the interaction between diabe-
tes and age was significant after adjustment
for sex, ethnic group, and education level
(Supplementary Table 2).
CONCLUSIONSdIn this national area
probability sample of community-dwelling
Americans aged 57­85 years, depression
and the perceived burden of disease differed
by age and diabetes status. Respondents
with diabetes had more comorbid condi-
tions than those without diabetes across
the age spectrum, but depression and
self-rated health were significantly worse
chiefly in respondents with diabetes aged
57­74 years compared with peers with-
out diabetes; the oldest age cohort with
diabetes did not rate themselves much
differently from their peers without
diabetes.
While nationally representative, the
findings are limited by their cross-sectional
nature, the lack of information on du-
ration of diabetes, and, possibly, diabetes
self-report, though diabetes self-report is
highly valid in older populations (12). In
addition, respondents from different gen-
erations may differ in how they rate their
symptoms of depression and their overall
health. NSHAP did not distinguish between
type 1 and type 2 diabetes. Most diabetes
in the population age .57 years is type 2
diabetes, and the majority of people af-
fected by type 2 diabetes are in the age-
group sampled.
Despite these limitations, this report
demonstrates that the experience and per-
ception of diabetes differ by age. Several
studies have identified an age-diabetes in-
teraction (13,14). We expand this prior
work by showing that while some among
the old may have poorly controlled diabe-
tes (3,15), the physical and psychological
burden, in general, appears to be greater
in middle-aged groups. These findings
suggest a role for more aggressive medical
and psychological care in middle-aged
patients with diabetes, while prioritizing
diabetes within the context of other prob-
lems among older patients.
