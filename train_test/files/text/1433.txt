OBJECTIVE -- Using population-based data, we estimated the prevalence of diabetes, im-
paired fasting glucose, and elevated HbA1c
(6%) levels in U.S. adolescents.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- The Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (1988­1994) examined a representative sample of the U.S. population,
which included 2,867 adolescents aged 12­19 years who had serum glucose measured.
RESULTS -- A total of 13 adolescents in the sample were considered to have diabetes; 9
reported using insulin, 2 reported using oral agents only, and 2 did not report any treatment but
had high glucose levels (11.1 mmol/l regardless of length of fast or 7.0 mmol/l after an 8-h
fast). Four of these cases (31% of the sample with diabetes) were considered to have type 2
diabetes. The estimated prevalence of diabetes (all types) per 100 adolescents ages 12­19 years
was 0.41% (95% confidence interval 0­0.86). The prevalence of impaired fasting glucose (6.1
mmol/l) among adolescents without diabetes who had fasted for at least 8 h was 1.76% (0.02­
3.50). The prevalence of elevated HbA1c
(6%) was 0.39% (0.04­0.74).
CONCLUSIONS -- National data reflect the presence of type 2 diabetes in U.S. adolescents,
but the survey sample size was not large enough to obtain precise prevalence estimates because
of the relatively low prevalence.
Diabetes Care 24:834­837, 2001
Type 2 diabetes in adolescents may be
on the rise in North America, espe-
cially among minority populations
(1,2). Population-based studies have re-
ported high prevalence estimates of type 2
diabetes in American-Indian adolescents
(3,4), but such estimates are not available
for other ethnic groups. Published data
include clinical case series and therefore
exclude undiagnosed cases and cases not
referred to large pediatric centers (2).
Cases have also been reported of adoles-
cents with type 2 diabetes who were mis-
classified as having type 1 diabetes (2).
Still, in large pediatric centers, diagnosed
type 2 diabetes was recently reported to
account for 8­45% of the new cases of
diabetes (2). Thus, the true prevalence of
type 2 diabetes (i.e., reported diagnosed
and undiagnosed) might not lag far be-
hind that of type 1 diabetes in adoles-
cents. The reports of diagnosed cases of
type 2 diabetes might also represent the
tip of the iceberg of insulin resistance in
the U.S. pediatric population.
In 1988­1994, the Third National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES III) recruited a representative
sample of U.S. adolescents aged 12­19
years who had serum glucose measured
(5). We estimated the national prevalence
of diabetes, impaired fasting glucose, and
elevated HbA1c
(6%) levels in U.S. ad-
olescents aged 12­19 years in 1988­
1994.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- NHANES III, which
was conducted by the National Center for
Health Statistics of the Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention, comprised a
probability sample of the U.S. civilian
noninstitutionalized population selected
by a complex multistage sampling design,
with over-sampling of the black and Mex-
ican-American populations (5). Adoles-
cents were asked during a household
interview to show the interviewer all of
the medications they were taking. All
medications related to diabetes were later
coded as glucose regulators. At the subse-
quent examination, adolescents were
asked if they were currently using insulin.
Each adolescent was randomly
assigned to either a morning or an after-
noon/evening examination session. Ado-
lescents scheduled for a morning exami-
nation were instructed to fast at least 8 h,
and those scheduled for an afternoon/
evening examination session were in-
structed to fast at least 6 h. Adolescents
known to be taking insulin were in-
structed not to fast before the examina-
tion. Serum glucose level was measured
with a Hitachi Model 737 multichannel
analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim, India-
napolis, IN) in participants 12 years of
age as part of a standard battery of bio-
chemical assessments (6). HbA1c
was
measured in whole blood with a Diamat
automated high-performance liquid

chromatography system (model 723; Bio-
Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA). The co-
efficients of variation were 0.8% for
serum glucose and 1.73 and 1.57% for
two HbA1c
pools (6). BMI was calculated
as weight in kilograms divided by height
in meters-squared. BMI percentiles were
calculated based on the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention growth
charts and were age and sex specific (7).
The prevalence of diabetes was calcu-
lated for those adolescents who attended
any physical examination and had glu-
cose measured (n  2,867). The preva-
lence of impaired fasting glucose was
calculated for the subsample of adoles-
cents who were assigned to the morning
half-sample, attended a morning exami-
nation, and fasted for at least 8 h (n 
1,083). The prevalence of elevated HbA1c
was calculated for all adolescents who at-
tended any physical examination and had
HbA1c
measured (n  2,852).
Adolescents were classified as having
diagnosed diabetes if they reported using
oral hypoglycemic agents or insulin. Ad-
olescents were classified as having undi-
agnosed diabetes if they did not report
using oral agents or insulin but they had a
serum glucose value 11.1 mmol/l re-
gardless of length of fast or a serum glu-
cose value 7.0 mmol/l after a fast of 8 h
or more (8). We considered adolescents
on oral treatment only and adolescents
with undiagnosed diabetes as having type
2 diabetes. Adolescents without diabetes
who had fasting glucose 6.1 and 7.0
mmol/l were classified as having impaired
fasting glucose (8). Adolescents without
diabetes who had HbA1c
6%, which
corresponds to the mean plus two stan-
dard deviations in this population, were
classified as having elevated HbA1c
.
SAS (9) was used for data manage-
ment, and SUDAAN (10) was used to ac-
count for the complex sample design, to
compare groups, and to compute appro-
priate standard errors for prevalence esti-
mates. Separate weights were used for the
entire examined sample and for the de-
fined half-sample assigned to the morning
examination session to account for the
complex survey design, differential non-
response, and planned oversampling (5).
Thus, inferences may be made to the pop-
ulation of these ages in the U.S. in 1988­
1994.
RESULTS -- Of 3,234 adolescents
aged 12­19 years, glucose was not mea-
sured for 367 and HbA1c
was not mea-
sured for 240. Non-Hispanic white
adolescents were more likely than non-
Hispanic black adolescents to have HbA1c
measured (94 vs. 90%, respectively, P 
0.009), and those with HbA1c
measured
were somewhat older than those without
(mean age 15.9 vs. 15.6 years, respec-
tively, P  0.04). No other significant dif-
ferences in sex, ethnicity, or overweight
status were observed. Of the 1,166 ado-
lescents with no insulin treatment who
participated in the morning examination,
were asked to fast for at least 8 h, and had
glucose measured, 84 reported not fast-
ing. Of the 2,858 adolescents with no in-
sulin treatment who were asked to fast for
at least 6 h and had glucose measured,
562 reported not fasting. In each of the
two groups, age, sex, ethnicity, and over-
weight status were not statistically differ-
ent between those who did and those who
did not fast.
Of 2,867 adolescents who had glu-
cose measured, 13 were classified as
having diabetes (Table 1). Of these 13 ad-
olescents, 9 reported using insulin and 2
were taking medications other than insu-
lin. Two other adolescents who were not
being treated for diabetes had glucose lev-
els in the diabetic range (8.4 and 15.3
mmol/l); both had elevated HbA1c
(8.4

kg/m2 or 99th and 94th BMI percentile
for age and sex). Of the 13 adolescents we
classified as having diabetes, the 4 not us-
ing insulin (probable type 2 diabetes
cases) were non-Hispanic black or Mexi-
can-American.
Of the 1,083 adolescents who were
assigned to and examined in a morning
examination and fasted for at least 8 h, 20
had impaired fasting glucose and did not
meet the criteria for diabetes (Table 2). Of
the 2,852 adolescents who attended any
examination and had HbA1c
measure-
ment, 22 had an HbA1c
level 6% but did
not meet the criteria for diabetes. Only 10
adolescents with HbA1c
6% had glucose
measured in the morning sample and in
the fasting stage. Only 3 of these 10 had
both elevated HbA1c
and impaired fasting
glucose, all were from minority groups,
and all had BMI 30 kg/m2 and the 97th
percentile. Two adolescents had HbA1c
7% but did not meet the criteria for di-
abetes or impaired fasting glucose; one
had a glucose level of 7.4 mmol/l mea-
sured in a nonmorning sample after fast-
ing for only 6 h (BMI at the 59th percen-
tile), and the other had a morning fasting
glucose of 4.7 mmol/l (BMI at the 81st
percentile).
Inferences to the U.S population were
made using sampling weights. We esti-
mated that the prevalences of diabetes,
impaired fasting glucose (no diabetes),
and elevated HbA1c
(no diabetes) in the
U.S population aged 12­19 years in
1988­1994 were, respectively, 0.41%
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0­0.86),
1.76% (0.02­3.5), and 0.39% (0.04­
0.74). Thus, we estimated that 100,000
U.S. adolescents had diabetes, 500,000
had impaired fasting glucose, and
100,000 had elevated HbA1c
.
CONCLUSIONS -- NHANES III data
reflect the presence of type 2 diabetes in
the pediatric population. Of the four ad-
olescents considered to have type 2 dia-
betes, none were on insulin treatment; all
four were members of minority groups,
and all four had elevated BMI values. Two
of these four cases were probably undiag-
nosed. On the other hand, no case of mis-
classification between type 1 and type 2
diabetes was suspected. In this small sub-
sample, type 2 diabetes accounted for
31% of the cases of diabetes.
The numbers of cases of diabetes, im-
paired fasting glucose, and elevated
HbA1c
were small; the prevalence esti-
mates of diabetes and impaired fasting
glucose were low; and the CIs were large.
For 2,867 adolescents tested for diabetes,
11 already knew they had diabetes, and
only 2 had undiagnosed diabetes. For
1,083 adolescents without diabetes who
fasted for at least 8 h, 20 had impaired
fasting glucose, a risk factor for type 2
diabetes. The age group 12­19 (during or
past puberty years) probably includes the
pediatric age at highest risk for type 2 di-
abetes (2), and the design oversampled
two minority populations at high risk.
However, the sample size was not large
enough to provide stable estimates in a
general pediatric population with low
prevalence. This contrasts with the use-
fulness of other population-based studies
conducted in high-risk pediatric popula-
tions. Recent prevalence estimates for
type 2 diabetes were 3.6% for Cree and
Ojibway girls aged 10­19 living in Mani-
toba (3) and 5% (CI 3.2­6.9) for Pima
Indians aged 15­19 living in Arizona (4).
From 1966­1976 to 1987­1996, the
prevalence increased fourfold for Pima
Indian children aged 10 to 14 years and
sixfold for children aged 15 to 19 years.
Similarly, prevalence estimates for im-
paired fasting glucose were 3% for girls
aged 15­19 years in Quebec (11), 3% for
boys and 6% for girls aged 10­19 years in
Ontario (12), and 2.7% for children aged
4­19 years in Saint Theresa Point in
Manitoba (3).
Several features of our analysis should
be underlined. First, NHANES III was un-
dertaken between the years 1988 and
1994, and the increase in diagnosed pedi-
atric type 2 diabetes reported in hospital
case series was particularly noticeable af-
ter 1994 (2). Second, some data on treat-
ment were self-reported, and omissions
or misclassifications may have occurred.
Third, it is also possible that a few more
adolescents may have undiagnosed diabe-
tes, but they may not have fasted for the
time required for meeting the American
Diabetes Association criteria (8). One ad-
olescent had indeed a glucose level of 7.4
mmol/l and an HbA1c
level of 7.1%, but
we considered her as nondiabetic be-
cause she was scheduled for an afternoon/
evening examination and only fasted for
6 h. However, there was little difference in
age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI between the
groups that did or did not fast or attend an
examination.
The low prevalence of diabetes and
impaired fasting glucose in U.S. adoles-
cents whom we describe here by no
means diminishes the public health im-
portance of the emergence of type 2 dia-
betes in the pediatric population (2).
Because the complications of diabetes are
linked to duration, onset at an early age is
likely to lead to increasing health prob-
lems early in adulthood. The disease has
only recently been recognized and has
probably recently increased in the general
pediatric population. Because of the in-
creasing prevalence of obesity, which has
reached high levels in U.S. youth (13) and
the expected population growth of mi-
nority groups (14), it is likely that the
prevalence of type 2 diabetes in adoles-
cents will also increase in the future, as it
already has among American-Indian
youth (1­4).
These data, despite their limitations,
may raise questions on the respective val-
ues of HbA1c
and impaired fasting glucose
to identify adolescents at risk for type 2 di-
abetes. Adolescents with HbA1c
6% were
somewhat likely to be non-Hispanic blacks
and to have high BMI, which are risk fac-
tors for type 2 diabetes, and this was not
as obvious for adolescents with impaired
fasting glucose. Only three adolescents
who reported fasting for at least 8 h had
both elevated HbA1c
and impaired fasting
glucose. HbA1c
has indeed been reported
to be a good predictor of the later develop-
ment of type 2 diabetes in Pima Indian
children (M.M. Gabir and W.C. Knowler,
personal communication) and is discussed
as a screening test in adults (15). Further
studies comparing HbA1c
and random,
fasting, or postload glucose levels in ado-
lescents will be useful to develop strate-
gies for screening or case findings for
adolescents at risk for diabetes.
In conclusion, NHANES III data re-
veal the presence of type 2 diabetes in the
U.S. pediatric population, but the preva-
lence of type 2 diabetes among U.S. ado-
lescents appears to be quite low in 1988­
1994. Because the prevalence is low, it is
difficult to arrive at precise estimates of
prevalence from surveys of the general
population. At a time when the disease
is emerging, other population-based
approaches to ascertain incidence and
prevalence, e.g., within more defined
populations at higher risk of type 2 dia-
betes, may be required to identify trends
in type 2 diabetes in adolescents. The
Centers for Disease Control and Preven-
tion recently embarked on a new research
Diabetes in adolescents: NHANES III data
836 DIABETES CARE, VOLUME 24, NUMBER 5, MAY 2001
program to address this issue. Because
type 2 diabetes may also represent the tip
of the iceberg of insulin resistance in the
U.S. pediatric population, studying im-
paired fasting glucose and other predia-
betic conditions is also necessary.
