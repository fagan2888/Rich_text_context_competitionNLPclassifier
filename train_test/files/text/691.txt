and Psychological Distress Among Older People:
A Cross-Cultural Analysis

Objectives. This article examines how financial strain and social relations may independently and jointly influence
psychological distress among older people in four nations.
Methods. Data from four Western Pacific nations (N = 3,277) are used to test additive and multiplicative models of
the relationships between financial strain, social relations, and psychological distress.
Results. Financial strain is associated with higher levels of psychological distress in three of the four nations. Inter-
active models of the effects of financial strain and social relations on distress were uncovered in three of the four na-
tions, but the type of social relation influencing the strain-distress relationship varied. Subjective health and IADLs
were significant predictors of psychological distress in all four nations.
Discussion. Findings suggest that although financial strain is quite likely to lead to psychological distress among el-
ders, this can be mitigated, at least in part, by social relationships. Modernization was not associated with higher psy-
chological distress.
THE question of how social relations influence the psy-
chological distress of elders has attracted considerable
attention in the past two decades, much of it as part of the
avalanche of research on caregiving. The findings from this
literature have been both insightful and inconsistent. Per-
haps the greatest inconsistencies arise regarding the effects
of social exchanges on morale and well-being. Some stud-
ies have shown that giving aid increases elders' psycholog-
ical well-being (Stoller, 1985), whereas others have shown
that giving aid decreases elders' psychological well-being
(Mutran & Reitzes, 1984). Findings concerning the receipt
of aid are also inconsistent. The link between receiving aid
and psychological well-being has been reported as positive
(Mutran & Reitzes, 1984), negative (Lee, Netzer, & Cow-
ard, 1995), or nonsignificant (McCulloch, 1990).
Although the inconsistency in findings from the litera-
ture points to the need for further research, there have also
been notable insights from research in the past decade. We
suggest that four recurrent findings are especially useful for
resolving the inconsistencies and advancing the research,
especially as it pertains to the link between social relations
and psychological distress. First, it is now clear that the
complexity of social relations makes it imperative to differ-
entiate integration in social structures from relational con-
tent (House, Umberson, & Landis, 1988). Social integra-
tion refers to the quantity of relations and frequency of
contact, whereas relational contact refers to social ex-
changes and the quality of relations (Schwarzer & Leppin,
1991). With this distinction in mind, the literature points
increasingly to how social integration influences the types
and consequences of exchange. A second major finding
from the literature is importance of negative interactions in
heightening psychological distress among older adults
(Krause, 1995; Ingersoll-Dayton, Morgan, & Antonucci,
1997). Negative interactions are less prevalent as age in-
creases, but more consequential to psychological distress
(Rook, 1984, 1997). Third, the financial status of the elder
is related to psychological distress and may also shape the
content of social relations (Krause & Liang, 1993; Whelan,
1993). The material wealth of an elder may well compen-
sate for aid received in other domains because the cost to
the other partner(s) is minimized.
Finally, although main effects of social relations on psy-
chological distress are anticipated (Schwarzer & Leppin,
1991), recent research shows the importance of testing con-
ditional relationships. The types of conditional relations
uncovered vary, but two forms have been noted repeatedly.
First, psychological distress among older people is often
influenced by the interaction of giving and receiving (e.g.,
Krause, 1995). If people give help, then the effect of re-
ceiving help is typically positive (i.e., balanced exchange
relations). On the other hand, if the older person is unable
to offer assistance, then receiving help may lead to a nega-
tive outcome (Wethington & Kessler, 1986). Second, social
relations often interact with stressors in shaping psycholog-
ical distress. Beyond what one would expect on the basis of
main effects, previous research has shown that social rela-
tions are likely to moderate distress as people face health
problems, the death of a spouse, or financial strain (e.g.,
Kahn & Antonucci, 1980; Silverstein & Bengtson, 1994).
Moreover, financial strain involves anxiety about subsis-
tence but it may also lead to problems in social function-

ing, especially with family and friends (Krause & Liang,
1993). Thus, social integration and exchange are important
for understanding how financial strain influences psycho-
logical distress.
Most of these recent contributions to the understanding
of social relations and psychological distress derive from
studies in the United States or other modern, Western soci-
eties. In contrast, the present study uses a cross-cultural
perspective for understanding how social relations influ-
ence psychological distress among older people. Given the
dearth of studies examining the joint effects of financial
strain and social relations on psychological distress, these
relationships are highlighted here. The rationale for the
comparative analysis of four Western Pacific nations is
twofold.
First, the comparative perspective may shed new light on
the understanding of social relations and psychological dis-
tress, especially discussions of the universality of cross-
generational support and its consequences for older adults
(Bengtson, 1995). There are studies that examine social re-
lations and either well-being or distress in other developed
countries such as France (Grand, Grosclaude, Bocquet,
Pous, & Albarede, 1988) and Ireland (Whelan, 1993) and
among Korean immigrants to Canada (Noh, Wu, & Avison,
1994), but little attention has been given to less-developed
nations. Moreover, cross-cultural studies of these relation-
ships, especially quantitative ones, are rare (Krause, Jay, &
Liang, 1991). The approach taken here is to determine
whether social relations influence psychological distress
in a similar way among older adults in diverse societies
(Hashimoto, 1993). The strategy is to "increase the diver-
sity in sociocultural factors and look beyond the boundaries
of any one cultural system" (Fry, 1997, p. 138). Patterns
consistent across societies and observed in the extant litera-
ture merit special attention.
Second, Dowd's (1975) widely cited article on develop-
ing a social exchange theory of aging concluded by offering
two propositions, one of which focused on the comparative
approach. Noting how exchanges may operate differently in
traditional and modern societies, Dowd argued that the
"amount of power resources possessed by the aged relative
to other age strata is inversely related to the degree of soci-
etal modernization" (Dowd, 1975, p. 591). If this is the
case, elders in more modern societies may be especially
vulnerable to financial strain and both social and economic
dependency. The four nations studied in the present re-
search are at different stages of modernization, thereby per-
mitting us to examine how the effects of financial strain and
social relations on psychological distress may vary by de-
gree of societal development.
Aging and Exchange in Comparative Perspective
As people enter advanced old age, they face the risk of
becoming dependent on others for help. They may not face
the risk of dependency in every area of life--from finances
to personal care--but the question of dependency is a piv-
otal one in the everyday lives of older people and has been
discussed at length in several sociological theories of aging.
Social exchange theory focuses on the give-and-take of so-
cial life, but does not presume that human interaction is a
simple matter of quid pro quo. Instead, stable relationships,
especially those among kin, are dependent to some degree
upon investments in the relationships that may not be com-
pensated directly (Yamagishi & Cook, 1993). The willing-
ness to provide help to older people may be due to many
reasons, but it is most often seen in light of the contribu-
tions the elder has made over the life course. In a sense,
people develop "credit" from the contributions they make
to others. Blau (1964) observed, "As individuals regularly
discharge their obligations, they prove themselves trust-
worthy of further credit" (p. 98).
After a lifetime of typically giving more to younger per-
sons than they received from them, elders must increas-
ingly come to accept beneficence, especially if they lack
power resources such as wealth (Dowd, 1984). The benefi-
cence most often comes from family members--spouses,
siblings, adult children--but in some situations it may come
from community or government initiatives. Although most
elders have established social credit from past contribu-
tions, receiving beneficence is nonetheless difficult for
many. Receiving beneficence reveals the commitment of
the giver to the elder, and this is often reassuring to the
older person (Krause, 1995). At the same time, however, it
shows that the elder has less to offer to balance the relation-
ship (Wentowski, 1981). In cases where the elder perceives
an imbalanced exchange, the inability to reciprocate may
make the elder feel awkward, and may perhaps even lead to
depressed affect. It appears elders have fared reasonably
well by drawing from social credit in traditional societies
(Silverman & Maxwell, 1978; Simmons, 1945), but debate
ensues on whether this applies to non-Western societies and
how modernization may alter filial piety and the structure
of beneficence to older people (Cox, 1990; Haber & Grat-
ton, 1994; Sung, 1995).
Findings from major U.S. studies show that most elders
have at least one adult child living within 35 miles of them
and that geographic location shapes not only face-to-face
contact but telephone contact and emotional support as well
(Rossi & Rossi, 1990). The prevalence of routine assistance
is described in most U.S. studies as "modest," with between
25% and 33% of all parents receiving some type of support
from their adult children; advice and emotional support are
the most common (Bengtson & Harootyan, 1994; Eggebeen,
1992; Hogan & Eggebeen, 1995). Help from parents to
adult children is generally less prevalent, but Cooney and
Uhlenberg (1992) show that the frequency of such aid varies
substantially over the life course. Using data from the Na-
tional Survey of Families and Households, they found a
fairly sharp decline in support from parents after their chil-
dren reached 30 years of age. The role of older American
parents and grandparents appears to be that of providing
help when major needs or emergencies arise, leading schol-
ars to describe them as "family watchdogs" (Troll, 1983) or
the "family national guard" (Hagestad, 1985).
In contrast to the United States and other Western na-
tions, most Asian and Western Pacific nations display a
much higher rate of intergenerational coresidence and a
greater flow of intergenerational support. Just how much of
this is due to modernization as opposed to filial piety and
generational norms is difficult to determine, but even in
FINANCIAL STRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS S5
more modernized societies such as Japan, Hong Kong, and
the Republic of Korea, routine aid to elders is typically
more prevalent than in the West (Keith & Hong, 1994;
Keith et al., 1994). Whatever the reason, the differences are
striking, especially with regard to financial exchanges.
While only about 3^1-% of adult American children regu-
larly provide financial assistance to their parents (Egge-
been, 1992), about one third of the Chinese elders in Krause
and Liang's (1993) study reported such financial assistance.
In Shi's (1993) study of rural Chinese, approximately two
thirds of the elders reported receiving financial aid (see also
Treas & Wang, 1993). The rates are lower in Korea (Ahn,
1982) and Japan (Nishio, 1994), but still much higher than
in most American families, suggesting the confluence of
culture and modernization on intergenerational exchanges.
Modernization ushered in not only longer life, but a
longer period of "old age," including retirement (Cowgill,
1986; Cowgill & Holmes, 1972; Haber & Gratton, 1994).
People reaching advanced older ages in modern societies,
therefore, are more likely to risk depleting major power re-
sources accumulated over the life course (Cox, 1990; Pal-
more & Manton, 1974). According to Blau (1964), there are
four basic power resources: money (and material goods),
approval, esteem, and compliance. Compliance, or yielding
to the will of others, is very costly, and is typically used as
a last resort in exchanges. Dowd (1975) argued that it may
be one of the few power resources that elders have avail-
able for exchange relations. Compliance by elders usually
makes them more dependent, and their growing depen-
dency may make them feel awkward. Indeed, some re-
search shows that unbalanced relationships--when elders
feel that they are receiving more than they can give--have
detrimental effects on morale (e.g., Lee et al., 1995).
Although money is but one of the power resources, it is
clearly one of the most influential to exchange processes.
Moreover, material wealth of an elder may well compen-
sate for aid received in other domains. Krause and Liang
(1993) showed that financial strain was the strongest pre-
dictor of psychological distress among Chinese older per-
sons, and Whelan (1993) reported a parallel finding in Ire-
land. Despite the importance of financial adequacy to the
exchange processes, most studies simply use education
(McCulloch, 1990) or income (Lee et al., 1995; Mutran &
Reitzes, 1984). These indicators are limited for understand-
ing socioeconomic status and exchange processes in a sin-
gle country (Henretta & Campbell, 1976) and of limited
utility in cross-cultural comparisons. The present study
considers financial strain, along with aid given and aid re-
ceived, to understand how social relations influence psy-
chological distress.
To summarize, the approach used in this article is com-
parative, permitting an examination of how sociocultural
context shapes the way in which social relations influence
psychological distress. If relationships are found to exist in
each of the four nations studied, this would provide evi-
dence pointing to universality, or at least greater generaliz-
ability. We articulate several hypotheses for this investiga-
tion. First, we hypothesize that financial strain is directly
and positively related to psychological distress among older
people (Krause et al., 1991; Whelan, 1993). Second, con-
sistent with many previous studies, we hypothesize that
social integration will be directly and negatively related to
psychological distress (Arling, 1987; Krause & Liang, 1993).
Third, because contributions to the social order by elders
often help balance exchanges, we anticipate that elders who
contribute to family and community function will have
lower distress (Lee et al., 1995).
Fourth, we hypothesize that elders receiving family finan-
cial support will have higher psychological distress, due to
what Krause (1997) refers to as the "downside of received
support." Although receiving support may intuitively be
seen as reducing distress--because of needs being met--
there is evidence from previous research that reception of
aid may carry with it a realization of growing dependency or
even failure (Wethington & Kessler, 1986). Krause observes
that this downside of received support is even more likely
when financial strain is the issue at hand. Fifth, we expect
higher psychological distress among elders in the more
modernized societies due to the emphasis upon productivity
and independence (Cox, 1990; Gutmann, 1977).
Finally, we expect that the effect of financial strain on
psychological distress will be either dampened or exacer-
bated by social relations. Three interaction hypotheses are
articulated: (a) financial strain coupled with low levels of
social integration will lead to higher psychological distress;
(b) financially strained elders who report giving to family
and community relationships will be less likely to manifest
distress; and (c) financially strained elders who report re-
ceiving family financial support will manifest higher psy-
chological distress. Given the different social and cultural
contexts considered and multicollinearity among the prod-
uct terms, it is unlikely that all three interaction hypotheses
will be supported in all nations. However, at least one form
of social relations is expected to condition the effect of fi-
nancial strain on psychological distress in each nation.
METHOD
Sample
Interview data for this study came from the 1983-1985
survey Social and Health Aspects of Aging in Fiji, Korea,
Malaysia, and the Philippines (N = 3,577), which was spon-
sored by the World Health Organization. The same ques-
tionnaire was used to study older people living in house-
holds in all four countries. To improve comprehension and
validity of the questionnaire across different cultures, the
questionnaire for each nation was translated into the appro-
priate language and dialect, and then back-translated into
English to compare the differences and minimize problems
associated with cultural differences (Andrews, Esterman,
Braunack-Mayer, & Rungie, 1986). Different sampling de-
signs were used for each country, and response rates were
generally quite high--over 90%, except for the urban
Philippines sample (metro Manila), which had a response
rate of 83.5%. Although the survey was conducted more
than a decade ago, its suitability for cross-national compar-
isons and tests of social theories of psychological distress
make it unique for the present study.
The Republic of Korea had the only multistage random
sample designed to cover the entire country (N =981). The
S6 FERRAROANDSU
survey for Malaysia covered Peninsular Malaysia only, with
purposive sampling of five subregions (N = 1,000; Andrews
et al., 1986). Malaysia is a multiethnic society; the three
main ethnic groups are Malays, Chinese, and Indians, but
the majority of the citizens from where this sample was
drawn are Malay Bumis (and Muslim). In the Philippines,
the Tagalog Region of Luzon (21% of the Philippine popu-
lation) was sampled with a three-stage stratified cluster de-
sign (N = 981). About two thirds of the Tagalog-region resi-
dents live in urban areas, including metropolitan Manila,
whereas rural residence is predominant elsewhere in the
Philippines. Fiji is an archipelago of about 300 islands di-
vided into four government geoadministrative areas. A mul-
tistage sampling design within each area was applied so
that both urban and rural populations were represented (N =
769). The samples, except in Fiji, were weighted to be rep-
resentative of the populations for these areas for persons
aged 60 years and older, by sex, and by rural and urban res-
idence (Andrews et al., 1986).
Esterman and Andrews (1992) showed that living ar-
rangements in the four countries are fairly similar: respon-
dents "Jived in households which had an average size rang-
ing from 5.1 persons in Malaysia to 6.0 in the Philippines"
(p. 276). There were relatively few elders who lived alone
in these four countries during the time of the survey, and
this pattern persists in all four countries. The percentage of
elders living alone ranges from 2.0% in both Fiji and
Philippines to 5.7% in Malaysia (where Islam specifies
strong family support). As suggested by Esterman and An-
drews (1992), this is in direct contrast to the situation in
most Western nations, where as many as 60% of elderly
people live alone.
Despite the similarities in living arrangements, there is
considerable variability in social structure and culture
among the four nations, especially as pertains to the position
of older people (McCallum, 1992). Su and Ferraro (1997)
recently profiled the four nations on 11 ecological indicators
reflecting stage of modernization during 1980 and 1990.
Their analysis showed that the Republic of Korea was
clearly the most modernized of the four at the time of the
survey; this was especially evident on indicators of energy
consumption, telephones, TV, and physicians per capita.
Ann (1982) argued that the structural changes accompany-
ing modernization in Korea have decreased the influence of
the teachings of Confucius, especially as they relate to filial
piety and respect for older people. The Philippines is proba-
bly the least modernized of the four, and the Filipino value
of "utang-na-loob" or thankfulness is widely applicable to
parents, especially elderly parents (Abaya, 1982). Malaysia
is probably closer to South Korea in terms of modernization
(McCallum, 1992). Fiji is less developed and more similar
to the Philippines except that filial piety and elder benefi-
cence are not as salient in Fijian culture, perhaps due to a
history that includes cannibalism, witchcraft, and a utilitar-
ian philosophy (McCallum, 1992; Williams & Calvert,
1870). Fiji has been known as the "Cannibal Isles" because
cannibalism was observed there even into the mid-to-late
19th century (the practice was customary to show revenge
over adversaries or to dedicate a temple; Williams &
Calvert, 1870; Wright, 1986). All four nations showed signs
of important change during the decade (e.g., declining infant
mortality, increasing urbanization), but the level of modern-
ization across the four was similar in 1980 and 1990 (Su &
Ferraro, 1997). Fiji changed the least between 1980 and
1990 on the indicators considered.
Subjects were screened for eligibility based on psychi-
atric impairment. The measures of psychiatric impairment
included "hearing things that other people could not," "see-
ing things that other people could not," "believ[ing] that
other people are watching you, or spying on you, or plot-
ting against you," and "feel[ing] that special messages are
being sent to you on the TV or radio." Twenty-nine percent
of the sample reported one or more of these symptoms.
Given cultural differences in the interpretation of these
items and the widespread practice of witchcraft in Fiji and
mysticism in several of the countries, respondents who re-
ported three or more problems of psychiatric impairment
were deleted from the analysis. Using this decision rule, a
total of 208 (6%) cases were deleted from the analysis be-
cause of psychiatric impairment that might affect the valid-
ity and reliability of responses on other items (most of these
cases were from Fiji and Korea).
The present analysis is based on a sample of 3,277 non-
institutionalized respondents: 865 Koreans, 976 Malay-
sians, 621 Fijians, and 815 Filipinos. Approximately 58%
of all respondents are female. As one might expect, popula-
tion age parallels levels of modernization, and this is re-
flected in the study samples. The average age for all respon-
dents is 70.24 years, but Koreans and Malaysians are
slightly older than Filipinos and Fijians. Educational attain-
ment among respondents is modest because it refers to for-
mal, school-based education, and many of the current co-
horts of elderly persons in these nations began work after
primary school. Thus, although most respondents are liter-
ate, their years of schooling are limited. Educational attain-
ment in the samples from Fiji and the Philippines is higher
than in Korea and Malaysia, probably due to the purposive
sampling of urban areas in the former two nations (An-
drews et al., 1986). Although three of the samples were
weighted to ensure accurate representation, some caution is
warranted when combining the surveys because of bias due
to different sampling designs.
Measures
The surveys asked a number of questions that were re-
lated to the concepts under investigation. With the excep-
tion of the status characteristics, multiple measures for each
concept were available. The analysis began by creating a
series of additive indexes with the items for the proposed
indexes selected based on extant research and theory (Fil-
lenbaum, 1988; House et al., 1988; Wilson & Cleary, 1995).
Most of the indexes manifested fairly high reliability, but
some Cronbach alpha values were below .70. Therefore, in-
stead of using additive indexes, factor analysis was used to
optimize the linear relationship among the items. The same
sets of items were identified in the factor analyses as were
specified a priori in the additive indexes.
Psychological distress.--Seven items were designed to
measure psychological distress, several of which were
FINANCIAL STRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS S7
taken or adapted from the Center for Epidemiological Stud-
ies-Depression index (Radloff, 1977). The seven distress
items include sleep difficulties, worried-tense, lost interest,
very depressed, tired, forget things, and loneliness. Re-
sponses for the first six items were coded yes (1) and no
(0). The loneliness item was coded almost never (0), some-
times (1), and quite often (2). A factor analysis was per-
formed on the seven items of distress, yielding one factor
suitable for the analysis (i.e., all loadings greater than .5).
Descriptions of all variables in the analyses for each coun-
try and the four countries together are presented in Table 1
with ranges of variables, means, standard deviations, and
factor loadings where appropriate. The highest and lowest
mean values for psychological distress are not consistent
with modernization hypothesis; Fiji has the highest distress
and the Philippines has the lowest.
Social integration.--Consistent with the recent research
literature, social integration and social exchange were
measured separately (Schwarzer & Leppin, 1991). The
survey included a number of indicators of social integra-
tion that reflect the quantity of social relations and fre-
quency of contact. Seven measures were used to tap two
domains of social integration (House et al., 1988). As
shown in Table 1, the first domain, labeled voluntary asso-
ciations, was based on three items: whether the respon-
dent belongs to a social group; the respondent's degree of
participation (a leader, active, some, or no participation);
and whether the respondent belongs to a group for elderly
adults. The second domain was conceptualized as integra-
tion in family and friends and was constructed with four
items: how often the respondent attends family functions;
how often he or she sees relatives; number of people he or
she knows well enough to visit; and whether the respon-
dent sees family and friends enough. Missing data in
small proportions on the social integration indicators were
recoded to the mean for respondents from each country
(Hertel, 1976).
Social exchange.--In addition to social integration, four
items were used to measure common social exchanges with
the older respondents in these nations. Two items probe help
offered in family networks. The first, provision of child care
by elders, is widely used as a measure of intergenerational
exchange (Lee et al., 1995; Shi, 1993). The second, help in
making family decisions, has also been used as a measure of
social contributions by elders (Grant, Patterson, & Yager,
1988; Shi, 1993). In many Eastern and Western Pacific na-
tions, elders, particularly elderly men, are often seen as
reservoirs of the wisdom of ancestors--unique intermedi-
aries between the present and the past (Gutmann, 1977;
Simmons, 1945)--and this item taps this function. A third
item asked the respondent if he or she is consulted with re-
gard to community problems, and the fourth item taps eco-
nomic exchanges. Older adults were asked to identify their
main source of income. If an elder received the major source
of his or her income from the family, the respondent was
identified as receiving family financial support, implying at
least some degree of economic dependency. Responses
were coded yes (1) and otherwise (0).
The four items used in this survey were selected because
of their frequency of occurrence in these Western Pacific
cultures (see Table 1; Andrews et al., 1986). Although the
three items on providing help do not exhaust the types of
exchanges made, they span both family and community re-
lations and focus on culturally defined roles for elders. Ex-
cept for Fiji, elders in the Western Pacific have historically
relied heavily upon financial support from children, but this
is changing (Ahn, 1982; Keith et al., 1994). Financial assis-
tance from elders to children in these four nations is rare,
but the other direction of financial exchange is widespread.
(Home ownership was considered in penultimate models,
but was deleted from the final analysis because it was not
significant in any of the multivariate models). Treating the
four items separately seemed the best way to use them
given (a) the modest correlation among the four items and
(b) the value of differentiating which types of exchanges
are most predictive of psychological distress. One conse-
quence of treating the four items separately, however, is
that more equations are necessary to test the hypotheses
stated earlier.
Of course, the ideal strategy is to have parallel measures
for giving and receiving across domains of exchange activ-
ity as is the case in recent studies by Krause (1995) and Lee
and colleagues (1995). Unfortunately, those procedures
were not employed when this cross-cultural study was im-
plemented. The strategy adopted by the investigators of this
general social survey emphasized prevalent practices in
these Western Pacific cultures (Andrews et al., 1986). This
approach has merits, but the lack of parallelism limits the
generalizability of the results presented later in this article.
(For instance, it would be very useful to test hypotheses re-
garding the interaction of giving and receiving aid with par-
allel measures.)
Financial strain.--Respondents were asked about finan-
cial strain with this question: "Thinking about your money
situation, would you say you: do not have enough for basic
requirements, have just enough to get along on, or are you
comfortable?" This subjective appraisal of financial situa-
tion was coded 1 to 3 so that higher scores refer to higher
levels of financial strain. Given the link between financial
strain and both social relations and psychological distress,
interactions between financial strain and various measures
of social relations were also created and will be described
later (Krause & Liang, 1993; Whelan, 1993).
Health.--Whereas health is often closely related to psy-
chological distress among older adults, a number of mea-
sures of health status spanning four domains were consid-
ered in this research. The first domain, subjective health,
was measured with two items: "How do you feel about
your present health: do you feel quite healthy?" (Responses
were yes and no, coded 2 and 1, respectively.) The second
question was very similar to the widely used self-rating of
health: "How would you evaluate your present health; is
it": very good (5), fairly good (4), average (3), fairly bad
(2), or bad (1)?
The next two domains concern physical functioning. One
domain, activities of daily living (ADLs) was defined by

FINANCIAL STRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS S9
the following items: ability to eat, to dress and undress, to
take care of one's appearance, to walk, to get in and out of
bed, and to take a bath or shower. Responses were coded
unable (0), able with help (1), and able without help (2).
The other domain of physical functioning, labeled instru-
mental ADLs (IADLs), was defined by the following items:
ability to get to places out of walking distance, to go shop-
ping for food and clothes, and to handle money. The coding
scheme was identical for ADLs and IADLs.
Finally, the fourth domain of health measures sick days
and is composed of two items: (a) how many days in the
last month the respondent was so sick that he or she could
not carry on usual activities--such as going to work or
working around the house, and (b) how many days in the
last month the respondent was in a hospital for physical
health problems. The distributions for these two items were
grouped into five categories ranging from none (coded 5) to
22-31 days (coded 1). All health items were coded so that
high values reflect better health.
Status and social characteristics.--The measurement of
other variables is fairly straightforward and is depicted in
Table 1. Education is a seven-category variable of years of
schooling ranging from 0 (no years) to 6 (17 or more
years). Each of the status characteristics considered has
been shown in previous research to be important in predict-
ing psychological distress.
RESULTS
As a way of introducing the analysis, Table 2 presents
country-specific correlation matrices among selected vari-
ables: financial strain, the six variables for social relations,
and psychological distress. As hypothesized, financial strain
is positively related to psychological distress in all four na-
tions. Receiving financial support is positively related to
distress in three of the four nations. The relationships be-
tween social relations and distress are more complex, but
the overall pattern is one of integration and social contribu-
tions associated with lower levels of distress.

S10 FERRAROANDSU
The multivariate analysis was conducted in two stages: (a)
main effects of the independent variables on psychological
distress were estimated, assuming an additive model, and (b)
interaction terms of financial strain and social relations were
tested sequentially. Table 3 presents ordinary least squares
(OLS) regression coefficients, both unstandardized and stan-
dardized, for the first stage of the analysis. The first three
columns display the additive model for all nations combined.
A Chow test of the equality between sets of regression coeffi-
cients across nations suggested the appropriateness of sepa-
rate equations as well (p < .001; Chow, 1960). Therefore,
country-specific OLS regression analyses were conducted to
test for different associations between the predictor variables
and psychological distress as well as interactions across the
nations. (Standardized coefficients are provided for interpre-
tations within a given country but should not be used for
cross-cultural comparisons.) Rather than simply comparing
slopes, differences of slopes were tested (t value) for all inde-
pendent variable contrasts where at least one slope was sta-
tistically significant (Marascuilo & Levin, 1983). Korea
serves as the reference group for the analysis of differences
in slopes. Thus, no t values are presented for Korea.
The analysis of the four nations combined reveals that,
consistent with the simple relationships shown in Table 1,
psychological distress is highest in Fiji and lowest in the
Philippines (i.e., modernization does not lead to higher lev-
els of distress). Women have slightly higher distress levels
as do people who are not married, live with fewer household
members, are under financial strain, and are in poor
health--findings consistent with previous studies conducted
in other nations (e.g., Krause & Liang, 1993; Whelan,
1993). Indeed, standardized coefficients show that subjec-
tive health, IADLs, and financial strain have the strongest
effects on psychological distress. Integration in family and
friend networks, but not in voluntary associations, is associ-
ated with lower levels of psychological distress. There is no
main effect of social exchange on psychological distress for
the four nations combined.

FINANCIAL STRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS Sll
Turning to the results for each nation, psychological dis-
tress is more likely among Korean elders with fewer house-
hold members, poor subjective health, and higher IADLs.
As expected, psychological distress is also more likely
among persons with financial strain and those with low lev-
els of integration in family and friend networks. Social ex-
changes are quite consequential among Korean elders; psy-
chological distress is higher among those who are not
involved in family decision making but are consulted on
community problems and receive family financial support.
The results for Malaysia show that household size and
financial strain are not significant predictors of psychological
distress. Integration in voluntary associations in Malaysia is
associated with lower levels of psychological distress, but
none of the exchange relationships considered is consequen-
tial. The equation for Fiji has the lowest R2 value of all four
nations. Psychological distress there is explained by financial
strain, health, and integration in family and friend networks.
Again, no form of social exchange influences distress.
Turning to the equation for the Philippines, it is apparent
that the determinants of psychological distress are quite dif-
ferent from those seen in Korea. The Philippines is the only
nation in the multivariate analysis where women have
higher levels of distress. Three of the four indicators of
health influence psychological distress in the Philippines,
and the consistency of effects due to subjective health and
IADLs across the four nations is remarkable. In other
words, health shapes distress regardless of social context.
Household size, community consultation, and receiving
family financial support are not associated with psychologi-
cal distress in the Philippines, but providing child care and
helping with family decision making are. The provision of
child care is associated with elevated levels of psychologi-
cal distress presumably due to the physical and mental
challenges of taking care of grandchildren (Domingo &
Asis, 1995). On the other hand, helping with family deci-
sion making is associated with lower levels of psychologi-
cal distress.
The final stage of the analysis is the test of multiplicative
models, where it was hypothesized that financial strain
would interact with at least one type of social relations in
shaping psychological distress in each of the four nations.
(Models for the interaction of giving and receiving on dis-
tress were also tested, but none of 15 conditional relation-
ships was significant.) Rather than load the equations with
multiple interaction terms, interaction terms were tested
one at a time (Jaccard, Turrisi, & Wan, 1990; Southwood,
1978). Those that were significant are reported in Table 4.

S12 FERRAROANDSU
The test of the multiplicative model for Korea shows that
there is a significant interaction term between financial
strain and integration in family and friend networks. It
should be noted that the interpretation of interaction effects
relies on considering the main effects along with the prod-
uct term (and the contribution to R2 by adding the product
term; Jaccard et al., 1990). Although the main effect for
family and friend networks is no longer significant, the F
test for contribution to R2 indicates that there is a significant
interaction: financial strain heightens psychological dis-
tress, but solid integration in family and friend networks
serves as a buffer (p < .05). Consistent with the hypothesis,
psychological distress is most acute for those who face fi-
nancial strain and report being integrated weakly in family
and friend networks.
The results for Malaysia indicate that financial strain is
significant only when combined with the provision of child-
care. Neither of the main effect variables are significant in
Table 4, but the F test reveals that this is, nonetheless, a
case of significant statistical interaction (p <. 05). This is
the only instance where intergenerational aid given by the
elder coupled with financial strain is associated with psy-
chological distress. As hypothesized, psychological distress
is lower among Malaysian elders who report financial strain
and the provision of childcare. Table 3 showed that provid-
ing child care was associated with psychological distress in
the Philippines, but the results here show that providing
child care in Malaysia decreases the effect of financial
strain on psychological distress. We view this effect in
Malaysia as a way for elders to balance or offset financial
strain by providing tangible help to the family. Islam is the
most popular religion in Malaysia, and it expects strong
family contributions (Tracy & Tracy, 1993). Although
Malaysia shows how financial strain coupled with intergen-
erational giving leads to lower psychological distress, the
results from Fiji point to the process of financial support re-
ceived by elders interacting with financial strain to heighten
psychological distress. The F test for contribution to R2,
however, indicates that the interaction is not statistically
significant (p > .05). Given that the R2 is lowest in Fiji, we
believe the interaction between financial strain and receiv-
ing support merits further attention, but there is insufficient
evidence in these data to claim that the two interact in Fiji.
Thus, of the three interaction hypotheses specified, this is
the only one for which there was no support in any of the
countries.
Finally, the test of interaction effects in the Philippines is
consistent with the hypothesis and parallels those for
Korea: financial strain heightens psychological distress, and
elders who are integrated weakly in family and friend net-
works suffer the most. (Whereas this conditional relation-
ship was manifest in Korea and the Philippines, a test for a
second-order interaction was also performed, but found to
be nonsignificant.)
DISCUSSION
Considerable research has examined the ways in which
social relations influence psychological distress in the
United States, but cross-cultural analyses of such relation-
ships are rare. This study used a cross-cultural approach to
improve understanding of how social relations and financial
strain influence psychological distress. Based on the most
recent literature on stressors and social relations, we hy-
pothesized that social relations and financial strain would
manifest both main and interactive effects on psychological
distress.
Results from the four nations showed that financial strain
is common in these nations, especially in Fiji and the
Philippines (the less-developed nations). Financial strain
was also higher among persons with limited education and
poor health. As is the case in many studies in the United
States, the impact of financial strain on psychological dis-
tress is clear. Financial strain was associated with higher
levels of psychological distress in all of the nations studied,
except Malaysia. These findings add to the literature re-
garding how financial strain is important to psychological
distress, but do so with impressive cross-cultural evidence
(Krause et al., 1991; Krause & Liang, 1993). Although the
status of older people varies by level of societal develop-
ment, even in the Philippines, the least modern society
studied here, financial strain was linked to psychological
distress.
Financial strain involves anxiety about subsistence, and
confronting the daily exigencies of survival may erode feel-
ings of control and self-worth. Indeed, the connection be-
tween the psychological anxiety associated with financial
strain and feelings of psychological distress is well estab-
lished, even in cross-cultural research (Krause et al., 1991).
An emerging literature, however, suggests that a second
mechanism may also be at work in which financial strain
influences the quality of social life, sometimes precipitating
more negative interactions (Kim & Rhee, 1997; Krause &
Liang, 1993). In this sense, it would be helpful if future
studies considered the independent and joint effects of fi-
nancial strain and quality of social relations on psychologi-
cal distress. Findings from our analysis reveal that financial
strain was associated with less integration in family and
friend networks, but these data do not permit a test of the
quality of social relations being affected by financial strain.
Although financial strain directly and positively influ-
enced psychological distress in three of the four nations,
none of the other variables pertaining to the main-effect hy-
potheses demonstrated such a consistent pattern. Six mea-
sures of social relations were considered across four na-
tions, resulting in 24 tests; 8 of these 24 were significant,
but only 6 were consistent with the hypotheses. Each mea-
sure of social relations was significant in at least one na-
tion, but only two were significant in more than one nation:
psychological distress was lower for respondents with fam-
ily and friend integration and help with family decision
making. From another perspective, psychological distress
in Korea was related to four measures of social relations,
but only one or two of the six measures were significant in
each of the remaining nations.
Beyond main effects, analyses of these Western Pacific
elders provide some evidence that financial strain and inte-
gration in family and friend networks interact in shaping
psychological distress: although financial strain heightens
psychological distress, solid integration in family and friend
networks serves as a buffer in two of the four nations. For
FINANCIAL STRAIN AND PSYCHOLOGICAL DISTRESS S13
those individuals who lack such integration and report
financial strain, psychological distress is much higher. We
uncovered another case of statistical interaction--financial
strain interacted with the provision of child care in Ma-
laysia. Although some might argue that providing child
care might increase distress for those experiencing financial
strain, the opposite effect was observed in Malaysia; finan-
cially strained elders who helped with child care had lower
levels of psychological distress. We see this as a compen-
satory mechanism--one way for elders to balance or offset
financial strain by providing tangible help to the family
(Tracy & Tracy, 1993). Also, recall that the vast majority of
Malaysians sampled are Muslim and that Islam is the na-
tional religion. According to Islam, family members are ex-
pected to support the family. Thus, providing child care
may lower psychological distress because of the unique re-
ligious and cultural expectations of family support among
the Muslim Malays (Chan & Davanzo, 1996). The data are
not sufficient to test hypotheses about religious identity and
expectations, but it is clear that among the four samples
studied, Islam is prevalent in Peninsular Malaysia.
Taken together, these findings point to this study's three
major conclusions about how financial strain and social re-
lations affect psychological distress among older people.
First, the main effect due to financial strain on psychologi-
cal distress is important. By using a cross-cultural frame-
work, financial strain was found to heighten psychological
distress in some fashion for three of the four nations con-
sidered. The gravity of structural inequality in power re-
sources on psychological distress is hard to underestimate.
This is not to suggest a simplistic notion of socioeconomic
determinism on the psychological state of elders. Instead,
we see socioeconomic resources as key influences on the
intricate process of how social relations shape distress.
Second, the effect of social relations on psychological
distress is rarely as simple as may be detected when esti-
mating main effects only. Rather, the effect of social rela-
tions on psychological outlook is shaped in conjunction
with the stressors experienced by the older person (Silver-
stein & Bengtson, 1994). The same measures of social rela-
tions did not interact with strain in all four nations. Thus,
there is no simple conclusion that generalizes across all of
the nations considered; the interaction findings are not
consistent across the nations. What we uncovered, how-
ever, was that strain interacts with different measures of so-
cial relations in three of the four nations. We believe it is
noteworthy that in three of four Western Pacific nations,
financial strain interacts with one of two forms of social re-
lations in shaping psychological distress. These results
demonstrate more convincingly that although the main ef-
fects of strain and social relations are important, it is also
likely that the two phenomena interact in shaping psycho-
logical distress. The precise dimensions of social relations
that interact with strain vary by the unique cultural context,
but interaction effects should be examined. Failure to ac-
count for conditional relationships between stressors, social
relations, and psychological distress means that one does
not adequately capture the richness of the links between
these concepts.
Third, the types of social relations with which financial
strain interacts vary by cultural context and appear to be in-
dependent of the status of modernization. Some theories re-
garding the effects of modernization suggest that elders in
more modern societies may be especially vulnerable to fi-
nancial strain and low morale (Cowgill, 1986; Dowd, 1975),
but we found no clear pattern along levels of moderniza-
tion. Indeed, three important findings run counter to what
one would anticipate from modernization theory. First, psy-
chological distress was higher among elders in Korea who
received family financial support (Table 3), perhaps be-
cause they feel inadequate by receiving the aid (Lee et al.,
1995). Second, the interaction of financial strain and family
and friend integration on psychological distress was ob-
served in Korea and the Philippines, the most and least
modernized nations, respectively. Third, the influence of in-
volvement in family decision making on psychological dis-
tress was significant in the Philippines and Korea. It may
seem intuitive that the risk of social dependency may be
more consequential to psychological distress in more mod-
ern societies where utilitarian values are more common.
Yet, the effect of modernization on the both the status of
older people and their psychological distress appears to be
more contingent on cultural heritage than modernization
alone (Haber & Gratton, 1994). The modernization hypoth-
esis is not supported by these data.
Four limitations of the present study should be kept in
mind when interpreting the results. First, the results are de-
rived from cross-sectional data reflecting degrees of mod-
ernization, but results from long-term, longitudinal studies
of societies undergoing modernization would be more in-
sightful. With that said, the cost and organization needed
for such an endeavor would be truly extraordinary when
studying a subject such as psychological distress. All four
nations experienced major changes in their economies and
quality of life during recent years, but the rank order of
modernization is probably the same now as when the sur-
veys were conducted. Second, for Malaysia and the Philip-
pines, the surveys cover only selected geographic regions
of the nation. This is not a serious flaw given the compara-
tive emphasis here and the dearth of related research, but
it does constrain external validity for those two nations.
Third, because different sampling designs were used in the
four nations, some caution is needed regarding external va-
lidity. Finally, although the measures of social exchange tap
a range of interactions, the lack of parallelism for giving
and receiving is important. Given this limitation, studies
with parallel measures that examine the independent and
interactive effects of social relations and financial strain (or
other stressors) on psychological distress would prove es-
pecially useful. Despite the shortcomings of this research,
this is the first cross-cultural study of which we are aware
that systematically examines these relationships. The data
clearly show the importance of how the effects of social re-
lations and financial strain jointly influence psychological
distress.
In conclusion, the findings of the present investigation
add to the literature on how social environments and func-
tioning influence the psychological state of elders. It is
clear that some social and economic conditions are likely to
lead to psychological distress among elders, but our find-
S14 FERRAROANDSU
ings suggest that this can be mitigated, at least in part, by
greater social integration and/or involving elders in family
decision-making processes. In addition, the fact that subjec-
tive health and IADLs were significant predictors of psy-
chological distress in all four nations underscores the im-
portance of health factors in shaping distress regardless of
social or cultural context.
