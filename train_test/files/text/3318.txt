Introduction
The Chinese herbal cocktail Tien-Hsien liquid (THL; pre-
pared by China-Japan Feida Union Co, Ltd, Hong Kong)
has been used as an anti-cancer dietary supplement for
more than 20 years and has been used by many cancer
patients with favorable outcomes in more than 15 coun-
tries. THL is an aqueous preparation of herbal mixture
consisting mainly of extracts from 14 Chinese medicinal
herbs: Cordyceps sinensis (CS), Oldenlandia diffusa
(OD), Indigo pulverata levis (also known as indigo natu-
ralis), Polyporus umbellatus (PU), Radix astragali (RA),
Panax ginseng (PG), Solanum nigrum L, Pogostemon
cablin, Atractylodis macrocephalae rhizoma (AMR),
Trichosanthes radix, Clematis radix, Margarite, Ligustrum
lucidum Ait (LLA), and Glycyrrhiza radix (GR). It is
believed that a properly formulated herbal cocktail, which
takes advantage of synergy and interactions among the
myriad phytochemicals present in the different herbs, may
achieve better therapeutic efficacy than single herbs. Our

Abstract
Background. The Chinese herbal mixture, Tien-Hsien liquid (THL), has been used as an anticancer dietary supplement
for more than 20 years. Our previous studies have shown that THL can modulate immune responseand inhibit tumor
growth. In this study, we further evaluated the effect of THL on anticancer immune response in mice vaccinated with
-ray-irradiated tumor cells. Methods. The antitumor effect of THL was determined in mice vaccinated with low-tumorigenic
CT-26-low colon cancer cells or -ray-irradiated high-tumorigenic CT-26-high colon cancer cells. The number of natural
killer (NK) cells and T lymphocytes in the spleen was analyzed by flow cytometry. The tumor-killing activities of NK cells
and cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) were analyzed by flow cytometry using YAC-1 and CT-26-high cells, respectively, as
target cells. The levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- were determined by ELISA. Results. THL suppressed the growth of CT-
26-high tumor in mice previously vaccinated with low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or -irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL
increased the populations of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes in the spleen and enhanced the tumor-killing activities
of NK cells and CTL in mice vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high cells. THL increased the production of IFN-, IL-2,
and TNF- in mice vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high cells. Conclusion. THL can enhance the antitumor immune
responses in mice vaccinated with killed tumor cells. These results suggest that THL may be used as a complementary
medicine for cancer patients previously treated with killed tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy, or chemotherapy.

previous studies have shown that THL can induce apopto-
sis and inhibit metastasis and angiogenesis in a wide vari-
ety of human cancer cells.1,2 Other studies also showed
that THL can induce apoptosis and inhibit the growth and
metastasis of cancer cells by targeting various oncogenic
signaling pathways and metastatic markers.3-5 More
recently, Yao et al3 showed that THL could eliminate the
cancer stem-like cells, accompanied by the suppression of
stemness genes expression, colony formation, and tumori-
genicity.6 Together, these studies suggest that THL has the
potential to be used as a therapeutic agent for established
tumors.
The enhancement of host immune response has been
considered as an alternative strategy for the prevention
and cure of cancers and as a possible means of inhibiting
tumor growth without harming the host.7,8 Natural killer
(NK) cells and cytotoxic T lymphocyte (CTLs) are the 2
major cytotoxic lymphocytes that are important in the
defense against tumors.9,10 CTLs perform the surveil-
lance function by recognizing and killing potentially
malignant cells that express peptides derived from
mutant cellular protein or oncogenic proteins, which are
presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC)
class I molecules. Unlike CTLs, the killing by NK cells
is not through antigen/MHC recognition. NK cells kill
many types of tumor cells, especially cells that have
reduced MHC class I expression and can escape killing
by CTLs.11 Many in vitro and in vivo studies have sug-
gested that tumor cells are recognized as NK cell tar-
gets.12 NK cells also act as regulatory cells to influence
various other cells, such as dendritic cells, helper T-cells,
CTLs, and B cells.13 Therefore, many studies for cancer
immunotherapy were focused on enhancing the activity
of NK cells and CTLs.14
Immunotherapy using whole tumor cell vaccines has
become an alternative strategy for cancer treatment.15,16
For example, granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating
factor-expressing tumor cell vaccines are very efficient in
inducing tumor-specific immune response in mice and in
preliminary clinical trials.17-19 In addition, -ray-irradiated
apoptotic tumor cell vaccines can induce a potent immune
response in vivo probably through the cross-presentation
of tumor antigens to CTLs by dendritic cells.20,21 Our pre-
vious studies have shown that THL has immunomodulat-
ing activity and can modulate the antigen-stimulated
cytokine production by T-cells.22,23 Moreover, several
major ingredients of THL have been reported to be able to
modulate immune response.24,25 For instance, CS, RA, PG,
and GR can increase the cytotoxic activity of murine NK
cells. OD can increase the cytotoxic activity of murine
CTLs. CS and GR can increase the secretion of interleukin
(IL)-1 by murine macrophages. RA, PG, and GR can
induce the secretion of interferon- (IFN-) by mouse
spleen cells. CS, OD, PU, RA, PG,AMR, LLA, and GR can
induce the secretion of IL-2 by mouse spleen cells.
Together, these results suggest that THL can modulate
antitumor immunity in tumor-bearing mice. In this study,
we used -ray-irradiated apoptotic tumor cells as a vaccine
to immunize mice and investigate whether THL could
enhance the antitumor immunity in tumor cell­vaccinated
mice. We found that THL could enhance the tumor-killing
activities of NK cells and CTL and increase the production
of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in mice vaccinated with
-irradiated tumor cells.
Materials and Methods
Cell Culture
The mouse colon carcinoma cell lines, CT-26 (including
CT-26-low and CT-26-high), were established and pro-
vided by Dr Sheng-Hong Tseng (Department of Surgery,
National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan).
Their tumorigenicity was confirmed, as shown in Table 1.
These cells were routinely grown in Dulbecco's modified
Eagle medium (DMEM; GIBCO BRL Life Technologies,
Grand Island, NY) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (FBS) in 5% CO
2
. The mouse lymphoma cell line,
YAC-1 was cultured in RPMI-1640 medium (GIBCO
BRL Life Technologies) supplemented with 10% FBS in
5% CO
2
.
Handling of THL
THL (obtained from China-Japan Feida Union Co, Ltd,
Hong Kong) is an aqueous preparation of herbal mixture
and consists mainly of extracts from 14 Chinese medicinal
herbs as mentioned previously. For the in vivo mice xeno-
graft experiment, THL (200 µL/d) was orally given to mice
directly. The dose of THL for each mouse was calculated as
follows. The dosage of THL for a cancer patient (60 kg) is 1
mL/kg/d.26 The given dosage (D) of THL in mice was cal-
culated according to the Meeh-Rubner conversion formula
between human and mouse: D
mouse
= D
human
× (K
mouse
/K

),
where K is the conversion factor (K
mouse
= 1 and K

=
0.11). The calculated dosage in mice (0.02 kg) was 9.09

mL/kg/d, which equals 198 µL per day for each mouse.
Therefore, a daily dose of 200 µL THL per mouse was used
in this study. This dose of THL did not cause toxic effects in
the mice in our preliminary study.
Preparation of Tumor Vaccines
CT-26-high cells were irradiated with 72-Gy -rays, and
the viability of the irradiated cells was analyzed by prop-
idium iodide (PI) staining and flow cytometry. The
majority of irradiated CT-26-high cells were found to be
dead, and the irradiated cells were promptly inoculated
subcutaneously on the back of BALB/c mice (1 × 106
cells, suspended in 100 µL of phosphate-buffered saline
[PBS]).
Experimental Animals
All animal experiments in this study were performed fol-
lowing the Guidelines for Animal Experiments in National
Taiwan University and were approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee in College of Medicine,
National Taiwan University (IACUC Approval No.:
20110101). BALB/c female mice (6-8 weeks old) were
purchased from Laboratory Animal Center at College of
Medicine, National Taiwan University (Taipei, Taiwan)
and given food and water ad libitum. The mice were ran-
domly divided into 2 groups for oral feeding with THL or
water (200 µL; each day) throughout the experimental
period. The experimental schedule for assessing the
immune-enhancing effect of THL in tumor-bearing mice is
summarized in Figures 1A and 2A. The body weight and
tumor size of mice were measured at different time points
following tumor implantation, and the tumor volume was
calculated according to the following formula: 1/2 (Length
× Width2).
Preparation of Splenocytes
Spleens were removed aseptically, placed in RPMI
medium, gently homogenized, and passed through a
200-µm-mesh (Becton Dickinson Bioscience, San Jose,
CA) to generate single-cell suspension. Erythrocytes were
rapidly washed and lysed by the RBC lysis buffer (0.15 M
NH
4
Cl, 10 mM KHCO
3
, 0.1 mM EDTA), and the spleno-
cytes were resuspended at a density of 1 × 107 cells/mL in
RPMI medium.
Flow Cytometry Analysis of NK Cells and T
Lymphocytes in Spleen
The lymphocytes from spleens were stained with fluores-
cence-labeled antibodies in PBS for 30 minutes, followed
by 3 washes with PBS, and then analyzed by flow
cytometry (Becton Dickinson Bioscience). Fluorescence-
labeled antibodies against CD4, CD8a, and CD49b (pan-
NK) were all purchased from Becton Dickinson
Bioscience.

Assay of NK Cell­ and CTL-Mediated Killing
Activity
The mouse lymphoma YAC-1 cells and CT-26-high cells
were used as the target cells of NK cells and CTL, respec-
tively. Before the coincubation of effector and target cells,
YAC-1 cells and CT-26-high cells were labeled with 200 nM
CFSE (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 15 minutes in
serum-free RPMI medium, washed once, and diluted in
complete RPMI or DMEM medium. In the NK killing
assay, lymphocytes and CFSE-labeled YAC-1 cells were
cocultured in 5-mL Falcon tubes (Becton Dickinson
Bioscience) at 25:1 or 50:1 of the effector cell versus target
cell (E:T) ratio. After incubation at 37°C for 4 hours, the
samples were resuspended in PI solution (0.25 µg/mL PI
and 1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) in PBS) and ana-
lyzed by flow cytometry. The CFSE+/PI+ YAC-1 cells
were considered as killed target cells. In the CTL-killing
assay, lymphocytes were stimulated in vitro with 72-Gy
-irradiated CT-26-high cells at a 40:1 ratio (lymphocytes
vs -irradiated CT-26-high cells) and 1 ng/mL of IL-2.
After incubation for 5 days, lymphocytes and CFSE-
labeled viable CT-26-high cells were cocultured in 5-mL
Falcon tubes at 10:1, 25:1, or 50:1 E:T ratios. After incuba-
tion at 37°C for 4 hours, the samples were resuspended in
PI solution and analyzed by flow cytometry. The CFSE+/
PI+ CT-26-high cells were considered as killed target cells.
Cytokine Production by Cultured Splenocytes
and Tumor Xenografts
Isolated splenocytes (1 × 106/mL) from water- or THL-
treated mice were ex vivo stimulated with concanavalin A
(Con A; Sigma-Aldrich, Inc, St Louis, MO) at 5 µg/mL for
24 hours. The levels of IFN- , IL-2, and tumor necrosis
factor  (TNF-) secreted in the culture supernatant
were measured by ELISA (BioLegend, San Diego, CA).
To measure cytokine levels in tumor xenografts, tumor
tissues were taken, weighed, minced, and homogenized with
tissue lysis buffer (1% Triton X-100; 50 mM HEPES, pH
7.4; 150 mM NaCl; 1.5 mM MgCl
2
; 1 mM ethylene glycol
tetraacetic acid (EGTA); 100 mM NaF; 1 mM Na
3
VO
4
; 10%
glycerol; and 1× protease inhibitor cocktail from Roche
Applied Science). The supernatant of the homogenized sam-
ple was obtained by centrifugation (12000 rpm for 10 min-
utes), and the levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in the
supernatant were assayed by ELISA (BioLegend).
Statistical Analyses
Data are presented as mean ± standard error. The signifi-
cance of the difference between groups was evaluated with
the Student's t-test; P < .05 was considered significant.

CT-26-high, which have low and high tumorigenic activity,
respectively, were established. Subcutaneous injection of 5
× 104 high-tumorigenic CT-26-high cells resulted in 100%
tumor formation in syngeneic BALB/c mice. In contrast, in
mice subcutaneously injected with 3 × 106 low-tumorigenic
CT-26-low cells, only about 50% of mice showed tumor
formation (Table 1). We hypothesized that CT-26-low cell
may be used as a tumor vaccine to elicit an antitumor
immune response in mice. To test this possibility, we com-
pared the tumor-inducing ability of CT-26-high cells in
mice previously injected with CT-26-low cells with that in
mice not injected with CT-26-low cells. We found that
while injection of 5 × 104 CT-26-high cells was enough to
induce 100% tumor formation in mice not injected with
CT-26-low cells previously, a much higher number (~5 ×
106) of CT-26-high cells was required to induce 100%
tumor formation in mice previously injected with CT-26-
low cells (data not shown). This result suggests that CT-26-
low cell injection may elicit antitumor immune responses
against CT-26-high cells. Next, we tested whether THL
could suppress tumor growth in mice vaccinated with
CT-26-low cell. To do this, mice were first injected with 3 ×
106 CT-26-low cells and then randomly divided into 2
groups: one orally fed with THL and the other orally fed
with water. Then 56 days later, the number of tumor-free
mice in the THL-treated group was 12, whereas that in the
water-treated group was 5, indicating that administration of
THL reduced the frequency of tumor formation. The mice
were then injected subcutaneously with 2 × 106 CT-26-high
cells as indicated in the experimental protocol shown in
Figure 1A. Mice were fed with either THL or water through-
out the entire experimental period (200 µL; twice a day). At
42 days after second tumor-cell injection, 4 out of 12 THL-
treated mice remained tumor free, whereas only 1 out of 5
water-treated mice was tumor free. The average tumor vol-
ume of THL-treated mice was about 48% that of water-
treated mice at 42 days after second tumor-cell injection
(Figure 1B). These data indicate that THL can suppress
tumor growth in tumor cell­vaccinated mice, and this
tumor-suppressing activity of THL may be, at least, partly
mediated through its ability to promote antitumor immune
responses.
To further study the enhancement of antitumor immunity
by THL, we used -ray-irradiated CT-26-high cells to immu-
nize syngeneic BALB/c mice. Briefly, BALB/c mice were
vaccinated twice with 1 × 106 -irradiated CT-26-high
cells. One week after the second injection of the -irradiated
cells, the mice were subcutaneously injected with 5 × 106
viable CT-26-high cells, and the growth of tumor xeno-
grafts was monitored and measured for 21 days (see Figure
2A for the experimental protocol). As shown in Figure 2B,
the tumor growth was slower in THL-treated mice than in
water-treated mice. At day 21 after tumor cell implanta-
tion, the average tumor volume of the THL-treated mice
was 0.55 ± 0.1 cm3, whereas that of the water-treated mice
was 1.29 ± 0.2 cm3. In addition, THL did not cause body
weight loss (Figure 2C) or other side effects, such as hair loss
and lethargy, during the experimental period. These results fur-
ther demonstrate that THLpossesses potent tumor-suppressing
activity, and this antitumor activity may, at least partly, be a
result of its ability to enhance antitumor immune responses.
THL Increases NK Cell and CTL Activities in
Tumor Cell­Vaccinated Mice
NK cells and CTLs represent 2 major populations of cyto-
toxic lymphocytes and play a vital role in antitumor
defense.9,10 To elucidate the mechanisms for the anticancer
efficacy of THL in tumor cell­vaccinated mice, splenocytes
were isolated from the mice of the above experiment (see
Figure 2), and the populations of NK cells (CD49b+) and T
lymphocytes (CD8+ or CD4+) were analyzed by flow
cytometry. As shown in Figures 3A and 3B, the populations
of NK cells and CD4+ T lymphocytes were higher in the
THL-treated mice than in the water-treated mice. To inves-
tigate whether the activities of NK cells and CTLs were
increased following the THL treatment, ex vivo assays for
tumor cell killing by NK cells and CTLs were performed.
As shown in Figures 3C and 3D, the tumor-killing activities
of NK cells and CTLs of the THL-treated mice were higher
than those of the water-treated mice. Together, these results
indicate that THL may inhibit tumor growth through the
enhancement of the NK cell and CTL activities.
THL Increases the Cytokine Secretion in Tumor
Cell­Vaccinated Mice
Cytokines, such as IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-, play an essen-
tial role in NK cell and CTL activation. We thus investi-
gated the effect of THL on the production of cytokines
IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- from Con A­stimulated spleno-
cytes isolated from mice vaccinated with -irradiated
CT-26-high cells by ELISA. As shown in Figure 4A, sple-
nocytes isolated from the THL-treated mice produced
higher levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- than splenocytes
isolated from the water-fed mice. In addition, the infiltrat-
ing cytokines in tumor xenografts were also examined by
ELISA analyses. Similarly, the levels of IFN-, IL-2, and
TNF- were higher in THL-treated tumors than in water-
treated tumors (Figure 4B). Together, these data indicate
that THL increases the production of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-
 in tumor cell­vaccinated mice and suggest that THL
may promote the activities of NK cells and CTLs by induc-
ing cytokine production.
Discussion
THL is a Chinese herbal mixture that has been used as an
anticancer dietary supplement for many years. It has been
suggested that the antitumor activity of traditional Chinese
324 Integrative Cancer Therapies 16(3)
herbs is mediated through the augmentation of the immune
responses.27 It also has been reported that THL can modu-
late immune responses.22,23,28 However, it is still not clear
whether THL could suppress tumor growth through enhanc-
ing antitumor immunity. In this study, we investigated the
immune-enhancing activity of THL. We found that THL
can efficiently suppress the growth of CT-26-high tumors in
syngeneic BALB/c mice previously vaccinated with either
low tumorigenic CT-26-low cells or -irradiated CT-26-
high cells. We also found that the tumor-killing activities of
NK cells and CTLs in the THL-treated mice were signifi-
cantly higher than those in the water-treated mice, which
was correlated with the increased production of cytokines,
including IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-, in THL-treated mice.
Together, these results indicate that THL can enhance the
antitumor immune responses.
To investigate the ability of THL to induce antitumor
immunity, we used viable low-tumorigenic CT-26-low cells
or -irradiated CT-26-high cells as tumor vaccines to immu-
nize syngeneic BALB/c mice. Both viable CT-26-low cells
and -irradiated CT-26-high cells were capable of inducing
antitumor immune responses because a much higher num-
ber of CT-26-high cells was required to induce tumor for-
mation in mice previously injected with viable CT-26-low
cells or -irradiated CT-26-high cells compared with mice
not previously injected with these cells (data not shown).
Figure 3. Tien-Hsien liquid (THL) increased the populations and tumor-killing activities of natural killer (NK) cells and cytotoxic
T lymphocytes (CTLs) in mice previously vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high colon cancer cells. Mice from the experiment
in Figure 2 were killed humanely at 21 days after viable CT-26-high cell injection. The splenocytes were then isolated and used to
determine the amounts and cytotoxic activities of NK cells and CTLs. The populations of NK cells (A) and T lymphocytes (B) were
determined by flow cytometry. Values represent mean ± standard error (SE); n = 9 mice per group. *P < .05 versus the water-treated

The observation that -irradiated apoptotic tumor cells can
induce a potent antitumor immune response in vivo has
been reported before.20,21 We found that THL can effec-
tively suppress the growth of CT-26-high tumor in mice
previously vaccinated with CT-26-low cells or -irradiated
CT-26-high cells (Figures 1 and 2). This tumor-suppressing
effect of THL is most likely mediated by its ability to
enhance antitumor immunity in tumor cell­vaccinated
Figure 4. Tien-Hsien liquid (THL) increased the level of cytokines in mice previously vaccinated with -irradiated CT-26-high
colon cancer cells. Mice from the experiment in Figure 2 were killed humanely at 21 days after viable CT-26-high cell injection. The
production of interferon (IFN)-, interleukin (IL)-2, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- from splenocytes isolated from mice (A) and
in tumor xenografts (B) was determined. (A) Splenocytes were cultured with 5 µg/mL concanavalin A for 24 hours, and the levels
of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in the supernatant were measured by ELISA. Values represent mean ± standard error (SE); n = 6 mice
per group. *P < .05; ***P < .001 versus the water-treated group. (B) The levels of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in tumor xenografts were
measured by ELISA. Values represent mean ± SE; n = 4 mice per group. *P < .05 versus the water-treated group.

mice, based on the following reasons. First, THL signifi-
cantly increased the tumor-killing activities of NK cells and
CTLs in tumor cell­vaccinated mice (Figure 3). Second,
THL significantly increased the secretion of IFN-, IL-2,
and TNF- in tumor cell­vaccinated mice (Figure 4). Third,
our preliminary data indicated that THL could only slightly
inhibit the growth of CT-26-high tumor in nonvaccinated
mice (statistically not significant). This result suggests that
THL's tumor-suppressing activity is largely mediated by its
ability to enhance antitumor immunity rather than by its
ability to kill CT-26-high tumor cells directly.
Our previous studies have shown that THL has immune-
modulating activity and can modulate the antigen-stimulated
cytokine production by T-cells.22,23 More recently, Kuo et al26
reported that in a phase IIa trial, THL showed immune-modu-
lating effects in patients with refractory metastatic breast can-
cer. The levels of T lymphocytes (CD3+, CD4+, and CD8+),
B lymphocytes (CD19+), and mature NK cells (CD16+/
CD56+) in peripheral blood of THL-treated patients were
elevated.26 In the present study, we further showed that THL
could increase the tumor-killing activities of CTL and NK
cells in tumor cell­vaccinated mice (Figure 3). This effect of
THL may be derived from its ability to stimulate the produc-
tion of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in tumor cell­vaccinated mice
(Figure 4). IFN- is known to play a central role in the induc-
tion of host defenses against tumors.29,30 Its antitumor effects
can be mediated directly through inhibition of tumor cell
growth and/or indirectly by activation of CTLs, NK cells, and
macrophages, which are involved in innate as well as adaptive
antitumor immune responses.31-33 IFN- also facilitates anti-
gen processing and presentation by both the MHC class I and
II pathways in tumor cells and antigen-presenting cells, lead-
ing to tumor recognition and subsequent destruction by
CTLs.32-37 IL-2 has long been considered as a T-cell growth
factor and thought to play an important role in mediating
clonal expansion of T-cells38-41 and in driving effector differ-
entiation to CTLs.42,43 It can promote tumor-reactive lympho-
cyte proliferation and cytotoxicity.38,44 TNF- is an important
effector molecule in CTLand NK cell killing of immunogenic
tumor cells.45-47 When expressed locally by immune cells,
TNF- can destroy tumor blood vessels and induce the apop-
tosis and necrosis of tumor cells.9,47 TNF- has also been
shown to be able to inhibit the growth of tumors through the
recruitment of macrophages and NK cells.48 Together, these
studies suggest that the above cytokines may exert their anti-
tumor activities directly through inhibiting tumor growth or
indirectly through modulating innate as well as adaptive
immune responses against tumors. Our finding that THL can
suppress tumor growth and promote the tumor-killing activi-
ties of NK cells and CTLs may be related to its ability to stim-
ulate the secretion of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF-.
In addition to the immune-enhancing and tumor-sup-
pressing activities, depending on the tumor microenvironment,
cytokines can also promote the initiation, progression, inva-
sion, and metastasis of cancer through various mechanisms,
including modulation of the immune system.49,50 For exam-
ple, TNF- has been shown to participate in the initiation,
progression, and metastasis of cancer.47,49 Anumber of stud-
ies also showed that IFN- may be intimately involved in
immunosuppressive mechanisms.51 In this study, we cannot
exclude the possibility that cytokines stimulated by THL
also display tumor-promoting activities. Further investiga-
tion is needed to clarify the exact roles of these cytokines in
our tumor model.
Chemotherapy and radiotherapy are the major therapeutic
modalities commonly used for treatment of a variety of cancer
patients. However, in many cases, chemotherapy or radiother-
apy alone cannot achieve a satisfactory therapeutic outcome
because of severe adverse effects induced at therapeutic
doses.52 Manipulation of the immune system has been consid-
ered an alternative strategy for the prevention and cure of can-
cers and as a promising means of suppressing tumor growth
without harming the host.7,8 Here, we show that THL can
enhance the antitumor immunity in mice previously injected
with -irradiated tumor cells. Both chemotherapy and radio-
therapy can induce tumor cell apoptosis. The tumor antigens in
the apoptotic cells may be processed and presented by profes-
sional antigen-presenting cells and induce antigen-specific
immune response in the presence of immune-enhancing agents
suchasTHL.Theobservationthatherbalmixturescanenhance
the therapeutic efficacy of ionizing radiation and augment anti-
tumor immune response in tumor-bearing mice has been
reported before.53 THL has been shown to be a safe adjuvant
regimen for patients with refractory metastatic breast cancer in
a phase IIa trial and can effectively palliate cancer-related syn-
dromes and improve quality of life.26 It is possible that THL
can be used as a complementary medicine to enhance the
therapeutic efficacy and lower therapeutic doses of chemo-
therapy or radiotherapy in cancer patients. Immunotherapy
using -irradiated tumor cell vaccines is an alternative strategy
for cancer treatment.15,16,20,21 Also, it is possible that THL may
enhance the therapeutic efficacy of -irradiated tumor cell vac-
cines via augmenting antitumor immunity.
Conclusions
THL, a Chinese herbal mixture, has been shown to have
various anticancer activities. In this study, we further show
that THL can suppress tumor growth in mice previously
vaccinated with -irradiated tumor cells. This function of
THL may be related to its ability to enhance the tumor-
killing activity of NK cells and CTLs and increase the
secretion of IFN-, IL-2, and TNF- in mice vaccinated
with -irradiated tumor cells. Together, these results
suggest that THL may be used as a complementary
medicine for cancer patients previously treated with

-irradiated apoptotic tumor cell vaccines, radiotherapy,
or chemotherapy.
