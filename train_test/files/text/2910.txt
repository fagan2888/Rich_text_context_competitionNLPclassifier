Research Question
We investigate whether bank executive directors appointed from outside the bank ("out-
siders") improve post-succession performance and whether some outsiders are better pre-
disposed than others to turn around a bank's performance. In the case of banks, this
question is highly relevant because regulatory authorities may regard the replacement of
the management team as a chance to clean up financially distressed banks. Our sample
compromises all universal banks for the period 1993 to 2014.
Contribution
First, the results of our study contribute to the existing literature on the post-succession
effects of executive turnovers by documenting a performance differential between out-
siders with strong and poor managerial abilities in the years following their appointment.
Second, we add to the literature examining managerial ability by extracting managerial
ability from the risk-return efficiency of executive directors' previous banks. Third, we
add to the literature dealing with the financial crisis by measuring the performance effects
separately for the pre- and post-crisis period.
Results
Our study documents the negative performance effects in the years following the appoint-
ment of an outsider on banks making such appointments. We find that executives with
poor managerial abilities ("bad outsiders") underperform at their new banks during the
post-appointment period whereas executives with strong managerial abilities ("good out-
siders") do so only at the very beginning of the post-appointment period. Thus, not all
executive directors appointed from outside are equally capable of improving bank perfor-
mance. Our results further suggest that the performance differential between good and
bad outsiders strengthens in the post-crisis period. We systematically rule out that these
performance differentials following external appointments are driven by appointing good
outsiders to boards of banks with a low risk exposure.

Abstract
Banks in bad financial shape are more likely to appoint executive directors from the
outside than those in good shape. It is, however, not clear whether all of these ap-
pointments necessarily lead to the desired turnaround. We analyze the performance
effects of new board members with external boardroom experience (outsiders) by
distinguishing between good and bad managerial abilities of executives based on
either ROA or risk-return efficiency of their previous employers. Our results show
that banks appointing bad outsiders underperform other banks while those appoint-
ing good outsiders do so to a lesser extent. The performance differentials are highly
pronounced in high-risk banks and in the post-crisis period.

1 Introduction
Appointing a new executive director from the outside involves greater uncertainty as con-
cerns the abilities of the executive than appointing someone from the inside. At the time
of their appointment, executive directors from outside are less well informed about the
company and its employees than those appointed from inside. Thus, promoting a suitable
candidate from any internal position to a senior management position may be preferable
to bringing in an outsider. Therefore, banks may only risk hiring executive directors whose
abilities are not well known if it is absolutely necessary to do so. They may appoint an
executive from the outside either because no suitable internal candidate with the skills
needed is available (Dalton and Kesner, 1985) or because the bank is in dire financial
straits. In line with the latter reason, a large number of studies show that executive
turnovers are often preceded by poor performance (e.g. Barro and Barro, 1990; Houston
and James, 1995; Webb, 2008; Palvia, 2011) and high risk (Schaeck, Cihak, Maechler, and
Stolz, 2012). In times of financial difficulties, the incoming executive from the outside is
expected to catch up, revise the strategy and restructure the organization. For example,
the appointment of John Cryan as the new CEO of Deutsche Bank in 2015 was described
as follows: "Cryan is cleaning up" (Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung, October 8, 2015).
A key question in this context is which executive director will be of most help in
turning around bad financial performance and whether it is possible to identify execu-
tives who outperform others. We study this question by investigating appointments to
the executive boards of German universal banks from 1993 to 2014. The answer to this
question is relevant for academics and practitioners alike. In the case of banks, whose
governance mechanisms potentially differ from those of non-financial firms (Adams and
Mehran, 2003), it is even more relevant because regulatory authorities often order finan-
cially distressed banks to replace (in whole or in part) the management team in the hope
that incoming executive directors will clean up the bank. The German banking system is
an excellent playground to address this question because German companies, especially
the German Mittelstand (i.e. small and mid-sized companies), (still) rely heavily on bank
lending (e.g. Koetter and Wedow, 2010). Therefore, one may argue that finding good
successors is of even greater importance in this country than in those where a firm's fi-
nance is less tied to banks.
We focus on managerial ability, as executives with high ability are expected to do a
better job than those with low ability. Unfortunately, managerial ability is not directly
observable. We use two proxies of managerial ability to differentiate among outside ap-
pointments. Both measures follow the literature that suggests information of the previous
banks as possible indicators of managerial talent (e.g. Kaplan and Reishus, 1990; Fee and
Hadlock, 2003; Demerjian, Lev, and McVay, 2012). Fee and Hadlock (2003) postulate
that labor markets use firm performance as an indicator of managerial ability and that
executives from superior-performing firms have developed valuable management skills ­
in the sense that these managers have learned "how to win" (Fee and Hadlock, 2003, p.
1324). Following this line of reasoning, we build our first measure with the performance of
executive directors' previous banks observed directly before they are appointed to another
bank. The second measure is based on risk-return efficiency, which we will describe below.
1
In line with the argument that external successors are often appointed in bad financial
times, we find negative performance effects for banks after appointing executive directors
from the outside. We extend the literature on post-turnover performance effects (Schaeck
et al., 2012) by showing that executives with low managerial abilities, which we call bad
outsiders, underperform with their new banks in the post-appointment period whereas
executives with high managerial abilities, called good outsiders, only did so at the very
beginning of the post-appointment period. These different performance paths indicate
that not all executive directors appointed from outside are equally capable of improving
bank performance. To the best of our knowledge, our study is one of the first to inves-
tigate the link between post-appointment financial performance and managerial abilities
of executive directors appointed to German banks. Documenting this heterogeneity in
post-appointment performance is our first contribution to the literature.
Our second contribution is methodological in nature and relates to how our second
measure of managerial ability is constructed.1 We extract managerial ability from risk-
return efficiency of executive directors' previous banks. Many recent studies have distilled
managerial ability from cost efficiency (e.g. Demerjian et al., 2012; Francis, Hasan, Mani,
and Ye, 2016) and profit efficiency (Andreou, Philip, and Robejsek, 2016) by separating
full efficiency into a part caused by firm or bank characteristics and another part which
is attributed to managerial ability. We use their approach of separating full efficiency,
but we do not rely on cost or profit efficiency. Rather, we follow another strand of the
banking literature arguing that risk, which is immanent in the banking industry, is not
sufficiently controlled for in cost and profit efficiency measures (Koetter, 2008; Hughes,
Lang, Mester, and Moon, 1996). Therefore, we estimate bank risk-return efficiency and
determine the proportion of efficiency that can be attributed to the management by using
a Tobit regression. In doing so, we enhance the existing literature of managerial ability
with a combination of two approaches that have thus far been unconnected.
A built-in problem of studies dealing with the link between performance and man-
agerial heterogeneity, for instance in terms of managerial ability, is that executives are
not randomly assigned to institutions (Chang, Dasgupta, and Hilary, 2010). Good out-
siders may outperform bad outsiders not because the former are necessarily the better
managers, but because they, due to their previous track record, have the opportunity
to select the better banks. In other words, the performance differential between banks
appointing good and bad outsiders might be driven by the managerial ability of the good
outsiders or, alternatively, by their self-selection into better banks. Not all executive di-
rectors will accept job offers at high-risk banks because these positions may come with a
higher likelihood of failure (Bushman, Zhonglan, and Wang, 2010; Schaeck et al., 2012)
and executive directors care about their market value and reputation in the job market
for bank managers. One potential source of selection is that good outsiders (who may
receive many job offers because of their managerial ability) select low-risk banks while
for bad outsiders (who may receive few job offers) high-risk banks may be the only viable
employment option. To disentangle the two lines of reasoning, we exploit cross-sectional
variation in the data. We build our regression model2 in such a way that we are able to
1We thank an anonymous referee for this valuable suggestion.
2We estimate performance effects with dynamic panel estimations on several risk-adjusted perfor-
2
compare the post-appointment performance effects of good and bad outsiders in banks
with similar risk profiles in the pre-appointment period. We find that good outsiders
outperform bad outsiders especially, but not exclusively, at high-risk banks.
Studies dealing with bank corporate governance (see, the literature review by Haan
and Vlahu (2016)) can be distinguished into three strands: (i) boards, (ii) ownership, and
(iii) compensation (e.g. Diamond and Rajan, 2009; Fahlenbrach and Stulz, 2011). Our
study contributes to the first two strands. While recent literature deals with ownership
structures (e.g. Berger, Clarke, Cull, Klapper, and Udell, 2005) and shareholder activism
(e.g. Roman, 2015), we can only measure performance differentials of outside appoint-
ments separately for savings and private banks (cooperative as well as private commercial
banks). This is because few German private commercial banks are publicly listed with
dispersed ownership. Consequently, our main contribution to the bank corporate gover-
nance literature is related to the boards. While most studies deal with firms and banks in
one-tier board systems, our study comes from a country with a two-tier system. There-
fore, we use the term "outsider" in a different way. For instance, studies on US banks
divide the board of directors into inside and outside directors. In these studies, directors
who are employed full-time at the bank are classified as insiders, whereas directors who
are independent of the bank are called outside directors (e.g. Adams, Hermalin, and
Weisbach, 2010). By contrast, the German corporate governance system often requires a
dual board structure with an executive board (first tier) and a supervisory board (second
tier) (Hackethal, Schmidt, and Tyrell, 2003). Almost all German universal banks have
an executive and a supervisory board, with only very few exceptions, for instance, among
small private commercial banks. The members of the executive board who manage the
bank are monitored and advised by the supervisory board, which appoints or dismisses
members of the executive board and approves executive directors' salaries. The executive
board has to report to the supervisory board on a regular basis. The supervisory board's
responsibilities are similar to those of US boards (Kaplan, 1994; Fauver and Fuerst, 2006).
In this study, we deal with the first tier of the system and investigate the performance
implications of appointing executive directors from the outside.
In this two-tier bank board system, several measures developed in the context of one-
tier systems to describe CEO entrenchment and the strength of the board of directors
(independence, non-staggered boards, anti-takeover protections) are either not defined
or are unknown. More specifically, CEO duality often used in US studies to measure
CEO entrenchment (e.g. Pathan and Skully, 2010; Pathan, 2009) cannot be applied since
CEOs serving on the executive board are not allowed to serve on the supervisory board
at the same time. Also, many dimensions of strength of the board of directors (e.g.
Pathan, 2009; Pathan and Faff, 2013; Beltratti and Stulz, 2012; Berger, Imbierowicz, and
Rauch, 2016; Roman, 2015) are not applicable. The supervisory board consists of share-
holders' representatives and elected employees according to the German codetermination
law. Representatives of shareholders are from the outside (one possible exception could
be former CEOs appointed to the supervisory board after having finished serving on the
executive board) and therefore all of them have to be classified as independent. Thus,
an independence measure of the supervisory board will show little variation across banks.
mance measures, in which we reduce performance persistence by sampling every other year.
3
While we cannot replicate board measures used in studies on US banks, we test whether
our results are robust to several measures that capture different facets of the executive
board, such as executive directors' tenure, age and academic degrees. These robustness
tests do not alter our conclusion: banks hiring good outsiders outperform those hiring
bad outsiders.
Studying bank corporate governance is of particular relevance because recent studies
identify it as a contributing factor to the financial crisis (e.g. Diamond and Rajan, 2009;
Berger et al., 2016). Berger et al. (2016), for example, find that in the case of US banks
non-CEO managers with high ownership stakes take higher risks, which consequently
increases the probability of bank default. However, not all studies come to the same
conclusion. For example, Beltratti and Stulz (2012) investigate performance implications
of shareholder-friendly boards. During the crisis, banks with shareholder-friendly boards
significantly underperformed other banks. We follow this literature by measuring outside
post-appointment effects separately for the pre- and post-crisis period. We find that the
performance differentials between good and bad outsiders strengthen in the post-crisis
period.
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. Section 2 develops our hypothe-
ses and introduces our study design. Section 3 describes the data, provides descriptive
statistics, and introduces our econometric model. Section 4 discusses the results of bank
performance in the post-appointment period, and delivers complementary results. Section
5 provides a conclusion to the study.
2 Hypothesis development and study design
Our study deals with members of the executive board who are appointed from outside
the bank. Such outside appointees already possess board experience and have developed
a set of skills in managing a bank, for example, with respect to implementing strategies,
hedging financial risks and supervising a large number of employees. Thus, hiring an ex-
ecutive director from outside may inject additional expertise into the boardroom (Boeker,
1997) and potentially enhances the current management quality (Huson, Malatesta, and
Parrino, 2004). This increase in management quality is expected to lead to an increase in
performance. In line with this, several studies document that operating performance of
non-financial firms improves following senior executive turnover events (Denis and Denis,
1995; Huson et al., 2004). However, Schaeck et al. (2012), who are among the first to
examine post-turnover effects in the banking industry, find negative post-turnover perfor-
mance effects. They argue that turnovers incurred costs (by the turnover itself or by the
ongoing restructuring process) that may contribute to greater losses and reduced prof-
itability in the post-turnover period.
An interesting and relevant question is whether all outside appointments entail similar
post-appointment performance effects since the literature documents that the group of
corporate executives is not homogeneous. Executives have different managerial styles,
and heterogeneity among them matters for corporate decisions (Bertrand and Schoar,
4
2003). Masulis and Mobbs (2011) document considerable differences among non-CEO
inside directors in the US. They find that firms' post-appointing operating performance
is higher when inside directors hold outside directorships (which is interpreted as a proxy
for experience and management quality). Examining individual characteristics, Kaplan,
Klebanov, and Sorensen (2012) find that subsequent firm performance after the appoint-
ment of CEOs is strongly related to what they call the general talent of those CEOs.
We hypothesize that the group of executive bank directors appointed from the outside is
not homogeneous, and possesses varying levels of managerial ability. We expect outsiders
with good managerial ability to outperform outsiders with bad managerial ability in the
post-appointment period.
Unfortunately, managerial ability cannot be directly observed. However, several stud-
ies find evidence supporting the argument that past performance is an indicator of man-
agerial ability. Chang et al. (2010) argue that if past performance reflects CEO ability,
then the stock market reaction to CEO departure should depend on past performance,
which is the result they find. Higher past performance leads to more outside director-
ships, as shown by Kaplan and Reishus (1990) for senior executives, Ferris, Jagannathan,
and Pritchard (2003) for corporate directors and executives, and Harford and Schonlau
(2013) for CEOs and directors. Fee and Hadlock (2003) find that CEOs appointed from
outside the company come from firms with above-average stock performance. The merger-
related literature also delivers insights into the relationship between past performance and
management outcomes. Wulf and Singh (2011) and Bargeron, Schlingemann, Stulz, and
Zutter (2009) find that target CEOs who perform better have a higher retention proba-
bility. We follow the idea of measuring managerial ability by past performance and use
the past performance of the executives' previous banks to distinguish between two types
of outside appointments.
In addition to past performance, we follow the novel approach of Demerjian et al.
(2012) and rest our second measure on managerial efficiency. Demerjian et al. (2012) find
that the strong negative relationship between equity financing and returns is substantially
lower for managers with higher managerial cost efficiency. They argue that the managers'
ability enables them to select the most promising projects with positive net present values.
This implies that managers with high managerial efficiency use issue proceeds more effec-
tively. Francis et al. (2016) use the values of managerial ability provided by Demerjian
et al. (2012) to build an index of relative peer quality. They find that firms with higher
relative peer quality tend to earn higher risk-adjusted stock returns and to have higher
profitability growth than firms with lower values. Using managerial profit efficiency, An-
dreou et al. (2016) find that banks managed by executives with higher abilities create
more liquidity and take on more risk. Our hypothesis is consequently that executive di-
rectors with higher values of managerial efficiency help the bank more in turning around
poor performance than those with lower values of managerial efficiency.
An outside appointment is very likely not an exogenous event (Murphy and Zimmer-
mann, 1993; Masulis and Mobbs, 2011; Fee, Hadlock, and Pierce, 2013). Adams and
Ferreira (2007) argue that directors who are appointed from the outside face an infor-
mational disadvantage compared to those appointed from the inside. This reasoning also
5
holds for appointing directors to executive boards. Insiders are already incorporated in
the business; they know the strategy in place as well as managers at lower management
levels. However, existing management may be responsible for poor performance. Parrino
(1997) and Huson, Parrino, and Starks (2001) provide evidence that executives are much
more likely to be appointed from the outside when the corporation faces financially bad
times. Bornemann, Kick, Pfingsten, and Schertler (2015) argue that external successors
are more often appointed when the bank needs a clear revision of its strategy. Thus, poor-
performing and high-risk banks tend to appoint outsiders more often than other banks in
order to bring in new talent, increase expertise in the boardroom and clean up the bank.
Thus, appointments of executive directors from the outside and bank performance are
simultaneously determined.
In such a setting, ordinary least square and fixed-effects regressions may deliver biased
estimates (Wintoki, Linck, and Netter, 2012). To deal with this endogeneity issue, our
study design contains three elements. First, we consider lagged performance measures
in our estimations to control for as many unobservable effects as possible and reduce
performance persistence by considering every other year only. Consequently, we use an
estimation method well suited to such a dynamic panel data model: we estimate the
performance effects of outside appointments using dynamic panel generalized method of
moments (GMM) estimations. This estimation method is well established in the context
of board structure and performance and has also been employed in a number of recent
studies (e.g. Wintoki et al., 2012; Pathan and Faff, 2013; Pathan, 2009; Garc´
ia-Meca,
Garc´
ia-S´
anchez, and Mart´
inez-Ferrero, 2015; Bornemann et al., 2015).
Second, we use a large number of bank-specific and macroeconomic variables to con-
trol for differences in banks' financial situations, business models, ownership structures,
and so forth to ensure that the post-appointment effect we measure is not driven by other
characteristics of the banks. More specifically, we include several measures of capital-
ization, measures to capture credit and other risk exposures, as well as off-balance sheet
items. GDP growth and the government spread curve are used to control for the macroe-
conomic environment. All these variables will be introduced in more detail later in the
data section. By using such a large number of control variables, we seek to minimize the
problem of omitted variables and control for the observation that outsiders are more often
appointed to high-risk banks than insiders.
In addition to the aforementioned two elements, we attempt to deal with a potential
selection issue of good outsiders. Candidates from high-performing banks and a proven
track record may be unwilling to take job offers from risky banks (Dalton and Kesner,
1985), while bad outsiders may receive job offers only from high-risk banks. Good out-
siders may forgo appointments to boards of high-risk banks because they may fear dam-
age to their reputation and reduced chances in the job market for executive directors.
Executive directors who are fired may incur reputational damage both irrespective of
their management qualities and of whether they were responsible for the poor perfor-
mance. Jenter and Kanaan (2015) document that corporate boards do not filter out
exogenous shocks to firm performance before deciding on CEO dismissal. In order to
ascertain whether post-appointment performance effects are driven by selection rather
6
than executives' managerial abilities, we create interaction terms in order to identify the
performance effects of good outsiders at high-risk banks, which we then compare with
the performance effects of bad outsiders at similarly high-risk banks. Thus, our strategy
basically builds on the insight that selection should involve a clear cross-sectional order of
appointments. For these tests, we interact our key outsider variables with banks' risks in
the pre-appointment year and use several risk metrics to build interaction terms in order
to provide robust findings.
3 Data
3.1 Sample
The data used in this study is taken from the Deutsche Bundesbank's prudential database,
BAKIS, which contains information on the financial statements and supervisory reports
of German banks. We use this database to obtain balance-sheet information for all banks
belonging to the German universal banking system between 1993 and 2014. This system
comprises three different types of universal banks: private commercial banks, cooperative
banks and savings banks. These banking groups differ in terms of ownership structure,
business models and also regional focus. Savings banks operate not only commercially
but, in contrast to commercial and cooperative banks, they also have a public mandate
(Brunner, Decressin, Hardy, and Kudela, 2004). Cooperative banks are established as
mutual organizations and serve the interest of their owners. Commercial banks include
large banks that are internationally active and listed on stock exchanges, and smaller
commercial banks, which are partnerships, private limited companies or sole proprietors
(Brunner et al., 2004). We consider all three types of universal banks. BAKIS also con-
tains information on executive board members which allows us to trace their movements
from one bank board to another.
Table 1 shows how we build up our sample. Overall we count 3,956 banks, which deliver
as many as 53,285 bank-years. We exclude observations for which neither balance-sheet
information nor information on the executive board is available for the current or previous
year. In our sample period, a large number of merger and acquisition (M&A) transactions
took place. The target bank is then integrated and no longer files reports under its
former institutional ID. Such an M&A transaction not only increases the acquirer's size,
but also influences risk and capitalization as well as returns. We control for these M&A
transactions by artificially creating a "new bank". The new bank is independent of its pre-
M&A entities and begins its existence in the M&A year. When applying a dynamic model,
this M&A treatment removes appointments to the executive board in the year in which
the bank acquires another bank, which ensures that we do not commingle appointments
driven by mergers with those that result for any other reason. Our sample contains
2,793 banks before and 4,205 banks after the M&A treatment with 38,892 bank-year
observations.

Note: The table shows the number of German universal banks and bank-years for the period 1993

The M&A treatment artificially creates a "new bank" independent of the pre-M&A entities, which
begins operations in the merger year. This M&A treatment increases the number of cross-sections in
our sample.
3.2 Appointments from the outside and performance
We use board information for two consecutive years to identify new appointees to the
executive board. When at least one new executive director shows up on the board, we
classify this as an appointment regardless of whether the total number of board mem-
bers increases, remains constant or decreases. Table 2 provides the number of banks
with appointments to executive boards between 1994 and 2014. The number gradually
decreases over time, which is due to the reduced number of banks in Germany, a trend
that is related to the consolidation wave in the banking industry. Overall, we count 7,203
appointments of executive directors including those from inside the bank as well as those
from outside with an employment history at another bank. We call executive directors
who have boardroom experience at another bank and no previous employment history in
the boardroom of the appointing bank outsiders.3 At the bank level, an outside appoint-
ment occurs when at least one executive director from outside the bank is appointed to
the executive board. In contrast, inside appointments are those in which the appointee
has no boardroom experience at a German bank.
3Denis and Denis (1995) and Berger, Kick, Koetter, and Schaeck (2013) also use previous employments
to distinguish between appointments from the outside and inside.

Note: The table reports the number of appointments to German banks' executive boards. Outsider
denotes appointments in which at least one executive director with boardroom experience at another
bank is appointed to the executive board. Historical ROA and managerial RRE denote the ability
measures used to split the group of outside appointments into GOOD and BAD. GOOD (BAD)
refers to appointments in which at least one outsider with above-median (below-median) value in the
ability measure is hired.
Further, we classify outside appointments as good or bad by using either historical
ROA or managerial RRE. Historical ROA is based on balance-sheet information for the
executives' previous banks. We employ risk-, size- and time-adjusted performance mea-
sures of the previous bank and proceed as follows: first, we consider risk by using ROA
relative to its standard deviation. To control for size effects, we calculate a mean ROA

for ten deciles (peer group) formed on banks' total assets in each year. Calculating this
for each year removes time effects. Afterwards, we subtract the mean of the peer group
from a bank's ROA

to determine how the bank performed relative to its peer group in
the same fiscal year. We use up to four fiscal years before the outsider left the previous
bank to calculate the average of her/his previous bank's adjusted performance. Then, we
classify appointments of outsiders as good (bad) if the average historical ROA of their pre-
vious bank lies in the upper (lower) half of the previous-bank historical ROA distribution.

Our second measure of managerial ability4 combines two strands of the literature,
namely the literature on bank efficiency and managerial ability. Bank efficiency considers
input prices, the output mix and provides an overall, objectively determined ranking value
(Berger and Humphrey, 1997). It is often estimated with stochastic frontier analysis be-
cause an important drawback of nonparametric frontier approaches like data envelopment
analysis, used to investigate firm efficiency (Demerjian et al., 2012), rest on the assump-
tion of no random errors (Berger and Humphrey, 1997). Thus, the stochastic frontier
analysis is better equipped to accommodate noise in the measurement of input, output,
and price variables (Andreou et al., 2016). Instead of estimating cost efficiency (e.g. De-
merjian et al., 2012; Francis et al., 2016) or profit efficiency (e.g. Andreou et al., 2016),
we estimate risk-return efficiency, hereafter RRE, because Koetter (2008) and Hughes
et al. (1996) argue that efficiency estimates control insufficiently for bank risk and may
be misleading especially when risk preferences differ. We follow banking efficiency studies
(i.e., Hughes et al., 1996; Hughes, Mester, and Moon, 2001; Koetter, 2008; Andreou et al.,
2016), and choose the stochastic frontier analysis (SFA) to estimate the RRE frontier.
Then, we use the intuition by Demerjian et al. (2012) to parse out managerial ability
from full efficiency. For this, we regress the full bank RRE on various bank-specific char-
acteristics, such as size and risk, to control for bank-specific efficiency determinants. The
remaining residual from this regression is our second measure of managerial ability. We
use the managerial efficiency information from up to four fiscal years before the outsider
left the previous bank to calculate the average managerial RRE and classify outsiders as
good (bad) if the average managerial RRE lies in the upper (lower) half of the distribution.
Table 2 shows that we identify as many as 1,756 bank-years with outside appoint-
ments, which include 825 (815) good and 931 (941) bad outside appointments based on
historical ROA (managerial RRE). We classify cases as bad outside appointments if both
types of executive directors from the outside are appointed to the same bank board in the
same year.5 Our findings, however, do not depend on this classification. Since almost 90%
of all outside appointments are appointments of one executive director only, we do not
discriminate between cases with one and more executive directors appointed from outside
in the same year. Our number of appointments is lower than that reported by Berger
et al. (2013) since we exclude executive directors appointed in merger years. Moreover,
our number of outside appointments is lower than their number because our definition
of outside appointments rests on identifying the previous bank of the executive director
in the year directly before s/he is appointed. Thus, an executive director who has not
served on an executive board in the previous 10 years but served on an executive board
11 years ago is classified as an insider in our study.
We consider two alternative proxies of bank performance: risk-adjusted return on
equity (RROE) and risk-adjusted return on assets (RROA). We divide each performance
measure by its standard deviation to obtain risk-adjusted performance measures. In Table
3, we first present univariate tests on performance effects of good and bad outsiders, which
we compare with the performance effects around insider appointments. More specifically,
4We describe the estimation procedure of managerial RRE in more detail in the Appendix.
5When using historical ROA (managerial RRE), bad outside appointments include 14 (35) cases
where the information of the executive's previous bank was not available.
10
we present performance measures averaged over various windows, from one year up to
five years, both before and after the event occurred. The table delivers two insights.
First, before the event occurs, banks appointing an executive director from the outside
have significantly lower performance than those that appoint an insider to the executive
board. This holds regardless of whether we study performance in the one- or five-year
window before the appointment. This is in line with the findings in the literature that
outsiders are more often appointed to clean up banks. Second, differences in risk-adjusted
performance between insiders and bad outsiders after the event become less significant for
higher windows, indicating that banks appointing bad outsiders are catching up, relatively
speaking. For good outsiders and applying the historical ROA as an ability measure, we
even see a change in the order: before the appointment event, insider banks performed
better, on average, than banks appointing good outsiders, but after the event, the opposite
holds when we measure performance over more than two years. When using managerial
RRE as an ability measure, we also find that good outsiders catch up compared to insiders,
however, the effect is less pronounced.

appoint insiders, and good and bad outsiders. Historical ROA and managerial
RRE denote the ability measures used to split the group of outsiders. GOOD
(BAD) refers to appointments in which at least one outsider with above-
median (below-median) value in managerial ability is hired. Windows refers
to the number of years considered when calculating the mean either before or
after the appointment. t - value comes from two-tailed t-tests.

where yi,t
denotes the performance measure of bank i in year t. To account for the high
persistence in German bank profitability, we follow Wintoki et al. (2012) and only use
observations for every second year (1994, 1996, 1998, 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010,
2012 and 2014).6 Table 1 shows that the 2-year sampling leads to 2,582 banks and 15,491
bank-year observations.
Table 4 delivers descriptive statistics of the performance measures, outsider variables
and control variables, and a detailed definition of all variables used is given in Table 5.
We remove extreme values by winsorizing the performance measures and control variables
at the 1st and 99th percentiles. We see that the sample mean (median) RROE is 2.04%
(1.91%) and that of RROA equals 2.21% (2.09%), which are comparable to the values
presented in Busch and Kick (2015) for the German banking industry.
6We also replicate our analysis on data for every year between 1993 and 2014. The results of our
analysis remain unchanged, but the outcomes of diagnostic tests become less significant, which may point
to autocorrelation. These results are available upon request.

To examine the performance effects of outside appointments, we start with a dummy
variable Outsideri,t
, which equals 1 for the bank that appoints an outsider in year t,
and zero otherwise. Additionally, we derive lags of this dummy variable to examine the
post-appointment effects. We use four dummy variables for the post-appointment period
spanning an overall time period of up to eight years after the outside appointment. Ac-
cordingly, the dummy variable Outsideri,t-j
equals 1 if the bank appoints an outsider in
the past t-j whereas each time step, j = 1, 2, 3 or 4, contains two years since we sample
every second year. Each lagged outsider dummy variable equals 1 in two years instead
of one year to capture post-appointment performance effects of outsiders in the sampled
and omitted years.
Board Controlsi,t
contains two variables to control for elements of corporate gover-
nance. We follow recent literature of corporate governance (Berger, Kick, and Schaeck,
2014; Berger et al., 2013; Garc´
ia-Meca et al., 2015; Delis, Gaganis, Hasan, and Pasiouras,
2016) and measure the diversity of banks' executive board structure with Board Diversity
(ln), which was introduced by Anderson, Reeb, Upadhyay, and Zhao (2011) and imple-
mented for German banks by Berger et al. (2013). Our board diversity considers the
15
banks' board dimensions in age, gender, education (measured by academic degrees), and
job experience (computed by tenure). To yield this index, we first calculate coefficient of
variation (which equals the ratio of the standard deviation divided by the mean) for each
of the four dimensions. For each of the four dimensions, we assign a value of 1 (2, 3, 4) if
the bank's value falls into the 1st (2nd, 3rd, 4th) quartile of the distribution. Finally, the
index of board diversity results from summing up the four different dimensions. We take
the natural log since the index is skewed. Our second board control measure is the change
in board size from the previous to the current year with the variable  Board Size.7
Bank Controlsi,t-1
comprises the first lag of all bank-specific continuous and discrete
control variables. We justify the use of a large number of bank controls in light of en-
dogeneity concerns. We use the capital adequacy ratio, CAR, to control for a bank's
financial leverage measured in terms of regulatory equity. A higher CAR is likely to indi-
cate a healthier bank. The sample mean (median) CAR is 10.59% (8.88%). We further
include a dummy variable, DISSw3
, to control for banks which receive capital injections,
or are subject to severe regulatory interventions (i.e. moratorium) or exit the market
in a distressed merger. We include fee income to total income, Share Fee. The mean
(median) Share Fee in our sample equals 11.77% (10.85%) and higher than those for
savings banks in Bornemann et al. (2015) since our sample considers private commercial
banks, which are more active in fee business than savings and cooperative banks. We also
include the ratio of off-balance sheet items to total assets, OBS, for two reasons. One is
that banks might use off-balance sheet items to reduce their risks. Another is that off-
balance sheet items themselves may include risky investment assets, which may decrease
performance when they materialize, in many cases at the same time (Kick and Prieto,
2015). The mean (median) of OBS in our sample is equal to 2.77% (2.08%). We consider
customer loans to total assets, CL, because loans represent a main source of income for
German banks (Memmel and Schertler, 2012). The sample mean (median) CL is 57.86%
(59.82%). We use the ratio of non-performing loans to total assets, NPL, to proxy the
quality of credit exposure (Meeker and Gray, 1987). The sample mean (median) NPL
equals 3.35% (2.70%). Following Berger et al. (2014), our second credit risk measure is
a Herfindahl-Hirschman Index, HHI, for concentration in the loan portfolio, calculated
with 8 sectors and log-transformed because it is skewed. A high HHI indicates a more
concentrated loan portfolio and thus higher credit risk. The sample mean (median) HHI
(ln) is 3.33% (3.25%).
Size effects are controlled for using bank size, measured by the natural logarithm of to-
tal assets (deflated), TA. This accounts for the fact that larger banks have more complex
business structures and networks, invest more resources in high-quality risk management,
work with a wider range of customers and can therefore better diversify their income struc-
ture than small banks. The sample mean (median) TA (ln) is 19.56 (19.47). Ownership
structures are controlled for using pillar dummy variables. The majority of banks in our
sample are cooperative banks (70%) followed by savings banks (24%), private commer-
cial banks (6%) and the very large commercial banks and head institutes of cooperative
and savings banks (1%). We include the dummies D COOP, D PRIV and D BIG to
7We only include board size as an additional explanatory variable in robustness tests (see Section 4.4)
because it is highly correlated with bank size.
16
account for the bank pillar of cooperative and private commercial banks and for the very
large institutes and omit the dummy for savings banks to avoid perfect collinearity.
The process of incorporating target banks may induce structural changes not only in
the year of the M&A transaction; it may, in fact, take much more than a year to integrate
entities. Especially in savings and cooperative banks, M&A transactions are mostly con-
ducted with a strong eye on social comparability for the employees. This might be more
cost-intensive and extend the time needed for integration. In most cases, the transaction
is prepared in the pre-merger year and affects the financial situation of the acquirer in the
post-merger years. In addition to our aforementioned treatment of M&A transactions, we
include Mergeri,t
which comprises two dummy variables. The dummy variable Targeti,w3
equals 1 if the bank is the target of an M&A transaction in the current or following year,
zero otherwise. We set the dummy equal to 1 in two years instead of one year because
most target banks no longer report data in the merger year. For the post-merger period
of the acquirer bank, we use a dummy variable Acquireri,w3
that equals 1 in the first two
years after completion of the M&A transaction. Setting this dummy variable equal to 1
only in the post-merger year would remove it from the dynamic panel estimations.
Finally, Macro Controlst
comprises GDP Growth and Spread (interest rate spread
between 10-year and 1-year government bonds) with which we control for the macroeco-
nomic environment. Y eart
refers to year dummy variables to control for remaining time
effects. µi
is a fixed effect for bank i, and i,t
denotes the remaining disturbance term.
In order to ensure that our specifications do not suffer from multicollinearity, we
present pair-wise correlation coefficients between performance measures and explanatory
variables in Table 6. Since the correlation coefficients between the explanatory variables
are not higher than 0.30 (the highest value between TA and HHI and DISSw3
and NPL
is 0.30 and the next peak between CAR and Share Fee is 0.28), multicollinearity is not
a problem in our regression specifications.

Note: The table displays correlation coefficients between performance measures, outsider variables and explanatory
variables. All variables are defined in Table 5. * indicates the correlation coefficient is significant at the 1% level.
To further control for omitted variables and banks' past performance, we consider
a lag of the dependent variable in our model. Therefore, we estimate Eq. (1) by using
a dynamic panel estimator, which is a GMM estimator, with a finite sample correction
developed by Windmeijer (2005). An important aspect of this estimator is the use of
historical values as instruments for current changes. For these instruments to be valid,
they must fulfill two criteria: the historical information must provide a source of variation
for current values, and the instruments must be uncorrelated with the error in the per-
formance equation. This implies that there must be no additional information contained
in the econometric model, which remains unexplained and correlates with the instruments.
We use two two-year sampled lags of the dependent variable as instruments. Since our
regression sample includes every second year, we include the information from up to six
years before the outsider is appointed in our instruments. As suggested by Wintoki et al.
(2012), two lags can be sufficient to capture the dynamic dimension between performance
and board measures. Accordingly, we expect information from the previous six years to be
sufficient. We check the reliability of GMM estimation results by performing two tests: the
Hansen test of instrument validity and the Arellano and Bond (1991) test of serially un-
correlated error terms. The diagnostic tests of our various specifications show insignificant
test statistics for Hansen J-statistics of over-identifying restrictions, indicating that the in-
struments are valid. By way of construction, the specifications document a significant first-
order autocorrelation (AR(1)); second-order autocorrelation (AR(2)) is absent, however.

4 Empirical results
4.1 Pre- and post-appointment bank performance
In Table 7, we present regression results from running Eq. (1) for our dependent variables
RROE (Columns (1)-(5)) and RROA (Column (6)). The negative and significant coef-
ficient on Outsideri,t
in Column (1) reveals that bank performance is significantly lower
when executive directors with boardroom experience at other banks are appointed. More-
over, lower performance of appointing banks is persistent as we find significant effects in
post-appointment years. The negative and significant coefficient on Outsideri,t-1
reveals
that banks with incoming outside executives perform significantly worse in the first and
second years after appointing outsiders than banks without appointment events. Even af-
ter three and five years, as captured by the coefficients on Outsideri,t-2
and Outsideri,t-3
,
a bank with an outside appointment underperforms other banks. Only after seven years
do we no longer observe a significant performance differential between bank-years with
and without outside appointments. We regard these negative performance effects as being
in line with the findings of Schaeck et al. (2012), who document that executive turnovers
at US banks correlate with lower profitability and greater losses over a post-turnover
period of three years.

Note: Coefficients from dynamic panel estimations with Windmeijer (2005) corrected standard
errors below the coefficients. In Columns (1)-(5), the dependent variable is RROE, and in Column
(6) it is RROA. In Column (1), we present the results of our baseline model given in Eq. (1)
Outsideri,t-j
with j = 0, 1, 2, 3, 4. In Columns (2) and (4)-(6), we replace outsider variables with
dummy variables for good and bad outsiders split up according to historical ROA. In Column (3),
we report the results for good and bad outsiders split up according to their managerial RRE.
In Columns (2)-(6) we add GOODt+1
and BADt+1
to control for the pre-appointment year.
Column (4) shows the results for savings banks and Column (5) for private banks. Variables are
listed in Table 5. Year dummies are included, but not reported. JPE (joint performance effect)
depicts the sum of all coefficients belonging to a particular outsider type. *, ** and *** indicate
significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5% and 1% level.
21
Next, we test whether this initial insight holds for all outsiders. In Columns (2) and (3)
of Table 7 we display results where all outsider variables are replaced by ten dummy vari-
ables: five variables for each outsider type, maintaining the lagged variables to tackle
post-appointment effects. Column (2) is based on historical ROA, and Column (3) uses
managerial RRE as an ability measure. The coefficient on BADi,t
reveals that banks that
appoint bad outsiders perform significantly more poorly in appointment years, whereas
the coefficient on GOODi,t
is also negative but is only half the size of the bad coefficient.
RROE of banks with bad outsiders is 0.301 lower (Column (2)), which is large in economic
terms since it accounts for more than 21% of the RROE's standard deviation. Further-
more, coefficients on bad outsiders in the post-appointment period are significant whereas
the higher order lagged coefficients on good outsiders are insignificant. In unreported
tests, we find an insignificant performance differential for the fourth lag of good and bad
outside appointments, while all others are significant. Thus, only after seven years fol-
lowing the appointment do banks appointing good outsiders no longer differ from those
appointing bad outsiders. These findings hold regardless of the ability measure we employ.
We also calculate joint performance effects by summing up all coefficients of good and
bad outsider dummy variables to determine how much lower the performance is overall
for banks appointing good and bad outsiders. For historical ROA (Column (2)), the
joint performance effect of bad outsiders is -0.837 and is highly significant, while the joint
performance effect of good outsiders, which is -0.25, lacks significance. We test the null
that the joint effects of good and bad outsiders are equal and obtain significant F-values
for historical ROA (Column (2)) and managerial RRE (Column (3)), indicating that the
performance path of banks hiring good outsiders differs significantly from that of banks
appointing bad outsiders.
We additionally include variables that indicate the pre-appointment year of good and
bad outsiders to figure out whether the risk-adjusted performance differs before the ap-
pointment. GOODi,t+1
(BADi,t+1
) is a dummy variable which equals 1 in the year before
a bank appoints a good (bad) outsider. Thus, following the approach of Kaplan and
Minton (1994), we extend the investigation to the pre-appointment year. Doing so means
that we control for an event that takes place in the future, which can be regarded as
econometrically questionable. Therefore, the following findings should not be overstated.
We see that bad outside appointments based on historical ROA and managerial RRE
are significantly worse in the pre-appointment year than in non-appointment years. This
negative effect of bad outsiders is in line with the finding in the literature that external suc-
cessions are often preceded by poor accounting performance (e.g. Denis and Denis, 1995)
and that external successors are expected to clean up banks (Bornemann et al., 2015).
We test the null that the coefficients on good and bad outsiders in the pre-appointment
year are equal and find insignificant F-values for both ability measures. Following from
this, we can conclude that the performance of banks appointing good outsiders does not
differ from the one of banks appointing bad outsiders in the pre-appointment year.
We present results for the subsamples of savings banks in Column (4), and for private
banks in Column (5). Since our sample contains less than 140 private commercial banks
with no more than 70 outside appointments, we combine them with cooperative banks
22
to the group of private banks as they have a similar ownership structure. From the sub-
sample of private banks, we exclude the few very large commercial banks, and the head
institutions of cooperative banks, since they differ too greatly in size, business models
and governance for us to analyze their performance together with the huge number of
small and medium-sized banks. Regarding our key variables of interest, we find that the
coefficients on bad outsiders are negative and significant while those for good outsiders are
much lower. The subsample analysis highlights the fact that outsider effects differ some-
what across savings and private banks. The negative performance effect of bad outsiders
in the post-appointment years is somewhat stronger for private banks than for savings
banks. The joint performance effect of bad outsiders for savings banks is -0.673, while
that for private banks is even higher, at -0.943. We conclude that performance effects of
appointing an outsider in savings and private banks have the same tendency, but joint
performance effects of good and bad outside appointments do not significantly differ in
private banks.
In Column (6), we use RROA as the dependent variable and see that it leads to similar
conclusions to our baseline in Column (2). The estimated joint performance effect for bad
outsiders for RROA is somewhat higher than the one we find for RROE. The economic
effects of bad outsiders are, however, very close to each other since the standard devia-
tion of RROA is higher than that of RROE. Thus, it matters little which risk-adjusted
performance measure we use. We do not present subsample results for RROA, nor results
on our alternative ability measure because they resemble the results of RROE.
Some control variables are also significantly and consistently related to risk-adjusted
performance measures. The change in board size,  Board Sizei,t
, is significantly negative
indicating lower performance when banks are in the process of extending their board.8
The negative and significant coefficient on HHI indicates that a more concentrated loan
portfolio is associated with worse performance. The coefficient on bank size identifies
a positive relationship between a bank's total assets and performance. This is in line
with the argument that larger banks are more diversified (Chiorazzo, Milani, and Salvini,
2008). Also the negative and significant coefficient on DISSw3
, which indicates a bank
being in distress, is in line with the findings of the other risk measures. The effect of
M&A transactions has more to do with the pre-merger year of the targets than with
the acquiring banks. The effects of other bank-specific variables on performance depend
on the specification and sample chosen. For instance, higher off-balance-sheet items,
OBS, are associated with poorer performance of private banks. Thus, an increase in such
items decreases bank performance. An increase in the volume of non-performing loans,
NPL, which accompanies a lower credit quality (Meeker and Gray, 1987), is associated
with poorer performance of private banks. A higher CAR is associated with improved
performance for savings banks only, and an increase in Share Fee leads to better risk-
adjusted performance but only when measured by RROE in the full sample. The positive
and significant coefficients on GDP Growth and Spread suggest that bank performance
increases pro-cyclically and with a positive yield curve for both savings and private banks.
8This variable also captures part of the effect stemming from inside appointments, which we investi-
gate further in Section 4.4.
23
4.2 Outsider and pre-appointment bank risk
Our findings may indicate that good outsiders outperform bad outsiders. However, an
alternative explanation for the performance differential between banks appointing good
and bad outsiders may be that good outsiders select banks with lower risk, while bad out-
siders are more likely to be hired by banks in very bad financial shape. Thus, the outside
appointment dummy variable may simply pick up where this effect left off. Although we
have already controlled for a large number of risk-related variables, this might be insuf-
ficient when these risk measures also determine which outsider accepts which job offer.
Our next step, therefore, is to take into account risk differences between the banks before
the outsider is appointed to trace possible selection effects by distinguishing between low-
and high-risk banks appointing good and bad outsiders.
Our workhorse in this part of the analysis is a probability of bank distress (PD) of the
banks in our sample. This PD comes from an econometric model, which is explained in
detail in the Appendix, that considers balance-sheet as well as regulatory data on banks'
capitalization, funding, lending and investment behavior. We use this as a workhorse,
since it combines the different dimensions of bank risk into a single number for each bank
and year. As alternative risk measures, we use the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index of the loan
portfolio (HHI, ln), and non-performing loans (NPL). However these measures consider
risk-bearing parts of balance-sheet composition and not a bank's risk exposure overall. A
higher PD, HHI and NPL indicate higher risk.
In Table 8, we list descriptive statistics of the three proxies of bank risk for the full
sample, and for the sample of good and bad outside appointments in the pre-appointment
year. The numbers support the view that banks with outside appointments are riskier
than banks without these appointments, which is in line with the argument that executive
directors from the outside are more often appointed to clean up. Moreover, the displayed
cross-section variations of PD, HHI and NPL, and in the pre-appointment year indicate
that banks with bad outside appointments are more risky than those which appoint good
outsiders. According to t-tests, the differences in risk are significant especially when we
use historical ROA as an ability measure. This supports the selection argument for good
and bad outsiders: good outsiders, on average, are hired by less risky banks than bad
outsiders.

Note: The table displays mean, median (p50) and standard deviation (sd) of three prox-
ies of bank risk for the full sample and subsamples of all, good and bad outsiders from
their respective pre-appointment years. We use banks' probability of bank distress (PD), a
Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI, ln) that measures the concentration of the loan portfolio
and the ratio of non-performing loans to total assets (NPL). t-value comes from two-tailed
t-tests between good and bad outside appointments.
To test whether this selection accounts for performance differentials, we split the
dummy variables of good and bad outsiders into two parts according to the bank risk
in the year before the executive director is appointed. We build the PD interaction
term on the 90th percentile of the full sample distribution. This ensures that the group of
high-risk banks includes those that are relatively close to financial distress; an alternative,
splitting at the median PD, delivers too few observations for bad outsiders in low-risk
banks. In Table 9, Panel A, we present the results for RROE with these PD interaction
terms for good and bad outsiders. To save space, we only report joint performance effects.
Results on our control variables and diagnostic tests are similar to those presented earlier
(for all tables to come, we present the full version in the Appendix of this paper). For
high-default banks, we find that good outside appointments significantly outperform bad
outside appointments, but less so for low-default banks. Thus, especially in banks needing
the turnaround the most, good outsiders do a better job than bad outsiders.
To see whether this conclusion also holds for other risk measures, we employ HHI
and NPL, and use the median of the aforementioned risk proxies of the full sample which
delivers a sufficient number of cases in each group. For banks with a high concentration
in HHI or a high ratio of NPL in their loan portfolios, our two measures of ability point
toward the same conclusion as for the overall bank risk measure: good outsiders help the
most in turning around bad bank performance.

4.3 Outside appointments before and after the financial crisis
Since our sample spans the time before and after the financial crisis, we next test whether
appointment effects differ in the pre- and post-crisis period. Thus, we have an eye on
whether the years of the financial crisis changed the performance channel of appointing
good and bad executive directors from the outside. To determine whether the financial
crisis has implications, we measure the performance effect for good and bad outside ap-
pointments separately for the years 1993-2006, and 2007-2014.9 In Table 10, we present

joint performance effects of good and bad outside appointments using historical ROA
(Columns (1)-(3)), and managerial RRE (Columns (4)-(6)). For the full sample (Columns
(1) and (4)), we find that banks with bad outside appointments underperform those with
good outside appointments both in the pre-crisis and post-crisis period. The statistical
significance is, however, always higher in the post-crisis period than in the pre-crisis pe-
riod, but we do not find any significant differences between bad outside appointments
before and after the crisis in the full sample.

Note: This table reports results from 6 GMM estimations with Windmeijer (2005) corrected
standard errors. The dependent variable is RROE. Joint performance effects (JPE) of
various outside appointments separately measured for the pre- and post-crisis period are
depicted. The pre-crisis period contains the years 1993-2006 and the post-crisis period the
years 2007-2014. In Columns (1)-(3), we split up the group of outsiders according to historical
ROA and in Columns (4)-(6) according to managerial RRE. Columns (1) and (4) represent
the full sample. Columns (2) and (5) show the results for savings banks and Columns (3) and
(6) for private banks. All bank-specific, macro and year dummy variables listed in Eq. (1)
are included, but not reported. *, ** and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1%.
Interesting are the findings for private banks, as the separation in a pre-crisis and
post-crisis period delivers new insights. Results in Table 7 seem to indicate that private
banks have a similar pattern of appointment effects than savings banks in the sense that
the joint performance effect of bad outsiders is more negative than that of good outsiders.
However, we could not establish a significant difference of joint performance effects be-
tween good and bad outside appointments of private banks. Splitting the appointment
effect in a pre-crisis and post-crisis period indicates that private banks have the same ten-
dency in the post-crisis period but not in the pre-crisis period. This tendency stems from
a change in the performance effects of good outside appointments. In the pre-crisis period,
the performance effect of good outside appointments is significantly negative, which is not
the case in the post-crisis period. According to an F-test, the performance effect of good
outside appointments differs significantly between the pre- and post-crisis period, regard-
less of the managerial ability measure used to classify good and bad outside appointments.
With respect to our results on the pre- and post-crisis period, a note of caution is in
order. While we label the period from 2007 to 2014 as the post-crisis period, the split may
not capture effects stemming from the financial crisis as in other studies that primarily
capture US banks (e.g. Fahlenbrach and Stulz, 2011; Berger et al., 2016). The reason for
27
this is that the majority of banks in our sample are small and medium-sized banks with
almost no exposure to US subprime products. Therefore, these small and medium-sized
banks were not hit directly by the value drop in subprime mortgages, but most likely
by the Euro crisis and monetary policy. Moreover, German banks are faced with higher
regulatory requirements, which partly stem from the crisis. Thus, the post-crisis effect
we measure for outside appointments captures all these influences at the same time.
4.4 Complementary results
In this section we present a number of robustness tests and extensions (detailed results
are tabulated in the Appendix). First, we use difference-in-differences estimations to
check whether our results are robust to an alternative approach, which has been used
in many recent studies on manager and director appointments (e.g. Berger et al., 2014;
Min, 2013). The treatment group are banks with newly appointed outsiders in which no
further turnover, merger or distress event occurred in the three years surrounding the
appointment year. The control group consists of banks without any turnover, merger
or distress events in the preceding and following two years. For each bank in the treat-
ment group we match control banks with replacement from the same year and banking
group, and from the same size and ROA deciles in the year before the treatment bank
appoints the outsider. Results from this alternative approach confirm our findings. More
specifically, we find that banks with bad outside appointments significantly underperform
control banks, while banks with good outside appointments do not. We use this ap-
proach as a robustness test rather than our main approach for the following reasons: first,
for many of the treatment banks, we are not able to find an appropriate match partner
in terms of pre-event size and ROA, so the number of banks considered is much lower,
which may raise concerns of sample selection. Second, with the difference-in-differences
approach we cannot control for the fact that several appointments to the same executive
board occur in adjoining years. Also, difference-in-differences estimations require that
the event is exogenous. However, for outside appointments it can hardly be argued that
these events are exogenous since the risk-profile of banks may determine their outside ap-
pointment behavior. A natural exception to this rule is the unexpected death of a director.
Our second set of robustness tests deals with the structure of the executive board.
First, we find that our results hold when we exclude the board diversity index and the
change in board size. Second, we test whether adding inside appointments, i.e., execu-
tive directors who have not accumulated any boardroom experience outside their current
bank, has an effect. Consequently, we add variables of insider appointments to the list of
variables in Eq. (1). We find that appointments of insiders are associated with a negative
joint performance effect, which is significantly weaker than the joint performance effect
of bad outsiders in Column (2) of Table 7. Third, we consider the size of the executive
board, which has a significant negative effect on risk-adjusted performance. Fourth, we
add the boards' average age and experience, however neither are significantly related to
the bank performance. Fifth, we add the average tenure of bank executive directors,
which turns out to be significantly positively related to the performance indicating that
either directors with longer tenure generate more value or that executive directors stay
longer at banks with high performance. It is important for our conclusion that excluding
28
or including these additional board characteristics does not change the post-appointment
effects we find for good and bad outsiders.10
Finally, we examine whether potential causes of the appointment event are related to
performance differentials. We distinguish three groups of appointments. The first group
contains turnover events triggered by the retirement of an executive director. We clas-
sify an appointment as triggered by retirement when an incumbent executive director is
older than 60 years and when s/he stops serving on this board in the appointment or
pre-appointment year, as in e.g. Huson et al. (2004) and Bornemann et al. (2015).11 The
second group contains cases where outsiders are appointed to replace an incumbent execu-
tive director who is not retiring. Consequently, these turnover events are triggered by any
other reason, such as a resignation or dismissal. The third group consists of appointments
where the board size increases. These three types may differ substantially because retire-
ment turnovers are a relatively orderly process (Khurana and Nohria, 2000) where the
incumbent executive director might be involved in selecting her/his successors, which is
even more likely when the CEO retires (Shivdasani and Yermack, 1999). Non-retirement
turnovers are potentially less orderly and might be more disruptive events (Khurana and
Nohria, 2000), such as the (in)voluntary resignation of an incumbent executive. Thus,
these events might be characterized by a shortage of time to adequately structure the
process. Appointments when the board size increases enhance the body of expertise in
the boardroom since all other members will continue serve on the board.
Table 11 delivers information on the total number of outside appointments as well
as the numbers of good and bad outside appointments based on the two ability mea-
sures on the one hand, and of retirement, non-retirement turnover and board-increase
appointments, on the other. In our sample, relatively few outside appointments are asso-
ciated with a replacement of incumbent executives who are not retiring. In only 15.72%
of all outside appointments does an outsider replaces an executive director who is not
retiring. We have no evidence that good outside appointments are more likely to be cho-
sen during retirement turnovers, while bad outsiders are hired to serve on boards after
non-retirement turnovers, or vice versa. As shown for historical ROA, 44.57% of all non-
retirement turnovers and 49.84% of all retirement turnovers are associated with hiring a
good outsider. Thus, good and bad outside appointments and replacement (retirement
and non-retirement) and appointments with board increase seem to be fairly independent
of one another.
10One other robustness test might be worth mentioning. As the German banking sector is characterized
by conglomerate structures, we run a model excluding all banks that belong to a concern and we find our
conclusion confirmed.
11Our classification differs from other studies such as Denis and Denis (1995) and Jenter and Kanaan
(2015) where the retirement age is 64 years. We opted to use 60 years as the retirement age to have
a sufficient number of cases in the retirement group. Using a higher retirement age, however, does not
change our findings.

GOOD (BAD) refers to appointments when at least one outsider is hired with above-median
(below-median) historical ROA or managerial RRE. Column refers to the observations in
each cell of the table as a percentage of the number of observations in the respective column.
Row shows the total observations in each column as a percentage of the total number of
appointments.
To see whether the potential triggers of the appointment events involve performance
differentials between good and bad outside appointments, we run models with interaction
terms of the trigger. In Table 12 we present the results for RROE with our previously
used dummy variables for good and bad outsiders and the 3 different appointment trig-
gers. Again, to save space we report only joint performance effects. The results confirm
our findings from the full sample in Table 7: the joint performance effect for bad outsiders
is significantly negative for retirement turnovers and appointments with board increase.
Thus, even in the case of a board increase when the outsider dummy variables capture
the infusion of additional expertise into the boardroom, we find negative performance
effects of bad outsiders. Bad outsiders in non-retirement turnovers do not show signif-
icantly negative performance effects; rather for savings banks we even find a positive
post-appointment performance effect of good outsiders. This may indicate that in the
case of non-retirement turnovers, good outsiders are better equipped to turn around bad
bank performance. However, the information we have available to classify appointments
into different types is limited. For instance, the percentage of forced turnovers (where
the former executive director was fired because of poor bank performance) in our cate-
gory of non-retirement turnovers may significantly differ between good and bad outside
appointments. We leave this open for future research.

5 Concluding remarks
The aim of this paper was to test whether executive directors appointed from outside
the bank are a homogeneous group of executive directors concerning post-appointment
performance effects or whether some outsiders are better predisposed than others to turn
around poor bank performance and can do it more quickly than others. We use two
measures of ability, the historical return on assets and managerial risk-return efficiency,
to distinguish between what we call good and bad outside appointments. For a sample
of German banks from 1993 to 2014, we find performance differentials after appointing
good and bad outsiders. Appointing outsiders with low ability creates lower performance
than appointing outsiders with high ability. This is in line with the reasoning that some
executives are better than others at turning around bank performance. We put forth an
alternative explanation that might also create the patterns in the data we attribute to the
managerial ability of executives appointed from the outside. The performance differential
between good and bad outsiders could be driven by a positive selection on the part of
good outsiders. All outsiders may want to maintain their individual reputation in the job
market for bank executive directors. However, while good outsiders may decline offers
from high-risk banks, bad outsiders may only receive offers from high-risk banks. We find
that the pattern in performance differentials is not driven by selection via bank risk.
We further test whether the performance differential between good and bad outside
31
appointments differs in the pre- and post-crisis period. Our results indicate that the
performance differentials become more pronounced in the post-crisis period, especially
because good outsiders do a much better job after than before the crisis. We find that
banks appointing bad outsiders perform in the post-crisis period as poorly as before
the crisis. As many of the banks in our sample did not have subprime exposure, the
interpretation of the post-crisis effects we measure differs from post-crisis effects measured
in studies using US data. In our study, the post-crisis effects combine the effects of the
Euro crisis, monetary policy changes, and changes in regulatory requirements in response
to the crisis.
32
A Appendix
A.1 Managerial RRE
Managerial RRE is our second measure of managerial ability and is based on banks' ef-
ficiency. Many studies have used cost efficiency (Demerjian et al., 2012; Francis et al.,
2016) or profit efficiency (Andreou et al., 2016) to obtain information on managerial abil-
ity. However, an important drawback of using them for banks is that risk is not sufficiently
controlled for (Koetter, 2008). Consequently, those efficiency estimates might be mislead-
ing. To get rid of this drawback in our measure of managerial ability, we follow Koetter
(2008), who estimates risk-return efficiency (RRE) for German universal banks following
Hughes and Moon (1995) and Hughes et al. (1996). They start with a utility-maximization
setting based on an Almost Ideal Demand (AID) system consisting of profit and input
share equations. The idea is that a focus on profit maximization or cost minimization is
insufficient since bank managers may have different risk preferences and pursue alterna-
tive objectives (Koetter, 2008). For a detailed description of this structural model of bank
production see Koetter (2008), Hughes et al. (1996), Hughes and Moon (1995), Hughes,
Lang, Mester, and Moon (2000) and Deaton and Muellbauer (1980). Our estimation pro-
cedure, for which we introduce and summarize all variables in Table 13, starts with such a
structural model of bank input and output equations (which is a 4-equation system as in
Koetter (2008) and Hughes et al. (1996)), which we estimate with a seemingly unrelated
regression equations (SURE) estimation and allow for heteroscedasticity.

This equation delivers the expected return and predicted risk, which are the key vari-
ables in the risk-return efficiency estimation. The expected return, ER, is the predicted
profit divided by equity, z, ER = E(p
/z). The predicted risk, RK, is the standard error
of the predicted profit, RK = S(E(p
/z). Thus, both measures, which are bank specific,
depend on the bank's production plan and other explanatory variables of the bank. If the
risk preferences of bank managers differ, the expected risk-return relationship may also
vary across banks. Following Koetter (2008), the curve of risk-return optimums slopes
upward since risk is positively related to return, albeit with a decreasing rate. Therefore,
the RRE is estimated as an upper envelope of expected return of the following form:
ERi,t

After imposing the necessary homogeneity and symmetry restrictions, we estimate
Equation (4) using stochastic frontier analysis (SFA). The banking structure in Germany,
with its large number of small and medium-sized cooperative and savings banks, requires
controlling for heterogeneity in efficiency analysis (e.g. Koetter and Wedow, 2010). There-
fore, we control for systematic differences across the bank sectors by adding dummies to
the deterministic kernel of the frontier. The results of this estimation are presented in
Table 14.12
Banks' total deviation from the best practice risk-return frontier, i,t
, is due to random
noise, vi,t
, which is assumed to be i.i.d. with vi,t
 N(0, 2
v
) and inefficiency, ui,t
, which is

problems are then severe.

. A point estimator of efficiency is
given by E(ui,t

), i.e., the mean of ui

(Kumbhakar and Lovell, 2000). We use
[exp(-ui,t
)] to calculate RRE per bank and year. RRE of 1 implies a fully efficient bank;
a RRE of around 0.87 implies that the bank has realized only 87% of potential returns at
given production plan and risks.

The third step of our estimation procedure delivers our managerial RRE. We regress
various bank-specific characteristics on the RRE to determine the proportion which can
be attributed to the bank management (managerial efficiency). As in Demerjian et al.
(2012), we use bank characteristics to parse out RRE into bank efficiency and managerial
efficiency: bank size, bank market share, the ratio of Tier 1 capital to risk-weighted assets,
the ratio of non-performing loans to total assets and dummy variables to account for the
bank sectors. The model looks like this:

We report various specifications in Panel A of Table 15, where we cluster standard
errors by bank and year to control for cross-sectional and intertemporal correlation. In
column (1) we show our baseline results, where we do not consider board characteristics.
In columns (2)-(6) we consider various board characteristics such as age, academic degree,
tenure and board diversity to control for possible influences on RRE. We show in Panel
B descriptive statistics of managerial RRE from the various model specifications. We
observe that the 1st and 99th percentile values of the managerial RRE are very close to
each other. To further support this proximity, we report correlations of managerial RRE
from the various specifications in Panel C. The correlation coefficients are larger than 0.99,
indicating that board characteristics do not significantly change the managerial RRE in
our sample. Therefore, we rest our analysis on the baseline specification since this yields
a substantially higher number of observations for classifying outside appointments into
good and bad appointees.

A.2 Estimation of probability of bank distress
In order to discriminate between solvent and poorly capitalized banks, we apply a standard
bank rating model which has been used in several other studies (e.g. Porath, 2006;
Bornemann, Hom¨
olle, Hubensack, Kick, and Pfingsten, 2014 and Kick and Prieto, 2015).13
Here, the Logit model is designed to predict the probability of a bank experiencing a
severe distress event (i.e. capital support from the bankers association, a restructuring
merger, or a moratorium) within the subsequent year with a distress frequency of 4.05%.
Control variables in the model follow the usual CAMELS taxonomy: capital adequacy,
asset quality, management, earnings, liquidity,14 and sensitivity to market risk.

Note: The table displays descriptive statistics for the variables used to estimate PD. mean (sd) denotes the mean
(standard deviation) of each variable. The value px indicates the xth percentile of the distribution of the respective
variable. The number of bank-year observations is 46,138.
13Similar models are also used in banking supervision as early warning tools and to determine the
frequency of on-site inspections (which is, of course, higher for poorly rated banks).
14We wish to note that banks' real liquidity risk cannot be measured adequately with the data available
at the Deutsche Bundesbank (Porath, 2006) and, in particular for small cooperative and savings banks, a
high cash and interbank-loans to total assets ratio is rather an indicator of lacking business opportunities
than low liquidity risk. Therefore, we follow Kick and Jahn (2014) and proxy banks' liquidity situation
at an aggregate level instead by including the yield curve in the bank rating model.

year. Columns (1) and (4) represent the full sample. Columns (2) and (5) show the results for savings
banks and columns (3) and (6) for private banks. Year dummies are included, but not reported. JPE
(joint performance effect) depicts the sum of all coefficients belonging to a particular outsider type. *,
** and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

bank with high (low) risk. Our risk classification is based on NPL measured in the pre-appointment
year. Columns (1) and (4) represent the full sample. Columns (2) and (5) show the results for savings
banks and columns (3) and (6) for private banks. Year dummies are included, but not reported. JPE
(joint performance effect) depicts the sum of all coefficients belonging to a particular outsider type. *,
** and *** indicate significance at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

Note: Coefficients from dynamic panel estimations with Windmeijer (2005) corrected standard errors
below the coefficients. In columns (1)-(3), we split up the group of outsiders according to historical ROA
and in columns (4)-(6) according to managerial RRE. Columns (1) and (4) represent the full sample.
Columns (2) and (5) show the results for savings banks and columns (3) and (6) for private banks.
Year dummies are included, but not reported. JPE (joint performance effect) depicts the sum of all
coefficients belonging to a particular outsider turnover-type interaction term. *, ** and *** indicate
significance of the coefficients at the 10%, 5% and 1% level, respectively.

A.4 Untabulated complementary results
Table 18: Difference-in-differences estimations.
The treatment group is composed of banks with newly appointed outsiders in which no further turnover,
merger and distress event occurred in the three years around this appointment year. The control group
consists of banks without any turnover, merger and distress events in the preceding and following two
years. For each bank in the treatment group we match control banks with replacement from the same
year and banking group, as well as from the same size and ROA deciles in the year before the treatment
bank appoints the outsider. Panel A shows the results on whether both groups differ regarding ROE,
ROA, RROE, RROA and TA in the pre-event year.

POSTi,t
+ i,t
.  Performancei,t
denotes the annual change in RROE in columns (1)-(2) and (5)-(6) and
RROA in columns (3)-(4) and (7)-(8). POSTi,t
equals 1 in the post-treatment period. BAD (GOOD) in
columns (1)-(4) denotes appointments of outsiders with below-average (above-average) historical ROA,
and in columns (5)-(8) with below-average (above-average) managerial RRE. We consider up to three years
before and after appointment. All estimations include bank-fixed effects; therefore no estimate is reported
for BAD and GOOD. Standard errors reported in parentheses are corrected for heteroscedasticity and
are clustered at the level of the bank. ***, **, and * indicate that coefficients are significant at the 1%,
5%, and 10% level, respectively.
