behavior and cardio-metabolic health in children
and adolescents: a cross-sectional study
Valerie Carson1 and Ian Janssen1,2*
Abstract
Background: Cardio-metabolic risk factors are becoming more prevalent in children and adolescents. A lack of
moderate-to-vigorous intensity physical activity (MVPA) is an established determinant of cardio-metabolic risk
factors in children and adolescents. Less is known about the relationship between sedentary behavior and cardio-
metabolic health. Therefore, the objective was to examine the independent associations between volume, patterns,
and types of sedentary behavior with cardio-metabolic risk factors among children and adolescents.
Methods: The results are based on 2527 children and adolescents (6-19 years old) from the 2003/04 and 2005/06
National Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys (NHANES). A cardio-metabolic risk score (CRS) was calculated
based on age- and sex-adjusted waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, non-high-density lipoprotein
cholesterol, and C-reactive protein values. Volume and patterns of sedentary behavior and moderate-to-vigorous
physical activity (MVPA) were measured objectively using accelerometers. Types of sedentary behavior were
measured by questionnaire. A series of logistic regression models were used to examine associations.
Results: Volume and patterns of sedentary behavior were not predictors of high CRS after adjusting for MVPA and
other confounders (P > 0.1). For types of sedentary behavior, high TV use, but not high computer use, was a
predictor of high CRS after adjustment for MVPA and other confounders. Children and adolescents who watched
4 hours per day of TV were 2.53 (95% confidence interval: 1.45-4.42) times more likely to have high CRS than
those who watched <1 hour per day. MVPA predicted high CRS after adjusting for all sedentary behavior measures
and other confounders. After adjustment for waist circumference, MVPA also predicted high non-obesity CRS;
however, the same relationship was not seen with TV use.
Conclusion: No association was observed between overall volume and patterns of sedentary behavior with cardio-
metabolic risk factors in this large sample of children and adolescents. Conversely, high TV use and low MVPA
were independently associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors. However, the association between high TV use
and clustered cardio-metabolic risk factors appears to be mediated or confounded by obesity. Thus, TV and MVPA
appear to be two separate behaviors that need to be targeted with different interventions and policies.
Background
Cardio-metabolic risk factors, such as obesity, hyperten-
sion, dyslipidemia, and glucose intolerance, are known
predictors of coronary heart disease and type 2 diabetes
among adults [1]. These risk factors are becoming more
prevalent in children and adolescents, and approxi-
mately 50% of American youth have at least one cardio-
metabolic risk factor [2]. This is concerning as cardio-
metabolic risk factors track from childhood to adult-
hood [1]. In addition, cardio-metabolic risk factors dur-
ing adolescence predict the development of sub-clinical
cardiovascular disease [3], coronary heart disease [4],
and mortality in adulthood [5]. Therefore, improving
the cardio-metabolic risk factor profile of young people
has long-term implications on population health.
Physical inactivity is an established determinant of car-
dio-metabolic risk factors in children and adolescents
[6]. The majority of physical inactivity research has

focused on how inadequate moderate-to-vigorous inten-
sity physical activity (MVPA) influences health [7].
However, even within highly active persons, MVPA
accounts for only a fraction of total energy expenditure
[8]. An emerging area of study is the relation between
sedentary behavior and health [7]. Sedentary behavior
refers to activities that involve minimal body movement
and low energy expenditure [9]. To date, two studies
have examined the relationship between the overall
volume of sedentary behavior with a summary cardio-
metabolic risk score among children and adolescents
[10,11]. Although both studies found significant associa-
tions, the results need to be interpreted with caution.
Specifically, neither study adjusted for MVPA even
though MVPA is an independent predictor of cardio-
metabolic risk factors [12].
In addition to the overall volume, the type of seden-
tary behavior appears to impact cardio-metabolic health.
For example, a recent review reported that TV use is
more strongly related to obesity than video game and
computer use in young people [13]. A limitation of the
existing screen time (i.e., TV, computer, video game) lit-
erature is that only one study has considered the impact
of the overall volume of sedentary behavior on the
observed relationships [14].
Along with volume and types of sedentary behavior,
consideration should be given to the patterns in which
sedentary behavior is accumulated. Prolonged bouts of
sedentary behavior are associated with cardio-metabolic
health in adults [15,16]. One study among adults
reported that an increased number of breaks in
sedentary behavior are associated with an improved car-
dio-metabolic risk factor profile, independent of total
sedentary behavior time and MVPA [17]. No study has
examined the relationship between patterns of sedentary
behavior and cardio-metabolic risk factors in the
pediatric population. Children and adolescents spend
extended periods of time being sedentary in and outside
of school [9,18,19] and have sporadic MVPA patterns
[20]. It is unknown whether patterns of sedentary beha-
vior independently impact cardio-metabolic risk factors
in young people.
The purpose of this study was to comprehensively
examine the relationships between the volume, patterns,
and types of sedentary behavior with cardio-metabolic
risk factors in children and adolescents. The specific
objectives were to: (1) determine whether the volume of
sedentary behavior predicts cardio-metabolic risk factors
independent of MVPA; (2) determine whether patterns
(bouts and breaks in bouts) of sedentary behavior pre-
dict cardio-metabolic risk factors independent of MVPA
and the volume of sedentary behavior; and (3) determine
whether different types of sedentary behavior are related
to cardio-metabolic risk factors in a similar manner.
Methods
Participants
The study is based on the 2003-2004 and 2005-2006
cycles of the Nutrition Health and Nutrition Examina-
tion Survey (NHANES), a nationally representative
cross-sectional survey of the US. NHANES consisted of
a home interview and a physical exam conducted in a
mobile examination center. Consent was obtained from
all participants and their parents/guardians if <18 years
old. NHANES was approved by the National Center for
Health Statistics. The analyses presented here were
approved by the Health Sciences Research Ethics Board
at Queen's University.
A total of 6553 NHANES participants aged 6-19
attended the mobile examination center. We excluded
3208 participants with incomplete accelerometer
information (as explained below) and an additional 918
participants with incomplete information on the cardio-
metabolic outcome and covariate measures, leaving a
final sample of 2527. There were no significant differ-
ences in age or gender (P > 0.05) between the partici-
pants that were included or excluded from the final
sample. However, slightly more Hispanic (5.4%) and
slightly less non-Hispanic white (3.2%) and non-Hispanic
black (2.4%) participants were included in the final sam-
ple (P < 0.01).
Measurement of Sedentary Behavior and Physical Activity
Volume of sedentary behavior, patterns of sedentary
behavior (bouts and breaks in bouts), and physical activ-
ity variables were created by the authors based on the
raw accelerometry data provided in the NHANES data-
set. The Actigraph AM-7124 accelerometer (Actigraph,
Ft. Walton Beach, FL) was the device used in the
NHANES study. These are uniaxial accelerometers that
record average intensities in one minute intervals or
epochs. Participants were asked to wear the acceler-
ometer on their right hip for 7 consecutive days except
when sleeping or when the accelerometer could get wet.
Data from the accelerometers was downloaded by
NHANES survey collaborators and checked for outliers
and unreasonable or biologically implausible values,
which were removed. Reasonable ranges of values were
determined by criteria published in the literature and
expert judgment [21]. Further data reduction was com-
pleted by the authors. Initially, we removed days with
incomplete information. A day was considered complete
if it contained 10 hours of wear time [22], non-wear
time was defined as a period of >20 minutes of zero
counts [22]. The second data reduction step involved
removing participants with an insufficient number of
days with complete data. Only participants with 4 com-
plete days, including one weekend day, were included.
The inclusion of a weekend day is important as there are

significant weekday and weekend differences in MVPA
and sedentary behavior [23,24]. A 4-5 day accelerometer
monitoring period has a test-retest reliability of 0.8
among children in grades 1-6 and 0.7 among adolescent
in grades 7-12 [23].
Before we derived the sedentary behavior and physical
activity variables from the raw accelerometry data,
epoch cut-points were selected. There is currently sub-
stantial variation on the cut-points used to define seden-
tary behavior and different intensities of physical activity
[25]. We selected a cut-point of <100 counts per minute
to define sedentary behavior [18]. For MVPA, a regres-
sion equation developed by Freedson and colleagues, for
6-18 year olds, was used to estimate metabolic equiva-
lents (METs) for each epoch value, based on the partici-
pant's age and the epoch count [26]. MVPA was defined
as 4.0 METs, based on established precedence in the
pediatric exercise literature [25,27]. Low intensity physi-
cal activity was defined as epoch values between 100
counts and an equivalent of 4.0 METs.
The next step was to derive the sedentary behavior
and physical activity variables for each complete day of
monitoring as illustrated in Figure 1. We calculated the
volume of sedentary behavior, low intensity physical
activity, and MVPA for each participant and divided
these values by total wear time. To be defined as a
sedentary behavior bout, there had to be 30 minutes
with 80% of minutes below the 100 counts cut-point.
The bout stopped when <80% was below the 100 counts
cut-point or when there were 5 consecutive minutes
100 counts (Figure 1). Total minutes spent in seden-
tary behavior bouts were then divided by total wear
time. A minimum 30 minute bout period of sedentary
behavior was chosen to represent a 30 minute TV pro-
gram or class in school. Also, sensitivity analyses indi-
cated that the 30 minute bout period had a better
model fit with cardio-metabolic risk factors than shorter
bout periods (i.e., 5 or 10 minutes). Within each bout of
sedentary behavior, we calculated the number of "break"
minutes as those minutes equal to low intensity activity
or MVPA. A variable reflecting the percentage of seden-
tary behavior bout time spent in breaks was calculated.
Finally, the type of sedentary behavior (TV or compu-
ter) was obtained by questionnaire from the NHANES
dataset. TV and computer were selected because they
were available in the dataset and they make up a large
proportion of sedentary behavior time. For example,
American youth spent 6-8 hours/day sedentary [18] and
4.5 hours/day using a TV or computer [28]. Proxy
respondents answered the questions for participants
aged 6-11 and participants aged 12-19 responded them-
selves. Two questions were asked, "Over the past 30
days, on average about how many hours per day did
(you/your child) sit and watch TV or video?" and "Over
the past 30 days, on average how many hours per day
did (you/your child) use a computer or play computer
games?" There were 7 response options ranging from
"none" to "5 hours or more". We collapsed these
response options into 4 groups (<1 hour, 1 hour, 2-3
hours,  4 hours) based on frequency distributions.
Figure 1 Examples of physical activity and sedentary behavior variables derived from accelerometry data in one participant. The x-axis
represents 7 hours of time, in 1 minute epoch values, of the accelerometry measurements. The height of the data on the y-axis represents the
intensity of the epoch values, with higher data points equaling higher intensities.

Cardio-Metabolic Risk Factors
Waist circumference, systolic blood pressure, non-high-
density lipoprotein cholesterol (non-HDL cholesterol),
and C-reactive protein were the cardio-metabolic risk
factors studied. These risk factors were selected because
they were available in the NHANES dataset and because
they capture different aspects of cardio-metabolic risk.
All measurements were taken by trained personnel at
the mobile examination center visit. Triglycerides and
fasting glucose were not examined as cardio-metabolic
risk factors due to the unavailability of fasting values
in participants under the age of 12 in the NHANES
dataset.
Waist circumference was measured to the nearest 0.1
cm at the level of the iliac crest. Waist circumference is
an effective measure of abdominal adiposity among chil-
dren and adolescents [29] and is a better predictor of
cardio-metabolic risk factors than the body mass index
[30]. Blood pressure was measured manually four conse-
cutive times on the right arm while seated. We calcu-
lated the average blood pressures. We calculated non-
HDL cholesterol by subtracting HDL cholesterol from
total cholesterol [31]. HDL cholesterol was measured
using the direct HDL immunoassay method and total
cholesterol was measured enzymatically in serum in a
series of coupled reactions using cholesteryl ester hydro-
lase, cholesterol oxidase, and peroxidase. Non-HDL cho-
lesterol was chosen as the lipid marker because it is an
important indicator of cardiovascular disease and dia-
betes risk among children and adolescents that it is not
reliant upon a fasting blood sample [32]. C-reactive pro-
tein was measured by latex enhanced nephelometry. C-
reactive protein was chosen as the inflammatory marker
because of its availability in the dataset, known impact
on cardiovascular disease, and because it is not reliant
upon a fasting blood sample [33,34].
Waist circumference and non-HDL cholesterol were
not normally distributed so they were log transformed
by the authors prior to analyses. Age-adjusted values
were created by the authors for each of the cardio-meta-
bolic risk factors because they change with normal
growth and maturation [35]. Using forward stepwise
regression, each of the cardio-metabolic risk factors
were regressed up to a full cubic polynomial in age (age,
age2, age3) separately within males and females. Vari-
ables were allowed to enter or leave the model at P <
0.10. The standardized residuals were retained and used
to represent the age-adjusted values. Participants were
then ranked based on the residual for each risk factor. A
mean of the ranks was used to represent a summary
cardio-metabolic risk score (CRS). Blood pressure was
not measured in children <8 years old, so the CRS for
6-7 year olds was limited to three risk factors. We
categorized CRS into quartiles; the highest quartile
denotes high CRS.
Covariates
Age, gender, ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic
black, Hispanic, other), socioeconomic status (SES),
smoking status, and diet were considered as covariates.
The poverty-to-income ratio, provided within the
NHANES dataset, is a ratio between family income and
poverty threshold and was used to measure SES [36].
Smoking was assessed in NHANES by asking participants
12 and older, "Have you ever tried cigarette smoking,
even 1 or 2 puffs?" We grouped participants into "yes" or
"no" categories. Participants <12 years old were placed
into the "no" category. Diet was assessed in NHANES via
a 24 hour recall. We created four binary variables from
the total nutrient values provided in the database: total
fat (35% or >35% total calories), saturated fat (10% or
>10% total calories), dietary cholesterol (300 or >300
mg/day), and sodium (2300 or >2300 mg/day) [37].
Statistical Analysis
Analyses were completing using SAS version 9.2 (SAS
Institute Inc., Cary, NC) and accounted for the complex
design and sample weights of NHANES. Descriptive sta-
tistics were calculated. Relations between activity and
sedentary behavior variables were determined using
Pearson (continuous variables) and Spearman (categori-
cal variables) correlations. Multiple logistic regression
models were used to address the study objectives. All
regression models predicted the highest CRS quartile
and adjusted for various confounders including age,
gender, ethnicity, SES, smoking, total fat, saturated fat,
dietary cholesterol, sodium, and MVPA. To address
objective 1 (volume of sedentary behavior), an initial
regression model was run that included the sedentary
behavior volume measure and all confounders except
for MVPA. A second model was run that also adjusted
for MVPA. To address objective 2 (patterns of sedentary
behavior), initial regression models were run that
included (a) the bouts of sedentary behavior measure
and all confounders except MVPA, and (b) the breaks
in bouts of sedentary behavior measure, volume of
sedentary behavior, and all confounders except MVPA.
Additional models were run that also adjusted for
MVPA. To address objective 3 (types of sedentary beha-
vior), initial regression models were run that included
(a) TV use and all confounders except MVPA, and (b)
computer use and all confounders except MVPA. Addi-
tional models were run that also adjusted for MVPA.
Along with the analyses performed to address the main
objectives, some supplemental analysis was conducted.
First, age and gender interactions were explored in the

primary analyses as well as sedentary behavior and
MVPA interactions. Second, the relationship between
MVPA and CRS was considered by running an initial
logistic regression model that included the MVPA mea-
sure and all confounders. An additional model was run
that also adjusted for overall volume of sedentary beha-
vior. Third, the role of obesity as a mediator or con-
founder in the relationship between the sedentary
behavior and MVPA variables with CRS was examined.
Consistent with previous literature, a non-obesity CRS
variable was created by removing waist circumference,
and the above analyses were repeated predicting high
non-obesity CRS, while further adjusting for waist cir-
cumference [10,12,38]. Finally, the relationship between
the sedentary behavior and MVPA variables with indivi-
dual CRS components was explored. All logistic regres-
sion models predicted the highest quartiles of the
individual components. The same modeling strategies
described above in this paragraph for the CRS outcome
variable were used to explore these relationships.
Results
Descriptive Analyses
Participant characteristics are in Table 1. Approximately
49% were female and the median age was 13. Overall,
the median values for the breakdown of the accelerome-
try wear time were 50.8% for sedentary behavior, 43.8%
for low intensity activity, and 4.1% for MVPA. The med-
ian values for bouts of sedentary behavior lasting 30
minutes was 24.5%, with 13.5% of that time (or 0.03% of
total wear time) spent in breaks. The average length of
sedentary bouts was 64.5 minutes. Correlations between
sedentary behavior and activity variables are in Table 2.
Objective 1: Volume of Sedentary Behavior
The prevalence of high CRS did not differ according to the
volume of sedentary behavior (Table 3, Ptrend
= 0.15). The
volume of sedentary behavior did not predict (Ptrend
 0.2)
high CRS after adjusting for various confounders (age,
gender, race, SES, smoking, total fat, saturated fat, dietary
cholesterol, sodium; model 1) and MVPA (model 2).
Objective 2: Patterns of Sedentary Behavior
The prevalence of high CRS did not vary across quar-
tiles of the bouts of sedentary behavior and the breaks
in bouts of sedentary behavior measures (Table 3, Ptrend
> 0.2). The two sedentary behavior pattern variables did
not predict (Ptrend
> 0.2) high CRS after adjusting for
various confounders, the volume of sedentary behavior,
(model 1) and MVPA (model 2).
Objective 3: Types of Sedentary Behavior
The prevalence of high CRS increased significantly with
increasing hours of TV use (Table 3, Ptrend
< 0.01). High
TV use remained a significant predictor of high CRS
after adjustment for various confounders (model 1) and
MVPA (model 2). Participants who watched 4 hours/
day of TV were 2.53 (95% confidence interval (CI): 1.45-
4.42) times more likely to have high CRS than those
who watched <1 hour/day. Computer use was not
related to high CRS (Ptrend
> 0.7).
Additional Analyses
There were no significant gender and age interactions
in any of the models that examined the relationship
between the volume, patterns, and types of sedentary
behavior with high CRS. As well, there were no signifi-
cant sedentary behavior and MVPA interactions.
After adjusting for confounders and the volume of
sedentary behavior, participants in the second (odds
ratio = 0.44, 95% CI: 0.27-0.71), third (0.30, 0.16-0.55),
and fourth (0.16, 0.06-0.40) MVPA quartiles were signif-
icantly less likely to have high CRS than participants in
quartile one (Ptrend
< 0.01). Similar associations were
observed when predicting high non-obesity CRS after
further adjusting for waist circumference. However, TV
use was not associated with high non-obesity CRS. For

example, participants who watch 4 hours/day of TV
were not significantly (1.09, 0.63-1.86) more likely to
have high non-obesity CRS than those who watched <1
hour/day after further adjusting for waist circumference.
The observed associations between the sedentary
behavior and MVPA variables with the individual CRS
components (high waist circumference, systolic blood
pressure, non-HDL cholesterol, and C-reactive protein)
were similar to the results of the primary CRS analyses.
For example, overall volume and patterns of sedentary
behavior as well as computer use were not associated
with any of the individual CRS components, after adjust-
ing for various confounders (age, gender, race, SES,
smoking, total fat, saturated fat, dietary cholesterol,
sodium) and MVPA (Table 4). Conversely, MVPA was
associated with all four individual components of CRS
in a dose-response manner, after adjustment for various
confounders and sedentary behavior (Ptrend
 0.05; data
not shown). We also found that the odds of high waist
circumference, non-HDL cholesterol, and C-reactive
protein increased in a dose-response manner with
increasing TV use (Ptrend
 0.05; Table 4).
Finally, the results of all of the aforementioned ana-
lyses were consistent when the analyses were repeated
using linear regression with continuous CRS and contin-
uous individual CRS component outcome variables.
Discussion
This study examined associations between the volume,
patterns, and types of sedentary behavior with cardio-
metabolic risk factors in 6-19 year olds. Although this
representative sample spent 50.8% of their waking hours
in sedentary behavior, the volume of sedentary behavior
was not an independent predictor of high-risk cardio-
metabolic factor values. Similarly, patterns of sedentary
behavior, such as the amount of time in bouts of seden-
tary behavior 30 minutes, was not related to cardio-
metabolic risk factors. However, the type of sedentary
behavior was important. More specifically, the amount
of time spent watching TV was related to cardio-meta-
bolic risk factors, while computer use was not.

Among adults, the volume of sedentary behavior, as
measured objectively by accelerometers, is associated
with a clustering of cardio-metabolic risk factors [39],
waist circumference [39], and glucose intolerance [40]
that are independent of MVPA and other confounders.
The relationship between the volume of sedentary beha-
vior and cardio-metabolic risk factors appears to be
stronger and more consistent in adults than young peo-
ple. In our study, the volume of objectively measured
sedentary behavior was not associated with high CRS or
its individual components. Two previous cross-sectional
studies within children and/or adolescents have exam-
ined the association between the volume of sedentary
behavior, measured by an accelerometer, with a sum-
mary cardio-metabolic risk score [10,11]. Positive
associations were observed in both studies. However,
neither study examined whether these associations were
independent of MVPA, which is an important limitation,
given that MVPA is related to sedentary behavior (see
Table 2). In addition, five previous studies within chil-
dren and adolescents, all cross-sectional in design, have
examined the association between the volume of seden-
tary behavior, measured by an accelerometer, with indi-
vidual risk factors such as insulin resistance [41], blood
pressure [14], and various measures of obesity [42-44].
One of these studies found moderate positive associa-
tions (r = 0.21) between the volume of sedentary beha-
vior and insulin resistance among 9-10 year old children
independent of obesity [41]. Similarly, this study did not
determine whether the associations were independent of

MVPA. In the three studies that examined obesity mea-
sures, associations with volume of sedentary behavior
did not exist or was severely attenuated after adjustment
for MVPA [42-44].
Emerging evidence in adults suggests that patterns in
which sedentary behavior is accumulated may indepen-
dently impact cardio-metabolic risk. More specifically, a
cross-sectional study of 168 Australian adults found that
the frequency of breaks in sedentary behavior was nega-
tively related to waist circumference, triglycerides, and
glucose levels, independent of MVPA and the overall
volume of sedentary behavior [17]. We are unaware of
previous studies that have examined these associations
in children or adolescents. Thus, our observation that
patterns of sedentary behavior, including sedentary
behavior bouts and breaks in bouts of sedentary beha-
vior, were not related to cardio-metabolic risk factors in
6-19 year olds makes a novel contribution to the litera-
ture. It is possible that the differences in results between
the present study and the previously mentioned adult
study [17] is explained by a physiological difference in
the way sedentary behavior impacts health in adults and
young people. It is also possible that the different results
are due to differences in the way "breaks" were mea-
sured in the two studies. While the present study looked
at the frequency of breaks within prolonged (30 min-
utes) bouts, the Australian study counted a break any
time the participant moved from a sedentary minute to
a minute above the 100 count per minute accelerometry
threshold [17]. Due to the dearth of information, more
research is needed to better understand the relationship
between patterns of sedentary behavior and cardio-
metabolic health in all ages.
Our third objective was to determine if different
types of sedentary behavior impact cardio-metabolic
health in a similar manner. Several studies among
young people have found associations between TV and
total screen time with individual cardio-metabolic risk
factors and the metabolic syndrome [12,14,45,46]. To
our knowledge only one of these studies reported on
the impact of different screen time measures on car-
dio-metabolic risk factors other than obesity [14]. This
particular study found that blood pressure was asso-
ciated with TV but not with computer use [14]. Also, a
recent literature review found that TV use is more
strongly associated with obesity in children and adoles-
cents than is computer use [13]. Likewise, we found
that the odds of a high CRS increased in a dose-
response manner within increasing TV volume, inde-
pendent of MVPA, but that computer use did not pre-
dict CRS. Similar associations were seen with the
individual components of CRS. There are two possible
explanations for these findings. First, amongst the
sedentary behaviors, TV may be at the lowest end of
the energy expenditure spectrum. In fact, one study
reported that energy expenditure in children and ado-
lescents was lower while watching TV then while sleep-
ing [47]. Second, TV encourages between meal
snacking [48] and is associated with a greater exposure
to junk food advertisements than other screen time
measures [49]. Even though various dietary measures
(total fat, saturated fat, cholesterol, and sodium) were
adjusted for in this study, residual confounding may
have been present. Future research needs to consider
the impact of other types of sedentary behavior (read-
ing, homework, etc.) on the health of young people.
Interestingly, in the present study the CRS variable
was predicted by a self-report measure of TV use but
not an objective measure of overall sedentary behavior
volume or the overall volume of sedentary behavior
accumulated in prolonged bouts. Also, TV use was
poorly correlated (r  0.08) to these two objective mea-
sures. There are three possible explanations for these
observations. First, the uniaxial accelerometer used in
NHANES may not be sensitive enough to differentiate
between sitting and standing like an inclinometer [50].
Also, participants may have been more likely to keep
their accelerometer on during their daily activities and
MVPA, and take it off later in the evening while watch-
ing TV [51]. Therefore, the objectively measured seden-
tary behavior may not have captured 100% of the
sedentary behavior for some participants. Second, the
specific sedentary behavior of TV may have a unique
impact on cardio-metabolic risk factors due to its
impact on energy expenditure and intake, as previously
discussed. Third, the catchment period of sedentary
behavior differed between the self- report measure (past
30 days) and the accelerometer measure (7 days). Per-
haps, the longer catchment period better reflects typical
behavior compared to the shorter period.
We also examined the association between objectively
measured MVPA with CRS and non-obesity CRS. The
finding that MVPA was strongly and independently
associated with cardio-metabolic risk factors in a dose-
response manner is consistent with previous literature
[52]. For example, a dose-response relationship between
MVPA and cardio-metabolic risk factors was observed
in approximately 2000 participants of the European
Youth Heart Study [6]. As with the present study, the
associations between MVPA and clustered cardio-meta-
bolic risk factors within children and adolescents have
been reported to be independent of TV use and obesity
[12]. However, similar to the present study, the associa-
tion between TV use and clustered cardio-metabolic
risk factors do not appear to be independent of obesity
[12]. This suggests that obesity mediates or confounds
the relationship between TV use and clustered cardio-
metabolic risk factors [12].

Strengths of this study include the objective measures
of MVPA and most of the sedentary behavior variables
as well as our novel approach used to examine patterns
of sedentary behavior. Limitations of the study include
the cross-sectional design, which limits the ability to
make causal inferences about the relationships. Also,
our final sample was not representative of the popula-
tion in terms of ethnicity. In addition, the acceler-
ometers used may not be sensitive enough to
differentiate between sitting and standing [50]. Further-
more, we only considered two types of sedentary beha-
vior, both of which were measured via self-report. The
biases with these self-reported measures may have
results in an underestimation of the strength of associa-
tions between the TV, computer, and CRS variables.
Finally, although a variety of confounders were consid-
ered, we were not able adjust for pubertal development,
a factor which influences physiological processes [53].
Conclusions
No association was observed between overall volume
and patterns of sedentary behavior with cardio-meta-
bolic risk factors in this large sample of children and
adolescents. Conversely, TV use and low MVPA were
both independently associated with cardio-metabolic
risk factors. However, the association between high TV
use and clustered cardio-metabolic risk factors appears
to be mediated or confounded by obesity. In addition,
the TV and MVPA variables were poorly correlated
with one another. This suggests that these are two sepa-
rate behaviors, and that different policy and intervention
programs are needed to increase MVPA and decrease
TV use in an effort to prevent and reduce cardio-meta-
bolic risk factors.
