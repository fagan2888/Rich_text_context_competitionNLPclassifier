Introduction
Scientific collaborations have become the primary manner of
conducting scientific research. Seventy percent of research-
ers in the United States reported that they work together with
an immediate group and other collaborators (National
Science Board [NSB], 2010). In general, scientific collabora-
tions are a family of purposeful working relationships
between two or more people, groups, or organizations to
research phenomena, to develop a scientific instrument or
technology, to build a facility, and to publish a study (Hackett,
2005). These collaborations have been studied extensively
by scholars through quantitative, qualitative, or mixed-meth-
ods research designs (Agar, 2006; Bennett & Gadlin, 2012;
Cloud, 2001; de Solla Price, 1963, 1977; Ding, Foo, &
Chowdhury, 1999; Glanzel, 2002; Glanzel & De Lange,
1997; Garfield, 2009; Hara, Solomon, Kim, & Sonnenwald,
2003; Harper, 2003; Sangam, 2009; Shrum, Genuth, &
Chompalov, 2007; Vasileiadou, 2009; Wagner, 2002;
Wuchty, Jones, & Uzzi, 2007).
The nature of scientific collaborations has changed in the
last decade. The problems that scientists now deal with
require different resources (human, technology, and equip-
ment) and having these resources in one single place is not
always possible. Earlier, such problems were either left alone
or required huge resources to bring researchers together--
neither of which is ideal. However, because of current
advances in information and communication technologies, a
new form of research collaboration has emerged: virtual
research collaborations (VRCs) or distributed research
networks.
This article offers a framework that is based on complex
adaptive systems (CAS) to provide a more comprehensive
understanding of the virtual research team dynamics. The
article begins with the literature on VRCs and what is miss-
ing from it, and builds the argument that VRCs are CAS.
Providing support for this argument is a list of key CAS fea-
tures used in organizational studies, demonstrating how they
correspond to examples from real VRCs. Approaching VRCs
from the CAS perspective would benefit scholars in team
science, organizational studies, information science, com-
munication studies, psychology, and even practitioners of
virtual team science because a holistic understanding of
VRCs is possible through CAS.
Background
Avirtual organization is "a group of individuals whose mem-
bers and resources may be dispersed geographically and
institutionally, yet who function as a coherent unit through
the use of cyberinfrastructure" (Cummings et al., 2008, p. 1).

Toward a New Understanding of Virtual
Research Collaborations: Complex
Adaptive Systems Framework
Arsev Umur Aydinoglu1
Abstract
Virtual research collaborations (VRCs) have become an important method of conducting scientific activity; however, they
are often regarded and treated as traditional scientific collaborations. Their success is measured by scholarly productivity
and adherence to budget by funding agencies, participating scientists, and scholars. VRCs operate in complex environments
interacting with other complex systems. A holistic (or organicist) approach is needed to make sense of this complexity. For
that purpose, this study proposes using a new perspective, namely, the complex adaptive systems theory that can provide
a better understanding of a VRC's potential creativity, adaptability, resilience, and probable success. The key concepts of
complex systems (diversity, interaction, interdependency, feedback, emergence, and adaptation) utilized in organization
studies are used to discuss the behaviors of VRCs, illustrated with real-life examples.

It is important note that entirely virtual or face-to-face teams
rarely exist today (Bell & Kozlowski, 2002; Kirkman &
Mathieu, 2005) as generally both colocated and virtual mem-
bers exist within an organization simultaneously; thus, virtu-
ality should be considered in terms of degree. The two key
characteristics of virtual organizations are having an organi-
zational structure without sharing a physical space, and using
computer-mediated communication to function (Cogburn,
Santuzzi, & Vasquez, 2011). Knowledge creation has become
a collaborative enterprise (Jones, Wuchty, & Uzzi, 2008;
Wuchty et al., 2007). The number of internationally coau-
thored papers has tripled in the last two decades (NSB,
2010), demonstrating the prominent shift toward VRCs.
VRCs are different from traditional scientific collabora-
tions in a couple of areas. By definition, VRCs are not bound
by geographical proximity. As research questions have
become more complex and address large-scale phenomena
such as climate change, space science, or energy sources, it
has become too difficult to maintain the necessary expertise
to tackle these problems in one physical location. The diver-
sity of researchers' affiliations and geographical locations in
a research network is an indicator of distribution. In addition,
addressing these complex questions requires responses from
experts in different fields or disciplines. The researchers,
working from various locations, have adopted digital col-
laboration tools for communication and data/information
sharing to succeed in their efforts. Communication software
such as Skype, Adobe Connect, and Google Cam; document
and data sharing tools such as Dropbox, Google Docs, and
Skydrive; and collaborative research tools and cyberinfra-
structure such as WorldWide Telescope and DataONE are
some of the digital collaboration tools that have become
increasingly prominent in researchers' lives. The VRCs' dis-
tributed and diverse networks tend to be less structured and
hierarchical as they operate with a more flexible organiza-
tional structure. This does not imply that they are leaderless;
generally, there is a core group of individuals who drives the
VRC's collaboration, in addition to the principal
investigator(s), who is/are responsible to the funding agency.
Table 1 summarizes the differences between traditional and
virtual collaborations.
Virtual scientific collaboration has become a necessity
and almost a norm to conduct scientific activity. However,
virtual organizations have their intrinsic challenges:
(1) logistical problems, such as communicating and coordinating
work across time and space, (2) interpersonal concerns, such as
establishing effective working relationships with team members
in the absence of frequent face-to-face communication, and
(3) technology issues, such as identifying, learning, and using
technologies most appropriate for certain tasks. (Furst et al.,
2004, p. 7)
Research on virtual organizations is relatively new, but
addresses a wide range of issues. According to a study
conducted by Powell, Piccoli, and Ives (2004) using a life
cycle model, studies on virtual organizations focus on four
general categories: (a) input (design, culture, training),
(b) socioemotional processes (trust, cohesion, relationship
building), (c) task processes (communication, coordination,
task-technology fit), and (d) output (performance, satisfac-
tion). The network characteristics (e.g., centrality, hubs, and
incoming/outgoing links) of virtual organizations have
become a fertile research area lately, because of the advances
in social network analysis. For instance, Cronin and Meho
(2006) and Haythornthwaite (2009) have studied the rela-
tionship between network traits and its performance, and
Panzarasa, Opsahl, and Carley (2009) focused on informa-
tion flow and team dynamics.
The growing number of multidisciplinary research proj-
ects has increased the number of studies on the diversity of
virtual teams as well. For instance, when there is too much
diversity1 researchers establish cliques, stop communicating,
and even disrupt each other's efforts (Adamic & Glance,
2005; Stvilia, Twidale, Smith, & Gasser, 2008). Furthermore,
scholars have investigated the performance (generally based
on scholarly/nonscholarly production and adherence to bud-
get and deadlines) of virtual teams (Ancona & Caldwell,
1992; Aubert & Kelsey, 2003; Janicik & Bartel, 2003; Jones
et al., 2008; Kacen, 1999). Scholarly production is the gold
standard, and there is a vast literature on coauthorship prac-
tices; however, its limitations have also been documented in
information science. It is hard to differentiate the contribu-
tion of a scientific collaboration's members, such as when
hyperauthorship (publications with more than 100 coauthors)
or honorary authorship (a person is listed as a coauthor for
the sake of reputation not contribution) exist, or even in some
cases when the efforts of certain members might not be
reflected in the article's authorship (Katz & Martin, 1997;
LaFollette, 1996; Subramanyam, 1983). Through a CAS per-
spective, we can explore not only coauthorship practices but
also different dynamics of virtual collaborations.
All of the studies mentioned above are valuable additions
to the scientific body of knowledge; however, there are two

shortcomings in the literature on virtual research organiza-
tions. First, the existing studies that address scientific
research contexts focus on small teams or groups. To date,
studies that considered larger organizations were set only in
commercial organizations or business virtual teams, not sci-
ence organizations (Kirkman, Gibson, & Kim, 2012; Martins,
Gilson, & Maynard, 2004). Although there are some simi-
larities between profit-based (commercial) and non-profit-
based (research) virtual organizations; they are actually
different kinds of organizations because of their raison
d'être, which are respectively profit and answering a research
question. In addition, an understanding of their dynamic
composition and evolution is needed (Tannenbaum, Mathieu,
Salas, & Cohen, 2012), as VRCs operate for many years and
team composition changes, as members graduate, move on
to new projects, retire, or otherwise transition from the team.
Second, there is a gap in the existing literature on virtual
research organizations that also applies to every kind of sci-
entific collaboration, virtual or otherwise, which is that the
studies tend to treat research teams as traditional organiza-
tions. However, in today's interconnected world, most of
them are actually CAS, which resist reductionist explana-
tions, exhibit unpredictable behavior, create a disproportion-
ate impact, and are highly interactive within themselves and
with their environment. Briefly, complex systems are based
on nonlinear relationships among the system's components,
and they are nonreductionist (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). A non-
linear system's behavior cannot be explained through a lin-
ear equation. The literature on virtual teams uses linear
theories to explain their behaviors. As it was pointed out in
Falk-Krzesinski et al. (2011), "What is key to recognize is
that linear or sequential process models could not adequately
capture the complexity inherent in SciTS [Science of Team
Science] and may even be misleading," and referring to
Mabry, Olster, Morgan, and Abrams (2008), they suggest a
complex systems approach.
There are a limited number of studies that approach VRCs
from a CAS theory perspective. Aragon and Williams (2011)
focus on collaborative creativity. Murase, Doty, Wax,
DeChurch, and Contractor (2012) highlight a network
approach to capture multilevel interactions. Wagner (2008)
proposes research networks between developed and develop-
ing nations for development, Naik and Kim (2010) develop a
framework to explain the VRCs' success through adaptation.
Cureu (2006) treats team cohesion, trust, and conflict as
emergent states in virtual teams and brings them together
through the CAS perspective.
Complexity Theory
There is not a single unified theory of complex systems
(Anderson, 1999; Mitchell, 2009; Mitleton-Kelly, 2003).
Instead, there are different foci and approaches, such as that
of the Santa Fe Institute or Prigogine or interpretations in
social sciences (Cudworth & Hobden, 2012; Merali &
McKelvey, 2006; Walby, 2006). Complexity theory has close
ties with chaos theory and other concepts from biology,
physics, and chemistry, such as catastrophe, autopoiesis,
chaos, dissipative structures, autocatalytic process, attrac-
tors, multiagent systems, thresholds, and transformational
processes, fractal geometry, fuzzy logic, and systems theory
(Mitleton-Kelly, 2003; Salem, 2009; Smith & Jenks, 2006).
Scholars define CAS according to their disciplinary interests
and focus on related concepts, respectively. Therefore, one
has to be careful about substituting these concepts, because
even though there might be a huge overlap among them, they
are not the same. For instance, autopoiesis, introduced by
Maturana and Varela (1973), means self (auto) creation (poi-
esis), which is different from self-organization, which is a
critical concept in complexity theory (explained later).
Maturana (1987, p. 71) himself states that he would "never
use the notion of self-organization, because it cannot be the
case . . . it is impossible. That is, if the organization of a thing
changes, the thing changes." Another example is chaotic sys-
tems, which are nonlinear like complex systems, yet very
different in that chaotic systems are not emergent and their
constituents are not interdependent. In short, one has to be
careful using these concepts for complexity theory.
A very prominent feature of complex systems is the non-
linear interactions among its variables. However, since
Descartes, linear modeling has dominated the scientific
world because of its freshness, competence, and convenience
for calculations. Linear systems are simple and determinis-
tic, and therefore, variables in linear systems can be manipu-
lated (at least theoretically) and are definitely predictable.
The main hypothesis behind this view is that a phenomenon
is the aggregation of its components--which are variables--
so it should be broken down into its smallest units and they
should be studied to understand it.
However, many phenomena in life are neither linear, nor-
reducible into simplistic units, nor both. A nonlinear system
is more than the sum of its parts due to feedback loops
(Waldrop, 1992). In nonlinear systems, small inputs can have
large system effects (or vice versa), and there is a sensitivity
to initial conditions that makes prediction almost impossible
(Anderson, 1999; Thietart & Forgues, 1995).
The problem is that working with nonlinear systems is
beyond human computational ability. When nonlinear rela-
tions are realized, the related data are not preserved and/or
the nonlinear relations cannot be measured or calculated due
to their complexity. This happens because "modeling the
nonlinear outcomes of many interacting components has
been so difficult that both social and natural scientists have
tended to select more analytically tractable problems"
(Anderson, 1999, p. 217), which produces deficient and
incomplete reflections of reality. Thus, scholars end up with
a discipline that is not consistent with natural phenomena,
and is not helpful for controlling or predicting phenomena,
as a result of its dependency on linear modeling. Sometimes
nonlinear relationships were simply disregarded by

unrealistic but more tractable or feasible assumptions. For
instance, in economics it is assumed that "there is equilib-
rium in markets," despite all the opposing evidence (Waldrop,
1992, p. 255). Also, in archaeology, social and economic sys-
tems are assumed to be in equilibrium (Bentley & Maschner,
2007). Both these assumptions contradict reality. Because of
its messiness, the study of nonlinear systems had not attracted
much interest until the 1960s, when, with the development of
computers, computational power increased enormously, and
thus, solving nonlinear equations became easy (Gleick,
1987). Consequently, physicists, meteorologists, economists,
and chemists adapted nonlinear models for their disciplines.
The main difference between linear and nonlinear sys-
tems is the focus of attention given by researchers to vari-
ables and interaction, respectively. Instead of focusing on
units, in complexity theory, researchers focus on interac-
tions. Interaction is an intricate relationship among units or
variables and is generally short ranged (Cilliers, 1998). For
example, information is generally received from immediate
neighbors. As the information travels from unit to unit, it can
be enhanced, suppressed, or altered in many ways, such as in
the telephone game. Positive and negative feedback loops
exist in interactions; hence, some actions are encouraged and
some discouraged. Everything that is related to the system
could be found in interactions, and the level of analysis
becomes interactions in complexity theory. As Nobel laure-
ate chemist Prigogine (1997) argued, this new paradigm is
interested in instability, disorder, diversity, and nonlinear
relationships, rather than the traditional mechanistic
Newtonian view, which dealt with stability, order, equilib-
rium, and linear relationships.
There is not a unified CAS theory, but in definitions there
are some indispensible concepts, such as agents, interaction,
coevolution, and emergence. Here two definitions are
offered:
The theory of complex adaptive systems (CAS) originated in the
natural sciences and articulates how interacting agents in
systems adapt and coevolve over time, and who, through their
interactions, produce novel and emergent order in creative and
spontaneous ways. (Webb, Lettice, & Lemon, 2006, p. 34)
A complex adaptive system consists of a large number of agents,
each of which behaves according to some set of rules. These
rules require the agents to adjust their behavior to that of other
agents. In other words, agents interact with, and adapt to, each
other. (Stacey, 2003, p. 237)
According to Kauffman (1993), when the relationships
are simple, the system's behavior is easy to understand,
explain, and predict, which is what is done in linear model-
ing. In the other extreme, when immeasurable nonlinearity
dominates the system, it looks random and chaotic.
Complexity, sometimes referred to as "order in disorder," is
between them, not easy to understand, but not impossible
either.
Complexity theory focuses on "organizing rather than
organization" (Weick, 1979) and prescribes, ". . . science of
process rather than state, of becoming rather than being"
(Gleick, 1987). It is continuous recreation of interactions and
relations between units, which also results in dynamic equi-
librium. It is this continuous recreation, redefinition, and
emergence that makes it harder to understand, predict, and
equalize.
According to Holland (1998), in complex systems, over-
all patterns are greater than the sum of its parts, and also,
such systems may act coherently without domination by a
central source, which means the system cannot be localized
to its subsets. This approach suggests the bounded rationality
principle. The units cannot know the big picture due to lack
of information and their limited information processing abil-
ity. They can only know about their immediate neighbors.
Thus, they position themselves according to them. This con-
cept is very common in explaining survival and extinction in
habitats in evolutionary biology. No creature knows what is
going on in this planet, but they all position themselves in
relation to their cohabitants, by developing camouflage skills
to hide or growing muscles to run faster, for example. The
whole habitat is in a state of dynamic equilibrium tied to each
agent. This is called coevolution (Pascale, Millemann, &
Gioja, 2000; Waldrop, 1992). Table 2 provides a list of recur-
ring concepts in the analysis of organizations from a CAS
Aydinoglu 5
perspective using seminal articles from the organization sci-
ence literature.
A human system, such as a VRC, is a CAS; therefore, it
needs to be studied as one. However, the growing body of
literature on the topic does not treat them as such. Through
CAS, a VRC could be studied from a micro to a macro level,
and even to the environment that it operates within. Here are
the features of CAS that are used to develop a framework,
which will help researchers to understand VRCs better and
help them to use their potential.
CASs Framework for VRCs
Large Number of Diverse Agents
For a system to be considered a complex system there must
be multiple agents interacting with each other. These agents
are different vectors or have different agendas and they try to
pull or influence the system accordingly. The more the
agents/vectors, the greater the likelihood of encountering
chaos or complexity (Thietart & Forgues, 1995). It looks like
a messy, chaotic bunch that does not have a purpose or make
sense.
By definition this characteristic exists in a VRC, for which
a number of researchers and/or organizations establish a
working relationship to conduct research, to develop an
instrument or technology, to build a facility, and to publish a
study. Furthermore, although every agent works toward the
same goal, the raison d'être of the collaboration, every agent
also has his own objectives. These individual objectives are
not necessarily aligned with each other, but instead, are
affecting and being affected by each other. "In each system,
each agent is different from the others (diversity), and its per-
formance depends on the other agents and the system itself,
each of which can influence the other's behavior" (Benbya &
McKelvey, 2006, p. 18). This diversity at certain conditions
results in an emergent property. A system's behavior cannot
be reduced to a single agent's behavior, because diversity
and variety give each agent a different role (or vector;
Holland, 1995). There is no single dominant vector in the
system. Each one is a counteracting force in the system try-
ing to actualize its own goals. This is the reason why it looks
like incomprehensible behavior.
VRCs exhibit this feature. For instance, in a VRC, in
terms of academic career advancement, there will be a diver-
sified group of researchers, ranging from senior researchers
to junior researchers to graduate students (or even under-
graduates), with each having a different goal, such as advanc-
ing the quality of human lives, getting tenure, collecting data
for a dissertation, enhancing a reputation, engaging in com-
petition, and so on. This diversity does not have to be limited
to academia. There might be researchers from research cen-
ters, laboratory staff from labs, and engineers with different
affiliations--each, again, with different personal agendas. In
addition, there could be contractors, such as software
developers from industry, whose goal is to make profits. In
cross-disciplinary projects, disciplinary diversity should be
taken into consideration as well--each with different work-
flows, value and belief systems, and backgrounds. This is
only an individual level diversity. Sectoral and organiza-
tional diversity could be added to this example, when public-
private partnerships exist, and/or inclusion of nonprofit
organizations. This simple example demonstrates how dif-
ferent motivations and goals would create counteracting
forces in a system.
Interaction/Connectivity/Interdependence
Interaction could be limited in physical systems. They are
simple, predictable, and linear, with little room for surprises
or changes. Human systems, however, are based on interac-
tions. "Complex behaviour arises from the inter-relationship,
interaction, and interconnectivity of elements within a sys-
tem and between a system and its environment" (Mitleton-
Kelly, 2003). As Axelrod and Cohen's (1999) complex
system definition asserts, "(a system is complex when) . . .
there are strong interactions among its elements, so that cur-
rent events heavily influence the probabilities of many kinds
of later events." The action of one agent has an impact on
other agents and even on other systems.
Merali (2006) describes an interconnected world as "a
complex multi-dimensional network which connects a diver-
sity of agents (individuals, groups, institutions, nations, com-
puters, software components, etc.) through multiple and
diverse communication channels" (p. 217). A VRC fits the
bill. In a VRC, researchers (agents) have to interact with each
other because that is the reason they come together in the
first place. They need each other's expertise, resources, repu-
tation, or other attributes; hence, they interact. Their research
is also interdependent, especially in inter- and transdisci-
plinary projects. For instance, in a VRC that studies climate
change, environmental scientists, atmospheric scientists,
marine scientists, ecologists, biologists, and even social sci-
entists have to interact with each other, design their research
so that they get input from each other, report their findings to
each other, and then continue doing this cycle over and over,
for they operate in a system where everything is connected to
each other. They interact through print (journals, reports,
etc.), online (emails, data repositories, videocons, etc.), and
face-to-face media (conferences, workshops, etc.) as much
as they can.
The more interdependent their tasks, the more researchers
have to interact, if they want to succeed. For instance, the
members of the Goddard Center for Astrobiology, a VRC
funded by the NASA Astrobiology Institute [NAI], investi-
gate "how organic compounds are created, destroyed, and
altered during the formation and evolution of a planetary sys-
tem, leading up to the origin of life on a planet such as Earth"
(NAI, 2012). Thirty-one researchers from seven different
institutions in the United States examine the distribution of
6 SAGE Open
organic matter and water in the solar system and how they
were delivered to Earth. The astronomers and physicists in
the team establish taxonomy of icy bodies and their potential
for organics and water, chemists analyze the formation, dis-
tribution, and abundance of organics with the input from
astronomers, geochemists, earth scientists, and microbiolo-
gists investigate processes affecting the origin and evolution
of organics in planetary systems along with astronomers. The
success of the collaboration depends on the interaction
among researchers from different disciplines. In fact, the col-
laboration is designed to make researchers from disciplines
work together, because their tasks are interdependent. They
frequently use face-to-face (when possible) and remote col-
laboration technologies to interact with each other. Because
the members of the Goddard team are affiliated with seven
different organizations, their interaction relies on the use of
information and communication technologies.
Feedback, Unpredictability, and Nonlinearity
A group of diverse researchers who interact with each other
to achieve individual and organizational goals is clearly a
system.Any communication or action will have an impact on
its members; however, this impact does not have to be pro-
portional. Indeed, it is highly likely that the impact will be
different on each agent, due to diversity. Because of the non-
linear relationships, the impact might have an amplifying
effect (positive feedback) on some members, and might have
a dampening effect on others (negative feedback). Feedback
loops are typical of nonlinear (and complex) systems and are
one of the main sources of unpredictability in CAS. In addi-
tion, these feedback mechanisms or processes are the pri-
mary reason why scholars cannot isolate a variable and study
it in isolation. This feature results in the principle that the
whole is greater than the sum of its parts.AsAnderson (1999)
puts it, ". . . complex systems resist simple reductionist anal-
yses, because interconnections and feedback loops preclude
holding some subsystems constant in order to study others in
isolation" (p. 218). Because of transfer of energy or informa-
tion among agents, impacts lose their proportion. The
strength of the feedback process is often determined by the
degree of the connectivity (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003). The
impact does not have to be equal on others. Some might be
affected more--which makes sense because agents do not
know the big picture; they are affected by their immediate
neighbors. Like in the Chinese telephone game, the impact is
disturbed by each agent; thus, a uniform impact on each
agent almost never happens.
Kirkman et al. (2012) argued that virtual team develop-
ment is described as nonlinear, referring to the relationships
between the organizational environment, group structure,
technology, and diversity. In VRCs, through interaction and
interdependency, there are constant feedback loops at play,
where impacts might be amplified or dampened, but are defi-
nitely untraceable. As discussed earlier, team members
provide input to each other's research; however, where a
senior scholar sees an opportunity to collaborate, a junior
scholar might sense a threat to his or her career. In addition,
some members might have more pull than others and their
impact might be disproportionate to their seniority or exper-
tise. The response of a researcher in a commercial organiza-
tion to a cyberinfrastructure designed to share data, could be
different from that of a researcher in a government agency. In
short, reactions will vary. Furthermore, because of bounded
rationality, agents have limited information on the overall
state of the network or system. The individual actions, which
are affected by agents' "diverse social and cultural environ-
ments and backgrounds, their personal experiences, and
events, and information about events from their immediate
environment and their extended networks" (Merali, 2006,
p.218), will give rise to an emergent behavior of the network.
The results of these nonlinear relationships are simply
unpredictable.
The feedback loops and nonlinear relationships create a
condition called sensitivity to initial conditions--which
results in unpredictability. The butterfly effect--a butterfly
in the Amazon flaps its wings and causes a tornado in
Texas--is the famous example of sensitivity to initial condi-
tions. Anderson observes, ". . . the behavior of complex pro-
cesses can be quite sensitive to small differences in initial
conditions, so that two entities with very similar initial states
can follow radically divergent paths over time" (Anderson,
1999, p. 218). For instance, an animosity between two
researchers could doom the collaboration from the start; it is
not easy to fix such problems through computer-mediated
communication. Another example could be the anxiety and
discomfort that some members feel toward computer-medi-
ated communication. The leadership team should take these
into consideration when establishing the VRC.
The Edge of Chaos/Far From Equilibrium
Systems do not stay in equilibrium forever. They react to
internal and external (environmental) factors, and equilib-
rium changes. They can exist or fluctuate between three
states: stable, chaotic, and in-between (Anderson, 1999;
Benbya & McKelvey, 2006; Lewin, 1999; Thietart &
Forgues, 1995). The "in-between" phase is actually when the
system behaves in a "complex" way. Scholars named this
phase differently: for Kauffman, it was the melting zone, for
Cramer, critical complexity, for McKelvey, the region of
emergent complexity (Benbya & McKelvey, 2006, p. 17),
and for Pascale et al. (2000)--the edge of chaos. This is
where action takes place and emergence happens. In this
zone, according to Mitleton-Kelly (2003), "open systems
exchange energy, matter, or information with their environ-
ment, and when pushed `far-from-equilibrium,' create new
structures and order" (p. 10). Here, higher levels of mutation
and experimentation happen, which could become critical in
a system's resistance or response to external threats (Pascale
Aydinoglu 7
et al., 2000). Being away from equilibrium gives the system
a chance to come up with a better configuration that increases
the likelihood of its survival.
AVRC that is ordered, rigid, and top-down does not oper-
ate in this zone. It cannot respond to the changes in the envi-
ronment and be adaptive. A VRC that is on the other
end--chaos--is actually not a system or a collaboration any-
more. It cannot reach the criticality that is needed for emer-
gence. The leader (or the management) of the VRC is
responsible for creating such an environment where the
members can thrive. Creativity, novelty, and innovation can-
not happen without a little serendipity.
Furthermore, funding for a collaboration is not a short-
term investment. During the life of a collaboration, member-
ship composition changes. After the funding comes through,
the very first thing a VRC does is to employ new postdoc-
toral researchers and graduate students. Graduate students
graduate or might be assigned to different projects; postdoc-
toral researchers might find other jobs and move on to other
research areas; depending on the progress of the project, new
expertise might be needed, and thus, new staff (in different
levels) might be employed; new collaborators might join the
project; researchers could retire, pass away, change jobs and
research interests and thus leave membership. In a nutshell,
team composition, team dynamics, and team capabilities do
change over the years. Nothing is in a static equilibrium and
a dynamic analysis--such as temporal team composition
data or temporal network analysis--is needed.
Emergence, Self-Organization, and Strange
Attractors
When the system receives energy, matter, or information, it
absorbs them until it reaches the critical point--which is the
edge of chaos. At this point, through the interactions among
agents, excess energy, matter, or information generates a
form, pattern, behavior, or structure. This is called emer-
gence or self-organization. Emergence is the process whereby
the global behavior of a system results from the actions and
interactions of agents (Sawyer, 2005). The emergent struc-
ture is neither planned nor predicted. As Anderson (1999)
puts it, ". . . complex systems tend to exhibit `self-organiz-
ing' behavior; starting in a random state, they usually evolve
toward order instead of disorder" (p. 218). This does not con-
tradict the second law of thermodynamics, because of the
excess energy (or information) the system received. Benbya
and McKelvey (2006, p. 16) summarize this occurrence,
referring to Kauffman, Cramer, and McKelvey: "In other
words, new behavior patterns appear as consequences of
agent interaction. No single program or agent completely
determines the system's behavior, despite the fact that each
of the heterogeneous agents holds some common schemata.
These systems self-organize when they find themselves in
the `region of emergent complexity' at the `edge of chaos'
(Cramer, 1993; Kauffman, 1995; McKelvey, 1999)". Each
agent contributes to the emergent property differently; thus,
it is unpredictable.
These novel forms, patterns, and structures emerge around
the excess energy, matter, or information, which are strange
attractors (Anderson, 1999) for importing is more likely to
occur into an open system, and the more open it is, the more
likely the attraction will occur. At this point, around attrac-
tion, complexity (or chaos) gets ordered and becomes an
identifiable configuration (Thietart & Forgues, 1995). A new
order (equilibrium) is reached. In human systems, it gener-
ally creates irreversible structures or relationships (Mitleton-
Kelly, 2003), such as national education systems or the
concept of minimum wage. Some scholars perceive the
emergence as the most important feature of complexity the-
ory (Sawyer, 2005) because every feature so far serves its
occurrence. A great number of diverse agents interact and
feed each other in a special environment where the system
reaches a critical point, so that a relationship, form, or pattern
"emerges."
In VRCs, an emergent property could be a new working
group that arises as a response to a new question or phenom-
enon that must be dealt with before forward progress can
occur. Another example is a publication or a patent or a prod-
uct (such as a software, cyberinfrastructure, or protein). The
members might decide that their investigation has reached a
critical point where it needs to be shared with the rest of the
scientific community. A collegial relationship could emerge
that passes beyond the lifetime of the project and turns into a
network or an invisible college. A group of concerned scien-
tists could coauthor white papers or peer-reviewed publica-
tions that could result in an emergence of a science mission
or a research field, such as climate research. The severity and
magnitude of the problem (climate change led to infinite
numbers of VRCs working on it) or an opportunity (a volca-
nic eruption gave birth to an island in 2011 and led to a VRC
funded by NAI to study it) or available resources (NSF Data
Solicitation led to forming of DataONE, a VRC that emerged
to develop a cyberinfrastructure for Earth Science data)
could act as an attractor and cause VRCs to form around
them. These emergences are generally self-organized and
form from the bottom-up. It is hard to predict these events. A
rigid management style might deter such emergences, and
possibly harm productivity and performance of the collabo-
ration. Letting the VRC loose is not an option either, as the
leaders--principal investigator(s)--are responsible to the
funding agency, and there are certain deadlines that have to
be met. For financial systems, which are basically human
systems, Arthur (1999) suggests
governments should avoid both extremes of coercing a desired
outcome and keeping strict hands off, and instead seek to push
the system gently toward favored structures that can grow and
emerge naturally. Not a heavy hand, not an invisible hand, but a
nudging hand. (p. 108)
8 SAGE Open
This suggestion is very applicable to the governance and
management of VRCs.
Adaptation to Environment (Context)
The emergent property is the adaptation or the new tempo-
rary equilibrium, depending on where one looks. The system
cannot continue as it was, and through generating new pat-
terns, forms, behaviors, relationships, and structures, it
adapts to the new conditions and environment. Having just
one strategy or one kind of agent is not desirable, because
when the conditions change, that strategy or agent may no
longer be optimal or suitable (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003; Pascale
et al., 2000). It could result in annihilation. Thus, systems do
not spend all of their resources on one objective, but instead,
they try to have diversity and variation, which builds on
resilience. For instance, the immune system has multiple
mechanisms, not one, to respond to pathogens. Or, compa-
nies invest in research and development, and training, to be
able to respond to changing market conditions. McKelvey
(2001) defines this process as "adaptive tension." If systems
do not explore this "space of possibilities," they become
fragile.
The natural laws for molecular systems or DNAin organic
systems, or consciousness, or rules or relationships in human
systems, are actually all schemas for the actions of agents;
their actions are bound to these schemas. "The existence of
these shared schemas, together with the agents' individual
schemas (diversity), opens up the possibility of changes to
these rules, or in other words, evolution and learning"
(Benbya & McKelvey, 2006, p. 19). These schemas can
change, and that change is adaptation; that change is learn-
ing--and it is crucial to survival.
In the VRC context, a new approach or structure might be
needed to tackle a research question. For instance, in 2008
Mars Rover Phoenix identified perchlorate in the Martian
regolith. A new approach was definitely needed to investi-
gate them. Therefore, NAI funded a VRC that studied per-
chlorate at Mars analog sites (NAI, 2012). Another example
is from DataONE. They established a new working group--
exploration, visualization, and analysis--that was not in the
original plan, when they realized that they could promote
their project and increase its acceptance and diffusion among
the scientific community through visualization, and also do
more science with it (Aydinoglu, 2011). VRCs become more
flexible and change their structure to respond to the changes
inside (the collaboration itself) and outside (the environ-
ment). Their resilience improves and thus they adapt.
Coevolution/Multidimensional
The adaptation, and thus the evolution, are not alone but are
together--including the environment, which is a collection
of systems with other agents. Every agent in the system is
interconnected to each other, and feedback mechanisms
carry information from one to another; hence, a change in
one creates a response (and change) in another, then that one
in another, and so on. It continues like that until every agent
repositions (changes or mutates) him/herself. In Stacey's
(2003) definition of a CAS, this feature becomes clearer:
A complex adaptive system consists of a large number of agents,
each of which behaves according to some set of rules. These
rules require the agents to adjust their behavior to that of other
agents. In other words, agents interact with, and adapt to, each
other. (p. 2)
This is in fact a continuous cycle: "As the elements react,
the aggregate changes; as the aggregate changes, elements
react anew" (Arthur, 1999, p107). If an agent or a group of
agents cannot adapt, they do not survive; they become extinct
or die or leave the system. The same concept is named "struc-
tured coupling" in living systems by Maturana (2002). He
describes the dynamic interplay between the entity and its
environment as such:
In this process the structure of the living system and the structure
of the medium change together congruently as a matter of
course, and the general result is that the history of interactions
between two or more structure determined systems becomes a
history of spontaneous recursive coherent structural changes in
which all the participant systems change together congruently
until they separate or disintegrate. I have called this structural
dynamics, including the structural coherences between the
interacting systems that results from it, structural coupling. (pp.
16-17).
Both Falk-Krzesinski et al. (2011) and Börner et al. (2010)
agree that the "interrelationships between parts and their
relationships to a functioning whole, [is] often understood
within the context of an even greater whole," which is the
mantra of CAS. For instance, the scientific arena is very
competitive about securing resources, because these
resources are directly correlated to the survival of an indi-
vidual scientist or a collaboration. In addition, because of the
interactive network structure, it is very dynamic. VRCs are
open systems. Emergent properties (information, best prac-
tices, opportunities, methodologies, structures, etc.) are
shared, disseminated, and adapted at an increasing rate. In
fact, the whole process of academic publishing is about dis-
seminating and sharing. None of the elements can be cut out.
Because subsystems are open systems and there is inter-
action among them that leads to coevolution, the unit of anal-
ysis becomes a moving target. An agent could affect a
system; a system could affect other systems. In CAS theory,
these continuous impacts are explained through fractals--
self-similar patterns at different scales. Thietart and Forgues
(1995) argue that organizations generally have a fractal form.
Furthermore, similar patterns, structures, and behaviors are
found at the organizational, unit, group, and individual lev-
els. The effects are both contagious and similar. For instance,
Aydinoglu 9
an individual's decision to sell stocks in the market might be
represented at the market level--which means everybody is
selling that same stock. (The emergent property is the decline
in that stock's price). Moreover, it is contagious among dif-
ferent types of systems. "Complex systems are multidimen-
sional, and all the dimensions interact and influence each
other. In a human context the social, cultural, technical, eco-
nomic and global dimensions may impinge upon and influ-
ence each other" (Mitleton-Kelly, 2003, p. 5). Given that the
system is functioning under the right conditions, a change in
a researcher's behavior could change a team's behavior,
which could change a VRC's behavior, which could change
other VRCs' behaviors, which could change a funding agen-
cy's behavior, which could change other funding agencies'
behaviors, which could change the scientific arena, which
could change the economics of a nation, and so on. An exam-
ple of this effect is the Internet, which originated as basically
a military technology, but has changed so much in our scien-
tific, economic, educational, and social lives.
This is a holistic or organismic view--where all of the
elements are connected to each other, and by changing them-
selves they are changing everything around them. This con-
cept is closely related to previous concept: adaptation to
environment--or learning (conscious or unconscious). An
ever-changing environment requires new responses (which
has to be discovered, developed, or learned from others) to
survive. Kolb and Kolb (2009) uses structural coupling,
which is "the way a system interacts with its environment,
recurrently renewing and recreating itself. . . . These struc-
tural changes produce changes in the future behavior of the
system and its environment" to describe the process of an
organism's learning and development (p. 311). Organizations
do learn in a similar fashion; therefore, by learning and
adapting, the habitat and the entities inside it change.
Furthermore, Kirkman et al. (2012) addresses the need
and lack of multilevel analysis from agents to system. Given
the fractal structure of CAS and the systems approach, analy-
sis at different levels can be possible. An ecosystem or
organicist approach through a CAS understanding might
reveal the relationships among individual researchers, teams,
other teams (multiteam systems), organizations, and even
beyond. Thus, our understanding of the nonlinear relation-
ships between the effectiveness of an individual and a team,
the impact of research, the effectiveness of a lab, the impact
of a research funding program, and so on would increase
enormously. Clearly, more research is needed to explore the
multilevel relationships in VRCs.
Conclusion
The nature of scientific collaborations has changed, as a
result of the advancements in information and communica-
tion technologies. The environment in which scientific col-
laborations operate has changed because of technological,
economic, political, and social transformations. Therefore, a
new understanding of VRCs is needed for scholars, practitio-
ners, and the funding agencies.
CAS theory deals with how interacting agents in a
dynamic system adapt, coevolve, and produce novel struc-
tures. The framework developed in this study through CAS
theory concepts (diversity, interaction, interdependency,
feedback, emergence, and adaptation) provides us with a
holistic and comprehensive perspective to assess the poten-
tial creativity, adaptability, resilience, and probable success
of VRCs. VRCs are indeed diverse (with multiple goals, dis-
ciplines, and organizations involved), interacting and provid-
ing feedback (as members communicate with each other
frequently), interdependent (individual tasks are connected
to each other), and emergent (new relationships are estab-
lished and publications, technology, software, and equip-
ment are produced and shared with others). VRCs are
intrinsically adaptive (proactively changing their environ-
ment, while also reactively being changed by it). Table 3
matches the CAS concepts with VRCs.
Falk-Krzesinski et al. (2011) identified seven research
areas critical to the future of the science of team science
(including virtual teams): (a) measurement and evaluation of
team science; (b) structure and context for teams; (c) charac-
teristics and dynamics of teams; (d) management and organi-
zation of teams; (e) institutional support and professional
development for teams; (f) disciplinary dynamics and team
science; and (g) definitions and models of team science.
Through the CAS framework, these research areas can be
studied together or the findings from previous studies can be
brought together. For instance, using the CAS Framework,
the potential success and capability of a collaboration could
be evaluated prior to the funding agencies' committing their
already limited resources to support that collaboration. The
publication record of the grant proposers is an important
metric for evaluation, yet it is a limited tool for predicting the
success of the venture. The CAS Framework, being an
organicist or holistic approach, considers not only the

publications, but also other stages of scientific research as
well. Referring back to Falk-Krzesinski et al.'s (2011) seven
research areas above (a) the context a VRC operates in trans-
lates to the environment a CAS operates in. (b) and
(c) Complexity theory can provide a lot of value to scholars
studying the network structure of VRCs, such as relation-
ships, hubs, edges, centralities, but also brings new perspec-
tive to multiteam systems. (d) Concepts like emergence and
self-organization can explain bottom-up formations, shared
leadership practices, and working group structures, in VRCs.
(e) Institutional support is another system that needs to be
taken into account in the CAS perspective. (f) Diversity and
interaction aspects of complex systems and its implications
in VRCs have already been covered in this study. (g) Models
and concepts in CAS can help researchers make sense of
real-life VRCs.
In conclusion, a VRC operates in a complex environ-
ment. Nonlinear relationships at different levels (individual,
organizational, and even international) dominate the inter-
actions among agents. These dynamics, and thus the poten-
tial of a VRC, extend well beyond the publication record of
researchers. CAS theory provides a tool to integrate analy-
ses done at different levels. The importance of diversity and
interaction among team members, the role of leadership,
and the resilience and adaptation of a VRC to both internal
and external threats, could all be explored, explained, and
strengthened through the CAS Framework.

1. Diversity here does not refer to racial or ethnic diversity but
rather to various potential dimensions of professional diver-
sity, such as disciplinary, expertise, skill, or sector diversity.
