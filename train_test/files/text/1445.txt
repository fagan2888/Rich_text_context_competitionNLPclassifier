Abstract
Background: We present a potentially useful alternative approach based on support vector machine (SVM)
techniques to classify persons with and without common diseases. We illustrate the method to detect persons
with diabetes and pre-diabetes in a cross-sectional representative sample of the U.S. population.
Methods: We used data from the 1999-2004 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES) to
develop and validate SVM models for two classification schemes: Classification Scheme I (diagnosed or
undiagnosed diabetes vs. pre-diabetes or no diabetes) and Classification Scheme II (undiagnosed diabetes or pre-
diabetes vs. no diabetes). The SVM models were used to select sets of variables that would yield the best
classification of individuals into these diabetes categories.
Results: For Classification Scheme I, the set of diabetes-related variables with the best classification performance
included family history, age, race and ethnicity, weight, height, waist circumference, body mass index (BMI), and
hypertension. For Classification Scheme II, two additional variables­sex and physical activity­were included. The
discriminative abilities of the SVM models for Classification Schemes I and II, according to the area under the
receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve, were 83.5% and 73.2%, respectively. The web-based tool-Diabetes
Classifier was developed to demonstrate a user-friendly application that allows for individual or group assessment
with a configurable, user-defined threshold.
Conclusions: Support vector machine modeling is a promising classification approach for detecting persons with
common diseases such as diabetes and pre-diabetes in the population. This approach should be further explored
in other complex diseases using common variables.
Background
A supervised machine learning method, the support vec-
tor machine (SVM) algorithm [1], has demonstrated
high performance in solving classification problems in
many biomedical fields, especially in bioinformatics
[2,3]. In contrast to logistic regression, which depends
on a pre-determined model to predict the occurrence or
not of a binary event by fitting data to a logistic curve,
SVM discriminates between two classes by generating a
hyperplane that optimally separates classes after the
input data have been transformed mathematically into a
high-dimensional space. Because the SVM approach is
data-driven and model-free, it may have important dis-
criminative power for classification, especially in cases
where sample sizes are small and a large number of
variables are involved (high-dimensionality space). This
technique has recently been used to develop automated
classification of diseases and to improve methods for
detecting disease in the clinical setting [4,5].
To test the potential power of SVM as an approach
for classifying individuals into groups defined by disease
status, we chose diabetes as an example. In the U.S., dia-
betes affects an estimated 23.6 million people, of whom
about one third are unaware that they have the disease
[6]. Another 57 million people have pre-diabetes, with
elevated blood glucose levels that increase their risk of
developing diabetes, heart disease, and stroke. Recent
studies indicate that diabetes can be prevented by

lifestyle changes or pharmacotherapy among persons
with pre-diabetes [7-9]. Early screening and diagnosis is
thus central to effective prevention strategies [10]. To
this end, numerous risk scores and prediction equations
have been developed to identify people at high risk of
developing diabetes or with pre-diabetes based on com-
mon risk factors such as body mass index (BMI) and
family history of diabetes [11-13]. For example, a
recently published risk calculator uses logistic regression
to identify people with pre-diabetes and undiagnosed
diabetes by employing combinations of common risk
variables [14]. Our objective was to generate an SVM-
based approach to distinguish people with either undiag-
nosed diabetes or pre-diabetes from people without
either of these conditions. The variables used to gener-
ate the SVM models were limited to simple clinical
measurements that do not require laboratory tests. Pre-
dictions from this approach were compared with the
predictions from logistic regression models containing
the same set of variables. A final goal was to demon-
strate the applicability of the SVM approach by creating
a demonstration web-based classification tool.
Methods
Data source
In this study, we used a 1999-2004 data set from the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) to generate the SVM algorithm. NHANES is
an ongoing, cross-sectional, probability sample survey of
the U.S. population. It collects demographic, health his-
tory, and behavioral information from participants in
home interviews. Participants are also invited for
detailed physical, physiological, and laboratory examina-
tions that are performed by trained personnel in spe-
cially equipped mobile centers [15].
We limited our study to non-pregnant participants
aged 20 or older. Participants were considered to have
diagnosed diabetes if they answered "yes" to the ques-
tion "Have you ever been told by a doctor or health pro-
fessionals that you have diabetes?" Participants who
answered "no" to this question but who had a measured
fasting plasma glucose  126 mg/dl were considered to
have undiagnosed diabetes; those with a fasting plasma
glucose 100-125 mg/dl were considered to have pre-dia-
betes. Participants with fasting glucose <100 mg/dl were
considered to not have diabetes (Table 1).
We devised two different classification schemes
(Table 1). In Classification Scheme I, the group of
persons with diabetes (diagnosed or undiagnosed) was
distinguished from those without diabetes, including
persons with pre-diabetes. In Classification Scheme II,
the group of persons with either undiagnosed diabetes
or pre-diabetes was distinguished from those without
diabetes. The models were developed using a sample of
80% of the individuals in each group and validated in
the remaining 20%.
Variable selection
We selected 14 simple variables commonly associated
with the risk for diabetes: family history, age, gender,
race and ethnicity, weight, height, waist circumference,
BMI, hypertension, physical activity, smoking, alcohol
use, education, and household income. Variable selec-
tion was performed according to an automatic approach
developed by Chen et al. [16]. The significance of the
automatically selected set of variables was further manu-
ally evaluated by fine tuning parameters. The variables
included in the final selection were those with the best
discriminative performance.
Model generation
Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine
learning technique that is widely used in pattern recogni-
tion and classification problems. The SVM algorithm per-
forms a classification by constructing a multidimensional
hyperplane that optimally discriminates between two
classes by maximizing the margin between two data clus-
ters. This algorithm achieves high discriminative power by
using special nonlinear functions called kernels to trans-
form the input space into a multidimensional space [17].
The basic idea behind the SVM technique is to con-
struct an n-1 dimensional separating hyperplane to dis-
criminate two classes in an n-dimensional space. A data
point is viewed as an n-dimensional vector. For example,
two variables in a dataset will create a two-dimensional
space; the separating hyperplane would be a straight line
(one dimensional) dividing the space in half. When
more dimensions are involved, SVM searches for an
optimal separating hyperplane called the maximum-
margin separating hyperplane. The distance between the
hyperplane and the nearest data point on each side
(called support vectors) is maximized. The best scenario
is that two classes are separated by a linear hyperplane.
However, real-world situations are not always that sim-
ple. Some data points in the two classes might fall into
a "grey" area that is not easy to be separated. SVM
solves this problem by 1) allowing some data points to
the wrong side of the hyperplane by introducing a user-
specified parameter C that specifies the trade-off
between the minimization of the misclassifications and
maximization of margin; 2) using kernel functions
(usually including linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial
basis functions (RBF)) to add more dimensions to the
low dimensional space, as a result that two classes could
be separable in the high dimensional space. Figure 1
shows an example of an inseparable two-dimensional
space that becomes separable after the transformation of
the input space from low dimensional to multi

dimensional. The SVM approach tends to classify enti-
ties without providing estimates of the probabilities of
class membership in the dataset, which is a fundamental
difference from multiple logistic regression.
Two key parameters for the kernels, C and gamma,
need to be pre-selected to generate an optimal SVM
model. Parameter C controls over-fitting of the model
by specifying tolerance for misclassification. Parameter
gamma controls the degree of nonlinearity of the model.
We used LibSVM [18], a freely available SVM soft-
ware library, to generate the SVM models. To generate
the data set for model training, we randomly selected a
number of non-cases to match the number of cases in
the training data set (see Table 1 for the definitions of
cases and non-cases). According to the required data
format input, values of selected features were normal-
ized to values from - 1 to +1. Values of categorical vari-
ables such as Race are arbitrarily assigned to numbers
between -1 and +1. For example, -1, -0.5, 0, 0.5, 1
represents non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black,
Mexican American, other, other Hispanic respectively.
Values of continuous variables were transformed into
values between -1 and +1 by dividing them by an appro-
priate number. For example, the age values were divided
by 100. In the training data set, the first column of the
input data was set to the known outcome, i.e., 1 for
positive, - 1 for negative. A utility included in the
LibSVM package (grid.py) was used to find the optimal
parameters for penalty parameter C and gamma under
5-fold cross-validation. Different kernel functions,
including linear, polynomial, sigmoid, and radial basis
functions (RBF), were tested and selected for the models
based on performance.
Multiple logistic regression modeling (MLR) was per-
formed using the same selected risk variables or features
and case status (as specified previously and in Table 1)
as the outcome variable. The logistic regression analysis
was performed with the training data set using

for complex survey design. Then, the estimated b coeffi-
cients were applied to the test data set to calculate for
each individual the probability of being a case.
Model evaluations
Evaluation in the test data sets
Test data sets were used to assess the performance of
the models. Validation using the test data sets avoided
potential bias of the performance estimate due to over-
fitting of the model to training data sets. For the SVM
model, the data files in the test data sets were formatted
according to the requirement that variable values be
normalized to values from - 1 to +1; the first column of
the input data set (indicating case status) was set to 0.
Prediction program Java code from the LibSVM library
was modified to output the decision value (internal
score generated by SVM tool) for each member of the
test data set. For the logistic regression model, the pre-
diction value for each member of the test data set was
estimated by using the logistic regression function gen-
erated during the training step.
10-fold cross-validation in the training data set
To evaluate the robustness of the estimates from the
SVM models, a 10-fold cross-validation was performed
in the training data set. The training data set was parti-
tioned into 10 equal-size subsets. Each subset was used
as a test data set for a model trained on all cases and an
equal number of non-cases randomly selected from the
9 remaining data subsets. This cross-validation process
was repeated 10 times, allowing each subset to serve
once as the test data set. To generate summary perfor-
mance estimates, we averaged the area under the curve
(AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC)
curve and other statistics (sensitivity, specificity, positive
predictive value [PPV], negative predictive value [NPV])
of the cross-validations.
Statistics for performance evaluation
ROC curves were generated based on the predicted out-
come and true outcome. The AUCs for the test data
sets were calculated and used to compare the discrimi-
native powers of the models. We used Delong's method
to calculate P-values to compare the AUCs based on
results of the SVM models and MLR models [19].
Sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV were calculated
based on the following formulas when the cutoff value
was set to default value (0) in the SVM model.

Demonstration web-based classification tool
implementation
We implemented the SVM model as a web-based tool
that we called Diabetes Classifier. The application was
built by using J2EE technology [20] and other Java
open-source frameworks such as Hibernate [21] and
Strut [22]. LibSVM open-source Java codes were modi-
fied and embedded in the system source codes for pre-
diction. The lookup tables for cutoff values and
corresponding statistics (sensitivity, specificity) were
generated from the calculations on each data point in
the test data sets. Diabetes Classifier is freely accessible
via http://www.hugenavigator.net/DiseaseClassification-
Portal/startPageDiabetes.do
Results and Discussion
In Classification Scheme I (diagnosed or undiagnosed
diabetes vs. no diabetes or pre-diabetes), 8 variables­
family history, age, race and ethnicity, weight, height,
waist circumference, BMI, and hypertension­yielded the
best performance. In Classification Scheme II (undiag-
nosed diabetes or pre-diabetes vs. no diabetes), 10 vari-
ables­family history, age, race and ethnicity, weight,
height, waist circumference, BMI, hypertension, sex, and
physical activity­performed best. Kernel functions were
evaluated in terms of their discriminative accuracy by
AUC. The RBF kernel function performed best in Clas-
sification Scheme I, and the linear kernel function per-
formed best in Classification Scheme II (Table 2).
Performance parameters such as the AUC, sensitivity,
specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predic-
tive value are presented in Table 3. The overall discrimi-
native ability of Classification Schemes I and II are
represented by their AUC values (83.47% and 73.18%,
respectively; Figure 2).
The AUC values for logistic regression analyses of the
Classification Schemes I and II were 83.19% and 73.35%,
respectively (Figure 2). Comparing the AUCs from our
SVM and MLR models revealed no statistically signifi-
cant difference in their discriminative abilities (P =
0.3672 and P = 0.6718 for Classification Schemes I and
II, respectively); thus, the SVM approach appears to per-
form as well as the traditional logistic regression model.

Diabetes Classifier, the web-based demonstration tool,
was built based on the two SVM models. By selecting
one of the diabetes classifications, the user is asked to
enter the values for 8 or 10 common variables; the clas-
sification result is then presented on the next page,
using the default cutoff value (0). This application pro-
vides an interface that allows the user to select the cut-
off values. Each cutoff value has specific values of
sensitivity and specificity so that the user can decide
how the tool could be used in screening for diabetes.
Diabetes Classifier can also be used in batch mode to
classify observations in an uploaded file containing
appropriately formatted values of required variables.
Conclusions
In this study, we tested two classification schemes to
detect cases of diabetes and pre-diabetes in the U.S. popu-
lation. Both schemes are examples of the potential use of
support vector machine techniques in the classification of
common diseases. Our results demonstrated that the dis-
criminative performance of SVM models was equivalent
to the epidemiological method commonly used for this
purpose, multivariate logistic regression. To our knowl-
edge, this is the first report that the SVM approach can be
used successfully to detect a common disease with simple
clinical measurements, without laboratory tests. Based on
these results, we also developed a web-based tool for clas-
sification of diabetes and pre-diabetes. This tool demon-
strates useful features for the potential application of
classification algorithms in health care.
SVM is a model-free method that provides efficient
solutions to classification problems without any assump-
tion regarding the distribution and interdependency of
the data. In epidemiologic studies and population health
surveys, the SVM technique has the potential to perform
better than traditional statistical methods like logistic
regression, especially in situations that include multivari-
ate risk factors with small effects (e.g., genome-wide
association data and gene expression profiles), limited

sample size, and a limited knowledge of underlying bio-
logical relationships among risk factors. This is particu-
larly true in the case of common complex diseases
where many risk factors, including gene-gene interac-
tions and gene-environment interactions, have to be
considered to reach sufficient discriminative power in
prediction models [23]. Our work provides a promising
proof of principle by demonstrating the predictive
power of the SVM with just a small set of variables.
This approach can be extended to include large data
sets, including many other variables, such as genetic bio-
markers, as data become available.
A major strength of this study is that we used the
NHANES data set, which is a unique national weighted
survey data that is representative of the U.S. population.
Our results are comparable to those of other models
tested in the same population. For example, Keikes et al.
[24] developed a tool for detecting undiagnosed diabetes
and pre-diabetes using logistic regression and a classifi-
cation tree method to predict the risk of the diabetes in
the U.S. population. Although direct comparisons are
difficult because of the use of different NHANES data
sets and different validation strategies, the discriminative
powers in both studies seem to be equivalent. In our
study, the AUC for the detection of diagnosed diabetes
or undiagnosed diabetes was 83.47%, and it was 73.18%
for pre-diabetes or undiagnosed diabetes in the valida-
tion test. In the study from Keikes et al., the AUC for
undiagnosed diabetes were 82.19% (5-fold cross-valida-
tion) and 75.03% (training data set) for pre-diabetes or
undiagnosed diabetes. Schwarz et al. [25] recently pub-
lished a comprehensive review of existing tools for pre-
dicting the risk of type 2 diabetes or detecting
undiagnosed diabetes. These tools were developed for
different populations under different methodologies
using different sets of variables. In general, the discrimi-
native power of our SVM method is within the range of
discriminative powers reported for the tools included in
this review.
We cannot be certain that the models we developed
by using the particular NHANES data set described here
are applicable to other populations. Our SVM approach,
however, is easily extended to other populations to gen-
erate their own classification systems. Likewise, a similar
approach could be used to develop SVM models for
other complex diseases using a different set of relevant
variables.
A critical step for determining the usefulness of a
screening test is to establish optimal cutoff values that
yield optimal sensitivity and specificity values, which are
particularly important for cost-effectiveness analysis
[26]. Our web-based application, Diabetes Classifier, dis-
plays the trade-offs in sensitivity and specificity of the
classification method as the cutoff value is changed.
This feature is particularly relevant to clinical and public
health programs, which can configure cutoff scores
according to the objectives of the program and other
considerations including cost-effectiveness. Diabetes
Classifier allows data to be fed automatically (via data
batch file uploading) for classification and provides an
interface capable of sharing information with other sec-
tors of a health care system. Web-based tools such as
Diabetes Classifier can also serve as self-assessment
tools for use by the general public.
Support vector machine modeling is a promising clas-
sification approach for detecting a complex disease like
diabetes using common, simple variables. Validation
indicated that the discriminative powers of our two
SVM models are comparable to those of commonly
used multivariable logistic regression methods. Our Dia-
betes Classifier tool, a web-based tool developed for
demonstration purposes only, illustrates a potential use
of the SVM technique: the identification of people with
undetected common diseases such as diabetes and pre-
diabetes. This approach needs to tested and validated in
other studies.
