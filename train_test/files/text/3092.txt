SINCE THE HEALTH RISKS OF SMOK-
ing became generally known
following the release of the 1964
surgeon general's report,1 adult
smoking prevalence in the United States
has declined steadily.2,3 Not only has
adult cessation increased,2-4 but initia-
tion of smoking by adults became rare
by 1980,5 when the age of initiation of
regular smoking had shifted from early
adulthood to the midteenage years or
younger.6,7 Beginning in the early 1970s,
youth smoking also began to decline.
However, in the mid-1980s, the de-
cline was arrested, and during the early
1990s, adolescent smoking increased
rapidly.7-11 Although there is some in-
dication that adolescent smoking de-
clined slightly from 1996 to 1998,11 the
magnitude of the increase in the 1990s
alarmed many public health profes-
sionals and focused attention on pub-
lic policy to reduce adolescent smok-
ing. Recent prevention efforts during
the 1990s have emphasized school pro-
grams, media campaigns, and enforce-
ment of laws restricting the sale of ciga-
rettes to youth.
In 1991, we suggested that smoking
restrictions in the workplace might be
an important public health strategy for
reducing smoking in young adults.12
Hill and Borland13 reported that about
a third of adult Australian smokers
stated that they first started smoking
regularly at work. Workplace smoking
restrictions can reduce the opportu-
nity to smoke, and thereby interrupt
establishment of nicotine addiction.
A number of studies have shown
that workplace smoking restrictions
are associated with increased ces-
sation14-18 and reduced cigarette con-
sumption.14,16-26
It is important to determine whether
policies restricting smoking in the
workplace might be effective in reduc-
ing smoking among adolescents who

Context Recent marked increases in adolescent smoking indicate a need for new pre-
vention approaches. Whether workplace and home smoking restrictions play a role in
such prevention is unknown.
Objective To assess the association between workplace and home smoking restric-
tions and adolescent smoking.
Design, Setting, and Subjects Data were analyzed from 2 large national population-
based surveys, the Current Population Surveys of 1992-1993 and 1995-1996, which
included 17185 adolescents aged 15 to 17 years.
Main Outcome Measures Smoking status of the adolescents surveyed, com-
pared by presence of home and workplace smoking restrictions.
Results After adjusting for demographics and other smokers in the household, ado-
lescents who lived in smoke-free households were 74% (95% confidence interval [CI],
62%-88%) as likely to be smokers as adolescents who lived in households with no
smoking restrictions. Similarly, adolescents who worked in smoke-free workplaces
were 68% (95% CI, 51%-90%) as likely to be smokers as adolescents who worked in
a workplace with no smoking restrictions. Adolescent smokers were 1.80 (95% CI,
1.23-2.65) times more likely to be former smokers if they lived in smoke-free homes.
The most marked relationship of home smoking restrictions to current adolescent
smoking occurred in households where all other members were never-smokers. Cur-
rent smoking prevalence among adolescents in homes without smoking restrictions
approached that among adolescents in homes with a current smoker but with smoking
restrictions.
Conclusions Parents with minor children should be encouraged to adopt smoke-
free homes. Smoke-free workplaces can also augment smoking prevention. These find-
ings emphasize the importance of tobacco control strategies aimed at the entire popu-
lation rather than at youth alone.

work. Although few young adoles-
cents are employed, by midadoles-
cence many have part-time jobs. While
there is evidence of an association be-
tween home smoking restrictions and
adult smoking behavior,27-29 there is
little information about their poten-
tial impact on adolescents. Assuming
such an association, public policy that
encourages parents to voluntarily adopt
home smoking restrictions might prove
useful for prevention of adolescent
smoking. Two studies showed less
smoking experimentation among
elementary school students living in
households that restricted smok-
ing30,31; 1 of these studies31 also exam-
ined middle school students and found
a similar effect. Only 1 study has ex-
amined home smoking restrictions in
relationship to smoking among high
school students; it also included middle
school students and analyzed current
regular smoking instead of experimen-
tation, but no significant relationship
was demonstrated.32
The objective of this study was to ex-
amine whether household and work-
place smoking restrictions are associ-
ated with lower rates of adolescent
smoking. We used data from popula-
tion-based surveys conducted in the
1990s that asked questions about smok-
ing and included adolescents 15 to 17
years of age. Thus, we explore the re-
lationship of smoking restrictions to
current or former smoking at the time
of the interview.
METHODS
Data Sources
We combined data from 6 monthly Cur-
rent Population Surveys (CPSs) con-
ductedin1992-1993and1995-1996that
containedaspecialTobaccoUseSupple-
ment.33 The CPSs are conducted con-
tinuously by the US Census Bureau for
laborforcemonitoring;theycovertheci-
vilian, noninstitutionalized population
aged 15 years or older.34 The CPS is a
probability sample based on a stratified
sampling scheme of clusters of house-
holds,andtypicallysurveysabout56000
households containing approximately
110000 persons each month. The labor
force interviews are conducted with an
adult household member who re-
sponds for all eligible household mem-
bers.Incontrast,thespecialTobaccoUse
Supplement was individually adminis-
teredtoeachhouseholdmemberaged15
yearsorolder.ResponseratesfortheCPS
Labor Force Core Questionnaire were
over 93% for the 6 monthly surveys,
while the self-response rates for the To-
bacco Use Supplement were over 84%.
About a quarter of the interviews were
conducted in person with the remain-
der conducted by telephone. We re-
stricted the main analyses to the 17185
teenaged self-respondents who were 15
to 17 years of age when surveyed.
Measures
Smoking Status. Tobacco Use Supple-
ment respondents were asked, "Have
you smoked at least 100 cigarettes
in your entire life?" Those responding
"no" were classified as never-smokers,
while those responding "yes" were clas-
sified as smokers. Smokers were asked,
"Doyounowsmokecigaretteseveryday,
some days, or not at all?" Respondents
who answered "every day" or "some
days" were classified as current smok-
erswhilethosewhoanswered"notatall"
were considered former smokers.
Household Smokers. Adolescent re-
spondents were divided into 3 groups,
depending on the presence of current,
former, and never-smokers aged 15
years or older in the household. For this
purpose, the smoking status of the other
household members was used even if
obtained by proxy report. Adolescents
in the first group lived with never-
smokers only; adolescents in the sec-
ond group lived with at least 1 former
smoker but no current smokers; and
adolescents in the third group lived with
at least 1 current smoker.
Home Smoking Restrictions. To de-
termine the level of household smok-
ingrestrictions,respondentswereasked,
"Which statement best describes the
rulesaboutsmokinginyourhome?"Re-
sponse choices were: (1) no one is al-
lowed to smoke anywhere, (2) smok-
ing is allowed in some places or at some
times, or (3) smoking is permitted any-
where. These responses were desig-
nated as smoke-free, partial ban, and no
smoking restrictions, respectively.
Workplace Smoking Restrictions.
Employment status and workplace
smoking restrictions were used to as-
sign each adolescent respondent to one
of 5 categories. The workplace policy
questions were asked only of adoles-
cents who worked in either the public
orprivatesectorsandworkedindoorsbut
not in someone's home. Indoor work-
ers were asked, "Which of these best de-
scribes your place of work's smoking
policy for indoor public or common ar-
eassuchaslobbies,restrooms,andlunch
rooms?" and "Which of these best de-
scribes your place of work's smoking
policyforworkareas?"Responsechoices
for both questions were: (1) not al-
lowed in any (public/work) areas, (2) al-
lowed in some (public/work) areas, and
(3) allowed in all (public/work) areas.
Those who answered that smoking was
"not allowed in any public areas" and
"not allowed in any work areas" were
classifiedasworkinginsmoke-freework-
places. Those who only answered that
smoking was "not allowed in any work
areas" were classified as working under
a work-area ban. The remaining indoor
workers were classified as working un-
der a partial work-area ban. Depending
on employment status, the remaining
adolescentswereclassifiedaseitherother
workers (mostly outdoor workers or
workers in someone's home) or non-
workers.
School Enrollment and Hours
Worked. School enrollment was ascer-
tainedbyproxyorself-responseforper-
sons 16 to 24 years of age. In 1992-1993
the survey asked, "Last week was ( . . . )
attending or enrolled in a high school,
college or university?" and for those 15
years or older employed in the previous
week,"Howmanyhoursdid( . . . )work
last week at all jobs?" In 1995-1996, the
questions changed slightly: "Last week,
was( . . . )enrolledinahighschool,col-
lege or university?" and "How many
hours per week did ( . . . ) usually work
atthemainjob?"and"Howmanyhours
perweekdid( . . . )usuallyworkatother
(job/jobs)?"

Statistical Methods
The public-use data files for the 6 sur-
veys included a weighting variable for
self-respondents that ensures esti-
mates from the combined sample for
each year (ie, 1992-1993, 1995-1996)
are representative of the 1990 US popu-
lation by sex, age, race/ethnicity, and
region. Besides adjusting for demo-
graphic differences in nonresponse, the
weights also take into account the sam-
pling design.
2 Procedures were used to assess dif-
ferences among percentages (Yates-
adjusted for 22 tables, and Mantel-
Haenszel when a graded response was
expected). A result was considered sig-
nificant for these tests if P.01.

RESULTS
Changes in Smoking Restrictions
Over Time
Therewere1813currentand386former
smokers, which we grouped as ever-
smokers. The total number of never-
smokers was 14986. TABLE 1 shows that
the percentage (95% CI) of adolescents
(15-17 years old), who lived in smoke-
free households increased significantly
from 47.8% (±1.1%) in 1992-1993 to
55.0% (±1.3%) in 1995-1996. This was
true regardless of the smoking status of
other household members, but adoles-
cents living with current smokers were
less likely to live in smoke-free homes
at either time. While the percentage of
adolescents who worked outside the
home increased from 22.8% (±0.9%) to
27.2%(±1.2%)from1992-1993to1995-
1996, the percentage of adolescent in-
door workers in smoke-free work-
places increased from 22.7% (±1.9%) to
40.0%(±2.4%).Themean(SD)forhours

former smoker (and no current smok-
ers)wereonlyabout1.66(95%CI,1.37-
2.01) times more likely to be smokers.
Adolescents living in smoke-free homes
were 0.74 (95% CI, 0.62-0.88) times as
likely to be smokers as those living in

those who worked indoors with a par-
tial work-area ban. Nonworking adoles-
cents were 0.77 (95% CI, 0.63-0.95)
times as likely to be smokers as indoor
workers with a partial work-area ban.
Adolescents who live in smoke-free
homes are half as likely to be smokers
as those living in homes with no restric-
tions, regardless of their school enroll-
ment status (FIGURE 1). Further, ado-
lescents enrolled in school who work in
smoke-free workplaces are signifi-
cantlylesslikelytobesmokersthanother
workers and those working under a par-
tial indoor ban (FIGURE 2), but work-
place restrictions appear to have little ef-
fect on dropouts.
Cessation and Smoking
Restrictions
TABLE 3 shows the likelihood that an
adolescentsmokerwasincessationwhen
interviewed according to age and school
enrollment,householdcomposition,and
levelsofsmokingrestrictions.Again,the
odds ratios are adjusted for other demo-
graphics and the remaining variables in
the analysis. The likelihood of cessa-
tion was 1.60 (95% CI, 1.09-2.33) times
higher for adolescents living with a
former smoker (but no current smok-
ers) compared with those living with a
current smoker, but adolescents living
with only never-smokers did not show
significantly increased cessation.
Adolescents living in smoke-free
households were 1.80 (95% CI, 1.23-
2.65) times more likely to be in cessa-
tion than those living in households
with no restrictions on smoking. Par-
tial smoking restrictions were not sig-
nificantly associated with cessation. Un-
like ever-smoking, cessation was not
significantly related to workplace smok-
ing restrictions.
Household Composition,
Home Smoking Restrictions, and
Adolescent Smoking Prevalence
Adolescents living with a current
smoker had the highest smoking preva-
lence (FIGURE 3). Prevalence was about
the same for adolescents living with a
current smoker under either a partial
smoking ban or in a smoke-free home,
but was lower compared with those
with no household smoking restric-
tions (P=.02). In households with a
former smoker (but no current smok-
ers), there was no significant relation-
ship between smoking restrictions and
prevalence (P=.09). When adoles-
cents lived only with never-smokers,
however, the level of home smoking re-
striction was highly associated with
prevalence (P.001). Note that preva-
lence for the group with no home smok-
ing restrictions was only slightly higher
than prevalence in households with at
least 1 former smoker, and it ap-
proached the level for adolescents liv-
ing with a current smoker in house-
holds with only a partial restriction.
COMMENT
The results from these national sur-
veys strongly suggest that smoke-free
workplaces and homes are associated
with significantly lower rates of ado-
lescent smoking. Further, even after ad-
justment for the presence of smokers
in the household and school enroll-
ment, smoke-free homes have a greater
association with lower rates of smok-
ing prevalence than smoke-free work-
places. In addition, smoke-free homes
were associated with an increased like-
lihood of smoking cessation in adoles-
cent smokers. Complete rather than
partial bans on smoking in the home
and in the workplace produced the
most significant associations.
Because only about 25% of adoles-
cents are employed, smoke-free homes
should affect adolescent smoking more

than smoke-free workplaces. Al-
though a smoke-free workplace was as-
sociated with a significantly reduced
likelihood of an adolescent becoming
a smoker, it may not completely counter
the influence of the increased income
a job provides. Adolescents with more
spending money, either from employ-
ment or other sources, are more likely
to smoke, and smoke more on average
than adolescents with less discretion-
ary spending money.35
It is well-known that adolescents of
parentswhosmokearemorelikelytobe-
come smokers.36-39 Our results were ad-
justed for the smoking status of other
household members, generally the par-
ents. We previously showed that ado-
lescents whose parents had quit smok-
ing were only about two thirds as likely
tobesmokersasthosewithaparentwho
stillsmoked.40 Further,adolescentsmok-
ers whose parents had quit were twice
as likely to be former smokers when sur-
veyed than those with a parent who still
smoked. Finally, the earlier in the ado-
lescent's life that parents quit, the lower
the risk of their adolescent smoking.
Adult smokers (18 years or older) who
lived or worked under smoke-free con-
ditions were more likely to be actively
trying to quit and were more likely to be
in cessation for at least 6 months when
surveyed than were those reporting no
home or workplace smoking restric-
tions.28 Thus, smoke-free homes and
workplaces may also have an indirect ef-
fect on adolescent smoking by encour-
aging parental cessation.
Adoptionofasmoke-freehomepolicy
sends a message to family members that
smoking is not condoned, while the lack
of such a policy may send the opposite
message. Adolescents who lived in
households without a complete ban
where all of the other members were
never-smokers were nearly as likely to
be current smokers as adolescents who
lived in households with a current
smoker and at least partial household
smoking restrictions. Public health
policy should continue to educate the
population concerning the dangers of
secondhand smoke and stress that
adopting smoke-free homes is some-
thing concrete that parents can do to in-
fluence their children not to smoke.
Tobacco control efforts should also
continue to encourage smoke-free
workplace ordinances throughout the
United States. Besides protecting non-
smokers from secondhand smoke and
encouraging smoking cessation among
adults, smoke-free workplaces may be
an important strategy for reducing the
percentage of adolescents who be-
come smokers. Adolescents who ex-
periment with smoking and spend a sig-
nificant amount of their time at work
where smoking is prohibited may not
be as likely to progress to established
smoking. However, longitudinal stud-
ies are needed to establish this link.
Therearesomelimitationstothepre-
sent study. It is not longitudinal. Thus,
the results, while suggestive of impor-
tant associations, are not definitive.
Smoking status is by self-report, and it
is not validated by biochemical assay;
however, studies of adolescents have
shown that there is stability of self-
reported substance use and that ques-
tionnaires provide reliable data.41 Sec-

ond, telephone surveys of adolescents
often produce lower smoking preva-
lenceestimatesthanschoolsurveys.7 The
CPS measure of smoking (at least 100
cigarettes in one's lifetime) may be less
sensitive to underreporting. Adoles-
centswhohavesmokedafairamountare
probably less inclined to try to hide it
from parents (they likely already know)
or to be embarrassed about it with the
interviewer. Finally, there is the issue of
reporting discrepancy regarding home
smokingrestrictionsbyadolescentscom-
pared with household adults. House-
holdadultsalsowereaskedabouthouse-
hold smoking restrictions, and the
agreement among parents and adoles-
cents was high (81%). When there was
a household consensus, about the same
percentage of adults reported more
restrictive smoking policies (9%) as less
restrictive policies (10%) when com-
pared with the adolescent. Perceived
policy is probably more important than
actual policy set by household adults; if
adolescents think there are smoking
restrictions, it is likely that they will act
accordingly.
In summary, our findings suggest an
important role for smoke-free homes
and workplaces in reducing adoles-
cent smoking. More importantly, they
stress the importance of targeting to-
bacco control interventions to the en-
tire population for primary preven-
tion rather than emphasizing special
programs aimed only at adolescents. As
the prevalence trends in the mid-
1960s and early 1970s for adults and
adolescents indicate, it is likely that an-
other downturn in adolescent smok-
ing would follow a significant further
decline in adult smoking.
