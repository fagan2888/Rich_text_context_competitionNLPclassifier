Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone mass
sufficient to increase the risk of fractures
(Krane and Holick 1998), and is a common
and serious affliction of the elderly (Chandler
et al. 2000; Looker et al. 1995; Melton et al.
1992). Lead exposure may be a risk factor in
the development of osteoporosis. Animal
studies report that increased lead exposure is
associated with a decrease in bone density
(Escribano et al. 1997; Gruber et al. 1997;
Puzas et al. 1999) and bone strength (Ronis
et al. 2001). Additional in vitro studies report
that lead exposure inhibits the function of
chondrocytes (Hicks et al. 1996) and
osteoblasts, the cells that manufacture bone
(Klein and Wiren 1993; Puzas et al. 1999;
Ronis et al. 2001).
Human studies on this association are
limited. In a study of children, Laraque et al.
(1990) found no association between bone
density and lead exposure. However, because
the children were examined at a young age
(range, 18­47 months), sufficient time may
not have elapsed for the adverse effects on the
bone to become manifest. In a cross-sectional
study of 1,021 adults age 16­81 years, Alfvén
et al. (2002) also found no association
between lead exposure and bone mineral den-
sity (BMD). However, the mean blood lead
level was low among the subjects studied
[3.1 µg/dL (Alfvén T, personal communica-
tion)]--suggesting that the lack of an associa-
tion may have been attributed to low
exposure. In contrast, an epidemiologic study
on whether postmenopausal bone resorption
is associated with elevated blood lead levels
found an inverse association between blood
lead level (geometric mean blood lead level,
2.9 µg/dL among postmenopusal women)
and BMD (Nash et al. 2004). In a study of
former workers from a lead smelting facility,
there was an inverse association between the
log of the current blood lead level and spine
BMD [regression coefficient ­0.039; 95%
confidence interval (CI), ­0.060 to ­0.019;
p < 0.0002] (Potula et al. 2006).
As recently as the late 1970s, 78% of the
U.S. population had blood lead levels  10
µg/dL (Mahaffey et al. 1982), the current
threshold of concern defined previously by the
Centers for Disease Control (CDC 1991).
Bone is a repository for 90­95% of the total
body burden of lead (Wedeen 1992), and har-
bors it for years after initial exposure (Gulson
et al. 1995). Thus, a high proportion of adult
Americans may currently have elevated bone
lead levels. With this many who were exposed
to lead when younger, and the morbidity asso-
ciated with osteoporosis, it is important to
investigate whether an association exists
between lead exposure and osteoporosis in
humans. Our objective was to conduct a sec-
ondary analysis of a national database to
explore the association between lead exposure
and osteoporosis in a large number of adults.
Methods
NHANES III survey. We used data from the
Third National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES III), con-
ducted by the National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) of the CDC (NCHS 1998).
NHANES III is a national-probability, cross-
sectional survey of noninstitutionalized
Americans. It uses multistage, nonrandom
sampling techniques, and thus results were
weighted to be representative of the U.S.
population. Personal household interviews and
physical examinations of about 40,000 people
 2 months of age were conducted between
1988 and 1994 (NCHS 1994). Participants
gave written informed consent before entering
the study, with parents consenting for children.
The Household Adult Questionnaire was
administered to subjects  17 years of age, and
asked an extensive series of questions on their
health (NCHS 1994). This included questions
on the presence and location of back pain, and
past history, location, and mechanism of frac-
tures (NCHS 1994). The answers to these
questions were used to define clinical-based
outcome variables. Questions regarding covari-
ates (e.g., medications, medical conditions, cal-
cium intake, tobacco use, ethanol use, physical
activity) were also asked. Blood lead levels were

The Association between Blood Lead Levels and Osteoporosis among
Adults--Results from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III)

Department of Pediatrics, University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, New York, USA
BACKGROUND: Osteoporosis is a reduction in bone mass sufficient to increase the risk of fracture.
Lead exposure during childhood may be a risk factor for low bone mineral density (BMD). Basic-sci-
ence research demonstrates that lead exposure is associated with a decrease in BMD in animals.
However, human studies are limited.
OBJECTIVE: Our objective was to conduct a secondary analysis of a national database to explore the
association between lead exposure and osteoporosis in adult humans.
METHODS: In this study we used data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III). We analyzed subjects who were  50 years of age. A concurrent venous
blood lead level defined lead exposure. The primary outcome variable was the BMD of the total
hip. We conducted analyses on four groups: non-Hispanic white men, non-Hispanic white women,
African-American men, and African-American women. We conducted bivariate analyses between
covariates known to be associated with bone density (i.e., age, body mass index, calcium intake,
ethanol/tobacco consumption, physical activity, socioeconomic status) and the total hip BMD. The
significant covariates were introduced into analysis of covariance to determine the association
between BMD and blood lead level tercile.
RESULTS: The adjusted mean total hip BMD among non-Hispanic white males with a blood lead
level in the lowest tercile versus the highest tercile was 0.961 g/cm2 and 0.934 g/cm2, respectively
(p < 0.05). We also found a similar association among white females, but the difference was mar-
ginally significant (0.05 < p < 0.10).
CONCLUSIONS: We found a significant inverse association between lead exposure and BMD, but
only among white subjects. However, because of the cross-sectional design of NHANES, we cannot
make inferences about the temporal sequence of this association. With the large number of adults
who had lead exposure in the past and the morbidity associated with osteoporosis, further inquiry is
necessary on the possible casusal association between lead exposure and osteoporosis in humans.

measurements were conducted on all men and
nonpregnant women  20 years of age who
underwent the physical examination.
Study sample. In the present investigation
we focused on the 8,654 subjects  50 years of
age who took part in the Household Adult
Questionnaire. We defined this cutoff because
it is the age group in which primary osteo-
porosis occurs. From this group, subjects were
excluded if they did not have a blood lead
level and/or a BMD measurement (n = 2,430)
or if they had an ethnicity other than non-
Hispanic African American or non-Hispanic
white (n = 1,420). Because few women were
premenopausal (n = 115), we restricted the
analysis to postmenopausal women. The
remaining 4,689 subjects made up the pri-
mary sample, which underwent analysis.
Definition of lead exposure. We defined
lead exposure as the blood lead level at the
time the subject was interviewed by the
NHANES survey. Blood was collected by
venous phlebotomy and stored in EDTA-
anticoagulant tubes that were prescreened for
background lead contamination. We per-
formed duplicate lead analyses on each sam-
ple, and recorded the arithmetic mean of the
duplicates for each participant. Blood lead
was assayed by graphite-furnace atomic
absorption spectrophotometry (Gunter et al.
1996). Blood lead levels below the detection
limit were assigned a value of 0.7 µg/dL.
Definition of BMD and clinical outcomes.
The primary outcome was the mean BMD of
the total hip. BMD measurements were
obtained using dual-energy X-ray absorptiom-
etry (DEXA) instruments (QDR 1000;
Hologic, Waltham, MA) in pencil-beam
mode. A quality control program was used to
ensure data quality (Wahner et al. 1994). The
sites examined were limited to the hip: the
femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter,
Ward's triangle, and total hip (NCHS 1994).
We limited our analyses to the total hip
because the BMD of the hip subregions are
highly correlated with the BMD of the total
hip (r = 0.76­0.98) (Kalkwarf et al. 2003).
Two clinical outcomes were defined: the
presence of back pain, and whether the sub-
ject had an osteoporotic-related fracture. The
vertebrae are the most common bone to be
fractured due to osteoporosis, often resulting
in back pain (Krane and Holick 1998). We
categorized subjects as having back pain if
they responded on the Household Adult
Questionnaire as having had lower and/or
middle back pain over the preceding
12 months. The second clinical measure of
osteoporosis was based on whether the subject
had a fracture due to osteoporosis. Subjects
were classified as having had a fracture due to
osteoporosis if they had a hip, wrist, or verte-
bral fracture [sites most commonly affected
by osteoporosis (Krane and Holick 1998)] at
 50 years of age that occurred because of a
fall from a standing height or less. Subjects
were classified as not having had a fracture
due to osteoporosis if they reported never
having had a fracture, having had a fracture at
< 50 years of age, or having had a fracture at
 50 years of age caused by a fall farther than
from a standing height, from a car accident or
other severe trauma.
Definition of covariates. In adjusted
analysis, we considered several confounders:
age, race, sex, body mass index (BMI),
menopausal status, tobacco use, alcohol use,
physical activity, calcium intake, chronic
medical conditions, use of certain medica-
tions, and socioeconomic status.
Race and sex are strongly associated with
bone density (Cooper et al. 1992; Nelson et al.
1997; Snelling et al. 2001; Turner et al. 1998).
We therefore conducted analyses stratified by
sex and race (i.e., non-Hispanic white men,
non-Hispanic white women, African-American
men, and African-American women).
Higher weight is associated with a
decreased risk of osteoporosis (CDC 1998;
Seeman et al. 1983; Snelling et al. 2001). As a
measure of body mass, we used the BMI,
defined as the weight in kilograms divided by
the square of the height in meters.
Menopausal status is strongly associated
with bone density (Krane and Holick 1998;
Nash et al. 2004). Because the NHANES data-
base does not provide a single variable defining
a woman's menopausal status, we created a
variable to categorize women as premenopausal
or postmenopausal. The following criteria
(Kalkwarf et al. 2003) were applied sequen-
tially so that the successive rules were applied
only to women not already categorized: a) age
 60 years, postmenopausal; b) bilateral
oophorectomy, postmenopausal; c) a period or
pregnancy within the previous 12 months, pre-
menopausal; d) follicle-stimulating hormone
level > 40 IU/L, postmenopausal; e) current
use of oral contraceptive pill, premenopausal;
f ) age 50­59 years, postmenopausal. We
found that few women were premenopausal
(n = 115). We thus restricted the analysis to
postmenopausal women; therefore, menopausal
status was not adjusted in the analysis.
Smoking tobacco is associated with an
increased risk of osteoporosis (Seeman et al.
1983). Subjects were classified into those who
never smoked, former smokers, and current
smokers.
Alcohol consumption is associated with
an increased risk of osteoporosis (Seeman
et al. 1983). Subjects reported the average
number of alcoholic beverages consumed per
day and the number of days that an alcoholic
beverage was consumed over the previous
12 months. These two terms were multiplied
together and divided by 12 to give a measure
of the average number of drinks consumed
per month over the previous year.
Increased physical activity is associated
with a decreased risk of hip fractures (Cooper
et al. 1988; Lau et al. 1988; Snelling et al.
2001). Subjects were asked about the fre-
quency at which they conducted 13 physical
activities (i.e., walking, jogging, bicycling,
swimming, doing aerobics, dancing, doing
calisthenics, gardening, lifting weights, and
four "other" categories) over the previous
month. A measure of monthly physical activ-
ity was defined by summing the number of
times that each of 13 physical activities was
performed. Although this is a measure of cur-
rent physical activity, studies report that cur-
rent physical activity is correlated to physical
activity over a person's lifetime (Hirvensalo
et al. 2000; Rhodes et al. 1999).
Increased calcium intake is associated with
increased bone density (Johnston et al. 1992;
Turner et al. 1998). Subjects were asked about
past intake of milk. Subjects specified the fre-
quency of milk consumption (never, less than
once per week, once per week, less than once
per day but more than once per week, once
per day, more than once per day) for each of
several age strata (i.e., 5­12, 13­17, 18­35,
36­65, and > 65 years). As a proxy of calcium
intake, we calculated a measure of milk con-
sumption during bone anabolism--from
childhood until roughly the mid-thirties. We
assigned each frequency of milk consumed
during an age stratum (never, less than once
per week, once per week, less than once per
day but more than once per week, once per
day, more than once per day) an ordinal value
(respectively, 0­5). We calculated the propor-
tion of years an age stratum made up the 5- to
35-year age span (for example, the 5- to 12-
year age strata makes up 0.26 of the 5- to 35-
year age span). We multiplied the ordinal
value representing the frequency of milk con-
sumption during an age stratum by the pro-
portion of years the corresponding age stratum
made up the 5- to 35-year age span. Three age
strata were used (i.e., 5­12 years, 13­17 years,
18­35 years). Each of the three resulting terms
were added to achieve a weighted estimate of
weekly milk consumption between 5 and
35 years of age.
Medications may also affect bone density.
We identified whether the subject reported
taking medications that adversely affect bone
density (i.e., anticonvulsants, calcitonin,
cyclosporine, cytotoxic drugs, estrogens, gluco-
corticoids, progesterones). This outcome was
defined dichotomously (i.e., currently using or
not using medications that affect bone den-
sity). We also defined a second measure based
on whether the female subjects had even been
on any kind of estrogen replacement therapy.
The presence of certain chronic medical
conditions--such as thyroid disease--is

known to cause changes in bone density. We
identified whether a physician had ever told
the subject that she or he had thyroid disease.
This outcome was defined dichotomously.
Other chronic medical conditions (i.e.,
arthritis, heart failure, stroke, bronchitis,
emphysema, gout, and cancers) were not
controlled using this measure because they
would affect BMD via altered levels of physi-
cal activity and/or use of medications. These
latter two variables are already included in
the regression model.
We used educational level as a proxy of
socioeconomic status. Other measures of
socioeconomic status, such as poverty index
ratio, had many missing values and were never-
theless moderately correlated to educational
level (Pearson correlation = 0.47; p < 0.001).
Analyses. We analyzed the association
between current blood lead level and total hip
BMD among four groups: non-Hispanic white
men, non-Hispanic white women, African-
American men, and African-American women.
To identify covariates for adjusted analysis, we
conducted bivariate analysis (for each afore-
mentioned age- and sex-defined group)
between the variables described above and the
total hip BMD. For continuous covariates, we
calculated Pearson correlation coefficients and
the corresponding two-tailed p-value. For
categorical covariates, we used the t-test to
compare mean BMD and calculated the corre-
sponding two-tailed p-value. Covariates found
to be sizable (i.e., p  0.20) were analyzed in a
correlation matrix to assess for collinearity; we
found that within each sex- and race-defined
group, no covariates were multicollinear (i.e.,
correlation coefficient > 0.50) with each other.
We decided a priori to introduce age and BMI
as covariates into all adjusted analyses for each
of the four sex- and race-defined groups. In
addition, we identified the following additional
covariates as significant: for non-Hispanic
white males, education level; for African-
American males, education level, presence of
chronic medical condition, and calcium intake;
for non-Hispanic white females, education
level and use of estrogen replacement; for
African-American females, education level, use
of estrogen replacement, and calcium intake.
The significant covariates were introduced
into analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to
determine the independent association
between BMD of the total hip and blood lead
level tercile. We assessed each model for
assumptions required by ANCOVA (Leech
et al. 2005). We found, for each age- and sex-
defined group, that BMD was normally dis-
tributed within each blood lead level tercile;
further, there was homogeneity of variance of
the BMD between each blood lead level ter-
cile. To achieve the assumption of homogene-
ity of regression slopes of the continuous
covariates for each blood lead level tercile, we
log-transformed BMI in the analysis of the
non-Hispanic white males; no transforma-
tions were required for the remaining age-
and sex-defined groups. Finally, to account
for the assumption that observations must be
independent, we used SUDAAN software to
adjust for the multistage, nonrandom sam-
pling design of the survey (Shah et al. 1991).
In the unadjusted analysis of the clinical
outcomes, for each of the four sex- and race-
defined groups, we calculated the proportion
of subjects with lower back pain and with frac-
tures due to osteoporosis as a function of blood
lead level tercile. We noted that the differences
in BMD between blood lead level terciles
diminished in adjusted analyses. Because of
this, and because the comparisons of the pro-
portions of the unadjusted clinical outcomes
were small and not significant, we did not con-
duct adjusted analysis of the clinical outcomes.
Results
The demographic data of the four race- and
sex-defined groups are presented in Table 1.
The adjusted analyses revealed a significant
inverse association between lead exposure and
BMD among the non-Hispanic white male
subjects (Table 2). The adjusted mean total
hip BMD among non-Hispanic white males
with a blood lead level in the lowest versus the
highest tercile was 0.961 gm/cm2 versus
0.934 gm/cm2 (p < 0.05). An association with
marginal significance was discerned among
non-Hispanic white females. The adjusted
mean total hip BMD among non-Hispanic
white females with a blood lead level in the
lowest versus the highest tercile was 0.789
gm/cm2 versus 0.771 gm/cm2 (p = 0.09). No
association was discerned among African-
American subjects. In addition, we found that
none of the comparisons of the clinical out-
comes (i.e., prevalence of back pain, osteo-
porotic fractures) by blood lead level tercile
were significant.
Discussion
Our study found a significant inverse associa-
tion between lead exposure and BMD, but
only among white subjects (Table 2). Although
there was a negative trend between blood lead

level tercile and BMD among the African-
American subjects, the differences were not sig-
nificant. This lack of significance may be
attributed to a considerably smaller sample size
of the African-American subjects than the
white subjects.
No association was found between blood
lead level tercile and clinical outcomes. A pos-
sible explanation may be the relatively small
difference in BMD between blood lead tercile.
Clinical trials of bisphosphanates that found
differences in clinical outcomes such as frac-
ture rates reported corresponding differences
in BMD of  5% (Black et al. 1996; Bone
et al. 1997; Liberman et al. 1995). Among the
non-Hispanic white subjects in our study, the
difference in BMD between the low tercile
and high tercile was about 2­3%. This differ-
ence in BMD may be too small to discern a
significant difference in clinical outcomes.
Another possible reason for a lack of an associ-
ation is that neither clinical outcome may be
valid as a measure of osteoporotic fractures.
Not all osteoporotic vertebral fractures cause
pain. Conversely, it is possible other causes of
back pain obscured the pain due to osteopor-
tic vertebral fractures.
It is possible that our findings of an
inverse association between lead exposure and
BMD is spurious because of inadequately
controlled covariates. For example, the meas-
ure of calcium intake required a subject to
recall the quantity of milk consumed during
their youth. However, if their recall was not
reliable, the use of this measure in adjusted
analysis could lead to inadequate control of a
potential confounder. In another example, we
controlled for the use of current medications.
However, because current medication use
may not reliably measure effects of past med-
ication use, its use in adjusted analysis could
again lead to inadequate control of a potential
confounder.
A limitation of this study is the cross-sec-
tional design of the NHANES database.
Although we found a significant inverse
association, it is unclear whether past lead
exposure caused a lower BMD, or whether an
elevated blood lead level is a result of a lower
BMD. In other words, it is possible that
increased bone turnover produced an increase
in blood lead from the endogenous release of
lead from the bone. Using stable lead isotope
fingerprinting methods, Gulson et al. (1998,
2002) found that lead can be mobilized from
the skeleton into the blood. This issue has
been raised in the literature. Nash et al.
(2004), using NHANES III, also found an
inverse association between BMD and blood
lead level among perimenopausal and post-
menopausal women, and concluded that lead
stored in bone may significantly increase
blood lead levels. However, because of the
cross-sectional design of NHANES, they
acknowledged not being able make inferences
about the temporal sequence of this associa-
tion. The same is certainly true of our study.
Despite the previous limitation, it is possi-
ble the association found in this study reflects
lead as causative in the development of osteo-
porosis. In vitro studies show that lead
adversely affects growth plate chondrocytes by
altering cell phenotype and function (Hicks
et al. 1996). Other in vitro research reports
that lead inhibits osteoblast phenotype and
function (Bonucci 1981; Klein and Wiren
1993; Puzas et al. 1992). The strongest evi-
dence in support of causation comes from ran-
domized trials on animals. Histomorphometry
of the growth plates of lead-exposed rats shows
defective remodeling, altered growth plate
thickness due to the loss of proliferating cells,
and disorganization of the growth plate archi-
tecture (Hamilton and O'Flaherty 1994).
Escribano et al. (1997) found that histomor-
phometric measures of bone density (i.e., bone
volume, trabecular number, and trabecular
thickness) were lower in lead-exposed rats than
controls. Gruber et al. (1997) found that lead-
exposed rats (mean blood lead level 21 µg/dL)
had lower DEXA-based BMD than controls.
Other researchers have also shown that lead
exposure decreases BMD or bone strength in
rats (Puzas et al. 1999; Ronis et al. 2001), and
inhibits fracture healing in mice (Carmouche
et al. 2005).
As described in the introduction, a high
proportion of adult Americans may currently
have elevated bone lead levels. With this large
number of lead-exposed adults, and the mor-
bidity associated with osteoporosis, it is
important to investigate further whether a
causative association exists between lead expo-
sure and osteoporosis in humans.
