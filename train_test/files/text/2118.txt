Purpose of the study: This study examines how
employment status (worker vs. retiree) and life course
influences (age, gender, and marital status) are asso-
ciated with time spent on daily household chores.
Second, this study assesses whether the associations
between daily stressors and time spent on daily
household chores differ as a function of employment
status and life course influences. Design and
methods: Men and women aged 55­74 from the
National Study of Daily Experiences (N = 268;
133 workers and 135 retirees), a part of the National
Survey of Midlife in the United States (MIDUS), com-
pleted telephone interviews regarding their daily
experiences across 8 consecutive evenings. Results:
Working women spent more than double the amount
of time on daily household chores than working
men. Unmarried retirees spent the most time on daily
household chores in comparison to their counterparts.
There was a trend toward significance for the associa-
tion between home stressors from the previous day
and time spent on daily household chores as a function
of employment and marital status. Implications: These
findings highlight the importance of gender and marital
status in the associations between employment status
and time spent on daily household chores and the
role that daily stressors, in particular home stressful
events, have on daily household chore participation.
The transition from paid work to retirement
may represent the opportunity to be relieved of the
psychological and physical stressors associated
with employment. Retirement has been linked to
an improvement in well-being (e.g., increased pos-
itive affect, lower levels of stress) and self-reported
health behaviors (e.g., more regular exercise; Mein,
Martikainen, Hemingway, Stansfeld, & Marmot,
2003; Midanik, Soghikian, Ransom, & Tekawa,
1995). At the same time, retirement may pres-
ent challenges (Butterworth et al., 2006; Buxton,
Singleton, & Melzer, 2005). Importantly, the tran-
sition from paid work to retirement may lead to a
recalibration of one's time use in daily activities.
This paper contributes to the study of retirement
and time use by examining how employment sta-
tus and life course influences are associated with
time spent on daily household chores in a sample
of midlife and older adults. Furthermore, this study
examines the influences of daily stressors in the
association between employment status and life
course influences (i.e., age, gender) on time spent
on daily household chores.
Daily Time Spent on Household Chores
The nature of retirement differs from paid work
in terms of expectations, opportunities, and chal-
lenges, and thus employment status is expected to
influence how individuals spend time in their daily
lives. In 2010, employed persons in the United
States worked an average of 7.5 hr on the days they
worked for pay (United States Bureau of Labor

Statistics, 2011a). In contrast to work, retirement
may free up time for individuals to participate in
other activities. Retirees, especially those in good
health, now may have more time to explore per-
sonal and social interests. Research has shown that
individuals out of the labor force, as compared to
employed individuals, reported spending signifi-
cantly more time in passive and active leisure activ-
ities (Krantz-Kent & Stewart, 2007; Rosenkoetter,
Garris, & Engdahl, 2001). A particular area of
interest to researchers has been how individuals
spend their time on household chores.
Most of the household time use studies have
focused on working families with children in the
household (e.g., Lee & Waite, 2005; Manke, Seery,
Crouter, & McHale, 1994). Although there have
been studies that examined the effects of retirement on
housework participation (e.g., Solomon, Acock, &
Walker, 2004; Szinovacz, 2000), the literature
tends to focus on married couples and the influ-
ences of gender roles and ideologies (e.g., Solomon
et al., 2004; Szinovacz, 2000; Szinovacz & Harpster,
1994); thereby limiting the generalizability of
findings. Overlooked in this area of research is how
retirement is embedded in layers of temporal and
social contexts that shape daily behaviors. By under-
standing how different temporal and social contexts
(e.g., daily stress, age, gender, martial status) shape
time spent on daily household chores in a sample
of workers and retirees in midlife and old age, we
will ultimately be able to better understand family
dynamics and processes under a wider context.
Daily Stress
Lacking in the retirement and household time
use literature is the influence of daily stress in the
associations between retirement and time spent on
daily household chores. The change in social role
from worker to retiree may be advantageous in
that individuals no longer have to experience the
challenges associated with the work environment.
For others, the shift from work to retirement may
be negative. Because changes in one's social role
may entail possible transformations in identities,
activities, and environment (George, 1993), the
shift from worker to retiree may increase or decrease
one's vulnerability to stressors and the stress
responses in their daily experiences.
Daily stressors are the routine challenges of
day-to-day living, such as having arguments with a
family member, car breaking down, or experiencing
a broken dishwashing machine (Almeida, 2005).
Daily stressors occur more frequently and unex-
pectedly than major life events and can disrupt
daily life (Almeida, 2005). These interruptions
have immediate negative impacts on psychological
and physical functioning (Almeida, Wethington, &
Kessler, 2002; Bolger, DeLongis, Kessler, &
Schilling, 1989). Consequently, daily stressors can
pile up over a series of days, which may result in
more detrimental stress reactions (e.g., anxiety,
depression; Lazarus, 1999; Zautra, 2003). Because
daily stressors are likely to have immediate impacts
that disrupt day-to-day living, we expect that
daily stressors will deplete time spent on daily
household chores. In this study, we examine how
daily stressors shape the associations between
employment status and daily household chore
participation.
Life Course Daily Stress Perspective
The present paper views retirement as a transi-
tion within the context of life course development
by utilizing a Life Course Daily Stress perspective
(LCDS; Almeida & Wong, 2009). According to
this perspective, daily stress processes may be pre-
cipitated by life transitions. It is during the period
of uncertainty that stress tends to be higher, and
transitions often involve a transformation of mul-
tiple domains of responsibilities. Life transitions
may occupy an important role in daily stressor
reactivity. Stressor reactivity is the likelihood that
an individual will react emotionally or physically
to daily stressors (Almeida, 2005). How an indi-
vidual will react to daily stressors also depends on
the individual's resilience or vulnerability. The
resources of an individual as well as his/her envi-
ronments (e.g., age, gender, marital status) can
limit or enhance the possibilities and opportunities
for coping with daily experiences (Lazarus, 1999).
Depending on these resources, reactivity to stress-
ors, therefore, is likely to differ across people and
situations (Almeida, 2005). The emotional and
physical impacts of minor day-to-day stressors may
be magnified in the context of a major life transition
such as retirement.
The goals for this paper are twofold. First, we
are interested in how employment status (worker
vs. retiree) and life course influences (age, gender,
and marital status) are associated with time spent
on daily household chores (hypotheses are
described subsequently). Second, we build upon
the stressor reactivity concept to include behavioral
reactivity to daily stressors by examining whether
83
Vol. 53, No. 1, 2013 3
the associations between daily stressors and time
spent on daily household chores differ as a function
of employment status and life course influences.
We predict that time spent on daily household
chores will decrease on stressor days as compared
to days without stressors, and these associations
will differ as a function of employment status and
life course influences. To better interpret the direc-
tionality of the effects of daily stressors on time
spent on daily household chores, we focused on
daily stressors from the previous day.
Life Course Factors
Age.--Depending on when a transition occurs,
the meaning of the transition varies and affects
individuals differently (Wheaton, 1990). The study
of retirement and daily experiences must not ignore
the consideration of timing, as assessed by age. We
predict that younger workers, in comparison to
their counterparts, will spend the least amount of
time on daily household chores because of occupa-
tion of more social roles (Lachman & James, 1997)
and greater time restriction due to paid work.
Past studies have shown that younger individuals
are more emotionally and physically reactive
to daily stressors than older individuals (Birditt,
Fingerman, & Almeida, 2005; Neupert, Almeida, &
Charles, 2007), for younger individuals may have
less effective cognitive resources to regulate their
emotions and manage their physical reactions. In
line with these findings, we predict that younger
individuals in our study will be more behaviorally
reactive to daily stressors in their time spent on
daily household chores than older individuals. We
also predict that younger workers, who may be
less cognitively mature than older individuals and
face greater demands than retirees, will exhibit
greater behavioral reactions to daily stressors than
their counterparts.
Gender.--Another important life course influ-
ence in shaping employment and daily household
chore participation is gender. Despite that there
are more women in the U.S. labor force than the
1970s (United States Bureau of Labor Statistics,
2011b; Institute for Women's Policy Research,
2009), there continues to be evidence documenting
that women perform the majority of household
tasks (Bianchi, Milkie, Sayer, & Robinson, 2000;
Coltrane, 2000). While men are carrying out
household tasks, the tasks tend to be less routine
and frequent in nature (e.g., mowing the lawn)
than those performed by women (e.g., cooking;
Coltrane, 2000). Of the studies that examined the
effects of retirement on housework participation
(e.g.,Solomonetal.,2004),findingsgenerallyshowed
that women continue to carry out the majority of the
responsibilities. Based on previous literature, we
predict that women, regardless of employment sta-
tus, will report the greatest amount of time spent
on daily household chores. We also hypothesize that
retired men, now with more time availability, will
report more time performing daily household chores
than workingmen. For our stress reactivity hypoth-
esis, we predict that women, especially those working,
will exhibit the greatest reactivity than their coun-
terparts because past studies have documented
women experience stressors more negatively than
men (Almeida & Horn, 2004; Bolger et al., 1989).
Marital Status.--Marital status plays an impor-
tant role in shaping retirement transition (Kim &
Moen, 2002; Wong & Hardy, 2009). Marriage can
safeguard and buffer individuals, especially women,
from financial insecurity by offering another ave-
nue of access to financial resources (e.g., husband's
pension; Pienta, Hayward, & Jenkins, 2000),
which can better prepare individuals for retirement
and help ease the retirement experiences. The
importance of marital transitions on housework
performance has been documented in previous
studies (e.g., Gupta, 1999). In this study, we pre-
dict that unmarried workers will spend the least
amount of time on daily household chores because
of the absence of a spouse to share the daily house-
hold responsibilities as well as the greater time
restriction associated with employment. Similarly,
we predict unmarried workers will be the most
reactive to daily stressors with respect to time spent
on daily household chores.
Current Study
The decision to retire or work is a self-sorting
process based on push and pull factors, including
health problems (Szinovacz & Davey, 2005) and
finances (Pienta & Hayward, 2002). Although the
data in this study does not allow for the examina-
tion of reasons for work or retirement, this study
tries to account for differences (e.g., functional
limitations, finances) that might exist between
workers and retirees. The data in this study was
collected during the mid- and late-1990s in the
United States. Unlike the years before and after,
the mid- and late-1990s was free of recession and

a period of economic growth. Data from this time
period can provide insights to the daily retirement
experiences when the economic climate of the
United States was relatively stable. In summary,
the current paper examines how employment sta-
tus (worker vs. retiree) and life course influences
(age, gender, and marital status) are associated
with time spent on daily household chores in a
sample of midlife and older individuals. This study
also assesses whether the associations between
daily stressors from the previous day and time spent
on daily household chores differ as a function of
employment status and life course influences.
Design and Methods
Sample and Procedure
The current study utilized data from the first
wave of National Study of Daily Experiences
(NSDE), which is the daily diary portion of the
National Survey of Midlife in the United States
(MIDUS). Respondents in the NSDE randomly
were selected from the MIDUS sample of 3,032
men and women age 25­74. The 1,031 NSDE
respondents completed telephone interviews
about daily time use, stressors, positive events,
and physical symptoms over eight consecutive eve-
nings. Data collection spanned from March 1996
to April 1997.
For this study, respondents were selected based
on several criteria. Respondents must have valid
employment status response. Of the 1,031 respon-
dents, 880 met this criterion. Age has been associ-
ated with the likelihood to work (i.e., younger
individuals are more likely to work; older individ-
uals are more likely to retire); therefore, this study
limited the respondents to age 55­74. This age
range also reflected the most even distribution
of workers and retirees. Of the 880 respondents,
276 met the age criterion. Children in the house-
hold may contribute to financial obligations and
increase opportunities for time spent on daily house-
hold chores and stressor exposure. Eight respon-
dents (all workers) with children under age 18 in
the household were excluded. Final sample size for
this study was 268. For our sample of 268 respon-
dents, we started with an initial sample of 2,144 days.
We dropped days when respondents had missing
data for the time-varying predictors/covariates. Our
final sample consisted of 268 respondents with
1,994 days.
Presented in Table 1 are the demographic charac-
teristics of the respondents by employment status.
Workers were significantly younger than retirees.
Among the workers, there were more women
than men, whereas, the sample of retirees was
comprised of more men. Although this sample of
workers and retirees significantly did not vary
by marital status, race or education, they dif-
fered by functional limitations and total house-
hold income with workers reporting fewer health
limits and higher household income (M = 1.65;
M = $55,878) than retirees (M = 2.18; M =
$46,716).
Measures
Time Spent on Daily Household Chores.--On
each study day, respondents reported the amount
of time (in hours and minutes) that they spent on
household chores during the previous 24 hr.
Respondents were instructed not to include time
spent on paid work, volunteer work, or taking
care of children in their response. On average,
respondents spent 2.20 hr (SD = 2.06) on daily
household chores.
Employment Status.--Respondents reported their
employment status using, "What is your current

employment situation?". Instructed to select all
that applied, respondents indicated yes, no, or do
not know to the following options: working now,
self-employed, unemployed, temporarily laid off,
retired, homemaker, full-time student, and part-time
student. Do not know responses were eliminated.
In an attempt to have a mutually exclusive concep-
tualization of employment status, conflicting employ-
ment status responses (e.g., working now and
retired) were excluded. This study comprised of
133 workers and 135 retirees.
Age and Gender.--Age was included as a
continuous variable centered at the sample mean
(M = 62.9; SD = 5.7). Gender was coded as women
(1) and men (0).
Marital Status.--Respondents reported their
marital status using the following options: married,
separated, divorced, widowed, or never married.
The small percentage of respondents in the non-
married categories resulted in a contrast between
married (1) and unmarried (0).
Daily Stressors.--The Daily Inventory of Stress-
ful Events (DISE; Almeida et al., 2002) was used to
assess daily stressors on each study day. The inven-
tory consisted of a series of stem questions for
identifying whether seven types of stressful events
(arguments or disagreements, avoided arguments
and tensions, home, work, network, discrimina-
tion, and other) had occurred in the past 24 hr. For
each of the seven stressful events, respondents
received a score of 1 if a stressor was reported and
a score of 0 if no stressor was reported. We
excluded work stressors from our analyses because
work stressors are incomparable for the two groups.
From the six types of stressful events, we created an
"any stressor" variable, which represented whether
a respondent experienced any of the six stressful
events on each study day (1 = at least one stressor,
0 = no stressor). We focused on daily stressors
from the previous day to better interpret the direc-
tionality of the effects of daily stressors on time
spent on daily household chores.
Control Variables.--To account for potential
health influences that may differ between workers
and retirees, functional health was included.
Respondents reported how much their health limits
them when performing the following six activities:
lifting or carrying groceries; bathing or dressing
oneself; climbing several flights of stairs; bending,
kneeling, or stooping; walking several blocks; and
walking one block (see Greenfield & Marks,
2009). Respondents who rated that their health
limited them to any extent on a given activity were
coded 1, and those reported that their health did
not limit them were coded 0. The scores across the
six items were summed, and the Cronbach's alpha
was .84. Initial analysis demonstrated income dif-
ferences between workers and retirees; therefore,
total household income (logged) was included as a
control. Differences in time spent on household
chores also may differ as a function of day of the
week (e.g., Manke et al., 1994). In this study, day
of the week was recoded into a contrast between
weekday (0) and weekend (1). Approximately,
76.11% of the telephone interviews occurred on a
weekday.
Data Analyses Plan
A set of two-level multilevel linear models (SAS
Proc Mixed), where days nested within persons,
examined the extent to which employment status
(worker vs. retiree) predicted time spent on daily
household chores. In the first set of multilevel
models, we assessed the main effects of employ-
ment status and life course influences (age, gender,
and marital status) on time spent on daily house-
hold chores. We then examined the two-way inter-
action effect of employment status and life course
influences (e.g., employment status and gender) on
time spent on daily household chores. In the sec-
ond set of analyses, we assessed the within-person
response between daily stressors and time spent on
daily household chores, as a function of employ-
ment status and life course influences. For these
analyses, we focused on daily stressors from the
previous day to predict time spent on daily house-
hold chores the following day. All continuous vari-
ables at Level 2 (between-person) were grand-mean
centered, and control variables were included in all
models.
Results
Table 2 presents the descriptive characteristics
of the stressful events by employment status.
Workers reported experiencing at least one daily
stressor on 28% of the study days, which was
comparable to the 27% reported by retirees.
Although workers and retirees did not differ in
their reporting of arguments or disagreements,
avoided arguments or tensions, home stressors,

network stressors, or other stressors, the two groups
differed with respect to discrimination events (p <
.05). Workers reported experiencing more discrim-
inating events than retirees on greater percentage
of the study days.
Prior to conducting our multilevel linear models,
we examined the distribution of time spent on
daily household chores. In our sample, time spent
on daily household chores was positively skewed.
On 3.6% of the study days (out of a possible 1,994
days), respondents reported time spent on daily
household chores two standard deviations (SD)
above the sample mean. In the effort to address
the positively skewed nature of chore estimates,
we utilized two methodological approaches. First,
we log-transformed time spent on daily household
chores. We also performed sensitivity analyses using
robust standard error (SE) estimation (empirical
option in SAS model statement). Results from our
multilevel linear models using log-transformed
chore scores as well as robust SE estimation did
not differ from our findings using the raw chore
scores. Thus, the results using raw chore scores are
presented.
In the first set of multilevel linear models, the
effects of employment status, age, gender, and
marital status on time spent on daily household
chores were examined. As presented in Table 3
(Model 1), there was a main effect of employment
status on time spent on daily household chores
with workers spending 27 min less on daily house-
hold chores than retirees (estimate = -0.446, SE =
0.185, p  .05). A main effect of gender also was
observed with women spending 52 min more on
daily household chores than men (estimate = 0.861,
SE = 0.168, p  .001).
We then examined the two-way interaction effect
of employment status and life course influences on
time spent on daily household chores (see Table 3,
Model 2). There was a significant employment

status and age interaction effect (estimate = 0.080,
SE = 0.031, p  .05) with younger (one SD below the
mean) workers reported performing the least amount
of time on daily household chores (1 hr 37 min)
and younger retirees reported spending the most
amount of time (2 hr 46 min).
Results showed a significant interaction effect of
employment status and gender (estimate = 1.094,
SE = 0.317, p  .001; see Figure 1) on time spent on
daily household chores. Working men spent the
least amount of time on daily household chores as
compared to working women and retirees, regard-
less of gender. Working men spent approximately
1 hr 13 min on daily household chores whereas
working women spent about 2 hr 37 min. In com-
parison to workers, the difference in time spent on
daily household chores between retired men (2 hr
22 min) and women (2 hr 40 min) was smaller.
There also was an interaction effect of employ-
ment and marital status on time spent on daily
household chores (estimate = 0.897, SE = 0.332,
p  .01; see Figure 2). Unmarried workers reported
fewer hours spent on daily household chores
(1 hr 38 min) than married workers (2 hr 11 min).
Among the retirees, marital status had less of an
influence on time spent on daily household chores.
Unmarried retirees reported approximately 2 hr 41
min on daily household chores; whereas married
retirees reported 2 hr 20 min.
In the second set of analyses, we examined
whether the associations between daily stressors
from the previous day and time spent on daily
household chores differed as a function of employ-
ment status and life course influences. In these
models, the dichotomous daily stressor effect
reflected the extent to which one's time spent on
daily household chores changed as a function of
whether individuals reported experiencing any
daily stressors the previous day. Any daily stressors
from the previous day, employment status, age,
gender, marital status, and their interactions, were
entered as predictors of time spent on daily house-
hold chores (see Table 4, Model 1). There was a
trend toward significance (estimate = 0.847, SE =
0.443, p = .07) for the association between any
daily stressors from the previous day and time
spent on daily household chores as a function of
employment and marital status. Contrary to pre-
diction, results showed that time spent on daily
household chores increased on days when one
reported experiencing at least one daily stressor as
compared to days when no stressors were reported.
Findings also revealed that unmarried workers
exhibited the least reactivity and unmarried retirees
exhibited the greatest reactivity to daily stressors
with respect to time spent on daily household
chores. In this set of analyses, daily stressor was an
index of any of the seven types of stressful events
(e.g., arguments or disagreements, avoided argu-
ments and tensions, home-related, discrimination)
experienced on a study day. In line with the work
of Clark-Plaskie, & Lachman (1999), who found
that the salience of stressor domains may vary
across adulthood, we were interested in whether a
specific stressor domain (e.g., arguments or dis-

association. We carried out a similar set of analyses
as previously for each type of stressful event. Results
showed a trend toward significance (estimate =
1.592, SE = 0.853, p = .06) for home stressor from the
previous day and time spent on daily household
chores as a function of employment and marital
status (see Table 4, Model 2). We observed that,

chores increased following days when individuals
reported at least one home stressor as compared to
days when no home stressors were reported.
Results showed that unmarried workers exhibited
the least reactivity to home stressors in time spent
on daily household chores; whereas, unmarried
retirees were the most reactive to home stressors.
Examination of the other types of stressful events
did not result in any trend or significant findings.
Discussion
The overall goal of this study was to examine
the effects of employment status and life course
influences (age, gender, and marital status) on
time spent on daily household chores. This study
extended prior retirement and housework litera-
ture by examining the influences of daily stress in
the associations between retirement and time spent
on daily household chores.
Findings from this study highlight the influence
of age in the association between employment sta-
tus and household chore participation. Especially
for younger workers, employment had a greater
influence on time spent on daily household chores
as compared to other groups. As hypothesized, our
sample of younger workers reported the least
amount of time spent on daily household chores.
We also found that younger retirees reported per-
forming the greatest amount of daily household
chores of all groups. These findings resonate with
the time availability theory (Blood & Wolfe, 1960)
such that younger workers may face greater time
demands; and therefore, must reduce their invest-
ment in daily household chores. In contrast, youn-
ger retirees, now with greater time flexibility and
availability due to retirement, may contribute
more to daily household chores. For older workers
and retirees, whose time spent on daily household
chores was more similar; employment had less of
an impact.
Results from this study reinforce the importance
of gender on household chore participation. In line
with past research that demonstrated women per-
form more of the housework than men (Bianchi
et al., 2000; Coltrane, 2000; Hochschild, 1989;
Lachance-Grzela & Bouchard, 2010), findings
from this study showed that working women spent
more than double the amount of time on daily
household chores than working men. Notably,
retirement does not offer women a reprieve from
daily household chores because both working and

retired women reported spending a similar amount
of time. Similar to past studies (e.g., Solomon et
al., 2004) our findings revealed that retired men
pick up more daily household responsibilities, per-
haps due to greater time availability of no longer
having to work. Although the retired women in
our study still performed more of the daily house-
hold chores, retired men were not far behind.
These findings suggest that gender disparity in
time spent on household chores may lessen in
retirement.
In this study, social embeddedness, as assessed
by marital status, was found to be an important
factor in shaping household chore participation.
Especially for unmarried workers, the combina-
tion of not having a partner to share the division
of labor and paid work may explain the least
amount of time allocated toward daily household
chores. Retirement, however, appears to offer
unmarried individuals more opportunities for
daily chore participation. In contrast, employ-
ment status seems to have less of an influence on
daily household chore participation for married
individuals because both married workers and
retirees reported a similar amount of time. It
could be that the day-to-day household responsi-
bilities of married individuals are more well
established and less changeable even in the face of
a retirement transition.
In the second part of this paper, we built upon
the stressor reactivity concept to include behavioral
reactivity to daily stressors by assessing whether
the associations between daily stressors and time
spent on daily household chores differed as a func-
tion of employment status and life course influences.
Contrary to expectation, workers and retirees'
time spent on daily household chores increased the
day after experiencing a stressful event. This find-
ing highlights the impacts and disruptions that
daily stressors have on one's life (Almeida, 2005;
Bolger et al., 1989) and illustrates how daily stress-
ors can pile up and result in behavioral reactions
even the day after experiencing the stressful events
(Lazarus, 1999; Zautra, 2003).
Our stressor reactivity findings also indicate
that the salience of stressor domains may operate
differently depending on individuals' resources
(Clark-Plaskie & Lachman, 1999). In our study,
we found that of the seven domains of stressful
events (e.g., arguments or disagreements, network
stressors), only home stressful events were associ-
ated with daily household chore participation at a
trend level. These findings highlight the differen-
tial effects that different types of stressors have
on daily experiences. For these analyses, we also
predicted that unmarried workers will be the
most reactive to daily stressors in household chore
participation; however, our prediction was not
supported. Instead, unmarried workers were the
least reactive. It could be that when faced with
stressful events at home, unmarried workers, who
may not have someone to share the daily home
responsibilities and whose time is more restricted
by employment, may be more likely to let next
day's household responsibilities slide than other
individuals. However, caution must be taken when
interpreting the findings given that the results were
at a trend level.
Collectively, these findings highlight the impor-
tance of life course influences in understanding the
opportunities and vulnerabilities that middle-aged
and older workers and retirees face in their daily
lives. These findings further illustrate that life tran-
sitions (e.g., retirement), and daily stressors are
embedded in layers of temporal and social contexts
that shape individual's behaviors. Our findings
also highlight the opportunity for future studies to
examine how life course influences, daily stress,
and daily household chore participation may shape,
or are shaped by, family dynamics and processes at
different parts of the life course (e.g., employment,
retirement). Through the better understanding of
family dynamics and processes in middle and old
age, we will be able to devise and advocate for
effective strategies and programs that will help
individuals and families to better balance daily
household responsibilities as well as to enhance
meaningful use of time. Our findings also point to
the need to examine individuals' coping strategies
in the face of stressful events. It also would be
important in subsequent studies to assess how pro-
tective factors (e.g., social support, psychological
well being) may influence individual's behavioral
reactivity to daily stressors.
Limitations and Strengths
One study limitation is that we did not have
information on reasons for employment. Although
we tried to account for potential push and pull fac-
tors that may differ between the workers and
retirees, we cannot completely rule out the factors
that may have contributed to the current employ-
ment situation. This study utilized a self-definition
of employment status, which is limited by the lack
of objective criteria in identifying whether one is

working or retired. However, perceptions often
influence behaviors (e.g., Ferguson & Bargh,
2004), and a self-assessment of employment status
may provide better insight to how individuals
think or behave. Future studies should consider
whether different conceptualization of retirement
results in similar findings. Spousal characteristics
(e.g., employment, gender attitudes) have been
linked to household performance (Szinovacz,
2000); however, the current study did not utilize
spousal data due to sample size and missing data
issues. This study focused on both married and
unmarried respondents to better understand and
represent the daily experiences of midlife and older
workers and retirees. Generalizability of the findings
must take into account that participants in this
study predominately were white. Given the role
of race and ethnicity in patterning employment
trajectories (Cummings & Jackson, 2008), we will
have the opportunity in subsequent studies to better
understand the daily lives of African Americans, for
there was an oversample of African Americans at
Wave 2 of MIDUS.
This study has several strengths. Rather than
asking respondents to recall the number of hours
in the past week that they spent doing household
tasks (e.g., Gupta, 1999; Szinovacz, 2000), respon-
dents in this study reported the amount of time
spent on household chores in the past 24 hr over 8
consecutive days. This methodological approach
helps to reduce bias between an experience and the
recall of the experience (Bolger, Davis, & Rafaeli,
2003). The use of daily diary methodology enabled
us to better capture the temporal order effects of
daily stressors on household chore participation
the following day. Although the DISE measure
allows for the examination of different stressor
domains (e.g., arguments, avoided arguments,
home related) experienced by the respondents, it
does not define the events that constitute each
domain of stressors. A limitation to this approach
is that the stressful event may differ between and
within (across days) individuals. However, this
approach is advantageous in capturing the events
that the respondents, not the researchers, perceived
as stressful. In contrast to other housework studies
(Solomon et al., 2004; Szinovacz, 1992), this cur-
rent study does not define specific activities that
constitute household chores. Although this meth-
odology may be less structured, this approach is
more informative in capturing the daily responsi-
bilities and tasks carried out by workers and
retirees.
Conclusion
In summary, the changing nature of work and
retirement in the United States points to the need to
examine how employment shapes daily experiences.
Importantly, findings from this study highlight the
need to pay greater attention to women, especially
those working, who are facing greater daily house-
hold responsibilities than other individuals. Our
study further contributes to the retirement and
time use literature by documenting the importance
of life course influences as well as stressors on daily
experiences.
