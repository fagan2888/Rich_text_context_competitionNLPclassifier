Abstract
Objective: To investigate whether circulating cell-free (cf)-DNA levels are a useful biomarker for
survival in patients with shock in the emergency intensive care unit (EICU).
Methods: This prospective observational study enrolled patients admitted to the EICU diagnosed
with shock. Blood cf-DNA levels were analysed on admission, and after 24 and 48 h. As a measure
of circulating cf-DNA, copy number of the b-globin gene in plasma was assessed using quantitative
real-time polymerase chain reaction.
Results: Circulating cf-DNA levels were higher at hospital admission and after 24 h in EICU
patients with shock who died than in those who recovered. Change in cf-DNA levels over the first
48 h in critical care was independently associated with 28-day mortality. The critical cut-off value
for cf-DNA change over 48 h in predicting 28-day mortality was þ16.12% (sensitivity 68.9%,
specificity 89.7%).
Conclusions: Increased circulating cf-DNA levels in EICU patients with shock are associated with
risk of death and measuring cf-DNA change over 48 h improves risk prediction. The present study
suggests that cf-DNA may serve as a viable plasma biomarker of mortality risk in EICU patients
with shock.

Introduction
One-third of patients admitted to the
intensive care unit (ICU) are in shock1 ­ a
life-threatening complicated state of acute
circulatory failure,2 associated with a high
mortality rate.3 In critically ill patients,
procalcitonin and C-reactive protein bio-
markers are used to identify infections.4
Intensive care scoring systems, such as
the Acute Physiology and Chronic Health
Evaluation II (APACHE II), have been
studied as clinical tools for assessing illness
severity and predicting outcome of ICU
patients.5­7 Despite the improvement in
prognosis afforded by these tools,5,7 there
is a need to develop biomarkers that can
help clinicians further improve risk predic-
tion for patients with shock in the emer-
gency (EICU), as only a few biomarkers for
assessing the severity of shock are validated
for routine use in clinical practice.3
Repeated risk assessment and close clinical
monitoring of patients with shock in the
EICU are vital for improving the chances of
patient survival. Pulse Index Continuous
Cardiac Output device parameters have been
used to assess the effectiveness of treatment
and to guide further treatment for patients
with shock.8,9 Assessment of serum lactate
concentrations early in the diagnostic process
is also recommended, to evaluate the severity
of the patient's condition, to observe the
effectiveness of treatment and for predicting
mortality risk due to shock.3,10 Circulating
cell-free (cf)-DNA may be a useful biomarker
of mortality risk in critically ill patients,11,12
and has been proposed as a novel diagnostic
and prognostic biomarker for various condi-
tions including sepsis,11,13 stroke,14 myocar-
dial infarction,15 cancer16 and trauma.17
The mechanisms of shock are compli-
cated, involving any of four pathophysiolo-
gic subtypes (hypovolemic, cardiogenic,
distributive and obstructive), and result in
circulatory failure.18 The subsequent inad-
equate oxygen utilization by cells results in
cellular dysfunction and eventually cell
necrosis, and is general in all patients with
shock.18 Degeneration of the cell nucleus has
been shown to release cf-DNA into the
circulation.19 Healthy subjects have low
levels of cf-DNA in plasma,20 which origin-
ates from phagocytes removing dead cell
debris.21 As cf-DNA levels have been pro-
posed as biomarkers of risk in critically ill
patients,11,12 the present authors hypothe-
sized that circulating cf-DNA levels would
be associated with risk of mortality in
patients with shock admitted to the EICU,
and may be used to improve risk prediction.
Thus, the objective of the present study was
to investigate whether measurement of cir-
culating cf-DNA levels could be a useful
biomarker of mortality risk in patients with
shock in the EICU.
Patients and methods
Study population
This prospective cohort study was con-
ducted in the EICU of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Anhui Medical University,
Hefei, China between June 2012 and April
2015. All patients aged ! 18 years, meeting
the criteria for shock on admission to the
EICU, diagnosed according to the definition
of the European Society of Intensive Care
Medicine consensus conference, 2014,3 were
enrolled. Exclusion criteria included patients
or patient's families who refused consent for
participation, patients with shock following
a surgical procedure, patients with terminal
malignant tumours, elderly patients (>80
years), and those with autoimmune diseases.
Age- and sex-matched controls were
recruited from the Physical Examination
Centre, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
Medical University between June 2012 and
August 2012. All patients in the EICU
received supportive treatment based on indi-
vidual need. An electronic chart was used to
record demographic data, prognosis, length
of EICU and hospital stay, clinical diagno-
sis, Karnofsky scores,22 skin condition
Xia et al. 1003
(degree of cutaneous perfusion), co-morbid-
ities, vital signs, APACHE II score at EICU
admission, any organ dysfunction, details of
any mechanical ventilation and/or continu-
ous renal replacement therapy, use of vaso-
pressors, enteral nutrition and laboratory
results (including lactate levels). All study
population data were retrieved from medical
records held at the First Affiliated Hospital
of Anhui Medical University. The primary
study endpoint was mortality at 28 days.
This study was approved by the Medical
Research Ethics Board of the First Affiliated
Hospital of Anhui Medical University and
written informed consent was provided by
each patient or their legal proxy.
Blood sampling
On admission to the EICU and after 24 and
48 h, 5 ml of whole blood was obtained from
each patient into EDTA-containing tubes
and kept on ice prior to transfer to the
Molecular Biology Department, Central
Laboratory of the First Affiliated Hospital
of Anhui Medical University. Blood samples
were then centrifuged at 16 000 g for 10 min
at 4C, plasma was aspirated carefully to
avoid residual cells and then immediately
stored at À80C to avoid DNA fragmenta-
tion.23 The same process was conducted for
control blood samples.
DNA was extracted using QIAampÕ
DNA Blood Mini Kits (QIAGEN GmbH,
Hilden, Germany) and eluted in a final
volume of 200 ml using QIAampÕ DNA
Blood Mini Kit buffer (pH 7), according to
the manufacturer's `blood and body fluid'
protocol. The DNA samples were stored at ­
80C prior to use in quantitative real-time
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays.
Quantification of circulating cf-DNA
Plasma cf-DNA was measured using a
SYBR Green dye-based quantitative real-
time PCR assay for the human b-globin
gene,24 a housekeeping gene.25 The forward
primer sequence was 50-GCA CCT GAC
TCC TGA GGA GAA-30 and the reverse
primer sequence was 50-CAC CAA CTT
CAT CCA CGT TCA-30.26 Each 20 ml reac-
tion mix contained 2 ml DNA, 10 ml SYBR
Premix Ex TaqTM II (TaKaRa, Dalian,
China), 0.8 ml forward primer (10 mmol/l),
0.8 ml reverse primer (10 mmol/l), 0.4 ml ROX
reference dye II (TaKaRa, Dalian and
China) and 6 ml distilled water. Human
genomic DNA (Roche Diagnostics GmbH,
Penzberg, Germany) of known concentra-
tion 100 ml/500 ml (2 Â 108 pg/ml) was serially
diluted (1:10) to prepare a standard curve
against which the patient cf-DNA could be
compared. The serially diluted DNA con-
centrations spanned 108 pg/ml to 103 pg/ml.
Standard curve and no DNA template con-
trol samples were included in each quanti-
tative PCR reaction. The PCR temperatures
used to detect cf-DNA were an initial 95C
for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of denatur-
ation at 95C for 5 s, annealing at 60C for
30 s and elongation at 58C for 30 s, slowly
warming to a final elongation of 95C for 5 s
(performed using an Agilent Technologies
Inc. thermocycler, Palo Alto, CA, USA).
The size of the PCR product was 95 bp.21
A conversion factor of 6.6 pg of DNA per
diploid cell was used. Results are expressed
as genome equivalents (GE) per ml (1 GE ¼
6.6 pg DNA).
Dissociation curve analysis showed a
single melting temperature of approximately
83.5C, indicating one specific product
was generated with the standard template
(Figure 1).
Statistical analyses
Continuous variables were analysed using
Student's t-test and Mann­Whitney U-test,
and are presented either as mean Æ SD or
median (interquartile range [IQR], 25th to
75th percentiles). Categorical variables were
analysed as percentages using 2-test or
1004 Journal of International Medical Research 44(5)
Fisher's exact test. Receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC)27 curves were drawn to
evaluate the discriminative power of lactate
levels 24 h following EICU admission,
APACHE II scores at admission, cf-DNA
levels at admission, cf-DNA levels 24 h
following admission and the change in cf-
DNA levels over 48 h in EICU to predict
28-day mortality. The area under the ROC
curve (AUC) was calculated for each ROC
curve, and reflects the value of the predictive
variable, as follows: AUC ¼ 0.5, the variable
has no predictive value; AUC ¼ 1.0, the
variable is fully predictive of the outcome;
AUC between 0.5 and 0.7, the variable has
some predictive value; AUC between 0.7
and 0.9, the variable has moderate predictive
value; and AUC > 0.9, the variable is pre-
dictive. The Youden index28 was defined as
the sum of the highest value of sensitivity
and specificity (sensitivityþ specificity-100%)
or the ROC-curve point at which both
sensitivity and specificity are maximal.
As cf-DNA levels were not normally
distributed, continuous levels were
dichotomized at the cut-off value for max-
imal sensitivity and specificity. Univariate
analysis using forward variable selection
was used to identify which variables were
independently associated with 28-day mor-
tality. All significant variables were then
tested in a multivariable logistic regression
model to investigate which variables were
independently associated with 28-day
mortality.
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SPSSÕ software, version 22.0
(SPSS; IBM Corp. Armonk, NY, USA).
A P-value < 0.05 was considered statistically
significant in all tests.
Results
Patient characteristics
Out of 173 patients with shock, 169 were
included in this study, 4 patients were
excluded due to missing plasma samples
(Table 1). In addition, 140 plasma samples
were collected 24 h after EICU admission,
and 124 plasma samples after 48 h.

In total, 81 of 169 patients (47.9%) died
within 28 days of EICU admission. In the
entire patient cohort, more patients pre-
sented with distributive shock than other
subtypes of shock. There were statistically
significant differences in total hospital length
of stay (P ¼ 0.004), and EICU length of stay
(P < 0.001) between 28-day survivors and
non-survivors of shock. Patients who died
within 28 days had higher mean APACHE II
scores on admission and higher median 24 h
lactate values compared with patients
who survived (both P < 0.001). The median
cf-DNA concentration in patient plasma
was significantly higher in non-survivors
than in survivors on admission to the
EICU, after 24 h and after 48 h in the
EICU (all P < 0.001). The median change
in cf-DNA levels during the first 48 h in
EICU was statistically different between
patients who died and those who survived
beyond 28 days (median À 26.06% [IQR
À2.56% ­ À50.96%] versus þ 37.93% [IQR
À1.07% ­ þ137.88%]; P < 0.001).
Out of a total of 30 healthy individuals
(one sample taken from each patient during
an examination at the Physical Examination
Centre, First Affiliated Hospital of Anhui
Medical University), the median cf-DNA
concentration was 1.68 Â 104 pg/ml (IQR
8.44 Â 103 pg/ml ­ 1.30 Â 105 pg/ml), and
was significantly lower than cf-DNA levels
in EICU patients with shock (P < 0.001).
Variables predictive of 28-day mortality
Predictions of EICU 28-day mortality were
made with ROC curve analyses (Figure 2
and Table 2). In patients with shock,
cf-DNA levels at admission and 24 h after
admission, as well as change in cf-DNA
levels over the initial 48 h in EICU, were
found to be significant predictors of death;
lactate levels at 24 h and APACHE II scores
Figure 2. Receiver operating characteristic curves comparing the power to predict 28-day mortality
between lactate levels 24 h after admission to the emergency intensive care unit (EICU), APACHE II score on
admission, cell-free (cf)-DNA concentration on admission to the EICU, after 24 h in the EICU, and after 48 h in
the EICU, and the change in cf-DNA concentration over the first 48 h of EICU admission in 169 patients ! 18
years of age admitted to the emergency intensive care unit with shock.
Xia et al. 1007
at admission had lower predictive values for
28-day mortality. The AUC of the ROC
curve analysis for the cf-DNA value at
admission for predicting death was 0.808
(95% confidence interval [CI] 0.719, 0.896;
P < 0.001). A cf-DNA value at admission of
6.35 Â 105 pg/ml predicted 28-day mortality
with a sensitivity of 82.2% and a specificity
of 68.4%. A cf-DNA value 24 h after admis-
sion of 3.26 Â 105 pg/ml was also predictive
of death during the 28-day follow-up, with a
sensitivity of 73.3%, a specificity of 77.6 and
an AUC of 0.830 (95% CI 0.753, 0.907;
P < 0.001). The AUC in the ROC curve
analysis for the cf-DNA change over the first
48 h in EICU for predicting death was 0.825
(95% CI 0.741, 0.09; P < 0.001). If the cf-
DNA concentration increased by 16.12% or
more during the first 48 h of EICU admis-
sion, the patient would likely die within 28
days. The sensitivity of this result was 68.9
and the specificity 89.7.
Multivariate logistic regression analysis
When all measured variables: 24 h lactate
levels, APACHE II scores on admission, cf-
DNA levels at admission, cf-DNA levels
after 24 h in EICU and cf-DNA change over
48 h, were analysed together in a multivari-
ate logistic regression analysis, only cf-DNA
change over 48 h was significant as predict-
ive of 28-day mortality (Table 3; odds ratio
4.232, 95% CI 1.547, 11.579; P ¼ 0.005).
Discussion
Accurate and convenient predictive tools for
repeated risk assessment and close monitor-
ing of critically ill patients are vitally import-
ant to a patient's chances of survival.29
Predictive biomarkers that can be object-
ively and rapidly measured and respond to
clinical recovery could add relevant, reliable,
real-time information for the care of patients
with shock. Studies have shown that critic-
ally ill patients who died had higher circulat-
ing cf-DNA levels compared with surviving
patients,11,13,27,30 and circulating cf-DNA
has been shown to independently predict
patients with severe sepsis and septic shock
in the ICU.31 Measurements of cf-DNA
levels in ICU patients with severe sepsis
was shown to be predictive of patient mor-
tality, with a very high AUC of 0.97 and
high levels of sensitivity (87%) and

specificity (93%).13 In addition, cf-DNA has
been shown to have a high prognostic value
to predict mortality in febrile patients.26 In
the current study, plasma cf-DNA concen-
tration at admission and 24 h after admis-
sion, cf-DNA change over the first 48 h of
EICU admission, and lactate levels and
APACHE II scores at admission, were
measured in critically ill EICU patients
with shock, and were found to have predict-
ive significance for 28-day mortality.
The present study showed that median
circulating cf-DNA concentrations in EICU
patients with shock were significantly higher
compared with healthy controls. Median
circulating cf-DNA concentrations on
EICU admission and after 24 h in the
EICU were significantly higher in patients
with shock whose outcome was fatal within
28 days compared with those who survived.
The main finding of the present study was
that change in cf-DNA concentration over
the first 48 h of critical care treatment was an
accurate mortality predictor in intensively-
treated patients with shock. This finding was
independent of the initial severity assess-
ment, including cf-DNA levels on admis-
sion, lactate levels and APACHE II scores.
Other variables, including 24 h lactate levels,
APACHE II scores, cf-DNA concentration
on admission and cf-DNA concentration
24 h after admission were more dependent
on the underlying diseases or other
confounders, and when accounted for in
multivariate logistic regression analysis,
they were not found to be predictive of
28-day mortality, despite the results of the
initial analysis.
The present data suggest that high circu-
lating cf-DNA concentrations in patients
with shock are dynamic changes reflecting
the change of the patients' condition. Close
monitoring of plasma cf-DNA levels of
patients with shock in the first 48 h of
EICU care would provide information to
help decisions about whether the patient
could be released from EICU care to a
general ward or whether they should con-
tinue to receive treatment escalation. The
patient population of the present study was
stratified according to whether the cf-DNA
concentration change over 48 h was
>16.12%, as a change of this size may help
identify individuals at high risk of mortality
and who would benefit by continuing to
receive intensive treatment. Patients with a
cf-DNA concentration change over
48 h 16.12% were found to be at reduced
mortality risk and, therefore, would be good
early EICU discharge candidates, freeing
beds to accept other critically ill patients.
Accurate stratification of EICU patients
with shock is a prerequisite for therapeutic
options to lighten the financial burden of
patients, improve patient satisfaction and
reduce the expense of medical treatment.29

Accurate risk assessment and close clinical
monitoring of disease severity would pro-
vide accurate clinical course prediction, and
assists in setting realistic expectations
regarding the illness.
Previous studies have used circulating cf-
DNA as a biomarker to investigate patients
with circulation issues,11­13,26,31­36 however,
these studies only explored the connection
between cf-DNA levels and patient out-
comes, and obtained an optimal cf-DNA
concentration level. The present study is the
first to research and demonstrate a signifi-
cant association between cf-DNA concen-
tration change over 48 h and outcome
among EICU patients with shock.
The present work has several limitations:
First, the mechanism for removing cf-DNA
in vivo is unclear,37 although investigations
using experimental models suggest that the
liver is a major site for metabolizing plasma
nucleic acids;38 Secondly, levels of plasma
nucleic acids may be influenced by patient
age and underlying diseases, and mechanical
ventilation and vasoactive agents increase
the circulating level of DNA;33 Thirdly, the
present study enrolled only 4 patients with
obstructive shock, which precluded explor-
ation of cf-DNA levels between each shock
sub-group; Fourthly, confounders, such as
the duration of shock before EICU entry,
were difficult to control for and the study
sample was too small to adjust for multiple
confounders. The present study is also
limited by only using a single centre for
sample collection. The present results, there-
fore, need additional prospective validation
in a multicentre study with a larger patient
population.
In summary, circulating cf-DNA concen-
trations in EICU patients with shock were
significantly higher than in healthy controls.
Circulating cf-DNA concentrations at
EICU admission and after 24 h were signifi-
cantly higher in patients with shock who
died than in those who survived at least 28
days. Lactate levels at 24 h and APACHE II
scores at EICU admission had lower pre-
dictive values for 28-day mortality than cf-
DNA concentrations. The most accurate
predictor of fatal outcome for a patient in
the EICU with shock was cf-DNA change
over the first 48 h of critical care. The cut-off
value for cf-DNA change over 48 h found in
the present study may help physicians in
deciding which patients with shock should
continue with escalating treatment and
which can be discharged from the EICU.
