Parental reporting of height and weight was evaluated for US children aged 2­13 years. The prevalence of
obesity (defined as a body mass index value (calculated as weight (kg)/height (m)2) in the 95th percentile or
higher) and its height and weight components were compared in child supplements of 2 nationally representative
surveys: the 1996­2008 Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort (NLSY79-Child) and
the 1997 Child Development Supplement of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID-CDS). Sociodemo-
graphic differences in parent reporting error were analyzed. Error was largest for children aged 2­5 years. Under-
reporting of height, not overreporting of weight, generated a strong upward bias in obesity prevalence at those
ages. Frequencies of parent-reported heights below the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (Atlanta,
Georgia) first percentile were implausibly high at 16.5% (95% confidence interval (CI): 14.3, 19.0) in the NLSY79-
Child and 20.6% (95% CI: 16.0, 26.3) in the PSID-CDS. They were highest among low-income children at 33.2%
(95% CI: 22.4, 46.1) in the PSID-CDS and 26.2% (95% CI: 20.2, 33.2) in the NLSY79-Child. Bias in the reporting
of obesity decreased with children's age and reversed direction at ages 12­13 years. Underreporting of weight
increased with age, and underreporting of height decreased with age. We recommend caution to researchers who
use parent-reported heights, especially for very young children, and offer practical solutions for survey data collec-
tion and research on child obesity.

The recommended method for surveillance and routine
clinical assessment of child overweight and obesity is to cal-
culate body mass index (BMI) (weight (kg)/height (m)2)
from height and weight measured by trained personnel (1­6).
However, for reasons of cost and practicality, survey data with
parent-reported or self-reported heights and weights are often
used (7­12). Considerable skepticism has been expressed by
researchers and health professionals about the accuracy of
parent-reported data and the validity of findings drawn from
surveys in which children's heights and weights are parent
reported (8, 13­18).
Studies evaluating the quality of parent-reported data (7, 8,
13­23) have been inconsistent as to the magnitude and direc-
tion of error in parent-reported weight, height, and calculated
BMI (5). Differences in error by gender (7, 13, 14, 16­18,
23), race/ethnicity (7, 18, 23), and socioeconomic status (13,
14, 16) have been similarly inconsistent. Most samples are
from non-US populations in which metric rather than imperial
measurement systems are used (14­17, 19, 20) or are conve-
nience samples of US children (18, 21­23). Because obesity
is defined as a BMI value at or above a high threshold point,
for example, the 95th percentile according to the Centers for

Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) (Atlanta, Georgia)
(1­4), estimates of obesity prevalence are sensitive to error in
extreme values of height and weight, especially to very high
weight or very low height. This possibility is recognized in
theCDCandWorldHealthOrganizationprotocolsforidentify-
ing "biologically implausible" values of height or weight (24).
Parental overreporting of extreme values of height or weight
has been attributed to digit preference, rounding, and failing
to keep pace with children's rapid growth, especially at the
youngest ages (8). Parental underreporting of extreme values
has also been observed, with parents of heavy children under-
reporting weight and parents of light children overreporting
weight (13­15, 19, 21, 23). This latter type of reporting error
can be interpreted either as simple regression to the mean (25)
or as arising from social desirability bias (23, 26­29).
Because increases in weight have driven the obesity epi-
demic, it is unsurprising that studies have tended to empha-
size misreporting of weight rather than height (30, 31). At
least equal attention to height misreporting, however, is
merited, because height errors are compounded by the squar-
ing of height in the denominator of BMI calculations (7, 8).
In this study, we examined error in parental reporting of chil-
dren's heights and weights as sources of bias in nationally
representative survey estimates of childhood obesity in US
children aged 2­13 years. Our analyses investigated misre-
porting of extreme values of height and weight and identified
sociodemographic differentials in misreporting.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data
The Children of the National Longitudinal Survey of
Youth 1979 Cohort (NLSY79-Child) is an ongoing survey
with biennial assessments of height and weight for all chil-
dren born to women followed in the National Longitudinal
Survey of Youth 1979 Cohort (NLSY79). The NLSY79
comprises a nationally representative sample of men and
women who were aged 14­21 years in 1979 and includes an
oversample of non-Hispanic black and non-Hispanic white
economically disadvantaged households. NLSY79 subjects
were surveyed annually through 1994 with retention rates
above 90% and have been surveyed biennially since 1994
with retention rates of 80%­90% (32). Children of women
followed in the NLSY79 are eligible for inclusion in the
NLSY79-Child if they are younger than 15 years of age,
their mothers were assessed in the corresponding NLSY79
wave, they resided at least part-time with their mothers, and
their mothers provided informed consent. The proportion of
eligible children who were either directly assessed or whose
mothers were interviewed each year ranged from a low of
77% in 2000 (a single year when, for budgetary reasons, the
NLSY79 oversamples of blacks and Hispanics were not
interviewed) to a high of 96% in 1996 (33). There were
6,373 children observed in the 1996­2008 survey waves at
ages 2­13 years (20,206 person-years), from which we
excluded observations in which children reported their own
heights and/or weights (5%) or in which heights and/or
weights were not assessed (3%).
A second nationally representative panel survey, the Panel
Study of Income Dynamics, included a Child Development
Supplement (PSID-Child) in 1997, which included a combi-
nation of parent-reported and measured data on children's
heights and weights. Since 1968, the Panel Study of Income
Dynamics has followed a nationally representative sample
of US households, including a low-income oversample. All
new households formed by children and other family mem-
bers descended from the original 1968 households are fol-
lowed, and an immigrant "refresher" subsample was added
in 1997. Wave-to-wave retention rates have ranged from 92%
to 98% following the initial 1968 and 1969 response and
retention rates of 76% and 81%, respectively (34). The PSID-
CDS was administered to primary caregivers of up to 2 ran-
domlyselected children aged 0­13 years from the Panel Study
of Income Dynamics core and immigrant refresher samples
with a response rate of 88% (35). There were 3,113 children
aged 2­13 years in the PSID-CDS; from these, we excluded
observations for which height and/or weight was not assessed
(10%). Both the PSID-CDS and the NLSY79-Child analyti-
cal samples were found to be statistically indistinguishable
fromthetotalsampleswithoutexceptionsonthevariablesused
in this study (Web Table 1 available at http://aje.oxfordjour
nals.org/).
Assessment of height and weight. In both the NLSY79-
Child and the PSID-CDS, height was recorded in feet (1
foot = 30 cm) and inches (1 inch = 2.54 cm), and weight was
recorded in pounds (1 pound = 0.45 kg) and ounces (1
ounce = 28 g). At each survey wave of the NLSY79-Child, a
trained interviewer or the mother measured each child's
height and weight unless the mother did not consent to either
measurement or the interview was conducted by telephone, in
which case height and/or weight was mother reported. Mea-
surements were taken in the child's own clothes, after remov-
ing shoes and coats, by using a portable scale and a tape
measure. Survey data "flags" identify whether height and
weight were parent reported or measured. Additionally, in the
2006 and 2008 waves of the NLSY79-Child, a subset of chil-
dren had both mother-reported and measured heights and
weights in a given survey wave.
In the PSID-CDS, weight was reported in all cases by the
primary caregivers, 92% of whom were the biological mothers.
Any primary caregiver who did not know the child's weight
was asked to provide an estimate and report when the child
was last weighed. Child height was measured by a trained
interviewer unless the interview was conducted by telephone,
the child was not present, or the primary caregiver did not
consent. Unfortunately, no flags are provided with the data to
distinguish parent-reported from measured heights or to dis-
tinguish whether an interview was conducted in person or by
telephone. However, we were able to develop a proxy flag for
whether the child was a "nonrespondent" on the in-person
child assessment for children aged 3­12 years, thereby identi-
fying children whose primary caregivers were interviewed by
telephone or who were otherwise not present for assessment;
thus, these children could not have had interviewer-measured
heights.
Sociodemographic assessment. In the NLSY79-Child
and the PSID-CDS, each child's gender and age and the
mother's age at the child's birth were reported or calculated
462 Weden et al.
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(3):461­473
from the month and year of birthdates and interviews. In the
NLSY79-Child, race/ethnicity data came from the mother's
NLSY79 report of the racial/ethnic origins (chosen from 30
categories) with which she most closely identified. Total fam-
ily income data in US dollars were constructed by the data
producer by using a series of questions in each NLSY79 wave.
In the PSID-CDS, children's races/ethnicities were reported
by the primary caregivers (as white non-Hispanic, black non-
Hispanic, Hispanic, Asian or Pacific Islander, American Indian
or Alaskan Native, or "other"). The data producer constructed
total family income datafrom a series of questions and imputed
item nonresponse. We harmonized NLSY79-Child and PSID-
CDS racial/ethnic origins by using US Census categories
(36) and adjusted family income for inflation to year-2000
dollars (37).
Because of sample design differences between the NLSY79-
Child (Table 1) and the PSID-CDS (Table 2), and because
children in the surveys were not randomly selected into mea-
sured versus parent-reported height and weight assessments,
we compared the sociodemographic characteristics of the chil-
dren in each survey overall and by assessment protocol. The
PSID-CDS was designed to be representative of US children
in 1997, whereas our NLSY79-Child sample was representa-
tive of children aged 2­13 years in 1996­2008 who were born
to women residing in the United States at ages 14­21 years
in 1979. The latter restriction of the NLSY79-Child sample
meant that this sample had older mothers and higher family
incomes than did our PSID-CDS sample and was less repre-
sentative of Hispanic children (notably because of the exclu-
sion of children born to mothers who immigrated after 1979).
These differences were still more pronounced for our 2006
and 2008 subsample of the NLSY79-Child.
In the NLSY79-Child, the measured and parent-reported
subsamples differed significantly on the mean age of the
mother at the child's birth and on the distribution of the sub-
samples by race/ethnicity and family income. Children with
measured weights in the NLSY79-Child were more likely
thanchildrenwithparent-reportedweightstohaveoldermoth-
ers, non-Hispanic black mothers, and mothers with lower
family incomes. The latter 2 socioeconomic characteristics
are associated with lower rates of obesity (38­40). In the
PSID-CDS, there were no statistically significant differences
between the entirely parent-reported and measured height
subsamples on gender, mother's age, or family income. Sub-
jects in the parent-reported subsample, however, were more
likely to be Hispanic and less likely to be non-Hispanic black.
Hispanic and black races/ethnicities are associated with higher
rates of obesity (30, 41).
Analyses
Children were categorized into percentiles of height-for-
age, weight-for-age, and BMI-for-age on the basis of gender
and age (in months) by using an SAS program (SAS Insti-
tute, Inc., Cary, North Carolina) from the CDC that uses the
2000 CDC growth charts (24, 42). We excluded a small
number of observations in the NLSY79-Child (n = 20) and
the PSID-CDS (n = 2) with BMI values outside the range of
this program. A BMI-for-age at or above the 95th percentile
was classified as "obese" (2). The panel surveys were divided
into age groups for which there was sufficient sample size to
distinguish between measured and parent-reported heights
and weights: ages 2­5, 6­8, 9­11, and 12­13 years in the
NLSY79-Child and ages 2­5 and 6­13 years in the PSID-
CDS (Table 3). Obesity prevalence was compared between
respective survey subsamples, and percentile-by-percentile
comparisons of children above or below each of the top or
bottom 20 percentiles of weight-for-age and height-for-age
were conducted. For the subset of NLSY79-Child observa-
tions with both measured and parent-reported heights and
weights, mean differences between the measured and parent-
reported data for a given assessment of BMI, height, and
weight were calculated. Analyses were also conducted by strat-
ifying by gender, race/ethnicity, and family income. For these
analyses, observations with item nonresponse on the analyzed
characteristic (Tables 1 and 2) were excluded.
All analyses used survey weights and adjusted for cluster-
ing of children in families in the NLSY79-Child and the
PSID-CDS by using the survey (svy) prefix commands in
Stata, version 11, software (StataCorp LP, College Station,
Texas). We report 95% confidence intervals for proportions
and adjusted Pearson 2 statistics for tests of differences in
proportions. Analyses were determined to be exempt from
human subject review by the RAND Corporation's Human
Subjects Protection Committee (Santa Monica, California).
RESULTS
Obesity prevalence in the exclusively measured sample of
the NLSY79-Child was 13.8% (95% confidence interval
(CI): 12.1, 15.8) at ages 2­5 years and 15.5% (95% CI: 14.3,
16.8) at ages 6­13 years (Table 3). In contrast, obesity prev-
alence at ages 2­5 years was 2.5­3 times higher at 32.3%
(95% CI: 29.3, 35.6) in the NLSY79-Child and 36.6% (95%
CI: 30.9, 42.7) in the PSID-CDS subsamples with parent-
reported weights and heights and nearly 2 times higher at
25.3% (95% CI: 17.2, 35.5) in the NLSY79-Child subsample
with measured weights and parent-reported heights. At ages
6­13 years, there was a similar pattern of higher obesity prev-
alence in the subsamples with parent-reported heights.
However, additional age breakdowns that were possible for
children in the NLSY79-Child with either exclusively mea-
sured or exclusively parent-reported data showed that the
obesity prevalence in the exclusively parent-reported sub-
sample was significantly higher only at ages 6­8 years; there
were no significant differences in prevalence at ages 9­11
years, and prevalence was significantly lower at ages 12­13
years in the exclusively parent-reported subsample compared
with the exclusively measured subsample.
For children aged 2­5 years, a pattern of parents overre-
porting weight and/or underreporting height could have pro-
duced the higher rates of obesity observed in the reported
compared with the measured subsamples. To assess these
possibilities, we compared the measured versus the parent-
reported proportions in both studies of children who were in
the 20 highest percentiles of weight-for-age (Web Figure 1)
and the 20 lowest percentiles of height-for-age (Web
Figure 2). The percentages of children with height below the
first percentile were implausibly high at 16.5% (95% CI: 14.3,
19.0) in the parent-reported subsamples of the NLSY79-Child

and 20.6% (95% CI: 16.0, 26.3) in the PSID-CDS compared
with the respective measured heights below the first percentile
of 3.4% (95% CI: 2.7, 4.3) in the NLSY79-Child and 5.5%
(95% CI: 3.6, 8.2) in the PSID-CDS subsamples (Figure 1). In
the 1999­2008 National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (43), only 0.8% of all children aged 2­5 years fell
below the first height percentile (results not shown). Finally,
the 20 highest weight proportions were statistically indistin-
guishable between measured and parent-reported weights in
the NLSY79-Child, differing at most by only 1.3% in the 99th
percentile (Web Figure 1, Figure 2).
Tabulations of the percentage of children aged 2­5 years
with height below the first percentile by sociodemographic
characteristics (Table 4) suggest that misreporting was espe-
cially high for economically disadvantaged children. In both
the NLSY79-Child and the PSID-CDS, there was a statisti-
cally significant association between family income and
height below the first percentile in the parent-reported subsam-
ples that was not observed in the respective measured subsam-
ples. In the parent-reported subsamples, height below the first
percentile among children with family income below $25,000
was nearly 2­3 times more common than for children with
family income of at least $75,000. Gender differences in height
below the first percentile were mixed across the subsamples and
surveys and were never statistically significant. Differences
by race/ethnicity were also mixed, with significant racial/
ethnic differences in height below the first percentile in both
the NLSY79-Child parent-reported and measured samples,
but only in the parent-reported sample of the PSID-CDS.
We next addressed the sample of children aged 12­13
years in the NLSY79-Child, in which rates of obesity were
lower in the exclusively parent-reported subsample than the
exclusively measured subsample. Lower rates in the parent-
reported compared with the measured subsample could have
been produced by parents underreporting weight and/or
overreporting height. When considering the 20 highest per-
centiles of weight (Web Figure 3) and height (Web Figure 4),
we found that parents both underreported the heaviest weights
andoverreportedthetallestheights.Thepercentageofchildren
with parent-reported weight above the 99th percentile was
4.6% (95% CI: 3.5, 5.9), which was significantly lower than
the measured percentage of 7.0% (95% CI: 5.8, 8.3) (Figure 3).
Similarly, the percentage of children with parent-reported
height above the 99th percentile was 4.3% (95% CI: 3.2,
5.7), which was significantly higher than the measured per-
centage of 2.7% (95% CI: 2.1, 3.5) (Figure 4).

The sociodemographic pattern of weight above the 99th
percentile was similar in the parent-reported and measured
subsamples of children aged 12­13 years, with statistically
significant differences by gender, race/ethnicity, and family
income irrespective of weight assessment (Web Table 2). For
height above the 99th percentile, the sociodemographic pat-
terns were largely similar or not statistically significant in the
parent-reported and measured subsamples (Web Table 3).
The subsample of the 2006 and 2008 waves of the NLSY79-
Child with both parent-reported and measured weights and
heights in the same wave had too few children aged 2­5
years for separate analysis. For children aged 2­8 years,
however, parent-reported height was, on average, 2.1 inches
lower than measured height at the same assessment and 1.6
inches and 1.1 inches lower for children aged 9­11 and 12­
13 years, respectively (Table 5). In contrast, differences
between parent-reported and measured weights widened
with increasing child age from an average of 35.5 ounces
lower at ages 2­8 years to 136.2 ounces lower at ages 12­13
years.

Parent Reporting Error on Child Height and Weight 469
Am J Epidemiol. 2013;178(3):461­473
The differences between parent-reported and measured
heights and weights in the 2006 and 2008 waves of the
NLSY79-Child (with both parent-reported and measured
weights and heights in the same wave) reinforced both the
direction and age pattern of the results previously described.
Results for extreme height and weight values among the youn-
gest children in this subsamplewere comparable to those for the
full NLSY79-Child sample with misreporting on extremely
low heights predominating, especially among the lowest-
income children. In the 2006 and 2008 waves of the NLSY79-
Child (with both parent-reported and measured weights and
heights in the same wave), 28.1% (95% CI: 22.5, 34.5) of
children aged 2­8 years had mother-reported heights below
the fifth percentile compared with only 5.4% (95% CI: 3.2,
9.1) when using the measured heights (Table 6). In compari-
son, the prevalence of extremely high weight was 11.6% (95%
CI: 8.1, 16.4) when weights were mother reported and 12.2%
(95% CI: 8.5, 17.2) when weights were measured (data not
shown). Also, as observed in the full NLSY79-Child sample,
the prevalence of extremely low heights was significantly asso-
ciated with family income when using mother-reported heights
but not when using measured heights (Table 6). When using
mother-reported heights, we found that 57.1% (95% CI: 38.4,
74.0) of the children with family incomes below $25,000 had
heights below the fifth percentile.
Consistent with the results from the full NLSY79-Child
sample, the subsample of the 2006 and 2008 waves (with
both parent-reported and measured weights and heights in
the same wave) showed fewer extremely high mother-
reported weights than measured weights for children aged
12­13 years. For this age group, the prevalence of mother-
reported weight above the 95th percentile was 11.8% (95%
CI: 8.5, 16.2), whereas the respective measured prevalence
was 15.9% (95% CI: 12.0, 20.7) (data not shown). In con-
trast to the full NLSY79-Child sample, however, the preva-
lence of extremely high heights in the subsample was 12.8%
(95% CI: 9.1, 17.9) when heights were mother reported and
13.4% when weights were measured (95% CI: 9.8, 18.1)
(results not shown). For both weight and height, the patterns
of sociodemographic differences in extreme values were
similar, irrespective of whether the mother-reported or mea-
sured data were used (results not shown).
DISCUSSION
Previous studies that used nationally representative sam-
ples of US children with parent-reported weights and heights
found that obesity prevalence for children aged 2­3 years
was overestimated by a factor of 5­10 (7, 8) and that this bias
diminished rapidly with increasing age, reversing to under-
estimating obesity prevalence after ages 12­13 years (7). Our
findings provide new empirical evidence supporting both of
these findings. On the basis of larger observed differences in
mean height than in mean weight between the parent-reported
versus the measured samples, both of these earlier studies
speculated that height underreporting rather than weight over-
reporting accounted for the overestimation of obesity at young
ages (7, 8). Our study provides strong evidence supporting this
speculation. We found that implausibly large proportions of the
parents of young children reported extremely low heights but
not extremely high weights. Not only is recall error regarding
height compounded by its being squared in the calculation
of BMI, but our study and others (7, 8, 13, 14) found that
parents are more likely to track children's weight than height
accurately at these ages. In addition, our findings indicated
that underestimation of obesity prevalence from parental
reporting on older children arose from their underreporting
very high weights. As in several of the preceding studies (7,
8, 13, 17, 18), in our study we observed that the underreport-
ing of height decreases with age, whereas the underreporting
of weight increases with age. The greater underreporting of
weight that we observed among parents of the heaviest older
children has previously been attributed both to social desir-
ability bias and to actual misperceptions (23, 27­29).
As in the only previous nationally representative US study
considering parental reporting bias and child gender (7), in

our study we observed no gender differences in height or
weight misreporting for young children. Our null findings
neither refuted nor supported previous findings that parents
were more likely to underreport girls' weights at older ages
(7, 17, 18). We observed null and mixed findings on race/
ethnicity, as have other authors (7, 18). However, ours is the
first study to provide evidence on parental reporting bias by
family income for the full US child population from a
nationally representative sample. We found that the lowest-
income parents of young children were consistently the most
likely to report extremely low child heights, whereas no con-
sistent pattern by income emerged across our 2 surveys when
children's heights were measured by survey staff. Our find-
ings on income extend those for Mexican-American children
in the Hispanic Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, in
which underreporting of height was greater among economi-
cally disadvantaged mothersthan among advantaged mothers
of young children (13). We speculate that for low-income
parents, reduced access to and utilization of health care (44­
46), including child well-visits, in which height and weight
are routinely assessed (46), may exacerbate parents' difficul-
ties keeping up with children's height gains.
We are less confident of the generalizability of our findings
beyond the United States. Most previous studies on parental
reporting of child height and weight were conducted in
Canada or Western Europe (14­17, 19). A number of these
studies found greater misreporting of weight than height
(15, 16). Moreover, error in reporting of height was nearly
evenly balanced among accurate reporting (15, 16), overre-
porting (14), and underreporting (17, 19). We speculate that
the use of the metric system in those countries may lead to
different types of recall error.
Several limitations of our study warrant discussion. Our
data come from child supplements of 2 nationally represen-
tative surveys of adults. However, only the PSID-CDS con-
ducted supplementary sampling of more recently arrived
immigrant families. This, and the overall older age of mothers
in the NLSY79-Child, may explain why we saw racial/ethnic
differences in the underreporting of young children's heights
in the PSID-CDS but not in the NLSY79-Child. On the other
hand, in the PSID-CDS and in the majority of the NLSY79-
Child sample, children were not randomly selected by having
parent-reported data or measured data. The consistency of our
key findings when using the PSID-CDS, the NLSY79-Child,
and the subsample of the 2006 and 2008 waves of the NLSY79-
Child (with both parent-reported and measured data in the same
wave) strengthens our confidence about the conclusions of this
study.
Our results lead us to caution researchers especially against
using parent-reported data on height for very young children
and to note that by approximately ages 9­11 years, parent-
reported data become reasonably accurate. One practical
solution for child obesity researchers who have only parent-
reported data available on young children is to consider ana-
lyzing weight-for-age, which is generally accurately reported.
To survey data producers, we suggest that in cases in which
child measurement is practically or financially impossible,
survey collection efforts should focus on improving the qual-
ityof height assessments more than that of weight assessments.
For example, 1 recent study (20) reported that the authors were
