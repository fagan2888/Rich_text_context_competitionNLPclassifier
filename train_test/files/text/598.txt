Remittance Received by Households of
Western Chitwan Valley, Nepal: Does
Migrant's Destination Make a Difference?
Prem Bhandari
Abstract
Studies on migration in Nepal primarily focused on the causes of
migration, in general. While a few studies examined the remittances
received or sent by migrants, there is little information about the
variation in remittances received by households by migrant's
destination. Thus, this exploratory study attempts to answer: Does
the extent to which households receive remittances vary by migrant's
destination? Using the data collected in 2013 from the western
Chitwan Valley of Nepal, the findings from multivariate analysis
reveal that net of controls, both the receipt (whether a household
received any remittance or not) as well as the amount of remittances
received by a household varied by migrant's destination. Evidence
suggests that households are less likely to receive remittances from
migrants working in India (a country of low earning potential) as
compared to those working in Nepal. On the other hand, households
received significantly more amount of remittances from migrants
working in countries with high earning potentials (such as Middle
East, East or South East Asia, and America, Australia and Europe)
as compared to the domestic migrants who were working inside of
Nepal but outside of Chitwan. Adjusting for other factors, the largest
amount of remittances was received from migrants working in the
East or South East Asian countries (e.g. South Korea, Malaysia,
Japan) followed by those in America, Australia, and Europe and the
Middle East. The insights gained from this exploratory study are
discussed.

Introduction
This exploratory study examines the remittances received by
households from migrant members of remittance dependent
households of Nepal with particular focus in the clusters of Chitwan
district. Here, the remittance receipt is defined as the money, goods
or gifts received by a household from domestic migrants working
outside of Chitwan in Nepal or abroad.
Previous migration research in Nepal primarily focused on the
causes of out-migration, in general (Bhandari, 2004, Bhandari &
Ghimire, 2016; Bohora-Mishra, 2013; Bohora-Mishra & Massey,
2009; 2011; Gurung, 2012; Massey et al., 2010; Massey, Axinn &
Ghimire, 2010; Piotrowski, 2013; Piotrowski et al., 2013; Shrestha
& Bhandari, 2007; Williams, 2009; 2013). Kern & Muller-Boker
(2015) provide a detailed description of the process and the role of
recruitment agencies on Nepali migration. Gurung (2012) examined
the role social exclusion plays on destination specific out-migration
of individuals in Nepal. A few studies provided valuable descriptive
information on migrants and remittances (Adhikari, 2001; Central
Bureau of Statistics, 2011; Hoermann & Kollmair, 2009; Pant,
2008; Seddon, Adhikari & Gurung, 2002; Sharma & Gurung, 2009;
Seddon, Gurung & Adhikari 1998; Thieme & Wyss, 2005; Williams
et al., 2012).
Of particular interest to this study, Thieme and Wyss (2005) explored
migration patterns and remittances transfer using data from a rural
setting of western Nepal. Specifically, they revealed that there are
specific ways of organizing migration for various destinations. These
country specific ways of organizing migration demand specific
assets from prospective migrants and their household members
and, therefore, influence their choice of destination. In addition,
Thieme and Wyss (2005) also provide information on organization
of destination specific migration by Nepali migrants and the
process of transfer of remittances back home. Williams et al. (2012)
provide insights into the lives, work, values, beliefs, behaviors and
intentions of Nepali migrants living in the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) countries. Particular to remittances, Williams et al. (2012)
examine the factors contributing to the remittances transferred by
migrants to their residence in Nepal. In addition, Seddon, Gurung
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |3
and Adhikari (1998), using the 1996 Nepal Living Standard Survey
data provide descriptive insights on destination specific migration
and the remittances sent by migrants to Nepal. Although Williams
et al. (2012) and Seddon et al. (1998) reported that the amount of
remittances varied by migrant's destination, these studies do not
provide information on remittances received by households. It is
believed that the amount of remittances sent by migrants and the
amount received by a household may vary. Because migrants may
send remittances to different people living in multiple places e.g.
parents, in-laws, spouse, children and others, the amount reported
by a migrant and a household thus could vary. Bhandari and
Chaudhary (2015) explored remittance receipt and remittance use
and examined the uses of remittances in various socio-economic and
cultural dimensions of household activities in a western Chitwan
valley of Nepal. While these studies make important contributions
to the field of migration and remittance research, yet, studies those
examine destination specific remittances received by households is
an important research gap in Nepal.

literature by investigating two important research questions:Whether
or not a household's receipt of remittances does vary by migrant's
destination? If it does vary, does the extent to which the amount of
remittances is received vary by destinations? This study affords to
answer the questions by using the remittance receipt data collected
in 2013 from the western Chitwan Valley - a remittance dependent
setting of rural Nepal. This exploratory study collected information
on migrant destinations, the amount of remittances received from
each migrant and migrants' characteristics.
Migration and Remittances in Nepal
Nepal has a long history of migration. Nepal was once the melting
pot of Indo-Aryan ancestry origin migrants from the South and
Mongolian origin Tibeto-Burmese from the North. The country
experienced a rapid growth in internal migration during 1950s when
the Nepali government opened the Tarai region (southern plain) for
settlement by clearing the dense forest. This Gangetic plain also
termed as `the granary of the country' is highly fertile and suitable
for agriculture. Since then the internal migration tremendously
4| Prem Bhandari
increased especially from the hills and mountains (Gurung, 1998).
Now, the country has turned into one of the major migrant sending
areas.
In Nepal, international labor migration formally began in 1815
AD with the recruitment of Nepali youth in The British Brigade of
Gurkha--units of the British Army that were composed of Nepalese
soldiers (Gurung, 1983; Rathaur, 2001; Thieme, Susan & Wyss,
2005). However, this was not a viable option until recently. In 1989,
the Nepali government promulgated the Foreign Employment Act to
destinations other than India. This Act licensed non-governmental
institutions to export Nepali workers abroad and legitimized certain
labor contracting organizations. This exploded large streams of
international migration outside of India (Kollmair et al., 2006;
Thieme & Wyss, 2005).
Recent estimates suggest that there may be as many as three million
Nepalis, or about 10 percent of the total population, working abroad
(Government of Nepal, 2071 (2014); World Bank, 2009). The
percentage of migrants is much higher for young people and for men.
In 1997, about 100,000 migrants were estimated working outside
of Nepal (excluding India) (Seddon, Adhikari, & Gurung, 2002).
The 2011 population census reported about 2 million individuals
as migrants (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2012). More recently,
migration has been a rite of passage and a matter of social status and
prestige for individuals (Thieme & Wyss, 2005). Over 1500 Nepalis
move outside of the country everyday (Kern & Muller-Boker, 2015;
Pattison, 2014). Undocumented migration is also very high and it
is difficult to estimate precisely the number of Nepalis who have
migrated outside the country.
With the increased volume of out-migration, the volume of
remittances is also increasing over time in Nepal. Estimates show
that the remittances from out-migration accounted for about 29
percent of GDP (World Bank, 2016). This account does not capture
the remittances received through informal channels. Now, Nepal
stands as the third largest remittance recipient in its contribution to
GDP in the world, whose position was sixth in 2011 (World Bank,
2011; 2016).
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |5
Remittances have become an important source of household income
for Nepalis (Adhikari, 2001; Hoermann & Kollmair, 2009; Pant,
2008; Sharma & Gurung, 2009). The Nepal Living Standard Survey
(2010/11) reports that 56 percent of the households in Nepal receive
remittances (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2011). On average, the
income transfer in the form of remittances is Rs 80,436 (in nominal
terms) per year per recipient household. The most recent Household
Budget Survey revealed that in 2014/15 remittance was the third
(17.61%) most important source of a household's monthly income
after salary, wages, allowance and pension (30.26%) and business
income (24.43%) (Nepal Rastra Bank, 2016). In rural Nepal, it was
the second most important source of household income.
Migrant Destinations and Destination Specific Earning
Potentials
Nepali migrants are distributed worldwide. In 1997, excluding India,
they were reported in 25 countries (Seddon, Adhikari & Gurung,
2002). Recent data for 2013/14 shows that Nepalis are working in
131 countries (Government of Nepal, 2014).
Until 1990s, India was the most popular international destination for
Nepali workers. Migration to India still dominates due to its open
border, socio-cultural and linguistic similarities, and past migration
experiences. The 2009 Nepal Migration Survey estimates that
of the total 2.1 million Nepali work migrants, 41 percent were in
India, 38 percent in the Middle Eastern Gulf countries, 12 percent
in Malaysia and 8.7 percent in other developed countries (World
Bank, 2011). However, more recently, countries in the Middle East,
South East Asia, the West (Northern Europe and North America)
and Australia have been the popular destinations. In 2009, excluding
India, Malaysia, Saudi Arab, Qatar, and United Arab Emirates
accounted for nearly 85 percent of international migrants (Ozaki,
2012). About 75 percent Nepali international migrants are unskilled
and are employed mainly in entry-level jobs such as cleaning and
construction (Kern & Muller-Boker, 2015).
Earning potentials of migrants vary by destinations. Destination
such as India is easily accessible to migrants compared to other
international destinations, but earning potentials in India are
6| Prem Bhandari
relatively less. Seddon, Gurung & Adhikari (1998) reported that
migration to the Middle Eastern countries have relatively better
earnings compared to India but less earnings compared to other
destinations such asAmerica,Australia, the United Kingdom, Japan,
Malaysia, South Korea, and Thailand. Thus countries of Europe and
North America, and East and South East Asia are generally desired
by Nepali migrants for higher wages, better working conditions and
possibilities for accumulation. Japan is the most favored destination
for Nepalis with high wages and large savings for a successful
migrant (Thieme and Wyss, 2005). Seddon et al. (1998) further
revealed that even the lowest level of monthly remittances from the
West, and from the Far East and South East Asia are significantly
higher than the average sent back from the Gulf or India (Seddon et
al., 1998; Thieme and Wyss, 2005). Moreover, Seddon et al. (1998)
and Williams et al. (2012) reported that there is variation in the
amount of remittances sent by a migrant. Despite these, whether the
receipt of remittances or the extent to which the amount received by
a household does vary by migration destinations adjusting for other
factors is not clear.
Hypothesis on Destination Specific Remittances Received by
Households
Given the background above, this study investigates the remittance
receipt by migrant households using the New Economics of Labor
Migration (NELM) framework. According to NELM, migration of
individuals is a family-based decision and is an attempt to diversify
household income portfolios to protect against risk and gain access
to capital in order to finance consumer and productive purchases
(Stark, 1991; Stark & Bloom, 1985; Stark & Taylor, 1991). Thus,
the decision to migrate by household members is a family strategy to
minimize risks/uncertainties. By making such decision, a household
makes an investment on migration. In return, the household expects
to receive remittances (Sana & Massey, 2005)1.
1. There are three arguments to explain whether a migrant will remit or not:
altruism, self-interest, and insurance and risk sharing (Agarwal & Horowitz,
2002; Arun & Ulku, 2011; ZaiLiang & Ma, 2013; Ecer & Tompkins, 2013).
It is assumed that migrants are concerned about their family members
back home. Thus, they send remittances for the well-being of households
members who are left behind (altruism motive) (ZaiLiang & Ma, 2013).
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |7
It can be expected that a household will send members to destinations
with high earning potentials with the expectation of receiving higher
returns, here, remittances. However, the destinations with higher
earning potentials are most likely hardest to be reached (Seddon et
al., 1998). But when the migrants are successful to get there and get
a job, the earning potentials are higher. It is known that migrant's
earning is one of the important determinants of whether one remits or
not and the amount of remittances sent (Arun & Ulku, 2011). As the
earning potentials of migration vary by destinations, it is expected
that the remittances received by a household from migrants will also
vary by migrants' destinations. Thus, it is hypothesized that:
Net of other factors, households with migrants in destinations
with high earning potentials (e.g. East and South East Asia, North
America, Europe and Australia or in the Middle East) will be
more likely to report that they received remittances from migrants
compared to those who are in destinations with low earning
potentials (such as Nepal or India); and
Net of other factors, households with migrants in destinations
with high earning potentials (e.g. East and South East Asia, North
America, Europe and Australia or in the Middle East) will report
the higher amount of remittances received from migrants than those
who are in countries with low earning potentials.
Methodology
The setting
This study was conducted in the western Chitwan Valley of Nepal.
Before the 1950s, the valley was primarily covered with dense
forests and was infamous for malarial infestation. In 1956, His
Next, migrants may have interest to maintain family tie with the intention
of returning back home. This intention will motivate them to remit. The
third one is the insurance and risk sharing also termed as the contractual
agreement. According to Arun & Ulku (2011), this is basically a mutual
agreement between the migrant and his/her family members that they will
help each other in difficult times (risk sharing). Or, the agreement could be
to pay back the cost of migration or education incurred by migrant's family.
These motives may overlap. This study, however, does not intend to test
these arguments.
8| Prem Bhandari
Majesty's Government of Nepal in collaboration with the United
States Government's International Cooperation Assistance program,
implemented a malaria eradication campaign and distributed land
parcels to people coming from adjoining districts of the country.
The flat terrain with its highly fertile soil and warm climate offered
promising opportunities for people who were struggling with the
steep hill and mountain slopes.
Chitwan, once known as a "death valley" soon became a melting
pot, receiving people from all over the country (Shrestha, 1990;
Shivakoti et al., 1997). Recently, Chitwan has experienced dramatic
changes in population mobility, transitioning from a frontier
destination for in-migrants from surrounding hill districts of Nepal
to one of the country's major migrant-sending districts (Bhandari,
2004; Bhandari & Ghimire, 2016). According to 2011 census, as
many as 29% (27% for Nepal) of the households reported that at
least one member was absent from household. About 9% (Nepal =
7%) population were reported to be absent of which 16% (Nepal=
13%) were males and 2% (Nepal=2%) were females. This absentee
population includes both internal and international migrants.
Farming remains the primary source of livelihood in the Chitwan
Valley. The valley is inhabited mostly by in-migrants, especially
from pahad, i.e., the hill and mountains and other adjacent Tarai
districts including India. Chitwan's central location and relatively
well-developed transportation network have been the catalytic
forces for turning it into a hub for business and tourism. This has
resulted in a rapid proliferation of government services, businesses,
and wage labor opportunities in the district (Shivakoti et al., 1999).
Data
The data were collected in 2013 from migrant sending
households. Migrant sending households come from 30 randomly
selected geographic clusters also called the neighborhoods. The
neighborhoods are the lowest level sampling units chosen. To select
neighborhoods, first, the study area of western Chitwan Valley was
divided into three different strata based on the approximate distance
from Narayanghat, the urban center of the Chitwan District, to select
a representative sample of neighborhoods. Stratum 1 included areas
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |9
nearest to Narayanghat, stratum 3 included areas farthest from it
and stratum 2 included areas in between. The samples were selected
at two stages. In the first stage, in each stratum 10 settlements
were randomly sampled based on probability proportionate to size,
thus making a total of 30 settlements. These settlements were then
divided into non-overlapping clusters called neighborhood or tol
that consisted of 5-15 households. For the purpose of this study, 10
neighborhoods each from three strata were selected thus making a
total of 30 communities2. The detailed discussion of the design and
selection procedure of the neighborhoods is described in Barber et
al. (1997).
Altogether 394 households were enumerated in 30 neighborhood
clusters. Of them, 187 (47 percent) households had at least one
member (age 12 years and above) away from home for most of the
time in the past six months. These are the working age individuals
who could earn money and send remittances back home. Proportion
of migrant households is consistent with the results of the Nepal
Living Standard Survey (2010/11), which reported about 53 percent
households in Nepal that reported at least one absentee living
currently within or outside the country.
A face-to-face interview was conducted to 185 eligible households
with a 99 percent response rate. Any household that has at least one
member away from home most of the time in the past six months
was considered eligible for the survey. Six months' time was
considered to allow a migrant to earn money and send remittances
back home. Any individual 18 years of age and over who could
provide information about the household, remittances and remittance
use was interviewed. Multiple informants from a household were
allowed to respond the household survey. Study strictly followed the
standard practice of ethical codes, interviewing and data collection3.
Consent was read to the informants and permission was obtained
2. These neighborhoods are outside of the 151 Chitwan Valley Family Study
(CVFS) neighborhoods (see Barber et al, 1997 for CVFS information).
3. Ethical consideration: Ethical approval was sought from the Institutional
Review Board (IRB) of the University of Michigan prior to implementation
of the survey. In addition, the author is certified with the human subjects
protection "Program for Education and Evaluation in Responsible Research
and Scholarship" at the University of Michigan.

prior to the survey.
The field work collected information on migration and remittances.
For each migrant, place (country) of migrant's destination by month
(for 12 months), occupation, whether the household received any
remittances (money, goods or gifts) from the migrant during the
study-year, and, if received, the amount of money or the value of
goods or gifts received by the household from each person each
month in the past 12 months. This information was recorded for
each migrant for each month. In addition, information about each
migrant's demographic characteristics such as age, gender, current
place of residence, marital status, migration experience, and
education were collected. For this study, out-migration is defined as
any departure from the neighborhood lasting at least three months
or more (most of the time in the past six months) for any reason. It
includes movement within or outside of Nepal. Other information
collected was household size and caste/ethnicity.
Measures
There are two outcome measures. This study utilized data from
migrants who were currently working at the destination as reported
by the household informant.
Outcome 1. Receipt of remittances. The first outcome measure is
whether a household received remittances or not from a migrant
who is working outside of Chitwan in Nepal or abroad. Information
was collected by asking, "In the past 12 months, did you or your
household receive money, goods or gifts from.....?' The response
was recorded `1', if the household received remittance in any month
in the past 12 months and otherwise `0.'
Outcome 2. Amount of remittances received. The second outcome
measure is the amount of remittances received by a household from
each migrant. The information was collected by asking, "Altogether,
how much money did you or your household receive in the past 12
months, including the value of any goods or gifts? Please also tell
me when did you receive?" The amount (in Nepali Rupees) was
recorded in the month when the household received the remittance.
The amount was summed up for the year to calculate the total
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |11
amount of remittance received by the household in a year. Then,
the amount was divided by total number of months the migrant was
away from home in the year to calculate migrant's months-adjusted
remittance4. The amount of migrant's months-adjusted monthly
remittance (natural log)5 was used as the outcome measure.
Explanatory measure and controls: Migrant's destination was used
as the primary explanatory measure to examine whether remittance
receipt varied by destination. Migration destinations are grouped as:
(a) outside Chitwan in Nepal, (b) India, (c) Middle East, (d) Other
Asia, and (e) America, Australia and Europe. These groupings are
as used by Seddon et al. (1998). Those who migrated to Nepal are
considered as the reference category. Individual level controls are
sex of the remittance sender (male/female), age (15-24; 25-34 and 35
and above), education (5 years or below, 6-11 years and 12 years and
above), marital status (currently married vs. others), and migration
experience (number of years). Household level controls used are the
number of migrant's from the same household, household size and
caste/ethnicity (grouped as Brahmin/Chhetri, Dalit, Hill Janajati,
Newar and Tarai Janajati).
Analytical strategy
First, descriptive statistics of each measure used in the analysis are
provided. Next, multivariate models were estimated to examine
the influence destination may have on remittance received by
a household. Because migrant households were clustered in
neighborhoods multilevel modeling (hierarchical linear modeling)
techniques was used to estimate the models.
The first outcome measure, whether a household received any
remittances or not from each working migrant is measured as a
dichotomy: coded "1" if a household received remittances from
the migrant and "0" otherwise. As migrants are clustered within
4. Some migrants were away from home for the whole year and others
were away only for a couple of months. Therefore, the migrant's-months
adjusted amount of remittances received by a household per month was
calculated.
5. The actual amount of remittances was transformed to natural log to
normalize the data.
12| Prem Bhandari
neighborhoods, multilevel logistic regression models are estimated
using SAS GLIMMIX procedure. This strategy takes into account of
clusteringofindividuals,hereindividualmigrants,byneighborhoods.
Results are provided as odds ratios, which are anti-logs of the raw
logit coefficients. These odds ratios can be interpreted as: if the
coefficient is greater than 1, the effect is positive and every unit
increase in the independent variable increases the odds of receiving
remittances by the household. Conversely, if the coefficient is less
than 1, then every unit increase in the independent variable decreases
the odds of receiving remittances by the household.
The second outcome measure, the amount of remittances (logged)
received by a household from each migrant per month is a ratio
measure. Thus, a multilevel OLS regression technique was used to
estimate the models.
Findings
Remittance received by migrant households
Of the total migrant households (n=185), 75 percent (n=139) of them
reported that the household received remittances from migrants in
the past 12 months (Table 1). At the national level, this figure was
56 percent in 2010/11 (Central Bureau of Statistics, 2011). Of the
total 283 individual migrants from 185 households, 150 (53 percent
of the total) migrants remitted. Out of the total remittance recipient
households, 93 percent households received remittances from one
migrant and the remaining households received it from 3 or more
migrants.

Migrants by destination
Of the total migrants (n=283), 29 percent were within Nepal and 71
percent were outside Nepal. Of the total, 33 percent migrants were
in the Middle East, 17 percent in Other Asian countries (Malaysia,
Japan, South Korea and Thailand), 12 percent in India and 10
percent in America, Australia and Europe. Even from such a small
sample of households, migrants were distributed in 20 different
countries outside Nepal (Table 3). Saudi Arab was the most popular
international destination (12.4%) followed by India (11.7% cent),
Japan (9.5%) and Qatar (8.1%).

Characteristics of working migrants
Now, turn to research question: does remittance received by a
household vary by migrant destination? To answer, only those
migrants who were working at the destination irrespective of whether
the household received remittances or not from them (n=195; 69%
of total migrants) were included in the analysis.
Descriptive statistics of the measures are provided in Table 4.
Household informant(s) reported that they received remittances
from 74.4 percent of the migrants who were working in various
destinations. Altogether, significantly large proportions (45%) of
the currently working migrants were located in the Middle East,
followed by Other Asia (19%), Nepal (15%), India (11%) and
America, Australia and Europe (10%). About 13 percent of these
migrants were females, nearly one-half (46%) of them were between
the ages of 25-34 years and four-fifths of them were currently
married. Slightly over one-half of the migrants had 6-11 years of
education, and a migrant's average length of time at the destination
was slightly over 4 years.
A migrant household had, on average, about 2 migrants who were
working at the destination. The size of the household was about 6.
About one-half of the migrants belonged to Brahmin/Chhetri, 16
percent each of Dalit and Hill Janajati, 13 percent Tarai Janajati and
about 8 percent were Newar. Table 4 also presents the distribution of
remitters and non-remitters.

Remittance received by households from working migrants
Table 5 shows that there is a variation in proportion of household
report of remittances received by migrant's destination. Results in
column 1 show that households who had working migrants in Nepal
received remittance from 65.5 percent of them. Households received
remittances from 89 percent of the migrants who were working in
the Middle East followed by those who were in America, Australia
and Europe (75.7%). Households received remittances from fewer
migrants who were working in Other Asian countries (50%) and
India (47.7%).
Now the question is: do the results in Table 5 hold true even
after adjusting for other factors? Below, the results of multilevel
multivariate analysis (Table 6) are discussed.
First, a null or unconditional model was estimated. The results
of unconditional model provide just the random effects for the
intercept and do not include the effects of any predictors (results are
not shown). Results from the null model estimated level-1 intercept
of the outcome measure whether a household received remittances
from a migrant or not as a random effect of level-2 geographic

clusters also called neighborhoods with no other predictors at
level-1 or level-2. The intercept is the level-2 random intercept
representing the log odds of receiving remittance or not by a
household in a typical cluster. The random intercept (1.412; p<.001;
result not shown) is statistically significant which implied that there
is a variation in receiving remittances by a household by geographic
clusters suggesting for a multilevel modeling as a better approach of
analysis (Garson, 2007).
Next, two random coefficient models were estimated. Results in
model 1 are the fixed effects of level-1 predictors, migrant's current
place of destinations (these results are similar to those in Table 5,
column 1). Results show that households were significantly more
likely to receive remittances from migrants who were working
in the Middle East and Other Asian countries as compared to
the remittance/income of those who are working in Nepal. To be
precise, the odds of receiving remittances from a migrant who is
working in the Middle East is 4.73 times greater (odds ratio=4.73;
p<=.01; model 1) than the odds of receiving remittances/ income
from migrants working in Nepal. Similarly, the odds of receiving
remittances from a migrant who is in Other Asian countries is 3.50
times higher (odds ratio=3.50; p<.10) than the odds of receiving
remittances/income from migrants in Nepal. The unadjusted results
show that households are less likely to report receiving remittances
from migrants who are working in India and America, Australia and
Europe, but the results are not statistically significant.
Results in model 2 are the effects of migrant's destination on whether
a household received remittance or not controlling for sex, age,
marital status, education, migration experience, number of migrants
in the household, and household size and caste/ethnicity. Net of
other controls, the results show that households were significantly
less likely (92%) to receive remittances from migrants who were
working in India (odds ratio=0.08; p<=.05; model 2) compared to
the remittance received from those who were working in Nepal.
This could be mainly because there are no other methods of sending
remittances back home other than by hand carriage (Thieme and
Wyss, 2005). Results for the Middle East and Other Asian countries
turned out to be statistically not significant after controlling for other
characteristics particularly after the inclusion of age and education
suggesting that these factors were more important than destination
itself.

The odds of receiving remittances from a female migrant were 85
percent (odds ratio=0.15; p<=.01; model 2) less than the odds of
receiving remittances from male migrants. Migrant's age, marital
status, education and migration experience were not statistically
significant in determining household receipt of remittances, net
of other factors. Increased number of migrants from a household
reduced the odds of receiving remittances at home.
Amount of remittances received by households from working
migrants
On average, a migrant household received 12,382 NRs. in a month
from a migrant who was working, individually. The unadjusted
(descriptive) results in Table 5 show that there is a statistically
significant variation in the amount of remittances received by
households from working migrants (as well as remitters) by place of
destination.The unadjusted results show that on average, a household
received the highest amount (NRs. 18,584, column 2) of remittance
per month from migrants who were working in America, Australia
and Europe. This was followed by Middle East (NRs. 15,040), Other
Asian countries (NRs. 11,031), and India (NRs. 5,133). A household
received a least amount (NRs. 2,583) of remittances from migrants
whowereworkingwithinNepaloutsideofChitwan.Amongremitters
only, on average, a household received NRs. 24,558 (Table 5, column
3) per month from migrants who were working inAmerica,Australia
and Europe. This was followed by Other Asian countries (NRs.
22,062), Middle East (NRs. 16,969), India (NRs. 10,779). Among
remitters only, a household received NRs. 3,942 from migrants who
were working in Nepal.
Does this variation in the amount of remittances received by
households from migrants working in various destinations hold true
afteradjustingforotherindividualandhouseholdlevelcharacteristics?
The results of multilevel models (Table 7) are discussed below. Two
separate models are estimated. Results in model 1include migrants
who are currently working at the destination irrespective of whether
a household received any remittance from them or not. In model 2,
only those migrants who are currently working at the destination
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |23
and the household reported receipt of remittances from him/her are
examined.
First,asdiscussedearlier,anullorunconditionalmodelwasestimated.
The random intercepts in both models are statistically significant
which implied that there is a variation in the amount of remittances
received by a household by geographic clusters suggesting for a
multilevel modeling (Garson, 2007). Outcome measure, the amount
of remittances received per month, is normalized (natural log) to
avoid influence of any outliers in the data.
The results in model 1, among all working migrants, show that
the amount of remittances received from migrants statistically
significantly varied by destination even after adjusting for all other
controls. For instance, household report of the amount of remittances
received from migrants who were working in India, in fact, was
significantly less (slope=-2.43 (logged), p<.05, model 1) compared
to those who were working in Nepal. Surprisingly, this difference
was wiped out (slope=0.48 (logged), p>.05, model 2) when only
remittance sending individuals were included in the model (model
2). This result suggests that if only migrants who send remittances
are compared, the amount of money received from migrants working
in India and Nepal is not significantly different. This could be
true because mostly unskilled migrants work in India. However,
a household received significantly large amount of remittances
from migrants who were working in Other Asian countries (2.97
times logged) and Middle East (2.10 times logged) as compared to
those who were working in Nepal. Interestingly, the amount was
statistically significantly not different among migrants working in
America, Australia and Europe and in Nepal. When only remitters
are considered (model 2), a household received significantly large
amount of remittances from migrants who were working in Other
Asian countries (2.97 times logged), America, Australia and
Europe (2.27 times logged) and Middle East (2.10 times logged) as
compared to those who were working in Nepal. These results imply
that the remittance received by households does vary by migrant's
destination.

A household received significantly less amount of remittances
from females compared to their male counterparts (in both models
1 and 2). Migration experience slightly increased the amount of
remittances received. An increase in number of migrants in the
household significantly decreased the amount of remittances
received by a household. This is as expected. Migrants tend to share
the responsibility/obligation as well as risk and therefore are less
likely to remit if a household has multiple migrants (ZaiLiang & Ma,
2013). The amount of remittances received by households, however,
did not significantly vary by migrant's age, marital status, education,
household size and caste/ethnicity. These results are consistent with
those of Williams et al. (2012).
Discussion and Conclusion
Nepalisexperiencingmassiveout-migrationofyouthsmorerecently.
Migration has been a rite of passage for individuals. Households are
increasingly relying on migration and remittances for livelihood.
With the increase of out-migrants, the volume of remittances is
increasing over time. Now, the remittance from migrants has been
an important source of a household's economy (Nepal Rastra Bank,
2016).
Nepali youths are scattered globally. Evidence suggests that earning
potentials for migrants vary by destination. Some destinations such
as America, Australia, Europe, Japan, and South Korea have high
earning potentials. Middle Eastern countries are of medium earning
potentials. Other destination such as India has low earning potential.
It was widely believed that the remittance received by households
does vary by migrant's destination. However, less was known
about this and empirical support was scanty. This exploratory study
provides empirical evidence on whether the receipt of remittances
and the amount of remittances received by households do vary by
migrant's destination using the recently collected data from the
western Chitwan Valley of Nepal.
Findings reveal that net of migrant's and household characteristics,
a household receipt of remittances varied by migrant's destination.
Adjusting for other factors, if migrants are working in India, a
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |27
household is significantly less likely to receive remittances from
them as compared to those who are working in Nepal. This could
be because most migrants may bring remittances with them when
they return. Evidence also suggests that a household is more likely
to receive remittances, if a member is working in the Middle East
or in Other Asian countries. Surprisingly, if a member is working
in America, Australia or Europe, a household is equally likely to
receive remittances from those who are working in Nepal. This could
be due to the fact that most migrants at these destinations are usually
with their families and may not be able to send savings back home.
Or, because of the possibility of settlement, migrants may also spend
earnings in order for settlement at the destination.
Theevidencefurthersuggeststhattheamountofremittancesreceived
by households from migrants working in India is not statistically
significantly different from the amount received from those working
in Nepal. This is as expected because India is the country with low
earning potential. Nepali migrants are compelled to go to India due
to several reasons. It is easy and less expensive to go to India and
find a job (Seddon et al., 1998). Even the unacceptable jobs (with
less respect and low earning or so called faltukam or useless work) in
Nepal are acceptable in India (Sharma, 2011). Temporary migration
of short duration is another reason to migrate to India. Migrants may
go to India during off-crop seasons in Nepal, work there for a short
period of time (3-4 months) and return home with some money which
is not possible in other destinations. Migrants escape from traditional
work particularly halo jotne (ploughing the field) or bharibokne
(carrying loads) when they go to India.
As hypothesized, evidence show that households received
significantly more amount of remittances from migrants working
in regions with high earning potentials. For instance, households
received significantly higher amount of remittances from those who
were working in OtherAsian countries (2.29 times logged),America,
Australia and Europe (2.27 times logged) and the Middle East (1.76
times logged) as compared to the amount received from migrants
working in Nepal, net of all other factors. The largest (adjusted)
amount of remittances was received from migrants working in Other
Asian countries (e.g. Japan, South Korea, Malaysia) followed by
28| Prem Bhandari
America, Australia and Europe and the Middle East. These adjusted
results are as expected by Seddon et al. (1998).
The results from this study have important implications. First, there
is variation in the amount of remittances received from migrants
working in various destinations. As hypothesized, the evidence
suggests that households received significantly higher amount of
remittances from migrants who are working in countries with high
earning potentials and vice versa. Such destination specific variation
in the amount of remittance received by households will increase
income inequality among migrant households. Moreover, organizing
migration in countries with high earning potentials requires high
investment and social networks in terms of education, training,
and finances for travel (Sharma, 2011; Seddon et al., 1998). Thus,
only resourceful individuals may migrate to countries with higher
earning potentials. Using data from Nepal Living Standard Survey
(2003/04), Gurung (2012) found that socially included groups
(privileged caste, rich, educated, land owners) were more likely
to choose destinations where earning opportunities are relatively
better. Gurung reported that individuals from richer households were
found to migrate to countries other than India and those from poorer
households migrated to India or rural Nepal. On the other hand, Hill
Janajati migrants were more likely to go to the Middle East, Malaysia
and other developed countries. This scenario suggests individuals
from households that are already privileged in Nepal will move to
destinations with high earning potentials. Such households receive
higher amount of remittances, thus further deepening the inequalities
among households in sending areas. Similar observations were made
by Jones and Basnett (2013) who reported that nearly one-third of the
remittance was received by the richest quintile households.
Moreover, evidences suggest that remittance has important effect
on household's poverty reduction and children's human capital
development such as schooling and health (e.g. De & Ratha, 2012;
Dey, 2015). Variation in the amount of remittances received by
migrant households from migrants working in different destinations
will have important implications on the utilization of remittances by
households. Such a variation in the amount of remittances received
by households will have differential impact on poverty alleviation
Dhaulagiri Journal of Sociology and Anthropology Vol. 10, 2016 |29
and children's human capital development. Again the privileged
households will be in better-off situation. This is just one example.
There could be several important implications where remittances
could have direct or indirect effects. This will lead to a vicious cycle
that originates from destination specific migration. Further studies
are needed to examine such influences.
While this study has important contributions to the field of migration
and remittance research, it is not free from limitations. The results
are based on data from a small sample of migrant households
collected from a part of the southern Tarai plain of rural Nepal.
Thus, the findings may not be generalizable to other parts of the
country. Moreover, the associations described earlier are based on
cross-sectional data. Thus, the conclusions should be considered
rather cautiously. However, this study helps generate theoretically
important and policy relevant research questions for future studies.
It is also believed that this study will help develop hypothesis and
test the causality of the effects of destination specific migration and
remittances on various aspects of household economy. The findings
will be useful to those who are interested in studying the long-term
consequences of migration and remittances such as reducing income
inequality or poverty.
