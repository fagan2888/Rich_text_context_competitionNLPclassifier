Changes In US Spending On
Mental Health And Substance
Abuse Treatment, 1986­2005,
And Implications For Policy
ABSTRACT The United States invests a sizable amount of money on
treatments for mental health and substance abuse: $135 billion in 2005,
or 1.07 percent of the gross domestic product. We provide treatment
spending estimates from the period 1986­2005 to build understanding of
past trends and consider future possibilities. We find that the growth rate
in spending on mental health medications--a major driver of mental
health expenditures in prior years--declined dramatically. As a result,
mental health and substance abuse spending grew at a slightly slower
rate than gross domestic product in 2004 and 2005, and it continued to
shrink as a share of all health spending. Of note, we also find that
Medicaid's share of total spending on mental health grew from 17 percent
in 1986 to 27 percent in 2002 to 28 percent in 2005. The recent recession,
the full implementation of federal parity law, and such health reform-
related actions as the planned expansion of Medicaid all have the
potential to improve access to mental health and substance abuse
treatment and to alter spending patterns further. Our spending estimates
provide an important context for evaluating the effect of those policies.
Mental illness and substance
abuse conditions--some-
times collectively referred to
as behavioral health disor-
ders--are extremely preva-
lent. They significantly affect the productivity,
morbidity, and mortality of the US population.
To understand the size, nature, and value of the
nation's investment in health, it is important to
examine spending on treatment of these behav-
ioral health conditions, who is paying for that
treatment, and which providers furnish
that care.
Calculating spending on behavioral health
treatment is particularly important given recent
major health policy changes. The Paul Wellstone
and Pete Domenici Mental Health Parity and
Addiction Equity Act of 2008 and the Affordable
Care Act of 2010 have tremendous potential to
improve access to behavioral health services and
to alter past spending trends. Millions of people
who previously experienced limits or caps in
their psychiatric and substance abuse health in-
surance benefits should gain better access to
services because of the Parity Act. Millions more
uninsured people with mental health conditions
and substance use disorders will gain insurance
coverage because of the Affordable Care Act.
Recognizing the need for comprehensive, on-
going, and consistent data to inform the field,
the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (SAMHSA) has routinely devel-
oped estimates of spending on behavioral health
for more than ten years. We present the most
recent mental health and substance abuse treat-
ment spending estimates for the period 1986­
2005.We also describe total spending on mental
health and substance abuse treatment, as well as
spending by payer, provider, and site of service.

Study Data And Methods
The approach used to estimate national behav-
ioral health spending was designed to be consis-
tent with the National Health Expenditure Ac-
counts compiled annually by the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) and with
the framework from which the estimates of
spending for all health care are constructed.
Two basic methods were used, depending on
provider and service type.
The first method relied on SAMHSA's Survey
of Mental Health Organizations and National
Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services
to develop estimates for specialty substance
abuse and mental health centers and hospitals.
The second method carved out spending on
behavioral health from the Centers for Medicare
and Medicaid Services' (CMS's) National Health
Expenditure Accounts using numerous data
sets--mainly public-use, nationally representa-
tive, provider-based data.
Allocations to behavioral health typically in-
volved first determining the proportion of total
service use (for example, inpatient days) associ-
ated with a primary behavioral disorder, then
adjusting for differences in average charges
and cost sharing. The two methods were inte-
grated by summing spending for each provider
and payer after accountingforduplication across
data sources.
Behavioral disorders were defined using the
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Re-
vision, Clinical Modification (IDC-9-CM). The
spending estimates capture only the cost of pro-
viding behavioral health treatment. Other non-
medical and nontreatment costs are excluded,
such as the costs of lost productivity and somatic
conditions that result from mental illness or sub-
stance abuse--for example, physical complica-
tions from excessive drinking.
The estimates developed here may differ from
those based on other data sources, such as the
Medical ExpenditurePanelSurvey, conducted by
the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality
(AHRQ). That survey covers only the noninsti-
tutionalized population, and it also under-
reports high-cost cases, emergency department
visits, and physician office visits.1­3
A key strength of SAMHSA's effort is the use of
consistent and comprehensive methods to track
trends over almost twenty years. A more detailed
description of the methods is available else-
where.4
Study Results
Overview In 2005 an estimated $22 billion was
spent on substance abuse treatment and $113 bil-
lion, on mental health treatment in the United
States (Exhibit 1). During the study period
(1986­2005) both mental health and substance
abuse spending grew more slowly than all health
spending: 4.8 percent annually for substance
abuse, 6.9 percent annually for mental health,
and 7.9 percent annually for all health (Exhibits 1
and 2).
The same pattern occurred in the 2002­05
period, in which spending for substance abuse
grew the most slowly (5.0 percent), followed by
mental health (6.4 percent) and all health
(7.3 percent).
As a result of the slower growth, substance
abuse spending fell from 2.1 percent of all health
spending in 1986 to 1.2 percent in 2005. Mental
health spending fell from 7.2 percent in 1986 to
6.1 percent in 2005. As a proportion of the gross
domestic product (GDP), substance abuse was a
small and declining share (0.21­0.18 percent),
and mental health spending increased slightly
but remained at less than 1 percent of GDP
(0.71­0.89 percent from 1986 to 2005).
Mental Health Spending Trends During the
past decade, prescription drug spending has
been a key driver of overall mental health spend-
ing (Exhibit 3). The period 1998­2002 was one
of accelerating prescription drug growth as a
number of new, brand-name medications were
adopted.
Mental health prescription expenditures aver-
aged annual growth of 21.5 percent from 1998 to
2002--faster than the growth of spending for all
prescription drugs of 15.5 percent. Psychiatric
drugs contributed almost half of the increase
in mental health spending between 1998 and
2002. These drugs were also an important
growth component of overall medication spend-
ing: They contributed almost one percentage
point to the growth rate.
The only period in which total mental health
spending outpaced growth for all health spend-
ing was during the 1998­2002 period, when
mental health spending grew 8.8 percent annu-
ally versus 7.8 percent for all health.
During the 2002­05 period there was a large
decline in the growth of spending on psychiatric
prescription drugs. From 1999 to 2000, spend-
ing grew 27.3 percent; however, from 2004 to
2005, growth in psychiatric prescription drug
spending was only 5.6 percent. Analyses of pre-
scription drug purchases from retail and mail-
order pharmacies supplied by IMS Health's Na-
tional Prescription Audit indicates that the slow-
down continued, with an average growth rate of
only 4.4 percent between 2006 and 2009.
The decline in the rate of growth of spending
can be explained, in part, by the fact that a variety
of psychiatric medications moved off patent and
generic drug equivalents became available.5 Use

of generic medications was encouraged by a
number of insurance benefit design changes that
were implemented during the same period.6 Ad-
ditionally, an analysis of MarketScan data indi-
cated that in terms of numbers of patients using
the medications, there was a continued expan-
sion of use, but at a slower pace: The percentage
using any psychiatric drug grew from 13.7 per-
cent of the privately insured population in 1998
and 19.5 percent in 2004 to only 20 percent
in 2009.
The growth in prescription drug use through
the 1990s is in contrast to the dramatic reduction
in psychiatric hospitalizations. Spending on spe-
cialty psychiatric hospital care fell from 23 per-
cent of all mental health spending in 1992 to
15 percent in 1998. Furthermore, care shifted
from psychiatric hospitals to general hospital

psychiatric units.
From 2002 to 2005, mental health spending in
specialty hospitals continued to grow modestly
at 3.9 percent, while general hospital mental
health expenditures grew more robustly at
5.5 percent annually. By 2005 a greater propor-
tion of mental health spending was for treatment
in general hospitals (15 percent) than for treat-
ment in specialty hospitals (12 percent)--a re-
versal from 1992.
Exhibit 4 presents estimates of spending by
the major payers. The implementation of the
Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act
of 2008 focused attention on private insurance
spending. In both 2002 and 2005, just 4.4 per-
cent of all health spending by private insurance
went toward treatment of mental health con-
ditions.
Medicaid is the largest payer of mental health
treatment services. In 2005, 10 percent of total
Medicaid spending was for mental health. The
share of mental health spending funded by
Medicaid has been increasing, from 17 percent
in 1986 to 27 percent in 2002 to 28 percent in
2005. In contrast, spending from non-Medicaid
state and local government sources continued to
decline from 20 percent of all mental health
spending in 2002 to 18 percent in 2005.
Substance Abuse Spending Trends In 2008,
22.2 million people age twelve or older (8.9 per-
cent of that population) were identified as hav-
ing substance abuse or dependence problems.
During the same year, only about 4 million re-
ceived treatment, 2.2 million of those from self-
help groups.7
Despite the prevalence of the condition, sub-
stance abuse spending was a small and declining
share of all health spending by most payers. In
2005 only 1.5 percent of Medicaid spending,
0.4 percent of Medicare spending, and 0.4 per-
cent of private insurance spending went to treat-
ment for substance abuse. The largest share of
spending was 7.3 percent for the category "other
(non-Medicaid) state and local governments."
Spending on substance abuse services during
the past three decades can be characterized by a
period of boom and bust. The 1980s was a time of
expanding insurance benefits and broadened ac-
cess to substance abuse treatment providers.8­10
However, by the mid- to late-1980s, employers
were increasingly alarmed by spiraling health
care costs. Substance abuse treatment, in par-
ticular, was perceived as an example of inflated
spending--a perception enhanced by the grow-
ing private treatment industry.11
The result was managed care restrictions on
reimbursement for substance abuse treatment in
hospitals. Restrictions included limitations on
the commonly used treatment paradigm of a
twenty-eight-day inpatient rehabilitation stay.
From 1992 to 1998, inpatient substance abuse
spending fell 8.7 percent annually. About 70 per-
cent of that drop came from inpatient hospital
services.
By 2002, substance abuse treatment spending
started to grow again: 5 percent annually from
2002 through 2005. This was above the 2.8 per-
centgrowthininflationbutbelowthe5.9percent
growth in the GDP.
Although psychiatry has been transformed by
the introduction of drug therapies, medication
has played a small part in substance abuse treat-
ment. It accounted for only 1 percent of sub-
stance abuse treatment spending in 2005. How-
ever, this situation may be changing.
Three new substance abuse medications--
acamprosate and extended-release naltrexone
for alcohol dependence and buprenorphine for
opiate addictions--were introduced in 2002­06
(acamprosate in 2005, extended-release naltrex-
one in 2006, and buprenorphine in 2002). As a
result, spending on substance abuse medica-
tions has grown rapidly, from $10 million in
1992 to $141 million in 2005. More recent data
from IMS Health indicate that substance abuse
medication spending was $780 million in 2009--
a large increase but still far below spending on
psychiatric medications.
Our estimates reveal that substance abuse
treatment is much more dependent on public
financing than all health and mental health ser-
vices. The largest payer of substance abuse treat-
ment was other (non-Medicaid) state and local
governments (36 percent), followed by Medicaid
(21 percent), and other federal (16 percent). Re-
liance on public funding has increased over time,
in large part because of the dramatic decline in
funding from private insurance, which fell be-
tween 1986 and 1998 from 27 percent to 12 per-
cent, where it remained in 2005.
Spending By Specialty Sector Although
some spending for behavioral health treatment
occurs in the general health sector, most treat-
ment spending goes to providers that are spe-
cially trained and organized to treat behavioral
health conditions. These providers include psy-
chiatrists, other professionals (clinical social
workers and psychologists), psychiatric and
chemical dependency hospitals, specialty psy-
chiatric units in general hospitals, and specialty
mental health and substance abuse centers.
The share of mental health spending for spe-
cialty providers changed little over the study
period--70 percent in 1986 and 76 percent in
2005. For substance abuse, 80 percent of spend-
ing went to specialty providers in 1986. By 1992
this share rose to 87 percent, and remained rel-
atively stable (86­88 percent) through 2005.

Discussion
As these spending estimates demonstrate, not
only are behavioral health disorders serious
and prevalent, but spending on behavioral
health treatment also constitutes a large,
although declining, share of the overall health
care economy. However, behavioral health
spending must be evaluated not only in dollar
terms but also in the context of the need for and
access to treatment.
From the 1980s through the mid-2000s, the
prevalence of psychiatric disorders remained
constant, while rates of psychiatric treatment
grew tremendously.12­15 For example, the per-
centage of severely mentally ill people receiving
treatment grew from 24 percent in the period
1990­92 to 41 percent in the period 2001­03,
and the percentage with any disorder receiving
treatment increased from 12 percent to
20 percent.13

totals because of rounding. aSpending for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP) is distributed across "Medicaid," "other
federal," and "other state and local" categories, depending on whether the program was run through Medicaid or as a separate
state program. bThe "other federal" category consists of federal block grants ($1,265 million for substance abuse and
$386 million for mental health in 2005) and spending by the Department of Veterans Affairs and the Department of Defense,
among others. cIncludes this payer's share of Medicaid.

Thus, underlying the growth in treatment
spending are improvements in access to needed
treatment. In particular, a large portion of the
increase in psychiatric treatment rates stems
from more people using psychiatric medica-
tions, which was stimulated in turn by the intro-
duction of more effective psychiatric drugs with
fewer side effects.12
Amid the declining cost of psychiatric medica-
tions because of the broader use of generics, the
cost of increased access has also been declining.
The declining cost of psychiatric drugs may also
suggest that third-party payers revisit cost con-
trols on psychiatric medications, such as step
therapy and prior authorization, which have
been shown in some studies to limit medication
use and increase medical care use and costs.16,17
Recession And Policy Changes Although the
estimates presented here end at 2005, they are
still relevant in the context of recent economic
and policy changes--in particular, the recession,
the Parity Act, and the Affordable Care Act.
The Parity Act interim final regulations went
into effect April 2010, affecting all new health
plans after July 2010. The law allows employers
to request an exemption from the parity require-
ments for the next year if they can demonstrate
that the parity law resulted in a 2 percent in-
crease in total costs for medical, surgical, mental
health, and substance use disorder treatment in
the first year after implementation (1 percent in
subsequent years).
We find that spending on behavioral health
treatment constituted 4.8 percent of private
health insurance benefits in 2005 and grew by
7 percent from 2004 to 2005. If one simulates a
growth rate increase in behavioral spending of
four times that amount, or 28 percent, behav-
ioral health still would have raised total private
insurance expenditures by only 1 percent. Thus,
the estimates indicate that it is unlikely that most
employers will be able to seek a cost exemption
from the Parity Act.
The recession has led many states to cut Medic-
aid reimbursement and services, at the same
time as it has caused a surge in Medicaid enroll-
ment.18 Our estimate that behavioral health
spending accounts for 11.5 percent of overall
Medicaid spending, paired with insurance prac-
tices that are more likely to limit behavioral
health than medical or surgical services, sug-
gests that behavioral health may offer a tempting
target for state spending cuts. Moreover, many
services needed by people with mental illnesses,
such as supportive employment and case man-
agement, are considered optional benefits under
Medicaid.
Although Medicaid programs are reducing
reimbursement and services in response to the
recession, they arerestricted from cutting enroll-
ment since the enactment of the Affordable Care
Act on March 23, 2010. In contrast, states can cut
back on health care services funded solely
though general funds. Because substance abuse
financing is more dependent on state general
funds than on Medicaid, addiction services
may be particularly vulnerable to recession-
driven cutbacks.
Although not implemented until 2014, the
Medicaid expansions under the Affordable Care
Act may be of particular benefit to those with
addictions and mental illnesses. Because mental
illness and substance abuse are more prevalent
among people with limited resources, and be-
cause the conditions often lead to diminished
income, employment opportunities, and insur-
ance coverage, the most vulnerable and severely
ill--who are often adults who are childless or
who have nondependent children--typically
have the least access to needed services.19
Few states offer Medicaid coverage to these
"childless" adults, and that is likely to remain
the case until 2014, when the Affordable Care
Act is fully phased in. As a result, childless adults
with addictions will continue to be excluded for a
while from Medicaid coverage. What's more,
many people with addictions lost Medicaid cov-
erage after 1996, when Congress acted to remove
substance dependence as a qualifying disability
for Supplemental Security Income. Until that
time, qualification for Supplemental Security In-
come had generally opened the door for Medic-
aid eligibility for people with addictions.
Analyses of the 2008 National Survey on Drug
Use and Health indicate that 4.9 million unin-
sured people were classified as having serious
psychological distress in the past year and that
5.5 million were classified as having substance
dependence or abuse disorders in the past year.
Thus, millions of people with mental illness and
substance use disorders could benefit from im-
proved access to insurance coverage.
Conclusion In summary, the past two decades
have been characterized by important shifts in
technology and in the use and financing of
behavioral health treatment. The recent reces-
sion as well as the full implementation of federal
parity law and health reform have the potential
to alterbehavioral health care dramatically in the
future. The spending estimates in this article
provide an important context for evaluating
the effect of those policies.

Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA) Block Grant Conference,
Washington, D.C., June 24, 2010. This
report was prepared by Thomson
Reuters (Healthcare) for SAMHSA, US
Department of Health and Human
Services (contract HHS-270-2006-000
23C). It is the result of substantial
contributions by numerous people and
organizations. Ellen Bouchery of the
Lewin Group produced the specialty
facility estimates. Edward King of
Actuarial Research Corporation
produced the estimates for other
providers, as well as the final total
estimates. David McKusick of Actuarial
Research Corporation developed the
methods used to estimate the
nonspecialty organizations. Tami Mark,
Elizabeth Stranges, Rosanna Coffey,
Katharine Levit, Cheryl Kassed, and
Katheryn Ryan of Thomson Reuters
provided coordination, monitored the
results, and drafted the report. Rita
Vandivort-Warren of SAMHSA and
Jeffrey Buck of the Centers for
Medicare and Medicaid Services guided
the work and provided many helpful
comments and suggestions. Experts in
mental health and substance abuse
treatment spending provided insights on
the policy relevance of the results.

Science Division of
Thomson Reuters,
in Washington, D.C.
Tami Mark and coauthors report in
this issue on trends in spending on
mental health and substance abuse
treatment in the United States
from 1986 to 2005. Among other
factors, the research highlights a
dramatic decline in psychiatric
drug spending growth, driven in
part by the availability of generic
forms of psychotropic medication.
Other findings, such as Medicaid's
growing role in financing mental
health and substance abuse, have
implications in light of the
Affordable Care Act and potential
policy changes.
The research represents a
collaboration between the
Substance Abuse and Mental
Health Services Administration
(SAMHSA), US Department of

1997 SAMHSA contracted with
Thomson Reuters to develop
national mental health and
substance abuse spending
estimates. The current paper is an
extension of that original work.
