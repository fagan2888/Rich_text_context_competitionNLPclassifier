Alcohol Use Disorders Among US College Students
and Their Non­College-Attending Peers
Wendy S. Slutske, PhD
Background: Heavy/binge drinking among college stu-
dents has become a major public health problem. There
is consistent evidence suggesting that young adults
in college are drinking more than their non­college-
attending peers, but it is still not clear whether they are
more likely to suffer from clinically significant alcohol
use disorders.
Objective: To compare the prevalence of alcohol use
disorders and alcohol use disorder symptoms in college-
attending young adults with their non­college-
attending peers within the same study in a large and rep-
resentative US national sample.
Design: Cross-sectional survey.
Setting: Civilian, noninstitutionalized US population.
Participants: Young adults (n=6352) from the 2001 Na-
tional Household Survey on Drug Abuse (19-21 years of
age, 51% female, 66% white, 14% African American, 14%
Hispanic).
Main Outcome Measures: Lifetime, past-year, and past-
month drinking, past-year and past-month weekly drink-
ing, past-month weekly binge drinking, past-month daily
drinking, typical quantity consumed in the past month,
and past-year DSM-IV alcohol dependence and abuse
diagnoses.
Results: Eighteen percent of US college students (24%
of men, 13% of women) suffered from clinically signifi-
cant alcohol-related problems in the past year, com-
pared with 15% of their non­college-attending peers (22%
of men, 9% of women; overall odds ratio=1.32). The as-
sociation between past-year alcohol use disorder and col-
lege attendance was stronger among women (odds ra-
tio=1.70) than men (odds ratio=1.14). College students
were more likely to receive a diagnosis of DSM-IV alco-
hol abuse than their peers not attending college; despite
the fact that those in college were drinking more, they
were not more likely to receive a diagnosis of DSM-IV
alcohol dependence.
Conclusions: College students suffer from some clini-
cally significant consequences of their heavy/binge drink-
ing, but they do not appear to be at greater risk than their
non­college-attending peers for the more pervasive syn-
drome of problems that is characteristic of alcohol de-
pendence.

HIGHLY PUBLICIZED RE-
ports have raised public
awareness about the high
ratesofheavy/bingedrink-
ing on college campuses.1
The US Surgeon General and the US De-
partment of Health and Human Services2,3
have identified binge drinking among col-
lege students as a major public health prob-
lem,3 andsomeexperts4 haveconcludedthat
binge drinking is the most serious public
health problem facing US colleges. A re-
cent report commissioned by the National
Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcohol-
ism3 estimated that alcohol is involved in
approximately1400studentdeaths,500000
injuries,600000assaults,and70000sexual
assaults each year on college campuses.5
The phenomenon of college student
drinking is not solely explained by the
higher rates of alcohol involvement among
young adults in general. Studies con-
ducted since 1988, when a uniform na-
tional legal drinking age of 21 years was
established in the United States, have
tended to find that college students are
more likely than their non­college-
attending peers to be engaged in heavy/
binge drinking.5-7 A natural question one
might ask is "Are college students also
more likely to be alcoholic8?"
Few direct comparisons have been
made of the prevalence of alcohol use dis-
orders of college students with their non­
college-attending peers within the same
study. In a sample of 608 Missouri-born
young adult women (identified for a popu-
lation-based female twin study), there were
no differences between the women in col-
lege and those not in college in the preva-

lence of either past-year alcohol abuse (6% vs 6%) or de-
pendence (9% vs 7%).7 A report from the 2002 National
Survey of Drug Use and Health stated that the rate of com-
bined past-year alcohol abuse or dependence was higher
among 22-year-old male and female full-time college stu-
dents (25%) than non-students (20%).9 The scant evi-
dence from these 2 studies is inconsistent concerning
whether college students are more likely to have a diag-
nosis of alcohol abuse or dependence. It is surprising,
given the relatively consistent evidence that college stu-
dents are drinking more than their non­college-
attending peers, that the results of at least one study sug-
gest that they do not have higher rates of alcohol use
disorders.
The purpose of this investigation was to compare the
prevalence of alcohol use disorders and alcohol use disor-
der symptoms in college-attending young adults with their
non­college-attending peers within the same study, in an
attempttoreexaminetheearlierparadoxicalfindingsofSlut-
ske et al7 in a larger and more representative US national
sample, and to explore whether there may be differences
between men and women in the association between col-
lege attendance and alcohol involvement.
METHODS
The data for this study were obtained from the public use data
set of the 2001 National Household Survey on Drug Abuse10
(NHSDA), an interview survey of 68929 individuals drawn from
the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population (including resi-
dents of group quarters, such as college dormitories). The par-
ticipation rate for the interview was 73%. To protect the con-
fidentiality of the participants, the public use file contained data
from 55561 individuals that were randomly sampled from the
original data set. Other steps were also taken to ensure confi-
dentiality, such as excluding particular variables from the pub-
lic use data set and collapsing response categories for certain
questions. The data collection procedures were approved by
the Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects at the Re-
search Triangle Institute.
PARTICIPANTS
Participants aged 19 to 21 years who completed the NHSDA in-
terview were selected for this study. The choice of this age range
wasbasedonseveralconsiderations.Becausethefocusofthestudy
was past-year alcohol use disorders, 18-year-old participants were
excluded to minimize capturing any alcohol-related problems
that occurred prior to college in the college-attending sub-
sample. Those older than 21 years were excluded to minimize
the inclusion of any college graduates in the non­college-
attending subsample. Finally, in an attempt to replicate the re-
sults of Slutske et al,7 the same age range was included. There
were 6352 respondents aged 19 to 21 years in the NHSDA sur-
vey who were identified as either currently attending college full-
or part-time (n=3184, 51%), or who were identified as not cur-
rentlyenrolledinschool(3168,49%).Themeanageofthesample
was 20 years (SE=0.02). Participants in college were slightly but
significantly younger than those who were not in college (in col-
lege, mean age=19.9 years; not in college, mean age=20.1 years;
t=-5.63, P.001). Forty-nine percent of the participants were
male and 51% were female. Other demographic characteristics
of the sample are summarized in Table 1.
MEASURES
Structured computer-assisted interviews for the NHSDA inter-
view were conducted by a nationwide staff of approximately
900 field interviewers. Most of the interview, including all of
the questions about alcohol involvement and alcohol use dis-
orders, was done using audio computer-assisted self-
interviews. Respondents listened to the questions read out loud
through headphones while reading the question text on a com-
puter screen. Respondents then keyed their numeric answers
into the computer. Prior to the interviews, respondents were
trained by the field interviewer in the use of the audio computer-
assisted self-interview system, and the field interviewer re-
mained in the room with the respondent throughout the in-
terview. This system was used to provide respondents with
privacy and to increase the likelihood that they would feel com-
fortable revealing sensitive information. A portion of the in-
terview, including the questions about demographic charac-
teristics, was administered as a computer-assisted personal
interview, in which the field interviewer read the questions out
loud from the computer screen and keyed in the responses. There
were 223 (3.9%) interviews conducted in Spanish. Informed
consent for participation was obtained from all respondents prior
to the survey.
ALCOHOL USE
Seven different dichotomous indicators of frequency of alco-
hol use were examined: lifetime, past-year and past-month use
of any alcohol, past-year and past-month drinking at least once
a week (on average), past-month binge drinking at least once
a week (on average), and past-month daily drinking. The past-
year and past-month measures of weekly or daily drinking were
derived from questions about the number of days in the past
year (0-365) or the past month (0-30) that the respondent drank
any alcohol. Drinking at least once a week in the past year was
based on the respondent reporting consuming alcohol on at least
52 days of the year. Drinking at least once a week in the past
month was based on the respondent reporting consuming al-
cohol on at least 4 days of the month. The past-month mea-
sure of weekly binge drinking was derived from a question about
the number of days in the past month that the respondent drank
at least 5 drinks on one occasion. Binge drinking at least once
a week in the past month was based on the respondent report-

ing consuming at least 5 drinks of alcohol on one occasion on
at least 4 days in the past month. Respondents who had con-
sumed alcohol in the past month were also asked about the typi-
cal quantity they consumed on the days that they drank in the
past month. This continuous indicator was log transformed to
reduce the positive skew of the distribution of responses.
ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS
Symptoms of past-year DSM-IV11 alcohol dependence and abuse
were assessed. Diagnoses of alcohol dependence required that
at least 3 of 7 dependence symptoms occurred in the past year.
Diagnoses of alcohol abuse required that at least 1 of 4 abuse
symptoms occurred in the past year (in other words, a diag-
nosis of alcohol abuse only required experiencing a single symp-
tom). Diagnoses of alcohol abuse were made only for individu-
als who did not meet the criteria for past-year alcohol
dependence. A combined diagnosis of alcohol use disorder
(DSM-IV alcohol dependence or abuse) was also examined. The
estimates of DSM-IV alcohol dependence or abuse obtained in
the present study (16.6% overall, 22.5% among men, and 11.0%
among women) were very similar to those obtained among the
18- to 29-year-old participants in the National Longitudinal Al-
cohol Epidemiologic Survey (16.2% overall, 22.4% among men,
and 10.1% among women) and the National Epidemiologic Sur-
vey on Alcohol and Related Conditions (15.9% overall, 22.1%
among men, and 9.8% among women).12
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
All of the analyses were conducted using the survey estimation
techniques in Stata Release 8.013 to account for the stratified sam-
plingemployedintheNHSDAandtoincorporatesamplingweights
associated with each observation. The sampling weights ad-
justed the final sample so that it was demographically matched
to the US census, and accounted for unequal participation rates
of certain demographic groups (including college dormitory resi-
dents). All of the sample percentages presented are based on the
weighted data, and therefore will not match percentages calcu-
lated from the unweighted sample sizes provided.
For categorical outcomes, the differences between those in
college and not in college were tested with logistic regression,
predicting the alcohol outcome from college attendance. For
the continuous outcome (typical quantity consumed), differ-
ences were tested with ordinary least squares regression. Sex
differences in the strength of the association between an alco-
hol outcome and college attendance was indicated by a signifi-
cant interaction of college attendance by sex in the regression
model. This method yields the same result as the Breslow-Day
test for the homogeneity of the odds ratio, but has the benefit
of allowing for the inclusion of control variables such as age in
the analysis. Because of the well-documented differences be-
tween men and women in their levels and rates of drinking and
prevalence of alcohol use disorders, the comparison results of
college students with their non­college-attending peers were
controlled for sex. Given the slight but significant difference
in ages of the participants in college and not in college, all of
the comparison results were also controlled for age.
RESULTS
DRINKING IN COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THEIR
NON­COLLEGE-ATTENDING PEERS
College students were no more or less likely than their
same-age peers not in college to be lifetime abstainers from
alcohol, but they exceeded their non­college-attending
peers on all of the other indicators of yearly, monthly,
and weekly alcohol use, as well as weekly binge drink-
ing (Table 2 and Table 3). Daily drinking, on the other
hand, was more common among the young adults not
in college.
Among young adults who drank any alcohol in the
past month, the average amount of alcohol consumed
on a day when they drank was 5.9 drinks (SE=0.23;
median = 5) for men and 3.8 drinks (SE = 0.12;
median=3) for women. There was not a significant dif-
ference between those in college and those not in col-
lege in the average number of drinks consumed, both
prior to data transformation (t=-0.97, 1 df, P=.33) as
well as after a log transformation of the scores (t=0.36,
1 df, P=.72).
Formal tests of sex differences revealed that the as-
sociations between college attendance and any alcohol
use in the past month (t=4.27, 1 df, P.001) and drink-
ing at least once a week in the past year (t=2.05, 1 df,
P=.045) and in the past month (t=2.19, 1 df, P=.033)
were significantly stronger among women than men
(Table 3). The associations of the remaining indicators
of alcohol use with college attendance did not differ for
men and women; there were no instances in which al-
cohol use was more strongly associated with college at-
tendance among men than women.

ALCOHOL USE DISORDERS
IN COLLEGE STUDENTS AND THEIR
NON­COLLEGE-ATTENDING PEERS
College-attending young adults were significantly more
likely to be diagnosed with an alcohol use disorder (de-
pendenceorabuse)thantheirnon­college-attendingpeers
(18.0% vs 15.1%; t=3.25, 1 df, P=.002). However, there
was not a significant difference between college-
attending and non­college-attending young adults in the
prevalence of past-year alcohol dependence (6.1% vs 6.6%;
t=-0.25, 1 df, P=.80; Table 2 and Table 4). Although
there was not a difference in the prevalence of alcohol
dependence as a whole, young adults in college were sig-
nificantly more likely than those not in college to report
2 of the 7 symptoms of alcohol dependence: tolerance
and spending a great deal of time over a period of a month
obtaining, using, or getting over the effects of alcohol.
Withdrawal was one symptom of alcohol dependence that
the young adults in college were significantly less likely
to report than those not in college.
Young adults in college were significantly more likely
to be diagnosed with alcohol abuse than their non­
college-attending peers (11.9% vs 8.5%; t=6.86, 1 df,
P.001), and they were also more likely to have expe-
rienced 2 of the 4 symptoms of alcohol abuse in the past

year: having serious problems at home, work, or school
that were caused by alcohol, and regularly using alco-
hol and then participating in an activity that might be
physically dangerous.
Formal tests of sex differences revealed a signifi-
cantly stronger association between college attendance
and the combined diagnosis of alcohol dependence or al-
cohol abuse (t=2.06, 1 df, P=.04) and the alcohol abuse
symptom of having serious problems at home, work, or
school that were caused by alcohol (t=2.31, 1 df, P=.02)
among women than men. The associations of the remain-
ing diagnoses and symptoms with college attendance did
not differ for men and women; there were no diagnoses
or symptoms that were more strongly associated with col-
lege attendance among men than women.
PROBING THE (LACK OF) ASSOCIATION
BETWEEN COLLEGE ATTENDANCE AND
ALCOHOL DEPENDENCE
Even if the heavy drinking at college contributes to the
development of alcohol dependence, the problems may
take several years to develop. Therefore, differences
between college students and their non­college-
attending peers may not become evident until later
years in school. This possibility was evaluated by exam-
ining whether the prevalence of alcohol dependence
was higher among college students in their later years
in school compared with those in their first year.
Between both college-attending men and women, the
prevalence of alcohol dependence was nearly identical
across the college years (men: t=0.10, 1 df, P=.92;
women: t=-0.18, 1 df, P=.86).
Failure to find a difference in the prevalence of alco-
hol dependence between those in college and those not
in college may be due to the fact that the individuals suf-
fering from alcohol problems are more likely to drop out
of college, and therefore not remain in the college stu-
dent subsample. Among the young adults who were not
currently attending college, alcohol dependence was not
more prevalent among the 239 men who had previously
attended some college compared with the 1297 men with
no previous college (t=-0.07, 1 df, P=.94), and among
the 293 women who had previously attended some col-
lege compared to the 1339 women with no previous col-
lege (t=-1.38, 1 df, P=.18).
The failure to find a difference in the prevalence of
alcohol dependence between those in college and those
not in college might be due to the inclusion of nontra-
ditional part-time students in the college-attending sub-
sample. Among both the men and women who were
currently attending college, alcohol dependence was
not more prevalent among the full-time vs the part-time
students (men: t=-0.46, 1 df, P=.65; women: t=0.61, 1
df, P=.54), and there still were not significant differ-
ences between college-attending and non­college-
attending men (odds ratio=0.79, t=-1.24, df=1, P=.22)
or women (odds ratio=1.32, t=1.37, df=1, P=.18) in
the prevalence of past-year alcohol dependence when
part-time students were excluded from the college-
attending subsample.
COMMENT
In a large representative national sample, 18% of US col-
lege students (24% of men, 13% of women) suffered from
clinically significant alcohol-related problems in the past
year, compared with 15% of their non­college-
attending peers (22% of men, 9% of women). College stu-
dents were more likely to receive a diagnosis of DSM-IV
alcohol abuse than their peers not in college, but de-
spite the fact that those in college were drinking more,
they were not more likely to receive a diagnosis of DSM-IV
alcohol dependence.
Several possible explanations were explored for the
lack of a difference in the prevalence of alcohol depen-
dence among those in college vs those not in college. The
lack of a difference could not be explained by the fact
that some college students in their earlier years in school
may not have had adequate time to develop problems,
nor could it be explained by differential drop-out rates
of those with alcohol dependence from college, or by the
inclusion of nontraditional part-time students in the col-
lege student subsample.
The results of this study are consistent with the sug-
gestion of Slutske et al7 that college attendance may be
associated with experiencing some consequences of drink-
ing to a greater extent than others and that it may not
necessarily be related to a more pervasive syndrome of
problems that is required for a diagnosis of alcohol de-
pendence. This might be because certain symptoms are
not as relevant or noticeable against the backdrop of the
college environment, or because college provides a buffer
against experiencing certain alcohol-related problems,
compared to life outside of the college context. In addi-
tion, there were some symptoms that were actually less
common among those in college than their non­college-
attending peers, which also may have contributed to the
lack of a difference for alcohol dependence as a whole.
The emerging picture of the relationship between al-
cohol involvement and educational status and educa-
tional attainment is complex. As previously illustrated
byresultsfromtheEpidemiologicCatchmentAreastudy,14
there may not be a simple linear relation between years
of education and the probability of drinking or having
an alcohol use disorder. For example, during high school,
those who are college bound drink less than those who
do not go on to college7,14-17; substance use disorders are
associated with the failure to enter college among high
school graduates.18 However, college students drink more
than their non­college-attending peers during the college-
age years.5-7 Lifetime alcohol use disorders are higher
among those who attended some college but did not
graduate compared with those who graduated from high
school but had no college14 and those who graduated from
college.14,19 Those who attend college drink more5-7 and
have higher rates of alcohol abuse than their non­college-
attending peers during college (present study), but col-
lege graduates have the lowest rates of lifetime alcohol
use disorders.14,19,20
This complicated array of findings suggests another
possible explanation for the lack of a difference in the
prevalence of alcohol dependence among those in col-

lege vs those not in college. Samples of college students
do not include two groups most at risk for alcohol use
disorders, those who fail to graduate from high school
and those who do not enter college. Thus, there may
be opposing forces at work: the association of alcohol
use disorders and the failure to graduate from high
school or to enter college, and the association of alcohol
use disorders and heavy drinking in college. These
combined opposing forces may sum to an overall lack
of differences in alcohol dependence between those
who attend college and those who do not,7 and may
also explain why daily alcohol use and some alcohol
use disorder symptoms, such as withdrawal, are actu-
ally more common among those not in college than
those in college.
The results of this study raise several important ques-
tions that warrant further investigation. First, why do col-
lege students have higher rates of alcohol abuse than their
non­college-attending peers? There is some evidence to
suggest that the association between college attendance
and heavy/binge drinking can be explained by system-
atic differences between college students and their non­
college-attending peers on factors such as race, family in-
come, marital status, or living arrangement.7,21 Other
indicators of college student drinking (such as the fre-
quency of getting drunk,7 the maximum quantity of al-
cohol consumed in a single day,7 and driving under the
influence of alcohol22) cannot be completely explained
by such factors. For example, in a study of 73 young adult
female twin pairs discordant for attending college (a study
design that provides an ideal control for any family back-
ground characteristics that might explain the associa-
tion between college attendance and alcohol involve-
ment), the college-attending twin exceeded her non­
college-attending co-twin by nearly one half of a standard
deviation on the maximum amount of alcohol that she
had consumed in a single day in the past year.7 Such re-
sults are consistent with the conclusion that some as-
pect of the college experience may be an important en-
vironmental risk factor for certain aspects of drinking
among young adults.7 It will be important to determine
whether the same is true for alcohol abuse. Nearly two
thirds (62%) of recent high school graduates enrolled in
college in 2001.23 If some aspect of the college experi-
ence is a risk factor for the development of clinically sig-
nificant alcohol use disorders, then it is a risk factor to
which many of the young adults in the United States are
potentially exposed.
Second, why is the increased risk of alcohol use dis-
order associated with college attendance higher among
women than men? It is unclear whether this can be in-
terpreted as a more potent effect of the college environ-
ment on women than on men, whether it is better
explained by greater differences between college-
attending vs non­college-attending women than be-
tween college-attending vs non­college-attending men
on drinking-related background characteristics, or
whether it is better explained by the roles that relatively
more non­college-attending women than non­college-
attending men have assumed by their college-age years
that might be related to reduced drinking (such as mar-
riage or parenthood).
Third, are the alcohol use disorders that occur among
college students more or less transitory than those ex-
perienced by their non­college-attending peers? Al-
though it is generally assumed that the alcohol-related
problems among young adults are developmentally lim-
ited,24 it is clear that a substantial fraction continue to
have problems beyond the college-age years. Among the
18- to 19-year-old young adults from a college-based and
a community-based longitudinal study who were diag-
nosed with an alcohol use disorder, 43%24 and 55%,25 re-
spectively, had an alcohol use disorder when followed
up at age 25 years. To date, there are no longitudinal stud-
ies that have examined the relative persistence of alco-
hol use disorders of college students vs those of their non­
college-attending peers.
The results of this study provide a more encouraging
message about the consequences of college drinking than
many of the recent reports--although college students
suffer from some clinically significant consequences of
their heavy/binge drinking, they do not appear to be at
greater risk than their non-college attending peers for the
more pervasive syndrome of problems that is character-
istic of alcohol dependence. Unfortunately, the alcohol-
related problems that are associated with college often
lead to some of the most dire consequences. For ex-
ample, about 75% of the 1400 alcohol-related deaths
among college students each year are due to the alcohol
abuse symptom of being under the influence of alcohol
when it is physically hazardous, that is, while driving a
car.5,22 Furthermore, such hazardous use does not just
imperil the life of the college student, but also the lives
of other passengers, and anyone else sharing the road.
The consequences of college student alcohol use disor-
ders extend well beyond the college campus.
