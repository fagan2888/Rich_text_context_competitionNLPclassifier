Abstract
Objective: To investigate the clinical significance of cadherin 13 (CDH13) gene promoter
methylation in the serum of patients with prostate cancer.
Methods: This prospective study examined the methylation status of CDH13 in serum samples
obtained from patients with primary prostate cancer and age-matched control subjects, using
methylation-specific polymerase chain reaction. Associations between methylation status of
CDH13 and various clinicopathological features and patient survival were evaluated.
Results: A total of 98 patients with prostate cancer and 47 control subjects were enrolled in the
study. CDH13 promoter methylation was detected in 44 out of 98 (44.9%) patients with prostate
cancer; no methylation was found in control subjects. Methylation of CDH13 was significantly
associated with an increased Gleason score, an advanced tumour stage, and a high prostate-specific
antigen level. CDH13 methylation was associated with a worse survival outcome and a relative risk
of death of 6.132 (95% confidence interval: 3.160, 12.187).
Conclusions: Promoter methylation of CDH13 occurred frequently in the serum of patients with
prostate cancer, was associated with an increased risk of death, and may become a useful
independent predictor of a poor prognosis.

Introduction
Prostate cancer is one of the most prevalent
malignancies, a significant contributor to
morbidity and a leading cause of cancer-
related death in men in the United States of
America, with an estimated 238 590 new
cases and 29 720 deaths in 2013.1 The level
of prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in serum
is commonly used for diagnosis, monitoring
and prognosis, although the PSA assay is
not particularly accurate.2 The survival rate
of patients with prostate cancer is decreased
with tumour progression, despite advances
in clinical surveillance and treatment strate-
gies.2 In addition to the use of conventional
clinicopathological features, molecular bio-
markers are needed, particularly those that
are associated with the malignant behaviour
of prostate cancer, in order to provide the
most accurate diagnostic and prognostic
information.
Like many other malignancies, prostate
cancer is a complicated tumour that arises
from progressive genetic and epigenetic alter-
ations.3 DNA methylation of selected gene
promoters is recognized as the most common
epigenetic change in prostate cancer.4,5 As
observed in other human cancers, DNA
methylation of tumour suppressor gene pro-
moters might be detected through analyses of
DNA from serum.4,5 This might result in the
development of new methods for measuring
tumour biomarkers, which could then be
used to provide better screening, diagnosis,
prognosis, and treatment strategies.
There has been a marked increase in the
level of interest in DNA methylation of
human cancers.6,7 DNA methylation can be
detected not only in tumour samples but
also in various body fluids such as blood,
serum or plasma.4,5 It is well known that
DNA fragments are frequently and abun-
dantly found in the serum of cancer patients
(including patients with prostate cancer),
and the detection of circulating tumour-
related methylated DNA may be used as a
potential biomarker for the diagnosis, sur-
veillance and prognosis of patients with
prostate cancer.8­10
Cadherin 13 (CDH13), a member of the
cadherin family, plays a crucial role in cell­
cell adhesion.11 Changes in CDH13 gene
expression have been reported to be asso-
ciated with tumour behaviour in some
human tumours.11­13 Recent studies have
highlighted the role of the CDH13 gene as a
tumour suppressor in various human cancers
such as lung cancer, bladder cancer, breast
cancer and malignant melanoma.11­13 The
human CDH13 gene is mapped to 16q23.3 on
chromosome 16, which is often inactivated
by promoter methylation.11 Promoter
methylation of the CDH13 gene in patients
with prostate cancer has been reported,14,15
but the clinical significance of CDH13 pro-
moter methylation detected in the serum of
patients with prostate cancer remains unclear.
In the current study, methylation-specific
polymerase chain reaction (MSP) was used
to detect the methylation status of the
CDH13 gene promoter in serum-derived
DNA from patients with prostate cancer
and age-matched control subjects. The clin-
ical significance of the methylation status
was determined by analysing the correl-
ations with clinicopathological features and
disease outcomes.
Patients and methods
Patients and specimens
This prospective study enrolled consecutive
patients with primary prostate cancer who

Third Hospital of Hebei Medical
University, Shijiazhuang, Hebei Province,
China, between May 2005 and May 2007.
Inclusion criteria were: first histopatho-
logical diagnosis of prostate cancer by
prostate biopsy; no history of other malig-
nant tumours. Histological grading of each
tumour was determined according to the
Gleason score;16 disease stage was
determined according to the clinical
tumour­node­metastasis classification
system of the American Joint Committee
on Cancer (T1
to T4
),17 and the treatment
strategy used for each patient was accord-
ing to international guidelines.18 Patients
were followed up according to inter-
national guidelines.18 The control group
consisted of inpatients with benign pros-
tatic hyperplasia (BPH), patients with
bladder stones and healthy volunteers
who were attending the same hospital.
Controls were age-matched with prostate
cancer patients and provided whole-blood
samples for serum production. The inclu-
sion criteria for the control subjects were:
no history of malignant tumours; serum
PSA concentration <4 ng/ml.
Whole peripheral blood samples (5 ml)
were obtained, prior to any treatment, from
both the patients and control subjects. These
samples were then left at room temperature
for 2 h to coagulate, centrifuged at 3000 g for
10 min using an HeraeusTM LabofugeTM 400
centrifuge (Thermo Fisher Scientific,
Rockford, IL, USA), and the serum was
removed and stored at À80C until analysis.
Serum PSA concentrations were determined
using a PSA enzyme immunoassay kit
(Beijing Sanyuan Gene Engineering,
Beijing, China) according to the manufac-
turer's instructions.
The study was conducted in accordance
with the Declaration of Helsinki and
approved by the Ethics Committee of the
Third Hospital of Hebei Medical University
(registration no. HBMETH20050111E).
Written informed consent was obtained
from all study participants.
DNA extraction and MSP
DNA was extracted from 500 ml of serum
(QIAmp DNA Blood Mini Kit; Qiagen,
Valencia, CA, USA), then treated with
bisulphite to convert any unmethylated
(but not methylated) cytosine residues to
uracil (EpiTect Bisulfite Kit; Qiagen) as
previously reported.19 The methylation
status of the CDH13 gene was examined
using MSP, as described previously.13,20
Briefly, the primers for the methylated reac-
tion were as follows: CDH13 methylated
sense, 50-TCGC
GGGGTTCGTTTTTCGC-30, and
CDH13 methylated antisense, 50-GACGT
TTTCATTCATACACGCG-30, which
amplify a 243-base pair (bp) product
(Shanghai Sangon Biological Engineering
Technology & Services, Shanghai, China).
The primer sequences of CDH13 for the
unmethylated reaction were as follows:
CDH13 unmethylated sense, 50-TTGTG
GGGTTGTTTTTTGT-30, and CDH13
unmethylated antisense, 50-AACTTTTC
ATTCATACACACA-30, which amplify a
242-bp product (Shanghai Sangon
Biological Engineering Technology &
Services). The PCR reactions were carried
out using ZymoTaqTM DNA polymerase
and ZymoTaqTM PreMix (Zymo Research
Corporation, Irvine, CA, USA) in a thermal
cycler (BD Biosciences, Hercules, CA,
USA). PCR amplification of the modified
DNA samples consisted of preliminary
denaturation at 95C for 5 min, followed
by 33 cycles of denaturation at 95C for 30 s,
annealing at 60C for 1 min, and elongation
at 72C for 1 min for the unmethylated
reaction; or 29 cycles of denaturation at
95C for 30 s, annealing at 70C for 1 min,
and elongation at 72C for 1 min for the
methylated reaction; followed by a final
elongation step at 72C for 5 min.
Wang et al. 1087
Normal lymphocyte DNA methylated
in vitro with CpG methyltransferase (SssI
methylase; New England Biolabs, Beverly,
MA, USA) was used as a methylation
positive control, and normal lymphocyte
DNA was used as an unmethylation positive
control. Water blanks were included within
each assay. The PCR products were sepa-
rated in 2% agarose gel, stained with eth-
idium bromide, and visualized under
ultraviolet illumination. Samples were
scored as methylation positive when methy-
lated alleles were present in the methylated
DNA lane and methylation negative when
bands were present only in the unmethylated
DNA lane.13,20
Statistical analyses
All statistical analyses were performed
using the SASÕ statistical package, version
8.0 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA). For
statistical purposes, serum samples were
divided into two tumour-grade categories
(Gleason score 7 versus >7); patients
were categorized by age groups (<65
versus !65 years) and according to the
serum PSA levels (<10 versus !10 ng/
ml).21 Fisher's exact test was used to
evaluate the difference in the CDH13
gene methylation status between patients
with prostate cancer and control subjects.
2-test was used to assess the correlations
between CDH13 methylation and clinico-
pathological features of disease. Kaplan­
Meier survival analysis and log-rank test
were used to assess the difference in 5-year
overall survival between patients with pros-
tate cancer with methylated and unmethy-
lated CDH13. Multivariate Cox
proportional hazard model analysis was
used to estimate the independent prognos-
tic effect of CDH13 methylation, control-
ling for the classic risk factors of age,
tumour stage, Gleason score and PSA. A
two-sided P-value <0.05 was considered to
indicate statistical significance.
Results
This study analysed the methylation status
of the CDH13 gene in serum samples col-
lected from 98 patients with prostate cancer
and 47 age-matched control subjects using
MSP. In the patient group, 20 patients were
stage T1
, 23 patients were stage T2
, 41
patients were stage T3
, and 14 patients
were stage T4
at diagnosis. In the control
group, 27 patients had BPH, 11 had bladder
stones and nine were healthy volunteers.
The MSP analysis found that CDH13
promoter methylation was detected in 44/98
(44.9%) patients with prostate cancer, while
no methylation was found in the control
subjects (P < 0.0001; Fisher's exact test).
Representative MSP results are shown in
Figure 1. The detailed clinicopathological
features of the patients with prostate cancer
are shown in Table 1. Analysis of the
association between the methylation status
of CDH13 and the demographic, clinical
and pathological features demonstrated that
CDH13 methylation in serum was signifi-
cantly associated with an increased Gleason
score (P ¼ 0.0395), an advanced tumour
stage (P ¼ 0.0001), and a high PSA level
(P ¼ 0.0071); there was no significant asso-
ciation between CDH13 methylation and
age (Table 1).
Survival data were available from all
patients with prostate cancer. Overall sur-
vival was defined as the time from date of
diagnosis until date of death from any cause,
or last contact if the patient was still alive
(range: 9­60 months). When the methyla-
tion status of the CDH13 gene promoter was
correlated with the overall survival of
patients with prostate cancer, patients with
unmethylated CDH13 had better outcomes
than patients with methylated CDH13
(P ¼ 0.0002; Figure 2). In addition, multi-
variate Cox proportional hazard model
analysis was carried out to estimate the
independent prognostic effect of CDH13
methylation, controlling for the classic risk
factors of age, tumour stage, Gleason score

and PSA. Multivariate analysis indicated
that CDH13 methylation was independently
associated with a worse outcome and had a
relative risk of death of 6.132 (95% confi-
dence interval 3.160, 12.187; P ¼ 0.0073;
Table 2).
Discussion
Previous studies have described the import-
ance of DNA methylation in human can-
cers, with aberrant DNA methylation in the
promoter regions of tumour suppressor
genes at cytosine-phosphate-guanine islands
being recognized as one of the hallmarks of
human cancers, and associated with the
downregulation of gene expression.22
Aberrant DNA methylation can be evalu-
ated both in tissue samples and body fluids,
especially in serum; serum contains abun-
dant tumour-specific DNA fragments in
cancer patients.23 Testing DNA methyla-
tion in serum has the advantages of high
sensitivity, noninvasiveness, low cost, and
suitability for routine clinical applica-
tion.10,19,21,24 Moreover, MSP is a simple,
sensitive, specific and cost-effective method,
and is the most commonly employed
method for DNA methylation ana-
lysis.10,19,21,24 In the current study, MSP

the CDH13 gene promoter in the serum of
patients with prostate cancer compared with
control subjects in order to evaluate its
clinical significance.
Studies have demonstrated that the
CDH13 gene functions as a tumour sup-
pressor in various human cancers; down-
regulation of CDH13 gene expression was
associated with malignant behaviours of
human cancers, and the introduction of
CDH13 into human cancer cells can reduce
their malignant potential.11 Previous studies
have demonstrated that aberrant DNA
methylation is the main mechanism of the
inactivation of CDH13 in human cancers.11
Alumkal et al.25 demonstrated that the
methylation of CDH13 in tumour samples

was independently associated with an
increased risk of biochemical recurrence
after radical prostatectomy; where biochem-
ical recurrence was defined as the
measurement of two successive values of
serum PSA !0.2 ng/ml after initial treat-
ment. Such findings suggest that CDH13
methylation may play a crucial role in
prostate cancer, which provides the ration-
ale for undertaking this present study, to
evaluate the clinical significance of CDH13
methylation in the serum of patients with
prostate cancer.
In the current study, the methylation of
CDH13 in serum specimens from patients
with prostate cancer and control subjects
was analysed using MSP. The analysis
demonstrated that CDH13 methylation
occurred frequently in patients with prostate
cancer, while no methylation was found in
the control subjects. Moreover, CDH13
methylation was also observed in patients
with stage T1
/T2
disease. These current
findings suggest that CDH13 methylation is
tumour specific and an early event during the
pathogenesis of prostate cancer. The results
indicated that CDH13 methylation was
associated with an increased Gleason score,
an advanced tumour stage, and a high serum
PSA level, suggesting that CDH13 methyla-
tion in serum is correlated with the clinical
risk factors of death. In addition, the 5-year
overall survival of patients with prostate
cancer was examined according to the
methylation status of CDH13 in serum.
CDH13 methylation was associated with
adverse 5-year overall survival. Moreover,
multivariate Cox proportional hazard model
analysis indicated that the methylation of
CDH13 was independently associated with a
statistically significant increased risk of
death (hazard ratio 6.132; 95% confidence
interval 3.160, 12.187; P ¼ 0.0073). Thus,
determination of CDH13 methylation in
serum may convey relevant prognostic infor-
mation and may become a useful predictor
of disease outcomes in the future.
In conclusion, aberrant CDH13 pro-
moter methylation in serum correlates with
the clinical risk factors of death and was
significantly associated with a worse disease
outcome. Current findings suggest that aber-
rant CDH13 promoter methylation may be
used as a novel biomarker and a potential
therapeutic target for prostate cancer.
However, this present study was limited by
a small sample size, and future multicentre
studies with larger sample sizes are needed,
to confirm whether CDH13 promoter
methylation in serum could be used as a
novel predictor of overall survival in
patients with prostate cancer.
