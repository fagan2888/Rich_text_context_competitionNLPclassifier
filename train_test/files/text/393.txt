Development and Initial Testing of a Measure
of Person-Directed Care
Diana L. White, PhD,1 Linda Newton-Curtis, MS,2 and
Karen S. Lyons, PhD3
Purpose: The purpose of the study was to empirically
test items of a new measure designed to assess
person-directed care (PDC) practices in long-term
care. Design and Methods: After reviewing the
literature, we identified five areas related to PDC:
personhood, comfort care, autonomy, knowing the
person, and support for relationships. We also
identified an additional component of environmental
support. We developed items to reflect the constructs,
and then a series of lay and professional experts in
the field reviewed the items for face validity. We
distributed the resulting 64-item PDC and Environ-
mental Support for PDC measure to direct care
workers and nursing, administrative, and other staff
from a range of long-term settings across Oregon,
culminating in a sample size of 430 participants from
eight sites. We employed exploratory factor analyses
to reveal the underlying structure of the measure.
Results: After we dropped 14 items from the mea-
sure, it attained good simple structure, revealing five
PDC constructs as previously theorized and three
Environmental Support constructs: Support for Work
With Residents; Person-Directed Environment for
Residents, and Management/Structural Support. All
constructs were conceptually distinct and internally
consistent, and, as expected, all were positively
correlated. Implications: The PDC measurement
tool developed through the Better Jobs Better Care
demonstration program funded by the Atlantic
Philanthropies and Robert Wood Johnson Foundation
is an important step toward operationalizing the
philosophies inherent in the concepts of PDC and is
expected to be a useful tool in evaluating successes in
meeting PDC goals and in prompting further research
regarding PDC and its consequences for resident and
client outcomes.

Concerns about long-term care began decades
ago. One response was the Nursing Home Reform
Act, passed as part of the Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act of 1987. This stressed the
physical, mental, and psychosocial well-being of
each resident and increased government regulation as
a strategy to improve quality care (Winzelberg,
2003). As concerns continued, new models of
community-based care emerged, such as assisted
living facilities, adult foster care, residential care, and
model programs such as the Program of All-Inclusive
Care for the Elderly (Eng, Pedulla, Eleazer, McCann,
& Fox, 1997; Kane, Kane, Illston, Nyman, & Finch,
1991; Park, Zimmerman, Sloane, Gruber-Baldini, &
Eckert, 2006). In spite of these developments, health
professionals, service providers, older adults, and
family members have continued to challenge long-
term care practices. Talerico, O'Brien, and Swafford
(2003) described care as too often being an ``in-
dustrialized, assembly line model of care'' (p. 15)
emphasizing organizational routine, staff needs, and
regulatory concerns over the needs and preferences
of residents. Such practices are characterized as
depersonalizing and disempowering both for those
who receive care and for the direct care workers
(DCWs) who, after family, are those who are most
intimately involved in providing care. As examples,
personal care such as bathing is scheduled by staff
with limited attention to resident preferences; meal
services are regimented, with limited resident choices
with respect to when, where, what, and with whom
to eat; and too little attention is given to nurturing
relationships among residents or between residents
and staff.
More recently, multiple providers, policy makers,
and researchers have offered alternatives to this
institutional approach with the aim of improving

quality of life and quality of care. These efforts to
transform the way society cares for and supports
those who are disabled or infirm have occurred in
hospital settings (e.g., Coyle & Williams, 2001;
Frampton, Gilpin, & Charmel, 2003), within the
disabled community (e.g., O'Brien & O'Brien, 2002;
Smull & Lakin, 2002), and within long-term care
(e.g., Kane, 2001; Lustbader, 2001; Noelker & Harel,
2001; Stone et al., 2002; Weiner & Ronch, 2003).
Particular attention has been given to supporting
people with dementia (e.g., Beck et al., 2002;
Kitwood, 1997; Rader, 1995; Ryden & Feldt, 1992;
Sabat, 2001).
As a result of these collective efforts, experts have
proposed or developed new models of long-term
care, including the Wellspring Model, Eden Alter-
native, Green House Project, Live Oak Regenerative
Community, and others. At the federal level, the
Veterans Affairs administration sponsored a national
summit on culture change in 2005, and the Centers
for Medicare & Medicaid Services are supporting
work in culture change (Bowman & Schoeneman,
2006). The Pioneer Network, a movement that began
in the 1990s, is an umbrella organization supporting
the development and implementation of these
``culture change'' models (Fagan, 2003; Lustbader,
2001). Through this collective work, a new paradigm
of person-centered care is emerging that stresses the
uniqueness and worth of each individual and the
necessity to be respectful and reflective of individu-
als' distinct histories, values, and preferences in
designing long-term care environments and in pro-
viding care.
The practice models described previously depend
on a stable and educated workforce (Rader &
Semradek, 2003; Stone, 2001; Stone, Dawson, &
Harahan, 2004). Yet, for multiple reasons, long-term
care systems face significant shortages of staff and
high turnover at all levels. The Better Jobs Better
Care (BJBC) program, funded by the Atlantic
Philanthropies and the Robert Wood Johnson
Foundation and administered by the Institute for
the Future of Aging Services, was developed to
address the looming long-term care workforce crisis
by attending to the needs of DCWs and building
work environments that will support both workers
and those they serve. Oregon received of one of five
demonstration grants.
The overarching goal of the Oregon BJBC
initiative was to instill a person-centered philosophy
of care and to operationalize that philosophy
through person-directed care (PDC) practices in
a range of long-term care settings. The project
identified four objectives to help accomplish this
goal: (a) to improve relationships between DCWs
and their supervisors, (b) to improve relationships
between DCWs and residents/clients and their
families, (c) to provide opportunities for career
development, and (d) to increase workforce diversity
and support for diversity. Loosely modeled after the
Wellspring model (Stone et al., 2002), each partici-
pating organization identified a site coordinator
responsible for project implementation. They de-
veloped a practice site team consisting of DCWs,
supervisors, and others who would determine how
objectives would be met at their organization. All
Oregon BJBC site coordinators met monthly, usually
with their practice teams, to receive training and
resources specific to project objectives. Consultation
was available to each site from the BJBC project
manager. Each practice site received $75,000 over the
3 years of the grant to support BJBC activities as
determined by that site.
A local evaluation team assessed success in
meeting project goals and objectives. Because PDC
was a central concept, it was imperative to measure
the extent to which each organization was using
PDC practices. This proved challenging; a cohesive
definition or even agreed-upon terms related to these
concepts had not yet emerged (Lauver, Ward, et al.,
2002; Packer, 2000). Although the term person-
directed care is used to denote the action of
providing support to those in care, other terms
have also been used, sometimes interchangeably,
including person-centered planning, person- or
resident-centered care, or individualized care. We
elected to use the term person directed because of
our emphasis on the person himself or herself
controlling or guiding care regardless of disability.
We found no existing instruments that captured the
kinds of dimensions that experts in person-centered
and person-directed practice were providing to the
Oregon BJBC practice sites. Therefore, we sought
to develop our own measure. The purpose of
this article is to describe three phases in the develop-
ment and testing of a measure to assess PDC: con-
cept analysis, item development and analysis, and
factor analysis.
Phase 1: Concept Refinement and Item
Generation
Defining PDC and developing an instrument was
an iterative process that began with experts who had
extensive research and practice experience. Included
was a research team coordinated by the Oregon
Health & Science University Hartford Center of
Geriatric Nursing Excellence with interests and
research experience in areas related to PDC, such
as individualized care, autonomy, dementia care, and
DCWs. Practice experts included experienced clini-
cians and providers who had long emphasized
individualized care or person-centered planning and
who provided training and consultation to Oregon
BJBC practice sites specific to PDC.
Based on discussions within each of these expert
groups, we generated items to capture the essence of
PDC that was emerging in each group. We divided
these items into two broad categories: (a) what was
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 115
known about residents' preferences, values, and
choices about a wide range of care issues; and (b)
what staff did to act upon that knowledge. Both
research and practice experts reviewed items, with
practice experts adding several more. The result was
113 items that were administered across the eight
practice sites. Only 114 staff completed the surveys.
In addition, we presented the tool at the national
2004 Pioneer Network meetings. The audience
contained both researchers and practice experts
who provided feedback on items and design.
Statistical analysis revealed variability in response
to most items, and feedback from BJBC site
coordinators indicated that the items were meaning-
ful. Because of the large number of items and small
sample, however, findings were difficult to interpret.
Feedback from Pioneer Network attendees indicated
that more conceptual development was needed.
Concept Development
The research team returned to the literature to
clarify concepts and systematically develop a defini-
tion of PDC. We searched for person-centered care,
person-centred care, dementia care, individualized
care, elder care, and culture change. After reviewing
approximately 25 articles, we began to cluster similar
concepts contained in these articles. We identified five
central dimensions of PDC: personhood, knowing
the person, autonomy and choice, comfort care, and
nurturing relationship. We also identified a sixth
dimension, a supportive environment, that appeared
to be critical for supporting PDC practices. Included
were physical and organizational aspects of the
environment. No single article described all six
dimensions, although articles typically included
more than one. We continued to review the literature,
which provided additional support for these dimen-
sions. Our research experts reviewed and supported
the dimensions and definitions, providing additional
face validity for these concepts. We present brief
descriptions of each concept here.
Personhoodemphasizes that each person is unique,
has inherent value, and is worthy of respect and
honor regardless of disease or disability (Booker,
2004; Coyle & Williams, 2001; Fazio, 2001; Harr &
Kasayka, 2000; Kitwood, 1997; Parley, 2001; Stewart,
Brown, Weston, McWhinney, & Helns, 1995). Care
centers on the individual in contrast to the provider
or caregiver, with emphasis on understanding the
perspectives of those receiving care as well as the
meaning they attach to their circumstances (Beck
et al., 2002; Booker, 2004; Cotrell & Schulz, 1993;
Dewing &, Garner, 1998; Harr & Kasayka, 2000;
Kane, 2002; Kasch & Dine, 1988; Morse, Mitcham,
Hupcey, & Tason, 1996; Rader, 1995). The person's
strengths, abilities and possibilities are considered, as
are social contributions the person continues to make
(Coker, 1998; Epp, 2003; Fazio, 2001; Happ, Williams,
Strumpf, & Burger, 1996; Holburn, Jacobson,
Schwartz, Flory, & Vietze, 2004). Continuing de-
velopment of one's total self is assumed as reflected by
their interests, values, preferences, spirituality, and
hopes and dreams (Coker, 1998; Ford & McCormack,
2000; Nolan, 2001; Perry & O'Connor, 2002).
The second dimension was knowing the person
(Boise & White, 2004; Evans, 1996; Happ et al., 1996).
Each person has his or her own life story, cultural
experiences, personality, pattern of daily living,
values, needs, and preferences (Williams, 1990;
Wolverson, 2003). Care involves supporting continu-
ity between who the person has been and who the
person isnowbyproviding carein amanner consistent
with that person's biography and with what is
important to the person now (Rader, 1995; Sanborn,
1988). Knowing the person is essential to individual-
izing care (Rader, 1995, Talerico et al., 2003, Teresi,
Holmes, Benenson,Manaco,Barrett, & Koren, 1992) .
Furthermore, it is critical for understanding the
meaning of behavioral symptoms in individuals with
dementia or other cognitive impairment.
For care to be person directed, individuals must
have maximum control over their own care and
environments (Grant & Norton, 2003; Happ et al.,
1996; Holburn et al., 2004; Kane, 2002; Kane, 2003;
Kane et al., 2003; Matthews, Farrell, & Blackmore,
1996; Nolan, 2001; Parely, 2001). A third dimension,
therefore, involved autonomy and choice. In a person-
directed environment, the assumption is that inde-
pendence enhances competence and that care must
be supportive of personal agency. Emphasis is on
empowering residents, even those with cognitive
impairments, to make their own decisions about their
care, schedules, and activities. In cases of severe
impairment, choices are to be supported by DCWs,
who spend the most time with the person, to ensure
that care reflects individual preferences, interests, and
values. This means no fixed schedules for activities
such as dining, bathing, or other personal care
services (Cohen-Mansfield & Bester, 2006; Rabig,
Thomas, Kane, Cutler, & McAlilly, 2006). Addition-
ally, the right of individuals to take risks and, in
some cases, to make ``poor'' decisions is emphasized
(Coyle & Williams, 2001; Rader, 1995).
The fourth dimension involved nurturing rela-
tionships. Each person lives and functions within
a web of relationships. Person-centered environments
strive to reduce social isolation and promote friend-
ships (Holburn et al., 2004; Parley, 2001). Intentional
relationships between care providers and the person
(and his or her family) promote communication,
consistency, trust, attachment, friendship, and part-
nership and minimize isolation and conflict. Positive
relationships between staff and residents, therefore,
are necessary if staff are going to know the person
(Rader, 1995) or appropriately promote quality of
life (Kane, 2002; Kane et al., 2003). Examples of this
dimension of PDC are encouraging staff to eat
with residents, spend time talking with them, and
116 The Gerontologist
otherwise be engaged together in a wide variety of
activities (Cohen-Mansfield & Bester, 2006; Rabig
et al., 2006). Consistent assignments are considered
one way to promote staff-resident relationships
(Teresi et al., 1992). People often lose contact with
the community at large once they become dependent.
Former ties are supported through PDC, both by
bringing the community into a facility (e.g., volun-
teers, the arts, youth) as well as enabling people to
leave the premises to spend time at places or with
individuals important to them.
Comfort care includes attending to both physical
and emotional care needs using the highest standards
of practice (e.g., pain control, comfort, alternatives to
restraints, bathing, dressing, eating, toileting, skin
care, wheelchair seating) that are tailored to in-
dividual needs and preferences (Beck et al., 2002;
Bowers, Fibich, & Jacobson, 2001; Hoeffer, Talerico,
Rasin, et al., 2006; Morse et al., 1996; Rader, 1995;
Stewart et al., 1995; Talerico et al., 2003; Williams,
1990). A balance between freedom and choice with
safety is emphasized (Kane, 2001; Rader, 1995). Com-
fort care means attending to mental health and psy-
chological needs (Bowers et al., 2001; Harr &
Kasayka, 2000). It is especially important to view
behaviors associated with dementia as symptoms of
unmet needs, such as uncontrolled pain, medication
side effects, or fear and feelings of insecurity. Practices
such as consistent assignments contribute to comfort
care because staff who have relationships with res-
idents are more likely to notice physical or emotional
changes requiring attention (Teresi, et al., 1992).
The final dimension concerned a supportive envi-
ronment. The ability to provide PDC is dependent
upon characteristics of the system in which care is
provided. Research has identified two components of
the environment: physical and organizational. Cutler,
Kane, Degenholtz, Miller, and Grant (2006) identified
layout, furnishings, dining areas, bathing areas,
personalized living areas, and outdoor space as linked
to quality of life. Increasing attention has also been
given to environments that support autonomy, par-
ticularly for individuals with dementia (Beck et al.,
2002; Kane, 2002; Rader, 1995; Sanborn, 1988;
Slaughter, Calkins, Eliasziw, & Reimer, 2006; Sloane
et al., 2002). The culture change movement empha-
sizes creating home by eliminating medicine carts,
overhead pages, long corridors, and tray carts (Cutler
et al., 2006; Rabig et al., 2006).
Many organizational attributes contribute directly
to quality care including management practices that
empower and support DCWs; provide training and
support for communication and resident care, skilled
supervision and leadership, adequate staffing and
appropriate workload; and support staff retention
and reduce staff turnover (Barry, Brannon, & Mor,
2005; Castle & Engberg, 2006; Dellefield, 2006;
Rantz, Hicks, Grando, et al., 2004). Grant and
Norton (2003) developed a conceptual model of
culture change that encompasses both physical and
organizational attributes including decision making,
staff roles, physical environment, organizational
design, and leadership practices. According to Harr
and Kasayka (2000), ``When management and staff
respect each other as persons and honor the dignity
of personhood that implies, high quality of care will
be a natural by-product'' (p. 42).
Phase 2: Item Development and Analysis
Once PDC dimensions were established, we
returned to item development, creating items that
would be reflective of the six dimensions identified
previously. We began by sorting the items developed
in Phase 1 into the six PDC categories and then
developed new items based on the literature and
feedback from practice experts to ensure an adequate
number of items for each concept. We reviewed each
item multiple times, discussing clarity of meaning and
relevance to the concept it was designed to measure.
BJBC site coordinators (who included nurses, human
resource directors, and social services providers)
reviewed the item pool as content experts. They
suggested changes in wording, identified additional
items, and recommended items to delete due to
overlap, lack of relevance, or lack of clarity. Items
were tested with DCWs in two nursing homes and an
assisted living facility that were not part of the BJBC
initiative. After each test, we changed or deleted
items that were confusing. For example, ``understand
their preferences for care'' became ``know their
preferred routines (for example, morning, evening,
mealtime),'' and ``decide who they will live with''
became ``decide who they will share a room with.''
The resulting item pool consisted of 89 items (ranging
from 7 to 19 items for each of the six scales). We used
two question stems: ``Thinking about the people in
your care, for how many can you . . .?'' and
``Thinking about the people in your care, how often
. . .?'' Items were scored from 1 to 5 on a Likert-type
scale, where 1 indicated ``very few or none'' or
``rarely or none of the time'' and 5 indicated ``all or
almost all'' or ``all or almost all of the time.''
Data Collection for Initial Item Analysis
The tool was administered to all levels of staff (e.g.,
DCWs, nurses, administrators, housekeeping, thera-
pists, social services) in eight organizations partici-
pating in the Oregon BJBC demonstration site (one
home care agency, two assisted living facilities, one
residential care facility, and four nursing homes).
Time to complete the surveys (which contained 52
additional questions related to other Oregon BJBC
objectives) ranged from 20 to 45 min, with nonnative
English speakers generally taking longer. Research
staff was on site to administer and collect completed
surveys, including for the night shift in some facilities.
The process varied by site according to the preferences
Vol. 48, Special Issue I, 2008 117
of the site coordinator and the organization. The 467
respondents represented about 60% of the eligible
staff across facility-based settings. Home care work-
ers completed surveys at inservices, typically attended
by about a quarter of the workforce. We eliminated
respondents who answered less than 75% of all items,
resulting in an overall sample for analysis of 423. Most
of those eliminated were administrative staff or
``other'' who had little contact with clients or
residents. Less than 3% of DCWs who composed
the majority of the sample (n = 197 after screening)
were removed from the sample because of high levels
of missing data. Similarly, certified medication aides,
registered nurses, licensed practical nurses, admin-
istrators, and nurse leaders had relatively complete
levels of data.
Item Analysis
We conducted several analyses to identify the
strongest items and eliminate poorly performing
items. We assessed item endorsement by dichoto-
mizing those scoring high (original response range
4Â­5) and those scoring low (original response range
1Â­3) on the extent to which they felt those in their
care received PDC. We calculated mean scores to
determine the proportion of respondents who en-
dorsed each item. We considered an indication of
adequate endorsement to be items that scored above .3
(i.e., 30% endorsement) and below .7 (i.e., 70%
endorsement). We kept one item in the autonomy
scale that was endorsed by few because it was con-
ceptually important: ``decide who they will share a
room with.'' This is a level of autonomy not available
to most people living in congregate settings but is
nonetheless illustrative of personal choices that most
adults make. An example of an item eliminated was
``Thinking about the people in your care, for how
many do you know what they want to be called?,''
with 90% of respondents indicating that they did
know this about residents/clients in their care.
We determined item discrimination by calculating
the mean difference between respondents in the top
and bottom thirds of the distribution (i.e., those
reporting high levels of PDC and those reporting low
levels of PDC). For the item to be retained, the mean
difference between these two groups had to exceed
.20. The item ``Thinking about the people in your
care, how often are you able to work with the same
clients/residents?'' is an example of an item that did
not discriminate well. Items intended to assess levels
of noise and bad odors in the environment failed
to discriminate and were eliminated. Other analyses
used to identify and eliminate poorly performing
items included exploratory factor analyses and cal-
culation of Cronbach's alpha. We also considered
respondent burden and eliminated some items that
met all of the above criteria if analysis of correlations
and internal consistency reliabilities demonstrated
that they were captured by other items. For example,
in the autonomy scale, we retained the item
``Thinking about the people in your care, how
many of these residents/clients make decisions about
their personal care routines?'' and eliminated several
items asking specifically about choices related to bed
time and morning routines, choices about eating,
and choices about bathing. Although each of these
eliminated items represents a different aspect of
care, respondents tended to answer them in similar
ways. Eliminating them did not significantly reduce
reliabilities as measured by Cronbach's alpha. The
revised instrument contained 64 items, with each
subscale comprising between 7 and 10 items.
Phase 3: Exploratory Factor Analysis
Data Collection
Therevisedinstrumentwasadministeredtothesame
organizations 1 year later, again targeting all staff in the
participating organizations. Based on lessons learned in
Phase 1, we provided food for staff completing the
surveys and once again research staff was on site to
encourage participation, reassure participants of the
confidentiality of their individual responses, and collect
completed surveys. Site coordinators were invaluable in
arranging space and encouraging staff to participate.
All employees were paid for the time they took to
complete thesurvey. We weregenerally on site for more
than 1 day. In some cases we left surveys for staff to
complete but left envelopes or other secure methods for
them to return surveys. These surveys, which also
contained items in addition to the PDC items, were
completed in 20 to 30 min.
To reduce missing data, we were more explicit
with instructions to staff who do not routinely
interact with residents/clients (e.g., administrative
support staff). We asked them to give their general
impressions about the care in their facility or
program. The overall response rate for facility-based
programs was approximately 61%. The response rate
for the home care program at 25% was considerably
less. Data from the home care program were
collected once again at inservice meetings, introduc-
ing a possible bias toward those who were motivated
to attend educational programs.
Sample
We received a total of 477 surveys across all
settings. In spite of efforts to obtain more complete
data, we were not entirely successful. Consequently,
we eliminated from further analysis those complet-
ing less than 75% of the total items. This resulted in
a final overall sample size of 430. As before, most of
the individuals whose responses were eliminated
from the analyses worked as office staff or were
those who self-identified as ``other.'' However, this
118 The Gerontologist
procedure also caused us to lose about 8% of the
DCWs in the sample. Most of the attrition came
from one nursing home and one assisted living
facility where a high proportion of staff spoke
English as a second language. This may have made
it more difficult for them to complete the survey.
Table 1 presents the composition of the sample prior
to the elimination of cases and the final sample, by
job title and place of work.
Items designed to tap organizational environ-
mental attributes, although essential to supporting
PDC, were conceptually different from those that
tapped PDC, exerting a more supportive influence
on PDC. Consequently, we conducted two sets of
analyses, first of items developed to reflect the five
PDC dimensions (personhood, autonomy/choice,
knowing the person, comfort, nurturing relation-
ships; 45 items), followed by items developed to
capture the physical and organizational environ-
ments (19 items).
Data Analysis: PDC
The correlation matrix revealed correlations
ranging between .04 and .79. Two items (``know
what kinds of TV programs they prefer'' and ``help
stay dry'') did not correlate well with any items.
Eight items had correlations above .70 (e.g., ``keep
them connected to their families''). Next, we cal-
culated item endorsement and discrimination scores
by using the procedures and cutoffs described
previously. We then employed exploratory factor
analyses to aid in the identification of the underlying
structure of the items and to help in the ultimate
reduction of items within components.
An initial principal components analysis of the 45
items for the five major PDC domains suggested nine
factors with eigenvalues greater than 1.00 (14.88,
4.28, 3.31, 2.16, 1.93, 1.31, 1.18, 1.04, and 1.01).
Together these explained 69.11% of the variance.
However, an examination of the scree plot indicated
a clear break after five factors. Principal axis
factoring with direct oblimin rotation, which allows
factors to be correlated, was then run with the
stipulation of five factors. Clear simple structure was
achieved using a cutoff for loadings on the pattern
matrix of .40 and with the exception that one item
(i.e., ``share some things about yourself'') failed to
load above .29 on any factor.
Examination of item endorsement and discrimi-
nation scores, means, standard deviations, inter-item
correlations, factor loadings, and theoretical judg-
ments led to the deletion of nine items. We reran
principal axis factoring, resulting in five factors with
clear simple structure. These factors explained 61%
of the variance. All items loaded above .40, with
communalities ranging from .34 to .82. Each factor
showed good internal consistency: Table 2 presents
the final items, factor loadings, and Cronbach's
alphas.

Data Analysis: Environmental Support for PDC
We ran analyses in a similar fashion with the
organizational items. Inter-item correlations for the
Environment Support items ranged from .09 to .72.
We followed this with analyses to examine scores for
item endorsement and discrimination. A principal
components analysis of the 19 items suggested
a three- (56% of the variance) or four-factor (62%
of the variance) solution with eigenvalues of 7.18,
2.18, 1.32, and 1.11. To determine which solution
was better, we conducted both a three- and four-
factor principal axis factoring with direct oblimin
rotation. Neither solution produced the desired
simple structure initially. Based on a combination
of the item endorsement and discrimination analyses,
inter-item correlations, and information from the
factor analyses, we dropped four items. We then
reran principal axis factoring stipulating three
factors and achieved good simple structure. This
solution explained 60% of the variance. Conceptually

Discussion
The PDC measurement tool developed through
the Oregon BJBC Demonstration project is an
important step toward operationalizing the concepts
that make up PDC and is expected to be a useful tool
in evaluating successes in meeting PDC goals. This is
a time of great excitement and development in long-
term care practice and workforce development, and
research must be an integral part of testing new
models of care. Researchers need to be clear about
what it is they are trying to accomplish and
determine whether efforts are successful and what
elements of practice contribute to or hinder that
success. As suggested by our conceptual model, the
dimensions of PDC, although distinct, are related
and should be considered together. Our preliminary

analyses suggest that this tool discriminates between
long-term care settings, disciplines, and staff levels.
The next step in the Oregon BJBC evaluation is to
explore factors associated with staff perceptions of
PDC, such as environmental characteristics, relation-
ships with supervisors, levels of residents' or clients'
dependency, levels of care, and cultural competence.
We will explore extensive qualitative data collected
at all sites to further explore the meanings of the
PDC scores obtained in this sample. We are also
interested in comparing staff perceptions about PDC
to family and resident/client perceptions of care. A
measure of family perspectives about PDC is in
development (White, Lyons, Boise, & Newton-
Curtis, 2005). The resident or client voice, however,
tends to be missing from research. An exception is
work by Mahan (2005), who developed a measure of
resident autonomy. Research is needed to explore the
concepts of PDC with residents/clients to determine
the extent to which the five dimensions resonate
with their preferences and values. If they do, the
field needs valid measures to determine if residents/
clients feel they are viewed as unique and valued
individuals, experience autonomy, feel well known
by those who are providing intimate services, are
emotionally and physically comfortable, and experi-
ence opportunities to be in relationships with those
they care about.
The PDC measurement tool needs further testing.
Those participating in BJBC are generally high-
performing facilities. Eliminated items might have
had lower endorsement in other settings and there-
fore could be used to distinguish between high- and
low-performing organizations. Although this process
has helped to build evidence of validity through
work with practice and research experts, more work
is needed to determine whether staff perceptions of
PDC match more objective assessments of PDC.
Similarly, it would be useful to compare responses to
this measure with others tapping into related
concepts. Examples include the measures of culture
change being developed through the Centers for
Medicare & Medicaid Services, or various quality-
of-life measures that have been developed in long-
term care. As PDC practice evolves, this instrument
will need to develop further as well. We eventually
eliminated items felt to measure key aspects of PDC
from our final measure because they did not fit
criteria of inclusion (e.g., How many residents/
clients in your care select who they will share a room
with? Are you evaluated by how well you support
resident choices?). Yet these items are considered
representative of desired culture changes. Accom-
modation is also needed for those who are nonnative
English speakers. We did not have the resources to
translate surveys and would recommend doing so in
the future. Interviews by someone who speaks the
same language may also be an important method of
reaching those who feel uncomfortable with reading
and writing.
Throughout BJBC and other culture change
initiatives in Oregon, we have observed a progression
in understanding of PDC practices. The initial
response to PDC, especially among administrative
staff, was that ``we are already doing that.'' It was not
until months after learning more about the concepts
and working to implement new practices that some
staff reported ``we weren't as person centered as we
thought.'' Preliminary analysis suggests that PDC
scores declined in some settings over time, which
indicates to us that staff are more critically evaluating
their ability to provide PDC services. Longitudinal
research is needed to determine whether PDC scores
typically decline and then increase as new PDC
practices become more integrated into the setting.
Finally, we believe individual items have the
potential to provide concrete guidance to long-term
care providers who want to change practice but are
uncertain about what that change might entail or
what it might look like when it occurs. Also
important to note is that some items previously
eliminated because of low respondent endorsement
or because of statistical redundancy may nonetheless
hold practical significance for training purposes and
thus should not be disregarded completely.
