1982 to 1994 in the U.S. Elderly Population

Declines in chronic disability were observed in the National Long Term Care Survey (NLTCS) 1982 to 1994. We
analyzed the 1982, 1984, 1989, and 1994 NLTCS to identify the dimensions of chronic disability from multivariate
analyses of a rich battery of measures of the ability (or inability) to perform specific activities. Changes over time in
the prevalence of individual disability dimensions can be tracked to evaluate the rate of age-related losses of specific
functions, 1982-1994. Seven dimensions described changes in the age dependence of 27 activities of daily living,
instrumental activities of daily living, and physical performance measures in community and institutional resident
elderly individuals over the 12 year period. Adjusted for age, the healthiest dimension with the best physical func-
tion experienced the largest increase in prevalence (3.3%) implying a decline in age-related disability. Disability
declines were correlated with reductions in select health conditions (e.g., dementia and circulatory disease) over the
study period.
CHRONIC disability is a potentially important indicator
of age-related biological changes in the U.S. elderly
population because it reflects the intensity of functional
loss in individuals. Though often associated with the pres-
ence of one, or more, chronic diseases, direct measure-
ments of chronic disability add information on disease pro-
gression, severity, and interactions within individuals. For
example, it is currently possible to slow, but not eliminate,
chronic degenerative processes like Parkinson's and
Alzheimer's disease (AD). Research suggests that exoge-
nous estrogen (1), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs
(NSAID) (2), reductions of stroke risks (3), and possibly
antioxidants (4) may further retard the rate of progression
of AD. Other research focuses on curing or preventing
chronic diseases whose courses can now be slowed (e.g.,
atherosclerosis; ischemic heart disease). In both situations,
an accurate assessment of chronic disability dimensions is
crucial to measure progress in improving population health
at specific ages and to quantify the benefits of new inter-
ventions for treatment of currently refractory conditions in
the U.S. population.
Chronic disability is also important because it is a risk
factor for other diseases -- many related to age specific
physiological changes [e.g., physical disability is a potent,
short, and long term risk factor for stroke (5-6), pulmonary
dysfunction and susceptibility to infection (7), loss of car-
diac function (8), and peripheral vascular and muscle tone
(9)].
Chronic disability thus represents both the causes and
effects of age related physiological processes on an individ-
ual -- dimensions of which may be modified by interven-
tions even in highly incapacitated, very elderly persons (e.g.,
by nutritional and weight training interventions (10--12).
The effects of interventions on chronic disability preva-
lence in the U.S. elderly population may only recently have
passed threshholds of statistical detectability (relative to the
background noise of short term health variation and mea-
surement error) necessary to provide sufficient statistical
precision to inform policy evaluations and forecasts (13,
14). It was unclear in 1982 how disability prevalence had
changed when reviewing the Social Security program
because U.S. life expectancy increased more than expected
(14-16). Waidmann et al. (17) reanalyzed the survey and
mortality data in those analyses and concluded, with the
benefit of recent data, that not only had disability declined
in the 1980s, but also in the 1970s. Fogel (18) suggested
chronic disease declines began much earlier. Mortality rates
for stroke, responsible for much chronic disability, were
declining by 1925 (19). The age standardized prevalence of
chronic disability declined 14.5% from 1982-1994 (20).
The studies cited above describe changes in the preva-
lence of disability categories, i.e., population groups defined
by the presence or absence of the ability to perform specific
activities. This definition of disability prevalence is flawed if
(0 the ability, or inability, to perform an activity is reported
with error (e.g., there may be differences between the defi-
nition of disability assumed in framing survey questions and
the concept of disability held by survey respondents); (ii)
there is imprecision in modeling disability as a discrete cat-
egory due to significant individual variability in disability
levels within a category; and (Hi) there is information on
multiple dimensions of disability contained in the covari-
ances of the disability measures. A better description of
chronic disability prevalence can be constructed using a
multivariate model to identify distinct dimensions of dis-
ability from which estimates of severity can be defined for
each individual calculated from correlated disability traits.
The procedure used, the Grade of Membership (GoM)
model (21), not only identifies disability dimensions from
measures of whether a person can (or cannot) perform a
number of specific activities, but it also generates, for each
person a "score" representing the intensity of a person's
B59

disability on each dimension. The set of disability scores
defines the "state" of the individual at a point in time.
Changes in scores describe the age trajectory of change on
each disability dimension for an individual. The trajectory
of the average score for each disability dimension repre-
sents a continuously graded measure of change in the dis-
ability status of the population over time. Equations de-
scribing temporal rates of change in the average scores for
each disability dimension describe a "multidimensional"
rate of aging for the population (21).
One may ask whether the population trajectories for the
disability dimensions reflect physiological aging changes
-- or the effects of changes in the sociopsychological per-
ception of disability. Three arguments suggest the trajectory
of the average scores on the disability dimensions repre-
sent, at least in part, age-related changes in physiology.
(0 The use of multiple disability dimensions provides a
richer description than do age changes in mortality rates.
Specifically, the rate of aging across species is often exam-
ined by fitting a Gompertz function to age-specific mortal-
ity rates (22). This was done because it was argued that the
age dependence of mortality reflected the age rate loss of
"vitality" (the ability to maintain physiological homeosta-
sis) in an organism (23). Since age-specific mortality rates
were easier to measure for multiple, large populations than
multiple physiological parameters, cross population com-
parisons of aging rates were done using mortality data --
and the fitted Gompertz functions used to make inferences
about population differences in the age changes of physio-
logical parameters defining vitality. Below we use more
informative data to infer the individual's age trajectory of
physiological changes, i.e., instead of only having the pop-
ulation age distribution of the catastrophic failure (i.e.,
death) of an organism we have multiple measures of func-
tional declines in an individual for a number of years prior
to death.
(ii) Prolonged exposure to social and environmental fac-
tors will alter the physiological basis of disability trajecto-
ries at late ages (24). The loss of mobility (which reflects
features of the built environment, and patterns of social
interaction, as well as physical limitations) induces, over
time, changes in physiological parameters such as basal
metabolic efficiency [lean to fat body mass ratio; insulin-
like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) levels (25); serum albumin
(26)], immunological function [e.g., as mediated by IGF-1
(27)], cardiopulmonary efficiency (8), and blood chemistry,
e.g., serum fibrinogen, cholesterol (28-30). These measures
may be altered by socioenvironmental exposures -- but so
are times to death (e.g., there is a 7.6 year difference in the
average age at death in U.S. females with >8 years of educa-
tion vs those with <7 years (31). Thus, by assessing the
intensity of impairment on multiple disability dimensions a
more precise evaluation of changes in the population rate of
physiological aging can be made than with mortality data
alone. As with mortality data there may be cohort and
period effects on the multidimensional trajectory of disabil-
ity (24). Nonetheless, if the functional decline of an individ-
ual is an age-related process, mortality data provide infor-
mation on that process only at one point in time -- and at
one level of disability (i.e., total loss of function). Having
assessments at multiple time points on multiple scaled
dimensions of disability for a person before death provides
far more information to characterize and model that process.
(Hi) Studies suggest that self ratings are more accurate
and less biased than informant's ratings, with informants
tending to over-estimate disability (32). If the relation is
subject to random noise (e.g., variation in how the individ-
ual's perception of disability relates to loss of function) then
a multivariate procedure can "filter" nonreproducible (across
individual) variation from stably correlated physical changes
by isolating a "small" number of dimensions from a larger
battery of correlated disability measures, i.e., multivariate
procedures can be used to adjust for measurement effects.
In sum, the GoM (33) procedure uses data on the joint
dependency of multiple, discrete measures, adjusted for
measurement error, to identify disability dimensions. These
dimensions predict age-related changes in mortality and
morbidity better than many physiological variables, i.e.,
they have good predictive validity (33). With the traits asso-
ciated with each disability dimension identified, intensity
scores for each dimension can be calculated for each person
in the sample. Changes in the distribution of scores de-
scribe age and temporal changes in the multiple dimensions
of disability in the U.S. elderly population. Evaluating
changes in disability using scores for each dimension re-
duces measurement error effects, due to bias or subtle
changes in the meaning of specific disability measures (34).
The validity of these processes, and changes in the preva-
lence of each dimension, may also be related to reports of
chronic diseases (e.g., dementia and stroke) for further vali-
dation. Changes in the population distribution of disability
dimensions, consequently, may be useful in estimating cur-
rent, and forecasting future, changes in U.S. health costs.
GoM was applied to 27 function and physical perfor-
mance measures assessed in the 1982, 1984, 1989, and
1994 National Long Term Care Surveys (NLTCS) to deter-
mine (0 the number of dimensions needed to describe dis-
ability over time (i.e., did "new" dimensions emerge 1982
to 1994?); (ii) the content of the dimensions, described by
their relation to the 27 measures; and (Hi) the predictive
validity of the dimensions on health outcomes. We discuss
the implications of disability trends for dementia preva-
lence 1982-1994.
DATA
The data analyzed are from the 1982, 1984, 1989, and
1994 NLTCS-national longitudinal surveys based on list
samples of U.S. Medicare enrollees aged 65+. In each sur-
vey, persons are screened to determine if they had a
chronic (i.e., lasted, or expected to last, 90+ days) impair-
ment of an activity of daily living (ADL; 35) or instrumen-
tal activity of daily living (IADL; 36). If a person had no
chronic disability he or she was not given a detailed instru-
ment, i.e., persons were not asked detailed questions about
chronic disabilities they did not have. Those reporting at
least one chronic disability, or who were residents of insti-
tutions providing long-term care, were given a detailed
community (1982-1994) or institutional (1984-1994) in-
terview. The same screening procedures, field methods,
and disability, physical performance, and health condition
DYNAMICS OF DIMENSIONS OF DISABILITY B61
measures were used in all four NLTCSs to minimize
confounding of measurement error, bias, and disability
changes.
In 1984, 1989, and 1994 persons identified as chronically
impaired in a prior NLTCS were re-interviewed to assess
positive and negative changes in disability. In addition, in
those NLTCS, new samples of 5,000 persons who passed age
65 between surveys were drawn from a national list of Medi-
care enrollees and screened for disability. Sampling persons
who passed age 65 between two surveys ensures that all four
surveys represented the U.S. population aged 65+.
In 1994, a supplementary set of 922 community inter-
views was conducted with nondisabled persons (i.e., per-
sons not reporting disability on the screen). This was done
to improve the description of the dimensions for nondis-
abled persons. In three prior NLTCSs there were 2,432 per-
sons not reporting any disability who completed detailed
community interviews. These represented persons who had
been disabled at a prior survey (once screened in as dis-
abled, a person was given a detailed interview in every sub-
sequent survey until death), who had ceased to be disabled
by the time the detailed interview was given, or who had
reported minor disabilities on the screen that were not con-
firmed in the detailed interview (i.e., false positives). The
screen and detailed interviews were constructed so that
there would be a small false positive rate to minimize false
negative responses to the screen. These various factors gen-
erated a nondisabled detailed interview group sufficiently
large to estimate characteristics of nondisabled persons in
1982, 1984, and 1989. We confirmed (37) that these nondis-
abled community interview respondents were not statisti-
cally different from the total nondisabled screen population
in terms of (/) mortality rates, or (//) use of Medicare
funded health services. The 922 additional nondisabled per-
sons interviewed in 1994 augmented the 885 nondisabled
community detailed responders already in the 1994 sample
as a result of the longitudinal follow-up process. Sample
weights were adjusted in 1994 so that each sample compo-
nent appropriately represented the corresponding popula-
tion component.
A supplementary sample of 540 persons aged 95+ was
also drawn in 1994. These persons were screened for dis-
ability. They only received a detailed interview if disabled
or institutionalized. The supplement improved the precision
of disability estimates for persons at extreme ages. The 95+
population in 1994 was reweighted to reflect their popula-
tion proportions.
The NLTCS samples, drawn from Medicare enrollment
lists, had the same structure [e.g., location and identity of
primary sampling units (the specific geographic areas
from which sample members are drawn)] and used the
same field methods to reduce artifactual changes in disabil-
ity. Over the 12 years spanned by the four surveys a total of
35,848 distinct individuals were followed and, from linked
Medicare records, 17,000 deaths identified between 1982--
1996. Since samples are randomly drawn from all individ-
uals in Medicare files, persons in all types of institutional
residence are represented as well as community dwellers in
innovative residential structures such as continuing care re-
tirement communities (38). The use of continuously up-
dated Medicare files to track sample respondents between
surveys means follow-up on individuals was near 100% so
that bias due to the lack of follow-up of severely disabled or
ill persons is minimized. In the NLTCS, response rates are
=95% (after adjusting for mortality attrition -- decedents
also have high service use prior to death).
METHODS
GoM identifies K dimensions from J measurements
made on a sample of / (i = 1, 2, . . . , I) persons up to T
times. The f measure has L3
responses. With these defini-
tions, the model is,
(1)
In Eq. 1, y,y;(Os are binary (0,1) variables indicating if
person / had the /lh response to the jl h (j = 1, 2 , . . . , 27) vari-
able at time t (t = 1, 2, 3, and 4 for the 1982, 1984, 1989,
and 1994 NLTCS, respectively). The probability of a
response is the sum of the product of gik
(t), a score sum-
ming to 1.0 (and in the range 0 to 1.0) for each person i, at
time t, over the K dimensions, and \kj
,{t), a conditional
probability describing the content of a dimension as the
probability that the kh dimension manifests the /lh response
for the /h variable at time t. gik
(t) indicates the degree of
similarity of the traits observed for a person to the set of
traits defining the /c*h dimension. Because the distribution of
individual scores [g,*(0] comprises estimated parameters
distinct from those defining the dimensions, the scores "fil-
ter" individual response variation from the definition of the
dimensions, i.e., Kkj
i(t). Since the g,k
(t) are not constrained
over time they describe temporal changes, for persons inter-
viewed more than once, on the K dimensions -- which are
constrained to have the same content every time.
Both sets of parameters are estimated by maximum like-
lihood (39). The likelihood for the four surveys is,
L=nnnn(ig*(t)-\kJ
(-)YJI'\(K<<j). m
In Eq. 2, the set of scores [gik
(t)s] for an individual can
vary over time. \kj
,(-)s do not, i.e., they are forced to be
equal over time so the content of each dimension is time
invariant. Thus, the interpretation of a numerical value of
gik
(t) does not change. Disability change for individual / is
examined by following the ^-element vectors of gik(t)s (33).
Because K is smaller than J (in our analysis, K = 6 and J =
27), the model exploits the interrelation of measures to deal
with reporting error, i.e., the procedure extracts the infor-
mation that is consistent across multiple measures. Thus,
measurement error, either cross sectional or, because of
the time constraint, longitudinal, is "filtered" from the K
dimensions.
To determine the number of dimensions necessary to
describe significant variation in J measures, x2 approxima-
tions to likelihood ratios for models with K and K + 1
dimensions are calculated. When the x2 increase due to the
addition of the K + 1 dimension is no longer significant
(with / + Z (Lj-l) degrees of freedom) we know K dimen-
B62 MANTONETAL.
sions best describe the information in the J variables, i.e.,
conditional on gik
(t) and \y/(-) estimates, ymft) are in-
dependent.
The use of K dimensions to describe disability changes
has other advantages. By projecting changes of the 27 mea-
sures onto K dimensions, estimates of disability change are
improved. This could have been done by simply counting
the disabilities a person had at two points in time and exam-
ining changes in the count. However, if there are substan-
tive differences between measures, examining changes in
the count of disability may be biased and, if there are sig-
nificant correlations among the 27 measures, information in
those correlations is ignored and stochasticity overesti-
mated. GoM jointly minimizes bias and errors in estimating
stochasticity (21). This is important for forecasts, and for
estimating, the prevalence of morbidity associated with
functional loss.
Change in the "prevalence of disability" is thus general-
ized to be change in the statistical moments of the K dimen-
sional population distribution of the gik(t)s [i.e., the distribu-
tion of the gik(t)s weighted by time specific sample weights,
Wt(t)]. The most basic analysis of prevalence change is to
track the average of the sample weighted g.*(t)s over time.
To help interpret the K dimensions one can indepen-
dently calculate A.*m
/(-) values for M "external" variables (m
= 1, . . . , M) with the gik(t)s calculated from 27 disability
measures fixed. Since X.*;/(-)s defining the K dimensions are
temporally invariant this is equivalent to calculating X.«(-)s
conditionally on the processes generating the gik(t)s. These
describe prevalence changes across surveys of the mlh con-
dition for a given time invariant disability dimension. To
estimate period specific prevalences for the Xtm
;()s, four
sets of kkmi(t)s were estimated -- one for each time.
RESULTS
Disability dimensions in the 1982 to 1994 NLTCS. --
Twenty-seven measures were used to define six disability
dimensions for 21,574 respondents to the detailed commu-
nity interviews in the four NLTCS. The use of a seventh
dimension to explain the 27 measures did not significantly
increase x2 for the community respondents (Ax2 = 14,800;
df= 21,643; p > .999). The addition of a sixth dimension
did significantly improve x2 (Ax2 = 28,382; df = 21,643;
p « .001). Thus, six dimensions were sufficient to describe
the variation of the 27 disability measures of respondents to
all four community surveys. The GoM analysis in which
intensity scores were calculated was restricted to commu-
nity residents.
In a separate analysis of the combined community and
institutional respondents (N ~ 25,000), a seventh dimension
was identified that described institutional residents. The
institutional population was distinct from the community
population in the activities which they could not perform,
i.e., for many disabilities there is little variation in the insti-
tutional population. For analyses of the entire population
we added institutional residents (to the file containing com-
munity respondents) by defining a seventh dimension whose
score, representing institutional residence, was 0 or 1.0.
Thus, a separate, discrete (i.e., all gn
(t) = 1 or 0) dimension
was defined for institutional residents.
The \y/()s for the six dimensions calculated from pooled
1982, 1984, 1989, and 1994 NLTCS community interview
data are in Table 1. X.y/()s represent the probability that a
person exactly like a dimension (i.e., gik
- 1.0) has each of
27 traits. Whether a \y;() is "characteristic" or "not charac-
teristic" of a dimension is determined by comparing it to
the frequency of that trait in the total sample (40,41). In
Table 1, 10.6% of the sample needed help with eating.. Only
dimension 6 had that disability. The probability of an eating
problem for a person exactly like dimension 6, 80.8%, sug-
gests that such a person has a 7.6 times greater risk (i.e.,
80.8/10.6 = 7.6) of an eating problem than the probability
(10.6%) of an eating problem in the total sample.
The first three dimensions in Table 1 are not associated
with any ADL or IADL impairment except heavy housework.
Impairment on the seven physical functions increases across
these dimensions. The physical functions span a range of
capabilities, e.g., from stair climbing, which may not affect
ADLs or IADLs, to grasping an object -- which, if severe,
could affect ADL and IADLs. Dimension 4 had many IADLs
impaired -- but no ADLs. The IADLs for managing money,
taking medicine, and phoning are associated with dementia
and stroke (42). (This is validated in Table 2.) Dimension 4
showed no problems with physical functions involving upper
limbs. There were limitations in climbing stairs, holding a
heavy (10 lb.) package, and in vision -- sensory impairments
increase disability in both community and institutional popu-
lations (43,44). Dimension 5 has a mix of ADL and IADL
impairments. These primarily involve mobility limitation as
suggested by the associated limitations on the physical func-
tions. Dimension 6 is highly ADL- and IADL-impaired with
limitations on all physical functions and vision.
The content of the six dimensions can be explicated by
examining the probability that a person characterized by a
dimension has one or more of M conditions. Conditions are
described in Table 2 and their X.y/()s presented. Because
A.t/;(-)s are calculated in an independent likelihood calcula-
tion, the dimensions defined by the 27 disability items do
not change.
In Table 2, to identify conditions characterizing a dimen-
sion, we underlined the two highest probabilities for each
condition. Of 21,574 community respondents, 71.2% re-
ported arthritis or joint problems. Dimension 3 has a 100%
likelihood of this condition; dimension 5, an 88.5% likeli-
hood. Thus these two dimensions show a higher likelihood
of arthritis and joint problems than a person selected at ran-
dom from the pooled sample.
These conditions help identify physiological correlates of
the six dimensions in Table 1. The first never has a higher
likelihood of having a given condition than the average
probability of that problem occurring in the pooled sam-
ples, i.e., there are, on average, 45.7% fewer conditions
than for a person selected at random from the pooled sam-
ple. Thus, dimension 1 is healthier than average. Though
the probabilities of serious conditions are low (e.g., 0.4%
for dementia; 1.4% for heart attack, 1.6% for stroke) they
are not zero. This is because the traits for this dimension
are identified using all 28 conditions. Thus, the presence of

Note: Underlines indicate the two highest probabilities for each condition.
"Indicates that the prevalence of the condition in 1982-1994 was no longer the first or second most prevalent condition as it was in 1982-1984 (see
Table 4).
Indicates first or second most prevalent condition in 1982-1994 was not the first or second most prevalent conditions in 1982-1984 (see Table 4).
obesity, hypertension, diabetes, and peripheral circulatory
problems, all associated with stroke, cause the model to
predict a small probability of stroke for dimension 1.
Though non-zero, the risk of these conditions relative to
dimensions with the highest risks are small, e.g., dimension
6 has 81.3 times the risk of dementia, 14.4 times the risk of
stroke, and 4.7 times the risk of atherosclerosis. Though
risks for many conditions are small, because dimension 1 is
prevalent (see Table 5), the population burden of conditions
associated with this dimension is significant.
Dimension 2 has about the same chance as the pooled
sample of having any condition. Dimension 3 shows higher
than average risks of cardio-pulmonary problems but few
neurological problems. It is the youngest of the nondisabled
dimensions (mean age 73.7 years, compared to 76.0 and 75.2
years for the first two). Thus, dimension 3 may have acute
care costs but be less likely than, say, dimensions 4 or 6 to
have formal, or informal, chronic care costs. Dimension 4,
has neurological disorders -- especially stroke and dementia.
This is consistent with its impairment on IADLs (phoning,
taking medicine, money management) associated with
dementia. This dimension has the highest mean age (85.2
years). Dimension 5 has a mean age of 79.8 years and is
characterized by fractures, joint problems, and paralysis. This
is consistent with the three physical functions most often
impaired being related to mobility. Dimension 6 has neuro-
logical, cardiopulmonary, and multiple other conditions.
Using the information in Tables 1 and 2 the six dimen-
sions can be characterized;
1. Healthy, unimpaired;
2. Not ADL/IADL impaired with some limitation of
three physical functions;
3. Not ADL/IADL impaired, but young with some phys-
ical limitation due to cardiopulmonary problems;
4. IADL impaired with cognitive limitations often due to
dementia and stroke;
5. Moderate ADL and IADL impairment -- often due to
musculoskeletal problems;
6. Complexly impaired.
DYNAMICS OF DIMENSIONS OF DISABILITY B65
Also presented in Table 1 are the mean gik(t)s in the
NLTCS detailed community interview sample. Because the
gik(t)s sum to 1.0 for each person at each time, the average
of the mean is fixed at 16.7%. The mean values range from
a low of 10.3% (dimension 4) to a high of 29.2% (dimen-
sion 1), with a median of 15.9%. Thus, all six dimensions
are well represented in the study sample. The mean gik
(t)
value may also be interpreted as a measure of the preva-
lence of the kh dimension in the sample, i.e., the fraction of
the sample characterized by that dimension. To determine
the general population prevalences of the six dimensions,
sample weights must be applied to the gik(t)s before averag-
ing (see below).
Dimensionsfor the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS -- Relation to
1982-1994 dimensions. -- It is important to assess if the
content of the six dimensions changed over time because,
though pooled estimates of M/), by construction, describe
the characteristics of disabled persons averaged over time,
large differences in the \kji(-)s between surveys would imply
change in the disablement processes. If large differences
exist, tests would be needed to discriminate (/) changes in
the disablement processes, from (ii) emergence of new, and
disappearance of old, disability dimensions. In the latter case
changes are described by changes in the gik
(t) distribution.
In Table 3, we present A.*//()s and mean gik(t)s estimated
from the 1982 and 1984 NLTCS for the 27 measures. The
1982 and 1984 NLTCSs were analyzed because (/) there
was no significant difference in disability from 1982 to
1984 (45), (//) the first two surveys are only two years
apart, and (///) pooling the two surveys doubles the number
of respondents (N = 12,000; about half of the total commu-
nity sample) with detailed interviews, increasing the preci-
sion of the baseline parameters describing the six dimen-
sions, which improves cross-temporal comparisons.
Dimension 1 is similar to the same dimension in Table 1
with no ADL or IADL impairments (except heavy house-
work) and few physical limitations. Dimension 2 has prob-
lems only with heavy housework. As in Table 1, dimension
2 is modestly more physically limited than dimension 1.
Dimension 3 has limited IADL impairments related to
mobility. In the 1982-1994 analysis, dimension 3 does not
have any IADLs impaired. Dimension 4 is similar to the
same dimension in Table 1, with one ADL (bathing) and
many IADLs impaired. There was little physical impair-
ment. Three IADLs related to dementia also characterize
this dimension -- as in 1982-1994. Dimensions 5 and 6
have similar traits to the same dimensions in Table 1. Thus,
the 1982-1984 and 1982-1994 dimensions are similar, i.e.,
there is little change in the content of the dimensions over
time. Differences are attributable to the improved precision
of estimates due to the addition of 922 nondisabled 1994
NLTCS community interview respondents. Less disabled
dimensions are better defined by this addition because in the
1982-1989 NLTCS, the number of nondisabled persons with
a detailed interview (500-900) was smaller (37). The sample
prevalences [i.e., mean gik
(t)s] in Table 1 are 4% higher for
dimensions 1-3 and 4% lower for dimensions 4-6.
The relation of the 1982-1984 dimensions to health con-
ditions are in Table 4.
Comparisons of Tables 2 and 4 show a 5% decline in the
number of conditions reported in 1982-1994 compared to
1982-1984. Dimensions 1-3 have 0.4, 32.3, and 8.1%
fewer conditions, i.e., their health burden declined. Dimen-
sion 4 reported more (5.9%) medical conditions. Dimen-
sion 5 reported 15.6% fewer conditions. Dimension 6 did
not change.
Thus, even without disability declines, the population
morbidity burden would decline. As in Table 2, dimension 1
has less than the average likelihood of having any condition.
Dimension 2 has moderate cardiopulmonary problems --
with a higher prevalence than in Table 2 -- consistent with
circulatory disease prevalence (and mortality) decline 1982-
1994. Dimension 3 has cardiopulmonary problems similar to
dimension 3 in Table 2 -- though more prevalent (e.g.,
nearly twice as many heart attacks) than 1982-1994. The
reduction of cardiopulmonary problems between the
1982-1984 and 1982-1994 analyses is conservatively biased
since the 1982-1994 \w()s are the average probability of
reporting a medical condition over all four surveys, i.e., a
decline in the 1982-1994 average probability will be smaller
than the 1989-1994 declines alone. Dimension 4, like its
counterpart in Table 2, has the second most stroke and
dementia. Dimension 5 has the most hip and other fractures
and paralysis. Dimension 6 has the most neurological disease
(stroke, dementia, multiple sclerosis, cerebral palsy, epilepsy,
and Parkinson's disease), cancer, and atherosclerosis.
The health conditions characterizing the six dimensions
are similar for 1982-1984 and 1982-1994, i.e., adding the
1989 and 1994 NLTCS data, where disability declines are
most evident, produced few changes in the relation of con-
ditions to dimensions. Changes are indicated by footnotes a
and b in Table 2. In dimension 2, seven conditions were no
longer the first or second most prevalent condition in 1982-
1994. One (cancer) increased. In dimension 3, three condi-
tions (cerebral palsy, cancer, other fractures) declined. Di-
mension 4 did not change. Dimensions 5 (+4) and 6 (+5)
had nine conditions increase in prevalence suggesting an
increase in the age at which conditions emerged (i.e., di-
mensions 2 and 3, with nine conditions with declining prev-
alence, are the two youngest; dimensions 5 and 6 with nine
conditions increasing in prevalence are 5 years older, on
average, than dimensions 1 and 2).
Disability changes 1982-1994. -- To compare the 1982
and 1994 population prevalences of disability, gik(t)s are
multiplied by adjusted sample weights for individuals
[wi(t)] in each survey year to translate sample frequencies
of traits into population frequencies. In addition, as de-
scribed above, we added a seventh dimension, weighted to
represent the institutional population in all four years, to
represent the entire U.S. elderly population.
In Table 5 the largest change (unadjusted for age) is an
increase of 2.3% in the prevalence of Dimension 1. Dimen-
sions 2 and 3 increased a net 0.44%. Thus, the nondisabled
population increased 2.74% from 1982-1994. The four dis-
abled dimensions decreased in prevalence. Though corre-
lated with age, conditioning on dimensions only partly
adjusts for age. In Table 5 we present sample weighted
mean gik
(t)s for 1982 standardized to the 1994 age distribu-

tion by five-year age categories from 65-69 to 95+. The
increase in the prevalence of dimensions 1-3 after age stan-
dardization is 3.51% -- close to the 3.6% increase in the
nondisabled population calculated using counts of ADLs
and IADLs impaired (20). The majority (56.1%) of the dis-
ability decline occurred in the two most impaired dimen-
sions (i.e., dimensions 6 and 7).

conditions. In Table 6 we present \w()s for dementia esti-
mated separately for 1982 and 1994 -- conditional on gik
(t)
estimates for all four years. Dementia was defined by a per-
son's inability to complete the SPMSQ (Short Portable
Mental Status Questionnaire) due to cognitive impairment
and the need for a proxy respondent, due to cognitive im-
pairment, to complete the survey. Thus, dementia was
based on (i) the inability to respond to the interview and (//)
observations of both the interviewer and a proxy respondent
about the person's cognitive state. Dementia is thus perfor-
mance based and severe -- not based on the self report of
dementia which may produce downwardly biased rate esti-
mates for persons with mild impairment. We present the
1982 prevalence of dementia estimated by multiplying the
\*m
/(1982) by the gik
(t)s for persons in the 1982 sample
multiplied by their sample weight [w,(1982)]. The 1982
prevalence of dementia standardized to the 1994 age distri-
bution is also presented. The 1994 prevalence is calculated
directly from \w(1994) multiplied by the gik(t)s for persons
in the 1994 sample and their sample weights [w,(1994)].
Dementia in the NLTCS represents severe impairment due
to all types of dementia, e.g., multi-infarct dementia as well
as AD.
Applying population weighted mean gik(t)s for 1982 to
the \im
/(1982) for the seven dimensions, produces a demen-
tia prevalence estimate of 5.41%. Multiplying 5.41% by the
1982 U.S. population aged 65+ (26.9 million) suggests 1.46
million persons had severe dementia in 1982. When the
1982 disability distribution is adjusted to the older 1994
population age distribution, prevalence increases to 5.68%.
Applying the 1982 prevalence (5.68%), age adjusted to the
1994 population distribution, yields an estimate of 1.88
million cases -- or 610,000 more cases than the 1.27 mil-
lion cases (3.84% prevalence) observed in 1994.
DISCUSSION
In Manton et al. (24) we examined declines 1982 to 1994
of counts of ADL and IADL impairments. Declines ob-
served 1982-1989 (45) continued to 1994. Here we exam-
ined dimensions identified from 27 ADL, IADL, and physi-
cal performance measures in the 1982, 1984, 1989, and
1994 NLTCS and their relation to 28 health conditions.
The scores calculated for the three dimensions with no
ADL or IADL disability increased 3.5%. The largest in-
crease, 3.3%, was for dimension 1 which had no ADL,
IADL, or physical impairments -- and the fewest medical
problems. Increases in these dimensions suggest that age-
related disability may be declining in the U.S. elderly popu-
lation. This is consistent with Gompertz shape parameters,
estimated from mortality for elderly U.S. cohorts, which
can be interpreted as biological rates of aging, declining
from older to younger cohorts observed 1960 to 1990 (46).
Changes in the average disability dimension scores are con-
sistent with those cohort results. However, being global
measures of physical and cognitive function in elderly per-
sons before death, disability scores may be interpreted as
more directly measuring changes in the biological rate of
aging -- or, as suggested above, in several dimensions of
biological aging.
These declines, being so rapid, could represent the inter-
action of exogenous factors with biological aging rates.
There are several possible causes of such declines. One is
that as the educational status of the population aged 65+
increased, their ability to comply with the complexities of

DYNAMICS OF DIMENSIONS OF DISABILITY B69
medical care for chronic conditions, and the ability to mod-
ify behavioral risk factors, improved. This is consistent
with chronic disease risk factor declines observed for per-
sons aged 65 to 74 from 1960 to 1990 (47). Risk factor
declines began early enough (i.e., 1960) that they could
contribute to the 1982-1994 chronic disease and disability
declines, i.e., after lags of 22-34 years. In addition, educa-
tion and occupation are negatively correlated with AD risk
-- through possibly different physiological mechanisms.
Second, improved medical technologies may reduce the
risk of chronically disabling diseases, and of chronic disabil-
ity causing other medical conditions, e.g., improvements,
started in the 1970s, in the surgical (48) and medical (49,50)
management of cardiovascular disease in persons aged 80+.
Conditions with the fewest clinical advances to date are neu-
rological conditions like AD. It was, therefore, interesting
that dementia prevalence declined from 1982 to 1994. This
could be due to increased education, better treatment of
non-AD dementias, or increased use of exogenous estrogens
and NSAIDs since the mid-1980s -- as well as changes in
comorbidity (e.g., stroke).
Third, improvements may result from better health care
coverage of the U.S. elderly population due to Medicare.
Though Medicare (and Medicaid) started in 1965, it is plau-
sible that there was a 15-20 year lag before improved cov-
erage affected chronic disability prevalence in the elderly
population because it takes time (/) for the U.S. health care
system to adjust to Medicare; (if) after the Medicare pro-
gram altered the U.S. health care system, before clinical
interventions delivered through that program altered
chronic disease prevalence; and (Hi) for reductions in
chronic disease prevalence to reduce chronic disability.
Finally, disability declines may be due to cohort differ-
ences in the age related loss of functioning due to different
early life experiences. Evidence of cohort differences in the
age trajectory of disability and mortality were found in the
1982-1989 NLTCS (31). The continuation of disability
declines to 1994 is consistent with younger cohorts having
different age trajectories of functional loss and mortality
risk. It is also possible the effects of Medicare, and im-
provements in clinical interventions, were delayed until
changes in the educational and income status of the U.S.
elderly population made them receptive to, and compliant
with, interventions.
It is likely that disability declines derive from all four
sources -- with the relative contribution of the first three
factors changing over time with cohort factors being persis-
tent. These results have practical, and scientific, implica-
tions. Associated with declines in disability were declines
in specific medical problems which could yield large cost
savings.
To explain dementia prevalence declines from 1982--
1994 it is important that a significant portion of dementia is
not due to AD. Some causes of non-AD dementia are
reversible or preventable, e.g., nutritional deficiencies, mul-
tiple cerebral infarction, or psychiatric disorders. In addi-
tion, education is correlated with AD incidence. Stern et al.
(51) found persons with 8+ years of education had a 60%
lower incidence of AD at age 80 (18%) than persons with
<8 vears (32%). The effect was largest for cases with clear
AD diagnoses. Occupation had a similar effect on AD inci-
dence, though, because of differences in parietotemporal
perfusion, possibly by different mechanisms. There was
also an interaction of "high" occupation (jobs involving
mental functioning) and high education. At age 85, high
education reduced AD prevalence 51.7%, high occupation
29.6%. Persons with high education and occupation had a
71.7% reduction (i.e., 60% vs 17%).
Thus, education and occupation's effects on AD are large
enough to cause measurable declines in prevalence due to
large increases in education in the elderly population from
1982-1994 (52). In addition, AD risk changes may be re-
lated to nutritional and drug use trends. Antioxidants (e.g.,
vitamin E) may reduce oxidative neurological damage asso-
ciated with AD pathology (4,53). Preliminary data suggests
NSAIDs and exogenous estrogens delays AD onset -- for
exogenous estrogens in women by 5-8 years. Though not
indicated as therapy for AD, the number of U.S. post-
menopausal females taking estrogens increased from 3 mil-
lion in 1985 to 10 million in 1995. Such factors may have
caused dementia to decline in England over the last
25 years -- despite improved survival (54). Finally, AD
manifestation may be related to the joint occurrence of
stroke (3,55), early hypertension (56), or atherosclerosis
(57). The three possible cofactors all declined from
1982-1994. Calculations made for severe dementia suggest
that a decline of 610,000 cases implied cost savings of
roughly $26 billion in 1996. Thus, a slowing of biological
aging, to the extent it is plausibly manifest in reduced mor-
tality, morbidity, and disability, could have important impli-
cations for U.S. health costs.
