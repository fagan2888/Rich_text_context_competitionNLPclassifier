Exploring innovative learning
culture in the newsroom
Ornella Porcu
University of Groningen, The Netherlands
Abstract
Culture has been viewed as the biggest obstacle to change in the legacy media newsroom.
Older as well as recent literature points out that professional culture typically hinders
newsroom innovation processes, and newsrooms in transformation often seem to find
culture clashes on their path. These transformational problems, however, appear to be
viewed predominantly from a management point of view. By looking at journalism culture
from the broader perspective of a learning culture which fosters innovation, including
both management and newsroom workers, a more nuanced picture can be presented.
In this article, the concept of innovative learning culture is introduced to provide a
different lens through which drivers and obstacles of innovation in the newsroom can
be observed. Furthermore, innovative learning culture can be used in empirical research
to gain insights in the learning and innovation processes of professional journalists, a
strikingly under-researched area. As such, innovative learning culture as a concept fills
gaps in the empirical as well as in the more theoretical literature, which may enhance
future newsroom research.

Introduction
In this article, the concept of innovative learning culture (ILC) is explored, referring to a
learning culture that triggers and fosters innovation in the legacy media newsroom.
Innovation processes are of key interest to the study of journalism, as legacy media

organizations are expected to transform their newsrooms towards multi-media online
platforms to maximize chances for long-term survival (Küng, 2015; Westlund and Lewis,
2014). The reasons for exploring the concept of ILC are 3-fold.
First, research on learning and innovation processes in the legacy media newsroom is
scarce. Studies on learning processes are limited to student experiences in journalism
education (Brandon, 2002; Steel et al., 2007; Steensen, 2016). Learning and innovation
are inextricably linked (Brown and Duguid, 1991, 1998; Kline and Rosenberg, 1986;
March, 1991). However, apart from the scholarly attention to newsroom (multi)skilling,
which refers to acquiring the skills necessary to deal with new technologies (Cottle and
Ashton, 1999; Nygren, 2014; Wallace, 2013), the question of how journalists actually
learn in the newsroom, and how they learn to innovate in it, is still an under-researched
area. By addressing these issues using ILC as a perspective, new insights in learning and
innovation processes can be gained when studying newsrooms in transformation.
Second, newsroom studies tend to lack insights into the cultural prerequisites of inno-
vation. This is remarkable, as at the same time culture is perceived to be the biggest
obstacle to change in journalism (Ekdale et al., 2015; Ryfe, 2012). Yet the bulk of the
studies on the transformation of a traditional newsroom to one offering `a truly continu-
ous product' with multi-media and online platforms (Dickinson et al., 2013: 4) mainly
focus on the diffusion of technological innovation and the management of this diffusion
(Rogers, 2003). However, technology is never a driver for action all by itself, as it is
inextricably linked to the social and cultural context (Boczkowski, 2004; Cottle and
Ashton, 1999; Dickinson et al., 2013; Örnebring, 2010). Newsroom workers will, for
example, need to have a welcoming mind-set to new technologies, if they want to profit
from possible online options (Borger, 2016). As the cultural side of innovation has yet to
be thoroughly understood, ILC can help identify cultural drivers and obstacles of innova-
tion processes in the newsroom.
Third, newsroom studies that do deal with the cultural side of innovation view culture
predominantly as problematic, and they typically view it from a management perspec-
tive. Culture tends to be viewed in terms of culture clashes as a result of transformational
processes (Lee-Wright, 2010; Lewis, 2012). Professional culture specifically is seen as a
hindrance to innovation in the newsroom, and this culture is said to be very hard to
change (Borger, 2016; Buijs, 2014; Ryfe, 2012; Tameling, 2015; Usher, 2014).
Notwithstanding the interesting and detailed analyses in these studies, at least five pre-
suppositions seem to underlie their conclusions: (1) change is positive, (2) newsroom
management initiates change, (3) journalists do not appear to comply enough, (4) this
impacts the planned change negatively and (5) for this ­ predominantly ­ journalists are
to blame. Seen from a management point of view, journalists do not seem to act as they
are told by their superiors, hence they get the finger pointed at them. Using ILC as a
concept, encompassing both management and journalists, a more nuanced picture of
newsroom innovation processes can be achieved.
Looking at the latter reason for introducing ILC, studying change from a management
perspective is not limited to the study of journalism, as it characterizes a large part of the
organizational change literature (Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2008). Generally speaking,
these situations are viewed from only one side of the story, that of the change agents, the
ones that, as often occurs, initiate change. Whereas the change recipients, the people
Porcu 3
who are supposed to undergo or execute change, are systematically portrayed in a nega-
tive way (Dent and Goldberg, 1999; Ford et al., 2008; King and Anderson, 1995; Meston
and King, 1996). This management perspective, then, may blur thorough understandings
of what actually goes on in the newsroom, informing the common held belief that jour-
nalists are just too conservative to innovate (Smit, 2013). Following Ekdale et al. (2015),
who have countered this view as `to miss the point' (p. 955), this article assumes that a
more integrated view is needed to understand, for instance, the findings of these authors.
They show that journalists actually are open to innovation, provided their professional
ideology is not tampered with and their management demonstrates a clear vision, while
it communicates unambiguously to newsroom workers what is expected of them.
In the larger context, media scholars stress the need for radical change and urge legacy
media organizations to hurry, to escape `the valley of death' they are in (Küng, 2015:
105) to maximize chances for survival (Küng, 2015; Storsul and Krumsvik, 2013;
Westlund and Lewis, 2014). However, change just for the sake of it, even radical change,
may not be enough to ensure future survival of news organizations. Innovation is differ-
ent from change in that the former contains elements of novelty. Innovation thus may be
viewed as part of organizational change, but not all organizational change relates to
innovation (Evans, 2016). Instead of viewing change, innovation and long-term survival
as processes having to do with an adaptation to technology, a more productive and inclu-
sive view may come from the perspective of resilient organizations (Seville, 2017).
Resilient organizations do more than merely adapt and survive the next external threat.
Instead, they `are future-ready, with an inbuilt capacity not only to weather the storms of
change, but to be able to thrive in such environments'(Seville, 2017: 3). Resilient organi-
zations, the author states, have an intrinsic drive to thrive and create their own new
opportunities, while riding and exploring the waves of crises and changes. According to
Seville, resilience emerges from an organizational culture that evolves around people
first, not technology. The author sums up five major ingredients resilient organizations
cannot do without: leadership, staff engagement, effective partnerships, situation aware-
ness and innovation and creativity. This article is mainly concerned with the last, and not
the least, two ingredients on the list.
In this article, a theoretical framework on ILC is introduced, where ILC is understood
as a learning culture that drives and fosters innovation in the newsroom. It seeks to
address the overarching questions of what the cultural parameters for learning and inno-
vation in the newsroom are and how professional journalists learn and innovate in it. In
other words, does the newsroom culture allow for new ideas, and what are the drivers
and obstacles for those new ideas to blossom and, ultimately, to lead to innovation in the
newsroom? Looking at the key reasons for exploring ILC, we can use ILC as a concep-
tual perspective, a `looking glass', as well as an analytical tool to discover possible driv-
ers for, and obstacles of, innovation processes. This article is mainly concerned with
introducing ILC as a conceptual perspective.
The following pages are written with newspaper organizations in mind. Not only
because the digital disruption seems to impact the newspaper industry more dramatically
than other legacy media (Evans, 2016). Print organizations also find it more difficult to
change than other news media do (Tameling, 2015). This may be due, at least in part, to
the largely unchanged print production processes until today. ILC takes an
4 Journalism 00(0)
interdisciplinary approach by building on empirical and theoretical insights not only
from journalism studies but also from educational sciences, innovation studies and
organizational sciences. This relevant body of literature is used to enrich the study of
innovation processes in journalism. The following paragraphs explain how a definition
of ILC is derived, what this concept consists of, and how it fills gaps in the existing
literature.
Theoretical context
The ultimate goal of using ILC as a concept is to discover to what extent the cultural
prerequisites for innovation are actually present in the transforming newsroom, and how
such a culture can be triggered and fostered to enhance innovation processes. By analys-
ing drivers and obstacles for ILC in the newsroom, newspapers can be helped to reinvent
themselves. The following definition of ILC is used:
innovative learning culture is a social climate that stimulates people to work and learn
together, to grow as an individual and as a group (team, organization), and that provides
people with the autonomy needed to be flexible, to experiment, to be creative, and to investigate
radical possibilities in order for the organization to have better chances for survival in the long
run. This is facilitated by serving leadership, open communication, mutual trust, a supporting
culture, shared goals, appreciation of individual achievement, and training and development.
ILC as a concept builds upon prior insights regarding professional learning culture
(PLC), a term coined by Oberon et al. (2014), and processes concerning explorative
innovation (Bartlett and Goshal, 1989; Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; March, 1991;
O'Reilly and Tushman, 2013). Expanding upon these authors, PLC and explorative inno-
vation culture (EIC) have been conceptualized and are explicated in detail below. ILC is
argued to be the conceptual sum of PLC and EIC (see Figure 1).
PLC
To understand what PLC stands for, it is important to first look at its related concepts:
culture, organizational culture, learning culture and PLC.
Culture and organizational culture.How to view culture and organizational culture that
stems from it? Smircich (1983) divides the research approaches to culture and organiza-
tional culture into two strands: culture seen as a variable, something the organization has
(and can be changed for managerial purposes), and culture regarded as a root metaphor,
viewed as something an organization is. According to Smircich, organizations are cul-
tures. Schein (1990) combines the two strands but predominantly sees culture as some-
thing that is changeable. He views organizational culture as having three interrelated
levels of culture: external observable artefacts, internal values and even deeper underly-
ing basic assumptions. In reaction to Smircich's (1983) distinction, Grey (2009) sees two
sorts of organizational cultures. One is a `real', spontaneous and informal one. That is, it
is a culture `but it doesn't necessarily conform to what managers want'. The other is a
Porcu 5
formally `imposed' culture, `based on the idea that cultural values are hierarchically
defined, that is by senior managers or by head office' (Grey, 2009: 73).
These considerations give rise to the question to what extent organizational culture
actually can be changed at all? Alvesson and Sveningsson (2008) see cultural change as
`wishful thinking and fantasies' (p. 35) and are sceptical of the high expectations a large
part of the organizational literature seems to foster. The authors do, however, build upon
Schein's mental model approach, adding the `construction of meaning and sense making'
(Alvesson and Sveningsson, 2008: 37) and how these are expressed in language, stories
and rituals: `culture refers to what stands behind and guides behaviour rather than the
behaviour as such' (p. 36). Not only can an organizational culture be expressed in terms
of language, stories and rituals but also its meanings are shaped by organizational mem-
bers, as culture is produced in social interaction and the processes that derive from these
interactions (Pantjes, 2013). Based on these authors, for the purpose of this article, the
following definition of organizational culture will be considered:
organizational culture is the whole of conscious and unconscious assumptions, norms and
values of members of an organization (or group), processed by spontaneous construction and
dynamic sense making among members, resulting in concrete expressions or artefacts.
This definition is the basic understanding of how a learning culture that fosters inno-
vation is viewed in this article. It is assumed that all cultural aspects of an organization
are part of organizational culture. Hence, learning culture, PLC and ILC are part of
organizational culture.
Learning culture and PLC.For an organization to innovate at all, it has to be open to
change and cannot do without a strong learning culture that improves innovative capa-
bilities (Heijboer et al., 2013). A learning culture is about allowing creativity and flexi-
bility into the organization, according to Van Der Merwe and Quinlan (2010). In the
educational sciences literature, learning culture is not an unknown term when dealing
with pupils or students. Where the learning culture of teachers is concerned, the term
professional learning culture is used (Oberon et al., 2014). Only those organizations that
encourage a true culture of learning among their members have the best chances to inno-
vate (Cameron and Quinn, 2011; Heijboer et al., 2013), to obtain advantages over the
competition (Baars-Van Moorsel, 2003; Watkins and Marsick, 1996; Yolles, 2009), to
transform themselves by creating new knowledge (Schenke, 2015) and to

survive disruptions in the long run (March, 1991; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2013). Exact
definitions of learning culture, however, are scarce. The term is generally used in an
informal way to indicate a social context or climate that is favourable to learning (Baars-
Van Moorsel, 2003). Heijboer et al. (2013) describe learning culture as `a collective,
dynamic system of basic assumptions, values and norms, that guides how people learn in
an organization' (p. 6), based on Schein (1990). Learning culture then is an observable
artefact, steered by experienced norms as well as more deeper underlying basic assump-
tions, the latter being unobservable. Both Heijboer et al. (2013) and Pantjes (2013),
based on Watkins and Marsick (1996), consider a learning culture to be a collective
learning culture, and not an individual learning culture. Only a collective learning culture
can make sure continuous learning in the organization takes place. Pantjes (2013) distin-
guishes three key characteristics (leadership, collaboration and communication) that dif-
fer in individual and collective learning cultures. In an individual learning culture, the
focus is on formal education, predominantly in official courses, the leadership style is
directive, there is little collaboration between the organizational members and communi-
cation is said to be one-sided or closed. In a collective learning culture, on the other hand,
there is formal and informal learning, the leadership style is participative, among the
members there is considerable collaboration and there is an open and transparent dia-
logue in the organization.
In trying to get a grip on collective learning culture, strikingly, neither Heijboer et al.
(2013) nor Pantjes (2013) mention trust as an element. While it is trust that seems to be
a key condition to be able to learn collectively. Wenger et al. (2002) state, when speaking
about communities of practices:
Learning requires an atmosphere of openness. Each community develops a unique atmosphere
[...] the key is to build a foundation for collective inquiry. An effective community of practice
offers a place of exploration where it is safe to speak the truth and ask hard questions. Trust is
key to this process. (p. 37)
Another argument to include trust as a key element is that trust is needed to be able to
firmly discuss and to debate matters, and not avoid conflicts. As Wenger et al. (2002)
state, strong communities cannot do without conflict as `members can even use conflict
as a way to deepen their relationships and their learning' (p. 37). The aspect of trust
comes back in the educational research literature (Oberon et al., 2014). In the literature
on resilient organizations, this theme returns as `high trust', which resilient organizations
cannot do without (Seville, 2017: 18). Based on these authors, it seems logical to view
trust as an important element for a strong learning culture in an organization. Oberon
et al. (2014) define their PLC in schools as `a climate in which all members in a school
work together to reflect, to research and to professionalize' (p. 6). This definition can be
seen as an integration of the earlier mentioned aspects of learning culture from other
authors. Oberon et al. (2014) also make an explicit distinction between characteristics of
PLC (collaboration, learning from each other, inquiring attitude) and conditions for a
PLC (leadership, communication, support, mutual trust). Based on Oberon et al. (2014),
PLC's definition is the following:
Porcu 7
professional learning culture is a social climate in which all members of a newsroom learn by
working together to reflect, to research and to professionalize. This is facilitated by serving
leadership, clear communication, support among the members, and mutual trust in each other
and in the organization.
Having dealt with PLC, we continue with EIC, which constitutes the other conceptual
part of ILC.
EIC
Innovation is the implementation of an idea into a market or a social setting (Fagerberg,
2005). For organizations to survive in the long run, the execution of both exploitative and
explorative innovation is paramount (March, 1991; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004, 2013).
March (1991) defines exploitative innovation in terms of exploiting old certainties, char-
acterized by refinement, choice, production, efficiency, selection, implementation and
execution. He describes explorative innovation as exploring new possibilities, character-
ized by search, variation, risk-taking, experimenting, play, flexibility, discovery and
innovation. In the newsroom, explorative innovation may translate into discovering and
experimenting with new ways of reaching audiences, other ways of working, novel ways
of thinking and using tools that may lead to new business opportunities.
The orientation of people within print newsrooms, however, is predominantly still
on the newspaper (Buijs, 2014; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2004; Ryfe, 2012; Smit, 2013;
Tameling, 2015; Tameling and Broersma, 2012, 2013; Usher, 2014), and thus reflects
a predominance of a culture of exploitative innovation. Storsul and Krumsvik (2013)
find that in media organizations, as elsewhere, most innovations are incremental and
involve small changes in products or processes that do not challenge the logic of the
market. For the newspaper industry, this means that by doing what it always has done,
it will find itself challenged or disrupted by outsiders who are more engaged in
explorative innovation. By doing so, the newspaper business risks obsoleteness
(Küng, 2015).
According to March (1991), the efficiency and short term rationality of organizations
tend to lead automatically to exploitative innovation with its typical lack of experiments,
and its precise and predictable outcomes. The author sees this tendency as `potentially
self-destructive' (March, 1991: 73) for an organization. March's statements date from
long before the Internet, Google and Facebook disrupted the news industry. Since explo-
ration is vital to newspapers' long-term survival as it informs the ability to reinvent
themselves, the question is whether and how explorative innovation is actually triggered
and fostered in print newsrooms. Newspapers with an online presence may just be copy-
ing their competitors, rather than harvest the fruits of their own explorative innovation.
Furthermore, research has shown that online journalism seems to be less innovative than
many scholars had foreseen (Steensen, 2009), leaving questions open to why this is pos-
sible. One explanation for this may lie in the somewhat adventurous side of explorative
innovation. Experimenting without knowing the outcome beforehand can be quite
expensive (March, 1991). Another explanation may lie in the observation that new tech-
nology alone is no guarantee innovation takes place (Borger, 2016).
8 Journalism 00(0)
Based on the apparent poor explorative innovational capabilities of newsrooms
(Buijs, 2014; Ryfe, 2009, 2012; Tameling, 2015; Usher, 2014), as well as on the neces-
sity to explore for legacy media in trying to survive (Küng, 2015; O'Reilly and Tushman,
2013), ILC encompasses an inherent focus on EIC. As mentioned before, it is this type
of innovation culture that is specifically called for in legacy print newsrooms to avoid
extinction (March, 1991; O'Reilly and Tushman, 2013). To come to a definition of EIC,
different authors are taken into account. Following Oberon et al. (2014) with PLC, we
look for characteristics of, as well as conditions for, EIC. The following eight charac-
teristics are found, based on March (1991) and O'Reilly and Tushman (2013): insecu-
rity (of the outcome of innovation), (re)search/investigation, discovery, autonomous,
creative, experimental, flexible and radical. The conditions for EIC are based on Bartlett
and Goshal (1989) and Gibson and Birkinshaw (2004): trust, support, supporting cul-
ture, shared goals, collective identity, appreciation of individual achievement, training
and development and culture of excellence. Based on these, we adopt the following
definition:
explorative innovation culture is a social climate in which people are supported to (relatively)
autonomously investigate, experiment, be flexible and learn to develop creative new and/or
radical ideas, products, services or ways of working that ultimately will improve the news
organization's market position and increase its chances of survival in the long run. This is
facilitated by trust, supporting culture, shared goals, collective identity, appreciation of
individual achievement, training and development, and a culture of excellence.
With both critical ingredients present, we can now look at what they mean for ILC. As
mentioned earlier, ILC is the conceptual sum of PLC and EIC. When looking at the char-
acteristics and conditions for both, we see both overlap and differences between the two
concepts. To start with the differences, PLC is aimed, literally, at learning while working
together. It is about togetherness: working together ­ while reflecting, investigating and
professionalizing ­ to grow with each other. EIC's focus is on searching and experiment-
ing, stressing the relative autonomy needed for the individual or a small group to do so,
instead of doing this collectively. The individual and his or her achievement count.
Togetherness is an option, not a necessity. EIC, however, does support the individual(s)
engaged in explorative innovation. The overlap between the two concerns the room the
organization provides its members to develop. After the elimination of synonyms, seven
characteristics and seven conditions for ILC remain.
To arrive at these ILC characteristics and conditions, the following process has been
adopted. `Learning from each other' has been favoured over `collaboration', as the for-
mer is the fruit of collaboration that is considered relevant here, and `inquiring attitude'
has been eliminated in favour of `(re)search/investigation', as the latter term is consid-
ered more specific. Both `insecurity' and `discovery' have been discarded; the former is
an intrinsic aspect of all things `experimental' and as such has been viewed as overlap.
The second may or may not be an outcome of `experimental'or `(re)search/investigation'
and, with respect to ILC, is regarded less crucial than the process that could lead towards
it. For conditions, `support' has been eliminated in favour of the more richer term `sup-
portive culture'which refers to a larger culture perceived as being supportive, rather than
Porcu 9
the incidental support given in a certain situation. Furthermore, `mutual trust' has been
favoured over `trust' as the former expresses better its reciprocate core, and `culture of
excellence' has been discarded for reasons of irrelevancy. `Excellence' is inclined to be
defined as what is `known' to be excellent, whereas the future outcomes of explorative
innovation are insecure by their very nature. `Collective identity', finally, has been elimi-
nated because it would, at most, only refer to the PLC part of ILC. To sum up, the seven
characteristics of ILC, and their brief definitions, are as follows:
1. Learning from each other learning from others in the workplace community
2. (Re)search/investigation investigation aimed at improving (one's) work
3. Experimental trying out new possibilities with insecure outcomes
4. Autonomous agency to make decisions about (one's own) work
5. Creative inspiring the development of new ideas
6. Radical stimulating all that is very different from the usual
7. Flexible capacity of people to easily adjust, switch or change
The seven conditions for ILC, and their brief definitions, are as follows:
1. Leadership 
management focussing on enabling people to change
2. Communication open dialogue between members in the organization
3. Mutual trust people trusting each other in the organization
4. Supporting culture
climate wherein receiving support is self-evident
5. Shared goals
workers and management pursuing the same targets
6. Appreciation 
explicit appreciation of individual success
7. Training & development systematic attention for the development of people
Relevance
In the following sections, it is shown how ILC can be relevant to the empirical study of
newsroom transformation and how it may add to the literature on media innovation
theory.
Empirical relevance
From the new millennium and onwards, scholars of journalism studies and media inno-
vation have been focussing mainly on how newsrooms adapt to the new technological
reality, rather than on newsrooms' capacity to reinvent themselves. The latter entails a
larger scope than just reacting to external incentives, as it taps into the intrinsic resilience
of a newsroom, hardly researched in journalism studies. This inherently leaves a poten-
tial area of research waiting to be addressed. ILC can be an instrument to access this
under-researched area.
In the larger part of newsroom studies, the focus on management, which sees culture
as a problem, appears to be dominant. A closer look of these aspects illustrates to what
extent they relate to ILC.
10 Journalism 00(0)
Management. The fact that technological change in the newsroom is most often a man-
agement decision has not gone unnoticed in the literature (MacGregor, 1997; Singer,
2004a). It is a so-called authority innovation decision (Rogers, 2003) as opposed to a
collectively or an individually made one. This may have consequences for the adoption
and, hence, the diffusion of innovation (Rogers, 2003). Change processes in the news-
room are therefore to be regarded as socially constructed, whereby technology is an
instrument for other goals to be achieved, for example, to enhance the quality of journal-
ism or the quality of production processes. Goals may also encompass efficiency, such as
getting more production out of multi-skilled and flexible resources (Saltzis and Dickin-
son, 2008), or cost-cutting through lay-offs as a result of reorganizations (Cottle and
Ashton, 1999; Saltzis and Dickinson, 2008). Hence, some newsroom studies are specifi-
cally concerned with management issues on how to manage transformation processes
and if these goals are achieved or not (Gade, 2004; Gade and Perry, 2003; Gade and
Raviola, 2009; Killebrew, 2003; Sylvie and Gade, 2009).
ILC, however, focusses on what happens in the newsroom with respect to what pre-
cedes an actual innovation, as it is concerned with the available room for new ideas to
blossom (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986). The focal interest thus is to discover to what
extent people in the newsroom experience an ILC that triggers and fosters explorative
innovation, as mentioned earlier. As ILC refers to a specific culture in the newsroom,
the concept can be operationalized in quantitative as well as qualitative research instru-
ments, which allows for measuring the perceptions of ILC of both journalists and their
managers. This is briefly explored at the end of this paragraph. By avoiding a manage-
ment-centred view on change, this enhances a more nuanced picture of newsroom
transformation.
Culture clashes. Empirical newsroom studies typically have focussed on the impact of
technological innovation on journalistic work practices, the quality of journalistic prod-
ucts and the management of these processes. Interestingly, a good part of the findings of
these studies appears to be more about culture clashes in the newsroom as a result of
transformation, than about the diffusion of technology, which was the primary aspect
some of these studies were set out to measure.
Transformational processes have been reported on, in some studies, with moderate
optimism. The quality of journalistic products has not been altered by these processes, at
least some research on mixed-media newsrooms (Huang et al., 2004, 2006; Meier, 2007)
state. Technological innovation processes have also triggered American journalists to see
clear advantages for themselves as a result of the transformation, despite consistent cul-
tural issues that need to be overcome (Singer, 2004a).
Despite this optimism, the outcome of the bulk of newsroom studies is that making
the transition from a traditional print newsroom to a more online oriented one is quite
hard to achieve. This may not come as a surprise, as newsrooms find themselves in a
paradigm shift, being forced economically to trade a 20th-century offer-focussed produc-
tion model for a 21st-century demand-focussed one (Domingo et al., 2007). This can
result in fear and anxiety, and hence in clashes in the newsroom (Killebrew, 2003).
Different newsroom studies show culture clashes as a result of transformation. Gade
(2004) finds a clash of cultures between `the core values of two cultures ­ marketing and
Porcu 11
journalism' (p. 45). Van den Bulck and Tambuyzer (2013) even distinguish several cul-
ture clashes: `between organizational versus professional [...] culture [...], between the
impact of technological versus human factors [...] and between news managers and
news workers' (p. 54).
The biggest culture clashes, however, seem to occur between management and news-
room workers. Perceptions of transformation and their effects typically seem to differ
between these two parties (Beam, 2006; Buijs, 2014; Cottle and Ashton, 1999; Daniels
and Hollifield, 2002; Ekdale et al., 2015; Gade, 2004; Gade and Perry, 2003; Ryfe, 2009,
2012; Saltzis and Dickinson, 2008; Singer, 2004a, 2004b; Smith et al., 2007; Tameling,
2015; Tameling and Broersma, 2013; Usher, 2014; Van Den Bulck and Tambuyzer,
2013). Different authors give different words to this phenomenon. Gade (2004) described
it as a `gulf' (p. 45) between marketing and journalism, Quinn (2005) states it to be `the
fundamental dichotomy'between a business ideal and a journalistic ideal (p. 29) and Van
Den Bulck and Tambuyzer (2013) speak about multiple `collisions of convergence' all
closely related to a clash between `organizational and professional [...] culture' (p. 54).
These different perceptions of transformation between journalists and management seem
difficult to resolve (Gade, 2004; Gade and Perry, 2003; Gade and Raviola, 2009;
Killebrew, 2003; Sylvie and Gade, 2009).
In these studies, management is, at least in part, held accountable for their outdated
management structures, their poor communication and coaching skills and their vague-
ness in general of how to translate transformation processes into everyday practices for
the people they manage (Killebrew, 2003; Ryfe, 2009, 2012; Sylvie and Gade, 2009;
Tameling, 2015; Tameling and Broersma, 2013). But at the same time in these studies
journalists are seen as being reluctant to change because of their professional culture
(Buijs, 2014; Ryfe, 2009, 2012; Sylvie and Gade, 2009; Tameling, 2015; Usher, 2014).
This culture, however, most often has not been defined in a way that it can be operation-
alized. Using ILC, focussing on learning and innovation processes of both management
and news workers, professional culture in the innovating newsroom can be made more
tangible and, hence, more accessible to eventual transformation.
Professional identity. In earlier as well as present newsroom studies, it is suggested that the
apparent reluctance of journalists to change lies in what journalists perceive transforma-
tion to mean for their professional role as a journalist, as it may endanger their ability to
produce quality journalism (Beam, 2006; Cottle and Ashton, 1999; Daniels and Holli-
field, 2002; Ekdale et al., 2015; Gade and Perry, 2003; Gade and Raviola, 2009; Lewis,
2012; Ryfe, 2009, 2012; Saltzis and Dickinson, 2008; Smith et al., 2007; Tameling,
2015). In short, when transformation is perceived as incompatible with, or entrenching
upon, journalistic norms and professional identity, transformation is regarded as rather
negative. If it is true, as Ekdale et al. (2015) point out, that journalists are not opposed to
change or innovation per se, this poses questions currently not addressed, such as how do
journalists actually take in new things? How do they, the newsroom workers, actually
learn in the newsroom? To what extent do journalists perceive a learning culture in the
newsroom that fosters change and innovation? And how do they keep up with techno-
logical developments while proper training is often been denied to journalists, even when
journalists themselves are eager to learn (Küng, 2008; Singer, 2004b; Steensen, 2009)?

The concept of ILC can be operationalized into different research instruments to
address these kinds of questions. The focus of this article is a conceptual one, but to
touch briefly upon the operationalization of the ILC concept, a mixed-methods research
approach seems suitable. One can think of measuring perceptions of the characteristics
and conditions of ILC in a survey, distributed among newsroom management and work-
ers. This can be followed up with interviews with management and workers, not only to
validate the survey results but also to ask them whether they can explain the outcomes of
the survey. Together with a separate ethnographic study, focussing on the characteristics
and conditions of ILC in the newsroom with respect to new ideas, this could round up a
newsroom study that seeks to answer to what extent, and how, ILC is being perceived,
and what happens with new ideas in the newsroom.
Theoretical relevance
The media landscape is innovating and scholars increasingly refer to the innovation con-
cept, but at the same time notice an academic gap, as it misses more theoretical and
methodological contributions (Dogruel, 2014, 2015; Küng, 2008). According to Evans
(2016), the innovation speak in both journalism and journalism studies has been so `ram-
pant' (p. 1) that it is turning into a problem, `because many institutions may strive for
innovation without enough reflection on what that term actually means to them' (pp.
1­2). For an overview of the literature on innovation theory, see Crossan and Apaydin
(2010), Fagerberg (2005), Fagerberg and Verspagen (2009), Fagerberg et al. (2012) and
Hall and Rosenberg (2010).
Dogruel (2014, 2015) sees a limitation in the current literature on media innova-
tion with its narrow focus on diffusion, adoption and acceptance of the final techno-
logical innovation product that enters a market or is implemented in a media
organization. This largely ignores the design and development stages of innovation.
Innovation theory, however, stresses that innovation encompasses an entire cycle
from its invention ­ an idea ­ to its diffusion or implementation (Kline and Rosenberg,
1986). Dogruel calls for an integrated approach that fits the innovation cycle in all its
phases. ILC as a concept answers Dogruel's call. It focusses on learning processes in
the newsroom and takes an inherent interest in the initial phases of innovation devel-
opment (Kline and Rosenberg, 1986), which starts with a new idea, and the room for
development of that new idea. Learning processes may also entail the whole innova-
tion cycle, from idea to diffusion, therefore answering Dogruel's call for an integrated
approach.
The biggest gap in the media innovation literature, however, seems to be the scarcity
in scholarly attention to learning and innovation processes of professional journalists in
innovating newsrooms. This is striking, because innovation, as mentioned earlier, is
inextricably linked to learning processes: without learning there is no innovation.
However, for people to be able to learn at all, a social climate with a certain level of trust
is needed to allow for people to learn, experiment, dare to make mistakes and dare to
disagree (Seville, 2017; Wenger et al., 2002). In the context of resilient news organiza-
tions, this asks for a perspective that inherently looks at the development of people first
and then technology, not the other way around (Seville, 2017). This is when ILC as a new
Porcu 13
perspective can step in when operationalized. When doing so, and following Tavakoli
(2010), it may be the case that current culture clashes in transforming newsrooms will be
seen in a more productive light and hence, not as a `clash' any more.
Conclusion
In this article, it is argued that the concept of ILC can constitute a new lens to look at
newsroom learning and innovation processes, an under-researched area. With the defini-
tion of ILC and its underlying characteristics and conditions, the concept can be opera-
tionalized in further research. With an ILC perspective, including both management and
journalists, culture in the newsroom can be made more tangible than is found in the lit-
erature thus far. This may result in insights in how professionals in the newsroom actu-
ally learn and innovate, and to what extent a learning culture allows them to do so in the
first place. ILC can detect the drivers and obstacles for newsroom learning and innova-
tion processes that have not been identified earlier, as newsrooms have not been consid-
ered from a learning culture perspective before. Furthermore, with ILC a closer look can
be taken at the newsroom's own capabilities for innovation, as ILC taps into the intrinsic
resilience and creativity of the newsroom.
