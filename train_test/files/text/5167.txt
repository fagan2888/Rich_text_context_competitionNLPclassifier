Introduction
Psoriasis is a chronic inflammatory skin disorder character-
ized by keratinocyte hyperproliferation and increased blood
flow induced by the stimulation of tissue-resident immune
cells by markedly altered cutaneous cytokine profiles.1,2
Vitiligo is a progressive depigmenting disorder character-
ized by the loss of functional melanocytes from the epider-
mis and affects 1­2% of the world population.3 Rheumatoid
arthritis (RA) is a chronic inflammatory disease of predom-
inantly synovial joints that causes significant morbidity and
shortens life expectancy.4 Although the etiology of these
diseases is not fully understood, interactions between a sus-
ceptible genetic background and environmental factors
have been suggested.5
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) converts angio-
tensin I into angiotensin II and inactivates bradykinin via
the kallikrein­kininogen system.6 Angiotensin II is the
main effector molecule of the renin­angiotensin­system
(RAS), is pleiotropic, and is a mediator of the development
and progression of diseases.7 Furthermore, angiotensin II is
a potent pro-inflammatory modulator that augments and
perpetuates the immune response.7 The ACE gene, located
on chromosome 17q23, contains an insertion (I)/deletion
(D) polymorphism within intron 16 that may contain or
lack a 287 bp repeat sequence.8 The DD genotype is associ-
ated with approximately a two-fold higher tissue and
plasma concentration of ACE than the II genotype.8 Thus, it
seems possible that the D allele could play a role in the
pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases.

Abstract
Introduction: The purpose of this study was to examine whether the insertion (I) and deletion (D) of angiotensin-
converting enzyme (ACE) polymorphism confers susceptibility to psoriasis, vitiligo and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).
Materials and methods: A meta-analysis was conducted on the association between the ACE I/D polymorphisms and
psoriasis, vitiligo and RA.
Results: Fifteen studies comprising five on psoriasis, five on vitiligo and five on RA were available for the meta-analysis
consisting of 2094 cases and 2871 controls. Meta-analysis of the DD+ID genotype showed significant associations with
psoriasis (odds ratio (OR) 0.753, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.601­0.921, p = 0.006). Meta-analysis showed no associa-
tion between vitiligo and the ACE I/D polymorphism. Meta-analysis of the DD+ID genotype showed an association with
RA (OR 2.199, 95% CI 1.379­3.506, p = 0.001). Ethnicity-specific meta-analysis of the D allele showed no association
with psoriasis in Europeans, and vitiligo in South Asians. However, subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed a significant
association between the D allele and RA in Arab populations (OR 2.697, 95% CI 1.803­4.034, p = 1.3 × 10-5).
Conclusions: Our meta-analysis demonstrates that the ACE I/D polymorphism is associated with susceptibility to RA,
especially in Arab populations.

The ACE I/D polymorphism has been studied in the con-
text of autoimmune disease. However, published results on
the genetic association for the ACE I/D polymorphism are
controversial and inconclusive.9­22 This may be due to
small sample sizes, low statistical power, and/or clinical
heterogeneity. In order to overcome the limitations of indi-
vidual studies, resolve inconsistencies and reduce the like-
lihood that random errors are responsible for false-positive
or false-negative associations, we employed meta-analysis
to further characterize the association. In the present
study,23­25 we used meta-analysis to investigate whether the
ACE I/D polymorphism contributes to susceptibility to pso-
riasis, vitiligo and RA.
Materials and methods
Identification of eligible studies and data
extraction
A literature search was conducted for studies that examined
the association between the ACE I/D polymorphism and
psoriasis, vitiligo and RA. We utilized the MEDLINE and
EMBASE citation indices to identify articles in which the
ACE I/D polymorphism was determined in patients and
controls (up to October 2012). In addition, all references
mentioned in the identified articles were reviewed to iden-
tify studies not indexed by MEDLINE and EMBASE. The
following keywords and subject terms were searched:
`angiotensin-converting enzyme', `ACE', `psoriasis', `viti-
ligo', `rheumatoid arthritis', and `RA'. Studies were
included in the analysis if they: (1) were case control stud-
ies; (2) contained original data; and (3) contained sufficient
data to calculate odds ratios (ORs). No language restriction
was applied. We excluded the following: (1) studies con-
taining overlapping data; (2) studies in which the number
of null and wild genotypes or alleles could not be ascer-
tained; and (3) studies in which family members had been
studied because their analysis was based on linkage consid-
erations. The following information was extracted from
each identified study: author, year of publication, ethnicity
of the study population, demographics, numbers of cases
and controls and the frequencies of the genotypes and
alleles of the ACE I/D polymorphism.
Evaluation of publication bias and study
quality
Funnel plots are used to detect publication bias, but they
require a range of studies of varying sizes and subjective
judgments, and thus, we evaluated publication bias using
Egger's linear regression test.26 The Egger's linear regres-
sion test measures funnel plot asymmetry on a natural loga-
rithmic scale of ORs. The chi-square test was used to
determine whether observed genotype frequencies in con-
trols conformed to Hardy­Weinberg (H-W) expectations.
Evaluation of statistical associations
We performed meta-analyses using: (1) the allelic contrast
(D vs. I); (2) the recessive (DD vs. ID + II); (3) the domi-
nant (DD + ID vs. II); and (4) the homozygote contrast (DD
vs. II) models. Point estimates of risks, ORs and 95% con-
fidence intervals (CIs) were estimated for each study. In
addition, within- and between-study variations and hetero-
geneities were assessed using Cochran's Q-statistic.
Cochran's Q-statistic test assesses the null hypothesis that
all studies evaluated the same effect. The effect of hetero-
geneity was quantified using I2, with a range between 0 and
100%, and represents the proportion of between-study vari-
ability attributable to heterogeneity rather than chance.27 I2
values of 25%, 50% and 75% were nominally assigned as
low, moderate and high estimates. The fixed effects model
assumes that a genetic factor has a similar effect on disease
susceptibility across all studies investigated and that
observed variations among studies are caused by chance
alone.28 The random effects model assumes that different
studies show substantial diversity and assesses both within-
study sampling error and between-study variance.29 When
study groups are homogeneous, the two models are similar.
If the study groups lack homogeneity, the random effects
model usually provides wider CIs than the fixed effects model.
The random effects model is most appropriate in the pres-
ence of significant between-study heterogeneity.29 Statistical
manipulations were undertaken using a Comprehensive
Meta-Analysis computer program (Biosta, Englewood, NJ,
USA). The power of each study was computed as the prob-
ability of detecting an association between the ACE polymor-
phism and vasculitis using a significance level of 0.05 and
assuming an OR of 1.5 (small effect size). Power analysis
was performed using the statistical program G*Power
(http://www.psycho.uni-duesseldorf.de/aap/projects/gpower).
Results
Studies included in the meta-analysis
Twenty studies were identified by electronic and manual
searches and 15 were selected for a full-text review based on
title and abstract details.9­22,30 One study was excluded
because it contained duplicate data.30 One eligible study
contained data on two different RA groups, and these were
treated independently.21 Thus, a total of 15 separate com-
parisons met our inclusion criteria.9­22 These studies com-
prised five each on psoriasis, vitiligo and RA. They
consisted of four European, three East Asian, three Arab,
three Turkish and two South Asian studies. In total the stud-
ies included 2094 cases and 2871 controls. Selected details
of the individual studies are summarized in Table 1. The
statistical power of these 15 studies ranged from 16.4% to
86.1%. One of the studies had a statistical power exceeding
80%.12

Meta-analysis of the association between
the ACE I/D polymorphism and psoriasis,
vitiligo and RA
Meta-analysis was performed on each patient with psoria-
sis, vitiligo or RA. A summary of the meta-analysis find-
ings of the relation between the ACE I/D polymorphism
and the diseases is provided in Table 2. Meta-analysis of the
DD+ID genotype showed significant association with pso-
riasis (OR 0.753, 95% CI 0.601­0.921, p = 0.006), whereas
no such relation was found for the D allele, the DD geno-
type or the DD vs. II genotype (Table 2; Figure 1).
Meta-analysis showed that the DD+ID genotype was
associated with susceptibility to vitiligo (OR 1.277, 95% CI
1.019­1.600, p = 0.034) (Table 2). However, when one
study not in H-W equilibrium was excluded from the meta-
analysis, the association did not remain significant (OR
1.149, 95% CI 0.867­1.521, p = 0.334) (Table 2). Meta-
analysis showed no association between vitiligo and the I/D
polymorphism using the allele contrast, recessive model or
homozygote contrast model (Table 2; Figure 1).
Meta-analysis showed that the D allele was associated
with susceptibility to RA (OR 1.610, 95% CI 1.059­2.450,
p = 0.026) (Table 2). However, when one study not in H-W
equilibrium was excluded from the meta-analysis, the asso-
ciation did not remain significant (OR 1.558, 95% CI
0.925­2.627, p = 0.096) (Table 2). Meta-analysis of the
DD+ID genotype showed an association with RA (OR
2.199, 95% CI 1.379­3.506, p = 0.001) (Table 2). In addi-
tion, excluding the study that deviated from the H-W equi-
librium among controls did not affect the result (OR 2.169,
95% CI 1.174­4.007, p = 0.003) (Table 2; Figure 1).
However, meta-analysis showed no association between
the RA and I/D polymorphism using the dominant model or
homozygote contrast model (Table 2).
Meta-analysis of the association between
the ACE I/D polymorphism and psoriasis,
vitiligo and RA in each ethnic group
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed a non-significant
association between the D allele and psoriasis in Europeans
(OR 0.912, 95% CI 0.644­1.291, p = 0.602) (Table 3).
Ethnicity-specific meta-analysis showed that the D allele
was not associated with susceptibility to vitiligo in South
Asians (OR 1.086, 95% CI 0.642­1.837, p = 0.759) (Table
3). However, subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed a sig-
nificant association between the D allele and RA in Arab
populations (OR 2.697, 95% CI 1.803­4.034, p = 1.3 ×
10-5) (Table 3).
Heterogeneity and publication bias
The distribution of genotypes of the ACE I/D polymor-
phism in control groups was consistent with H-W equilib-
rium in 13 of the 15 studies. Deviation from H-W
equilibrium among controls suggests the possibility of bias
during control selection or genotyping errors. When we
excluded these studies,14,19 the overall results of the DD+ID
genotype in RA were not substantially affected (Table 2).
Between-study heterogeneity was found during meta-
analyses of all diseases, vitiligo and RA, but no evidence of

heterogeneity was found for meta-analyses in psoriasis
(Tables 2 and 3). Publication bias causes a disproportionate
number of positive studies, and poses a problem for meta-
analyses. Egger's regression test showed no evidence of
publication bias in this meta-analysis of the ACE I/D poly-
morphism in any of the diseases studied (Egger's regres-
sion test p-values > 0.1).
Discussion
ACE is expressed in a wide range of tissues including those
of the kidneys, heart, lungs, vascular endothelium, skin,
joints and testes. ACE plays an important role in RAS, and
angiotensin II conversion, directly increases vascular
smooth muscle cell contraction and affects smooth muscle
proliferation, monocyte adhesion, platelet adhesion, and
aggregation. Angiotensin II also acts as a potent pro-
inflammatory modulator.7,31 The ACE I/D polymorphism is
located on an intron of the ACE gene, and is in strong link-
age disequilibrium with genetic factors that influence
serum ACE levels.8 In fact, the ACE I/D polymorphism
accounts for approximately one-half of the variance inACE
plasma levels in humans. Furthermore, the polymorphism
has been studied in several diseases, including Alzheimer's

disease, myocardial infarction, cerebral infarction, hyper-
tension and diabetic nephropathy. These studies also
reported associations between susceptibilities to these dis-
eases and the DD genotype and D allele.9­22
In this meta-analysis, we combined evidence on the
associations between the ACE I/D polymorphism and sus-
ceptibility to psoriasis, vitiligo and RA. Meta-analysis of
the DD+ID genotype showed significant associations with
psoriasis (OR 0.753, 95% CI 0.601­0.921, p = 0.006),
whereas no such relation was found for vitiligo. In addition,
meta-analysis of the DD+ID genotype showed an associa-
tion with RA (OR 2.199, 95% CI 1.379­3.506, p = 0.001).
Subgroup analysis by ethnicity revealed a significant asso-
ciation between the D allele and RA in Arab populations
(OR 2.697, 95% CI 1.803­4.034, p = 1.3 × 10-5).
ACE is expressed by skin components such as vascular
endothelial cells, fibroblasts, and keratinocytes.32,33 It has
been known that administration ofACE inhibitors can induce
or exacerbate psoriasis in clinical practice.34 Tissue ACE can
control the cutaneous inflammatory response by degrading
bradykinin and substance P, which are strong mediators of
inflammation.35 Activation of the kallikrein­kininogen sys-
tem in plasma and tissue has been associated with psoriasis.36
Moreover, in view of the fact that the ACE I/D polymor-
phism accounts for approximately one-half of the variance in
ACE plasma levels, it is likely that the ACE I/D polymor-
phism plays a role in susceptibility to psoriasis.8 This finding
suggests that the ACE II genotype reduces ACE activity in
skin and may augment the activation of the kallikrein­
kininogen system and increase the risk of psoriasis.12
Although the etiology of vitiligo has not been deter-
mined, autoimmune destruction of melanocytes has been
suggested. Genetic studies have established that vitiligo
susceptibility has a genetic component.37,38 In the present
study, we found no association between vitiligo and the
ACE I/D polymorphism. The lack of association between
vitiligo and psoriasis is unclear. The difference may be due
to small sample sizes or differences in the type of skin dis-
ease. These two disorders may follow different pathways at
the cellular and molecular levels. Relatively few studies
reported the association between vitiligo and the ACE
I/D polymorphism and their results were heterogeneous.
Further studies are required on this topic.
ACE, as a key regulator in inflammatory signal trans-
duction pathway, has been considered to be involved in the
pathogenesis of RA.39 ACE levels are increased in RA syn-
ovial fluid suggesting that locally produced ACE may con-
tribute to the joint destruction of RA.40 ACE converts
angiotensin I to angiotensin II, which has a role as a growth
factor and as a proinflammatory modulator. Angiotensin II
modulates the expression of many cytokines, chemokines,
adhesion molecules, endothelin-1, prostaglandins, platelet-
activating factor, nitric oxide and cyclooxygenase-2.39
Our results should be interpreted with caution due to the
limited number of studies included in this meta-analysis,
which restricted further sub-group analyses. The relative
importance of the ACE I/D polymorphism during the
development of autoimmune diseases may be dependent on
ethnicity. However, we were unable to perform ethnicity-
specific meta-analysis due to limited data. Thus, further
studies are required to allow meta-analysis by ethnic group
to clarify the role of the ACE I/D polymorphism in various
ethnic populations.
Our study has several limitations including potential
publication bias, heterogeneity and confounding factors
that may have distorted the meta-analysis. Secondly, there
are varying levels of severity for each disease and the activ-
ity level in each disease was unclear. Further research is

required to examine whether an association exists between
the ACE I/D polymorphism and the activity or clinical fea-
tures of the diseases. This was not possible in the present
study due to limited data.
In conclusion, this meta-analysis of the ACE I/D poly-
morphism based on a total sample of 2094 patients and
2871 controls demonstrates that the ACE I/D polymor-
phism is associated with susceptibility to RA, especially in
Arab populations. Accordingly, our findings support the
notion that the ACE I/D polymorphism plays a role in the
pathogenesis of RA. Larger scale studies in populations
with different ethnicities are required to explore relation-
ships between polymorphisms of the ACE gene and the
pathogenesis of psoriasis and RA.
