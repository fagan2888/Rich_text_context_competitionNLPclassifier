Background: A higher frequency of nonmonogamy, due in part to
lower marriage prevalence, may contribute to elevated human immu-
nodeficiency virus (HIV)/sexually transmitted disease rates among
older blacks.
Methods: To examine race and gender differences in nonmonogamy,
time spent single (i.e., not married or cohabiting), and HIV testing in
older adults, we analyzed US population-based data from the 2005­
2006 National Social Life, Health, and Aging Project for 2825 hetero-
sexual participants ages 57 to 85 years.
Results: Blacks spent greater portions of their adult lives single than
did Hispanics or whites and were far more likely to report recent
nonmonogamous partnerships (23.4% vs. 10.0% and 8.2%). Among
individuals reporting sex in the prior 5 years, nonmonogamous part-
nerships were strongly associated with time spent single during the
period. Control for time spent single and other covariates reduced the
association of black race with nonmonogamous partnerships for men,
but increased it for women. Less than 20% reported ever testing for
HIV; less than 6% had been recommended testing by a provider.
Testing rates, highest in black men and white women, differed little by
history of nonmonogamous partnerships within gender strata.
Conclusions: Singlehood helps to explain higher nonmonogamous
partnership rates in older black men but not in older black women.
Older adults rarely receive or are recommended HIV testing, a key
strategy for reducing heterosexual HIV transmission.
Racial/ethnic differences in human immunodeficiency virus/
sexually transmitted disease (HIV/STD) risk have been
well documented in the general population and persist in older
age groups. Higher rates are observed among blacks and His-
panics than among whites and Asians.1,2 Although overall STD
rates are much lower in older than in younger adults, significant
racial/ethnic disparities are still observed in persons ages 45
and older.3 Further, there is growing concern about the inci-
dence and prevalence of STDs and HIV among older adults and
the implications of such infections for individual and public
health. Overlapping or concurrent sexual relationships are key
risk factors for the spread of STDs and are more common
among blacks than whites.4­6 Further, being single and sexu-
ally active or having a partner who has other sexual partners
have both been associated with high-risk human papillomavirus
prevalence in older women.7 Lower rates of current marriage
between black and white adults less than 45 years of age
help to explain the elevated rates of overlapping partnerships
observed in blacks in this age group.6,8 However, neither the
frequency of overlapping partnerships, nor the role of mar-
ital status in its racial distribution have been examined
among older adults.
Although their rates of ever marriage differ little from
older adults of other groups, older blacks experience higher
divorce and age-specific mortality rates.9 Therefore, a large
racial disparity exists in their prevalence of current mar-
riage.10­12 Nevertheless, an individuals' current status as mar-
ried or not may be inadequate for assessing the association of
marital status with nonmonogamous partnerships in older pop-
ulations because individuals may be currently unmarried be-
cause of recent widowhood or divorce, after having spent most
of their of sexual histories married to a sexual partner.
HIV and other STDs are growing concerns for older
adults. New AIDS diagnoses among people older than 55 years
have increased 50% in the United States since 1999;13­15 and
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 9%
of all incident HIV cases in 2006 occurred among those age 50
years and more.16 Although HIV incidence remains low among
people age 60 years and older, those who do become infected
in later life are more likely than younger people to go undiag-
nosed.17,18 Other STDs are also relatively rare, but less likely to
be diagnosed promptly among older than younger adults, re-
sulting in preventable transmission and morbidity.18­20
Data are needed to better understand the factors that
contribute to potentially risky partnerships in older adults and

to determine which older subpopulations are in greatest need of
HIV/STD detection and treatment services. The recent in-
creases in the prevalence and incidence of HIV/AIDS among
older adults likely results from multiple factors: (1) HIV treat-
ment advances, (2) rising divorce rates21 and changing sexual
norms,22,23 and (3) medical advances that prolong healthy life
spans and successfully treat sexual dysfunction.24,25 Although
many older adults have spent much of their lives not exposed to
STDs because of long-term monogamous relationships, their
risk may change as individuals enter into new, potentially
riskier partnerships following separation, divorce, or wid-
owhood. Racial differences over time in rates of marriage,
divorce, remarriage, and mortality may lead to substantial
differences in time spent single/noncohabiting among older
adults and play a role in racial/ethnic disparities in exposure
to risky partnerships.
The National Social Life, Health and Aging Project
(NSHAP), which was designed to examine social relationships,
sexuality and health in the United States in later life, provides
an opportunity to examine these issues more closely. In this
article, we (1) describe racial and gender differences in marital
and sexual relationship patterns among older adults, (2) exam-
ine correlates of nonmonogamy (i.e., sex with multiple partners
over the same time period or sex with someone who has
multiple partners), including the influence of differences in
marriage patterns on racial/ethnic disparities in its occurrence,
and (3) describe racial and gender differences in and assess the
degree to which persons in these types of risky relationships are
recommended for and obtain HIV testing.
METHODS
Study Population
The 2005­2006 NSHAP enrolled a nationally represen-
tative probability sample of community dwelling persons 57 to
84 years of age.26 Blacks, Hispanics, men, and persons ages 75
to 84 years at the time of screening were oversampled. Of 4017
eligible persons, 3005 (1550 women and 1455 men) were
successfully interviewed, yielding a weighted response rate of
75.5%.26 In-home interviews were conducted in English and
Spanish between July 2005 and March 2006. An additional
questionnaire was left behind for self-completion and returned
through mail by 84% (86%, weighted) of the sample. Further
survey details are provided elsewhere.26 The protocol was
approved by the institutional review boards of the University of
Chicago and the National Opinion Research Center; this sub-
study received exempt status from the Charles Drew University
and UCLA institutional review boards.
This analysis excludes 62 participants who had missing
marriage/cohabitation histories, 19 who reported that either
their most recent sexual partner or all of their lifetime partners
were of the same sex (numbers too small for subgroup analy-
sis), and 20 whose responses to number of marital sexual
partners exceeded their reported number of lifetime sexual
partners and could not be reconciled with other data. In addi-
tion, we excluded the relatively small number of remaining
respondents whose race/ethnicity was other than black, white,
or Hispanic (n  79), resulting in an analytic sample of 2825.
MEASURES
Nonmonogamous Partnerships
Respondents were asked the month and year of their first
and last sex for up to 3 sexual partners in the prior 5 years.
Respondents were classified as having nonmonogamous part-
nerships if they reported (a) sexual partnerships in the prior 5
years with overlapping start or end dates or (b) having a partner
who also had other sexual partners during their relationship
(i.e., partner infidelity). Criteria "a" included individuals who
reported a relationship that ended in the same month that
another started. In some instances, there may have been a short
gap between theses partnerships.
Due to the interview's modular design, not all partic-
ipants were asked the same partner fidelity question. A
random two-third of the sample was asked: "To the best of
your knowledge, how many people other than you has/did
(PARTNER) had/have sex with during the course of your
relationship?" referring to their 2 most-recent sexual partners in
the past 5 years, during the in-person interview. The remaining
one-third was asked "To the best of your knowledge, has this
person had sex with someone other than yourself during the
course of your relationship?" referring only to their current
sexual partner(s), in the leave-behind questionnaire.27 Those
responding yes to either partner infidelity question were clas-
sified as having nonmonogamous partners. Those responding
"no" to the partner infidelity questions or reporting no sexual
partners in the prior 5 years were classified as not having
nonmonogamous partnerships. In a sensitivity analysis, all 182
persons responding "don't know" or refusing to answer the
partner infidelity question were reclassified from missing to
having nonmonogamous partners. In all analyses, missing val-
ues were assigned to those who had a partner in the last 5 years
and received the leave-behind version of the question, but did
not answer the question (n  122) on their partners' monogamy
status.
Sociodemographics and Self-Reported Health
Status
Gender was assessed by the interviewer. Race/ethnicity
was assessed by responses to the questions "Do you consider
yourself primarily white or Caucasian, black or African Amer-
ican, American Indian, Asian, or something else?" and "Do you
consider yourself Hispanic or Latino." For brevity, we label
black/African American and white/Caucasian participants who
said no to the Hispanic question as black and white in the text.
Furthermore, we describe 3 groups as racial groups because no
further information on ethnicity was collected and because the
Hispanic category shares many characteristics with racial clas-
sifications.28 Highest level of education was grouped into 4
categories. Responses to the 5-point self-reported physical
health scale were grouped into excellent/very good, good, and
fair/poor for analysis.
Sexual Attitudes
We also examined a number of attitudinal variables
regarding sex and infidelity, including the importance of sex in
the respondents' life, the influence of religion on his or her
sexual behavior, and the need for love in a sexual relationship.
Higher scores indicated greater importance of these factors.
Three questions ascertained participants' attitudes about extra-
marital sex in 3 circumstances: (1) any sex with a person
besides the spouse, (2) sex with another person when a spouse
has advanced dementia, or (3) sex with another person when a
spouse is experiencing long-term physical illness. Response
options involved a 4-point scale from "always wrong" to
"not at all wrong" with lower levels indicating higher per-
ceived immorality. Except the importance of sex question,

all attitudinal items were assessed on the leave-behind ques-
tionnaire.
Number of Partners
The number of sexual partners for the respondent's
lifetime and the 5 years before enrollment was also assessed.
Details about dates of first and last sex were obtained for the 3
most recent sexual partnerships in the 5-year period. Sex was
defined as "any mutually voluntary activity with another person
that involves sexual contact, whether intercourse or orgasm
occurs."
Partnership Status and Duration
A complete marital and cohabiting history was obtained,
including dates of marriage/cohabitation, separation/divorce,
and widowhood. We defined years spent cohabiting as the total
number of years, between age 18 and the time of study partic-
ipation, during which respondents reported being married or
living in a romantic relationship with a partner. We then esti-
mated the total duration and percentage of adult life and the
prior 5 years spent "single" (i.e., unmarried/no cohabiting). We
further attributed to "premarriage" the years preceding first
marriage, to "divorce" all years following divorce until the next
marriage or the interview date, and to "widowhood" all years
following death of a spouse until the next marriage or interview
date. We summed these time periods in order to estimate, for
the respondents' adult lifetimes and for their prior 5 years, the
total duration and the percentage of single life attributed to each
"single" relationship status.
HIV Testing
Lifetime history of having ever testing for HIV or been
recommended for HIV testing by a medical provider was
assessed in the leave-behind questionnaire.
Statistical Analysis
We first examined the distribution of sociodemographic
characteristics, physical health, and sexual attitudes and behav-
iors within each of the 6 strata of race and gender. We calcu-
lated percentages and 95% confidence intervals (CI) using the
Taylor series linearization method. Then, we estimated age-
adjusted racial and gender distributions of current marital sta-
tus, lifetime number of marriages, and percentage of adult life
and the prior 5 years spent single.
Next, we examined the predictors of nonmonogamous
partnerships among those reporting at least one sexual partner
in the prior 5 years. We were specifically interested in the
influence of the number of the prior 5 years spent single on
having a nonmonogamous partnership and any observed racial
disparities in this risk factor. We constructed separate multiple
logistic regressions by gender. First, we estimated the associ-
ation of race with nonmonogamous partnerships while adjust-
ing for age group. Then, we adjusted for the number of the prior
5 years spent single and select covariates based on the litera-
ture. These included education, importance of sex, and physical
health status.4,6,8,26
We examined HIV testing in separate analyses. Within
strata of race/ethnicity and gender, we estimated the frequency
of having ever received HIV testing or been recommended HIV
testing by a medical provider among those reporting and not
reporting nonmonogamous partnerships.
We used weights to adjust for differential selection prob-
abilities and nonresponse for all analyses. We computed stan-
dard errors with the use of the Taylor series linearization
method,26 taking into account the stratification and clustering of
the sample design. Reported CIs do not include any adjustment
for multiple testing. Analyses were performed using SUDAAN
statistical software, version 10.0.1 (Research Triangle Park,
NC) and SAS 9.2 (Cary, NC).
RESULTS
Sociodemographics, Self-Reported Health
Status, and Sexual Attitudes
As shown in Table 1, black and Hispanic participants
report lower educational attainment than do whites. In compar-
ison with whites, black and Hispanic respondents were much
more likely to report fair or poor health, and women in these 2
groups reported poorer health than men. In contrast to racial
and ethnic differences in socioeconomic and health character-
istics, attitudes regarding sex were similar across groups. Most
individuals agreed that love was necessary for sex and that
religion shaped their sexual behaviors. In addition, most indi-
cated that marital infidelity was "wrong" or "almost always
wrong." Among blacks and whites, women generally reported
more conservative attitudes regarding sex and marital infidelity
than did men. In contrast, attitudes among Hispanic men and
women were more similar to one another and somewhat more
tolerant of extramarital sex.
Number of Partners, Relationship Status
Black men reported a median of 4 lifetime partners
compared to 3 partners among white and Hispanic men. The
median number of lifetime partners was 2 for white and black
women and 1 for Hispanic women. Nearly 1 in 10 (9.5%, 95%
CI: 8.2, 11.0%) older adults reported at least one new sexual
partnership in the 5 years before the survey; however, signifi-
cant racial variations were observed. Black men and women
were much more likely than their Hispanic and white counter-
parts to report having had new or multiple partners in the prior
5 years. Black women were also more likely than white and
Hispanic women to report no sexual partners. More than 23%
of blacks reported nonmonogamous partnerships in the prior 5
years compared to less than 11% of whites and Hispanics
(Table 1).
The majority of older adults had been married at some
point in their lives, including 97.7% of black men and 94.4% of
black women. This compares to greater than 98% of white and
Hispanic men, and greater than 97% of white and Hispanic
women. Blacks, however, were far less likely than Hispanics or
whites to be currently married (Table 2). The most dramatic
differences were observed among women: black women were
67% and 87% as likely to be married as white or Hispanic
women, respectively. By comparison, black men were 82% as
likely to be married as were either white or Hispanic men.
Blacks were also the least likely to report cohabitation with an
unmarried partner. However, Black rates of multiple marriages
are similar to whites. Hence, the higher rates of partnership
dissolution and widowhood in blacks are not compensated for
by higher rates of remarriage or cohabitation.
Black men and women spend respectively 40% and 60%
more of their adult lifetimes single than do whites. Hispanic
men and women spend approximately 20% more of their adult
lifetimes than do whites. The lifetime distribution of single life
also differs for blacks and Hispanics compared with whites.
Blacks spend relatively larger proportions of their "time spent
single" following divorce or widowhood. Hispanics spend rel-
atively lower proportions of their "time spent single" following
Harawa et al.

divorce. Across races, women spend larger proportions of their
single adult life as divorced or widowed women than do men.
Black men spent 1.3 years of the prior 5 years single compared
with less than 0.8 years single for white and Hispanic men.
Black women spent 2.7 years single compared with less than 2
years for white and Hispanic women (Table 2).

years. The number of recent years spent single was positively
associated with nonmonogamous partnerships in both genders
(odds ratios [ORs]  1.68, 95% CI: 1.48, 1.90 and OR  1.26,
95% CI: 1.08, 1.46, respectively). When, in sensitivity analyses,
we treated all those answering "don't know" or "refused" to
questions regarding the respondents' sexual partner's activities
with another partner as "Yeses," the associations of years spent
single with nonmonogamous partnerships changed little (OR for
men  1.68, 95% CI: 1.50, 1.89; OR for women  1.21, 95% CI:
1.08, 1.36). After control for time spent single and the other
covariates, the ORs associated with black race decreased among
men from 2.97 to 2.04 (95% CI: 1.05, 3.95), but increased among
women from 3.14 to 5.63 (95% CI: 3.11, 10.17).
HIV Testing
Across racial groups, fewer than 20% of respondents
had ever been tested for HIV and fewer than 6% had ever
been recommended HIV testing (Table 4). Medical provid-
ers were more likely to have recommended testing to blacks
but not to whites who reported nonmonogamous partner-
ships. Actual HIV test rates showed almost no association
with nonmonogamous partnerships for either group. Having
tested for HIV was most common among black men (26.4%)
and least common among black and Hispanic women (11.5%
and 10.8%). Overall testing rates were somewhat higher
among white men (18.4%) than white women (14.4%).
Sparse data limit gender comparisons among Hispanics.
DISCUSSION
In this study, marital histories and the frequency of
potentially risky relationships differ substantially by race/eth-
nicity in older adults. Both nonmonogamous partnerships and
time spent single are highest among non-Hispanic blacks and

lowest among non-Hispanic whites. The greater frequency of
multiple and new sex partners among blacks than whites or
Hispanics is a further indicator of potentially heightened HIV/
STD risk in this subpopulation. This is particularly true for
black men who report the highest frequencies of both. Although
black men are more likely than other race/gender groups to
report having tested for HIV or been recommended an HIV test,
testing rates are low across all subgroups, including black men
who report nonmonogamous partnerships.
Consistent with research by Adimora et al.,6,8 we hy-
pothesized that the higher rates of nonmonogamy among blacks
would be partially explained by their greater likelihood of not
being in a committed relationship for all or part of the assess-
ment period. However, when we controlled for the number of
years spent single, attenuation was only observed in the ORs
associated with race for males. Conversely, the ORs comparing
sexually active black with sexually active white females in-
creased. Given that the nonmonogamous partnerships reported
by black females were largely attributed to partner infidelity, it
is possible that those black females who spent less time single
and more time married had a greater opportunity to either
experience or discover partner infidelity.
The bivariate associations of attitudes regarding sexual
infidelity with race do not support that attitudinal differences
account for the observed racial differences in partnership pat-
terns. Instead, it is possible that the factors contributing to
nonmarriage and delayed marriage among younger blacks also
contribute to marital instability and infidelity among older
heterosexual black couples. These are thought to include high
rates of male incarceration that disrupt relationships,29,30 im-
balances in the ratios of men to women that may discourage
fidelity among black men,31 un/underemployment of black
men, and a greater tendency for black men than black women
to partner with other race/ethnicities--resulting in an even
smaller pool of available male partners for black women.32 The
greater imbalance in the number of older women to men among
blacks than among whites or Hispanics is caused by racial and
gender disparities in disease and injury that lead to increased
mortality in black men compared to both black women and to
men of other race/ethnicities.11,29 Hence, reductions in the
gender/race disparities in life expectancies may not only reduce
sex-ratio imbalances but also lower racial disparities in risky
relationship patterns in older adults.
This study has several limitations. Although these anal-
yses are based on events occurring over time, the data were
collected cross-sectionally and through self-report. Some par-
ticipants may have been unable to recall accurately all sexual
partnerships in the last 5 years or the dates for first and last sex,
marriage/cohabitation, divorce/separation, and widowhood.
Others may have been unwilling to report having a nonmo-
nogamous partner. To address the latter, we conducted sensi-
tivity analyses, treating as yeses those responding don't know
or refused to the question partner infidelity. The resulting
multivariate estimates differed little from when these responses
were treated as missing. Finally, because sex itself was defined
so broadly, some respondents may have included partners with
whom they had only engaged in activities posing little-to-no
HIV/STD risk. Nevertheless, just 4.6% of NSHAP respondents
who reported sexual activity in the prior 12 months, reported
never engaging in vaginal intercourse during the time period.
Despite these limitations, the NSHAP data provide rare
nationally representative data on sexual risk behaviors in a
growing at-risk population, making the findings an important
addition to the literature on health disparities and HIV/STD
risk in older adults.
Our findings point to an important and potentially grow-
ing concern for the population, more and more of whom will
spend significant periods of their adult lives single. Taboos and
misconceptions about later life sexuality may lead health care
providers to assume that older people are not at risk, and hence
to not consider HIV/STDs in their differential diagnoses or
discuss preventive measures and HIV screening with them.33,34
Older adults are unlikely to have received comprehensive sex-
ual education or risk-reduction training during their formative
years and now may lack the skills to practice safer sex or the
risk perception to seek out HIV testing.35,36 The higher rates of
illicit drug use in recent than in earlier cohorts of older per-
sons37 and the small numbers of prevention programs targeting
older people38,39 may also further contribute to increased HIV/
STD risk among each "new generation" of older people. To-
gether, these factors highlight the need for increased and tai-
lored services. Our finding that older blacks had fairly low HIV
testing rates (although greater than that of whites) is also cause
for concern. Although testing rates may increase with Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention's current guidelines that
health care settings routinely offer opt-out HIV testing to
patients ages 13 to 64 years,40 significant barriers to widespread

implementation of these guidelines exists.41­44 Furthermore,
potentially at-risk adults ages 65 years and older may still be
missed. Given the differential impact of divorce/separation and
partner death among black couples and the greater prevalence
of nonmonogamous partnerships, training and resources for
enhancing the ability of providers to effectively offer HIV
testing to older populations should particularly target those
serving significant numbers of older black patients.
