The authors evaluated the association between ambient ozone levels and cardiac mortality in California's South
Coast Air Basin during the period 1983­2000 and compared inferences from several types of marginal structural
model (MSM) estimators. The authors undertook an ecologic study during the high-ozone seasons among persons
over age 55 years. In contrast to conditional regression analysis and MSMs based on G-computation and simple
inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW), an MSM that protected against violation of the experimental
treatment assignment (ETA) assumption and considered only those areas that could have experienced both high
and low ozone concentrations during 1983­2000 found no consistent evidence that reductions in quarterly 1-hour
maximum ozone concentrations from levels above any of the regulatory standards to levels below those standards
led to decreases in cardiac mortality; however, it did find evidence of decreases related to a decrease in 8-hour
maximum concentrations. The G-computation estimator and simple IPTW estimators were biased because of
serious violation of the ETA assumption. These analyses highlight the importance of nonviolation of the ETA
assumption for valid inference and the failure of conditional regression to provide marginal estimates in the
presence of interactions. Noncausal models also consistently inferred larger associations, which may have been
due to bias violation of the ETA assumption on which these models rely.

Associations between daily variation in ambient ozone con-
centrations and mortality have been reported since the early
1990s (1­8). The current rule for ozone in the National Am-
bient Air Quality Standards (9) and a recent report from the
National Research Council (10) have recognized the associa-
tion between ozone and mortality, based primarily on the re-
sults of 3 meta-analyses (5, 11, 12). Three more recent
analyses (2 time series, 1 cohort) have raised the possibility
thatthesemortalityassociationsmaybeconfounded,atleastin
part, by particulate matter and its constituents (13­15).
Despite this accumulated evidence for associations be-
tween ambient ozone concentrations and mortality, there
is a need for more investigation, especially single studies
of multiple areas (11). Historically, Southern California's
South Coast Air Basin has had, and still has, some of the
highest ozone concentrations in the United States, with
many areas failing to achieve the current maximum 8-hour
standard of 75 ppb (16).
In the present study, we evaluated the association between
high (versus low) ambient ozone concentrations and cardiac
mortality among persons over age 55 years in the South
Coast Air Basin during the period 1983­2000. We applied
an adaptation of marginal structural models that, in previous
studies, has provided estimates of population exposure ef-
fects that account for the fact that not all areas and their
populations have a positive probability of experiencing all
1233 Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:1233­1243
levels of ozone concentrations and has demonstrated that
failure to address violations of the so-called ``experimental
treatment assignment'' (ETA) assumption (or ``positivity''
assumption) can lead to incorrect inference.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study area
The study area is shown in Figure 1. This Southern Cal-
ifornia location contained many areas that consistently ex-
ceeded National Ambient Air Quality Standards for ozone
between 1983 and 2000 but did experience marked reduc-
tions in 1-hour and 8-hour maximum ozone concentrations
during that period.
Ambient pollutant data and exposure methods
The methods used have been described in detail elsewhere
(17). The population's exposure was estimated from ambient
air quality measurements obtained from a network of stations
that began monitoring air quality before 1980 (Figure 1).
Quarterly average concentrations of 1-hour daily maximum
ozone and 24-hour average nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide,
and carbon monoxide were compiled from hourly measure-
ments. Quarterly average concentrations of the 24-hour aver-
age concentrations of particulate matter 10 lm in diameter
(PM10
) were compiled from monthly averages of every-sixth-
day PM10
and daily, every-third-day, and 2-week average
measurements of particulate matter 2.5 lm in diameter
(PM2.5
) (see the Web Appendix, which is posted on the Jour-
nal's Web site (http://aje.oxfordjournals.org/)).
The domain was divided into 200 10-km 3 10-km grids
that covered the populated portion of the South Coast Air
Basin; 195 grids were used. Population, demographic, and
health outcome data were aggregated into the grids (Web
Figure 1). Air quality and meteorologic data were interpo-
lated spatially (inverse distance-squared weighting) from the
monitoring stations to the grid centroids (Web Appendix).
We first focused on 1-hour maximum ozone, because the
1-hour maximum standard was in place throughout most of
the study period; the 8-hour daily maximum standard was
adopted in 1996 (18). We confined our analyses to the
months April­June (quarter 2) and July­September (quarter
3) (17) (Web Table 1).
Mortality and demographic data
Mortality data were obtained for 1983­2000 from public-
use data files for underlying and multiple causes of death

west by 118.9°W longitude and the Pacific Ocean and extends to 116.8°W longitude at its most eastern end. (AQ, air quality).

(19, 20). For the immediate causes of deaths occurring prior
to 1999, we used International Classification of Diseases,
Ninth Revision, codes 410, 411, 427, and 428 (acute myo-
cardial infarction, intermediate coronary syndrome, arrhyth-
mia, and congestive heart failure). For 1999­2000, we used
the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision,
codes (I21, I24, I50, I47, I48, I49, and I110).
Spatial allocation of the mortality data was based on in-
formation in the single-cause-of-death and multiple-cause-of-
death data files. The single-cause-of-death files for
1989­2000 contained the 5-digit zip code of the deceased
person's residence, as well as the ``city name'' for large cities
or the ``balance of the county'' for small cities and rural
locations. Only the city name or ``balance of county'' location
variable was available in the public-use, multiple-cause mor-
tality data. The site-specific single-cause deaths were used to
establish spatial allocations by grid for each year from 1989
to 2000, adjusted for county-wide, nonaccidental death rates
for infants (age <1 year), children and adults (ages 1­59
years), and elderly adults (ages >59 years) (Web Appendix).
For the years 1983­1988, no zip code information was
available; therefore, the 1989­1991 average spatial allocation
factors were applied (Web Appendix).
We obtained socioeconomic and demographic data from
the US Census Bureau's decadal surveys (1980, 1990, and
2000) and selected 57 variables (17) (Web Table 2). Spatial
allocation of demographic data to exposure grids was based
on the smallest geographic unit for which census data were
available. GIS software (ArcGIS9; ESRI, Redlands, Califor-
nia) was used to map the demographic data to grids (Web
Appendix). Population demographic parameters were esti-
mated for intracensus years by linear interpolation of the
gridded data for 1980, 1990, and 2000.
Data analysis
Data structure. The data consisted of 195 geographic
grids with quarterly measurements from 1983­2000 that
included 14,040 observations and 72 quarters for persons
over age 55 years. The proportion of deaths due to cardiac
disease was calculated as the number of such deaths divided
by the total population of each sex over age 55 years (most
heart problems occur after age 55 years) in the correspond-
ing grid and quarter. We carried out sex-specific analyses to
allow for sex differences in underlying susceptibility both to
heart disease and to air pollution health effects.
The data for quarters 2 and 3 consisted of 7,020 observa-
tions each for males and females. We removed 31 outcome
outliers from grids with small numbers of persons; removal
did not affect our inferences.
For a detailed description of the data structure, see Moore
et al. (17). In short, we denote the observed data structure by
O ¼ ( 
W(71); 
A(71); 
Y(72)), where 1) the history of ozone
is denoted by 
Að71Þ ¼ ðAð0Þ; . . . ; Að71ÞÞ, where A(t)
represents the ozone concentration measured at time t;
2) the history of cardiac mortality as a percentage of
the total area-specific population is denoted by 
Y(72) ¼
(Y(1); . . . ; Y(72)), and Y(t) represents the mortality pro-
portion measured at time t; and 3) the history of potential
time-dependent confounders of the effect of ozone on cardiac
mortality is denoted by 
WðKÞ ¼ ðWð0Þ; . . . ; Wð71ÞÞ, where
W(t) is a multivariate vector of potential confounders (demo-
graphic variables, copollutants, and meteorologic variables)
measured at time t (Web Table 2). Since we are considering
the effect of ozone on cardiac mortality during quarters 2 and
3, we have 36 outcomes of interest.
The exposure variable, denoted by A*(t), is defined as an
indicator for whether the continuous ozone concentration
variable A(t) falls above a particular cutpoint (i.e., regula-
tory standard). Thus, for any given grid, A*(t) ¼ 1 indicates
a high ozone concentration and A*(t) ¼ 0 indicates
a low ozone concentration.
Statistical models
The goal of the analysis was to estimate the causal effect
of lowering ozone concentrations from levels above various
ozone standards that have been considered in the regulatory
process to levels below those standards on the proportion of
deaths from cardiac disease--that is, the effect of A*(t) on
Y(t). We were interested in investigating whether this effect
was modified by time. We investigated this effect separately
for each of 3 exposure variables that were defined on the
basis of 3 cutpoints delineating ``high'' ozone concentra-
tions versus ``low'' ozone concentrations: 70 ppb, 75 ppb,
and 80 ppb, based on various standards that were considered
for maximum 1-hour ozone and maximum 8-hour ozone.
Note that even though outcome at time t (Y(t)) and exposure
at time t À 1 (A*(t)) actually are measured during the same
quarter, we assume that A*(t) precedes Y(t), which is required
for any causal interpretation of the effect (17).
The primary analysis was based on 2 approaches:
1) history-restricted marginal structural models (HRMSM)
(21) and 2) history-restricted causal models for realistic in-
dividualized exposure rules (HRCMIER) (22).
We did not assume that each spatial/geographic unit was
sampled from 1 common distribution P but rather that each
unit was sampled from n distinct distributions, Pi
, that might
have been similar, particularly for those units that were
spatially close. Under this assumption, it follows that mutual
independence between the random variables Oi
, conditional
on the exposure regimen, is a reasonable approximation.
(See the supplemental material in Moore et al. (17).)
History-restricted causal models for realistic
individualized exposure rules
The HRMSM approach defines causal effects based on
the concept of counterfactual outcomes. These are the out-
comes that would have been observed if the grids, possibly
contrary to fact, had had a particular exposure history of
interest--for example, a hypothesized (counterfactual) de-
crease of X ppb below the observed quarterly average. An
HRMSM can be used to study the counterfactual proportion
of cardiac mortality in a given quarter t under the hypothet-
ical scenario in which all grids are exposed to a given ozone
level a*(t À 1), where a*(t À 1) can be either ``high'' (i.e.,
above a standard) or ``low'' (i.e., below a standard).
HRMSM is a model for the distribution of the counterfac-
tual outcomes over a restricted period of time, denoted
Ambient Ozone Concentrations and Cardiac Mortality 1235
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:1233­1243
Ya*ðtÀ1Þ
(t), as opposed to a standard marginal structural
model, which is a model for the distribution of the counter-
factual outcomes over the entire time history, Y
a*ðtÀ1Þ
ðtÞ.
Thus, HRMSM are applied in studies in which only
part of the exposure history, rather than the entire history,
is relevant (23).
Causal inference relies on 2 primary identifiability assump-
tions that guarantee that there is enough information con-
tained in the observed data to infer the HRMSM parameter.
The first assumption is the sequential randomization assump-
tion, which corresponds to the assumption of no unmeasured
confounding. To address this untestable assumption, we eval-
uated a very large number of variables that have been con-
sidered to be confounders in many such studies. The second
assumption is the ETA assumption (also called the positivity
assumption), which requires that each grid in the target pop-
ulation has a positive probability, regardless of its covariate
history, of receiving all of the possible static interventions
(i.e., the ozone concentration in each grid has a positive prob-
ability of being above or below the standard) at each point in
time. The estimators of HRMSM parameters can suffer from
severe bias in the presence of theoretical or practical ETA
violations (24). Practical violations of this assumption can
be tested by checking for very low estimated probabilities
of high or low ozone concentrations based on the exposure
mechanism model--that is, the conditional probability of ex-
posure, given measured confounders. To mitigate the ETA
violation that almost certainly occurs with continuous expo-
sure variables, we consider the discrete exposure variable in-
dicating high ozone concentrations versus low concentrations
based on the standards noted previously. Despite discretiza-
tion, violations of the ETA assumption commonly occur.
Ad hoc methods that have been proposed for addressing
violations of the ETA assumption do not address the prob-
lem directly (25). One appropriate approach is to investigate
the population-level effect of realistic interventions that
could be introduced (22). ``Realistic'' individualized expo-
sure rules are set such that static exposures are assigned only
to those grids for which static exposure was possible (or
realistic), given their covariate history--that is, there is no
ETA violation for the dynamic treatment interventions de-
fined by such rules. In regulatory settings, this may be par-
ticularly useful, since interest is in the population-level
effect of intervention on a target population that is likely
to experience the intervention. Inclusion of those subjects
(grids) for whom (which) the intervention is not possible
may lead to biased estimation of the total population impact.
Consider the binary exposure variable, denoted A*(t),
which is equal to 1 if the ozone concentration falls above
a particular cutpoint (e.g., regulatory standard) and 0 if it is
equal to or below that cutpoint. Now consider the rule that
intervenes on A*ðtÞ: If the conditional probability that the
ozone concentration falls above the cutpoint, given covari-
ate(s), (P(A*(t) ¼ 1j 
W(t À 1))), is less than a, then assign
the exposure to 0 (i.e., below the cutpoint); otherwise, assign
it to 1. If the conditional probability that P(A*(t) ¼
0j 
W(t À 1)) is less than a, then assign the exposure to 1;
otherwise, assign it to 0. Such a rule, d(a*(t À 1)(W)), is
a mapping of the covariate(s) W into a realistic treatment
(Appendix, section A).
HRCMIER are models for the marginal distribution of the
counterfactuals Ydða*ðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ that correspond to the realistic
rule. Unlike HRMSM, which allow estimation of causal effects
of static interventions (i.e., those interventions in which the
entire population experiences the same level of exposure),
the parameters of HRCMIER are fully identifiable from the
data, even when the ETA assumption for static treatment in-
terventions is violated. HRCMIER also generalize HRMSM;
that is, if there are no ETAviolations based onthe given a level,
or similarly if a ¼ 0, then the realistic intervention corresponds
with the static intervention (Appendix, section B).
We consider 2 HRCMIER:
E(Ydða*ðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ
) ¼ m1(a*(t À 1); tjb) ¼ b0

a*(t À 1):

Model 1 (equation 1) imposes a constant effect of ozone on
cardiac mortality over the study period; model 2 (equation 2)
allows for the effect of ozone to vary over the study period--
that is, in model 1, the effects of counterfactual contrasts are
constant over time; in model 2, a given counterfactual con-
trast has a different effect at different times. Note that time t is
represented by quarter number, which refers to the quarters
from 1983 to 2000, which we label 0 through 71. The models
werefittedwiththeinverseprobability-of-treatmentweighting
(IPTW) procedure (26) (Appendix, section C). Selection be-
tween these 2 HRCMIER was based on the minimum
cross-validatedempiricalriskbasedonthe IPTW lossfunction
(27). The HRMSM--that is, the models for E(Ya*ðtÀ1Þ)--also
were fitted with the IPTW estimation procedure (Appendix,
section D). Although they are not directly comparable to the
binary exposure effect estimates, results from the traditional
regression approach and the G-computation-based
HRMSM--that is, models for E(YaðtÀ1Þ), treating ozone as
a continuous variable (A(t))--are provided in Web Table 3.
Since the consistency of the IPTW estimate relies on con-
sistent estimation of the parameters of the model for the expo-
sure mechanism, a data-adaptive model selection algorithm,
namely the deletion/substitution/addition algorithm, was ap-
plied (28). This is a data-adaptive model selection procedure
based on cross-validation that searches through a large space
of polynomial models and was applied by Moore et al. (17).
(Data adaptive estimation techniques based on cross-
validation are the most flexible approaches to model selection
and have been demonstrated theoretically to be superior to
other, less aggressive approaches (29).) The variables associ-
ated with both ozone and cardiac mortality (i.e., putative
confounders; Web Table 4) were candidates for the algorithm
for both sexes. We applied the bootstrap procedure (10,000
iterations) to obtain P values for the coefficients in the models.
RESULTS
Selected characteristics of the population for quarters 2 and
3 are presented in Table 1 (see Web Table 5 for the complete
list). Ozone concentrations declined steadily throughout the
1236 Moore et al.
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:1233­1243
study period (Web Figure 2). Median 1-hour and 8-hour daily
maximum ozone levels (which were highly correlated: r ¼
0.99) for quarters 2 and 3 declined across all grids (Web Table
1). Substantial declines were seen for the other pollutants as
well (supplemental material in Moore et al. (17)). Nonethe-
less, for quarters 2 and 3 and the years 1983­2000, 47.5% and
13.2% of the quarterly, average 1-hour maximum ozone con-
centrations exceeded the levels of the California and federal
daily 1-hour standards, respectively. From 1980 to 2000, 1-
hour maximum ozone concentrations showed moderate cor-
relation with PM10
(r ¼ 0.52) and little correlation with the
other pollutants (all r's < 0.16) (17).
Cardiac mortality decreased over time for both males and
females (Web Figure 3). Across the study period, the median
mortality proportions from acute cardiac events were 5.6 per
10,000 population (interquartile range, 1.1/10,000­1.4/
10,000) and 4.8 per 10,000 population (interquartile range,
1.1/10,000­1.3/10,000) for males and females, respectively.
We estimated the exposure mechanism model with a lo-
gistic regression model, selected by means of the deletion/
substitution/addition algorithm and including the following
variables: current quarter's ozone concentrations for both
sexes, previous quarter's 24-hour average carbon monoxide
concentration for females, grid-specific average 24-hour
temperature for quarter, time, grid-specific percentage of
white persons in quarter, grid-specific median household
income in quarter, grid-specific percentage of foreign-born
persons in quarter, grid-specific percentage of persons who
had graduated from high school in quarter, grid-specific
percentage of persons born in a state other than California
in quarter, and grid-specific percentage of Hispanic persons
in quarter. Comparison of the HRMSMs based on the em-
pirical risk showed the model that included time (model 2)
to have the better fit. Therefore, all subsequent results are
based on model 2.
As expected with continuous exposure variables, the plot
of the predicted ozone levels versus the observed levels
showed that the relation was nearly linear, indicating an
ETAviolation (Web Figure 4). To investigate ETAviolations
based on the discrete high-ozone versus low-ozone variable,
we set the cutpoint for discretizing exposure to high levels
of quarterly average maximum 1-hour concentrations--90
ppb and 110 ppb. As Table 2 shows, over 60% of grids with
observed ozone levels above these cutpoints would be very
unlikely to achieve quarterly ozone concentrations below
the respective cutpoints, based on the data. We identified
the specific grids that would have large numbers (over
50% of the observed quarters) of ETA violations for various
exposure rules (Web Figure 4). Almost all grids which had
low probabilities (a 0.1) of quarterly average 1-hour max-
ima above 80 ppb or below 70 ppb were on or near the coast
or inland, respectively.
The HRMSM analysis, which investigates the effect of all
grids' moving from levels above the cutpoint to levels below
the cutpoint, estimates the effect based on extrapolation that
may not be warranted (bias), since it assumes that all grids
can experience such an intervention. We applied the
HRCMIER to estimate the effect of 3 discrete ozone vari-
ables (cutpoints of 70 ppb, 75 ppb, and 80 ppb), based on 1-
hour average maximum quarterly ozone concentrations. The

Ambient Ozone Concentrations and Cardiac Mortality 1237
Am J Epidemiol 2010;171:1233­1243
results were strikingly different from those obtained with
the HRMSM (Table 3, top). The HRCMIER results indi-
cated that there was no consistent evidence that, if contrary
to fact, reductions in ozone concentrations from levels
above any of these cutpoints to levels below these cutpoints
would lead to decreases in cardiac mortality (Table 3, bot-
tom). The only significant term was the ``quarter'' term,
which was negative and was consistent with the observed
decline in cardiac deaths over time. In comparison, the
HRMSM results indicated that there was a significant effect
of reductions in ozone concentrations (interaction variable
and main term) below the cutpoints 75 ppb and 80 ppb for
females and below 80 ppb only for males (data not shown).
There was no significant effect for ozone discretized at the
70-ppb cutpoint for females and no effect for the 70- and 75-
ppb cutpoints for males (data not shown).
Since the current National Ambient Air Quality Standard
for ozone is based on an 8-hour maximum, we carried out
a similar analysis with the 8-hour maximum used as the
quarterly exposure. The 1-hour ozone standard was replaced
by the 8-hour standard in 1996 (30). Therefore, we carried
out an analysis based on data from 1991­2000 to estimate
what effect a change to the 8-hour standard might have had
on estimated ozone-associated cardiac mortality.
On the basis of the 8-hour maximum HRCMIER analysis
from 1991­2000, there was evidence of a declining effect of
quarterly ozone concentrations on cardiac mortality for both
sexes (Table 4). For all years through quarter 2 of 1998, for
all cutpoints and both sexes, the fit of the HRCMIER esti-
mated a smaller mortality reduction than did the estimate
based on the HRMSM fit (for all cutpoints and quarters, see
Web Table 6 and Web Table 7). By the year 1998, the
HRCMIER estimates indicated that none of the interven-
tions to lower quarterly ozone below each cutpoint would
result in reductions in cardiac mortality for either sex. In
contrast, the HRMSM approach continued to show small
reductions for females through 1999 for all cutpoints; for
males, the only estimated reduction was for the 80-ppb cut-
point (Table 5; for complete data, see Web Tables 6 and 7).
Although the results are not directly comparable, since
the HRCMIER results are based on a discrete ozone vari-
able, the results are different from those of the continuous
ozone HRMSM analysis, which showed a significant effect
of ozone on cardiac-related mortality for both the quarterly
average 1-hour and 8-hour maximum concentrations (Web
Table 3). We caution against interpreting the results based
on continuous ozone because of the severe violation of the
ETA assumption.
DISCUSSION
We observed statistically significant, population-level
``causal'' associations between 1- and 8-hour maximum
high ozone concentrations versus low concentrations
(i.e., above standard-based cutpoints vs. below those cut-
points) and cardiac mortality in the South Coast Air Basin
over the years 1983­2000; moreover, these associations
decreased over time. However, the results were model-
and metric-dependent and were sensitive to violations of
the ETA assumption. In contrast to the HRMSM approach,
application of the HRCMIER that covered the period
1983­2000 failed to show any reduction in cardiac mortal-
ity related to decreasing the ozone concentrations from
above the cutpoints to below the cutpoints for either the
1-hour maximum quarterly ozone concentrations or the 8-
hour concentrations. When the HRCMIER was applied to
the quarterly 8-hour maximum from 1991­2000, the period
during which the 8-hour maximum ozone standard was in
effect, a significant decrease in cardiac mortality was ob-
served, but only through 1997. It then declined to 0% for
the remaining 3 years (Web Table 6 and Web Table 8).
These latter estimates were based on the expected reduc-
tions in mortality over all grids on the basis of intervening
only in those grids for which the intervention was possible.
These are more conservative estimates than were obtained
with the HRMSM or were obtained with a conventional
regression model (analysis not shown), both of which as-
sume that all grids could experience ozone concentrations
above and below the standard. In fact, approximately two-
thirds of grids with observed quarterly 1-hour maximum
ozone concentrations greater than 90 ppb or 110 ppb had
very low predicted probabilities of experiencing ozone
concentrations below the cutpoints (Table 2)--that is, they
violated the ETA assumption consequent to meteorologic

and pollutant transport phenomena that produce high
ozone concentrations.
The HRMSM (estimated by IPTW) and HRCMIER esti-
mates were very similar for the years 1991­2000. However,
when all years were included, the HRMSM and HRCMIER
results differed. The ETA violations in the years 1991­2000
can be attributed largely to the fact that, for many grids, the
conditional probability of experiencing ozone concentra-
tions above the cutpoints was very low, since in these later
years the ozone concentrations had declined. In earlier
years, there were also ETA violations due to the fact that
for some grids, the conditional probability of experiencing
ozone concentrations below the cutpoint was low. These
violations in earlier years affected the HRCMIER parameter
estimates, because those grids with low probabilities of
ozone levels falling below the cutpoint had higher cardiac
mortality, whereas those grids with low probabilities of
ozone levels going above the cutpoint did not. Thus, these
2 approaches give similar inferences when there are few
ETA violations, but they differ in the face of the complex
ETA violations observed. However, the cost of nonviolation
of the ETA assumption for both approaches is that we were
not able to analyze ozone as a continuous variable, which
would have been desirable in terms of estimation of popu-
lation exposure-response relations.
Our results are difficult to compare with those of meta-
analyses that form the core of recent evidence that increases
in ozone concentrations, particularly during the summer
months, are associated with increases in mortality (4, 5,
11, 12). All of these studies used short-term lagged effects;

3 of them (4, 11, 12) used time-series data with ``cardiovas-
cular disease'' as the outcome and 1 (5) used ``mortality'' as
the outcome. Support for a longer averaging time, such as
that used in the present study, can be found in the study by
Schwartz and Dockery (31), who found that increases in
daily ischemic heart disease mortality were associated with
increases in PM2.5
, with percentages increasing monotoni-
cally with smoothing windows of 15, 30, 45, and 60 days.
A second difference relates to the choice of model-fitting
approaches for the exposure mechanism model on which the
IPTW estimates are based. We used a very flexible model-
fitting algorithm that explored a large number of demo-
graphic, temporal, meteorologic, and pollution (24-hour
concentrations of nitrogen dioxide, carbon monoxide, and
PM10
) putative confounders over a very large model space,
based on the minimum cross-validated empirical risk (28),
and allowed for models that were highly nonlinear in the
variables and interaction terms.
Another important difference is that we applied a number
of different modeling approaches, time periods, and quar-
terly ozone metrics with the same data structure. Given our
interest in population-level (marginal) inferences, it turns
out that conventional statistical methods proved inadequate.
We considered discrete exposure variables indicating high
ozone concentrations versus low concentrations because
there were clear violations of the assumption that the con-
ditional probability of experiencing all ozone levels was
positive in all 195 spatial units over all 36 quarters of data
included in this analysis. The data in Table 2 and Web
Figure 4 indicated that this assumption was not warranted

and probably has not been warranted in most studies that
have included widely divergent spatial units and relatively
long time periods (5, 11, 12, 32). Violations of this assump-
tion mean that standard approaches rely on extrapolation
outside of the supporting data. HRCMIER addresses this
problem through the use of exposure rules that intervene
only on units that have a ``reasonable'' conditional proba-
bility of actually having ozone concentrations above and
below some level, defining a more ``realistic'' parameter.
In summary, our approach anticipated the National Re-
search Council recommendation to evaluate longer averag-
ing times with respect to ozone-associated mortality (10).
We demonstrated the need for sensitivity analyses that
use different modeling approaches based on flexible
model-fitting practices. We also showed that failure to con-
sider violations of the ETA assumption can lead to biased
estimates and incorrect inference.

APPENDIX
A. Definition of realistic individualized exposure rule
A formalization of the rule d(a*)( 
W(t À 1)) for the binary
exposure variable A*(t) is given by
d(1)( 
W(t À 1)) ¼

1 if g(1j 
W(t À 1)) > a
0 if g(1j 
W(t À 1)) a

d(0)ð 
W(t À 1)) ¼

1 if g(0j 
W(t À 1)) > a
0 if g(0j 
W(t À 1)) a

;
where a is set to a user-defined value; here we set a ¼ 0.1.
For a discussion of the selection of a, see Moore et al. (17).
Realistic rules can also be applied to categorical exposure
variables (see Bembom et al. (33)). Definition of the rule
relies on selection of a. The general idea is to select an a
small enough to approach the original static intervention
but large enough to avoid extremely large weights for
a given grid. On the basis of simulation results, we recom-
mend selecting an a value in the range of 0.05­0.1.
B. Causal models for realistic individualized exposure
rules
History-restricted causal models for realistic individual-
ized exposure rules (HRCMIER) are models for the mar-
ginal distribution of the counterfactuals YdðaðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ which
correspond to each realistic rule considered. The effect of
intervening on units with rule d(a(t À 1))(W) on the coun-
terfactual outcomes YdðaðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ, adjusted for V & W,
EðYdðaðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ
j VÞ, can be modeled with the pooled
HRCMIER over time:
E(YdðaðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ
j V) ¼ m(a; Vjb0
);
b0
is the true realistic causal effect of interest.
Consider the HRCMIER (model 1) and history-restricted
marginal structural models (HRMSM),
E(Ydða*ðtÀ1ÞÞðWÞ) ¼ m1(a*(t À 1)j b) ¼ b0
þ b1
a*(t À 1):
E(Ya*ðtÀ1Þ) ¼ m1(a*(t À 1)j b) ¼ b0# þ b1#a*(t À 1):
The parameter b1# represents the difference in mean pro-
portions E(Y1
) and E(Y0
) under the static interventions,
where E(Y1) is the mean proportion of the proportion of
cardiac-related mortality had all grids been exposed to
ozone concentrations above the cutpoint and E(Y0) is the
mean proportion of the proportion of cardiac-related mor-
talities had all grids been exposed to ozone concentrations
below the cutpoint. In contrast, the parameter b1
represents
the difference in mean proportions of cardiac-related mor-
talities under the dynamic interventions: E(Ydð1ÞðWÞ) and
E(Ydð0ÞðWÞ).
Like HRMSM parameters, the parameters of the
HRCMIER remain interpretable at the population level. Un-
like the case with marginal structural models, however,
HRCMIER parameters remain fully identifiable from the
observed data even when the experimental treatment assign-
ment (ETA) assumption is violated for the static treatment
interventions, if the dynamic interventions are realistic such
as the one proposed above.
HRCMIER generalize HRMSM: If both g(1j 
W(t À 1)) >
a and g(0j 
W(t À 1)) > a for all grids, then the realistic and
static interventions would be equivalent and thus the
HRMSM and HRCMIER parameters would represent the
same effect. In addition, as an increasing number of grids
violate the ETA assumption, b1
converges to zero because
it is increasingly difficult to identify an effect, since so few
grids can experience the intervention.
C. Exposure mechanism for a binary exposure variable
based on a continuous exposure
For inverse probability-of-treatment weighting (IPTW)
estimation, for both HRMSM and HRCMIER parameters,
an estimate of the exposure mechanism is required. For de-
tails on IPTW estimation with HRCMIER, see van der Laan
and Petersen (22).

The conditional probability distribution of exposure at time
t, given covariates (i.e., the exposure mechanism at time t,
assuming that the sequential randomization assumption
holds), is denoted by g(A(t)j 
W(t À 1)). The conditional prob-
ability distribution of A(t) > h given covariates, where h is the
cutpoint (e.g., ozone standard), can be obtained by integration
of g(A(t)j 
W(t À 1)) over values of A(t) ranging from h to N.
Conversely, the conditional probability for A(t) h can be
obtained by integration over all values of A(t) ranging from
ÀN to h. Since the binary treatment variable A*(t) is set to 1
when A(t) > h and 0 when A(t) h, the treatment mechanism
for A*(t) denoted by gn
(A*(t)j 
W(t À 1)) can be obtained
from the following 2 relations:
g(A*(t À 1) ¼ 1j 
W(t À 1)) ¼ P(A(t À 1) > hj

To estimate g(A*(t)j 
W(t À 1)), we first estimated
g(A(t)j 
W(t À 1) ) using the deletion/substitution/addition
model selection algorithm. The above equalities were then
applied to obtain estimates for g(A*(t) ¼ 1j 
W(t À 1)) and
g(A*(t) ¼ 0j 
W(t À 1)).
D. History-restricted marginal structural models
For the continuous ozone exposure variable (A(t)), the
following 2 HRMSM were considered:
E(YaðtÀ1Þ) ¼ m1(a(t À 1)jb) ¼ b0
þ b1
a(t À 1): ð1Þ
E(YaðtÀ1Þ

For the continuous ozone exposure variable (A*(t)), the fol-
lowing 2 HRMSM were considered:
E(Ya*ðtÀ1Þ) ¼ m1(a*(t À 1)j b) ¼ b0

E. Population intervention model
To estimate the proportion of cardiac deaths that could be
attributed to ozone, we used the ``plug-in'' estimator of the
population intervention model of Hubbard and van der Laan
(34), based on the results from the HRCMIER. The latter
estimate is subtracted from the observed, crude mean
(E(Y jt) À E(Ya*ðtÀ1Þ¼0
j t)) and is interpreted as the esti-
mated decrease in population cardiac mortality at time t,
if, contrary to fact, the population had been exposed to
ozone levels below the specific cutpoint.
