POLICY STATEMENT
Health Care for Youth in the Juvenile Justice System
abstract
Youth in the juvenile correctional system are a high-risk population
who, in many cases, have unmet physical, developmental, and mental
health needs. Multiple studies have found that some of these health
issues occur at higher rates than in the general adolescent population.
Although some youth in the juvenile justice system have interfaced with
health care providers in their community on a regular basis, others
have had inconsistent or nonexistent care. The health needs of these
youth are commonly identified when they are admitted to a juvenile
custodial facility. Pediatricians and other health care providers play an
important role in the care of these youth, and continuity between the
community and the correctional facility is crucial. This policy state-
ment provides an overview of the health needs of youth in the juvenile
correctional system, including existing resources and standards for
care, financing of health care within correctional facilities, and
evidence-based interventions. Recommendations are provided for the
provision of health care services to youth in the juvenile correctional
system as well as specific areas for advocacy efforts. Pediatrics 2011;

INTRODUCTION
Youth in the juvenile correctional system are a high-risk population1­3
who, in many cases, have unmet physical, developmental, and mental
health needs. Multiple studies have found that some of these health
issues occur at higher rates than in the general adolescent popula-
tion.3,4­6 Although some youth in the juvenile justice system have inter-
faced with health care providers in their community on a regular basis,
others have had inconsistent or nonexistent care. The health needs of
these youth are commonly identified when they are admitted to a juve-
nile custodial facility. On-site correctional health care providers must
not only try to identify these health issues but also determine if there
has been active medical management in the community. Pediatricians
and other health care providers play an important role in the care of
these youth, and continuity between the community and the correc-
tional facility is crucial.
EPIDEMIOLOGY OF JUVENILE ARRESTS
In 2008, 11 million juveniles younger than 18 years were arrested.7
Two-thirds of those arrested were referred to juvenile court, and 10%
were referred to the adult criminal court system. One-third of all juve-
niles arrested were female. Gender differences exist in patterns of
arrest-related charges such that adolescent girls are more likely to
have runaway and prostitution/vice offenses, whereas boys have a

higher proportion of arrests in all
other categories (eg, violent and prop-
erty crimes). Girls are also more likely
than adolescent boys to fight with fam-
ily members and become involved in
domestic disturbances.8 Racial differ-
ences were seen in juvenile arrest
patterns. Although black youth only
represent 16% of the 10- to 17-year-
old population in the United States,
they represented 52% of the Violent
Crime Index arrests and 33% of the
Property Crime Index arrests (see
Table 1). The greatest racial dispari-
ties were seen with some of the most
serious crimes--murder, robbery,
and assault.9
Reasons for these racial disparities
are complex and involve social context
as well as individual characteristics
and are not well understood. When
comparing minority youth to white
youth, differing opinions exist about
the relative contributions of several
factors including possible differential
involvement in various offenses and in-
equalities in the treatment of minority
youth compared with white youth once
within the juvenile justice system.10
Youth arrests and delinquent behavior
have been related to lower socioeco-
nomic status (SES), family disruption
(marital separation, divorce), living in
households with only 1 biological par-
ent, less residential stability (length of
time living in 1 location), poorer neigh-
borhood collective efficacy (capacity of
residents to achieve social control
over the environment), and educa-
tional failure.11­13 Overall, poverty is
likely to be the underlying factor that
most influences trends in juvenile
crime.13
SES plays a significant role for black
and Hispanic youth, because they are
more likely to live in poverty than their
whitecounterparts.13 Educationalfailure
iscorrelatedwithunemployment/under-
employment. Studies have found that
employment can prevent or reduce de-
linquent behavior. Lower educational
attainment is most likely to affect
black and Hispanic youth, who have
higher dropout rates than their white
counterparts.13 Family structure influ-
ences youth socialization and the capa-
bility to control the youth's behavior.12
Family structure, itself, is not the
cause of a youth's behavior. Rather it is
linked to other factors, as illustrated
by the correlation between single-
parent households and increased
probability of living in poverty.13 Black
youth are most likely to be living in a
single-parent household, and Hispanic
youth are less likely than white youth
to be living with both parents.13
Not all juvenile arrests result in a cus-
todial placement in either a short-term
detention facility (usually 3 months)
awaiting adjudication or a longer-term
postadjudication residential facility.
Custody rates are higher for male ad-
olescents than female adolescents.
Girls are more likely to be held for
technical violations, such as violating
the terms of probation, or status of-
fenses, such as running away, rather
than more serious illegal activities9
(see Table 1). Data on custody rates
are similar to data on arrest rates,
which demonstrate disproportionate
contact of minority youth with law en-
forcement. Although minority youth
represent only 39% of the US juvenile
population, they represented 65% of
the national juvenile custody popula-
tion in 2006.9 These data become par-
ticularly relevant when considering
unmet mental and physical health
needs, because poorer health status is
related to lower SES, and lower SES is
more likely to be found among minor-
ity youth (see "Sociodemographic Fac-
tors and Health Status").
In 2006, the median time in custodial
placement was 65 days, including both
short-term and long-term facilities.
Eighty percent of postadjudicated
youth were in the facility for at least 30
days, and 57% were in the facility for at
least 90 days. Twelve percent were still
in placement at 1 year.9 A significant
number of youth are incarcerated for
a period of time that would permit
health care providers to diagnose, as-
sess, and treat them for identified
health problems.
SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS AND
HEALTH STATUS
The categories of health needs of youth
in the correctional system are similar
to those of their peers in the commu-
nity. They include dermatologic, respi-
ratory, dental, gastrointestinal, genito-
urinary, and metabolic problems as
well as developmental and mental
health issues. Other categories are in-
fluenced, in part, by the youth's en-
gagement in high-risk behaviors such
as violence, substance abuse, and sex-
ual activity, which may be more preva-
lent than those of their peers in the
general population.5,14 Some health is-
sues result from living in impover-
ished and abusive environments (eg,
traumatic brain injury [TBI], lead expo-
sure, positive tuberculosis [TB] test re-
sults, and poor dental care). Others
are acquired health problems (eg, hy-

pertension, diabetes) that are ne-
glected or remain undiagnosed.15 In
some instances, youth have had inade-
quate health care, because they have
been runaways or living in inconsis-
tent living situations that do not allow
for continuity of care.
Underlying the poorer health status of
youth in the juvenile justice system is
SES. Just as lower SES is correlated
with juvenile delinquency, lower SES--
specifically, income inequality--has
been shown to correlate with teen
births, overweight, and mental health
problems.16 Minority youth, including
black and Hispanic youth, who are
overrepresented in the juvenile justice
system in the United States, are more
likely to live in lower-SES environments
and have been found to have overall
poorer health care than their white
counterparts. Studies have shown sig-
nificant disparities between white and
minority youth aged 0 through 17
years in insurance coverage, lack of a
usual source of care, use of the emer-
gency department, and not receiving
adequate mental health care, dental
care, or prescription medications.17
Factors other than SES may also be
important. A recent review of the liter-
ature confirmed racial/ethnic dispa-
rities in adolescent health care. How-
ever, the results also suggested that
some disparities are not totally under-
stood and seem to be independent of
SES.18
EXTENT OF MEDICAL PROBLEMS
Few studies have provided a broad na-
tional perspective on the health needs
of youth in the juvenile correctional
system in the United States. The most
recently published information is from
the Survey of Youth in Residential
Placement (SYRP).3 The findings in this
report are based on interviews with a
nationally representative sample of
7073 youth in custody during the
spring of 2003. The information was
obtained by using audio computer-
assisted self-interview methodology
and included youth at both short-term
detention and longer-term residential
treatment facilities. The survey re-
vealed high rates of mental health and
substance abuse problems as well as
traumatic experiences with docu-
mented rates that exceeded those of
the general adolescent population.
More than two-thirds of youth in this
survey reported a health care need, in-
cluding injury, problems with vision or
hearing, dental needs, or "other
illness."
Although more than 20 years old, an-
other study with a national scope was
conducted in 1991 by the National Com-
mission on Correctional Health Care
(NCCHC).5 The study included 1801
youth from 39 short-term or long-term
correctional facilities in the United
States. These youth had higher rates of
substance abuse, trauma, unpro-
tected sexual activity, history of sexu-
ally transmitted infections (STIs), sui-
cidal ideation, and reported violence
than those in a general high school
population.
In the following sections, the data re-
garding general physical health issues
are reviewed, and mental health and
substance use/abuse diagnoses are
addressed.
GENERAL PHYSICAL HEALTH
ISSUES
In addition to the SYRP and NCCHC
studies, 3 other studies that involved
either a single facility or a region have
provided important information. Two
studies similarly found that approxi-
mately half of youth in these facilities
had an identified medical problem. The
first study, the results of which were
published in 1980, included youth ad-
mitted during an 11-year period to a
secure detention facility in New York15;
the second study, the results of which
were published in 2000, included youth
from 15 detention and longer-term fa-
cilities in the Maryland Juvenile Jus-
tice System.19 The third study involved
youth admitted to a detention center in
Alabama in the mid-1990s and found
that although most youth (76.9%) de-
nied preexisting conditions or com-
plaints at the time of admission, 10.6%
had a medical condition that required
medical follow-up after release.20
There are a few specific health con-
cerns that require particular attention
in this population.
Dental
The preponderance of dental needs
was documented in a 30-year-old study
in a detention center in New York, in
which almost all of the youth (90%) re-
quired dental care.15 A more recent
study of youth in a juvenile detention
center in Dallas County, Texas, con-
ducted between 1999 and 2003,21 found
that among a random sampling of 419
dental screenings of 12- to 17-year-
olds, half of them had untreated de-
cay and fewer than one-fifth had
preventive sealants. High-urgency
dental problems defined as infection,
tooth or jaw fracture, pulpitis, or se-
vere periodontal disease with bleed-
ing were found in 6.2% of the
subjects. Moderate-urgency condi-
tions, including cavitated asymptom-
atic decay or moderate gingivitis
were found in 13.1%. One of the chal-
lenges noted by the authors was the
inability to provide comprehensive
treatment plans except in the case of
long-term detainees.
Injury
Traumatic injuries are commonly iden-
tified in this population.3,5,15,19,20,22 These
injuries are caused by multiple etiolo-
gies that range from accidental to de-
liberate. The Maryland study19 found
that almost one-fifth of the youth expe-
rienced an injury including burns,
head trauma, and musculoskeletal

injury, and that 12% of these youth had
not had previous treatment. As demon-
strated in the NCCHC study, interper-
sonal violence is an important cause of
injury in this population.5 Approxi-
mately 70% of the surveyed youth had
been involved in at least 1 fight during
the previous year, and one-quarter of
them had experienced an injury that
required medical attention. Three-
quarters of youth in the NCCHC study
reported fights that involved a weapon.
There was a relationship between sub-
stance use and physical fights, use of
weapons, and gang membership.
More details are described in the re-
port of a study from a secure residen-
tial facility in North Carolina that exam-
ined the types of traumatic injuries
experienced by 10- to 17-year-old
youth.22 More than half of the youth had
an injury that required medical atten-
tion. One-third of the injuries were re-
lated to sports, 20% related to fights,
13% self-inflicted, 9% related to sui-
cide attempts, 8% vocational, 3% re-
lated to horseplay, and 11% attributed
to "other." The most common trau-
matic injury was musculoskeletal
(one-third). One-quarter of the injuries
were significant enough to necessitate
referral for further evaluation to an
outside facility.
A previous history of TBI is particularly
significant in this population, because
it can affect mental health and behav-
ioral issues. Studies of detained ado-
lescents have found high rates of TBI.
Compared with youth without TBI,
those with a positive history were
more likely to have a psychiatric di-
agnosis, report earlier onset of crim-
inal behavior and substance use,
have more lifetime substance use
problems, have more previous-year
criminal acts, report lifetime suicid-
ality, and demonstrate impulsivity or
fearlessness in the year preceding
incarceration.23,24
Tuberculosis
Residents of correctional facilities
have among the highest rates of TB
infection and are housed in an envi-
ronment with an increased risk of
exposure. For those reasons, it is
recommended that adolescents in cor-
rectional facilities be screened annu-
ally for TB. A positive Mantoux skin test
result is considered to be 10 mm or
greater, which is a lower threshold
than that for an adolescent without ad-
ditional risk factors.25
Reproductive Health
Sexual Activity/Contraception
The 1991 NCCHC study5 remains one of
the best nationally representative
samples evaluating sexual activity and
contraceptive use among incarcer-
ated youth. The study used a survey
method based on the Centers for Dis-
ease Control and Prevention (CDC)'s
Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance Sys-
tem, which allowed for comparison
with a general high school population.
Incarcerated youth reported higher
rates of sexual activity and were more
likely to report 4 or more lifetime sex-
ual partners. Incarcerated youth also
had much lower self-reported use of
contraception or condoms at their
most recent sexual intercourse.
STIs/HIV
Data from the CDC's 2009 Sexually
Transmitted Disease Surveillance Re-
port26 demonstrated that youth in the
juvenile detention system have among
the highest rates of STIs (Table 2). Sim-
ilar data were collected in another
study that represented 12 juvenile cor-
rection facilities in 5 jurisdictions be-
tween 1996 and 1999.27 Because of un-
protected sex with multiple partners,
prostitution, or injection drug use,
youth in correctional facilities are also
at increased risk of HIV and hepatitis C
virus infection. In addition, they are at
risk of hepatitis B virus infection when
the vaccination series is incomplete.
High rates of STIs, alcohol and drug
use, and lack of consistent condom use
also contribute to increased risk of HIV
infection.28­34
Although the risk of STIs/HIV infection
is high in incarcerated youth, many fa-
cilities fail to screen for either STIs or
HIV. A study that used 2004 data from
the Juvenile Residential Facility Cen-
sus35 found that only 18.5% of the facil-
ities offered STI testing for all adoles-
cents on admission and that 8.3% of
the facilities did not even have STI test-
ing available. Some facilities only pro-
vided STI testing services when re-
quested by the youth or deemed
medically necessary, which is espe-
cially problematic, because STIs are
commonly asymptomatic. Even fewer
facilities tested all youth for HIV or
hepatitis C virus infection, and these
tests were much less likely to be
available.35 One of the challenges as-
sociated with HIV testing by tradi-
tional methods is that it involves a
blood draw and use of an outside lab-
oratory. Youth may refuse phlebot-
omy and can be released from a
short-term detention setting before
obtaining the results. Currently
available rapid HIV tests provide the
option of a less invasive oral test and
can provide results within 20 min-
utes while the youth waits. Providing
opt-out HIV testing is recommended
by the CDC as a part of routine health
care, even in correctional facilities.36

Pregnancy/Fatherhood
The SYRP found that 14% of incarcer-
ated youth have children; males (15%)
were more likely to have fathered a
child compared with 9% of females
who reported having a child.37 This
rate is much higher than that of the
general population of 12- to 20-year-
olds, in which 2% of males and 6% of
females have children. In addition, 12%
of incarcerated youth were expecting a
child. Overall, one-fifth of youth were
currently a parent or expecting a
child.37
These recent national data confirm
previous reports in which incarcer-
ated teenagers report higher preg-
nancy rates than those in the general
adolescent population; more than one-
third of the females report ever having
been pregnant.38,39 An analysis of data
from the 2004 Juvenile Facilities Cen-
sus40 revealed that at least 2.1% of
girls are pregnant while in juvenile jus-
tice residential facilities at any partic-
ular point in time. One study found that
one-quarter of males had fathered a
pregnancy, and 40% of those fathers
reported responsibility for more than
1 pregnancy.41 The 2004 Juvenile Facil-
ities Census40 found that only 15% to
17% of facilities test all girls for preg-
nancy on admission. Although a small
proportion (4.5%­6.6%) fail to even
provide pregnancy tests, the remain-
der of the facilities test only when it is
medically necessary or requested by
the adolescent.
For youth who are pregnant while in-
carcerated, there are additional chal-
lenges. As found in the 2004 Juvenile
Facilities Census, almost one-quarter
of the facilities do not offer access to
obstetric services.40 Similarly, another
study that involved 430 short-term and
long-term facilities from 41 states42
found that prenatal services were
lacking in one-third of them, and 60%
reported at least 1 obstetric complica-
tion. Pregnancy among incarcerated
teenagers is complicated by other ex-
isting problems including substance
abuse, posttraumatic stress disorder,
previous sexual abuse, and additional
considerations regarding postdelivery
options.43 In addition to altered activity
schedules and changes in menu op-
tions related to the higher caloric re-
quirements of pregnancy, postpartum
depression and other psychological
problems require particular attention.
Because most juvenile justice facilities
do not have arrangements for infant
residency or visitation, the adolescent
and her family may be expected to
make a plan for foster care placement.
MENTAL HEALTH
Overview
The available literature indicates that
the prevalence of psychiatric and sub-
stance abuse disorders among youth
in correctional facilities exceeds that
of the general adolescent popula-
tion.3,44,45 In a review of the worldwide
literature from the 1960s through the
1990s, Roberts et al46 determined that
the mean prevalence of psychiatric
disorders in the general adolescent
population was 16.5% (range: 6.2%­
41.3%). In comparison, prevalence
rates in the juvenile justice population
range from 50% to 100% when disrup-
tive behavior disorders are included.47
Inclusion of disruptive behavior disor-
ders, such as conduct disorder, in the
psychiatric disorder prevalence esti-
mates is controversial, because most
teenagers would not be incarcerated
unless they came to the attention of
authorities because of significant dis-
ruptive behaviors. To some extent, en-
gaging in disruptive behavior is part of
normal adolescent development. Mul-
tiple studies have found that most ad-
olescents in the general population
participate in behaviors that would be
considered delinquent.48 These behav-
iors, which include imitation of antiso-
cial models/styles and social rein-
forcement, are usually transient. Most
of the adolescent offenders (85%)
known to the criminal justice system
stop offending by the age of 28 years.
Furthermore, severe, persistent anti-
social behavior over time is only found
in approximately 5% of males.48
The wide range in the prevalence of
mental health disorders among
youth in the juvenile justice system is
indicative, in part, of the limitations
of the studies in the literature. These
limitations include the use of non-
standardized measures and differ-
ent diagnostic tools; noncomparable
sociodemographic variables; data that
are not generalizable because they are
specific to an individual facility, state,
or other locale; variation in the timing
of the evaluation from the detention
setting to after adjudication; and
bias when samples only include
youth referred for psychiatric evalu-
ation.45,47,49,50 It is also important to
consider the fact that for some youth,
when mental health resources in the
community are not sufficient, the juve-
nile justice system may be the place-
ment of last resort by default.51
Prevalence of Psychiatric and
Substance Use Disorders
Until the SYRP report, the 1991 NCCHC
study was the only published study
that included a national sampling of
multiple juvenile custodial sites in the
United States. In the NCCHC study, all of
the mental health and substance use
behaviors were self-reported through
a modified version of the CDC's Youth
Risk Behavior Surveillance instrument.
The data from that survey are summa-
rized in Table 3. The more recent SYRP
study3 found that at least half of youth
reported problems with anxiety, an-
ger, and loneliness, and approximately
one-fifth had a previous suicide at-
tempt. In addition, only 56% of the gen-
eral population of 12- through 20-year-
olds report a lifetime use of alcohol,

PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Number 6, December 2011 1223
compared with 74% of youth in cus-
tody, and only 40% of the general pop-
ulation has used any illegal drug com-
pared with 85% of youth in custody.
Details from the SYRP are summarized
in Table 4.
Although the NCCHC and SYRP reports
have provided information on youth
from multiple sites across the United
States, these 2 studies are limited by
only providing information based on
youth self-report rather than from di-
agnostic evaluation tools. Between
2002 and 2006, the results of several
studies that were designed to elimi-
nate some of the previous study-
design problems were published. The
authors of these reports, Teplin et al,50
Wasserman et al,52,53 and Shufelt and
Cocozza,49 used randomly selected
youth; the Diagnostic Interview Sched-
ule for Children (DISC) as a standard-
ized screening and assessment instru-
ment; and included more ethnically/
racially diverse samples. These
studies yielded a smaller prevalence
range of 45.7% to 70.4% for having ei-
ther a psychiatric and/or substance
use disorder (see Tables 5 and 6). The
studies by Teplin et al50 and Shufelt and
Cocozza,49 specifically, were able to
show that the high rates of psychiatric
illness were not just a reflection of dis-
ruptive behavior disorders. Both stud-
ies found similar results: 60.9% (Teplin
et al) and 66.3% (Shufelt and Cocozza)
had either a psychiatric or substance
use disorder when conduct disorder
was not included among the diagno-
ses. When Shufelt and Cocozza re-
moved substance abuse disorders
from the analysis, 45.5% of the youth
still had a mental health diagnosis. In
general, substance abuse is concern-
ing, because youth who start using and
abusing drugs during early adoles-
cence are more likely to have serious
delinquency and longer deviant ca-
reers, antisocial personality disorders
later in life, and more risk behaviors.
Overall substance abuse is associated
with poor academic performance and
more psychiatric disorders.54
Multiple studies worldwide have found
that youth with psychiatric diagnoses
can have more than 1 psychiatric diag-
nosis (comorbidity) or co-occurring
psychiatric and substance abuse dis-
orders.39,49,50,55­61 The study by Shufelt
and Cocozza49 found that 79% of those
with a psychiatric diagnosis had 2 or
more diagnoses. In another study with
youth in the juvenile justice system,
McClelland et al62 found that approxi-
mately half of the youth had multiple
substance use disorders; 80% of those
with an alcohol use disorder also
abused other drugs, and half of those
with a drug disorder also abused alco-
hol. Co-occurring psychiatric and sub-
stance use disorders were found in the
Shufelt and Cocozza study, in which
60.8% of those with a psychiatric diag-
nosis also had a substance use disor-
der. In that study, co-occurring sub-
stance use and psychiatric disorders
were more common when there was a
history of disruptive behaviors or
symptoms suggestive of mood disor-
ders. Because co-occurring major psy-
chiatric and substance use disorders
are common and develop in a close
time frame, more dual-diagnosis treat-
ment programs are needed to simulta-
neously address both issues.
Racial/Ethnic Differences
Racial/ethnic differences in the diag-
nosis of mental health disorders have
been found in multiple studies. The
well-designed study by Teplin et al50
found that incarcerated black youth
have the lowest rate of mental health
diagnoses, non-Hispanic white youth
have the highest rate, and the rate for
Hispanic youth falls between that of
these 2 groups. However, as discussed
in the literature, interpreting rates of
mental health diagnoses and then
evaluating racial/ethnic disparity
within the juvenile justice system may
be problematic. Concern has been
raised that minority youth may be
more likely to have their behavior in-
terpreted as criminal rather than in
need of mental health service.47 In ad-
dition, minority youth may be more re-
luctant to admit to experiences with
mental illness, or they or their families
may have a cultural bias against seek-
ing care.63,64

Gender Differences
Gender differences are also evident.
Females are more likely than males to
have any psychiatric diagnosis and,
specifically, to have higher rates of
mood and anxiety disorders (Table 6).
With respect to substance use disor-
ders, in general, males and females
have similar rates, but the study by
Teplin et al50 found that females are
more likely than males to use sub-
stances other than alcohol and mari-
juana. Although both genders experi-
ence sexual (10%­24%) and physical
(11%­58%) abuse,6 all forms of abuse,
including emotional abuse, are more
common in girls. As such, posttrau-
matic stress disorder is also more
commonly diagnosed in females. Long-
term outcomes for delinquent adoles-
cent females reveal greater persis-
tence of emotional problems and
worse outcomes complicated by rela-
tionship and parenting issues, drug
problems, and suicidality.65
Suicide
Suicide and suicidality have been a
long-standing concern for juveniles in
confinement. The 1991 NCCHC report
and the 2003 SYRP both revealed high
rates of suicidal ideation among incar-
cerated youth. In addition, 2 nationally
representative studies explored sui-
cidality in more detail. One study, the
results of which were published in
2006,66 found that suicide was the lead-
ing cause of death in juvenile justice
facilities in the United States between
2000 and 2002. A second report, pub-
lished in 200967 and entitled "Charac-
teristics of Juvenile Suicide in Confine-
ment," described the results of a
retrospective evaluation of all identifi-
able juvenile deaths in confinement
from 1995 to 1999. For the deaths re-
lated to suicide, the mechanism was
hanging in all but 1 case. There were
several important findings in this re-
port. Sixty percent of the suicides oc-
curred between 3 PM and midnight,
which included a time frame in which
youth were most likely to be around
other people. Suicides were also most
common during waking hours for
those confined to their rooms. In ad-
dition, the potential for suicidality
among these youth should have been
recognized by staff, because 70% had
been assessed by a mental health pro-
fessional--half of them within the pre-
vious 6 days. Two-thirds of them had a
diagnosis of depression, and half were
taking a psychotropic medication. Sev-
enty percent of the youth had a history
of suicidal ideation, and almost half
had had a previous suicide attempt.
Precipitating factors were identified
more than half of the time and in-
cluded fear of transfer or placement,
recent death of a family member, fail-
ure in the program, recent suicide in
the facility, and parental failure or
threats not to visit.
Recent studies6,68 found that facilities
with suicide-prevention training and
suicide risk screening shortly after ad-
mission to the facility had a lower sui-
cide rate. This is an area for improve-
ment, because the 2009 study6,67 found
that only one-fifth of the facilities had
the 7 key components deemed neces-
sary for suicide prevention. These
components include written protocols,
intake screening, suicide-prevention
training, safe housing, observation,
mortality review, and cardiopulmo-
nary resuscitation certification. The
report also discussed the need to fur-
ther evaluate room confinement, in-
cluding the role of isolation in suicidal
behavior.

Psychotropic Medications
National data are lacking on the use of
psychotropic medications for youth in
the juvenile justice system. However,
as summarized by Desai et al,44 2 stud-
ies representing data from 2 states
found that psychotropic medications
were used for approximately half of
the youth in detention facilities and
more than two-thirds of youth in
longer-term facilities. The fact that the
majority of youth are prescribed these
medications emphasizes the need for
psychiatric services to appropriately
diagnose and manage these youth.
Mental health services are needed at
the time of admission to a correctional
facility for youth who are already on
psychotropic medications and to eval-
uate youth who may need to initiate
medications. In addition, subsequent
evaluation is needed to decide
whether ongoing use is needed during
confinement. Attitudes of the parents
and youth need to be considered when
prescribing these medications, and
continuity of care between community
prescribing physicians and the juve-
nile justice facility is crucial.
The American Academy of Child and Ad-
olescent Psychiatry has published a
document that addresses mental
health assessment and treatment for
youth in the correctional system.69 In
this document, the authors recom-
mend that psychotropic medication
should only be used as part of an indi-
vidually developed comprehensive
treatment plan. Medication should
augment other treatment interven-
tions including individual, group, and
family therapy along with behavioral
interventions such as regular exer-
cise, improved sleep hygiene, and
staff/family support. The need for pre-
viously prescribed medications should
be assessed on the basis of current
symptoms and level of functioning.
New medications should be used cau-
tiously after review of potential risks
and benefits, adverse effects, and al-
ternatives with both the youth and the
parent/guardian when the youth is a
minor.
SCREENING AND ASSESSMENT FOR
MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE
ABUSE DISORDERS
Ideally, youth with mental health and
substance abuse problems would be
identified and treated in the commu-
nity rather than being first identified
and addressed within the juvenile jus-
tice system. One recent study found
that improvement in mental health
services could reduce involvement
with the juvenile justice system, partic-
ularly among youth with the most seri-
ous offenses.70 One author71 suggested
that substance use screening before
admission to detention might allow
community diversion of some youth,
optimize treatment choice, and mini-
mize restrictive detention. However,
optimal screening procedures have
not been established, and many com-
munities have limited availability of
psychiatric and substance abuse
services.
To better address the mental health
needs of youth in the juvenile justice
system, a panel of experts72 was con-
vened to create guidelines and a road
map for best practices in the juvenile
justice setting. The recommendations
included a (1) valid and reliable mental
health screening within 24 hours of ad-
mission, (2) a more extensive assess-
ment by a mental health professional
as soon as possible to determine
needs, (3) use of multiple sources of
information (records, family, schools,
etc), (4) rescreening before release
and preparation for transition out
of custody, and (5) regular repeat
screenings while in custody. These rec-
ommendations are consistent with ex-
isting standards from the NCCHC.
One of the commonly used screening
tools for mental health and substance
abuse specifically developed for the ju-
venile justice system is the Massachu-
setts Youth Screening Instrument­
Second Version (MAYSI-2). This 52-item
screening instrument takes 10 min-
utes to complete and is validated as a
self-report response tool that requires
no clinical expertise to administer,
score, or interpret; is low cost and can
be used by a range of ages, different
ethnic groups, and both genders; and
has good psychometric properties.73
This tool can be completed by using
audio computer-assisted technology
for youth who have literacy problems.
The MAYSI-2 is designed as a screening
tool only, and staff trained in mental
health should be available for further
assessment. This tool should never
take the place of well-trained staff who
can recognize symptoms of mental
health disorders and substance use
withdrawal.
There is no standardized approach
used in the juvenile justice system to
screen for substance use/abuse. It is
important to screen for the use or
abuse of alcohol, tobacco, and the
gamut of other drugs, including illicit,
prescription, and nonproprietary sub-
stances. Possible methods include
self-report, which is the least expen-
sive method but requires youth to un-
derstand the questions and have accu-
rate recall and honest disclosure.
Bioassays with urine or hair are most
commonly used by detention facilities
and are easy to collect. However, al-
though these tests provide objective
data, urine is only sensitive for most
drugs used in the previous 2 to 3 days.
Hair analysis has significant problems
including external contamination,
which can lead to false-positive results
and differences in binding for different
drugs and with different types of
hair.54
Specific screening for substance use
was addressed in a recent report from
the Office of Juvenile Justice and Delin-
1226 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
quency Prevention.13 Only 61% of juve-
nile facilities screened all youth for
substance abuse, and 19% reported no
screening. An additional 20% only
screened youth identified by court or
probation officers or facility staff.
Other reasons to assess were if they
had drug- or alcohol-related charges
or by parent/youth request. Approxi-
mately one-third of the youth were
screened on the day of admission, and
another one-third were screened 1 to 7
days after admission. Three-quarters
of the facilities that conducted screen-
ings used staff-administered ques-
tions, and 55% used self-report by
standardized instruments or checklist
inventories. Overall, 73% of the facili-
ties used urine-based drug screening;
however, one-third of all facilities only
tested a subset of admitted youth or
only when use was suspected or a re-
quest was made by the court or proba-
tion officer.
ON-SITE PSYCHIATRIC AND
SUBSTANCE ABUSE SERVICES
The decision to initiate or change med-
ical treatment of psychiatric disorders
in detention is challenging,74 but acute
symptoms may need to be treated with
some urgency. Medications should be
used to manage symptoms and mini-
mize distress but not to manage be-
haviors alone. As discussed in the
practice parameter from the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent Psy-
chiatry, it is ideal to determine the
youth's legal disposition and place-
ment before initiating or changing
medication regimens.69 Unlike in
longer-term, postadjudication facili-
ties, the length of stay in detention is
usually too short for most counseling
interventions to treat major psychiat-
ric disorders. However, trained per-
sonnel can provide observational data,
and short-term counseling interven-
tions can provide support and facili-
tate the use of problem-solving strate-
gies to prevent problem-escalating
interpersonal behaviors. A more exten-
sive evaluation may also be required
before making a disposition to resi-
dential or community-based mental
health treatment. Family involvement
is critical at that stage, because it is
the key determinant of treatment en-
gagement and success. Whenever the
youth is returning to the community,
an essential part of the disposition is
to include identification of a behavioral
health home and care plan.
In 2002,13 53% of the facilities that re-
ported mental health evaluation data
had in-house mental health profes-
sionals who evaluated all admitted
youth. Another one-third evaluated
some youth. Facilities that provided
mental health treatment on-site were
more likely to also have a mental
health professional evaluate all the
youth. Larger facilities were more
likely than smaller ones to screen all
youth for suicide risk and to evaluate
all youth for mental health needs. Pri-
vately operated facilities (62%) were
more likely to evaluate all youth than
were public facilities (41%).
Two-thirds of the facilities that re-
ported substance abuse services pro-
vided them on-site; the majority (97%)
of them provided drug education, and
two-thirds provided individual or
group therapy with a substance abuse
treatment professional. However, it
was also common (60%) for the coun-
seling to be provided by someone not
specifically trained in substance abuse
treatment. Only 2 of 10 facilities had
ongoing specialized treatment for sub-
stance abuse, and 1 in 10 had no sub-
stance abuse treatment services. Most
facilities used in-house services,
whereas only 20% relied on off-site
services.13
HEALTH CARE STANDARDS: THE
NCCHC
Standards for care of youth in a juve-
nile correctional facility have been
published by the NCCHC, which also
serves as an accreditation organiza-
tion.75,76 The latest version of the stan-
dards for youth was published in
2011.76 These standards are used for
facility accreditation but are valuable
to help inform facilities about both the
minimal and ideal health care for in-
carcerated youth. The currently pub-
lished standards do not specifically
distinguish between detention cen-
ters, which typically involve shorter
lengths of stay, and longer-term post-
adjudication residential facilities.
However, at a minimum, the standards
state that all youth should be screened
immediately on arrival at the intake fa-
cility by qualified health care profes-
sionals or health-trained staff to iden-
tify and meet urgent health needs and
to screen for any potentially conta-
gious conditions or dangerous behav-
iors such as suicidal ideation. The
subsequent length of stay would deter-
mine further evaluation.
According to the standards, all youth
must receive a comprehensive health
assessment within 7 days of arrival
with hands on assessment by a physi-
cian, physician assistant, or nurse
practitioner. This assessment includes
a complete medical, dental, and men-
tal health history, review and update
of immunizations, screening for TB,
measurement of vital signs, physical
examination, and genitourinary ex-
amination, including a gynecologic
assessment, as indicated by gender,
age, and risk factors. The need for lab-
oratory and/or diagnostic tests for
communicable diseases, including
STIs, are determined by the responsi-
ble physician.
A mental health screening that pro-
vides a full assessment by qualified
mental health professionals or mental
health staff using a structured inter-
view is to be conducted within 14 days
of admission and includes past his-
tory, suicidal behavior, victimization,
FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Number 6, December 2011 1227
exposure to traumatic events, sub-
stance use, violent behavior, cerebral
trauma or seizures, and psychotropic
medication. In addition, an oral health
screening is to be performed by a den-
tist or health care professional trained
by the dentist within 7 days of admis-
sion, and an oral examination is to be
performed by a dentist within 60 days
of admission.
Facilities are required to provide an
opportunity for the adolescent to re-
quest health care on a daily basis, and
all requests must be triaged within 24
hours. The facility must provide 24-
hour emergency mental health and
dental services. Discharge planning
must include arrangements for
follow-up or referrals to community
providers and a supply of current med-
ications to last until that follow-up can
occur.
A recently published study35 that as-
sessed whether juvenile detention
facilities follow the standards set out
by the NCCHC found significant defi-
cits when comparing reported prac-
tices to published standards. Data
were analyzed from the Juvenile Res-
idential Facilities Census (2000,
2004) and Census of Juveniles in Res-
idential Placement (2003), which are
conducted by the Office of Juvenile
Justice and Delinquency Prevention
of the US Department of Justice.
Most juvenile correctional facilities
are not accredited by the NCCHC, and
in the absence of mandatory accred-
itation, it is not clear whether most
facilities would fail to meet the stan-
dards or just choose not to be ac-
credited. Data from 2004 showed
that overall, fewer than half of the
facilities were compliant with rec-
ommended health screening and as-
sessments. Few detention facilities
met even minimal levels of care, al-
though better care was seen as the
length of stay increased.
CONTINUITY OF CARE
Continuity of care, both on entering the
facility and when transitioning back to
the community, is crucial for youth in
the juvenile corrections system. How-
ever, continuity of care is a challenge.
One study20 found that fewer than half
of families showed interest in care
deemed important by the on-site med-
ical staff, and a large proportion of
families were not successfully con-
tacted. These youth had nonideal med-
ical care before admission; only half of
the youth had care in the previous
year, and only one-third of them were
able to identify a source of regular
medical care. The juvenile justice sys-
tem may be the only place where these
youth have received a recent compre-
hensive medical history or physical
examination.15
As custodial placement comes to an
end, transitions are difficult, particu-
larly for youth who have experienced
disruption and failure and who have
limited internal resiliency and external
support. Transitions of communities,
residences, schools, programs, thera-
pists, friends, and family members as
well as adjustment to a less restrictive
environment can be difficult. Continu-
ity of care starts at the time of admis-
sion to the facility. If the youth already
has a primary care provider, it is cru-
cial for the medical staff to be able to
contact that clinician to verify previous
diagnoses and treatment. For cases in
which the youth does not have a pri-
mary care provider, resources to es-
tablish primary care should be pro-
vided. Providing summaries of medical
care for the primary care provider,
appropriate subspecialist, or mental
health specialist on discharge back to
the community is also extremely im-
portant. In some cases, a chronic med-
ical condition may be first diagnosed
while the youth is in custody. Facilitat-
ing the transition to a provider who
can ensure continuity is key, because it
is not uncommon for youth to return to
the correctional facility with unmet
chronic health needs. For some condi-
tions, such as STIs or TB, public health
facilities may be able to help with
follow-up.75
COMMUNITY-BASED
INTERVENTIONS FOR
INCARCERATED YOUTH
Traditional cognitive behavioral
therapy (CBT) is helpful for both in-
ternalizing and externalizing behav-
iors, including anger management,
depression, and posttraumatic stress
disorder. However, it may not be the
best choice for many delinquent youth.
There are several promising interven-
tions that have been shown to be effec-
tive in treating youth with mental
health issues. In some cases, these in-
terventions have been shown to re-
duce recidivism.77 Programs that
broadly address multiple domains,
including the adolescents' family,
school, peers, and community, are the
most effective. These programs are in-
tensive and highly structured and in-
clude social skill development, behav-
ior management, attitude adjustment,
and cognitive perceptions. Many of
these programs are community-based
interventions conducted in the youth's
home environment and directly en-
gage the family members. Examples in-
clude multisystemic therapy, func-
tional family therapy, and wraparound
therapy. In another program, multidi-
mensional treatment foster care,
youth are placed with families trained
to provide a structured therapeutic
environment as an alternative to in-
carceration. The biological family is
taught the system with the goal of
returning the youth home. Multisys-
temic therapy and functional family
therapy have been found to be partic-
ularly effective for youth with co-
occurring mental health and sub-
stance use disorders. Some of the
challenges with implementing these
1228 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
programs are the high initial up-
front costs and the labor-intensive
nature of the interventions.
When assessing interventions, it is
also important to note that the Girls
Study Group78 found that interventions
for boys may not directly translate to
girls. Protective factors, such as car-
ing adults, school success, school con-
nectedness, and religiosity, may be
less effective for girls who have expe-
rienced physical and sexual assault,
neglect, and neighborhood disadvan-
tage. More research is needed to un-
derstand the interaction between risk
and protective factors in girls to best
design successful intervention pro-
grams. Programs for girls need to ad-
dress victimization, which is com-
monly found in these youth.
As evidenced by the interventions de-
scribed above, the approach in the ju-
venile court system is generally reha-
bilitative rather than punitive. The
Office of Juvenile Justice and Delin-
quency Prevention79 advocates a com-
prehensive strategy that includes sup-
porting the adolescent's family and
engaging core institutions, such as
schools, businesses, and religious
organizations, in helping to develop
mature and responsible youth. This
strategy utilizes the principle that
delinquency prevention is the most ef-
fective approach while recognizing
that there is a need for graduated
sanctions that protect the community.
The best prevention involves targeting
risk factors for delinquency, such as
drugs and firearms in the community,
family conflict, abuse and neglect,
poor commitment to school, and nega-
tive peer influences, while focusing on
protective factors such as a resilient
individual temperament; close rela-
tionships with family, teachers, other
adults, and peers; and promoting
school success and avoidance of drugs
and crime. Reentry plans need to ad-
dress education, mentoring, prosocial
activities, and positive community
involvement.
EDUCATIONAL NEEDS
As summarized in the recently pub-
lished findings of the SYRP, educa-
tional difficulties and low commitment
to academics are risk factors for delin-
quency.3 In this nationally representa-
tive survey, one-fifth of the youth re-
ported that they were not enrolled in
school at the time they entered cus-
tody. This rate is 4 times higher than
that for the general population. In ad-
dition, 61% had been expelled or sus-
pended, compared with 8% of the gen-
eral population. Although only 28% of
youth in the general population are
functioning below grade level, 48% of
those in custody reported being below
the level expected for their age. Simi-
larly, a higher percentage (25%) of
youth in custody reported being held
back in school, compared with 11%
among peers in the general popula-
tion. Although the majority (92%) of
youth reported attending school while
in custody, only half of these youth re-
ported that the school program was of
good quality, and most youth did not
spend as many hours in school as did
the general population.
Learning disabilities are also much
more common among youth in custo-
dy; rates of 30% have been reported by
youth in custody, which is 7 times
higher than that of the general popula-
tion. Despite the requirements of the
federal Individuals With Disabilities Ed-
ucation Act, which states that youth in
custody must be identified and given
special education services, even in
short-term facilities, only 46% report-
edly receive these services. The SYRP
report concluded that there is a need
to obtain more information on how
custodial facilities address educa-
tional needs, including an assessment
of the curricula used, the provision of
special educational services, and
whether individual educational needs
are being met for each youth in
custody.
JUVENILE TRANSFER LAWS/DEATH
PENALTY
In the past decade, an increasing num-
ber of states have enacted laws that
require that juvenile cases be trans-
ferred to adult courts for certain of-
fenses.80 A parallel increase has been
seen in the number of juveniles incar-
cerated in adult facilities for certain
felonies. When convicted in adult court,
these juveniles commonly receive lon-
ger sentences than those sentenced in
juvenile courts. Although these laws
were enacted with the thought that
they would be a deterrent for juvenile
crimes, 6 studies, conducted in 5 dif-
ferent states, with approximately 500
to more than 5000 participants each,
showed the opposite effect. Compared
with youth retained in the juvenile
court system, recidivism rates were
higher for juveniles whose cases were
transferred to adult criminal court.
This was particularly true for violent
offenders for whom transfer may actu-
ally be promoting rather than deter-
ring further criminal involvement.
Juveniles in adult prisons report
learning more about criminal behavior
from adult inmates and having fear of
victimization; these juveniles were
least likely to say they would not reoff-
end. Juveniles incarcerated in adult
prisons compared with juvenile facili-
ties have an eightfold increase in sui-
cide, fivefold increase in being sexually
assaulted, and twofold increase in
likelihood of being attacked with a
weapon by other inmates or beaten
by staff.80 Adult facilities have much
less emphasis on rehabilitation and
family support than do juvenile facil-
ities, and juveniles have expressed
both resentment and a feeling of in-
justice when tried and punished in
the adult system.
FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Number 6, December 2011 1229
At the extreme, issues of whether to
invoke the death penalty for adoles-
cents have been debated in the past. In
2004, the American Academy of Pediat-
rics and the Society for Adolescent
Health and Medicine issued a joint
statement opposing the death penalty
for juvenile offenders.81 In 2005, the Su-
preme Court ruled that it was uncon-
stitutional to impose capital punish-
ment of individuals who committed
crimes as a juvenile.82 Age 18 was de-
termined to be the age for death-
penalty eligibility. This age was based
on currently available scientific re-
search that indicates that juveniles do
not have the cognitive maturity or
sense of responsibility found in adults.
This was echoed in the most recent rul-
ing by the Supreme Court in May 2010,
in which life without the possibility of
parole was not permitted for juveniles
who committed nonhomicide crimes.83
FINANCING
Financing of health care for incarcer-
ated adolescents presents many chal-
lenges.84­86 All incarcerated persons
are entitled to health care under the
US Constitution (see Estelle v Gamble,
429 US 97); however, such a constitu-
tional guarantee does not include ac-
cess to federally funded health bene-
fits programs such as Medicaid or the
Children's Health Insurance Program
(CHIP), and it does not apply to private
health insurance plans. Section 1905
of the federal Social Security Act spe-
cifically prohibits federal money from
being used for medical care of inmates
in a federal institution and has been
applied equally to adolescents.
There is also a federal prohibition on
the use of Medicaid benefits for any
month during which the individual is a
resident of a public institution. Many
states have terminated Medicaid ben-
efits rather than suspend them to
avoid improper use of federal funds.
Because financing for medical care in
juvenile justice facilities then largely
relies on state and local resources, the
extent of medical care provided can be
limited. When Medicaid benefits are
terminated, there is also commonly a
lag in reinstatement when the youth is
released back into the community. This
occurs even when screening for eligi-
bility is offered before release and ap-
plication assistance is provided. Al-
though current law allows states to
suspend rather than terminate bene-
fits for incarcerated youth, many
states do not follow this procedure for
administrative or other reasons.84­86
Other states have passed legislation
specifically to address this issue and
require that Medicaid be suspended
and not terminated for at least 6
months while in detention.87 Ideally,
continuation and utilization of active
benefits while the youth is incarcer-
ated or detained would ensure that
correctional facilities can provide
more comprehensive medical care.
Continuation of active benefits would
also facilitate continuity of care and
may prevent some recidivism, espe-
cially for those with mental illnesses
that require medication.84­86 In order
for Medicaid benefits to remain active
for youth in the juvenile justice system,
federal law must be amended to en-
sure both continuation of benefits and
funding for the federal government
share of Medicaid. Advocacy is needed
at both the federal and state levels to
ensure provision of necessary medical
services for these youth.
RECOMMENDATIONS
The current and predicted ongoing
shortage of child and adolescent psy-
chiatrists, the separation of mental
health and drug and alcohol treatment
services and personnel, the limited ac-
cess to health care dollars for youth in
detention, and the institutional vari-
ability in procedures and human and
monetary resources will continue to
provide a challenge to meet a reason-
able standard of health care for this
population. The following recommen-
dations are provided for caring for
youth in the juvenile correctional
system.
1. Delivery of Medical Care
Youth incarcerated in the juvenile cor-
rections system should receive the
same level and standards of medical
and mental health care as nonincar-
cerated youth accessing care in their
communities.
a. Health care services should be
equivalent to those recommended
by guidelines of the American Acad-
emy of Pediatrics (Bright Futures
[see www.brightfutures.aap.org]).
Although the extent of health ser-
vices provided during the period of
incarceration may be mitigated by
the length of stay in the facility,
shorter-term facilities, at a mini-
mum, should focus on the identifi-
cation and treatment of immediate
medical and psychiatric issues
such as injury; infectious diseases
(TB, scabies, lice); alcohol, tobacco,
and other drug use/addiction, in-
cluding withdrawal; psychiatric
emergencies including suicidal ide-
ation; and identification of chronic
medical or mental health problems
that require continuation of daily
medications.
b. For youth incarcerated for more
than 1 week or in longer-term facil-
ities, recommended pediatric and
adolescent comprehensive preven-
tive services should be provided. In
addition to a comprehensive his-
tory and physical examination,
youth should receive a dental
screening and mental health
screening for psychiatric illness
and substance use/abuse. Assess-
ments should focus on develop-
mental and psychosocial issues.
Immunizations should be provided
as recommended by the American
1230 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
Academy of Pediatrics and the Advi-
sory Committee on Immunization
Practices of the CDC. The Vaccines
for Children (VFC) program is a re-
source from which eligible youth
can access vaccines. Additional
evaluation, including for neuro-
logic, genetic, and developmental
disorders, should be ordered by
medical personnel as clinically indi-
cated. Clinicians caring for incar-
cerated youth should have training
and expertise in pediatrics or ado-
lescent medicine.
c. Evaluation should include screen-
ing for infectious diseases result-
ing from unprotected sexual activ-
ity. In view of the high rate of risk-
taking behaviors, STI screening
should be included for the most
common pathogens (Neisseria gon-
orrhoeae, Chlamydia trachomatis).
The 2010 sexually transmitted dis-
ease (STD) treatment guidelines
from the CDC recommend universal
screening of all female adolescents
for both N gonorrhoeae and C tra-
chomatis at intake to juvenile de-
tention facilities.88 The 2010 STD
guidelines also recommend screen-
ing sexually active young men for C
trachomatis in clinical settings in
which there is a high prevalence,
such as in correctional facilities. Al-
though not specifically recom-
mended in the 2010 STD guidelines,
periodic assessment of the local
prevalence of N gonorrhoeae would
be ideal with initiation of screening
in male adolescents when preva-
lence rates indicate that screening
would be cost-beneficial. Urine-
based nucleic acid amplification
testing provides a convenient, non-
invasive option for screening. De-
pending on community prevalence,
screening for syphilis should be in-
cluded. HIV testing should be of-
fered to all sexually active youth per
current CDC recommendations.36,88
Completion of the hepatitis B immu-
nization series should be con-
firmed. Screening for hepatitis C
with serologic testing should be
considered for high-risk youth, in-
cluding those who have a history of
injection drug use, are HIV-positive,
or have signs or symptoms of liver
disease, per current CDC recom-
mendations.89 Juveniles with signs
or symptoms of hepatitis should
also be tested for serologic mark-
ers for acute infection with hepati-
tis A and hepatitis B. For most youth,
the first Papanicolaou test is not in-
dicated until 21 years of age . If clin-
ically indicated per published
guidelines, a pelvic examination
should be performed for a Papani-
colaou test (see pelvic examination
and male reproductive health
statements).90,91
d. Screening of pubertal girls
should include pregnancy testing.
Because of the high rates of sex-
ual activity, all pubertal girls
should be screened for preg-
nancy. Nonjudgmental counseling
regarding options should be pro-
vided for pregnant youth, and ac-
cessibility to prenatal services
should be provided on-site or in the
community. Prenatal vitamins, in-
cluding iron and folate supplementa-
tion, should be provided to all preg-
nant girls at the time pregnancy is
diagnosed and continued throughout
thecourseofthepregnancy.Forboth
female and male youth who are par-
ents, parenting classes should be in-
cluded in the educational offerings.
e. On-site mental health and sub-
stance abuse professionals should
be available to provide both evalua-
tion and treatment services. Mental
health services can be provided by
staff either hired by the facilities or
through a contractual arrange-
ment with an outside community
provider. Services should include
psychiatric services to facilitate
continuation of medications from
the community mental health pro-
vider and ongoing evaluation and
treatment. Psychiatrists should
have training in child and adoles-
cent psychiatry and preferably be
board certified. Tobacco-, alcohol-,
and drug-cessation programs
should be available during the pe-
riod of incarceration. Attention
should be paid on an ongoing basis
to the medical and mental health
status of youth, because new issues
can arise during their time in con-
finement. Correctional staff should
receive training in suicide preven-
tion, and specific attention should
be paid to youth confined to their
rooms in the housing unit. The prac-
tice parameter from the American
Academy of Child and Adolescent
Psychiatry provides specific recom-
mendations on therovision of men-
tal health services within the juve-
nile correctional system.69
f. Regular physical activity and nu-
tritionally balanced meal plans ap-
propriate for adolescents should be
provided in all facilities. Given the
current national epidemic of obe-
sity, attention to these aspects of a
healthy lifestyle is even more
critical.
g. Pediatricians should encourage
all correctional care facilities
to adopt and comply with the
NCCHC's "Standards for Health
Services in Juvenile Detention
and Confinement Facilities."76 Ac-
creditation is encouraged as a
means to reach desired levels of
health care. Information regard-
ing accreditation can be found at
www.ncchc.org.
2. Developmentally Appropriate
Confinement Facilities
Children and adolescents should be
housed in facilities that are able to ad-
FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
PEDIATRICS Volume 128, Number 6, December 2011 1231
dress their specific developmental
needs.
a. Pediatricians, adolescent health
care specialists, mental health pro-
fessionals, and drug and alcohol
treatment providers should be con-
sulted about health care policies
and procedures governing all cor-
rectional care facilities in which
children and adolescents are
incarcerated.
b. Children and adolescents should be
detained or incarcerated only in fa-
cilities with developmentally appro-
priate programs and staff trained
to deal with their unique social, ed-
ucational, recreational, and super-
visory needs.
c. If children and adolescents must be
housed in adult facilities, they
should have routine access to the
same developmentally appropriate
environment and be separated by
sight and sound from the adult
population.
3. Integration of Available Systems
of Care
a. Coordination between juvenile jus-
tice system health care providers
and community providers is essen-
tial. Health care information elic-
ited in the juvenile corrections set-
ting should, at a minimum, be
shared with the adolescent and, as
appropriate (when not violating
confidentiality), with the parent/le-
gal guardian to allow for continuity
of care and prevent unnecessary
duplication of services. Pediatri-
cians are a crucial link in the pro-
cess of ensuring continuity of care
between the community and the ju-
venile correctional system. Infor-
mation should also be shared be-
tween the relevant community
providers and correctional health
care staff both on admission and at
the time of release to ensure conti-
nuity of care. If the youth does not
have a medical home, correctional
staff should make every effort to
identify a medical home within the
community for that youth. Pediatri-
cians should also coordinate with
probation officers who are fre-
quently entrusted with ensuring ap-
propriate follow-up once the youth
reenters the community.
b. Electronic medical records avail-
able within the community should
also be accessible by correctional
health care staff. Existing publicly
accessed databases, such as state
immunization data banks, should
be used to document care provided
in correctional facilities. With the
evolving use of electronic medical
records, consideration should be
given to the need to share informa-
tion between correctional institu-
tions and community providers to
ensure continuity of care.
c. All youth incarcerated in the juve-
nile corrections systems should
maintain eligibility for their existing
health insurance benefits. Unin-
sured youth should be able to be
enrolled in Medicaid while incar-
cerated. Both Medicaid and private
insurance should be available for
all youth without suspension or ter-
mination during incarceration and
without a lag for reinstatement on
reentry into the community. Youth
without insurance coverage before
incarceration should be automati-
cally made eligible for Medicaid at
the time of incarceration so that ac-
cess to appropriate care may be fa-
cilitated. Advocacy is needed at
both the federal and state levels to
amend existing regulations and en-
sure the provision of necessary
medical services for these youth.
4. Treatment and Intervention
a. Evidence-based mental health and
substance abuse treatment inter-
ventions that have been shown to
reduce recidivism should be ad-
opted to improve long-term out-
comes for incarcerated youth.
Pediatricians should advocate for
adequate funding for implementa-
tion of programs such as multisys-
temic therapy and functional family
therapy with the recognition that an
increased investment in the short-
term will lead to cost savings in
terms of improved long-term
outcomes.
b. Resources should be invested in in-
terventions that address the risk
and protective factors involved
with juvenile delinquency. There
should be emphasis on investing in
interventions that address the re-
lated family and community factors
associated with delinquency. Spe-
cific emphasis should be placed on
factors that will improve SES such
as educational achievement and
employment, because these factors
are highly correlated with both ju-
venile delinquency and overall
health status.
c. More nationally representative
data are needed on the health
needs of youth in the juvenile justice
system. Funding is needed to collect
nationally representative data on
youth involved in the correctional
system to better inform program-
ming needs and desired outcomes
and help guide the choice of appro-
priate cost-effective interventions.
5. Advocacy
Pediatricians should work with their
AAP chapters, the juvenile justice sec-
tions of their state judiciary and bar
associations, and state and local gov-
ernmental officials.
a. Pediatricians should advocate to
ensure that the appropriate legisla-
tion and funding is available to pro-
vide for medical, educational, and
behavioral health needs of juve-
1232 FROM THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF PEDIATRICS
niles while confined and on reentry
into the community.
b. Pediatricians should advocate for
adequate health insurance for all
medical and behavioral health ser-
vices for youth both during and af-
ter incarceration to ensure that re-
sources are available to provide
adequate and continuous care.
c. Pediatricians should support both
efforts to decrease the number of
youth incarcerated by advocating
for interventional programs in the
community that address risk and
protective factors and legislation
that requires education of law en-
forcement officers about at-risk
youth and teaches skills to manage
interactions with these youth.
