Covering Older Americans:
Forecast For The Next Decade
If current trends continue, private insurance coverage among the elderly will
drop by 4.5 percent by 2005.
by Sherry Glied and Mark Stabile
Several recent policy initiatives
have focused attention on the popula-
tion nearing Medicare eligibility age.
Congress has considered raising the Medicare
eligibility age from sixty-five years to sixty-
seven years, in tandem with the already
scheduled increase in the Social Security eligi-
bility age. President Bill Clinton has proposed
allowing Americans ages fifty-five to sixty-
four to buy into Medicare. The impact of such
policies and the need for, and role of, public
coverage will depend on the extent to which
private coverage is held by the affected popu-
lation: those nearing Medicare's eligibility
age, whatever it ends up being.
Prior research has documented current pat-
terns ofhealth insurance coverage in the popu-
lation that is near Medicare eligibility.1 Private
coverage in this population depends critically
on three factors: the propensity of older adults
to work full time, the likelihood that older
workers will hold health insurance coverage,
and the extent of private health insurance
among retirees under age sixty-five. We used
information about recent trends in these com-
ponents to project coverage patterns for future
cohorts of older persons and to assess the sen-
sitivity of future private health insurance cov-
erage to changes in these trends.
n DATA SOURCES. The analysis con-
ducted here used three years of data from the
March Current Population Surveys (CPS)--
1989, 1993, and 1997--to follow the labor-
force and health insurance experience of co-
horts of older Americans. The CPS is a na-
tional survey of approximately 50,000 house-
holds that includes demographic and
labor-force information, as well as informa-
tion on source and nature of health insurance
coverage. The CPS has used a consistent set of
health insurance questions since 1989; these
questions refer to health insurance coverage
during the year preceding the survey. Eco-
nomic conditions in 1992 were worse than in
either 1988 or 1996, but the two latter years
were quite similar.
CURRENT PATTERNS OF HEALTH
INSURANCE COVERAGE
Just over half of older Americans who have
health insurance obtain it through a current
or former employer or spouse's current or for-
mer employer (Exhibit 1). More than one-fifth
of persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four obtain
coverage through Medicare, Medicaid, or the
Civilian Health and Medical Program of the
Uniformed Services (CHAMPUS). Finally,
nearly 10 percent of older persons hold private
insurance that is not obtained through a cur-
rent or former employer. More than 16 percent
of persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four were
uninsured in the 1997 survey.
To get a better sense of the determinants of
health insurance coverage among older
Americans, we compared their coverage to

that of the cohort ages forty-five to sixty (Ex-
hibit 1). The overall rate of coverage among
persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four is nearly
as high as that among the younger group, but
the pattern of coverage is quite different. Per-
sons ages sixty-one to sixty-four are less
likely to hold private coverage and much less
likely to hold employer-sponsored coverage
than are their younger counterparts (although
they are more likely to hold public coverage or
individually purchased private coverage).
This difference is a consequence of the much
lower rates of employment, especially of full-
time employment, in the cohort of persons
ages sixty-one to sixty-four, relative to the
younger group. Among persons working full
time, those ages sixty-one to sixty-four are
about as likely to have health insurance as are
those ages forty-five to sixty.
The importance of labor-market behavior
is equally apparent in comparisons within the
cohort of persons ages sixty-one to sixty-four.
Among the most-educated men andwomen in
this age group--those with a college de-
gree--rates of private health insurance cover-
age are nearly twice as high as among the
least-educated group. The difference is princi-
pally a consequence of much lower rates of
employer-sponsored coverage in the latter
group. Again, this difference is mainly a result
of differences in labor-force participation. The
least-educated persons are far less likely to be
working full time in their early sixties than
are their more-educated counterparts. The ef-
fect of this difference is further exacerbated
by differences in the likelihood that more- and
less-educated full-time workers obtain
employer-sponsored coverage.

adults in the future is likely to depend on their
employment patterns and on the inclination
of full-time workers and nonworkers to ob-
tain health insurance coverage. To see how
patterns of coverage are likely to change, we
examined patterns of employment and health
insurance coverage over time.
Between 1989 and 1997 the percentage of
persons working full time increased for all age
categories (Exhibit 2). Nonetheless, in each
year the percentage of the population work-
ing full time is significantly lower among
older persons. Not surprisingly, as cohorts
age, the percentage of persons working full
time declines sharply. Although 60 percent of
those born between 1933 and 1936 were work-
ing full time when they were ages fifty-three
to fifty-six, only 31 percent of that cohort
worked full time when they reached their
early sixties. Similarly, 71 percent of persons
born between 1941 and 1944 were working
full time in 1989 when they were ages forty-
five to forty-eight, but only 64 percent of this
cohort worked full time by 1997 when they
were ages fifty-three to fifty-six. This pattern
of declining labor-force participation within a
cohort is one element in predicting patterns of
employer-sponsored insurance for today's
late-middle-age workers. Since more of them
are working today, more are likely to be work-
ing eight years from now.
As noted above, at any point in time, older
full-time workers are nearly as likely as their
younger counterparts are to obtain health in-
surance coverage (Exhibit 2). Nonetheless,
cohorts of older workers have been affected
by the economywide decline in private health
insurance coverage. Over the eight-year pe-
riod examined here, the percentage of full-
time workers in each age group who hold
health insurance coverage has fallen by about
two percentage points. As cohorts of full-time
workers have aged, their rates of health insur-
ance coverage have fallen. Although 86 per-
cent of full-time workers in the cohort born in
1933­1936 held private health insurance cov-
erage when they were ages fifty-three to fifty-
six, only 83.3 percent of full-time workers in
that cohort held private coverage eight years
later.2
Only about one-third of persons ages
sixty-one to sixty-four work full time, so
changes in patterns of insurance coverage
among nonworkers are likely to be particu-
larly pronounced among older Americans. Pri-
vate insurance coverage (both employer-
sponsored and privately purchased) fell
between 1989 and 1997 among nonworkers in
all older age groups (Exhibit 3). In 1989, 58
percent of nonworkers ages sixty-one to
sixty-four held such coverage. In 1997 only 50
percent of such persons did. A lower propor-
tion of older nonworkers in each cohort held
private insurance coverage in 1997 than had
either four or eight years earlier.
In combination, these patterns generate

trends in private health insurance coverage
for the older population (Exhibit 3). For each
age group between ages forty-five and sixty-
four, private coverage rates (a combination of
employer-sponsored and privately purchased
coverage) fell 3­5 percent between 1989 and
1997. These declines translate into declines in
coverage within cohorts of older Americans.
Private health insurance coverage rates for the
cohort born in 1933­1936 fell thirteen percent-
age points as they aged from their mid-fifties
(in 1989) to their early sixties (in 1997). Pri-
vate coverage rates for the cohort born in
1941­1944 fell six percentage points as they
aged from their early forties (in 1989) to their
mid-fifties (in 1997). Note that these drops in
coverage did not translate one-for-one into
declines in insurance coverage. Growth in
public coverage offset more than half of the
drop in private coverage.3
These declines have been even more acute
among the least-educated members of this
population--those who did not complete
high school. Although 58 percent of the least-
educated members of the cohort born in
1933­1936 held private health insurance when
they were in their mid-fifties, only 41 percent
of this cohort did so eight years later.
PROJECTING COVERAGE INTO THE
FUTURE
The forecasts described below are based on
two premises. First, the private health insur-
ance coverage of persons ages sixty-one to
sixty-four (and ages sixty-five to sixty-seven
in the absence of Medicare) is closely linked
to the coverage patterns that these people ex-
perienced when they were in their prime
working years. Those who held jobs without
health insurance coverage when they were in
their mid-fifties probably will not obtain jobs
with coverage ten years later. Retirees who
lack private coverage in their early retirement
years are unlikely to gain it later, either.
Second, the change in private coverage
among those now in their mid-fifties as they
reach their early sixties depends on the rela-
tionship between aging and health insurance
coverage, a relationship that we assume re-
mains relatively constant across cohorts.
Based on these premises, we generate fore-
casts of future health insurance coverage by
superimposing information about the link be-
tween aging and health insurance coverage
obtained from past cohorts on the current
coverage patterns of persons ages fifty-three
to fifty-six.
Exhibit 4 presents baseline information
about today's sixty-one to sixty-four-year-
olds. Scenario One forecasts coverage pat-
terns for today's fifty-three to fifty-six-year-
olds in 2005, assuming that changes in
labor-market and health insurance behavior
follow past trends. Slightly more persons in
the older cohort are expected to be working
full time in 2005, because more persons ages
fifty-three to fifty-six are working full time
today than had done so eight years ago. The

likelihood that full-time workers will hold
health insurance is expected to be somewhat
lower than today, because rates of private cov-
erage among full-time working persons ages
fifty-three to fifty-six have fallen over the past
eight years. Similarly, the sharp drop in cover-
age among nonworkers ages fifty-three to
fifty-six over the past eight years is expected
to translate into a lower rate of coverage
among nonworkers ages sixty-one to sixty-
four in 2005. This baseline projection yields a
rate of private health insurance coverage that
is 4.5 percentage points lower than today's
rate. Since the size of the population ages
sixty-one to sixty-four is also expected to in-
crease by 26 percent, this lower rate of cover-
age translates into an increase of 1.25 million
in the number of persons ages sixty-one to
sixty-four who lack private coverage.
How will this forecast be affected by
changes in the labor-force or health insurance
experience of older workers? Changes in So-
cial Security rules or retirement policies, for
example, could encourage more older workers
to remain in the labor force full time. Scenario
Two maintains all of the health insurance pro-
pensity projections as in Scenario One and
measures how high full-time employment
rates would have to be to restore the private
health insurance coverage rate to its 1997
level. Full-time employment would have to in-
crease by nearly 50 percent over today's rate
to hold coverage constant--an implausibly
high figure. Even under this extremely opti-
mistic scenario, under which the rate of cover-
age actually increases, growth in the size of
the older population would lead to an increase
of nearly 800,000 in the number of people
lacking private coverage.
A slowdown in the rate of growth of health
insurance costs might stem the declines in
private coverage among older full-time work-
ers. Scenario Three examines the effect on ex-
pected private coverage levels of holding
health insurance coverage among full-time
workers at today's rates. This change would
have a small effect on coverage, reducing the
number of people lacking private coverage by
just under 100,000.
One component of President Clinton's pro-
posal for coverage expansion is to increase
coverage among nonworkers. The effect of
such a change is illustrated in Scenario Four.
If retiree coverage rates remained at today's

levels (nearly 50 percent), there would be no
decline in private coverage rates among the
population ages sixty-one to sixty-four be-
tween now and 2005. Again, this assumption
is extremely optimistic. Prior cohorts experi-
enced declines in the percentage of nonwork-
ers holding private insurance over time. This
scenario would require a five-percentage-
point increase in this percentage as the cohort
aged. Furthermore, an increase in the avail-
ability of public coverage for nonworkers
might lead more people to leave the labor mar-
ket and change the balance of public and pri-
vate coverage.
POLICY IMPLICATIONS
Under most plausible scenarios both the
number and the percentage of older Ameri-
cans who lack private insurance coverage are
likely to rise over the next decade. Rates of
private coverage among persons ages fifty-
three to fifty-six are lower today than they
were among this age cohort eight years ago,
and these lower rates are likely to continue
into the future. This problem is likely to be-
come even more severe over time because
rates of employer-sponsored health insurance
coverage among baby boomers have been de-
clining steadily over the past fifteen years.4
These results suggest that raising the age
of eligibility for Medicare in tandem with the
Social Security eligibility age is likely to leave
a large number of older Americans without
private coverage. Although raising the age of
eligibility for pension benefits will encourage
more older Americans to work, our projec-
tions suggest that implausibly large increases
in employment would be needed to offset the
expected declines in coverage.
Conversely, expanding Medicare by per-
mitting older Americans to buy in is unlikely
to make a significant dent in the number of
near-elderly uninsured persons. The decline
in private insurance coverage is especially se-
vere among the least-educated members of
older cohorts.5 This group is unlikely to be
able to afford to pay actuarially fair premiums
for Medicare coverage. Furthermore, increas-
ing Medicare eligibility might even crowd out
some existing private coverage.
New policy initiatives are needed to ensure
that older Americans, especially those who are
not working, can maintain health insurance
coverage until they become eligible for Medi-
care. These could include new public coverage
alternatives or policies that would encourage
the purchase of long-term, non-employer-
sponsored private retiree coverage.

2. Patterns of coverage among full-time workers
(or nonworkers) in a cohort may be affected by
changes in the composition of the full-time
working (or nonworking) portion of the cohort.
As Exhibit 3 suggests, less-educated workers,
who have a lower propensity to hold private cov-
erage, tend to retire earlier than better-educated
workers do. This pattern means that the actual
decline in private coverage among those continu-
ally employed full time is likely to be greater than
that described.
3. Recent research suggests that increases in the
availability of public coverage can crowd out pri-
vate coverage. D. Cutler et al., "Does Public In-
surance Crowd Out Private Insurance?" Quarterly
Journalof Economics (May 1995): 391­430. Some of
the decline in private coverage may be a conse-
quence of expanded public coverage, but we can-
not say how much using these data.

Insurance Coverage: 1981­1996," NBER Working
Paper no. 6276 (Cambridge, Mass.: National Bu-
reau of Economic Research, 1997).
5. If the relationship between education and pri-
vate health insurance coverage remains un-
changed, the decrease in the number of poorly
educated Americans might mitigate some of the
losses in coverage. We also predict coverage
rates into the future, accounting for the changing
educational makeup of the population. Predicted
insurance rates are within 0.4 percentage points
of our reported predictions.
