Introduction
Studies on internationalization of higher education (HE)
have been vast, as the subject is of prime interest to policy
makers, educationists, and leaders. This is because economic
performance is affected by the growing cross-border flows of
knowledge, knowledge workers, and students (American
Council on Education [ACE], 2009; Organisation for
Economic Co-Operation and Development [OECD], 2004;
NAFSA, 2010, cited in Hawawini, 2011; United Nations
Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization
[UNESCO], 2009). Studies based specifically on the interna-
tionalization in the HE sector have been performed in numer-
ous regions of the world: Alamri (2011) in Saudi Arabia, Liu
and Dai (2012) and Chen and Huang (2013) in China, Jowi
(2009) in Africa, Ogachi (2009) in East Africa, Ghasempoor,
Liaghatdar, and Jafari (2011) in Iran, Mahani and Molki
(2011) in UAE, and Mitra (2010) in India, which shows the
importance given by researchers and reflects the respective
nation's keenness to internationalize. Most of the studies on
internationalization dwell on the effect that the international-
ization process may have on the institutions, the models used
by higher education institutions (HEIs) and the impact they
have, and the governance mechanism of the HEIs. A review
of literature on the concurrent themes in the internationaliza-
tion, however, shows no integration of themes in the process
in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region. This study
therefore considers it of high importance to review the HE
sector and raise awareness of the internationalization per-
spectives prevalent here.
Although universities have been international since
ancient times, globalization has brought in new contextual
environments for the universities to operate in, and increas-
ingly, the universities the world over are trying to interna-
tionalize their operations (Ahmed & Rao, 2011). Although
scholars such as Knight (2004) consider internationalization
and globalization to be different, other scholars consider that
the processes influence each other so much that the two can
be used interchangeably (Brandenburg & de Wit, 2011, in
Beck, 2012; Jowi, 2009). As each of the concepts is complex
and multi-dimensional, for the purpose of our study, interna-
tionalization will be assumed to mean the process of integrat-
ing international components into the HE system of a country,
a resultant of globalization.
HE in the GCC region goes back to about 1,400 years ago
with the advent of Islam, beginning in Saudi Arabia, with
Mecca and Medina being the centers of knowledge as well as

Internationalization and the Changing
Paradigm of Higher Education in the GCC
Countries
Julie Vardhan1
Abstract
The present study has been undertaken to examine the growth trajectory of the higher education (HE) sector across all
the countries in the GCC (Gulf Cooperation Council) region, the transition toward internationalization, quality initiatives
undertaken, and movement toward regional integration. The study aims to provide a review for the shifting paradigm through
concepts of internationalization in the literature review and to probe on the themes facing the GCC in their adaptation
to internationalization. The study is based on secondary data, mainly of the websites of 167 universities/higher education
institutions (HEIs) of GCC, which were analyzed for their adaptation to internationalization. The results show the various
perspectives of internationalization with the suggestion on regional integration. It is hoped the study would provide the HEIs
and the policy makers with a strong foundation on their internationalization efforts.

religion (Saleh, 1986). The last few decades, however, have
seen a tremendous growth, both in the number of institutions
and number of students in the GCC region. It is surprising,
therefore, that little research on internationalization of HE
either through comparative data, case studies, or institutional
experiments has been conducted in this region. The author con-
siders it important to investigate the changing paradigm of the
HE sector in the GCC, not just for advancement of knowledge
but also for institutions and policy makers to align their strate-
gies according to the internationalization practices and trends.
The present study has been undertaken to examine the
growth trajectory of the HE sector across all the countries in
the GCC region, the transition toward internationalization,
quality initiatives undertaken, and movement toward regional
integration. The study aims to provide a contextual analysis
and theoretical basis for the shifting paradigm as the implica-
tions are important for GCC internationalization efforts.
Review of Literature on
Internationalization of HE
The literature describing trends and explaining aspects of HE
internationalization has been diverse. Internationalization of
HE has been defined as "The process of integrating an inter-
national, intercultural or global dimension into the purpose,
functions or delivery of post-secondary education" (Knight,
2004, p. 11). This definition is considered to be most com-
prehensive, as apart from the modalities, the definition also
integrates an intercultural and international dimension into
all areas of the university functioning. It particularly consid-
ers internationalization to be in response to globalization,
although scholars such as Brandenburg and de Wit (2011) do
not find any marked difference as they consider both con-
cepts to be interconnected. By considering this definition of
HE internationalization, the broad themes underlying the
concept are now explored.
A brief review of literature reveals three recurring themes
around which studies have been conducted--one is about the
process of internationalization (Hawawini, 2011; Mitra,
2010; OECD, 2004), the other is regarding the outcomes
(Altbach, 2004; Ghasempoor et al., 2011; Knight, 2004,
2008), and the third is about governance (Enders, 2004;
Horta, 2009). This review follows the framework of process,
outcomes, and governance to better understand the context
of internationalization in HE, the characteristics of which
have been summarized in the Table 1.

Process in Internationalization of HE
Since The General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS)
has recognized education as one of the services in the year
2000, it has acted as an impetus for both HEIs and countries
to trade internationally in HE. The process of international-
ization includes the various modes, modalities, and models to
internationalize. For instance the different modes in which
trade in education is allowed under GATS are Program mobil-
ity, Student mobility, Institution mobility, and Academic
mobility (OECD, 2004, cited in Tilak, 2011). Ahmed and Rao
(2011) go on to explain that the HE sector's international mar-
ket foray is also similar to the "classical" sequence of multi-
national corporation (MNC) business entry: exporting,
licensing and franchising, joint ventures, and wholly owned
subsidiaries. They even employ strategic alliances and turn-
key projects. In this aspect, the sector undertakes the different
stages of internationalization as any international business
would. The choice usually depends on the resource invest-
ments, management control, and risk/return attributes
(Cateora & Graham, 2009). Each firm would decide on the
choice among exporting, licensing, or joint venture based on
firm-specific and market-specific factors that influence con-
trol, return, risk, and resources (Dunning, 1988). Specific to
the HE sector, there are studies that describe the mobility pat-
tern in accordance with GATS or consider few "models" in
HE. Hawawini (2011) mentions these five models: (a) the
import model, (b) the export model, (c) the academic joint-
venture model, (d) the partnership model, and (e) the foreign-
campus model. These models are very similar to the
international entry modes as mentioned by Dunning, and the
institutions select the one they find most suitable for their
international expansion. Another study by Mitra (2010) men-
tions franchising, double or joint degrees, articulation mod-
els, and distance education. Apart from the growing distance
education model through which a large populace even in
remote areas could be reached, a new approach is the blended
learning. Sharafuddin and Allani (2012) and Jones and Lau
(2010), while analyzing the system adopted by theArab Open
University in Kuwait, mention the advantage of combining
the e-learning with the traditional learning method to promote
learning outcomes. A growing trend is also that of collabora-
tion and joint programs, as mentioned by Chen and Huang
(2013) whose study on the development of internationaliza-
tion of HE in China finds that apart from student mobility,
there are a number of joint programs and international coop-
eration and collaboration among HEIs and other universities
and international organizations.
An interesting articulation of the internationalization of HE
was made by Beck (2012) conceptualizing it as an "eduscape,"
which is about the flow of ideas, programs, activities, and
research across national boundaries, but this flow is also influ-
enced or intercepted with other "scapes." These scapes have
been described as "ethnoscapes (the movement of people),
mediascapes (how ideas about education are formed and influ-
enced by the media), finanscapes (the movement of money in
personal lives, as well as nationally and internationally) and
ideoscapes (the manufacturing of ideas' about education)"
(Appadurai, 1990, in Beck, 2012, p. 142). According to Beck
(2012), the eduscapes could be driven by either the finans-
capes or ethnoscapes or a combination of these scapes.
Outcomes of Internationalization of HE
Although the growing importance of internationalization of
HE and its impacts on HE systems is dynamic in evolution, it
is becoming more evident that the rationales that drive the
process vary from region to region, country to country, or
even between institutions that are themselves also evolving
(Knight, 2008). The main outcome of the internationalization
process seems to be at the national level, as countries would
be interested in developing their human capital, or developing
knowledge workers for contributing to their economy.
Ghasempoor et al. (2011) list out the four rationales for inter-
nationalization: the political, the academic, the cultural/
social, and the economic. The national or political rationale is
implied through the studies of Knight (2004) and Ogachi
(2009) and is also related to ideological influences a country
may have. The academic rationale is for achieving interna-
tional standards for the institution, usually undertaken by the
institutions to ensure high-quality global standards. The eco-
nomic rationale is considered to be a direct response to the
market forces aimed at developing revenue for the university
while also developing human capital. However, there are
numerous studies that consider the cultural dimension or
rationale to be the most important issue.Al-Semary,Al-Khaja,
and Hamidou (2012), for instance, in their study describe the
concern of some authors (Grieco & Holmes, 1999) who con-
sider internationalization to be a modern version of cultural
imperialism with the western culture dominating and influ-
encing the rest of the world and propose a cultural network
model with "Multidisciplinary Education." Altbach (2004)
and Ahmed and Rao (2011) consider universities to be the
new age MNCs with the same motive for expansion--to gain
more market and earn more profit. Some scholars known for
promoting internationalization have expressed caution over
this business and commercial approach in internationalization
(Beck, 2012; Knight, 2011), mentioning it may affect the
knowledge creation and dissemination:
Universities are seen to be forced into the market place in ways
that are reshaping them in their purposes and in the knowledge
they create and disseminate. (Dixon, 2006, p. 320)
Some of the studies do provide an alternative way for
nations and institutions to counter the commoditization of edu-
cation: for instance, the study by Alfantookh and Bakry (2008)
that suggest that HE should become a public commodity with
rights, access, and mobility for everyone internationally.
Whatever the outcome considered by the institutions and the
nation for the internationalization of its HE sector, one thing for
certain is that it helps in the advancement of knowledge and

learning, which is the primary goal of all HEIs, alongside the
economic and cultural rationale.
Governance of Internationalized HEIs
The third theme of internationalization was found to be that of
governance issues. The governance theory (Enders, 2004) pos-
tulates that both state and non-state actors should participate
equally in the governance of HE unlike the hierarchical model.
HE, which was considered to be the domain of the state, is
increasingly opening to participation from private players. A
study by Conner and Rabovsky (2011) corroborates the fact
that as state governments have faced increasing pressures to
fund competing programs, and have endured difficult reces-
sions that saw dramatic declines in state revenues, they are
increasingly finding it difficult to maintain support levels for
public institutions of higher learning. Another study on the
internationalization of HE in China by Liu and Dai (2012) con-
siders three concrete issues: the internationalization of curri-
cula and teaching, of management, and of communication.
Whereas the perspective on the internationalization of curricu-
lum views the issue from the international background of facul-
ties, curriculum, and use of foreign language, the
internationalization of university management discusses about
the internal and external operating mechanisms.As internation-
alization occurs at all levels of the university, exchange and
collaboration also occur at all levels. Three areas of exchange
and cooperation are identified as academic research, collabora-
tive education and exchange of teachers and students (Liu &
Dai, 2012). This can also be termed as glonacal that consists of
intersections, interactions, and mutual determinations of global,
national, and local level in the HE (Marginson & Rhoades,
2002, cited in Horta, 2009). Other studies that consider the
local and the global tendencies to be blurred with each being
interdependent on the other are Robertson (1992, 1997, in
Beck, 2012) and Edwards and Usher (2000). Summarizing
these views, Beck (2012) mentions the porousness of the
boundaries between local and global, and the stretching of rela-
tionships with the international study itself being a good exam-
ple of how global trends supersede and become local. The
governance pattern may be inferred to be more influenced by
internationalization if the countries and institutions are more
flexible to the effects and benefits of internationalization.
However, most of the economies have developed their gover-
nance mechanism for both public and private universities to
maintain standard and academic quality.
Methodology of the Study
The present study has been undertaken to analyze the various
theories and schools of thought present in the literature of
HE and its internationalization. The different, at times con-
trasting viewpoints, on internationalization in the HE show
that it is a much debated and researched topic in the aca-
demia. The present study, however, is not about arguing for
one proposition over the other or advocating another model
on outcomes, governance, and stages, but to suggest the
impact of internationalization in the GCC countries. Given
the objective of this research to review the phenomenon of
internationalization, this study uses secondary data for analy-
sis, through a content analysis of the websites of the universi-
ties. When the data are to be used as evidence for a
phenomenon under investigation, secondary data analysis
would be appropriate (Irwin, 2013). The content analysis
process follows the stages as elaborated in the studies of
Srnka and Koeszegi (2007) and Vaitkevicius and Kazokiene
(2013) with ample modification because the unit of analysis
for the study is implicit in the websites of the universities.
The stages mentioned in these studies are as follows:
a. Data sourcing
b. Transcription
c. Data unitization
d. Categorization
e. Coding
Sample Size and Data Collection
Content analysis is a very detailed and time-consuming pro-
cess, and this places restrictions on the size of the final sam-
ple (Harris & Attour, 2003, in Sicilia, Pérez, & Heffernan,
2008). However, as the objective of the study is the HE sec-
tor in the GCC region, the study drew the sample from the
official websites of the Ministry of Higher Education in each
of the six countries. Furthermore, a total of 167 university
websites from which data could be found were accessed for
gathering information; their distribution is shown in Table 2.
Procedure
Hwang, McMillan, and Lee (2003) in their study mention the
complexity of website content analysis, much more than the
traditional media because of interconnectedness of individ-
ual pages and presence of information or units of analysis in
a number of pages.However, the websites are the most pow-
erful tool for accessing information, hence this study chose
the websites for analysing the internationalization efforts in
Vardhan 5
the universities. The analysis of the 167 websites was
restricted to the English version of these websites as English
is the international language most predominantly used.
Corresponding to the third stage, requiring unitization was
also modified considerably as internationalization was
implicit through the website content. The various words,
phrases, and texts that were used for the unitization purpose
in the website were found to be "international," "global,"
"international partnerships," "international collaboration,"
"worldrenowned faculty," and "diverse students, multicul-
tural." The period for accessing and unitization of the web-
sites were from August 2010 to December 2012.
Coding Scheme
The present study is about the changing paradigm of the
HEIs due to internationalization; therefore, the only category
considered for the various unitization were the words or
phrases mentioned earlier that were indicative of the "inter-
nationalization phenomenon" and were coded as 1 to denote
the HEI being international. This scheme is based on the
observation of Hwang et al. (2003) in Sicilia et al. (2008) that
researchers generally need to develop their own coding
scheme for analyzing content.
The next section outlines the demographics that would
further help in understanding the sector perspective in the
GCC region, which is then followed by the observations of
the content analysis done on the HEI websites of the GCC
countries.
Review of HE Sector in GCC
Demographics of GCC
Cooperation Council for the Arab States of the Gulf (GCC)
was established in 1981 by the leaders of the United Arab
Emirates, The State of Bahrain, The Kingdom of SaudiArabia,
The Sultanate of Oman, the State of Qatar, and The State of
Kuwait. The basic objective of the Cooperation Council is to
effect cooperation, integration, and coordination among mem-
ber states, with education being one of the fields. The HE sec-
tor in the GCC has been trying to keep up with the changes in
the globalized world, with the changes being at times radical
and continuous, with each member country advocating and
implementing policies to advance growth of the sector.
However, the Council countries, such as other countries in the
world, face a body of challenges imposed by new develop-
ments in the international scene, which can be summarized in
globalization, advanced technology, media openness, knowl-
edge and information explosion, and economic and cultural
coalitions (Supreme Council Resolution on Education,
2002). As the population (from 43 to 46 million in the period
2009-2011) and economy (from US$21,000 to US$30,000 in
the period 2009-2011; according to the GCC Statistics, 2011)
of the region grew, the HE sector too witnessed a changing
pattern. According to reports by Alpen Capital (2010), the
total students in GCC region is expected to grow at a
Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 1.8% during
2010 to 2020 to reach 11.3 million in 2020 from 9.5 million
in 2010 (Nazzal, 2012). Number of tertiary students is
expected to grow at a highest CAGR of 5.5%. The share of
tertiary education students is expected to rise from 11% in
2010 to 15% in 2020 in the overall education sector.
HE: Changing Paradigm Due to
Internationalization
With the growing GDP and per capita in the region, the gov-
ernments are realizing the importance of developing human
capital for the economic growth to be sustainable. There are
several reasons for this: changing demographics, the
increased number of secondary school pass-outs, wish for
continual learning, and the growth of the information tech-
nology (Mitra, 2010). A set of 167 university websites of
GCC were studied for an understanding of their objectives
and effort for internationalization. Among these, the year of
establishment for 145 universities was found. These were
then tabulated to understand the growth trend of the universi-
ties in the region and are depicted in Figure 1. Umm Al-Qura
University established in Mecca in 1949 is the first univer-
sity in Saudi Arabia and also GCC to be established although
King Saud University established in 1957 is considered to be
the first HE provider as we know it today. Although most of
the GCC countries had one or two public universities, estab-
lished prior to the nineties, it is only after the year 2000 that
the countries have shown a remarkable increase in the num-
bers. Although a part of the growth trend can be attributed to
the rising population, it is not the only factor. As mentioned
earlier, the rationale could vary from purely economic rea-
sons of developing human capital to market reason of com-
petition to creating global institutions or a combination of all
of them. The growth in HE sector as seen through the increas-
ing number of HEIs in the GCC countries would bring
around the theoretical concepts mentioned in the previous
section at varying degrees, sometimes intertwined and inter-
mingled with each other.

Process of Internationalization in GCC
A look at the processes of internationalization in the GCC
reveals the several modes, modalities, and models prevalent
in the region. Citing Verbik and Lasanowski (2007), Ogachi
(2009) outlines four categories of countries in the interna-
tionalization process. The first category are the United States,
the United Kingdom, and Australia, considered the "major
players" as they have some of the best universities and are
English speaking so students from all over the world seek
them. The second category is that of countries such as
Germany and France, which attract students from neighbor-
ing countries and countries with socio-cultural or historical
ties. The third category is the evolving countries of Japan,
Canada, and New Zealand, which have started attracting
between 75,000 and 115,000 overseas students per year. The
last category is the "emerging contenders" that includes
Malaysia, Singapore, and China. These countries have real-
ized the importance of global education and are spending
resources toward developing "world-class" HE to effectively
compete in the global student market. The countries of the
GCC from this description would fall in the fourth category.
Moreover, a large population of the student community is
also moving to the first or second categories of countries
seeking HE. For example, according to a report published at
the Saudi Ministry of Higher Education, Saudi Arabia is
ranked by UNESCO as the fourth country on the movement
of the students around the world; SaudiArabia ranked behind
China (421,000 students), India (153,300 students), and
South Korea (105,300 students), being ahead of Japan and
the United States in student movement around the world
(Alamri, 2011).
Through the content analysis of the websites, it was ascer-
tained if the university was a public university or a private
university, a public university being sponsored by the Federal
government of the respective countries. This was further
checked on the Ministry of Education websites of the coun-
tries as they have a list of public universities and the accred-
ited private universities.
The second step in our content analysis was to find the
"international" aspect of the universities, which was done
through the following words or phrases considered as our
unitization: "international," "global," "international partner-
ships," "international collaboration," "worldrenowned fac-
ulty," and "diverse students, multicultural." The findings
have been tabulated in Table 3.
As mentioned earlier, although it is difficult to ascertain
the main rationale for internationalizing, what is for certain
is that most of the GCC countries have public and private
institutions that are increasingly getting accreditations or
partnerships with international universities so that their
courses are more acceptable internationally. Moreover, inter-
national universities establishing their campuses are also
considerable in number in many of these countries. Among
the 167 universities and HEIs reviewed for the present study,
the number of private universities/institutions was 103.
Among these private universities, as many as 70 have either
partnerships/collaborations with an international university
or are branch campuses of international universities.
These countries have different stages of international col-
laborations with the majority of the source countries being
the United States, the United Kingdom, Australia, the
Netherlands, and India. These universities variously repre-
sent the modes and mobility stages of internationalization,
for example, while Saudi Arabia with such large number of
students going abroad is in the student's mobility stage, there
are also a large number of students coming to its shore par-
ticularly for Islamic studies--thus showing both import and
export. UAE and Qatar are examples of countries that are at
the forefront of the "branch campus model" that alludes to
"institution mobility" according to GATS. Oman and Kuwait
would be likely examples of the partnership model, with the
universities developing programs affiliated to some foreign
Vardhan 7
universities, and Bahrain follows the "twinning model"
where the students study for a part of the program in the host
country and another in the home country.
Rationale for Internationalization
Although a study by Al-Yousif (2008) on the interaction
between human capital and economic growth paints a mixed
picture, the results vary according to countries. Moreover, the
causality between education and economic growth is a bidi-
rectional one, refuting the existing literature showing causal-
ity from human capital to economic growth. Policy makers
are hence focusing on developing the HE sector, investing in
developing hubs, increasingly seeking participation from the
private sector and moving toward internationalization.
One of the reasons for the growing demand for the private
universities and international partnership/collaboration is the
growing population and the growing economy, although the
expansion and internationalization of HEIs should not be
alluded to the "youth bulge" (Buckner, 2011, p. 22) but also
explicit policy changes on the part of governments to expand
university enrollments. Despite some areas of concern, as
building large-scale massification and commoditization of
education, and the concern about national values getting
eroded (Raven, 2011), most of the Gulf policy makers are
promoting internationalization, hopefully balancing out the
internationalization efforts with efforts to integrate the
national and the local perspective, creating the "glonacal"
determinants.
Governance Issues
Buckner's (2011) analysis of the reforms initiated by the
states is classified into three major groups: Neoliberal,
Quality Assurance, and Imported Internationalization, based
on the extent to which Arab States are privatizing the provi-
sion of HE at different levels and the types of private institu-
tions being established. The neo-liberal reforms, according
to the study, aims to expand the access of HE while offsetting
costs to consumers and private sectors. This includes the
establishment of private universities, and programs that run
through "open learning" or "blended learning." The Arab
Open University in the GCC is an example of the open learn-
ing system. The second approach describes the initiative by
the state to develop quality assurance programs for all the
state and private universities. Increasingly, the countries of
the GCC are reforming their curricula to make them in line
with the needs of the modern world. Saudi Arabia, for
instance, over the years is trying to increase the non-Islamic
content, is adopting English as the language of instruction,
and is using the American system of semester and credit
hours recognizing the demands of the modern economy
(Rugh, 2002). The third model of HE policies pursued in the
Middle East and North Africa (MENA) Region according to
the study is that of Americanization, where the HE systems
modernize by establishing extensive partnerships with for-
eign universities. A number of scholars have examined how
these institutions are changing tertiary education in the UAE,
Qatar, Kuwait, and Saudi (Middle East Institute 2010).
Buckner (2011) argues that although the Gulf States are
interested in founding a knowledge economy, the oil-rich
countries are more interested in creating a global image by
inviting world-renowned universities in their established
hubs rather than directly initiating quality initiatives for
state-run institutions. The examples of Qatar and UAE estab-
lishing the Education City, Dubai International Academic
City, and Knowledge Village seem to be cases in point--
these hubs host institutions like the Northwestern University,
Carnegie Mellon University, University of Wollongng,
Heriot Watt of Scotland, Paris Sorbonne, NewYork Uniersity,
and Insead. Although the academic standards of these inter-
national universities are very high, Stasz, Eide, and Martorell
(2007) cited in Buckner (2011) point that a very small per-
centage of students actually qualify and enroll and the large
percentage of the student population in all the GCC regions
enroll in the public universities. They posit that this third
approach to internationalization is more to do with bringing
prestige and international acclaim to the Gulf States. A simi-
lar view is proposed in the study by Al-Semary et al. (2012),
which considers internationalization of HE to be the key
theme for GCC countries that are anxious to promote educa-
tion as a symbol of modernity to their population as well as
to the foreign countries.
An area of concern in the governance issues facing policy
makers and governments in this region is how to ensure qual-
ity for institutions that may be state-owned, privately owned,
or international institutions that have set their campus in
these countries. Wilkins and Huisman (2012) cites the 2002
UNDPArab Human Development Report that considered the
poor quality of education in Arab countries as "the Achilles
heel of education in the Arab world" and called for radical
reform of the education system. Although since then, the
landscape of HE has changed and as can be seen from the
number of universities each country has and the reforms ini-
tiated, each of the countries has also developed agencies to
ensure quality standards.
One of the ways to ensure quality standards throughout
the regions as well as adapt to internationalization is through
regional integration. According to some studies (Ogachi,
2009; Woldegiorgis, 2013), the regions engaging thus in
cooperation are able "to improve the quality, relevance and
accessibility, to facilitate transferability and comparability of
degrees among nations and to facilitate the mobility and
employability of students." A step in the GCC has been taken
toward regional integration with the development in 2007 of
Arab Network for Quality Assurance in Higher Education
(ANQAHE) that was established with World Bank support.
A solution could be to start with the harmonization of HE as
suggested by Woldegiorgis (2013) that is a process, not of
standardization but articulation, both horizontal and vertical,
8 SAGE Open
between programs and institutions among the HE systems of
the region. The author feels that regional integration of the
GCC in the HE sector will pave the way forward towards a
more strategic decision in the internationalization process.
Conclusion, Limitation, and Future
Research
Areview of literature on internationalization in the HE shows
three broad categories of theories--mainly related to the pro-
cess, outcomes, and governance of internationalization.
These theories are based in different contextual environ-
ments, with oftentimes strong and contrasting viewpoints of
the authors. The present study has first summarized these
theories on the basis of their categories of process, outcomes,
and governance and attempted to see the applicability of
these in the GCC region.
The first limitation of this study is regarding the method
of content analysis, which can be constrained in its potential
as it reports specific elements of a phenomenon (Kolbe &
Burnett, 1991). The website content analysis also is limited
by the changing nature of the source of data, namely, the
Internet. Pollach (2005) and Robbins and Stylianou (2003) in
Sicilia et al. (2008) mention that the content and structure of
the pages may change since the research was conducted. This
limitation of the methodology making the result indicative in
nature could be overcome through a longitudinal study in
future (Robbins & Stylianou, 2003, in Sicilia et al., 2008).
Future research could also be based on a comparative analy-
sis between regions of the developed and emerging econo-
mies, and on finding the co-relation between the processes,
outcomes, and governance.
The HE sector in GCC is at the forefront of creating a
shift in the paradigm by advancing internationalization. The
World Economic Forum for GCC considers education and
innovation as one of the themes in developing the scenario
analysis for 2025, and the way education policies are han-
dled by the GCC governments will determine the regional
innovation and knowledge-based economy (Davis &
Hayashi, 2007). In spite of numerous challenges, there has
been a considerable progress and recognition in the interna-
tionalization of HE process in a short span of time in the
GCC region.
Our conclusions suggest the current trend of HE in GCC,
that highlights that the region offers a tremendous potential
for internationalization through the different outcomes, pro-
cesses, and governance methods, which are present in vary-
ing degrees across the different countries of the region. It is
hoped the study will provide a basis for future empirical
research on these areas in this region and would help in fur-
thering the internationalization efforts.
