Objective: To identify gender differences in violent deaths in terms of incidence, circumstances, and
methods of death.
Design: Analysis of surveillance data.
Setting: North Carolina, a state of 8.6 million residents on the eastern seaboard of the US.
Subjects: 1674 North Carolina residents who died from violence in the state during 2004.
Methods: Information on violent deaths was collected by the North Carolina Violent Death Reporting
System using data from death certificates, medical examiner reports, and law enforcement agency
incidence reports.
Results: Suicide and homicide rates were lower for females than males. For suicides, females were more
likely than males to have a diagnosis of depression (55% v 36%), a current mental health problem (66% v
42%), or a history of suicide attempts (25% v 13%). Firearms were the sole method of suicide in 65% of
males and 42% of females. Poisonings were more common in female than male suicides (37% v 12%).
Male and female homicide victims were most likely to die from a handgun or a sharp instrument. Fifty
seven percent of female homicides involved intimate partner violence, compared with 13% of male
homicides. Among female homicides involving intimate partner violence, 78% occurred in the woman's
home. White females had a higher rate of suicide than African-American females, but African-American
females had a higher rate of homicide than white females.
Conclusions: The incidence, circumstances, and methods of fatal violence differ greatly between females
and males. These differences should be taken into account in the development of violence prevention
efforts.
Deaths from violence exact a high burden of suffering
worldwide.1 Suicides and homicides are at epidemic
proportions in the US.2 Almost 51 000 US residents die
every year from violence.3 The most common manner of
violent death for both females and males is suicide, followed
by homicide.4 In the US, suicide and homicide rates have
been consistently lower among females than males.4 5
Research has started to compare female and male suicides
in terms of a variety of factors, including the demographic
characteristics, and the methods that they used to kill
themselves (firearm, poisoning, etc). This research has
generally found racial differences in suicides. Suicide is more
common among whites than blacks for both females and
males.4 Age is also associated with suicide. Females and
males are more likely to commit suicide between the ages of
25 and 44, and males are more likely to commit suicide after
age 65.6 Although the majority of suicides are committed
using firearms, females are more likely than males to use
other types of suicide methods, especially poisoning.6
Females tend to attempt suicide more frequently than males;
however males' attempts are more likely to be fatal.7
Likewise, extensive research has examined various aspects
of female and male homicides. Most research has found
racial differences in homicide rates of both females and
males. Blacks are more likely than whites to be homicide
victims.4 In addition, homicide rates vary by age. Males aged
20­24 years and females aged 25­34 are at the highest risk
for homicide.3 Firearms are the most commonly used method
of homicide in the US, accounting for 56% of all homicides in
2001.3 Firearm inflicted homicides are more common among
males than females.5 8 9 In the majority of female and male
homicides, the suspect/perpetrator is known to the victim.10
However, female homicides are more likely than male
homicides to be committed by an intimate partner or family
member, whereas male homicides are more likely than
female homicides to be committed by a stranger or an
acquaintance.9­17
Although past research suggests that the mechanisms and
circumstances of deaths from violence in females and males
differ, few details have been available concerning these
differences. The findings from the first year of data from the
North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC-VDRS)
provide an opportunity to begin assessing traditional and
novel data on circumstances concerning deaths from violence
gathered from multiple sources. This timely information will
be helpful to public health practitioners and others in their
efforts to design and implement more effective violence
prevention programs.
METHODS
The National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS) is a
new US database of incidents where ``the intentional use of
physical force or power against oneself, another person, or
against a group or community'' resulted in at least one death
of the people involved in the incident. The system contains
detailed standardized information on victims and suspects,
characteristics of the relationship(s) between victim(s) and

suspect(s), descriptions of the mechanism/method that
resulted in the death, and detailed information on the
circumstances that led to, or occurred during, the death. This
information is gathered by trained abstracters from multiple
sources, including death certificates, medical examiner
records, law enforcement reports and crime laboratories.
The purpose and data collection methods used in the NVDRS
are fully described elsewhere.18
The North Carolina Violent Death Reporting System (NC-
VDRS) began collecting data on 1 January 2004. Eligible
incidents are identified by matching death certificates and
medical examiner information using manner of death and
NVDRS-selected International Classification of Disease, 10th
revision (ICD-10) codes.18
The data analyzed in this paper included all NVDRS-
eligible deaths that occurred in state residents who died in
North Carolina during the 2004 calendar year. Age and race
specific mortality rates were calculated per 100 000 popula-
tion with 95% confidence intervals. Mortality rates were not
computed when the number of deaths was less than 15. The
NC-VDRS is approved by the Public Health IRB at the
University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and the NC
Division of Public Health.
RESULTS
There were a total of 1730 deaths from violence in North
Carolina in 2004. Most of these deaths were North Carolina
residents (96%) who died in-state. This paper refers to these
383 female deaths (23%) and 1291 male deaths (77%). Data
were also examined on the 330 suspects on whom informa-
tion was available who were involved in these 1674 deaths,
including suspects who were not state residents.
The overall mortality rates per 100 000 population from
violence by gender were much lower in females (8.8; 95% CI
7.9 to 9.7) than in males (30.7; 95% CI 29.0 to 32.4). For
suicide and homicide, there were at least three times as many
violent deaths among males compared to females. There were
234 female suicides and 782 male suicides. There were 134
female homicides and 449 male homicides. In contrast to the
mortality patterns between females and males, the within-
gender percentage of mortality for suicides and homicides
was identical: 61% of both females and males died by suicide
and 35% of both females and males were victims of
homicides (fig 1).
Comparable gender patterns for deaths from suicide and
homicide were not observed for deaths from unintentional
firearms (2 females v 12 males), legal intervention (0 females
v 21 males), and undetermined intent (13 females v 27
males). Because the number of these deaths was only 4.5% of
the total, the remainder of the results focuses only on suicide
and homicide and considers them separately.
Suicide
The NC suicide rate per 100 000 population in females in
2004 (5.4; 95% CI 4.7 to 6.1) was less than half the suicide
rate for males (18.6; 95% CI 17.3 to 19.9). Suicides were
largely concentrated in whites (table 1). The distribution by
race was similar for female and male suicides (approximately
90% white). However, the white to African American suicide
rates were 3.3 times as high in females (6.6 per 100 000
population v 2.0) and 2.4 times as high in males (21.8 per
100 000 population v 8.9).
The age profiles of NC suicides varied by gender in 2004
(table 1). The highest age specific suicide rate per 100 000
population was observed for females between ages 45 to 54
(9.6; 95% CI 7.1 to 12.1). The highest suicides rates for males
occurred between ages 35 to 44 (29.0; 95% CI 24.8 to 33.1)
and in the age groups of 75 to 84 (38.2; 95% CI 27.9 to 48.5)
and 85 and older (55.8; 95% CI 30.7 to 80.9).
Suicides were most often initiated in a house or apartment
in both females (85%) and males (83%).
Firearms were the most common method of suicide overall
(60%) and for both males (65%) and females (42%) (fig 2).
The majority of firearms used were handguns (66%). In
contrast to males, the method of suicide among females was
almost equally divided between firearms (42%) and poisons
(37%) (fig 2), accounting for 79% of female suicides.
Hanging, strangulation, and asphyxiation were the third
most common method of suicide in females and the second
most common method in males.
Over one half of female (62%) and male suicide victims
(56%) were reported by a friend or family member as having
a depressed mood immediately prior to death (table 2). When
a medical history was recorded, 66% of the females who
committed suicide were reported as having a current mental
health problem--most were a diagnosis of depression (55%).
This proportion of depression in females was much higher
than was reported for male suicides (36%). Female suicide
victims (58%) were nearly twice as likely as males (33%) to
have been currently receiving mental health services, defined
as having a current prescription for a psychiatric medication,
or seeing a mental health professional within the two months
prior to suicide. One quarter of females who committed
suicide (n = 55), in contrast to one eighth of males (n = 90),
had a history of at least one previous suicide attempt. Less
than one quarter of the females and males disclosed their
intent to commit suicide and less than a one third left a
suicide note.
New types of information in the NVDRS from medical
examiners and law enforcement appear to shed light on the
circumstances associated with suicide. One example is a
history of having had a crisis or an acute precipitating event
that appeared to have contributed to the suicide. These are
defined in the NVDRS as physical health, intimate partner,
other relationship, job, school, financial, or legal problems
that occurred within two weeks of the death or were
scheduled to occur within two weeks after the victim's
deaths.
A crisis was reported to have occurred in 22% of the 234
females and 29% of the 782 males who committed suicide.

For suicide victims with a history of intimate partner violence
(48 females and 217 males), over half of the females (57%)
and males (54%) were reported to have had a crisis. Fifty two
males (7.3%) who committed suicide were reported to have
been a perpetrator of intimate partner violence; of these, 78%
had a crisis. Only two female suicides were perpetrators of
intimate partner violence (0.9%).
Homicide
The homicide rate per 100 000 population in females in 2004
was 3.1 (95% CI 2.6 to 3.6). As with suicide, this is less than
one third the homicide rate for males (10.7; 95% CI 9.7 to
11.7). There is greater interracial variation in homicide rates
(table 3) than observed in suicide rates (table 1) for males.
The homicide rate per 100 000 population in African
American females (5.2; 95% CI 3.8 to 6.6) was over twice
that for white females (2.4; 95% CI 1.9 to 2.9), whereas the
homicide rate per 100 000 population in African American
males (27.7; 95% CI 24.3 to 31.2) was almost five times the
rate in white males (5.6; 95% CI 4.8 to 6.5).
The highest rate of homicides per 100 000 population in
females (5.3; 95% CI 3.35 to 7.0) occurred at an older age
(35­44 years) than the highest rate (27.2; 95% CI 21.4 to
32.9) in males (ages 20­24) (table 3).
Firearms and sharp instruments were the predominant
methods of homicide among females and males (fig 3).
Patterns, however, differed by sex. Firearms resulted in 71%
of the homicides in males (n = 318), in contrast to 48% in
females (n = 64). The handgun was the most common type
of firearm used in male (66%) and female (61%) homicides.
Sharp instruments were used more often in female homicides
(20%) than in male homicides (15%). More females (11%)
than males (2%) were killed by hanging, strangulation, and
suffocation.
For those homicide cases in which the number of suspects
could be determined (70% in females and 61% in males), the
relationship of the victim to the suspect (table 4) differed by
sex. When known, the suspect in female homicides was more
likely to be a spouse, ex-spouse, boyfriend/girlfriend, or
former boyfriend/girlfriend (n = 38, 28%), than in male
homicides (n = 19, 4%). A stranger was reported only once
as the suspect in all female homicides (0.7%) in contrast to
the suspect being reported as a stranger (n = 14) in male
homicides (3%). Rape or sexual assault (n = 6) was reported
for 6% of the females homicides and none of the male
homicides.
Argument, abuse, or conflict were the most common
precipitating factors of female (n = 79, 76%) and male
(n = 193, 65%) homicides (table 4). The frequency of
arguments that resulted in death differed by gender.
Intimate partner violence was listed as a circumstance in 98
NC homicides in 2004 and was the leading cause of female
homicide (57%), in contrast to male homicide (13%). The
decedent was female in 60% of homicides that involved
intimate partner violence. Most (78%) of the fatalities in
females from intimate partner violence occurred in the
woman's home.
DISCUSSION
In 2004, suicides were the leading cause of death from
violence in North Carolina and the US. Consistent with

national data, the 2004 NC-VDRS data found that the
mortality rates from suicide and homicide were consistently
lower in females than in males. For both males and females,
suicide rates were about twice as high as homicide rates (rate
ratios of 1.7 in both males and females), and the proportion
of suicides (61%) and homicide (35%) to all deaths from
violence and unintentional firearms was the same for NC
males and females. These data are supported by other larger
and more long term studies on homicides and suicides, and
suggest that these new insights may be immediately useful
public health information.
NC-VDRS data indicate that there are several critical
factors specific to death from violence in females that are
not as frequently reported in males. Females who committed
suicide in NC were more likely than males to have a medical
diagnosis of depression and females were also more likely
than males to have a history of suicide attempts. Intimate
partner violence was the dominant cause of female homicide,
whereas a male homicide more often resulted from other
types of arguments or conflict. The suspect in homicides was
more likely to have been a spouse/ex-spouse/intimate partner
or former intimate partner of females than males. Among NC
African American females, the homicide rate exceeded the
suicide rate, whereas the opposite was true for white females.
Despite decades of research into suicide, many key
questions remain unanswered. The NC-VDRS clearly
demonstrated that women commit suicide by poison more
often than men. However, many more years of information
on circumstances will need to be collected if we are to
understand why females select poisons over firearms, and
what are the inciting events. We need to know how we can
capitalize on the advantages afforded by the facts that
females are more likely than males to have seen a
professional for depression or have had a prior suicide
attempt, and that females are more likely than males to
survive a suicide attempt. Research suggests that firearms
have a higher case fatality rate than poisonings.19 Therefore,
in terms of developing and implementing intervention
strategies, the difference in the choice of suicide method
may be the most profound difference between females and
males since it the main reason that females are more likely
than males to survive a suicide attempt.
NC-VDRS data strongly suggest that more resources should
be devoted to the primary prevention of suicide, and support
the Institute of Medicine's recommendations on reducing
suicides.20 This includes funding more gatekeeper training,
currently underway in North Carolina; the piloting of
programs for coping and resiliency training as part of the
curriculum for school aged children and continuing educa-
tion for seniors; and the development and dissemination to
primary care providers of tools for the recognition, screening,
and referral to mental health professionals of patients with

acute and chronic suicide risk factors.20 Also necessary are
improved availability of and access to mental health services
and more effective suicide prevention counseling for youth
and the elderly. Mental health services should be assessed to
ensure that they are specific to the different needs of females
and males, and that they are responsive to indicators of
imminent crises that may lead to suicide. Although poisons
were used in many suicides among females, firearms were
the most common methods used in suicides among males
and females. Research by others suggests that limiting access
to firearms may be an important and effective strategy for
reducing suicide deaths.7 19
Homicides in females showed some similarity to male
homicides. However, NC-VDRS data and other sources,11­
14 17 21­23 make it clear that intimate partner violence plays a
leading role in many female homicides. A study of female
homicides among North Carolina adolescents also revealed
that female adolescents were most commonly killed by an
intimate partner.23 Primary prevention of intimate partner
violence should include programs to teach adolescents about
healthy relationships and how to prevent dating violence. A
greater awareness of intimate partner violence and its
potential for homicide among the general public may be a
powerful agent for long term change. Thus, the provision of
frequent, timely, and accurate statistics via the national and
state VDRS programs is, in itself, an intervention. For the
short term acute phase of these attacks, dedicated policing
teams, stronger legislation aimed at protecting females, more
support for, and use of, domestic violence protective orders,
and the provision of safe havens and support networks, are
critical prevention initiatives that need to be supported and
strengthened at the local, state, and federal level.
One of the strengths of the North Carolina death
investigation system is the North Carolina Office of the
Chief Medical Examiner (OCME), which oversees a statewide
system of trained medical examiners who investigate all non-
natural deaths, complete most sections of the death
certificate, and complete a standardized field investigation
report that is reviewed by an OCME pathologist. Most deaths
from violence are autopsied and are part of the data
abstracted by NC-VDRS staff. Almost all North Carolina law
enforcement agencies provide incident reports to the NC-
VDRS. This study also benefited from being associated with
the NVDRS as it employs standard and consistent definitions
and case-finding methodologies for all deaths from violence
from multiple sources of data.
However, because the system is based on the collection of
data from existing records, the completeness of the informa-
tion is limited by the accuracy and depth of detail recorded
by sources such as the medical examiner investigating a
non-natural death and law enforcement officers completing
incident reports. A specific weakness of the NC-VDRS data is

the high proportion of missing data on suspects, particularly
in cases for which there are no known suspects. Another
specific weakness is that circumstances information recorded
by medical examiners amd law enforcement may be subject
to underreporting, for example with regard to history of
mental illness or previous attempts for suicide victims.
Underreporting could occur if relatives or family members
were unaware or unwilling to provide this information, or if
authorities were unable or neglected to ascertain this
information.
CONCLUSION
Fatal violence in females is distinct from fatal violence in
men. Current prevention initiatives addressing violence in
females need to be strengthened, and new gender-specific
initiatives developed, if we are to successfully address
violence that leads to fatalities. The primary prevention of
intimate partner violence, including dating violence, and
more effective mental health services, particularly when a
diagnosis of depression or a suicide attempt has been made,
are two pressing areas that these data suggest should be
addressed. As most deaths from violence are suicides, further
research should examine and develop effective therapeutic
and programmatic approaches to individuals with diagnoses
of depression and suicide attempts. Finally, research is
needed to develop and evaluate effective, comprehensive,
and evidence-based primary prevention programs for all
types of violence that have the potential to result in death.

Key points
N Information from the Violent Death Reporting System is
very useful in comparing violent deaths between males
and females.
N Suicide and homicide rates are lower for females than
males.
N Firearms are the most common method of death for
male and female suicides and homicides.
N Females who commit suicide are more likely than males
who commit suicide to have had mental health
problems and previous suicide attempts.
N Female homicides are more likely than male homicides
to involve intimate partner violence.
