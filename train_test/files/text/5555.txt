Introduction
The 5/6 nephrectomy (5/6 NE) is a well established model
of progressive renal injury that is characterized by sys-
temic hypertension, loss of renal function, proteinuria and
histological changes, similar to those observed in many
human renal diseases.1,2 The increase in Angiotensin II
(AII) production by the remaining kidney contributes to
the development of glomerular hypertension and hypertro-
phy, resulting in progressive renal damage.3 Hypertrophy
and glomerular hypertension stretch the epithelial glomer-
ular cells, resulting in severe loss of podocytes in the urine
and proteinuria.4 The leakage of proteins into tubular fluid
provokes interstitial inflammation that aggravates renal
lesions.5,6 Proteins can stimulate proximal tubular cells to
synthesize chemokines, such as monocyte chemoattractant
protein-1 (MCP-1), which recruit monocytes and mac-
rophages.7 The monocyte/macrophage inflammatory cells
can produce AII, which also plays an important role in
both inflammation and in renal hemodynamic changes.4
AII is a potent inducer of transforming growth factor-
(TGF-) and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), and
these cytokines mediate some of the AII effects.8,9 TGF-,
one of the major fibrogenic cytokines, enhances the syn-
thesis of matrix components and blocks matrix degrada-
tion, thereby promoting extracellular matrix (ECM)
accumulation.8,10 TGF- and AII can induce phenotypic
modification in cells, causing them to express -smooth
muscle actin and increase the production of collagen and
other ECM components. AII can also activate nuclear
factor-B (NF-B) and mitogen-activated protein kinases

Abstract
Introduction: Cecropia pachystachya (CP) is a plant rich in polyphenols which inhibits the angiotensin-converting enzyme
(ACE) in vitro. Angiotensin II (AII) has an important role in the renal lesion provoked by 5/6 nephrectomy (NE). This
study evaluated the CP extract effect on renal lesions provoked by 5/6 NE.
Materials and methods: Male Wistar rats submitted to 5/6 NE were treated or not treated with CP extract and
followed for 90 days. Systemic blood pressure (SBP), albuminuria, renal functional and structural parameters, ACE activity,
urinary levels of monocyte chemoattrant protein-1 (MCP-1) and transforming growth factor  (TGF-) were evaluated.
Results: Albuminuria and hypertension were less intense in the treated (NE+CP) group compared to the untreated
(NE) group. CP extract treatment reduced the fall in glomerular filtration rate observed in NE rats. Glomerulosclerosis,
tubulointerstitial lesions, increase of macrophages and AII positive cells in the renal cortex, as well as increases in renal
ACE activity, urinary levels of MCP-1 and TGF- were attenuated in NE rats by CP treatment.
Conclusions: The treatment with CP extract reduced the SBP and functional and structural renal changes in 5/6 NE
rats. These effects were associated with decreased AII expression, ACE activity and inflammation in the renal cortex.

(MAPK).11,12 The MAPK c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)
and NF-B have been implicated in apoptosis, inflamma-
tion and the synthesis of inflammatory mediators. The
renoprotection by antagonists of AII has been extensively
demonstrated in models of nephropathies and in prospec-
tive controlled trials in patients with kidney disease.13­15
Cecropia pachystachya (CP) is a plant that grows in the
rainforests of South America and is popularly known in
Brazil as embauba. The plants that belong to the genus of
Cecropia are traditionally used in several Latin American
countries to treat hypertension, and pulmonary and cardiac
disease.16 CP extract is a rich source of polyphenols,
mainly flavonoids, that have antioxidant and anti-inflam-
matory activities. 17­19 The antihypertensive and cardio-
vascular protective effects of flavonoids and procyanidins
present in food were associated with angiotensin convert-
ing enzyme (ACE) inhibition.20,21 Polyphenols isolated
from CP leaf extract such as orientin, isoorientin, isovi-
texin, isoquercitrin and procyanidins, can provoke ACE
inhibition in vitro.22 However, studies of the effect of CP
extract on the progression of kidney disease have not been
performed yet. Therefore, the aim of our study was to eval-
uate the effect of CP extract on renal injury provoked by
5/6 NE.
Materials and methods
Animals and experimental protocols
A total of 44 male Wistar rats (180­200 g) were used in
this study. The animals were maintained in a total of four
animals per cage at a temperature of 22°C with a light-dark
cycle of 12 h and fed with standard diet ad libitum. The
experiments were performed in accordance with the ethi-
cal principles for animal experimentation adopted by the
Brazilian College of Animal Experimentation, and the
Animal Experimentation Committee of the University of
São Paulo at Ribeirão Preto School of Medicine approved
the study protocol (COBEA/CETEA/FMRP-USP, proto-
col no. 050/2010). The animals were subjected to 5/6 NE
according to the technique described previously.23 The ani-
mals were anesthetized with 2.5% tribromoethanol solu-
tion in phosphate-buffered solution (PBS) (0.15 mol/l
NaCl and 0.01 mol/l phosphate buffer, pH=7.4) adminis-
tered intraperitoneally (1 ml/100 g). The right kidney was
removed, and an infarction was provoked in two-thirds of
the left kidney by ligation of one or two branches of the
left renal artery. In the control group, a sham (S) operation
with manipulation of the renal pedicles without causing
ischemia or destruction of renal tissue was performed via
laparotomy. The animals were divided into four groups,
which received the following treatments beginning 15
days after surgery: sham group (S) (n=10): untreated ani-
mals that underwent the sham surgery; sham+CP (S+CP)
(n=9): animals that underwent the sham surgery and were
treated with CP extract; nephrectomized (NE) (n=11): 5/6
NE animals that were untreated; and nephrectomized+CP
(NE+CP) (n=14): 5/6 NE animals that were treated with
CP extract. After the surgical procedure, all groups were
followed for a period of 90 days. Body weight (BW) and
systolic blood pressure (SBP), measured by the tail-cuff
method (CODA System, Kent Scientific, Torrington,
Connecticut, USA) were evaluated each month from 15­
90 days after surgery. The animals were placed in meta-
bolic cages for 24 h, and urine samples were collected to
quantify albumin excretion (AE).
Preparation, standardization and administration
of CP extract
CP leaves were collected at Ribeirão Preto (­21.167925,
­47.859927, altitude 546 m), State of São Paulo, Brazil.
Botanical identification was performed by Gerson O
Romão of the Herbarium of the Escola Superior de
Agricultura Luiz de Queiroz of the University of São Paulo
(ESALQ-USP),wherethevoucherspecimen(ESA120140)
was deposited. Leaves were washed and then dried in the
shade for 10 days. The leaves were completely dehydrated
at 40°C for three days. The dried CP leaves were ground in
a mill (type Wyllie, Tecnal, Piracicaba, São Paulo, Brazil)
to obtain the powder that was used to prepare the CP
extract. The CP extract was prepared at a proportion of 2%
w/v (weight of vegetable/ volume of distilled water) for 30
min at 72°C. The CP extract was then decanted for 10 min,
vacuum filtered, frozen and lyophilized to determine the
concentration. The process was repeated throughout the 75
days of the experiment. The CP extract was administered
in amber glass drinkers given daily to the animals. Six
samples in triplicate were lyophilized weekly before and
during the experiment to verify the concentration of CP
extract. Based on an evaluation of water consumption of
the animals over a 24 h period, the CP extract was diluted
for administration of a dose of 0.6 g/kg. The consumed
volume (ml) of the extract per box was determined and the
mean dose was evaluated during the treatment.
Determination of the main compounds of the
CP extract
The determination of the constituents from CP was per-
formed by Liquid Chromatography-Mass Spectra in
MicroTOF Ic equipament (Bruker Daltonics). Separation
was done using RP-amide (Ascentis-Supelco, Sigma-
Aldrich) column (25 cm x 4.6 mm; 5 µM). The samples at
5 mg/ml were prepared in 0.1% formic acid and 10 µ[ was
injected into the column with a flow of 1 ml/min. The con-
stituents were eluted by linear gradient from 10 to 35%
acetonitrile-water containing 0.1% formic acid in 30 min.
The chromatography was monitored by diode array detec-
tion (DAD) at 280 nm and mass spectra. The constituents
432 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
were characterized by the retention time (RT), mass spec-
trum and ultraviolet-visible spectrum.
Renal function studies
The albumin in urine samples was quantified by electroim-
munoassay24 and the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was
evaluated 90 days after surgery by inulin clearance. The
rats were anesthetized with sodium thiopental (40 mg/kg,
intraperitoneally). After tracheostomy, the femoral artery
and vein were cannulated to collect blood samples and to
inject fluids, respectively. The ureters were cannulated to
collect urine. Urine samples were collected before the
administration of inulin solution to analyze TGF- and
MCP-1. After this urine sample collection the rats received
a priming inulin dose (12 mg/100 g diluted in PBS solu-
tion), followed by a maintenance inulin dose of 0.5 mg/
min/100 g. After 60 min stabilization, urine was collected
for 1 h, and the blood was sampled at 30 and 60 min. The
kidneys were perfused through the aorta with PBS solution
and removed for histological and immunohistochemical
studies. The animals were killed via anesthesia overdose.
Inulin was quantified in the plasma and urine samples by
the method of Führ et al.25 Sodium and potassium were
measured in the plasma and urine by flame photometry
(Micronal, model 262, São Paulo, Brazil), and urine osmo-
lality was assessed by freezing point depression using an
Osmometer (Fiske OS, Norwood, Massachusetts, USA).
Quantification of TGF- and MCP-1 in urine
The urine samples collected by the ureter were immedi-
ately treated with 1 mM phenylmethylsulfonil fluoride
(PMSF, Sigma Chemical Co, St. Louis, Missouri, USA)
and stored at -70ºC until analysis. The TGF- and MCP-1
quantification was performed by ELISA using commercial
kits (Promega Corporation, Madison, Missouri, USA and
Pierce, Rockford, USA, respectively). The median values
of TGF- and MCP-1 in the urine samples are expressed in
pg of TGF- or MCP-1 per mg creatinine.
Enzymatic activity assay
ACE catalytic activity was determined fluorimetrically as
described by Friedland and Silverstein.26 The renal cortex
tissue was homogenized in borohydrate buffer 100 mM,
pH 7.2, containing sucrose 340 mM, NaCl 300 mM and
PMSF 10 mM (1 g tissue: 10 ml buffer). The homogenates
were centrifuged at 5000 rpm, at 4°C for 10 min and the
supernatant was frozen at -70oC until analyzed. An aliquot
of plasma or kidney homogenate (10 µl) was incubated
with 200 µl assay solution (ZPhe-HisLeu 1 mM, sodium
borohydride buffer 100 mM, pH 8.3, NaCl 300 mM and
ZnSO4
0.1 mM) for 10 min at 37°C. The enzymatic reac-
tion was stopped by the addition of 1.5 ml of NaOH 280
mM. The liberated dipeptide, HL (His-Leu), was measured
fluorimetrically (360 nm excitation and 465 nm emission)
using a Tecan Infinit F200 equipment as follows.27 One
hundred of o-phthaldialdehyde (20 mg/ml) diluted in
methanol was added and after 10 min the solution was
acidified with 200 µl 3N HCl and centrifuge at 3000 rpm
for 10 min at room temperate. The standard curve was
obtained using varying concentrations of L-HL and it
showed a linear relation between relative fluorescence and
HL concentration. All the assays were performed in dupli-
cate. The values median of the ACE activity in the renal
cortex or plasma are expressed in nmol/mg of protein or
mU/ml of HL produced, respectively.
Light microscopy
Histological sections (3 µM) were stained with Masson's
trichrome for examination under a light microscope. The
incidence of glomerulosclerosis was determined by scoring
50 glomeruli within a section of each kidney. The glomeru-
lar sclerosis and tubulointerstitial lesion incidence were
evaluated by scores that reflected changes in the extent of
the lesion (0: 0­5%, 1: 5­25%, 2: 25­50%, 3: 50­75%, 4:
>75%), and mean values per kidney were calculated. The
fractional interstitial area in the renal cortex was determined
by morphometry with a light camera connected to analyzer.
Twenty grid fields (measuring 0.200 mm2) were evaluated
in the renal cortex of each kidney. Interstitial areas were first
manually encircled on a video screen and then determined
by computerized morphometry (Axion version 4.8.3, Zeiss)
and the mean values per kidney were calculated.
Immunohistochemical analysis
The sections were incubated at 4°C overnight with 1/30
anti p-JNK monoclonal antibody (Santa Cruz
Biotechnology, Santa Cruz, California, USA), 1/200 anti-
AII polyclonal antibody (Peninsula Laboratories, San
Carlos, USA), or for 1 h with 1/1000 anti-ED1 monoclonal
antibody that only reacts with cytoplasmic antigen present
in macrophages and monocytes (Serotec, Oxford, UK),
1/500 anti-vimentin and 1/200 anti-desmin monoclonal
antibodies (Dako, Glostrup, Denmark). The reaction prod-
uct was detected with an avidin-biotin-peroxidase com-
plex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA).
Negative controls were created by replacing the primary
antibody with normal mouse immunoglobulin G (IgG) or
rabbit IgG for monoclonal or polyclonal antibodies,
respectively, at equivalent concentrations. The color reac-
tion was developed with immunoglobulin G (IgG, Sigma
Chemical Company, St. Louis, Missouri, USA).
The sections were counterstained with methyl green or
with Harris hematoxylin, dehydrated and mounted. To eval-
uate the immunoperoxidase staining for p-JNK, vimentin,
and the cortical glomeruli and tubulointerstitial region were
Maquiaveli et al. 433
semi-quantitatively graded through examination of 50 glo-
meruli and 30 grid fields (measuring 0.200 mm2), and the
mean score per kidney was calculated.28 Vimentin was used
as a marker of tubular cell lesions and was assessed only in
the tubulointerstitial area.29 Desmin was used as a marker of
podocyte lesions and was only evaluated at the glomerular
edge.29 The scores mainly reflected changes in the extent,
rather than the intensity, of staining and depended on the
percentage of glomeruli or grid field showing positive stain-
ing: 0: 0­5%, 1: 5­25%, 2: 25­50%, 3: 50­75% and 4:
>75%.
The number of ED1 (macrophages/monocytes)-posi-
tive cells (glomeruli and renal cortical tubulointerstitium)
and of AII (cortical tubulointerstitium) were counted
through the examination of 50 glomeruli and 30 grid fields
(measuring 0.200 mm2), respectively, and the mean counts
per kidney were calculated.
Statistical analysis
One way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the Newman-
Keuls comparison test was used for the data that were nor-
mally distributed (SBP, BW and AII) or that showed a
normal distribution after log10
transformation (AE, ED1+
and TGF-). Those data are expressed as mean and stand-
ard error of the mean (SEM) or geometric means and con-
fidence intervals, respectively. For data related to other
studied parameters, we used nonparametric Kruskall-
Wallis test with Dunn's post-test. Those data are expressed
as median and interquartile. The Mann-Whitney test was
performed for analysis of the fractional interstitial area and
mean consumed dose. Statistical analyses were performed
using GraphPad Prism version 5.0 for Windows, GraphPad
Software, San Diego, California, USA. The level of statis-
tical significance was set at p<0.05.
Results
Determination and control of the CP extract
dose
CP extract dose was determined from a previously pilot
experiment based on the effect in SBP after 15 days of the
treatment. The rats consumed a daily dose of approxi-
mately 0.6 g/kg. There was no difference (p>0.05) between
the mean dose consumed by the groups treated with CP
extract [S+CP (0.55±0.04 g/kg) and NE+CP (0.63±0.03 g/
kg)] during the 75 days of the treatment.
Determination of the main components of the
CP extract
Two predominant peaks detected at 280 nm in the
Liquid Chromatography-Electrospray Ionization-Mass
Spectrometry (LC-ESI-MS+) analysis of CP extract
represent the chlorogenic acid and orientin. The pres-
ence of chlorogenic acid was confirmed by comparison
with a UV/VIS spectrum of the authentic sample. The
RT (12.5 min) and ESI/MS+ detection (m/z 355)
matched. Chlorogenic acid was the predominant peak
in CP extract, followed by orientin. The identity of ori-
entin was confirmed by RT (14.9 min) and the fragmen-
tation patterns in ESI/MS-. It has been shown that
orientin inhibits ACE in in vitro studies.22
Systolic pressure blood (SBP), body weight and
albumin excretion (AE)
The 5/6 NE rats showed a significant increase in SBP and
AE compared to the sham rats. However, the increase in
SBP was less intense on days 30 and 90 (p<0.01) and in
AE on days 30 and 60 (p<0.05) in NE+CP rats compared
to NE rats (Table 1). There was no difference in body
weight between 5/6 NE groups (Table 1).
Renal function studies
The 5/6 NE rats presented reduction in GFR and increase
in the sodium and potassium fractional excretion com-
pared to rats from sham groups. Treatment with CP extract
reduced all these alterations. However, the change in urine
osmolality was not modified by treatment with CP extract
(Table 2).
TGF- and MCP-1 urinary excretion
Increase in the urinary excretion of TGF- and MCP-1 was
observed in 5/6 NE rats when compared to sham groups.
These alterations were attenuated by CP extract treatment
(Table 3). Data from the S+CP group are not shown.
Enzymatic activity assay
Increase in ACE activity in both renal tissue and plasma
was observed in 5/6 NE rats when compared to sham
group. The increased activity in renal tissue was attenuated
by CP extract treatment (Table 3). There was no significant
difference in ACE activity between S and S+CP groups
(data not shown).
Light microscopy
Light microscopy studies of the renal cortex of rats that
underwent 5/6 NE revealed the following morphological
features, which are characteristic of this model: glomeru-
losclerosis, tubular lumen dilation with denuded base-
ment membrane, swelling/flattening of proximal tubular
cells with brush border loss, tubular atrophy, and an
increase in the interstitial area with inflammatory cell
infiltrates. These histological changes were less intense in
434 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System 15(4)
the NE+CP rats (Figure 1(a)­(e)). The score for glomeru-
losclerosis was higher in the NE rats untreated compared
to NE+CP rats and the fractional relative interstitial area
was also higher in these rats (p<0.05, NE vs NE+CP)
(Figure 1(f)).
Immunohistochemical analysis
The expressions of vimentin in the tubulointerstitial area
and desmin at the glomerular edge were higher in the
renal cortex of 5/6 NE rats than in sham rats. These
increases were attenuated in NE rats by treatment with the
CP extract (Figure 2). The increased p-JNK expression
and the number of ED1-positive cells in the renal cortex
tubulointerstitium and glomeruli observed in 5/6 NE rats
were also lower in NE+CP rats (Figure 3). The number of
AII positive cells in the tubulointerstitial area from the
renal cortex was higher in the NE rats compared to the
sham rats and this increase was less intense in NE+CP
group (Figure 4).
Discussion
The results of this study show that treatment with CP
extract reduced the blood pressure and the functional and
structural renal changes in 5/6 NE rats. These effects were
associated with the reductions of the number of positive
cells for AII, as well as the ACE activity in the renal cor-
tex of CP-treated rats. The increase in AII renal content
could be due to higher plasma levels of AII and/or the

enhancement of renal AII production.30,31 AII has an
important role in the renal lesions observed in 5/6 NE rats.
In addition to its effect on renal and systemic hemody-
namics, AII also contributes to the inflammation and
fibrosis observed in this model of chronic kidney disease.4
The AII effects may be mediated in part by activation of
TGF-, NF-B and JNK pathways.6,7,9,13 In this study we
also observed that the increased expression of p-JNK in
the 5/6 NE rats was attenuated by CP extract treatment.
Activation of the NF-B and JNK pathways induces
apoptosis and the synthesis of inflammatory mediators
(cytokines, growth factors and adhesion molecules as well
as macrophage and monocyte chemotactic factors), lead-
ing to kidney damage.7,13
The recruitment and activation of macrophages is one
pathway whereby AII contributed for the impaired func-
tional and structural renal in the 5/6 NE. We observed a
significant reduction in the number of macrophages in the
glomeruli and tubulointerstitial area of the renal cortex
from 5/6 NE rats treated with CP extract. The reduction of
these inflammatory cells in the renal cortex of the treated
rats was associated with the reduction of AII and p-JNK
expressions, and of ACE activity in renal cortex and of the
urinary levels of TGF- and MCP-1. Macrophages can
release cytokines such as interleukin-1, TGF- and AII,
which can intensify inflammation and fibrosis observed in
the kidney from these rats.32 The orientin and chlorogenic
acid, the main compounds identified in CP extract, are well

known as potent anti-inflammatory and anti-tumoral
agents.18,19 It was also shown by in vitro studies that orien-
tin inhibits ACE22 suggesting that the CP extract effects in
the reduction of the renal injury can be related at least in
part with the decrease of the AII production in the NE rats.
The reduction of the urinary excretion of TGF- in the
NE+CP rats could be contributed with the reduction of
glomerulosclerosis and the reduction of tubulointerstitial
lesions in the NE+CP rats. There is evidence that urinary
TGF- is derived from renal biosynthesis and not from
plasma.1,33 In previous clinical and experimental studies
performed in our laboratory, we observed a correlation
between the rate of urinary TGF- excretion and the inci-
dence of glomerular sclerosis and tubule interstitial
lesions.1,34 Together, TGF- and AII can induce pheno-
typic modification in cells, causing them to express -
smooth muscle actin and increase the production of
collagen and other ECM components, which was evi-
denced by the higher fractional interstitial area in renal
cortex from NE compared to NE+CP rats.
CP extract treatment also attenuated the podocyte
lesions in the NE rats and this was evidenced by reduction
of desmin expression at the glomerular edge, a sensitive
marker of podocyte lesions.29 The reduction in podocyte
damage in the NE+CP rats can explain the decreased albu-
minuria in these animals until 60 days after surgery. There
is a correlation between urinary protein levels and the rate
of renal function decline in patients with glomerulonephri-
tis.35,36 The albumin handling by cells of the proximal
tubule can also stimulate their production of pro-inflam-
matory cytokines.7 There was a reduction in the tubuloint-
erstitial lesions in the 5/6 NE rats treated with CP extract
evidenced by reduced expression of vimentin, and of the
relative interstitial area. Vimentin is expressed in the

tubular cells only when they are proliferating.29 The
improvement of the tubular injury was associated with the
decrease in sodium and potassium fractional excretion in
the NE+CP rats.
In conclusion, the treatment with CP extract reduced
the SBP and functional and structural renal changes in the
rats submitted to 5/6 NE. These effects were associated
with the decrease of macrophage infiltration, ACE activity
and AII expression in the renal cortex of NE+CP rats. The
reduction of macrophages andAII in the renal cortex of the
rats treated with CP extract, can be explained, at least in
part, by the ACE inhibition by some components of CP
extract such as orientin. Renal and plasma ACE activity
was increased in NE rats compared to S rats, but decreased
in the NE+CP group suggesting an ACE inhibition by CP
extract. Renal ACE activity was inhibited in 67% of NE
rats by treatment with CP extract, differing from plasma
ACE that was inhibited in around 12.5%. However, tissue
AII generation by ACE does not run in parallel with AII
generation in the circulation. These results showed that in
5/6 NE rats the decrease of renal injury and hypertension
by CP extract was more related to renal than to plasma
ACE inhibition. However, further research is required to
test the ACE inhibitory activity in vivo of isolated compo-
nents of CP extract.
