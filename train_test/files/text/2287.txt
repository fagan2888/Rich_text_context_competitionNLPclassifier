Abstract: This paper discusses an analytical approach to explaining a nearly constant high
job approval rating of president Clinton between January, 1998 and February, 1999. Despite
all the controversy and massive information exposure to mostly unflattering news about Mr.
Clinton; the public, in nearly all major opinion polls expressed their wish that Mr. Clinton
be allowed to complete his second term in the office. The analytical approach is based on
the information entropy theory of Shannon. The model is tested using the data from the
polling archives of ABC/Washington Post. The results are confirmed by the Kendall's 
statistics.

1. Introduction
Free societies attach great importance to public opinion, and rightly so. It's legitimacy is beyond
doubt. The role played by public opinion in the conduct of a modern free state is well known [1]. One
way to find a free society's expression is through opinion polls that are useful in understanding the
public's attitude towards specific issues at a particular point in time.
The rise of mass-media after the 2nd World War made public opinion polls almost impossible to
discount. Compared to other democratic societies the public participation in policy formulation has
been relatively higher from the time the U.S. was a young nation. In the early years after the birth of
this nation, the Jeffersonian view of a bottom-up approach had an edge over the top-down decision
making propounded by both Hamilton and Madison. One of the plausible explanations for this edge is
the American Revolutionary War against the British monarchy, which was a rejection of that symbol
of authoritarian control of the affairs of the state. Both the French statesman Tourquiville (in the early
18th century) and the British philosopher Bryce (in the late 18th Century) have widely commented on
the U.S. public participation in policy making. Over time mass education contributed even more to the
notion of participatory citizenry in the governance and public affairs at all levels of society. However,
the contribution of public opinion to policy formulation was more theoretical than empirical. The
middle of 20th Century saw the emergence of the new discipline in of Political Science, armed with
empirical and analytical tools and mass-media based polling techniques as a direct result of rise of
mass-media after the 2nd World War. For the first time, polling techniques could be used to measure
the public's views on policy issues, and ever since then public opinion polls have become a major
player in the states' affairs. However, between the theory of public participation in governance (pre 2nd
world war) and practical tools for measuring its contribution is the almost hidden process of how mass
opinions are formed and how consensus (or lack of it) among the public builds over various issues [2].
Further, once the public reaches a consensus what is the process by which such a consensus is
maintained?
2. Background
In this paper we analyze the public's high job approval rating for President Clinton. Nearly every
major public opinion poll since January 1998 has given the President a job approval rating of near 60%
and above (Figure 1)

Figure 1. President`s job approval rating by selected dates: 1992 to 1999.
Such high ratings are unusual for the following reasons.
· Historically, second term presidents lose their popularity especially when the presidency is already
being branded by the elite as a "lame duck."
· If a presidency has been dogged by one or another scandal from the day of inauguration (the
Whitewater, the travel office, FBI files, the presidential campaign fund controversy, and at least
half a dozen Independent prosecutor investigations against cabinet secretaries). These begin to
take a toll on popularity as individual power and election support attenuates.
· American politics do not allow second acts [3], i.e., if you make a mistake you often pay the price
with your job or at least your popularity.
· Almost no one can retain his/her approval ratings in the face of an unfolding and hence continuous
scandal (Watergate: Nixon's approval rating fell to 31% in August, 1973, a 36% drop in six
months; Irangate: during the Carter presidency, 31% by October, 1979; Iran-Contra during the
Reagan presidency: job approval fell to 43%, a 20% drop by March, 1987; [4].)
· Unlike other scandals the Lewinsky scandal had the recency effect, in the sense it was something
that did not happen a long time ago.
· Unlike other scandals where a president's involvement was at the most circumstantial and
peripheral the Lewinsky scandal offered no such defense.
· It was impossible to ignore the scandal because there was no escape from the multimedia (TV,
newspapers, magazines and internet) exposure and round the clock coverage, most of which was
not flattering to the president.
Entropy 1999, 1 40
Several explanations have been offered to explain the President's continuing high approval rate.
Much has been made of the correlation between good economic times and high approval rating of a
sitting president. In fact this has been used as the main explanatory variable for the president's
popularity, i.e, people feel good about their economic well being and give credit to the President.
Some have talked about scandal weariness among the people. Still others have said that America was
becoming more like Europe where personal indiscretions do not affect the public's view of politicians.
A variation of that has been that, as long as there is no threat to national security people do not mind
the not-so-perfect private lives of their elected officials. Yet others have offered the explanation of
how the partisan tone of the scandal and the seemingly unfair treatment of the president by the
opposition made people sympathetic towards the president. Some have talked about cultural and moral
decline in the society. In short there have been many explanations, possibly each of them has played a
part in giving the president such high job approval. So what is driving such high poll numbers? A
model based on Shannon's information entropy is presented in this paper. The results are tested by the
data from the ABC/Washington Post's polling archives [5] and it's validity is confirmed using
Kendall's  statistics [6].
Opinion polls are snap shots of the public's perception. As stated earlier, every major public
opinion poll between January 1998 and February 1999 gave the president a very high job approval
rating, reflecting the public's perception of his ability to do the work. It was not as if public did not
know about the scandal. One could not have escaped the media coverage of the scandal. So what is
the explanation for giving the president such high approval? Could it be that the public filtered out all
the noise that passed for minute details about the affair and concentrated mainly on the essence of the
story? In other words, once the public realized in the first few days following the January 21st news,
that there were no national security issues, nor any financial mismanagement, the entire story became a
tragedy of human failings. Throughout the following year the basic story remained same. Every new
and so-called breaking news did not seem to add any new information to the public's perception of the
president's behavior.
As far back as the 1992 election, the plurality of the public had ignored the character issue and
voted Clinton into the office in the three-way race. In the following years, as the public became more
aware of many of his private peccadilloes it continued to separate the president's public life from his
personal problems. For example, even after the reinstatement of the Jones lawsuit in May of 1996, the
public seemed to have compartmentalized Clinton's private and public lives [7].
The following section will introduce the main points of information entropy. Section IV tests the
model using archived data from public opinion polls and the results validated using the Kendall's 
statistic. Section V provides the conclusion and suggests the future research.
3. Surprise and Information Entropy
In communication theory, the information content of an event is measured in terms of surprise or
the unexpectedness of the occurrence of such an event [8]. Suppose, a weather forecast for the North-
East U.S. is for light showers on a spring day, and indeed it does rain. Such a forecast has little or no
Entropy 1999, 1 41
information value, since the occurrence of showers during the spring season is expected or is a norm.
Instead if heavy snow is forecast for spring and actually occurs, then such a forecast has more surprise
and hence high information content than the forecast of spring showers. Thus, the information content
of a statement is decided by the degree of surprise or unexpectedness of an event. If an event can
occur in n different ways, then the amount of information obtained is higher when the outcome of the
event is least expected. In other words, the least probable event has the most information. Next, let us
quantify the above explanation in mathematical terms with the help of an example.
Suppose a card is drawn from a randomly shuffled deck of 52 cards then:
1. Event A refers to the drawn card being a spade and the probability of obtaining a card of spade is
p(A) = 13/52 = 1/4. Let I(A) denote the information associated with event A.
2. Event B refers to the drawn card being an ace, and the probability of obtaining an ace is p(B) =
4/52 = 1/13. Let I(B) refer to the information associated with the event B.
3. Event C refers to the drawn card being an ace of spade and the probability of obtaining an ace of
spade is given by the joint probabilities of events A and B and is
p( A  B) = (1/4)*(1/13). And the information associated with the joint events is given by
I(C)= I(A  B).

Obviously, the probability of drawing an ace of spades from a perfectly shuffled deck of cards is
much less than the probability of drawing any ace, which is less than that of drawing a spades, i,e,
p(C) <= p(B) <= p(A). In other words,

Moreover the event of drawing the ace of spades has more surprise (information) than the event of

And the information associated with that event E can never be negative, i.e.,
So what could be the function that will satisfy relations expressed in equations (1) through (4)?
According to Shannon's Information theory [9], the log function will satisfy all of the above relations.
Thus for an event E, a relation of between information I(E) and probability of event E exists:

where, the constant b > 0 is called the base of logarithm. The negative sign helps preserve the non-
negativity property of information (equation (4)). Since probability of an event is bounded between 0
and 1 (equation (3), the logarithm function will hold both for an event that is certain and for an event
that is impossible. When an event is certain (its probability is 1), the information associated with it is
zero. On the other hand, when an event is impossible (its probability is zero), the associated
information is infinite. In the case of an event of drawing an ace of spade the log of joint probability
translates to addition of information of two events, the drawing a spade and the drawing an ace. The
following equations illustrate the information relations for the above example.

The example above satisfies both the logical and algebraic requirements in the computation of
information content.
Next let us consider an event that has n number of possible outcomes defined by a probability
distribution function f(p
i
) over all i=[1, n]. Then what is the average or expected information H of all
of these events? H is computed as follows:

Equation (10) gives the mean or average information associated with an event that is defined in
terms of its probability function f (P). It is also known as the information entropy of the event, an
expression of the degree of randomness in the occurrence of an event. If one does not have an a priori
distribution of the probabilities of an event then using the principle of symmetry [10], one must assume
that the event occurs with uniform distribution of probability [11]. Such probability distributions are
referred to as non-informative because all outcomes are equally possible, and such distributions offer
minimum information or maximum entropy. For example if an event K can occur in n ways then the
probability of each of these outcomes is 1/n and hence the information entropy H
max
is given by:

Equation (11) gives minimum average information or maximum information entropy of the event K.
Suppose, that there is a way to assign a probability distribution because we have information about
how the event K occurs, i.e., we have an alternate probability distribution of event K then the let
information entropy associated with such distribution be, H

H

is computed as follows:

and the organization S is a measure of order or lack of disorder defined as 1 - H

[12 Haynes]. Such
order is introduced due to knowing an alternate probability distribution of event K as opposed to
uniform probability distribution and is computed as follows:

An example due to Jessop [8] will make these ideas a little more clear. The Maximum entropy
associated with the English language with 26 letters and an average of 8 letters per word is 3.296. This
would be equivalent to having a language where all alphabets were equally possible in all 8 letter
words, a language with no patterns in the letters and the words. However, the English language does
exhibit a pattern which makes it intelligible and hence the structured nature of the English language
can be expressed in terms of relative entropy as (2.852/3.296) = 0.865. Using equation (13) one may
obtain a proxy for computing the organization of the English language as = 1- 0.865= 0.135.
In the next section let us apply the concepts of information entropy to the public opinion polls
conducted over a one year period across the nation and its regions, namely the Eastern, the
Midwestern, the Southern and the Western. Using the definition of surprise or unexpectedness, the
concept of maximum entropy, the relative entropy and the order, we can analyze the constancy of the
job approval rating of Mr. Clinton between January 1998 and March 1999 [5].
4. Application of Information Entropy to the Polling Data
Suppose, that as part of public opinion polls an unbiased sample of 100 people are selected and each
one of them is asked to record his/her opinion to the following question:
Do you approve or disapprove of the way the president is doing his job? Of the three select one:
Yes, No, Don't know.
Entropy 1999, 1 44
Before conducting such a poll, the outcomes according to the principle of symmetry can be:1/3rd of
the respondents approve; 1/3rd do not approve and 1/3rd say they don't know. Then the a priori amount
of information entropy or disorder is given by:

But as soon as the public opinion is known then the amount of information entropy or ignorance is
subject to the actual number of people that answered yes, no and don't know. For example, in the 1992
election, Mr. Clinton got 43% of the votes, Mr. Bush got 38% and Mr. Perot got 18%. Then using the
vote percentages as the proxy for expressing the approval of a candidate, the information entropy for
1992 is:

A little improvement is found in equation (15) over the unbiased ignorance of equation (14), since
the public knows a little more about the candidate Clinton. In the four years since 1992, the public
became more informed about Mr. Clinton and the poll numbers for the 1996 presidential elections
reflect the public's approval/disapproval. The following is the breakdown of the percentage of votes
received by each candidate: 49% for Mr. Clinton; 41% for Mr. Dole 41% and 9% for Mr. Perot In
other words, using the same question from the public opinion poll above, these election votes can be
seen as 49% saying Yes, 41% saying No and 9% saying Don't Know. Using this data, we obtain from
equation (11),

Thus by 1996, the information entropy or the lack of ignorance was already down by about ~15%.
After the election and all through 1996 Mr. Clinton continued to get better job approval numbers than
ever before (See Figure 1, based on data [5] and [7]). By the end of 1997, 59% approved of the job he
was doing, the equivalent of information entropy H
1997
of 0.3508, or the ignorance of his handling of
his job was down by about 14% from the 1996 election or down by about 27% from the 1992 election.
Between 1992 and 1997, the Clinton Administration was dogged by one or another kind of scandal. In
spite of such bad publicity, by the end of 1997 enough people knew about Clinton to compartmentalize
his public and private lives. In fact, by normalizing the current entropy level with respect to the 1992
information entropy (H
1992
), the relative entropies of 1996 and 1997 can be computed using equation
(12) as:
H
1996
= 0.85 and H
1997
= 0.73 respectively.
Further, the measure of order or organization in Mr. Clinton's job approval rating by the end of
1997 can be computed from equation (13) and is found to be nearly 0.2647.

Thus even an average R
H
~0.7 with a variance of 0.0011 indicates that the public though not
comfortable with the conduct, did not want Mr. Clinton to be removed from the office. Figure 4 shows
the regional approval data and Figure 5 shows the relative magnitudes of the maximum entropy and
the regional entropies. The East region has the least amount of entropy. The South, the Midwest and
the West regions all converge towards 0.3 and below entropy levels. Similarly, near constant figure
are computed for the polling data by education and by sex. Even the party affiliations data shows a
similar trend, as if there was a lock in among the Democrats and the Independents in favor of the
President, along with a tiny number of Republicans, while nearly 60% of Republicans disapproved of
Clinton's job performance.
Validation of the data using the Kendall's  statistics
Kendall's  statistics [6] measures trends in the time series data that has been collected a
periodically. If the computed statistic is zero or near zero then there is no trend, suggesting a near
constancy of the values in the time series. If the statistics tends to be near +1 then there is an upward
or increasing trend in the time series values and a decreasing or downward trend of the statistic tends
to be near -1. Using data from Figure 1, it was found that the statistic remained nearly zero (a bit
negative) with a value of -0.04762 between January of 1998 and February of 1999, in agreement with
the near constant value of the information entropy and near constant organization factor (See Figure 2).
Between January of 1992 and December of 1994, the  statistic shows a negative value of -0.14296, a
downward trend and between January of 1995 and December of 1997 the  statistic shows a value of
+0.33913, an upward trend. But after the breaking of the story in January 1998 and onwards the
statistics stays steady with near zero value of -0.04762. All of these results agree with the charts
shown in Figures 1 and 2. Similar statistics were computed for the regional data, both for approval and
disapproval numbers. The tables 1 and 2 below show the computed values for approval and
disapproval respectively by the regions.
Table 1. Approval  statistic.
Approval East Midwest South West
Kendall's 
 -0.12 -0.19 0.05 0.08
Table 2. Disapproval  statistic.
Disapproval East Midwest South West
Kendall's 
 -0.16 0.05 -0.16 -0.30
Both the figures in the tables show a lock in of the statistics; only the West has a slightly higher
negative value, which suggests that the disapproval numbers decreased over the time period. The data
in the tables confirms the regional constancy of the information entropy, as shown in Figure 4.

6. Conclusions and Future Research
The information entropy model offers a way to test the public's confidence level in a public figure
despite the controversy surrounding the issues. In democratic societies a majority vote is accepted as a
sign of victory. But in reality, even a super majority may not settle the issues completely. For
example, even a three way vote distribution of 75%, 15% and 10% results in an entropy H = 0.31, or
H
R
= 0.67, a reduction of just 33% from the maximum entropy. It may be interesting to investigate
what level of entropy translates into total acceptance of an issue by the public. The model needs to be
tested on other situations and types of data where there is a vast of number of choices expressed by the
public and adding values or weighs to different opinions. Additionally, the model needs to be
augmented with an opinion formation model. An attempt will be made to integrate the current model
with the one developed by Paelinck [13]. The concept of organization factor S needs to be developed
further and tested. A link between organization factor S and self-organizing systems will be explored.

Gallup pioneered public evaluation of presidents with President Roosevelt in the 1930s. Since
then, the basic question, "Do you approve or disapprove of the way [name of president] is
handling his job as president?" has become the standard in political polling.
