Prior attempts to identify factors associated with physical function (here, major lower body
movements) among African Americans have been constrained by a narrow range of measures,
small sample sizes, or both. The 1992 Health and Retirement Study (HRS) contains a
substantial over-sample of African Americans (649 men and 957 women self-respondents aged
51 to 61 years), and detailed measures of high-risk behaviors, disease prevalence and severity,
impairment, and physical function. We extend the natural history of disease to the natural
history of functional status and model sociodemographic characteristics, high-risk behaviors,
disease prevalence and severity, and impairments as direct and indirect influences on physical
function in this African American sample. This natural history of functional status model fits
the data well for both men (ROC = .88) and women (ROC = .83), although there are gender
differences. Slightly over one-half of the women report some difficulty in physical function,
compared with one-third of the men. Women also have a higher mean body-mass and report a
greater prevalence and severity in 6 of 9 chronic diseases and more pain, but are less likely to
smoke or abuse alcohol than men. Importantly, many of the factors with the largest direct and
indirect associations with difficulty in physical function among these African American men
(alcohol abuse, smoking, body mass, diabetes, heart disease, cerebrovascular disease, arthritis,
and pain) and women (alcohol abuse, body mass, arthritis, and respiratory illness) are all
potentially preventable or manageable.

Detailed information on functional status among
African Americans has rarely been available, and
when it has, sample sizes and/or measures have lim-
ited comparisons of functional status and its model-
ing across African American subgroups (Clark & Mad-
dox, 1992; Johnson & Wolinsky, 1993; Mendes de
Leon et al., 1995; Rogers, Rogers, & Belanger, 1992).
To provide such comparisons across African Ameri-
can subgroups and estimate more complete models
of functional status, there are at least two data re-
quirements. First, a large sample of African Americans
of particular age cohorts is needed so that an age-
specific, if not age- and gender-specific, model or
models can be estimated. Age- and gender-specific
models are necessary because of the potential impact
of selective survival (see Gibson, 1991; Markides &
Mindel, 1987) on parameter estimates within specific
age cohorts, and evidence that chronic diseases may
have gender-specific associations with functional sta-
tus (Johnson & Wolinsky, 1994). Second, to model the
natural history of functional status, detailed measures
of sociodemographic characteristics, health-related
behaviors, disease, impairment, and functional status
are required.

With the availability of the 1992 Health and Retire-
ment Study (Juster & Suzman, n.d.) data on African
Americans aged 51 to 61 years, and an explicit, in-
formed model of the natural history of functional
status, these conditions can be met, including the
estimation of gender-specific models. In addition,
the groundwork for future use of the HRS follow-up
data can be laid. For example, although physical
function is the focus of this article, it represents just
one of a series of health-related quality of life (HRQL)
outcomes (e.g., disability, perceived health, depres-
sion). As data from subsequent waves become avail-
able, the natural history of the functional status
model can be expanded to represent the natural
history of HRQL (e.g., activity of daily living [ADL]
disability, perceived health, and depression). We
focus here on physical function because of recent
evidence that physical function is the entrance point
to a decline in HRQL. Several recent reports have
shown that among older adults, physical function
has a strong positive association with activities of
daily living (ADLs), instrumental ADLs, and perceived
health (Johnson & Wolinsky, 1994; Stump, Clark,
Johnson, & Wolinsky, 1995), and is predictive of ADL
disability onset (Gurnalnik, Ferrucci, Simonsick,
Salive, & Wallace, 1995).
In this article, we specifically refer to self-reports
of some or a lot of difficulty performing any 1 of 8
lower-body functions as some difficulty in physical

function. Our objectives are to use the HRS data to 1)
describe and 2) model sociodemographic, behav-
ioral, chronic disease severity, and impairment fac-
tors associated with physical function among African
American men and women aged 51 to 61 years. Al-
though most studies of health and functional status
among African Americans have included a white
comparison and have been able to show that African
Americans are much more likely to report functional
limitations than whites (Clark & Maddox, 1992; John-
son & Wolinsky, 1994; Mendes de Leon et al., 1995),
we elected not to take such an approach in this
article. Information on physical function and its cor-
relates within African American subgroups can in-
form research and health care policy concerned with
the health of African Americans.
Methods
Model
Our model draws heavily on a model of the natural
history of functional status presented in Johnson and
Wolinsky (1993), but extends that model by incorpo-
rating behavioral factors, disease severity, and im-
pairment. The model hypothesizes that sociodemo-
graphic characteristics affect behavior, that each of
these influence chronic disease prevalence and se-
verity, and all of the preceding factors affect pain and
cognitive and sensory impairment. These factors ulti-
mately affect physical function. Impairment (i.e.,
health problems or feelings not directly observable)
has been excluded from most empirical assessments
of functional status because of a lack of available
measures and data. Although the conceptualization
of impairment focuses on anatomical, physiological,
or psychological dysfunctions as measured through
laboratory data or medical records, self-reports of
symptoms, pain, and sensory deficits can also be
used (Patrick & Bergner, 1990). Measures of cognitive
impairment, pain, and disease-specific symptoms
have just begun to be measured in social and health
surveys (e.g., the Established Populations for the Epi-
demiologic Study of the Elderly; Inouye, Albert,
Mohs, Sun, & Berkman, 1993), and their associations
with sociodemographic, behavioral, chronic disease,
and physical function measures have been minimally
studied. Theoretically, cognitive impairment, pain,
and disease-specific symptoms are an outcome of
sociodemographic and behavioral characteristics, in
addition to disease. Each of these factors has poten-
tially important associations with physical function.
Data
The purpose of the HRS is to provide in-depth data
for the investigation of analytic and policy issues
surrounding the retirement decision. Thus, the age
group selected (ages 51 to 61 years) was intended to
include a majority of persons who had not yet retired
but who would likely retire in the coming years. Due
to the intricate relationship between health (physi-
cal, cognitive, and emotional) and retirement, exten-
sive information was collected not only on income,
wealth, and occupational demands and histories, but
on health as well. An over-sample (2:1) of census
tracts containing a high proportion of African Ameri-
cans or Hispanics reflects the fact that these popula-
tions make up an ever-growing segment of the labor
force, and that data on minority health and retire-
ment is inadequate.
The study screened approximately 70,000 house-
holds to identify age-eligible respondents (aged 51 to
61 years). All age-eligible persons living in the se-
lected households were interviewed. All spouses
were included in the study regardless of age because
of the frequency of dual-earner couples and the
influence of spouses in the retirement decision pro-
cess. Thus, the HRS includes data on 2,912 persons
either younger than 51 or older than 61 years of age.
These persons were excluded from the analyses pre-
sented here. By the most conservative criteria, the
overall response rate was 82%, and comparisons to
1990 census data provide no indication of sample
bias. Due to the subjective nature of physical func-
tion assessments, our analyses use self-respondents
only, who comprise 95% of the HRS. There are 1,590
self-respondents who identified themselves as pri-
marily African American or black; 642 men and 948
women. Because all African American respondents
had the same probability of selection, the HRS sam-
ple weights were not used. The Beta release version
of the HRS baseline data was used.
Measures
The distributions and coding algorithms of each
measure used in the analyses are presented by sex in
Table 1. We will not review every measure, but in-
stead highlight coding algorithms that may not be
apparent by looking over Table 1. Behavioral variables
include the "cut down, annoyed, guilty, and eyes
open" alcohol abuse scale (CAGE; Mayfield, McLeod,
& Hall, 1974), smoking status, and body mass index as
a measure of obesity. The CAGE questions are:
1. Have you ever felt that you should cut down on
. your drinking?
2. Have people ever annoyed you by criticizing your
drinking?
3. Have you ever felt bad or guilty about drinking?
4. Have you ever taken a drink first thing in the
morning to steady your nerves?
Those who do not drink, or drink lightly, score a zero
on the CAGE, and all others receive a value ranging
from 1 to 4 depending on the number of positive
responses to questions about drinking patterns.
Cronbach's alpha for the scale was .75 for men and
.74 for women. For smoking, two measures were
created: the percent who currently smoke (as well as
the percent smoking V2 pack or less and more than V2
pack), and the percent who quit within the last 10
years. Obesity is common among and important to
the health of African American women (Lieberman,
1988), and we assessed its association with physical
function using a set of dummy variables, including
one representing those at or below 90% of ideal
body mass. The calculation of the percentages is
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 323
based on a medically determined ideal (maximized
life expectancy) body mass index of 21.6 for women
and 21.2 for men.
IntheHRS, several questions were used to provide
an indication of the extent and severity of major
diseases. This is important because indicators of the
prevalence of disease alone do not provide informa-
tion on how the disease has progressed or been
managed. There are 9 major diseases covered: hy-
pertension, diabetes, cancer, respiratory illness,
heart disease, congestive heart failure, cerebrovas-
cular disease, arthritis, and psychiatric illness. For
each of these, we assigned one point for a self-report
of ever having been diagnosed with the illness, one
point for current treatment for the self-reported ill-
ness, and one point for current symptoms due to the
self-reported illness. The assigned points reflect the
clinical observation that patients receiving treatment
for an illness and currently symptomatic from an
illness would be expected to have more severe dis-
ease than an asymptomatic patient who doesn't re-
quire treatment for control of the self-reported dis-
ease. For hypertension, diabetes, and cancer there
was no question about current symptoms. For diabe-
tes, we assigned an additional point for those with a
greater than 10-year history of the disease because of
the higher prevalence of end-stage organ damage.
Also, for a very small number of patients (n = 24), the
use of both insulin and oral hypoglycemic agents
were reported. Therefore, we allowed one point for
each of these treatments. For respiratory illness, we
assigned an additional point for those reporting limi-
tations in activities in addition to current symptoms
due to respiratory illness. Finally, for heart disease,
we assigned an additional point for those reporting a
history of cardiac surgery. Thus, each condition had
a severity range of either 0-2 (hypertension and can-
cer only), 0-3, or 0-4. We did not tabulate the nine
chronic disease severity scales into a single measure
of comorbidity; rather, the severity scores are
treated as individual variables as described later. In
this manner we are assigning severity within disease
category, but we do not necessarily equate a point
given for one condition with a point given for an-
other condition.
We incorporate non-disease-specific pain reports
because of their likely, but understudied, impact on
physical function. We are able to use ratings of the
severity of pain most of the time and when at its
worst. A recent review of experiments investigating
the reporting of chronic pain on health surveys con-
cluded that pain recall is quite reliable (Salovey et al.,
1992). Sensory and cognitive impairment measures
have also been included. We have used immediate
and delayed word recall, an abstract thinking score,
and self-rated memory questions as indicators of
cognitive impairment, which has been shown to be
more prevalent among young and old African Ameri-
cans compared to whites (Callahan, Hendrie, & Tier-
ney, 1995). The immediate and delayed word recall
tests were conducted by giving respondents a list of
20 common words and asking them to recall as many
as possible. Somewhat later in the interview, the
respondents were again asked how many words they
were able to recall. Valid immediate and delayed
recall scores range from 0 to 20. Twelve percent of
the respondents did not have a delayed word recall
score. The average difference between immediate
and delayed word recall was 2.3 words, so we as-
signed those with missing data on delayed recall a
score of 2.3 less than their immediate word recall
score. Three percent of the respondents did not have
an immediate word recall score, and were excluded
from our models of difficulty in physical function.
Abstract thinking is a cognitive domain that captures
respondents' ability to identify relationships be-
tween concepts. Thirteen percent were missing a
score on abstract thinking, and we assigned these
individuals the mean score. To assess the impact of
this imputation process for delayed word recall and
abstract thinking on our estimates, we ran our
models without the imputed scores. The results from
those models did not differ from what we report
later. Self-rated memory, as well as vision and audi-
tory acuity, are based on reports of excellent, very
good, good, fair, and poor, which we recoded to fair
or poor reports versus all others. Vision and auditory
ratings are with the use of glasses, contacts, or hear-
ing aid.
Our dependent variable, physical function, was
created out of questions of difficulty with body
movements. Johnson and Wolinsky (1993) have
shown that both an upper and lower body dimension
of body movement may exist, but our interest is in
the lower body dimension, because of its strong
association with perceived health, depression, mor-
tality, and health care utilization (Guralnik et al.,
1995; Stump et al., 1995). Self-reports of ability in
physical function items such as walking and climbing
stairs "have been shown to be valid in comparisons
with direct, standardized observations of perfor-
mance on these tasks" (Guralnik et al., 1995, p. 557).
The eight items were walk several blocks, walk 1
block, walk across a room, climb several flights of
stairs, climb 1 flight of stairs, carry 10 pounds, push
or pull a heavy object, and one question about diffi-
culty stooping, crouching, or kneeling. Based on our
interest in modeling significant limitation, respon-
dents who reported no or a little difficulty on an item
were coded 0, and those who reported some or a lot
of difficulty on an item, or who reported that they
cannot or do not do the movement, were coded 1.
Factor analysis of eight items that have primarily
lower body requirements, but are not traditional
activity of daily living items, yielded one factor with
loadings ranging from .66 to .86 for both men and
women. Cronbach's alpha for the eight physical
function items was .92 for men and .91 for women.
For our multivariate models, we dichotomized the
physical function measure by separating those with
difficulty on at least 1 item from those with no diffi-
culty on any of the items.
Analyses
In the presentation of results, we discuss rates of
high-risk behaviors and diseases, which are shown in
324 The Gerontologist
Table 1, and we discuss differences in those rates for
men and women, which are assessed using the Chi-
square or t-test as appropriate. We then discuss the
results of logistic regression models intended to as-
sess associations between the sets of independent
variables (e.g., sociodemographic, behavioral, dis-
ease, and impairment) and the existence of some
difficulty in physical function. This is done in order to
reflect the causal sequencing of the natural history of
functional status and to capture any decomposition
of distal effects. We do this by estimating a series of
logistic regression models. Following the first model,
each model in the series incorporates the next con-
ceptually relevant set of independent variables.
Results
The presentation of data in Table 1 follows our
model of functional status; sociodemographic char-
acteristics, followed by high-risk behaviors, disease
prevalence and severity, impairments, and finally,
physical function. Much of the data presented in
Table 1 has not been available on African American
adults, and there are some interesting results con-
tained in that table. Women were more likely to be
married than men and were less likely to be in the
lowest education category. With regard to high-risk
behaviors, the CAGE scores indicate that as much as
1/3 of the men have responses considered to be
suggestive of alcohol abuse at some point in their
lives (score of greater than 2). It is also important to
point out that the prevalence of cigarette smoking is
at 40% for men and 24% for women. One-half of the
men who smoke are smoking more than V2 pack per
day. Distributions on the percent of ideal body mass
indicate that nearly 2 out of 5 women are above 140%
of their ideal body mass (obese), and more than 3 out
of 5 are above 120%. In contrast, 1 out of 4 men are
above 140% of their ideal body-mass.
Chronic disease affected a majority of respon-
dents; 73% of men and 82% of women reported at
least 1 chronic disease. Among the chronic diseases,
the most prevalent, by far, was hypertension. One-
half of the men and 3 out of 5 women reported
having ever been told they have hypertension. One
out of 3 men and a little more than 2 out of 5 women
reported currently taking medication for hyperten-
sion. Arthritis is the next most common condition,
with 32% of men and 48% of women reporting having
ever been told they have arthritis. Nearly as many
reported joint symptoms associated with arthritis,
but only 13% of men and 22% of women report
taking medication for their arthritis. Diabetes and
heart disease are evident in 15 to 19% of the sample.
Women were more likely than men to have ever
been diagnosed with hypertension, diabetes, can-
cer, respiratory illness, psychiatric illness, and arthri-
tis, while men were more likely to have ever been
diagnosed with congestive heart failure and cerebro-
vascular disease.
Among impairments, women reported greater
daily pain and greater severity of pain when at its
worst. Interestingly, women were more likely than
men to self-rate their thinking ability as fair or poor,
but they scored equally well on the objective tests of
immediate word recall, delayed recall, and abstract
thinking. Finally, women were much more likely to
report difficulty with physical function. One-half
(51.6%) of the African American women reported
some difficulty in physical function, whereas one-
third (33.5%) of the African American men reported
some difficulty.
Tables 2 and 3 present the odds ratios for some
difficulty in physical function obtained when so-
ciodemographic, behavioral, disease severity, and
impairment indicators were included in a logistic
regression model for men (Table 2) and women (Ta-
ble 3). The first of four models included sociodemo-
graphic characteristics only, with each subsequent
model incorporating the next relevant block of vari-
ables. Model 1 of Table 2 shows that, among men,
being married and having greater education were
negatively associated with reports of some difficulty
in physical function. Men who were married were
two-thirds as likely as men who were not married to
report some difficulty. Each year of completed
schooling was associated with a 13% lower probabil-
ity of reporting some difficulty.
Among men, the incorporation of behavioral mea-
sures (cigarette and alcohol abuse scores and per-
cent of ideal body-mass) in Model 2 did not change
the association of education, and the association of
being married was reduced only slightly. The behav-
ioral measures associated with some difficulty in
physical function were the alcohol abuse score, cur-
rently smoking, having stopped smoking in the last
10 years, being at or below 90% of ideal body mass,
and being at or above 160% of ideal body mass. Net
of other variables in the model, each additional point
on the alcohol abuse score was associated with a 25%
greater likelihood of reporting difficulty in physical
function. Currently smoking was marginally signifi-
cant (those who currently smoke were 50% more
likely to report some difficulty), as was having
stopped smoking in the last 10 years. Being at or
below 90% of ideal body mass was strongly associ-
ated with reports of some difficulty, and being at or
above 160% of ideal body-mass was associated with a
160% greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty
in physical function among men. Note, however,
that the confidence interval around the estimate for
those at or below 90% is very large due to the small
percent of respondents in this category.
Model 3 shows the results obtained when severity
scores for hypertension, diabetes, cancer, respira-
tory illness, heart disease, congestive heart failure,
cerebrovascular disease, psychiatric illness, and ar-
thritis were incorporated. The incorporation of these
disease scores did not change the net effect of edu-
cation, but being married, the alcohol abuse score,
currently smoking, and having stopped smoking in
the last 10 years were no longer significant. Similarly,
the highest obesity category was no longer signifi-
cant. Marriage, smoking, alcohol abuse, and obesity
all appear to have been associated with reports of
some difficulty in physical function in part because of

their association with chronic disease severity. With
the exception of hypertension and congestive heart
failure, each of the disease scores was associated
with a greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty.
Because all patients with congestive heart failure
would also have heart disease, difficulty in physical
function associated with congestive heart failure may
be explained by the heart disease score.
Model 4 shows results from the incorporation of
each of the pain, cognitive, and sensory impairment
measures. The incorporation of these measures
slightly changed the net association of education,
which was no longer significant. Also, the net associ-
ations of two of the disease scores were no longer
significant. Cancer and respiratory illness were no
longer associated with reports of difficulty in physi-
cal function, and the net associations of the psychiat-
ric and arthritis scores were reduced by 20 to 25%.
Thus, as expected, disease scores were associated
with reports of some difficulty in part because of
their association with impairment. The only impair-
ment measures that reached significance among
men were severity of pain when at its worst and
abstract thinking, which was marginally significant.
Net of sociodemographic, behavioral, disease sever-
ity, and other impairment measures, each additional
point on the pain severity score was associated with a
235% greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty
in physical function. Thus, those who reported se-
vere pain were considerably more likely to report
some difficulty than those who reported no pain. To
summarize, the variables with significant net associa-
tions in the final model for men were diabetes, heart,
cerebrovascular, psychiatric, and arthritis disease se-
verity scores, pain when at its worst, and abstract
thinking. The area under the receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curve in this final model was .88. The

was quite acceptable and indicated that the model
fits well within each decile of risk.
Table 3 presents the results of the logistic regres-
sion of some difficulty among women. Again, Model
1 examines associations between sociodemographic
characteristics and some difficulty in physical func-
tion. For women, education had a significant net
association with a report of some difficulty in physi-
cal function, but marital status did not. Each year of
completed schooling was associated with a 13%
lower likelihood of reporting some difficulty in phys-
ical function.
Model 2 presents the association of both sociode-
mographic and behavioral indicators with some diffi-
culty in physical function. The net association of
education remained essentially unchanged, and al-
cohol abuse and each category of obesity over 120%
had significant associations with some difficulty. Be-
ing at or below 90% of ideal body mass was strongly
associated with some difficulty. Each additional point
on the alcohol abuse score was associated with a 40%
greater likelihood of reporting some difficulty, and
the obesity categories of 121 to 140,141 to 160, and
160% or more were associated with a 54, 77, and
333% greater likelihood of difficulty, respectively,
relative to those between 91 and 120% of their ideal
body mass. Interestingly, smoking had no associa-
tion with some difficulty among women.
The results of the incorporation of disease scores
is shown in Model 3. The significant net associations
of education, and the highest and lowest ideal body
mass categories remain significant, though some-
what reduced. The disease scores with a significant
net association with reports of some difficulty were
hypertension, respiratory illness, heart disease, psy-
chiatric illness, and arthritis. Cerebrovascular dis-
ease had a very marginal association. An additional
point on these disease severity measures was associ-
ated with between a 24 and 77% greater likelihood of
reporting difficulty.
Results from the inclusion of impairment measures
is shown in Model 4. Again, the net associations of
the highest and lowest ideal body mass categories
were significant. Education, however, was not. Thus,
considering the slightly reduced associations of obe-
sity noted in Model 3, obesity's association with

some difficulty appears to be due in part to its associ-
ation with disease severity, but not impairment. The
net association of education, on the other hand,
appears to be due in part to its association with
health behaviors, disease severity, and impairment.
The associations of the disease severity scores were
changed somewhat with the inclusion of impairment
measures, and of the 5 severity scores that were
significant in Model 3, only the respiratory illness
and arthritis disease scores remain significant in
Model 4. Unlike the models for men, severity of pain
when at its worst did not have a significant net associ-
ation with reports of some difficulty, but immediate
word recall scores did have significant net associa-
tions. Thus, the final model of some difficulty in
physical function for women included highest and
lowest ideal body mass categories, severity scores
for respiratory illness and arthritis, and immediate
word recall scores. The area under the ROC curve for
this final model was .83, and the HL goodness-of-fit
was more than acceptable. The model did underesti-
mate difficulty in the fourth, fifth, and sixth deciles
by 10 to 20%, however, and overestimated difficulty
by 10% in the eighth decile of risk.
Discussion
The data and analyses presented in this article
provide important, preliminary information for those
concerned with the health of African American men
and women. Data in this detail have not been avail-
able for African Americans of any age, and 51 to 61 is
an important age group because this is an age when
many chronic diseases and limitations begin to sur-
face. In light of this, a number of the findings warrant
further consideration, including gender differences
and similarities in both the prevalence data and the
model estimates.
As expected (see Clark & Maddox, 1992), the mean
education level is less than high school among this
age cohort of African Americans. The rate of high-
risk behaviors is of particular concern. The rate of
smoking is high and a potential target for interven-
tion among this cohort (40% for men and 24% for
women), as is evidence of alcohol abuse among men
and obesity among women. Alcohol abuse can exac-
erbate existing conditions through noncompliance,
and is associated with trauma and social dislocation
(e.g., job loss). Obesity is a risk factor for a full range
Vol.36, No. 3,1996 329
of chronic diseases, including heart disease, diabe-
tes, congestive heart failure, and arthritis, and can
also have a direct effect on physical function. In light
of the prevalence and importance of smoking, alco-
hol abuse, and obesity, further efforts to understand
and manage these risks among African Americans
should be a primary public health goal.
There has been much controversy over the impact
of being "very thin" (measured here as less than 90%
of ideal body mass), but a recent study (Manson et
al., 1995) and companion editorial (Byers, 1995) con-
cluded that there is little evidence of harm in being
very thin. We found a substantial and direct effect of
being very thin on difficulty in physical function
among males and females, but the confidence inter-
vals around these estimates were very large.
Despite gender differences in the factors found to
have direct associations with physical function, the
fit of the final model was quite good for both men
and women (ROC = .88 for men and .83 for women).
Sample size has been a concern in previous studies
of older African Americans, particularly sample sizes
for older African American men. Sample size was a
concern for the analyses of the present article as
well, despite the availability of 600 men. The rela-
tively low rate of difficulty in physical function
among men leads to some concern for logistic re-
gression models that depend on a large number of
events (i.e., difficulty in physical function). We are
confident in the results of the final model for men,
however, because Model 3 of Table 2 includes 19
variables as opposed to the 27 of Model 4, and has an
ROC of .85.
There are also several other potential limitations
that must be considered. First, because these analy-
ses use cross-sectional data, contentions about
cause and effect regarding the independent variables
in these models and difficulty in physical function are
not appropriate. Accordingly, we have been cautious
to report our findings as associational and note that
some of the independent variables used here (e.g.,
psychiatric illness) deserve particular attention in the
future due to their likely reciprocal association with
physical function. Other factors need to be incorpo-
rated into the model, such as income, labor force
status, and physical activity. This was not possible
here with cross-sectional data because of the expec-
tation that these factors will both affect and be af-
fected by physical function. Extension of the model
to further outcomes (e.g., ADLs, perceived health,
and depression) also deserves attention as the longi-
tudinal data become available.
Second, although the existence of difficulty in
physical function has been modeled here, extent of
difficulty in physical function has not. In preliminary
analyses on the extent of difficulty for men and
women, it was found that the same model presented
here accounted for 46% of the variance in extent of
difficulty among women, but only 23% of the vari-
ance among men. Those analyses identified only two
factors associated with extent of difficulty among
men. In light of this, and the possible impact of work-
or trauma-related disability among men, future work
needs to consider the role of employment status,
occupational demands, and job history in models of
extent of difficulty in physical function. Furthermore,
it is likely that estimation of the extent of difficulty
would be more dependent on an accurate measure
of severity of chronic disease than would the exist-
ence of difficulty. For example, a myocardial infarc-
tion as a manifestation of heart disease, or a stroke as
a manifestation of cerebrovascular disease, would be
expected to have an immediate and direct impact on
physical function. Some myocardial infarctions or
strokes would cause mild symptoms, however,
whereas others could cause patients to become con-
fined to a bed or chair. Thus, specification of the
severity of disease would be expected to be more
important to modeling extent of difficulty as com-
pared to the presence or absence of difficulty.
Third, there are a number of issues yet to be
addressed with the disease severity score. The as-
signment of scores, although unique, is admittedly
arbitrary. Alternative assignments and scoring al-
gorithms are certainly possible. Also, the predictive
validity of the scores has not been established. With
the availability of follow-up data, the ability of the
scores to predict adverse events and health service
utilization can be established.
Despite these limitations, the model of the natural
history of physical function appears to fit these data
very well. The presence of some difficulty in physical
function is differentiated quite well by the factors of
the model. Each set of factors added a critical compo-
nent to the model. The most notable increment to
the fit of the models came with the incorporation of
the disease severity scores. In analyses not shown,
we estimated Model 3 of Tables 2 and 3 using individ-
ual disease prevalence indicators in place of the
disease severity scores. At .69, the ROC curves for
these models were considerably lower than those
shown in Tables 2 and 3 (.85 for men and .78 for
women). Furthermore, only 2 of the disease preva-
lence indicators were significant among men and
none was significant among women. Thus, the dis-
ease severity scores incorporated into the model of
this article appear to represent a considerable ad-
vancement over traditional disease summation and
individual disease prevalence indicators.
Ultimately, the most important issue regarding any
conceptual model of functional status is whether the
model can inform decisions about prevention and/or
management of functional impairment. Most of the
factors with the largest direct and indirect associa-
tions with difficulty in physical function among these
African American men and women are potentially
preventable (e.g., obesity, alcohol abuse, heart dis-
ease, respiratory illness) or manageable (e.g., pain,
diabetes, arthritis). We conclude, therefore, that fur-
thering and supporting current efforts to understand
the social, behavioral, and medical causes of these
factors within the African American population will
likely have considerable public health impact. Effec-
tively implemented, this information could lead to
significant improvements in physical function within
the older African American population. Given the

limitation (Schneider & Guralnik, 1990), such efforts
would benefit the U.S. population as a whole.
