Objectives: To estimate the prevalence of work related asthma and work related wheezing in United
States workers. To identify high risk industries that could be targeted for future intervention. To deter-
mine the population attributable risk of work related asthma and work related wheezing.
Methods: The third national health and nutrition examination survey, 1988­1994 (NHANES III) was
analyzed to determine the prevalence of work related asthma and wheezing and to identify initially
defined industries at risk among United States workers aged 20 and older. Separate logistic models
were developed with work related asthma and work related wheezing as outcomes. Work related
asthma was defined as affirmative response to questions on self reported physician diagnosed asthma
and work related symptoms of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma. Work related wheezing was defined
as affirmative response to questions on self reported wheezing or whistling in the chest in the previous
12 months and work related symptoms of rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and asthma. All analyses were
adjusted for age, sex, smoking, and atopy.
Results: The prevalence of work related asthma was 3.70% (95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.88
to 4.52) and the prevalence of work related wheezing was 11.46% (95% CI 9.87 to 13.05). The main
industries identified at risk of work related asthma and wheeze included the entertainment industry;
agriculture, forestry, and fishing; construction; electrical machinery; repair services; and lodging
places. The population attributable risk for work related asthma was 36.5% and work related wheez-
ing was 28.5%.
Conclusions: The findings provide impetus for further research and actions by public health
professionals which prioritise occupational asthma on the public health agenda. Future intervention
strategies need to be developed for effective control and prevention of asthma in the workplace.
Occupational asthma (OA) presently is the most often
reported diagnosis of work related occupational respi-
ratory disease in developed nations, and over 250
workplace agents have been identified as specific causes of
OA.1 The national occupational exposure survey (1980­2)
estimated that about 24% of the total workforce, employed in
the United States industries, was exposed to occupational
asthmagens.2 In the United Kingdom surveillance of work
related and occupational respiratory diseases (SWORD)
project, OA accounted for 26% of reported occupational lung
disease,3 whereas in British Columbia, OA made up 52% of
reported occupational lung disease.4 Gannon et al reported an
annual incidence of OA of 43/million among workers in the
West Midlands region in the United Kingdom.5 It is estimated
that, in the United States, there are over 20 million workers
potentially exposed to occupational asthmagens; 9 million of
these are exposed to established sensitisers and irritants.6
Estimates of the proportion of asthma that is attributed to
workplace exposures vary widely, probably due to several fac-
tors, including lack of recognition of occupational factors,7 a
general absence of statewide surveillance systems for
asthma,8 variations in the case definitions for OA, and differ-
ences among denominator populations. Thus, anywhere from
2% to 36% of all adult asthma has been attributed to OA, both
in the United States and other developed nations.7 9­12 In a
recent review of 43 attributable risk estimates, Blanc and
Toren13 found the median (range) value for attributable risk of
occupationally related asthma to be 9% (2%­33%).
Certain occupational groups are known to be at particularly
high risk of developing OA, including western red cedar
workers,1 chemical workers exposed to isocyanate,14 construc-
tion workers,15 bakers, and cleaners,16 textile workers,17 animal
handlers,18 and healthcare workers.19
However, to our knowledge, no national estimates of the
association between asthma and asthmatic symptoms with
industry are available in the United States. The national health
and nutrition examination survey (NHANES) provides a rich
population based dataset to identify high risk industries. This
study analysed data gathered from the third NHANES
(NHANES III) to estimate the prevalence of work related
asthma and wheezing, describe workers at high risk of devel-
oping asthma and asthma-like symptoms, and identify high
risk industries that could be targeted for future intervention.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
The NHANES III was conducted in 1988­94, by the National
Center for Health Statistics, to collect data on the health and
nutrition of a representative sample of the non-institutionalised
United States population. Detailed descriptions of the sampling
strategy have been described elsewhere.20 Briefly stated, a
stratified cluster sampling design was used to gather
information on the health of about 40 000 Americans, aged 2
months and older with no preset upper age limit.

Definitions of variables
Due to the variable nature of asthma and in the absence of any
gold standard, diagnosis of asthma and OA becomes very dif-
ficult. There were no direct questions asked in the NHANES III
project to assess the proportion of asthma related to workplace
exposure. We therefore constructed two working definitions of
work related asthma: (a) physician diagnosed work related
asthma (work related asthma), based on responses in the
affirmative to both questions, "has a doctor ever told you that
you had asthma?" (Question HAC1E) and "are any of the
symptoms wheezing, whistling, stuffy, itchy, or runny nose,
watery, itchy eyes brought on by work environment?" (Hereby
referred to as work related conjunctivits, rhinitis, or asthma;
question HAL14D); and (b) symptom based on work related
asthma (work related wheezing), based on those who
responded in the affirmative to both questions, "have you had
wheezing or whistling in your chest at any time in the past 12
months? (item HAL6)" and "are any of the symptoms: wheez-
ing, whistling, stuffy, itchy, or runny nose, watery, itchy eyes
brought on by work environment? (item HAL14D)".
Based on the response to the question on work related
conjunctivits, rhinitis, or asthma (item HAL14D), a subset of
10 391 subjects from the NHANES III dataset was selected.
People who responded that they were not working at the time of
interview (n=3564) were excluded, leaving the total sample
size of 6827. The variable used to define work related asthma
was created by combining only those subjects who responded in
the affirmative (n=188) and in the negative (n=4834) to both
HAC1E and HAL14D for the total sample of 5022. A similar
concordant pair approach was used to define work related
wheezing and yielded a sample of 4573, which was included in
the final analysis. Thus, the final sample included 188 cases of
work related asthma and 454 cases of work related wheezing.
Other variables included in the analysis were atopy (defined
as an affirmative response to the question "has a doctor ever
told you that you had hay fever?"), smoking (non-smokers,
past smokers, and current smokers), race or ethnicity
(non-hispanic whites, non-hispanic blacks, Mexican-
Americans, and other), and poverty income ratio (below pov-
erty level, above poverty level). The poverty income ratio was
computed as a ratio of the annual family income as the
numerator and the poverty threshold, the age of the family
reference person, and the calendar year in which the family
was interviewed as the denominator.
Definition of industry categories
The NHANES III questionnaire included a comprehensive
section on occupational history. Questions related to the longest
industry in which the person worked (item HAS19R) were
asked of all adult study subjects interviewed during the survey.
The longest industry of work was defined as, "what kind of
business or industry did you work in the longest time?"
Originally, industrial categories were classified based on catego-
ries defined by the 1980 United States Bureau of the Census.21
The longest held industry information was available for 6557
(96.04%) eligible subjects. Among the cases with work related
asthma, occupational history was available for 185 (98%)
subjects and among those with work related wheezing, occupa-
tional history was available for 438 (96.5%) subjects.
In the NHANES III dataset, longest worked industrial
categories were originally aggregated into 44 industrial sets.
In this study these were further collapsed into 28 based on

review by an industrial hygienist (table 1) to have an optimal
number of observations in each industrial group for meaning-
ful statistical analysis. The industrial hygienist was blinded to
the subject's asthma status.
A referent industry category was defined at the outset. Ref-
erent categories were constructed by collapsing industry
categories where the potential of exposure to asthmagens
were minimal and included "banking and other finance"
(code 29); "insurance and real estate" (code 30); "social serv-
ices" (code 41); and "public administration, except justice,
public order, and safety" (code 44)". All other industries, not
included in the referent category, were considered to be at risk.
Statistical analysis
Due to the complex multistage survey design used in the
NHANES III, STATA statistical software (STATA, College
Station, TX), which allows incorporation of sampling weights,
strata, and primary sampling units, was used to analyze the
data. The sampling weights include adjustments for non-
response and unequal probability of selection used in the
sampling design. Simple descriptive statistics were used to
describe the study population and calculate the prevalences,
expressed as percentages, of work related asthma and wheeze,
followed by multivariate logistic regression analysis to explore
the association between each industry group and the outcome
variable. All odds ratios (ORs) calculated were initially
adjusted for age, sex, race or ethnicity, poverty income ratio,
atopy, and smoking. However, addition of race or ethnicity and
poverty income ratio in the model did not change the OR sig-
nificantly and were removed from the final analysis to keep
the model simple.
The population attributable risk (PAR) was calculated sepa-
rately for work related asthma and work related wheezing
using the following formula:
PAR= Pe (OR-1)/OR
where Pe=prevalence of exposure among cases (industrial
categories was used as a surrogate measure of exposure);
OR=ORs for at risk industries. The ORs were adjusted for age,
sex, atopy, and smoking. For calculation of PAR, the initially
defined referent category was used as a low risk industrial
category and all other industrial groups were categorised as at
risk industries (table 1).
RESULTS
Table 2 shows the general demographic characteristics of the
study population. The estimated prevalences of work related
asthma and work related wheezing were 3.7% and 11.5%
respectively. The prevalence of atopy was highest in the age
group 30­49. When restricted to the age group 20 to 44 years,
the prevalence rates of work related asthma and wheeze did
not change significantly (3.8% and 13% respectively, table 3).
The overall prevalence of medically diagnosed asthma, wheez-
ing, and work related symptoms of wheezing, conjunctivitis,
rhinitis, and asthma are shown in table 3. Table 4 shows
prevalence of work related asthma and wheeze by selected
characteristics. Atopic people have a higher prevalence of work
related asthma and wheeze than non-atopic people. Current
smokers have a higher prevalence of work related wheeze than
non-smokers and ex-smokers. However, no differences were
found for work related asthma.
Risk of work related asthma by industry
Table 5 presents a summary of risk of work related asthma.
There were considerable variations in risk by industry. The
prevalence and ORs of association with work related asthma
were only significantly increased for the entertainment indus-
try (OR 5.96, 95% CI 1.58 to 22.45). However, a greater than
two-fold increase in risk was found for agriculture, forestry
and fishing; rubber, plastics, and leather products; lumber and
wood products; electrical machinery; transportation equip-
ment and trucking; wholesale trade; repair services; health
related services; educational services; and justice, public order,
and safety industries.
Risk of work related wheezing by industry
The estimated prevalence and ORs of wheezing were signifi-
cantly increased for five industries (table 6). These included
agriculture, forestry and fishing (OR 2.67, 95% CI 1.44 to 4.97);
construction (OR 3.11, 95% CI 1.49 to 6.47); electrical machin-
ery (OR 2.25, 95% CI 1.02 to 4.95); repair services (OR 3.35, 95%
CI 1.35 to 8.33); and lodging places (OR 4.10, 95% CI 1.39 to
12.114). The odds of association with work related wheezing

only three cases.
Population attributable risk
There were 185 cases of work related asthma and 437 cases of
work related wheezing identified with occupational history. Of
the 185 cases of work related asthma, 163 (89.45%) worked in
the at risk industries. Among the 437 cases of work related

were 1.69 (95% CI 0.74 to 3.88) for work related asthma and
1.46 (95% CI 0.95 to 2.26) for work related wheezing. The PAR
estimated by industry was 36.5% for work related asthma and
28.5% for work related wheezing.
DISCUSSION
This study analyzed the data from the NHANES III to
determine the prevalence and risk factors of work related
asthma and work related wheezing and to define industries at
risk in the adult United States population.
There were certain limitations in this study. The working
definitions of work related asthma and work related wheezing
used in this study, have not previously been validated. For sev-
eral industries, we were not able to assess the risk reliably, as
indicated by wide 95% CIs, due to few cases. It is possible that
workers self selected themselves out of the industries where
exposures may worsen their asthmatic symptoms. This healthy
worker effect is a common problem in all cross sectional epide-
miological studies. We tried to minimise this effect by using
longest industry worked in our analysis. There were about 3500
subjects who, in response to the question on work related con-
junctivitis, rhinitis, and asthma (item HAL14D), reported that
they were not working at the time of interview. Further analy-
sis of these subjects indicated that a high proportion of them
reported medically diagnosed asthma and wheezing. It is possi-
ble that these subjects left their job or stopped working because
of their asthma and represent serious cases, which would have
resulted in an underestimation of the prevalence of work related
asthma and wheezing in this analysis. Many comparisons were
made in our analysis; therefore it is possible that some of our
results may have been due to chance alone. There is a paucity of
empirical research in which analysis has been by industrial
group, which limited our comparisons with the literature. Our
analysis was limited to use of the self reported industrial group,
collapsed into categories, and was used as a surrogate measure
of workplace exposure. This further limited our ability to com-
pare directly the findings with others reported in the literature
for certain industrial groups. Finally, the definition used for
atopy may have also led to some misclassification, as some
atopic people may not have had symptoms of hay fever. Given
the strength of the association found, however, between this
measure of atopy and both work related asthma and work
related wheezing, the influence of this misclassification is likely
to have been small.
The prevalence of work related asthma was 3.7%, whereas
11.5% of survey respondents reported work related wheeze.
These rates are within the wide range reported in various
countries.3 7 9­11 22 The PAR estimates were 36.5% for work
related asthma and 27% for work related wheezing, suggest-
ing that an estimated 27%­37% of cases of work related
asthma and wheezing in the NHANES III adult study popula-
tion would have been prevented if exposures encountered in
the at risk industries were eliminated, assuming that the
exposure is causally related to the disease. These figures are
within the range reported in earlier population based
studies,7 12 13 but higher than those reported in studies from
various other industrialised countries.22­24 Blanc and Toren,13 in
a recent review of 43 attributable risk estimates from various
countries, found that the estimates of attributable risk of
asthma due to occupational exposures varied from 2% to 33%
(median, 15% in high quality studies).
The higher estimates of PAR found in our analysis could be
due to several reasons, including differences in study popula-
tion and case definitions used to define work related asthma
or the approach used to classify industries. Alternately, the
lower PAR reported in other countries may reflect true differ-
ences in industrial and occupational exposures encountered in
those regions.
This study identified several industrial groups that were
associated with work related asthma and work related wheez-
ing. An increased risk of work related asthma or work related
wheezing was found in agriculture, forestry and fishing;
entertainment industry; educational services; construction;
textile mill products; electrical machinery, equipment, and
supplies; repair services; and lodging places.
A more than two-fold increased risk of work related asthma
and wheeze was identified for the agriculture, forestry, and

fishing industry. Working in the agriculture sector is
associated with numerous occupational health hazards. This
industrial group includes farmers and poultry workers,
among others, with potential exposures to various respiratory
irritants and potential asthmagens including organic dust,
numerous organic chemicals--for example, insecticides,
biocides, fertilisers--various plant antigens, and various other
chemicals.16 Several studies have reported an increased risk of
asthma and asthmatic symptoms among agriculture workers
including farmers, poultry workers, and grain elevator
workers. Farmers were reported to have a similarly high risk of
asthma in Spain (OR 3.81), New Zealand (OR 4.16), and other
industrialised countries.10 22 Farmers accounted for about half
of reported cases of occupational asthma in Finland in 1990.25
Poultry workers have also been shown to have an increased
risk of work related asthma and asthmatic symptoms26 27 and
significantly lower lung function values.28 Similarly, increases
in the prevalence of asthma have also been reported among
grain elevator workers.29 The consistently increased risk found
among agricultural workers in earlier studies, and the similar
results found in this analysis strongly suggest a causal associ-
ation between agricultural exposures and asthma.
A three-fold increased risk for work related wheezing,but not
work related asthma, was found for the construction industrial
group.Construction is one of the largest industries in the United
States. Workers in the construction industry may be exposed to
increased concentrations of construction dust, wood dust, vari-
ous paints,asphalt,and dust from concrete and masonry,as well
as gases and vapours. Few population based studies have
reported similar associations in this industry17 30; others found
no such association.22 24 It is possible that the risk of asthma
varies within the construction industry and the choice of study
population may in part be responsible for the inconsistency
found in the results. In the construction industry, exposure to
wood dust has been reported to be associated with increased
risk of asthma.31 32 We did not find any association with work
related asthma. This could partly be due to the healthy worker
effect,as subjects with asthma may tend to avoid working in the
dusty trades. Alternately, work related wheezing could be due to
conditions other than asthma--for example, chronic bronchitis
or emphysema. However, we adjusted our analysis for smoking,
which may have diminished the effect if any. Although we did
not find an increased risk for work related asthma, the signifi-
cantly increased risk found with work related wheeze suggests
that workers in the construction industry may be at a greater
risk than reported in earlier studies.
A two-fold increased risk of work related wheeze, but not
work related asthma, in the textile industrial group was found
in this analysis. Workers in a textile industry are potentially
exposed to cotton and other fibre dusts, textile dyes, and fab-
ric printing and treatment chemicals. Textile workers have
often been reported to have an excess risk of asthma.17 23 In a
community based case-control study of risk factors of work
related asthma in different occupational groups in Singapore,
Ng et al17 reported more than a five-fold increased risk of
asthma among textile workers. In a study by Zuskin et al,33
occupational asthma was present among 6% of workers
exposed to textile dye. These same authors, in another study,
reported significant changes in pulmonary function indices
across the shift among synthetic textile workers.34 Some
workers may also have been exposed to cotton dust, which can
cause byssinosis, a condition clinically similar to asthma.
Risk in the industrial group electrical machinery, equip-
ment, and supplies is less well recognised. Our study found a
twofold increase in the risk of work related asthma and
wheezing in this industrial group. The results, however, were
significant only for work related wheeze. The industries
included in this group are involved in processes with potential
for exposure to several irritants and allergens including metal
machining fluids, lubricants, solvents, paints and coatings,
adhesives, soldering fluxes, and various chemicals used in
semiconductor manufacturing. Several case reports have
described the development of occupational asthma from
exposure to fumes generated from soldering flux.35 36 However,
in a cross sectional study of female workers doing manual sol-
dering with flux cored solder wire and using administrative
staff as controls, Lee et al37 did not find any increase in the
prevalence of asthmatic symptoms, nor did they detect any
cases of occupational asthma. Workers with 5 or more years of
experience, however, had a significant reduction in the ratio
between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced vital
capacity (FEV
1
/FVC). McCurdy et al38 in a large cross sectional
survey of semiconductor workers, reported a significantly
increased risk of persistent wheezing among fabrication
workers. Several case reports have described exposures to
adhesives--for example, cyanoacrylates--associated with oc-
cupational asthma.39 40 However, in a large occupational cohort
of 450 workers, exposure to cynacrylates was not found to be
associated with asthma, using FEV
1
/FVC <70% as the
criterion for case definition.41 Although it was not our intent to
comprehensively review all possible exposures that may occur
in the electrical machinery, equipment, and supplies industry,
neither is it possible to determine what the actual individual
exposures were, although we can reason that the potential for
exposure to asthmagens is high in this group, or at least in
subpopulations within the group, and the findings from this
analysis could benefit from additional study.
A strong association between work related asthma and
wheeze and the repair industrial group was found in this analy-
sis. Workers in this industrial group include vehicle mechanics
who are at increased risk of exposures to several agents includ-
ing spray paints, degreasing solvents, and welding fumes. Spray
paints may contain various isocyantes,well known to cause
allergy mediated occupational asthma.30 42 Welding fumes
contain a complex mixture of particulate material and gases
and are strong respiratory irritants. Welders have been shown to
experience an accelerated annual decline in FEV
1
43 which may
possibly lead to permanent respiratory impairment. In a study
by Kogevinas et al,10 welders showed a significantly increased
risk of asthma. Similarly, exposure to welding fumes was asso-
ciated with a two-fold increased risk of asthma among Swedish
workers, consistent with the findings of our study.23 These ear-
lier data, combined with the results from this study, support a
causal association between potential exposures encountered in
this industrial group and asthma.
A four-fold increased odds of association between employ-
ment in the lodging industry with work related wheezing was
found in this analysis. The exposures of concern in the lodging
industry are mostly related to cleaning substances, which
include solvents, sensitisers, and other volatile compounds.
The risk of asthma among cleaners is not well established. In
a study prompted by a case report of occupational asthma in a
detergent industry, Vanhanen et al44 reported a prevalence of
sensitisation to enzymes as 22% among workers exposed to
detergent enzymes. In a prospective study by Nielsen and
Bach,45 female cleaners were found to have high risk of devel-
oping respiratory symptoms. Few population based studies
have reported an increased risk of asthma among cleaners. In
a study by Kogevinas et al10 a greater than two-fold increased
risk of asthma among cleaners was reported. Recently, in a
multicountry population based study, based on the European
Community respiratory health survey, the same authors
reported an increased OR of asthma as high as 4.50 among
cleaners, similar to the results reported in our study. The risk
was consistent across different countries.22 A similar excess
risk of asthma among cleaners was also reported by Ng et al in
Singapore.17 The present evidence in the literature and strong
association found in our study suggests that cleaners are at a
high risk of developing occupational asthma.
This study found more than a five-fold increase in the risk
of work related asthma in the entertainment industry. This
group, which includes artists, designers, and photographers,

has rarely been studied before. It includes workers with
potential exposures to chemicals used in art media, stage set
production, theatrical make up and photographic chemicals.46
In a community based study Forastiere et al47 reported an
increased risk of adult asthma among women in occupations
related to entertainment. Nakano et al48 recently described a
case of occupational asthma resulting from exposure to pyra-
zolone dye used in silver halide photographic paper. Given the
paucity of reports in the literature, our results suggest that this
association could benefit from further studies.
Analysis from this study also found an increased risk of
work related asthma in workers in the educational services.
Asthma among teachers has not been studied before. Teachers
are more likely to be exposed to environmental indoor
allergens, which can be strong risk factors for asthma.49 Alter-
nately, the increased risk found in this analysis could reflect
self selection of subjects with asthma into this occupation.
However, further studies are needed to determine whether the
associations found are real or just a random finding.
In conclusion, findings from this population based study
indicate that several industries are associated with an
increased risk of work related asthma and work related
wheezing and that 27% to 37% of the work related asthma and
wheeze is attributable to selected at risk industrial groups.
Most of the risks in this analysis were consistent with findings
from other population based studies. Our findings provide
impetus for further research and actions which prioritise OA
on the public health agenda.
