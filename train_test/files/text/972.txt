OBJECTIVE: To describe physical activity (PA) and inactivity levels and patterns in Chinese school children (aged 6­18 y).
DESIGN: PA and inactivity were assessed in a youth cohort enrolled in the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) in 1997.
SUBJECTS: A total of 1423 males (11.573.2 y) and 1252 females (11.573.3 y).
MEASUREMENTS: PA and inactivity were assessed by self-reported usual activity (questionnaire). Children under 10 y were
assisted by parents.
RESULTS: Approximately 84% of Chinese youth actively commute to school for a median of 100­150 min/week. A total of
72% engage in in-school moderate/vigorous (MOD/VIG) PA for a median of 90­110 min/week. Relatively few children (E8%)
participate in any MOD/VIG PA outside of school. A total of 72% engage in study-related activities outside of school for a median
of 420 min/week. Only 8% of Chinese school children, regardless of gender, watch television Z2 h/day; less than 1% watch
Z4 h/day. Chores related to housework are not a part of life for Chinese school children; fewer than 20% performed these tasks.
CONCLUSION: Chinese youth are unique compared to those in other developing countries because they do not perform
household chores. Instead, they are under pressure to achieve scholastically. Participation in MOD/VIG PA outside of school is
almost nonexistent. Current television watching habits are relatively low compared to developed countries and walking/biking is
a common form of commuting. The descriptive analysis herein represents the foundation upon which future longitudinal studies
of PA in this population will be based.

Introduction
Within the accelerating worldwide obesity epidemic is a
growing subepidemic of youth classified as overweight and/
or obese.1 This trend is apparent even in developing
countries, where over- and undernutrition can paradoxically
coexist.2 Factors contributing to the epidemic include social
and economic transitions that elicit profound shifts in
nutrition and physical activity (PA).3 In particular, decreased
PA associated with the transition to urban living and
technological improvements is likely to play an important
role in the obesity epidemic (and related health conditions),
yet there is a paucity of data on youth PA patterns in
developing countries.2 PA surveillance in developed coun-
tries has focused primarily on sport/exercise either during or
before/after school and often has neglected the intuitively
important contributions of active commuting behaviors and
chores that are more likely a part of everyday life in the
youth of developing countries. Likewise, we know little
about physical inactivity patterns (eg television watching,
studying, or passive games) of youth in developing coun-
tries.
China represents one developing country currently ex-
periencing rapid changes in health and nutrition that are
linked to political and social reforms initiated more than
20 y ago.4 Although the prevalence of overweight is
relatively low in Chinese youth (4% in Chinese adolescents
in 1993),5 it is considered an emerging problem.6 The
purpose of this paper was to describe PA and inactivity levels
and patterns in Chinese youth (aged 6­18 y of age and

the foundation upon which future longitudinal studies of PA
in this population will be based.
Methods
Study design
The China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) is a
longitudinal survey (with data currently available from
1989, 1991, 1993, and 1997) that was originally designed
to examine how the social and economic transformation of
Chinese society (and national and local implementation of
health, nutrition, and family planning policies and pro-
grams) has affected health and nutritional status of its
population. The study sample was drawn from eight
provinces (Guangxi, Guizhou, Heilongjiang, Henan, Hubei,
Hunan, Jiangsu, and Shandong) that vary substantially in
geography, economic development, public resources, and
health indicators. A multistage, random cluster process was
used to draw the surveyed sample. Counties in the eight
provinces were initially stratified by income (low, middle,
and high) and a weighted sampling scheme was used to
randomly select four counties in each province. The
provincial capital and a lower income city within each
province were selected. In addition, the township capital and
three villages within the counties were randomly selected.
Finally, within each city, urban and suburban neighborhoods
were randomly selected. Additional details about the
study design and sampling strategies are available at the
World Wide Web site for the China Health and Nutrition
Survey (http://www.cpc.unc.edu/projects/china/home.html)
or from Popkin et al.4
Subjects
The 1997 CHNS survey collected data from 1817 males and
1620 females aged 6­18 y. The analysis herein is focused on
1440 (79%) males (age ¼ 11.573.2 y) and 1262 (78%) females
(age ¼ 11.573.3 y) registered in school.
Anthropometric data
Height and weight were measured directly by trained health
workers who followed standard protocols similar to the
National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) protocol developed by the National Center for
Health Statistics in the USA. Weight in lightweight clothing
was measured to the nearest 0.1 kg and height was measured
to the nearest 0.1 cm. Body mass index (BMI) was calculated
as weight in kg/(height in meters)2. All data collection staff
took part in interobserver reliability testing as part of
training.5 Complete anthropometric data were obtained
during a physician-conducted physical examination from
1442 males and 1265 females; BMI for males was
18.077.1 kg/m2 and 18.179.4 kg/m2 for females.
Physical activity and inactivity data
CHNS PA and inactivity data were collected from youth
6­18 y of age for the first time in 1997. Older children were
asked survey questions directly. Parents were present for
interviews with children younger than 10 y of age7 and often
assisted the child with answering or answered the questions
directly as a proxy for the child. For youth registered in
school, survey questions focused on physical activities inside
and outside school hours (sports/exercise), commuting mode
to school (by motorized vehicle, bicycle, or walking), and
inactive pursuits outside of school hours (watching televi-
sion/videos, reading/writing/drawing, or playing board/vi-
deo games). For all activities identified, respondents were
queried about their duration (eg hours and minutes per week
or per day). Youth were also asked about their contribution
to family income (through family-run gardening/farming/
livestock care or small business/commercial ventures) and
about chores including housework (eg cleaning, cooking,
laundry) and childcare duties. Youth aged 16­18 y of age
were queried about gainful employment outside family
businesses.
Data treatment and statistical analysis
Background and household characteristics of the sample
included the proportions reporting urban vs rural dwelling,
and household television, motor vehicle, and bicycle/
tricycle ownership. The proportions classified as overweight
and as obese were determined using sex- and age- (mid-year)
appropriate BMI cutpoints established by the National
Center for Health Statistics (http://www.cdc.gov/growth-
charts).
Reported activities were assigned metabolic equivalent
(MET) values using the `Compendium of Physical Activ-
ities'.8 Metabolic rate at rest is classified as 1 MET; a 3 MET
activity requires three times the energy expenditure at rest.
An average MET value was imputed for categories of
activities (eg gymnastics, team sports, track and field, and
other activities). (In actuality, the energy cost of activities
may be approximately 10% higher in children. Unfortu-
nately, a youth-appropriate compendium of physical activ-
ities was not available at the time of these analyses.)
Categories of sport/exercise were considered moderate to
vigorous (MOD/VIG; Z3 MET) and categories of sedentary
activities were considered light (LIGHT; o3 MET), based on a
1993 CDC-ACSM consensus panel on PA and public health.9
Active commuting to school by bicycle (4 MET) or by
walking (3 MET) was also considered a moderate-intensity
activity. Time spent active commuting to school each week
was calculated by multiplying reported time for a round trip
by 5 days/week. Consultation with our Chinese collaborators
indicated that the seemingly incongruent examples in the
`other activities' category (eg board games, martial arts, and
boxing) all represented light activities performed informally
by youth; that is, martial arts and boxing are not structured,
regimented activities as we understand them to be in a

Western context. This category was accordingly coded. We
were also informed that it is not typical for Chinese children
under 12 y to ride a bicycle by themselves; those under 12 y
reporting commuting to school by bicycle likely rode on
their parent's bicycle and therefore were not given active
commuting credit. The age 12 y was also used to stratify
analyses by age group (ie o12 and Z12 y of age). This age cut
point is defensible since Chinese children also leave primary
school and enter middle school at this time.
Descriptive statistics were calculated after evaluation of
the distributions to identify and remove outliers (above the
99th percentile of distribution) for total reported time in
MOD/VIG PA (sum of in-school, outside school, and active
commuting). Questionnaire-derived PA data are typically
positively skewed with mean values biased by a large number
of subjects performing little or no PA or relatively few
subjects performing a lot of PA.10 Descriptive statistics herein
are therefore presented as the proportion reporting any
defined PA and the median and interquartile range (IQR) of
distribution of time (min/week) for those reporting any of
the defined activity. Gender and age group (ie o12 and
Z12 y of age) differences in proportions were tested using w2
tests. Differences in time in PA classifications were tested
using nonparametric (two-sided Wilcoxon rank sum) tests.
Sedentary activities included sitting watching television/
videos (1 MET), sitting reading/writing/drawing (1 MET), and
sitting games (1.5 MET). Inactivity indices included watch-
ing television Z2 and Z4 h/day. These categories of
television watching were set to be comparable to a US study
of television watching and body composition in youth.11
Descriptive statistics were again presented as the proportion
reporting any and the median and IQR of distribution of
time (min/week) for those reporting any of the defined
activity.
Performance of chores (gardening/farming/livestock care,
housework, childcare) was not queried in a similar manner
necessary to comparably construct accumulated duration;
however, the proportion reporting any of these activities was
explored. Engagement in gainful employment was only
asked of those youth aged 16­18 y of age (Chinese govern-
ment prohibits employment of youth younger than 16 y);
the proportion reporting any is reported. All statistical
analyses were conducted using SAS Version 8.01. Signifi-
cance was set at an alpha level of Po0.05.
Results
The analysis data set of Chinese school children contained
1423 males (11.573.2 y) and 1252 females (11.573.3 y),
having deleted 17 males and 10 females lying above the 99th
percentile of distribution for total reported time in MOD/
VIG PA. Complete anthropometric data were available for
1215 males (BMI ¼ 17.877.6 kg/m2) and 1058 females
(BMI ¼ 17.9710.2 kg/m2). A total of 5% of males and 4% of
females were classified as overweight; 5 and 6% were,
respectively, classified as obese. There were no significant
gender differences in age, BMI, or the proportion classified as
overweight or obese. Table 1 presents subjects' background
and household descriptive data.
Table 2 presents the proportion of Chinese school children
who engaged in any MOD/VIG PA and the time (min/week)
expended (for those reporting any) for each gender by age
group. Active commuting and MOD/VIG PA during school
contributed the most to daily PA for both males and females,
regardless of age group. There was no difference in the
proportion reporting any active commuting or reporting
time spent active commuting between genders within age
groups. Significant age group differences were apparent for
both genders, however. This was not explained solely by
differences in commuting by bicycling; older age groups also
more frequently reported walking and spending more time
commuting to school by walking (data not shown,
Po0.001). Fewer older school children engaged in MOD/
VIG PA during school and for shorter accumulated durations
compared with the younger age group. Females also engaged
in shorter durations of MOD/VIG PA during school com-
pared to males. Relatively few Chinese school children
engaged in any MOD/VIG PA outside of school. There were
no gender differences in the proportions reporting any time
in this activity but there were significant differences between
age groups; there was a slightly larger proportion of older
males and females who engaged in MOD/VIG PA outside of
school. Despite apparent differences in time in these
activities, no gender or age group differences were statisti-
cally significant.
Table 3 presents similar descriptive information with
regard to sedentary activities. Only 8% of Chinese school-
aged youth, regardless of gender, watch television Z2 h/day;
less than 1% watch Z4 h/day. Significant age group
differences were found for the proportion reporting any
time spent, and accumulated weekly time spent, watching
TV/videos or reading/writing/drawing. Relatively few youth
engage in sitting games (which include playing video
games). Still, Chinese female youth more frequently reported
engaging in sitting games and for longer accumulated
weekly time.
Less than 2% of males and females reported any garden-
ing/farming/livestock care activities and less than 1%
reported assisting with small business/commercial ventures
related to family income. A total of 11% of males and 20% of
females reported any chores related to housework. Less than

of Chinese youth 16­18 y of age and registered in school
reported gainful employment.
Discussion
The most frequently reported MOD/VIG PA for Chinese
youth includes active commuting and in-school activities.
Although a decreased proportion of older youth reported
engaging in these activity types, the median accumulated
weekly time spent on these activities is higher compared to
younger children. Relatively few males and even fewer
females participate in any MOD/VIG PA outside of school.
Commuting mode to school is likely influenced by a
number of factors including (1) distance to school; (2) cost;
(3) economic circumstances of the family; (4) availability of
motorized transport (either household owned or public

transit options), and (5) specific to China, whether the youth
is of an accepted age to ride a bicycle independently.
Currently, a relatively low proportion (15­17%) of house-
holds in this study owned a motorized vehicle; this is likely
to change as urbanization continues. In contrast, in the USA
where motorized transportation is ubiquitous, a recent
report of school transportation modes in Georgia indicated
that fewer than 19% of school-aged children who lived r1
mile from school walked to school the majority of days of
the week and almost 42% were chauffeured to school in a
private vehicle.12 Household ownership of motorized trans-
portation has been associated with obesity in Chinese adults
(both men and women) and acquisition of a motorized
vehicle increased the odds of becoming obese over an 8 y
time period in men.13 Active commuting behaviors have also
been associated with reduced cardiovascular risk factors in a
municipal sample of Chinese adults.14­16
A great proportion (approximately 72%) of the sample
surveyed participated in MOD/VIG PA during school. The
survey did not distinguish between activities performed
during structured physical education classes, other organized
activities (eg intramural sports during lunch breaks), or
informal activities during recess or lunch breaks. In compar-
ison, 21­22% of American youth participate regularly in
physical education class.17,18 Although reported accumu-
lated time in MOD/VIG PA during school was relatively high,
it is likely an overestimation produced from recalling
structured time periods and not necessarily representative
of completely active time. In US schools, elementary school
children were engaged in MOD/VIG PA less than 9% of
physical education class time.19 These findings and others20
suggest that accumulated time in PA during school may
actually be less than reported by Chinese youth as well.
High levels of television watching have been associated
with youth overweight and obesity in cross-sectional
studies.11,21­24 The consistency, strength, and specificity of
these associations suggest that television viewing may lead
to weight gain in at least some youth. At this time, evidence
from longitudinal studies is lacking, however, and we know
of only one randomized controlled trial to reduce children's
television viewing habits.25 That study reported significant
decreases in indicators of adiposity (eg BMI, triceps skinfold
thickness, waist girth, and waist-to-hip ratio) thus providing
additional evidence of a causal relationship between televi-
sion viewing habits and obesity.25 Additional prospective
studies are warranted to confirm causation. Chinese youth,
however, do not watch television/videos to the extent
observed in other countries despite the relatively high levels
(90­91%) of household television ownership reported here-
in. In the US, 65­67% of youth 8­16 y of age reported
watching television Z2 h/day.11,23 In the Philippines (an-
other developing country where household television own-
ership is 73­80%), 48% of youth watch television Z2 h/day26
compared with 8% herein. Between-country differences may
reflect regional television programming relevance and
appeal or cultural differences in viewing habits. American-
style satellite television (eg 30+ channels and programming
that includes game shows, reality-based shows, primetime
dramas, and product advertisements) has only recently been
introduced on a large scale to China.27 In 1997, almost none
of the Chinese households surveyed had access to such
contemporary television programming. We therefore antici-
pate that overweight and obesity will increase in Chinese
youth as television watching behaviors increase in response
to this new wave of mass-appeal broadcasting and consumer
marketing. CHNS data from 2000, 2003, and 2006 will likely
reveal important shifts in behavior and important health
outcomes. Additional data will include type of television
channels available to and preferred by youth.
The proportion of Chinese youth reporting reading/
writing/drawing appears comparable to television/video
watching, although older age groups appear to be spending
more accumulated weekly time in the former activity.
Unfortunately, there is little published international data
about other forms of inactivity (eg studying or passive
games) to compare these findings to. Youth in China are
under great pressure to perform well in school, and heavy
homework loads are typical.28,29 A university education is
seen as the only path to a good job and the pressure to
succeed scholastically begins early since university entrance
is restricted.28 Providing a good education is also valued in
Chinese society and parental care of children includes time
devoted to assisting with homework.30
Our estimates of accumulated time in various activities did
not include time spent in gainful employment or performing
chores. Very few youth are employed, however, and chores
related to housework (chores at school were not queried) are
not a part of life for Chinese youth (as stated previously,
fewer than 20% performed these tasks). The Chinese
government prohibits employment of youth younger than
16 y of age, and the availability of job opportunities for older
adolescents is limited and restricted by administrative
requirements that discourage workplaces from hiring tem-
porary or short-term workers. Chinese women take on all
household responsibilities in part to free children to focus on
scholastic achievement.28 In contrast, the primary source of
PA for Filipino youth is chores (eg cleaning, fetching water,
laundry), both at school and at home.26 Performance of
domestic tasks is also common in other developing coun-
tries, especially for adolescent females.31,32 For example,
Russian girls aged 6­13 y spend 4­10 h/week in housework
whereas Russian boys spend 4­5 h/week in these activities.32
This suggests that China is unique and does not follow
anticipated patterns of time use in this regard, at least for
youth. A caveat to interpretation is that gardening/farming/
livestock care was only queried with regard to contribution
to family income; however, it is possible that more youth are
involved in these types of activities for immediate family
consumption. Regardless, such activities are seasonal and are
not typically performed by youth. Instead, parents and
adults in the community actively discourage any work/
chores or other activities that might interfere with their

expected role as students. The surprisingly low proportion of
Chinese youth performing childcare duties is a direct
reflection of the fact that national birth control policies
have limited family size33 and, therefore, childcare opportu-
nities. In all, we do not consider the determination of
accumulated time in various activities to be problematic.
The strength of this study is that it is based on a large
eight-province nationwide representative survey that has
been administered over several years, subjected to stringent
quality control strategies, and involves international colla-
borators. The extensive database uniquely includes measures
of inactivity as well as PA. The cross-sectional findings
herein, however, are based on a single year of data collection
and therefore limit causal inference. Further, parents neces-
sarily assisted younger children (o10 y of age) with the
survey or provided a proxy report of children's PA habits.
Although proxy reports have been questioned with regard to
validity, proxy reports are practical approaches for large
study populations and permit researchers to avoid recall
biases associated with the cognitive limitations of young
children.34
As Chinese youth transition to adult roles and responsi-
bilities, time spent in MOD/VIG PA currently pursued during
school will be exchanged for increasingly sedentary employ-
ment options.3,4 As modernization and technological ad-
vancement continue in this developing country, it is likely
that commuting patterns will also shift to more passive
forms (ie increased use of motorized transportation alter-
natives). Already public busses have replaced bicycles as the
primary means of transportation for urban dwellers.35 These
changes portend an increased prevalence of overweight and
obesity (and obesity-related conditions) in Chinese youth as
they transition to adulthood. Against this backdrop of
decreasing PA and increasing inactivity, it appears that
health promotion efforts should focus on public transporta-
tion policies that encourage continued reliance on more
active forms of commuting, promote increased participation
in leisure-time MOD/VIG PA, and attempt to cap time spent
in inactivity (eg studying, watching television, and playing
passive games). Unfortunately, it appears that a strong
foundation of involvement in leisure time MOD/VIG PA is
not currently nurtured in Chinese youth, especially in
females, and that the competing societal pressure to excel
at school will not be soon relieved. Perhaps most threaten-
ingly, recently introduced mass television programming
improvements foreshadow an amplified obesity epidemic.
In summary, in-school activities and active commuting
represent the most important forms of MOD/VIG PA of
Chinese youth. In-school activities are susceptible to par-
ental and societal pressures for academic success manifested
in education policy changes and to the transition to adult
roles and responsibilities. Active commuting behaviors are
especially susceptible to transportation policies that favor
more passive forms of commuting with increased moder-
nization and affluence. Participation in leisure-time MOD/
VIG PA is currently underutilized by Chinese youth as an
alternative form of health-related activity. Although televi-
sion viewing is relatively low, this is expected to change
dramatically in future years. And although overweight and
obesity rates are relatively low for the moment, there is
evidence that they are also increasing over time.36 Doubtless,
the social and economic transformation of Chinese society
will continue to impact the health and welfare of its
populace. The concomitant impact of changes in youth PA
and inactivity patterns and their impact on obesity trends
will continue to be studied longitudinally in China with
subsequent administrations of the CHNS.
