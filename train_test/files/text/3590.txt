Can Hospital Competition Really Affect
Hospital Behavior or Not? An Empirical
Study of Different Competition Measures
Comparison in Taiwan
Tsung-Hsien Yu, PhD1, Yu-Chi Tung, PhD2, and Chung-Jen Wei, PhD3
Abstract
Different approaches to measure the hospital competition index might lead to inconsistent results of the effects of hospital
competition on innovation adoption. The purpose of this study is to adopt a different approach to define market area and
measure the level of competition to examine whether hospital competition has a positive effect on hospital behavior, taking
quality indicator projects participation as an example. A total of 238 hospitals located in Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung were
recruited in this study. Competition index was used as the independent variable, and participation lists of Taiwan Clinical
Performance Indicator and Taiwan Healthcare Indicator Series in 2012 were used as dependent variables. All data used in this
study were retrieved from the 2012 national hospital profiles and the participation list of the 2 quality indicator projects in
2012; these profiles are issued by the Taiwan Ministry of Health and Welfare annually. Geopolitical boundaries and 4 kinds of
fixed radiuses were used to define market area. Herfindahl-Hirschman Index and hospital density were used to measure the
level of competition. A total of 12 competition indices were produced in this study by employing the geographic information
system, while max-rescaled R2 was used to evaluate and compare the models on goodness of fit. The results show that the
effects of hospital competition on quality indicator projects participation were varied, which mean different indicators for
market competition might reveal different conclusions. Furthermore, this study also found the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
at 5-km radius was the optimum competition index.

Introduction
Quality improvement has become a central tenet in health
care. It is no longer the preserve of enthusiastic volunteers
but instead a part of the daily routine of all those involved in
delivering health care. It has also become a statutory obliga-
tion in many countries.1 In response to the growing demands
for quality transparency, costs control, and reduced varia-
tions in clinical practices, assessing the quality of health care
has become increasingly important for different stakehold-
ers, including health care providers, decision makers, and
purchasers of health care services.2 However, quality cannot
be improved without a measurement baseline. The Quality-
of-Care Framework (Structure-Process-Outcome) proposed
by Donabedian is the most important model for assessing the
quality of care.3 To assess the quality of care and to develop
the measurement instruments, researchers have used this
model along with quality indicators.
The Taiwan National Health Insurance Scheme was
launched in 1995. Since then, it has not only increased the
accessibility of health care for Taiwanese citizens but also
increased the level of competition among hospitals. Hospitals
are looking for any means to achieve an advantage, such as
purchasing high-tech and expensive equipment, or imple-
menting new quality improvement activities, such as partici-
pating in quality indicator projects.4 The quality indicator has
been used in Taiwan since the 1980s. It was an innovative
topic, and only a few hospitals adopted it at that time2;

2 INQUIRY
nowadays, however, it has become one of the most commonly
seen quality improvement activities in Taiwan.5 Besides,
quality indicator is a major tool for assessing hospital perfor-
mance. It has been used extensively in the medical industry
since the last decade; not only was it used for internal organi-
zation improvement but it has also been used for payment,6,7
report cards,8,9 accreditation schemes,10 and other external
applications.
Many studies have discussed the effects of hospital com-
petition on quality improvement activities adoption,11-13 but
these studies have demonstrated inconclusive and sometimes
contradictory findings on the effects of hospital competi-
tion.14 For example, Sethi et al15 found hospitals located in a
higher competitive environment were prone to adopt new
technology for endovascular aneurysm repair treatment.
However, Weiner et al16 found that market competition is
negatively associated with quality improvement implemen-
tation scope. In addition to the difference of contextual fac-
tors and organizational characteristics, most existing studies
have usually adopted a single approach and definition to
measure hospital market competition. The variations in indi-
cator measurement methods might lead to different results,
which included the approaches to define market area and to
measure level of competition.17,18 According to the review by
Wong et al,19 there are 6 approaches to define market area,
including geopolitical boundaries, fixed radius, variable
radius, patient flow, cross elasticity of demand, and Elzinga-
Hogarty. Regarding level of competition, there are 3 indica-
tors for measuring the level of competition, including the
number of hospitals, the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index (HHI),
and concentration ratio. Wong et al also found geopolitical
boundaries, fixed radius, variable radius, and patient flow are
most commonly used for defining market area, and the num-
ber of hospitals and the HHI are most frequently used for
measuring hospital competition within market areas.
A brief summary of the most common approaches to
define market area and to measure level of competition is as
follows: Geopolitical boundary is the most common
approach to define the market area because of its ease of
implementation, but this approach might not be consistent
with daily life operations in practice. For example, for 2
hospitals located on both sides of a boundary, they would be
providing service to the same community and population,
but each belongs to different market areas. Although a fixed
and variable radius approach can overcome this disadvan-
tage of geopolitical boundary approach, defining the opti-
mal radius is still a major challenge.20,21 Patient flow is the
most sophisticated approach to depict market area, and it is
also the most difficult approach to employ. As for measuring
the level of competition, the number of hospitals has the
advantages of being intuitive and easy to implement.
However, the disadvantage of this measure is that it does not
reflect differences in market share. The HHI was the sum of
squared market shares for all the hospitals in the market. In
the context of hospital competition, a hospital's market
share is frequently calculated as the number of discharges
from that hospital divided by the total number of discharges
from all hospitals in the market.22
Although the lack of consensus to measure the level of
market competition might be a problem, comparative studies
on the effect of hospital competition indicators are limited.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to adopt a different
approach to define the market area and measure the level of
competition, to examine whether hospital competition has a
positive effect on quality indicator project participation or
otherwise. Due to the characteristics of the data, we only
used geopolitical boundaries and fixed radius to define mar-
ket areas, and adopted the number of hospitals and the HHI
for measuring hospital competition within market areas in
this study.
Methods
Data Source
There were 2 data sources used in this study. The first was the
2012 national hospital profile issued by the Taiwan Ministry
of Health and Welfare annually. It includes information on
variables relevant to medical services, such as hospital size,
number of all kinds of medical staff, inpatient and outpatient
services, and patients' length of stay. We used these data to
obtain the characteristics of hospitals and the calculation of
the hospital competition index. The second data source was
the quality indicator project participant list in 2012, which
includes the 2 major quality indicator projects in Taiwan,
namely, Taiwan Clinical Performance Indicator (TCPI) and
Taiwan Healthcare Indicator Series (THIS).23
In 1999, the Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital
Accreditation introduced the International Quality Indicator
Project (IQIP), named Taiwan Quality Indicator Project
(TQIP). After a 10-year cooperation with IQIP, the Taiwan
Joint Commission on Hospital Accreditation used this expe-
rience to develop TCPI that can further meet hospitals'
demand. Unlike TQIP, the THIS was developed by local
experts, the Taiwan College of Healthcare Executives,
launched in 2001.23 Both TCPI and THIS were voluntary
quality indicator projects. Hospitals submit their data regu-
larly, where either Taiwan Joint Commission on Hospital
Accreditation or Taiwan College of Healthcare Executives
will provide feedback periodically. Besides, both of them
are the largest and most important quality indicator projects
in Taiwan. Most hospitals select either TCPI or THIS to
participate.
In addition, we selected the 3 major cities Taipei, Taichung,
and Kaohsiung as our study area. Taiwan is a mountainous
island shaped like a leaf that is narrow at both ends. The ter-
rain in Taiwan is divided into 2 parts: the flat to gently rolling
plains in the west and the mostly rugged forest-covered
mountains in the east. Around 90% of the population in
Taiwan lives in the west coastal plain, which is also where
Yu et al 3
most hospitals are located, especially in Taipei, Taichung, and
Kaohsiung. For homogeneity, hospitals located in these cities
were included in our study.
Independent Variable: Competition Index
We adopted geopolitical boundaries and the fixed radius
approach to define the market area. The geopolitical bound-
aries were set from both the town and county boundaries and
the following radius circles: 1, 5, 10, and 25 km. In the
absence of sufficient data from local studies, the chosen dis-
tances were based on the results of expert panel meeting. The
level of market competition was measured by hospital den-
sity and the HHI. We used hospital density to reflect the
number of hospitals in an area because it was easier to inter-
pret than the number of hospitals per se. The HHI values
ranged from 1/N to 1, where N is the number of hospitals in
the market. A high HHI value means high market concentra-
tion. The advantage of the HHI is that it reflects both the
number of hospitals and their relative market share. We
employed the geographic information system (ArcGIS 9.3)
to describe the market and calculate the hospital density and
HHI within an area. A total of 12 competition indices were
produced in this study.
Dependent Variable: Quality Indicator Project
Participation
The quality indicator project participation was used as the
dependent variable. If a hospital participated in TCPI or
THIS and updated data routinely (at least twice per year),
then it would be identified as a participating hospital, other-
wise a nonparticipating hospital.
Control Variables
In addition to competition index and quality indicator project
participation, this study also collected ownership, size, and
ratio of discharge to number of health care professionals (i.e.,
physicians, nurses, administrative staff). In some capacity, it
is necessary to input resources when implementing quality
improvement activities; sufficient manpower/workload is
one of the key successful factors in literature.24 Therefore,
we used these 3 variables to represent the proxy of workload,
and these 3 professional indexes are usually highly participa-
tive in quality improvement activities. Besides, these 3 work-
load variables were categorized into 3 groups, using the first
and third quartiles (Q1 and Q3) as cutoff points.
Statistical Analysis
All statistical analyses were performed using SAS (version
9.4; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North Carolina). In statistical
testing, frequency and percentage were used to present
the hospital characteristics. In bivariate analysis, potential
predictors of quality indicator projects were examined by
using the chi-square test. Logistic regression was used to
assess project participation, and max-rescaled R2 was used to
evaluate and compare the models on goodness of fit.25
Results
The descriptive analysis of sample hospitals, and comparison
among participating hospitals and nonparticipating hospitals
is demonstrated in Table 1. A total of 238 hospitals were
included in this study, most of which are medium-sized hos-
pitals (50-300 beds); two-thirds of the sample were private
hospitals, while the percentage of public and not-for-profit
hospitals were 16% and 18%, respectively. In terms of com-
parison of participating hospitals and nonparticipating hospi-
tals, larger sized hospitals, nonprivate hospitals, and higher
ratio of discharge to the number of health care professionals
were prone to participate in quality indicator projects.
Table 2 shows the results of model comparison, where
model 0 represents the base model, which only included all
control variables. Twelve competition indices were then
placed into the baseline model respectively. The results
showed the effects of hospital competition on quality indica-
tor projects participation were varied, which means different
definitions of market competition indicator might lead to dif-
ferent conclusions.
Furthermore, the results also revealed the model fit of
distance-based market area models (models 5-12) was better
than geopolitical boundary models (models 1-4), and the
effect of competition index in models 1 to 4 was not signifi-
cant. The results of this study also demonstrated the competi-
tion indices that used geopolitical boundaries to define
market area could only improve the model fit slightly, and
most of them were not significant. Finally, we also found
model 10 had the best-fitting model among all models, which
meant a 5-km radius with HHI was the best competition
index to examine the effects on quality indicator projects
participation.
Discussion
Competition drives the quality of care in many health care
systems, in addition to the more altruistic motivations that
health care workers often report. This is true not only in
Taiwan but also in many developed countries, including the
United States and the United Kingdom, as health care organi-
zations worldwide urgently search for ways to improve both
quality and cost-effectiveness.26 Such competition shapes
hospital strategies implemented to adapt to the market envi-
ronment and needs, which can lead to a medical arms race.27
In this study, we examined the effect of competition on qual-
ity indicator projects participation by using geopolitical
boundaries and fixed radius to define market area, and hospi-
tal density and HHI to measure the level of competition. The
results show that the effects of hospital competition on quality
4 INQUIRY
indicator projects participation were varied, meaning the vari-
ations in competition indicator measurement methods may
lead to different results. And this study also found 5 km was
the optimum radius to define the market area.
Furthermore, 3 issues merit further discussion. First of all,
which approach is appropriate for defining market area?
Previous researchers usually used geopolitical boundaries to
define hospital market areas. Although measures of these
boundaries are easy to calculate and are linked to demo-
graphic data, they do not take account of hospitals' competi-
tiveness or how they are affected by the so-called
neighborhood factors that are geographical rather than geo-
political. For example, 2 nearby hospitals that happen to be
on different sides of a geopolitical boundary may compete
with each other fiercely. The results of this study demon-
strated the competition indices that were using geopolitical
boundary to define market area could only improve the
model fit slightly, and most of them were not significant.
Along with computer technology development, defining the
market area has become easier today. For instance, GPS can
be employed to implement the radius-based approach, which
we adopted in the present study. However, the selection of an
optimal radius is another challenge.According to the original
definition of this approach, a radius is determined by the
catchment area in which 75% to 90% of a hospital's patients
reside.28 Nevertheless, this study could not obtain such infor-
mation; therefore, we modified the fixed radius approach by
replacing the standard coverage rate with 4 different radii
which were determined by an expert panel.
Second, which approach is appropriate to measure the
level of competition? Both hospital density and the HHI are
most commonly used in hospital competition studies; the pros
and cons of these are described above. Which one is better in
measuring the level of hospital competition? According to the
definition, the HHI should better represent the level of hospi-
tal competition; however, our findings did not support this. In
terms of improving model fit, 2 models showed that hospital
density was better than the HHI (models 3 and 11 vs models
1 and 12), which used the same market area. In contrast, there
were also 4 models that showed the HHI was better than hos-
pital density (models 2, 5, 8, and 10 vs models 4, 6, 7, and 9).
The findings were not consistent; therefore, we are unable to
determine which one is better. The phenomenon might be
explained by the fact that hospital behavior is affected not
only by hospital competition but also by internal factors such
as leaders' values, attitudes, and educational background14,29
and resource availability.12,24 This information was not avail-
able in this study and is therefore also a major limitation.
Finally, regarding the relationship between hospital
competition and quality indicator project participation.

6 INQUIRY
Although the findings of this study were varied, at least,
there was no negative effect of hospital competition on
quality indicator project participation. However, why does
hospital competition drive hospitals to take the same
action? The adoption of similar actions within a given insti-
tutional environment can be explained by organizational
isomorphism30 and institutional theory.31 These theories
illustrate that organizations experience pressure to conform
to their institutional environment because of the operation
of coercive pressures from political institutions, normative
pressures from occupational and professional constituen-
cies, and mimetic pressures from other organizations with
which they compare themselves with.
In summary, the results of this study have several contri-
butions. In terms of theoretical contribution, except the rela-
tionship between hospital competition and quality indicator
projects participation were varied, our findings also showed
there was no negative relationship between hospital competi-
tion and quality indicator projects participation when various
hospital competition indicators were used. Therefore, our
findings might prove that hospitals would change their
behavior due to mimetic pressures or normal pressures,
which are components of the institutional theory. Regarding
practical management/policy implications, the results also
imply that health authorities should pay more attention on
defining market area and, for hospitals located in low com-
petition areas, for example, providing incentives to encour-
age the more adoption of quality improvement activities. For
future research, selecting an appropriate approach and defi-
nition to define market area and to measure the level of com-
petition is an important issue for future study. Nowadays,
researchers define market area more precisely by employing
geographic information systems. The appropriateness of
using geopolitical boundary to define market area should be
considered in future studies.
Altogether, this study applied a geopolitical boundary and
fixed radius approach to define market area, and also adopted
HHI and hospital density to measure the level of competi-
tion. A total of 12 hospital competition indices were pro-
duced in this study and were also used to examine whether
hospital competition had positive effect on quality indicator
projects participation. However, even with these advantages,
the study was still subject to 2 major limitations as described
below:
1. The information of patients' residences is not avail-
able. It is not possible for our study to adopt the
patient flow approach to define market area.
Furthermore, a variable radius approach is also inap-
plicable because of the lack of data mentioned above.
The expert meeting which we held in this study
attempted to alleviate this limitation.
2. Across-sectional study design might hinder the expla-
nation of the results. This study demonstrated vari-
ous approaches and definitions to measure hospital
competition that could lead to inconsistent results.
However, the causal effects between hospital compe-
tition and quality indicator project participation
should be explored by a longitudinal study instead of
a cross-sectional study.
Conclusions
In summary, our study adopted the geopolitical boundaries
and fixed radius to define market area, while the HHI and
hospital density were used for measuring the level of compe-
tition. A total of 12 competition indicators were produced in
this study. After applying them to examine the relationship
between hospital competition and quality indicator project
participation, we found the results varied by different com-
petition indicators. Our findings demonstrated that the incon-
sistent findings of existing hospital competition studies
might be caused by various measurement methods of compe-
tition. Policy makers and further studies should take this
issue into account.
