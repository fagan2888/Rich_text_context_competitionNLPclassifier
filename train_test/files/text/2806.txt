Context: Little is known about prevalence rates of
DSM-IV disorders across age strata of older adults, in-
cluding common conditions such as individual and co-
existing mood and anxiety disorders.
Objective: To determine nationally representative es-
timates of 12-month prevalence rates of mood, anxiety,
and comorbid mood-anxiety disorders across young-
old, mid-old, old-old, and oldest-old community-
dwelling adults.
Design: The National Comorbidity Survey Replication
(NCS-R) is a population-based probability sample of 9282
participants 18 years and older, conducted between Feb-
ruary 2001 and April 2003. The NCS-R survey used the
fully structured World Health Organization World Men-
tal Health Survey version of the Composite Interna-
tional Diagnostic Interview.
Setting: Continental United States.
Participants: We studied the 2575 participants 55 years
and older who were part of NCS-R (43%, 55-64 years;
32%, 65-74 years; 20%, 75-84 years; 5%, 85 years).
This included only noninstitutionalized adults, as all
NCS-R participants resided in households within the
community.
Main Outcome Measures: Twelve-month preva-
lence of mood disorders (major depressive disorder, dys-
thymia, bipolar disorder), anxiety disorders (panic dis-
order, agoraphobia, specific phobia, social phobia,
generalized anxiety disorder, posttraumatic stress disor-
der), and coexisting mood-anxiety disorder were as-
sessed using DSM-IV criteria. Prevalence rates were
weighted to adjust for the complex design to infer gen-
eralizability to the US population.
Results: The likelihood of having a mood, anxiety, or
combined mood-anxiety disorder generally showed a pat-
tern of decline with age (P.05). Twelve-month disor-
ders showed higher rates in women compared with men,
a statistically significant trend with age. In addition, anxi-
ety disorders were as high if not higher than mood dis-
orders across age groups (overall 12-month rates: mood,
5% and anxiety, 12%). No differences were found be-
tween race/ethnicity groups.
Conclusion: Prevalence rates of DSM-IV mood and anxi-
ety disorders in late life tend to decline with age, but re-
main very common, especially in women. These results
highlight the need for intervention and prevention strat-
egies.

KNOWLEDGE OF THE PREVA-

The Epidemiologic Catchment Area
(ECA) Survey,11 conducted from 1980-
1984 in 5 US cities, has been used for many
years as the standard to estimate the preva-
lence of psychiatric disorders in US adults
65 years and older.10 Despite its impres-
sive impact, the ECA has 2 important limi-
tations. First, the ECA is not a nationally
representative probability sample. Sec-
ond, it used the Diagnostic Interview
Schedule,12 which allowed the determina-
tion of DSM-III13 diagnoses but not cur-
rent DSM-IV.14 The original National Co-
morbidity Survey (NCS), conducted in
1990-1992, is a national probability

sample, unlike the ECA. However, the NCS did not in-
clude older adults and also examined DSM-III-R disor-
ders.15 In contrast, the NCS Replication (NCS-R) was con-
ducted in 2001-2003 and included older adult respondents
and expanded assessments based on the current diag-
nostic criteria of the DSM-IV.14 Additionally, the NCS-R
includes a nationally representative distribution of sex
and race/ethnicity. These are 2 important demographic
factors when considering prevalence rates at the popu-
lation level but are understudied in mental health re-
search of late life.16-19 Recent examination of the NCS-R
included comparison of older adults' (65 years) and
younger adults' (18-44 years and 45-64 years) preva-
lence rates.20 This study did not consider detailed com-
parisons of older age cohorts, including the oldest old
(85 years), and did not account for comorbid mood and
anxiety disorder.
The purpose of our study was to determine nation-
ally representative estimates of age-specific 12-month
prevalence rates of DSM-IV mood, anxiety, and comor-
bid disorders among community-dwelling older adults
in the NCS-R, comparing young-old, mid-old, old-old,
and oldest-old US respondents. This study examines
age-stratified diagnostic measures of psychiatric disor-
ders, including the oldest-old and sex and race/ethnic
differences, in a large probability sample of older
adults.
METHODS
PARTICIPANTS
The NCS-R is a nationally representative survey of 9282 non-
institutionalized participants 18 years and older in the coter-
minous United States.21-23 Respondents were selected from a mul-
tistage clustered area probability sample of households. Face-
to-face interviews were conducted in respondents' homes
between February 2001 and April 2003. Individuals residing
in nursing homes, assisted living, and independent living fa-
cilities were therefore excluded from the sample. Any cluster-
ing of respondents by retirement communities was alleviated
by the household enumeration procedures used in NCS-R to
create a national probability sample. Professional interviewers
from the Institute for Social Research at the University of Michi-
gan, Ann Arbor, carried out interviews. The response rate was
70.9%.21
The current sample consisted of 2575 community-based
adults 55 years and older, with data obtained from the Inter-
university Consortium for Political and Social Research.24 The
NCS-R was administered in 2 parts. The part 1 sample, which
is the focus of this study, included all respondents assessed for
core mental disorders. One thousand three hundred seventy-
two of the 2575 who met criteria for any lifetime mental dis-
order in part 1, plus a probability subsample of other partici-
pants from part 1, received a part 2 interview.21,25,26 The part 2
interview included questions about risk factors, conse-
quences, other correlates, and additional mental disorders. As-
sessment for posttraumatic stress disorder required lengthier
introductory questions than other disorders, which precluded
the quick skip out of noncases that was desired in part 1.21 Thus,
posttraumatic stress disorder was only assessed in the part 2
survey. The NCS-R data were weighted to control for differ-
ential probabilities of selection, differential nonresponse, and
residual differences between demographic variables of the sample
and 2000 US census population.23,27 A detailed description of
the NCS-R sampling and weighting procedures are outlined else-
where.23
MEASURES
Diagnostic Assessment
The NCS-R diagnoses were determined using the World
Health Organization World Mental Health (WMH) Survey
Initiative version of the Composite International Diagnostic
Interview (CIDI).28 The WMH-CIDI is a fully structured lay
interview that generates lifetime and 12-month diagnoses
according to the International Classification of Diseases, 10th
Revision29 and DSM-IV14 criteria.21,25 In the present analyses,
the DSM-IV criteria were used. The mental disorders exam-
ined included mood disorders (major depressive disorder,
dysthymia, bipolar I and II disorders), anxiety disorders
(panic disorder, agoraphobia without panic, specific phobia,
social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, and posttrau-
matic stress disorder), and comorbid mood-anxiety disorder
(ie, any co-occurring mood and anxiety disorders). DSM-IV
organic exclusion rules and hierarchy rules were used in
making diagnoses.21,25 Using a probability subsample of
NCS-R respondents in a clinical calibration design,30 Kessler
et al21 found that blind clinical reinterviews with the Struc-
tured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV31 were in good con-
cordance with WMH-CIDI diagnoses for mood and anxiety
disorders.
Sociodemographic Variables
Distributions of sociodemographic variables by 12-month DSM-
IV/WMH-CIDI mood, anxiety, and comorbid mood-anxiety dis-
orders were examined. The main demographic variable of in-
terest was age defined by 4 categories: young-old (55-64 years),
mid-old (65-74 years), old-old (75-84 years), and oldest old
(85 years). These were examined overall and by sex and race/
ethnicity (non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and His-
panic or other). In addition, we examined completed years of
education (0-11, 12, 13-15, and 16), marital status (married/
cohabitating, divorced/separated/widowed, never married), and
geographic region of residence (Northeast, Midwest, South, and
West).
To create as accurate a presentation as possible of the trend
of psychiatric disorders across increasing age groups, plots of
figures were further refined, plotting weighted prevalence rates
by 5-year age intervals.
STATISTICAL ANALYSES
Prevalenceratesweredeterminedbyfrequencymeasuresandcross-
tabulations estimating age differences across DSM-IV disorders.
Twelve-month prevalence was estimated as the percentage of re-
spondents who had a mood, anxiety, or comorbid mood-anxiety
disorder in the year prior to the interview.
Three sets of analyses were considered for mood, anxiety,
and comorbid disorders. First, overall proportions were esti-
mated by the age categories young-old, mid-old, old-old, and
oldest old. Second, age differences were examined by sex.
Finally, age differences were examined by race/ethnicity. To
statistically test if prevalence trends across age groups were
different between men and women and between race/ethnic
categories, interaction terms with age modeled as continu-
ous (and main effects) were examined in logistic regression
analyses, correcting for the complex sampling design.
Because overall prevalence rates were similar and prevalence

patterns with age were similar across race/ethnic groups,
subgroup results by race/ethnicity are not presented.
To produce nationally representative estimates, clustering
and weighting techniques were implemented to reduce sys-
tematic bias and imprecision embedded in the complex sam-
pling design. Thus, the percentages represent weighted pro-
portions and statistical differences were estimated based on the
Rao-Scott 2, which corrects for the complex design.32 The stan-
dard errors were determined from a recalculation of variance
using the Taylor series linear approximation method.33 Design-
adjusted estimates and tests were not computed when a table
cell had zero frequency.
The part 1 sample and weights were used for all analyses
exceptindividualanalysesofposttraumaticstressdisorder,which
were conducted with part 2 weights and included an addi-
tional weight adjusting for oversampling of part 1 cases. Be-
cause posttraumatic stress disorder was a component of the
pooled anxiety disorders, sensitivity analyses were conducted
using the part 2 sample to examine pooled (any) anxiety dis-
orders, as well as comorbid disorder. The results using either
sample for analysis were shown to be similar. Therefore, to main-
tain power and precision, all final analyses of pooled disorders
were conducted using the larger part 1 sample.
Statistical tests were 2-tailed with P.05 defining statisti-
cal significance. All analyses were performed using SAS sur-
vey procedures (version 9.1.3; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, North
Carolina).
RESULTS
The 2575 participants 55 years and older who were part
of NCS-R included 43% aged 55 to 64 years, 32% aged
65 to 74 years, 20% aged 75 to 84 years, and 5% 85 years
and older. The mean (SD) age was approximately 68 (9.2)
years. The sample distribution was 59% women, 82% non-
Hispanic white, 10% non-Hispanic black, and approxi-
mately 4% Hispanic. The majority of the sample had a
high school education or higher, and more than half the
respondents were married or not living alone. The dis-
tribution of the sample by region was representative across
the United States.
In Table 1, cross-tabulations of demographic char-
acteristicsand12-monthDSM-IV/WMH-CIDImood,anxi-
ety, and comorbid mood-anxiety disorders are pre-
sented. Sex and marital status were prominent
characteristics associated with DSM-IV disorders. Women
had significantly higher rates of mood, anxiety, and co-

morbid disorders than men (P.05). Being married or
cohabitating were statistically significantly associated with
lower rates of mood, anxiety, and comorbid disorders
compared with being divorced, separated, widowed, or
never married. For education, statistical differences were
apparent for any anxiety disorders, where low educa-
tion (incompletion of high school) and college years were
associated with high rates of anxiety. There were no dif-
ferences for any disorder by race/ethnicity or geo-
graphic region of residence.
MOOD DISORDERS 12-MONTH
AGE-SPECIFIC PREVALENCE
The overall and age-specific 12-month rates for mood dis-
orders are presented in Table 2. The rates mainly de-
clined across age groups (55 years and older). Twelve-
month rates for any mood disorder and major depressive
disorder significantly declined with age (P.001).
For stratified analyses by sex, the Figure, A shows
the prevalence rates of pooled mood disorders for women
and men; 12-month prevalence rates declined with age
for both women and men. However, the 12-month rates
with increasing age were statistically significantly more
prominent for women than men ( interaction=0.06;
Wald 2
1
=3.7; P interaction=.05). There were no differ-
ences in the prevalence of mood disorders with increas-
ing age by race or ethnicity.
ANXIETY DISORDERS 12-MONTH
AGE-SPECIFIC PREVALENCE
The overall and age-specific 12-month rates for anxiety
disorders are presented in Table 2. The most prevalent
12-month anxiety disorder was specific phobia, fol-
lowed by social phobia, posttraumatic stress disorder, gen-
eralized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and agorapho-
bia. Differences in 12-month prevalence rates across the
4 age categories for the pooled and for most individual
anxiety disorders were statistically significant (P.05).
For analyses by sex, the Figure, B shows that for women
(Rao-Scott 2
3
=22.7; P.001) and men (Rao-Scott
2
3
=41.8; P.001) the prevalence of pooled anxiety dis-
order declined with age, with rates among women sig-
nificantly more prominent than men ( interac-
tion=0.05; Wald 2
1
=5.0; P interaction=.03). There were
no differences in the prevalence of anxiety disorders with
increasing age by race or ethnicity.
COMORBID MOOD-ANXIETY DISORDER
12-MONTH AGE-SPECIFIC PREVALENCE
With regard to comorbid mood-anxiety disorder, the
overall 12-month prevalence rate was 3% (Table 2).
The 12-month rates for comorbid disorder showed a
general decline with age (55 years and older). The
Figure, C portrays a similar decreasing prevalence pat-
tern by sex for the diagnosis of 12-month comorbid
mood-anxiety disorder across age groups, with no sta-
tistically significant difference between women and
men (P interaction=.22).

adults 55 years and older. There are 3 key findings in the
present study: (1) declining prevalence with age; (2) rates
of anxiety disorders as high as mood disorders; and (3)
the common co-occurrence of these disorders. Rates were
generally higher for women in each age group but did
not vary by race or ethnicity.
The first and general finding from our study was the
overall trend found for adults of increasing age--a gen-
eral decline in the 12-month prevalence of mood, anxi-
ety, and comorbid disorders. Statistically, prevalence rates
with increasing age were more prominent for 12-month
rates among women compared with men (P.05). Ear-
lier studies of both clinical and community-based stud-
ies suggest such a pattern of decline with age.6,10,34 The
ECA found a consistent trend of lower DSM mental dis-
orders in late life when grouping age categories to-
gether. Work by Gum et al20 found a similar trend in the
NCS-R with lower rates in older adults (65 years) vs
younger adults (aged 18-64 years). Recent international
research by Kohn and colleagues35 found the same de-
creasing pattern with age in a sample of adults from Latin
America. Further, studies have found women to have
higher prevalence rates of symptoms of depression, anxi-
ety, and coexisting depression-anxiety than men, while
racial differences are less consistent.16-18 Our study found
no statistically significant difference across race/
ethnicity; however, small cell counts for minority groups
equated to lower power to detect a difference.
The second key finding was that rates of anxiety dis-
orders were as high or even higher (with pooled rates
higher; overall 12-month rate, 12%) than mood disor-
ders (overall 12-month rate, 5%). The age-specific rates
of anxiety were higher than mood disorders in each age
group, with 12-month rates 17% for those aged 55 to 64
years (vs 8% for mood) and 8% for those 85 years and
older (vs 2% for mood). Similarly, anxiety disorders were
the most prevalent disorders among those 65 years and
older in the ECA, with phobic disorder the most preva-
lent individual disorder.10 Interestingly, we found high
prevalence of specific and social phobias, disorders not
often investigated and often underappreciated. Unlike our
study, the Longitudinal Aging Study Amsterdam deter-
mined high rates of generalized anxiety disorder (7.3%
vs 2.0% in our study).36 This discrepancy between re-
ported prevalence rates highlights largely methodologi-
cal differences (eg, sampling procedures and attrition rates,
definition and operationalization of anxiety) and poten-
tial cultural differences between population-based stud-
ies. Most studies of anxiety disorders among US older
adults have been examined relative to their occurrence
in patients with depression. Research by Lenze et al37
found a high rate of at least 1 current (23%) anxiety dis-
order in depressed older adults (60 years) from pri-
mary care and psychiatric settings. Work from our group
investigating anxiety symptoms in a cohort of community-
dwelling older adults (aged 70-79 years) found that 19%
of participants reported current anxiety symptoms, where
women (20%) had higher rates than men (12%)
(P.001).16 Our present findings suggest similar re-
sults with diagnostic anxiety disorders, which are promi-
nent and pervasive in older adults even into the oldest
years.
The third finding was the high rate of coexisting mood
and anxiety disorders in NCS-R respondents (overall 12-
month rate, 3%). Geriatric psychiatry research is strug-
gling to understand the comorbid depression-anxiety out-
comes and treatment needs. Thus far, the impact of
comorbid depression-anxiety is greater than initially es-
timated. Most US studies have been clinically based and,
as mentioned earlier, found high prevalence rates of co-
morbid anxiety in patients with depression.37-39 In con-
trast, the NCS-R's advantage is that it allows the exami-
nation of a nationally representative group, highlighting
the impact of comorbid and individual mood and anxi-
ety disorders in the population. Our results showed that
the co-occurrence of mood and anxiety disorders in the
community was high, common, and significant across age
strata 55 years and older, investigating overall trends as
well as by sex and race/ethnicity.
Investigation of the oldest age cohort (85 years),
which maintained prominent prevalence rates, war-
rants comment. Because individuals 85 years and older
are not always captured in geriatric psychiatric re-
search, the present examination suggests the need for more
research in this group and confronting potential chal-
lenges specific to the study of this group. For example,

the oldest old are less available for study, except in in-
stitutional settings, and experience heterogeneity of
comorbid diseases, creating difficult study of pure dis-
orders in the population.40 Epidemiological evidence for
age-specific trends of depression in older adults often mea-
sured with the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depres-
sion Scale41 or Geriatric Depression Scale42 has shown an
increase in symptoms in the oldest cohort,1,9,10,40,43 while
in most clinical studies,6,10 rates of diagnosed depres-
sion consistently decline in older age groups. Thus, un-
derstanding diagnostic patterns in the oldest old is com-
plex and requires more investigation than the present
study provides.
In contrast, given the strong effect of cognitive and
physical health as predictors and outcomes of mental
health disorders,1-5 the finding of a general decline in
mood, anxiety, and comorbid mood-anxiety disorders
with age is counterintuitive. Three possible explana-
tions for this general decline with age include (1) co-
hort effect (ie, as the young-old age, they will maintain
higher levels of mental disorders); (2) healthy survivor
bias or differential mortality, institutionalization (ie, those
institutionalized were not sampled); and (3) epidemio-
logical methods and diagnostic issues in assessing older
adults for psychiatric disorders (eg, difficulty remem-
bering symptoms, stigma related to the reporting of men-
tal health disorders, somatic symptoms reported but de-
termined to be related to chronic conditions instead of
mental health disorders).
The strengths of this study include a nationally rep-
resentative probability sample, current DSM diagnostic
assessment, and precise age stratification to define trends
for young-old, mid-old, old-old, and oldest-old cohorts.
This study helps to describe the prevalence of mood, anxi-
ety, and comorbid mood-anxiety disorders in a nation-
ally representative sample of older US adults. It high-
lights those disorders with the greatest potential for
intervention and prevention, research, and services, trans-
lating back into science those diseases with the greatest
potential impact on the older public's health.
The implications of the study findings include the
public health relevance of anxiety disorders in older
adults and the need for more research focused on the
oldest-old age group, women, and minority groups.
Given the high prevalence of anxiety disorders in the
community, the lack of attention in research and pro-
gram policy statements to anxiety disorders in older
adults is disturbing.44,45 The literature has shown that
comorbid anxiety in depressed elderly patients leads
to poorer treatment outcomes than depression alone.38
Thus, the high prevalence of comorbid mood-anxiety
disorders found in our study suggests the modifying
influence of anxiety on antidepressant treatment out-
comes is a serious concern.
The oldest old are the fastest growing age group in the
United States.40 The oldest old are often underrepre-
sented so estimates from community samples have been
difficult to obtain. Because mental disorders are associ-
ated with declining physical health that occurs with fre-
quency in older age,1-5 the assessment of psychiatric dis-
orders is an important indicator of health and increased
risk of mortality in this older population.
In addition, these results expand beyond the field of
geriatric psychiatry, highlighting the importance of di-
agnosis, treatment, and management of psychiatric symp-
toms and disorders in younger years. Given the chronic-
ity of these disorders, preventing their occurrence in later
life implies that clinicians and researchers outside geri-
atrics need to be more vigilant about diagnosis and treat-
ment in early years. These disorders are common in
younger adults and most have early age at onset but of-
ten are not diagnosed or underdiagnosed and under-
treated.21,27
There are 3 main limitations of this study. First, the
NCS-R underrepresents homeless, institutionalized, and
non­English-speaking older adults. Second, there may
be issues of stigma, whereby older adults with mental ill-
ness might be less inclined to participate in a mental health
survey. Third, even though the WMH-CIDI was shown
to have good concordance with the Structured Clinical
Interview for DSM-IV,21 it is still a lay-administered
interview rather than a clinically administered assess-
ment, especially in the context of medical illness, dis-
ability, and cognitive decline. Thus, given these limita-
tions, the estimates herein are probably conservative.
Additional limitations include details associated with
surveying older populations that were not available in
the NCS-R. These include assessment of the response rate
in those 55 years and older and demonstration of accept-
able reliability of the NCS-R instruments for older adults.
Further, the NCS-R was limited in its assessment of mood
disorders, as we were unable to determine prevalence rates
of some disorders that would be considered common in
older adults, eg, depression not otherwise specified, de-
mentia with depression, mood disorders secondary to
medical disorders, adjustment disorders with depres-
sion, and bereavement. Because depression in older adults
may present differently (more apathy, social with-
drawal, irritability), the criteria for a major depression
diagnosis may not be met, although the other symp-
toms may be severe, suggesting an underestimation of
the prevalence rate in NCS-R older adults. This under-
estimation is probably large considering the potential for
reporting bias in older adults due to difficulty recalling
symptoms or difficulty associating symptoms with psy-
chological distress.
The study of nationally representative samples pro-
vides evidence for research and policy planning that
helps to define community-based priorities for future
psychiatric research. The findings of this study empha-
size the importance of individual and coexisting mood
and anxiety disorders when studying older adults,
even the oldest cohorts. Further study of risk factors,
course, and severity is needed to target intervention,
prevention, and health care needs. Given the rapid
aging of the US population, the potential public health
burden of late-life mental health disorders will likely
grow as well, suggesting the importance of continued
epidemiologic monitoring of the mental health status
of the young-old, mid-old, old-old, and oldest-old
cohorts.
