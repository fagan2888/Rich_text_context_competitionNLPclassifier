illicit drug disapproval and illicit drug use among
U.S. high school seniors

Abstract
Background: This study examined associations between perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling, peer illicit drug
disapproval and illicit drug use among a large nationally representative sample of U.S. high school seniors.
Methods: Data come from Monitoring the Future (2007­2011), an annual cross-sectional survey of U.S. high school
seniors. Students reported neighborhood illicit drug selling, friend drug disapproval towards marijuana and cocaine
use, and past 12-month and past 30-day illicit drug use (N = 10,050). Multinomial logistic regression models were fit
to explain use of 1) just marijuana, 2) one illicit drug other than marijuana, and 3) more than one illicit drug other
than marijuana, compared to "no use".
Results: Report of neighborhood illicit drug selling was associated with lower friend disapproval of marijuana and
cocaine; e.g., those who reported seeing neighborhood sales "almost every day" were less likely to report their
friends strongly disapproved of marijuana (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.38, 95% CI: 0.29, 0.49) compared to those
who reported never seeing neighborhood drug selling and reported no disapproval. Perception of neighborhood
illicit drug selling was also associated with past-year drug use and past-month drug use; e.g., those who reported
seeing neighborhood sales "almost every day" were more likely to report 30-day use of more than one illicit drug
(AOR = 11.11, 95% CI: 7.47, 16.52) compared to those who reported never seeing neighborhood drug selling and
reported no 30-day use of illicit drugs.
Conclusions: Perceived neighborhood drug selling was associated with lower peer disapproval and more illicit
drug use among a population-based nationally representative sample of U.S. high school seniors. Policy interventions
to reduce "open" (visible) neighborhood drug selling (e.g., problem-oriented policing and modifications to the physical
environment such as installing and monitoring surveillance cameras) may reduce illicit drug use and peer disapproval
of illicit drugs.

Background
National estimates show that approximately 45.5% of
U.S. high school seniors report using marijuana one or
more times during their life, over a third (36.4%) report
using in the past 12 months, and almost one-quarter
(22.7%) report using marijuana one or more times dur-
ing the past 30 days [1]. Use of other illicit drugs is less
prevalent. For example, 4.5% of U.S. high school seniors
report ever using cocaine one or more times during their
life, 2.6% report using in the past 12 months, and 1.1%
report using cocaine one or more times during the past
30 days [1]. Drug use in adolescence (especially late ado-
lescence) is associated with increased risk for drug use
disorders as well as other health and social problems
such as school failure and sexually transmitted infections
including HIV [2-4].
For decades, drug use research has focused largely on
individual (e.g., gender), family (e.g., family support) and

peer (e.g., peer groups) factors in explaining illicit drug
use; however, unexplained variance exists [5]. A rela-
tively under-explored aspect of risk factors for illicit
drug use is one's neighborhood. Social epidemiology re-
search shows that neighborhood environments can play
a significant role in drug use [5,6]. For example, previous
studies have examined associations between neighbor-
hood socio-demographic characteristics (e.g., neighbor-
hood poverty) and illicit drug use [7-14]. In addition,
prior research shows that exposure to neighborhood vio-
lence and crime is associated with illicit drug use [15-17].
Using and analyzing aggregate measures of neighborhood
social disorder (including neighborhood drug selling as a
component), some other studies have found a relationship
between neighborhood social disorder and illicit drug use
behaviors [16,18-20]. A recent study by Epstein and col-
leagues (2014) showed that neighborhood-level drug activ-
ity and social disorder were associated with heroin and
cocaine craving among drug misusers [21].
The use of aggregate measures of neighborhood dis-
order is described in the sociology and public health lit-
erature including studies from the Project on Human
Development in Chicago Neighborhoods (PHDCN) [22-26].
Multidimensional measures of social disorder are based on
Raudenbush's ecometric theory, i.e., the reliability of a scale
improves as you observe multiple indicators, as opposed to
single indicators [27]. In addition, the indicators are often
clustered with each other and tend to co-occur. PHDCN
measures of social disorder (based on ecometrics) are ap-
plied to indicators obtained from systematic social ob-
servation. However, when measuring a single individual's
evaluation of neighborhood characteristics (as opposed to
using systematic social observation) it is may not be
necessary to apply aggregate measures of neighbor-
hood characteristics (e.g. neighborhood disorder) [28].
In addition to neighborhood drug selling, aggregate
measures of neighborhood social disorder often in-
clude the following other components: individuals drink-
ing alcohol in public, individuals using or being addicted
to drugs, unemployed individuals hanging out in the
streets, and prostitutes on the street [22,29].
While informative, the previous research on the role
of neighborhood factors and illicit drug use has typically
not explicitly and specifically examined neighborhood
illicit drug selling, a potentially important factor in illicit
drug use on its own. Neighborhood illicit drug selling is
a distinctive indicator of neighborhood social disorder
that may be amenable to policy. We recognize that com-
posite measures (e.g., of neighborhood social disorder)
can be important, but might diminish the importance of
any one individual component and might be less trans-
ferable to policymakers [30-32] (as studies usually use
and analyze aggregate measures of neighborhood social
disorder--not stratifying by the myriad social disorder
components such as neighborhood drug selling) [16,18-20].
Further, while previous research on neighborhood factors
and illicit drug use has used a variety of methods to
categorize neighborhood factors (e.g., survey, geographic in-
formation systems [GIS]), additional research is needed to
examine perceptions of neighborhood characteristics, which
may be more closely linked to health and behavior than ob-
jectively measured neighborhood characteristics. It is also
important to note that, based on our review of the accumu-
lated literature, most previous research on neighborhood
factors in illicit drug use has used non-representative local
populations, which limits generalizability. We also note that
neighborhood factors might not only influence illicit drug
use, but drug-related attitudes. Previous studies have exam-
ined demographic (e.g., age) and behavioral (e.g., drug use)
correlates of peer drug-related attitudes such as peer illicit
drug disapproval [33,34], however, to our knowledge, studies
have not examined the effect of neighborhood characteris-
tics on peer drug-related attitudes and thus represents a
critical gap in the literature. Importantly, sociological
and psychological theories, such as Social Norms The-
ory [35] and the Theory of Planned Behavior [36], sug-
gest that neighborhood illicit drug selling could be
associated with peer illicit drug disapproval. In addition,
disapproval and stigmatization towards illicit drug use has
previously been shown to be an important correlate of
illicit drug use [37]. Research on how perceived neigh-
borhood drug selling relates to both use and (peer) at-
titudes towards use would add to the literature as
there is a lack of information whether perception of
neighborhood drug selling is a risk factor for use. Po-
tential mechanisms linking neighborhood drug selling
and drug use could be availability of drugs, perceived
normality of use, and perhaps pressure from drug
dealers to use drugs. In addition, neighborhood drug
selling and concomitant issues (including neighbor-
hood violence) could be stressful and therefore influence
drug use. For example, in the context of neighborhood
stress, adolescents might use marijuana given its well-
established anxiolytic effects.
The primary aim of this study is to examine the asso-
ciation of perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling and
illicit drug use among a large population-based nation-
ally representative sample of U.S. high school seniors.
Because peers (e.g., proportion of school friends using
illicit drugs) can influence illicit drug use among adoles-
cents [38,39], we additionally evaluated the association
of perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling and peer
illicit drug disapproval among the sample. Based on pre-
vious theoretical and empirical research, we hypothe-
sized that perceived neighborhood illicit drug selling
would be associated with higher odds for illicit drug use
and lower peer illicit drug disapproval among our sam-
ple of U.S. high school seniors.

Methods
Data
Monitoring the Future (MTF) is an annual cross-sectional
survey of high school seniors in approximately 130 public
and private schools throughout 48 states in the US [40].
Schools are selected through a multi-stage random sam-
pling procedure: geographic areas are selected, then schools
within areas are selected, and finally students within
schools are selected. MTF assesses content using six
different survey forms, which are distributed randomly.
All forms assess demographic characteristics and drug
use, however, only survey Form 4 assesses perception
of drug selling in one's neighborhood and friend disap-
proval towards use of various drugs. To increase power,
we combined data from the most recent five cohorts
(2007­2011) of data into a single cross-section--consistent
with many previous MTF studies [34,41-48]. MTF proto-
cols were reviewed and approved by the University of
Michigan Institutional Review Board (IRB). We received
IRB approval to examine data on MTF seniors from New
York University School of Medicine.
Neighborhood illicit drug selling
Students were asked, "During the past 12 months, how
often have you seen people selling illegal drugs in your
neighborhood?" Answer options were: 1) "Never", 2) "A
few times a year", 3) "Once or twice a month", 4) "At
least once a week", and 5) "Almost every day". Answers
were coded into indicator variables with "never" as the
comparison.
Peer illicit drug disapproval
Students were asked about their perception of friend dis-
approval towards trying various illicit drugs, including
marijuana and cocaine. To assess disapproval towards
marijuana, students were asked: "How do you think your
close friends feel (or would feel) about you trying marijuana
(pot, weed) once or twice?" Answer options were: 1) "Don't
disapprove," 2) "Disapprove" and 3) "Strongly disapprove."
A similar question was asked with regard to use of cocaine.
These two variables were coded into indicators: "disapprove"
and "strongly disapprove" and "don't disapprove" served as
the comparison.
Past 12-month and past 30-day illicit drug use
MTF asked students about use of various illicit drugs
that occurred within the past 12 months and within the
past 30 days. Students were asked whether they used
marijuana (pot, weed, hashish), and other illicit sub-
stances including cocaine, crack, LSD, hallucinogens
other than LSD, heroin, MDMA (ecstasy, "Molly") and
nonmedical use of narcotics (other than heroin), tran-
quilizers (e.g., benzodiazepines), sedatives (e.g., barbitu-
rates) and amphetamine. We then created a new variable
with four categories (one for 12 month use and one for
30 day use): 1) no illicit drug use, 2) only marijuana use, 3)
use of one illicit drug other than marijuana, and 4) use of
more than one illicit drug other than marijuana. We com-
bined use of multiple drugs into one category as an indica-
tor of drug use severity.
Covariates
Students indicated their age (dichotomized by MTF as
<18 and 18 years), sex (male vs. female), and race/eth-
nicity (defined by MTF as Black, White and Hispanic).
MTF classified population density of students' residences
as non-, small-, or large-metropolitan statistical areas
(MSAs). Small MSAs are defined as counties or groups
of counties with at least one city of 50,000 or more in-
habitants and the 24 largest MSAs are defined as large
MSAs [40]. The remaining areas are defined as non-
MSAs. MTF also assessed level of religious attendance
and importance through two ordinal items. We created
a mean composite of these two items (range: 1­4) and
divided the scores into tertiles representing low (1.0-2.0),
moderate (2.5-3.0) and high (3.5-4.0) religiosity. Students
were also asked about level of educational attainment of
each parent through an ordinal item. We computed a
mean score for both parents (or raw score if only one
parent) and this was further coded into three groups
representing low (1.0-3.0), medium (3.5-4.0), and high
(4.5-6.0) education. Students were also asked to indicate
the number of evenings they usually go out per week for
fun and recreation. We recoded their responses to the
ordinal item into: 1) 0­1 evening(s), 2) 2­3 evenings,
and 3) 4­7 evenings. These covariates were identified a
priori and coding of covariates was based on previous
MTF analyses [43,49-52].
Statistical analyses
Analyses focused on MTF senior students with complete
neighborhood illicit drug selling and peer disapproval data
(Unweighted N = 10,050; Weighted N = 10,089). Some sta-
tistically significant differences between participants with
completed neighborhood illicit drug selling and peer dis-
approval data as compared with the entire sample existed.
However, given the large size of the dataset this is not sur-
prising. Because missing data can be common and prob-
lematic, we evaluated missingness in the covariates. Since
some covariates were missing data (e.g., race/ethnicity
[missing 14.3%], religiosity [missing 23.0%]), we allowed
for covariates to have missing data in the regression
models. In Table 1, we have included the number of miss-
ing values for each covariate: The range of missing data
for our covariates was 0.3% (age) to 23% (religiosity).
These data were missing not at random. We entered miss-
ing data indicators to ensure that these cases were not
deleted. This method has been used in previous MTF
Duncan et al. Substance Abuse Treatment, Prevention, and Policy 2014, 9:35 Page 3 of 9

analyses [42,51-53] to maintain power and representa-
tiveness of the sample. Only 47.4% of the analytic sam-
ple had case-compete data; therefore, deleting cases
with any missing data would have resulted in the list-
wise deletion of more than half the sample, reducing
power and it's national representativeness.
We examined descriptive statistics (e.g., weighted per-
centages) for each covariate and then we fit all variables
into multinomial multivariable logistic regression models
with the four-category drug use variable as the outcome
(one model for 12 month use and another model for
30 day use). The comparison variable for both outcome
variables was "no use." These models determined the
conditional associations of perceived neighborhood drug
selling and peer drug disapproval while controlling for
all other covariates. The predictors in the model explain
use of 1) just marijuana, 2) one illicit drug other than
marijuana, and 3) more than one illicit drug other than
marijuana, compared to "no use," similar to multiple
binary logistic regressions. This way each predictor is as-
sociated with an adjusted odds ratio (AOR) and 95%
confidence interval (CI) for each of the three levels of
the outcome variable. We present AORs and CIs for
perceived neighborhood drug selling and peer disap-
proval. Data indicators for cohort (with year 2007 as the
comparison) were entered into all models to control for
potential cohort effects and/or secular trends. Data were
weighted to adjust for differential probability of selection
of schools and students. All analyses were design-based
for survey data using Taylor series variance estimate
(PROC SURVEYLOGISTIC) [54] and conducted using
SAS 9.3 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).

sample was 18 years old. About half (51.3%) were fe-
male and most (62.3%) were White. Almost 62% of stu-
dents reporting "never" seeing neighborhood drug sales,
and 15.7% reporting seeing neighborhood drug sales "a
few times per year". Almost 60% of the sample reported
that their friends disapprove of marijuana use, of which
35.5% reported that their friends "strongly disapprove".
On the other hand, 90.2% of the sample reported that
their friends disapprove of cocaine use; 72.1% of the
sample reported that their friends "strongly disapprove"
of cocaine.
The majority of the sample reported no past-year illicit
drug use and past-month illicit drug use: 9.9% reported
use of more than one illicit drug in the past 12 months,
and 4.1% reported use of more than one illicit drug in
the past month. The majority of users of illicit drugs
other than marijuana also reported used of marijuana
(data not presented in table). Specifically, for both 12-
month and 30-day users of one illicit drug other than
marijuana, all (100%) also reported 12-month/30-day
use of marijuana. With regard to use of more than one
illicit drug, 66.5% of 12-month users also reported 12-
month use of marijuana, and with respect to 30-day use
of more than one other illicit drug, 58.3% also reported
30-day use of marijuana.
Neighborhood illicit drug selling and peer illicit drug
disapproval
Report of neighborhood illicit drug selling was associ-
ated with lower friend disapproval of marijuana and co-
caine in multivariable models, controlling for socio-
demographic factors/ other covariates (Tables 2 and 3).
For example, those who reported seeing neighborhood
sales "almost every day" were at lower odds of reporting
that friends disapproved (AOR = 0.36, 95% CI: 0.28,
0.47) and strongly disapproved (AOR = 0.38, 95% CI:
0.29, 0.49) of marijuana compared to those who reported
never seeing neighborhood drug selling and reported no
disapproval (Table 2). Similarly, neighborhood illicit drug
selling was associated with lower friend disapproval of co-
caine (Table 3). Those who reported seeing neighborhood
sales "almost every day" were at lower odds of reporting that
their friends disapproved (AOR = 0.57, 95% CI: 0.44, 0.77)
and strongly disapproved (AOR = 0.40, 95% CI: 0.31, 0.52)
of cocaine compared to those who reported never seeing
neighborhood drug selling and reported no disapproval, for
example. In addition, as shown in Tables 2 and 3, odds for
strong friend disapproval towards use of each drug tended
to be more robust (smaller) than non-strong friend disap-
proval ("disapprove"), when significant. Perceiving drug sell-
ing once or more per week (or almost every day) was
significantly (negatively) associated with friend cocaine dis-
approval, but almost all levels of perceived selling in one's
neighborhood were significantly negatively associated with
friend marijuana disapproval.
Neighborhood illicit drug selling and illicit drug use
The multivariable associations between neighborhood
illicit drug selling and past-year drug use are reported in
Table 4, controlling for socio-demographic factors/other
covariates and peer disapproval of illicit drugs. Those
who reported seeing neighborhood sales "almost every
day" were more likely to report 12-month use of marijuana
(AOR = 2.31, 95% CI: 1.74, 3.09), 12-month use of one
illicit drug (AOR = 2.70, 95% CI: 1.88, 3.89), and 12-month
use of more than one illicit drug (AOR = 6.19, 95% CI:
4.43, 8.64) compared to those who reported never seeing
neighborhood drug selling and reported no 12-month use
of illicit drugs. Those who reported seeing neighborhood
sales "almost every day" were more likely to report 30-day
use of marijuana (AOR = 3.58, 95% CI: 2.74, 4.67), 30-day
use of one illicit drug (AOR = 3.91, 95% CI: 2.69, 5.70), and
30-day use of more than one illicit drug (AOR = 11.11, 95%
CI: 7.47, 16.52) compared to those who reported never
seeing neighborhood drug selling (Table 5). In addition, as
shown in Tables 4 and 5, the effects of reporting

neighborhood selling of illicit drugs was stronger for past
30-day use of illicit drugs and strongest for those who used
more drugs. With regard to 12-month use, all levels of per-
ceived neighborhood drug selling tended to be associated
with higher odds of only marijuana use than use of only
one other illicit drug; however, odds tended to be much
higher for use of multiple other illicit drugs (Table 4). With
respect to 30-day use, the more frequent the witnessing of
neighborhood drug selling, the higher the odds for drug
use (Table 5). Odds also increased accordingly for use of
more illicit drugs other than marijuana (e.g., frequent ex-
posure to selling was associated with increased odds of
only marijuana use, even higher odds for other illicit drug
use, and much higher odds for use of multiple other illicit
drugs in the past 30 days) (Tables 4 and 5).
Discussion
Adolescence is an important developmental period for the
initiation of illicit drugs [4,55,56]. In this study, among a
population-based nationally representative sample of U.S.
high school seniors, we found that perception of neighbor-
hood illicit drug selling was associated both with illicit
drug use and peer disapproval of illicit drugs. Specifically,
report of neighborhood illicit drug selling was associated
with lower peer disapproval and more illicit drug use.
Furthermore, increased frequency of witnessing neighbor-
hood drug-dealing is associated with "more severe" use
(e.g., more recent use, use of drugs "harder" than
marijuana and multiple illicit drugs). In addition, we found
that increased frequency of witnessing drug selling was as-
sociated with lower levels of friend disapproval toward use
of marijuana and cocaine. Disapproval (self-, peer-, and
perceived societal disapproval) has previously been found
to be a robust protective factor against drug use
[34,37,57-60]. These findings suggest that increased
frequency of witnessing drug selling in one's neighbor-
hood is associated with lowered friend disapproval toward
marijuana, but much higher frequency of witnessing drug
selling was needed in order for students to report signifi-
cantly lower friend disapproval toward cocaine. Marijuana
is the least stigmatized or disapproved illicit drug and
cocaine use is more heavily stigmatized [37]. For ex-
ample, 42.1% of young adults (age 23­26) disapprove
of an adult trying marijuana, but 86.0% of young adults
disapprove of an adult trying cocaine [61]. While use
of a drug is generally associated with decreased disap-
proval or stigma toward use [34,37], these findings add
to our understanding in that witnessing drug selling in
one's neighborhood is also associated with decreases in
friend drug disapproval.

Our study adds to the burgeoning literature on the
role of the neighborhood social context on illicit drug
use among adolescents. By and large, our findings are
consistent with existing studies evaluating the role of
neighborhood environments in illicit drug use [16,18-20].
However, because aggregate measures of neighborhood
social disorder include other factors such as alcohol use,
drug use, drug addiction, and prostitution, it is unclear
whether multiple aspects of neighborhood social disorder
are simultaneously needed to detect significant effects on
illicit drug use. While multiple aspects of social disorder
may contribute to illicit drug use, aggregate measures ob-
scure the importance of any one particular aspect on illicit
drug use. To our knowledge, this is the first study to
examine the effect of a neighborhood characteristic on
peer drug attitudes and thus our study provides a new
contribution to the literature.
There are a variety of potential explanations for our
study findings. First, neighborhood characteristics such as
neighborhood drug selling may influence social norms,
which, in turn, may influence perception of drug use and
abuse and ones use and abuse of drugs [37]. Indeed, it is
possible that individuals begin to become desensitized to
drug use when they frequently witness drug sales. When
drug use or drug selling becomes somewhat of a normal-
ized activity in one's view it thus seems that disapproval
towards use decreases, leaving individuals at higher risk
for drug use. Second, neighborhood drug selling and con-
comitant issues (including neighborhood violence) might be
also stressful and therefore influence drug use [7,16,62,63].
Third, witnessing drug selling may also be an indicator of
drug availability in one's neighborhood, potentially leading
to use and abuse of drugs. For instance, exposure to users
and familiarity with users has previously been found to be
robust risk factors for drug use [60,64]. Furthermore, neigh-
borhood drug dealers might pressure purchase of drugs and
drug use among adolescents as well as other community
members. Students reporting neighborhood drug selling
may be more likely to know the drug dealers, notice selling,
or even purchase or sell drugs themselves. In addition to
confirming findings from our study in other samples, future
research should identify mechanisms through which neigh-
borhood drug selling might contribute to increases in illicit
drug use among adolescents, including the influence of
neighborhood drug selling on social norms. Future stud-
ies should also examine temporal associations, which
are needed to more carefully examine the direction of
association.
Findings from this study may be relevant to practice and
policy, including the potential need for neighborhood-
level policy changes. Empirical evidence from the crimin-
ology and public health literature shows that drug-related
crime can be decreased by modifying the social and
physical neighborhood environment through a variety
of strategies [65-68]. Policies monitoring illicit drugs
may reduce the availability of illicit drugs and therefore
reduce neighborhood drug selling. For example, local
police attention in "hot spots" or areas common for neigh-
borhood drug selling (known as problem-oriented po-
licing) may be a useful strategy for reducing "open"
(visible) neighborhood drug selling [65,66,68]. In addition,
adjustments to the physical environment (e.g., installing
and monitoring surveillance cameras and landscaping
trees and shrubs) might also prove to be beneficial in re-
ducing open neighborhood drug selling [67,68]. It should
be noted that even in states where marijuana use is decri-
minalized, sales and use in "public view" are still illegal
[69]. Our study demonstrates the role of neighborhood
factors in shaping drug use among adolescents, and past
evidence showing the effectiveness neighborhood-oriented
policing approaches suggests that neighborhood-level pol-
icy changes may help reduce illicit drug use among this
population.
Limitations
First, we recognize that reverse causality is a possibility:
individuals who used illicit drugs may report higher rates
of neighborhood drug sales. As these are cross-sectional
data, temporal ambiguity is a concern; longitudinal study
designs are needed to provide evidence of temporal
ordering. Additionally, natural experiments or policy
changes (e.g., police efforts targeting neighborhood
drug selling) could be evaluated and would provide
the strongest evidence for causality. As previously
discussed, neighborhood-level factors can be mea-
sured in a variety of ways, including objectively via
systematic social observation [70]. In this study, only
self-reported information on one neighborhood factor
(i.e., neighborhood illicit drug selling) was available to
us. Therefore, same-source bias (also known as shared-
observer bias) might be an issue, as the exposure (per-
ceived neighborhood illicit drug selling) and the outcomes
(peer attitudes towards illicit drug and illicit drug use)
were all assessed via self-report [71,72]. Because self-
reported drug use information was collected, there
might be some misclassification, in part due to social
desirability bias. We recognize that we examined per-
ception of one's residential neighborhood, which is only
one neighborhood context. Spatial polygamy asserts that
people experience and interact with multiple neighbor-
hood environments, which can influence their health and
health behavior including drug use behaviors [73,74].
Because high school students spend significant amount
of time at school [75], their school neighborhood en-
vironment may influence drug use behaviors. While we
controlled for several confounding factors, residual con-
founding may also be a concern (e.g., we were unable to
control for neighborhood poverty, residential stability and

residential selection because these variables where not in-
cluded in the survey). Finally, missing data (especially
14.3% missing for race/ethnicity and 23.0% missing for re-
ligiosity, with data missing not at random) is somewhat
problematic. However, to maintain power and representa-
tiveness we included missing data indicators for covariates
in all analyses.
Conclusion
We found that perceived neighborhood drug selling was
associated with lower peer disapproval of illicit drugs and
more illicit drug use among a population-based nationally
representative sample of U.S. high school seniors. Policy
interventions to reduce "open" (visible) neighborhood
drug selling (e.g., problem-oriented policing and modifica-
tions to the physical environment such as installing and
monitoring surveillance cameras) may reduce illicit drug
use and peer disapproval of illicit drugs.
