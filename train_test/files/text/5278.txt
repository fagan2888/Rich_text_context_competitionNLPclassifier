Introduction
Osteoprotegerin (OPG), a member of the tumor necrosis
factor superfamily, is involved in pathological processes
including bone remodeling, vascular inflammation and
arterial calcification. OPG acts as a decoy receptor for the
receptor activator of nuclear factor-b ligand (RANKL)
and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-related apoptosis-induc-
ing ligand (TRAIL), regulates bone remodeling and
applies antiapoptotic effects on endothelial cells, protect-
ing them against TRAIL-induced cell death.1­3 OPG, one
of the major players in the balance between bone forma-
tion and bone resorption, exerts osteoprotective effects by
inhibiting osteoclast differentiation and activation and pro-
moting osteoclast apoptosis. However, in the clinical set-
ting, the association between OPG and bone mineral
density (BMD) as well as fragility fractures remains con-
troversial. Increased OPG levels have been associated with
higher BMD of the lumbar spine in men and total body
BMD in women,4,5 whereas in other studies a negative cor-
relation or no correlation was found.6,7 Recently, OPG has
appeared to represent the molecular link between bone
resorption and vascular calcification. Elevated serum OPG
levels have been reported in patients with coronary artery
disease and carotid atherosclerosis; further, increased OPG
levels were positively associated with severity of vascular

Abstract
Introduction: The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) has recently been considered as a possible link between
bone and vascular disease. The present study was designed to determine the effect of the angiotensin II receptor blocker
candesartan on circulating osteoprotegerin (OPG) in hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
Material and methods: A total of 69 hypertensive patients were randomized to two groups: Group 1 included
patients treated with oral candesartan in doses of 16 mg to 32 mg per day in addition to routine standard of care (routine
care + ARB), and Group 2 included patients who received routine standard of care other than ARBs or ACEIs, with
no change to their treatment (routine care). Patients were evaluated for lipid profile, HbA1C, insulin, C-peptide, CRP,
aldosterone, renin, homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) and OPG.
Results: Baseline OPG levels did not differ significantly by treatment group. Post-treatment serum OPG levels were
marginally lower in Group1 compared with Group 2; however, this decrease did not reach statistical significance
(p = 0.077).
Conclusions: In the present study, treatment with the ARB candesartan had no significant effect on circulating OPG
levels in hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk factors. To the best of our knowledge, the present study
is the first to estimate an effect of candesartan on bone remodeling marker such as OPG.

damage, atherosclerosis progression as well as with inci-
dent cardiovascular disease and mortality.8­10
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS),
playing an integral role in cardiovascular homeostasis, has
recently been considered as a possible link between bone
and vascular disease. One of the final mediators of the
RAAS cascade, angiotensin II (Ang II), indirectly pro-
motes the differentiation and activation of osteoclasts
through the upregulation of the activator RANKL in osteo-
blasts as well as stimulation of RANKL expression in
osteoblasts and thereby osteoclastogenesis.11,12 Ang II may
also influence calcium metabolism by decreasing ionized
calcium and increasing the parathyroid hormone level.13
Although previous studies have shown that interruption of
the RAAS with angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors
(ACEIs) is effective in increasing BMD and reduces the
risk of fractures,14,15 the results of trials evaluating effect
of Ang II antagonist on bone metabolism are limited and
equivocal. It has been shown that administration of an Ang
II antagonist, losartan, had no effect on bone metabolism
in normal rats,16 whereas another Ang II type 1 receptor
blocker, olmesartan, ameliorates osteoclastogenesis
through down-regulation of RANKL expression and
improves bone density in ovariectomized spontaneously
hypertensive rats.17 Differences in the affinity to the Ang II
receptor as well as different immune and inflammatory
effect may explain this variability.
The present study was designed to determine the effect
of the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) candesartan
on circulating OPG levels in hypertensive patients with
multiple cardiovascular risk factors.
Materials and methods
Participants
In the present study, 69 hypertensive patients were
recruited from the outpatient clinic and evaluated for the
study. Patients included in the study were stabilized on
their previous medical treatment in the outpatient clinic
for up to three months before entrance to the study, with
an effort to minimize treatment change during the study.
To optimize control of hypertension, individual medical
advice was given to every patient at the beginning and
offered throughout the duration of the study. Oral antihy-
pertensive therapy, other than ARBs or ACEIs, was per-
mitted in both groups. Following a three-month
stabilization period, which included a washout period,
all patients were consecutively randomized to two
groups: Group 1 included patients treated with oral can-
desartan in doses of 16­32 mg per day in addition to
routine standard of care (routine care + ARB), and Group
2 included patients receiving routine standard of care
other than ARBs or ACEIs, with no change to their treat-
ment (routine care).
Of the 69 patients recruited to the study, 67 completed
the six-month treatment period (45 patients from Group 1
and 22 from Group 2).
Patients suspected of secondary hypertension, with
history of major disease or surgery within the six months
preceding entrance to the study, were excluded. Patients
with hemodynamic instability, unbalanced endocrine
disease, and any disease that might affect absorption of
medications were excluded, as were patients with plasma
creatinine > 2 mg/dl, elevation of liver enzymes to more
than twice the upper normal limit and electrolyte
abnormalities.
Biochemical parameters
Blood sampling for full chemistry and metabolic parame-
ters, including total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein
(HDL) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, tri-
glycerides, fasting glucose, HbA1C, c-peptide, insulin,
and C-reactive protein (CRP), aldosterone and plasma
renin activity were performed at baseline and at the end of
the study. Samples for serum aldosterone and plasma renin
activity were collected in a sitting position and measured
using commercially available radioimmunoassay
(DiaSorin, Italy, catalog number REF CA1533). The lower
limits of the serum aldosterone and plasma renin activity
were 0.6 ng/dl and 0.1 ng/ml/h, respectively. The samples
were measured in duplicate.
Serum OPG levels were determined by enzyme-linked
immunosorbent assay (BioVendor). The intra- and interas-
say coefficients of variation for OPG were 2.4%­7.0 %
and 3.4%­7.4%, respectively.
Homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance
(HOMA-IR) was calculated by the following formula:
fasting plasma insulin (mU/ml) × fasting plasma glucose
(mg/dl)/405.
Statistical analysis
Analysis of data was carried out using SPSS 9.0 statisti-
cal analysis software (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL, USA,
1999). For continuous variables, such as hemodynamic,
biochemistry and arterial elasticity parameters, descrip-
tive statistics were calculated and reported as mean ±
standard deviation. Normalcy of distribution of continu-
ous variables was assessed using the Kolmogorov-
Smirnov test (cutoff at p = 0.01). Categorical variables
such as sex and comorbidities were described using fre-
quency distributions and are presented as frequency (%).
Continuous variables were simultaneously across visits
by group using GLM repeated-measures analysis.
Significant differences were compared using the t-test
for independent samples. Within a given treatment
group, the Friedman test or GLM repeated-measures
analysis was used to compare differences across visits,
Oz et al. 549
followed post hoc by the t-test for paired samples of the
Wilcoxon signed ranks test as appropriate. Categorical
variables were compared between groups using the chi-
square test. All tests are two sided and considered sig-
nificant at p < 0.05.
Results
Clinical characteristics of the study groups are present in
Table 1. As can be seen the two groups were similar with
respect to age, gender distribution, presence of cardiovas-
cular risk factors, concomitant medications, baseline blood
pressure level and baseline OPG levels.
Between-group comparisons
Table 1 shows that both groups of patients were similar at
baseline in terms of hemodynamic, metabolic and inflam-
matory parameters. There were no significant differences
between the two groups in terms of systolic (SBP) as well
as diastolic blood pressure (DBP) at baseline and after six
months of treatment. Baseline OPG levels did not differ
significantly by treatment group. However, post-treatment
serum OPG levels were marginally lower in patients
treated with candesartan compared with the routine care
group (96.9±47.8 vs 129.2±34.5 mmol/l, p = 0.077)
(Figure 1).
Baseline metabolic and inflammatory parameters
including lipids, fasting insulin, C-peptide, and CRP did
not differ significantly between the groups. After the six-
month treatment period, no significant difference in these
parameters was detected by group. Serum creatinine and
electrolytes levels did not differ significantly between the
groups at baseline and at the end of the study.
Changes in hemodynamic and
metabolic parameters in hypertensive
patients treated with candesartan
Table 2 shows hemodynamic and metabolic parameters in
hypertensive patients treated with candesartan for six
months. SBP decreased significantly from 151.5±18.3 at
baseline to 129.5±12.8 mmHg after six months of treat-
ment (p < 0.0001). DBP decreased significantly during the

Discussion
In the present study, treatment with the ARB candesartan
had no significant effect on circulating OPG levels in
hypertensive patients with multiple cardiovascular risk
factors. To the best of our knowledge, the present study is
the first to estimate an effect of candesartan on a bone
remodeling marker such as OPG.
Experimental, clinical and epidemiological evidence
has shown that the RAAS plays an integral role in bone
remodeling.
Using a chimeric model of transgenic hypertensive
mouse expressing both the human renin as well as angio-
tensinogen genes, it has been shown that activation of the
RAAS induces high turnover osteoporosis with acceler-
ated bone resorption.11 Ex vivo cultures showed that Ang
II increased osteoclastogenesis-supporting cytokines,
RANKL and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
thereby stimulating the formation of osteoclasts. There
have been several reports on the effects of Ang II on bone
cell function in vitro, including inhibition of osteoblastic
differentiation and mineralization, stimulation of prolifer-
ation and collagen synthesis in osteoblasts, and stimulation
of osteoclastic bone resorption.12,18,19 Furthermore, it was
shown that ACEIs were effective in increasing BMD in
women with the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE)
DD polymorphism, which is associated with increased
serum Ang II.20 However, ACEIs also regulate the brady-
kinin-nitric oxide (NO) pathway as well as block Ang II
production, different from ARBs. It is well known that the
NO pathway regulates local blood flow in bone marrow
capillaries, which might enhance bone marrow formation.
Thus, the contribution of the NO pathway might have a
role in the prevention of osteoporosis by ACE inhibition.
The results of trials evaluating the effect of Ang II
antagonist on bone metabolism are equivocal. It has been
shown that administration of an Ang II antagonist, losar-
tan, had no effect on bone metabolism in normal rats,16
whereas other Ang II type 1 receptor blocker, olmesartan,
ameliorates osteoclastogenesis through down-regulation
of RANKL expression and improves bone density in ova-
riectomized spontaneously hypertensive rats.17 Alterations

in the affinity to the Ang II receptor of the different repre-
sentativeARBs may explain this variability.AmongARBs,
olmesartan has been reported to show the highest level of
binding with the Ang II type 1 receptor and, thus, has a
stronger and more sustained hypotensive effect than that of
the other ARBs. Moreover, the inhibitory effect of olme-
sartan on albuminuria was prominent and not affected by
the dosing time, because olmesartan exhibits a strong anti-
hypertensive effect that is sustained for 24 hours.
Furthermore, additional properties such as reduction in
oxidative stress, stimulation of adipogenesis with subse-
quent improvement in glucose transport and reduction in
expression of proinflammatory vascular cell adhesion
molecules, CRP and cytokines are different despite similar
blood-lowering effects of various ARBs.17,21,22
Another important observation in our study is the
increase of CRP levels observed in the placebo group but
not in the candesartan group. The pre-and post-treatment
comparison of serum CRP levels was a secondary analysis
and follows the statement that the between-group differ-
ence was not significant. Nevertheless, we think that the
increase in CRP levels observed in the placebo group but
not in the active treatment group is of interest. The findings
of the present study concur with previous experimental and
clinical trials that have demonstrated anti-inflammatory
properties of ARBs. Recently published data evaluated the
effect of two different classes of antihypertensive agents,
valsartan and amlodipine, on CRP as well as osteopontin
(OPN), a pleiotropic cytokine that has recently emerged as
a key factor in vascular remodeling and is regulated by the
RAAS. The significant reduction of OPN levels was cor-
related with the reduction of CRP levels, and the use of
valsartan as well as reduction of CRP were independent
determinants of the reduction of OPN.23 Moreover, it has
been shown that treatment with olmesartan as a mono-ther-
apy as well as co-therapy with pravastatin resulted in a
highly significant decrease of circulating levels of OPN in
a large cohort of patients with essential hypertension,
whereas OPN levels were correlated with a panel of adhe-
sion molecules and inflammation markers such as interleu-
kin-6 (IL-6), vascular cell adhesion protein 1 (VCAM-1),
intercellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1) and high-
sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP).24
The present study has several limitations. We included
a relatively small number of participants, and larger stud-
ies are required to establish the impact of the RAAS block-
ade on bone metabolism as well as bone density and
fractures rates to demonstrate the overall clinical impact of
RAAS blockade in different populations, especially
patients at increased risk for osteoporosis.
Additionally, since the present study focused on OPG
assessment, the effect of candesartan treatment on differ-
ent bone remodeling markers such as OPN as well as
RANKL and TRAIL expression will need to be evaluated
by long-term studies in a hypertensive population.
In conclusion, significant changes in circulating OPG
levels in hypertensive patients treated with the ARB can-
desartan were not observed. The findings of the present
