THE CURRENT RECOMMENDA-
tions for diagnosis of diabetes
emphasize measurement of
fasting plasma glucose1 and are
based on studies of plasma glucose mea-
sured in the morning after an over-
night fast of at least 8 hours. However,
many patients are seen by their physi-
cians in the afternoon in an uncertain
state of fasting; moreover, plasma glu-
cose has been observed to be higher in
the morning.2,3 Thus, it is unclear
whether the current diagnostic crite-
ria for diabetes can be applied to pa-
tients examined in the afternoon. We
investigated this issue in a large, popu-
lation-based survey of adults not known
to have diabetes.
METHODS
The Third National Health and Nutri-
tionExaminationSurvey(NHANESIII)4
was conducted between1988 and 1994,
and included a representative sample of
the US population. Participants were in-
terviewed for sociodemographic infor-
mation, medical history, and lifestyle
characteristics, then randomly assigned
to either a morning or afternoon exami-
nation that included anthropometric
measurements and phlebotomy. Those
assigned to the morning examination
were asked to not eat or drink anything
other than water after 8:30 PM the day
preceding the examination. Those ex-
aminedintheearlyafternoonwereasked
to eat breakfast but to not eat or drink
anything other than water after 7:30 AM
the day of the examination. Those ex-
amined in the late afternoon were asked
to eat lunch but to not eat or drink any-
thing other than water after 11:30 AM.
The survey included 18825 sub-
jects, aged 20 years or older. We ex-
cluded those who had a prior diagno-
sis of diabetes or were pregnant
(n=1827), did not have plasma glu-
cose measured (n=2288), or who at-

Context Current diagnostic criteria for diabetes are based on plasma glucose levels
in blood samples obtained in the morning after an overnight fast, with a value of 7.0
mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or more indicating diabetes. However, many patients are seen
by their physicians in the afternoon. Because plasma glucose levels are higher in the
morning, it is unclear whether these diagnostic criteria can be applied to patients who
are tested for diabetes in the afternoon.
Objectives To document diurnal variation in fasting plasma glucose levels in adults
not known to have diabetes, and to examine the applicability to afternoon-examined
patients of the current diagnostic criteria for diabetes.
Design, Setting, and Participants Analysis of data from the US population­
based Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (1988-1994) on par-
ticipants aged 20 years or older who had no previously diagnosed diabetes, who were
randomly assigned to morning (n=6483) or afternoon (n=6399) examinations, and
who fasted prior to blood sampling.
Main Outcome Measures Fasting plasma glucose levels in morning- vs afternoon-
examined participants; diabetes diagnostic value for afternoon-examined participants.
Results The morning and afternoon groups did not differ in age, body mass index,
waist-to-hip ratio, physical activity index, glycosylated hemoglobin level, and other fac-
tors. Mean (SD) fasting plasma glucose levels were higher in the morning group (5.41
[0.01] mmol/L [97.4 {0.3} mg/dL]) than in the afternoon group (5.12 [0.02] mmol/L
[92.4 {0.4} mg/dL]; P.001). Consequently, prevalence of afternoon-examined par-
ticipants with fasting plasma glucose levels of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater was
half that of participants examined in the morning. The diagnostic fasting plasma glu-
cose value for afternoon-examined participants that resulted in the same prevalence of
diabetesfoundinmorning-examinedparticipantswas6.33mmol/L(114mg/dL)orgreater.
Conclusions Our results indicate that if current diabetes diagnostic criteria are ap-
plied to patients seen in the afternoon, approximately half of all cases of undiagnosed
diabetes in these patients will be missed.

tended an examination session other
than that to which they were assigned
(n=617), as well as morning subjects
who fasted fewer than 8 hours and af-
ternoon subjects who fasted fewer than
4 hours (n=1211). Median fasting time
for those examined in the morning
(n=6483) was 13.5 hours; 82% fasted
12 through 16 hours. Median fasting
time for those examined in the after-
noon (n=6399) was 7.0 hours; 76%
fasted 4 through 10 hours.
Morning and afternoon blood
samples were collected and processed
identically. Whole blood was col-
lected in vacuum tubes containing po-
tassium oxalate and sodium fluoride
and centrifuged immediately at 1500g
for 10 minutes. Plasma was frozen at
-70°C until analysis. Plasma glucose
was measured using a hexokinase ref-
erence method (Roche Diagnostics,
Montclair, NJ). The coefficient of varia-
tion for this method was 1.6% at a glu-
cose concentration of 5.5 mmol/L (100
mg/dL), and 1.8% for a glucose con-
centration of 27.8 mmol/L (500 mg/dL).
Fasting plasma glucose levels were used
to define undiagnosed diabetes (7.0
mmol/L [126 mg/dL]) and impaired
fasting glucose (6.1-6.9 mmol/L [110-
125 mg/dL]).1
Statisticalanalyseswerecarriedoutus-
ing SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC) with
survey sampling weights. Tests of sta-
tistical significance were calculated us-
ing SUDAAN (Research Triangle Insti-
tute,ResearchTrianglePark,NC).Means
were compared using 2-tailed t tests.
Trends were tested using linear regres-
sion with continuous values for the in-
dependentvariables.Fastingglucosewas
log-transformed because of its skewed
distribution. The protocol was re-
viewed and approved by the institu-
tional review board of the National Cen-
ter for Health Statistics, and informed
consent was obtained from all partici-
pants.
RESULTS
Subjects examined in the morning and
afternoon were similar in age, sex, race,
parental history of diabetes, body mass
index, waist-to-hip ratio, physical ac-
tivity, smoking status, alcohol intake,
education, use of medications that may
affect glucose levels, and glycosylated
hemoglobin levels (TABLE).

ues were more stable and were similar
to late-morning levels (P=.57). Length
offast(morning8hours;afternoon4
hours) was not an important factor. In
morning subjects, there was a nonsig-
nificant increase in mean plasma glu-
cose from 5.38 mmol/L (97.0 mg/dL) in
those who fasted 8 through 12 hours to
5.40 mmol/L (97.3 mg/dL) in those who
fasted 16 hours or more. In afternoon
subjects, there was a clinically insignifi-
cant decrease from 5.13 mmol/L (92.5
mg/dL) in those who fasted 4 through 8
hours, to 5.06 mmol/L (91.2 mg/dL) in
those who fasted 12 hours or more.
Fasting plasma glucose increased
with age, but morning subjects had
higher glucose values at every age com-
pared with afternoon subjects, with an
overall mean difference of 0.28 mmol/L
(5.0 mg/dL) (P.001). Consequently,
prevalence in afternoon subjects of glu-
cose values indicating diabetes (1.4%)
was one half that of morning subjects
(2.8%). Prevalence of glucose values in-
dicating impaired fasting glucose in af-
ternoon subjects (2.6%) was one third
that of morning subjects (7.4%). There
was no statistically significant trend by
age in these disease prevalence ratios
(P.50), even though prevalence of
both conditions increased markedly
with increasing age. For example,
among those aged 60 years or older, the
prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes in
morning subjects was 7.0%; in after-
noon subjects, the prevalence of those
with fasting plasma glucose levels of 7.0
mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or greater was
only 3.5%.
Because the morning and afternoon
groupswerevirtuallyidenticalexceptfor
fasting plasma glucose, it would be ex-
pected that diabetes prevalence would
also be identical in the 2 groups. We
used this feature to determine the glu-
cose values that would be diagnostic for
diabetes and impaired fasting glucose in
afternoonsubjects.Underthecurrentdi-
agnostic criteria, derived from subjects
examined in the morning, the fasting
plasmaglucosevaluedistinguishingdia-
betic from nondiabetic individuals is 7.0
mmol/L (126 mg/dL). In NHANES III,
this corresponds to the 97.2th percen-
tile of fasting plasma glucose (diabetes
prevalence of 2.8%). For afternoon sub-
jects, the 97.2th percentile value for fast-
ing glucose was 6.33 mmol/L (114
mg/dL). Similarly, the diagnostic value
for impaired fasting glucose (6.11
mmol/L [110 mg/dL]) in morning sub-
jects corresponded to the 89.8th per-
centile; this value in afternoon subjects
was 5.66 mmol/L (102 mg/dL).
As found for glucose, mean fasting
serum insulin and C peptide levels were
significantly higher in subjects exam-
ined in the morning (61.9 pmol/L and
0.696 nmol/L, respectively), com-
pared with those examined in the af-
ternoon (56.3 pmol/L and 0.635
nmol/L) (P.001 for both analytes).
COMMENT
These data from a nationally represen-
tativesampleofadultsdemonstratethat
there are clinically significant differ-
ences in fasting plasma glucose levels
betweensubjectsexaminedinthemorn-
ing and in the afternoon. We estimate
that glucose values indicating diabetes
for patients tested in the afternoon
shouldbefully0.67mmol/L(12mg/dL)
lower than the current diagnostic cri-
terion of 7.0 mmol/L (126 mg/dL) or
greater. If the current criterion were
appliedtoafternoonpatients,abouthalf
thecasesofundiagnoseddiabeteswould
bemissedinthisgroup.Indeed,because
of the consistent decline in fasting
plasma glucose throughout the morn-
ing, even the difference between 8 AM
and 10 AM glucose values can be sig-
nificant.
Many patients in the ambulatory care
setting are seen in the afternoon, and
these patients can be asked to fast for
at least 4 hours before testing for dia-
betes. Regardless of the time of day that
patients are tested, physicians need to
confirm the diagnosis by repeat test-
ing on a different day. For those ini-
tially tested in the afternoon, a confir-
matory morning test may be advised.
Early morning rises in fasting glu-
cose levels and insulin requirements
(the "dawn phenomenon") have been
observed in patients with diabetes2 and
in some,3,5,6 but not all,7-9 studies of non-
diabetic persons. Nocturnal eleva-
tions in growth hormone and early
morning increases in cortisol secre-
tion have been explored as contribu-
tors to this phenomenon.10-13 Our data
showing higher fasting levels of plasma
glucose, serum insulin, and serum C
peptide in morning subjects are con-
sistent with the existence of a dawn phe-
nomenon in nondiabetic subjects.
