Abstract
Background. Patient-reported and performance-based measures (PBMs) are commonly used
to measure physical function in studies of older adults. Selection of appropriate measures to
address specific research questions is complex and requires knowledge of relevant psychometric
properties.The aim of this study was to examine the predictive validity for adverse outcomes and
responsiveness of a widely used patient-reported measure, the Late-Life Function and Disability
Instrument (LLFDI), compared with PBMs.
Methods. We analyzed 2 years of follow-up data from Boston RISE, a cohort study of 430 primary
care patients aged 65 years. Logistic and linear regression models were used to examine
predictive validity for adverse outcomes and effect size and minimal detectable change scores
were computed to examine responsiveness. Performance-based functional measures included the
Short Physical Performance Battery, 400-m walk, gait speed, and stair-climb power test.
Results. The LLFDI and PBMs showed high predictive validity for poor self-rated health,
hospitalizations, and disability.The LLFDI function scale was the only measure that predicted falls.
Absolute effect size estimates ranged from 0.54 to 0.64 for the LLFDI and from 0.34 to 0.63 for the
PBMs. From baseline to 2 years, the percentage of participants with a change  minimal detectable
change was greatest for the LLFDI scales (46­59%) followed by the Short Physical Performance
Battery (44%), gait speed (35%), 400-m walk (17%), and stair-climb power test (9%).
Conclusions. The patient-reported LLFDI showed comparable psychometric properties to PBMs.
Our findings support the use of the LLFDI as a primary outcome in gerontological research.

Assessing physical function is important for identifying older adults at
risk for subsequent disability and other negative events such as hospi-
talization or falls and for evaluating treatment effects. The choice of
functional measure for use as a primary outcome in studies of older
adults is challenging; appropriate selection depends on the outcome
of interest and evidence for its psychometric properties. There are
two general approaches to measuring function: patient-reported and
performance-based assessments. Patient-reported outcome measures
(PROs) assess a patient's perception of a broad array of functional
activities while performance-based measures (PBMs) reflect an observ-
er's evaluation of a patient's performance of specific physical tasks.
The relative advantages of each approach have been debated (1,2).
PBMs have been purported to offer better objectivity and validity,
greater sensitivity to change and are thought to be less easily influ-
enced by external factors. On the other hand, PROs offer low cost
and convenience, and may represent a broader, more patient-centered
assessment of functions applicable to an older person's daily life.
Studies comparing the psychometric properties of PROs and
PBMs have yielded conflicting results, likely in part because previous
comparisons have often been limited by measures that assess differ-
ent aspects of function. The magnitudes of association between the
two approaches have ranged from low to high (3,4). Early reports
suggested that PROs lack sensitivity to change (5), however recent
work supports the comparability of both approaches in specific clini-
cal populations (1,6).Additionally, both PROs and PBMs of function
predict subsequent disability among older adults (6,7), though stud-
ies directly comparing the predictive validity of the two approaches
are scarce (8,9).
The Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and timed walk-
ing tests are among the most commonly used PBMs with strong evi-
dence supporting their predictive value (7,10­13). Similarly, a wide
variety of PROs have been published, though many have been lim-
ited by lack of conceptual clarity and concerns over their responsive-
ness (14). The Late-Life Function and Disability Instrument (LLFDI),
a PRO of function and disability, was developed to address these
limitations (15,16). Since its conception, the LLFDI has been used in
studies involving more than 17,000 older adults with a wide range
of health conditions (17). A recent systematic review (17) reported
evidence supporting the LLFDI's construct validity and sensitivity to
change. However, few studies have evaluated this measure's predic-
tive validity and ability to detect change in functional status, nor
included a comparison to PBMs of the same or similar aspects of
function.
This study aimed to determine the predictive validity and respon-
siveness of the Function Component of the Late-Life Function and
Disability Instrument (LLFDI-FC) compared to commonly used
PBMs of lower extremity function in older adults. We hypothesized
that the LLFDI-FC would have similar predictive validity for adverse
outcomes to the PBMs and that both types of measures would have
comparable responsiveness to meaningful change in functional sta-
tus over 2 years.
Methods
Participants
We used baseline and 2-year follow-up data from the Boston
Rehabilitative Impairment Study of the Elderly (Boston RISE), a lon-
gitudinal cohort study of 430 primary care patients.
Methods for Boston RISE were approved by the relevant
Institutional Review Boards. Study details have been published
elsewhere (18). Patients were recruited from primary care practices
who met the following criteria: age 65 years, ability to speak and
understand English, difficulty or task modification with walking 1/2
mile and/or climbing one flight of stairs, no planned major surgery,
and expectation of living in the area for 2 years. Exclusion criteria
included: significant visual impairment, uncontrolled hypertension,
lower extremity amputation, supplemental oxygen use, myocardial
infarction, or major surgery in the previous 6 months, Mini Mental
State Exam score < 18 and SPPB score < 4. A weighted recruitment
strategy using baseline SPPB scores was employed to ensure a broad
range of physical function and risk for mobility decline. Baseline
assessments were conducted during an initial screening visit and sub-
sequent visit within 2 weeks. Follow-up assessments were conducted
at 12 and 24 months. Between visits, participants were contacted by
phone every 3 months to track falls and healthcare utilization.
Measures
LLFDI-FC
The LLFDI-FC is an interview-administered questionnaire that
assesses a broad range of functional limitations (inability to per-
form discrete physical tasks), consistent with established conceptual
models (14,19). The LLFDI-FC asks subjects to report their current
degree of difficulty in performing 32 physical tasks on a typical day
without the help of someone else and without the use of assistive
devices. Response options include: none, a little, some, quite a lot,
cannot do. The scale is comprised of an overall function domain
and three subdomains: advanced lower extremity function (eg walk-
ing several blocks, getting up from the floor), basic lower extremity
function (eg standing, stooping, walking inside the home), and upper
extremity function (for a full description of tasks see Haley and col-
leagues (15)). To facilitate comparison with the PBMs in this study,
we focused on the overall function and basic and advanced lower
extremity subscales. Each LLFDI-FC domain is calibrated on a scale
from 0 to 100, where 0 indicates poor function and 100 indicates
good function. Evidence supports the LLFDI scale's construct valid-
ity, sensitivity to change and reliability (ICC = 0.91­0.98) over a
3-week interval in community-dwelling older adults (15­17).
SPPB
The SPPB is comprises three components: standing balance, usual
pace walking speed, and a five-repetition chair stand test. Scores
from each component are added to create a score between 0 and
12, with higher scores indicating better performance. The SPPB has
high predictive validity for disability, nursing home admission, and
mortality (7,8). A range of minimal clinically important difference
(MCID) values (from 0.5 to 1.3) have been suggested (8,20).
Gait speed
Participants are instructed to walk at their usual pace over a distance
of 4 m. Gait speed derived from a 4-m walk test predicts disability
and survival (13,21). A change of 0.1 to 0.2 m/s has been suggested
as the MCID (22).
400-m walk
Participants walk laps in a marked corridor with the goal to com-
plete 400-m as quickly as possible (11). Testing is terminated if par-
ticipants take >15 minutes to complete the walk. Participants unable
to complete the walk in the time allowed were assigned a score of 15
on the test. The 400-m walk is predictive of disability and mortality
in older adults (12,23). A change of 60 seconds has been suggested
as the MCID (24).
Journals of Gerontology: MEDICAL SCIENCES, 2015, Vol. 70, No. 5 617
Stair-climb power test (SCPT)
The SCPT requires participants to ascend a flight of 10 stairs as
quickly as possible, using a handrail if necessary. Stair climb power
is calculated using the participant's weight, the vertical height of the
stairs, and the speed at which they ascended the stairs. The SCPT is a
reliable and clinically relevant measure of leg power associated with
mobility (25,26).
Self-rated health, falls, hospitalizations, and disability
Self-rated health was determined using a five-point Likert scale in
response to the question "In general, how would you say your health
is (27)"; a response of poor or fair (versus excellent, very good, or
good) was used to categorize those with low self-rated health at
2 years. Self-rated health has been shown to be a powerful predic-
tor of mortality and health-care utilization (28,29). Falls were ascer-
tained in response to the question "How many times have you fallen
to the ground in the past 3 months? Include falls where any part
of your body above the ankle hit the floor or ground and falls that
occurred on the stairs (30)" and hospitalizations were defined as an
overnight hospital stay for any reason. Self-reported disability (inabil-
ity to participate in major life roles) was determined using the LLFDI
Disability component (LLFDI-DC) which assesses the older person's
current frequency of and limitations in performing 16 life tasks.
Scores range from 0 to 100 with higher scores indicating less disabil-
ity. The LLFDI-DC has demonstrated construct validity, reliability,
and sensitivity to change in community-dwelling older adults (17).
Statistical Analyses
Predictive validity
Separate logistic regression models were constructed to assess each
functional measure as predictors of unfavorable outcomes: (a) low
self-rated health at 2 years; (b) one or more falls over 2 years; and
(c) one or more hospitalizations over 2 years. The increased odds
of having an unfavorable outcome for a one SD change in each of
the function measures were calculated. Linear regression models
were used to determine the measures' predictive validity for dis-
ability, measured using the limitation and frequency domains of the
LLFDI-DC. The amount of total variance (R2) in disability explained
by the predictors was used to compare the predictive validity across
measures. The assumptions of regression were tested and confirmed
for each model.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness was defined as the degree to which a measure
detects meaningful change. Meaningful change can be determined
using either distribution-based methods (ie statistical distributions
of change and associated reliability) or anchor-based methods [ie
external criterion of change reflecting a patient or clinician's perspec-
tive (31)]. The following metrics were calculated for each measure:
1. To provide a metric of responsiveness independent of direction,
we computed absolute effect sizes (ES) for each functional meas-
ure: ES = abs((M
2
- M
1
))/S
b
, where M
2
is the mean score at the
year 2 follow-up, M
1
is the mean score at baseline, and S
b
is the
SD at baseline. Values of 0.20, 0.50, and 0.80 have been used to
represent small, moderate and large ES, respectively (32).
2. The ES for each measure was also computed using change in self-
rated health (either decline or improvement) as an external crite-
rion to identify subgroups of patients likely to have experienced
a change in function as a result of their health.
3. Standard error of measurement (SEM) was calculated as
SEM = S
b
*(1 - r), where S
b
is the SD at baseline and r is the test­
retest reliability coefficient. Data for the reliability coefficients
were obtained from previous studies (10,15,24,25,33).
4. Minimal detectable change scores with 90% confidence were
calculated as (MDC
90
) = SEM*1.645*sqrt2 (34). The MDC
90
corresponds to the smallest amount of change that falls outside
of measurement error. The percentage of patients who demon-
strated a decline/improvement  the MDC
90
over 2 years were
calculated for each measure.
Results
Table 1 shows the descriptive statistics of the sample at baseline
(n = 430). See Supplementary Table S1 for the breakdown of base-
line characteristics by tertile of LLFDI-FC score. Participants had a
mean age of 77 years and 68% were female. At baseline, 79 (18.3%)
participants reported low self-rated health, 181 participants (42.3%)
reported one or more falls in the preceding year and 114 (26.5%)
reported one more hospitalizations. At 2 years, 360 (83.7%) partici-
pants remained in the study.
Sample sizes for the individual analyses varied based on the meth-
ods and outcomes used. Quarterly phone call data were available
on 427 participants; 228 (53.4%) reported one or more falls and
164 (38.4%) reported one or more hospitalizations over 2 years. At
2 years, self-rated health data were available for 276 participants with
56 (20.3%) reporting low self-rated health. Mean disability scores at
2 years from 360 participants were 52.3 (SD 5.7) for the LLFDI-DC
frequency scale and 68.9 (SD 11.8) for the limitation scale.
Change in function data from baseline to 2 years were available
on 359 participants for self-reported function and varied for each
of the performance-based tests (see Table 4). Individuals for whom
complete functional data were available at both time points (n = 231)
had significantly better scores on each of the functional measures at
baseline than those without missing data (data not shown).
Predictive Validity
Table 2 presents the logistic regression models that show the odds
of an unfavorable outcome for every 1 SD increase in functional
measure. The LLFDI-FC and each of the PBMs showed high pre-
dictive validity for low self-rated health at 2 years, with the 400-m
walk and LLFDI-FC advanced lower extremity subscale performing
best. Similarly high predictive validity for hospitalizations was also
observed across measures. The LLFDI-FC overall function domain
was the only measure that predicted one more falls over 2 years,

however the LLFDI-FC subscales and SCPT demonstrated some pre-
dictive value (all p < .10).
The linear regression models for disability are shown in Table 3.
In general, the LLFDI-FC explained a greater percentage of the
variability in disability limitation than the PBMs. Predictive valid-
ity for disability frequency was comparable across measures, with
the SPPB, gait speed and LLFDI-FC advanced lower extremity
performing best.
Responsiveness
Responsiveness metrics are shown inTable 4.Moderate to large abso-
lute ES (ie reflecting change independent of direction) were observed
for the LLFDI-FC scales (0.54­0.64) and associated domains as well
as for the SPPB (0.63) and gait speed (0.54); smaller ES were noted
for the other PBMs. When an external anchor was used to subcat-
egorize participants who declined in perceived health status, small to
moderate negative ES were observed for the LLFDI-FC scales (-0.30
to -0.34) and gait speed (-0.23), in contrast to little or no decline in
the other PBMs. In participants with an increase in self-rated health,
the LLFDI-FC basic lower extremity was associated with the largest
positive ES (0.33) followed by the SPPB (0.23).
The percentages of participants demonstrating a change  the
MDC
90
for each functional measure are shown in Table 4 and
Figure 1. The proportion of participants who declined  the MDC
90
was largest for the LLFDI-FC scales (31­35%), followed by gait
speed (23%). Improvement  the MDC
90
was highest for the SPPB
(31%), followed by the LLFDI-FC basic lower extremity (24%).
Overall, the greatest proportion of participants with a meaningful
change in function in either direction was found for the LLFDI-FC
basic lower extremity (59.3% changed 4.38 points).
Because there was a higher amount of missing data for some of
the performance-based outcomes, we performed a sensitivity analy-
sis limiting the sample to only those with complete data for each
of the functional measures (n = 231). No material differences were
observed.
Discussion
In this study, we compared the predictive validity and responsive-
ness to 2 years of aging of a PRO, the LLFDI-FC, to frequently used
lower extremity PBMs. Our findings demonstrated that in a cohort
of older primary care patients, the LLFDI-FC performed as well or
better than most of the PBMs for predicting adverse outcomes and
for detecting meaningful changes in function over 2 years. These
results support the utility of the LLFDI-FC as a primary outcome in
gerontological research, particularly for longitudinal studies when
the construct of interest is self-reported functional limitations.
One of the advantages of the LLFDI-FC as well as many other
PROs is that they provide the user with an assessment of an older
person's limitation across a broad universe of functional activities. In
contrast, most commonly used PBMs such as the SPPB and 400-m
walk, assess the performance of quite specific functional tasks and
may not tap into the actual performance of an older person's daily
activities. Such PBMs do exist, such as the Continuous Scale Physical
Functional Performance Test (35) but can take upwards of 30­45
minutes to implement and require the use of expensive equipment.
While extensive evidence supports the construct validity of the
LLFDI (17), to our knowledge, this is the first study that evaluated
its predictive validity. The logistic regression models showed that the
LLFDI-FC demonstrated high predictive validity for poor self-rated
health, self-reported hospitalizations and disability over 2 years of fol-
low-up, comparable to the PBMs. Furthermore, the LLFDI-FC overall
function domain was the only measure that predicted falls. This was
unexpected since PBMs, particularly balance (included in the SPPB)
and gait speed, are often used to screen for fall risk (36). Although it
is possible that there was a ceiling effect with the PBMs [eg 9.8% of

patients scored at the ceiling with the SPPB at baseline (37)], it could
also be that the LLFDI-FC overall function scale assesses a broader
array of tasks, some of which have a greater association with falls.
Perhaps some of the specific components of the SPPB (eg chair-rise)
would have shown better predictive validity for falls, though not
evaluated in the current study. Of interest, along with the LLFDI-FC
subscales, the SCPT showed a trend toward predicting falls.This is not
surprising as the SCPT measures lower extremity muscle power, which
has been shown to be relevant for falls risk (38).
Ability to detect meaningful change is critical for an outcome
measure to be used in clinical trials and observational studies alike.
Given the inherent strengths and weaknesses of distribution and
anchor-based methods for determining the MCID, triangulation
of multiple methods is recommended (34). Comparing the overall
percentages of patients who exceeded the MDC
90
showed that the
LLFDI-FC, SPPB, and gait speed were more responsive to 2 years
of aging than the 400 m walk or SCPT (Table 4). In particular, the
LLFDI-FC appeared to be more responsive to meaningful decline

in function than the PBMs (Figure 1A). The converse was true for
meaningful improvement, with the SPPB being the most responsive
to improvements above its MDC
90
(Figure 1B). When we used self-
rated health as an external criterion for change, the LLFDI-FC was
more responsive to both decline and improvement in health status
than the PBMs. Future research will need to examine the reasons for
these findings, however our results extend previous work (39,40)
suggesting that PROs and PBMs convey distinct information and
that both should both be included as part of a comprehensive assess-
ment of function.
An important strength of our study is that we considered respon-
siveness to both decline and improvement in function. We observed
substantial heterogeneity in the patterns of functional change in
the Boston RISE cohort, with some patients declining and others
improving over 2 years. Indeed, recent work (41) highlighted the
inherent variability in functional aging, with the majority of patients
showing movement between different trajectories of change over
relatively short intervals. Therefore, the need for outcome measures
that can reliably detect both functional decline and improvement
is paramount for timely intervention and disability prevention. Of
note, we investigated responsiveness to 2 years of aging; an impor-
tant next step is to investigate the comparability of PROs and PBMs
for detecting change in response to interventions.
Although not a primary objective of this analysis, it is interesting
to note that the MDC
90
of both the SPPB and 400-m walk (1.66 and
1.25 minutes, respectively) exceeded prior estimates of their MCID
(0.5­1.3 for the SPPB and 1 minute for the 400-m walk) determined
using patient-reported ratings of change (8,20,24). Interpretation
of meaningful change is particularly challenging when distribution-
based metrics do not align with anchor-based estimates. While the
contrasting results may relate to differences in the populations stud-
ied, we cannot rule out that the measures lack the precision to detect
small changes considered important by patients. Future work is nec-
essary to determine if the increments of change determined impor-
tant by anchor-based methods are similarly smaller than the MDC
for the LLFDI-FC.
This study has several limitations. Falls and hospitalizations
were self-reported and may be subject to recall bias. Missing data
at 2 years may not have been missing at random; participants who
completed all functional measures at the 2-year follow-up had bet-
ter function scores at baseline than those with missing data. In
particular, there was a higher amount of missing data for some
of the performance-based outcomes, however sensitivity analyses
(data not shown) confirmed this did not affect the results. Our
findings may not be generalizable to older adults in other clini-
cal settings or geographical areas. While we have attempted to
compare measures that assess similar constructs (ie lower extrem-
ity function), each measure includes unique tasks with varying
degrees of complexity and difficulty. Finally, we did not have a
global measure of change in function rated by the patient or clini-
cian to use as a clinical anchor. This will be necessary to refine the
estimation of the clinically important difference for the LLFDI-FC
in subsequent work.
In summary, a self-report measure of function, the LLFDI-FC,
showed comparable psychometric properties to PBMs. Ultimately,
the choice of measure depends on the research question, the com-
plexity and nature of the functional tasks under investigation and the
feasibility of implementation. Nonetheless, the LLFDI-FC appears to
be a valid and responsive measure for use in studies of community-
dwelling older adults, particularly for longitudinal investigations
designed to measure functional decline.
