Introduction
Increasing prevalence of childhood overweight (BMI 95th
percentile for age and gender) has focused attention on moni-
toring local trends (1). Periodic surveys of measured weight
and height in the United States show that between 1971­1974
and 2003­2006, overweight increased from 5 to 12.4% for
2­5-year-olds, from 4 to 17% for 6­11-year-olds, and from 6
to 17.6% for 12­19-year-olds (2,3).
Height and weight data are needed to calculate BMI (weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared) to assess
weight status according to the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention growth charts (4). Measured height and weight
are the gold standard for surveillance, but measurements are
expensive to obtain and rarely available for local populations
or annually. Parent-reported data is an attractive alternative.
However, among adults and adolescents, self-reported height
and weight underestimate BMI and obesity rates compared to
measured data (5­15). The validity of overweight prevalence
estimates based on parent-reported data for younger children
is less clear because findings vary (16­18). Nevertheless, the
imperative to assess overweight prevalence among younger
children has increased with research demonstrating that being
overweight early in life increases the likelihood of being an
overweight adolescent (19).
To assess the quality of parent-reported data for childhood
overweight surveillance, we compared data from two national
surveys that collect parent-reported height and weight data
for children to a third survey that collects measured data

during physical examinations. All three surveys are routinely
used in national health and disease surveillance and provide
an opportunity to compare the performance of reported vs.

measured data collected in standardized protocols among

nationally representative samples selected using similar sam-
pling methodology.
Methods and Procedures
The National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) is a continuous national
survey of a representative sample of the civilian noninstitutional
Childhood Overweight Prevalence in the
United States: The Impact of Parent-reported
Height and Weight
Lara J. Akinbami1,2 and Cynthia L. Ogden3
Parent-reported height and weight are often used to estimate BMI and overweight status among children. The quality
of parent-reported data has not been compared to measured data on a national scale for all race/ethnic groups
in the United States. Parent-reported height and weight for 2­17-year-old children in two national health interview
surveys--the 1999­2004 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS) and the 2003­2004 National Survey of Children's
Health (NSCH)--were compared to measured values from a national examination survey--the 1999­2004 National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Compared to measured data, parent-reported data overestimated
childhood overweight in both interview surveys. For example, overweight prevalence among 2­17-year-olds was
25% (s.e. 0.2) using parent-reported NHIS data vs. 16% (s.e. 0.6) using measured NHANES data. Parent-reported
data overestimated overweight among younger children, but underestimated overweight among older children.
The discrepancy between reported and measured estimates arose mainly from reported height among very young
children. For children aged 2­11 years, the mean reported height from NHIS was 3­6cm less than mean measured
height from NHANES (P < 0.001) vs. no difference among children aged 16­17 years. Measured data remains the
gold standard for surveillance of childhood overweight. Although this analysis compared mean values from survey
populations rather than parent-reported and measured data for individuals, the results from nationally representative
data reinforce previous recommendations based on small samples that parent-reported data should not be used to
estimate overweight prevalence among preschool and elementary school­aged children.

multistage probability design (20). Interviews in selected households
are conducted for a randomly selected sample adult and, if children
are present in the family, a sample child. For children <18 years of age,
a knowledgeable adult (usually a parent) reports health conditions.
When reporting child weight and height, the parent is not instructed
to measure the child or consult records. Parent-reported weight and
height are available on restricted use files, but are not publicly released.
The response rate for the sample child component (the completion rate
among eligible children multiplied by the overall family response rate)
was 79­81% during 1999­2004 (21).
The National Survey of Children's Health (NSCH) is a module of the
State and Local Area Integrated Telephone Survey conducted in 2003­
2004 with future periodic fielding planned. The survey produces national
and state-level estimates for a variety of health indicators and measures
of children's health care experiences. A random-digit-dial sample of
households with children <18 years of age was selected from each State
and the District of Columbia. A knowledgeable adult (usually a parent)
responded for a randomly selected child in each household and, similar
to NHIS procedures, no prompt was given to measure the child or con-
sult records before reporting weight or height. The Council of American

Survey Research Organizations response rate (the product of the resolu-
tion rate, the screener completion rate, and the interview completion
rate) was 55.3% (22).
For both the NHIS and NSCH, respondents were asked: "How tall is
[child name] now?" and "How much does [child name] weigh now?"
However, the NHIS respondents were also prompted to report weight
without shoes. The NHIS height and weight data were not edited
before release of restricted files. Children whose parents did not know
or refused to provide height and/or weight were excluded (14%). We
used the World Health Organization exclusion criteria (z-score for

gender-specific BMI-for-age was <-4.0 or >+5.0) (23) to exclude
records with implausible parent-reported height and weight (6.3%)
from the main analysis for a final sample size of 54,325 
children and
teens 2­17 years of age. In a sensitivity analysis, however, we included
records with implausible height and weight values to assess the actual
data collected by professional interviewers using a well-tested 
survey
instrument. In contrast, the NSCH height and weight data were edited
before public release (22) and extreme values were suppressed to
decrease disclosure risk. The NSCH file includes a precalculated BMI
for respondents with nonmissing and unsuppressed weight and height,
and nonmissing sex. Of the NSCH sample aged 2­17 years, 8.5% was
excluded for missing values for height and/or weight (respondent did
not know or refused to answer), and 0.2% for suppression of extreme
values so that overall, 8.7% had missing values for precalculated BMI.
The sample size for the 2003­2004 NSCH was 82,390.
These data were compared to measured data for children 2­17 years
of age from the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES). The NHANES collects measured height and weight data
through standardized physical examinations in mobile examina-
tion 
centers. A nationally representative sample of respondents are
selected from the United States civilian noninstitutional population in
the 50 States and the District of Columbia using a complex multistage

probability design (24). For 1999­2004, unweighted response rates for
the examination portion of the survey for children 1­19 years of age
ranged between 81 and 88% (25). Pregnant girls and those with missing
measured weight and height data were excluded (<4%), a routine exclu-
sion that was not possible with the NHIS or NSCH because pregnancy
status was not assessed in those surveys. The final NHANES sample size
was 12,261.
Weight status was defined according to BMI percentile for age and
gender from the 2000 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
growth charts (4,26). Overweight was defined as BMI  95th percentile
for age and gender. To calculate BMI percentiles for the NHIS 
sample,
we used an online SAS program provided by Centers for Disease

Control and Prevention which defines percentiles based on months of
age (23). Because age was reported in whole years for the NHIS sample,
we categorized children according to the midpoint of their age-year
(e.g., 2-year-olds were categorized as 30-month-olds). For the NSCH,
we used the precalculated BMI percentiles that were also estimated
using this method (22). That is, BMI percentile was determined using
the same methodology for the NHIS and NSCH samples.
The childhood overweight prevalence estimates and mean height
and weight values from NHIS and NSCH parent-reported data were
compared to estimates from NHANES measured data. Differences were
analyzed by age group, gender, and race/ethnicity. Two-year age groups
produced sufficient sample size for stable estimates. Race/
ethnicity
groups included were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black, and
Mexican American from NHANES and NHIS. Estimates for the over-
all Hispanic population are not available from NHANES. The NSCH,
however, does not collect data on Hispanic subgroups. Therefore, race/
ethnicity 
estimates from NSCH are for the entire Hispanic population.
Estimates for the total sample from each survey also include race/ethnic
groups not shown separately.
National estimates were calculated using sample weights. Data were
analyzed using PC SAS version 9.1. Because of the complex sampling
design of the surveys, we used SUDAAN 9.0 to calculate standard errors.
Differences in means were tested at the 0.05 level using t-tests.
Results
Using the gold standard of measured height and weight
(NHANES 1999­2004), 15.6% (95% confidence interval 14.4,
16.8) of children aged 2­17 years were estimated to be over-
weight. Parent-reported data yielded much higher estimates:

Epidemiology
Overestimation of childhood overweight prevalence using
parent-reported data was observed for both genders and
across race/ethnic groups. When finer age groups were
examined, it became clear that the results for younger age
groups drove this pattern. Among 2­3-year-olds, NHANES
measured data yielded a prevalence estimate of 9% over-
weight vs. 42% using NHIS parent-reported data and 44%
using NSCH parent-
reported data. For 12­13-year-olds,
in contrast, measured and 
parent-reported data yielded

similar estimates (Figure 2). For 16­17-year-olds, the com-
parison of measured and 
parent-reported data reflected the

pattern seen among adults: underestimation of overweight
prevalence using reported data compared to measured data,
although the confidence intervals from all three surveys
overlap (6). A sensitivity analysis of NHIS data included
records with implausible BMI values as defined by the World
Health Organization exclusion 
criteria. The pattern was
similar, but with even more exaggerated 
overestimation of
overweight prevalence among very young children (53 vs.
42% with implausible records removed) with the difference
narrowing as age increased (data not shown).
Discrepancies between measured and parent-reported data
werealsoexaminedbygenderandrace/ethnicgroups(Table1).
Although there was variation in the specific 
patterns observed
bygenderandrace/ethnicity,thesamegeneral
patterndescribed
earlier was observed: a gradual transition from overestimation
of overweight prevalence using parent-reported data to under-
estimation over the 2­17-year-age span. Overestimation of
overweight prevalence using 
parent-
reported data was greater
for boys and persisted until older ages compared with girls.
Conversely, compared with boys, parent-reported data under-
estimated overweight prevalence beginning at younger ages
among girls.
Next, differences between measured and parent-reported
weight and height were assessed. This analysis revealed that
the means of parent-reported height among young children
were lower than measured means, and this difference drove the
observed discrepancies in overweight prevalence estimates.
For brevity, only the differences between NHANES and NHIS
are shown in Table 2 because the survey years match and the
overweight estimates for both parent-reported surveys (NHIS
and NSCH) were similar. For both boys and girls between ages
2 and 11 years, the mean NHIS reported height was 3­6cm
less than mean NHANES measured height (P < 0.05). Among
children 16­17 years of age, there was 
little difference between
measured and parent-reported mean height. The relative dif-
ference between NHANES and NHIS was 3­5% for younger
children and near 0% for older 
children. The absolute differ-
ences in the mean values for weight between NHANES meas-
ured data and NHIS parent-reported data were smaller than
for height (Table 3), and diverged between boys and girls. For
older boys, there was no difference between the measured and
the parent-reported mean weight values. Among 8­17-year-old
girls, mean weight was significantly lower in the sample with
parental report compared to that with measured data (P < 0.05).
This was also true for boys 8­9 years of age. However, as for
boys, mean parent-reported weight was significantly higher
than mean measured weight for 2­3-year-old girls (P < 0.05).

Discussion
The rise in childhood overweight prevalence (2), the associa-
tion between high BMI percentile in childhood and obesity
in adulthood (27), and the health consequences through-
out the lifespan of being overweight in childhood (28,29)
make 
monitoring childhood overweight prevalence a public
health priority. For groups pressed to produce local and/or

real-time data, low-cost options for surveillance are attrac-
tive, and reliance on reported height and weight data is

common. Furthermore, the justification for using reported
data is 
bolstered by studies among adolescents and adults
demonstrating a high correlation between self-reported and
measured height and weight (8­14,30,31). However, some
investigators warn that BMI calculated from self-reported
data may result in misclassified weight status with up to 50%
of overweight adolescents being missed (8­14).
What are the implications of using parent-reported
data for surveillance and research of overweight children?
Use of parent-reported data overestimated childhood over-
weight prevalence overall, specifically among the 
youngest
children when compared to measured data. The results are
similar when measured data were compared to each of two
national interview surveys with nationally representative

samples. Although we compared sample populations and did
not directly compare measured and reported data for indi-
vidual children, this analysis supports previous studies dem-
onstrating the potential for misclassification of weight status
when using reported data (8­14,16,18). We recommend that
parent-reported data for preschool- and elementary school­
aged children not be used to estimate overweight prevalence.
The overestimation of childhood overweight prevalence
using parent-reported data is driven primarily by the lower
mean height for the youngest children. Although the dis-
crepancy in mean height between reported and measured
data is not very large, the calculation of BMI compounds
any 
difference. Neither the NHIS nor the NSCH ask parents
to measure children or to consult records before reporting
height and weight. The consistently lower reported height we
observed could arise from difficulty in estimating the height
of much shorter 
children, or from parents not tracking height
as closely as weight. It is likely that weight is measured more
frequently using household scales.
Our results differ from studies analyzing discrepancies
between measured and reported data for individual preschool
children. Two studies, in which parents were not aware that
reports would subsequently be validated with measurements,
found little difference between means of reported and measured
height (16,17). However, both groups of investigators concluded
that studies of childhood overweight should rely on measured
data because of significant misclassification bias.
Are reported data more valid for older children?
Determining overweight prevalence among adolescents using
parent-reported weight and height begins to reflect the pattern
seen for adult self-reported data--lower mean reported weight
with larger differences between reported vs. measured mean
weights for females compared to males (6). This pattern has

Epidemiology
been well documented for self- and parent-reported data for
adolescents(5,8,9,11­14,30,31),althoughnotinallstudies(10).
In general, studies found high correlation between measured
and reported weight and lower correlation between measured
and reported height and BMI (8­10,12,13,30). Some studies
also demonstrated that reported data have high 
specificity
(92­99.6%) but low sensitivity (48­76%) in identifying over-
weight status (8­10,12,13). We also observed that differences
between measured and reported data may be accentuated
among subgroups. For example, among non-Hispanic white
females aged 14­15 years, overweight prevalence was 14.7%
using measured data vs. 8.2% using reported NHIS data. Our
results support the recommendations of other investigators to
avoid use of parent-reported data for overweight surveillance
in adolescents if possible (9­11,13).
Can a correction factor be used for reported data
for adolescents?
Analyses of correction factors have focused on self-reported
rather than parent-reported data, but the lessons are applicable
to our findings among adolescents given the similarity between
parent- and self-reporting patterns for older adolescents. Some
researchers have argued that high correlation between reported
and measured data justifies use of a correction factor for self-
reported data for adolescents to assess overweight prevalence
(8,14,32).Buttherearereasonstoavoidcorrectionfactors.First,
errors may not be homogenous. That is, discrepancies between
reported and measured values vary by other factors in addi-
tion to age, gender, and race/
ethnicity (5), including pubertal
stage, time since menarche, exercise levels (6,14), and socio-
economic status (15). Although correction factors based solely
on reported height and weight among adults have been shown
as accurate as more complicated methods (33), some investiga-
tors concluded that the pattern of error in self-reported data
among adults is difficult or impossible to 
correct using linear
regression (15), and similar results have not yet been dem-
onstrated for adolescents for whom pubertal stage may be an
important modifier. Others advise that studies using reported
data should collect measured data from a subset of the sample
to calculate a study-specific measure of bias (8). Second, cor-
relation does account for the magnitude or direction of bias. If
reported height and weight are biased in opposite directions,
the bias for calculated BMI can become very high (17). Where
only reported data are available, such as state-level surveillance
from NSCH, estimates of overweight among older children
(starting as early as age 10 years among girls) must be inter-
preted with the knowledge that the overweight prevalence is
likely to be underestimated, and that no valid correction factor
to adjust for misclassification has been evaluated for children.
Parent-reported data for younger 
children are so poor that no
correction is possible.
Should reported data for weight and height
(and the derived BMI) be used as covariates in analyses?
Some researchers argue that the high correlation between
reported and measured data may justify the use of continuous
reported data for height, weight and BMI as covariates
(5,6,13,18,31). However, because reporting among persons
with high measured values of weight tend to be least accu-
rate (14,15,30), high BMI categories calculated from reported

values have low sensitivity. Additional issues suggest 
caution
when interpreting analyses using continuous values for
reported weight, height, and BMI: (i) many studies showing
highcorrelationhavebeenbasedonsurveyswhererespondents
report height and weight with the knowledge of subsequent
validation (e.g., persons 16 years in NHANES)--correlation
between reported and measured values may be lower for

surveys in which reported data are not validated (e.g., NHIS);
(ii) because patterns of misclassification may vary by age
(8,9,11­13,30), gender (8,14,32), race (13,30,31), and over-
weight status (34), using reported data increases the likelihood
of bias. For 
example, misclassification has been observed to
attenuate associations between weight status and outcomes in
a study of asthma among adults (34); and (iii) the group with
the least accurate reporting of weight--persons with high body
weight--has increased in prevalence. Again, parent-reported
data for small children yield unreliable values for BMI and
should not be used, even as continuous data as covariates.
The main limitation of this study is the inability to compare
parent-reported and measured data for individual children. By
directly comparing the NHIS sample to the NHANES 
sample,
we assume that these nationally representative surveys contain
comparablesamplesofchildrenintermsofweight
status.Finally,
our results are based on samples of children from the United
States. To the extent that reporting of weight and height may
differ by race/ethnicity, cultural norms, and other 
factors, results
may not be generalizable to populations of other countries.
Use of parent-reported data for children from each of two
national health surveys overestimates childhood overweight
prevalence compared to measured data from a national

examination survey. Weight status estimated using measured
data remains the gold standard for childhood overweight

surveillance. Although this analysis could not compare parent-
related and measured data for individuals, the results reinforce
previous recommendations that parent-reported data not be
used to estimate prevalence of overweight among preschool-
and elementary school­aged children. Given that there is
a need for simple, cost-effective methods to obtain reported
height and weight in young children, more research is needed
to find either appropriate correction factors or techniques that
generate more accurate reports.
