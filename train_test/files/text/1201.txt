Context: Uncertainty exists about the prevalence, se-
verity, and correlates of mental disorders among people
exposed to Hurricane Katrina.
Objective: To estimate the prevalence and associa-
tions between DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders and hur-
ricane-related stressors separately among prehurricane
residents of the New Orleans metropolitan area and the
remainder of the areas in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mis-
sissippi affected by Katrina.
Design: Community survey.
Setting and Participants: A probability sample of 1043
English-speaking prehurricane residents of the areas af-
fected by Hurricane Katrina was administered via tele-
phone survey between January 19 and March 31, 2006.
The survey assessed hurricane-related stressors and
screened for 30-day DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorders.
Main Outcome Measures: The K6 screening scale of
anxiety-mood disorders and the Trauma Screening Ques-
tionnaire scale for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD),
both calibrated against blinded structured clinical reap-
praisal interviews to approximate the 30-day preva-
lence of DSM-IV disorders.
Results: Prehurricane residents of the New Orleans met-
ropolitanareawereestimatedtohavea49.1%30-daypreva-
lence of any DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder (30.3% esti-
mated prevalence of PTSD) compared with 26.4% (12.5%
PTSD) in the remainder of the sample. The vast majority
of respondents reported exposure to hurricane-related
stressors. Extent of stressor exposure was more strongly
related to the outcomes in the New Orleans metropolitan
area subsample than the remainder of the sample. The
stressors most strongly related to these outcomes were
physical illness/injury and physical adversity in the New
Orleans metropolitan area subsample and property loss in
the remainder of the sample. Sociodemographic corre-
lates were not explained either by differential exposure or
reactivity to hurricane-related stressors.
Conclusions: The high prevalence of DSM-IV anxiety-
mood disorders, the strong associations of hurricane-
related stressors with these outcomes, and the indepen-
dence of sociodemographics from stressors argue that the
practical problems associated with ongoing stressors are
widespread and must be addressed to reduce the preva-
lence of mental disorders in this population.

IT IS WELL ESTABLISHED THAT NATU-
ral disasters lead to increased
prevalence of mental illness in the
range of 5% to 40%,1,2 although
mostincreasesareinthelowerhalf
of this range.3-8 Much of the between-
disaster variation is likely due to differen-
tial disaster severity and exposure,9 as in-
dicatedbythefactthatstudiesofpeoplewho
experienced devastating loss in major natu-
ral disasters consistently document high
prevalence of mental illness.1,10 Assess-
ment of individual stressors in natural di-
sasters is nonetheless challenging, and our
understanding of their effects on postdisas-
ter mental illness remains limited.
Hurricane Katrina was the worst natu-
ral disaster in the United States in the past
75 years, creating a disaster region as large
as Great Britain, killing more than 1000
people,uprooting500000others,andcaus-
ingmorethan$100billionindamage.11 This
vast devastation would lead us to expect a
high prevalence of mental illness among
people who lived through Katrina. Avail-
able evidence is consistent with this expec-
tation.12-14 However, no published re-
search has yet considered the scope or
variety of stressors experienced or the role
played by disaster-related stressors in the
mental illness of people who lived through
Katrina. Such an investigation has the po-
tential to be important in targeting inter-
vention efforts, especially because Katrina
exposed people to a wide variety of stress-
ors,suchascommunitydisruption,jobloss,
and property loss,15 many of which still per-
sist 2 years after the hurricane.
We examined the prevalence of hurri-
cane-related stressors and their associa-
tions with screening measures of DSM-IV

theHurricaneKatrinaCommunityAdvisoryGroup(CAG),
a representative sample of 1043 prehurricane residents of
the areas in Alabama, Louisiana, and Mississippi directly
affected by Katrina who agreed to participate in a series of
tracking surveys over several years to assess need for ser-
vices and the pace of recovery efforts. Based on the much
more devastating nature of the disaster in the 7 parishes
defined by the Census Bureau as the New Orleans metro-
politan area (henceforth New Orleans metro) than in the
remainder of the hurricane area, we consider results sepa-
rately in each of these 2 subsamples.
METHODS
SAMPLE
The CAG target population was English-speaking adult (aged
18 years) prehurricane residents of the counties (in Ala-
bama and Mississippi) and parishes (in Louisiana) defined by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) as di-
rectly affected by Hurricane Katrina.16 Prehurricane residents
of these areas were eligible for the sample regardless of whether
they were in these areas at the time of the hurricane and re-
gardless of the extent to which they or their property were af-
fected by the hurricane. Census data suggest that only about
1% of this population was unable to speak English,17 suggest-
ing that the restriction of the sample to English speakers did
not introduce major bias into the sample.
Respondents were selected from 3 sampling frames: the tele-
phone numbers (land lines and cell phones) of the roughly 1.4
million families that applied for assistance from the American Red
Cross(ARC);arandom-digitdial(RDD)telephoneframeofhouse-
holds in the areas affected by the hurricane; and a supplemental
sample of hotels that housed FEMA-supported evacuees. Sur-
veying was carried out between January 19 and March 31, 2006,
5 to 7 months after the hurricane. As noted earlier, prehurricane
residents of New Orleans metro were oversampled.
Although the use of RDD might seem impractical in a popu-
lation where many people evacuated, evacuation was much more
common in the New Orleans metro than the remainder of the
affected areas. Furthermore, many evacuees had returned as of
the time of the survey. Random-digit dial was useful in con-
tacting these nonevacuees and returned evacuees. The vast ma-
jority of evacuees, in comparison, applied to the ARC for as-
sistance and could be traced through contact information
provided in the ARC applications for assistance. Other evacu-
ees could be traced in the RDD sample through a call-
forwarding service set up by Bell South in the wake of the hur-
ricane, which forwarded calls to phone numbers anywhere in
the country as requested by the person in whose name the pre-
hurricane phone was registered. More details on sampling and
adjustment for overlap of the frames are reported elsewhere.18
The sample of potential respondents we were able to con-
tact and screen for eligibility represented 64.9% of those we at-
tempted to reach. This low contact-screening rate reflects the
special difficulties locating people after the massive disrup-
tion caused by Katrina. Screening-survey respondents were in-
formed that joining the CAG required a commitment to par-
ticipate in a number of follow-up surveys over several years and
to provide tracing information if they moved. Screening-
survey respondents were asked to consider these require-
ments carefully before agreeing because we wanted all respon-
dents to participate in subsequent surveys. The 1043 respondents
who agreed were administered the baseline CAG survey, the
results of which are presented here. These respondents repre-
sent 41.9% of those we attempted to reach. This could have been
increased up as much as 64.9% (ie, all the screening-survey re-
spondents) if we had not required a commitment for long-
term involvement in the CAG, but we felt that this commit-
ment was needed because a central aim of the CAG was to track
changes in adjustment over time.
Screening questionnaires administered to the full screen-
ing sample showed that those who did not join the CAG were
similar to respondents on all sociodemographic variables but
had a somewhat higher level of self-reported hurricane-
related stress exposure than CAG members (assessed by ask-
ing respondents to rate their hurricane-related stress expo-
sure on a 0-10 scale where 0 meant "no stress at all" and 10
meant "the most stress you can imagine a person having") and
more psychological distress than CAG members (assessed with
a short series of questions about frequency of common anxiety-
mood symptoms, responses to which were summed and normed
to a 0-10 theoretical range). The median and interquartile range
(IQR)(25th-75thpercentiles)ofreportedhurricane-relatedstress
exposure were 8.0 (IQR, 6.0-10.0) among nonrespondents and
7.0 (IQR, 5.0-9.0) among CAG members. The median and IQR
of reported psychological distress were 2.9 (IQR, 1.2-4.4) among
nonrespondents and 1.7 (IQR, 0.6-3.5) among CAG mem-
bers. A weight was applied to the CAG data to adjust for these
response biases. A within-household probability of selection
weight was also used along with a poststratification weight to
adjust for residual discrepancies between the CAG and the 2000
census population on a range of social, demographic, and pre-
hurricane housing variables. The consolidated CAG sample
weight, finally, was trimmed to increase design efficiency based
on evidence that trimming did not significantly affect the es-
timated prevalence of anxiety-mood disorders.
MEASURES
Hurricane-Related Stressors
The survey included 29 structured questions developed based
on pilot interviews about hurricane-related stressors. In addi-
tion, we asked an open-ended question--"What would you say
are currently your most serious practical problems caused by
Katrina?"--in an effort to discover any common stressors not
coveredinthestructuredquestions.Itshouldbenotedthatsome
respondents,especiallyevacueestosouthTexas,weresubsequently
exposed to Hurricane Rita. To capture information about these
experiences,weaskedallrespondentswhethertheywereexposed
to Rita, and if so, we asked about stressors experienced in either
hurricane. The full text of the interview schedule that includes
the complete set of stressor questions is available elsewhere.18
Ten stressors emerged as sufficiently common to be con-
sidered in this analysis. Four were traumatic stressors in the
sense specified in the DSM-IV for a diagnosis of posttraumatic
stress disorder (PTSD): experiences that involved serious risk
of death, death of a loved one (family member or close friend),
victimization (burglary, robbery, physical assault, or sexual as-
sault) due to lawlessness after the storm, and victimization of
a loved one. The other 6 were for the most part nontraumatic
stressors: physical illness or injury caused or exacerbated by
the storm, extreme physical adversity (eg, sleeping in a church
basement, difficulty obtaining adequate food or clothing), ex-
treme psychological adversity (eg, living in circumstances where
the respondent had to use the toilet or change clothes without
adequate privacy, exposure to threats of violence), major prop-
erty loss, income loss, and ongoing difficulties associated with
housing (multiple moves or living in substantially worse post-
hurricane than prehurricane housing). Some cases of the lat-
ter 6 stressors were described by respondents in ways that im-
plied that the stressors might have been traumatic (eg, a life-

threatening injury, a threat of fatal violence), but no attempt
was made to distinguish these cases from nontraumatic stress-
ors because the open-ended reports of these events were often
too imprecise to make this distinction clearly.
Mental Illness
The K6 scale of nonspecific psychological distress19 was used
to screen for DSM-IV anxiety disorders within 30 days of the
interview.20 Scores range from 0 to 24. Two independent vali-
dation studies found the K6 to have an area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve between 0.8619 and 0.8921,22 in
predicting diagnoses of mental illness based on comprehen-
sive diagnostic interviews. Based on previous K6 validation and
using the definition of the terms from SAMHSA (Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration), scores of
13 to 24 were classified probable serious mental illness (SMI)
while scores of 8 to 12 were classified probable mild/moderate
mental illness (MMI) and scores of 0 to 7 were classified prob-
able noncases. The designation of MMI represents respon-
dents who were estimated to meet criteria for a DSM-IV anxiety-
mood disorder but not SMI. Previous research has shown that
MMI is of considerable public health importance because of its
high prevalence, burden, and risk of transition to SMI.23 A small
clinical reappraisal study of 5 respondents selected randomly
from each of these 3 K6 categories (SMI, MMI, noncase) with
the Structured Clinical Interview for DSM-IV (SCID)24 con-
firmed K6 classifications for 14 of 15 respondents. The excep-
tion was a respondent classified as having SMI by the K6 but
MMI by the SCID based on a global assessment of functioning
(GAF) score of 65 (a GAF score of 0-60 is required to diag-
nose SMI). These results, although based on only a small sample,
suggest that the K6 has excellent psychometric properties (es-
timated in the SCID sample weighted to adjust for the sample-
wide K6 distribution), including sensitivity (1.0 for SMI, 0.90
for MMI, and 1.0 for either SMI to MMI) and specificity (1.0).
Given the special importance of PTSD in trauma situa-
tions, a separate PTSD screen was included based on the 12-
itemTraumaScreeningQuestionnaire(TSQ),25 avalidatedscreen
for PTSD.26 Our version differed from the original TSQ in using
dimensional response options rather than a simple yes-no re-
sponse format to assess 30-day symptom frequency (never, less
than once a week, about once a week, 2 to 4 days a week, and
most every day). A clinical reappraisal study was carried out
to calibrate TSQ responses to DSM-IV PTSD with 30 respon-
dents judged possible cases and 10 randomly selected others.
A cutpoint on the factor-based 0-to-42 scale of TSQ responses
(12 items, each scored 0-4) of 20 was selected to approxi-
mate the SCID PTSD prevalence in the weighted (to adjust for
oversampling of screened positives) clinical reappraisal sample.
Sensitivity (0.89), specificity (0.93), and area under the re-
ceiver operating characteristic curve (0.91) were all excellent
for this dichotomous screen.
Sociodemographic Controls
We examined associations of K6 and TSQ approximations of
DSM-IV diagnoses with several sociodemographic variables: age,
sex, race/ethnicity, family income in the year before the hurri-
cane, education, prehurricane marital status, and prehurricane
employment status. Age was coded 18 to 39 years, 40 to 59 years,
and 60 years or older. Race/ethnicity was coded non-Hispanic
white,non-Hispanicblack,andother(largelyHispanicandAsian).
Family income was coded in quartiles where low was defined as
less than or equal to 0.5 of the population median on the ratio of
per-tax income to number of family members while low-average
was defined 0.5 through 1.0 on the same ratio; high-average,
1.0 through 3; and high, 3 on this ratio. Years of education
were coded in 4 categories: 0 to 11, 12 (high school graduate),
13 to 15, and 16 (college graduate). Marital status was coded
married (including cohabiting, excluding separated), never mar-
ried,andpreviouslymarried(separated,widowed,divorced).Em-
ployment status, finally, was coded employed (including self-
employed and full-time students), homemaker, retired, and other
(largely unemployed and disabled).
ANALYSIS METHODS
Estimated prevalence of DSM-IV disorders and hurricane-
related stressors were examined with cross-tabulations that dis-
tinguished prehurricane residents of the New Orleans metro
from the remainder of the sample. The effects of sociodemo-
graphic variables, hurricane-related stressors, and their inter-
actions in predicting the estimates of DSM-IV disorders were
examined using logistic regression analysis.27 Logistic regres-
sion coefficients and their standard errors were exponentiated
to create odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (95%
CIs) for ease of interpretation. Because the data were weighted,
the Taylor series linearization method28 was used to calculate
design-based significance tests. Multivariate significance was
calculated using Wald 2 tests based on design-corrected co-
efficient variance-covariance matrices. Statistical significance
was evaluated using 2-sided .05-level tests.
RESULTS
ESTIMATED PREVALENCE OF DSM-IV
ANXIETY-MOOD DISORDERS
The estimated prevalence of any 30-day DSM-IV anxiety-
mood disorder based on the K6 was 31.2% in the total
sample (Table 1) and significantly higher among pre-
hurricane residents of the New Orleans metro (49.1%)
thantheremainderofthesample(26.4%; z=5.0,P.001).
Approximately one-third of respondents who screened
positive for a DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder were clas-
sified as having probable SMI (11.3%) and the other two-
thirds as having probable MMI (19.9%). The ratio of prob-

able SMI to MMI did not differ meaningfully in the New
Orleans metro (0.53) compared with the remainder of
the sample (0.59).
All respondents classified by the TSQ as having PTSD
also were classified by the K6 as having an anxiety-
mood disorder. The estimated prevalence of PTSD in the
total sample was 16.3%, with a significantly higher esti-
mate in the New Orleans metro (30.3%) than the re-
mainder of the sample (12.5%; z=4.1, P.001). The con-
ditional estimated prevalence of PTSD given probable SMI
was extremely high in both subsamples (98.1% in the New
Orleans metro and 85.8% in the remainder of the sample;
z=0.6, P=.54). The conditional estimated prevalence of
PTSD given probable MMI, in comparison, was consid-
erably lower (42.5% in the New Orleans metro and 24.8%
in the remainder of the sample; z=1.6, P=.12).
ASSOCIATIONS OF SOCIODEMOGRAPHIC
VARIABLES WITH ESTIMATED
ANXIETY-MOOD DISORDERS
We examined sociodemographic correlates of estimated
PTSD, of other estimated DSM-IV anxiety-mood disor-
ders exclusive of PTSD, and of probable SMI or MMI sepa-
rately in the New Orleans metro subsample and the re-
mainder of the sample (Table 2). Estimated prevalence
of any DSM-IV anxiety-mood disorder was consistently
associated with age less than 60 years, female sex, edu-
cation less than college graduation, low family income,
"other" prehurricane employment status (largely unem-
ployed and disabled), and being unmarried. In addi-
tion, Hispanic individuals and people of other racial/
ethnic minorities exclusive of non-Hispanic black had

significantly lower estimated prevalence of any disorder
than non-Hispanic white individuals in the New Or-
leans metro as well as a significantly lower estimated
prevalence of PTSD in the remainder of the sample. The
strongest ORs in the New Orleans metro were for low
income and other employment status with PTSD (4.0-
5.3), whereas the strongest ORs in the remainder of the
sample were for low education, low income, other em-
ployment status, and being unmarried with PTSD (4.7-
17.7). Although some of the significant sociodemo-
graphic predictors of estimated SMI or MMI had different
associations with estimated PTSD than with other esti-
mated anxiety-mood disorders, these associations were
inconsistent across geographic subsamples.

The vast majority of respondents both in the New Or-
leans metro (91.9%) and in the remainder of the sample
(81.7%) reported experiencing at least 1 of the 10 cat-
egories of hurricane-related stressors (Table 3). New
Orleans metro respondents reported a higher preva-
lence of each stressor than respondents in the remain-
der of the sample. The 2 most frequently reported stress-
ors were housing adversity (71.7% in the New Orleans
metro; 34.1% in the remainder of the sample; z=8.6,
P.001) and property loss (70.2% vs 47.8%; z=4.9,
P.001). Other stressors occurred to between 33.6% and
46.3% (physical adversity) and 0.9% and 1.1% (life-
threatening experience) of respondents.
ASSOCIATIONS OF HURRICANE-RELATED
STRESSORS WITH ESTIMATED
ANXIETY-MOOD DISORDERS
Because high intercorrelations among stressors made it
difficult to assess the separate effects of individual stress-
ors in predicting estimated mental disorders, we evalu-
ated a series of logistic regression models that included
additive and interactive effects of exposure to multiple
stressors (Table 4). Model 1 included only sociodemo-
graphic predictors. Model 2 then added information about
number of hurricane-related stressors, ignoring type of
stressor. Information about number of stressors was sig-
nificantly related to the outcomes in all but 1 instance
(other probable anxiety-mood disorders in the sub-
sample exclusive of the New Orleans metro; 2
7
=13.7,
P=.06). We then evaluated a series of 10 models, each
adding 1 of the 10 stressors to model 2 to determine
whether type of stressor predicted the outcomes net of
number of stressors. (Detailed results are not reported
but are available on request.) Three of these 10 were sig-
nificant: physical illness/injury and physical adversity in
the New Orleans metro and property loss in the remain-
der of the sample. When these significant adversities were
added to model 2, the best-fitting specification included
a single predictor to distinguish respondents exposed to
1 or more stressors vs none plus separate predictors for

the 2 (in the New Orleans metro) or 1 (in the remainder
of the sample) specific types of stressors that had effects
significantly higher than the others. The latter model
(model 3) improved significantly on model 2. We next
considered a model that allowed for interactions among
pairs of stressors (model 4). No significant interactions
of this type were found. We also examined the ORs in
model 4 for evidence of a consistently strong substan-
tive pattern because the 44 df test (all logically possible
pairs among the 10 stressors minus 1 df for the global
count of stressors) might have failed to detect substan-
tively important patterns in a small number of pairs. No
such evidence was found.
The best-fitting model 3 shows that physical illness/
injury and physical adversity are associated with in-
creased odds of the outcomes in the New Orleans metro
(2.8-7.9) while financial loss is associated with increased
odds in the remainder of the sample (2.8-5.6) (Table 5).
The ORs for other stressors are 3.6-6.3 in the New Or-
leans metro and 1.5-1.8 in the remainder of the sample.
The ORs are consistently higher in the New Orleans me-
tro than the remainder of the sample with the exception
of a higher OR associated with property loss in predicting
estimated PTSD in the remainder of the sample.
JOINT EFFECTS OF SOCIODEMOGRAPHICS
AND HURRICANE-RELATED STRESSORS
Analyses were conducted to determine whether the sig-
nificant sociodemographic associations documented in
Table 2 could be explained by differential exposure to
hurricane-related stressors. They could not. (Detailed re-
sults are not reported but are available on request.) In-
deed, 22 of the 27 statistically significant ORs in Table 2
remained significant at the .05 level after introducing con-
trols for the stressors. The other previously significant
ORs only changed modestly in substantive terms.
We also evaluated the possibility that the adverse ef-
fects of the hurricane-related stressors vary across socio-
demographic subsamples. To increase statistical power, we
combinedthesignificantstressorsfromTable5intoasingle
measure by generating individual-level predicted prob-
abilities of the outcomes based on the coefficients in model
3. This summary measure was used in interaction with the
sociodemographic variables. No more interactions were
found to be statistically significant at the .05 level in these
tests than would be expected by chance.

in the New Orleans metro and 85.8% in the remainder of
thesample)alsoscreenedpositiveforPTSD,reinforcingthe
notionthatPTSDisthecentralformofpsychopathologyas-
sociated with natural disasters.32
Nearly one-fourth of New Orleans metro respon-
dents and one-sixth of other respondents were exposed
to traumatic hurricane-related stressors, while the vast
majority of respondents (79%-90%) were exposed to other
hurricane-related stressors. Comparing these estimates
with other postdisaster samples is challenging because
few previous studies either attempted to sample com-
plete populations affected by large disasters or compre-
hensively assessed disaster-related stressors. However, to
the extent that comparisons allow, it appears that the pro-
portion of people experiencing hurricane-related stress-
ors after Katrina was substantially higher than after other
recent hurricanes, such as Hurricane Andrew in 199333
and Hurricanes Charley/Frances/Ivan/Jeanne in 2004.34
Although the hurricane-related stressors assessed here
were significant predictors of estimated anxiety-mood dis-
orders, the stressors with the highest ORs were different
in the New Orleans metro (physical illness/injury and
physical adversity) than the remainder of the sample
(property loss). It is especially striking that the impact
of property loss was less in the New Orleans metro than
the remainder of the hurricane area even though prop-
erty loss was much more commonly experienced in the
New Orleans metro than the remainder of the hurricane
area. One possible explanation for this difference is that
personal property loss might have been experienced as
less stressful in a situation where, as in the New Orleans
metro, property loss was the norm in the population. Or
it might be that evacuation and physical displacement,
which occurred to the vast majority of prehurricane resi-
dents of the New Orleans metro, created a context in
which property loss had much less of an emotional effect
than in the rest of the hurricane area. It is also possible
that the subjective stressfulness of property loss was less-
ened in the context of the situation in the New Orleans
metro, where many people were exposed to even worse
stressors, such as death and injury and extreme physi-
cal adversity. But these are merely speculations. The only
certain conclusion that can be drawn from the results re-
garding variation in the relative effects of specific stress-
ors in New Orleans and the remainder of the hurricane
area is that we have much more to learn about the ways
in which multiple exposures and disaster context influ-
ence the effects of individual disaster-related stressors.
Thefindingsthatwomen,youngpeople,andpeoplewith
low socioeconomic status were at comparatively high risk
of anxiety-mood disorders are consistent with previously
documented correlates of mental illness after disasters9,31
and other traumas.35 Importantly, though, these same as-
sociations are found in community epidemiological sur-
veys in the absence of disasters, suggesting that these as-
sociationsmightberelatedtopreexistingmentaldisorders.14
Consistent with this possibility, these sociodemographic
associations were not explained by exposure to hurricane-
related stressors. Nor did we find evidence that the asso-
ciations of hurricane-related stressors with estimated anxi-
ety-mood disorders differ meaningfully in subsamples
defined by these sociodemographic factors.
The finding that Hispanic individuals and people of
other minorities exclusive of non-Hispanic black had sig-
nificantly lower estimated prevalence of anxiety-mood
disorders than non-Hispanic white individuals is diffi-
cult to interpret. Previous research has found elevated
prevalence of postdisaster mental illness among His-
panic people,36 although this was largely Puerto Rican
and Dominican individuals whereas the prehurricane His-
panic people in the Katrina area were largely Mexican-
American. However, caution is needed in interpreting this
finding, because the number of respondents in our mi-
nority subsample is quite small (35 respondents) and in-
cludes Asian as well as Hispanic individuals. Future re-
search will need much larger samples to investigate ethnic
differences in disaster response, noting that elevated preva-
lence among Hispanic people could well vary substan-
tially among Mexican-American people compared with
other segments of the Hispanic population.
The results lead to 4 conclusions. First, the stressors
considered here appear to have played a critical role in
the high prevalence of hurricane-related anxiety-mood
disorders. Second, the fact that the associations be-
tween hurricane-related stressors and estimated anxiety-
mood disorders were stronger in the New Orleans me-
tro than the remainder of the hurricane area suggests that
undetermined vulnerability or contextual factors were
present in the New Orleans metro that remain under-
stood. Third, the observation that hurricane-related
stressor exposure was widespread and comparable across
sociodemographic subsamples means that the impact of
the hurricane on mental health was widespread rather
than concentrated in any one particular segment of the
population. This, in turn, suggests that efforts to ad-
dress the problem of increased mental illness in the wake
of the hurricane must address the needs of persons in all
segments of society rather than target specific popula-
tion segments. This may be particularly challenging for
prehurricane residents of the New Orleans metro, many
of whom are now living throughout the country. Fourth,
evidence that avoidable stressors associated with the slow
government response to Hurricane Katrina (eg, physi-
cal adversity) had important implications for the men-
tal health of people who lived through Katrina argues
strongly for the importance of efficient provision of prac-
tical and logistical assistance in future disasters, not only
on humanitarian grounds, but also as a way to minimize
the adverse mental health effects of disasters.
