COMMENTARY
Risk Charts: Putting Cancer in Context
Steven Woloshin, Lisa M. Schwartz, H. Gilbert Welch
Whether people respond to a given health threat depends in
part on how large they perceive their personal risk to be. Typical
presentations of health risks (e.g., in the news, in public service
announcements, and in direct-to-consumer advertisements) may
do little to inform these perceptions. For example, efforts to
describe various diseases to the public often take the following
form: "This year, approximately 182 800 women in the United
States will be diagnosed with invasive breast cancer, and ap-
proximately 40800 women will die from breast cancer" (1).
Similar messages can be found for most well-known diseases
[and increasingly, over the Internet, for less well-known dis-
eases, such as hemochromatosis (2)]. What is missing from these
messages is context: How does the chance of dying from breast
cancer--or any other single disease--compare with the chance
of dying from another disease? What is an individual's chance of
dying from any cause? Without some context, it is impossible to
gauge the magnitude of a disease risk.
To provide this context, we have created simple charts with
age-, sex-, and smoking-specific data about the chance of dying
from various common causes. In this article, we describe the
method for creating these charts and make the charts publicly
available.
METHODS
Overview
The risk charts are designed to be simple, low-tech tools that
can be used anywhere (e.g., posted in a clinic office). Our goal
was to create charts that put disease risk in context by placing the
10-year chance of dying from various causes side by side. The
risk charts include data for a range of ages on a single page to
facilitate their use in a clinical setting.
Data
Information about deaths came from the National Center for
Health Statistics (NCHS) Multiple Cause of Death Public Use
File for 1998 (3). The file contains information on all deaths of
persons residing in the United States in 1998 and is based on
death certificates completed by each state [all states require the
reporting of all deaths; it is believed that more than 99% of all
deaths in the United States are registered by the states (4)]. A
death certificate may list multiple causes of death, which are
translated at NCHS into codes enumerated in the International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision (ICD-9) (5). A computer
program at NCHS assigns the underlying cause of death from the
multiple causes listed on each certificate (4). The risk charts we
developed are based on these underlying causes of death.
Disease Categories
We included in the risk charts both the most common causes
of death (e.g., heart attack, lung cancer) and causes that have
received particular attention in the media (e.g., AIDS, ovarian
cancer). The charts present 11 causes of death for women and
nine for men. Eight causes apply to both sexes: accidents, heart
attack, cerebrovascular disease, pneumonia, influenza, AIDS,
lung cancer, and colon cancer. Sex-specific causes are prostate
cancer (for men) and breast, cervical, and ovarian cancer (for
women).
We grouped individual causes of death into disease categories
using standard NCHS groupings [i.e., based on a list of the 282
most common causes of death (6); see supplemental Table 1 on the
Journal's Web site at http://jncicancerspectrum.oupjournals.org/
jnci/content/vol94/issue11/index.shtml]. Our only departure from
the NCHS groupings was the creation of the category "heart at-
tack," which includes deaths from acute and chronic ischemic heart
disease and associated complications (e.g., congestive heart failure
and arrhythmia); the heart attack category does not include other
heart disease deaths (e.g., endocarditis, valvular disease, pericardi-
tis).
Calculations
Age-specific death rates. We calculated the 10-year chance
of dying from selected causes and from any cause as follows.
We used the NCHS Multiple Cause of Death File to count the
number of deaths in 1998 for individuals 20 years old and older
from each selected cause (and from any cause). Because this file
includes all U.S. deaths, there are sufficient data to generate
death rates for every year of age. We generated these rates
by dividing the number of deaths at each year of age by the
estimated midyear (July 1, 1998) U.S. resident population by
using data from the U.S. Census (7). (For example, we generated
the annual death rate from lung cancer for 20-year-old women,
21-year-old women, and 22-year-old women). Thus, we calcu-
lated the annual death rate for every year of age for each disease
category.
Ten-year probability of death. We determined the 10-year
probability of death for each age represented in the risk chart
(i.e., age 20 years to age 90 years, in 5-year increments) by
creating a theoretical cohort of 100 000 individuals. For ex-
ample, we applied the age-specific all-cause death rate for a
20-year-old man to calculate total number of deaths after 1 year
in a cohort of 100000 20-year-old men. We then subtracted this
number from 100000 to obtain the number of survivors (i.e., of
the original 100000 20-year-old men, how many reached age
21?). These survivors made up the population at risk for death in
the subsequent year. We then applied the all-cause death rate

calculated for 21-year-old men to determine the number of
deaths over the next year and repeated the process through the
10th year. In this way, we defined the population at risk for death
at the beginning of each of 10 years. We then applied the age-
specific death rate for each individual cause of death to the
population at risk at the beginning of each year and obtained the
10-year chance of death from each cause by adding the number
of deaths in each of the 10 years. Table 1 illustrates this calcu-
lation for the 10-year chance of accidental death for a 20-year-
old man.
Adjusting risk estimates for smoking. After age and sex,
smoking is the most important risk factor for a variety of specific
causes of death (e.g., lung cancer and heart disease) as well as
for all-cause mortality. Thus, we created two sets of charts: one
for current smokers and one for never smokers. We used the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's definitions of
smoking status (8,9): current smokers are people who currently
smoke and have smoked at least 100 cigarettes in their lifetime,
and never smokers are people who have smoked fewer than
100 cigarettes in their lifetime. (We did not create charts for
former smokers, i.e., people who do not smoke now but smoked
at least 100 cigarettes in the past). To calculate the chance of
dying according to smoking status, we needed the following
information: the age-specific prevalence of smoking and the
relative risk of death (from various causes and all causes) asso-
ciated with smoking. We assumed that the risk of dying in the
general population is the weighted average of the risk for smok-
ers and nonsmokers, and that the risk for smokers is equal to the
risk for nonsmokers multiplied by the relative risk of death
associated with smoking.
We obtained the prevalence of smoking by age from the
Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System of the Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (8). The relative risks of death
for diseases with well-established associations with smoking
(heart disease, stroke, lung cancer, pneumonia, and influenza)

and for death from any cause were derived from the Cancer
Prevention Study used in the U.S. Surgeon General's Report on
the health consequences of smoking (9). Recently, Thun et al.
(10) developed an adjusted model to account for possible con-
founding of the relative risks in the Surgeon General's report by
various behavioral and demographic factors; they found that
adjustment made little difference in the relative risks. We used
the adjusted relative risk estimates where available (i.e., for each
specific cause of death); otherwise, we used unadjusted values
(i.e., for all-cause mortality).
Chart Format
To make the charts simple to understand, we limited the
amount of data presented and paid particular attention to their
format. The charts present data on the 10-year chance of dying
to provide a reasonable window into the future; to avoid data
overload, they use a starting age of every 5th year (i.e., age 20
years, 25 years, 30 years, and so on) rather than every year.
Mortality data can be represented as counts, proportions, or
rates; we used counts with a stable denominator (e.g., 3 in 1000,
10 in 1000) because there is some evidence suggesting that
people find this format easiest to understand (11­14). The data
in the risk charts are given as the number of deaths per 1000
rather than per 100 000 people because many people have
trouble imagining such a large group (i.e., 100 000 is outside of
common experience) (15). To further simplify the appearance of
the charts, we rounded the number of deaths to the nearest whole
number and shaded cells in which the death rate was less than
1 per 1000. Finally, to help clarify how much each individual
disease category contributes to all-cause mortality, the charts
include the overall chance of dying.
RESULTS
Risk Chart for Never Smokers
Fig. 1 displays the 10-year disease-specific mortality and all-
cause mortality in 5-year increments for women who never
smoked. The first row shows that, for 20-year-old women, death
is uncommon (only four of 1000 women who are 20 years old
will die in the next 10 years) and that accidents are responsible
for half of the deaths that do occur. By the time a woman reaches
40 years of age, heart attack, stroke, colon cancer, breast cancer,
AIDS, and accidents are about equally common causes of death,
although death is still quite infrequent (17 of 1000 women who
are 40 years old will die in the next 10 years). After age 50, heart
attack becomes the single largest cause of death for women.
Breast cancer is the leading cause of cancer death until about age
65, when lung and colon cancer reach about the same magnitude
(although by age 80, lung cancer deaths drop off and colon
cancer deaths exceed breast cancer deaths). By age 75, a wom-
an's chance of dying from pneumonia exceeds her chance of
dying from any one cancer.
The risk chart for nonsmoking men appears in Fig. 2. A
comparison of Fig. 1 and 2 shows that, until age 80, a man's

overall chance of dying in the next 10 years is greater than that
of a woman. Similarly, a man's chance of death from accidents
always exceeds a woman's chance; until age 70, a man's chance
of accidental death is twice that of women. The overall patterns
of death, however, are similar. From age 40 on, heart attack is
the most common single cause of death for men. Until about age
70, a man's chances of dying from lung, colon, or prostate
cancer are all similar; from age 70 on, however, death from
prostate cancer becomes much more common than death from
the other cancers. After age 80, the chance of dying from pneu-
monia exceeds the chance of dying from any one cancer.
Risk Chart for Current Smokers
A current smoker refers to someone who currently smokes
and who has smoked at least 100 cigarettes in his or her lifetime.
At all ages, a smoker's chance of dying in the next 10 years is
greater than that of a never-smoker. Fig. 3 shows that, for female
smokers, lung cancer is the leading cause of death from about
age 40 until age 75; the chance of death from lung cancer is
substantially greater than the chance of death from breast cancer
from age 35 on. After age 75, the chance of dying from a heart
attack exceeds the chance of dying from any of the major can-
cers. Fig. 4 shows that, for men who smoke, heart attack is the
leading cause of death until age 50. Thereafter, the chance of
dying from lung cancer is higher than the chance of dying from
heart attack until about age 80, after which the chance of dying
from heart attack exceeds the chance of dying from lung cancer.
At every age, a man's chance of dying from lung cancer sub-
stantially exceeds his chance of dying from prostate cancer.
DISCUSSION
We created simple charts with age-, sex-, and smoking-
specific data about the chances of dying from various common
causes in the next 10 years. The charts are designed to put the
chance of dying from a given disease in the context of the
chances of dying from other diseases and of dying from any
cause.
Several limitations of the charts merit comment. First, the
charts are only as accurate as the data on which they are based.
We used the 1998 Multiple Cause of Death Public Use File from
the NCHS, the best available national source of mortality data.
Nevertheless, these data are derived from death certificates. The
accuracy of cause-of-death statistics is determined by the ability
of the certifier (usually a physician, medical examiner, or coro-
ner) to properly diagnose the cause of death (4). Although valid
questions have been raised about the reliability of death certifi-
cates (16), they remain the standard source of data about causes
of death in the United States. Second, the charts present data
only about mortality, not about disease incidence. Many people
may be concerned about their chances of developing a disease,
not just their chances of dying from it. Developing incidence
charts will be very challenging, however, because judgments

about incidence are far more ambiguous than judgments about
death. For example, a myocardial infarction can be defined as a
small rise in a serum troponin level or as a substantial creatine
kinase elevation in the context of typical symptoms and EKG
changes. Because reporting on mortality is far less subjective
than defining incident cases, the charts present only the chance
of dying. Similarly, the charts do not present information about
quality of life with different diseases, information that might be
helpful for patients making decisions. Such quality-of-life infor-
mation, however, is not readily available.
Third, our risk estimates are not completely individualized.
Patients with important disease risk factors, such as a strong
family history of a certain disease, might be able to obtain more
precise estimates of their risk of dying from that disease from a
customized assessment (17). We have, however, made an effort
to account for what are arguably the three most important risk
factors for death: age, sex, and smoking. We did not create a set
of charts for former smokers because their risk estimates will
vary according to a variety of factors [e.g., length of time since
stopping smoking, extent of prior smoke exposure, and age of
initiation of regular smoking (9)]. It is reasonable to assume that
the risks for former smokers are intermediate between those of
current smokers and never smokers (and that the longer the time
since the last cigarette, the closer the former smoker's risk ap-
proximates that of a never smoker) (9,10). It should be noted that
our charts do have several distinct advantages over interactive
computer applications: they are inexpensive, they can be used
anywhere, and they require no special hardware or trained per-
sonnel.
We believe that our risk charts will help people better under-
stand and compare the important health threats they face. The
charts could be posted in clinic offices or distributed to patients
for easy reference when decisions (e.g., about cancer screening)
are being made. Because the charts give people a sense of how
much smoking adds to their chance of dying at every age, they
may also be useful in smoking prevention and cessation efforts.
We believe that the risk charts are a good first step at helping
physicians and their patients put cancer and other disease risks in
context.
