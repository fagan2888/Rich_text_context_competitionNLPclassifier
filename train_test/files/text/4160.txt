Introduction
Nigerian women especially from the south-west had been
involved in activities outside the home as traders, farmers,
and merchants (Anugwom, 2009) before colonization. They
were also a force to reckon with in community activities;
hence, they were addressed as Iya Loja (important woman in
the market place), Iya laje (astute business woman), Iya lode
(a female public figure), Erelu (a female chief in Egba land),
which are female chieftaincy titles to eulogize and recognize
the various achievements and hard work of women (Ekejiuba,
1991; Lebeuf, 1963, Okonjo, 1976, 1991; Pereira, 2007;
Sator, 1992). In the pre-colonial era, women in the south-
western region of Nigeria and some other parts had their
share of social responsibilities and leadership roles
(Uwaezuoke & Ezeh, 2008). During colonization, women
became disadvantaged because they were predominantly
not-lettered and ill equipped for white- or blue-collar jobs.
According to Uwaezuoke and Ezeh (2008),
. . .The overall feeble position of female education in comparison
to the male counterpart did not augur well for the social,
economic and political development of women in Nigeria. At a
time when literary education was becoming the master key to a
successful life in modern society, the different agencies
responsible for the instruction of the Nigerian youth invested in
upgrading the formation of boys to the detriment of girls. (p.11)
This means that many women were unemployable during
the colonial era (McIntosh, 2009). Hence, the foundation of
the workplace, professions, and leadership offered unequal
opportunities (Uwaezuoke & Ezeh, 2008).
The access of women to occupations and leadership posi-
tions became constrained not only by level of education but
also by gender roles as defined by the British culture
(Olojede, 2009; Olowe, 2001). Therefore, the traditional
structures that gave room for women's visibility outside the
home and in leadership were disrupted (Okonjo, 1975;
Olojede, 1986). This is evident in the past and present gender
structures of political office holders, the Civil Service, and
the organized private sector (William, 1989). In the Nigerian
Federal Civil Service, which is the largest single-entity
employer in Nigeria, 76% of civil servants are men, while
24% are women (CIDA Nigeria GSAA, 2006). Furthermore,
in spite of the appointment of women as Permanent
Secretaries, they hold less than 14% of the total manage-
ment-level positions in the Nigerian public sector. In Lagos
state Nigeria, private-sector involvement of women as

Social Predictors of Female Academics'
Career Growth and Leadership Position in
South-West Nigerian Universities
Adepeju Olaide Oti (Née Aderogba)1
Abstract
This study examined the efficacy of social predictors of female academics' career growth and leadership position in Nigerian
universities. Results show that the composite effect of the social predictors are significant (F = 37.888; p < .05). Parental
influence ( = .197; p < .05) and spousal support ( = .183; p < .05) made significant contributions to career growth, while
academic men attitude toward women ( = .428; p > .05), academic men collegial support ( = .419; p < .05), parental
influence ( = .368; p < .05), and spousal support ( = .250; p < .05) contributed to leadership position. Parental influence
(B = -.12; t = -4.89; p < .05) and spousal support (B = .13; t = 4.26; p < .05) predicted career growth, while academic men
attitude toward women (B = .947; t = 3.755; p < .05), academic men collegial support (B = -1.080; t = -3.648; p < .05),
parental influence (B = -.220; t = -9.050; p < .05), and spousal support (B = .191; t = 6.343; p < .05) predicted leadership
position. The implications are that parental influence and spousal supports are essential for career growth, while all four
factors are crucial for female academics' leadership attainment.

directors and top management were 13.87% and 13.84%,
respectively, in 2005, while 8.14% and 13.11% were recorded
for women directors and top managers, respectively, in 2006,
representing a slight decline of their involvement in the suc-
ceeding year (Goldstar Directories, 2006, 2007).
In governance, Nigerian women marginally participate;
they remain almost invisible in the party system. While the
parties claim to encourage women participation in elective
positions through free nomination, in practice they are dis-
criminated against. Although Nigerian governments have
scored well on adopting and or formulating measures to
address gender justice, they have however failed to allocate
resources critical to the implementation of these measures
(Umeha, 2010). An analysis of Nigerian electoral system
shows that the 2003, 2007, and 2011 elections witnessed
unprecedented increase in the number of female aspirants
and heightened local mobilization of the generality of
women, yet only a handful made it to the end. In the last 2011
election, women candidates constituted 9.1% of the total
number of candidates who contested in the April 2011 polls,
leaving 90.9% as male candidates across political parties
(Akiyode-Afolabi, 2011).
Nigerian women have no doubt made in-road in almost all
sectors of the Nigerian economy and their visibility in pro-
fessions like Medicine, Pharmacy, Law, and Academics can
no longer be ignored. Notwithstanding, they are yet to form
critical mass at the top; therefore, the social predictors of
female academics' career growth and leadership position in
the oldest six south-west Nigerian Universities are examined
in this study. Studies have indicated that several factors mili-
tate against the careers of women and their attainment of
leadership in academia, some of which are sex-harassment
(African Association of Political Science, 1994; Aina &
Odebiyi, 2002; Denga & Denga, 2004), low self-esteem, low
self-efficacy (Chovwen, 2004; Oti, 2011), work/home con-
flicts (Oti & Oyelude, 2006), the challenges of being female
in highly gendered academic institutions (Gaidzanwa 2001;
Morley, Sorhaindo, & Burke, 2005; Odejide, Akanji, &
Odekunle, 2005; Pereira, 2007), and leadership (Chesterman,
2004; Odejide, 2006; Oti, 2011). However, social predictors
of female academics' career growth and leadership position
are yet to be explored, especially in Nigerian Universities.
In the past two decades, participation of women in higher
education has improved (Mabawonku, 2006; Odejide, 2006;
Singh, 2002), but despite this improvement, women still lag
behind as academic staff and have slow career advancement
compared with that of men (Chesterman, 2004; De la Rey,
1998; Morley, 2005; Tower, Plummer, & Ridgewell, 2007).
Women make up about half of the workforce in most devel-
oped countries (United States, Australia, and Canada), yet
they occupy less than 5% of senior executive seats (Morley,
2005; Ragins, Townsend, & Mattis, 1998; Tharenou, 1999).
This implies that while the women are flooding the manage-
rial pipeline, their efforts to attain the most senior levels are
being blocked (Rindfleish, 2002). Rindfleish argued that
women's participation in paid workforce has been one of the
most remarkable social changes over the past 40 years, yet
women are excluded from the most senior positions within
organizations and executive boards; Chovwen (2004) and
Kamau (2004) also drew similar conclusions. According to
Singh (2002), women make up less than three quarters of the
academic staff of Universities, and are less than 10% among
the very top position. This study however examines the pre-
dictive nature of social support variables: attitudes toward
women; spousal, parental, and collegial support to the career
growth; and leadership of female academics in Nigerian
Universities.
Literature Review
The literature reviews past studies on social support and its
influence on the careers of women in general and academic
women to be specific.
Social Support and Women's Career
Social support has been defined as the "actions of others that
are either helpful or intended to be helpful" (Deelstra et al.,
2003, p. 324). It includes a variety of interpersonal behaviors
among workers that enhance individuals' psychological or
behavioral functioning. These may include mentoring, pro-
viding emotional support, assisting others with assigned
tasks, and teaching about social power structures (Hill,
Bahniuk, Dobos, & Rouner, 1989). Beginning with the earli-
est need-fulfillment theories of job satisfaction, social sup-
port has been identified as a predictor of job satisfaction
(Orpen & Pinshaw, 1975; Smither, 1988; Stamps, 1997;
Vroom, 1964).
Social support also predicts a variety of negative out-
comes, including absenteeism and turnover (Winstead,
Derlega, Montgomery, & Pilkington, 1995), burnout
(Myung-Yong & Harrison, 1998), and depression and anxi-
ety (El-Bassel, Guterman, Bargal, & Su, 1998; Olson &
Shultz, 1994). Findings may be mixed because the construct
of social support is multifaceted (Bahniuk, Dobos, & Hill,
1990). The source of support may be a supervisor, mentor, or
colleague, spouse, and parents or parent figure. The content
of the support may include information, appraisal, assistance
with tasks, or emotional support (Bahniuk et al., 1990;
Deelstra et al., 2003).
Spousal and Parental Support
Harris, Winskowski, and Engdahl (2007) found perceived
spousal support and workplace social support to predict job
satisfaction and job tenure. Scott and King (1985) found that
spousal support is a predictor of whether women college stu-
dents will return to school, while Cutrona and Suhr (1994)
Oti 3
and Derlega, Barbee, and Winstead (1994) found that lack of
social support is a predictor of negative outcomes, including
absenteeism, burnout, depression, and anxiety.
Though family issues have been found to interfere in the
careers of men and women, Colletti, Mulholland, and Sonnad
(2000) found social and family issues to be a major concern
for both male and female academic surgeons. However, both
men and women report differences in the conflict between
family and career responsibilities and perceptions of balanc-
ing those responsibilities for men and women. Two thirds of
men and women reported that the demands of their surgical
faculty position adversely affect their relationships with
spouses. Men reported a slightly higher tendency to miss
family activities because of job demands (35 [77%] vs. 6
[67%]), while women were significantly more likely to miss
work activities because of family responsibilities (5 [56%]
vs. 9 [20%]).
In addition, women have been known to be caregivers
(Biernat & Wortman, 1991; Oti, 2001). This may explain
why they have excelled in careers like Nursing, secretarial
profession, and teaching at lower levels. Studies have also
affirmed that they give support to their spouses, children, and
significant others (Aremu, 1999; Aryee, 1992; Buckingham
& Coffman, 1999; James, 2002; Okonweze, 2005; Oluwole,
Hammed, & Awaebe, 2010), but women themselves lack the
necessary support that may be required to foster the growth
they need in their different careers and life's endeavors
(Biernat & Wortman, 1991; Chovwen, 2004; Oti & Oyelude,
2006). Oti and Oyelude (2006) find work/home conflict to be
strong determinant of career progression of female academ-
ics in a university in Nigeria, the career mobility of these
academic women is slower; they begin to have full concen-
tration and career mobility as their children become more
mature and able to take care of themselves.
A study found that mothers are the most critical influence
for developing leadership qualities and readiness in their
daughters during their upbringing (Matz, 2002). Contrary to
Matz's finding, fathers are also influential for girls and young
women in the development of leadership competencies
(Madsen, 2006).
Women's Career and Collegiality
Significant among the factors influencing women's career
are workplace and collegial supports, which have been iden-
tified as important factors in job satisfaction (Harris et al.,
2007). A small but growing body of literature has identified
that supportive work environments are important factors that
influence tenure achievement for faculty (Young & Wright,
2001). Specifically, support (or lack thereof) from colleagues
and deans or departments heads has been identified as an
influential piece of the tenure process (Ifedi, 2008; Olson &
Shultz, 1994; Tharenou, 1999). In a recent study of new
geography professors, findings indicated that all faculty
members benefit significantly from supportive collegial
environments and supportive department chairpersons
(Solem & Foote, 2006).
The role of collegial support specifically relating to par-
enting academics who are seeking tenure has been investi-
gated (O'Laughlin & Bischoff, 2005; Young & Wright,
2001). Recent qualitative and quantitative work has exam-
ined how departmental support for balancing dual roles is
differently experienced by men and women on the tenure
track (O'Laughlin & Bischoff, 2005; Grant, Kennelly, &
Ward, 2000; Young & Wright, 2001). In their study of moth-
ers on the tenure track, Young and Wright found that moth-
ers perceived their experiences in the tenure-making process
to be very different from their non-mother colleagues. In
this qualitative study of 22 mothers, respondents reported
feeling as though their colleagues questioned their abilities
to be productive or competitive when compared with non-
parenting colleagues, while respondents also reported feel-
ing that parenting and non-parenting men were not subjected
to the same degree of judgment or scrutiny. One third of the
respondents also reported that they lacked support from
colleagues.
Some findings validate the claim that universities in
which female academics achieve senior positions are those in
which some supportive practices toward women exist. For
instance, Chesterman (2004) sought to verify if five
Australian universities where women achieved promotion,
and remained in senior positions, had particular cultural
characteristics that supported and sustained women.
Universities around Australia had been encouraged by gov-
ernment equity legislation to adopt a proactive measure
toward the promotion of women into senior management.
Across all five universities, there was unanimity about the
factors that encouraged women to apply for senior positions
and that sustained and supported them in those positions.
These were clear supports from organizational leaders, a
critical mass of other women in senior positions, opportuni-
ties to network, and strong statements on values. Those inter-
viewed indicated that the most significant support was that
from the chief executive or the direct superior to the woman.
Executives had to go beyond rhetoric, and demonstrate their
support of women and equity through endorsement of wom-
en's performance, encouragement of women to apply for
promotion, and commitment of resources to development,
such as training courses.
Collegial support includes sharing friendships, personal
problems, and confidences. Bahniuk et al. (1990) found that,
among business managers, instrumental support from col-
leagues and mentoring predicted higher levels of job satis-
faction, along with perceived success, managerial level, and
income. The relationship between workplace social support
and the length of time an employee chooses to remain at the
same job (job tenure) has recently been explored. Positive
relationships with supervisors have been reported to strongly
predict job tenure (Buckingham & Coffman, 1999; Van
Breukelen, Van Der Vlist, & Steensma, 2004; Vecchio &
4 SAGE Open
Boatwright, 2002). Collegial support, mentoring, and career
shadowing have also been found to be rewarding, and deter-
minants of job satisfaction and leadership especially for
junior female academics (Eliason, Berggren, & Bondestam,
2000; Oti & Oyelude, 2006). Apart from parental, spousal,
and collegial support, another factor that influences women's
career is societal attitude toward their career life and leader-
ship influence.
Attitudes Toward Women in Career
and Leadership
Research has reiterated that general attitudes of superiors and
subordinates to women in career and leadership position are
most of the time unwelcoming (Odejide, 2006; Oti, 2011).
Therefore, many women in male-dominated careers suffer
isolation, rejection, and opposition (Chovwen, 2004; Kamau,
2004). Those who have sufficient social support are more
likely to progress faster and succeed than those who do not
(Eliason et al., 2000; Oti, 2011).
Some studies affirmed that academic women face overt
and covert discriminatory practices and micro-politics in the
university system (De la Rey, 1998; Odejide, Akanji, &
Odekunle, 2006), which undermines their career growth, vis-
ibility, and space in decision-making positions. Is this atti-
tude cultural or universal?
Theoretical Framework
This study is grounded in the Role Congruity Theory
advanced by Eagly and Karau (2002). Role congruity theory
of prejudice toward female leaders proposes that perceived
incongruity between the female gender and leadership roles
leads to two forms of prejudice: (a) perceiving women less
favorably than men as potential occupants of leadership roles
and (b) evaluating behavior that fulfills the prescriptions of a
leader role less favorably when it is enacted by a woman.
One consequence is that attitudes are less positive toward
female than male leaders and potential leaders. Other conse-
quences are that it is more difficult for women to become
leaders and achieve success in leadership roles. Evidence
from varied research paradigms substantiates that these con-
sequences occur, especially in situations that heighten per-
ceptions of incongruity between the female gender and
leadership roles.
Research has shown that women who attain success in
typically male occupations are less liked and more derogated
than equally successful men (Chovwen, 2004; Heilman,
Wallen, Fuchs, & Tamkins, 2004). This disfavor can have
negative effects on females' career outcomes, as women at
the upper levels of management receive fewer promotions
than comparable men (Heilman et al., 2004). Research shows
that "a woman's success can create new problems for her by
instigating her social rejection" (Chovwen, 2004; Heilman
et al., 2004; p. 416; Kamau, 2004). This theory gives cre-
dence to why women do not gain social support in careers
and leadership; parents may be scared that success will bring
their daughters social rejection, husbands' perception of
insecurity, and fear of role reversal and colleagues' fear of
competition from the "weaker sex" (Kamau, 2004).
Methodology
Research Design
This study adopts a descriptive research design of the ex-post
facto type. Close-ended questionnaires were constructed to
elicit responses from respondents.
Population
The population of study included 511 female academics
from graduate assistant to professor and 300 male academics
in the senior cadre in six universities in south-west Nigeria.
Research Instruments
Three research instruments were used to collect data for the
study. They were as follows:
1. Social Factors Instruments: Comprising four ques-
tionnaires: (a) Spousal support questionnaire (devel-
oped by the researcher). Respondents were female
academics; questions were 17 close-ended items.
Questions centered on the kind of support female
academics receive from their husbands, for example,
"my husband baby sits, does school run, takes care of
the children when I'm away, goes to the market, sup-
ports me financially, and so on." (b) Parental influ-
ence questionnaire was developed by the researcher.
Respondents were female academics; questions were
18 close-ended items, which elicited the kind of rap-
port/relationship female academics had with their
parents or locus parentis in retrospect and the influ-
ence it has on their career, for example, "my father/
mother had high expectation of me," "my father/
mother instilled in me a love for learning," "my
father/mother believed that having a career for a
woman was very important." (c) Academic men col-
legial support (developed by the researcher). These
were 16 close-ended items. It elicited responses from
male academics on their working relationship with
their female colleagues, some of the statements were
"I have excellent working relations with my female
colleagues," "I like my female superiors," and so on
(d) Academic men attitude toward women (adapted
from Spence & Helmrich, 1978) scales. It comprised
19 close-ended statements. This was meant to mea-
sure the general attitude of male academics toward
Oti 5
women, which is either egalitarian or traditional,
such as women should take increasing responsibility
for leadership in solving intellectual and social prob-
lems, husband and wife should be allowed the same
grounds for divorce, a woman should not expect to
have quite the same freedom as a man, and so on.
2. Academic Women's Career Growth Questionnaire
(Developed by the Researcher): This comprises 13
statements such as "my university encourages the use
of personal initiative on the job," "my personal career
growth is stunted because I have not met the demand
of publishing scholarly articles," "career growth in
the university system favors men more than women,
and so on."
3. Academic Women's Perception of Leadership Position
Questionnaire (Developed by the Researcher): These
are 16-item statements which elicited responses from
female academics. Some of which are "leadership
takes one away from research and publication, so I
would rather not lead"; "I prefer leadership in teach-
ing to administrative leadership"; and "leadership
requires too much politics which I am not prepared
for."
Procedure and Sampling Techniques of the Study
A multi-stage sampling technique was used for the study.
The first stage involved the listing of all-approved federal-
and state-funded universities in Nigeria and the extraction
and stratification of Universities in south west of the country,
six oldest universities in each state of the south-western
Nigeria were purposively selected. This was under the
assumption that they will have adequate number of academic
women needed for the sample, as critical mass of female
population as academics is still difficult to come by.
Incidentally, the oldest universities in the region are four fed-
eral and two state universities out of five federal and nine
state universities in the southwest as at the time of data col-
lection; this represents 45% of the university population at
the time of data collection. Questionnaires were adminis-
tered to 600 female academics from assistant lecturer to pro-
fessor. They were purposively selected because they were
the major focus of the study. Proportionate stratified random
sampling was used in their selection from each of the
Universities. However, 511 questionnaires were returned and
analyzed for the female academics. Three hundred male aca-
demics from senior lecturer to professor were disproportion-
ately selected (50 from each university) under the assumption
that they are colleagues of academic women. Two hundred
and ninety-seven of these were returned and analyzed.
Reliability and Data Analysis
The reliability of the instruments was determined through a
pilot study of 50 randomly selected respondents from two
privately owned universities. Reliability coefficient was
obtained using Cronbach's alpha: social, r = 0.87; career
growth, r = 0.79; and academic leadership questionnaires,
r = 0.84. Data were analyzed using multiple regression.

of social predictors (parental influence, spousal and col-
legial support, and attitudes toward women) to female
academics' (a) career growth and (b) leadership position?

Results
Research Question 1a
What is the composite effect of the social variables (parental
influence, spousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward
women) on female academics' career growth?
From Table 1, parental influence has a negative and weak
relationship which is significant with career growth
(R = -.175; p < .05). The table also shows that spousal sup-
port has a positive, weak, and significant relationship with
the dependant measure (R = .162; p < .05). However, colle-
gial support (R = .028; p > .05) and attitude toward women
(R = .054; p > .05) have very weak positive relationship,
which are not significant with career growth. To determine
the composite effect of the four social variables on career
growth, Table 2 is presented.
Table 2 shows that the four social factors parental influ-
ence, spousal support, collegial support, and attitude toward
women jointly correlate positively with career growth (R =
.260). The R2 value of .068 also shows that 6.8% of the vari-
ance in career growth is due to the four social factors leaving
the remaining 93.2% to other factors and residuals. The sig-
nificance of the R value is determined using Table 3.
Table 3 shows that the composite effect of the social fac-
tors as indicated by the R value of .260 is significant (F =
9.208; p < .05) on career growth. Hence, the R value is not
due to chance.
Research Question 1b
What is the composite effect of the social factors (parental
influence, spousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward
women) on female academics' leadership position?

From Table 4, parental influence has a negative, weak,
significant relationship with female academics' career
growth (R = -.376; p < .05); spousal support has a weak,
positive relationship which is also significant (R = .217; p <
.05); collegial support has a negative, weak, and not signifi-
cant relationship (R = -.072; p > .05); and attitude toward
women has a positive, weak, and not significant relationship
with women's leadership position (R = .081; p > .05). The
composite effect is presented in Table 5.
Table 5 shows that the four social factors parental influ-
ence, spousal support, collegial support, and attitudes toward
women have positive multiple relationship with female aca-
demics' leadership position (R = .480). Also, the R2 value of
.230 indicates that they could explain 23.0% of the variance
in leadership positions. The remaining 77.0% is due to other
factors and residuals. This composite effect is tested for sig-
nificance on Table 6.
Table 6 shows that the composite effect of the social fac-
tors as indicated by the R value of .830 is significant (F =
37.888; p < .05). Hence, the R value is not due to chance.
Therefore, social factors have significant composite effect on
female academics leadership positions.
Research Question 2a
What are the relative contributions of parental influence,
spousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward women to
female academics' career growth?
Table 7 shows that parental influence made the greatest
contribution to female academics' career growth ( = .197;
p < .05). This is a significant contribution. Spousal support is
next in decreasing magnitude ( = .183; p < .05). This is also
a significant contribution. The third on the list in the order is
the contribution of attitude toward women ( = .078; p > .05)
while the lowest contribution is that made by collegial sup-
port ( = .016; p > .05). These two factors made no signifi-
cant contributions to female academics' career growth.
Research Question 2b
What are the relative contributions of the social factors
parental influence, spousal and collegial support, and atti-
tudes toward women to female academics' leadership
position?
Table 8 shows that attitude toward women made the great-
est contribution to leadership position ( = .428; p > .05).
This is followed by collegial support ( = .419; p < .05),
parental influence ( = .368; P < .05), and spousal support (
= .250; p < .05) in that order. All these contributions are
significant.
Research Question 3a
To what extent would the social variables parental influence,
spousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward women
predict female academics' career growth?
From Table 7, both parental influence (B = -.112;
t = -4.402; p < .05) and spousal support (B = .133; t = 4.216;

On the other hand, attitude toward women (B = .164; t = .623;
p > .05) and collegial support (B = -3.92 E-02; t = 1.27;
p > .05) could not predict female academics' career growth.
Research Question 3b
To what extent would social variables parental influence,
spousal and collegial support, and attitudes toward women
predict female academics' leadership position?
Table 8 shows that all the four social factors could inde-
pendently predict female academics' leadership position.
These are attitude (B = .947; t = 3.755; p < .05), collegial
support (B = -1.080; t = -3.648; p < .05), parental influence
(B = -.220; t = -9.050; p < .05), and spousal support
(B = .191; t = 6.343; p < .05).
Discussion
Social support has been found to predict job satisfaction by
previous studies (Orpen & Pinshaw, 1975; Smither, 1988;
Stamps, 1997; Vroom, 1964). It has also been established to
predict negative outcomes, like absenteeism, staff turnover
(Winstead et al., 1995), burnout (Myung-Yong & Harrison,
1998), depression, and anxiety (El-Bassel et al., 1998; Olson
& Shultz, 1994) in work environment. This study has gone
further to show that apart from being a predictor of job satis-
faction and other variables, social support is a predictor of
career growth. It also predicts whether a woman will seek
leadership position or not.
Contrary to the submission of Winstead et al. (1995), who
found that social support predicted burnout (Myung-Yong &
Harrison, 1998), depression, and anxiety, (El-Bassel et al.,
1998; Olson & Shultz, 1994), this study found that women
who had spousal and parental support in retrospect have
more confidence to perform leadership roles and advance
better in their career than those who do not.
This study agrees with Harris et al. (2007) on spousal sup-
port predicting job satisfaction and tenure, but disagrees with
workplace social support as predictors of job satisfaction and
job tenure. This is because spousal support predicted career
growth and leadership position, while collegial support and
attitude toward women could not predict women's career
growth, but predicted leadership position. This could be due
to the fact that leadership position is more political and elec-
tive; therefore, women would need the physical support of
the male majority, whereas they need more of individual hard
work, resilience, and the spirit of competition to grow in
their career, they also require understanding and the support
of their husband at the home-front for them to have signifi-
cant growth.
This study corroborate earlier findings which reiterate
that general attitudes of superiors and subordinates to women
in career and leadership position are most of the time unwel-
coming (Chovwen, 2007; Odejide, 2006; Oti, 2011), this has
been found to affect women negatively. This study found
attitude toward women and academic men's collegial

support to predict female academics' leadership position.
This finding is in congruence with Kanter's (1977) grounded
theory which states that perceived incongruity between the
female gender and leadership roles leads to prejudice. This
research found the above to be true, as women could grow in
their career as long as they are able to meet requirements for
promotion through hard work; but negative attitudes and
lack of support affect their reaching leadership position. On
the other hand, they may attain leadership through their
efforts but may not receive the necessary acceptance and
respect the position demands (Kamau, 2004; Odejide, 2006).
Moreover, negative attitudes and lack of spousal support
might also count against their candidacy if they are seeking
elective positions in a male-dominated career, because men
as well as jealous women will not vote for them (Odejide,
2006; Oti, 2011).
Implications for Women in Career and
Leadership
It is pertinent to note that though women are entering into
academics in significant numbers, they are still a minority.
Furthermore, the culture of academics is still very much dic-
tated by male hegemony. Aside from these, the lives of
female academics is also shaped and greatly influenced by
culture and their experiences in the home. This can go a long
way to determine how far they go in aspiring to lead or sus-
taining leadership position. Women's desire and aspiration to
lead is shaped by the kind of relationship they have with their
parents, this goes a long way in building their self-confi-
dence. Moreover, if women really desire to lead, especially
in a male-dominated environment, they must learn the rules
of the game. They must learn how to gain the support of their
male colleagues who are in the majority, bearing in mind the
patriarchal culture of Nigerian men wanting to dominate
even when they are less qualified.
Conclusion
This research investigated whether social support which
comprises four variables would predict female academics'
career growth and leadership position. It was found that as a
whole, social support predicted career growth and leadership
position. However, when taken independently, two of the
variables, spousal support and parental influence, were sig-
nificant in the prediction of career growth and leadership
position. Notwithstanding, all four independent variables
(spousal support, parental influence, academic men collegial
support, and attitude toward women) predicted leadership
positions. This means that women academics were prepared
for the odds the occupation offered, being in a male-domi-
nated occupation, though their career is generally slower
compared with their male academics due to the pressure
from marriage, childbearing, and rearing. They are in no way
inferior intellectually to their male colleagues. Academic
women are reluctant leaders because they view leadership
from a different perspective and nurse the fear of failure. It
was concluded that academic women need to seek the
Oti 9
support of spouses. Parents need to encourage their female
children to aspire against all social odds. Academic men
need to change their stereotype behavior toward their female
colleagues.
Fraught with limitations emanating from the small sam-
ple, the miniature geographical location of south-western
Nigeria and the limitation of the universities to Federal and
State alone, nonetheless, the results of this study is valid.
They provide a significant insight into the predictive nature
of social support variable to female academics' career grow
and leadership positions. Future research can compare the
career growth and leadership positions of never-married
female academics and the married; this is with the view of
finding out the influence of marital status on women's career.
