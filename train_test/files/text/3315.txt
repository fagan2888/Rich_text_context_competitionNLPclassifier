Introduction
Student assessment is a compulsory component at all levels
of education and comes in various forms. Educators have
increased student empowerment in classroom assessments to
increase motivation, interest, and student engagement to
enhance learning (Sanders, Boss, Boss, & McConkie, 2011).
Students' collaborative efforts are positive as "students learn
best when they take an active role in the education process,
discussing what they read, practicing what they learn, and
applying concepts and ideas" (Davis, 1993, as cited in Smart
& Csapo, 2007, p. 451). Moreover, Farooq and Regnier
(2011) mentioned that "learning experiences are being mani-
fest in the form of new approaches, theories, philosophies
and meta-cognition" (p. 28).
With this in mind, the researcher began to introduce the
concept of student collaboration during tests to create excite-
ment and motivate students to study harder for tests. This is
in line with the findings of Zapatero, Maheshwari, and Chen
(2012) that "students' performance in traditional examina-
tion does not improve at the same rate with higher level of
collaborative environment" and that "while changing the
classroom environment, testing methods and tools must also
change according to reflect the full effect of the collaborative
learning" (p. 102).
It took the researcher a period of 7 years (2005-2012) to
experiment with cooperative tests that were administered
either quarterly, semi-annually, or annually during a class
period of 45 min. The initial tests were experimented with
group tests of two students, four students, and even a class
test (one test for the entire class). After a few years of experi-
mentation, she discovered that the best test was the one with
two options open to all students: (a) individual test and (b)
pair test (two persons taking one test together). She also real-
ized that disagreements over answers could be easily resolved
by simply allowing students to have an option of having their
own individual answer sheets (two answer sheets) instead of
one. Students opting to take pair tests were allowed the privi-
lege of choosing whom to work with. Although there might
be a concern regarding disturbances as a result of discus-
sions, it had never been a problem as discussions had always
been done very quietly. The usual percentage of students opt-
ing for pair tests is approximately 95% while the remaining
students worked individually on their tests, either because of
the student's preference to work alone, or simply because the
student did not have a partner to work with.
The literature that exists in pair testing pertains to com-
puter software development where two members work
together as a team to test the application of the software

Pair Tests in a High School Classroom:
Another Option for Students and
Teachers
Rachaniphorn Ngotngamwong1
Abstract
This study was conducted to find out how high school students responded to pair tests: the collaboration of two students in
taking a test together. The objectives of pair tests were intended to create excitement, a higher motivation to study, increase
learning through discussion, and close collaboration during a test. The outcome of the study indicated that the majority of
the students enjoyed pair tests, and there were increases in motivation, discussion, learning, and collaboration. The main
downsides of pair tests were disagreements over answers and the laziness of some test takers as this behavior created
negative impacts on their responsible partners. The overall picture of pair tests was positive, and it is recommended that
they are administered not more than once a quarter.

Porter, Guzdial, McDowell, & Simon, 2013; Salleh, Mendes,
& Grundy, 2011). Although there is limited literature to be
found in the area of taking tests in pairs (pair tests), there is
plentiful literature on cooperative learning in pairs. This arti-
cle presents the proposal of using pair tests in the high school
classroom as another alternative assessment for both teach-
ers and students and acts as a contribution to scarce litera-
ture. This contribution is supported by Zapatero et al. (2012)
who stated that the emphasis on measurement techniques in
a collaborative environment is minimal, and "there is a need
for more research in the area of assessment of the active/col-
laborative learning environment" (p. 103).
Literature Review
Assessment
Assessment is the primary tool used in student placement,
grade assignment, grade-level promotion, and graduation.
However, there has been an evolution in the definition of
assessment today. Moon (2005) defines it as "the process of
observing student learning by collaborating with students to
collect and interpret data about their academic strengths and
weaknesses, interests, and learning preferences, with the
goal of making decisions that benefit their instruction"
(p. 227).
Traditional classroom measurement assessments such as
quizzes, tests, projects, or other similar assessment tools,
have had to a large extent, failed to take into consideration,
the "collaborative and constructivist learning taking place in
the active learning environment" (Zapatero et al., 2012, p.
103). Zapatero et al. (2012) also went on to state that the
"traditional testing mechanism may not capture all different
aspects of the learning taking place in the active learning
environment classrooms" (p. 104).
The availability of assessment alternatives are plentiful
today for educators to choose from and special care is needed
in the "selection or development of proper assessment tools"
(Stiggins & Chappuis, 2005, p. 16). Aside from traditional
assessment methods, assessment technologies are readily
available and widely used, thus providing a wide array of
benefits to not only students but also to educators as well.
Assessments act as a useful feedback tool for educators in
supporting student achievement, motivation, and in helping
them toward their learning targets (Heritage, 2007; Nolen,
2011; Starkman, 2006; Stiggins & Chappuis, 2005; William,
2006).
Student as Learners
There has been a tremendous transformation in school learn-
ing during the past few decades, with deviation away from
the traditional, teacher-centered classroom toward a more
student-centered classroom with a greater emphasis on the
learners' needs (I-Ying & Wan-Yu, 2012). Numerous studies
have also found out that learning is enhanced with positive
learning outcomes when students are actively involved in the
learning process, also known as active learning.Active learn-
ing is student centered rather than teacher centered, as stu-
dents are more engaged, gain deep learning, acquire greater
problem-solving and critical thinking abilities, and enjoy
themselves (Benek-Rivera & Matthews, 2004; Sarason &
Banbury, 2004; Smart & Csapo, 2007; Watkins, 2005;
Zapatero et al., 2012).
Student Collaboration
As the significance of teamwork increases in organizations,
preparing students to collaborate by working in teams has
entered institutions with training starting at a very young
age, and all the way up to higher education in the form of
assignments and projects (Cox & Bobrowski, 2004; Fredrick,
2008; Kalliath & Laiken, 2006; Nickels, Parris, Gossett, &
Alexander, 2010; Stewart & Barrick, 2000; Tabatabaei &
Lam, 2013). This collaborative effort is found distinctively
in cooperative small group learning that is reputed in pro-
moting socialization and learning across K-12 schools and
colleges. By working cooperatively with each other, students
learn to (a) share their ideas, (b) be open to other perspec-
tives, (c) cultivate better listening skills, (d) give and gain,
(e) be conflict managers, (f) gain academic and social sup-
port, (g) have a higher self-esteem, and (h) apply knowledge
as they gain greater understanding (Bertucci, Conte, Johnson,
& Johnson, 2010; Cox & Bobrowski, 2004; Dewey, 1938,
and Locke, 1693/2000, as cited in Smart & Csapo, 2007;
Gillies, 2003; Johnson & Johnson, 2005; Kalliath & Laiken,
2006; Koppenhaver & Shrader, 2003; Ukens, 2004; Zapatero
et al., 2012).
Working in Pairs, Groups, and Individually
Collaboration is frequently seen in groups or pairs because
"groups collaborate more effectively when individuals learn
from each other" ("Pair Up to Foster More Learning," 2014,
p. 6). Moreover, the social independence theory state that
there are higher achievements in cooperative groups com-
pared with those who work individually (Bertucci et al.,
2010; Johnson & Johnson, 2005).
While some researchers believe that productivity increases
with group size, others state that the bigger the group size,
the more social loafing and complexities are involved in
coordination (Bertucci et al., 2010). This is supported by a
study conducted by Bertucci et al. (2010), where "students in
groups of four did not achieve higher results than students
working in pairs" (p. 267). By working in pairs, students gain
a higher self-esteem, and bond faster at a more personal level
as there are only two individuals (Bertucci et al., 2010).
Living in a digital age where information technology is
widespread, and increasing in significance, student collabo-
ration has changed tremendously. There is active student
Ngotngamwong 3
collaboration in chat rooms, discussion forums, through
e-mail, groupware, and text messages. This digital collabora-
tion is a form of virtual teamwork, which is commonplace in
business, and being capable of working effectively in virtual
teams is a necessity (Fletcher, 2009; Hunsaker, Pavett, &
Hunsaker, 2011; Nunamaker, Reinig, & Briggs, 2009; Shea,
Sherer, Quilling, & Blewett, 2011; Yassine, 2011). Pair test-
ing or pair programming, consists of members working in
pairs by using one computer on the same task. Findings on
pair testing are positive as working in pairs has resulted in
higher levels of performance, communication, learning to
give and accept suggestions, satisfaction, grades, and confi-
dence compared with working individually (Balijepally
et al., 2009; Dawande et al., 2008; di Bella et al., 2013; Porter
et al., 2013; Salleh et al., 2011).
Research Methodology
The quantitative research design was chosen for this study,
and descriptive statistics was used in data analysis.
Participants of the study included 55 high school students
who were engaged in pair tests administered quarterly for the
entire school year during a normal class period of 45 min.
Paper questionnaires were administered in class at the end of
the academic school year in 2012 and excel was used in data
analysis. The purpose of the study was to find out the effec-
tiveness of pair tests in the classroom and this was answered
by the following three research questions:
Research Question 1 (RQ1): Should pair tests be admin-
istered to high school students?
Research Question 2 (RQ2): What were the students'
perceptions regarding pair tests?
Research Question 3 (RQ3): What were the students'
positive and negative opinions about pair tests?
These research questions were answered through a semi-
structured questionnaire consisting of four sections, and a
total of 28 questions. In Section A, the first 4 open-ended
questions sought to find out if pair tests should be adminis-
tered, whereas the next 16 open-ended questions found in
Section B sought to find out students' perceptions of pair
tests. Two open-ended questions had been added to the ques-
tionnaire in Section C with the goal of giving students the
opportunity to express their opinions in their own words
regarding the positive and negative effects of pair tests. The
6 last questions in Section D provided basic demographic
profile of participants.
Research Findings
Respondents' Profile
Out of the total of 55 respondents, 64% were female, and
36% were male, and up to 77.2% of the respondents were
represented by Thais, followed by Indians (7%), Chinese and
Korean (5.2% each), and French, Taiwanese, and others
(1.8% each). These respondents were aged between 15 and
18 years (Figure 1) and were currently enrolled in Grades 10
to 12 (Figure 2) at the time of the study. Up to 57.4% were
students enrolled in the General Business classes and 42.6%
were enrolled in the Economics classes. Figure 3 is a graphi-
cal illustration of the number of times students had changed
their partner in pair tests.
More than half of the students stuck to their old partners
in every pair test. There was an inverse relationship between

respondents who participated in the study. As the respondents were high
school students, the age group was between 15 and 18 years old. Over
half of the respondents were 16 years old (57%), whereas others were
either younger or older.

the number of times students changed their partners and the
number of students. That is, the greater the frequency of part-
ner changes, the lower the percentage of students who
changed partners.
Data Analysis
Students' thoughts on the administration of pair tests.Up to
87.5% of the respondents felt that it was a good idea for the
teacher to allow pair test testing, 3.6% did not think so, and
8.9% were uncertain about it. The majority of the students
amounting up to 80% enjoyed pair tests (strongly agree and
agree responses), 18.2% were neutral, and 1.8% disagreed.
More than half the respondents (58.9%) had pair tests for
the first time in the researcher's class, 28.6% had been previ-
ously exposed to it, and a small percentage (12.5%) was
uncertain. Although the findings indicated that more than
half of the students (57.1%) felt that pair tests should always
be administered, up to 39.3% felt that it should be adminis-
tered quarterly. Only 1.8% thought that it should be
administered yearly and the same percentage thought that
pair tests should not be administered at all.
Students' experiences with pair tests.The second research
question that focused on students'experiences with pair tests
was answered by 16 closed-ended questions and their
responses (Table 1) have been categorized into six main
groupings for easier analysis and understanding: (a) collabo-
ration and teamwork, (b) discussion, (c) learning, (d) motiva-
tion, (e) test partner, and (f) studying for tests. These reported
responses were based on "strongly agree" and "agree"
answers in terms of frequency and percent, with N = 55.
Students' opinions about pair tests. In an effort to allow stu-
dents to freely express themselves in their own words regard-
ing the positive and negative effects of pair tests, two
open-ended questions had been incorporated into the ques-
tionnaire to address RQ3. A total of 88 positive comments
and 46 negative comments were made, thus demonstrating
the greater inclination positive attitude toward pair tests.
Only four highest frequencies are reported for both positive
effects and negative effects. The four most frequent opinions
on positive effects presented in Table 2 indicated the four
issues ranked from the highest to the lowest responses (14 to
7) and they included (a) develop greater teamwork and coop-
eration, (b) discuss and analyze test questions and answers,
(c) helping each other, and (d) greater motivation to study
more/more hardworking. On the other hand, the ones for
negative effects as found in Table 3, are numerous, with the
four highest issues ranking from the most frequent first,
included (a) disagreement over the answer for a question, (b)
partner doesn't study for a test, (c) being lazy to study and
knowing you can depend on the other partner, and (d) bad
partners take advantage of good ones.
Discussion
The purpose of this study was to find out the effectiveness of
pair test administration. The findings of the study presented
a strong indication that pair tests were well accepted by high
school students who were studying business and economics
subjects. The large majority were in favor of the administra-
tion of pair tests as they enjoyed it, and even though approxi-
mately half of the students indicated that it should be
administered every time, the educator-researcher is in favor
with the second majority group of students who felt that it
should be administered quarterly. This is because she believes
that a greater weight should be assigned to individual testing
assessment and pair tests is just another collaborative activ-
ity that is a small but yet significant portion of a student's
total assessment.
Pair tests is an effective and successful alternative assess-
ment tool in engaging students as there were high levels of
student collaboration, teamwork, discussion, analysis, and
learning. Students also felt that having a good partner was an
important component of increased cooperation and learning
in pair tests. Although only two thirds of the respondents felt
more motivated to study harder, so that the team could do
better on the test, it was still a good representation of motiva-
tion. It was amazing to discover that up to almost 90% always
studied for the tests, and 80% felt that their partner always

studied for the test. It was interesting to note, however, that
even though pair tests did not always result in higher scores,
the majority of the students were still in favor of it.
The downsides of pair tests, as portrayed from the closed-
ended questions were the pressures of working with a part-
ner, accounting for one fifth of the students. These pressures
were probably from academically weaker students who
wanted to be paired with stronger students, or partnering
with someone they did not want to be but had to due to peer
pressure. The stress associated with working with partners
was at approximately 10%, which is relatively low, but nev-
ertheless existent. On a positive note regarding stress, a num-
ber of students had mentioned that pair tests had reduced the
stress and pressure they were facing. A very small percentage
of students reported being lazy to study for tests and being
dependent on their partner in studying for the tests, thus con-
firming the statement made by Sauer and Mertens (2013)
that "some students do diligently prepare for exams; some do
not" (p. 93). This created frustration for a few students who
had irresponsible and "bad" partners who were lazy and took
advantage of them. Although collaboration had produced
positive comments, some discussions had resulted in dis-
agreements over answers for a question. A few students also
complained about the longer time spent in discussion before
coming up with an answer.
It can be summarized from the findings that pair tests had
both positive and negative effects (Figure 4) with the posi-
tive outweighing the negative. The positive effects of pair
tests included increased collaboration, discussion, learning,
and motivation, while reducing stress. The negative effects

Conclusion and Recommendations
In conclusion, the researcher was pleased with the results
of the study as it has provided valuable insights into the
administration of pair tests. It was an excellent feedback
instrument for the researcher to find out if the years of
administration of collaborative tests in the form of pair
tests was in fact, a step that was well implemented. The
researcher was pleased to know for a fact that the brain-
storming and discussion that occurred had resulted in more
learning. She was also delighted to know that she could
play a small part in reducing students' stress and anxiety
levels through pair tests as students were overburdened
with other school-related responsibilities. Despite the pres-
ence of free riders, the percentage was minimal. Any dis-
agreements over answers and time-consuming discussions
were valuable experiences that would greatly benefit stu-
dents in times of needed collaboration in teams and man-
aging conflict.

While there are numerous advantages to pair tests, and the
dark side appears to blacken out the bright side, it is recom-
mended that pair tests be another test assessment tool avail-
able to educators, as the benefits outweigh the costs.
Educators who contemplate on experimenting pair tests in
their own classrooms can be creative in making any adjust-
ments necessary accordingly to their students' needs, learn-
ing styles, and subjects.
Limitations and Future Research
There were a couple of limitations to this study. The sample
size of 55 was relatively small and the study was limited to
only high school students in Grades 10 through 12 who were
taking business and economics classes. It is recommended
that further research in pair tests be conducted in an experi-
mental design study encompassing a larger sample size at
various subjects and levels in a school setting. As this study's
findings were largely dependent on the students' opinions, it
is recommended that any other sources of information, such
as teacher observation, peer reviews, and statistical testing be
used to indicate the effectiveness of pair tests. Further
research could also be based on classroom research with
achievement as a dependent variable apart from the ones that
had used in this study. Another limitation would be the bias
in responding to the questions, thus reducing the reliability
of the results.
