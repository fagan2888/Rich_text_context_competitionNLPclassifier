Background. Renal disease is commonly described as a complication of metabolic syndrome (MetS) but some recent studies suggest
that Chronic Kidney disease (CKD) may actually antecede MetS. Few studies have explored the predictive utility of co-clustering
CKD with MetS for cardiovascular disease (CVD) mortality. Methods. Data from a nationally representative sample of United States
adults (NHANES) was utilized. A sample of 13115 non-pregnant individuals aged  35 years, with available follow-up mortality
assessment was selected. Multivariable Cox Proportional hazard regression analysis techniques explored the relationship between
co-clustered CKD, MetS and CVD mortality. Bayesian analysis techniques tested the predictive accuracy for CVD Mortality of
two models using co-clustered MetS and CKD and MetS alone. Results. Co-clustering early and late CKD respectively resulted
in statistically significant higher hazard for CVD mortality (HR = 1.80, CI = 1.45­2.23, and HR = 3.23, CI = 2.56­3.70) when
compared with individuals with no MetS and no CKD. A model with early CKD and MetS has a higher predictive accuracy
(72.0% versus 67.6%), area under the ROC (0.74 versus 0.66), and Cohen's kappa (0.38 versus 0.21) than that with MetS alone.
Conclusion. The study findings suggest that the co-clustering of early CKD with MetS increases the accuracy of risk prediction for
CVD mortality.
1. Introduction
Cardiovascular disease (CVD) remains the leading cause of
death and disability in the United States, accounting for
approximately 1 of every 2.8 deaths recorded in the United
States [1]. The tendency for the major CVD risk factors
to occur in clusters informed considerable research interest
leading to the description of Metabolic Syndrome (MetS)
[2]. The National Cholesterol Education Program (NCEP)
Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III accepts the cooccurrence
of abdominal obesity, atherogenic dyslipidemia, elevated
blood pressure, insulin resistance with or without glucose
intolerance, prothrombotic states, and proinflammatory
states as MetS [3]. Although the precise pathophysiological
mechanism of MetS is unknown, there is ample evidence of
the association of this syndrome with CVD and CKD.
CKD is the ninth leading cause of death in the United
States with an estimated 19 million U.S. adults (6%) reported
to have some form of CKD [4]. The association of several
components of MetS with CKD [5­8] has engendered the
perception of CKD as a long-term complication of MetS.
However, the establishment of hyperinsulinemia and glu-
cose intolerance as the pathophysiological bases for insulin
resistance in patients with renal disease along with the
recent implication of the renin-angiotensin system in local
pancreatic islet structure and function suggests a plausible
common pathophysiological mechanism for MetS and CKD
[9, 10].
CKD is an established independent predictor of CVD
mortality and a long-term complication of several of the
individual components of MetS. However, the value of the
diagnosis of MetS as an independent predictor of CVD
mortality is controversial [2, 11]. A recent review of existing
prospective data concludes that the CVD risk associated with
the diagnosis of MetS varies with the components employed
in the diagnosis of the syndrome and that the diagnosis
of MetS itself only modestly predicts (Relative Risk 1.65­
1.93) CVD mortality [12, 13]. Many of the components
of MetS are also established CVD risk factors and the
clinical challenge has always been the establishment of
2 Journal of Nutrition and Metabolism
the additional risk posed by the diagnosis of MetS above
and beyond the sum of the CVD risk factors employed in its
diagnosis.
We hypothesize that the inclusion of indices of CKD in
the diagnostic criteria for MetS will refine its identity as
a clinical entity and improve its predictive value for CVD
mortality. The purpose of our study is to explore the effect of
including indices of CKD as defined by the National Kidney
Foundation Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative
(KDQI) study [14] in the diagnostic criteria for MetS on
the predictive value of the syndrome for CVD mortality in
a nationally representative sample.
2. Subjects and Methods
This study utilized data from a nationally representative
sample of the civilian, noninstitutionalized US population
collected by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention
during the third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Surveys (NHANES III) conducted at 89 survey locations
between January 1, 1988, and December 31, 1994. This
survey utilized a complex multistage cluster design and over-
sampled persons 60 years and older, non-Hispanic black
individuals, and Mexican American individuals to enhance
the precision of prevalence estimates in these groups. In-
person interviews were conducted in sampled households,
and all subjects were invited to participate in medical
examinations conducted at a nearby NHANES III mobile
examination center. Interviews consisted of demographic,
socioeconomic, dietary, as well as health-related questions,
and the mobile examination component consisted of medical
and dental examinations, physiological measurements, and
laboratory tests. The prevalence of common chronic condi-
tions and associated risk factors was also determined during
this survey. Details of the survey design and examination
procedures have been previously published [15, 16]. The
primary study outcome, CVD mortality was recorded from
the NHANES III mortality follow-up data. This mortality
follow-up data relied on a probabilistic match between
NHANES III and National Death Index (National Center
for Health Statistics (NCHS) 2006) death certificate records
available for a total of 18,149 participants of the total 30,818
(59%) adult participants (those 17 years and older) that
completed the initial interviews and physical examination
and laboratory assessment at a mobile examination center
[17]. Mortality assessments were conducted from the base-
line interview in 1988­1994 through the end of the follow-up
period in December 31, 2000. These mortality data included
cause specific mortality and mortality dates. Cause specific
mortality was coded using the International Classification
of Diseases Ninth Revision (ICD-9) Clinical Modification
for deaths occurring between 1988 and 1998 and the
International Classification of Diseases Tenth Revision for
deaths occurring between 1999 and 2000. We selected the
total sample of individuals with mortality assessment during
the follow-up period (n = 18, 149). Of these we excluded
participants who were pregnant and less than 35 years of age
to get a total sample size of 13115 for analysis.
3. Study Variables
3.1. Outcome Variable. CVD mortality was the primary
outcome variable of interest. Using the NHANESIII ICD-9
codes for deaths occurring between 1988 and 1998 and the
ICD-10 Tenth Revision for deaths occurring between 1999
and 2000 we created a dichotomous variable with categories
for CVD mortality and no-CVD mortality [17].
3.2. Primary Predictor Variable. The primary predictor vari-
able was cocustered MetS and CKD. To compute this variable
we first defined the individual metabolic risk factors or
conditions consistent with the National Cholesterol Educa-
tion Program (NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel III (ATP III)
classification among the sample [18]: specifically (a) Elevated
waist circumference: Men  40 inches (102 cm) and Women,
 35 inches (88 cm), (b) Elevated triglycerides: 150 mg/dL,
(c) Reduced HDL cholesterol: Men  40 mg/dL or Women
 50 mg/dL, (d) Elevated blood pressure: 130/85 mm Hg,
(e) Elevated fasting glucose: 110 mg/dL, (f) Prothrombotic
state: fibrinogen > 350 mg/dL, and (g) Proinflammatory
state: C-reactive proteins: > 0.5 mg/dL. Then we identified
study participants meeting a minimum of three of these
criteria and classified them as having MetS. We also created
a trichotomous CKD variable using the KDQI study clas-
sification for stages of CKD [19]. Individuals in stages 3­
5 (eGFR of 0­59 mL/min/1.73 m2) were classified as having
late CKD; individuals in the stages 1 and 2 (eGFR of 60­
89 mL/min/1.73 m2 or eGFR of >90 mL/min/1.73 m2 with
proteinuria) were classified as having early CKD. All other
individuals were classified as having normal kidney function.
Finally we created a dummy variable with six categories for
all the possible permutations of renal dysfunction and MetS
from the two variables described earlier. The categories were
as follows: (a) No MetS and No CKD, (b) No MetS and Early
CKD, (c) No MetS and Late CKD, (d) MetS and No CKD, (e)
MetS and Early CKD, and (f) MetS and Late CKD.
3.3. Covariates. Covariates included factors demonstrated
to be associated with CVD mortality and include socio-
demographic, smoking status, history of CVD, and mor-
tality follow-up duration. Specifically, demographic factors
included gender, age was categorized as <65 years and 65
years of age, gender, race, ethnicity, and poverty/income
ratio. Smoking status was categorized as never smoked,
former smokers and current smokers. Individuals with a self-
reported history of physician diagnosis of stroke, myocardial
infarction, and congestive heart failure were categorized as
having a history of CVD. The time from baseline assessment,
mortality assessment or death was included in the analysis to
control for any temporal influences of time on the outcome
of interest (CVD mortality).
4. Statistical Analysis
Descriptive analyses of all the variables utilized in the data
analysis were conducted. We explored the distribution of the
variables among categories of CVD and no CVD mortality.

Using the Cox proportional hazard model in multiple
survival analysis regression tests and controlling for the
influence of time to mortality assessment from baseline we
explored the Univariate relationship between the predictor
variables and CVD mortality (including both censored and
event categories). The time to event was considered the
time from the baseline laboratory measures and survey
measurement to the time of mortality assessment or death
of participants. A final multivariable survival analysis model
was then created using all the significant predictors of
CVD mortality in the univariate models to examine the
influence of MetS and CKD on CVD mortality. Tests were
conducted to rule out collinearity prior to running the final
multivariable regression analysis model including all the
covariates noted above. All data analyses were conducted
using SAS (version 8.0; SAS Institute Inc, Cary, NC) and
SPSS (version 15.0). Statistical hypotheses were tested using
P < .05 as the level of statistical significance. Finally we also
utilized the Bayesian analysis technique using the Waikato
Environment for Knowledge Analysis software (Weka 3.0) to
test the predictive accuracy of a model including a cocustered
MetS and early CKD variable when compared to a model
including separate MetS and early CKD measures while
adjusting for other predictors of CVD mortality identified in
the Univariate analysis.

Table 1. Among the sample about 53% were female and 40%
were aged 65 years or older. About 22% met at least 3 criteria
for MetS. About 9.5% of the sample had eGFR levels below
60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and 43.9% had eGFR between 60 and
89 mL/min/1.73 m2 or greater than 90 with some evidence of
proteinuria. The mean mortality follow-up period was about
97 months and CVD specific mortality among the sample
was about 11.8%.
5.2. Distribution of CVD Mortality. The distribution of CVD
specific mortality in the sample is presented in Table 2.
Higher mortality rates were observed in individuals who
were male (12.9%), aged greater than 65 years (25.3%), lived
below the 100% federal poverty line (15.1%), had a history of
CVD (33.0%), had eGFR below 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 (33.7%)
or had late stage renal disease without cooccurring MetS
(38.1%) closely followed by individuals with both late stage
renal disease with cooccurring MetS (31.0%).
5.3. Unadjusted Relationship: Cocustered CKD and MetS
versus CVD Mortality. Univariate analysis using Cox propor-
tional hazard analysis demonstrated that individuals aged
65 years or older, male, who had a history of CVD, were
white and lived below the 100% federal poverty income
line were more likely to had significantly greater hazard
of mortality (Table 3). Using the cocustered CKD and
MetS variables categories, the results demonstrated that in
increasing order, early CKD without MetS (HR = 3.02, CI
= 2.45­3.72), MetS and early CKD (HR = 4.14, CI = 3.36­
5.09), MetS and late CKD (HR = 12.81, CI = 10.27­16.00),
and finally late CKD without MetS (HR = 15.39, CI = 12.16­
19.48) all had a statistically significant higher mortality
hazard when compared to no MetS or CKD. Individuals
with MetS and no CKD did not demonstrate any statistically
significant difference in hazard for CVD mortality when
compared with individuals with no MetS or CKD.
5.4. Adjusted Relationship: Cocustered CKD and MetS versus
CVD Mortality. After adjusting for other potential predictors
of mortality a Cox proportional hazard model was developed
to explore the relationship between cocustered CKD and
MetS with CVD mortality. All measures reported previously
in the Univariate analysis model as being significantly
associated with CVD mortality remained the same (Table 3).
Using the cocustered CKD and MetS variables categories,
the results demonstrated that in the same increasing order
as observed in the Univariate analysis, early CKD without
MetS (HR = 1.69, CI = 1.37­2.10), MetS and early CKD
(HR = 1.80, CI = 1.45­2.23), MetS and late CKD (HR
= 3.23, CI = 2.56­3.70), and finally late CKD without
MetS (HR = 3.92, CI = 3.06­5.03) all had a statistically
significant higher mortality hazard when compared to no
MetS or CKD. Individuals with MetS and no CKD did
not demonstrate any statistically significant difference in
hazard for CVD mortality when compared with individuals
with no MetS or CKD. Figure 1 demonstrates the adjusted
relative hazard for CVD mortality among the categories of
cocustered CKD and MetS variable. Figure 2 presents a bar
chart displaying the adjusted relative hazard ratios for CVD
mortality among the categories of cocustered CKD and MetS
variable.
5.5. Predictive Accuracy of Models Cocustering Early CKD and
MetS versus MetS Alone for CVD Mortality. The results of
the Bayesian analysis as shown in Table 4 demonstrated that
for CVD mortality a model with cocustering of early CKD
and MetS demonstrated higher predictive accuracy (72.0%
versus 67.6%), area under the ROC (0.74 versus 0.66),
and Cohen's kappa (0.38 versus 0.21) than that with MetS
alone.

6. Discussion
The poor predictive value of the diagnosis of MetS for CVD
mortality has cast serious doubt on the existence of MetS
as a clinical entity distinct from its diagnostic components.
However, the clustering of metabolic abnormalities that led
to the description of the syndrome is still apparent in clinical
practice. This clustering of metabolic abnormalities more
often than would be predicted by chance alone was the
basis for the description of the syndrome and the suggestion
of a common etiology for its components. The initial
association of the syndrome with glucose intolerance and
hyperinsulinemia led to the suggestion of Insulin resistance
as the probable common pathophysiological basis for the
syndrome [20­22]. However, subsequent conflicting series
of studies led the National Cholesterol Education Program
(NCEP) Adult Treatment Panel (ATP) III to conclude that
the relationship between insulin resistance and MetS is not
well established [3].
The emerging role of vitamin D as a modulator of both
insulin resistance and the renin-angiotensin system [23]
and the recent implication of the renin-angiotensin system
in local pancreatic islet structure and function suggest a
broader base for a probable common etiology for MetS
than previously anticipated. The traditional association of
CKD with several components of MetS may have led to
the exclusion of CKD as a component of MetS and misled
the search effort for a common pathophysiological basis for
the components of the syndrome. It is in the light of this
emerging body of evidence that we evaluate the effect of
including early CKD in the diagnostic criteria for MetS on
its predictive value for CVD mortality using a nationally
representative sample.
The preponderance of participants with early CKD in
the analysis sample makes it suitable for the isolation of
the influence of early CKD on the predictive value of MetS
for CVD mortality. The association of CKD with CVD
mortality in this study is consistent with the existing body
of evidence and highlights the significance of CKD as an
independent risk factor for CVD mortality. Even in the early
stages CKD carries a significant risk for CVD mortality
(OR 1.69; CI 1.37­2.10) (Table 3). In the absence of early
CKD, MetS carries no significant risk for mortality in this
study. However, early CKD becomes more hazardous with
a hazard ratio of 1.8 versus 1.69 for CVD mortality in the
presence of MetS (Figure 2). The greater hazard of early
CKD in the presence of MetS is associated with a slight but
similar reduction in survival among the affected participants
(Figure 1). The apparent lack of a significant association
between MetS and CVD mortality is consistent with the
results of several previous studies but the increase in the
hazard ratio for CVD mortality associated with early CKD
in the presence of MetS gives credence to a potential renal
contribution to the pathogenesis and perhaps mortality of
MetS.
The primary purpose of this study was to explore
the implication of including indices of early CKD in the
diagnostic criteria of MetS for the predictive value of the
syndrome for CVD mortality. The results of this study
suggest a broader base for a common etiology for MetS and
support the finding of a potential renal contribution to the
etiology of the syndrome. The results of this study represent
an analysis of a nationally representative sample of 13,115
participants with a mean mortality follow-up period of about
97 months and CVD specific mortality of 11.8%.
However, the mortality follow-up data employed in this
study relied on a probabilistic match between NHANES
III and National Death Index (National Center for Health
Statistics (NCHS) 2006) death certificate records available
and inaccurate matches for CVD specific mortality may
potentially confound the study findings, particularly since
a few studies suggest that appropriately identifying CVD-
specific mortality may inadvertently result in misclassifica-
tion of cause specific mortality [24]. Also given the cross
sectional nature of risk measures utilized in our study the
impact of other confounding events post assessment may
impact our finding and influence the attribution of CVD
mortality to our study risk measures.
Overall the study findings that early CKD may cocuster
with MetS to result in an increased mortality burden should
inform more studies to explore the temporal relationship
between the pathogenesis of CKD and MetS.
