Abstract: It is well established that men are more likely than women to engage in direct
competition, but it is unclear if this reflects social structural conditions or evolved
predispositions. These hypotheses can be addressed by quantifying competitiveness in
sports and testing if the sex difference is decreasing over time in the U.S., a society where
social roles have converged. Study 1 assessed participation and the occurrence of relatively
fast performances by masters runners (40­74 years old) at recent road races and track
meets. Fast performances occurred over 20 times more often at track meets than at road
races. Women comprised 55% of finishers at roads races but only 15­28% of finishers at
track meets. Thus, the sex difference in masters track participation can serve as a measure
of the sex difference in competitiveness. Study 2 used data from national championship
meets and yearly rankings lists to test whether the sex difference in masters track
participation decreased from 1988­2012. The sex difference decreased overall, but there
was no evidence of change since the late 1990s. Therefore, the sex difference in the
willingness to engage in direct sports competition appears to reflect both social structural
conditions and evolved predispositions.

Introduction
The origins of sex differences in human preferences and motivations remain
unresolved. On the one hand, social structural theory claims that sex differences arise from
the different roles men and women occupy in their current societies. It thus predicts sex
differences will weaken and eventually disappear as women's power increases and social
roles converge (Eagly and Wood, 1999; Wood and Eagly, 2002, 2012). On the other hand,

evolutionary theory holds that sex differences partly reflect innate predispositions that were
shaped by the differing challenges that typically faced men and women during human
evolutionary history. This theory predicts that, although sex differences may vary as a
function of social roles and other factors, some differences will remain robust across all
societies (Archer, 2009; Gangestad, Haselton, and Buss, 2006; Lippa, 2009, 2010; Schmitt,
2012).
Researchers have addressed these predictions by making comparisons across
nations or within the same society across time periods. Several studies have supported
predictions of social structural theory (e.g., Eagly and Wood, 1999; Twenge, 1997b, 2001;
Zentner and Mitura, 2012). Nevertheless, other studies indicate that some predicted
associations are not robust (e.g., Buss, 1989; Gangestad et al., 2006; Lueptow, Garovich-
Szabo, and Lueptow, 2001; Schmitt, 2012). Moreover, studies guided by evolutionary
theory have generated and found support for predictions regarding sex differences that do
not follow from social structural theory (e.g., Buss, 1989; Gangestad et al., 2006; Lippa,
2009, 2010; Schmitt, Realo, Voracek, and Allik, 2008; Schmitt, 2005). For instance,
Gangestad and colleagues (2006) showed that, across nations, pathogen prevalence predicts
sex differences in the preference for a mate's intelligence.
A major limitation of nearly all of these studies is their reliance on self-reports,
which makes interpretation difficult (Lueptow et al., 2001; Schmitt et al., 2008; Wood and
Eagly, 2012). It therefore may be fruitful to consider sex differences in behaviorally
expressed preferences and motivations. In this spirit, Deaner (2006a, 2013) suggested that
the sex difference in competitiveness might be assessed in sports, especially distance
running.
Competitiveness, especially the willingness to engage in direct competition
(hereafter "competitiveness"), is an appropriate focus because it apparently constitutes a
core component of sex differences (e.g., Archer, 2009; Campbell, 2002; Ellis, 2011; Geary,
2010). In fact, the sex difference in competitiveness is thought to be important for
understanding crime, mortality patterns, labor markets, and the arts and sciences (Archer,
2009; Croson and Gneezy, 2009; Kanazawa, 2003; Miller, 2000; Niederle and Vesterlund,
2011; Wilson and Daly, 1985). Evidence for a sex difference in competitiveness has
emerged in many contexts: In laboratory games, men are more likely than women to
choose competitive rather than non-competitive compensation schemes (Croson and
Gneezy, 2009; Niederle and Vesterlund, 2011); on surveys, men report greater enjoyment
of competition in general (Houston, Harris, Moore, Brummett, and Kametani, 2005; Piko,
Skulteti, Luszczynska, and Gibbons, 2010), greater desire to win in interpersonal situations
(Gill, 1988; Spence and Helmreich, 1983), and greater desire to strive for success relative
to others in sports (Gill, 1988; Merten, 2008); in their free time, boys and men play video
games more often than girls and women, particularly competitive games, and males are
more likely to report that competition motivates them to play (Hartmann and Klimmt,
2006; Lucas and Sherry, 2004); and, finally, boys and men participate in sports
substantially more often than girls and women, although there is no consistent difference
for (non-competitive) exercise (Deaner et al., 2012; Lunn, 2010; Stamatakis and
Chaudhury, 2008).
Distance running is an excellent area for assessing competitiveness because the
motivation to run varies substantially among participants. Whereas some runners are
primarily motivated by competition, most run for a variety of other reasons, such as
A stable sex difference in competitiveness

affiliation, health, and life meaning (Masters, Ogles, and Jolton, 1993; Ogles and Masters,
2003). Distance running is also advantageous because, unlike most other sports, it is
generally accessible, acceptable, and popular for both men and women (Deaner, 2013).
Deaner (2006a, 2013) suggested that a sex difference in competitiveness in distance
running could be assessed across contexts and time periods by quantifying the frequency of
male and female runners that run fast relative to sex-specific world class standards. For
example, in a typical 5 kilometer road race held in the U.S., for every woman that finishes
within 125% of the female world record, there are roughly three men that finish within
125% of the male world record (Deaner and Mitchell, 2011; Deaner, 2006b). This approach
is based on the assumption that relative performance predicts training volumes and
competitiveness similarly in men and women, an assumption with empirical support
(Deaner, Masters, Ogles, and LaCaille, 2011; Deaner, 2013).
Deaner (2006a, 2006b, 2013) and colleagues (Deaner and Mitchell, 2011) showed
that, although the number of women that participate in distance running in the U.S. has
grown greatly since the 1980s so that there is no longer a consistent sex difference in
participation, there are still roughly three times as many men that run fast relative to sex-
specific world class standards. This pattern holds robustly for elite runners and non-elite
(i.e., recreational) runners, and tests reveal no indication that the sex difference in the
number of relatively fast performers has diminished over the past few decades.
This temporal stability in relative performance challenges social structural theory
because social roles have converged substantially in the U.S. over this time. This is true in
education, politics, and the labor force (Koenig, Eagly, Mitchell, and Ristikari, 2011;
Lueptow et al., 2001; National Coalition for Women and Girls in Education [NCWGE],
2012; Twenge, 1997a; Twenge, Campbell, and Gentile, 2012). In addition, there is
consensus that great progress has been made in increasing females' competitive athletic
opportunities (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist, 2007; NCWGE, 2012).
Nevertheless, because relative running performance is an indirect indicator of
competitiveness, alternative interpretations for these results remain plausible (Deaner,
2013).
Here, we more directly address the putative sex difference in competitiveness in
distance running and the possibility of historical change. In Study 1, we demonstrate that,
although participation in road races is not a valid indicator of competitiveness, participation
at masters track meets generally is. In particular, we show that most finishers at masters
track meets perform at a high level and that, unlike at road races, there is a pronounced sex
difference in participation. In Study 2, we examine patterns of masters track participation
from 1988­2012 and test whether the sex difference has diminished.
Our studies are notable in focusing on masters runners, who are generally defined as
being at least 40 years of age. We focused on these older runners rather than adolescents
and young adults participating on high school and intercollegiate teams because, in the
U.S., participation in these contexts is often motivated or modulated by extrinsic factors
(Bowen and Shulman, 2001). In particular, some high school athletes participate to increase
their prospects of being admitted to college or of receiving financial aid, and some
collegiate athletes may participate to maintain financial aid (Bowen and Shulman, 2001). In
addition, at institutions offering intercollegiate sports, the assortment of sports teams that
are sponsored and the number of athletes that are allowed on each team are strongly
affected by financial considerations, institutional gender-equity participation goals, and

roster size limitations set by external governing bodies (Brake, 2010; Gavora, 2001;
Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist, 2007; Rhoads, 2004). Thus, some believe that the sex
difference in organized school sports participation substantially underestimates the sex
difference in the desire to participate (Gavora, 2001; Rhoads, 2004). Recent studies support
this suggestion, showing that the sex difference in organized school sports participation is
far smaller than the sex difference in participation in unrestricted contexts (Deaner et al.,
2012).
For masters runners, by contrast, there are apparently no major incentives for
excelling (e.g., scholarships, prizes) or external constraints on participation (Cardenas,
Henderson, and Wilson, 2009; Dionigi and O'Flynn, 2007). Thus, a masters runner
achieving an excellent performance and/or choosing to compete in a context where such
performances occur frequently should indicate genuine competitiveness. Furthermore,
using cross-temporal data from masters runners provides an especially powerful test of
social structural theory (Study 2). This is because childhood and adolescent sport
experience is thought to shape adult sports interest (Fredricks and Eccles, 2005; Scheerder
et al., 2006), and the youth athletic experience and available role models for female masters
runners has increased substantially over time. Therefore, if social structural theory is
correct, then the analyses in Study 2 will reveal that the sex difference in masters track
participation has decreased.
Study 1
Road races--from 5 kilometers ("5K") to the marathon (42.195 km)--have grown
tremendously in popularity in the last few decades (Latter, 2012; Running USA, 2012b). In
the United States, this growth has been especially strong among women, who comprised
less than 25% of finishers in the late 1980s but comprised roughly 55% in 2011 (Deaner
and Mitchell, 2011; Running USA, 2012b). Another notable aspect of this "second running
boom" has been its non-competitive emphasis, at least in the U.S. There is much evidence
for this: Although outstanding performers are often awarded medals or prizes, almost all
road races distribute memorial clothing to all registrants, and longer races typically award
medals to all finishers (Bingham, 2002; Burfoot, 2005; Latter, 2012); many individuals
consider finishing a marathon, no matter the time, to be a significant life achievement
(Bingham, 2002; Burfoot, 2005); most races aim to attract large fields to support charities
or earn profits, whereas few focus on optimizing racing conditions (Latter, 2012; Magill,
2012; Robbins, 2010); for both men and women, median marathon times have slowed by
more than 15% since the early 1980s (Running USA, 2012a); and relatively few road race
participants report that they are strongly motivated by competition (Masters et al., 1993;
Ogles and Masters, 2003).
Distance runners can also participate in track meets, but there is no indication of
increased participation in this context (Gerweck, 2012). This is apparently related to the
continued emphasis on competition: Although many track meets award medals to winners
or near winners, almost none award them merely for finishing, and many track meets that
allow participation by older adults focus on formal competition between clubs or allowing
individuals to pursue qualifying performances for more prestigious meets.
The difference between road races and track meets is encapsulated in remarks by
Tom Derderian, coach of the Greater Boston Track Club:
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -852-
There's no running boom in track... There's nowhere to hide on a track...There's a
philosophy that's become prevalent in road racing that as long as you finish, you're
a winner. There's none of that in track. Track races are a very precise means of
determining who's a winner, and how far behind everyone else is. There's no warm,
fuzzy way to spin that. You're out there naked to the watch, and not too many
people want to do that, have the balls to do that. (Gerweck, 2012, para. 5)
These considerations suggest the hypothesis that participation in track meets, but
not road races, indicates competitiveness. This hypothesis can be assessed by testing the
prediction that a far larger percentage of masters individuals run fast at track meets than at
road races. The basis of this prediction is that fast performances reliably correlate with self-
reported competitiveness (e.g., "to compete with others") and greater running volumes
(Masters et al., 1993; Ogles and Masters, 2000, 2003; Ogles, Masters, and Richardson,
1995). Moreover, these relationships are similar in men and women (Deaner et al., 2011).
In contrast to competitiveness, other running motives (e.g., health orientation) do not
correlate with performance and training volume or, in the case of personal goal
achievement (e.g., "to compete with myself"), do so only weakly (Masters et al., 1993;
Ogles and Masters, 2000).
We test this key prediction by quantifying the percentage of masters finishers at
track meets and road races that achieve fast performances relative to sex-specific, age-
specific world class standards. We further assess the validity of masters track meet
participation as an indicator of competitiveness by testing the prediction that masters men
are substantially more likely than masters women to participate at track meets, but not at
road races. As noted above, previous studies have shown that more men than women run
relatively fast in road races, and that this seems explicable, at least in part, to more men
maintaining high training volumes, a correlate of competitiveness (Deaner, 2013).
Moreover, more male than female runners report that competition motivates them to run
(Callen, 1983; Johnsgard, 1985; Ogles and Masters, 2003).
Materials and Methods
Track: State games
To obtain a representative sample of large track meets for masters runners, we
focused on the State Senior Games (hereafter "State Games") that are held in each of the 50
U.S. states and the District of Columbia; top performances allow individuals to qualify for
the National Senior Games (www.nsga.com). The State Games generally include a wide
variety of sports (e.g., archery, badminton, basketball, etc.), and the track and field meets
feature several race distances. The State Games are open to individuals who are at least 50
years of age, and most states only allow participation by their residents. Our sample
comprised the first 25 states in alphabetical order that posted track and field results online
for the year 2012. We originally planned to use data from all states with available data.
However, we elected to stop at 25 states because data collection was tedious and our initial
analyses indicated that our sample was already fairly large and that the predicted effects
were large.
We took data from the 800 m and 1500 m races, the longest track events held in
most states. We focused on three representative age groups: 50­54, 60­64, and 70­74
years. For each age group and race, we recorded the number of male and female finishers.
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -853-
We also recorded the number who met or exceeded (i.e., ran faster than) 125% or 150% of
the sex-specific, age-specific world record (www.mastersathletics.net). For example, for
the 50­54 age group, the female world record for 1500 m is 4:48.5, meaning that the 125%
standard is 6:00.6 or faster and the 150% standard is 7:12.6 or faster.
Track: All masters
A possible concern about the State Games sample is that it may be
unrepresentatively competitive because it carries the prestige of being a state championship
and national qualifier. Therefore, we developed a second sample based on a list of masters
track meets occurring in the United States (www.mastersrankings.com). This list is
maintained by USA Track and Field (USATF) and is meant to be comprehensive. It
includes relatively large, prestigious masters meets, smaller masters meets, and masters
performances occurring at open (all ages) meets that are primarily oriented towards
younger athletes. For convenience, we examined all 177 meets listed for May 2011 and all
302 meets listed for June 2012. These months were selected because they are months when
outdoor track meets frequently occur throughout the U.S. We chose different months in
each year to ensure that meets would not be duplicated. No State Games meets were
included in this sample.
For this sample (hereafter "All Masters"), we included data for the 800 m, 1500 m,
and 5000 m track races. We included the same age groups as we did with the State Games;
however, because data were available, we added the 40­44 age group. For these age groups
and events, there was at least one performance at 138 of the 479 meets; the other meets
indicated at least one performance for other events and/or age groups. We again recorded
the number of participants and the number who achieved 125% and 150% standards.
Road races
We compiled our road race sample from two sources. First, Deaner (2006b)
identified and analyzed 20 of the largest 5Ks in the U.S. occurring in 2003. We sought
2012 data for these races; however, because many of these races no longer occur, data were
only available for 10 of them. Second, we added 10 5K races from a website that attempts
to maintain a comprehensive list of all road races in the U.S. (www.runningintheusa.com).
We used the advanced search tool and considered races that had "5K" in the title but did
not include the words "walk," "trail," "women," or "girls." To be included, races must have
presented complete finishers' data for five-year age grouping and must have had at least
200 total finishers of all ages. We included the first 10 races meeting these criteria that
occurred after May 31, 2012. We included data from the 40­44, 50­54, 60­64, and 70­74
age groups and again recorded the number of finishers and the number of them who
achieved the 125% and 150% standards.
Results
Participation
As expected, masters track meets had substantially lower rates of participation than
5K road races (see Table 1). In particular, at the 25 State Games meets, there were 471
finishers (M = 18.8 finishers per meet; SD = 8.5); at the 138 All Masters meets, there were
714 finishers (M = 5.1; SD = 6.0); at the 20 5K road races, there were 12,645 finishers (M =

632.3; SD = 730.0).

Fast performances
As predicted, compared to road races, a far higher percentage of finishers at track
meets ran fast relative to the appropriate sex-specific, age-specific world records (see
Figure 1 and Table 2). For 5K road races, 1% reached the 125% standard, whereas 19% did
this at the State Games meets, and 33% did this at the All Masters meets, 2(2, n = 13,829)
= 2564.04, p < .0001. For the 150% standard, the percentages were, respectively, 7%, 65%
and 77%, 2(2, n = 13,829) = 4314.22, p < .0001. To illustrate the magnitude of this
difference, we combined the data from the two track meet samples and calculated the odds
of running fast at a track meet compared to the odds of running fast at a road race. This
revealed that a runner at a track meet was 36 times more likely to achieve either standard
than a runner at a road race was (odds ratio: 36.4 for 125% standard; 35.7 for 150%
standard).1
1 Technically speaking, the odds ratio indicates that the odds (not the probability) of achieving the standard is
multiplied by a factor of 36 for a runner at a track meet compared to a runner at a road race. We use the
language "more likely" for ease of interpretation.

A potential concern is that achieving the 125% and 150% standards might be easier
at track meets than at 5K road races. This is because most track performances were 800 m
or 1500 m rather than 5000 m, and achieving relative performance standards becomes
increasingly infrequent and presumably more difficult with longer distances (Deaner,
2006a; Deaner and Mitchell, 2011). Based on equations used in an earlier study (Deaner,
2006a), achieving 150% of an 800 m standard can be estimated as being roughly equivalent
to achieving 156% of a 5000 m standard. Although this means that the differences noted
above are overstated, the difference would remain very large even if we used formal
corrections. This is revealed by the fact that the percentage of finishers reaching the 125%
standard at track meets was more than twice as great as the percentage reaching the (much
slower) 150% standard at road races. Furthermore, among the 120 finishers of 5000 m
races at All Masters track meets (i.e., same distance as 5K road races), 38% reached the
125% standard and 83% reached the 150% standard. Finally, we also gathered data on road
race finishers reaching the 160% standard; only 11% did so, meaning that a runner at a
track meet was 20.9 times more likely to reach the 150% standard than was a runner in a
road race to reach the 160% standard. Thus, we can be confident that runners at track meets
are indeed far more likely to run fast than runners at road races.
Another important result is that the difference between road races and track meets
occurred for both men and women (see Tables 1 and 2). Men's odds ratios for achieving
125% and 150% standards at a track meet (combined samples) compared to a road race
were 26.4 and 28.8. For women, these values were 42.2 and 35.1. Similarly, the difference
between road races and track meets occurred within all age groups. The odds ratios were
80.1 (125%) and 67.2 (150%) for the 40­44 age group; 41.3 and 33.2 for the 50­54 age
group; 16.1 and 20.3 for the 60­64 age group; and 3.7 and 8.0 for the 70­74 age group.
Sex differences
We next considered the prediction that men would participate more than women at
track meets but not at road races. As predicted, women comprised 52% of finishers at 5K
road races but only 28% of finishers at State Games meets and 15% of finishers at the All
Masters meets, 2(2, n = 13,829) = 457.6, p < .0001. This pattern held across age groups:
In the 40­44 age group, women comprised 55% of finishers at road races and 17% at All
Masters meets (p < .0001); in the 50­54 age group, women comprised 51% of finishers at
road races, 34% at State Games meets and 18% at All Masters meets (p < .0001); in the
60­64 age group, women comprised 45%, 27%, and 13% of the respective samples (p <
.0001); and in the 70­74 age group, women comprised 35%, 22%, and 8% of the samples
(p < .0001).
Finally, we examined whether--among road race finishers--men were more likely
than women to run relatively fast, as reported in previous studies with runners less than 40
years old (Deaner, 2006b; Deaner and Mitchell, 2011). Masters men were 3.1 times as
likely as masters women to reach the 125% standard (p < .0001) and 2.3 times as likely to
reach the 150% standard (p < .0001; see Figure 1).
Discussion
This study had two main findings. First, participants at masters track meets in the
U.S. were at least 20 times more likely to run fast than masters participants at road races

were. Second, women comprised 52% of masters finishers at 5K road races but only 15­
28% of masters finishers at track meets. Both of these results are novel yet consistent with
previous work. In particular, earlier reports indicated slightly greater female than male
participation in contemporary U.S. 5K road races (Deaner and Mitchell, 2011; Running
USA, 2012b) and that the percentage of runners that run relatively fast at U.S. road races,
although quite low, is higher in men than women (Deaner, 2006b; Deaner and Mitchell,
2011).
One concern about this study is that road races were 5K (5000 m) whereas most of
the track meet races were of shorter distances (i.e., 800 m or 1500 m). Because achieving
the 125% and 150% standards might be easier at shorter distances (Deaner, 2006a; Deaner
and Mitchell, 2011), this will overestimate the difference in fast performances between
these contexts. However, we showed that the difference between these contexts remained
very large even when making conservative comparisons, including direct comparisons of
5000 m track performances and 5K (5000 m) road race performances.
Because fast performances reliably correlate with self-reported competitiveness and
the maintenance of larger training volumes (Masters et al., 1993; Ogles et al., 1995; Ogles
and Masters, 2000, 2003), these new results support the hypothesis that masters track
participation is a valid measure of competitiveness and that, at the population level, the sex
difference in master track participation is a reasonable indicator of the sex difference in
competitiveness. Of course, this is a population level result and does not signify anything
about specific individuals; many road race participants may very well be highly
competitive and many track meet participants may not be.
Study 2
In Study 2, we test social structural theory's prediction that, in the U.S., the sex
difference in competitiveness has decreased as social roles have converged in the past few
decades (Koenig et al., 2011; Lueptow et al., 2001; NCWGE, 2012; Twenge et al., 2012).
We do this by using the sex difference in masters track participation as a proxy for the sex
difference in competitiveness, an approach strongly supported by Study 1. We next discuss
our measures of masters track participation and social roles.
Masters track participation
Neither sampling method used in Study 1 to assess masters track participation was
viable for temporal comparisons. However, we identified a workable analog for each. First,
the State Games appear to be a fairly recent occurrence, and we were unable to locate
historical data. Fortunately, USA Track and Field (USATF) has annually held a national
masters championship meet, and data are publicly available going back several decades.
Second, amassing data on participation at hundreds of individual masters track meets
across years, similar to the "All Masters" sample in Study 1, would be very difficult
because many meets do not persist from year to year. Fortunately, USATF maintains yearly
rankings lists, which aggregate all reported performances in a given calendar year by sex,
age group, and event. These lists document the best performance for any individual known
to have competed at least once, and they are publicly available beginning in 1988.

Social roles
Our primary proxy for convergence in social roles in the U.S. is year--an approach
used by many studies (reviewed in Wood and Eagly, 2012). This approach is appropriate
because year correlates positively with many measures of social role convergence (see
Figure 2; Twenge et al., 2012). However, we also explored the predictive capacity of more
direct measures. First, because the division of labor is thought to play a fundamental role in
production of sex-differentiated behavior (Wood and Eagly, 2012), we used the percentage
of U.S. civilian women in the paid labor force (see Figure 2; Twenge et al., 2012). A
limitation of this measure is that working women remain over-represented in female-typical
(communal) occupations and less likely than men to attain high status positions (Kan,
Sullivan, and Gershuny, 2011; Queneau, 2006; Wood and Eagly, 2012). Therefore, as a
second measure of the division of labor, we used the wage gap between male and female
workers (see Figure 2). For instance, the wage gap indicates that in 2011, on average, a
full-time, year-round working woman earned 82% as much as her male counterpart (U.S.
Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013). This gap is believed to partly reflect discrimination,
although it also reflects men working more hours and holding different jobs (Blau and
Kahn, 2007; Mulligan and Rubinstein, 2008). The wage gap should thus provide a
reasonable proxy for working women's employment converging with men's.

Note. Labor Force Participation indicates the percentage of civilian
women aged 16 years or older in the U.S. paid labor force. Wage Gap
indicates, for full-time U.S. workers, women's earnings as a
percentage of men's. High School Sports Participants indicates the
percentage of sports participants in U.S. high schools that are women.
Olympic Participation indicates the percentage of participants in the
Summer Olympic Games that are women.
In addition, because the influence of social roles might be partly domain-specific
(Koenig et al., 2011), we used two measures of convergence in sport participation. The first

was the percentage of participants that are female in U.S. high school sports (see Figure 2).
This represents a local, readily observable level of sport participation, with high rates of
participation even among individuals of modest athletic ability (Stevenson, 2007). Females'
participation in high schools sports increased dramatically in the wake of Title IX, an
education reform that bars sex discrimination in access to athletic opportunities in
federally-funded educational institutions (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist,
2007; Stevenson, 2007). The second measure was the percentage of participants that are
female in the Summer Olympic Games (see Figure 2). The Summer Olympic Games
provides the world's greatest variety of elite sports competition (Lowen, Deaner, and
Schmitt, 2014), and the percentage female participation should proxy elite athletic
opportunities for girls and women. We also note that the Olympics could have direct effects
on perceptions of the appropriateness of female sports. This is because the Olympics are
one of the few elite sporting contexts where female athletes receive media coverage that is
reasonably similar to that of men (Billings, Angelini, and Duke, 2010), and this coverage is
extensive. The 2012 Olympics, for instance, generated over 100,000 hours of coverage
spread over more than 500 television channels across the globe, and these broadcasts
reached an estimated 3.6 billion viewers (International Olympic Committee, 2013). The
U.S. has had much success in the Olympics, although for both men and women, U.S.
participation and success in winning medals is unremarkable after controlling for country
level characteristics, such as population, gross domestic product, and gender inequality
(Lowen et al., 2014).
Lagging social role measures
One limitation of these measures of social role convergence is that adult
dispositions are thought to be largely shaped during childhood or adolescence (e.g.,
Twenge, 1997b, 2001). Thus, the increasing occurrence of women in male-typical (agentic
or instrumental) roles in the late 1980s, for example, might be irrelevant to the
competiveness of women who were 40 years old at that time. However, these changes
could have impacted girls entering high school in the late 1980s; these individuals would be
eligible to participate in masters track meets in the early 2010s. To address this issue, we
repeated our analyses after lagging social role measures. We did this by taking the year of
competition and subtracting the midpoint of the relevant age group and then adding 14
years to approximate early adolescence. For example, for runners in the 40­44 age group
competing in 2012 (born in roughly 1970), we used social role measures from 1984. We
also repeated these analyses after adding 8 rather than 14 years, as this would approximate
mid-childhood. Unfortunately, we often lacked sufficient data to test the importance of the
wage gap and high school sports participation when individuals in an age group cohort
would have been in early adolescence and mid-childhood (see Figure 2).
Our primary analyses, which used year as a proxy for social role convergence, did
not require lagging years to approximate early adolescence or mid-childhood. This is
because year, by definition, increases uniformly for all age groups at all times.
Materials and Methods
Paralleling Study 1, we obtained data on the 800 m, 1500 m, and 5000 m race
distances. We used the four age groups from Study 1, although to increase statistical power,
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -860-
we also included the three intermediate age groups, i.e., 45­49, 55­59, and 65­69 years.
Thus, there were 21 events per year.
USA Championships
We obtained data on the USATF's annual masters national championship meet
(hereafter USA Championships) from the organization's links, especially
www.mastershistory.org/history/resultsusa.html. We obtained data on all years from 1988­
2012, save that data were available for only 5 of 21 events in 1990 and no data were
available for 1991. USATF allows non-Americans to participate in the championship meet,
but for some meets, especially in the 1990s and earlier, participants' citizenship was not
indicated. To allow fair comparisons across years, we therefore based most analyses on all
participants. However, we repeated some analyses using only U.S. citizens; for this we
used data from 1998, 1999, and 2001­2012. For these 14 years, 94% of men and 92% of
women were U.S. citizens. We counted an individual as participating if they were listed as
registered for the event in any capacity, even if they did not start, did not finish, or were
disqualified. In a random sample of 40 events occurring from 1998­2012, 93% of male and
92% of female participants legally finished their races.
Rankings
We obtained USATF yearly outdoor rankings for 1988­2012 from
www.mastersrankings.com. Unfortunately, no data were available for 2002. In addition,
from 2003­2006, the lists were restricted to the fastest 25 performers. In 12 out of 84
events (mostly for older age groups), both men and women had 25 or fewer ranked
performers, potentially allowing a sex difference to be computed; nonetheless, we did not
include this data because such events might be unrepresentative of the typical sex
difference in that event. Therefore, there were no rankings data included from 2002­2006.
Social role convergence
We obtained data on the percentage of U.S. civilian women over the age of 16
participating in the workforce from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (Bureau of Labor
Statistics Data, 2014); we obtained data prior to 1948 from the Statistical Abstracts of the
United States (United States Census Bureau, n.d.). We obtained data on the percentage
wage gap between male and female full-time workers from the U.S. Bureau of Labor
Statistics (Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2013). We obtained data on high school sports
participation from the National Federation of State High School Associations (National
Federation of State High School Associations, 2013). We obtained data on Summer
Olympic Participation from Wikipedia ("Summer Olympic Games," 2014), which compiles
information from the International Olympic Committee as well as sports scholars with
more accurate information. The Olympics occur once every four years; to maintain an
adequate sample size, we assumed the Olympic participation value would remain fixed for
the following three years.
Analysis
We used the R programming language to conduct statistical analyses. In all models,
the dependent variable was female representation, measured as a percentage of total
participants. We used multiple regression models with year or a social role convergence
A stable sex difference in competitiveness

measure as the explanatory variable of primary interest in order to investigate potential
time trends. We also controlled for age group and race distance. Moreover, since the
number of runners varied substantially by race distance and especially by age group, our
models were weighted by the total number of men and women in a given event. All
statistical tests were two tailed and, owing to the substantial number of tests, we used a 1%
significance level ( = 0.01). The choice of  did not qualitatively affect our conclusions,
and exact p-values are reported for all tests in the text or tables.
Results
We first examined the sex difference in participation across all events, age-groups
and years. For the USA Championships, there were 7,127 participants, and 27% were
women. The sex difference was smallest in the 40­44 age group, where women comprised
32% of participants; the sex difference was largest in the oldest three age groups, where
women comprised 22% (see Table 3). For the yearly rankings, there were 32,696 ranked
individuals (hereafter "participants"), 22% of which were women. The percentage of
female participants ranged from 20­23% across age groups (see Table 3).

USA Championships
We next examined whether the sex difference in participation decreased over time,
beginning with the USA championship meet. The multiple regression revealed that
percentage female participation was significantly predicted by year and also by age group,
but not by race distance (R2 = .15; year
= 0.32, p < .0001; Age: F[6,488] = 10.37, p <
.0001; Distance: F[2,488] = 0.23, p = .79). We thus conducted regressions separately for
each age group and found a significant increase in percentage female participation for the
40­44 (0.71% increase per year) and 50­54 (0.73% increase per year) age groups. Table 4
provides slopes and p-values for all seven age groups.

Note. Values represent slopes, in units of % increase per year, with p-values in parentheses.
Visual inspection of the scatter plots (see Figure 3) suggested, however, that these
increases occurred mainly in the first 10 years of the study, from 1988­1997. We therefore
repeated these analyses using data from only the last 15 years of the study, from 1998­
2012. In the overall model, year was positively associated with percentage female
participation, although it no longer reached significance (R2 = .15; year
= .15, p = .28; Age:
F[6,488] = 10.37, p < .0001; Distance: F[2,488] = 0.23, p = .79). Within age groups (see
Table 4), there was a significant increase in female participation in the 55­59 age group
(0.86% per year) but a significant decrease in the 65­69 age group (-1.09% per year). We
also repeated these analyses using only U.S. citizens and found nearly identical results (see
Table 4). Finally, we repeated these analyses using data from only the last 10 years of the
study, from 2003­2012. In the overall model, year was negatively associated with
percentage female participation, although this did not reach significance (R2 = .15; year
=
-0.17, p = .48; Age: F[6,488] = 10.37, p < .0001; Distance: F[2,488] = 0.23, p = .79). There
were two significant changes within age groups: decreases in the 65­69 (-1.56% per year)
and 70­74 (-2.13% per year) age groups (see Table 4).
Yearly rankings
We performed similar analyses with the yearly rankings. The initial multiple
regression model indicated that, with data from 1988­2012, the percentage of female
participation was positively associated with year but--at the 1% level--not age group or
race distance (R2 = .064; year
= .09, p = .0061; Age: F[6,410] = 2.02, p = .061; Distance:
F(2,410) = 4.48 , p = 0.012). Nonetheless, given the earlier results suggesting heterogeneity
within age groups, we conducted regressions separately for each (see Table 5). There were
significant increases in the percentage of female participation for the 45­49 (0.29% per
year) and 50­54 (0.23% per year) age groups.
We repeated these analyses using only data from the last 15 years, from 1998­2012.
The percentage of female participation was not predicted by any of the three candidate
variables (R2 = .03; year
= -.06, p = .34; Age: F[6,200] = 0.34, p = 0.92; Distance: F[2,200]
= 1.13, p = .32). Within age groups, there was a significant increase in the 45­49 age group
(0.60% per year) and a significant decrease in the 70­74 age group (-0.72% per year; see
Table 5). We also repeated these analyses using data from only the last 6 years, 2007­2012
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -863-
(no data were available from 2002­2006). In this case, the model suggested an overall
decrease in female participation, although this did not reach significance (R2 = .12; year
=
-.37, p = .10; Age: F[6,116] = 1.48, p = 0.19 ; Distance: F[2,116] = 1.91 , p = 0.15). There
were no significant changes within age groups (see Table 5).

Social role convergence
Finally, we investigated whether our main results would change if we substituted
measures of social role convergence for year. The logic is that although year is, in general,
positively associated with various measures of social convergence (see Figure 2), the yearly
value of one (or more) of these more direct measures might prove to be a stronger predictor
of female participation than year itself. In addition, for each of these measures, we
examined predictive capacity of each measure's yearly value from the year when the
individuals in an age group were approximately 8 years old and also from the year when
they were approximately 14 years old.
In the Supplemental Information (see Tables S1­S22), we present results for each
social role convergence measure pooled across all age groups (controlling for age group
and race distance). Tables S1­S22 also present results stratified by age group, but given the
sometimes small sample sizes, we restrict our summaries in the text to the overall models.
In addition, although we continue to use a 1% significance level ( = 0.01), we note all p-
values less than 0.10.
Labor force
Increased women in the labor force predicted a significant increase in female
participation in the USA championship meet across all 25 years (1988­2012), but not for
the past 15 years (1998­2012) or past 10 years (2003­2012; see Table S1). This pattern
was unchanged when we used labor force data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see
Table S2) and 14 years old (see Table S3).
When we examined yearly rankings, rather than the USA championship meets,
increased women in the labor force again predicted a significant increase in female track
participation across all 25 years, and it was a nearly significant predictor the past 15 years
(p = 0.06) and the past 6 years (2007­2012; p = 0.05; see Table S4). When we used labor
force data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table S5) and 14 years old (see Table
S6), women in the labor force again predicted a significant increase in female track
participation across all 25 years (1988­2012) but not for the past 15 or 6 years.
Wage gap
Decreased wage gap (i.e., increased women's earnings relative to men's) predicted
a significant increase in female participation in the USA championship meet across all 25
years, but not for the past 15 or 10 years (see Table S7). However, the increase for the past
15 was nearly significant (p = 0.06). There was insufficient wage gap data to test any age
groups when cohorts were 8 years old. Only the 40­44 age group could be tested when age
group cohorts were 14 years old, and this only included data from 2007­2012 (see Table
S8). The result was that decreased wage gap predicted a near significant (p = .04) decrease
in female participation (i.e., a result contrary to social structural theory).
For yearly rankings, decreased wage gap predicted a significant increase in female
track participation across all 25 years, but not for the past 15 or 6 years (see Table S9).
There was insufficient wage gap data to test any age groups when age group cohorts were 8
years old. Only the 40­44 age group could be tested when the age group cohorts were 14
years old, and only for the years 2007­2012; there was not a significant effect (see Table
S10).

High school sports participation
Increased female high school sports participation predicted a significant increase in
female participation in the USA championship meet across all 25 years, but not for the past
15 or 10 years (see Table S11). This pattern was unchanged when we used (the limited)
high school participation data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table S12) and 14
years old (see Table S13), with one exception: Increased female high school sports
participation when age group cohorts were 14 years old predicted a significant decrease in
national championship participation (i.e., contrary to social structural theory).
For yearly rankings, increased female high school sports participation predicted a
significant increase in female track participation across all 25 years, but not for the past 15
years (see Table S14). Over the past 6 years, increased female high school sports
participation predicted a nearly significant decrease in female track participation (p = .02;
see Table S14; i.e., contrary to social structural theory). Results were similar when we used
(the limited) high school participation data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table
S15) and 14 years old (see Table S16).
Olympic participation
Increased female Olympic participation predicted a significant increase in female
participation in the USA championship meet across all 25 years, but not for the past 15 or
10 years (see Table S17). This pattern was unchanged when we used Olympic participation
data when age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table S18) and 14 years old (see Table
S19).
For yearly rankings, increased female Olympic participation predicted a significant
increase in female participation across all 25 years, but not for the past 15 years (see Table
S20). Over the past 6 years, increased female Olympic participation predicted a nearly
significant decrease in female track participation (p = .03; see Table S20; i.e., contrary to
social structural theory). Patterns were similar when we used Olympic participation data
when age group cohorts were 8 years (see Table S21) and 14 years old (see Table S22),
although there was no indication of a decrease when using data from the past 6 years.
Discussion
This study had three main results. First, we found a large sex difference in masters
participation with two large data sets: USA Championships and yearly rankings (see Table
2). Across all years combined, women constituted 27% of participants in the USA national
championships meet and 22% of those individuals who appeared in the yearly rankings.
These results fully corroborate Study 1, which found similar sex differences with two other
independent data sets.
This study's second main result was that, in both data sets, we found that the sex
difference in masters participation significantly decreased across the 25 years for which we
had data, from 1988­2012. Nonetheless, in both data sets, the decreasing sex difference has
not occurred since approximately the late 1990s. Moreover, the historical change was
modest: For the USA championships, women constituted 21% of participants from 1988­
1992, the first 5-year block, and between 26% and 30% of participants in every 5-year
block since (29% from 2008­2012); for the yearly rankings, women constituted 20% of

participants from 1988­1992 and between 21% and 23% in every 5-year block since (22%
from 2008­2012).
This study's third important result was that these results proved robust when we
substituted four direct measures of social role convergence for year (i.e., labor force, wage
gap, high school sports participation, and Olympic participation). In particular, for each of
the four social role convergence measures and both measures of masters participation (i.e.,
eight tests in total), there was a significant decrease in the sex difference from 1988­2012.
However, in no case did the significant decrease persist when we only examined the last 15
years, 1998­2012. There were two cases that were suggestive (p < 0.10), but in neither case
did the other participation data set corroborate it. First, from 1998­2012, labor force was a
nearly significant predictor for yearly rankings (p = .06; 0.77% increase per year; see Table
S5); however, over this period, labor force was not predictive for USA championships (p =
.96; see Table S5). Second, from 1998­2012, wage gap was a nearly significant predictor
for USA championships (p = .06; 0.61% per year; see Table S8); however, over this period,
wage gap was not predictive for yearly rankings (p = .65; see Table S10).
We also repeated the analyses of direct measures of social role convergence using
each measure's yearly value from the year when the individuals in an age group were
approximately 8 years old (mid-childhood) and also from the year when they were
approximately 14 years old (early adolescence). For labor force and Olympic participation
there was sufficient historical data to conduct complete tests: In both cases, for both
masters participation measures, the sex difference significantly decreased from 1988­2012
but not from 1998­20012. For wage gap and high school sports participation, fewer tests
could be conducted, mostly with younger age groups and for recent years. For both of these
predictors, and for both masters participation measures, all tests failed to reach
significance, and the coefficients were uniformly in the direction contrary to social
structural theory.
The timing and cause(s) of the sex difference in female participation
What aspects of social structural convergence could have caused the increase in
female participation? Unfortunately, our analyses could not answer this question because
all four direct measures of social role convergence were qualitatively identical to year
itself; they predicted significant increases from 1988­2012 but not since the late 1990s. The
lagged analyses of these measures yielded similar results.
One possibility is that one or more social changes occurring in the 1990s increased
the motivation of masters-aged women to compete. There was for example, an increase in
female athletes appearing on television during this decade (Messner, Duncan, and Cooky,
2003). Another possibility is that changes occurring during childhood or adolescence were
critical, although this possibility is perhaps less likely because the changes would then have
occurred at different times for different age groups. For instance, a 70 year-old woman
competing in 1998 would have been 14 years old in 1942, whereas a 40 year-old woman
competing in 1998 would have 14 in 1972. Future research might explore this issue by
tracking specific age group cohorts over time, especially as data accumulates in the coming
decades.
One thing that is notable about the timing of the female participation increase,
generally in the 1990s, is that it is inconsistent with the hypothesis that Title IX affected
female competitiveness due to girls growing up with more female athletic role models. For
A stable sex difference in competitiveness

example, given the spike in female high school sports participation in the 1970s and 1980s
(see Figure 2) if this hypothesis was correct, 40 year-old women in 2012 (who were 14
years old in 1986) should have been participating far more than 40 year-old women in 1998
(who were 14 years old in 1972); however, there was no evidence for such an increase.
General Discussion
There has been long-standing interest in testing the two major theories for the
origins of sex differences in preferences and motivations, social structural theory and
evolutionary theory. Although much empirical research has been conducted, almost all of it
has relied on self-reports. These can be problematic for several reasons, including that the
same item might be interpreted differently (e.g., become socially undesirable) in different
time periods (Lueptow et al., 2001) and because response variability might reflect
individuals' choice of comparison group (e.g., own sex vs. both sexes) when responding to
rating scales (Wood and Eagly 2012; but see Schmitt et al., 2008). Therefore, the studies
presented in this article--based on real-world behavior rather than self-reports--represent
an important complement to previous work.
Study 1 provided new evidence that, although slightly more women than men
participate in masters distance running in the contemporary U.S., among the fairly small
number of individuals that run with a competitive orientation, men substantially outnumber
women. This was demonstrated because at masters track meets, where we showed that
most participants actually run fast, men participate about three times more often than
women do.
Because Study 1 established the validity of the sex difference in masters track
participation as an indicator of the sex difference in competitiveness, Study 2 could address
the possibility of change over time. For both the USA championships and yearly rankings
datasets, the results were clear: The sex difference decreased from 1988 to 2012, but there
was no evidence of change since the late 1990s. These results provide powerful
corroboration of previous studies (Deaner, 2006a, 2013; Deaner and Mitchell, 2011)
indicating that the sex difference in competitiveness is large and stable. Because social
roles have been generally converging (see Figure 2), these results challenge social
structural theory, at least with regards to competitiveness in sports in the U.S.
Objections
One potential objection to our studies is that it might seem odd to measure a sex
difference in competitiveness in sports by quantifying the number of men and women who
participate at masters track meets. As discussed in Study 1, we believe this is a reasonable
approach given that fast performances occurred frequently at track meets, over 20 times
more often than at road races, and that previous survey studies have shown that, in large
populations of recreational runners, faster performances reliably correlate with greater self-
reported competitiveness (Masters et al. 1993; Ogles et al., 1995; Ogles and Masters 2000,
2003). We acknowledge that these surveys did not recruit track meet participants, and it is
conceivable that these runners generally run fast despite generally having low
competitiveness. However, we know of no reason to anticipate this; furthermore, many
track meet participants also participate in road races.
It is also worth noting that there are other lines of evidence indicating an average
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -868-
sex difference in competitiveness in U.S. distance runners. First, men are more likely than
women to run fast relative to sex-specific world class standards, and this is likely due, in
part, to their greater competitiveness and willingness to maintain large training volumes
(Deaner, 2006a, 2013; Deaner and Mitchell, 2011). Second, men are more likely than
women to report that competition motivates them to run (Callen, 1983; Johnsgard, 1985;
Ogles and Masters, 2003). Third, a study reported that when they have the option of
entering a single-sex competitive road race or a single-sex non-competitive road race held
in the same location on the same day, men were substantially more likely than women to
select the competitive race (Garratt, Weinberger, and Johnson, 2013). Finally, it has been
shown that there is a robust difference in pacing in the marathon: Men are three times more
likely than women to slow dramatically, and this probably reflects, in part, men's greater
propensity for risk-taking (Deaner, Carter, Joyner, and Hunter, 2014), which may be related
to their greater competitiveness (Cárdenas, Dreber, von Essen, and Ranehill, 2012; Croson
and Gneezy, 2009; Wilson and Daly, 1985).
A second potential objection to our interpretation is that social roles have not, in
fact, substantially converged over our study period. This is because men are still greatly
over-represented in many positions in society, particularly positions of leadership (Koenig
et al., 2011; NCWGE, 2012; Wood and Eagly, 2012). This objection is not compelling,
however, because tests of social structural theory do not require that men and women have
identical social roles; they only require general convergence. And the evidence for
convergence in the U.S. is strong even since the 1990s, at least for some measures (see
Figure 2). This is true in education, the labor force, and cultural products (NCWGE, 2012;
Twenge et al., 2012). Moreover, in Study 2 we showed that analyses using more direct
measures of social role convergence (i.e., yearly values for labor force, wage gap, high
school sports participation, and Olympic participation) yielded results that were highly
similar to those using year itself. These findings underscore that changes in social roles
were not consistently associated with changes in the sex difference in masters track
participation.
In addition, it has been argued that the influence of social roles might be partly
domain-specific (Koenig et al., 2011), and the convergence of social roles has been clear in
sports. Most notably, Olympic and professional opportunities for female athletes have
greatly increased (see Figure 2; Eitzen and Sage, 2002; Lowen et al., 2014), and girls and
women have come to comprise more than 40% of participants in organized school sports in
the U.S. (see Figure 2; National Federation of State High School Associations, 2010;
NCAA Research, 2010). In fact, Title IX scholars and advocates routinely claim that this
convergence in social roles in sports has diminished and will eventually eliminate the
remaining sex difference in sports interest (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist,
2007). Although there is little empirical evidence for these claims (Deaner et al., 2012),
their repeated assertion indicates that the expectation of convergence in competitiveness in
sports is highly plausible.
A third, related objection acknowledges that social roles have converged but claims
that there will be a substantial time lag between this and the convergence in female
competitiveness. In other words, the 25 years of our study or the 40 years since the passage
of Title IX simply was not enough time. Because one could always claim that more time is
needed, this hypothesis is, in some sense, unfalsifiable. However, it can be noted that
previous studies of changes in sex differences across time within the U.S. did not anticipate
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -869-
or report evidence for a generation lag; instead, they assumed that if one generational
cohort had substantially different experiences in childhood and adolescence than another,
they would develop differently (e.g., Twenge, 1997b, 2001). In fact, because childhood and
adolescent sport experience may strongly affect adult sports interest (Fredricks and Eccles,
2005; Scheerder et al., 2006), our results seem particularly damaging to social structural
theory. This is because the early athletic experience and available role models for female
masters runners participating in the late 1990s were strikingly different than those of
contemporary female masters runners (see Figure 2).
A fourth objection recognizes that social structural theory has been falsified for
distance running but argues this pattern may not hold for other sports. This objection merits
consideration, but the available data provide little support for it. Historical and cross-
societal studies of sports indicate that many societies have had appreciable female
participation and interest, especially in societies where women have enjoyed greater control
of resources and political power (Deaner and Smith, 2013). Nonetheless, boys and men
appear to be substantially more involved than girls and women in all societies (Deaner and
Smith, 2013; Ellis, 2011; Guttman, 1991). In fact, even in the U.S., where many experts
assert that there is no sex difference in general sports interest (NCWGE, 2012) or else that
it is rapidly disappearing (Brake, 2010; Hogshead-Makar and Zimbalist, 2007), men
actually show substantially greater interest (Deaner et al., 2012). Most relevant is a recent
study that assessed intramural sports participation at colleges and universities, which
mainly entail team sports; intramural participation is a superior measure of sports interest
than intercollegiate participation because intramurals do not involve external incentives
(e.g., scholarships) or constraints on participation (e.g., quotas or cuts). This study found
that, for both co-ed and single-sex intramural competition, men participated about three
times as frequently as women, and that this difference had been stable since at least the
early 2000s (Deaner et al., 2012).
Social roles and socialization
We have emphasized the finding that the sex difference in track participation has
not decreased since the late 1990s, despite continued convergence in social roles.
Nonetheless, our results can be fairly interpreted as partially supporting social structural
theory because, in both data sets, the sex difference decreased significantly, albeit
modestly, across all 25 years of the sample (1988 to 2012). As noted in the Discussion of
Study 2, our analyses were unable to specify the factors causing this difference although
the timing of change appears inconsistent with the idea that Title IX played a role.
Other lines of evidence are also consistent with the social structural or socialization
view of sports competitiveness yet do not demonstrate that socialization plays a causal role.
For example, many studies have shown that males and females have different sport-related
experiences, with, for instance, adolescent females experiencing greater pressure to eschew
sports, especially stereotypically masculine ones (Blinde and Taub, 1992; Kane and
Snyder, 1989; Sabo and Veliz, 2008; Shakib, 2003). However, to our knowledge, no
systematic comparison or experimental intervention has ever shown that sport-related
experience actually affects the development or expression of sports interest or
competitiveness. Another line of evidence comes from developmental studies
demonstrating, for example, that parents' perceptions of their children's sports ability are
associated with the children's ability beliefs and their participation (Fredricks and Eccles,
A stable sex difference in competitiveness
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 12(5). 2014. -870-
2005). Although this suggests that parents contribute to individual and sex differences in
sports interest, correlations of this kind might be driven by the children's behavior
(Fredricks and Eccles, 2005) or heritable genetic variation (Hur, McGue, and Iacono, 1996;
Lykken, Bouchard, McGue, and Tellegen, 1993).
In addition, the view that socialization explains all differences in sports interest or
competitiveness is undermined by converging evidence implicating a role for prenatal
androgens (e.g., testosterone). Females with congenital adrenal hyperplasia, a disease
characterized by heightened prenatal androgen exposure, are more likely than unaffected
females to show strong interest in stereotypically masculine sports (Berenbaum and Snyder,
1995; Berenbaum, 1999; Frisén et al., 2009). Within both men and women, lower second-
to-fourth digit ratio (2D:4D), a putative marker of high prenatal testosterone, is associated
with greater athletic ability (reviewed in Hönekopp and Schuster, 2010) and participation in
competitive sports (e.g., Giffin, Kennedy, Jones, and Barber, 2012; Manning and Taylor,
2001; Manning, 2002; Pokrywka, Rachon, Suchecka-Rachon, and Bitel, 2005). Finally,
much evidence indicates that exposure to prenatal androgens contributes to male-typical
childhood activity patterns (reviewed in Berenbaum and Beltz, 2011), and these activity
patterns, in turn, predict adult sports interest (Cardoso, 2009; Giuliano, Popp, and Knight,
2000).
In sum, the results from Study 2 suggest a meaningful but constrained role for
socialization, and this interpretation is fully consistent with previous empirical research.
Compatibility of social structural theory and evolutionary theory
In considering social structural theory in this article, we have exclusively focused
on its prediction that converging social roles will consistently decrease sex differences in
preferences and motivations and also that this prediction is at odds with an evolutionary
approach. Arguably, this unfairly represents social structural theory in two ways. First, its
developers take pains to show its compatibility with evolutionary theory (Wood and Eagly,
2002, 2012). In particular, social structural theory explicitly acknowledges that sex
differences in body size, strength, and childrearing capabilities are products of natural
selection and that these sex differences (but not partly innate psychological predispositions)
have crucial implications for the efficient performance of many activities in human
societies and thus the division of labor and social roles.2
Second, and perhaps more importantly, in explaining how differing social roles
eventually produce sex differences in behavior, social structural theory specifies numerous
mediating proximate mechanisms (e.g., social role beliefs, hormonal regulation, self-
regulation to gender identities; Wood and Eagly, 2002, 2012). Thus, one might argue that
social structural theory has not been challenged by Study 2's results because, although
social roles changed in the U.S. during the study period, for unknown reasons, these
changes did not engage the crucial mediating mechanisms (which we did not assess). This
2
Wood and Eagly (2012; p. 66) acknowledge the possibility of partly innate psychological predispositions
based, for example, on prenatal androgenization of male fetuses. Nevertheless, they deny that the evidence for
these mechanisms is compelling and that these mechanisms contribute meaningful variation to behavioral sex
differences.
A stable sex difference in competitiveness

argument warrants consideration, but it ultimately seems unconvincing. This is because
proponents of social structural theory enthusiastically cite studies indicating links between
social roles and behavioral sex differences as crucially supporting the theory (Wood and
Eagly, 2012). If such studies count in favor of social structural theory, then the stable sex
difference in masters track participation shown in Study 2 must count against it.
Concluding remarks
Social structural theory has been enormously fruitful (Eagly and Wood, 1999;
Wood and Eagly, 2002, 2012). Nonetheless, our results are consistent with other studies
indicating that, despite the importance of social roles and associated socialization
processes, social structural theory cannot provide a comprehensive account of sex
differences in preferences and motivations (e.g., Archer, 2009; Buss, 1989; Gangestad et
al., 2006; Lippa, 2009, 2010; Schmitt, 2005, 2012; Schmitt et al., 2008). Instead, scholars
must explore the interactions between evolved dispositions and various environmental
factors, including social roles.
In addition, we suggest that future research should address temporal changes in sex
differences in sports interest and competitiveness in the U.S. using other measures and
addressing other sports. Similarly, these issues should be investigated with cross-societal
comparisons (Deaner and Smith, 2013).
Finally, future research should address the extent to which sex differences in sports
interest and competitiveness relate to sex differences in other kinds of preferences and
motivations, such as risk-taking. In pursuing this research, we hope that others will follow
our lead in attempting to measure behaviorally expressed preferences. We have shown that
participation in voluntary physical activity is one promising area. However, there are likely
many others, including television viewing preferences and internet searches (Ogas and
Gaddam, 2012). Ideally, complementary methodologies can be used, and these should
ultimately permit the most compelling conclusions.
