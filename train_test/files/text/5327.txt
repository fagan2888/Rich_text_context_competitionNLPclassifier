index), and lower extremity parameters (thrombus-lysis grade and Villalta scale score) were
recorded.
Results: All 20 patients' clinical manifestations significantly improved. Both the clinical
success rate and technical success rate were 100%. No major adverse events occurred during
hospitalization. Four patients developed iliac vein compression syndrome and underwent stent
implantation in the iliac vein. No pulmonary embolism recurred within 16.5Æ6.8 months of
follow-up.
Conclusions: The combination of PMT and CDT is a safe and effective treatment for APE and
LEDVT with good short- and intermediate-term clinical outcomes.

Introduction
Venous thromboembolism, which includes
deep venous thrombosis (DVT) and acute
pulmonary embolism (APE), is a major
contributor to the global disease burden
and is the third most common cardiovascu-
lar pathology after coronary artery disease
and stroke.1 APE may cause chest pain,
dyspnea, hypoxia, hypotension, and
shock, while lower extremity DVT
(LEDVT) can block the venous lumen and
lead to venous congestion, swelling, and
lower extremity venous valve function
damage resulting in post-thrombotic syn-
drome (PTS). The rate of long-term compli-
cations of venous thromboembolism
including chronic thromboembolic pulmo-
nary hypertension after APE2 and PTS
from DVT, may reach 40%.3 Patients
with these complications are more likely
to develop lifelong adverse clinical conse-
quences and are the most frequently hospi-
talized for treatment. In contemporary
clinical practice, a focus should always be
placed on relieving APE symptoms because
of the lethality of this condition. In most
cases, treatment of thrombi in the lower
extremity is initiated only after completion
of thrombolysis in the pulmonary artery.
Inherently, such management prolongs the
lysis time, lowers the treatment efficacy, and
may miss the best therapeutic window for
LEDVT (normally 14 days), resulting in a
distinct increase in the incidence of PTS.
For the treatment of venous thromboembo-
lism, systemic thrombolysis alone ineffec-
tively removes thrombi of the deep venous
system; hence, catheter-directed thromboly-
sis (CDT) with or without percutaneous
mechanical thrombectomy (PMT) is
becoming the standard of medical care in
the treatment of acute and subacute proxi-
mal DVT.4,5 The present prospective study
was performed to evaluate the feasibility,
efficacy and safety of PMTþCDT for con-
current management of APE and LEDVT.
Materials and methods
Study population
The present study was conducted as an
open noncomparative prospective cohort
over a time span of 1 year (Jan 2015­Dec
Liu et al. 837
2015) in the Department of Vascular
Surgery at The Affiliated Hospital of
Qingdao University, HuangDao District,
Shandong, China. Approval for the study
was obtained from the ethics committee of
the institute, and all patients provided writ-
ten informed consent. The American
College of Chest Physicians Guidelines 9th
edition6 and the Diagnosis and
Management of Acute Pulmonary
Embolism of the European Society of
Cardiology7 were used to define whether
the diagnoses of LEDVT and APE were
established.
Inclusion criteria
The inclusion criteria for the present study
were as follows:
a. dyspnea, hypoxia, or hemodynamic
instability
b. evidence of APE by computed tomo-
graphic pulmonary angiography or pul-
monary arteriography
c. diagnosis of LEDVT by duplex ultra-
sound (DUS) or venography
d. overwhelming symptoms of lower
extremity swelling, incapacitating pain,
or phlegmasia dolens, indicating an
extensive iliocaval or iliofemoral throm-
bus that is compromising lower limb
blood flow
e. APE and LEDVT onset of <14 days
Exclusion criteria
The following patients were excluded from
the study:
a. patients with asymptomatic LEDVT who
underwent conventional anticoagulation
treatment at our institution
b. patients with contraindications to antico-
agulation or thrombolytic therapy, such
as a history of major bleeding, recent
delivery or major surgery (up to 10 days
before study onset), neurosurgical inter-
vention (up to 3 months), recent signifi-
cant trauma, or a disease with a known
risk of hemorrhagic complications
c. patients who refused to participate in
follow-up
d. patients with no APE but with only iso-
lated infrapopliteal thrombosis, recurrent
ipsilateral LEDVT, pre-existing leg
ulcers, a short life expectancy, or contra-
indications for the use of contrast media
All patients who met the inclusion crite-
ria were included in this study. Patients who
showed a rapid deterioration of their car-
diopulmonary condition underwent
oxygen supplementation with noninvasive
pressure support or intubation. Positive
inotropic and vasoactive support with cat-
echolamines was also performed according
to the patient's hemodynamic condition
prior to right heart catheterization and pul-
monary angiography.
Definitions and outcomes
Primary outcomes. The primary outcomes of
this study were evaluation of safety by cal-
culation of the major adverse events rate
and in-hospital death rate and evaluation
of efficacy by calculation of the clinical suc-
cess rate and technical success rate.
Clinical success was defined as improve-
ment in the clinical manifestations or a
decrease in the vasopressor requirement
and hemodynamic decompensation in
patients with APE as well as alleviation of
lower limb swelling in patients with
LEDVT, without major adverse events or
in-hospital death. Digital subtraction pul-
monary angiograms obtained at baseline
and after PMTþCDT of the pulmonary
arteries and lower extremity were reviewed
by two vascular surgeons and two radiolog-
ists. Technical success was defined as suc-
cessful placement and withdrawal of the
devices and completion of the procedure
838 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
without major complications such as perfo-
ration of the pulmonary artery or cardiac
structures, tamponade, cerebral vascular
accident, or death.
Major adverse events were defined as
treatment-related events requiring surgery
or transfusion, the need for dialysis, wors-
ening pulmonary artery hypertension, and
any stroke, hypoxia or shock, and/or peri-
operative death. Minor adverse events
were defined as transient catheter-induced
arrhythmia, mild contrast reactions,
catheter-related infection, and small hema-
tomas not requiring transfusion. A major
hematoma was defined as a hematoma
requiring one or more blood transfusions.
Secondary outcomes. Secondary outcomes
were the pulmonary arterial pressure
(PAP), partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
blood, Miller score (MS), thigh and calf cir-
cumference, shock index, thrombus-lysis
grade, and Villalta scale (VS) score.
The variation in the pulmonary artery
indicating the thrombus burden from base-
line to postoperative digital subtraction
arteriography was assessed by the MS,8
the use of which was shifted in the present
study from the traditional emphasis on
radiological imaging to managing treatment
based on physiologic measurements of car-
diac function obtained from echocardio-
gram reading as well as the patient's
clinical condition.9 The MS was calculated
by two blinded reviewers. As previously
described,10 the right and left main pulmo-
nary arteries are considered to have nine
and seven major branches, respectively,
and an embolism in any of these branches
is scored as 1 point. Each lung is considered
to have an upper, middle, and lower zone,
and in each of these three zones, the
absence of pulmonary artery flow is
scored as 3 points; severely reduced flow,
2 points; mildly reduced flow, 1 point; and
normal flow, 0 points. Therefore, the MS
ranges from 0 to 34. We did not classify
massive or submassive APE into subgroups.
We followed the reporting standard of a
national multicenter registry11 that assessed
the pre- and post-lysis thrombus effect in
the extremity by grading the portion of
thrombolysis at the completion of treat-
ment as follows: complete (Grade III,
>90% clearance), near complete (Grade
II, 50%­90% clearance), or partial (Grade
I, <50% clearance). We used DUS to inves-
tigate venous patency during follow-up.
Other variables that were analyzed to eval-
uate the effect of therapy were the PAP,
partial pressure of oxygen in arterial
blood, and thigh and calf circumference
before and after treatment. We calculated
the mean circumference by measuring the
thigh circumference 15 cm above the knee
joint and that of the calf 10 cm below the
tibial tuberosity. Hemodynamic measure-
ments were obtained before diagnostic angi-
ography was performed and after the
procedure. Hemodynamic decompensation
was in turn defined as new-onset sustained
hypotension, a new requirement for ino-
tropes or vasopressors, or continued or
worsening hypotension despite treatment.
Procedures
All procedures included four sequential
steps: venography, implantation of the infe-
rior vena cava (IVC) filter, treatment for
APE, and treatment for LEDVT. The pro-
cedures were performed in a hybrid operat-
ing room with a fixed angiography suite,
and punctures were performed under DUS
guidance.
Venography. Before the procedure, the
patients were diagnosed with LEDVT via
DUS. The superficial veins were blocked
by a tourniquet on the ipsilateral ankle,
and Ultravist (Bayer Schering Pharma,
Berlin, Germany) diluted 1:1 with saline
was manually injected into the ipsilateral
dorsalis pedis vein at the speed of 2 ml/s
Liu et al. 839
while performing digital subtraction venog-
raphy. This standard procedure was per-
formed in all patients to determine the
proximal and distal extent of the thrombus
and estimate the overall clot burden.
Implantation of IVC filter. All patients under-
went IVC filter implantation using a stan-
dard protocol as previously described.12
After sterilizing the contralateral inguinal
area and perineum, a 6-French sheath was
placed into the common iliac vein through a
puncture in the common femoral vein, and
20 ml of contrast medium (Ultravist
300 mg; Bayer Schering Pharma) was
injected at a speed of 10 ml/s. A 5000-U
intravenous bolus dose of unfractionated
heparin (UFH) (Changzhou Qianhong
Bio-Pharma Co. Ltd., Changzhou, China)
was administered followed by continuous
intravenous infusion of UFH at the rate
of 1000 U/h through the side port of the
sheath. The long sheath was then advanced
to the level of the inferior renal vein, and
the IVC filter (OptEase filter; Cordis,
Miami, FL, USA) was released below the
infrarenal level. The accurate positioning of
the filter was reconfirmed with venography
after completion of the procedure. The filter
was inserted via the right jugular route in
one patient with LEDVT in the bilateral
lower limbs. Under fluoroscopic guidance,
the filters were retrieved following the stan-
dard protocol12 after completion of the
thrombolytic infusion procedure.
Treatment for APE. Under local anesthesia, a
6-French, 10-cm vascular sheath (Terumo
Medical Corporation, Elkton, MD, USA)
was inserted in the ipsilateral femoral vein
through a puncture, and then a 6-French
curved pigtail catheter (Cordis
Corporation, Miami Lakes, FL, USA)
was passed by the IVC filter with deliberate
calibration and advanced into the main pul-
monary artery for pulmonary angiography
(Figure 1). Digital subtraction
arteriography was subsequently performed
to confirm the amplitude and magnitude of
the thrombus (Figure 1(a)). The intralumi-
nal PAP was measured with a Swan­Ganz
catheter (Baxter Healthcare, Irvine, CA,
USA) after a satisfactory pulmonary
artery waveform was recorded. Following
the American College of Cardiology para-
digm,13 a 6-French pigtail catheter (12-mm
diameter) was used in the central portion of
the pulmonary artery, whereas a 5-French
catheter (8-mm diameter) was used in the
peripheral part of the pulmonary vascular
tree. Once the embolic occlusion of the pul-
monary artery had been passed with
the wire, the catheter was manually
rotated around the axis of the guidewire
(Figure 1(b)). While rotating, it was repeat-
edly moved back and forth over several cen-
timeters within the clot. This was followed
by manual clot aspiration via a 20-ml
syringe with a Luer Lock connector until
sufficient fragmentation of the embolus
was achieved. After the embolus had been
fragmented with the rotating pigtail cathe-
ter, percutaneous transluminal angioplasty
(PTA) was performed through the larger
sheath if significant thrombosis (>50% of
the lumen) was found. During this session,
the thromboembolism in the pulmonary
artery or branches was incompletely dilated
using one or two 3- to 6-mm balloon
catheters (Admiral Xtreme; INVATEC/
Medtronic, Minneapolis, MN, USA)
based on the diameter of the target pulmo-
nary artery (Figure 1(c)). A balloon cathe-
ter was utilized to crush the thrombus
attached to the vessel wall. The patient
then received an intrapulmonary pulse
spray thrombolysis injection of urokinase
(200 Â 103 U) via the thrombolytic catheter
(Unifuse, 240 cm; Angiodynamics, Latham,
NY, USA), and the catheter was retained in
the artery for subsequent adjuvant infusion
therapy. Pulmonary angiography and PAP
measurement were repeated and recorded
(Figure 1(f)).

Treatment for LEDVT. After venography, we
punctured the contralateral common femo-
ral vein or the mildly thrombosed vein if
both lower extremities were thrombosed
(Figure 2(a)). A 6-French Balkin sheath
(Cook Medical Inc., Bloomingdale, IN,
USA) was introduced to cross the bifurca-
tion of the IVC and placed in the ipsilateral
iliac vein. If severe iliac vein stenosis
(>70%) was found, an Admiral Xtreme
balloon catheter (6­8 Â 120 mm/130 cm;
INVATEC/Medtronic) was used to predi-
late the lesion. After placement of a 0.035-
inch guidewire (Terumo Medical, Tokyo,
Japan), a 4-French vertebral catheter
(Angiodynamics) was retrogradely
advanced via the iliac vein, femoral vein,
popliteal vein, and calf vein to penetrate
the thrombus. We performed contrast
venous angiography to reconfirm the
edge of the thrombosis (Figure 2(b)).
The vertebral catheter was then exchanged
for an Admiral Xtreme balloon catheter
(4­6 Â 120 mm/130 cm; INVATEC/
Medtronic). The balloon catheter was used
to pre-dilate the venous lumen (Figure 2
(c)). Next, a 4- or 5-French multi-side
hole thrombolytic catheter (Unifuse;

bosis. (a) Preoperative pulmonary angiography shows massive emboli in the upper and intermediate section
of a left lobe artery (white arrow) and in the intermediate section of a right lobe artery (white arrow). The
pulmonary arterial pressure was 52/22 (mean, 37) mmHg, and the Miller score was 18. (b) After initial
catheter fragmentation of the right lobe artery via a 6-French pigtail catheter, the embolus dislodged and

although some thrombi remained in the branches of pulmonary artery. The post-treatment pulmonary
arterial pressure was 28/8 (mean, 18) mmHg, and the Miller score was 9.

Angiodynamics) was then advanced across
the most severely clotted veins (unilateral or
bilateral), and infusion was initiated with
urokinase (200 Â 103 U) for standard
CDT (Figure 2(d)). The thrombolytic cath-
eter was repositioned via the guidewire to
ensure that the treatment zone traversed the
entire clot and the tip exited the thrombus.
The catheter was retained in the veins for
adjuvant infusion therapy, and we typically
obtained a final venograph to reconfirm
that the clot burden had been alleviated
before all instruments were withdrawn
(Figure 2(e), (f)).
Postoperative and follow-up management
In the clinical ward, each patient was
instructed to move the ankle joint at regular
intervals. The patients' medical records

were reviewed and evaluated for demo-
graphics, risk factors for thromboembo-
lism, comorbidities, symptomatic
improvement or resolution after treatment,
hemodynamic parameters, thrombus clear-
ance, length of hospital stay, survival to dis-
charge, and complications.
The total dose of urokinase (average of
800 Â 103 U/day) was administered to the
patient through two infusion catheters.
One was located in the pulmonary arteries
and the other was located in a deep lower
extremity vein: each was used to deliver a
dose of 200 Â 103 U/day via pulse spray
injection and 200 Â 103 U/day via continu-
ous intravascular pumping. A total of
12,500 IU of UFH (Changzhou Qianhong
Bio-Pharma Co. Ltd.) was given through
the side port of the two sheaths (each
6250 IU) via continuous intravascular
pumping to bathe the clot along the cathe-
ter. An angiogram was obtained every 24
hours to assess the clot burden and treat-
ment efficacy. Blood samples were taken
every 12 hours to measure the hematocrit
level, hemoglobin level, active partial
thromboplastin time, fibrinogen level, and
platelet count to adjust the UFH dose and
detect blood loss.
Dose adjustment was performed accor-
dance with the laboratory results: a throm-
bolytic dose reduction was performed when
the fibrinogen level was <1.5 g/L, and
thrombolysis was discontinued when the
fibrinogen level was <1 g/L. After throm-
bolysis, additional adjunctive procedures
(angioplasty or stent implantation) were
performed if an underlying vein stenosis of
>70% was present. Postprocedure venogra-
phy was performed before removing the
introducer. All patients continued to receive
anticoagulation therapy (low-molecular-
weight heparin followed by warfarin) to
preserve an international normalized ratio
of 2 to 3. Low-dose aspirin was prescribed
for three months for patients who under-
went stent implantation. All filters were
removed within 4 weeks. After discharge,
oral anticoagulation with warfarin was con-
tinued concomitant with the use of gradu-
ated elastic compression stockings. Clinical
follow-up by the referring physician includ-
ed physical examination, color Doppler
DUS, and measurement of the international
normalized ratio in all patients. Evaluation
of PTS was performed in compliance with
the modified VS.14 The clinical evaluation
outcomes were classified as follows: severe
PTS was defined as a total score of >14
points or a venous ulcer, mild PTS was
defined as 5 to 14 points, and no PTS was
defined as <5 points.15 Venous patency was
classified as complete recanalization for a
95% to 100% restoration of patency, par-
tial recanalization for 50% to 95%, and
minimal recanalization for <50% due to
residual stenosis or an organized
thrombus.16
Statistical analysis
Standard statistical tests were used to ana-
lyze discrete data. Discrete variables are
reported as numbers with percentages, and
continuous data are reported as mean and
standard deviation. Paired t-tests were used
to analyze continuous data, and the chi-
square test or Fisher's exact test was used
to compare nominal variables. Statistical
significance was set at P<0.05. The
Kaplan­Meier method was used to analyze
time-to-event survival data. All statistical
tests were performed using GraphPad
InStat (version 11.5; GraphPad Software,
Inc., La Jolla, CA, USA).
Results
Baseline demographic profile
Twenty consecutive patients diagnosed with
APE and LEDVT were enrolled in this
study. The baseline characteristics of these
20 patients are detailed in Table 1.
Liu et al. 843
The patients comprised 7 men and 13
women with a mean age of 61.4Æ13.5
years (range, 39­82 years). The duration
of symptoms prior to emergency presenta-
tion was 126Æ114 hours. APE was observed
in all 20 patients as follows: 2 (10%) in the
main pulmonary artery, 5 (25%) in the left
pulmonary artery, 7 (35%) in the right pul-
monary artery, and 6 (30%) in the segmen-
tal pulmonary arteries), and LEDVT was
present in 21 limbs (12 left limbs, 7 right
limbs, and 1 bilateral limbs) of the 20
patients. The clinical presentation and pre-
disposing factors are shown in Table 1.
Among the predisposing factors for throm-
boembolism, 3 (15%) patients had a history
of traumatic fracture, 1 (5%) patient was
diagnosed with a tumor, 4 (20%) patients
were diagnosed with iliac vein compression
syndrome via intraoperative angiography,
and 12 (60%) patients had no definite
cause of the LEDVT and APE.
Short-term clinical outcome
All patients received CDT along with
mechanical thrombofragmentation and
PTA during thrombolytic therapy. No in-
hospital death or major adverse events
occurred. The overall technical and clinical
success rates were 100% for APE and
LEDVT.
Outcome of APE treatment. In terms of APE
results, there was a highly significant
decrease in the mean PAP from 35.5
Æ6.5815 to 19.7Æ4.943 mmHg (P<0.0001)
(Figure 3), in the shock index from 1.089
Æ0.177 to 0.678Æ0.088 (P<0.0001), and in
the MS from 18.05Æ2.502 to 9.05Æ2.929
(P<0.0001). Complete circulatory restitu-
tion (return of systemic blood pressure to
normal, shock index of <1, and mean
PAP of <25 mmHg) before removing the
introducer was achieved in 17 of the 20
patients, whereas PAP remained elevated
in 3 patients (Table 2). The partial pressure
of oxygen in arterial blood significantly
increased from baseline levels (35.9Æ5.036
to 63.1Æ3.538 mmHg, P< 0.0001). The
infusion time was 30.10Æ21.77 hours
(range, 15­116 h).
Outcome of LEDVT treatment. In the treat-
ment of LEDVT, an abrupt decrease in
the mean circumference of the thigh and
calf was also noted when the CDT thera-
peutic scheme had been accomplished

(42.75Æ7.759 to 37.15Æ7.876 cm pre-
procedure, P< 0.0001) (Table 2 and
Figure 3). Besides this, four patients with
iliac vein compression syndrome underwent
successful venous stenting (Bard Luminexx,
12­14 mm in diameter, 80 mm in length; C.
R. Bard, Inc., Murray Hill, NJ, USA) fol-
lowed by immediate relief of the obstruc-
tion with good venous run off. The degree
of thrombolysis was calculated after com-
pletion of treatment: 7 (35%) patients had
Grade III lysis, 8 (40%) of patients had
Grade II lysis, and 5 (25%) of patients
had Grade I lysis at the end of intraluminal
thrombolysis.
Adverse events
No major adverse events occurred during
hospitalization, but minor adverse events
not requiring intervention or transfusion
were observed in the form of hemoptysis
in one patient with Grade II lysis and a
hematoma in one patient with Grade I
lysis. The dosages of urokinase and UFH
were both decreased in these two patients.
Additionally, the dosage of urokinase was
reduced for another two patients with
fibrinogen diminution. In one of these
patients, the amount of UFH was increased
(intravascular pumping) because the acti-
vated partial thromboplastin time was not
up to standard. No patient developed intra-
cranial hemorrhage, thrombocytopenia, or
recurrence of APE during hospitalization.
Follow-up
The mean follow-up time for the cohort was
16.5Æ6.8 months. Echocardiography and
DUS venography parameters were mea-
sured at baseline, postoperatively, and at
the latest follow-up visit. No patient devel-
oped APE recurrence during the follow-up

period. One patient died of a tumor approx-
imately 9 months after hospital discharge.
Ten patients (50% of all of patients) had
complete patency of the lower limb veins
as shown by DUS venography, while five
(25%) patients had partial patency. PTS
diagnosed using the VS17 (VS score of >5)
was seen in two patients (10%) prior to the
intervention. Two patients (10%) developed
mild to moderate PTS during follow-up
that mainly manifested as pain, heaviness,
and edema of the affected limbs after activ-
ity. These four patients were treated with
additional PTA and venous stenting.
Among them, two had patent veins during
follow-up, and the other two were diag-
nosed with recurrent LEDVT due to stent
restenosis.
The estimated overall adverse event-free
and death-free rates were 100% and 100%
at 30 days, 95% and 100% at 90 days, and
79.4% and 93.8% at 1 year, respectively
(Figure 3(f)).
Discussion
The general purpose of APE and LEDVT
management is to restore flow by early
recanalization of the obstructed venous seg-
ment and avoiding phlebostenosis caused
by thrombus organization, thus reducing
the risk and severity of pulmonary hyper-
tension and PTS. In the present study, we
demonstrated the following. First, PMT
combined with CDT rapidly improved the
patients' hemodynamic parameters and
clinical manifestations and provided a sat-
isfactory outcome for patients with APE
associated with LEDVT. Second, this
one-step endovascular strategy involving
simultaneous treatment of thrombi in the
pulmonary arteries and lower extremity
deep veins is a novel but feasible and effi-
cient algorithm, and it may have a potential
role in preventing long-term sequelae of
pulmonary hypertension or chronic venous
obstruction. However, to the best of our
knowledge, no previous reports have
described one-step treatment of APE com-
plicated with LEDVT using PMTþCDT or
pharmacomechanical therapy.
Despite the improvement in diagnostic
and therapeutic modalities, contemporary
in-hospital mortality of patients with APE
is still approximately 20%.18 Similarly, PTS
or chronic thromboembolic pulmonary
hypertension develops in 20% to 50% of
patients with LEDVT or APE.19,20
However, the treatments for APE and
LEDVT are separate in most studies. APE
is typically secondary to exfoliation of an
embolus that originally colonized a periph-
eral deep vein, but physicians usually take
APE into consideration first because of its
highly lethal nature. LEDVT must then be
treated in the second step, and the patient
may therefore miss the best treatment time
window and develop an organized throm-
bus. We performed the herein-described
one-step pharmacomechanical therapy to
reduce venous pressure overload in the
early period and minimize the risk of
long-term complications. Inherently, more
effort is required to lyse a chronic thrombus
than a fresh one, and early recanalization
reduces the incidence of chronic thrombo-
embolic pulmonary hypertension or
PTS.2,19,21 However, not all cases of
LEDVT require early treatment. We per-
form interventions for LEDVT when the
thrombus is found mainly above the knee
(femoral venous thrombosis) because a clot
in this part of the body often leads to phle-
bostenosis22 after discharge. If the throm-
bus is just located in the veins below the
knee, we simply perform intravenous
thrombolysis and anticoagulation. The
standard CDT procedure we applied in
this study was described in a previously
published article.23,24 We also used a bal-
loon catheter to crush large clots into
smaller ones during the thrombolytic ther-
apy. Based on our experience, monitoring
fibrinogen every 12 hours is sufficient, and
Liu et al. 847
we achieved a good cost-effective outcome.
There still no generally accepted protocol
for monitoring fibrinogen, but some schol-
ars have recommended a frequency of every
8 hours.25
PMT is used to relieve pulmonary
thromboembolic lesions and was first
reported about two decades ago, initially
using a pigtail rotation catheter.13,26 The
main concept of this technique is to crush
the clots in the pulmonary arteries, causing
fragmentation and distal migration of the
smaller fragments. The fragments have a
greater surface area that is exposed to the
thrombolytic agent, thus improving the
results of lytic activity and allowing for
reductions in the dose and infusion time.
More recent case series have demonstrated
that outcomes have been improving as the
technique has been refined.27­29 Piazza et
al.27 evaluated a cohort of 150 patients
with APE who were treated with an
ultrasound-facilitated system (EKOS
EndoWaveV
R ; EKOS Medical, Bothell,
WA) and CDT. Fifteen (10% of all)
major bleeding events occurred in their
series, whereas only two cases of moderate
bleeding (10% of all) occurred in the pre-
sent study. This result may have been due to
the fact that two baseline indexes, the mean
PAP (51.4­36.9 mmHg, P<0.0001) and the
MS (22.5­15.8, P<0.0001), were both
higher in their study than in ours, indicating
more severe embolism. In our study, seven
(35%) patients had Grade III lysis, eight
(40%) had Grade II lysis, and 5 (25%)
had Grade I lysis after infusion, which is
in agreement with the results found in the
literature.30,31 Few studies have reported on
patency after 6 months. According to a
Cochrane review,32 the patency rates vary
from 65% to 98%, major bleeding compli-
cations range from 0% to 11%, and the rate
of PTS ranges from 3% to 48%. We iden-
tified a low PTS rate (10%) and low major
bleeding rate (0%) in our study, which may
be attributed to the decrease in the
thrombolysis dose due to prompt thrombus
fragmentation (PMTþPTA); however, this
conclusion is limited by the small study
sample. Compared with CDT alone, PMT
has been shown to result in similar levels of
clot removal but with a significant reduc-
tion in the infusion time and total dose of
thrombolytic, thus potentially reducing
adverse bleeding events and low-dose
thrombolysis; it has also been shown to
reduce PTS recurrence.4,5 This is why we
conducted PMTþCDT in our study.
Although numerous devices have been
recently developed for pharmacomechani-
cal thrombolysis, we performed mechanical
thrombectomy by manual rotation and
aspiration using pigtail catheters. This is a
relatively elementary practice. Newly devel-
oped catheters such as the rotating motor-
ized system (CLEANER XT; Argon
Medical Devices, Plano, TX, USA), rheo-
lytic instruments (AngioJet system; Boston
Scientific, Marlborough, MA, USA), or
ultrasound-facilitated systems (EKOS
EndoWave) are not available to us.
However, Lin et al.33 demonstrated no sig-
nificant difference in the thrombus removal
rate during pharmacomechanical thrombol-
ysis between the AngioJet system and CDT
in the management of LEDVT. Indeed,
multiple devices are available to perform
PMT. We believe that these new and spe-
cially designed pharmacomechanical
thrombolysis devices may surpass manual
mechanical thrombus fragmentation.
However, the most effective strategy ulti-
mately relies on the physician's knowledge
of each device and specific patient charac-
teristics to determine which device offers
the best risk­benefit ratio. Mechanical
thrombus fragmentation still plays a role
in APE and LEDVT management because
it is readily available and has a high cost­
benefit ratio.
The IVC filter plays a small but crucial
role in the procedure because it prevents
recurrence of APE. The advantage of the
848 Journal of International Medical Research 46(2)
IVC filter remains controversial, however.
We inserted the IVC filter with this consid-
eration. First, all of the patients in this
study had been diagnosed with APE,
which is the indication for implantation of
an IVC filter as recommended by estab-
lished guidelines.7,34 Second, the incidence
of the thrombus falling off during percuta-
neous CDT is high; thus, an IVC filter is
rationally placed to prevent APE recur-
rence. However, it must be emphasized
that misplacement or malpositioning of
the filter may cause IVC perforation, and
the IVC filter itself can cause recurrent
thrombogenesis.35 We therefore choose the
OptEase filter because of its olive-like shape
and lack of a sharp claw configuration
rather than filters such as the Gunther
Tulip (Cook Medical Inc.). We placed the
filter with extraordinary precaution. All
motions were as slight as possible to con-
firm that the filter had been placed in
the optimal position when the catheter
passed it.
We did not use venous stents because the
only available venous stent in our institu-
tion is the Wallstent (Boston Scientific),
which has a steel weave helical design, is
soft in structure, and is not suitable for
stiff chronic venous stenosis such as that
in patients with iliac vein compression syn-
drome. However, we used a Luminexx stent
(Bard, Inc.) because this stent is made by
laser cutting and provides a better braced
force with which to prop the stenosis. We
have performed 300 Luminexx stent
implantations in patients with venous ste-
nosis with patient follow-up every 6
months. The outcome is very promising:
90% of patients maintained patency, and
>70% of them had complete patency
(>90% true luminal cavity) at the 1-year
follow-up. However, the need for a specially
designed stent in the treatment of phlebos-
tenosis is obvious. We anticipate the future
development of more effective venous
stents.
Limitations
The major limitation of our study was the
lack of a comparator group. Because we did
not include a comparator group, we cannot
directly compare on the efficacy or safety of
PMTþCDT versus CDT in APE or
LEDVT alone. In addition, the number of
patients enrolled was not large.
Conclusion
Our prospective study has demonstrated
the successful treatment of patients with
APE and LEDVT via PMT and CDT.
The results showed significant improve-
ments in hemodynamics and respiratory
parameters, good short- and long-term
patency, and a low PTS rate, indicating
that this is a low-risk and promising strate-
gy for treatment of acute venous thrombo-
embolism. A large-scale collaborative
prospective study is needed to confirm the
efficacy and safety of this one-step treat-
ment algorithm.
