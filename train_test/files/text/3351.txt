Introduction
Gender is mainly used conventionally to describe how the
society gives certain roles to boys and girls. Gender has to do
with behaviors that have become associated with masculinity
and feminity, and with how people see their roles as male or
female (Kauffman, 1997). Therefore, gender is related with
how individuals perceive themselves in such a way that most
people of the same sex identify themselves with certain attri-
butes. These attributes affect children as they develop.
Without doubt, the environment a child finds himself or her-
self in has a lot of impact on the child. According to Berk
(2010), girls and boys are treated differently at birth. Girls
are dressed with pink, and parents tend to be gentle with the
girl child. On the other hand, boys are dressed with blue
materials, while parents are harder with them. In the process
of treating children differently, girls are offered more sex-
stereotyped toys, and without doubt, these children grow up
looking and acting differently. This is in line with Kauchak
and Eggen (2011) who stated that male children are regarded
as handsome and seen as tougher and harder, and parents are
rougher with their sons and involve them in more physical
stimulation than their female children. It was along this
direction that the American Association of University
Women (AAUW; 2006) argued that the differential treatment
given to boys and girls by teachers and the society danger-
ously hampered the educational progress, self-esteem, and
career choices of girls. If this is so, there are the indications
that self-concept and academic achievement of male and
female children could be affected by stereotyping.According
to Aboud (1988) and Durkin (1995), stereotypic views may
reflect cognitive developmental changes and have impact on
the way children understand the meaning of categories, attri-
butes, and changes in role-taking skills. Therefore, stereo-
types testify individuals' orientation and past experiences,
which could manifest positively or negatively as individuals
interact with others within and outside their immediate
environment.
It is believed that stereotypic views might affect individu-
als' self-cognitive development, as well as their feelings,
actions, and attitudes. According to Allen (2000), stereotype

Impact of Gender Stereotype on
Secondary School Students'
Self-Concept and Academic Achievement
J. N. Igbo1, V. C. Onu1, and N. O. Obiyo1
Abstract
The aim of the study was to investigate the influence of gender stereotype as a predictor of secondary school students' self-
concept and academic achievement. The study was guided by four purposes, four research questions, and four hypotheses.
The study adopted ex post facto design. The research sample was drawn from eight government/public senior secondary
schools in Udi education zone. Nine schools were randomly selected from the 227 schools. A total of 342 senior secondary
II school (SSII) students made up the sample of the study. A 20-item students' stereotype self-concept questionnaire (SSSCQ)
was adapted from Marsh's Self Descriptive Questionnaire II (SDQII), and a 10-item students' mathematics achievement
test (SMAT) was developed by the researchers after reviewing related literature. This was done with the help of experts
in the areas. The instruments were face and content validated and used for the collection of data. In analyzing the data,
mean and standard deviation were used in answering the research questions while a t test was used in testing the four
hypotheses. The findings of the study indicate that gender stereotype has significant influence on students' self-concept and
academic achievement in favor of the male students. On the other hand, school location has significant influence on academic
achievement of students but has no significant influence on students' self-concept.

is associated with the development of beliefs concerning the
traits supposedly possessed by most members of a society. It
is an exaggerated belief that members of a group have certain
traits that are peculiar to them. This implies that the impact
of stereotype tends to change the individual's perception of
reality over a period of time. Stereotypes are widely held
beliefs about the character and behavior of all members of a
group. Stereotyping is the perception, clarification, and
assessment of social objects (events) on the basis of specific
notion (Ramalingam, 2006). A stereotype is a rigid, simplis-
tic caricature of a particular group of people, which in one
way or the other can affect individuals by limiting them on
their academic achievement (Kauchak & Eggen, 2011).
From this evidence, it is possible that stereotype might limit
children from pursuing their career choices. Stereotype
becomes a problem when forces in schools and the society
limit the academic potential of either male or female.
According to Francis and Skelton (2005) and Wessel (2005),
gender stereotypic views create negative influence on chil-
dren in their choice of career decision, and females are less
likely to study engineering and computer sciences than
males. Therefore, there are some indications that gender ste-
reotype can influence individuals' academic perceptions and
achievement.
Ryan andAdams (1999) developed a general model called
the "family school relationship" (FSR). They proposed that
those features of the child or family that have the most imme-
diate connection to school success will have the greatest
influence on school outcomes. The researchers used the FSR
model to show how family relationships affected the school
success of more than 4,300 boys and girls between the ages
of 6 and 11. The model showed that socio-economic back-
ground and stereotyping play a powerful role in the lives of
children and had affected many variables in the model.
According to the researchers, higher levels of students' ste-
reotyping lead directly to more positive or negative attitudes
toward school in children. Positive attitudes lead to higher
academic achievement, while negative attitudes lead to lower
academic achievement. Therefore, stereotyping is a very
important determinant of a wide range of social and psycho-
logical functioning of students.
According to Tajfel (1984) and Rutland (1999), stereo-
types are learned early in childhood through normal social-
ization instead of direct learning or experience. For Aboud
(1988) and Durkin (1995), stereotype influences cognitive
developmental changes of students and, in effect, affects the
way they understand the meaning of construct, attributes,
and change in role-taking. The implication is that, in the pro-
cess of these changes, the students' self-concept might be
affected. For G. N. Martin, Carlson, and Buskist (2007), ste-
reotype serves to justify a student's experiences and anticipa-
tions, and is a relatively positive or negative evaluation of
oneself. This means that a stereotype that categorized a par-
ticular group as ineffective, and dull, tends to manipulate that
group by implication. G. N. Martin et al. (2007) stated that
once individuals are categorized as members of a particular
group, the stereotype of that group influences the impression
of these individuals involved. For example, if parents and
teachers believe that females are not good in the sciences, the
tendency for the female students is to lose interest in sciences
to conform to that schema. Bargh (1989) is of the opinion
that stereotypes are relatively automatically activated in par-
ticular contexts based on the perception of people around.
For Steele (1997) and Aronson and Fried (2002), stereotype
has two repercussions: the anxiety about conforming to the
stereotype (i.e., acting to fulfill the stereotype) and disengag-
ing oneself from the stereotype. If this is so, definitely, the
individual self-concept will be affected either negatively or
positively depending on the situation the person finds him-
self or herself in. Psychologically, stereotyping affects both
males and females and makes them vulnerable toward that
direction. For Schmade (2002), the degree to which individ-
uals identify with relevant or irrelevant groups affects how
strongly the stereotype influences their performance and
achievement.
Self-concept is seen as the way individuals regularly
describe themselves in relation to their physical, social, emo-
tional, and psychological feelings. For G. N. Martin et al.
(2007), self-concept has to do with the individual's feelings,
knowledge of self, and ideas about self. This means that self-
concept is the totality of an individual and all that is peculiar
with the person. At the center of self-concept is one's self-
schema, which is a mental framework, a cognitive structure
that organizes individuals' emotions, knowledge, and ideas.
Social psychologists such as Markus and Nurius (1986), and
Higgins (1987) believe that self-concept has to do with indi-
viduals' possible selves. Therefore, one's self-concept plays
a lot of roles in the development of the person academically,
socially, and psychologically. Bem (1981) believes that
social impact on behaviors can affect the individual's self-
concept because individuals always learn about themselves
by observing how they behave. When students are stereo-
typed and work along the same view, it tends to affect them
from different dimensions. Rogers (1980) believes that the
core of one's personality is the self-concept of that individ-
ual. G. L. Martin and Osborne (1992) stated that individual
self-concept is the collection of beliefs, thoughts, and feel-
ings that individuals have about themselves. It is the indi-
vidual's self-image that is the way the person sees himself or
herself. Self-concept is seen as a general term that refers to
the wide range of one's self-descriptions made by individu-
als. Most of the individuals' self-descriptions have been
associated with rewards that are likely to elicit very positive
images and emotions. This implies that how individuals per-
ceive themselves in terms of the stereotypes eventually
affects the totality of their behavior. This is what the present
study has set out to address.
According to Demidenko, Tasca, Kennedy, and Bissada
(2010), self-concept contains three parts: self-esteem, stability,
and self-efficacy. Self-esteem is the evaluative component,
Igbo et al. 3
where one makes judgment about his or her self-worth. In
their views, stability refers to the organization and continuity
of one's self-concept. Self-efficacy is best explained as self-
confidence and is specifically connected to one's abilities. For
McGraw (2008), self-concept is a person's composite or col-
lective view of himself or herself across a multi-dimensional
set of specific precepts. It is based on self-knowledge and
evaluation or worth of a person's capabilities that one formed
through experience and interpretation of the environment.
McLead (2008) sees self-concept as how people think and
evaluate themselves. Self-concept is an internal model that
comprises self-assessment (Fleming & Courtney, 1994).
Features associated with self-concept include personality,
skills, abilities, occupations, hobbies, and physical character-
istics, among others. A person's self-concept may change with
time as reassessment occurs, which in some cases leads to
identity crises (Gerrig & Zimbardo, 2002). Self-concept is not
restricted to the present; it includes past selves and future
selves. The past self represents the activities and experiences
of the individual in previous occasions, while the future self
indicates one's proposals and intentions that have not been
accomplished. These correspond to hopes, fears, standards,
goals, and threats (Santrock, 2009). The present study hopes to
find out the impact of gender stereotype on students'self-con-
cept and academic achievement.
Tiedemann (2000) indicates that parents' gender stereo-
types and expectations for their children affect children's
understanding of themselves. Researchers believe that self-
concept develops later, around age 7 or 8, as children are
developmentally prepared to begin to interpret their own
feelings, abilities, and feedback they receive from parents,
teachers, and peers about themselves (Benner & Mistry,
2007). Despite differing opinions about the onset of self-
concept development, researchers agree on the importance of
one's self-concept. Self-concept influences people's behav-
iors, and cognitive and emotional outcome, including aca-
demic achievement, levels of happiness, anxiety, social
integration, self-esteem, and life satisfaction (Marsh &
Martin, 2011). It is observed that females are more extro-
verted, anxious, and trusting, and have lower self-concept
and self-esteem than their male counterparts (Berk, 2008,
2010). This can contribute to the gender differences that arise
between male and female children. In considering gender
stereotype, students' self-concept, and academic achieve-
ment, a demographic variable that mediates the students'
influence may include location. This has to do with whether
the school is located in urban or rural areas.
The emphasis on education and the amount of support
given to children varies from one locality to another. One of
the most important effects of geographical location is the dif-
ference between the educational conditions in the urban and
rural areas. Parents in the rural areas are on the average
poorer than those in the urban areas. Therefore, they are less
able to provide their children with school requirements and
end up withdrawing their female children from school to
enable them to cope with their financial obligations. Children
in the rural areas are not so much acquainted with mechani-
cal toys, amusement parks, electrical gadgets, books from
public libraries, newspapers and periodicals, cinema, televi-
sion, and film shows. These are known to enrich the educa-
tion of children in urban areas, and this may influence their
achievement and self-concept. In the present study, location
is perceived as a setting in which teaching and learning take
place such as school location. In other words, school location
is categorized into urban and rural areas. Location can affect
or influence learning, depending on the opportunities found
or available in a particular location (urban and rural). It
equally depends on the interest and emphasis on education,
based on the location that determines the academic achieve-
ment of children. According to Kauchak and Eggen (2011),
negative stereotypes about urban students create the impres-
sion that developing a productive learning environment,
through classroom management, is very difficult and seem
almost impossible for teachers. This implies that stereotyp-
ing in relation to location can equally affect the development
and academic achievement of children. Therefore, students
whose self-concepts are not strongly developed can equally
be affected by stereotypic views.
Academic achievement refers to the outcome of teaching
and learning acquired by individuals, more especially by stu-
dents. It is commonly measured by examination, test, or
assessment. To achieve is to gain by doing something suc-
cessful with an effort or skill. It is believed that academic
achievement concerns mental health. Achievement involves
the individuals'physical and intellectual skills, which lead to
satisfactory means of adjustment, social sensitivity, and ade-
quate self-concept. Academic achievement is based on the
degree of intellectual simulation that the child could receive
from learning situations. The student's gender stereotype and
location may play vital roles in his or her academic achieve-
ment. In a study carried out by Vescio, Gervais, Snyder, and
Hoover (2005) on stereotypes, the finding indicated that
powerful males use stereotypes to judge females. Stereotype
seems contextually relevant when emphasizing females'
weaknesses and strengths. For Steele, Spencer, and Aronson
(2002), underachievement is a psychological response to ste-
reotype that characterizes females as inferior to males on a
specific task such as mathematics in a school-specific
domain. Negative stereotype is a cognitive and emotional
burden that impedes performance and consistently yields
negative expectations (Martin et al., 2007).
Theoretical Framework
According to Bandura's (1977) social learning theory, human
behavior is a function of the person plus the environment. In
other words, the person, the behavior, and the environmental
situations are highly interrelated. Each is capable of influ-
encing the other. The theory assumes that when two persons
or groups interact, they become part of each other's
4 SAGE Open
environment. This means that school learning occurs as a
result of interactions of children and parents, children and
teachers, children and peers, and children and school envi-
ronment. The theory further holds that performance in school
learning is traceable to gender stereotype as it relates to the
learners. This may be explained on the ground that family
and school interactions may influence the child's perfor-
mance in school. Based on the assumption of the theory, the
social learning theory stipulates that academic dysfunction
sometimes arises from gender stereotype and location of the
student. This theory has a link with the present study as it has
highlighted a link between academic achievement and the
students' gender stereotype. The theory will therefore serve
as a guide to identify the elements of students'gender stereo-
type that may influence both academic performance and self-
concept with regard to teaching and learning in secondary
schools. The social learning initiated by Bandura (1977)
argues that learning is a product of the individual and the
environment. This implies that the interaction between a stu-
dent and the learning environment determines, to a certain
extent, the performance of the student in a given school sub-
ject. The environments include both the school environment
and the home environment, and other factors that are within
the environment such as stereotypic view, gender, location,
and individual's self-concept.
Review of Related Studies
Karim (1990) conducted a study on "Self-Concept: A Cross
Cultural Study of Adolescents." The sample consisted of 600
adolescents with age range of 13 to 19 years, and the area of
study was in America. Thakur and Prasada's self-esteem
inventory was used to measure self-concept of adolescents.
The results revealed that sex variation had a significant
impact on personality perception and self-concept. The
females possessed more positive self-concept in comparison
with the males. Furthermore, Patil (1994) carried out a study
on sex role perception of adolescents as influenced by self-
concept and achievement motivation. The sample consisted
of 360 adolescent boys and girls studying in 8th, 9th and 10th
standards with equal number of students from English and
Kannada medium schools of Hubli and Dharwad city. The
results revealed that sex role perception had significant posi-
tive relationship with self-concept. Ahmed (1998) carried
out a study to explore the difference in boys' and girls' aca-
demic achievements. The study was conducted on 120 stu-
dents belonging to the age group of 13 to 18 years studying
in coeducation English medium institutions confined to the
suburbs of Mumbai City in India. The instrument used for
data collection was Shafi's achievement motivation scale.
The findings revealed that influence of gender on achieve-
ment motivation was statistically not significant.
On the issue of the influence of gender on academic
achievement and self-concept, Francis and Skelton (2005)
explain that how students are encouraged or discouraged in
school subjects may be based on learning opportunities.
Male students tend to receive more encouragement in sci-
ences while females are nurtured more in arts. Gisela fur-
ther asserted that parents are often gender biased, and this
influences students' achievements. In a study carried out by
Gurian and Stevens (2007) on the minds of boys, the find-
ings, among others, indicated that boys receive both lower
grades and the majority of failing grades, and they drop out
of school 4 times more than girls. Boys are identified for
disciplinary infractions as much as 10 times more than
girls. This could be attributed to the orientation that chil-
dren acquired from their parents in the process of develop-
ment. According to Kauchak and Eggen (2011), the brains
of male and female children are wired differently for learn-
ing. Their findings indicate that the components of the brain
that focus on words and motor skills develop a year ahead
for girls than for boys, thus giving the female child oppor-
tunities and advantages in reading and performing small
motor tasks such as using pencils. In a similar study, Gurian
and Stevens (2007) found that emotional centers in the
brain are more advanced in female children, making them
calmer and more able to sit steady for longer periods in the
classroom situations than their male counterparts.
Consequently, there are greater opportunities for female
children to perform as much as the male children, if encour-
aged, and even better than their male counterparts. Devi
and Mayuri (2003) found that girls were superior to boys in
academic achievement.
In Nigeria, the issue of gender permeates different set-
tings. It was reported in "UN Appeal for Girls' Education"
(2006) that the African patriarchal societal view point favors
boys over girls because boys maintain the family lineage.
Research has shown that millions of girls do not have access
to school despite the efforts to reverse the situation. Okeke,
Nzewi, and Njoku (2008) identified child labor, poverty, lack
of sponsorship, quest for wealth, bereavement, truancy,
engagement of girls as house-helps as some of the militating
factors against girls'education in Nigeria. Above all, the sce-
narios presented above tend to indicate that there are con-
flicting research findings on the influence of gender and
location on both the achievement and self-concept of stu-
dents. This made this study focus on the influence of both
gender stereotype and school location on academic achieve-
ment and self-concept of students. Some of the studies
reviewed above did not look at the issue of self-concept and
academic achievement. The locations, vis-à-vis urban and
rural, were not reflected in most of the studies reviewed.
These are what the present study hopes to find out.
Generally, the major purpose of the study is to investigate
the influence of gender stereotype on students' self-concept
and academic achievement in senior secondary schools.
Specifically, the study intends to do the following:
1. Ascertain the influence of gender stereotype on
senior secondary school students' self-concept,
Igbo et al. 5
2. Ascertain the influence of gender stereotype on senior
secondary school students' academic achievement
3. Ascertain the influence of school location on senior
secondary school students' self-concept.
4. Determine the influence of school location on senior
secondary school students' academic achievement.
The following research questions guided the study:
Research Question 1: What is the influence of gender
stereotype on senior secondary school students'
self-concept?
Research Question 2: What is the influence of gender
stereotype on senior secondary school students' academic
achievement?
Research Question 3: What is the influence of school
location on senior secondary school students'
self-concept?
Research Question 4: What is the influence of school
location on senior secondary school students' academic
achievement?
The following null hypotheses were tested at the .05 level
of significance:
Null Hypothesis 1 (Ho
1
): Gender stereotype has no sig-
nificant influence on self-concept of senior secondary
school students.
Null Hypothesis 2 (Ho
2
): Gender stereotype has no sig-
nificant influence on academic achievement of senior sec-
ondary school students.
Null Hypothesis 3 (Ho
3
): Location has no significant
influence on self-concept of senior secondary school
students.
Null Hypothesis 4 (Ho
4
): Location has no significant
influence on academic achievement of senior secondary
school students.
Research Method
This study was carried out in Enugu state of Nigeria. Enugu
state has six educational zones. The zones are Awgu, Enugu,
Obollo-Afor, Agbani, Udi, and Nsukka. In all, there are 277
government-owned secondary schools or public secondary
schools. The researchers decided to choose Udi Education
Zone because it is one of the areas where preference has been
made on boys'education over girls. Besides, girls are always
encouraged to get married as early as possible.
The population of the study comprised all the 2013-2014
senior secondary class two (SSII) students with the popula-
tion of 3,303.
The ex post facto research design was adopted for this
study. Nworgu (2006) and Nwana (2003) noted that this
research design seeks to establish cause­effect relationships,
and the researchers have no control over the variables under
study and therefore cannot manipulate the variables. Ex
post facto research design is a method that can be applied
instead of an experiment, to test hypotheses about cause
and effect in situations where it is impossible to control or
manipulate the dependent variable or the independent vari-
able (Lord, 1973). It was noted that researchers can only
report what has happened and examine the data retrospec-
tively to establish causes, relationships and associations,
and their meanings (Cohen, Manion, & Morrison, 2011;
Punch, 2011). Both school location and student's gender
are variables that cannot be controlled by the researchers,
and so their influence on students' achievement and self-
concept were investigated.
Sampling Procedure
The researchers adopted multi-phase sample. This is one of
the probability sampling techniques in which every member
of the wider population has an equal chance of being selected
in the sample study. Inclusion or exclusion from the sample
is a matter of chance (Cohen et al., 2011). Besides, multi-
phase samples have less risk of bias.
A sample of 342 SSII students comprising 228 males
and 114 females made up the sample of the study. In sam-
pling, the researchers adapted the National Education
Association Technique in Krejcie and Morgan (1970) for
determining the sample size. This technique states that
when the population is between 3,000 and 3,500, the sam-
ple size should be between 341 and 346. Therefore, going
by the number, the 342 sample size falls within the range of
sampling. The locations of the schools were considered.
This means that the schools located in both urban and rural
areas were sampled and used for the study. Specifically, in
a multi-phase sample, the selection is done in phases, and
the purposes change at every particular phase. For the pur-
pose of this study, the selection was done on location of
school and gender bases. The multi-phase sampling tech-
nique was used in selecting the sample for the study. First,
the selection of one out of the six education zones in Enugu
State was done. Second, nine schools were selected: three
boys' schools, three girls' schools, and three coeducational
schools (for boys and girls). From each of the three boys'
schools, 56 boys were selected. From each of the girls'
schools, 27 girls were selected. In the three coeducational
schools, 60 males and 33 females were selected. Altogether,
there were 228 male and 114 female students who made up
the sample used for the study. These made up the total sam-
ple size of 342 SSII students. The choice of SSII students
was informed by the fact that the students fall within the
age range of middle adolescents, which corresponded with
the application of Marsh's Self Description Questionnaire
II [Strongly Disagree(SD)QII], which was adapted by the
researchers for the present study.
6 SAGE Open
Instrumentation
Two instruments were used in carrying out the study: Students'
Stereotype Self-Concept Questionnaire (SSSCQ) and Student
Mathematics Achievement Test (SMAT). SSSCQ was
adapted by the researchers after reviewing, extensively,
related literature. The researchers adapted Marsh's SDQII
from Marsh's Self Description Questionnaire (SDQ) for this
study. The instrument that was adapted for this study is
Marsh's SDQII. Marsh's SDQ was designed or developed by
Marsh (1988), and it is based on the Shavelson, Hubner, and
Stanton (1996) hierarchical and multi-dimensional model. It
is a multi-dimensional self-concept instrument that has been
extensively psychometrically validated. It is divided into
three versions. Version I (SDQI) is basically for primary
schools, and it is used to measure self-concept of the adoles-
cents. Version II (SDQ II) is for secondary schools and is
used for early to the middle adolescents. Neill (1991) noted
that the overall rating of SDQ II is 8/10. Version III (SDQ II)
is basically for late adolescents and young adults. Generally,
SDQ comprises 8 to 12 self-concept scales. The SDQ II,
which is the area of interest of the present study, specified
how students feel about themselves in 11 areas. These areas
include physical abilities, physical appearance, relations to
peers of the opposite sex, relations to peer of the same sex,
relations to parents, honesty, emotional stability, mathemati-
cal ability, academics in general, and global self-concept
(Wenglinsky, 1996). For the present study, the researchers
focused on 4 out of Marsh's 11 dimensions. These include
physical appearance, relations with parents, emotional stabil-
ity, and global self-concept. The areas that were eliminated
are not relevant to the present study, which focuses on gender
stereotype and self-concept. The SSSCQ was adapted basi-
cally from the four dimensions. The four scales that were
related to the present study were pulled together into one
scale. The researchers were able to abstract and modify
20-item statements to suit the present study. Four items were
taken from physical appearance and emotional stability,
respectively, while six items were abstracted from relations
with parents and another six from global self-concept. These
four scales that were related to the present study were pulled
together into one scale. In structuring the item statements,
the following levels were applied: strongly agree (SA), 4
points; agree (A), 3 points; disagree (D), 2 points; and
strongly disagree (SD), 1 point.
SMAT was the second instrument used by the researchers.
The instrument was developed by the researchers with the
help of two qualified mathematics teachers in senior second-
ary schools and a professional from the department of sci-
ence education (mathematics education). This was done after
the review of relevant literature. The instrument was a
10-item statements which were generated from three content
areas of SSII mathematics syllabus which include probabil-
ity, sequence, and trigonometry. In developing the instru-
ment, the researchers used test blue print as a guide. The
objectives of the contents were considered. The questions in
the three content areas were classified into two: lower and
higher order questions. A four-point rating scale ranging
from SA = 4, A = 3, D = 2, and SD = 1 was adopted. Any
response with a mean score of 2.5 and above was considered
as "agree" or acceptable while responses below the mean
score of 2.5 were considered as "disagree" or not accepted.
Validity and Reliability
The students' stereotype self-concept questionnaire was face
validated by three experts, from educational psychology,
special education, and measurement and evaluation. The
experts' suggestions were used in improving the instrument.
The SMAT was equally face and content validated. The face
validation was done by three experts; two teachers from
senior secondary school and one from the department of sci-
ence education (mathematics education). The experts' views
helped in adjusting the instrument. For content validation,
the table of specification according to Bloom's (1956)
Taxonomy of Educational Objectives was used. The instru-
ment was validated based on the purpose of the study,
research questions, and the hypotheses. The experts were
asked to check the language used in constructing the ques-
tionnaire, and to clarify the adequacy of the items and the
relevance of the instrument to the topic of the study. The cor-
rections were effected based on the suggestions made by the
experts.
To ascertain the reliability of the instruments, 20 copies of
the students' stereotype self-concept questionnaire and 20
copies of the Mathematics Achievement Test were subjected
to trial testing in four secondary schools in Owerri North
Local Government Areas in Imo State, which is not part of
the study area. Cronbach's alpha procedure was used to esti-
mate the internal consistency of the instruments, and reliabil-
ity coefficients of 0.82 and 0.78 were obtained from Students'
Stereotype Self-Concept Questionnaire and Mathematics
Achievement Test, respectively. In analyzing the data, means
and standard deviations were used for the research questions,
while t-test statistic was applied in testing the hypotheses to
generalize findings from the data.
Results and Discussion
Research Question 1
What is the influence of gender stereotype on secondary
school students' self-concept?
The results presented in Table 1 shows that the mean
response of male students on self-concept was 3.20, with a
standard deviation of 0.25, and a mean of 2.85 with a stan-
dard deviation of 0.29 for female students. The difference
between the mean response of male and female students was
0.35. This indicates that gender stereotype appears to have
some influence on male and female students' self-concept.

The result presented in Table 2 shows that mean achieve-
ment score of male students on mathematics was 74.48 with
a standard deviation of 7.27, and a mean of 71.80 with a stan-
dard deviation of 9.62 for female students. The difference
between the mean response of male and female students was
2.68. This indicates that gender stereotype seems to have
some influence on male and female students' academic
achievement.

standard deviation of 0.36 for rural-based students. The differ-
ence between the mean response of urban and rural students
was 0.06. This indicates that school location appears to have
similar influence on urban and rural students' self-concept.

Discussion
Generally, the research question that guided the study focused
on the influence of gender stereotype in relation to academic
achievement and self-concept of students. The results of the
study confirmed the suspicion the researchers had, that is, the
possibility of gender stereotypic views of parents and teachers
encouraging male children with particular courses and dis-
couraging female children in the same courses, thus influenc-
ing their academic achievement. In the long term, this might
equally affect their self-concept. This is in line with Steele et
al. (2002), who found that stereotypic views manifest under-
achievement on the part of females and affect their self-con-
cept. The findings also corroborate the findings of Vescio et al.
(2005) who found that powerful application of stereotype is
related to female weaknesses and strengths. Therefore, the use
of stereotypic views could be responsible for the manifestation
of male and female achievements in mathematics. It could
have equally affected their self-concept.
However, the influence of location on the academic
achievement of students is in favor of those in urban areas.
This could be attributed to the network of opportunities that
are easily found in urban areas. In most rural areas, there is no
rural electrification, and this makes it impossible for children
in rural areas to study beyond the knowledge information
acquired from their parents and classroom teachers. The pos-
sible academic superiority achieved by children in the urban
areas may also be due to the exposure to extra classes that are
not usually available to the children in rural areas. In line with
this, Mangal (2010) found that environmental or location
forces, especially the home, neighborhood, and school atmo-
sphere, significantly influence the educational attainment of
students. Another possible factor could be as a result of pov-
erty, which creates opportunities for withdrawing the female
children from school, while allowing their male counterparts
to continue. This is in line with Okeke et al. (2008), who iden-
tified the poor performance of female students as partly a
result of engaging the girls as "house helps" and child labor-
ers, and thus withdrawing the girl child from school as a result
of poverty. For Mangal (2010), girls are left to perform mostly
as domestic workers. Therefore, in the process of helping out
with many household chores or to augment the family income,
female children devote less time to their studies, creating
opportunities for poor academic achievement. When a child
is withdrawn from school for a long time, meeting up with
others in the same class becomes almost impossible for the
withdrawn child.
It has also been found that there is little difference in the
mean self-concept for the students from urban school and
those from the rural schools. The mean self-concept of those
from the urban school is higher than that of students from
rural schools. The analysis of the mean differences in loca-
tion with regard to self-concept indicates that location has no
significant influence on the students' self-concept. This
agrees with the findings of Karim (1990), who observed that
a significant difference exists between urban and rural stu-
dents' self-concept. Students from rural areas had higher
self-concept than students from urban areas. The study also
revealed that there is difference in the mean achievement
scores for the students from urban schools and those from
rural schools. The mean achievement of those from the urban
schools is higher than those in the rural schools. The analysis
of the mean shows that location has no significant influence
on academic achievement. The findings are in line with the
assertion of Karim (1990), who found that children in the
rural areas are not so much acquainted with mechanical toys,
amusement parks, electrical gadgets, books from public
library, newspapers and periodicals, television, and film
shows. These are known to enrich the education of children
in urban areas and thus may influence their achievement. The
study also revealed that male students have higher mean self-
concept than their female counterparts. The analysis of the
mean shows that there is no significant influence of gender
on self-concept. This is in line with the finding of Steele et al.

(2002). Furthermore, it was revealed that female students
have higher mean achievement scores than their male coun-
terparts. The analysis of the mean shows that gender has no
significant influence on students' academic achievement.
In relation to Bandura's (1977) social learning theory, it is
evident that human beings are "social animals," and this can
affect them positively or negatively depending on the stereo-
typic view, which individuals are brought up with. Individuals
learn by modeling, and one can only model what he or she
has come across. This could affect the self-concept and aca-
demic achievement based on gender stereotype that manifest
within the individual environments. This is in line with
Vescio,Gervais,Snyder and Hoover(2005) findings that pow-
erful or very strong stereotyping is related to students'low or
high self-concept and poor or high academic achievements.
Conclusion
The findings of this study show that gender stereotypic views
have facilitative influence on secondary school students'self-
concept and academic achievement. Stereotype is a general-
ization that has to do with the characteristics of a group of
people. It is usually known for segregation between one group
of people and the other showing superiority over one group
against the other. G. N. Martin et al. (2007) noted that stereo-
typing members of a group negatively may pose a cognitive
and emotional burden that can impede performance and con-
sistently yield negative expectations. From the findings, gen-
der stereotype has, as a result, denied female students the
right and privileges they should have enjoyed. Rather, it has
led to poor academic achievement. Self-concept is the collec-
tion of one's self-image, feelings or emotions, and beliefs. It
is the way individuals perceive themselves, which includes
their past and present experiences. All these, put together,
affect individuals positively or negatively, depending on the
angle the stereotyping individuals found themselves.
Generally, the results revealed that gender stereotype has sig-
nificant influence on academic achievement of students. The
conclusion from the findings indicated that both self-concept
and location have no significant influence on the students.
Limitations of the Study
Usually, no study goes without some limitations. The follow-
ing were observed by the researchers as limitations to the
present study:
·
· The study focused on public or government schools,
to the exclusion of private schools run by individuals
and religious organizations. This may have conse-
quences for the generalization of the findings.
·
· The study was conducted in Enugu State, which is 1
of the 36 states in Nigeria. Perhaps using 2 or 3 more
states in the country may be better so as to broaden the
scope of the study.
In spite of these limitations, the findings strongly indicate
that gender stereotyping made a difference in self-concept
and academic achievement among secondary school students
in favor of the male students.
