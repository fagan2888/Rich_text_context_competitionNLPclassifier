Introduction
Considerable research has investigated the association
between personality and physical health (see Hampson and
Friedman, 2008). However, very little research has investi-
gated this association in a bereaved sample. It is imperative to
extend this line of research to include bereaved samples
because (a) bereavement can negatively impact health
(Stroebe et al., 2007), (b) personality influences how indi-
viduals cope with stressors (Carver and Connor-Smith, 2010),
(c) personality influences how individuals recall and describe
their bereavement experiences (Baddeley and Singer, 2008),
and (d) personality influences who seeks out social support
when experiencing stressors (Connor-Smith and Flachsbart,
2007). Although some research suggests that social support
may be a buffer against the negative outcomes associated
with bereavement, other studies have not found support for
these associations (Lund et al., 2010; Stroebe et al., 2005). It
is possible that these studies have failed to take into account
negative social exchanges, which are aversive exchanges
individuals receive from members of their social network
(Brooks and Dunkel Schetter, 2011), that have been shown to
negatively influence physical health (Hill et al., 2014;
Newsom et al., 2005). Thus, this study focused on whether
the association between personality and physical health
among non-bereaved samples could be replicated within a
bereaved sample and whether negative social exchanges
might be associated with self-reported health in the sample.
Bereavement and health
Bereaved individuals have an increased risk of morbidity and
mortality (Jones et al., 2010; Stroebe et al., 2001b, 2007),
especially within the first few months after the death of a loved
one (Roelfs et al., 2012). These increased risks are the result of
bereaved individuals' grief, which is the reaction to the death
of a loved one. These reactions can include psychological and
physiological components, which may increase vulnerability
to premature death through increased susceptibility to disease
or suicide (Roelfs et al., 2012; Stroebe et al., 2001a, 2007).
Research has found that bereaved individuals perceive
their health to be poorer than their same-aged non-bereaved
counterparts (Stroebe et al., 2007). They report somatic
complaints more frequently, exhibit increased use of

Abstract
While much research has investigated the association between personality and health, little research has done so using a
bereaved sample. Additionally, little research has investigated how personality influences the frequency of negative social
exchanges bereaved individuals receive. This study utilized a structural equation model to investigate the associations
among age, gender, personality, negative social exchanges, length of bereavement, and self-reported physical health in a
sample of bereaved adults. Results indicated that personality was associated with negative social exchanges and physical
health. Therefore, these variables are important and should be studied further in this context.

medical services, experience disability at higher rates,
begin new and increase current medication use, and are
hospitalized more often than their non-bereaved counter-
parts. They are also 1.4 times more likely to report a new or
worsened illness affecting the endocrine, immune, cardio-
vascular, gastrointestinal, or musculoskeletal systems
(Gerra et al., 2003; Stroebe et al., 2007).
While much of the above research has emphasized the
negative outcomes associated with bereavement, it is
important to note that research has found great variability
(e.g. Boerner et al., 2005; Bonanno, 2004; Newson et al.,
2011). Although bereavement can have a strong negative
impact on individuals, there are many individuals who
endure this potentially stressful experience quite well,
showing little or no response. Given this variability,
research has focused on identifying resources or factors
that might differentiate between those individuals who
adjust well after the death of a loved one and those who do
not. One potentially fruitful area is the association between
personality and bereavement.
Personality, grief, and coping styles
Personality is the enduring thoughts, feelings, and emo-
tions that are specific to the individual. Personality can be
defined in many ways; however, the most prominent trait
theory in personality is the five-factor model (Lodi-Smith
et al., 2011), which organizes personality into five super-
factor models: neuroticism, conscientiousness, extraver-
sion, agreeableness, and openness to experience. Research
indicates that personality influences the intensity of grief
individuals' experience. Specifically, bereaved mothers
who were higher in neuroticism reported higher levels of
grief intensity (i.e. higher levels of emotional and physical
distress; Robinson and Marwit, 2006). Furthermore,
bereaved parents who were higher in neuroticism reported
higher levels of grief (Wijngaards-de Meij et al., 2007).
Personality also influences the types of coping styles
individuals engage in when experiencing a stressor.
Individuals who are higher in neuroticism report engaging
in not only less task-oriented coping (i.e. attempting to
change the stressful situation) but also more avoidance-
oriented coping (i.e. seeking out distractions) and problem-
atic emotion-oriented coping (i.e. minimizing the distress
by expressing negative emotions; Connor-Smith and
Flachsbart, 2007; Robinson and Marwit, 2006). Individuals
who are higher in extraversion report engaging in more
task-oriented coping and avoidance-oriented coping, while
they also report engaging in less emotion-oriented coping
(Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007; Robinson and
Marwit, 2006). Individuals who are higher in conscien-
tiousness report engaging in more task-oriented coping
(Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007). Research indicates
that personality has a stronger influence on coping styles as
the stressor becomes more acute (Connor-Smith and
Flachsbart, 2007). Thus, personality plays an influential
role when it comes to how individuals cope with stressors,
especially a stressor such as the death of a loved one.
Personality and health
In addition to coping styles, personality influences physical
health. There are many theoretical models that describe the
mechanisms that account for the association between per-
sonality and health (Smith, 2006). One influential theoreti-
cal model is the health behavior model, which states that
individuals who endorse higher levels of specific personal-
ity traits do or do not engage in specific health-promoting
or health-risk behaviors, which can lead to illness. The fol-
lowing paragraphs attempt to condense this abundant litera-
ture (see Friedman and Kern, 2014; Hampson and Friedman,
2008; Kern and Friedman, 2011 for a detailed discussion of
personality and health).
Studies that have examined conscientiousness effects on
health have found consistent results in which higher levels
of conscientiousness are beneficial to health (Kern and
Friedman, 2011). Specifically, individuals who are higher
in conscientiousness engage in fewer health-risk behaviors
(e.g. alcohol use, tobacco use, other substance use, and
risky driving) while they engage in more health-promoting
behaviors (e.g. physical activity, healthy eating, and well-
ness maintenance such as visiting a doctor) relative to those
lower in conscientiousness (Atherton et al., 2014; Bogg and
Roberts, 2004; Lodi-Smith et al., 2010). As such, individu-
als who are higher in conscientiousness have fewer physi-
cal limitations (Goodwin and Friedman, 2006).
Neuroticism exhibits a strong negative association with
physical health (Taga et al., 2009). Individuals who are
higher in neuroticism engage in health-risk behaviors, such
as alcohol or tobacco use. These individuals also engage in
fewer health-promoting behaviors compared to those lower
in neuroticism (Berg et al., 2007; Turiano et al., 2012).
Thus, individuals who are higher in neuroticism experience
more physical limitations, report more medical problems,
and report poorer general health (Atherton et al., 2014;
Goodwin and Friedman, 2006; Jerram and Coleman, 1999).
Research has found a positive association between agree-
ableness and self-reported physical health (Atherton et al.,
2014; Jerram and Coleman, 1999). Individuals who are
higher in agreeableness report better general health, better
physical functioning, and fewer medical problems relative to
those lower in agreeableness (Atherton et al., 2014; Jerram
and Coleman, 1999). Gender has been found to moderate the
association between agreeableness and self-reported physi-
cal health: agreeableness may be a stronger predictor of
physical health for males, while neuroticism may be a
stronger predictor for females (Friedman et al., 2010).
Extraversion has shown mixed results in the literature.
Individuals who are higher in extraversion engage in more
health-promoting behaviors relative to those who are lower in
Silva et al. 3
extraversion (Atherton et al., 2014; Jerram and Coleman,
1999). They also report better physical functioning and general
health. However, individuals who are higher in extraversion are
more likely to engage in substance use (Atherton et al., 2014).
Openness to experience has been the least studied trait
with regard to health (Taga et al., 2009), and when included
in research, results are mixed (Eldesousky, 2013; Goodwin
and Friedman, 2006). Higher levels of openness to experi-
ence have been associated with better self-reported physi-
cal functioning and perceived general health (Jerram and
Coleman, 1999). However, when paired with higher levels
of neuroticism and lower levels of conscientiousness,
higher levels of openness to experience have been associ-
ated with tobacco and illegal drug use (Turiano et al., 2012).
Personality, bereavement, and social support
In addition to health, personality influences how bereaved
individuals describe their experiences with bereavement.
While examining bereavement narratives, Baddeley and
Singer (2008) found that bereaved individuals who were
higher in conscientiousness told shorter stories and made
more references to death relative to individuals who were
lower in conscientiousness. Bereaved individuals who were
higher in neuroticism were more likely to reference them-
selves in their stories. Thus, personality influences how
bereaved individuals recall and share their experiences, which
may influence the frequency and amount of social support
bereaved individuals receive. In fact, research has suggested
that individuals who were higher in extraversion were more
likely to share their bereavement narratives to get closer to
someone or to gain comfort or support from others (Baddeley
and Singer, 2008; Connor-Smith and Flachsbart, 2007).
With regard to social support, there is a long-held
assumption that it is an important tool in overcoming grief;
however, there is limited empirical support for this assump-
tion. While some research suggests that social support buff-
ers against depressed moods and maintain positive moods
among bereaved individuals (e.g. Lund et al., 2010; Van der
Houwen et al., 2010), other studies have found limited evi-
dence for this. Krause (1986) found that social support was
associated with a decrease in somatic symptoms but it was
not associated with sadness or loneliness. Other studies
also have found little or no evidence for this position among
a variety of samples (e.g. Murphy, 1988; Murphy et al.,
2002; Stroebe et al., 1996). It is possible that these studies
failed to account for the dark side of social support, specifi-
cally, negative social exchanges.
Negative social exchanges, health, and
personality
Research indicates that relationships and exchanges among
members of the social network are not uniformly positive
(Chogahara, 1999; Rook, 1984). Social network members
may not help when called upon or may engage in behaviors
that they perceive to be helpful, but are not. These
exchanges, which are termed negative social exchanges,
have been shown to be conceptually and empirically dis-
tinct from social support or positive social exchanges
(Okun and Keith, 1998). They consist of the undesirable
and aversive exchanges individuals receive from members
of their social network and include neglect, interference,
rejection, conflict, insensitivity, and unwanted advice
(Brooks and Dunkel Schetter, 2011; Newsom et al., 2005;
Rook, 1998).
Research indicates that negative social exchanges nega-
tively influence health. Strain from the social network (i.e.
negative social exchanges from partner, family, or friends)
has been associated with health problems (Walen and
Lachman, 2000), while it also accounted for the greatest
amount of variance in physical symptoms when compared
to daily hassles, social support, and life events (Edwards
et al., 2001). Recent analyses from the Health and
Retirement Study demonstrate that negative social
exchanges from friends and family are particularly power-
ful predictors of the onset of new chronic health conditions
(Hill et al., 2014). The association between negative social
exchanges and physical health is also evident in longitudi-
nal studies. Newsom et al. (2008) examined participants'
self-rated health, functional limitations, health conditions,
and frequency of negative social exchanges experienced
over the course of 2years. Results indicated that increases
in negative social exchanges were associated with poorer
self-rated health after controlling for baseline self-rated
health, race, gender, age, education, and income. Also,
increases in negative social exchanges were associated with
more health conditions after controlling for baseline health
conditions, race, gender, age, education, and income. Thus,
negative social exchanges influence physical health above
and beyond influential variables.
Research suggests that individual characteristics influ-
ence the frequency with which individuals experience neg-
ative social exchanges. Research indicates that females are
more likely to report and experience negative social
exchanges due to the social roles they endorse (e.g. being
more relationship-oriented) compared to men (Beals and
Rook, 2006; Edwards et al., 2001). In addition, theory sug-
gests that negative social exchanges should decrease with
age. According to the socioemotional selectivity theory,
older adults prune negative social network members from
their networks (Carstensen, 1992), thus reducing the fre-
quency they experience negative social exchanges.
It is important to understand whether other individual
characteristics, such as personality, influence the frequency
with which individuals experience negative social
exchanges. Research conducted by Caspi et al. (1987) indi-
cates that individuals' behavior predisposes them to envi-
ronments that reinforces the behaviors (i.e. cumulative
continuity) and that these behaviors also elicit responses
4 Health Psychology Open 
from the social network members, in which further elicits
behaviors from the individuals (i.e. interactional continu-
ity). As such, it is possible that individuals who are higher
or lower on certain personality traits are more likely to
elicit negative social exchanges from their social network
in comparison with individuals who are not higher or lower
on those traits. It is also possible that individuals place
themselves in environments that strengthen their personal-
ity characteristics, which increases or decreases the nega-
tive social exchanges they receive.
However, the association between personality and nega-
tive social exchanges has not been examined in detail.
Results from a limited number of studies indicate that indi-
viduals who are higher in neuroticism or extraversion expe-
rience more interpersonal conflicts with friends and spouses
(Asendorpf and Wilpers, 1998; Bolger and Zuckerman,
1995; Iveniuk et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2012; Sturaro et al.,
2008). Furthermore, individuals who are higher in neuroti-
cism are more likely to respond to those conflicts with
anger (Bolger and Zuckerman, 1995). In comparison, indi-
viduals who are higher in conscientiousness, agreeable-
ness, or emotional stability (i.e. lower in neuroticism)
report experiencing lower levels of conflict with their par-
ents and friends (Neyer and Lehnart, 2007; Parker et al.,
2012; Sturaro et al., 2008). In addition, it is thought that
individuals who are higher in openness experience a reduc-
tion in conflict (McCrae and Sutin, 2009). Thus, it is
important to examine whether personality is associated
with negative social exchanges in a bereaved sample as
these individuals may be in great need of and be in frequent
contact with their social networks.
The current study
Due to the unique circumstances surrounding bereavement
as discussed previously (e.g. bereavement negatively
impacting health), this study was conducted to examine
whether the association between personality and physical
health could be replicated within a bereaved sample.
Furthermore, this study was conducted to examine whether
personality influences the frequency with which bereaved
individuals report experiencing negative social exchanges
and whether these exchanges influence self-reported physi-
cal health in a sample of 783 bereaved adults.
Hypotheses
Within a structural equation model (see Figure 1), this
study examined the (a) association between personality
and self-reported physical health; (b) association
between personality and negative social exchanges; (c)
association between negative social exchanges and self-
reported physical health; (d) associations among length
of bereavement, age, and gender with negative social

exchanges; (e) associations among length of bereave-
ment, age, and gender with self-reported physical health.
Based on the previous literature, it was hypothesized
that (a) neuroticism, age, and negative social exchanges
would be negatively associated with self-reported physical
health; (b) conscientiousness, agreeableness, and length of
bereavement would be positively associated with self-
reported physical health; (c) neuroticism, extraversion, and
being female would be positively associated with negative
social exchanges; and (d) conscientiousness, agreeable-
ness, and age would be negatively associated with negative
social exchanges.
Method
Participants
Participants were recruited using Amazon Mechanical
Turk, an online survey tool. Research has shown that
recruiting participants from Amazon Mechanical Turk is
similar to other online and convenience sampling methods
(Paolacci et al., 2010). Participants received US$2 for com-
pleting the questionnaire, which was approved by the
Institutional Review Board. In order to detect response sets
and other survey-taking concerns, participants were
required to correctly answer three out of four validity check
questions. These checks consisted of directions such as
"For this question, please answer some or little of the time,"
which were placed throughout the questionnaire.
Participants who did not answer the majority of the validity
checks correctly were excluded from the analyses.
Initially, 980 participants completed the survey. In all,
56 participants were excluded as a result of failing the
validity check questions, 1 was excluded as a result of
response setting, 42 were excluded due to never having
experienced bereavement, while 86 participants were
removed due to excessive (30+%) missing data. An addi-
tional 12 participants were excluded due to being multivari-
ate outliers.
Thus, our final sample included 783 participants between
the ages of 18 and 82 (M age

years. Of these participants, 445 (56.8%)
were female. Most of the participants self-identified as
Caucasian (77.1%), although 8.4
percent were African
American or Black, 6.4
percent were Asian­Pacific
Islander, 5.2
percent were Hispanic, 2.4
percent reported
other racial affiliations, and 0.4
percent did not specify a
race. Additional sample characteristics are given in Table 1.
Participants reported experiencing the death of grandpar-
ents (19.4%), parents (8.6%), friends (8.2%), aunts or
uncles (5.4%), siblings (2.8%), cousins (1.7%), grandchil-
dren (1.5%), spouses or partners (1.2%), in-laws (0.9%),
children (0.5%), and nieces or nephews (0.5%), while
49.3
percent of the sample did not indicate their relation-
ship to the deceased person. Additional bereavement char-
acteristics are given in Table 2.

The Midlife Development Inventory Personality Scales.Partici-
pants indicated how well 30 adjectives (e.g. organized,
forceful, and calm) described themselves (Lachman and
Weaver, 1997). These adjectives correspond to the person-
ality traits of agency (five items, =.76), neuroticism (four
items, =.77), extraversion (five items, =.81), openness
to experience (seven items, =.81), conscientiousness
(four items, =.74), and agreeableness (five items, =.86).
Because we were interested in the five-factor model, agency
was not included in the analyses. Responses to the adjec-
tives could range from 1 (a lot) to 4 (not at all). Personality
traits were scored by reverse coding responses when appli-
cable and averaging the responses in which a higher score
reflects greater endorsement of the personality trait.
Physical health.Subscales of the Short Form 12 (SF-12;
Ware et al., 1996) were used to index self-reported physical
health. The two-item physical role functioning scale
(=.77), the one-item bodily pain scale, and the two-item
physical functioning subscale (=.71) were included in the
analyses.
Negative social exchanges. Participants indicated how often
they experienced four different types of negative social
exchanges in the past year. Responses could range from 1
(never) to 5 (very often) and included receiving unwanted
advice (i.e. informational negative social exchange), being
let down when help was needed (i.e. instrumental negative
social exchange), being forgotten or ignored (i.e. compan-
ionship negative social exchange), and experiencing criti-
cism about personal concerns (i.e. emotional negative
social exchange).
Analytic strategy
In order to test the associations shown in Figure 1, our
preliminary strategy included examining the patterns of
correlations (see Table 3). Next, we used AMOS to simul-
taneously test the measurement and structural models. For
the measurement model, two latent variables were cre-
ated, which were labeled negative social exchanges and
self-reported physical health. Four indicators (i.e. infor-
mational, instrumental, companionship, and emotional
negative social exchanges) were used for the latent varia-
ble of negative social exchanges while three indicators
(i.e. physical role functioning, bodily pain, and physical
functioning) were used for the latent variable of self-
reported physical health. Once the structural equation
model was analyzed, multigroup analyses were conducted
to test whether the associations among the variables
differed for males and females and whether it differed for
individuals who were recently bereaved (i.e. experienced
bereavement less than 2
years) and those who were not
recently bereaved (i.e. experienced bereavement more
than 2
years) due to differential effects of gender and
length of bereavement in previous literature (e.g. Friedman
et al., 2010; Roelfs et al., 2012).
Results
The measurement model and structural equation model
shown in Figure 1 were tested simultaneously using full
information maximum likelihood estimation. Results indi-
cated an adequate fit to the data, 2(71)=241.23, p<.001,
R2=.229, the discrepancy function (CMIN/df)=3.39,
Comparative Fit Index (CFI)=.951, root mean square error
of approximation (RMSEA)
=
.055. Personality, age, gen-
der, and length of bereavement accounted for 15.7percent
of the variance in negative social exchanges, while person-
ality, age, gender, length of bereavement, and negative
social exchanges accounted for 22.9percent of the variance
in self-reported physical health (see Figure 2 and Table 4).
Results indicated that individuals who were female
(
=
.15), those higher in openness to experience
(
=
.09), and those higher in neuroticism (=.29)
reported more negative social exchanges, while indi-
viduals who were older (
=
-.07) and those higher in
conscientiousness (
=
-.12) reported fewer negative
social exchanges. Agreeableness, extraversion, and
length of bereavement were not significantly associated
with negative social exchanges.
Results also indicated that individuals who were older
(
=
-.31), those higher in agreeableness (=-.12), and
those higher in neuroticism (=-.15) reported poorer
physical health, while individuals who were higher in
conscientiousness (=.11) reported better physical health.
Furthermore, individuals who reported more negative
social exchanges (
=
-.23) reported poorer physical
health. Openness to experience, extraversion, length of
bereavement, and gender were not associated with self-
reported physical health. Indirect effects were examined,
and results indicated that negative social exchanges did
not mediate the association between personality and self-
reported physical health.
Next, we examined whether the strength of these asso-
ciations were equivalent across men and women. We con-
ducted multigroup analyses, using gender as the grouping
variable. Personality, length of bereavement, and age
accounted for 12.8percent of the variance in negative social
exchanges for females and 18.4
percent of the variance in
negative social exchanges for males. Personality, length of
bereavement, age, and negative social exchanges accounted
for 19.7
percent of the variance in self-reported physical
health for females and 26.3percent of the variance in self-
reported physical health for males. The structural weights

for males and females did not significantly differ (model
comparison: 2(20)=24.27, p>.05; see Supplemental
Tables 1 and 2 [available at: http://hpo.sagepub.com/]).
Next, we examined whether the strength of these asso-
ciations was equivalent across participants who were
recently bereaved (i.e. experienced bereavement less
than 2years) and those who were not recently bereaved
(i.e. experienced bereavement more than 2
years). We
conducted multigroup analyses, using length of bereave-
ment as the grouping variable. Personality, gender, and
age accounted for 13.1
percent of the variance in those
recently bereaved and 18.8
percent of the variance in
those not recently bereaved. Personality, gender, age, and
negative social exchanges accounted for 27.7percent of
the variance in self-reported physical health for those
recently bereaved and 20.1percent of the variance in self-
reported physical health for those not recently bereaved.
The structural weights for males and females did signifi-
cantly differ (model comparison: 2(12)=24.35, p<.05;
see Tables 5 and 6).
Discussion
While the association between personality and physical
health has been the frequent topics of the study (Hampson
and Friedman, 2008), little is known regarding whether the
association can be replicated among bereaved individuals.
It is important to examine whether the association is main-
tained given research indicating that bereavement nega-
tively influences physical health (e.g. Stroebe et al., 2007).
In addition, it is important to examine whether bereaved
individuals' personality influences the types of interactions
they receive from members of their social network given
the fact that bereaved individuals may have more contact
with their network after the death of a loved one. Thus, this
study was designed to determine whether personality influ-
enced the frequency of negative social exchanges and self-
reported physical health in a bereaved sample.
Self-reported physical health
In our bereaved sample, findings regarding the associa-
tion between personality and self-reported physical health
were somewhat similar to those found using non-bereaved
samples. Based on prior research (e.g. Atherton et al.,
2014; Berg et al., 2007; Jerram and Coleman, 1999), it
was hypothesized that neuroticism would be negatively
associated with self-reported physical health, while con-
scientiousness and agreeableness would be positively
associated with self-reported physical health. Our

predictions regarding neuroticism and conscientiousness
were supported; however, our findings contradicted previ-
ous research with regard to agreeableness and physical
health. Perhaps, our bereaved individuals who were higher
in agreeableness were also more open, cooperative regard-
ing how they felt, or more likely to conform to unhealthy
social pressure, which could lead to poorer self-reported
physical health.
Based on previous research (e.g. Roelfs et al., 2012),
we predicted that age and length of bereavement would be
negatively and positively associated with self-reported
physical health, respectively. Our prediction regarding
age was supported while length of bereavement was not.
One potential cause of this non-significant finding may be
the method of measuring length of bereavement. Instead
of measuring length of bereavement as a continuous vari-
able, this study examined length of bereavement as a cat-
egorical variable. In addition, individuals who had
experienced the death of loved one more than 2years prior
to the study were assigned to the same category. This con-
ceptualization of length of bereavement may have masked
the association between length of bereavement and self-
reported physical health.
Another potential reason may be the fact that our predic-
tion was based on research that emphasizes time since
death. Other bereavement research has found that the
amount of time that has passed since the death of a loved
one may only impact a subset of bereaved individuals.
Researches emphasizing psychological outcomes after the
death of a loved one have investigated different trajectories
of grief (e.g. Boerner et al., 2005; Bonanno, 2004; Newson
et al., 2011). While the number of specific trajectories var-
ies, the data suggest that half of bereaved individuals show
no grief response or show a very small response before
immediately returning to their baseline. Additionally, a
subset of bereaved individuals (10%­20% depending on
the study) may experience chronic or complicated grief,
where the individuals show high levels of symptoms that

do not appear to change much over extended periods of
time. These results suggest that the majority of bereaved
individuals would not show differences or changes over
time, which would limit the length of bereavement's pre-
dictive ability in a statistical analysis.
Negative social exchanges
Based on previous research (e.g. Bolger and Zuckerman,
1995; Iveniuk et al., 2014; Parker et al., 2012), it was
hypothesized that neuroticism and extraversion would be
positively associated with negative social exchanges, while
conscientiousness and agreeableness would be negatively
associated with negative social exchanges. Our findings
regarding neuroticism and conscientiousness supported
those predictions while our findings regarding extraversion
and agreeableness did not. It is possible that our bereaved
individuals who were higher in extraversion endorsed the
trait of friendly greater than the other traits that constitute
extraversion. Furthermore, it is possible that our bereaved
individuals who were higher in agreeableness were more
likely to engage in social network members' requests.
While we did not make an a priori prediction regarding
the association between openness to experience and nega-
tive social exchanges, we found a small but significant
positive association. It is possible that our bereaved indi-
viduals who were higher in openness to experience were
more willing to engage in activities which may bring judg-
ment or criticism from their social network in order to cope
with the death of their loved ones.
Based on prior research (Beals and Rook, 2006;
Carstensen, 1992), it was predicted that women and
younger participants would report experiencing more nega-
tive social exchanges. Our prediction regarding women
was supported; however, our prediction regarding age was
not. The non-significance of the association between age
and negative social exchanges was particularly surprising
given that our prediction was based on socioemotional
selectivity theory (Carstensen, 1992), a very heavily
researched and well-supported theory. Perhaps there is

something unique about being bereaved or the experiences
that come with bereavement (e.g. attending social gather-
ings to mourn or celebrate the life of the deceased) that
change the nature or frequency of social exchanges.
Negative social exchanges and self-reported
physical health
With regard to negative social exchanges and self-reported
physical health, we hypothesized that negative social
exchanges would be negatively associated with self-
reported physical health, which has been supported in pre-
vious research (e.g. Hill et al., 2014; Newsom et al., 2008).
Our results supported this hypothesis. In fact, the inclusion
of negative social exchanges in the structural equation
model accounted for an additional 7.2
percent of the vari-
ance in self-reported physical health. This finding lends
further support to the idea that the type and quality of inter-
action with one's social network is particularly important
when trying to understand how individuals cope with life
stressors. Future bereavement research should consider
attempting to separate the impacts of different types of neg-
ative social exchanges, such as well-meaning negative
social exchanges (e.g. offering inappropriate or unwanted
advice), accidental negative social exchanges (e.g. failing
to spend time together), and purposeful negative social
exchanges (e.g. being critical about personal concerns), as
outcomes may differ in kind or severity based on the type
of negative social exchange.
Limitations
Results should be interpreted in the context of the follow-
ing limitations. Due to the unique characteristics of the
sample (e.g. Amazon Mechanical Turk sample, mostly
highly-educated Caucasian individuals, and very diverse
relationships with the deceased), results may not be gener-
alizable to other populations experiencing bereavement.
Furthermore, previous research indicates that individuals
who have obtained higher levels of education or income

experience fewer negative social exchanges (Newsom
et al., 2008). As such, this sample may have been less likely
to experience negative social exchanges. It is possible that
negative social exchanges would have a stronger associa-
tion among personality and self-reported physical health in
other samples. Future research should examine these asso-
ciations in a more generalizable sample.
When examining personality, this study only examined
the influence of each personality trait separately. It is possi-
ble that certain associations were not found among person-
ality, negative social exchanges, and self-reported physical
health as a result of not taking into consideration personality
profiles or interactions among personality traits. Kinnunen
et al. (2012) examined personality profiles and self-rated
health in middle-aged adults, with results indicating that the
over-controlled personality profile (i.e. higher in neuroti-
cism and lower in extraversion) reported the worst self-rated
health compared to the other personality profiles. Future
research should examine the role of personality profiles or
interactions among negative social exchanges.
There are some methodological concerns with the SF-12
and negative social exchanges scale. Specifically, physical
health was assessed through self-report via the SF-12.
Thus, the association between personality and self-reported
physical health may be biased because individuals who are
higher in neuroticism are more likely to report physical
health symptoms (Friedman and Kern, 2014). Future
research assessing physical health should examine objec-
tive measures of health to offset this reporting bias. In addi-
tion, the negative social exchanges scale asked participants
to rate how frequently they have experienced negative
social exchanges within the past year. As such, it is possible
that participants were not reporting the amount of negative
social exchanges they have received during their length of
their bereavement, especially the individuals who experi-
enced bereavement less than a year.
Finally, this study was a cross-sectional study. As such,
only associations can be inferred from the results. Future
research should take a longitudinal approach to personality,
negative social exchanges, and physical health. Through this
approach, researchers can control for previous negative social
exchanges and physical health and examine whether changes
in negative social exchanges influence physical health.
Implications
Despite the limitations, there are many important implica-
tions from our findings. First, our data suggest that person-
ality retains the association with physical health even in the
context of experiencing stressful life events with known
impacts on physical health. Second, researchers in the
bereavement field could target individuals who are more
likely to experience greater declines in physical health
based on their individual and social characteristics. These
individuals could be assessed with a questionnaire, which
would be resource inexpensive and efficient in time.
Finally, our results suggest that negative social exchanges
are an important area of study for future bereavement
research. While much research has focused on the role of
social support in assisting bereaved individuals, our data
imply that the type and quality of interactions with mem-
bers of the social network are important to examine. If the
members of the bereaved individual's social network are
not supportive, even if well-intentioned, they may cause or
exacerbate difficulties for the bereaved adult.
