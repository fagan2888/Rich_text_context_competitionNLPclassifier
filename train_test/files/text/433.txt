Racial Differences in the Effect of Early Milk Consumption on Peak and
Postmenopausal Bone Mineral Density
ALEXANDER R OPOTOWSKY1 and JOHN P BILEZIKIAN1,2
ABSTRACT
Studies of the effect of milk consumption on bone density have focused on white women. The applicability to
other races is unclear. This study of 4316 women found a racial difference in the effect of early milk
consumption on bone. Further study is required to evaluate the etiology of this difference.
Introduction: Early milk consumption has been found to influence bone mineral density positively throughout life.
Previous studies leading to this finding focused on white women; there are no data to support the view that black
women also gain an equivalent benefit from early milk consumption.
Materials and Methods: Using data from the Third National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES
III), we analyzed the relationship between reported childhood and teenage milk consumption and current hip bone
mineral density at four sites (femoral neck, trochanter, intertrochanter, and total hip) among postmenopausal and 20-
to 39-year-old non-Hispanic white (NHW) and black (NHB) women. Potential confounding variables were accounted
for in the analysis.
Results: Controlling for age and body mass index, teenage milk consumption was significantly associated with
higher bone mineral density at all four sites among both postmenopausal and 20- to 39-year-old white women, but
was not associated with bone mineral density at any site among black women. A similar pattern was observed for
childhood milk intake. The interaction between race and teenage milk consumption significantly explained post-
menopausal bone mineral density at all sites, whereas the interaction between race and teenage milk consumption was
significant at two of the four sites among the 20- to 39-year-old women.
Conclusion: The results show racial differences in the effect of early milk consumption on peak and postmenopausal
bone mineral density.

INTRODUCTION
OSTEOPOROSIS AFFECTS 6­7 million women and results in
1.5 million fractures in the United States each year.(1,2)
Several risk factors for low bone mineral density (BMD)
have been described. Conversely, a number of protective
characteristics have been identified. Calcium intake, espe-
cially before achieving peak bone mass, is a determinant of
bone mass throughout life. Milk contributes over one-half of
the calcium to the average American child's (2­11 years
old) diet. All dairy products together provide 70% of
childhood calcium intake.(3) The effects of dairy products
on calcium metabolism are not limited to their high calcium
content. Some dairy products also contain significant quan-
tities of sodium and protein, both of which have been
associated with urinary calcium loss.(4) Because milk has a
higher ratio of calcium to sodium and protein than other
dairy products, it is reasonable to consider that milk may
influence bone density more positively than other dairy
products.(5)
Milk consumption in children and teenagers has been
associated, in many cross-sectional and a few prospective
studies, with enhanced bone mineral acquisition, higher
peak bone mass, and higher bone density in adulthood.(6­12)
The effect of milk consumption by older women on bone
mass is less well defined, but some studies have found a

positive impact.(8,10) All these studies excluded blacks. The
relationship between early milk consumption and BMD
among black women has yet to be explored.
For several reasons, the results of studies suggesting
increased bone mass in white women with high childhood
and teenage milk consumption may not apply to black
women. Despite clear similarities, there are significant dif-
ferences between black and white women in the factors gov-
erning mineral metabolism and bone mass. Black women have
significantly higher bone mass than whites.(13­15) Black
women also have lower bone turnover rates, higher parathyroid
hormone (PTH) levels, lower 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels
[25(OH)D], and lower urinary calcium excretion than white
women.(14­18) In addition, the high prevalence of lactose in-
tolerance among blacks may impair their ability to benefit
from diets high in lactose-containing products such as
milk.(19) Undoubtedly, there are other undefined racial dif-
ferences in calcium metabolism between white and black
women. There is clearly a paucity of research on racial
differences in calcium metabolism, especially dietary calci-
um's effect on bone mass. The National Institutes of Health
consensus statement on optimal calcium intake noted the
dearth of information on calcium requirements among dif-
ferent ethnic groups and recommended further research in
this field.(20)
The current study explores the differential effects of
childhood and teenage milk consumption on hip BMD in
white and black postmenopausal and 20- to 39-year-old
women.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Data source
The Third National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey (NHANES III) was conducted between 1988 and
1994 by the National Center for Health Statistics, Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention, to assess the health and
nutritional status of the civilian non-institutionalized popu-
lation of the United States. NHANES III data are freely
available for analysis.(21,22) The survey was based on a
highly stratified, multistage, probability sample design.
Sampling weights were developed to account for the com-
plex survey design, survey nonresponse, and survey non-
coverage.(23)
For the postmenopausal women, we selected all non-
Hispanic postmenopausal (i.e., reported no menstrual period
for the previous 12 months) women who responded to
questions regarding childhood and teenage milk consump-
tion. Women were excluded if information about weight,
height, age at menopause, or current calcium intake data
were missing. Bone densitometry had to be technically
satisfactory for inclusion in the study. NHANES III in-
cluded 2086 non-Hispanic white (NHW) postmenopausal
women, but 167 had technically unacceptable DXA tests, 1
had incomplete weight data, 149 were unsure of the date of
their last menstrual period, 58 and 77 had incomplete teen-
age and childhood milk consumption information, respec-
tively, and 58 had incomplete calcium data. The survey also
included 953 non-Hispanic black (NHB) postmenopausal
women, but 124 had technically unacceptable DXA tests, 1
had incomplete weight information, 118 were unsure of the
date of their last menstrual period, 18 and 32 had incomplete
teenage and childhood milk consumption information, re-
spectively, and 22 had incomplete calcium intake data.
Among black women, those excluded were younger (p 
0.001), and they were less likely to have used oral contra-
ceptives (p  0.003), hormone replacement (p  0.001), or
to have been physically active in the previous month (p 
0.005). A similar pattern held for excluded white women.
They were younger (p  0.001), less likely to have used
oral contraceptives (p  0.001) or hormone replacement
(p  0.01), and less likely to have been physically active in
the previous month (p  0.03). Excluded white women
were also more likely to have breastfed (p  0.02). Other
variables, including level of childhood and teenage milk
consumption, were comparable between excluded and in-
cluded women. The white postmenopausal women ranged
in age from 22 to 90 years, and the black women ranged
from 21 to 90 years of age. For both racial groups, the great
majority of postmenopausal women were at least 40 years
old (95.8% NHW, 91.6% NHB). Overall, 1675 NHW post-
menopausal women (weighted to represent 25,350,000
women) and 735 NHB postmenopausal women (weighted
to represent 2,990,000 women) were included to evaluate
teenage milk consumption in this study. The corresponding
figures for childhood milk consumption were 1656
(25,080,000) and 725 (2,950,000).
We also selected 20- to 39-year-old NHW and NHB
women. Of the 1070 NHW women, 143 had technically
unacceptable DXA tests, whereas 219 of the 1249 NHB
women's DXA tests were unacceptable. In addition, 18
NHW and 30 NHB women were excluded because of in-
complete current calcium intake data. One white woman
and two black women had incomplete teenage milk con-
sumption information, while five white women and six
black women had incomplete information on childhood
milk consumption. Excluded white women tended to be
younger (28.4 versus 30.2 years old, p  0.001) and were
less likely to have used hormone replacement (0% versus
2.5%, p  0.005) than white women included in the study.
There were no differences in current calcium intake, body
mass index (BMI), oral contraceptive use, smoking, drink-
ing, physical activity, or childhood or teenage milk intake
between the excluded and included white women. Among
the 20- to 39-year-old black women, those excluded were
less likely to use oral contraception (71.8 versus 83.3%, p 
0.01) and had higher calcium intake (687 versus 588 mg,
p  0.05). There were no differences between the excluded
and included black women in terms of age, BMI, hormone
replacement use, smoking, drinking, physical activity, or
childhood or teenage milk intake. Overall, 908 20- to 39-
year-old NHW women (weighted to represent 24,070,000
women) and 998 20- to 39-year-old NHB women (weighted
to represent 4,370,000 women) were selected for the teen-
age milk consumption part of this study, whereas 904 NHW
women (weighted to represent 23,970,000 women), and 994
NHB women (weighted to represent 4,360,000 women)
were included to evaluate the effect of childhood milk
consumption.

RACE, MILK, AND BONE DENSITY
Bone density measurements
Bone densitometry of the hip was performed on all non-
pregnant NHANES III participants 20 years of age or older.
Bone density was measured at five hip sites: femoral neck,
trochanter, intertrochanter, Ward's triangle, and total hip.
As recommended by the NHANES III documentation and
the International Society for Clinical Densitometry, our
study did not use the data for Ward's triangle.(1) All mea-
surements were performed using the Hologic QDR 1000
DXA machine (Hologic, Waltham, MA, USA). A rigorous
quality control program was maintained throughout the
survey as documented by Wahner et al.(24) All DXA tests
were reviewed individually at the Mayo Clinic (Rochester,
MN, USA) for technical evaluation before inclusion in the
database.
Dietary intake, anthropometric measures, and lifestyle
characteristics
NHANES III evaluated dietary intake using a 24-h di-
etary recall interview, and specific nutrient values were
estimated. As a separate part of the NHANES III interview,
participants were asked how much milk they drank as
children (5­12 years old) and as teenagers (13­17 years
old). Participants chose from six levels of milk intake for
each age range: none, less than one glass per week, one
glass per week, between one glass per week and one glass
per day, one glass per day, and more than one glass per day.
Because of potential misclassification and because subtle
differences in milk intake are unlikely to have significant
clinical effects, we stratified the responses into three cate-
gories: less than 1 glass of milk per week (low), at least 1
glass of milk per week but no more than 1 glass of milk
daily (intermediate), and greater than 1 glass of milk per day
(high). The breakdown of milk consumption in the interme-
diate group was similar for blacks and whites both in the 20-
to 39-year-old group and among postmenopausal women.
For example, 9.7% of NHW and 9.1% of NHB postmeno-
pausal women consumed one glass per week, 28.3% of
NHW and 27.1% of NHB consumed between one glass per
week and one glass per day, and 62.0% of NHW and 63.8%
of NHB consumed one glass of milk per day as teenagers.
The figures were similar for childhood milk consumption,
with a higher proportion drinking one glass of milk daily
(71.4% overall: 71.5% NHW, 71.3% NHB).
Participants were defined as having a history of oral
contraceptive pill use if they had ever taken birth control
pills for any reason and as having a history of hormone
replacement therapy if they had ever taken estrogen or
female hormone pills other than oral contraceptive pills or
had used female hormone patches. Women were defined as
having a history of breastfeeding if they had breastfed any
of their children for at least 1 month. Participants were
categorized as having engaged in some form of physical
activity in the previous month if they reported one of the
following activities: jogging/running, bicycling, swimming,
calisthenics/exercising, aerobics or aerobic dancing,
gardening/yard work, lifting weights, or any other exercises/
sports.
Participants were defined as having smoked if they
smoked 100 or more cigarettes during their lifetime. Partic-
ipants were categorized as having a history of heavy alcohol
use if they reported that they consumed daily five or more
alcoholic drinks regularly during their lifetime. Race was
defined as black or white using both self-report and family
questionnaires. Participants were asked their race (white,
black, other), and ethnicity (Mexican-American, Other His-
panic, Not Hispanic). This study included all women who
were designated as either white or black, but were not
Hispanic.
Statistical analysis
We analyzed two populations: postmenopausal and 20- to
39-year-old women. The methods outlined below were ap-
plied to each population individually. Multiple linear re-
gression analysis was performed on each study population
(including both NHW and NHB) to determine if there was
a racial difference in the effect of early milk consumption
on BMD. Models included a categorical race variable, an
interaction term between race and milk consumption, and
potentially confounding variables. For the postmenopausal
women, we repeated the interaction analyses, excluding
potentially biased groups (previous diagnosis of osteoporo-
sis, a history of hip fracture, or had taken thyroid hormones,
anticonvulsants, systemic corticosteroids, or drugs primarily
affecting calcium metabolism in the previous month). We
further analyzed the effect of early milk consumption on
BMD for each race individually. These analyses used the
same multiple linear regression models, excluding the race
and interaction terms. The least-square means method was
used to calculate the mean (SEM) BMD, by race, for
given levels of childhood and teenage milk consumption at
each site.
The multivariate analyses for the 20- to 39-year-old
women included most of the covariates from the postmeno-
pausal model. Years since menopause was excluded for
obvious reasons, as was a history of breastfeeding. Current
calcium intake was excluded because calcium intake in
young adulthood is likely to correlate highly with early milk
consumption. Because many studies have shown that early
calcium consumption has a much greater effect on BMD
than young adult calcium intake, we felt that including this
variable would obscure real results, not control for a poten-
tial confounder. All analyses were repeated controlling for
age, controlling for both age and BMI, and controlling for
the full multivariate model. Because the results of the first
two models were similar, only the results of the age and
BMI model are reported.
Baseline differences in clinically relevant variables be-
tween milk consumption groups were analyzed using the 2
test and Student's t-test. All analyses were performed using
SAS-callable SUDAAN 8.0 (Research Triangle Interna-
tional, Research Triangle Park, NC, USA), using the appro-
priate sample weights and taking into account the stratified
survey design.

RESULTS
Postmenopausal women
Descriptive statistics for postmenopausal women, by race
and milk consumption, are shown in Table 1. For both races,
those who reported drinking more milk during childhood
had significantly higher current calcium intake. Black
women in the higher milk intake groups were more likely to
have used hormone replacement. For white women, those
with higher milk intake were more likely to have breastfed
a child and were more likely to have been physically active
in the prior month. Higher teenage milk consumption also
correlated with higher calcium intake, more physical activ-
ity, and breastfeeding among white women, in addition to a
higher probability of using hormone replacement. Reported
teen milk intake was not correlated with calcium intake
among the postmenopausal black women, but was associ-
ated with higher probability of breastfeeding. There were
also differences between the NHB and NHW postmeno-
pausal women. NHB women had a higher prevalence of
heavy alcohol use (8.1% versus 5.2%, p  0.03), and
breastfeeding (48.7% versus 41.0%, p  0.007), but a lower
prevalence of physical activity in the past month (51.8%
versus 70.0%, p  0.001) and hormone replacement use
(29.3% versus 42.9%, p  0.001). Blacks were younger by
4.6 years (p  0.001), had been postmenopausal for a
shorter period of time (by 2.3 years, p  0.002), and had a
2.7 kg/m2 higher BMI (p  0.001). Black women's current
daily calcium intake was significantly lower than white
women's (527 versus 687 mg, p  0.001). Of note, black

RACE, MILK, AND BONE DENSITY
women in the highest childhood or teenage milk intake
category had even lower current daily calcium intake than
whites in the lowest milk intake group (for childhood, 519
versus 581 mg; for teenage, 548 versus 561 mg). We con-
trolled for all of these variables in the multivariate analyses
reported below, and therefore, these specific differences
cannot account for our results. However, this widespread
and significant variation highlights the complexity of study-
ing racial differences. Factors unimportant in investigations
of relatively homogenous populations may significantly
confound studies of diverse populations.
To determine if race modified the effect of early milk
consumption on postmenopausal BMD, we used a regres-
sion model including an interaction term between race and
reported milk intake. The results are shown in Table 2.
Controlling for age and BMI, the teenage interaction term
was significant at all sites (p  0.01­0.04). This association
was attenuated in the full multivariate model, but the inter-
action term remained significant at three of the sites (p 
0.02­0.03) and was of borderline significance at the femoral
neck (p  0.05). While the interaction term did not reach
statistical significance at any site for childhood milk con-
sumption in the limited model, it did approach significance
(p  0.06­0.11) at three of the four sites (total hip, tro-
chanter, and intertrochanter) in the multivariate model.
These results suggest that, in terms of postmenopausal
BMD, whites benefit more from teenage, and possibly
childhood, milk consumption than blacks do.
All interaction analyses were repeated, excluding poten-
tially biased groups as noted previously. The changes in
statistical significance were minimal. While interactions at
five sites became slightly less significant, the p values at all
affected sites were still 0.10. Conversely, some borderline
significant interactions (0.05  p  0.10) became more
significant (p  0.05) after excluding potentially biased
groups. Excluding users of systemic corticosteroids en-
hanced the significance of the teenage milk intake by race
interaction at the femoral neck (p  0.05) and the childhood
milk intake by race interaction at the total hip (p  0.05).
Excluding women who reported a previous hip fracture also
improved the significance of the childhood milk intake by
race interaction at the total hip (p  0.05).
Racial subgroup analysis was performed to investigate
the effect of early milk consumption on postmenopausal
BMD for each race individually. The regression coefficients
of multiple linear regression models of postmenopausal
BMD on reported teenage milk consumption controlling for
age and BMI are shown in Table 2. At all sites, white
women with the highest milk intake had significantly higher
BMD than those in the lowest category of milk intake, and
there was a significant linear trend toward higher BMD with
higher milk intake at all sites. Interestingly, among black
women childhood and teenage milk consumption had a
negative, albeit statistically insignificant, effect on post-
menopausal BMD. Once again, controlling for the nine
additional variables listed previously (see right side of Table
2) lessened the statistical significance of these findings, but
the higher milk intake groups still tended to have higher
BMD among white women (all p  0.10). The linear effect
became less pronounced, and there seemed to be a plateau
effect of milk consumption, with similar BMD values for
the intermediate and highest milk intake groups. The effect
of childhood milk consumption on BMD among white
women was somewhat less clear than the effect of teenage
milk consumption. The values of the coefficients for child-
hood milk consumption were similar to those seen with
teenage milk consumption, but the statistical significance
was lower, likely because of the smaller number of subjects
consuming little or no milk during childhood. Only two
sites showed a significant linear relationship among whites
(trochanter and total hip) after controlling for age and BMI.
At all sites, however, white women with the highest milk
intake had significantly higher BMD than those in the
lowest group. Once again, the signs of the coefficients for
whites and blacks were reversed, with milk consumption
having a positive effect on BMD among white women and
a negative, although statistically insignificant, effect among
black women.
Least-square means were calculated for white and black
postmenopausal women by reported teenage milk consump-
tion and are shown in Fig. 1. For white women, the mean
BMD, adjusting for covariates, seems to increase with
higher milk intake, whereas this is not the case among the
black women.
Younger women (20­39 years old)
We repeated our analyses on the 20- to 39-year-old
women participating in NHANES III. Descriptive statistics
for this population, by race and childhood and teenage milk
intake, are shown in Table 3.
There were no racial differences in the prevalence of
heavy alcohol use (black, 6.4% versus white, 6.3%, p 
0.95), hormone replacement use (1.6% versus 2.5%, p 
0.31), or oral contraceptive use (83.3% versus 85.3%, p 
0.31) between black and white women in this population.
However, there were other racial differences. Blacks had a
lower prevalence of physical activity in the past month
(69.5% versus 84.6%, p  0.001) and smoking (38.9%
versus 52.0%, p  0.001). Blacks were younger by 0.7
years (p  0.02) and had higher BMI (27.5 versus 24.7, p 
0.001). Black women's current daily calcium intake was
significantly lower than white women's (588.4 versus 788.0
mg, p  0.001).
The interaction between childhood milk consumption and
race was not significant at any site in either the limited or
full multivariate models, but the corresponding interaction
for teenage milk consumption trended toward significance
(p  0.10) at all hip sites in both models and at p  0.05 at
two of four sites, after controlling for age and BMI, and at
one site in the full multivariate model (see Table 4). White
women in the highest milk intake group had significantly
higher BMD than women in the lowest intake group at all
sites. Similar to our results from postmenopausal women,
milk consumption had no significant effect on BMD at any
site analyzed among the black women.
Least-square means were calculated for white and black
women by reported teenage milk consumption and are
shown in Fig. 2. For white women, the mean BMD, adjust-
ing for covariates, at each of these sites is significantly
higher among those drinking more milk. There is no such
1982 OPOTOWSKY AND BILEZIKIAN
difference among the black women. Once again, white
women seems to benefit from drinking more milk as teen-
agers, whereas blacks do not. Of note, blacks had higher
peak and postmenopausal BMD at all sites, independently
of childhood or teenage milk consumption status.
DISCUSSION
Blacks have lower calcium intake during both childhood
and adulthood than whites.(25) However, despite chronically
lower calcium intake than white women, black women have

* The childhood milk intake analysis included 1656 white women and 725 black women, while teenage milk intake analysis included 1675 white women
and 735 black women. Of the white women, 131 and 208 consumed less than one glass of milk per week as children and teenagers, respectively. The
corresponding figures were 51 and 87 for the black women.
 The full multivariate model included milk intake (three levels), age, BMI, hormone replacement (ever used), oral contraceptives (ever used), years since
menopause, smoking (ever smoked more than 100 cigarettes), alcohol consumption (heavy use), physical activity (at least once in past month), breast
feeding (ever feeding for 1 month), pregnancy (ever), and current daily calcium intake.

a much lower prevalence of osteoporosis and osteope-
nia.(1,26) Until the results of this study, however, there was
no information in blacks on the relationship between child-
hood and teenage milk consumption and BMD in their adult
years. The results of this analysis indicate that the expected
positive relationship between early milk consumption and
BMD is not demonstrable among black women.
Our results show a significant racial difference in the
effect of early, especially teenage, milk consumption on
peak and postmenopausal bone density. As demonstrated by
previous studies, white women benefit significantly from
childhood and teenage milk consumption, but our observa-
tions suggest that black women derive no such benefit.
Several plausible mechanisms to explain these observations
are worthy of comment.
Lactose intolerance is common among blacks. Milk con-
sumption in lactose intolerant individuals may decrease
transit time, thereby reducing calcium absorption and the
absorption of other nutrients essential for skeletal health.
However, multiple studies have demonstrated that lactose-
intolerant individuals absorb calcium from milk normally,
or at least sufficiently.(27­29) Furthermore, there is specific
evidence that lactose-intolerant black female adolescents
adapt to high-lactose diets with a reduction in symptoms
associated with lactose consumption.(30) However, milk
consumption over a prolonged or developmentally critical
period of time among lactose-intolerant subjects may affect
calcium absorption or metabolism in entirely different ways
from the published reports. Additionally, investigation of
calcium absorption in lactose-intolerant individuals has fo-
cused on white women, raising the possibility that blacks
with lactose intolerance may adapt differently.
Genetic diversity may play a role in explaining the dem-
onstrated racial differences. For example, polymorphisms in
the vitamin D receptor are thought by some to be associated
with a marked effect on bone density among white
women(31) and may affect calcium absorption among chil-
dren.(32) The same polymorphisms, while present in a large
proportion of black women, do not seem to be correlated
with bone density among black women.(31,33) Undoubtedly,
other genetic distinctions will be of interest when they are
elucidated.
Dietary interactions between calcium and other minerals
and nutrients(34­36) are unlikely to account for the negative
correlation between early milk consumption and bone den-
sity in black women, but differences in calcium homeostasis
may provide a clue toward explaining our results. Black
children and teenagers seem to absorb calcium more effi-
ciently.(37,38) Furthermore, blacks retain more calcium, as
demonstrated by lower 24-h urinary calcium excre-
tion.(14­18) Vitamin D and PTH have a different physiology
in blacks, reflecting a picture similar to secondary hyper-
parathyroidism. Serum 25(OH)D lower and serum 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D and PTH concentrations are lower
among blacks.(14­16,18) Nevertheless, bone turnover is lower
among blacks.(39) Lower bone turnover and greater calcium
retention may tend to negate the importance of low calcium
intake among blacks. Alternatively, high calcium intake
early in life may interfere with the development of this
highly efficient calcium conservation metabolism, and thus
put these black women at greater risk for age-related and
postmenopausal bone loss. Of course, milk is a complex
food and contains nutrients besides calcium, which may
affect bone mass, such as phosphorus, protein, and vitamin

A. Plausibly, racial variation in the responsiveness to or
metabolism of these or other constituents in milk might play
a role in explaining these results.
Milk consumption in childhood may not only directly
help in the accrual of peak bone mass. It may also be
beneficial by establishing a pattern of milk consumption that
lasts throughout life. Our results support this assertion. Milk
consumption in childhood correlates well with milk con-
sumption and calcium intake later in life for both black and
white women. Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that
despite much lower average calcium intake, black women
have higher bone density than white women. This suggests
that calcium intake in general may not play as pivotal a role
in bone health for black women as it does for whites. Other
physiological factors, some of which have been listed, may
be dominant and thereby limit the importance of early milk
intake among blacks on bone mass.
This study has several limitations. The history of milk
consumption was self-reported, and for the postmenopausal
women, were recalled behaviors of 45­55 years before the
survey. Nevertheless, distant dietary recall has consistently
proven superior to current diet as a predictor of historical
diet.(40­44) Furthermore, recall of milk intake correlates well
with historical intake, with correlation coefficients ranging
from 0.47 to 0.58. In addition to recall history, recall bias is
another potential limitation of our study. In this case, how-
ever, a recall bias would have to correlate milk consumption
with BMD differentially by race, positively for whites and
negatively for blacks, to produce the reported results. Bone
density testing was in its infancy at the time of this study
and few women in the population had previously undergone
bone density testing. To affect the results, the few women
previously tested would have had to remember their bone
densities and associate these values with early milk con-
sumption, a most unlikely scenario.
While we were able to control for concurrent potentially
confounding variables, we could not address associations
between early milk consumption and potentially confound-
ing factors during childhood or teenage years. For example,
childhood milk consumption may be positively associated
with childhood physical activity in one racial group but
negatively correlated in the other. If these associations are

there is no way to test this hypothesis using the NHANES
III data set.
BMD is the most widely used and best validated predictor
of fracture risk, but it admittedly does not give a perfect
measure of bone strength. Bone turnover, microarchitecture,
geometry, and size may all play significant and independent
roles in determining bone strength. It is possible that milk
intake has a disproportionately larger effect on these other
properties among black women. Such changes may not

necessarily be reflected in higher bone density but would
certainly improve the biomechanical characteristics of
bones. Thus, while our results show racial variation in the
effect of milk on bone density, these findings cannot be
directly related to bone strength or fracture risk. Nor do they
infer that milk doesn't have important effects on these other
parameters in black and white women.
A final noteworthy limitation refers to the possibility that
the classification of regular milk drinkers differed between
blacks and whites. It is conceivable that white children in
the highest category of milk consumption ingested much
more milk than the black children in the same, highest,
category of milk consumption. This concern would also
have to assume the ingestion of milk, and therefore calcium,
in the black children, even in this highest intake category,
was below the threshold for optimal calcium absorption.
This study has several major advantages over previous
studies addressing this issue. First, the sample size is large,
and the survey population, as appropriately weighted, is
representative of the entire United States population. Previ-
ous studies recruited subjects from smaller geographic ar-
eas, limiting the generalizabilty of their results. Second,
NHANES III used rigorous quality control measures to
ensure the validity of BMD measurements. In fact, these
data were used to develop the universal reference values for
hip BMD measurements. Third, data on multiple potential
confounding factors were collected, allowing us to control
for all six important confounders noted by Weinsier.(5)
Furthermore, two adult populations were used to support
the validity of our findings: young and postmenopausal
women. Any confounding factor, such as childhood physi-
cal activity, unaccounted for in the analyses above, would
have to be similar for these two generations of women.
These consistent results suggest that the racial difference in
response to early milk consumption seen in postmenopausal
women have their origins much earlier and persist through-
out life.
In conclusion, there are racial differences in the effect of
early milk consumption on peak and postmenopausal bone
density. Our results do not diminish the well-documented
and essential role of adequate calcium intake in a variety of
skeletal health issues. In fact, this study supports an impor-
tant role for early milk and calcium consumption in pro-
moting lifelong bone health among white women. While the
physiological mechanisms underlying the differences
among whites and blacks remain to be identified, the public
health implications are clear. Universal recommendations
for dairy product consumption are based on incomplete data
and should be reconsidered pending rigorous investigation
of the effects of dairy products on bone health among racial
and ethnic minorities.
