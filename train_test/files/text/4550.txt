Introduction
The renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS) is the
central regulator of water and salt homeostasis in the body.
Components of this hormonal cascade are major targets for
pharmaceutical agents aimed at controlling blood pres-
sure, and heart and kidney functions. Dahl salt-sensitive
(SS) SS/JrHsdMcwi rats are extensively used to study the
role of salt consumption in the development of hyperten-
sion. These rats, when kept on a high salt diet, exhibit
remarkable phenotypic traits similar to those seen in the
hypertensive African American population, including low
renin, salt-sensitivity, hyperinsulinemia, and early end
stage renal disease.1­3
Previous studies have shown that introgression of chro-
mosome 13 (Chr 13) from the Brown Norway (BN) rat into
the SS genetic background attenuates the development of
hypertension in an SS-13BN consomic strain. While Chr 13
contains the renin gene, further studies, which narrowed the
protective loci in the SS-13BN rats against salt-sensitivity,
did not identify the renin gene in these regions.4­6 However,
a number of other studies demonstrated that genetic modi-
fication of the renin locus does affect blood pressure.7­10

Abstract
Objective: The Dahl salt-sensitive rat is a well-established model of salt-sensitive hypertension. The goal of this study
was to assess the expression and activity of renal sodium channels and transporters in the renin-deficient salt-sensitive rat.
Methods: Renin knockout (Ren-/-) rats created on the salt-sensitive rat background were used to investigate the role
of renin in the regulation of ion transport in salt-sensitive hypertension. Western blotting and patch-clamp analyses were
utilized to assess the expression level and activity of Na+ transporters.
Results: It has been described previously that Ren-/- rats exhibit severe kidney underdevelopment, polyuria, and lower
body weight and blood pressure compared to their wild-type littermates. Here we found that renin deficiency led to
decreased expression of sodium-hydrogen antiporter (NHE3), the Na+/H+ exchanger involved in Na+ absorption in the
proximal tubules, but did not affect the expression of Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2), the main transporter in the
loop of Henle. In the distal nephron, the expression of sodium chloride cotransporter (NCC) was lower in Ren-/- rats.
Single-channel patch clamp analysis detected decreased ENaC activity in Ren-/- rats which was mediated via changes in
the channel open probability.
Conclusion: These data illustrate that renin deficiency leads to significant dysregulation of ion transporters.

Previously, we generated a renin knockout (Ren-/-) in the
SS rat using zinc-finger nucleases (ZFNs) designed to tar-
get the renin gene.11 These rats have undetectable plasma
renin activity, underdeveloped kidneys as well as signifi-
cantly lower mean arterial pressure than their Ren+/+ litter-
mates. There was also evidence of decreased renal function,
reflected by polyuria, reduced creatinine excretion and cre-
atinine clearance in Ren-/- rats.11
Regulation of sodium balance by the kidney is the key
factor responsible for long-term blood pressure control.
Dahl SS rats demonstrate an impaired sodium excretion
response to increases in renal perfusion pressure. This pre-
disposes them to developing hypertension when chal-
lenged with a high salt diet.12 In the present study we
describe the effects of renin deficiency on several key
sodium transporters in various nephron segments.
Materials and methods
Animals
ZFN-mediated renin gene knockout (Ren-/-) rats and their
wild-type (Ren+/+) littermates were created11 and housed at
the Medical College of Wisconsin, and all work was con-
ducted under protocols approved by the Institutional
Animal Care and Use Committee. Male rats were fed 0.4%
NaCl diet (#113755, Dyets, Bethlehem, Pennsylvania,
USA). At the age of eight weeks, the rats were anesthe-
tized with isoflurane, blood samples were collected from
the descending aorta, and the kidneys were flushed with
phosphate buffer and used for further analysis.13
Plasma aldosterone and corticosterone levels
Collected blood samples were centrifuged (6000 g, 10
min), and then plasma was analyzed with the Aldosterone
and Corticosterone Active RIA kits (MP Biomedicals,
Orangeburg, New York, USA).
Patch-clamp analysis
Patch-clamp electrophysiology was used to assess ENaC
activity in isolated, split-open rat connecting tubule/cor-
tical collecting duct (CNT/CCD) segment. CNT/CCDs
were isolated from Ren-/- and Ren+/+ rats as described
previously.14,15 Kidneys were cut into thin slices (<1 mm)
and then placed into ice-cold physiologic saline solution
(pH 7.4). CNT/CCD regions were mechanically isolated
from these slices under a stereomicroscope by micro-
dissection with forceps. The tubules were split open with
sharpened micropipettes controlled with micromanipula-
tors to gain access to the apical membrane. Single-
channel recordings were acquired with Axopatch 200B or
700B amplifiers (Mol. Devices, Sunnyvale, California,
USA) interfaced via a Digidata 1440A to a personal
computers (PC) running the pClamp 10.2 suite software
(Mol. Devices) and subsequently analyzed with Clampex
10.2. Currents were filtered with an eight-pole, low pass
Bessel filter LPF-8 (Warner Inst., Hamden, Connecticut,
USA) at 0.3 kHz. A typical bath solution was used (in
mM): 150 NaCl, 1 CaCl2
, 2 MgCl2
, 10 HEPES (pH 7.4).
The pipette solution for the cell attached configuration
was (in mM): 140 LiCl, 2 MgCl2
and 10 HEPES (pH
7.4). NPo
, the product of the number of channels and the
open probability (Po
) were used to measure the channel
activity within a patch. When multiple channel events
were observed in a patch, the total number of functional
channels (N) in the patch was determined.
Western blot analysis
Kidney total lysate was prepared as described previously.15
Briefly, kidneys were cut in 1­2 mm slices under a stere-
omicroscope. Kidney cross-sections (~50 mg) were diced
into small pieces with a razor blade. Samples were pulse
sonicated in Laemmli buffer (Bio-Rad #161-0737) with a
protease inhibitor cocktail (Roche) for 10 s and spin cleared
at 10,000 g for 5 min. The resulting supernatant was sub-
jected to PAGE, subsequently transferred onto a nitrocel-
lulose membrane (Millipore, Bedford, Massachusetts,
USA), probed with antibodies, and visualized by enhanced
chemiluminescence (Fisher Sci #32106). The visualization
and densitometric analysis was done on the ChemiDoc
XRS+ System with Image Lab Software containing a band
saturation control. Densities were normalized to the cor-
responding -actin intensities and then relative values
were averaged in groups. Primary antibodies for sodium-
hydrogen antiporter (NHE3), -, - and -ENaC (SPC-
400D, SPC-403D, SPC-404D and SPC-405D, respectively)
were from StressMarq Biosciences Inc. (Victoria, British
Columbia, Canada);16 antibodies for sodium chloride
cotransporter (NCC) were kindly provided by David H
Ellison (Oregon Health & Science University, Portland),17,18
and Na-K-Cl cotransporter (NKCC2) by Pablo Ortiz
(Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit).19,20
Histological and immunohistochemical analysis
Extracted kidneys were placed into a neutral buffered 10%
formalin solution. The kidney sections were cut at 4 m
slices, dried, and deparaffinized for subsequent streptavi-
din-biotin immunohistochemistry. After deparaffinization,
the slides were treated with a citrate buffer pH6 for a total
of 35 min. The slides were blocked with a peroxidase
block (DAKO, Carpinteria, California, USA),Avidin Block
(Vector Labs, Burlingame, California, USA), Biotin Block
(Vector Labs), and serum-free Protein Block (DAKO). For
morphological analysis, the tissue was stained with hema-
toxylin-eosin. For immunohistochemical staining, tissue
sections were incubated for 30 min with anti-,  or -ENaC
Pavlov et al. 3
antibodies. Secondary detection was performed with goat
anti-rabbit biotinylated immunoglobulin G (IgG) (Biocare,
Concord, California, USA) followed by streptavidin conju-
gated with horseradish peroxidase (Biocare) and visualized
with diaminobenzadine (DAKO).
Statistical analysis
All summarized data are reported as mean±standard error
of the mean (SEM). Data are compared using one-way
analysis of variance (ANOVA) with Tukey correction and
p<0.05 is considered significant.
Results
Kidney morphology, plasma aldosterone,
corticosterone, and electrolyte levels
Ren-/- rats were previously reported to differ from their
Ren+/+ littermates by having significantly lower body
weights and kidney underdevelopment marked by dis-
placed medulla, incomplete formation of the medullary
rays, and occurrence of large central lesions.11 Figures 1(a)
and (b) confirm the presence of structural abnormalities in
Ren-/- kidneys, significant thinning of the medullar layer,
and massive areas of undifferentiated tissue in the cortex.
The low-renin plasma activity and angiotensin I levels
reported earlier11 are in accordance with our evaluation of
the plasma aldosterone concentration, which was found to
be significantly lower in Ren-/- rats (Figure 1(c)). Plasma
corticosterone level did not differ significantly between
the groups (Figure 1(d)).
Western blot analysis of renal sodium
transporters
Absolute sodium excretion and plasma Na+ concentration
in Ren-/- rats did not differ from their Ren+/+ littermates.11
However, the mutant animals demonstrated substantial
polyuria (especially when considering their low weight).
Several Na+ transporters expressed in the nephron
mediate sodium absorption in the kidney: NHE3 and
sodium-glucose transport protein (SGLT) in the proximal
tubules, NKCC2 in the loop of Henle, NCC in the distal
convoluted tubules and epithelial sodium channel (ENaC)
in the aldosterone-sensitive distal nephron, including late
part of DCT, CNT and CCD.21 Figure 2 demonstrates
Western blot analysis of several of these transporters in the
Ren-/- rats and their wild type littermates. NHE3 expres-
sion was lower in the Ren-/- group (Figure 2(a)) whereas
the expression of NKCC2 was not altered (Figure 2(b)).
We tested the consequences of renin deficiency on abun-
dance of the thiazide-sensitive NaCl co-transporter, NCC,
and found significantly lower expression of NCC in the
mutant animals (Figure 2(c)).
ENaC abundance and activity measurements
Normally, cortical ENaC performs only ~5% of sodium
reabsorption. However, this widely regulated channel is
involved in the fine tuning of sodium transport in the kid-
ney and is a key element in the antinatriuretic response to
aldosterone.16,22 Surprisingly, Western blot (Figure 3) and
immunohistochemical (Figure 4) analyses revealed that the
expression of all three ENaC subunits did not differ between

the groups. The only difference we noted was that expres-
sion of a ~90 kDa band of -ENaC was significantly lower
in Ren-/- animals (band 1; Figure 3). It should be noted,
however, that we did not analyze the cleaved forms of -
and -ENaC subunits, which play critical roles in the activ-
ity of the channel.23 To further test whether renin deficiency
affects functions of ENaC, we performed single channel
analysis using the cell-attached configuration of the patch-
clamp method. Figure 5(a) demonstrates representative
current traces recorded from the apical membranes of CCDs
isolated from Ren+/+ and Ren-/- rats. We found that mutant
rats exhibited significantly lower total ENaC activity (NPo
)
compared to Ren+/+ littermates. The average number of
channels observed in each experiment (N) did not signifi-
cantly vary between groups, but the lower NPo
in the Ren-/-
animals was caused by changes in the open probability of
individual channels (Po
) (Figure 5(b)). Therefore, these
data allow us to conclude that absence of renin decreases
the activity of ENaC by alteration of gating properties but
not expression of the channel.
Discussion
The role of the RAAS components in the management of
sodium reabsorption and excretion is still not fully under-
stood. SS rats are a low renin strain, and high salt con-
sumption decreases plasma renin activity even further,24­26
yet SS hypertension is accompanied with activation of the
paracrine RAAS system.24,26,27 Furthermore, adrenalecto-
mized SS rats do not develop hypertension on a high salt
diet, whereas exogenous aldosterone supplement reverses
this phenomenon.28 Renin knockout failed to concentrate
urine and have lower plasma angiotensin I11 and aldoster-
one levels. Angiotensin II and aldosterone were described
as positive regulators of several channels and transporters
in the kidney, including ENaC.29­31
Our goal was to investigate functions of major sodium
transport proteins along the nephron in the condition of
renin deficiency and the lack of aldosterone in the system.
We found that NKCC2 abundance did not change in mutant
compared to wild type animals whereas the other tested
sodium transporters exhibited reduced functions. Thus,
NHE3 abundance as well as NCC expression was lower
in the mutant animals. RAAS is a potent regulator of
sodium reabsorption in the distal segments of the nephron.
Aldosterone stimulates thiazide-sensitive sodium reab-
sorption, an effect accompanied with an increase in
NCC abundance.32­34 It was previously reported that salt
restriction leads to increased plasma renin activity, aldos-
terone levels, and NCC abundance.35 Angiotensin II posi-
tive regulation of NCC functions was also described.36­39

As mentioned above, RAAS is a powerful regulator of
ENaC activity. We did not find significant differences in
ENaC abundance between the groups, but Western blot-
ting revealed diminished presence of a ~90 kDa form
-ENaC subunit in the Ren-/- rats. Previously Ergonul and
colleagues demonstrated that maturation of ENaC was
accompanied with glycosylation of the -subunit, which
might play a role in current conditions.40 We further utilized
the patch-clamp approach to perform a functional assay and
found that ENaC activity in the Ren-/- isolated CCDs was
lower due to decreased open probability of the channel.
Recent studies also identified that kidney-specific min-
eralocorticoid receptor (MR) knockout mice exhibited salt
wasting, low BP, and hyperkalemia.18 It was reported that
knockout of MR in the kidney resulted in deficient apical
orientation and cleavage of ENaC. NCC and pNCC abun-
dances were also substantially reduced in the kidney-
specific MR-/- mice. Plasma K+ was elevated in the MR-/-
mice. The authors concluded that the effects on NCC were
secondary to the changes in plasma K+ since dietary K+
restriction of kidney-specific MR-/- mice maintained the
abundance of pNCC at a level similar to or greater than
control.18 This mechanism may be important in the Ren-/-
rats since it was previously shown that serum potassium
was significantly increased in Ren-/- rats.41 The authors
also demonstrated in vitro that the corticosterone basal lev-
els and production by zona reticularis/fasciculata cells in
response to cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) was
unaffected in the Ren-/- rat compared with the Ren+/+ con-
trols. Our in vivo experiments accordingly revealed equal
plasma levels of corticosterone in Ren-/- and Ren+/+ litter-
mates. We assume that the Ren-/- strain of Dahl SS rats can
be considered a model of isolated hypoaldosteronism but
further studies are needed to test this hypothesis.
The Ren-/- rat strain is a very exciting model which
delineates the role of local intrarenal processes when sys-
temic RAAS activity is low. For instance, recent studies
using this model defined basal and cAMP-stimulated
aldosterone production in the zona glomerulosa cells.41
Further characterization of sodium balance in these ani-
mals is required as we hypothesize that low systemic
RAAS activity is the cause of very low blood pressure
(~60 mm Hg) in these animals.11
