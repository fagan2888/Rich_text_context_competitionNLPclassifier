Background. Among the elderly population, the risk for psychological distress increases with the number of chronic
diseases and accompanying functional disability. The prevalence of chronic medical conditions and functional disabil-
ity varies substantially across ethnocultural groups, however. Using data from the Hispanic EPESE, we previously
reported that among older Mexican Americans, the total number of chronic medical conditions and the presence of
functional impairment are strong predictors of depressive symptoms.
Methods. Using multiple regression, we examined the association between specific chronic diseases, individual
functional disabilities, and depressive symptoms in this group of ethnic elders.
Results. Multiple regression models indicated that diabetes (OR = 1.25, 95% CI = 1.03-1.56), arthritis (OR = 1.42,
95% CI = 1.17-1.72), urinary incontinence (OR = 1.94, 95% CI = 1.46-2.59), bowel incontinence (OR = 2.28, 95% CI
= 1.15-4.55), kidney disease (OR = 3.11, 95% CI = 1.13-8.58), and ulcers (OR = 2.56, 95% CI = 1.23-5.29) were pre-
dictive of high levels of depressive symptoms. Hip fracture, although recognized as having a substantial impact on
functional status, was not found to be associated with depressive symptoms. History of stroke was not significantly
associated with depressive symptoms in bivariate or multivariate analyses, but history of stroke with residual speech
problems was predictive (OR = 2.16, 95% CI = 1.01-4.79). Among specific activities of daily living, only impaired
ability to walk across a room (OR = 1.65, 95% CI = 1.04-2.73) or to bathe oneself (OR = 1.87, 95% CI = 1.12-3.12)
proved to be predictive in multivariate analyses.
Conclusions. This constellation of chronic medical conditions and functional disabilities is very different from those
reported to be associated with depressive symptoms in older non-Hispanic White and African Americans, and appears
to comprise those conditions most associated with substantial physical impairment, pain, and discomfort.
ANUMBER of studies have found that, among elderly
people, the risk for depressive symptoms increases
with the number of chronic diseases (1-3). Using data from
the New Haven Established Population for the Epidemio-
logic Study of the Elderly (EPESE), for example, Berkman
et al. (4) found that the number of self-reported physical
health conditions was predictive of high levels of depres-
sive symptoms indicative of serious psychological distress.
Similar results have been found in both the Duke (5) and
the Iowa EPESE studies (6).
The risk of depression is greater when physical illness is
accompanied by functional disability (7,8). Indeed, func-
tional limitations are considered to be prime mediators of
the observed associations between severity of physical ill-
ness and depression in elders (3).
Whereas several investigators have examined the associ-
ation between specific medical conditions and psychologi-
cal well-being in elders (1,2,9-12), few studies have been
designed to simultaneously examine the influence of multi-
ple chronic medical conditions on the psychological well-
being of older adults using large, population-based sam-
ples. Specifically, in a study of older non-Hispanic Whites,
Pennix et al. (13) found that the risk for depressive symp-
toms was most strongly associated with arthritis, lung dis-
ease, stroke, cancer, and atherosclerosis. Among older
African Americans, Bazargan and Hamm-Baugh (14)
found that psychological distress was most strongly associ-
ated with kidney disease, vision problems, and circulation
problems, to the virtual exclusion of other conditions.
Little is known, however, concerning the influence of
specific and multiple chronic medical conditions on psy-
chological distress among older Mexican Americans, who
experience higher rates of diabetes, obesity, and gallstone
disease, and lower rates of heart disease and cancer than
Americans in general (15,16). We have been examining the
relationship between depressive symptomatology and the
number of chronic conditions using data from the Hispanic
EPESE, the first large, representative study of older Mexi-
can Americans residing in the Southwestern United States.
In our first report (17), we found that about 22% of the
2,823 respondents reported having no chronic conditions,
with some 25% reporting three or more conditions, and the
remaining 53% reporting one or two chronic conditions.
Using a cutoff score of 16 on the Center for Epidemiologic
Studies of Depression (CES-D) Scale (18), 25.6% of the
subjects reported high levels of depressive symptoms.
Both the mean CES-D score and the prevalence of high
levels of symptoms increased with the number of reported
M188

chronic conditions, with those reporting two or more condi-
tions at significantly higher risk for high levels of depres-
sive symptoms. Higher mean CES-D scores and rates of
high levels of symptoms were also strongly associated with
any functional disability, which was reported by about 12%
of older Mexican Americans. Multivariate regression analy-
ses indicated that in addition to sociodemographic charac-
teristics, functional disability and the number of chronic
conditions were found to be among the strongest predictors
of depressive symptoms. These findings suggest that the
excess risk for depressive symptoms may, in part, be attrib-
utable to an increased prevalence of chronic medical condi-
tions that are accompanied by substantial impairment in
functional status.
The present study expands upon this earlier work to
examine the relationships among depressive symptomatol-
ogy, specific chronic diseases, and individual functional
limitations in older Mexican Americans, using the data
from the Hispanic EPESE survey. The Hispanic EPESE is
the first large-scale study using a representative sample of
community-dwelling Mexican American elders from the
Southwest region of the United States. We hypothesized
that strong relationships between psychological distress,
chronic medical conditions, and functional disability would
be evident among older Mexican Americans. We expected
differences, however, regarding the specific conditions most
strongly associated with depressive symptoms in this
group, in comparison with African American and non-His-
panic White American elders.
METHODS
Sample
During 1993 and 1994, the initial wave of the Hispanic
EPESE survey was conducted in the five Southwestern
states of Texas, Colorado, New Mexico, Arizona, and Cali-
fornia. Area probability sampling resulted in a sample of
3,050 Mexican Americans aged 65 and over (representing
an 86% response rate) who agreed to complete in-home
face-to-face interviews, either in Spanish or English. The
analyses presented here reflect the reports of 2,823 individ-
uals who completed the questionnaire items pertaining to
depressive symptomatology, chronic physical health condi-
tions, and functional health.
Measures
Depressive symptomatology was measured with the Cen-
ter for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale, which is
the most widely used survey measure of depressive symp-
tomatology in studies of older adults. This scale has been
found to be highly reliable and valid when used with elders
(19), and is predictive of both current and future clinical
depression (20). The scale consists of 20 items that ask how
often specific symptoms were experienced during the past
week; responses are scored on a 4-point scale, with poten-
tial total scores ranging from 0-60. Two measures were
derived from the CES-D in this study, a continuous measure
based on the overall score and a dichotomous measure of
high levels of depressive symptomatology, or caseness,
defined as a score of 16 or greater (21).
Chronic physical health conditions were assessed with a
series of items in which the respondents were asked if they
had ever been told by a doctor that they had adult onset
diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular disease, hypertension,
stroke, cancer, gall bladder disease, hip fracture, or arthritis.
Respondents were also asked about any other chronic con-
ditions that seriously affect their health, and substantial
numbers reported having urinary or bowel incontinence,
stomach ulcers, asthma, or kidney disease.
Functional disability was measured with the Katz Activi-
ties of Daily Living scale [ADL; (22)]. The ADL items
were scored dichotomously, according to whether or not the
respondent reported needing help to perform the activity.
Health care service utilization measures included wheth-
er or not the respondents reported being hospitalized over-
night and whether they had visited a physician more than
once during the 12 months prior to the interview.
Sociodemographic characteristics included the respon-
dent's age (as of the most recent birthday), gender, years of
education, country of birth, and the language in which the
respondent chose to conduct the interview (Spanish or
English). Respondents were also asked the type of health
insurance coverage they had or if they had no coverage.
Analyses
Differences in the mean total CES-D scores and in the
caseness rates by sociodemographic characteristics, chronic
health conditions, individual functional disabilities, and
health-related characteristics were evaluated with r-test and
analysis of variance statistics. Independent variables found
to be significantly associated with depressive symptoms
were then entered into multiple regression models. Ordi-
nary least squares regression was employed to model the
continuous measure of the CES-D score, and logistic re-
gression was employed to model the dichotomous measure
of caseness. All regression analyses included an examina-
tion of interaction effects and an assessment of possible
multicollinearity among the independent variables. In order
to produce results that were representative of older Mexican
Americans in the five Southwestern states, all analyses
incorporated weighted data and adjusted for design effects.
Confidence intervals were computed using the SUDAAN
program (23).
RESULTS
Bivariate Results
The sociodemographic and health-related characteristics
of the sample used in this study have largely been described
in earlier work, along with the distribution of mean CES-D
scores and caseness rates (17). About 57% of the older
Mexican Americans were women and 67.6% were between
the ages of 65 and 74. The level of education was low, with
81.2% reporting less than 9 years of schooling. Whereas
44.5% of the respondents had been born outside the United
States, 72.8% preferred to conduct the interview in Spanish.
Having no medical insurance coverage was reported by
10.7% of the respondents. Over half (55.4%) were cur-
rently married, and 78.2% lived in households of two or
more people. Less than one-fifth (18%) had been hospital-
M190 BLACK ETAL.
ized during the past year, and 23.4% reported visiting a
physician more than once in the 12 months prior to the
interview.
Respondents reported an average of 10.5 depressive
symptoms, with 25.6% reporting high levels of depressive
symptoms (based on a CES-D score of 16 or more). We
reported that female gender, low levels of education, not
being currently married, preferring to conduct the interview
in Spanish, having no insurance coverage, the number of
chronic diseases, and functional disability were associated
with higher mean CES-D scores and caseness rates (17).
Table 1 presents the distribution of weighted CES-D
scores and prevalence of caseness (CES-D score of 16 or
more) by specific self-reported chronic conditions and indi-
vidual functional limitations. Almost all of the medical con-
ditions and all functional limitations were significantly
associated with both a higher mean number of depressive
symptoms and a higher prevalence of caseness. Interest-
ingly, no association between depressive symptoms and the
report of stroke was evident. We further examined the asso-
ciation among those stroke victims who reported having
residual problems, including upper extremity impairment,
lower extremity impairment and residual speech problems
(Table 2).
Multivariate Results
The results of the ordinary least squares regression
model predicting CES-D scores are presented in Table 3. In
terms of specific chronic conditions, diabetes, cardiovascu-
lar disease, stroke with residual speech problems, cancer,
arthritis, urinary incontinence, bowel incontinence, and kid-
ney disease were found to be predictive of CES-D scores.
With these conditions in the equation, other individual con-
ditions were no longer significant. Regarding individual
functional limitations, only impaired ability to walk across
a room and to bathe were found predictive of CES-D
scores. Being female, having little education, and having no
insurance coverage were also predictive of higher CES-D
scores, as was having been hospitalized in the past year or
having visited a physician more than once in the past year.
Age and language of interview were not significant predic-
tors in this model. In examining interaction effects between
the various independent variables, we found an interaction
between gender and immigrant status, with female immi-
grants having a greater risk and male immigrants having a
lower risk for higher CES-D scores.
Similar results were found with the logistic regression
model predicting high levels of depressive symptoms. As
can be seen in Table 4, diabetes, stroke with residual speech
problems, arthritis, urinary incontinence, bowel inconti-
nence, kidney disease, and stomach ulcers were found to be
predictive of caseness. Cardiovascular disease and cancer,
which were predictive of increased CES-D scores, were not
predictive of caseness. Impaired ability to walk across a

room and to bathe oneself were also found to increase the
risk for caseness, as were being female, having lower edu-
cation, having no insurance coverage, and having been hos-
pitalized or having visited a physician more than once dur-
ing the previous year. The interaction between the effects of
gender and immigrant status was again evident.
DISCUSSION
The findings of the present study suggest that many of
the associations between specific chronic conditions and
depressive symptoms in the African American and non-His-
panic White American older populations are also evident
among older Mexican Americans. In bivariate analyses,
significant associations were evident between depressive
symptoms and several specific medical conditions. Associa-
tions with many of these conditions have been reported in
studies of older non-Hispanic Whites and African Ameri-
cans, including diabetes (9), cardiovascular disease (1),
hypertension (12,24), cancer (ll), arthritis (10), kidney dis-
ease (14), and ulcers (2).
The most noteworthy finding evident in the present
study, however, is the particular constellation of specific
chronic medical conditions found to be predictive of
depressive symptoms in multivariate analyses. This cluster
included diabetes, stroke with residual speech problems,
arthritis, cancer, urinary and bowel incontinence, kidney
disease, and stomach ulcers. This constellation differs sub-
stantially from those found predictive of psychological dis-
tress in other studies that employed multivariate analyses.
Specifically, the cluster of conditions found predictive
among older non-Hispanic Whites included arthritis, lung
disease, stroke, cancer, and peripheral atherosclerosis,
whereas cardiac disease, diabetes, and other conditions
were not as predictive (13). The cluster of conditions that
were predictive among older African Americans included
kidney disease, vision problems, and circulation problems
in arms and legs, whereas heart disease, hypertension, dia-
betes, arthritis, lung disease, stomach problems, and hear-
ing problems were not predictive (14). Certain of these con-
ditions, such as lung disease, were not reported at all by the
older Mexican Americans.
The presence of functional disability was also found to
be predictive of depressive symptoms in this population,
consistent with reported findings for other ethnic elderly
groups (4,5, i2). Our findings indicate, however, that among
this group of elders, the influence of functional loss on psy-
chological distress appears to be limited to specific disabili-
ties: Only impaired ability to walk across a room or to
bathe oneself proved predictive in multivariate analyses
which controlled for the presence of the specific chronic
conditions and functional disabilities. Furthermore, the
addition of functional disabilities had very little effect on
the diseases found predictive of depressive symptoms.
Indeed, the odds ratios for individual functional disabilities
decreased substantially from the bivariate to the multivari-
ate analyses, unlike the odds ratios for the individual
chronic medical conditions. For example, the odds ratio for
the impaired abilities to dress and transfer decreased from
2.65 and 2.42 in bivariate analyses to 0.91 and 0.74 in mul-
tivariate analyses.
We were surprised to find that stroke and hip fracture,
conditions generally recognized as having substantial func-
tional consequences and often found associated with
depressive symptoms in the elderly (1,13,25), were not pre-
dictive of psychological distress in older Mexican Ameri-
cans, when controlling for the presence of other conditions.
Indeed, only stroke accompanied by residual speech prob-
lems proved predictive of depressive symptoms in this sam-
ple (Table 2). This difference may be explained, in part, by
the time passed since the diagnosis, as well as a lack of
residual problems. All but one of the reported diagnoses of
stroke in our sample occurred more than one year prior to
the interview, and over 76% occurred more than two years
earlier. In addition, over 40% of those who had suffered
strokes reported experiencing no residual problems. Simi-
larly, only one of the reported diagnoses of hip fracture
occurred more than one year prior to the interview, and
over 83% occurred more than two years earlier.
Several investigators have proposed that the relationship
between medical conditions and depressive symptoms may
differ according to the nature of disease (1). It has also been
suggested that the association between depression and
chronic illness may be mediated through reduced social
functioning and inability to maintain self-sufficiency that
can result from restricted physical activity (2). In the case
of stroke and hip fracture, it is possible that these older
Mexican Americans weje less disabled at the time of inter-
view in comparison to other elderly groups. In addition,
they may be more likely to have recovered substantial phys-
ical and social functioning, as a result of a greater availabil-
ity of social support. Over 55% of this sample were cur-
rently married, over 78% lived in households of two or
more people, over 82% reported having a confidant, and an
average of five living children were reported; these propor-
tions are substantially higher than typically reported by
samples of older African Americans and non-Hispanic
Whites (6,14,19). This increased availability of support
may help to speed recovery from conditions such as stroke
or hip fracture, or lessen the loss of functioning.
It might also be argued that those individuals with stroke
and hip fracture who suffered more severe functional
deficits could not participate in our survey. We did find sig-
nificantly higher rates of both these conditions among our
proxy respondents (who were excluded from the present
analyses) than among our regular interviews. However, we
also found significantly higher rates of diabetes, cardiovas-
cular disease, and kidney disease among our proxy respon-
dents, conditions which did prove predictive of depressive
symptoms in our analyses.
It has been postulated that activity restriction may exert
its influence on psychological well-being by causing low-
ered perceptions of personal control and self-esteem (26) or
by reducing social contact and support (3). Rodin and
Voshart (27) also noted that fear, loss of self-esteem, nega-
tive body image, and a sense of uncertainty, as well as nega-
tive effects on employment status and interpersonal relation-
ships that may result from physical illness or decreased
functioning, may increase the risk for depressive symptoms.
This may help to explain the substantially higher rates of
depressive symptoms found in the older Mexican Ameri-
CHRONIC DISEASES AND DEPRESSIVE SYMPTOMS M193
cans, in comparison to rates typically reported for older
African Americans and non-Hispanic Whites (4,5,6,17).
Specifically, part of the increased risk may be due to the
higher prevalence of the specific chronic health conditions
that are associated with substantial physical impairment in
this elderly group, such as diabetes, kidney disease, arthri-
tis, and incontinence.
It could be argued that depressive symptoms may be the
result of biologic processes occurring as a direct result of
these conditions. In studies of diabetes, for example, an
increase in depressive symptoms has been found associated
with increased glycosolate hemoglobin Ai (28). However,
the increase in blood glucose concentrations appears to be
due to poor glucose control that results from depression
(29), rather than a direct result of diabetes. Furthermore,
depression also appears to be associated with both in-
creased reporting of clinical symptoms in diabetics and an
increased perception of distress, suggesting a heightened
sensitivity or vulnerability to the effects of the disease.
Similarly, the increased depression often found among
individuals who suffer from kidney disease, arthritis, and
incontinence appears to be the result of decreased mobility
and pain. Stomach ulcers also are associated with substantial
pain and discomfort. All these conditions can be character-
ized as chronic stressors causing reduced activity and lower
self-esteem. Indeed, many of these conditions may be par-
ticularly associated with the activity limitations most associ-
ated with depressive symptoms: impaired ability to walk
across a room or to bathe oneself. This suggests that it may
be the consequences of these conditions rather than the con-
ditions per se that contribute to depression in older adults.
Several authors have postulated that Mexican Americans
may be more likely to report depressive symptoms (particu-
larly somatic items) than non-Hispanics (30-32), thus
bringing into question the validity of the higher symptom
rates. In the present study, the somatic items in the CES-D
were no more frequently reported than in other groups of
elders (33,34). An absence of positive emotional state, how-
ever, as measured by the four positive affect items in the
CES-D, was much more likely to be reported by these older
Mexican Americans than other depressive items, suggesting
some response bias. Although these items are often more
frequently reported by Mexican Americans (35), they are
also among the most frequently reported items and are
often the items with the highest nonresponse rates among
other ethnic groups (33,34). Factor analysis of the CES-D
data indicated that these well-being items form a clear fac-
tor (36). Coupled with comparable response rates for these
items in other studies of older Mexican Americans (35),
this suggests that rather than response bias, symptoms such
as hopelessness about the future, self-deprecation, unhappi-
ness, and lack of enjoyment are important aspects of psy-
chological functioning for Mexican Americans. Parallel
analyses comparing the Hispanic EPESE data with data
from the other EPESE studies may help to address both the
higher symptom rates and the differences in the associated
chronic medical conditions found in this study.
Certain limitations to the present study should be noted.
First, the study employed cross-sectional data, precluding
any assumptions concerning causality. We cannot say with
certainty that the specific conditions, or subsequent func-
tional limitations, that are associated with depressive symp-
toms in this population are actual causes. Neither can we
conclude that psychological distress exacerbates physical
health conditions. Unlike Parkinson's disease and stroke,
which have been found to have specific etiological links
with depression (37), the conditions most strongly associ-
ated with depressive symptoms in these older Mexican
Americans have generally not been established as etiologic
factors for depression, aside from that of general decline in
health. Continued analysis of longitudinal data from subse-
quent waves of the Hispanic EPESE will help to clarify
some of the causal relationships between these phenomena.
A second limitation to the present study is its reliance
only on self-report of depressive symptomatology, not clini-
cal diagnosis. Several studies have found that persons with
high levels of self-reported depressive symptoms are at
much greater risk for depression one or more years later,
suggesting that they reflect a long-term or recurring psy-
chological distress (38). Data from the second wave of the
Hispanic EPESE should help to clarify this issue, as diag-
noses based on structured interview schedules (39) will be
available for both lifetime and 6-month prevalence of major
depression and dysthymia.
Despite these limitations, the strength of this study lies in
the evidence it provides for the relationship of chronic
health issues, functional disability, and psychological dis-
tress among older Mexican Americans. It has been sug-
gested that depressive symptoms may increase the risk of
noncompliance to medical treatment or may weaken the
immune system, thus increasing the risk for complications
and greater severity of disease among individuals with
chronic medical conditions (40,41), and increasing the risk
for mortality (42). More importantly, treatment of several
conditions, such as diabetes, as well as reductions in func-
tional disabilities, have been associated with improvements
in depressive status (43). Increased awareness of the strong
associations between specific chronic conditions, functional
impairments, and depressive symptoms in older Mexican
Americans can help physicians and other clinicians better
address concomitant depression and physical illness, partic-
ularly illness that is accompanied by functional declines.
Because of the size and representative nature of our sam-
ple, these findings can be generalized to the older Mexican
American population residing throughout the Southwest.
Our results indicate that a large proportion of older Mexi-
can Americans (as many as 135,000) suffer from substantial
levels of depressive symptoms that are associated with two
areas with the potential for intervention: physical health
and functional disability. Beyond this minority group, the
present study adds to our understanding of the complex
interrelationships between physical, functional, and mental
health in all older adults, indicating the strength of the role
played by chronic conditions and functional limitations in
the relationship between physical and mental health.
Addressing these interrelationships could extend the inde-
pendent survival of older Mexican Americans, as well as
older adults in general, by improving compliance, prevent-
ing excess mortality and morbidity, and improving the dis-
tribution of health care services.
