This study, drawing on a nationally representative sample of community-dwelling adults aged
70 and older from the second wave of the Asset and Health Dynamics Among the Oldest Old
(AHEAD) survey, addresses the need for greater information on advance care planning among
older adults. Older persons expect to draw on a diverse array of persons to make health care
decisions for them when they are unable to do so, including spouses, when available, as well as
younger generation members such as children and grandchildren. Completion of advance
directives such as living wills and durable powers of attorney for health care was more
common among White respondents than among African American respondents, and among
high school­ and college-educated respondents compared with those with less than a high
school education. The results suggest the need to develop interventions aimed at strengthening
knowledge and understanding of advance directives, particularly for African Americans and
persons with lower levels of educational attainment. They further suggest the need for more
research on the factors related to informal communication between older adults and their
family members on issues related to advance care planning.

The growth of sophisticated life-sustaining medi-
cal technology, combined with greater attention to
medical care at the end of life, has resulted in in-
creasing attention to issues related to advance care
planning (Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs,
American Medical Association, 1992). These issues
are particularly relevant for the growing number of
older adults in the United States and their family
members, who face increasingly complex choices re-
lated to initiating, withholding, and terminating med-
ical treatments (Diamond, Jernigan, Moseley, Mes-
sina, & McKeown, 1989; Heynor, 1998; Zweibel &
Cassel, 1989).
Growing attention has been paid in recent years to
advance directives, documents that allow persons to
designate their preferences for medical care in the
event that they are unable to communicate these
wishes at some time in the future. Advance directives
have been developed as a mechanism for enhancing
the rights of individual patients, clarifying patient
preferences for medical care, and protecting both pa-
tients and surrogate decision makers from legal liabil-
ity for health care decisions at the end of life (Cole &
Holstein, 1995). One type of advance directive, the
living will, allows persons to specify in writing their
preferences for medical care. The other type of ad-
vance directive, the durable power of attorney for
health care (DPAHC), is a legal document that allows
persons to designate a person to make medical deci-
sions for them if they are unable to do so. The Patient
Self-Determination Act, which took effect in 1991,
requires hospitals, nursing homes, and home care
agencies to inform patients of their right to accept or
refuse medical care and to complete an advance di-
rective, to document the existence of advance direc-
tives, and to implement policies and procedures on
advance directives for patients and staff (LaPuma,
Orentlicher, & Moss, 1991). However, despite such
efforts, few older persons have actually completed
advance directives, and the proportion of adults com-
pleting them ranges from 4%­20% across various
studies (Hoefler, 1997).
Although few persons complete advance direc-
tives, greater numbers of persons engage in informal
discussions with family members concerning health
care preferences (Elpern, Yellen, & Burton, 1993). In
fact, one reason that people give for not completing
an advance directive is that they feel that they can
rely on others, particularly family members, to make
health care decisions for them if they are unable to
do so (High, 1994). Family members, because of
their long-standing relationships and knowledge of
the older person's values and preferences, are often

in a unique position to bridge communication gaps
between the patient and the health care team, com-
municate knowledge of the older person's values and
preferences, and provide needed emotional support
(Jecker, 1990). Older persons, faced with the pros-
pect of complex medical decisions, usually expect
that family members will make medical decisions for
them if they are unable to do so (High, 1994). More-
over, health care providers often consult with the
families of older persons in such situations (High &
Rowles, 1995), a practice that affirms the importance
placed on the role of family members as surrogate
decision makers by legal experts and by society as a
whole (Cole & Holstein, 1995).
Although a number of studies have examined the
factors that predict the likelihood of advance direc-
tive completion (Eleazer et al., 1996; Elpern et al.,
1993; Levin et al., 1999; Stelter, Elliot, & Bruno,
1992), no existing studies have examined the factors
that predict informal discussions on matters concern-
ing health care preferences. In order to better identify
those older persons most in need for intervention and
counseling on issues related to advance care plan-
ning, more information is needed on how and under
what circumstances older persons communicate health
care preferences to those who are close to them (High,
1994). There is also little information available con-
cerning the preferences of older adults for specific
types of family members as informal surrogate decision
makers or as a formally appointed DPAHC. Most states
have policies that give a high priority to family members
as substitute health care decision makers, but little in-
formation is available concerning the extent to which
these priorities fit with the actual preferences of older
persons for family decision makers (High, 1987).
Most existing studies examining issues related to
advance care planning have included study participants
in inpatient or outpatient hospital settings, and the find-
ings may not be generalizable to the United States
population as a whole. There is a particular need for
information on advanced care planning among com-
munity-based, nonclinical samples of older adults
(Marshall & Levy, 1990). Information from a repre-
sentative sample of older adults in the United States
is needed in order to identify the preferences of older
persons for surrogate decision makers and the factors
related to both formally executed advance directives
and informal discussions concerning medical prefer-
ences in the event of decisional incapacity.
This study examines the preferences of a sample of
community-dwelling older persons for informal sur-
rogate decision makers, as well as the factors that
predict the likelihood of communicating medical
care preferences through both informal discussions
and formally designated advance directives. The spe-
cific research questions are as follows:
1. Whom do community-dwelling older persons
trust to make health care decisions for them if
they are unable to make such decisions them-
selves, and how do these preferences vary by
marital status and the presence of living children?
2. Whom do older persons appoint as DPAHCs and
how do DPAHC appointments vary by marital sta-
tus and the presence of living children?
3. What is the role of demographic factors and health
status in predicting the likelihood of informal dis-
cussion of health care preferences?
4. What is the role of demographic factors and health
status in predicting the likelihood of designating
health care preferences through formally designated
advance directives, including living wills and
DPAHCs?
Background
Preferences of Older Persons for Health Care
Decision Makers
The hierarchical compensatory model (Cantor,
1979) suggests that older people have a hierarchical
preference for support and assistance from family
members and turn to nonfamily members only when
familial sources of support are unavailable. The model
further suggests that older people have a particular
preference for support from spouses, when available,
followed by children and other relatives. Consistent
with this theoretical perspective, studies suggest that
spouses provide the most comprehensive care for
older persons (Tennstedt, Crawford, & McKinlay, 1993),
that children are the most frequently chosen helpers for
those without spouses (Penning, 1990), and that older
persons turn to nonfamily members such as neighbors
and friends only when familial sources of assistance
are not available (Cantor, 1979).
Very little research is available concerning the ap-
plicability of the hierarchical compensatory model to
the preferences of older persons for informal medical
surrogate decision makers. One of the few studies to
examine this issue was conducted based on a survey
of 40 residents of Fayette County, Kentucky (High,
1988). Consistent with the hierarchical model, this
study found that married persons were most likely to
designate a spouse as the person they would want to
make the final decision about health care if they were
too sick to do so; among those who were widowed,
children were most often designated. Only those
who did not have available family members chose
nonrelatives such as friends, doctors, and lawyers.
Additional work, based on larger and more representa-
tive samples than those available in the High (1988)
study, are needed in order to further test the applica-
bility of Cantor's hierarchical model to the prefer-
ences of older persons for surrogate decision makers.
Factors Related to Completion of Advance Directives
Existing studies have focused on the role of socio-
demographic and health factors as predictors of ad-
vance directive completion. A study based on analysis
of medical records from the Program for All Inclusive
Care of the Elderly (PACE) found that African American
patients were significantly less likely than White patients
to complete a DPAHC (Eleazer et al., 1996). Another
study, based on surveys of older adults attending nu-
trition sites, found that White participants were sig-
451
Vol. 40, No. 4, 2000
nificantly more likely than non-White participants to
indicate that they planned on completing a living will
in the future (Stelter et al., 1992). Advance directive
completion has also been found to be associated
with higher rather than lower levels of educational
attainment (High, 1993; Stelter et al., 1992). Some
evidence suggests that race and educational level ap-
pear to have independent effects on durable power of
attorney appointment, because African Americans
are less likely to complete a DPAHC than Whites
even after controlling for education (Eleazer et al.,
1996). Completion of advance directives has also
been found to be higher among persons in older age
groups compared with younger age groups (Elpern et
al., 1993; Levin et al., 1999) and among those with
lower self-reported health status compared with
those with higher self-reported health status (Elpern
et al., 1993).
Despite the importance of family members in sur-
rogate decision making, relatively few studies have
examined the role of family structure on the likeli-
hood of completing advance directives. Although
one study found no significant difference by marital
status in the likelihood of completing advance direc-
tives (Elpern et al., 1993), most other studies have not
included marital status as an explanatory factor. Con-
sistent with the hierarchical compensatory model,
married persons might prefer to bypass an advance
directive because of a belief that their spouse already
knows their medical care preferences, and because
the close and continual proximity of spouses pro-
vides greater opportunities for informal discussion of
preferences for medical care. Persons who are not
married, in contrast, may be less certain that their
children and other family members know their health
care preferences, and may therefore seek formal ad-
vance directives as a means of ensuring that their
medical care preferences are clearly communicated.
Factors Related to Informal Discussion of Health
Care Preferences
By far the most common method of communicat-
ing health care preferences is through informal com-
munication with family members or other informal
network members. A study of clinical outpatients at
an academic medical center found that more than
half (65%) had discussed with someone how they
wished to be treated if they became critically ill. Of
these persons, 55% had discussed these matters with
family members and 18% had discussed them with
friends, while only 7% had engaged in discussions
with physicians (Elpern et al., 1993). Even though in-
formal discussion is the most common means of
communicating health care wishes, very little is known
about the likelihood of actually engaging in such dis-
cussions.
Sociodemographic and health factors, which have
been shown to predict the likelihood of completing
advance directives, may also be associated with the
likelihood of engaging in informal discussions. In
particular, African Americans and persons with lower
levels of education may be less likely to have informal
discussions about health care preferences, whereas
persons with lower self-rated health status may be more
likely to engage in informal discussions because they
perceive a greater need to communicate their prefer-
ences for health to those who are close to them. Be-
cause the marital relationship is usually characterized
by close and continual proximity between spouses
(Litwak, 1985), married persons are likely to have
greater opportunities for informal discussion of health
care preferences. In contrast, persons who are not
married are not likely to have the same opportunities
for informal discussion.
Methods
Sample
This study is based on public release data (Version
1.0) from the Asset and Health Dynamics among the
oldest-old (AHEAD) study conducted by the Univer-
sity of Michigan Institute for Survey Research. The
AHEAD study is based on a representative sample of
older persons (born in 1923 or earlier) living in the
continental United States, and residing outside of in-
stitutional settings at the time of the first wave of
the study, which was conducted in 1993 and 1994
(Myers, Juster, & Suzman, 1997). Almost all of the
younger respondents (those born between 1914 and
1923) were selected based on a multistage area prob-
ability sample from a screening of household units
originally conducted for the Health and Retirement
Study (HRS). For older respondents (those born in
1913 or earlier), a dual sampling frame was used to
obtain data on frail older persons who might not oth-
erwise be included based on a multistage screening.
Half of the respondents in these older age groups
were obtained through list samples from the enroll-
ment database, a subset of the Medicare Beneficiary
Survey, while half were obtained through the same
HRS screening process used for the younger respon-
dents (Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, & Wallace, 1997).
The sample for this study consists of 520 persons
who were aged 70 and older at the time of the first
wave of the AHEAD study, and who were subse-
quently selected as respondents to an experimental
module as part of the second wave of the AHEAD
study conducted in 1995. The experimental modules
are given to a random selection of respondents and
are designed to provide preliminary data on areas of
interest to researchers where there are few valid mea-
sures or well-developed research hypotheses (Soldo
et al., 1997). The module used for the present study
consisted of a series of questions concerning advance
care planning and preferences for health care deci-
sion makers.
The characteristics of the study sample are shown in
Table 1. The majority of the sample was female (62.6%),
White (90.7%), and between 70 and 80 years of age
(63.1%). Approximately one third (32.0%) had less
than a high school education, half (50.6%) had a high
school education, and roughly one fifth (17.4%) had
a college education or higher. Approximately one tenth
(11.4%) reported excellent health status, while slightly
452 The Gerontologist
more than one fourth reported their health as very good
(25.9%) or good (33.2%). Approximately one fifth
(20.6%) reported fair health status, while a smaller
number (8.9%) reported poor health status. Slightly
fewer than one half (44.3%) were married and had living
children, while roughly two fifths (39.3%) were not
married (widowed, divorced, or separated) and had liv-
ing children. Fewer were married with no living children
(7.0%) or not married with no living children (9.4%).
Measures
The dependent measures for this study include: (a)
preferences for surrogate health care decision mak-
ers; (b) preferences for DPAHC; (c) completion of a
living will; (d) completion of a DPAHC; and (e) infor-
mal discussion of health care preferences. Prefer-
ences for surrogate health care decision makers are
based on a question in which respondents were
asked, "Is there someone that you would trust to
make health care decisions if you could not make
them for yourself?" Those who answered yes to this
question were asked, "Who would that be?" Poten-
tial response categories include spouse, child/child-
in-law/grandchild, other relative, friend, physician/
healthcare professional, minister/rabbi/priest/religious
advisor, attorney, social worker, and "other." Re-
spondents were instructed to choose as many categories
as they wished.
Preferences for DPAHCs are based on questions in
which respondents who reported having a DPAHC
were asked to indicate whom they had appointed as
a DPAHC and their relationship to this person. Poten-
tial response categories are identical to those for the
question concerning surrogate decision makers. How-
ever, respondents were allowed only one response
category for this question.
Completion of a living will is based on the ques-
tion, "Do you have written instructions about the
type of medical treatment you would want to receive
if you were unconscious or somehow unable to com-
municate?" Completion of a DPAHC is based on the
question, "Have you made legal arrangements for
someone to make decisions about your care or medi-
cal treatment if you became unable to make deci-
sions yourself? This is sometimes called a Durable
Power of Attorney for Health Care." Those who an-
swered affirmatively to the first question were coded as
having a living will (1  yes), and those who answered
affirmatively to the second question were coded as
having a DPAHC (1  yes).
Informal discussion of health care preferences is
based on a question asked of persons who indicated
that they had someone they would trust to make
health care decisions. Those respondents who an-
swered affirmatively to this question were asked,
"Have you talked with (this person/these persons)
about what type of care you would want if you
couldn't make decisions for yourself?" A dichoto-
mous variable is constructed to represent whether re-
spondents reported having informal discussions of
health care preferences (1  yes, 0  no).
Sociodemographic and health factors that previ-
ous studies have identified as predictors of comple-
tion of living wills and DPAHCs are used on the re-
gressions predicting completion of these types of
advance directives and are also used as predictors of
the likelihood of engaging in informal discussions. Race
is measured as a dichotomous variable (1  African
American, 0  White). Age is based on a series of
dummy variables representing ages 75­79, 80­84,
and 85, with the youngest age group (aged 70­74)
as the reference group category. Education is based
on dummy variables representing high school and
college education, and less than high school is the
omitted reference category. Self-rated health status is
based on a five point scale (1  poor, 5  excellent).
In order to investigate the possible impact of family
structure on the dependent variables, three dummy
variables are used to represent marital status and the
presence of living children. The dummy variable cat-
egories include not married with living children, married
with no living children, and not married with no living
children. Married with living children is the omitted
reference category.
Analytic Strategy
To address the first research question concerning
preferences for health care decision makers, fre-
quency tables are computed on the percentage of re-
spondents mentioning preferences for different types

of decision makers (e.g., spouse, child/child-in-law/
grandchild, other relative, nonrelative), and on the
percentage of persons who mention both spouse and
child/child-in-law/grandchild as decision makers. Fre-
quency distributions are computed separately for per-
sons with different family configurations, including
married and living children, married and no living
children, not married and living children, and not
married and no living children. To address the sec-
ond research question concerning preferences for
DPAHC, similar frequency tables are constructed to
indicate the category of persons who are appointed
as DPAHC for those respondents who indicate that
they have a DPAHC (n  137). For the analysis for
both research questions, sample weights are used to
provide correct national-level estimates for the fre-
quency distributions.
To address the third and fourth research questions,
three logistic regressions are used to predict: (a) the
likelihood of having a living will; (b) the likelihood of
having a DPAHC; and (c) the likelihood of having an
informal discussion of health care preferences. For all
of the logistic regressions, sociodemographic factors
(age, race, education, and marital status) and self-
rated health status are used as predictors in the
model. In addition to the use of sample weights, the
survey estimation programs in the Stata statistical
program (Stata Corp., College Station, TX) are used to
compute correct standard errors and associated sig-
nificance levels for the logistic regressions (Eltinge &
Sribney, 1996).
Results
As shown in Table 2, the vast majority of respon-
dents (95.0%) indicated that they had someone they
trusted to make health care decisions if they were un-
able to do so. However, fewer than half (48.8%) had
talked with such persons about their preferences for
medical care in such situations. The majority of re-
spondents (62.8%) did not have advance directives.
Approximately one tenth had living wills (9.1%) or
DPAHCs (8.2%), while one fifth (19.9%) had both
types of advance directive documents.
Data pertaining to the first research question,
which concerned whom older persons would trust to
make health care decisions for them if they were un-
able to make such decisions for themselves, are
shown in Table 3. Respondents were instructed to re-
port all persons whom they would trust to make med-
ical decisions for them if they were unable to do so,
and the table shows the proportion of respondents
mentioning specific categories of persons as trusted
decision makers. Among married persons with living
children, younger generation members were the most
commonly mentioned (71.9 %), with a smaller num-
ber mentioning spouses (58.5%). Among married
persons who did not have living children, spouses
were most commonly mentioned as those they would
trust (72.0%), while approximately one third (29.8%)
mentioned younger generation members. Among un-
married persons with living children, the vast majority
mentioned younger generation members as trusted
decision makers (95.8%), with smaller percentages
mentioning other relatives (3.7%), nonrelatives (4.6%),
or spouses (1.8%). Among unmarried persons who
had no living children, other relatives were the most
commonly mentioned decision makers (71.4%), while
one fifth (19.7%) mentioned nonrelatives.
Table 4 presents the types of persons appointed as
DPAHCs. Among married persons with living children,
choices for a DPAHC were approximately equally di-
vided between spouses (45.6%) and younger genera-
tion members (48.5%), with a smaller number (6.0%)
indicating other physicians or other health care pro-
viders. Among persons who were married with no
living children, only half (51.0%) appointed a spouse
as a DPAHC, followed by younger generation members
(31.9%), other relatives (7.6%), and attorneys (9.5%).
In contrast, among those who were not married, but
had living children, the vast majority chose younger
generation members as DPAHCs (96.6%), while only
a small number (2.3%) chose other relatives. Among
unmarried persons with no living children, other rela-
tives were most commonly selected as DPAHCs
(60.9%), followed by friends (24.9%), younger gener-
ation members (10.1%), and attorneys (4.0%).
The results of the logistic regressions predicting the
likelihood of completing living wills and DPAHCs
are shown in the second and third columns of Table 5.
Completion of living wills and DPAHCs was lower
among African American respondents compared with
White respondents (p  .05). Compared with those
with less than a high school education, persons with
a high school education were more likely to complete
a living will (p  .001). Compared with those with less
than a high school education, persons with a college
education or higher were more likely to complete a
living will (p  .01) and more likely to complete a
DPAHC (p  .01). Compared with persons who were
married and had living children, those who were not
married and had living children were significantly
more likely to have a living will (p  .05) and to have a
DPAHC (p  .001).
The fourth column of Table 5 shows the results of
the logistic regression predicting the likelihood of
having an informal discussion of health care prefer-

were significantly related to the likelihood of report-
ing an informal discussion.
Discussion
The results from this study indicate that the hier-
archical compensatory model proposed by Cantor
(1979), which has most commonly been used to ex-
amine the preferences of older persons for care and
support, is partially applicable to the preferences of
older persons for health care decision makers. Con-
sistent with previous research, which finds that chil-
dren are the most frequently chosen helpers for per-
sons without spouses (Penning, 1990), unmarried
persons with living children were most likely to se-
lect younger generation members as potential health
care decision makers. Among persons with neither a
spouse nor a living child, other relatives were most
commonly chosen as both trusted health care deci-
sion makers and DPAHCs. In contrast, relatives other
than a spouse or younger generation member were
rarely chosen as preferred decision makers by those
who had a spouse or who had living children. Con-
sistent with the hierarchical compensatory model,
these findings suggest that older persons tend to se-
lect spouses and younger generation members as po-
tential surrogate decision makers, and turn to other
relatives and nonrelatives only when these close fam-
ily members are not available.
Findings concerning the preferences for trusted de-
cision makers and appointments of DPAHC among
married persons with living children are less consis-

tent with the hierarchical compensatory model. The
model suggests that spouses, when available, should
be the most commonly chosen decision makers for
older persons. However, among respondents with
both spouses and living children, members of the
younger generation (children, children-in-law, and
grandchildren) were more likely than spouses to be
mentioned as persons they would trust to make
health care decisions. Moreover, approximately one
third of married persons with children selected both
spouses and younger generation members as those
they would trust to make decisions. Furthermore,
among married persons with living children who had
made a DPAHC appointment, members of the younger
generation and spouses were selected in roughly
equal proportions as DPAHCs. Taken together, these
findings suggests that many older persons expect to
move beyond exclusive reliance on spouses when
making health care decisions in the future.
Although previous research suggests that the pri-
mary providers of care for older persons are spouses,
the results from this study indicate that members of
the younger generation (children, children-in-law,
and grandchildren) are frequently mentioned as those
whom older persons would trust to make health care
decisions and to serve as DPAHCs. One explanation
for these findings is that most caregiving tasks require
close and continual proximity to the older person,
and such proximity is typically provided by spouses
rather than by younger generation members (Litwak,
1985). Younger generation members may be more
available as health care decision makers, because
this is likely to be a short-term role and typically does
not require ongoing and continual proximity to the
older person. Consistent with this view, previous re-
search suggests that older persons anticipate that
members of the younger generation will make them-
selves available for consultation and discussion on
health care matters even if they are not in close geo-
graphical proximity to the older person (High, 1987).
Older persons may also anticipate that their spouses
will be deceased or incapacitated themselves at the
time that such health care decisions are needed, and
that members of the younger generation will there-
fore be better able to communicate with the health
care system regarding their needs and preferences.
Consistent with previous research, this study found
a higher likelihood of advance directive completion,
including both living wills and DPAHCs, among
White respondents compared with African American
respondents. A number of factors have been pro-
posed to explain the lower level of advance directive
completion among African Americans, including dis-
trust of the medical system, previous experience of
being denied medical care, and a consequential fear
that advance directives are a means of preventing
them from receiving medical care to which they are
entitled (Eleazer et al., 1996). With the advent of
managed care, many health care providers have ad-
vocated advance directives are a way of potentially
limiting the use of expensive health care procedures
at the end of life. However, there has not been a cor-
responding emphasis on the potential of advance di-
rectives as mechanisms for ensuring that those pa-
tients who want to receive the most extensive care
possible are able to do so. Because studies suggest
that African Americans are more likely to prefer medical
treatments that prolong life (Carlais, Davis, Wright, &
Marcial, 1993; Eleazer et al., 1996), greater encour-
agement of the use of advance directives as a means
of either prolonging or limiting medical care at the
end of life may encourage greater use of these docu-

ments. Interestingly, no significant racial differences
were found in the likelihood of engaging in informal
discussion of health care preferences. This finding
suggests that, although many African Americans are
reluctant to complete advance directives, they may
be more open to the possibility of engaging in infor-
mal discussions of health care preferences.
Like previous studies (e.g., Stelter et al., 1992), this
study found a greater rate of advance directive com-
pletion among those with higher rather than lower
levels of educational attainment. Many older persons
have difficulty understanding the technical language
in written material on advance directives (Gamble,
McDonald, & Lichstein, 1991), and those with lower
levels of education are likely to need additional inter-
ventions in order to promote greater knowledge and
use of these documents. One strategy is the use of
one of the many educational videos that have been
developed in recent years to explain and promote the
use of advance directives (Foundation for Informed
Medical Decison Making, 1998; Herb & Dubler,
1990; Daitz, Ulene, & Gibson, 1994). Many of these
videos, in addition to providing clear explanations of
advance directive documents, include stories by
older persons and their family members in which
they recount actual experiences of making health
care decisions on behalf of the older persons who
were unable to participate. These videos, which can
be used in outpatient clinics, community-based gath-
erings, or in an older person's own home, may be
particularly useful for older persons who have diffi-
culty reading and understanding the written materials
on advance directives that are most commonly avail-
able in health care settings.
This study found that both informal discussion of
health care preferences and completion of formal ad-
vance directives were more common among unmar-
ried persons who had living children than among
married persons with children. Married persons may
assume that their spouses know their health care
preferences, while unmarried persons may recognize
the importance of direct communication of health
care wishes through informal discussion and/or ad-
vance directives. Alternatively, children of married
older persons may not engage in informal discussions
of health care preferences or encourage completion
of advanced directives because they assume that
such issues will be discussed between their parents.
Furthermore, children of older persons may not feel
that it is necessary or appropriate to discuss these is-
sues if parents' spouses are available. Greater recog-
nition is needed by health care providers of the im-
portant role played by the younger generation in
making health care decisions for older persons. Prac-
titioners should make greater efforts to include younger
generation members in discussions concerning health
care decisions and advance care planning.
Several limitations of the current research should be
noted. A first limitation is that the category "younger
generation member" includes several types of family
members, including children, children-in-law, and
grandchildren. The greater number of potential persons
included in the younger generation category increases
the likelihood that younger generation members will
be chosen as either health care decision makers or
DPAHCs. Because of the way in which the questions
concerning children are coded in the AHEAD module
used for this study, it is not possible to specify prefer-
ences for different types of younger generation members
(e.g., child, grandchild, stepchild). Such data are needed
in order to obtain more information about the prefer-
ences of older persons for health care decision makers.
A second limitation is that the data are based on
self-reports of older persons concerning advance di-
rective completion. No data is available concerning
whether advance directives have been documented
according to legal guidelines in individual states, or
the extent to which they are accurately recorded and
available to health care providers. Because respon-
dents were asked about the presence of "written in-
structions" but not specifically about living wills, it is
possible that some advance directives documented in
this study consist of informal written instructions rather
than formally executed living wills.
A third limitation of this study is that the data are
based on self-reports of informal discussions of health
care preferences. Some evidence from research on
elderly parent­adult child dyads suggests that adult
children are more likely to report having such discus-
sions than are older persons themselves (Cicirelli,
1992). Because adult children were not asked a si-
milar set of questions in the AHEAD survey module,
it is not possible to examine the extent of congruence
between reports of older persons and their adult chil-
dren concerning whether informal discussions have
taken place.
The results of this study suggest a number of po-
tential areas for future research. First, more research
is needed on the factors that predict the likelihood of
having informal discussions of health care wishes in
the event that older persons are unable to make such
decisions for themselves. As in previous studies (Elpern
et al., 1993), this study found that informal communi-
cation was the most common means of expressing
health care preferences. However, more information
is needed on the factors that predict the likelihood of
engaging in such discussions. Race and educational
attainment, which have been found to be predictive
of advance directive completion in previous studies,
were unrelated to informal discussion, suggesting the
need for additional examination of factors that facilitate
or impede informal discussion. Such factors may in-
clude the role of health beliefs, the extent of contact
with the medical care system, and perceptions of the
abilities and competencies of various family members
on issues related to medical decision making. In ad-
dition, more research is needed on the types of issues
covered in these informal discussions, as well as the
context and process by which these conversations
are initiated with family members and other potential
health care surrogates.
In future studies, it would be useful to have an ad-
ditional question in which respondents are asked to
indicate the person they would most prefer to make
457
Vol. 40, No. 4, 2000
health care decisions if they were unable to do so
themselves. In this study, the preferences of older
persons for health care decision makers were defined
in terms of whom they would trust to make health
care decisions. Respondents were not specifically
asked to indicate their hierarchical preferences for
health care surrogates and were instead instructed to
list all potential categories of persons (e.g., spouse,
child, relative) whom they would trust to make such
decisions. Such information would be useful in better
determining whether the health care preferences of
older adults are consistent with the hierarchical model.
More research is also needed concerning the process
by which older persons make decisions regarding health
care decision makers and their reasons for choosing
particular family members as surrogates.
More information is also needed on the extent of
informal discussion concerning health care prefer-
ences in the event of decisional incapacity. The con-
versations could be quite limited, consisting of a
passing remark about "not wanting to be a vegetable,"
or could be extensive, covering specific kinds of medi-
cal interventions that are desired or not desired under
particular circumstances. It may be that education
and race, which were not significantly related to in-
formal discussions in the present study, may be related
to the likelihood of engaging in these more extensive
informal discussions of health care preferences.
Finally, this study has focused on expectations and
planning among community-dwelling elders on is-
sues related to end-of-life care. More information is
needed on how informal discussions and advance di-
rectives are used to inform decision making at the
end of life, based on documentation of the actual ex-
periences of family members coping with the death
of an older family member. Data on these issues can
provide valuable information on how best to educate
and assist older persons on issues related to advance
care planning in ways that are consistent with indi-
vidual needs and preferences.
