Introduction
Taiwan has the third highest incidence rate and the highest
prevalence rate of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the
world.1 The high prevalence and incidence of ESRD not
only burdens healthcare resources but also has a major
impact on patients and their families. ESRD is a multifacto-
rial and polygenic disorder predisposed by genetic, envi-
ronmental and lifestyle factors.2 Among the predisposing
genetic factors, disruption of the renin­angiotensin system
(RAS) is clearly associated with the development of
ESRD.3,4
RAS is a key regulator of both blood pressure and kid-
ney function and may play a role in their interaction.
Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) is a key enzyme in
the RAS and has been widely used for association studies
on ESRD. ACE is a carboxyl terminal dipeptidyl exopepti-
dase that converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II. ACE2,

Abstract
Background: Several polymorphisms in the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) and ACE2 genes are associated with
the development of end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Certain genetic polymorphisms may modify the deleterious effects
of environmental factors such as cigarette smoking and may also modify the inherited risk. We investigated the associa-
tion of six ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms with ESRD to determine whether a relationship exists between gene­smoking
interactions and ESRD.
Materials and methods: We performed a case-control association study and genotyped 683 ESRD patients and 653 healthy
controls. All subjects were genotyped for ACE (I/D, G2350A and A-240T) and ACE2 (G8790A, A1075G and G16854C) gene
polymorphisms by polymerase chain reaction­restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP) analysis.
Results: Significant associations were observed between ACE I/D and G2350A polymorphisms and ESRD. There was
no difference in ACE2 genotype distribution between ESRD patients and healthy controls. Haplotype analysis showed
that DAA and DAT haplotypes were risk factors for ESRD. Moreover, a gene­environment interaction was observed
between ACE I/D polymorphism and cigarette smoking.
Conclusion: ACE I/D and ACE G2350A polymorphisms were associated with the development of ESRD. The interac-
tion between ACE I/D polymorphism and smoking is also associated with an enhanced risk of ESRD.

a homologue of ACE, is a monocarboxypeptidase that pref-
erentially removes carboxy terminal amino acids from vari-
ous substrates, including Ang II, Ang I and apelin.
Approximately 42% of residues in the catalytic domain of
ACE2 are also present in endothelial ACE.5 Recent studies
have shown that ACE2 is also a key modulator of RAS in
renal diseases.6,7 Several recent studies have identified
mutations and polymorphisms in ACE and ACE2 genes
that affect host susceptibility to a range of diseases includ-
ing hypertension,8 myocardial infarction,9 type 2 diabetes
mellitus,10 diabetic nephropathy,11 and ESRD.12 Some stud-
ies have also indicated that single nucleotide polymor-
phisms (SNPs) in ACE and ACE2 genes can alter
homeostasis to an abnormal state.13,14
Smoking is a known risk factor for the development and
progression of ESRD;15,16 however, little is known of the
effects of smoking exposure on genetic variants influencing
kidney traits in the general population. Moreover, the exact
mechanism by which ACE and ACE2 polymorphisms
affect ESRD progression is unclear. We hypothesized that
interactions between multiple genetic variants of ACE and
ACE2 and smoking status are associated with ESRD.
Therefore, in this study, we investigated the association of
ACE and ACE2 gene polymorphisms, and interactions
between these gene polymorphisms and smoking status,
with ESRD susceptibility.
Material and methods
This case-control study included 683 ESRD patients (368
females and 315 males; mean age 64.27 ± 14.69 years)
visiting the Cardinal Tien Hospital and five haemodialysis
centres in Taipei, Taiwan. The enrolled patients were sta-
ble (without clinical complications), aged over 20 years
and had undergone haemodialysis (HD) for more than 6
months. Patients with autoimmune diseases, malignancy
and acute or chronic infections were excluded. The cause
of ESRD was diabetes mellitus in 295 patients (43.2%),
chronic glomerulonephritis in 184 patients (27.0%), hyper-
tensive nephropathy in 83 patients (12.2%), systemic
nephropathy in 64 patients (9.4%) and unknown in 57
patients (8.2%). The study also included 653 healthy con-
trol subjects (381 females and 272 males; mean age 65.79
± 13.59 years) from the Center of Physical Examination of
the Cardinal Tien Hospital, with an estimated glomerular
filtration rate (eGFR) of  60 ml/min/1.73 m2 and no pro-
teinuria. The healthy controls had no kidney damage, pro-
teinuria, haematuria or abnormalities on abdominal
ultrasonography. Clinical information and biochemical
parameters were obtained retrospectively from hospital
records. The study was reviewed and approved by the
institutional ethical committee of the Cardinal Tien
Hospital (CTH-100-3-5-025). Written informed consent
was obtained from all participants after giving them a
complete explanation of the study.
Cigarette smoking
Cigarette smoking status (current, former, never) was
ascertained at the time of enrollment. Individuals who had
not smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetime were
classified as never-smokers, based on common conventions
in epidemiologic research.17 Former smokers were those
who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes in their lifetimes
but did not currently smoke.18 Current smokers were
defined as those who had smoked more than 100 cigarettes
in their lifetimes and still smoked at the time of the survey.
Current and former smokers were grouped together in the
smoker's group, and their data were compared with those
of individuals in the never-smoker's group to determine the
effect of smoking on development of ESRD.
Genomic DNA extraction and
genotyping
Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood sam-
ples by standard procedures with proteinase K (Invitrogen,
Carlsbad, CA, USA) digestion and phenol/chloroform
extraction.19 The ACE [I/D (rs1799752), G2350A (rs4343)
and A-240T (rs4291)] and ACE2 [G8790A (rs2285666),
A1075G (rs1978124) and G16854C (rs4646142)] polymor-
phisms were screened using polymerase chain reaction­
restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP).
Primers were designed using published sequences20 or
primer Z software (http://genepipe.ngc.sinica.edu.tw/prim-
erz/beginDesign.do). The PCR program included the fol-
lowing steps: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed
by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 s, annealing at
58°C for 30 s and extension at 72°C for 30 s, and a final
extension at 72°C for 10 min. The PCR products were
digested with the respective restriction endonucleases (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA), and the resulting
fragments were separated by electrophoresis on a 3.0% aga-
rose gel containing 0.5 g/mL ethidium bromide at 100 V and
visualised under UV light. Genotyping was performed by
blinding the case or control status. Two independent investi-
gators interpreted the pictures from each gel, and all ambig-
uous samples were analysed twice. To validate genotyping
results, at least 10% samples were randomly selected for
repeated genotyping.
Statistical analysis
For each SNP, deviation from the Hardy­Weinberg equilib-
rium (HWE) was assessed using the standard 2 test.
Genotypic and allelic frequencies were compared between
ESRD patients and healthy controls using the 2 test or
Fisher's exact test, when appropriate. The demographics
were evaluated using Student's t-test for continuous varia-
bles and expressed as mean ± standard deviation (SD).
Logistic regression analysis was used to estimate the crude
Yang et al. 205
and adjusted (age, gender, body mass index and smoking)
odd ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) as
measures of association with the risk of ESRD. Linkage dis-
equilibrium (LD) and haplotype analyses were performed
using Haploview software (http://www.broad.mit.edu/mpg/
haploview/).21 The interaction was tested using a term of the
product of two variables in a multiple logistic regression
model. All statistical analyses were performed using SPSS
18.0 for Windows (SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA). A p value
<0.05 was considered statistically significant.
Results
Basic characteristics of the study population
Table 1 shows the characteristics and biochemical and clin-
ical data of the studied individuals. No significant differ-
ences were observed in gender, age and diastolic blood
pressure between ESRD patients and healthy controls.
However, the two groups showed a significant difference
with respect to other variables (p<0.05).
Association analyses of ACE and ACE2 gene
polymorphisms with susceptibility to ESRD
The genotype distributions of ACE (I/D, G2350A and
A-240T) and ACE2 (G8790A, A1075G and G16854C)
genes were compatible with the Hardy­Weinberg expecta-
tion for both cases and controls (p>0.05). This indicates
that the study subjects were representative of the study
field. The genotypic and allelic distributions of the three
SNPs in the ACE gene and their association with ESRD
risk are shown in Table 2. The genotypic and allelic distri-
butions of ACE I/D polymorphism were significantly dif-
ferent between the ESRD cases and healthy controls
(p<0.05). In ACE I/D polymorphism, when the II genotype
was used as the reference, ID and DD genotypes were asso-
ciated with a higher risk of ESRD development (adjusted
OR 1.38, 95% CI 1.07­1.79, p=0.01 and adjusted OR 1.59,
95% CI 1.07­2.37, p=0.02, respectively). The association
between ACE G2350A polymorphism and ESRD risk
showed borderline significance, with heterozygous and
mutation carriers being at a higher risk of developing ESRD
(adjusted OR 1.46, 95% CI 1.30­2.07, p=0.05 and adjusted
OR 1.31, 95% CI 1.01­1.71, p=0.04, respectively). ACE
A-240T polymorphism showed no significant genotypic
and allelic associations in either ESRD patients or healthy
controls (p>0.05).
As the ACE2 gene is on the X chromosome, data for
each gender were analyzed separately. The genotypic and
allelic frequencies ofACE2 polymorphisms between ESRD
patients and healthy controls are shown in Table 3. For
males, the allelic frequencies of ACE2 polymorphisms
(G8790A, A1075G and G16854C) showed no significant
difference between ESRD patients and healthy controls
(p>0.05). No associations were observed between ESRD
and ACE2 polymorphisms in females.
Haplotype analysis of ACE
The haplotype analysis of ACE polymorphisms in ESRD
patients and healthy controls is shown in Table 4. The fre-
quency of haplotype DA was 0.24 in ESRD patients com-
pared with 0.14 in healthy controls (OR 2.01, 95% CI
1.60­2.53). In addition, haplotypes DAA and DAT were
more common in ESRD patients (0.13 and 0.11, respec-
tively) than in healthy controls (0.08 and 0.06, respectively)
giving an OR of 1.79 and 1.98, respectively (95% CI 1.33­
2.40 and 1.43­2.72, respectively). Other haplotypes showed
no significant change.
ACE gene­smoking interaction analysis

Discussion
In this study, we investigated the association of ACE and
ACE2 gene polymorphisms with ESRD and showed that
ACE I/D and G2350A gene polymorphisms were signifi-
cantly associated with ESRD. Our study also presents sta-
tistical evidence of significant association between ACE
I/D SNP and smoking status interaction and the risk of
developing ESRD. These findings support our hypothesis
thatACE gene polymorphisms and potential gene­smoking
interactions may contribute to ESRD susceptibility.
Previous studies showed that the ACE I/D polymorphism
was expressed phenotypically by significant variations in
ACE serum levels, with DD individuals having the highest
levels.22 The increased level of ACE is associated with the
pathogenesis of renal disease. ACE I/D polymorphism has
been studied extensively in relation to ESRD23,24; however,
the findings of these studies remain controversial. Previous
studies have indicated that a significant association exists
between the DD gene and ESRD risk in Caucasians25,26 and
East Asians27,28; however, this association is not observed in
the Turkish population.29 Our results are consistent with those
of studies in Caucasians and East Asians, which indicate that
the ACE DD genotype is associated with a significantly ele-
vated risk of ESRD. This suggests the presence of a geogra-
phy- or ethnicity-specific difference in the ACE gene and the
association of gene polymorphisms and ESRD risk.
Several studies have reported that serum and plasma
levels of ACE are influenced by ACE G2350A30 and
A-240T31 polymorphisms. In this study, we also found an
association between ACE G2350A polymorphism in a Han
Chinese population; however, no association was observed
with ACE A-240T polymorphism. Carriers of the A allele
of ACE polymorphism were more frequent in the patient
group than in the control group. Our results are consistent
with those of previous studies, which indicate that the ACE
2350A allele is associated with a significantly elevated risk
of chronic kidney disease (CKD) and hypertension in the
Han Chinese population.
Many genes of the RAS pathway have been assessed for
their associations with ESRD. However, research on the
ACE2 gene is limited. The ACE2 gene is located on the
Xp22 chromosome, contains 18 exons and is mainly
expressed in the kidney. The ACE2 gene has been impli-
cated in kidney disease, hypertension and cardiac func-
tion.32 Previous studies have also shown that expression of
the ACE2 gene is altered in the diabetic rat kidney33 and in
humans with renal diseases.34 This suggests that an associa-
tion exists between ACE2 gene variants and ESRD.
However, no associations were observed between ESRD
and ACE2 gene polymorphisms in this study. ACE2 poly-
morphisms may have a small effect on susceptibility to
ESRD, but we were unable to detect such an effect.
The biological consequences of gene­smoking interac-
tions have been investigated extensively over recent years.
Smoking is one of the established risk factors of ESRD, but
its exact pathogenesis has not yet been clarified. Several
studies have already reported that smoking status may
influence the effects of the ACE genotype on peripheral
arterial disease (PAD)35 and endothelial function.36 In the
present study, the interaction between ACE I/D polymor-
phism and cigarette smoking had an additive effect on the
risk of developing ESRD. Smokers with the variant geno-
type (ACE DD) had the highest risk of developing ESRD.
Our results are consistent with those of previous studies.
Butler et al. reported a significant blunting of the endothe-
lial function in DD carriers, especially in smokers.37
Another study showed that the D allele was associated with
increased systolic blood pressure in smokers.38 Sayed-
Tabatabaei et al. showed a combined effect of smoking and
the ACE gene on intima media thickness (IMT), with a sig-
nificant increase in the mean carotid IMT in current smok-
ers carrying the D allele.39
Several studies indicate that high levels of LD exist
across the ACE gene.40,41 Haplotype analysis performed in
a previous study showed an association between the ACE
haplotype and major depressive disorder.42 Wetmore et al.
showed that the ACE haplotype is associated with survival
in a cohort with prevalent ESRD.43 Our data showed that
ESRD patients carrying the DAA or DAT haplotype had a
higher risk of developing ESRD than those not carrying
these haplotypes. To test the potential of the genes high-
lighted by haplotype research more completely, a follow-up
study that explores the role of haplotypes on genetic sus-
ceptibility to ESRD might be desirable.
In conclusion, this case-control study in a Han Chinese
population showed that ACE I/D and G2350A polymor-
phisms may modulate the risk of development of ESRD. No
association was observed between ACE2 polymorphism
and ESRD susceptibility. ACE polymorphism and smoking
interactions confer an increased risk of developing ESRD,
indicating that ACE gene polymorphisms might identify
smokers who are more susceptible to ESRD. However,
these results must be confirmed in future studies.
