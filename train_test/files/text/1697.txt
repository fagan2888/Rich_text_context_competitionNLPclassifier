OBJECTIVE -- Perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs) have been used worldwide in a variety of
consumer products. The effect of PFCs on glucose homeostasis is not known.
RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS -- We examined 474 adolescents and 969
adults with reliable serum measures of metabolic syndrome profile from the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey 1999­2000 and 2003­2004.
RESULTS -- In adolescents, increased serum perfluorononanoic acid (PFNA) concentrations
were associated with hyperglycemia (odds ratio [OR] 3.16 [95% CI 1.39­7.16], P  0.05).
Increased serum PFNA concentrations also have favorable associations with serum HDL choles-
terol (0.67 [0.45­0.99], P  0.05). Overall, increased serum PFNA concentrations were in-
versely correlated with the prevalence of the metabolic syndrome (0.37 [0.21­0.64], P  0.005).
In adults, increased serum perfluorooctanoic acid concentrations were significantly associated
with increased -cell function ( coefficient 0.07  0.03, P  0.05). Increased serum perfluo-
rooctane sulfate (PFOS) concentrations were associated with increased blood insulin (0.14 
0.05, P  0.01), homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance (0.14  0.05, P  0.01),
and -cell function (0.15  0.05, P  0.01). Serum PFOS concentrations were also unfavorably
correlated with serum HDL cholesterol (OR 1.61 [95% CI 1.15­2.26], P  0.05).
CONCLUSIONS -- Serum PFCs were associated with glucose homeostasis and indicators of
metabolic syndrome. Further clinical and animal studies are warranted to clarify putative causal
relationships.

The perfluoroalkyl chemicals (PFCs)
are a family of perfluorinated chem-
icals that consist of a carbon back-
bone typically 4­14 carbons in length
and a charged functional moiety (1). PFCs
have been used extensively since the
1950s in commercial applications, such
as inclusion as a component in surfac-
tants, lubricants, paper and textile coat-
ings, polishes, food packaging, and fire-
retardant foams (2). Some of these PFCs,
including the most widely known exam-
ples, perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) and
perfluorooctane sulfate (PFOS), persist in
humans and the environment and have
been detected worldwide in wildlife (2).
The routes of human exposure to PFCs
are currently being investigated. Possible
exposure pathways that are being exam-
ined include drinking water, dust in
homes, and food or migration from food
packaging and cookware. Animal studies
have shown that these compounds are
well absorbed orally but are poorly elim-
inated; they are not metabolized and
undergo extensive uptake from enterohe-
patic circulation and are distributed
mainly to the serum, kidney, and liver (1).
Although some PFCs have been voluntar-
ily removed from the market by manufac-
turers, PFOA and PFOS and their
derivatives are still produced commer-
cially, and the potential risk to humans
continues to be evaluated.
In animal studies, exposure to PFOS
and PFOA is associated with adverse
health effects, including carcinogenicity
(3,4), hepatotoxicity (4,5), and develop-
mental and reproductive toxicity (4). For
humans, PFC exposure has been shown
to be associated with certain types of can-
cers (6). Maternal exposure to PFOS and
PFOA also has been linked to low birth
weight (7).
The causal biochemical mechanisms
leading to the adverse health outcomes
after exposure to PFCs are largely un-
known. However, recent studies using
advanced technologies in genomics and
bioinformatics have shown that several
categories of genes are commonly altered
by some PFCs including those for peroxi-
some proliferation, fatty acid metabolism,
lipid transport, cholesterol synthesis, pro-
teosome activation and proteolysis, cell
communication, and inflammation (1).
The agonistic properties of PFCs on per-
oxisome proliferator-activated recep-
tors- [PPAR-] are well supported and
are thought to be a major mechanism
leading to PFC-mediated liver damage
(8,9). Because activation of PPAR- can
decrease serum triglycerides, normalize
LDL cholesterol, and increase HDL cho-
lesterol, we hypothesized that PFCs might
have favorable effects on lipid homeosta-
sis and may also be associated with re-
duced insulin resistance, an improved
serum lipid profile, and lower prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome. The goal of
the present study was to test this hypoth-
esis by examining data from the National
Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES) collected from 1999­2000
and 2003­2004.

RESEARCH DESIGN AND
METHODS -- Data were from
NHANES 1999­2000 and 2003­2004.
The NHANES is a population-based sur-
vey designed to collect information on the
health and nutrition of the U.S. house-
hold population and to obtain a represen-
tative sample of the noninstitutionalized
civilian U.S. population. The survey data
are released every 2 years. Detailed survey
operations manuals, consent documents,
and brochures of the NHANES 1999­
2000 and 2003­2004 are available on the
NHANES Web site (10).
We limited our analyses to the 3,685
participants at least 12 years of age who
had a blood test for PFCs. Among these
subjects, only 1,788 subjects had a morn-
ing examination and had fasting plasma
glucose, insulin, and triglyceride data
available. Of these 1,788 participants, we
included the 1,443 subjects without miss-
ing data for further analyses.
Anthropometric and biochemical
data
According to the statements on the
NHANES Web site, data were collected at
all study sites by trained personnel fol-
lowing standardized procedures. Socio-
demographic information such as age,
sex, race/ethnicity, education level, and
household income was collected during
the household interview. Alcohol intake
was determined by the questionnaire ("in
any one year, have you had at least 12
drinks of any type of alcohol beverage?")
and was dichotomized. For adolescents,
because there were too many missing
data, alcohol intake was not entered for
analysis. Smoking status was categorized
as active smoker, former/passive smoker,
and nonsmoker by the smoking question-
naire and serum cotinine levels as de-
scribed previously (11). Laboratory
measurements were performed in a mo-
bile examination center. Weight and
height were measured using standard
methods and digitally recorded. Three
and sometimes four blood pressure deter-
minations were collected by a physician
using a mercury sphygmomanometer.
Blood pressure was measured in the right
arm unless otherwise specified. Averaged
systolic blood pressure (SBP) and dia-
stolic blood pressure (DBP) were ob-
tained. Blood specimens were processed
locally and then stored and shipped to
central laboratories for analysis. Levels of
serum total cholesterol and triglycerides
were measured enzymatically. Levels of
HDL cholesterol were measured after pre-
cipitation of other lipoproteins on a Hitachi
model 704 analyzer (Roche Diagnostics, In-
dianapolis, IN). Serum C-reactive protein
(CRP) levels were measured by latex-
enhanced nephelometry. Plasma insulin
was determined by an immunoenzymo-
metric assay. Insulin resistance status (ho-
meostasis model assessment of insulin
resistance [HOMA-IR]) and -cell function
were estimated by the updated homeostasis
model assessment (HOMA2) (12).
Definition of metabolic syndrome
For subjects 18 years old, presence of
the metabolic syndrome was calculated
by sex as defined by the National Choles-
terol Education Program Adult Treatment
Panel III (13) guideline of presenting with
at least three of the following qualifica-
tions: waist measurement 88 cm for
women and 102 cm for men; serum
triglycerides 1.69 mmol/l; serum HDL
cholesterol 1.03 mmol/l in men and
1.29 mmol/l in women; SBP 130
mmHg or DBP 85 mmHg or a self-
report of taking antihypertensive medica-
tions; and fasting glucose 6.10 mmol/l
or a self-report of taking antihyperglyce-
mic medications. To define the metabolic
syndrome among the young participants
aged between 12 and 17 years, we used a
previously proposed modification of the
definition proposed in the National Cho-
lesterol Education Program Adult Treat-
ment Panel III. The participants had to
meet three of the following five criteria:
serum concentration of triglycerides
1.24 mmol/l; HDL cholesterol 1.04
mmol/l; waist circumference more than
or equal to the sex-specific 90th percen-

perglycemic medications (15), and SBP or
DBP more than or equal to the age-,
height-, and sex-specific 90th percentile
or a self-report of taking antihypertensive
medications (16).
Assessment of serum PFCs
As part of NHANES, serum samples of
PFOA, PFOS, perfluorohexane sulfonic
acid (PFHS), and perfluorononanoic acid
(PFNA) were collected for analysis. The
analytical method has been described in
detail (17). In brief, without protein pre-
cipitation, only dilution with 0.1 M for-
mic acid, 1 aliquot of 100 l serum was
injected into a commercial column switch-
ing system allowing for concentration of the
analytes on a C18 solid-phase extraction
column. This column was placed automat-
ically in front of a C8 analytical high-
performance liquid chromatography
column for chromatographic separation
of the analytes. Detection and quantifica-
tion were done using negative-ion Turbo-
IonSpray ionization tandem mass
spectrometry. Isotope-labeled internal
standards were used for quantification.
Statistics
Data are expressed as means  SEM. Par-
ticipants were divided into adolescents
(12­20 years of age) and adult (20 years
of age) groups for analysis. The strength
of the associations between concentra-
tions of various serum PFCs and blood
glucose, insulin, and HOMA-IR levels was
tested using multiple linear regression
models. Logistic regression analyses were
conducted to examine the odds ratios
(ORs) of metabolic syndrome (yes or no
for having at least three components of
metabolic syndrome) and its components
(yes/no for that component) associated
with a 1 unit increase in log PFCs. Log
transformation was performed for variables
with significant deviation from normal dis-
tribution before further analyses. For linear
regression, we used an extended model ap-
proachforcovariateadjustment:model1
age, sex, and race; model 2  model 1 
health behaviors (smoking status, alcohol
intake, and household income); and
model 3  model 2  measurement data
(waist measurement, CRP, and insulin/
glucose/HOMA)  current medications
(antihypertensive, antihyperglycemic,
and antihyperlipidemic agents). For lo-
gistic regression, the models for adjust-
ment were as follows: model 4  age, sex,
race, health behaviors (smoking status, al-
cohol intake and household income),
measurement data (CRP and HOMA/
insulin), and current medications (anti-
hypertensive, antihyperglycemic, and
antihyperlipidemic agents) and model
5  model 4  other components of the
metabolic syndrome. P  0.05 was con-
sidered statistically significant. To avoid
"model-dependent association," the asso-
ciation was considered significant only
when it remained statistically significant
in all models. Sampling weights that ac-
count for unequal probabilities of selec-
tion, oversampling, and nonresponse
were applied for all analyses using the
Complex Sample Survey module of SPSS
(version 13.0 for Windows XP; SPSS, Chi-
cago, IL).
RESULTS -- The basic demographic
characteristics of the participants are
summarized in Table 1. The study sample
consisted of 474 adolescents (aged be-
tween 12 and 20 years) and 969 adults
(age 20 years). The serum PFHS levels
were significantly higher in adolescents
than in adults (log PFHS ng/ml 0.95 
0.10 vs. 0.60  0.04, respectively, P 
0.001), whereas the serum PFNA concen-
trations were lower in adolescents than in
adults (log PFNA ng/ml 0.35  0.07 vs.
0.21  0.07, P  0.001). The serum
PFOA and PFOS concentrations were not
different between these two groups.
The associations between the serum
PFC levels and glucose homeostasis
markers are shown in Table 2. In adoles-

cents, increased serum PFNA concentra-
tions were associated with decreased
blood insulin ( coefficient 0.10 
0.05, P  0.05) and -cell function
(0.12  0.06, P  0.05) with border-
line significance (P  0.05­0.09 in all
models and 0.05 in the final model).
Other PFCs were not associated with the
serum markers for glucose homeostasis.
In adults, increased serum PFOA concen-
trations were significantly associated with
increased -cell function ( coefficient
0.07  0.03, P  0.05). Increased serum
PFOS concentrations were also associated
with increased blood insulin (0.14 
0.05, P  0.01), HOMA-IR (0.14  0.05,
P  0.01), and -cell function (0.15 
0.05, P  0.01).
The associations between the serum
PFCs and the metabolic syndrome/
metabolic syndrome components are
summarized in Table 3. In adolescents,
increased serum PFNA concentrations
were associated with a lower prevalence
of the metabolic syndrome (OR 0.37
[95% CI 0.21­0.64], P  0.005) and
HDL cholesterol below the metabolic syn-
drome criteria (0.67 [0.45­0.99], P 
0.05). Increased serum PFNA concentra-
tions were also correlated with a higher
prevalence of blood glucose above the
metabolic syndrome definition (3.16
[1.39­7.16], P  0.05). We also found
that the serum PFOS (0.37 [0.16­0.82],
P  0.05) concentrations were inversely
correlated with a lower prevalence of
waist circumference than the metabolic
syndrome definition. In adult subjects,
among all the PFCs and metabolic syn-
drome components, only serum PFOS
concentrations were associated with a
higher prevalence of HDL cholesterol be-
low the metabolic syndrome definition
(1.61 [1.15­2.26], P  0.05).
CONCLUSIONS -- To our knowl-
edge, this report is the first to systemically
analyze the link among serum PFC con-
centration, glucose homeostasis, and the
metabolic syndrome/metabolic syndrome
components in a nationally representative
sample. In this study, we showed that
PFCs were differentially associated with
glucose homeostasis in adolescents and
adults. We should consider carefully the
extrapolation and interpretation of data
between laboratory animal studies and
the corresponding biological effects (at
high parts per million range) compared
with general human populations (at low
parts per billion range). We found that the
concentrations reported for PFCs in the
occupational studies have been 2 and 3
orders of magnitude higher than those
measured in the general population. Al-
though there were several studies re-
garding maternal exposure and child

development, worker's exposure, and
health outcome, the relationship of se-
rum PFC levels to medical diseases and
laboratory abnormality in a nationally
representative survey has never been
explored. Our results might suggest that
low-dose PFC exposure may have ef-
fects on glucose metabolism in the gen-
eral population.
Our analysis showed that the serum
PFOA and PFOS concentrations were not
different between adolescents and adults.
Unlike other lipophilic persistent pollut-
ants that display increasing serum con-
centrations as individuals age, the lack of
this general trend in PFOS and PFOA
could be explained by intrauterine trans-
fer, exposure early in life with ongoing
exposures being much higher than earlier
historical exposures, or a combination of
these factors (18). In contrast, the mean
concentrations of PFHS were higher for
adolescents than for adults, as reported
previously (2,19). The higher concentra-
tions of PHFS in children and adolescents
could be related to their increased contact
with carpeted floors containing PFHS,
which is used for specific postmarket car-
pet treatment applications (2,19).
We showed that in adolescents, in-
creased serum PFNA concentrations were
associated with decreased blood insulin,
impaired -cell function (borderline sig-
nificance), and clinical hyperglycemia.
On the other hand, we found that increased
serum PFNA had a favorable correlation
with serum HDL cholesterol. Overall, in-
creased serum PFNA concentrations were
inversely associated with the prevalence of
metabolic syndrome in adolescents. In
adults, serum PFOS concentrations were
independently associated with increases in
both blood insulin and insulin resistance
status (HOMA-IR). Interestingly, both se-
rum PFOA and PFOS were also positively
correlated with -cell function. The balance
between increased insulin resistance and
-cell function has a neutral effect on blood
glucose. Increased PFOS also showed an
unfavorable association with serum HDL
cholesterol in adults. Overall, the PFCs in
the present study had neutral effects on the
prevalence of the metabolic syndrome in
adults.
There has been a great deal of
progress in the last few years in under-
standing the toxicology and distribution
of PFCs in the environment, in wildlife,
and in humans. However, there is a pau-
city of information pertaining to many
specific PFCs (1). Thus far, there are no
published reports of either in vitro or in
vivo data pertaining to effects of PFCs on
glucose homeostasis. The underlying
mechanisms of this linkage are unknown
and might partially be related to peroxi-
some activation. The liver toxicity of
PFOS and PFOA has been linked to their
PPAR- agonist property (8,9). PFNA
also has been shown to be a strong perox-
isomal -oxidation inducer in animals
(20,21). Fibrates, amphipathic carboxylic
acids that activate PPAR-, can decrease
triglycerides, normalize the LDL choles-
terol profile, and increase HDL choles-
terol (22). However, our results are not
entirely consistent with previous animal
findings, suggesting alternative or even
multiple pathways in association among
PFCs, glucose, and lipid metabolism. For
example, Luebker et al. (23) have demon-
strated that both PFOS and PFOA can in-
terfere with the binding affinity of liver
fatty acid­binding protein in rodents. In-
terestingly, they also found that among
the PFCs tested, PFOS exhibited the high-
est level of inhibition of liver fatty acid­
binding protein, which might partially
explain the unfavorable association be-
tween increased serum PFOS and HDL
cholesterol.
Our study has several limitations. First,
the cross-sectional design does not permit
any causal inference. Second, because of
missing data, drinking status was not in-
cluded in our analyses of adolescents.
In summary, we present the first re-
port of a relationship between serum
PFCs, glucose homeostasis, and metabolic
syndrome. Because PFCs have been widely
used worldwide in a variety of consumer
products, further longitudinal clinical and
in vitro studies are urgently needed to
elucidate the putative casual relationships
between PFCs and metabolism.
