Abstract
The temporal dimension of acceptance is under-researched in technology acceptance
research. Yet, people's perceptions on technology use may change over time when
gaining user experiences. Our 6-month home study deploying an interactive robot
provides insight into the long-term use of use interactive technology in a domestic
environment. We present a phased framework for the acceptance of interactive
technology in domestic environments. Based on 97 interviews obtained from 21
participants living in different household types, the results provide an initial validation
of our phased framework for long-term acceptance showing that acceptance phases
are linked to certain user experiences which evolve over time when people gain
experience with the technology. Involving end users in the early stages of development
helps researchers understand the cultural and social contexts of acceptance and enables
developers to apply this gained knowledge into their future designs.

Introduction
Today, only a few studies have investigated the long-term use of technological systems
in home environments; thus, the traditional technology acceptance literature lacks a pro-
found body of long-term research, even despite its extensive history in information sys-
tems research (Taylor and Todd, 1995). However, the development of user experiences
with a technology or gaining user skills might change the user's attitudes toward (Hiltz
and Johnson, 1989; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000), uses of (Majchrzak et al., 2000; Rice
and Rogers, 1980) or even the user's conceptualizations (Rice and Contractor, 1990) of
that technology. While earlier technology acceptance research has mainly focused on
explaining why people initially adopt technologies, only a minority of these studies have
paid attention to what happens in the post-adoption stage. This is where people decide
between continuing and discontinuing the use of the technology. The consideration of
different antecedents for pre-adoption and post-adoption beliefs has been argued for by
earlier researchers (Davis et al., 1992; Rogers, 2003; Thompson et al., 1991). Attitudinal
beliefs are formed based on three types of information: past behavior, affective informa-
tion, and cognitive information (Zanna and Rempel, 1988). A reasonable assumption is
that pre-adoption beliefs are mainly shaped by affect or cognition through indirect expe-
riences with a technology (i.e. by watching others using the technology or via media),
while post-adoption beliefs are mainly created based on past experience (Karahanna
et al., 1999) as well as one's social network (Rice and Ayden, 1991; Rice et al., 1990).
Consequently, beliefs after using a technology may differ from the beliefs that have led
to the initial adoption of that technology. Only when people are willing to continue to use
a technology after initial adoption, one could assume that the acceptance of that technol-
ogy is a success. But even then, one should expect the possibility of discontinuance,
replacement, or unintended negative consequences.
Studying long-term use within people's natural environments, such as domestic envi-
ronments, can provide practical insights into the continuous use of and user experiences
with these systems because these environments are stable and controllable for users. It is
extremely fertile to explore changes in use behavior and user experience over time in
these relatively stable and controllable environments. This article aims to provide insight
into the long-term acceptance process by presenting a phased framework for long-term
acceptance, validate this framework, and to see whether and how a longer, uninterrupted
period of use of interactive technology in a domestic environment affects changes in
long-term use itself, as well as the user's attitudes and behaviors associated with the
long-term use of interactive technologies. Interactive technology refers to products and
services on digital computer-based systems which respond to the user's actions through
a multimodal interface, such as computers, smartphones, video games, and socially inter-
active robots.
A phased framework of long-term acceptance
An alternative approach to the commonly used adoption models (e.g. Davis, 1989;
Venkatesh et al., 2003) in technology acceptance literature is offered by the domestication
theory (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996) and the diffusion of innovations theory (Rogers,
2584 new media & society 20(7)
2003). These theories incorporate a sociological perspective and take on a more ecologi-
cal view on acceptance rather than focusing on the individual-level causal relationships
between factors explaining technology acceptance. While the diffusion of innovations
theory is useful as it explains how technologies are adopted through the concept of rein-
vention (i.e. how they are altered by the user along the way) and the organizational pro-
cesses of structuring (i.e. how the technology and the social structures of the environment
mutually change over time), the domestication theory is more valuable in the ways it
provides insights into the intricate processes whereby the user assigns meaning and sig-
nificance to the artifact, and how this is experienced by domestic users during the acquisi-
tion and consumption of the technology. However, these theories and other existing
phasing of technology acceptance focus on either pre-adoption or post-adoption. Currently,
no theory exists that offers an extensive phasing of the full acceptance process from antic-
ipating the use of a technology and that goes beyond patterns of sustained used. Therefore,
we will combine existing theories on phases of technology acceptance, together with find-
ings from earlier long-term studies on technology use in the home (e.g. Demiris et al.,
2008; Karapanos et al., 2009; Sung et al., 2009, 2010), to present a full process of six
acceptance phases for interactive technologies: expectation, confrontation, adoption,
adaptation, integration, and identification. Although some of these user experience terms
or acceptance phases have been discussed in the literature, this is a first attempt to gener-
ate a sequence of phases that represent the full acceptance process. The described accept-
ance phases in our framework are linked to the user experiences and are not linked to the
phases of technology diffusion as is the case in, for example, Roger's (2003) diffusion of
innovations theory. In the following, we will describe our phased framework of long-term
acceptance and enrich these descriptions with findings from earlier long-term technology
acceptance research. These six phases are analytic concepts, not temporal distinctions
with fixed steps in a particular order. Sometimes the proposed sequence holds, but in other
occasions, the phases occur simultaneously or are reiterated in a feedback. It might even
be that people dropout the sequence all together when they decide to reject the technology
or discontinue its use (De Graaf et al., 2017). The six phases are user experiences regu-
larly observed in the acceptance process of technology. The goal is to understand this
process investigating people's user experiences when anticipating, adopting, and appro-
priating an interactive technology in their own homes.
Expectation phase
In the expectation phase, people learn about the technology, determine its value, and
form expectations and attitudes toward it before they invite the technology into their
homes (Sung et al., 2009, 2010). People seek information about the technology to reduce
uncertainty, which is the most crucial aspect in attitudes and decisions toward adopting a
technology (Rogers, 2003). They want to learn about the purpose of the technology, then
try to understand the functionality of the technology, and finally pursue to provide expla-
nations for its internal processes. After rationalization comes, affection and people will
form their interpersonal attitude toward the technology (Rogers, 2003). This is where
people become emotionally involved with the technology and actively try to gain knowl-
edge about the technology and judges this knowledge. However, people who are
de Graaf et al. 2585
typically unsure are more likely to seek reinforcement in the opinions of others (Rogers,
2003). This may indicate that people who are hesitant to use an interactive technology
are more susceptible to social influence. Another study exploring user experiences with
mobile phones describes an expectation phase, although the researchers call it pre-adop-
tion, in which people anticipate future experiences by establishing expectations
(Karapanos et al., 2009). The expectation phase is all about the anticipation and prepara-
tion of obtaining a technology.
Encounter phase
In the encounter phase, people are encountering the technology in real life for the first time.
This can be in a store, but also when one observes other people who are using the technol-
ogy. It is possible that people have their first trials of using the technology. Most people
prefer having some first trials before starting their actual use of a technology (Rogers,
2003), that is, adopting it. Moreover, this is also the first opportunity for people to reevalu-
ate their prior expectations of the technology and the benefits or user experiences it has to
offer (Hiltz and Johnson, 1989; Venkatesh and Davis, 2000). It might be that the formed
prior expectations do not match with what the technology actually seems to be about. This
is where an expectation gap might occur (Lohse, 2011), and where some people start show-
ing the first signs of not entering the next acceptance phases. All things considered, the
encounter phase is all about the initial first-hand user experiences with the technology.
Adoption phase
The adoption phase contains the decision that leads to the adoption (or rejection) of a technol-
ogy. We emphasize the necessity to make a distinction between the concepts of technology
adoption and technology acceptance. Here, technology adoption is regarded as the initial
decision to buy and start using a technology. In contrast, technology acceptance is a process
that starts with an individual becoming aware of a technology and, ideally, ends with that
individual embracing the technology and incorporating its use in his or her everyday life. In
the adoption phase, people have their first use trials with the technology in their private envi-
ronments (Sung et al., 2009, 2010). However, uncertainty still exists about the expected con-
sequences of the use of the technology. Therefore, people want to learn more about the
technology and are trying to familiarize themselves with it (Karapanos et al., 2009), if they
are still positive about the potential outcomes of technology use. For disruptive technologies,
which demand a notable change of behavior by the user, this understanding of the technology
also represents a distinction between innovators and the early majority adopters since both
groups of users have very different expectations about innovative technologies (Moore, 1999;
Rogers, 2003). In sum, the adoption phase is all about the first exploration of the newly
obtained technology and the decision to initially adopt the technology.
Adaptation phase
The adaptation phase begins directly after the initial adoption, so people are still obtain-
ing their initial user experiences but have a broad idea of what the technology is all
2586 new media & society 20(7)
about. People are still pervaded by feelings of excitement as well as frustration as they
experience novel features and encounter learnability flaws (Karapanos et al., 2009).
People familiarize themselves with the technology, identify any issues or concerns, and
show the technology to others (Demiris et al., 2008; Hiltz and Johnson, 1989). People
will experiment with the technology's complexities and compatibilities in their personal
spaces and make necessary changes to adapt the technology to their personal needs
(Rogers, 2003; Sung et al., 2009, 2010). As people keep being curious about and aware
of the presence of the technology (Demiris et al., 2008) and trying to appropriate the
technology (Majchrzak et al., 2000; Rice and Rogers, 1980; Silverstone and Haddon,
1996), they will finally come to determine reaffirmation of their initial adoption or rejec-
tion of further use (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996; Sung et al., 2009, 2010). All in all, the
adaptation phase is all about exploring the purpose of the technology in their natural
environment and trying to adapt its use to personal (use) preferences.
Integration phase
In the integration phase, people are feeling a functional dependency on the technology
(Karapanos et al., 2009), have created routines of use (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996;
Sung et al., 2009, 2010), and have fully integrated the technology in their everyday lives
(Demiris et al., 2008). During the integration phase, the technology has been changed
or modified by the user (Rice and Contractor, 1990; Rogers, 2003), and the technology
has become meaningful in people's everyday lives (Karapanos et al., 2009). They no
longer notice the presence of the technology in their homes as long as it does not have
their primary attention (Demiris et al., 2008). When the technology allows its users to
personalize this shaping, the probability of long-term acceptance increases (Backer,
2000). However, it could be that the technology in this phase is used differently from
the way it was intended by designers (Rice and Contractor, 1990; Silverstone and
Haddon, 1996). Briefly, the integration phase is all about incorporating the technology
in daily use routines.
Identification phase
In the identification phase, the technology exceeds its functional purpose and becomes
a personal object as people get emotionally attached to it. Users accept the technology
in our everyday lives, it participates in their social interaction, communicates parts of
our self-identity that serve to either differentiate us from others or connect us to others
by creating a sense of community (Karapanos et al., 2009). In this phase, the domestic
environment reconnects with the public values (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996). This
means that the technology can become a tool for making status claims or for expressing
a specific lifestyle to one's social network. Although these factors can also influence
initial adoption, in this phase, the characteristics of these factors are put into practice by
the user through personal and social identification. The personal side of identification,
for example, personalizing it and creating daily routines of use, increases over time. The
social side of identification, for example, enabling self-expression and creating a sense
of community, initially not only decreases but also shows a gradual and sustained
de Graaf et al. 2587
increase (Karapanos et al., 2009). People, again, seek reinforcement for the initial adop-
tion and may even reverse this decision if exposed to conflicting messages about the
technology (Rogers, 2003). However, as people try to avoid or at least reduce a stage of
dissonance. Dissonance is the uncomfortable feeling a person experiences when incon-
gruence occurs between attitude and behavior (Festinger, 1957). This uncomfortable
feeling can be resolved by either altering personal beliefs (e.g. attitude toward the tech-
nology) or performed behavior (e.g. use of the technology). This means that when users
obtain information that argues not to adopt an interactive technology, they will either
advocate reasons why they would continue to use that technology or they will stop
using that technology. Moreover, when people become familiar with a technology, they
become more willing to ignore the shortcomings of that technology (Peters and Ben
Allouch, 2005; Silverstone and Haddon, 1996). During the conformation stage, users
want supportive information that prevents the occurrence of dissonance, and users are
now willing to influence others about this innovation. In short, the identification phase
is all about finding supportive information that approves continuance of use and the
possibility for identify representations.
Design of the long-term home study
The aim of our study was to validate the proposed phased framework for long-term tech-
nology acceptance as described in section "A phased framework of long-term accept-
ance" and to see whether and how a longer, uninterrupted period of use of an interactive
technology in a domestic environment affects changes in long-term use itself, as well as
the user's attitudes and behaviors associated with the long-term use of interactive tech-
nologies. Our goal was to explore people's ordinary routines of technology use and natu-
ral acceptance processes. In addressing this goal, we employed a commercially available
interactive robot. Studying long-term acceptance of an interactive technology with an
existing commercially available domestic robot has both advantages and disadvantages,
which we will address as a limitation in the discussion of our results. However, we pre-
ferred this type of interactive technology over others because we wanted to capture peo-
ple's initial, unprejudiced reactions and experiences without prevalent societal norms
regarding its use. The following sections will provide the details of the method used in
this study.
The interactive robot
The robot used in this study is Karotz (see Figure 1), which is a 30-cm high Internet-
enabled activated smart rabbit-shaped ambient electronic device. Communication occurs
via verbal communication (voice commands), the light-emitting diode (LED) light in its
belly, the moveable ears, and by detecting the presence of other objects nearby. As the
Karotz is permanently connected to the Internet, it is able to react to, transmit, and broad-
cast all types of content available on his network.
Each robot was installed with a basic set of applications, such as daily news broadcasts,
daily local weather reports, favorite radio stations, personalized reminders, and randomly
spoken phrases to make the robot more likely to be perceived as more autonomous and
2588 new media & society 20(7)
animate. This basic set of applications ensured us that the user experience was somewhat
similar among the participants or at least initially as some participants chose to adjust
these applications to their own needs. Besides these basic applications, participants were
free to install additional applications as they thought would be useful or fun for their
households. This process of appropriation is one of the topics of this study and will be
discussed. Except for one, all participants positioned the robot somewhere in their living
room.
Data collection and procedure
The study ran from October 2012 to May 2013 and consisted of six moments of data
collection at the theorized beginning of each of the six acceptance phases as described in
section "A phased framework of long-term acceptance." The timing of the moments for
data collection was adopted from earlier research studying the user acceptance of a robot
in domestic environments (Fernaeus et al., 2010; Fink et al., 2013; Sung et al., 2010). In
total, 21 participants started the study who consented to be part of the interview sessions.
Our research was guided by people's natural interactions with the robot guided by volun-
tary use, and some of the participants stopped using the robot before the end of the pro-
ject. These results on non-use from our long-term study, including reasons for not moving
into the next acceptance phases, are published in a separate paper (de Graaf et al., 2017).
Table 1 shows the distribution of the sample sizes among the acceptance phases.
For the interviews, a representative of the household reported on their own individual
user experiences with some additional questions about the opinion of other household
members. Semi-structured interviews, conducted at the participants' own homes, were
used to obtain detailed user experiences with the robot. Questions were asked about the
following topics: evaluation of the robot (e.g. Can you describe some advantages/disad-
vantages of the robot?), evaluation of the use behavior and acceptance (e.g. How often
have you used the robot in the last period? Do you consider continuing the use of the
robot, why/why not?), user experiences related to and depending on the current accept-
ance phase (e.g. What does a regular day of using the robot look like? Are you still
excited about the robot/Have you become familiar with all aspects of the robot? How
would you compare the robot with other devices in your home? Have you adjusted the
robot to your personal preferences? Do you usually use the robot on similar moments?),
and the sociability and relationship development with the robot (e.g. Can you describe
how you perceive the robot? How are the interactions with the robot similar to/different
Figure 1. The Karotz robot deployed in the participants' homes.
de Graaf et al. 2589
from interactions with other persons? Does the robot seem to have its own will/personal-
ity? Does the robot offer some kind of companionship?).
Data analysis
A total of 97 interviews with the 21 participants were conducted, recorded, and tran-
scribed verbatim with the participants'approval. Each interview was divided into several
sections containing parts of the participants' answers related to one topic. Based on the
detailed descriptions of the acceptance phases presented in section "A phased framework
of long-term acceptance" together with the transcriptions of the interviews, key concepts
regarding user experiences were identified and translated into a coding scheme by the
primary coder. The final coding scheme is presented in an appendix. Next, for each inter-
view section, at least one code from the coding scheme was assigned to each interview
section by the primary coder. Of the 97 interviews, 32 were randomly selected and the
same procedure of applying codes was performed by a second coder. Intercoder reliabil-
ity was substantial with a Cohen's kappa of .73 (Landis and Koch, 1977). In the results,
from every interview transcript, "striking" or "typical" quotes (Hansen et al., 1998) were
selected which illustrated, confirmed, or enhanced our understanding of the acceptance
phases as explained through the emerged user experiences from the coding scheme.
Participants
Participants were recruited with various methods, such as word of mouth, advertising in
public locations, and snowball sampling by asking assigned participants for referrals to
other people who might participate. During recruitment, we tried to balance out the
households' demographic profiles to seek diversity. Therefore, the participants were
divided into four distinct types of homes (see Table 2): younger singles, older singles,
younger couples, older couples, young families (children younger than 12
years old),
mature families (children older than 12years old), and student dorms. Furthermore, to
facilitate the interactions with the robot, participants were required to have at least a
limited working proficiency in either English or German because the Karotz robot did
not provide interactions in Dutch. We compensated our participants who participated
with both the questionnaires and the interviews by allowing them to keep their robot after
study completion.

Results
This section presents the main occurring user experiences in each acceptance phase that
emerged from the interview data. Table 3 presents these user experiences from phase to
phase. The upcoming sections will describe the user experiences for each acceptance
phase in more detail ordered by the frequency in which participants discussed these user
experiences.
Expectation phase
In the expectation phase, people want to know more about the technology and its pur-
poses and therefore seek information about the technology. The participants talked most
about their expectations about using the robot (e.g. anticipation). The participants, not
knowing all the details of the robot yet, tried to image what it would be like to have the
robot in their homes and whether things would change. "It depends on what [the robot]
can do, ... but I don't think it would make any difference [when the robot comes]"--
female, 22, living in student dorm.
Moreover, the participants were preparing for the arrival of the robot (e.g. prepara-
tion). Although this also comes down to thinking about what it would be like to have the
robot, preparation contains more details about specific use scenarios. The participants
tried to prepare themselves for the kind of functionalities the robot had to offer and which
effects that could have on their attitudes toward the robot or their technology use behav-
ior in general. "If [the robot] can provide me with information that I normally look up on
my computer or tablet, then I can keep sitting down. ... I am all about the practical and
convenience"--male, 31, living alone.
Additionally, the participants discussed looking up information about the robot and its
usages (e.g. information seeking). Before the interviews, most participants explained that
they already tried to find information online or that they would prefer more information
about the robot:
I had seen the [recruitment] leaflet in the supermarket. Later I went back to take it with me,
because I wanted to read it all over. But it was gone thus I tried to Google it, but most of
what I found was in English and I did not feel like reading all that. (Female, 57, living
alone)

And, finally, the participants were associating the robot's purposes with other tech-
nologies (e.g. association). Because the participants had never used robot technologies
before, they tried to make sense of it by comparing it to other objects they are familiar
with such as personal computers and smartphones. "I think of it as some type of tool,
media-player like, something from which you can obtain the news or that it could serve
as an alarm clock"--female, 27, living with spouse.

Encounter phase
In the encounter phase, people encounter the technology for the first time. The partici-
pants talked most about the possible benefits of the robot (e.g. recognize benefits). Most
participants perceived the applications of the robot as beneficial, such as the reminders
or the weather forecast. Other participants looked at the bigger picture and explicitly said
that the robot could save them time or that they would not use their computer anymore.
"You don't have to turn on the computer anymore. Because you can push the button and
ask for example for the weather forecast or the news"--male, 24, living alone. A few
participants explained that they perceived some interaction modes as beneficial and
appreciated the lifelike features of the robot.
Moreover, the participants were still anticipating their possible uses of the robot (e.g.
anticipation). They were trying to picture how living with the robot would look like and
explained that only time could tell how it all would work out in the upcoming weeks.
Some participants expected that the robot could become an important part of their lives.
Others discussed how the robot could be of use for their household. "To see what fits me
and how I can incorporate a learning moment together with the children. That kind of
things. It is just a totally different pastime. Just something extra"--female, 32, living
with young family.
Additionally, the participants started to discover how to use the robot (e.g. explora-
tion). Most participants said that, in the upcoming weeks, they would explore the differ-
ent purposes of the robot and would discover how it all works. The participants explained
that they just had to try some features and experience it themselves. Some participants
expected that this would be fun and that the robot could surprise them with what it can
do. "That we discover new stuff over and over again ... and that I am surprised by what
[the robots] is going to do"--female, 38, living with mature family.
While exploring what the robot has to offer, the participants explained that this goes
along with a lot of trying to see what works for them (e.g. trial and error). They were
testing the different available applications, uninstalling those that did not fit, and
explained that some of the applications did not seem to work at all. For some partici-
pants, trying different applications was discussed among family members before going
forward with it. "I still find it a bit difficult how you can install new apps in a proper
manner. For example, I haven't managed to actually hear the weather forecast yet"--
female, 55, living with spouse.
Also, the participants were still associating the robot with other technologies (e.g.
association). Most participants saw the similarities between the applications of the robot
and those of a smartphone or tablet. Other participants took the animated appearance of
the robot into account by comparing the robot with a rabbit or just by acknowledging it
social abilities. "In principle, it is somewhat the same as an iPad or iPhone, but more
humanlike and a little less like an appliance"--female, 27, living with spouse.
Additionally, the participants discussed looking up additional information about the
robot (e.g. information seeking). Most participants tried to Google information about the
robot. Some other participants watched movies on YouTube or talked with others about
the robot to learn what they could do with the robot. Even during the interview, the par-
ticipants were asking me questions about how to use the robot and what kind of things
they could or could not do with it:
de Graaf et al. 2593
I have discussed [the robot] with some colleagues of mine who also have this robot. That was
before I had installed it. And I asked them what I could do with it, what kind of object is it. And
gathered some information from that. (Male, 38, living with young family)
Adoption phase
The adoption phase is where people actually start using the technology in their personal
environment and gain their first serious user experiences with the technology. The par-
ticipants mostly discussed discovering the purposes of the robot and how it works (e.g.
exploration). Where exploration in the encounter phase dealt with intentions to explore
the functionalities of the robot, this time, the participants had some stories about their
first discoveries of the robot. "The next day [after the installation] we have sat down on
the couch with the iPad and looked up what kind of apps there are. Tried it out a bit"--
female, 27, living with spouse.
Moreover, the participants said that they had discussed having the robot with friends
and co-workers (e.g. discuss with others). Especially when visitors came to their house,
the participants liked to show the robot to them and to talk about it. Other participants
also discussed the robot when meeting people outside their homes or some even shared
pictures of the robot on social media. "I have talked a lot about [the robot]. A friend of
mine has a similar robot. It is a nice conversation topic at parties ... Other people are
curious about it, they like it"--male, 32, living alone.
The participants still felt a need to seek more information about (using) the robot (e.g.
information seeking). The information seeking behavior was quite similar to that in the
previous period with the participants rereading the manual or searching the Internet for
ideas of useful applications of the robot. A few participants even asked the researcher for
more information. "I don't think I have seen it all. I think I will look on the internet. I
have seen some homepages from which you could download some apps. I think I will
snoop around to fulfill my needs"--female, 19, living in student dorm.
Additionally, the participants explained that they were trying out several tasks with
the robot and sometimes failed at it (e.g. trial and error). This differed from the trial and
error experiences in the encounter phase as this time the errors were not because of a lack
of user experience but mostly because the robot did not work that well. "That wouldn't
work in the beginning. I was like, haven't I done that right? Then I tried it in the same
menu as the garbage reminder and it worked"--female, 24, living with mature family.
Nonetheless, the participants still acknowledged possible benefits of having the robot
(e.g. recognize benefits). This time, the participants particularly welcomed the informa-
tion provided by the robot and the remembrance function. Using the robot seemed to
save time for some participants, while others appreciated the robot's reminding them to
take out the trash or catch the bus on time. "It is just easier to use [the robot] as an alarm
clock and for listening to music ... And asking for today's weather forecast to the robot.
I used to do that on my mobile phone, but that takes longer"--female, 22, living in stu-
dent dorm.
Finally, the participants were trying to adjust how the robot should be handled with suc-
cess (e.g. adjustment). The participants experimented with some personal settings on the
robot and tried to adjust their behavior to better interact with the robot. Some participants
2594 new media & society 20(7)
said they were learning to better understand what the robot says. Other participants felt they
must adjust, make everything work better such as moving the robot to a different spot,
switching it off when leaving the house, or silence it when it is time for bed. "[The robot]
was annoying at night, because it made noise. But I have learned that I can make him be
quiet"--male, 31, living alone.
Adaptation phase
In the adaptation phase, users have a broad idea of what the technology is all about. Yet,
the participants were still mainly exploring how to use the robot (e.g. exploration). This
time, for the participants, exploration is more in terms of being sure that they have dis-
covered all the possibilities the robot offers. "I still have the feeling that I haven't, that I
can install more functions on [the robot]. I haven't tried it all yet"--female, 57, living
alone.
Additionally, most participants explained that the novelty effect had begun to fade
away (e.g. familiarization). The participants were becoming familiar with what the robot
does. They learned how to set the robot and the robot had no more surprises for them. "A
little bit of astonishment ... when it first arrived here ... But that is getting used to, that
is just a habituation process"--female, 57, living alone.
Also, the participants have appropriated the robot to fit their needs (e.g. personaliza-
tion). They have adjusted the setting according to their needs. Some participants installed
some additional spoken words into the robot, for example, to make it greet them at cer-
tain times. Other participants reduced the social features of the robot to a minimum. A
few participants programmed the robot in such a way that it would turn on the radio, the
news, or the weather forecast at set times. "I have programmed [the robot] to automati-
cally provide the weather forecast in the morning and evening"--male, 32, living alone.
Yet, the participants were still associating the purposes of the robot with those of other
technologies they use (e.g. association). However, this time, they focus more on the dif-
ferences between the robot and other technologies instead on the similarities, which was
more the case during the adoption phase. "The robot is a bit like a connection ... more
interactive than a radio or smartphone"--female, 22, living in student dorm.
Moreover, some participants were adapting the robot to make it part of their everyday
lives (e.g. incorporation). They used the robot for purposes for which they used other
technologies before, such as listening to music on the robot instead of on the radio. Other
participants integrated the (uses of) the robot into daily routines, such as listening to
weather forecast every morning or making the use of robot part of their daily activities.
"I used to turn on the juke box or the radio on my laptop or on the television, but I use
the robot for that now"--male, 24, living alone.
Furthermore, the participants were still taking to others about the robot and its pur-
poses (e.g. discuss with others). The robot still causes some family discussions or when
visitors come to the house and want to know more about the robot after they noticed it.
And a few participants want to share their experiences on social media. Finally, the par-
ticipants still realized that the robot has potentials (e.g. recognize benefits). Especially
the diversity of use, the reminders and the social aspects were evaluated as a benefit.
However, some participants indicate that the true benefits of the robot will only become
de Graaf et al. 2595
visible after further improvement or they point to other types of use for which the robot
could be beneficial. "I think [the robot] is a supplement to our household... I like it that
he reminds us of things ... And that he says funny things"--female, 24, living with
mature family.
Integration phase
In the integration phase, a used technology has become meaningful in a person's life. The
robot had no more surprises (e.g. familiarization) for the participants in the integration
phase. The participants explained that they have explored all the options of the robot and
picked their favorites.Also, the participants were no longer continuously aware of the fact
that the robot was there and the novelty was completely gone by now. "In the beginning
[the robot] attracts a lot of attention and that is lovely too. And now ... you are not fully
conscious of him anymore. It becomes normal"--female, 32, living with young family.
Moreover, the robot had become part of the participants'everyday lives (e.g. incorpo-
ration). The usage of the robot has become a fixed set of activities. The participants were
using the same applications on a regular basis or replaced other home technologies with
one of the robot's functionalities:
For the radio, I already had [the robot] switched on. And that hasn't changed. And I use the
alarm clock once and a while when I must get out of bed. I actually use it for the same things
again and again. (Male, 24, living alone)
Yet, the participants were still adapting the robot to their personal preferences (e.g. per-
sonalization). The participants explained that they kept changing the settings for some of
the applications or installed additional applications to make better use of the robot. It was
really about selecting the right set of applications that best suit their needs. "I have pro-
grammed [the robot] to automatically provide the weather forecast in the morning and
evening"--male, 32, living alone. But, adapting the robot also entails changing its
appearance with the supplementary set of ears or the stickers the participants received at
times of the installation. "I have used those [the extra set of ears]. Because I liked the
black ones more than the white ones"--female, 19, living in student dorm.
Nevertheless, the participants were already creating their daily use routines with the
robot (e.g. use routine), despite the ongoing alteration of the settings. For some partici-
pants, the robot has become a part of their morning rituals or the use of the robot has
become a special moment during the day. "There is a pattern in it. It might be that the
exact time differs, but that won't be much. I basically do the same things at a certain
time"--male, 55, living alone.
Moreover, the participants still discussed the possible benefits of the robot (e.g. rec-
ognize benefits). This time, with the rejecters of the robot having left the study, the
remaining participants were more positive about the benefits of the robot. They appreci-
ated several functionalities of the robot, such as the radio and the reminders, which had
made changes in the everyday lives of the participants. "Listening to the radio, installing
some stuff to be a reminder that he says out loud. It is a very useful object once and a
while"--female, 32, living with young family.
2596 new media & society 20(7)
And the participants had begun to think about possible new applications of the robots
(e.g. reinvention). The participants seem to agree that especially the reminder function if
the robot is most beneficial. And some participants put the effort into thinking about or
even making some first attempts in creating new applications for the robot. "I have
downloaded the software [to create new apps]. I want to try to create a third group for the
audio ... for people who has difficulties to read. Audiobooks, that could be useful"--
male, 55, living alone.
Identification phase
In the identification phase, a technology exceeds its functional purpose and becomes
a personal object. The participants were fully accustomed to the robot (e.g. familiari-
zation). They knew what the robot had to offer and how they could make use of that.
However, familiarization was not always something positive at this point. For some
participants, it resulted in boredom and they expected that the robot would offer
some new applications. "I have seen and used most programs already ... For me it is
more like a toy and at a certain point it becomes boring"--female, 22, living in stu-
dent dorm.
Moreover, some of the participants continued to talk about the possible benefits the
robot provides them (e.g. recognize benefits). These participants who discussed the
potentials of the robot were positive about the advantages the robot had offered.
Surprisingly, most participants explained that it was not the robot's utility that they indi-
cated as most beneficial, but it was the robot's sociability that they appreciated the most.
"I would regret it if I did not have him anymore. So, in that sense it has a benefit in some
way"--female, 27, living with spouse.
Although sharing experiences of the robot with other people (e.g. discuss with others)
was still a topic of interest during the interviews, the participants explained that they had
talked less about the robot. Being familiarized with the robot resulted in less triggers
from the participants to share their experiences with others. A few participants explained
to me that they would like to have an online community with other Karotz users to share
their experiences with. "I used to do that in the beginning [showing the robot to visitors].
But at a certain time, everyone knew the robot already. So, I stopped doing that"--
female, 22, living in student dorm.
The remaining participants integrated the use of the robot into their everyday lives
(e.g. incorporation). They felt that the robot just belonged in their home as if it would be
incomplete without the robot standing in its place doing what it does. "[The robot]
belongs with us now"--female, 24, living with mature family.
Daily routines of using the robot (e.g. use routine) were created by the remaining
participants. There were standard times at which the participants used the robot, and
most of the time they used the robot for the same purposes. "I used the camera when I am
at work, to look if everything was going okay back home. And the dairy function on
Sunday evening. That were all things on the same moment"--male, 31, living alone.
The participants had the robot fully adapted to their personal needs (e.g. personaliza-
tion). They were done exploring the programs and settings and they had spent quite some
time doing that before they were completely satisfied with how the robot works best for
de Graaf et al. 2597

them. "I constantly searched for better programs ... He is completely adjusted to me.
That is useful"--female, 22, living in student dorm.
For most of the remaining participants, the robot has become something special that
is just there. Most participants even expressed that they still liked to keep the robot and
that they would miss the robot if someone had to take it away from them (e.g. emotional
attachment). Most participants expected that they would miss the robot if I had to take it
away. Some participants compared the robot with having pets. Other participants just felt
that they owned the robot now that is has been in their homes for so long. "You get used
to having it ... It is just like having a pet, when you talk about it like that ... He has
become a part of our family ... I still like him. I would not want to miss him"--female,
24, living with mature family.
Finally, most of the remaining participants came up with ideas to further develop the
usability of the robot (e.g. reinvention). Some participants tried to program their own
application or led others them with that. Other participants just shared their ideas for
further development of the robot with me during the interviews. "I have tried to look up
how you could make an English-speaking robot say stuff in Dutch. I Googled that, but
that is quite difficult to do"--male, 32, living alone.
General discussion
This study provides insights into the long-term acceptance process by presenting a
phased framework for long-term acceptance, validate this framework, and to see whether
and how a longer, uninterrupted period of use of interactive technology in a domestic
environment affects changes in long-term use itself, as well as the user's attitudes and
behaviors associated with the long-term use of interactive technologies. We proposed six
acceptance phases: expectation, encounter, adoption, adaptation, integration, and identi-
fication. Our results demonstrate that most user experiences, which were theoretically
2598 new media & society 20(7)
linked to a certain acceptance phase, correspond to a substantial extent to the theorized
timeline determined for the interviews. Figure 2 shows that user experiences linked to
each acceptance phase was indeed discussed most by the participants in the interviews
scheduled for that particular phase. Therefore, we conclude that our phased framework
for long-term acceptance of interactive technologies holds when applied to people's
experiences anticipating and appropriating the use of an interactive technology in their
own homes.
One deviation from the adopted timeline for our phased framework is observed for the
identification phase. After 6months of the introduction of the robot, the participants still
talked mostly about adapting the robot to their personal needs and trying to incorporate
the use of the robot into their everyday lives. This suggests that the participants had not
yet fully reached the identification phase at that point. Although the user experiences
within the acceptance phases are believed to be fundamental and generalizable to other
interactive technologies for domestic use, this result confirms that the timeline of the
acceptance process might be different for each technology. For example, another study
focusing on user experiences with a smartphone (Karapanos et al., 2009) has partially
described similar user experiences and acceptance phases, but their participants already
reached the end of the novelty effect and sustained use after 4weeks of use. Even though
the novelty effect ended after approximately 2months in our long-term home study, the
establishment of sustained use did not occur at that time for most of the participants.
Thus, the end of the novelty effect and the establishment of habits seem to be two sepa-
rate processes and should be regarded as such. Ronis et al. (1989) have argued that
habitual behavior has been established once it has been performed frequently (i.e. at least
twice a month) and extensively (i.e. at least 10 times). However, research on the estab-
lishment of new behaviors (Lally et al., 2009) indicates that it takes much longer for a
repeated behavior to reach its maximum level of habituation. In their study, which inves-
tigated a wide range of behaviors, people needed approximately 2months (i.e. 66days on
average) to establish a new behavior. However, given that the researchers examined a
wide range of behaviors, there was a marked variation ranging from 18 (drinking a daily
glass of water) to 254 (doing 50 pushups after morning coffee)days before behaviors had
become habits. Because the satisfactory repetition of behavior in the past may result in
habit formation (Ajzen, 2002; Ronis et al., 1989; Triandis, 1979; Verplanken et al., 1997),
the duration of each acceptance phase may depend on the type of technology and is most
likely related to the frequency and intensity of technology use. Therefore, caution is
necessary when linking the acceptance phases to fixed time frames.
Some additional remarks on a few user experiences that deviated from the theorized
timeline are necessary. First, instead of mainly discussing the robot with others in the
expectation phase, the participants mostly discussed the robot with others around 2weeks
after the introduction, which we theoretically framed as part of the adoption phase.
Indeed, innovative technologies are seldom solely adopted for their practical functions
(Rogers, 2003). We observed in the expectation phase that participants were forming
attitudes about the compatibility and relative advantage of the robot in terms of their own
way or patterns of living. When people adopt technologies mainly because of the per-
ceived social awards, lifestyle becomes a key factor of adoption (Li, 2015). It may thus
be that, around the adoption decision, the participants had an increased motivation to talk
de Graaf et al. 2599
about the robot with other people, which has--in addition to its practical functions--also
an interactive component.
Second, the participants continued to seek information about the robot until 2weeks
after the introduction, which suggests that people seek information beyond the expecta-
tion phase. Although the exact decision moment of whether one decides to use a technol-
ogy or not is often referred to as adoption, the decision itself is a process as well. Once,
and in many ways not possible until, a person has adopted a technology, often people do
(and must) seek more information. Thus, adoption doesn't mean complete saturation of
knowledge and use of the technology. Together, the user experiences of "discuss with
others" and "information seeking" could be regarded as instruments to make sense of the
robot or a way to reduce uncertainty. This not only demonstrates an activity related to
Silverstone and Haddon's (1996) conversion, but it also goes beyond it in that it implies
a mental construction of the used technology (Ling et al., 1999). The participants reported
on their trialability and complexity aspects of the robot in the encounter phase, in that
they were experimenting with the robot and sometimes experience its use as difficult.
Because the robot was a rather complex piece of technology, the participants may have
used the additionally sought information and discussion of their experiences with others
as a venue for improving their understanding of the robot.
Third, even after 2months of use, the participants still talked a lot about appropriating
the technology to their own needs, which in our theoretical framework should have been
finalized around 2months of use where the integration phase begins. As stated above, we
believe that these "delayed" shifts from one phase to the other could be linked to the
specific technology that is under study.
Finally, the user experience of "recognize benefits" was part of all the interviews but
was of especial interest to the participants at the day of the introduction to the robot dur-
ing the encounter phase. Moreover, this topic reoccurred during the interviews after
6months of use during the identification phase as theorized. The rise of this user experi-
ence in both phases is not surprising because these are the moments linked to initial
adoption and continued use (Davis et al., 1992; Rogers, 2003). Utility is a prerequisite
for adopting an interactive robot at this stage of the diffusion in our society (De Graaf
et al., 2016), even though interactive technologies offer sociability purposes in addition
to their utilitarian advantages.
These deviations from our adopted timeline associated with the sequence of accept-
ance phases call for further explorations of long-term use of interactive technologies. To
further establish our proposed phased framework of long-term acceptance, future
research should investigate user experiences with all kinds of interactive technologies.
These studies should further explore whether similar acceptance phases and user experi-
ences are observed including their associated timelines.
Limitations
Although our exploratory study has observed interesting trends for the process of long-
term acceptance of interactive technologies in domestic environments, some potential
limitations should be addressed. First, the interaction capabilities of the Karotz robot used
in our study were somewhat limited. The choice of this robot is a consequence of the goal
2600 new media & society 20(7)
of our study to investigate long-term social robot acceptance in multiple households
(n=70). We had to depend on commercially available robots because research robots are
still not robust enough for extended deployment outside the lab without supervision of an
expert. The limited capacities of commercially available robots might cause a gap between
initial expectations and actual experiences after initial interactions (Lohse, 2011). The
expectation gap encountered by our participants resulted in dropout before the end of the
study. Robots could be labeled as a "disruptive technology" since they are more than just
updated replacements of existing technologies (Ezer et al., 2009), and people are not eas-
ily prompted to embrace disruptive technologies (Dewar and Dutton, 1986; Green et al.,
1995). Although robot technology is rapidly enhancing, the added value of most robot
systems is still inferior compared to other domestic devices already present in the home.
Based on people's motivations to reject or discontinue the use of the robot, De Graaf et al.
(2017) conclude that the challenge for robot designers is to create robots that are enjoya-
ble and easy to use or (socially) predictable to capture users in the short term and function-
ally relevant and possess enhanced social behaviors to keep those users in the longer term.
Therefore, replication of our study with other types of interactive technologies and more
sophisticated robots is necessary to ascertain whether comparable results occur on the
acceptance of these systems. Second, although the participants in our study consisted of a
well-selected group, some remarks about this group of participants and its relationship to
the reported findings must be made.All participants voluntarily joined the study and could
use the robot for free. This means that the risk and cost factors in the acceptance process
were much lower for our participants, and therefore, the motivations of the users in our
study will be somewhat different from the motivations and user experiences of "real"
future users who will buy and employ social robots. Therefore, further research is neces-
sary to investigate these user experiences when the technology of social robotics matures
and the diffusion of social robots within society increases.
Conclusion
The research presented in this article has provided an initial validation of our phased
framework for long-term acceptance of interactive technologies and show that acceptance
phases are linked to certain user experiences which evolve over time when people gain
experience with the technology. We have analytically mapped the full process of user
acceptance of interactive technology in the home, which includes six phases from antici-
pating the use to beyond patterns of sustained used. All six acceptance phases are regu-
larly observed when users go through the entire process. However, in other occasions,
users may experience overlap between phases or phases are iterated in a feedback. It
might even be that people dropout the sequence all together when they decide to reject the
technology or discontinue its use (De Graaf et al., 2017). The presented research has made
the full acceptance process observable by identifying the user experiences linked to each
acceptance phase. Since our phased framework of long-term acceptance is based on two
prominent theories in the information systems and technology adoption literature, namely,
the domestication theory (Silverstone and Haddon, 1996) and diffusion of innovations
theory (Rogers, 2003), complemented by the results of studies involving robots and other
types of interactive technologies, we believe that our framework could be applied to a
de Graaf et al. 2601
broad range of interactive technologies. Involving end users in the early stages of devel-
opment helps researchers understand the cultural and social contexts of acceptance and
enables developers to apply this gained knowledge into their designs, a paradigm that has
been recognized that users shape technology (Lie and Sørenson, 1996; Silverstone and
Hirsch, 1992). Discovering people's perceptions, expectations, and impressions of inter-
active technologies in their private domestic environments over a longer period is vital for
informing the design and acceptance of these technologies. Further research that investi-
gates the long-term acceptance of interactive technology in domestic environments is
necessary for a successful diffusion of these types of technology within society.
