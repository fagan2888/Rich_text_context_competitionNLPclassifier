Objective: To determine the prevalence, risk factors,
and risk behaviors associated with depressive symp-
toms in a nationally representative, cross-sectional sample
of young adolescents.
Design: A school-based survey collected through self-
administered questionnaires in grades 6, 8, and 10 in 1996.
Setting: Schools in the United States.
Participants: 9863 students in grades 6, 8, and 10 (av-
erage ages, 11, 13, and 15).
Main Outcome Measures: Depressive symptoms, sub-
stance use, somatic symptoms, scholastic behaviors, and
involvement in bullying.
Results: Eighteen percent of youths reported symptoms
of depression. A higher proportion of females (25%) re-
ported depressive symptoms than males (10%). Preva-
lence of depressive symptoms increased by age for both
males and females. Among American Indian youths, 29%
reported depressive symptoms, as compared with 22% of
Hispanic, 18% of white, 17% of Asian American, and 15%
of African American youths. Youths who were frequently
involved in bullying, either as perpetrators or as victims,
were more than twice as likely to report depressive symp-
toms than those who were not involved in bullying. A sig-
nificantly higher percentage of youths who reported us-
ing substances reported depressive symptoms as compared
with other youths. Similarly, youths who reported expe-
riencingsomaticsymptomsalsoreportedsignificantlyhigher
proportions of depressive symptoms than other youths.
Conclusions: Depression is a substantial and largely un-
recognized problem among young adolescents that war-
rants an increased need and opportunity for identifica-
tion and intervention at the middle school level.
Understanding differences in prevalence between males
and females and among racial/ethnic groups may be im-
portant to the recognition and treatment of depression
among youths.

MAJOR DEPRESSIVE DISOR-
der (MDD) accounts
for greater mortality,
morbidity, and finan-
cial costs than any
other psychiatric disorder.1 A standard-
ized scale assessing the extent of disability
caused by all major medical disorders, in-
cluding stroke and heart disease, ranked
MDD fourth overall in terms of world-
wide disability impact.1 Because depres-
sion is highly responsive to treatment, it is
unnecessarily exacerbated by the low rates
of recognition and diagnosis.2
As underrecognized and under-
treated as depression is among adults, it is
even more so among children and adoles-
cents. Studies have estimated that depres-
sion affects up to 8.3% of older adoles-
cents in the United States.3 Depressive
symptoms among youths are often attrib-
uted to the normal stress of adolescence;
misdiagnosed as primarily conduct, atten-
tional,orsubstanceabusedisorders;orseen
as a stage the youths are going through.
Overlooking MDD among youths can have
tragic consequences. Depression is associ-
ated with an increased risk of suicide,3 and
teen suicide rates have nearly tripled in the
last 50 years.4 Those who experience de-
pression at an early age often struggle with
depression throughout their lives,5 and in
many cases, early onset of depression pre-
dicts more severe depression during adult-
hood.6 Even subclinical depression dur-
ing adolescence increases the risk of MDD
as an adult 2- to 3-fold.7
Studies of high school students5,8,9
have shown that, similar to depression
among adults, the incidence of depres-
sion among adolescents is greater for fe-
males than males. These sex differences
have been reported to emerge between the
ages of 13 and 15 years, and prior to this

age, rates of depression appear to be similar for young
boys and girls.10-13
Depression is associated with poor health behav-
iors and social challenges. In addition to an increased risk
of suicide, youths who are depressed are at a higher risk
for mental disorders such as anxiety, conduct disorders,
and substance abuse. They are also more likely than other
youths to engage in unsafe sexual practices and other risk
behaviors.6,8,14-16 Further, youths who are depressed tend
to experience difficulty relating to peers and are more
likely than others to be involved in physical fights with
peers.8,14,15 The difficulties they face in their peer rela-
tionships and their tendency toward violent behavior are
not well understood; however, there is some overlap be-
tween the issues faced by youths who are depressed and
those faced by youths involved in aggressive behaviors
such as bullying.
Bullying has recently been recognized as a com-
mon behavior among young adolescents.16 Like youths
who are depressed, those adolescents who are involved
in bullying, both as victims and as perpetrators, experi-
ence poor psychosocial and emotional adjustment, dif-
ficulty making friends, and increased loneliness.16 Given
the high prevalence of bullying behaviors and the risks
that both the victims and the perpetrators of bullying en-
counter, the relationship between bullying and depres-
sion merits examination.
Recognizing depression as early as possible could
be a critical step to reducing the prevalence of depres-
sion among older individuals, managing depression more
effectively, and preventing negative outcomes. A num-
ber of important issues need further investigation to aid
early diagnosis. Because most studies on adolescent de-
pression have focused on high school students, the preva-
lence of depressive symptoms in younger adolescents (ie,
middle school children) is not well established. Few stud-
ies have included middle school youths, and each has had
methodological limitations, ranging from small sample
size and the inability to study certain ethnic groups to
varied indicators of depression.17-19 Thus, to recognize de-
pression among youths as early as possible, further re-
search is needed.
In the present study, we use data from a school-
based national survey to explore the prevalence of de-
pressive symptoms in young adolescents. We sought to
answer the following questions1: What is the prevalence
of depressive symptoms in US youths aged 11 to 15 years?2
And to what extent are substance use, involvement in bul-
lying, and somatic symptoms associated with depres-
sive symptoms in this age range?
METHODS
The Health Behavior in School Children Study is a multina-
tional, cross-sectional, school-based survey of adolescents in
grades 6, 8, and 10; the survey was first conducted in 1983-
1984, and since 1985-1986 it has been performed every 4 years
in collaboration with the World Health Organization Regional
Office for Europe (Copenhagen, Denmark). Data are collected
through a cluster sample design in which schools and class-
rooms are selected so that nationally representative samples are
obtained. The anonymous survey includes questions on fam-
ily structure, diet, exercise, self-image, injuries, safety behav-
iors, academic performance and pressures, attitudes about
school, fighting and bullying, and substance use.
In 1996, the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration (Rockville, Md) and the National Institute of
Child Health and Human Development (Rockville) supported
a survey, conducted by Macro International Inc (Calverton, Md),
of young adolescents that was based on the Health Behavior in
School Children Study. Compared with previous and subse-
quent Health Behavior in School Children surveys, the 1996
US survey included more detailed information than the inter-
national quadrennial surveys about mental health and behav-
ior, including depressive symptoms and risk behaviors. Thus,
data from this survey are used to report and characterize de-
pressive symptoms among US youths. Parents/guardians of stu-
dents were sent a letter describing the survey and were given
the opportunity to decline their child's participation. Eighty-
seven percent of the students responded. The survey was con-
ducted with the approval and oversight of the institutional re-
view boards of the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services
Administration and Macro International Inc.
This study applied a 3-stage cluster design in which the
school district was the primary sampling unit or first stage, the
school was the second stage, and the classroom was the third
stage. The universe for the study consisted of public and pri-
vate schools in the 50 states and the District of Columbia. Data
were collected from 9963 students at 358 schools through a
self-administered questionnaire containing 114 questions. Ex-
cluded from the study sample were students with substantial
missing data (n=25), multiple responses on or missing grade
information (n=65), and multiple responses on or missing sex
information (n=10). The final analytic sample consisted of 9863
students in grades 6, 8, and 10, representing a total of 11184117
US students. African American, Hispanic, and Asian Ameri-
can youths were oversampled to provide national estimates for
underrepresented racial and ethnic groups.
The weighted sample of 9863 students was split almost
equally between males (47.8%) and females (52.2%) and among
students in grades 6 (32.1%), 8 (33.7%), and 10 (34.2%). The
majority of students were classified as non-Hispanic white youths
(48%), followed by those classified as Hispanic (28.2%), non-
Hispanic African American (13.6%), non-Hispanic Asian Ameri-
can (8.7%), and non-Hispanic American Indian/Pacific Islander
(1.5%).
VARIABLES
The questionnaire included items on health-related behaviors
in the context of students' families, schools, and peers. The fol-
lowing variables were examined in the present study.
Depressive Symptoms
The questionnaire included 2 items on depression. The first item
asked students to indicate if they ever felt sad, blue, down, or
depressed almost every day for 2 or more consecutive weeks
during the past 12 months. The second item asked students to
respond yes or no to 10 statements describing what they might
have experienced when they were feeling depressed during the
past 12 months. These statements were taken from the Diag-
nostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Revised Third
Edition (DSM-III-R) criteria for depression.20 Using these cri-
teria, we created a dichotomous indicator of depressive symp-
toms. According to the DSM-III-R, an individual is depressed
if at least 5 of 9 criteria are met (ie, present during the past 2
weeks). Two of the 9 criteria were excluded from this ques-
tionnaire (psychomotor agitation or retardation and fatigue or
loss of energy almost every day) because the authors of the ques-
tionnaire believed that these criteria would be difficult to ac-

curately assess without a clinical examination. The remaining
7 criteria were translated into the 10 response items (Figure).
Bullying
Students were asked to report the number of times per week
that they had been bullied or had bullied others at school dur-
ing the past 12 months.
Risk Behaviors
With regard to substance use, students were asked if they ever
smoked tobacco, drank alcohol, or took other drugs (such as
marijuana, cocaine, inhalants, and hallucinogens). If they an-
swered yes to the questions on alcohol and smoking, they were
asked to indicate how often they used these substances in the
past month.
With regard to somatic symptoms, students were pro-
vided with a list of physical ailments (eg, headache, stomach-
ache, and backache) and asked to indicate whether or not they
experienced each ailment once a week.
STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
For purposes of analysis, 2 sets of depression response items
were collapsed: the 2 dealing with lack of sleep and excess sleep
(sleep disturbance) and the 2 dealing with weight loss and weight
gain (weight disturbance). Individuals were classified as re-
porting depressive symptoms if at least 5 of the 8 statements
in the Figure were true. After depressive symptom status was
determined, we calculated the prevalence of depressive symp-
toms for all grade, sex, and racial/ethnic subgroups. Next, we
calculated the prevalence of depressive symptoms according
to the status of bullying behaviors. Finally, we calculated the
prevalence of depressive symptoms for substance abuse and so-
matic symptoms and compared these by status of substance
abuse and somatic symptoms. We stratified all analyses by sex.
We calculated 95% confidence intervals for the estimated preva-
lence ratio to compare prevalence of depressive symptoms across
bullying behaviors, substance use, and somatic ailments.
All analyses were conducted using SAS software (version
8.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC). Analyses are weighted by the prob-
ability of the selection to produce national estimates. SUDAAN
(Research Triangle Institute, Research Triangle Park, NC) was
used for variance estimates to account for sample design.
RESULTS
About 1 in 6 US youths reported depressive symptoms
(Table 1). Prevalence of depressive symptoms was higher
among females than males; however, prevalence in both
sexes increased with grade level. For boys, prevalence al-
most doubled between 6th and 10th grades. For girls,
prevalence nearly tripled between 6th and 10th grades
(Table 1). Prevalence of depressive symptoms varied by
racial/ethnic group, and prevalence among females in all
racial/ethnic groups was consistently higher than among
males. Among males and females, those classified as
American Indian/Alaskan Native and Hispanic had the
highest prevalence of depressive symptoms, followed by
those classified as white. Those classified as African Ameri-
can had the lowest prevalence, followed by Asian Ameri-
can youths (Table 1).
With regard to bullying and depression, the pro-
portion of youths reporting depressive symptoms in-
creased with increased involvement in bullying, both as
the bullies and as the victims (Table 2). This was true
for males and females. Thirty-seven percent of females
who were bullied more than twice in the preceding year
reported depressive symptoms, compared with nearly 18%
of similar males. Nearly 46% of females involved in bul-
lying others more than twice in the preceding year re-
ported depressive symptoms, compared with 15% of simi-
lar males (Table 2).
Females and males who reported using substances
had significantly higher proportions of depressive symp-
toms than those who did not report using substances
(Table 3). This pattern was true for all measured sub-
stances. Prevalence of depressive symptoms was much
higher among female substance users than male sub-
stance users. With regard to somatic symptoms, females
and males who reported having somatic symptoms 1 or
more times a week had a significantly greater preva-
lence of depressive symptoms than those who did not re-
port having these symptoms as often (Table 4).
COMMENT
This study indicates that the prevalence of depression
among young adolescents, particularly female adoles-
cents, may be higher than previous estimates. Although
previous research has shown a high rate of depression
among adolescents, most studies have been conducted
on older adolescents, particularly high school and col-
lege students. We found that the prevalence of depres-
sive symptoms among females in this age range was ap-
proximately double that among males. Previous research
on sex differences and depression has also shown that
depression is more prevalent among females than males;
however, this study suggests that sex differences among
adolescents who are depressed may emerge earlier than
previous research has suggested.
As expected, the prevalence of depressive symp-
toms among adolescents increased with age. The in-
crease was far more severe for females than males, as was
evidenced by the doubled prevalence from sixth to eighth
grade. The increase among males, though less striking,
was also notable, indicating a rapid emergence of de-
pressive symptoms among youths in middle school.
Although Native American, Hispanic, and white stu-
dents, especially girls, reported more depressive symp-
toms as compared with Asian American and African
American students, findings from previous studies on de-

pression and ethnicity have not been as clear. Some stud-
ies have shown minimal differences among ethnic groups
with regard to depression,21 whereas other studies have
found depression to be more prevalent among African
American adolescents than other adolescents,8 and still
others have found it to be less prevalent among African
American youths.22 Data on depression among Hispanic
youths have been mixed,23,24 and previous research on
Asian American adolescents has shown that Asian Ameri-
can adolescents are at a high risk for depression.25

Given the variability in results, these questions warrant
further research.
The association between bullying and depression is
notable. Although the prevalence of involvement in bul-
lying both as victims and as perpetrators was high, those
who reported being involved more frequently had higher
proportions of depression. Regarding those youths who
are bullied, one might expect that an individual who is
bullied frequently could develop feelings of social isola-
tion, leading to depression. Further, those youths who
are depressed might lack social skills, making them an
easy target for bullying. The association between bullies
and depression is less obvious. Previous research has
found that those who bullied do not appear to be so-
cially isolated,16 nor do they appear to suffer from psy-
chosomatic or depressive symptoms26; however, an-
other study reported that those who bully are at an
increased risk for depression and suicide.27 One pos-
sible explanation as to why those who bully may be at
an increased risk for depression and suicide is that they
may have had more exposure to familial violence or abuse.
Clearly, this topic requires further investigation.
The association between risk behaviors and depres-
sive symptoms in this study are consistent with previ-
ous research on older adolescents. Youths who reported
using substances were more likely to report depressive
symptoms than other youths, suggesting that those who
use substances might be self-medicating, even at this
young age. We should also consider the possibility that
substance use may actually precede the onset of depres-
sive symptoms, as suggested by previous research.28 Fur-
thermore, youths who reported suffering from frequent
somatic symptoms were more likely to report depres-
sive symptoms than other youths. Previous research has
found that girls are more likely than boys to admit to in-
ternalizing symptoms such as depression and anxiety.
In contrast, boys have a greater tendency to externalize
symptoms through "acting out."29 Thus, the higher pro-
portion of females reporting somatic symptoms is not
surprising.
Several strengths of this study should be noted. First,
the large sample size of this study places it among the
largest nationally representative studies on youths and
depression. Also, the sampling strategy was designed so
that reliable estimates could be made for ethnic minori-
ties, including African American, Asian American, and
Hispanic individuals. Unlike several past studies, depres-
sion was assessed using criteria outlined by the Ameri-
can Psychological Association. Although the data were
collected in 1996, we do not believe that the age of the
data has a bearing on the interpretation of the results.
The criteria used to diagnose depression have not changed
in recent years. We do not suspect that any secular trends
would have affected the rates of reporting depressive
symptoms during the past 8 years; however, even if the
prevalence of depressive symptoms has changed, the re-
lationship between depression and associated risk fac-
tors is unlikely to have been affected.
Readers should note, however, that a DSM-III-R di-
agnosis of MDD includes the stipulation that the de-
pressed mood was present "most of the day, nearly ev-
ery day" during a 2-week period and that the depression
caused significant distress or impairment in daily func-
tioning. Additionally, the DSM-III-R was designed to as-
sess depression among adults. Although the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders has under-
gone rigorous psychometric testing, this particular ques-
tionnaire did not undergo such testing. Because of these
factors, combined with the fact that the present study did
not include a clinical examination of each respondent,
readers should note that the results of this study reflect
the prevalence of depressive symptoms, not clinical de-
pression. Given the self-report method of data collec-
tion and the fact that only 7 of 9 depression criteria were
included in the survey, it is possible that the data pre-
sented in this study actually underreport the prevalence
of depressive symptoms.
Results from this study suggest that depression is a
substantial problem facing young adolescents. The study
highlights the need for more intervention at the middle

school level. Because depressive symptoms are likely to
coexist with other adolescent problem behaviors, such
as bullying and substance use, young adolescents who
are involved in such behaviors might be depressed as well.
Youths who suffer from frequent somatic symptoms (eg,
frequent absenteeism and/or complaints of headaches and
other physical symptoms) are more likely to be de-
pressed. Practitioners who work with youths who have
such symptoms/behaviors should consider screening them
for depression; successful treatment of depression could
lead to many other positive health and behavioral out-
comes for these youths. Increased awareness of depres-
sion among this age group is the first step toward imple-
menting effective intervention.

What This Study Adds
Major depressive disorder accounts for greater mortal-
ity, morbidity, and financial costs than any other psy-
chiatric disorder. In the United States, studies estimate
the prevalence of depression among older adolescents
to be as high as 8.3%. Much less is known about preva-
lence of and risk factors for depression among young ado-
lescents. Results of this study show that nearly 20% of
young adolescents in the United States report symp-
toms consistent with depression. Furthermore, youths
involved in behaviors such as bullying and substance use
and youths who report frequent somatic complaints have
higher rates of depressive symptoms than other youths.
Results of this study suggest that depression mani-
fests itself in many ways that might not appear obvious
in young adolescents. Thus, practitioners who work with
youths who have such symptoms/behaviors should con-
sider screening for depression. Depression is a substan-
tial and largely unrecognized problem facing young ado-
lescents, and more intervention is needed at the middle
school level.
