Objectives. This study explored whether improvements in cognitive functioning occurred during the 1990s among
older Americans and investigated several possible explanations for such changes.
Methods. Using the 1993 Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old study (N  7,443) and 1998 Health and Re-
tirement Survey (N  7,624), this study examined aggregate changes in the proportion of the noninstitutionalized popu-
lation aged 70 and older with severe cognitive impairment. Impairment was measured for self-respondents using a
modified version of the Telephone Interview Cognitive Screen; for proxy respondents, ratings of memory and judgment
were used. Logistic regression was used to investigate potential explanations for aggregate changes.
Results. The percentage of older Americans with severe cognitive impairment declined from 6.1% in 1993 to 3.6%
in 1998 (p  .001). The decline was statistically significant among self-respondents but not among those with proxy in-
terviews. Improvements between 1993 and 1998 were not explained by shifts in demographic and socioeconomic fac-
tors or by changes in the prevalence of stroke, vision, or hearing impairments.
Discussion. As a group, older persons, especially those well into their 80s, appear to have better cognitive function-
ing today than they did in the early 1990s.
LTHOUGH results are not completely uniform, and
there is no assurance that the trend will continue, there
is a growing consensus that during the 1980s and early
1990s physical functioning among older Americans im-
proved (Crimmins, Saito, & Reynolds, 1997; Freedman &
Martin, 1998, 2000; Manton, Corder, & Stallard, 1993, 1997;
Waidmann & Liu, 2000). Thus far studies have focused on a
spectrum of physical outcomes, including functional limita-
tions, activities of daily living (ADLs), and instrumental ac-
tivities of daily living (IADLs).
Comparisons within and across studies suggest that im-
provements in IADLs may have been larger than those for
ADLs (Crimmins et al., 1997; Freedman & Soldo, 1994;
Manton et al., 1997; Waidmann & Liu, 2000). Others have
noted that IADLs, such as managing money, taking medica-
tions, and using the telephone, have a particularly strong
relationship with cognition (Barberger-Gateau et al., 1992;
Fitzgerald, Smith, Martin, Freedman, & Wolinsky, 1993;
Kasper, 1990), suggesting that cognitive functioning may
also have improved among older Americans in recent de-
cades. Consistent with this hypothesis is the work by Man-
ton, Stallard, and Corder (1995, 1998), which showed de-
clines in the prevalence of dementia and in the debilitating
effects of this condition among older Americans between
1982 and 1989.
A handful of studies in the cognitive psychology litera-
ture have shown improvements over historic time in a vari-
ety of intelligence measures (Salthouse, 1991). Flynn (1987),
for example, documented massive IQ gains for adults in 14
industrialized nations. Such studies have often focused on
select samples (e.g., soldiers, school-aged children, young
adults) that exclude older adults. A notable exception is
Schaie (1983), who found improvements among adults aged
25 to 67 from 1959 to 1991 on several cognitive dimensions
in a longitudinal study of enrollees in a health maintenance
organization in Seattle. In his age-specific presentation of
Schaie's results, Salthouse (1991) showed large improve-
ments for 67-year-olds in two of five primary mental abili-
ties, verbal and reasoning skills, over this 32-year period.
Primarily because of data limitations, to date no study has
attempted to analyze national trends in cognitive function-
ing among older Americans. Such trends are of interest for
several reasons. First, because cognitive deficits have a
strong relationship with physical disability (Carlson et al.,
1999; Kasper, 1990; Leveille et al., 1998), an investigation
of cognitive trends may provide important insights into the
existing literature on national disability trends. Second, se-
vere cognitive impairment has been linked to differential
patterns of medical and long-term care service use, with
older impaired persons delaying care and substituting more
expensive hospital care for physician visits (Binder & Rob-
ins, 1990; Kasper, 1995; Larson, Kukull, & Katzman, 1992);
receiving more home health visits with, on average, longer
hours per visit (Coughlin & Liu, 1989; Kasper, 1995); hav-
ing greater numbers of long-term caregivers (Kasper, 1990);
and entering nursing homes at higher rates (Coughlin & Liu,
1989). Thus, an investigation of recent shifts in cognitive
functioning can provide important insights for predicting
the future demand for medical and long-term care and costs
associated with such care. Third, those with severe cogni-
tive impairment living in the community are some of the
most vulnerable members of society, at high risk for eco-
A
CHANGES IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT S101
nomic exploitation as well as physical neglect (Larson et al.,
1992), so tracking the size of this group and changes in who
may be at risk for such abuses is of value in and of itself.
Our purpose in this study was to investigate national-
level changes in the prevalence of severe cognitive impair-
ment among older Americans. Drawing upon the first wave
of the Asset and Health Dynamics of the Oldest Old study
(AHEAD93) and the fourth wave of the Health and Retire-
ment Survey (HRS98), we examined aggregate changes
between 1993 and 1998 in the percentage of the noninstitu-
tionalized population aged 70 and older with severe cognitive
impairment. We also explored whether such aggregate
changes can be attributed to recent shifts in the demo-
graphic and socioeconomic composition of the older popu-
lation and to changes in selected health-related factors.
Defining and Measuring Cognitive Impairment
Cognitive impairment has been described as "a dimin-
ished capacity to know the world" (Folstein, Anthony,
Parhad, Duffy, & Gruenberg, 1985, p. 228). Studies of cog-
nitive functioning across the life span often invoke a two-
process categorization, contrasting fluid-like cognitive me-
chanics (e.g., processing speed, reasoning, memory) with
crystallized pragmatics (e.g., knowledge, fluency; Baltes,
1993). Such distinctions are often blurred in the practice of
measuring cognition, because many cognitive tasks employ
both sets of skills (Baltes & Baltes, 1990). Recalling vocab-
ulary, for example, requires pragmatic knowledge of a word
as well as mechanical retrieval from memory.
An alternative way of conceptualizing cognitive impair-
ment is found in the discussion of dementia in the most re-
cent Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders
(DSM-IV; American Psychiatric Association, 1994). Al-
though sometimes used interchangeably in the social-geron-
tological literature, cognitive impairment and dementia are
not synonymous. Cognitive impairment is most often a
manifestation of dementia or delirium, although a substan-
tial proportion of cases with severe cognitive impairment do
not present with a mental disorder (Folstein et al., 1985). In
contrast, dementia refers to a class of diagnoses based on
clinical criteria including, but not limited to, cognitive dete-
rioration.
Irrespective of these distinctions, deterioration of cogni-
tive functioning, particularly of memory systems, is a hallmark
of dementia and is therefore given considerable attention in
the DSM-IV. The manual distinguishes five dimensions of
cognitive impairment: memory impairment (both short and
long term), aphasia (deterioration of language function),
apraxia (impaired ability to execute motor activities), agno-
sia (inability to recognize objects), and disturbances in ex-
ecutive functioning (inability to think abstractly and process
information). Poor spatial orientation and poor judgment are
also identified as commonly accompanying declines in these
areas because of dementia.
Researchers have developed numerous scales to capture
these aspects of cognitive impairment in clinical settings
(for a review, see Teresi & Evans, 1996). Perhaps the most
widely used of these is Folstein's (Folstein, Folstein, &
McHugh, 1975) Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE),
which taps each of the five dimensions of cognitive func-
tioning in the DSM-IV and spatial orientation. Generally
such measures, and the MMSE in particular, are more valid
and reliable in identifying the severely cognitively im-
paired; others have reported considerable measurement er-
ror when such measures are used to identify the moderately
impaired population (Henderson, 1992; Kasper, 1990). Esti-
mates of severe cognitive impairment based on such scales
among the older community-dwelling population have con-
sistently ranged from 5% to 7% (Kasper, 1990).
Although many of these instruments require face-to-face
contact with the patient, researchers have developed several
instruments with the express purpose of screening for cog-
nitive impairment on the telephone. The Telephone Inter-
view Cognitive Screen (TICS), for example, which is based
on Folstein's MMSE, measures short- and long-term mem-
ory, aphasia, apraxia, and disturbances in executive func-
tioning, with the scale heavily weighted toward memory im-
pairment. The original TICS consisted of 11 items with a
maximum score of 41 (Brandt, Spencer, & Folstein, 1988).
The scale has high reliability and excellent predictive valid-
ity in terms of identifying persons with clinically diagnosed
dementia (Brandt et al., 1988). Most often a cutoff of 30 or
less is used as an indicator of cognitive impairment. The in-
strument has been modified and adapted in several popula-
tion-based surveys, including the AHEAD93 and the
HRS98; their version (described in the Methods section)
emphasizes memory impairment and disturbance in execu-
tive function.
To avoid omitting some of the most cognitively impaired,
community-based studies of cognitive functioning often al-
low informants (or proxies, in survey terminology) to report
about the cognitive functioning of sampled persons (Herzog &
Rodgers, 1999; Kasper, 1990). Researchers have developed
a separate set of indicators to elicit the cognitive status of
older individuals from such informants. Jorm (Jorm, 1994,
1996; Jorm & Jacomb, 1989), for example, developed an in-
formant-based scale for measuring cognitive decline in el-
derly persons, which measures changes in short- and long-
term memory, aphasia, apraxia, agnosia, deterioration in
executive functioning, and judgment. The scale correlates
well with the MMSE in identifying the severely impaired
population (Jorm, Scott, Cullen, & MacKinnon, 1991).
Other studies, including the AHEAD93 and HRS98, have
developed questions asking proxies to rate the cognitive
performance (e.g., memory, judgment) of another person.
These types of brief, informant-based measures have good
predictive validity of clinical diagnoses of dementia and the
MMSE (Jorm, 1996).
Influences on Cognitive Functioning
Demographic and socioeconomic factors.--Age is the
factor most commonly associated with a decline in cogni-
tive functioning, although there is considerable variation in
the ageÂ­cognition relation depending on the aspect of cog-
nition being considered (Salthouse, 1991) and whether the
analysis is of cross-sectional levels or longitudinal change
(Hultsch, Hertzog, Small, McDonald, & Dixon, 1992). Stud-
ies showing that age effects are shared across a wide range
of cognitive domains have been interpreted as evidence of
S102 FREEDMAN ET AL.
broad age-related changes at the neurophysiological level
(Salthouse, 1998; Salthouse & Czaja, 2000). Others (e.g.,
Starr, Deary, Inch, Cross, & MacLennan, 1997) have argued
that much of decline in old age actually reflects the associa-
tion of age and disease.
Low educational attainment is another factor frequently
associated with cognitive decline or poor performance on
cognitive tests in old age, although the basis for the relation-
ship is not clear (Salthouse, 1991; Stern & Carstensen, 2000).
It could be that formal education results in cognitive prac-
tice that may affect later ability. Other elements of early and
midlife experience, such as childhood socioeconomic status
(which might influence opportunities beyond education),
education of parents (which might reflect genetic endow-
ment or childrearing practices), and adult occupation (which
might reflect continued cognitive practice as well as envi-
ronmental factors) may be related to both education and late-
life cognitive functioning. However, it could be that these
socioeconomic factors may simply serve as proxy measures
of early health experiences and care. Moreover, in the case
of educational attainment, the causation could run in the op-
posite direction, with early cognitive deficits relating to less
schooling, which is then associated with poorer cognition
later in life (Gurland et al., 1997).
Another relationship frequently noted in the literature on
cognition is with race and ethnicity. In the United States,
older Blacks and Hispanics typically do worse on cognitive
tests than do non-Hispanic Whites (Albert et al., 1995; Her-
zog & Wallace, 1997; Whitfield et al., 2000). A number of
hypotheses have been put forth to explain such cultural dif-
ferences (Stern & Carstensen, 2000). The association may
reflect, for example, socioeconomic differences and differ-
ential susceptibility to diseases that affect cognitive func-
tioning. In younger populations, the power of stereotypes has
been shown to influence test scores (Steele, 1997; Steele &
Aronson, 1995), and this influence may operate in older
populations as well. It may be that older persons' perfor-
mance is also influenced by cultural differences in attitudes
toward aging and in culturally related differences in neuro-
biological processes developed early in life (Park, Nisbett, &
Hedden, 1999). There is also evidence that racial and ethnic
differences may be explained in part by bias in screening
measures (Mulgrew et al., 1999; Teresi et al., 1995).
Sex differences in cognitive functioning in old age have
also been identified, but the differential varies by aspect of
cognition (Hultsch et al., 1992). Little attention has been de-
voted to differentials by marital status, although it might be
hypothesized that the social interaction associated with mar-
riage might be beneficial to cognitive functioning (Dixon &
Gould, 1998).
Health factors.--Self-rated health and specific diseases
have been associated with cognitive functioning, although
even more than in the case of demographic and socioeco-
nomic factors, it may be difficult to sort out causality. For
example, depression is frequently associated with cognitive
impairment, but as Parmelee, Kleban, Lawton, and Katz
(1991) have found, part of the link may be due to depression
resulting from distress about cognitive decline. However,
there are specific diseases such as stroke that have a clear
physiological link to functioning. It is also plausible that ab-
normal glucose levels associated with diabetes might affect
function, in particular memory (Kumari, Brunner, & Fuhrer,
2000), but population studies provide only mixed evidence
depending in part on the aspect of functioning (Strachan,
Deary, Ewing, & Frier, 1997), and it could be that some of
the association is due to other diabetes-related disorders.
Evidence regarding the association of hypertension, cardio-
vascular disease, or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease
and cognitive performance is also mixed (Zelinski, Crim-
mins, Reynolds, & Seeman, 1998). Treatments, especially
medications, for these and other diseases and conditions
may also affect cognitive function (Luisi, Owens, & Hume,
1999).
Finally, cognitive functioning among older people has been
shown to be highly correlated with sensory functioning, par-
ticularly vision and hearing (Baltes & Lindenberger, 1997;
Lindenberger & Baltes, 1994; Salthouse, Hancock, Meinz, &
Hanbrick, 1996; Stein & Bienenfield, 1992). Once again,
causality is not clear. It could be that cognitive decline af-
fects sensory performance or that sensory impairment af-
fects cognitive function, or at least performance, on tests.
Alternatively, sensory and cognitive functions may be simi-
larly affected by some unmeasured factors, or they may be
part of a common neurobiological system (Baltes & Linden-
berger, 1997; Salthouse et al., 1996).
Testing factors.--Two other factors that may influence
performance on cognitive functioning tests in population-
based longitudinal surveys are mode of interview--in per-
son or by telephone--and number of times the respondent
has been tested before. Herzog and Rodgers (1999) found
no mode effects using experimental data from the second
and third waves of AHEAD. With respect to training, there
is evidence that several hours of training can improve the
performance of older adults on tests of fluid, mechanical in-
telligence (Baltes, 1993). Evidence from the HRS for the
population aged 51Â­61, however, indicates that among that
age group learning effects as a result of multiple interviews
are relatively small (Herzog & Rodgers, 1999).
METHODS
Data: AHEAD93 and HRS98
The AHEAD and HRS surveys are sponsored by the Na-
tional Institute on Aging and conducted by the University
of Michigan. Details on the design of AHEAD can be
found in Soldo, Hurd, Rodgers, and Wallace (1997); the
HRS98 is described in detail at www.umich.edu/hrswww/.
Here we review the salient common features of the two sur-
veys and emphasize important differences relevant to our
analysis.
The first wave of AHEAD (AHEAD93) included a na-
tionally representative sample of initially noninstitutional-
ized persons born in 1923 or earlier (aged 70 and older in
1993). Sampled persons were re-interviewed in 1995 and
again in 1998. The HRS began in 1992 with a cohort of
noninstitutionalized persons born in 1931Â­1941 (aged 51Â­
61 in 1992). Sampled persons and their spouses have been
re-interviewed at 2-year intervals. In the fourth wave (the
CHANGES IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT S103
HRS98), the HRS and AHEAD surveys were merged and
missing cohorts added to form a uniform survey of individ-
uals aged 51 and older in 1998. Thus, the first wave of
AHEAD and the fourth wave of the HRS provide nationally
representative cross-sections of the noninstitutionalized popu-
lation aged 70 and older in 1993 and 1998, respectively.
The AHEAD93 and HRS98 share several essential de-
sign features that make comparisons across the samples
possible. Because the overarching purpose of both studies is
to provide an understanding of the implications of health
dynamics in late life for transitions in economic well-being
and for reliance on public and private support systems, large
sections of the questionnaires are comparable across sur-
veys. In addition, in both surveys, households were selected
on the basis of a multistage area probability sample plan,
with oversampling of Blacks, Hispanics, and Florida resi-
dents. Weights provided for both years compensate for the
differential probabilities of selection and are poststratified
to the Current Population Survey (CPS) by age, sex, race,
ethnicity, and marital status groups to account for differen-
tial nonresponse. Response rates were approximately 80%
in the first wave of AHEAD. Early calculations suggest that
response rates to the HRS98 are of a similar level.
Four potentially important differences between the sur-
veys are worth noting. First, AHEAD93 is a survey of the
noninstitutionalized population, but the HRS98 includes
sampled persons from earlier waves who are in an institu-
tion at the time of the interview. To make the samples com-
parable, we excluded the institutionalized respondents in
1998 and adjusted the weights of remaining respondents so
that the weighted noninstitutionalized population matches
poststratification totals of the July 1998 CPS.
Second, important changes in the preferred mode of inter-
view took place between the two surveys. In AHEAD93,
the preferred mode for respondents 80 years and older was a
face-to-face interview, whereas younger respondents were
generally interviewed by telephone. In HRS98, the pre-
ferred mode for respondents 80 years and older and those
interviewed for the first time (including most 70Â­74-year-
olds) was a face-to-face interview, and other respondents
were generally interviewed by telephone. Consequently, 61%
of AHEAD93 respondents had a telephone interview whereas
only 51% of HRS98 respondents did so. In both years, ac-
tual mode assignment was determined by a combination of
factors including the health status of the respondent, with
those interviewed in person generally in worse health than
those interviewed by telephone. However, a randomized de-
sign to test mode effects (built into the second and third
waves of AHEAD) has suggested that mode itself has no
significant effect on cognitive functioning scores (Herzog &
Rodgers, 1999). Given this finding and the possibility that
mode in part reflects cognitive functioning (rather than vice
versa), we omitted mode from our models. Sensitivity anal-
yses (not shown) suggested our results are robust to the ex-
clusion of this variable.
Third, the procedures according to which proxy respon-
dents were recruited differed slightly between the two
surveys. In the AHEAD93 interviewers were instructed to
attempt to obtain interviews with the sampled person when-
ever possible. Individuals unable to complete the survey be-
cause of a physical or cognitive limitation (and less often
those unavailable or with language difficulties) were al-
lowed to have proxy informants report for them. In the
HRS98 the same general approach was followed but an ad-
ditional criterion was implemented: Those who scored less
than a threshold score on a portion of the cognitive test trig-
gered a signal to the interviewer that either a proxy should
be sought or someone should be asked to assist the respon-
dent for the remainder of the interview. In 27 cases in our
sample, the proxy interview was completed, and proxy an-
swers superseded responses provided by the sampled person
(excluding their cognitive test scores). To avoid introducing
bias into our comparisons, we used the cognitive test scores
of these 27 respondents and classified them as self-respon-
dents.
Finally, the surveys differ with respect to potential learning
effects. Nearly three fourths of respondents to the HRS98 an-
swered the cognitive tests in a prior interview, whereas no
AHEAD93 respondents had the opportunity to do so (be-
cause AHEAD93 was the baseline wave of AHEAD). Al-
though we were not able to control for both year and prior
tests in our models, we did explore the effect of prior tests on
the risk of severe cognitive impairment among self-respon-
dents in 1998. We found that, controlling for other demo-
graphic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors, having
one or more prior tests had only a small effect on the odds of
being severely impaired (OR  0.83) and this effect was not
statistically different from 1.0 (95% CI  0.43Â­1.6).
We used the public release version of the AHEAD93 and
the preliminary release of the HRS98. The HRS98 data have
not been cleaned and may contain errors that will be cor-
rected in the final public release version of the data set.
Sample sizes for the population aged 70 and older were
7,443 in the AHEAD93 and 7,624 in the HRS98.
Measures
Cognitive functioning.--The AHEAD93 and HRS98
surveys included identical tools to measure the cognitive
functioning of sampled persons. In both surveys, research-
ers developed separate modules to gather information on the
cognitive status of persons who answered for themselves
(hereafter, self-respondents) and those who had responses
provided about them by a proxy (hereafter, proxy respon-
dents).
Questions to elicit the cognitive functioning of self-respon-
dents in the AHEAD93 and HRS98 were from a modified
version of the TICS instrument (Brandt et al., 1988). The cog-
nitive tests appeared in a slightly different order in the
AHEAD93 and HRS98 but included the same items. In both
years there were six tasks yielding a maximum of 35 points,
with higher scores implying better functioning. Four memory
and two executive functioning tasks were included: (a) an im-
mediate recall test, which required recalling as many words
as possible from a list of 10 commonly used words immedi-
ately after the interviewer read the list (10 points); (b) a de-
layed recall test of the same list, approximately 5 min after
the list was read (10 points); (c) naming the day of the week
and the date (i.e., month, day, and year; 4 points); (d) naming
the object that people usually use to cut paper, the kind of
S104 FREEDMAN ET AL.
prickly plant that grows in the desert, the president of the
United States, and the vice president (4 points); (e) a serial 7s
test that required subtracting 7 from 100 five times (5 points);
and (f) counting backwards from 20 for 10 consecutive num-
bers (2 points). The major difference between the TICS and
the AHEAD/HRS cognitive batteries is that the latter in-
cluded an additional delayed word recall test and excluded
tests of aphasia (asking respondents to repeat phrases),
apraxia (asking respondents to tap on the phone), and a test of
naming opposites. Thus, the AHEAD93 and HRS98 ques-
tions provided measures of both short- and long-term mem-
ory and executive functioning (serial 7s and counting back-
ward), with the scale much more heavily weighted toward
measuring memory impairments. In terms of the dichotomy
between fluid and crystallized cognition, the scale probably
taps both dimensions but is more heavily weighted toward
measures related to fluid cognitive mechanics.
Missing information was handled in an identical fashion
in both years. For those who refused an entire task, we fol-
lowed Herzog and Wallace's (1997) suggestion of assigning
those who refused the immediate recall task a score of 2 out
of 10, those who refused the delayed recall a score of 0 out
of 10, and those who refused the serial 7s a score of 1 out of
5. This imputation was based on Herzog and Wallace's find-
ing that those who refused a task performed worse on other
subscales than those who gave responses for all subscales.
For those who refused or reported that they did not know a
specific item within a subscale, we assigned the item a score
of 0. We also explored alternative codings for nonresponse
(e.g., assigning a score of 0 to subscales with missing items,
deleting cases with missing items).
We used the total score from the six tasks to identify
those with severe cognitive impairment. Because there is no
accepted cutoff score for identifying those with severe cog-
nitive impairment, we looked to the literature for guidance.
The original TICS used 30 (out of 41) as a cutoff, but that
scale did not include the more difficult delayed recall task.
For the cognition scale in the AHEAD93 survey, Herzog
and Wallace (1997) suggested that a cutoff of 8 (out of 35)
identifies a percentage of the population consistent with gen-
erally observed estimates of severe cognitive impairment.
We adopted this latter suggestion in both years but also ex-
plored the sensitivity of our analysis to this definition.
We based our classification of those with proxy respon-
dents on reports about the sampled person's memory and
judgment. Proxies were asked "How would you rate [re-
spondent's] memory at the present time? Would you say it
is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?" and "How
would you rate [respondent] in making judgments and deci-
sions? Would you say he/she is excellent, very good, good,
fair, or poor?" Among proxy respondents, we defined se-
vere cognitive impairment as those who were reported to
have poor memory and poor judgment. We also explored al-
ternative coding schemes (e.g., weighting poor memory
more heavily to be consistent with the self-respondent scale,
using only poor memory to identify severe impairment).
Independent variables.--Our analyses were intended to
address the question of whether aggregate changes between
1993 and 1998 in cognitive functioning among older per-
sons are statistically significant, and if so, whether they re-
main significant after controlling for demographic and so-
cioeconomic shifts and changes in selected health-related
characteristics. The key variable of interest in our analyses was
an indicator of survey year (i.e., coded 1 for respondents in
the HRS98 and 0 for respondents in the AHEAD93).
In selecting control variables for this analysis, we aimed
to include only questions that were identical in the AHEAD93
and HRS98. Nevertheless, we were able to control for many
demographic, socioeconomic, and health-related factors.
Demographic variables included age (in 5-year age groups),
sex, race (distinguishing non-White and White), Hispanic
origin, and marital status (not married at the time of the sur-
vey vs currently married). Socioeconomic variables in-
cluded a measure of whether the sample person or his or her
spouse had any liquid assets (defined as a checking or sav-
ings account or money market funds) and completed level
of education (less than high school, high school graduate,
more than high school). We also explored the effects of
finer gradations of education (e.g., including an indicator of
completing less than 8 years of education as distinct from
8Â­11 years of completed education; distinguishing some
college education from completing college; using a continu-
ous indicator of years of completed education), but found
our conclusions robust to such alternative parameteriza-
tions. In an attempt to control for intergenerational trans-
mission of cognitive abilities, we also included an indicator
of the sampled person's mother's educational level (8
years, 8 years, unknown). In doing so, we made no at-
tempt to distinguish genetic correlations from environmen-
tally based intergenerational transmission in early life, but
we recognized that either could contribute to functioning.
We included three measures of health related to cognitive
functioning: ever having a stroke, having poor eyesight, and
having poor hearing. We also investigated numerous other
chronic conditions (e.g., having ever had high blood pres-
sure, diabetes, cancer, chronic lung disease, heart condition,
arthritis) and lifestyle factors (e.g., current smoking status),
but they generally did not have statistically significant ef-
fects on cognitive functioning nor did they change our con-
clusion about aggregate changes in cognitive functioning.
We therefore excluded these variables for the sake of parsi-
mony. We also explored the linkages among self-rated health,
depression, and severe cognitive impairment but chose not
to include these measures because of the uncertainty of the
direction of their effects in cross-sectional samples (for dis-
cussion of this point with respect to depression, see Parmelee
et al., 1991).
Statistical Methods
Because the measures of severe cognitive impairment
differed for self- and proxy respondents, we stratified all
analyses by proxy status. This approach explicitly controls
for the effects of proxy status while allowing for potentially
different thresholds for identifying the severely impaired
between the two groups.
We tested for changes over time in the percentage with
severe impairment (among self-respondents and among proxy
respondents) using chi-square tests for independence. Among
self-respondents we also used t tests to assess changes over
CHANGES IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT S105
time in the mean score for each of the subscales and for the
total cognitive score. We tested for changes in sample char-
acteristics over time and changes in the percentage with
cognitive impairment among various subgroups of self- and
proxy respondents using chi-square tests for independence.
To explore whether changes in severe impairment were
due to shifts in the composition of the population, we used
logistic regression. We first estimated odds ratios and 95%
confidence intervals from models including only a term for
year (1998 vs 1993). We then estimated odds ratios and
95% confidence intervals from models controlling for de-
mographic and socioeconomic characteristics, health-related
factors, and testing factors. Statistical significance of differ-
ences between self- and proxy respondents were obtained
from a single model in which proxy status was interacted
with all covariates.
The AHEAD93 and HRS98 employed different sampling
fractions for the youngest sample members (in the HRS98,
persons aged 70Â­74 were sampled at 60% the rate of those
in the AHEAD93). We therefore weighted all analyses.
Because the HRS98 is a preliminary release, information
on sampling units has not yet been made publicly available.
Consequently, it was not possible to adjust standard errors
for the complex design of the surveys. All p values and con-
fidence intervals presented were therefore based on the as-
sumption that the AHEAD93 and HRS98 are simple ran-
dom samples. We were able to explore the implications of
this assumption for our analysis using design effects esti-
mated for the AHEAD93 (for which sampling unit informa-
tion is available). We found for self-respondents the design
effects for the variables in our models ranged from 0.54 to
1.82; similarly, for proxy respondents the design effects
ranged from 0.57 to 1.66. (We calculated these effects by
taking the ratio of the variances produced by SUDAAN to
the variances produced by SAS for the full logistic regres-
sion models.) Even if we assumed the design effects for
changes over time were the size of the largest AHEAD93
design effect (i.e., 1.82), the overwhelming majority of tests
significant at the .05 level in our tables remained so. More-
over, unless otherwise noted, our conclusions about aggre-
gate changes over time in cognitive functioning remained
robust to such design effects.
Finally, we explored an additional adjustment to compen-
sate for the fact that many respondents (N  4,812) ap-
peared in both the AHEAD93 and HRS98 samples. We cal-
culated these overlap effects, which increase the efficiency
of estimates of changes over time, separately for the self-
and proxy respondent samples using Kish's (1965, pp. 457Â­
458) formula for variances of differences between two over-
lapping samples. In this application, the overlap effects
were 0.81 and 0.90 for self- and proxy respondents, respec-
tively. Applying these overlap effects to the design-effect
adjusted variances for year in our logistic regression models
did not change our conclusions about aggregate changes
over time in cognitive functioning.
RESULTS
The percentage of older adults with severe cognitive im-
pairment declined between 1993 and 1998. As shown in Ta-
ble 1, among self-respondents, the proportion of the older
population with severe impairment declined from 4.7% in
1993 to 2.3% in 1998 (p  .001). Among proxy respondents,
the proportion with severe impairment was much higher in
both years, but the decline from 18.3% in 1993 to 16.3% in
1998 was not statistically significant at the .05 level.
The improvements among self-respondents did not appear
to be the result of improvements on any particular subscale;
mean scores for each of the four subscales increased over time
(p  .001) as did the mean total score (p  .001). In contrast,
among proxy respondents, there appeared to be a statistically
significant decline in the proportion with poor memory (p 
.05) but not poor judgment. This decline in poor memory is
likely to be significant only at the .10 level once design and
overlap effects are taken into account, however.
Improvements among self-respondents were also un-
likely to be accounted for by increases over time in the pro-
portion of proxy respondents; on the contrary, the propor-

tion of proxy respondents declined slightly from 10.5% in
1993 to 9.1% in 1998 (p  .01).
Improvements among self-respondents persisted irre-
spective of the coding scheme for refusals (see Table 2). Al-
though the level of severe impairment changed depending
on whether refusals were given low scores, assigned a zero,
or deleted altogether, the percentage classified as severely
impaired consistently declined over time, while the mean
subscale and total scores increased.
Patterns among self- and proxy respondents also appeared to
be robust to alternative definitions of severe (see Table 3).
Among self-respondents declines in severe cognitive impair-
ment were observed irrespective of whether we used a cutoff of
6, 8, or 10 to identify the severely impaired (p  .001). Among
proxy respondents, no significant change was evident for a
scheme that weighted memory more heavily than judgment.
Over the same period, the composition of the older popu-
lation also changed substantially on several factors previ-
ously shown to be related to cognitive impairment. As
shown in Table 4, among self-respondents, the most sub-
stantial change was in educational attainment, with the pro-
portion who had not graduated from high school declining
from almost 40% to 32%. Also substantial were improve-
ments in mother's education and ownership of liquid assets

CHANGES IN COGNITIVE IMPAIRMENT S107
and increases in reports of poor hearing. And, as noted ear-
lier, more of the interviews in 1998 were conducted in per-
son. Among those for whom proxies responded, there were
substantial increases in mother's education and ownership
of liquid assets.
As shown in Table 5, among the vast majority of sub-
groups of self-respondents, the percentage with severe cogni-
tive impairment declined. Perhaps most striking were results
for the oldest age group: among self-respondents, only 7.6%
of those aged 85 and older in 1998 were severely impaired
compared to 13.5% in 1993. Moreover, the improvements
were unusually consistent across groups: Statistically signifi-
cant improvements (p  .05) were observed for all subgroups
except those of Hispanic origin, those who were high school
graduates only, and those whose ownership of liquid assets
was unknown. Small sample sizes and insufficient power
could possibly explain the lack of significant improvement
for the first and third groups. In the case of Hispanics, under
the simple random sample assumptions we used to calculate
significance levels, the change over time was borderline in-
significant (p  .051). It was unclear whether this change
would be statistically significant after taking into account all
survey design-related effects (e.g., oversampling of Hispanics
in both years, clustering of Hispanics in geographic areas,
and overlapping of Hispanic respondents in both samples),
because the design components operated in both directions.
For other subgroups, significant improvements were likely to
persist after taking into consideration potential design effects,
except for those subgroups in Table 5 with a p value between
.01 and .05. In contrast, among proxy respondents the vast
majority of subgroups did not experience significant declines
in the proportion with severe impairment.
The patterns in cognitive functioning we observed were
sustained when we tested for change over time in a multivari-
ate model (Table 6). Among self-respondents, in the year-only
model, the odds of being severely impaired in 1998 were
about half the odds in 1993 (OR  0.49, 95% CI  0.40Â­
0.59). Compared to the year-only model, the odds ratio was
only slightly attenuated in the full model; that is, after we con-
trolled for socioeconomic and demographic characteristics
and select health-related factors, the odds ratio for 1998 versus
1993 was 0.57 (95% CI  0.47Â­0.70). Among proxy respon-
dents, in both models the odds of being severely impaired
were approximately 13Â­14% lower in 1998 than in 1993 (i.e.,
1.0  0.87 in the year-only model and 1.0  0.86 in the full
model), but these differences were not statistically significant.
Among self-respondents, being 80 and older, being non-
White, having less than a high school diploma, having no
liquid assets, and ever having had a stroke were especially
strong predictors of having severe cognitive impairment,
raising one's odds of being impaired twofold or more. Be-
ing a high school graduate and having additional education
(the omitted category) did not differ in their effects. Other
factors raising the odds of impairment were being Hispanic,
having a mother who received fewer than 8 years of educa-
tion, and having hearing problems.
A smaller set of variables was important in predicting se-
vere cognitive impairment among proxy respondents. More-
over, many of those predictors had different effects for
proxy respondents than for self-respondents, as indicated by
the chi-square tests in the final column of Table 6. For ex-
ample, among the proxy respondent sample, those with less
than a high school education were less likely than others to
be described as having poor memory and judgment, whereas
effects were just the opposite among self-respondents. Be-
ing non-White and having no liquid assets had effects only
among self-respondents, but having poor vision had an ef-
fect only in the proxy sample.

aged 70 and older with severe cognitive impairment declined
between 1993 and 1998. Among respondents who answered

the cognitive interview for themselves, improvements are
large and statistically significant. For respondents evaluated
by proxies, we observe declines in the proportion with poor
memory but not with poor judgment. The overall decline does
not appear to be an artifact of decisions about coding refusals
or definitions of severe impairment. Further, the patterns we
observe are robust to controls for a variety of demographic
and socioeconomic factors and health-related characteristics.
Our finding that improvements occurred among self-respon-
dents but not proxy respondents is noteworthy. In both
years, it appears that a core group of respondents could not
answer for themselves because of severe cognitive impair-
ment and thus participated in the survey through proxy re-
spondents. Moreover, in both years, those for whom a proxy
responded constitute a select group, less healthy according
to measures we included, more likely to be from a minority
population, and more likely to be of low socioeconomic
status than those responding for themselves. It may be that
the severity of impairment declined among the proxy re-
spondent group, but our proxy-provided measures of severe
impairment for this group may not be sensitive enough to
identify subtle changes. Notwithstanding this potential weak-
ness, our results suggest that the improvements we find
among self-respondents are not due to a change in the pro-
portion of proxy respondents over time.
How do our results compare to other studies of trends in
cognitive functioning? Such comparisons are difficult to
make, even for a single year, given that existing studies dif-
fer from ours with respect to years studied, age groups, and
measures of cognitive impairment. Nevertheless, our find-
ings agree with the general pattern of historical improve-
ment summarized by Salthouse (1991). For example, on the
basis of Schaie (1983), whose sample of adults aged 25Â­67
is biased toward upper socioeconomic groups, Salthouse
(1991) reported improvements from 1959 to 1991 across
five primary mental abilities of, on average, 0.07 standard
T-score units (a distribution with M  50 and SD  10) per
year. Limiting this exercise to those in the upper age range
for dimensions with significant improvement (verbal and
reasoning skills), we calculate improvements on the order of
0.20 standard T-score units per year. Among self-respon-
dents in our sample, who were aged 70 and older, we find
much larger improvements: Mean scores increase from 19.6
in 1993 to 21.1 in 1998, estimates comparable to improve-
ments of 0.55 standard T-score units per year.
The improvements we find are also somewhat larger in
percentage terms than those observed during the 1980s and
early 1990s for measures of physical disability, which have
ranged roughly from 1% to 2% per year. Our estimates of de-
cline are much larger: For the noninstitutionalized population
aged 70 and older, relative annual declines are on the order of
8% per year over the 5-year period. In making such compari-
sons it is important to keep in mind that the base for calculat-
ing percentage change is much smaller for cognitive than for
physical impairment, so even small percentage point im-
provements (2.5 percentage points in this case) appear to be
quite large gains (more than 40% improvement over 5 years).
What could be causing such large improvements? Under-
lying the decline in severe cognitive impairment we observe
are undoubtedly complex shifts in the incidence of and
length of time lived in the community with severe cognitive
impairment, the latter being a function of recovery rates,

nursing home admission and discharge rates, and mortality
rates. Although data are not yet available for us to calculate
the relative contribution of these components to aggregate
changes in cognitive impairment, our analysis permits us to
speculate about several potential explanations for the shifts
we observe. The first two possible explanations relate to
survey design and selection issues; the remaining discussion
focuses on potential environmental changes related to medi-
cine, behavioral lifestyle factors, and cultural factors.
With respect to survey design matters, one possibility is
that older persons with severe cognitive impairment are more
likely in 1998 than in 1993 to be in institutional settings (and
hence outside the scope of our analysis). However, there is
evidence that the size of the nursing home population may
have declined slightly as a percentage of the older population
during the late 1980s and early 1990s (Bishop, 1999), so this
explanation is unlikely. It may be that within nursing homes,
severely cognitively impaired residents represent an increas-
ing share of the residents, a hypothesis consistent with the in-
crease in special care units devoted to Alzheimer's disease
and related dementias during this period (Rhoades & Krauss,
1999). Our calculations suggest, however, that to fully ex-
plain the improvements we find the percentage of severely
impaired residents in nursing homes would have had to in-
crease from 40% to 100% over this 5-year period, an increase
we believe is implausible, given estimates from the early
1990s of 60Â­70% of nursing home residents having demen-
tia-related symptoms (Rovner & Katz, 1993).
Another possible explanation related to survey design is
that those with cognitive limitations may have been more
likely than others to have been lost to follow-up over time.
At this writing, accurate data on nonresponse to the HRS98
are not yet available, so we explored this issue using the sec-
ond wave of AHEAD. We found that among respondents to
the first wave of AHEAD, 4.2% of those followed up in
1995 in the community were severely cognitively impaired
in 1993, whereas 8.7% of those lost to follow-up (but not
dead) in 1995 were severely impaired at baseline. We also
found that controlling for variables used to poststratify the
data (e.g., age, sex, marital status, race/ethnicity) did not
fully explain these differentials. We interpreted these results
for 1993 and 1995 as evidence that poststratification to the
CPS in 1998 probably accounts for some but not all of the
differential loss to follow-up by cognitive status. On the ba-
sis of these findings, we calculated what the rate of severe
cognitive impairment might have been in 1998 had there
been no loss to follow-up in the AHEAD between 1993 and
1998. In making these calculations we assumed that the ratio
of deaths to missing cases was the same in 1998 as it was in
1995 (roughly 2:1), which yielded a nonresponse rate of ap-
proximately 11%. We also assumed the rate of severe im-
pairment in 1998 among those who were lost to follow-up
was equal to the rate in 1993 for those eventually lost to fol-
low-up (8.7%). We found that, under these assumptions, the
rate of severe impairment would have been 4.1% in 1998,
rather than the 3.6% we found for that year. The revised ag-
gregate change--from 6.1% in 1993 to 4.1% in 1998, or on
average a decline of 7% per year--would likely still be sta-
tistically significant for a sample of this size.
Assuming survey design issues do not fully explain the
improvements we are finding, are there environmental fac-
tors that may be responsible? Certainly changes in the treat-
ment of dementia and related co-morbid conditions such as
depression, stroke, and nutritional deficits (e.g., electrolyte
imbalances) may be contributing to the better maintenance,
and in some cases recovery, of cognitive functioning. In ad-
ditional analyses limited to respondents appearing in both
the AHEAD93 and HRS98, we observed roughly 60% of
those classified as having severe impairment in 1993 were
not severely impaired in 1998. Moreover, among respon-
dents completing the cognitive test in both years, approxi-
mately half scored the same or better in 1998 than they did
in 1993. Such individual-level improvements are consistent
with the growing array of treatment options for older Amer-
icans with cognitive deficits and related co-morbidities, but
with these data it is difficult to sort out specific treatments
related to the improvements we observe. For example, the
approval in the late 1990s of new drug treatments for Alz-
heimer's disease (e.g., Donepezil in 1997) might be ex-
pected to improve functioning (McRae, 1999); however, such
treatments are generally limited to those in the early stages
of Alzheimer's rather than those with severe cognitive im-
pairment (the group we focused on in our analysis). Im-
provements in stroke treatment may be partly responsible;
however, our findings suggest that changes in ever having a
stroke explain little of the decline we observe in severe cog-
nitive impairment. Improvements in cognition may also be
the result of the expanded availability of treatments for de-
pression; indeed, in exploratory analyses we found aggre-
gate-level declines in the presence of depressive symptom-
ology among self-respondents, and others have shown strong
correlations between individual-level cognition and depres-
sion scores (Parmelee et al., 1991). Analysis of panel data is
required to untangle the complex relationship among treat-
ment protocols, cognition, and co-morbidities, a topic that
clearly needs further investigation.
Changes in other important behavioral and lifestyle factors
may also be contributing to better maintenance of cognitive
functioning in old age. We looked at some lifestyle factors
(e.g., current smoking) but did not find any significant effect
on the prevalence of severe cognitive impairment. Over this
period, estrogen use, which may affect cognitive function-
ing--particularly memory--in postmenopausal women (Shay-
witz & Shaywitz, 2000), also increased dramatically (DuBois,
Chawla, Neslusan, Smith, & Wade, 2000). Our finding that
both men and women experience improvements in cognitive
functioning suggests estrogen use alone cannot fully explain
observed improvements. Further research on the link between
these and other potentially important behavioral and lifestyle
factors (e.g., dietary habits, vitamin supplementation, exer-
cise) and cognitive functioning in old age could prove to be
illuminating.
A final possibility is that there may be broad social
changes at work that are not captured by our models. Others
have suggested that changes in the quality of education
(e.g., in terms of curriculum, class size, teacher preparation)
could account for some of the time-related improvements in
cognitive ability, although there is little agreement on direc-
tion of such changes, and evidence based on school-aged
children does not support such an argument (Salthouse,
S110 FREEDMAN ET AL.
1991). The fact that the improvements we observed were
most salient among those with less than a high school edu-
cation draws attention to the possibility that cultural forces
outside the classroom may be at work. For example, changes
in the culture of testing outside the classroom may make
more recent cohorts of elderly persons--particularly those
with less than a high school education--better equipped to
answer cognitive tests. Others have noted the conflicting
views on the role of multimedia and information technology
on the minds of both young and old (Baltes's Foreword in
Schaie, 1996), but our results suggest, on balance, no net
negative effect for older Americans of the recent technolog-
ical explosion in our society.
Irrespective of the underlying causes, this study provides
a first step in understanding how cognitive functioning may
have changed recently among older Americans. The prelim-
inary evidence is quite positive: As a group, older persons,
especially those well into their 80s, appear to have better
cognitive functioning today than they did in the early 1990s.
Although we have only two data points, making it impossi-
ble to draw conclusions about long-term trends, these find-
ings suggest that the improvement in physical functioning
observed in recent years among older Americans may have
been accompanied by improvements in cognitive function-
ing. How the two trends interrelate is unclear. It may be that
improved cognitive functioning accounts for much of the
decline in IADL disability observed during the 1980s and
early 1990s; alternatively, improvements in underlying
health may be driving both physical and cognitive function-
ing. Untangling the complex relationship between improve-
ments in the mind and in the body in old age is a fruitful
area for further research.
A recent report by the National Research Council (Stern
& Carstensen, 2000) on future directions for cognitive re-
search on aging highlighted the plasticity of the human
mind, even well into old age. Indeed, one of the most widely
known models of cognitive functioning in old age, Baltes's
model of selective optimization with compensation (Baltes
& Baltes, 1990), describes a highly adaptive phenomena in
which the cognitive processes of older persons can be en-
hanced under favorable environmental conditions. Our find-
ings suggest that cognitive ability should also be considered
a dynamic phenomenon at the aggregate level. This conclu-
sion suggests in turn that policymakers interested in project-
ing medical and social service needs may well consider how
future trends in cognitive functioning might affect demand
for acute and long-term care services.

Note: In mid-January, the University of Michigan released a new set of
weights for the HRS and AHEAD and updated information on loss-to-fol-
low-up. Using the revised weights, we found a statistically significant
decline from 5.8% with severe impairment in 1993 to 3.5% in 1998 and
substantially similar logistic regression coefficients and standard errors.
Using the new loss-to-follow-up information (which showed only 6.3% of
the original cohort missing by 1998 and only 4.3% of those cases severely
impaired at baseline) and various assumptions about incidence and recov-
ery among those lost to follow-up, we estimated that the 1998 prevalence
rate would fall in the 3.8% to 4.3% range, still a statistically significant de-
cline. Incorporating assumptions about the institutionalized population into
these estimates, we found a statistically significant decline, from 8.6% in
1993 to somewhere in the 6.5% to 7.5% range in 1998.
