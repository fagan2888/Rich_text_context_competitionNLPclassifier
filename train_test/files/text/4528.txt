Abstract
Objective: To investigate changes in standard base excess (SBE) when administering two different
infusion regimens for elective hip replacement within a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm.
Methods: This prospective, double-blind, randomized, controlled study enrolled patients
scheduled for primary hip replacement surgery, who were randomized to receive either an
unbalanced crystalloid (chloride: 155.5 mmol/l) or a 1 : 1 mixture of a balanced crystalloid and a
balanced colloid (6% w/v hydroxyethyl starch 130/0.42; chloride: 98 and 112 mmol/l, respectively).
Fluid management was goal-directed to optimize stroke volume using oesophageal Doppler.
Results: A total of 40 patients (19 female/21 male) participated in the study. After surgery, median
(25­75% percentiles) SBE was significantly lower in the unbalanced group compared with the
balanced group: À2.0 mmol/l (À3.1 to À1.1) versus À0.4 mmol/l (À1.2 to 0.7), respectively.
This difference was mainly due to greater plasma chloride concentrations in the unbalanced group.
The amount of study medication required to reach haemodynamic stability (median 1200 ml) did
not differ between the two groups.
Conclusion: SBE decreased in the unbalanced group without influence on fluid requirements and
haemodynamic stability.

Introduction
Every year, an estimated 234.2 million
operative procedures are performed world-
wide.1 The overall mortality rate after sur-
gery is 4% and varies between countries.1,2
Intraoperative fluid and volume therapy is a
cornerstone of perioperative care, and goal-
directed therapy has been shown to substan-
tially reduce postoperative complication
rates and hospital length of stay in different
types of surgery.3
There is controversy about the kind of
intravenous solutions (unbalanced versus
balanced; crystalloids versus colloids) that
should be used for fluid replacement and
haemodynamic optimization.4,5 Compared
with 0.9% (w/v) sodium chloride (NaCl;
containing 154 mmol/l Naþ and 154 mmol/l
ClÀ), balanced solutions have an electrolyte
composition closer to plasma and contain
bases such as acetate and lactate that can be
metabolized to bicarbonate, so they are
therefore also referred to as buffered solu-
tions. However, although in acute trauma a
decrease of the base excess presumably due
to hyperlactataemia is a strong indicator for
an increased morbidity and mortality,6­9
unbalanced solutions are still widely used
despite an additional decreasing effect on
base excess through hyperchloraemic
acidosis.10­13
For short-lasting elective (trauma) sur-
gery, crystalloids are generally recom-
mended for perioperative fluid and volume
replacement;14,15 in contrast to this, goal-
directed haemodynamic management in
trauma surgery is regularly performed with
colloid solutions.16,17
To date, there have not been any studies
that have compared the usual standard, i.e.
an unbalanced crystalloid, with an infusion
strategy that uses a mixture of both
balanced crystalloids and colloids within
a goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm.
Earlier studies researching this issue could
not exclude interference with occult hypo-
perfusion or hypervolaemia as they neither
measured circulatory flow nor did they guide
the administration of study fluids by
advanced target controlled haemodynamic
monitoring.12,13 With regard to the current
concept of infusion therapy, hydroxyethyl
starch (HES) should only be used for
acute blood loss in noncritically ill patients
without kidney disease.18
The primary objective of this present
study was to investigate changes in the
standard base excess (SBE) as a key par-
ameter of the metabolic acid­base status
when applying two different infusion regi-
mens for elective hip replacement within a
goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm. In
one group, an unbalanced chloride rich
crystalloid solution was infused, whereas in
the other group a balanced crystalloid
mixed 1 : 1 with a balanced colloid was
infused. Both concepts are considered
standard treatments in different medical
communities around the world. As second-
ary outcome measures, further acid­base
parameters, the amount of perioperative
fluid infusions applied, haemodynamic
parameters and renal function were
investigated.
Patients and methods
Study design
The study was conducted as a single-
centre, randomized, double-blind,
Krebbel et al. 469
parallel-group study, registered with
Clinicaltrials.gov (NCT01117519) and
EudraCT (2009-016043-19) and approved
by the Bundesinstitut fu
¨ r Arzneimittel und
Medizinprodukte (BfArM-Nr. 4036063).
Ethics approval was obtained from the
Landesamt fu
¨ r Gesundheit und Soziales
(LaGeSo), Ethical Committee of Berlin
(chairman of board 6: Dr J. Hamann),
Germany, on 26 April 2010 (ZS EK 15
100/10).
Eligible patients were !60 years old and
scheduled for primary elective hip replace-
ment surgery in the Centre of Musculoske-
letal Surgery, University Hospital Charite
´ ,
Campus Charite
´ Mitte, Berlin, Germany,
between May 2010 and November 2011.
Written informed consent was obtained
from each patient at least 1 day prior to
surgery.
The patients were stratified preopera-
tively according to the American Society
of Anesthesiologists Physical Status
Classification System (ASA 1 and 2 versus
ASA 3 to rule out confounding due to an
impaired health status).19 To determine
demographic and clinical characteristics
beside ASA, the risk for postoperative
nausea and vomiting (APFEL score),20 the
Physiological and Operative Severity Score
for the enUmeration of Mortality and
Morbidity (POSSUM) score,21,22 the Mini
Mental State Exam (MMSE) points,23 the
health status (EQ-5D) of the EuroQol group
on admission,24 and the postoperative cog-
nitive deficit (POCD) using the Cambridge
Neuropsychological Test Automated
Battery (CANTAB) and International
Study of Post-Operative Cognitive Dysfunc-
tion (ISPOCD) neuropsychological bat-
teries were measured.25 Complications were
documented according to the Clavien­
Dindo classification.26 There was an exten-
sive list of exclusion criteria, which is
available from the corresponding author
upon request. The study ended according
to schedule.
Study groups
The study medications for intraoperative
fluid management were either buffer-free
Ringer's solutionÕ (Baxter, Unters-
chleißheim, Germany), containing no bases
degradable to bicarbonate ions, alone
(unbalanced group), or Plasma-LyteÕ (crys-
talloid) combined with Plasma Volume
RedibagÕ (colloid, 6% HES 130/0.42) in a
1 : 1 ratio (Baxter) (balanced group)
(Table 1).
Randomization into the two study
groups was accomplished using computer-
generated random numbers and performed
in blocks of four. For blinding, consecu-
tively numbered (randomization numbers)
closed envelopes were used, which contained
the coded assignment to the therapy.
Buffer-free Ringer's solution is character-
ized by its high chloride concentration
(155.5 mmol/l), which resembles the chloride
concentration of 0.9% (w/v) saline
(154 mmol/l). Although it does not contain
any buffer such as lactate or acetate, buffer-
free Ringer's solution contains sodium,
potassium and calcium as cations and not
just sodium as in saline solution. For sim-
plicity, in this study, the group who received
the unbuffered, chloride-rich Ringer's solu-
tion is called the unbalanced group. All
patients underwent general anaesthesia and
were operated upon by one of the authors
(C. P.) or by another surgeon under his
direct supervision.
Goal-directed therapy
During surgery, all patients were treated
according to a goal-directed therapy (GDT)
algorithm as previously published.3 Briefly,
in addition to standard monitoring, the fluid
responsiveness of all patients was monitored
by oesophageal Doppler (CardioQ­ODM
system; Deltex Medical, Chichester, UK).
The guidance parameter for fluid manage-
ment was stroke volume (SV). If the SV
470 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
increased by !10% after infusion of 200 ml
study fluid over 5 min, volume responsive-
ness was assumed and the fluid challenge
was repeated until the SV failed to rise by
10%. Thereafter, no further boluses of the
study fluid were given until a 10% decrease
in SV occurred. After fluid optimization,
mean arterial pressure (MAP) and cardiac
index (CI) served as safety parameters
within this algorithm. In this context, nor-
epinephrine, dobutamine or enoximon were
allowed to keep the MAP between 70­
90 mmHg and CI >2.5 l/min per m2 body
surface area.3 Previous routine data from
the Department of Anaesthesiology and
Intensive Care Medicine, Charite
´ ­
Universita
¨ tsmedizin Berlin, obtained with-
out goal-directed treatment showed that at
least 2 l of intravenous solutions were
administered during hip replacement.
An arterial line was inserted if this could
be accomplished within no more than two
attempts; otherwise blood pressure was
measured noninvasively. In both cases,
measurements were carried out using stand-
ard monitoring equipment (Philips
IntelliVue MP80TM patient monitor;
Philips Healthcare, Hamburg, Germany).
After induction of anaesthesia, arterial, or
in cases where arterial catheter insertion was
not feasible, peripheral venous blood gas
analyses (BGA) were performed every
15 min until the end of surgery, and every
30 min postoperatively until discharge from
the recovery room (ABL700 blood gas ana-
lyser; Radiometer Medical, Brønshøj,
Denmark).
Despite the different origins, all blood
samples were included in the analyses.
According to Toftegaard et al.27,28 it was

assumed in patients in this study (elective
surgery, no critical illness, GDT to rule out
hypoperfusion) that the change of base
excess across the tissue side (from arterial
to venous) was close to zero. During the
course of the operation, the mean values for
the haemodynamic parameters were calcu-
lated for all measured values over a 10-min
period and for the acid­base parameters for
all measured values over a 20-min period.
Acid­base calculations
As end expiratory CO2
was kept within the
normal range (35­45 mmHg), the pH was
calculated with regard to the different origins
(venous or arterial) of the BGA samples by
the Henderson­Hasselbalch equation
as [pHcalc
] ¼ 6.1 þ log ([cHCOÀ
3
-(P,st)]/
(0.0301 Â 40)), where [HCOÀ
3
-(P,st)] repre-
sents the standard bicarbonate concentration
in plasma. According to the Stewart­Fencl
approach, the respective contribution of (i)
free water (fw), (ii) chloride, (iii) serum albu-
min, and (iv) plasma lactate to base excess
(BE) was calculated as follows: (i) [BEfw
] ¼
0.3 Â ([Naþ] À 140); (ii) [BEClcorrected
]
¼ 102À(([ClÀ] Â (140/[Naþ]))À140/[Naþ]);
(iii) [BEalb
] ¼ (0.148Â pH À 0.818)Â
(42À([alb] Â 10)); and (iv) [BElac
] ¼ 1 À [lac-
tate] Â 9.01.29­33 The following units were
used within the calculations listed above:
serum albumin (Alb) in g/dl and plasma
lactate in mg/dl. Electrolytes, pH, blood
gases, lactate, haemoglobin and standard
bicarbonate (cHCOÀ
3
-(P,st)) were directly
measured using a radiometer (ABL700
blood gas analyser; Radiometer Medical).
Serum albumin was measured by the Institut
fu
¨ r Laboratoriumsmedizin, Charite
´ ­
Universita
¨ tsmedizin Berlin, Berlin, from an
arterial or venous blood sample collected
at the same time-point. All blood gas ana-
lyses were undertaken immediately after
collection of the blood sample. Blood sam-
ples for blood counts or blood chemistry
were sent immediately to the Institut fu
¨ r
Laboratoriumsmedizin, having been stored
at room temperature prior to analysis.
Kidney function parameters
Neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin
(NGAL) was determined using an NGAL
TestTM kit (BioPorto, Gentofte, Denmark).
Serum creatinine was measured by the
Institut fu
¨ r Laboratoriumsmedizin from an
arterial or venous blood sample collected at
the same time-point.
Statistical analyses
Results are expressed as median (25% and
75% percentiles) or frequencies (%), unless
otherwise specified. After checking the dis-
tributions for normality, differences between
the two groups were tested using nonpara-
metric exact Mann­Whitney tests for inde-
pendent groups or exact Wilcoxon tests for
pairwise comparisons. Frequencies were
compared using the exact Mantel­Haenszel
test (ordered categories) or the exact 2-test
in contingency tables. Changes in clinical
outcomes with regard to time were analysed
using multivariate nonparametric analysis
of longitudinal data in a two-factorial design
(1st [independent] factor: groups; 2nd
[dependent] factor: repetitions in time).
Therefore, all the time-points were simul-
taneously compared on the corresponding
response curves. In the multivariate analysis,
three hypotheses were tested: (i) differences
in groups (Group); (ii) differences in time
(Time); and (iii) one hypothesis about
interactions between the two factors
(Group Â Time). Lastly, each group was
checked for differences in time, separately.
Moreover, a nonparametric multivariate
analysis of covariance with the baseline as
the covariate was applied to adjust for
possible baseline influences in some of the
preceding analyses. After global testing, post
hoc analyses were carried out to detect
specific differences with respect to groups
472 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
for fixed times (Mann­Whitney tests). A
two-tailed P-value <0.05 was considered
statistically significant. All tests have to be
understood in the area of exploratory data
analysis. Therefore, no adjustments for mul-
tiple testing have been made. All numerical
calculations were performed using the
SPSSÕ statistical package, version 20.0
(SPSS Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) for
WindowsÕ, and the SASÕ statistical pack-
age, version 9.1 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC,
USA). Power calculations were performed
by nQuery AdvisorÕ version 7.0 (Statistical
Solutions, Cork, Ireland). All graphs were
created by `R ­ The project for statistical
computing', version 2.14.2 (2012-02-29).34
Results
Of the 152 patients assessed for eligibility, 41
patients who agreed to general anaesthesia
including the insertion of the oesophageal
Doppler probe were enrolled in the present
study (Figure 1). One of these patients had
to be excluded before receiving the study
medication because of a planned extension
of the operation, so 40 patients received
study fluids and their data were collected for
this study. All patients received cementless
hip replacement in the supine position using
a minimally invasive technique. The demo-
graphic and clinical characteristics of the
patients did not differ significantly between
the two groups (Table 2).
The SBE and pHcalc
were significantly
lower (Figure 2; P < 0.05 for all compari-
sons) and plasma chloride concentrations
were significantly greater (Table 3; P < 0.05
for all comparisons) in the unbalanced
group during (intraoperative course of
chloride not shown) and immediately after
surgery compared with the balanced group.
Analyses using the Stewart­Fencl
approach showed that the changes in SBE
were the result of changes in both chloride
concentration and albumin concentration,
whereas free water and serum lactate had no
influence on SBE in this setting (Figure 3).
In this context, there was a significantly
lower serum albumin concentration 1 h after
surgery in the balanced group compared
with the unbalanced group (P < 0.05) (Table
3). Time courses of plasma lactate, pCO2
,
and plasma potassium (data not shown), as
well as plasma sodium (Table 3), were
uneventful.
At 1 h postoperatively, there was still a
slight increase in plasma chloride in the
unbalanced group compared with baseline
and the concentration was significantly
greater compared with the balanced group
(P < 0.05) (Table 3); serum albumin and
serum protein concentrations were signifi-
cantly greater in this group compared with
the balanced group (P < 0.05 for all com-
parisons) (Table 3). A 6 h postoperatively,
there were no longer any significant differ-
ences in serum protein and serum albumin
concentrations between the groups (Table
3). The intraoperative time course of the
haemoglobin concentrations was similar
between the two groups (data not shown),
whereas at arrival in the recovery room, the
haemoglobin concentrations in the balanced
group were significantly lower compared
with the unbalanced group (P < 0.05). This
difference in the haemoglobin concentration
between the two groups had disappeared at
postoperative day 1 (Table 3).
As a result of GDT, which was guided by
SV optimization, equal volumes of study
fluids were administered to the two groups
(Figure 4a). The SV (Figure 4b), as well as
MAP, cardiac output and flow time cor-
rected (FTc) (data not shown), did not differ
significantly between the two groups during
surgery.
Patients in both groups received norepin-
ephrine. Neither the number of patients
(unbalanced group: 5 of 21 [23.8%];
balanced group: 3 of 19 [15.8%]) that
received norepinephrine nor the median

ation of treatment (data not shown) were
significantly different between the two

received dobutamine (maximum dose of
5 mg/kg per min).
At 1 h postoperatively, there were no
significant differences between the two
groups with regard to mean blood pressure
and heart rate (data not shown). No patient
received fresh frozen plasma, packed red
blood cells or thrombocyte concentrates
during surgery and/or in the recovery
room. Within the first hour in the recovery
room, patients from both groups received
the same amounts of a balanced infusion
solution (i.e. Balanced crystalloid ­ cumula-
tive, ml; Table 3).
Patients in both groups showed no sig-
nificant difference in the amount of fluid
solutions, transfusions (red packed blood
cells and fresh frozen plasma), oral fluid
intake and urine output until the first post-
operative day (Table 3). During the follow-
up (until the fifth postoperative day), there
was no significant difference in the cumula-
tive amount of red packed blood cell trans-
fusions administered between the two
groups (unbalanced versus balanced: three
versus five patients, respectively).
There was no significant difference in
serum creatinine at 1 h and 6 h after surgery
between the two groups (Table 3), as well as
on the first postoperative day. The NGAL
concentration showed no significant differ-
ence between the two groups at any time-
point (Table 3). No patient needed renal
replacement therapy perioperatively or
during the follow-up period.
No significant differences were found
between the two groups for length of hos-
pital stay, incidence of POCD on post-
operative day 5, in the MMSE score on
postoperative day 5 and regarding the
occurrence of serious adverse events
(SAEs) (Table 2). In both groups, five
SAEs with no accumulation of one entity

Discussion
This present study is the first to examine the
perioperative changes in acid­base status,
fluid requirements and haemodynamics,
comparing the combined infusion of a
balanced crystalloid and balanced colloid
(1 : 1 mixture) with the infusion of an
unbalanced crystalloid alone, using a goal-
directed haemodynamic algorithm that
guided fluid administration through opti-
mization of stroke volume during elective
hip surgery. Apart from using a goal-
directed algorithm, at the time that this
present study was started, these two regi-
mens of intraoperative fluid administration
were common practice in anaesthesiology all
over the world.
The main finding of the present study was
that the administration of 1200 ml (median)
of an unbalanced crystalloid solution with
an unphysiologically high chloride concen-
tration was able to induce acid­base dis-
turbances as demonstrated by a significant
decrease in SBE compared with a balanced
crystalloid mixed 1 : 1 with a balanced col-
loid. Surprisingly, although a colloid was
infused in the balanced group, this had no
effect on the amounts of fluids needed to
maintain haemodynamic stability and nor-
movolaemia in this setting.
The use of balanced fluids within a GDT
protocol prevented the decrease in SBE that
was encountered when unbalanced fluids
were used during elective hip replacement
surgery in the present study. Since pCO2
and
plasma lactate remained within the normal
range, the developing metabolic acidosis was
most likely due to the administration of a
high chloride load through the unbalanced
infusion solution. This notion is also in
accordance with the calculations on the
contribution of chloride, albumin, lactate
and free water to base excess (Figure 3).
These small deviations in acid­base status
were still detectable even after 500 ml of a
balanced crystalloid infusion had postopera-
tively been infused in the recovery room but
resolved within the next few hours.
When preparing for this present study,
the amounts of fluids usually infused during
elective hip surgery were measured and were
found to be approximately 2 l. However,
using this GDT regime, this present study
demonstrated that only 1200 ml were
required during an intraoperative period
lasting a mean of 1:40 h (i.e. approximately
720­750 ml/h).
Analysing the data by the Stewart­Fencl
approach revealed that the decrease of the
SBE in the unbalanced group seemed to be
mainly associated with the change of plasma
chloride whereas the change of serum albu-
min, especially in the balanced group, seems
to have almost no influence on SBE.
The idea behind the concept of combin-
ing an HES with a crystalloid (1 : 1) in one of
the study groups in the present study was to
provide sufficient hydration and to obtain a
better haemodynamic profile.35­37 However,
both groups showed no differences in the
intraoperative course of SV, cardiac output,
FTc, or MAP or plasma lactate concentra-
tion. In a study comparing a balanced
crystalloid with a balanced colloid solution
within a goal-directed haemodynamic algo-
rithm, there was significantly less haemo-
dynamic stability in the crystalloid group
compared with a colloid group.38 This
instability was not seen within the first
hour of surgery; however, it became appar-
ent after 1­1.5 h. In the present study, the
haemoglobin level was significantly reduced
in the balanced group at the end of surgery
compared with the unbalanced group. This
may indicate that the circulating blood
volume was higher in the balanced group,
but since both groups showed no differences
in the amounts of the study fluids adminis-
tered, the use of 6% (w/v) HES 130/0.42 in
the context of short-lasting elective hip
482 Journal of International Medical Research 42(2)
replacement surgery within a GDT regimen
does not seem to offer a benefit in terms of
fluid volume as long as blood loss is small.
At the same time, there was no clinically
relevant bleeding tendency or increased
blood loss and no increase in registered
SAEs when 6% (w/v) HES 130/0.42 was
used in this clinical setting. In addition, no
deterioration in renal function measured by
urine output, serum creatinine and NGAL
was seen when 6% (w/v) HES 130/0.42 was
administered within this goal-directed
haemodynamic algorithm. These current
findings were consistent with a study in
patients undergoing major gynaecological
surgery in which balanced colloids were
administered within the same goal-directed
haemodynamic algorithm.38 It has to be
noted, however, that this present study was
not powered to investigate tolerability or
safety issues of HES.
The equality of the amounts of fluids
infused was unexpected, since the volume of
distribution for crystalloids is the extracel-
lular space, whereas the (physiological)
volume of distribution for colloids is the
plasma volume. The extracellular space is
about five times the plasma volume.
Accordingly, to replace a blood loss of
500­600 ml, crystalloids in a volume of
2500 ml should be necessary39 and not
1200 ml as used in the present study. The
reason for this remarkable difference may be
due to the volume kinetics of crystalloids.40
According to Hahn et al.,41 the initial frac-
tion of a crystalloid that remains in the
intravascular space may reach 50­70% in
normovolaemic patients and the shift to the
interstitium may take several minutes. This
notion is supported by the intraoperative
and postoperative course of haemoglobin
concentrations in the present study.
Intraoperatively, haemoglobin concentra-
tions did not significantly differ between
the two groups in the present study, while in
the recovery room, the haemoglobin con-
centrations in the balanced crystalloid/
colloid group were found to be significantly
lower than in the unbalanced crystalloid
group, which might be explained by the
delayed shift of the crystalloid from the
intravascular to the interstitial compart-
ment, whereas the colloid remained primar-
ily in the intravascular compartment.
Explanations for these findings cannot be
derived from studies on sepsis,42,43 blunt
multiple trauma44 or states of hypervolae-
mia,45 where a leakage into the interstitial
space by destruction of the endothelial sur-
face layer might be assumed as the mechan-
ism responsible. Therefore, the results of this
present study cannot be extrapolated to
major trauma cases where there is greater
volume turnover due to the inflammatory
responses and destruction of the endothelial
surface layer is regularly present.
This present study had two limitations.
First, no significant differences were
observed between the two groups regarding
length of hospital stay, mortality and delir-
ium/POCD. However, to address these out-
come parameters adequately, randomized
controlled trials with larger numbers of
patients are necessary, especially with
regard to delirium and POCD, and possibly
more severe derangements in acid­base
status induced by greater volumes of infused
unbalanced solutions. Secondly, the present
study was performed in patients treated
within a highly standardized clinical path-
way undergoing surgery with rather low
blood loss. Therefore, it is not clear whether
these results would also be valid or even
more pronounced in major and/or longer
lasting operations with a greater volume
turnover. A timely application of colloids
may be advantageous in such a setting with
regard to interstitial oedema and haemo-
dynamic stability, especially if guided by
GDT.38 In contrast, this cannot be extended
to unstable proinflammatory situations (e.g.
sepsis).
Based on the results of the present
study, during short-lasting (1­1.5 h) hip
Krebbel et al. 483
replacement surgery highly standardized
within a clinical pathway, even small
amounts of an unbalanced, chloride-rich
solution caused a significant fall in SBE.
These effects were seen even without major
blood loss or volume turnover and within a
goal-directed haemodynamic algorithm to
avoid hypo- or hypervolaemia. In the
described setting and during short-lasting
operations, this present study has neither
observed clinical benefits nor disadvantages
when infusing 6% (w/v) HES 130/0.42 for
reasons of volume replacement.
