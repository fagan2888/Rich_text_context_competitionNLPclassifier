Prevalence of complementary and alternative
medicine (CAM) use by the general population:
a systematic review and update
P. E. Harris,1 K. L. Cooper,2 C. Relton,2 K. J. Thomas2
Introduction
It has been more than ten years since two systematic
reviews of surveys of complementary and alternative
medicine (CAM) use by the general public were
published (1,2). The reviews concluded, indepen-
dently, that despite the methodological limitations of
the surveys included, CAM was used by substantial
proportions of the general populations of a number
of countries. One source (3) suggested that CAM
use increased significantly in the USA between 1990
and 1997. A further review is timely to examine
more recent trends and their implications for health-
care systems and policy as well as for consumers of
CAM.
The use of all types of medicine is influenced by
economic and socio-cultural factors. In economically
disadvantaged societies where access to biomedical
services is poor, there is evidence of a pervasive reli-
ance on traditional healers, even for serious disease
(4). In affluent countries, where biomedical services
are more accessible, a substantial amount of CAM is
used for illness prevention and health promotion
purposes (3). There is also evidence that CAM is fre-
quently used as an adjunct to biomedical treatment by
patients with serious disease such as cancers (5,6) and
to self-manage long-term health complaints like low
back pain (7). However, the socio-cultural factors
influencing CAM use in affluent societies are still not
well understood. Studies have persistently shown that
CAM users are more likely to be female, better edu-
cated, middle-aged and report poorer health status
than non-users (6,8­12). CAM use appears to be
SUMMARY
Objectives: To update previous systematic reviews of 12-month prevalence of
complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) use by general populations; to
explore trends in CAM use by national populations; to develop and apply a brief
tool for assessing methodological quality of published CAM-use prevalence surveys.
Design: Nine databases were searched for published studies from 1998 onwards.
Studies prior to 1998 were identified from two previous systematic reviews. A six-
item literature-based tool was devised to assess robustness and interpretability of
CAM-use estimates. Results: Fifty-one reports from 49 surveys conducted in 15
countries met the inclusion criteria. We extracted 32 estimates of 12-month preva-
lence of use of any CAM (range 9.8­76%) and 33 estimates of 12-month preva-
lence of visits to CAM practitioners (range 1.8­48.7%). Quality of methodological
reporting was variable; 30 / 51 survey reports (59%) met four or more of six quality
criteria. Estimates of 12-month prevalence of any CAM use (excluding prayer) from
surveys using consistent measurement methods showed remarkable stability in
Australia (49%, 52%, 52%; 1993, 2000, 2004) and USA (36%, 38%; 2002,
2007). Conclusions: There was evidence of substantial CAM use in the 15 coun-
tries surveyed. Where national trends were discernable because of consistent mea-
surement, there was no evidence to suggest a change in 12-month prevalence of
CAM use since the previous systematic reviews were published in 2000. Periodic
surveys are important to monitor population-level CAM use. Use of government-
sponsored health surveys may enhance robustness of population-based prevalence
estimates. Comparisons across countries could be improved by standardising
approaches to data collection.
Review criteria
· Nine databases were searched from 1998
onwards; prior studies were identified from two
previous systematic reviews.
· Studies were included if they reported prevalence
of CAM use over 12-months in a representative
sample of the general population. Studies were
excluded if restricted to a single CAM therapy, or
not written in English.
· A six-item tool to assess quality of published
CAM-use prevalence surveys was devised and
applied.
Message for the clinic
· The review included 51 reports from 49 surveys
in 15 countries: estimates of 12-month
prevalence of any CAM use ranged from 9.8% to
76%; and from 1.8% to 48.7% for visits to CAM
practitioners.
· There was no evidence of a change in CAM use
since previous reviews were published in 2000.
· Periodic surveys with consistent measurement
methods are needed to determine trends in CAM
use by national populations.

SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

driven more by congruence with values and beliefs
than by dissatisfaction with biomedicine (10) but
motivation to use CAM is further complicated by costs
and benefits as experienced by consumers.
Although the true rate of CAM use can be
expected to differ between countries because of eco-
nomic, social and cultural factors, the prevalence
rates estimated by surveys are also affected by meth-
odological factors. Some of these have been identified
(2) with the recommendation that surveys justify the
types of CAM surveyed; use pretested data collection
methods; distinguish between consultations with
CAM practitioners and over-the-counter products;
seek reports of usage for each of the practitioner
therapies and products identified; and specify the
period over which CAM use is estimated (most sur-
veys choose a 12 month retrospective period). Others
have also recommended a more standardised method
of collecting data to improve the comparability of
CAM use estimates (13).
The two previous reviews of CAM prevalence (1,2)
each included 12 surveys for review with seven1
common to both studies because of differences in
search methods and selection criteria. The current
study has drawn on these two earlier reviews to
develop more rigorous criteria for searching and
selection and aims to (i) systematically review all sur-
veys of CAM use by the general public, (ii) identify
trends in CAM use by national populations, (iii)
develop a brief tool for assessing methodological
quality and apply it to each survey.
Methods
Search strategy
The systematic review followed the recommenda-
tions in the PRISMA statement (16). The following
databases were searched in February 2011: MED-
LINE, Medline in Process, EMBASE, Cochrane
Database of Systematic Reviews, Cochrane CEN-
TRAL Register of Controlled Trials, HTA database,
Science Citation Index, AMED and PsycINFO. The
search strategy combined terms for: (i) complemen-
tary and alternative medicines, (ii) prevalence, sur-
veys or patterns of use, and iii) population-level or
national-level data. The full search strategy is pro-
vided in Appendix 1. The search was restricted to
studies published from 1998 onwards. Studies pub-
lished prior to 1998 were identified from two previ-
ous systematic reviews of CAM prevalence (1,2).
Bibliographies of included papers were checked for
further relevant studies.
Inclusion and exclusion criteria
Studies were included if they reported prevalence of
CAM use over a 12-month retrospective period
within a representative general population sample of
a nation or a defined geographical area. Surveys of
clearly-defined age groups (such as adults or chil-
dren) were also included. Included studies used sur-
vey methods such as structured interviews or self-
complete questionnaires. Studies were excluded if
they were restricted to a single therapy (rather than
CAM use overall), did not report 12-month preva-
lence, or were not written in English. Studies were
also excluded if they were not based on representa-
tive samples of the general population; for example,
surveys of sub-populations with specific clinical con-
ditions or socio-demographic characteristics (other
than age).
Study selection and data extraction
Study titles retrieved by the search were assessed for
inclusion by one reviewer and a sample of excluded
titles was checked by a second reviewer: no instances
of discrepancy were found. Potentially relevant
abstracts and full texts were assessed by two review-
ers and any discrepancies resolved through discus-
sion. Data were extracted by one reviewer and
checked by a second.
Quality assessment
There is no agreed set of criteria for assessing quality
of health-related surveys, although various publica-
tions have explored issues relating to the critical
review of questionnaire-based surveys in health
research (17­22), and previous studies of CAM-use
prevalence have commented on these issues
(2,14,23,24).
For the purposes of this review, we derived a
short, literature-based quality assessment tool com-
prising important and assessable criteria of methodo-
logical quality, and applied this to each of the
eligible papers identified. Our rationale for selecting
quality criteria related to the need to assess the
robustness and interpretability of published CAM-
use estimates. Our quality criteria reflect a combina-
tion of aspects of study design, study conduct and
the reporting of results (Box 1).
Rationale for quality criteria
Study design
As with all surveys of prevalence, the estimates pro-
duced are the direct product of the questions asked;
slight changes in the form of questions will have the
potential to affect the resulting estimates. This is par-
ticularly important in surveys of CAM where multi-
1Data for Thomas 1993 [14] and Vickers 1994 [15] are from the
same survey source.

ple, and sometimes culturally specific understandings
exist in relation to the practice and to the constitu-
ent therapies (2,23). CAM prevalence surveys have
employed one of two data collection methods; either
a list of named therapies is presented, or more
exploratory, open question(s) are used to elicit CAM
use. Our first criterion required papers to reproduce
the CAM survey question(s) verbatim or describe the
CAM question in the text (e.g. `we asked about...').
For closed questions, we required a list of the pre-
specified therapies (and exclusions) presented to sur-
vey respondents (described clearly enough for the
individual therapies to be counted reliably). Where
open question(s) were used to collect CAM-use data,
we sought evidence of the content and number of
open questions employed.
As the measurement process for CAM-use is com-
plex and variable, the validity of the survey instru-
ment is strengthened if it has been tested in a pilot
study for ease of completion and comprehensibility
(2,14,18). Evidence of such piloting formed our sec-
ond criterion. Explicit mention of a pilot was sought
for all studies, but routine, government-sponsored
surveys were assumed to have undergone a piloting
phase as this is standard practice and frequently
described in separate, methodological papers or
reports.
Adequate sample size enhances the robustness of
the estimates produced and, if something is known
about expected prevalence prior to the survey, a
sample size calculation can be performed to ensure
adequate numbers for each item of importance to
be measured (18,20­22). Surveys of CAM use that
are part of wider-scope studies of health behaviour
tend to have large samples, but may not perform
sample size calculations in relation to items measur-
ing CAM use. Our third criterion was met if studies
reported a sample of at least 1000, and / or if they
reported a sample size calculation specific to CAM
use.
Data collection
Previous papers have cited `good' response rates for
surveys as between 70­80%, and `acceptable'
response rates for postal surveys between 50% and
60% (18,20­22,24). Our fourth criterion was deemed
to have been met if studies reported a response rate
of at least 60% (we accepted adjusted or unadjusted
response rates and report these in Table 1).
Analysis
Our fifth quality criterion was deemed to have been
met if appropriate correction for non-response bias
was used; for example, weighting the responses to
the known characteristics of the original sample pop-
ulation (18,20­22).
Reporting of estimates
Finally, 95% confidence intervals (CIs) provide an
estimate of the range in which the true prevalence
value is expected to lie (18,20­22,25) and therefore
provide more information whilst reducing the likeli-
hood of `false' precision being attributed to the esti-
mates. Our sixth and final quality criterion was
therefore met when studies reported 95% CIs, or
standard errors (SEs) from which the CI can be cal-
culated, for the main CAM-use prevalence estimates.
Results
Number of surveys included
The search identified 2312 unique citations, as shown
in Figure 1. Of these, 2208 were excluded at the title
and abstract stage, while the full texts of 104 refer-
ences were examined. Forty-seven references were
included in the review; three references (11,26,27)
together contained reports from seven independent
surveys, while four references (24,28­30) relating to
two surveys gave separate reports for adults and chil-
dren. In total, the 47 references reviewed contained
51 reports from 49 independent surveys. From these
reports, we extracted 32 separate estimates of the 12-
month prevalence of the use of any CAM and 33
estimates of the 12-month prevalence of visits to
CAM practitioners.

quality criteria developed for this review.
Based on the information reported, we assessed all
surveys reviewed with regards to our six quality cri-
teria (see Table 2). The proportion of all survey
reports achieving each of our criteria ranged from
43% to 84%. The criteria least likely to be met were
(5) data weighting to reduce non-response bias, and
(6) reporting CI or SE for key prevalence estimates.
Fifty-nine percent of all survey reports met four or
more of our quality criteria. Although
proportionately more reports from government­
sponsored surveys achieved four or more of the qual-
ity criteria compared with other survey reports, and
there was a trend towards more of these reports
meeting each individual criterion, the only marked
difference observed was for the piloting criterion,
where we made the assumption that all government-
sponsored surveys were piloted. We found no evi-
dence of an association between date of publication
and quality.

930 CAM use by general population
ª 2012 Blackwell Publishing Ltd
Int J Clin Pract, October 2012, 66, 10, 924­939
of the general population using at least one type of
CAM (all-CAM use), the percentage visiting any
CAM practitioner (all CAM-visits), and gives an
assessment of each survey using our quality criteria.
Table 4 gives details for each survey of the survey
population, the sampling and data collection
method, the sample itself, and CAM use estimates
with 95% CIs (CIs calculated by the review authors
are identified). In both tables the survey data are
grouped by age: adults or all ages; children; and
older adults. Where possible, the following narrative
identifies trends in CAM use by national populations
from data obtained using consistent methodologies.
USA
Of the surveys (see Table 1) conducted in the USA
from 1990 to 2007, five were government-sponsored
surveys (24,31­34). Data from the National Health
Interview Surveys (NHIS) provided the best available
evidence of recent trends in CAM use by adults
(Tables 3 and 4). Excluding prayer, all-CAM use by
adults (age 18+), over a 12-month period, was esti-
mated to be 36% in 2002 (32) and 38% in 2007
(31). Four US independent national surveys of adults
(age 18+) conducted in the 1990s (3,10,35,36) esti-
mated rates for all-CAM use of 34­42%.Visits by
adults to CAM practitioners in the USA (Tables 3
and 4) increased from 13% in 2002 to 16% in 2007
with substantial variation in the use of specific CAM
therapies and reported significant increases in usage
of some types of therapy including acupuncture and
massage therapy (31,32).
The data from the 2007 NHIS (31) indicates that
all-CAM use in children (age 0­17) is considerably
lower than for adults: 12% vs. 38%. The Medical
Expenditure Panel Survey (MEPS) of 1996 (28) also
shows that adults (age 18+) were much more likely
than children (age <18) to visit CAM practitioners
(8% vs. 2%). The three independent studies (37­
39) of CAM use in later life (age 60+ or 65+) gave
rates for all-CAM use varying from 41 to 63%
(Table 3).
UK
In the UK, 12-month prevalence estimates for all-
CAM use by adults in 1998 (40), 1999 (41) and 2005
(42) were 28%; 20%; and 26% respectively. Fourteen
percent of the adult population (age 18+) of England
were reported to have visited at least one CAM prac-
titioner in 1998 (40). In 2001, the estimate for adults
(age 16+) was 10% for England, Scotland and Wales
(43), and 12% for England in 2005 (42). None of
these surveys used the same measurement tool.
No UK estimates for children or older adults were
identified.
Canada
The National Population Health Survey (NPHS) in
Canada reported rates of adult (age 15+) visits to
CAM practitioners at 15% in 1995 (44) and 17% (for
age 18+) in 1999 (45). Based on data from 2001­5 the
Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) esti-
mated that 12% of the population age 12 or older had
visited some type CAM practitioner over a 12-month
period (46). None of these three surveys estimated the
12-month prevalence of all CAM-use.
Australia
In Australia, the South Australian Health Omnibus
Surveys (SAHOS) collected data on CAM use by
adults (age 15+) living in Southern Australia in 1993,
2000 and 2004 (9,29,47). These methodologically con-
sistent studies report remarkably similar estimates of
overall CAM-use during that period (49%, 52% and
52%). Visits to CAM practitioners were reported as
20% of the population in 1993 (9), 23% in 2000 (47)
and 27% in 2004 (29). As in the US, the SAHOS 2004
survey showed lower rates of overall CAM use in chil-
dren (age < 15) than adults (18% vs. 52%) (29,30).
Other countries
Data from survey reports in the remaining 11 coun-
tries were considered insufficient to indicate national
trends in CAM use; surveys in Norway, Israel,
Demark and Singapore used inconsistent measure-
ment methods, targeted different populations, and / or
the quality of the survey reports was assessed as
poor. Of surveys with national samples, the three
highest rates of CAM use were reported in East Asian
countries: Japan: 76%, South Korea: 75% and Malay-
sia: 56% (48­50).
Discussion
This is the most comprehensive and systematic
review to date of surveys reporting the prevalence of
CAM use by the general public. The two previous
systematic reviews, published in 2000 (1,2), together
included 18 reports from 17 surveys conducted in
nine countries. Nine reports from the two previous
reviews met the criteria for the current review, a fur-
ther 40 surveys were identified yielding 42 further
reports; 38 were published during or post-2000. The
enduring popularity of CAM surveys was also evi-
denced by the number of repeat surveys conducted,
particularly by government agencies, in the USA,
Australia and the UK and the resultant data were
used to explore trends in CAM use for this review.
Reports of CAM surveys from many countries are
absent and this partly reflects the limitation of
excluding studies not written in English.

A total of 47 publications were reviewed contain-
ing 51 reports from 49 surveys conducted in 15 (out
of a possible 196) countries. The surveys indicated
that CAM was frequently used and that prevalence
estimates varied widely between the 15 countries; the
prevalence of all types of CAM use ranged from
9.8% to 76%, the range for visits to CAM practitio-
ners was 1.8­48.7%. There was consistent evidence
that adults were more frequent users of CAM than
children; and that national estimates of CAM use
were highest in East Asian countries such as Japan
(48), South Korea (50), and Malaysia (49).
Prevalence estimates were also influenced by differ-
ences in methodology which make it difficult to com-
pare figures between countries and within countries.
Examples of this include variable age ranges and sam-
pling techniques, but by far the most important source
of variability which influences the comparability of
estimates comes from the way in which CAM is
defined and operationalised for data collection: of the
31 reports (61%) that used lists of named therapies to
elicit CAM use, the number of therapies identified
ranged from 4 to 36. Most surveys also allowed
respondents to report the use of `other' types of CAM,
but CAM prevalence estimates were inflated by the
inclusion of prayer as a type of CAM (32). Use of
prayer was most frequently reported in studies from
the USA and East Asia. Other factors contributing to
high estimates of CAM use were the inclusion of reli-
gious practices other than prayer (51); named thera-
pies not commonly regarded as CAM such as `dietary
supplements' (48); and the use of indigenous, tradi-
tional medicine (52). This reinforces the call for a
more standardised approach to collecting comparable
population data (13).
There was evidence of national trends in Australia,
UK and USA. In Australia during 2004, about one in
two adults and one in five children had used some type
of CAM and about one in four adults had visited
CAM practitioners (29,30) with no significant change
in CAM use from 2000 to 2004. UK surveys also sug-
gested that CAM use has remained fairly constant
since 1998 (40) with about one in four adults using
CAM and one in eight consulting a CAM practitioner
during 2005 (42). In the USA, CAM use has remained
steady since 2002 with the most recent survey (2007)
indicating that nearly four in ten adults and one in
nine children had used some type of CAM (31). How-
ever, in general, information on trends is limited by
insufficient data from repeat surveys with consistent,
high quality methods.
There is currently no consensus regarding `what is
quality' in the context of prevalence surveys. Sander-
son et al. (19) argue for quality criteria focussed on
the reduction of bias, but acknowledge that other

aspects of quality are important. We aimed to produce
quality criteria that relate to the likely robustness and
interpretability of the estimates produced. The devel-
opment of the assessment tool was based on researcher
experience and authoritative sources. Our experience
of applying the six identified criteria suggested they
had face validity, but further work is needed to estab-
lish their reliability and validity. Reliable and valid cri-
teria can be used to select high quality surveys for
future systematic reviews and to help guide the devel-
opment and reporting of prevalence surveys.
Application of the six-item quality assessment tool
developed for this review suggested that the quality
was variable; 30 survey reports (59%) achieved four
or more of the six quality criteria. There was no evi-
dence of an association between date of publication
and quality, but we did observe a trend towards
higher quality in the government-sponsored surveys,
according to our criteria.
The rationales cited for conducting CAM surveys in
the reports reviewed were predominantly concerned
with perceptions of the popularity of CAM, and its
increasing use, and the implications of this for public
health and health service planning. Recent surveys
have revealed that delayed medical care was associated
with CAM use in the USA (53); that most respondents
in Australia were unaware that CAM use was not rou-
tinely tested for safety and efficacy by a government
agency (29); and that more than one in four UK
respondents taking prescribed drugs stated they were
also using CAM (42). All of the recent reports in Aus-
tralia, UK, and USA (29,31,42) emphasised the need
to improve communication between physicians and
patients about their use of CAM; openness and non-
judgemental communication is needed to determine
the risks of drug interactions and other potential com-
plications (29). Periodic surveys of general popula-
tions are required to monitor changing patterns in
CAM use as well as public perceptions and awareness,
and the quality of communication between healthcare
providers and their users.
Finally, most studies reviewed also reported esti-
mates for visits to specific CAM practitioners. This
will be the subject of a separate publication and
complete the picture of the world-wide use of CAM
based on the best available evidence.
