Background---Adverse pregnancy outcomes, such as preterm birth (PTB), have been associated with elevated risk of maternal
cardiovascular disease, but their effect on late midlife blood pressure (BP) and subclinical vascular measures remains understudied.
Methods and Results---We conducted a cross-sectional analysis with 1220 multiethnic parous women enrolled in SWAN (Study of
Women's Health Across the Nation) to evaluate the impact of self-reported history of adverse pregnancy outcomes (PTB, small-for-
gestational-age, stillbirth), on maternal BP, mean arterial pressure, and subclinical vascular measures (carotid intima-media
thickness, plaque, and pulse wave velocity) in late midlife. We also examined whether these associations were modified by race/
ethnicity. Associations were tested in linear and logistic regression models adjusting for sociodemographics, reproductive factors,
cardiovascular risk factors, and medications. Women were on average aged 60 years and 255 women reported a history of an
adverse pregnancy outcome. In fully adjusted models, history of PTB was associated with higher BP (systolic: b=6.40; SE, 1.62
[P<0.0001] and diastolic: b=3.18; SE, 0.98 [P=0.001]) and mean arterial pressure (b=4.55; SE 1.13 [P<0.0001]). PTB was
associated with lower intima-media thickness, but not after excluding women with prevalent hypertension. There were no
significant associations with other subclinical vascular measures.
Conclusions---Findings suggest that history of PTB is associated with higher BP and mean arterial pressure in late midlife. Adverse
pregnancy outcomes were not significantly related to subclinical cardiovascular disease when excluding women with prevalent
hypertension. Future studies across the menopause transition may be important to assess the impact of adverse pregnancy
outcomes on midlife progression of BP. (J Am Heart Assoc. 2018;7:e007138. DOI: 10.1161/JAHA.117.007138.)

Adverse pregnancy outcomes, including preterm birth
(PTB; delivery<37 weeks' gestation), small-for-gesta-
tional-age birth (birthweight <10th percentile for gestational
age), and stillbirth (pregnancy loss at 20 weeks) together
affect %17% to 20% of births in the United States annually.1,2
Accumulating evidence suggests that adverse pregnancy
outcomes may serve as a screening test for future cardio-
vascular disease (CVD),3 the leading cause of morbidity and
mortality in women.4 Prior studies report a 2- to 3-fold
increased risk of CVD in women with a history of PTB,5­7 even
when not complicated by preeclampsia.8 In a record linkage
study, severity and number of small-for-gestational-age
infants were associated with future maternal CVD-related
hospitalization or death (ie, coronary heart disease, cere-
brovascular events, chronic heart failure).9 In studies exam-
ining pregnancy losses and CVD, women with a history of
stillbirth had greater risk of subsequent coronary heart
disease compared with women who had livebirths.10,11 These
data suggest that the underlying factors that contribute to
women's risk for adverse pregnancy outcomes may also
increase risk for CVD.12 Although the association between
pregnancy-associated hypertension and maternal CVD is well-
established,13,14 previous studies have shown that low
sensitivity may limit utility of maternal recall of hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy.15

The majority of research relating adverse pregnancy
outcomes to CVD is derived from small cohorts of relatively
young women (mean age <50 years),16,17 with low rates of
CVD. Also, most are conducted in racially/ethnically homo-
geneous populations.18 Although racial/ethnic disparities
exist in rates of adverse pregnancy outcomes and CVD,19,20
racial differences in the association between adverse preg-
nancy outcomes and future risk of CVD has not been fully
explored.16,21 Furthermore, while the risk of CVD increases
substantially after menopause,22 few studies have examined
whether adverse pregnancy outcomes earlier in life influence
women's CVD risk in midlife.16,23,24
Noninvasive measures of subclinical vascular disease
including ultrasound assessment of carotid intima-media
thickness (IMT) and plaque burden and pulse wave velocity
(PWV) measures of arterial stiffness are surrogate markers of
arteriosclerosis and predictors of future cardiovascular
events.25,26 No studies have examined the impact of adverse
pregnancy outcomes on subclinical CVD in late midlife, when
subclinical disease significantly progresses.27 Elevated blood
pressure (BP) is a critical risk factor for subclinical CVD in
midlife.28 Recent data suggest that adverse pregnancy
outcomes are associated with subsequent elevations in BP,
and that BP may mediate associations between adverse
pregnancy outcomes and future CVD.24,29 Yet, prior studies
did not consider whether these associations persist after
women transition through menopause. Therefore, the purpose
of the present analysis was to assess associations of adverse
pregnancy outcomes (ie, PTB, small-for-gestational-age infant,
stillbirth) with BP, mean arterial pressure, and various indices
of subclinical CVD in a large cohort of multiethnic women in
late midlife. In doing so, we also sought to examine whether
BP may be a potential pathway linking adverse pregnancy
outcomes to subclinical CVD in late midlife. A secondary aim
was to determine whether associations between adverse
pregnancy outcomes and subclinical CVD were modified by
race/ethnicity. A better understanding of the relationship
between adverse pregnancy outcomes and cardiovascular
health may lead to early identification of women at excess risk
for CVD later in life.
Methods
Transparency and Reproducibility
SWAN (Study of Women's Health Across the Nation) provides
access to public use data sets that extend through the tenth
annual follow-up visit. Some, but not all, of the data used for
this manuscript are contained in the SWAN public use data
sets.30 Investigators who require assistance accessing the
public use data set may contact the SWAN Coordinating
Center.
Study Participants
SWAN is an ongoing longitudinal, multiethnic study of the
biological and psychosocial changes that occur during the
menopause transition. Details of the study design and
recruitment have been described elsewhere.31 Briefly,
between 1996 and 1997, a total of 3302 premenopausal or
early perimenopausal women aged 42 to 52 years were
enrolled at 1 of 7 research sites in Detroit, MI; Boston, MA;
Chicago, IL; Oakland, CA; Los Angeles, CA; Newark, NJ; and
Pittsburgh, PA. Baseline eligibility criteria for SWAN included:
(1) an intact uterus and at least 1 ovary; (2) menstrual
bleeding within the prior 3 months; (3) no current pregnancy
or breastfeeding; and (4) no usage of reproductive hormones
within the prior 3 months. Each site enrolled non-Hispanic
white women and women who self-identified as 1 of 4 other
predetermined racial/ethnic groups (black women in Detroit,
Boston, Chicago, and Pittsburgh; Japanese women in Los
Angeles; Chinese women in Oakland; and Hispanic women in
Newark). Participants were assessed through a standardized
protocol at study entry (in 1996­1997) and followed for an
average of 14.3 years through 2011. Six sites (all sites except
Clinical Perspective
What Is New?
· In a multiethnic population-based study of women in late
midlife, history of a preterm birth was significantly associ-
ated with higher blood pressure (BP) and mean arterial
pressure, extending previous findings in premenopausal
women.
· Even when excluding women with a history of hypertensive
disorders of pregnancy, a prior preterm birth was associated
with more adverse BP indices.
· History of adverse pregnancy outcomes (preterm birth,
small for gestational age, stillbirth) were not significantly
related to subclinical cardiovascular disease when excluding
women with prevalent hypertension.
What Are the Clinical Implications?
· Findings suggest that women with a history of preterm
birth exhibited a 6.4-mm Hg higher systolic BP and a 3.2-
mm Hg higher diastolic BP compared with women with all
term births. These data are clinically significant given that
a 2-mm Hg increment in systolic BP has been associated
with a 7% increase in mortality from coronary artery
disease and a 10% increase in mortality from stroke.
· Pregnancy history may help identify women who would
benefit from cardiovascular risk assessment and modifica-
tion. Proper monitoring and management of BP is warranted
for women with a preterm birth.

Los Angeles) assessed subclinical CVD using carotid ultra-
sound and PWV tests at visit 12 or visit 13.
Eligible women for the current analyses were those with at
least 1 birth and who underwent a carotid scan or PWV
assessment. Of 3302 women enrolled in SWAN, 2338
attended visit 13, 2249 of whom completed a pregnancy
history questionnaire. Of these, 1854 provided information on
1 or more births (n=395 nulliparous). After excluding women
without subclinical cardiovascular assessment at visits 12 or
13 (n=609) and those for whom small-for-gestational-age
birth could not be determined because of missing birth weight
history (n=25), a total of 1220 women were included in this
analysis. The institutional review boards at each study site
approved the SWAN protocols. Each participant provided
written informed consent.
Exposure Variables
The primary exposure variables were reported history of PTB,
term small-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth. History of
adverse pregnancy outcomes were assessed using a detailed
interviewer-administered pregnancy history questionnaire at
SWAN visit 13 that collected information on number of births,
birth outcomes (livebirth versus stillbirth), gestational age at
delivery, and birth weight for each delivery. Interviews were
conducted in the clinic/office, over the telephone, or in the
respondent's home. Reported history of PTB was defined as a
prior delivery at <37 completed weeks of gestation. A term
small-for-gestational-age birth (birthweight <10th percentile
for 37 weeks' gestational age) was determined using the
World Health Organization weight percentile calculator,32
which uses a customized standard based on the sample mean
birthweight at 40 weeks' gestation.33 A history of stillbirth
was considered as any pregnancy loss at 20 weeks'
gestation. Studies have shown high sensitivity (>0.90) and
predictive validity for maternal recall of preterm delivery,
small-for-gestational-age birth, and pregnancy loss.34,35
Women were categorized as having no adverse pregnancy
outcomes, a single PTB, a term small-for-gestational-age birth,
a stillbirth, or multiple (>1) adverse pregnancy outcomes.
Women with a preterm small-for-gestational-age birth (n=4),
which was defined as birthweight <10th percentile for
<37 weeks' gestational age, were included in the multiple
adverse pregnancy outcome group.
Outcome Variables
Blood pressure
BP measures in this analysis were collected at the time the
carotid ultrasound was performed. BP was measured accord-
ing to a standardized protocol, with readings taken on the
right arm, with the respondent seated and feet flat on the
floor for at least 5 minutes before measurement.27 The
appropriate cuff size was determined based on arm circum-
ference. A standard mercury sphygmomanometer was used to
record systolic BP (SBP) and diastolic BP (DBP) at the first and
fifth phase Korotkoff sounds. Respondents had not smoked or
consumed any caffeinated beverages within 30 minutes of BP
measurement. The average of 2 sequential BP values, with a
minimum 2-minute rest period between measures, was
recorded. Using the average of these 2 sequential BP values,
we calculated mean arterial pressure with a standard
equation: [(SBP+29DBP)/3].36
Brachial-ankle PWV
Brachial-ankle PWV (baPWV) was measured using the VP1000
system (Omron Healthcare), a noninvasive automated wave-
form analyzer. This device provides measures of baPWV, a
measure of mixed central and peripheral PWV, on both the
right and left sides, and the average of the 2 sides was used
for our study. baPWV is the distance in centimeters between
the brachial and ankle arterial recording sites divided by the
time delay in seconds between the foot of the waveforms
detected at the respective arterial sites. The distance or path
length for brachial/ankle arterial sites was calculated based
on a height-based algorithm.37 The intra- and inter-technician
reliability was excellent with an intraclass correlation coeffi-
cient >0.93 for all sites. baPWV data were collected at visit 12
at the Pittsburgh site. Pittsburgh participants who did not
have the baPWV test at visit 12 were tested at visit 13.
baPWV was performed at visit 13 at other participating sites.
As a result, baPWV data were available for 956 participants in
this analysis.
Carotid ultrasound scan
Bilateral ultrasound carotid images were obtained using a
Terason t3000 Ultrasound System (Teratech Corp) equipped
with a variable frequency 5- to 12-MHz linear array trans-
ducer. On each side, 2 digitized images were obtained of the
distal common carotid artery, 1 cm proximal to the carotid
bulb. From each of these 4 images, using the Artery
Measurement System semiautomated edge detection soft-
ware,38 IMT measures were obtained by electronically tracing
and measuring the distance between the lumen-intima and
the media-adventitia interfaces of the near and far walls of the
common carotid artery. One measurement was generated for
each pixel over the area, for a total of %140 measures for
each image. The mean of the average readings of all 4 images
were used in the analyses. Carotid scan images were read
centrally at the SWAN Ultrasound Reading Center (University
of Pittsburgh Ultrasound Research Lab).
The presence and extent of plaque were evaluated in each
of 5 segments of the left and right carotid artery (distal and

proximal common carotid artery, carotid bulb, and proximal
internal and external carotid arteries).39 Consistent with the
Mannheim and American Society of Echocardiography con-
sensus statements,40,41 plaque was defined as a distinct area
protruding into the vessel lumen that was at least 50% thicker
than the adjacent IMT and summarized as the presence or
absence of any plaque. Additionally, for each of the bilateral
carotid segments, the degree of plaque was graded between 0
(no observable plaque) to 3 (plaque covering 50% of the
vessel diameter). The grades from all segments of the
combined left and right carotid artery were summed to create
the plaque index (possible range: 0­30).42 Sonographers at
each study site were trained by the University of Pittsburgh
Ultrasound Research Laboratory and monitored during the
study period for reliability. Reproducibility for mean common
carotid artery IMT measures was excellent, with an intraclass
correlation coefficient between sonographers of 0.72 to 0.95,
and between readers >0.87. The plaque index was found to be
a valid and reproducible measure of carotid atherosclerosis in
a number of populations (intraclass correlation coefficient,
0.86­0.93).42 The scanning and reading protocols have been
used in numerous studies.43,44
Covariates
Self-reported history of preeclampsia (high BP and protein-
uria), gestational hypertension, and gestational diabetes
mellitus (no diabetes mellitus prepregnancy) were also
assessed at visit 13 using the detailed pregnancy history
questionnaire. Previous studies have shown that maternal
recall of hypertensive disorders of pregnancy has low
sensitivity (yet high specificity, >90%) for all hypertensive
disorders.15,45 Studies have shown greater sensitivity and
predictive validity for maternal recall of PTB, small-for-
gestational age birth, and pregnancy loss.34,35,46 Therefore,
relying on what is known about maternal self-report, the
primary exposures of interest in this analysis are PTB, small-
for-gestational age birth, and stillbirth (pregnancy loss at
20 weeks). Because of the small sample of women with a
reported history gestational diabetes mellitus, we did not
consider it as a separate exposure. To address these
limitations, sensitivity analyses were performed (as described
in the Statistical Analysis) excluding women with a reported
history of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, and gesta-
tional diabetes mellitus.
Demographic and socioeconomic characteristics including
race/ethnicity and education were assessed by self-report at
SWAN baseline. All other covariates were assessed at the
time the carotid ultrasound was performed (corresponding to
visit 12 or 13). Information on maternal age at first and last
birth was assessed at visit 13 using the pregnancy history
questionnaire for all women. Menopause status at the time of
the carotid ultrasound measure was determined based on
reports about frequency and regularity of menstrual bleeding
and use of hormone therapy, as previously described.47
Current hormone use, including menopausal hormone therapy
and oral contraceptives, was based on reported use since last
SWAN visit.
Financial strain (ie, difficulty in paying for basics) was self-
reported and data from the visit corresponding to the carotid
ultrasound was used in this analysis. Smoking (current/past,
never), alcohol use, physical activity, and medication use (ie,
antihypertensive, antidiabetics, lipid-lowering) were drawn
from the visit concurrent with the carotid ultrasound. Physical
activity was assessed using modified Baecke Scores of
Habitual Physical Activity, with higher scores indicating more
physical activity.48 Body mass index was calculated as weight
in kilograms divided by height in meters squared (kg/m2).
Diabetes mellitus was defined as fasting glucose levels
126 mg/dL on 2 consecutive visits or any reported use of
insulin/antidiabetic agents. Hypertension was defined as
having a BP reading of 140/90 mm Hg or use of
antihypertensive treatment.
Blood was drawn in the morning following a 12-hour fast.
Samples were frozen (À80°C) and sent on dry ice to the
Medical Research Laboratories (Lexington). The homeostatic
model assessment index was calculated from fasting insulin
and glucose as (insulin [mU/L]9glucose [mmole/L per
22.5]).49 Triglycerides were analyzed by enzymatic methods
on a Hitachi 747 analyzer (Boehringer Mannheim Diagnostics)
and high-density lipoprotein cholesterol was isolated using
heparin-2M manganese chloride.50 Low-density lipoprotein
cholesterol was calculated using the Friedewald equation.51
Statistical Analysis
Variables were examined for distributions and outliers and
transformation of data was applied as needed. To compare
CVD risk factors across pregnancy outcome groups (no
adverse pregnancy outcome, PTB, term small-for-gestational-
age birth, and more than 1 adverse outcome), ANOVA or
Kruskal­Wallis tests were performed for continuous data and
chi-square or Fisher exact test for categorical variables. Post
hoc analyses using the Dunnett test were conducted with the
no adverse pregnancy outcome group as the reference group.
Associations between each adverse pregnancy outcome
and each subclinical CVD measure were examined using
multiple linear (BP indices, baPWV, IMT) and logistic regres-
sion (carotid plaque presence, plaque index) models. Models
were first adjusted for age, race/ethnicity, site, financial
strain, and age at first birth, with additional adjustments for
covariates associated with adverse pregnancy categories and
subclinical CVD measures at P<0.1. In analyses for baPWV,
IMT, and plaque, models were next adjusted for SBP.

Subsequent models adjusted for other traditional CVD risk
factors (ie, body mass index, physical activity, smoking status,
homeostatic model assessment of insulin resistance, and
high- and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol). Additional
models adjusted for current use of antihypertensive, antidi-
abetic, and lipid-lowering medications. Sensitivity analyses
were also performed: (1) excluding women with prevalent
hypertension (n=654), as defined earlier; (2) excluding women
with a reported history of preeclampsia, gestational hyper-
tension, or gestational diabetes mellitus (n=172); and (3)
excluding women who were premenopausal/perimenopausal
at the time of carotid ultrasound (n=74). Interactions between
adverse pregnancy outcomes and race/ethnicity were exam-
ined by entering the appropriate cross product terms into
multivariable models, and stratified analyses were performed
for significant interactions. Residual analyses and model
diagnostics were evaluated for evidence of collinearity in all
models.
Results
A total of 255 women (21%) reported a history of an adverse
pregnancy outcome: 114 PTB, 59 term small-for-gestational-
age birth, 22 stillbirth, and 60 multiple adverse pregnancy
outcomes (of which 44 had a PTB) (Table 1). At the time of the
carotid scan visit, the women were an average age of
60 years, had some college education or more (51%), and 94%
were postmenopausal. Post hoc analyses revealed that,
compared with women who reported having no adverse
pregnancy outcome, women who reported multiple adverse
pregnancy outcomes were younger at first birth (22 years
versus 26 years; P<0.001). The PTB group was more likely to
report a history of preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or
gestational diabetes mellitus compared with those without a
reported adverse pregnancy outcome (26% versus 12%;
P<0.001). Rates of diabetes mellitus and hypertension at
late midlife differed by adverse outcome group, with the
lowest rates in the no adverse outcome group (Table 2).
MeanÆSD SBP and DBP at late midlife was highest for the
multiple adverse outcome group (SBP: 131Æ19 mm Hg; DBP:
77.3Æ9.8 mm Hg), as was mean arterial pressure
(95.4Æ11.9 mm Hg). Mean baPWV also differed by history
of an adverse pregnancy outcome, with those reporting a prior
PTB or term small-for-gestational-age birth having higher
baPWV than women with no adverse outcome. IMT was higher
for the term for-gestational-age and multiple adverse outcome
groups.
In multiple linear regression analyses, a reported history of
PTB or multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes was significantly
associated with higher BP indices (Table 3). PTB remained
significantly associated with all BP indices after excluding
women with hypertension. Reported history of PTB or term
small-for-gestational-age birth was associated with higher
baPWV in models adjusting for sociodemographics and age at
first birth, but not in models adjusting for SBP (Table 4). We
further adjusted for other CVD risk factors and medications,
which did not significantly impact findings. Sensitivity anal-
yses (excluding women with a reported history of preeclamp-
sia, gestational hypertension, gestational diabetes mellitus,
with exclusion of premenopausal/perimenopausal women)
did not show any significant change in b coefficients (data not
shown), although the association between PTB and baPWV
approached significance when women with prevalent hyper-
tension were excluded (P=0.09). No significant interactions
were present between race/ethnicity and any adverse
pregnancy outcomes for either BP or baPWV.
Table 5 presents results for the associations between
adverse pregnancy outcomes and IMT. Reported history of
PTB was associated with lower IMT in fully adjusted models.
There was a significant interaction between history of PTB and
race/ethnicity (P=0.006) in relation to IMT. Because of the
small sample size of Hispanic and Chinese women, these
analyses were limited to women who identified as black or
white. In the fully adjusted models stratified by race/ethnicity,
PTB was associated with lower IMT in black women but not in
white women. When sensitivity analyses were performed
excluding women with hypertension, PTB was not significantly
associated with IMT and there was no significant interaction
between history of PTB and race/ethnicity. Although term
small-for-gestational-age birth and multiple adverse preg-
nancy outcomes were associated with a higher IMT in
unadjusted analyses, the association was attenuated when
controlling for sociodemographic factors and age at first birth.
Reported history of an adverse pregnancy outcome was not
associated with carotid plaque presence or index, and these
findings were not modified by race/ethnicity.
Discussion
This is the first study in a racially diverse cohort of women in
late midlife (aged 60 years) to assess the impact of PTB, term
small-for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth on various indices
of BP and subclinical CVD. History of a PTB was associated
with higher indices of BP (SBP, DBP, and mean arterial
pressure) but lower IMT in late midlife. For baPWV, the
association was attenuated after adjusting for SBP. There was
a significant interaction between PTB and race/ethnicity in
relation to IMT, with PTB being associated with lower IMT in
black women, but no significant relationship was found
in white women. Moreover, there was no significant associ-
ation between PTB and IMT when excluding women with
hypertension or those taking antihypertensive treatment.

outcome or a combination of PTB, term small-for-gestational-

age birth, stillbirth) was associated with higher BP indices in
fully adjusted models, but not after excluding women with
prevalent hypertension. These associations did not differ by
race/ethnicity.
This study was able to examine whether previous associ-
ations noted between PTB and BP19,27,52 remain significant in
late midlife, when women transition through menopause and
risk of CVD increases.25 Consistent with prior analyses, we
found that history of PTB was positively related to BP even
when excluding women with prevalent hypertension and
preeclampsia, gestational hypertension, or gestational dia-
betes mellitus.52,53 In fully adjusted models, we observed that
women with a prior PTB exhibited 6.4 mm Hg higher SBP and
3.2 mm Hg higher DBP compared with women with all term
births, a stronger association than that seen in previous
studies,19,27,52 perhaps because of the older age of women in
our sample. These data are clinically significant given that a
2-mm Hg increment in SBP has been associated with a 7%

increase in mortality from coronary artery disease and 10%
increase in mortality from stroke.54 Mean arterial pressure,
which has not been reported in prior studies of PTB and
maternal CVD, was significantly higher among women with a
history of PTB, indicating the potential impact of preterm
delivery on overall blood flow and perfusion in late midlife.
One explanation for this finding is that perhaps the women
with PTB have a more vulnerable vasculature going into
menopause (eg, more remodeling) and that the various
cardiovascular challenges of menopause (eg, hormonal
changes and body composition changes) and aging may
thereby impact these women more adversely.55,56 Studies
have shown that modest elevations in BP, even within the
normotensive range, contribute to risk of PTB.57 Thus, there
may be small prepregnancy and during-pregnancy differences
in BP that are linked to PTB and increased BP later in life.
However, the current analysis did not have prepregnancy data
to examine this possibility. Our findings may further suggest
that as women age, BP increases more rapidly among those
with a history of PTB. Similarly, a history of multiple adverse
pregnancy outcomes was associated with higher BP indices.
We found a 7.3-mm Hg higher SBP in women with multiple
adverse pregnancy outcomes, suggesting that there may be a
dose-response relationship between number of adverse
pregnancy outcomes and SBP in late midlife. However, the
association was attenuated after excluding women with
prevalent hypertension, perhaps attributable to a small
sample size (75% of women in this group had hypertension).
The most commonly reported adverse outcome in this group
was PTB. Accordingly, history of PTB may help identify women
at risk for higher BP in midlife and who may benefit from
monitoring BP indices during the menopause transition.
Although we were unable to differentiate between sponta-
neous (caused by premature rupture of membranes, prema-
ture labor, or cervical insufficiency) or medically indicated
PTB, the exclusion of women with hypertensive disorders of
pregnancy, gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm small-
for-gestational age births from this PTB group (the leading
indications for medically inducted PTB), suggest that there is a
common link between PTB and future maternal BP other than
hypertension during pregnancy and this may extend to
spontaneous PTB. Future studies with these clinical features,
however, are needed to answer this important question.
Consistent with a previous study of subclinical CVD among
women 4 to 12 years after pregnancy,52 our study found no
significant association between PTB and baPWV after adjust-
ing for SBP. One possibility is that baPWV, a combined
measure of central and peripheral arterial stiffness,58 may be
a less accurate measure of arterial stiffness than carotid-
femoral PWV.59 Although flow-mediated dilation of the
brachial artery is a consistent noninvasive measure predictive
of long-term cardiovascular events,60 this measure was only
available in a subsample of women in our sample (n=376), of
which %75 reported an adverse pregnancy outcome.

Nonetheless, baPWV has been shown to increase with aging,
hypertension, diabetes mellitus, and smoking.61 A borderline
association was present when women with hypertension were
excluded, indicating that BP may be an important factor in the
association between PTB and arterial stiffness.
Our current finding that PTB is inversely associated with IMT
in a cohort of mostly postmenopausal women, differs from that
of a previous analysis in which women who delivered before
34 weeks' gestation had higher IMT than those with term
births, although this association was attenuated when adjusting
for CVD risk factors.52 It is possible that our findings differ from
this prior study because we did not have the adequate sample
size to compare early (<34 weeks) and late (34­36) PTB.
However, our study found that the association between PTB and
IMT was modified by race/ethnicity. PTB was associated with
lower IMT in black women but was not significantly associated
with IMT in white women. Our stratified analyses found that
black women with PTB were younger, had higher SBP, and
reported greater rates of antihypertensive therapy than black
women with no adverse pregnancy outcome. Hypertension
induces dysfunctional alterations in the endothelium, which
may result in thicker IMT.62 Antihypertensive treatment
reduces progression of IMT,63,64 potentially through functional

or structural changes in the vessel wall.65 Excluding women
with prevalent hypertension and antihypertensive medications
from our analyses attenuated the negative association between
PTB and IMT. Furthermore, there was no longer an interaction
with race/ethnicity in these models. An assessment of IMT
progression in a larger sample of women without hypertension
would better characterize the impact of PTB on carotid
remodeling in midlife.
Although not significant, it is important to note that a
reported history of term small-for-gestational-age birth and
multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes was positively associ-
ated with IMT. Recent studies have also found a significant
association between small-for-gestational-age birth and
BP,24,27 although our data did not support this finding.
However, our analysis had a smaller sample size, which may
have impaired our ability to robustly detect differences
between groups. It is also possible that sociodemographic
characteristics not fully explained in our data underlie the
association between small-for-gestational-age birth and BP.
Women with a history of term small-for-gestational-age birth
and multiple adverse pregnancy outcomes had higher body
mass index and insulin resistance, suggesting that these
pregnancy outcomes may lead to greater IMT through an
association with metabolic factors.
In this analysis, we did not find an association between
history of adverse pregnancy outcomes and carotid plaque, a
finding consistent with related work among other samples of
women.66 With less than half of our sample having any carotid
plaque, sample size to examine this association was some-
what limited. Future work with samples of older women,
women who are more likely to show plaque,67 can further
investigate the association between adverse pregnancy
outcome and carotid plaque.
Study Limitations
There are several limitations to consider in this analysis. First,
although the accuracy of maternal recall of preterm, small-
for-gestational-age birth, and stillbirth is high (>0.90),16­18 self-
reported history may still be a limitation. In addition, self-report
of preeclampsia and gestational hypertension may have been a
limitation given the low sensitivity15,46 of maternal recall of
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy. Furthermore, our sample
size of women with a term small-for-gestational-age birth or
stillbirth was smaller than in previous analyses9­11,27,68,69 and
may have limited our ability to detect an association between
term small-for gestation age birth and stillbirth with subclinical
CVD. It is also possible that these adverse pregnancy outcomes
may be related to CVD through another physiologic pathway (ie,
socioeconomic drivers, body mass index, glucose dysregula-
tion). In addition, data on prepregnancy CVD risk were not
available, limiting our ability to determine whether differences
in BP, lipid profile, or vascular measures were present before
adverse pregnancy outcomes. Furthermore, although we
excluded women with hypertensive disorders of pregnancy,
gestational diabetes mellitus, and preterm small-for gestational
age from our models, we were unable to differentiate between
spontaneous PTB and medically indicated PTB, which may have
varying effects on maternal CVD risk. Future studies with
clinical features of PTB are necessary to understand the impact
of spontaneous versus medically indicated PTB on CVD in later
life. Comparison between PTB subtypes is also necessary. For
example, is there an association between early PTB (delivery
<34 weeks) or very small-for-gestational-age birth (birthweight
<5th percentile for gestational age) and subclinical CVD in
midlife? Previous reports support the potential for such
associations.27,51,68 Last, we are unable to make definite
conclusions regarding the magnitude of excess CVD risk in
women in late midlife based on these measures of subclinical
CVD alone. While the indices of subclinical CVD used in this
study are good predictors of CVD,70­72 additional research is
necessary to assess the impact of adverse pregnancy outcomes
on endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation. Future
studies with larger sample sizes may have the power to not
only explore adverse pregnancy outcomes further but to
examine severity of adverse pregnancy outcomes in relation
to BP and subclinical CVD.
Study Strengths
Strengths of this analysis include the relatively large sample of
racially diverse women as well as the direct assessment of
physical and vascular measures at late midlife. Our study
provides information on the association between adverse
pregnancy outcomes, BP, and subclinical CVD at late midlife,
when absolute CVD risk increases.25 This study was able to
examine whether the negative impact of adverse pregnancy
outcomes on various indices of BP and subclinical CVD persist
with aging. Furthermore, we examined the impact of having
multiple prior adverse pregnancy outcomes, which has not been
studied extensively and may pose a risk for later-life CVD.
Although the American Heart Association now recognizes
hypertensive disorders of pregnancy and gestational diabetes
mellitus as a risk factor for future CVD and stroke,73 our
findings suggest that history of PTB may be added to this
group of pregnancy risk factors. With stillbirths and small-for-
gestational-age births accounting for 1% and 10% of births in
the United States, respectively,2 additional studies about the
association between these adverse pregnancy outcomes and
CVD is necessary for early risk stratification and prevention.
Although one of the strengths of this analysis was its focus on
late midlife, when the overwhelming majority of women are
postmenopausal, perhaps group differences may be detected

CVD is greatest.31 Therefore, future research across the
menopause transition may be important to determine the
impact of adverse pregnancy outcomes on progression of BP
and subclinical CVD.
Conclusions
Our study shows that reported history of PTB is associated
with higher BP indices in late midlife independent of prevalent
hypertension and history of hypertensive disorders of preg-
nancy. A history of PTB was associated with lower IMT in
black women and not white women, potentially because of the
greater rate of hypertension in this group, as suggested by the
attenuation of this association when excluding women with
prevalent hypertension. With black women having excess
rates of PTB, hypertension, and CVD,74­77 there is a critical
need to better understand racial/ethnic differences in the
association between pregnancy-related factors and progres-
sion of CVD. These findings suggest that history of PTB may
help identify women with heightened BP in late midlife, a
major contributor to CVD morbidity and mortality. In addition,
this analysis demonstrates the importance of monitoring BP
indices among women with a history of PTB.
