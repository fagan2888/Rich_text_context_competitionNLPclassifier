Abstract
Introduction
The Smart Snacks in Schools interim final rule was promulgated
by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) as authorized by
the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 (PL 111­296) and im-
plementation commenced beginning July 1, 2014; however, in the
years leading up to this deadline, national studies suggested that
most schools were far from meeting the USDA standards. Evid-
ence to guide successful implementation of the standards is
needed. This study examined snack policy implementation in ex-
emplary high schools to learn best practices for implementation.
Methods
Guided by a multiple case study approach, school professionals (n
= 37) from 9 high schools across 8 states were recruited to be in-
terviewed about perceptions of school snack implementation;
schools were selected using criterion sampling on the basis of the
HealthierUS Schools Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms (HUSSC:
SL) database. Interview transcripts and internal documents were
organized and coded in ATLAS.Ti v7; 2 researchers coded and
analyzed data using a constant comparative analysis method to
identify best practice themes.
Results
Best practices for snack policy implementation included incorpor-
ating the HUSSC: SL award's comprehensive wellness approach;
leveraging state laws or district policies to reinforce snack reform
initiatives; creating strong internal and external partnerships; and
crafting positive and strategic communications.
Conclusion
Implementation of snack policies requires evidence of successful
experiences from those on the front lines. As federal, state, and
local technical assistance entities work to ensure implementation
of the Smart Snacks standards, these best practices provide
strategies to facilitate the process.
Introduction
With the passage of the Healthy, Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010
(P.L. 111­296), Congress authorized the US Department of Agri-
culture (USDA) to establish nutrition standards for nonmeal-pro-
gram items sold in schools during the school day (also known as
"competitive foods and beverages") (1). In June 2013, the USDA
issued an interim final rule, "Smart Snacks in Schools," which was
to be implemented as of July 1, 2014 (2). However, during the
school year leading up to the deadline, unhealthy snack items re-
mained ubiquitous, especially in high schools. In the 2013­2014
school year, 87% of high school students nationwide still had ac-
cess to sugar-sweetened beverages through snack venues (3), thus
causing concern that full implementation of the standards may be
delayed.
A systematic review reported a small but positive link between
healthful snack policies and outcomes such as decreased student
consumption of unhealthful snacks and decreased availability of
unhealthful snacks (4). Few studies examine how the regulated
standards are translated from policy to school practices (5,6). Such
evidence could be used by schools struggling with translating

Smart Snacks standards into practice. The objective of this study
was to learn best practices from high schools that successfully im-
plemented stringent snack guidelines so those practices could be
used by other schools before they began implementing the Smart
Snacks standards.
Methods
A multiple case-study approach allowed us to examine high
schools in their natural setting (7). This approach aligned well
with the purpose of this study because federal and state mandates
do not allow for randomization of high schools. The main re-
search question was: among high schools with strong snack prac-
tices, what are the critical factors that allowed the practices to be
implemented successfully? By identifying these factors, we were
able to determine best practices for snack policy implementation.
High schools were selected as cases because they typically have
the worst snack environments of all school levels (3). To select
from schools already recognized for rigorous snack practices, we
used the HealthierUS School Challenge: Smarter Lunchrooms
database (HUSSC: SL) as a sampling frame. In February 2014,
203 high schools achieved some level of HUSSC: SL award
status. From this sampling frame, we used criterion sampling prin-
ciples (8) to select 9 high schools with a range of state, district,
and school characteristics from the Bridging the Gap state law
database (school year 2012­2013) (9), state child obesity rates
from the National Survey of Children's Health 2011­2012 (10),
and district and school-level socioeconomic data from the Nation-
al Center for Education Statistics (NCES) Common Core Data
(CCD) (school year 2011­2012) (11).
The University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) Institutional Review
Board approved this study (institutional review board protocol no.
2013­1007). The lead author first obtained permission from
school district superintendents before contacting school profes-
sionals via email to invite them for key informant, semistructured
interviews from November 2013 to October 2014. School profes-
sionals were contacted if they were involved with snack policy im-
plementation as identified by the food service director (FSD),
school principal, or superintendent. The interview guide was based
on research findings already published, pilot-tested with an FSD,
and iteratively revised on the basis of feedback from external
school professionals and USDA officials. On the basis of the FSD
guide, we modified guides intended to be used with other school
professionals. The interview guide contained questions about im-
plementing the snack policy, the key stakeholders in having the
policy implemented or not implemented, the facilitators and barri-
ers to implementing the policy, and sources of technical assist-
ance. The guides are available by request to the first author. Tele-
phone interviews lasted from 45 to 70 minutes and were audio-
taped and transcribed. Post-interview notes and a detailed, ongo-
ing study audit trail were updated and consulted during analysis.
To triangulate interview findings, we collected internal docu-
ments such as each school district's wellness and snack policies,
newsletters, and Facebook pages.
Over 140 documents comprising interview transcripts, internal
documents, and post interview summaries were uploaded into At-
las.ti v.7 (Scientific Software Development GmbH) for organiza-
tion and coding. External school professionals, USDA officials,
and expert researchers informed iterative revisions of an a priori
coding guide. The coding process was guided by Saldaña's first-
and second-pass coding, with the goal of turning the large data set
into organized, categorized, and small, manageable constructs for
analysis (12). Two analysts read through and independently coded
20% of the transcripts; rounds of coding continued until 80%
inter-rater agreement was reached (13). The analysts met regu-
larly to discuss revisions to the coding guide, emergent themes,
and explanations of memos. These ongoing discussions facilitated
the iterative process of theme generation and refinement. Each
analyst then created detailed case summaries that outlined the
timelines and implementation process for each high school; this
process allowed for an in-depth understanding of the contexts and
nuances of the phenomenon in each unique case. Cross-case ana-
lysis (7) guided a process that looked for emergent themes and
commonalities across the cases. One important component of this
process included negative case analysis, which compared snack
policy implementation across cases in order to spot outliers and
deepen theme generation. The coding and analysis process is de-
scribed in full elsewhere, including the steps taken to ensure rigor-
ous team analysis (14). Lastly, adhering to principles of trustwor-
thiness, we enhanced the rigor of study findings by including con-
tinuous peer debriefing and a detailed audit trail (15).
Results
The characteristics of the 9 high schools in the study are in Table
1. As the table indicates, the schools were in 9 districts and 8
states and spanned all 4 Census regions. Based on the Bridging
the Gap state law database 2012­2013 (9), some schools were in
states with strong laws and some in states with weak state laws.
State snack laws -- specifically those applicable to snack food
sales in vending machines, à la carte cafeteria lines, school stores,
classroom parties, and fundraising -- were coded using a rigorous
coding scheme adapted from Schwartz et al (16). For each loca-
tion of sale, state laws were coded for a series of nutrient and
beverage standards. Provisions in state law that were "encour-
aged" we classified as weak. Also weak were laws that used terms
such as "should" or "may," or that allowed exceptions, or that ap-

plied only at certain times of the day or at certain sale locations. In
contrast, strong laws definitively required specific food and bever-
age standards and used terms such as "shall," "must," and "re-
quire." Fourteen individual variables were coded for strength for
each sale location. A composite scale measured the proportion of
the 14 individual items coded for each sale location that were
definitively "strong." The resulting strength scale ranged from 0 to
100, with 100 being the highest score for provisions that were re-
quired by law (9). It is notable that the highest score was 47 of 100
(Mississippi) with all others scoring below 34 of 100. In addition,
some schools were located in large districts and some in small
(range: 3­642 schools and 57­2,531 students per high school).
The schools also varied by locale (city, town, suburban, rural), by
racial/ethnic makeup of the student population, by socioeconomic
status (range: 17% free- or reduced-price lunch participation
[FRLP] to 89% FRPL), and by state rate for childhood obesity
(range: 28% in Iowa to 40% in Mississippi).
Given the focus on FSDs and principals in school wellness literat-
ure, we made a concerted effort to include a wide range of school
professionals in this study (Table 2). Respondents (n = 39) were
11 district FSDs, 8 athletic directors/PE teachers/boosters, 7 prin-
cipals/vice principals, 5 cafeteria managers, and the remaining 8
respondents were a nurse, consumer science/health teacher, tech-
nical assistance provider, or a finance administrator. We inter-
viewed a minimum of 3 school professionals per case, with 4 or
more school professionals interviewed in 7 of the 9 cases.
The findings are derived from cross-case analysis across high
schools and respondent types. Because FSDs had the most pivotal
role in implementation, the findings are reported from the FSDs'
perspective, with supporting quotes from additional respondents.
FSDs used a variety of models for implementing a successful
snack policy, which is evident from several overarching themes
described in the Box.

Theme 1: Implementation and acceptance take
time and continued effort
All FSDs shared that implementation required a series of activit-
ies that took time and continued effort to keep "plugging away at
it." Many FSDs began reforming the school food and snack envir-
onment several years before the Smart Snacks deadline, and des-
pite attaining HUSSC: SL status, most were still planning initiat-
ives toward boosting student acceptance of various components. A
booster club leader from Mississippi shared:
We've never been asked to deviate from our menu because of it
being in concessions . . . . If we had to adhere to those standards, I
don't think we'd be as successful as we are now. I think over time
we would because it would be an initial culture shock if we had to
remove all carbonated drinks. I think we will initially have a change,
but overall, and I guess a few years down the road, I think it would
become just common and end up being OK.
Theme 2: HUSSC: SL certification was a critical
catalyst
The HUSSC: SL award was reported to be a catalyst for snack
policy implementation in 2 main ways. First, attaining any award
status required that the school demonstrate to the USDA that they
are implementing both the snack and district wellness policy com-
prehensively; these combined efforts facilitated an enhanced
awareness of health and wellness. In particular, school profession-
als described nutrition education programs as a strong facilitator of
snack reforms. An FSD from Mississippi shared that nutrition edu-
cation created "another partner in the classroom." Second, many
high schools faced challenges during school meal reform [ie, im-
plementation of the USDA standards: Nutrition Standards in the
National School Lunch and Breakfast Programs (17)], which was
due for implementation 2 years before Smart Snacks. The
HUSSC: SL award brought positive recognition and boosted the
reputation of any food service department that attained it. An FSD
from Iowa said "It helped to get the HealthierUS School Chal-
lenge, it helped to get patted on the back, to make these kids real-
ize, the teachers, and the parents, realize that the kids weren't get-
ting tortured" [laughs]. Such recognition from the school com-
munity at large facilitated the FSDs' ongoing initiatives to im-
prove the school food environment.
Theme 3: FSDs leaned on the power of state law
and district policies
Although a change in policy alone may be insufficient to change
school practice (18), the existence of a policy can act as a strong
facilitator for implementation. FSDs across cases had varying
levels of power and influence in their school districts; however, all
leaned on a district policy, state law, or both to "reinforce" their

initiatives. As a Texas FSD said, "Schools make decisions based
on policy. The curriculum is based on policy. Even salaries are
based on school board policies. So as long as there's a policy that
is within hands' reach, so you can actually print it out and put it on
paper, it helps to reinforce what we're doing."
In addition, school professionals from states with strong laws
overwhelmingly referenced the law as a catalyst for implementa-
tion. The power of state law was evident in discussions with prin-
cipals, who despite having minimal interest in snack reform and
wellness activities, referenced it as a reason for compliance. Ac-
cording to a principal from Mississippi, "And it's that you just
have to be in compliance with the state nutrition guidelines. That's
when you're serving food in the cafeteria as well as in the vend-
ing machines, here on campus. Either one, the state has adopted
such policies. I mean, we were pretty much forced to. It's state
law." Essentially, the power of the district policy or state law was
evident in comments from all school professionals.
Theme 4: Internal and external partnerships and
collaborations increased capacity
It is important to acknowledge that these initiatives were added to
FSDs' existing duties and responsibilities. As a result, FSDs em-
phasized that internal and external partnerships and collaborations
increased their own capacity for implementation. One FSD from
California recalled his reliance on partnerships and collaborations:
I really reached out to the larger nutrition community as a whole.
For example, I'm just gonna name a few of our collaborators: an in-
surance group, not-for-profit community health, let's see -- Alliance
for Healthier Generation, the farmers market, the State Depart-
ment of Education. I incorporated a lot of these collaborations and
partnerships to utilize their resources. Because I myself alone,
there's no way that I could've made these changes.
The most salient internal partnership cited by all respondents was
with school leadership; as the "go-to person" and "hub of commu-
nications," the principal was a critical stakeholder. Further, the
most notable external partnerships across cases were with state de-
partments of education and respective child nutrition divisions,
which provided invaluable hands-on technical assistance and re-
sources, as well as peer networks with partner school districts. An
FSD from Illinois explained, "I have kind of a monthly call with
them [peer FSDs] and we share some of our challenges and best
practices. We visit each other's schools and districts to see what
you're doing, what I'm doing, how can I incorporate some of what
you're doing, how can you incorporate what I'm doing."
FSDs creatively relied on a range of partnerships and collabora-
tions for technical assistance and additional resources; this best
practice was especially critical given that these individuals led
snack (and wellness) policy implementation in addition to their ex-
isting job responsibilities.
Theme 5: Strategic communications changed
perceptions
School professionals expressed that removing unhealthful junk
foods (ie, low nutrient and high sugar, fat, calorie, and sodium
food and beverage items) was "the right thing to do." A critical
practice during implementation was extending their perceptions to
others within and outside the school community about the value
and intentions of the snack policy. One FSD in Iowa said, "It's ter-
rible, they didn't want the government telling them what to do.
And I can understand that, I don't really like the government
telling me what to do, but in my view, it wasn't that, it's showing
these kids healthy guidelines."
In this way, the FSDs' communications with key stakeholders
about the potential impact of the snack policy fostered support for
their initiatives. As an FSD in Virginia recalled from school meal
standards implementation, many stakeholders were misinformed
about reform efforts. Thus, learning from that experience, she took
an active approach when dealing with snack policy implementa-
tion by focusing heavily on messaging and communications that
framed school snacks reform in a positive light: "share, share, and
share your successes!"
Discussion
This study contributes to the limited best practices evidence for
Smart Snacks implementation in US high schools. Overall, school
professionals reported that implementation is taking time and is an
ongoing effort, which is an encouraging finding for struggling
schools still in the process of fully adhering to Smart Snacks.
HUSSC: SL certification was reported to be a strong catalyst be-
cause of its emphasis on a comprehensive wellness approach; this
finding is consistent with a study by Bassler and colleagues (19),
who also examined snack reform in middle and high school dis-
tricts. In the current study, FSDs noted that HUSSC: SL acted as a
facilitator, bringing positive recognition for the child nutrition de-
partment. FSDs operate in complex contexts in the school com-
munity, and initiatives that boost the reputation and awareness of
FSDs can act as facilitators for their initiatives. Because working
toward receiving the HUSSC: SL was reported as a best practice,
organizations providing technical assistance to schools should en-
courage schools to strive for this award.

Implementers also leaned on state law and district policy as
sources of power to legitimize and reinforce their initiatives. This
finding is a more nuanced explanation of what is known from cur-
rent research findings: showing a link between a stringent state
law and more healthful school practices and student-level out-
comes (20­25). Given that school districts tend to follow state
standards, these findings indicate that leadership from the state
level has strong potential for helping FSDs implement their health-
ful initiatives. Local and state technical assistance providers
should consider training FSDs to maximize their ability to lever-
age local policies and state laws for the benefit of programs that
reduce unhealthful snacks in schools. This finding also provides a
rationale for advocacy at all levels in support of state laws that im-
prove snack policies for schools.
FSDs also pointed to the challenge of leading snack policy imple-
mentation in addition to their regular duties; their efforts to build
strong partnerships and collaborations were essential to boost their
capacity and increase access to needed resources. This finding
may be especially salient to FSDs in school districts with limited
resources for wellness and nutrition activities. External organiza-
tions, such as local public health departments and nonprofit tech-
nical assistance providers may be open to partnerships and collab-
orations with schools for wellness-related efforts.
Lastly, strategic and positive communication also emerged as a
best practice, highlighting the essential role that FSDs play in
shaping and framing food-related policy implementation for the
school community. Recently, the USDA issued a final rule ad-
dressing professional standards for school nutrition programs; un-
der this rule, one of the 4 training categories listed includes com-
munications and marketing (26). Technical assistance providers
should consider emphasizing this category for professional devel-
opment with FSDs as well as with other school professionals who
are involved with Smart Snacks implementation.
The best practices that emerged here were drawn from exemplary
high schools across the United States; they may not reflect the ex-
periences of more typical high schools nationwide. Because the
objective of this study was to provide best practices to inform im-
plementation for other high schools, the sampling strategy fo-
cused on the exemplary case; however, future studies should fo-
cus on a typical case for a more comprehensive understanding of
implementation in schools. In addition, the study is missing input
from a few key stakeholder groups, including students, parents,
and state technical assistance providers. Future studies should fo-
cus on perspectives provided by these additional groups. Further-
more, this article does not present findings on monitoring and en-
forcement activities that occurred during and after implementation
processes, which are critical to the success of full implementation.
Despite these limitations, this study is one of the few that ex-
amined US snack policy implementation in high schools from a
process rather than outcomes perspective. The study design and
execution were guided by external school practitioners and USDA
officials to ensure that findings were relevant to both practice and
policy. Finally, to engage a wide range of voices (eg, FSDs, PE
teachers, cafeteria managers) this study expanded the range of
school professionals typically involved in published studies; this
process purposefully included the stakeholders that must be in-
volved for successful implementation of Smart Snacks in schools.
As schools nationwide work toward full implementation of Smart
Snacks, this study provides evidence that schools still working to-
ward full adherence should adopt our list of best practices.

b State law strength score calculation per Bridging the Gap school year 2012­2013 data (high school data) (9). State law strength is calculated by a rigorous cod-
ing process originally published by Schwartz et al (16) and adapted by researchers at Bridging the Gap (2010). The score measures the proportion of snack food
items -- specifically those in vending machines, à la carte, and in school stores -- that were required by law. A requirement is considered and coded to include
policy language that used words such as "shall," "must," "required," as compared with weaker language such as "encourage," "should," "may." Scores range from
0­100 with 100 being the highest score.
c National Survey of Children's Health (2011­2012) (10).
d National Center for Education Statistics (NCES), 2011­2012 (11).
