Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) surveillance relies on
autopsy and neuropathologic evaluation. The 1990­2000
CJD autopsy rate in California was 21%. Most neurologists
were comfortable diagnosing CJD (83%), but few patholo-
gists felt comfortable diagnosing CJD (35%) or performing
autopsy (29%). Addressing obstacles to autopsy is neces-
sary to improve CJD surveillance.
Transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (TSEs) are
rare, progressively fatal, neurodegenerative illnesses.
Human TSEs include classic Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease
(CJD) and the recently described variant CJD associated
with eating bovine spongiform encephalopathy­infected
cattle products in Europe (1). The recent identification of
bovine spongiform encephalopathy in the United States
underscores the importance of maintaining enhanced sur-
veillance to monitor for the possible occurrence of variant
CJD in this country (2,3).
In California, CJD is not reportable. Since 1999, the
California CJD Surveillance Project of the California
Emerging Infections Program, a collaboration of the
California Department of Health Services and the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, has conduct-
ed enhanced surveillance for classic and variant CJD.
Methods include review of state mortality data and follow-
up investigation of CJD-related deaths that occur in per-
sons <55 years of age, since >98% of cases of variant CJD
in the United Kingdom have occurred in this age group. As
part of this enhanced surveillance, medical records for 33
deceased California residents <55 years old from 1996
through 2003 have been investigated with criteria for CJD
developed by the World Health Organization and Centers
for Disease Control and Prevention; none met the criteria
for variant CJD.
Currently, pathologic review of brain tissue obtained by
biopsy or autopsy is the only means of confirming a diag-
nosis of CJD. Autopsy remains the preferred method for
obtaining tissue, as brain biopsy can result in serious com-
plications (e.g., brain hemorrhage or abscess formation)
and may not yield adequate amounts of tissue for analysis.
The main role of brain biopsy is to exclude other, poten-
tially treatable conditions (4).
In this article, we describe results from analysis of
California mortality data from 1990 through 2000. We also
summarize responses generated from a statewide survey of
neurologists and pathologists regarding the challenges to
diagnosing CJD and variant CJD, including obtaining
autopsy in suspected cases.
The Study
Data from the 1990­2000 Death Public Use File
(underlying cause of death only) and 1990­1999 Multiple
Cause-of-Death Data (underlying or contributing causes of
death) were obtained from the Center for Health Statistics,
California Department of Health Services (5). Deaths
among California residents with an International
Classification of Diseases, 9th Revision, code 046.1 or
10th Revision, code A81.0 listed anywhere on the death
record were included in our analysis. Both data files
included report of autopsy as a variable, with the exception
of the Multiple Cause-of-Death Data for 1997 to 1999,
when autopsy performance was not recorded. Statistical
analysis was performed by using SAS software (SAS
Institute, Cary, NC).
From July to December 2002, questionnaires regarding
experience with diagnosing CJD were sent to 1,241
California neurologists identified as members of the
American Academy of Neurology and 574 pathologists
identified as members of the California Society of
Pathologists and the American Association of
Neuropathologists. Approval was obtained from the
Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects of the
State of California.
Review of mortality data identified 263 CJD-related
deaths in California from 1990 through 2000. Of these,
244 were identified from the 1990­1999 Multiple Cause-
of-Death Data, and an additional 19 deaths were identified
from the 1990­2000 Death Public Use File. A total of 42
(16%) cases identified by the Multiple Cause-of-Death
Data were not detected in the Death Public Use File.
Overall, 26 (10%) of the 263 CJD-related deaths were in
persons <55 years of age. Only two deaths occurred in per-
sons <30 years of age. The overall autopsy rate, which for
1997 to 2000 only includes autopsies performed on per-
sons for whom CJD was recorded as the underlying cause
of death, was 53 (21%) of 251 persons: 11 (44%) of 25
persons <55 years of age, and 42 (19%) of 226 persons

>55 years of age. For two deaths, autopsy performance
was not recorded.
Of 1,241 questionnaires mailed to neurologists, 428
(34%) were completed, including 310 (25%) from respon-
dents involved in patient care. Responses regarding the
neurologists' experience with diagnosing CJD and per-
forming autopsy are summarized in Tables 1 and 2. Most
neurologists (83%, 255/307) felt comfortable clinically
recognizing classic CJD. More than one third (36%,
74/207) had not considered arranging for autopsy in their
CJD patients, although most reported access to histopatho-
logic services (75%, 223/297). The most commonly cited
barrier to obtaining autopsy was family reluctance to give
consent (79%, 192/242).
Of 574 questionnaires mailed to pathologists, 284
(49%) were completed. Tables 1 and 2 summarize the
responses. Thirty-five percent (96/273) and 15% (40/274)
of pathologists were comfortable recognizing the neu-
ropathologic features of classic CJD and variant CJD,
respectively. Infection control concerns (77%, 143/185),
lack of experience (62%, 69/111), and institutional limita-
tions (53%, 111/210) were cited as major obstacles to
autopsy performance, and less than half of respondents
reported that confirming the diagnosis of CJD (47%,
92/197) or ruling out variant CJD (45%, 87/193) was an
important reason to pursue autopsy.
Conclusions
Our analysis suggests that autopsy rates for CJD in
California are low. The results of our surveys, which
attempted to discern the reasons for this low rate, imply
that both neurologists and pathologists have similar per-
ceptions of the value of obtaining histopathologic evalua-
tion for CJD but for different reasons. Most neurologists
appeared to be comfortable clinically diagnosing CJD,
with more than one third reporting they had never consid-
ered pursuing autopsy for CJD cases. In contrast, patholo-
gists appeared to be less comfortable making a
histopathologic diagnosis, indicating that autopsy perform-
ance was limited by infection control concerns, lack of
experience with CJD cases, and institutional restrictions.
Our results have some limitations. Approximately 10%
of CJD cases may have atypical signs and symptoms that
can obscure the diagnosis. To the extent that these cases
are misdiagnosed and not autopsied, they could contribute
to overestimation of the autopsy rate. On the other hand,
death certificate analysis can be an insensitive indicator of
the true rate of autopsy, and autopsy performance informa-
tion was unavailable for 1997 to 2000 from the Multiple
Cause-of-Death Data. Both factors could lead to possible
underestimation of the true autopsy rate. Given that some
CJD cases will have had confirmatory brain biopsy or
strongly suggestive clinical features and diagnostic stud-
ies, the autopsy rates cited may apply mostly to patients for
whom a satisfactory antemortem diagnosis could not be
made. Interpreting survey results is limited by the low
response rate; neurologists and pathologists who are expe-
rienced in diagnosing CJD may be more likely to respond,
which would introduce bias.
The public health benefits of performing autopsy on
patients with suspected CJD should not be underestimated.
Autopsy and histopathologic analysis remain important
ways to confirm a diagnosis of CJD and help define the
usual occurrence of subtypes of classic CJD, thereby facil-

itating the recognition of emerging TSEs (1,6,7). Autopsy
rates for nonforensic deaths have declined dramatically
during the past 40 years, with national hospital rates cur-
rently <5%, possibly resulting in missed diagnoses of the
actual cause of death in 8% to 25% of cases (8­11). The
reasons for the decline are multifaceted and include esca-
lating cost of autopsy borne by hospitals and county med-
ical examiners, lack of direct reimbursement, fear of
litigation, and increasing reliance on modern technology to
determine a diagnosis antemortem (10).
Our survey results suggest that infection control con-
cerns play a role in low autopsy rates for CJD, whether
because of fears about the risk of acquiring CJD from han-
dling contaminated tissue or because of liability consider-
ations at the institutional level. More realistically, brain
autopsy can be performed safely as long as CJD-specific
infection control guidelines are strictly followed (12­13).
Nonetheless, concerns about potentially acquiring CJD
through autopsy procedures should be acknowledged and
recognized as an opportunity to address proper infection
control techniques.
Enhancing surveillance for variant CJD and other
emerging prion diseases will require educating neurolo-
gists and pathologists, addressing the perceived obstacles
to obtaining autopsy, and encouraging the use of available
resources that provide expertise and technical assistance in
evaluating CJD. For example, brain tissue can be submit-
ted to the National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance
Center (NPDPSC) in Cleveland, Ohio, for free state-of-
the-art diagnostic testing (14). The availability of a nation-
al center of expertise may facilitate obtaining tissue
evaluation; since the inception of NPDPSC, the number of
referrals to the facility has more than doubled, from 104 in
1997 to 265 in 2002, and the number of TSE cases con-
firmed from those referrals increased from 60 in 1997 to
151 in 2002 (14). Regional academic institutions, such as
the University of California, San Francisco, Memory and
Aging Center, can also provide expertise and assistance
with diagnostic testing. Such resources are vital to main-
taining vigilance for cases of CJD and potentially emerg-
ing human TSEs, such as variant CJD or possibly a human
form of chronic wasting disease in the United States.
