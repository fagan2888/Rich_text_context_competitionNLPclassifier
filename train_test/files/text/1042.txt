ABSTRACT Statistically significant declines in chronic dis-
ability prevalence rates were observed in the elderly United
States population between the 1982 and 1989 National Long
Term Care Surveys (NLTCS). The 1994 NLTCS was used to
investigate whether disability rate declines continued to 1994.
The 1982, 1984, 1989, and 1994 NLTCS employ the same sample
design and instrumentation so that trends in disability can be
estimated with minimal sampling and measurement bias. Age
(5-year categories from 65 to >95)-specific rates were calculated
for the 1982 NLTCS and applied to United States Census Bureau
estimates of the 1994 population to calculate chronic disability
prevalence rates adjusted for aging in the United States popu-
lation aged >65. The 1982 age standardized rates were compared
with 1994 NLTCS estimates. The prevalence of disability esti-
mated for 1994 (21.3%) was 3.6% lower than the 1982 age
standardized rate (24.9%)--a highly significant reduction (t 
8.5; P <
< 0.0001). Of the 3.6 percentage point decline in
prevalence, 1.7% occurred in the 5 years between 1989 and
1994--compared with the 1.9% decline in the 7 years between
1982 and 1989. Both declines are significant. Because of the
shorter time period, the per year decline in disability prevalence
from 1989 to 1994 was greater than that from 1982 to 1989. Given
the higher acute and long-term care service needs of the disabled
elderly population, Medicare, Medicaid, and private health ex-
penditures may be dramatically lower than if declines had not
occurred.
Changes in the prevalence of chronic disability in the United
States elderly population are important for several reasons.
First, many models of health changes in developed societies
have suggested that industrialized, economically advanced
countries would present social and public health problems that
increase chronic disease and mortality risks (1, 2). When it was
recognized in 1982 that United States chronic disease mor-
tality rates above age 65 had been declining since at least 1968,
with the consequence that the United States elderly popula-
tion was growing faster than projected by the Social Security
Administration (3, 4), the question was raised of whether
chronic disease and disability rates had changed in a parallel
fashion. If they had, one might expect the period of life
afflicted with chronic morbidity and disability to remain
relatively constant--or decline (5, 6). On the other hand, if
chronic morbidity and disability incidence remained un-
changed, with life expectancy increases above 65 largely due to
improved medical treatments, then the period of life spent
disabled might have increased (7). In this latter case, raising
the normal retirement age for Social Security might not be a
feasible solution to the problem. These questions played a
major role in the debate about the changes in Social Security
legislation finally passed in 1983. Because of a lack of clear
evidence as to which scenario dominated health changes from
1968 to 1983, and which scenario would be likely to dominate
in the future, a mixed strategy of a small increase in the normal
retirement age (from 65 to 67 between the years 2003 and
2027) and increased payroll taxes was adopted. These policy
options have to be revisited before large numbers of post-
World War II baby boom cohorts pass the ages of 65 to 67
between the years 2011 and 2030.
Second, chronic disability, especially for elderly populations,
is a sensitive measure of age-related changes in the health and
biological fitness of individuals. It is a crucial question about
the age rate of physiological changes, of whether recent
increases in United States life expectancy at ages 65, and
apparent changes in the manifest lifespan [i.e., the highest age
to which individuals in a population are observed to live (8, 9)]
are associated with not only reductions of chronic disease
prevalence, but also increases in the average level of physical
functioning at specific late ages. In this sense, disability is a
marker of whether life expectancy increases are associated
with changes in the age rate of loss of the average biological
fitness of a population--a marker that could be interpreted as
measuring changes in the biological rate of aging (10). This
measure would be useful to help assess whether changes in the
biological rate of aging, as inferred from models of the force
of mortality [e.g., changes in the shape parameter of the
Gompertz hazard function (11, 12); in some cases changes in
the shape parameter is conditional on risk factor dynamics
(13)], correlate with changes in the biological fitness of the
United States elderly population as reflected in age-specific
disability rates calculated from longitudinal survey data.
The arguments for using disability measures to make these
assessments are substantive and methodological. Substantively,
the dimensions of chronic disability are not only a product of
chronic morbidity but are, increasingly, at advanced ages, primary
risk factors for diseases such as stroke (14), coronary heart
disease, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, and cancer (15­18).
Specifically, in middle age, disability is often viewed as a product
of the age-related progression of the severity of specific chronic
disease processes. At late ages (e.g., starting at 65) chronic
disability will increasingly be a result of (i) the interaction of
multiple disease processes (rather than the product of a single
disease process) andor (ii) the product of more general losses of
physiological functions due to global processes of senescence (19).
For example, declines in immune function with age increase the
risk of pulmonary viral and bacterial infections leading to pneu-
monia. Decreased physical activity will lead to deconditioning of
cardiopulmonary function, general vascular tone, and the fitness
of voluntary muscles that may impair the efficiency of peripheral
vascular function (10, 18, 20, 21). Thus, current reductions in the

prevalence of chronic disability may affect the future prevalence
of chronic disease and mortality risk in the United States elderly
population.
Changes in chronic disability are very important for the United
States health care system, because persons with chronic disabil-
ities tend to have higher per capita Medicare, Medicaid, and other
acute and chronic care health costs than nondisabled persons
(22­24). Thus, reductions in chronic disability at late ages may
have important direct and indirect effects on the future rate of
growth of United States health care expenditures.
Methodologically, longitudinal measurements of chronic dis-
ability are important because they are easier to assess in nationally
representative population surveys than many physiological risk
factors or biomarkers of aging, which require blood drawing or
other physically invasive (and expensive) tests and procedures (25,
26). The information content of longitudinal population moni-
toring can be greatly enhanced by linking an individual's survey
data to hisher continuous records of Medicare Part A and B
service use. They also provide a temporal matrix for integrating
data from specialized health studies--an integration that in-
creases the value of that specialized health information by helping
to assess, and possibly enhance, its population and temporal
representativeness (27­29).
Though chronic disability time series are important to
monitor age-specific changes in population health and biolog-
ical fitness, measurement of chronic disability, especially in
elderly populations, is complicated by the different types and
degrees of disability manifest (13). There is no universal ``gold
standard'' for measuring disability (30, 31). Measurement is
less difficult for severe disability, where physical manifesta-
tions are readily observed and evaluated. Despite these meth-
odological issues, measurements of disability are surprisingly
robust, with national estimates of the prevalence of chronic,
severe disability in the elderly shown to agree across several
national surveys, even with differences in questionnaire word-
ing, in a large federal interagency study (32). If assessed with
the same instrument over time, and using similarly structured
and coordinated samples, the likelihood of bias in estimates of
prevalence change would be further reduced.
In this study, the prevalence of chronic disability and
institutionalization in the elderly Unites States population was
assessed for 1994 using the 1982 and 1994 National Long Term
Care Surveys (NLTCS). Disability prevalence rates for 1982
were standardized to the July 1, 1994 Unites States population
age distribution (33). The 1982 standardized rates were then
compared with the 1994 observed rates to ascertain the size
and direction of disability changes from 1982 to 1994 in the
United States elderly population. This extends prior studies of
the NLTCS, which documented significant declines in chronic
disability from 1982 to 1989 (34, 35)
DATA
The data analyzed are individual reports of chronic (lasting, or
expected to last, 90 days) impairments in activities of daily living
(36) (ADL), instrumental activities of daily living (37) (IADL),
and institutional residence from the 1982 and 1994 NLTCS. In
each survey the same disability and medical condition questions
were asked using identical field procedures and by the same
survey organization (United States Census Bureau). This mini-
mizes bias in disability trend estimates by holding constant
instrument and field procedure, and related measurement arti-
fact. The likelihood of bias is also reduced by the high (95%)
response rates in all four NLTCS.
The samples for both NLTCS examined are large (i.e., 20,485
in 1982 and 19,171 in 1994) and designed to represent with
precision the traits of the oldest­old population aged 85, a
subgroup with high chronic disability prevalence rates, in each
year. New samples of 5000 persons who attained age 65
between each pair of surveys were drawn from Medicare files in
1984, 1989, and 1994 to represent the United States population
aged 65, in each year. In the 1994 NLTCS, screening is done of
persons in the new sample component and of persons who were
not disabled in prior samples, to identify chronic disability
incident between 1989 and 1994. The samples, being drawn from
Medicare enrollment files, are nationally representative of both
community and institutional residents. Persons who receive a
detailed interview in one survey year are automatically inter-
viewed in all subsequent surveys until death. Because persons are
followed through the Medicare record system, nearly 100% of
cases can be longitudinally tracked so declines, as well as in-
creases, in disability in previously disabled individuals can be
identified, as well as exact dates of death.
In analyses of both the 1982 and 1994 NLTCS, United States
Census Bureau cross-sectional sample weights were used. In
1989, the definition of institutional residence was expanded by
the Census Bureau so that estimates of change in the institu-
tional population may be conservative.
METHODS
Age (by 5-year categories from 65 to 95)-specific rates were
calculated for persons with chronic disabilities, or who were
institutionalized, in the 1982 and 1994 NLTCS. Disability was
defined as the inability to perform 1 IADL (e.g., cooking, doing
laundry) due to health or aging, or the inability to perform at least
one ADL (e.g., bathing, dressing) without using personal assis-
tance or special equipment. Because institutional residents report
an average of 4.8 ADLs impaired, they were used to define a
separate high disability group. To be identified as chronically
disabled when initially selected for a detailed interview a sample
person had to have at least one ADL or IADL disability that had
lasted, or was expected to last, 90 days. Disability was grouped
into five categories, i.e., those with 1 IADL impaired (but no
ADL impaired), those with 1­2, 3­4, or 5­6 ADLs impaired, or
persons residing in institutions reporting disability. All other
persons were defined as not disabled.
Age-specific disability prevalences from the 1982 NLTCS were
applied to Census Bureau age-specific population estimates for
July 1, 1994 (33). Standard errors for the proportions were
calculated from respondent counts. Changes in proportions were
assessed using a test of differences in binomial probabilities.
RESULTS
In Table 1 we present the observed distribution of chronic
disability in 1994 and the distribution of chronic disability that
would have occurred in 1994 if the 1982 age-specific rates had not
changed.
The proportion of the United States population aged 65 that
would have been chronically disabled or institutionalized in 1994,
had 1982 age-specific disability rates not changed, is 24.9%. The
proportion observed to be chronically disabled in 1994 was
21.3%.
The United States chronically disabled elderly population in
1994 is 3.6% smaller (i.e., a decline from 24.9 to 21.3%), than

if the 1982 chronic disability prevalence rates had not changed.
This is a relative decline from 1982 of 14.5% in the 1994
disability prevalence rates. The decline of 3.6% is highly
significant (t  8.5; P 
 0.0001). The two standard error
confidence bounds for the decline are 2.8 and 4.4%. The lower
confidence bound (2.8%) is 50% greater than the 1.9% age
standardized decline observed from 1982 to 1989. Thus, the
decline in the prevalence of disability from 1982 to 1994 is
significantly larger than the 1982 to 1989 decline.
In absolute terms, the change in prevalence suggests that there
are 1.2 million fewer disabled persons in 1994 (i.e., 8.3 million vs.
7.1 million) than if the 1982 rates had not changed. Declines
occurred at all but one level of disability. The disability level
specific declines are each highly significant (P  0.0001). The one
increase in chronic disability prevalence, for persons with 3­4
ADLs disabled (0.3%), was not significant (t  1.6; P  0.10).
Changes for persons aged 65­74, 75­84, and 85 are
presented in Table 2 for the nondisabled, those with only
IADLs impaired, and those with at least one ADL impaired,
or who are institutional residents.
Differences between the proportions of the elderly population
who were not chronically disabled in 1994 and who would be
expected not to be disabled in 1994 based on 1982 rates, increased
with age, i.e., 2.6, 5.0, and 5.4% for ages 65­74, 75­84, and 85,
respectively. The declines in the proportion with 1 IADL
impaired were significant at ages 65­74 and 75­84. The decline
(0.7%) at ages 85 was not significant (t  1.0). The decline of
the proportion of the population with 1 ADL impaired, or in
institutional residence, was significant at all ages (i.e., 1.5%, 3.3%,
and 4.7% for ages 65­74, 75­84 and 85, respectively). Often,
long-term care (LTC) insurance policies require a person to have
3 ADLs impaired (not shown) before qualifying for benefits.
The proportion with 3 ADLs impaired declined significantly
from 1982 to 1994, both overall (1.6%) and for specific age
groups, i.e., declines of 1.0%, 2.5%, and 2.4% for ages 65­74,
75­74, and 85, respectively.
The 5000 person sample drawn in 1994 to represent persons
passing age 65 between 1989 and 1994 is independent of the
subsample of persons aged 65 to 69 in the 1982 NLTCS.
Disabled survivors to 1994, who were aged 65 in 1982, had
to be at least age 77 in 1994. Thus, declines in disability
between the group aged 65 to 69 in 1982, and the same age
group in 1994, are independent of the effects of previously
responding to an interview (a measurement effect likely small
due to the 5-year period between surveys). The proportion of
nondisabled persons aged 65 to 69 was 88.3% in 1982 and
90.3% in 1994--a significant increase of 2.0% (t  3.4). The
group of persons aged 65 to 74 in 1982 is also independent of
the group aged 65 to 74 in 1994. The increase in the proportion
of nondisabled persons for that age group is larger (2.62%) and
highly significant (t  5.34). The decline between 1982 and
1994 (from 4.6 to 3.8%) in persons aged 65 to 69 with 3 ADLs
impaired was significant (t  2.0). Significant declines were
observed to the oldest ages examined, e.g., the decline between
1982 and 1994 in the proportion of persons aged 95 who were
chronically disabled was 7.77% (SE  2.42%; t  3.2). Thus,
declines in chronic disability were widespread, being found in
most age and disability level specific subgroups.
DISCUSSION
The NLTCS data show declines in disability prevalence, ob-
served from 1982 to 1989, in the United States elderly popu-
lation, continued to 1994. If declines from 1989 to 1994
occurred at the same rate as between 1982 and 1989, the
prevalence decline over the 5 years would have been 1.36%--
compared with the 1.7% observed. Thus, declines in disability
observed from 1982 to 1989 not only continued, but acceler-
ated, from 0.27% per year from 1982 to 1989 to 0.34% per year
from 1989 to 1994. Declines were manifest for all ages, even at
ages of 95, and for the highest levels of disability. This is
consistent with declines in United States mortality observed at
ages of 80 (38), and with the proposition that higher United
States expenditures on LTC better meet the needs of the very
elderly than the lower LTC expenditures, and less complete
LTC service availability, in Japan (39, 40).
It is useful to examine what the prevalence rate changes from
1982 to 1994 imply for the number of disabled elderly persons
at specific dates. This is shown in Fig. 1.
The 1982 United States population of 26.9 million persons aged
65 had 6.4 million chronically disabled persons (35). By 1989 the
number disabled grew 9.4% to 7.0 million persons--as opposed
to the expected increase of 17.2% (14.5% due to the greater
number of persons age 65, and 2.7% due to the aging of the 65
population). By 1994 the number chronically disabled had grown
10.9% to 7.1 million persons--rather than to 8.3 million persons,
the 29.7% increase expected (25.3% due to the growth of the
United States elderly population and 4.4% to the aging of that
population) if the 1982 rates had not changed. If the 0.34%
decline in disability per year (observed from 1989 to 1994)
continued to 1996, the decline from 1982 to 1996 would be 4.3%.
There would then be 7.3 million disabled persons in 1996 (an
increase of 14.1%) compared with 8.7 million persons (an in-
crease of 32.8%; 26.8% due to the growth of the 65 population
and 6.0% due to its aging) if the 1982 rates had not changed--a
difference of 1.4 million persons.
Of the 1982 to 1994 decline in prevalence, two-thirds (2.4%) is
due to changes in nonstandardized rates (i.e., the observed
disability prevalence in 1982 was 23.7% compared with 21.3% in
1994). This 2.4% decline is over twice the decline (1.1%) in the
nonstandardized rate changes (i.e., from 23.7 to 22.6%) from
1982 to 1989 (35). One-third of the change is due to the
standardization used to adjust for aging of the United States
elderly population. The sensitivity of the change estimate to the
use of different standard populations was examined. Though the
prevalence rates changed moderately when different standard
populations (e.g., different intercensal estimates) were used, since
the 1982 standardized and 1994 observed rates reflect the same
1994 population distribution, the change estimate is robust to the
selection of a standard population.
In addition to a decline in the number of persons with chronic
disability there was also a small decline (2.0%) in the average
number of ADLs reported by persons who were ADL-disabled in
both years. This reduction of 395,648 ADL impairments reported
by the disabled population suggests that the population burden of
disability was further reduced by an equivalent of 111,765 dis-
abled persons--each with an average of 3.54 ADLs.

Two related issues of importance are (i) that the association
of disability declines with changes in other measures of health
and biological fitness at late ages and (ii) the identification of
possible causes of the disability decline.
The declines in chronic disability are related to changes in other
covariates in the NLTCS thought to be related to the likelihood
of being chronically disabled at a given age. Education has been
negatively related to the age-specific likelihood of being chron-
ically disabled (24). The proportion of the population aged 85 to
89, with 0­7 years of education, has been estimated to decline
dramatically, from 60% in 1980 to 10­15% by the year 2015
(41). It may be that this relation was due to only a select portion
of the population receiving high levels of education in the past. As
high levels of education become more prevalent, unless there is
a causal relation, the ability of education to predict disability
might be attenuated. Though such selection is a possible expla-
nation, it would have to operate even though most schooling is
done early in life (i.e., by age 30), whereas we are examining
disability changes at ages 65. Because education is largely
completed by age 30 this raises the question of what intermediate
health care and biological mechanisms may be reducing the
probability of disability for better educated persons. There are
many candidate factors, i.e., better educated persons tend to more
readily adopt healthy behaviors (e.g., maintaining physical activ-
ity at late ages, reducing risk factor exposures such as smoking,
improving nutrition). Better educated persons are also more
likely to have had better medical care both early in life and in
middle age, up to age 65, when qualifying for Medicare--in part
because of higher rates of health insurance coverage up to age 65
for better educated persons (42). Better educated persons are also
better equipped to comply with complex and long-term medical
treatments--especially for chronic conditions engendering co-
morbidities such as hypertension or diabetes. They are also more
likely to exhibit fewer disabilities even with a chronic condition
present (43, 44). Finally, there is evidence suggesting education is
negatively associated with the incidence of Alzheimer's dis-
ease--a prevalent and highly disabling condition (45).
An analysis of changes in disability levels by cohort (cohort
effects were correlated with education) suggests that the age
rate of disability increase (and, inferentially, of the biological
rate of aging) is slower in younger, than older, cohorts. Since
factors related to cohort membership are, by definition, per-
sistent, this suggests that period differences in chronic disabil-
ity are likely to continue past 1994, because those cohorts
succeed one another at late ages where the general level of
disability is high (70, 71).
Analysis of changes in 16 chronic diseases show that there were
large declines in the prevalence of those conditions from 1982 to
1989 (35). To the extent that the progression of chronic disease
increases chronic disability after a lag [say of 3­5 years for ages
75­79 (46, 47)], this is consistent with the continuation of the
disability declines observed from 1989 to 1994. The decline in
chronic diseases observed from 1982 to 1989 is, itself, consistent
with trends in risk factors that showed, in the four National
Health and Nutrition Examination Surveys done from 1960 to
1990, declines in hypertension, cholesterol levels, and smoking for
persons aged 65 to 74 (48, 49). This is in contrast to Germany
where a 19% decrease in cardiovascular disease mortality from
1984 to 1989 was argued by German researchers to be most likely
due to improved medical therapy, because cardiovascular disease
risk factors (50) and smoking (51) showed little or no improve-
ment in studies done from 1970 to 1991.
Chronic disease and disability prevalence may have been
declining in the United States for a much longer period of time
than from 1982 to 1994. Fogel (52) found that heart disease
prevalence, a disabling chronic disease, declined 6% per decade
for 75 years from Civil War veterans evaluated at age 65 in 1910
to World War II veterans aged 65 in 1985 to 1988. Lanska and
Mi (53) found stroke mortality (stroke being a disease engen-
dering significant chronic disability) had declined since 1925.
Multiple changes in the questionnaires and samples used in
the National Health Interview Surveys over time make long-
term disability trends difficult to estimate (54) and compari-
sons with other surveys problematic (54­56). Waidmann et al.
(54) attempted to resolve those difficulties by using a variety
of survey and epidemiological data sets and making adjust-
ments for known methodological problems. They found that
not only did United States disability decline in the 1980s, but
that apparent increases in disability in the 1970s were likely due
to measurement difficulties with National Center for Health
Statistics surveys done in that period (54­57). Administrative
data also suggest that declines in institutional residence ob-
served in the NLTCS are consistent with declines in Medicaid
reimbursed nursing home use by the elderly (49), the tendency
toward shorter nursing home stays with more medically inten-
sive care, and the increased use in the United States of home
health services for LTC (58).
Very long-term changes in chronic disease prevalence are less
likely due to medical innovation than to changes in nutrition and
public hygiene. A number of long-term trends in these factors
possibly contributed to declines in chronic disease and disability.
One factor is improvement in public hygiene and sanitation. A

recently discovered pathogen, Helicobacter pylori, may explain
long-term declines in gastric cancer (since the 1930s) and changes
in peptic ulcer prevalence (59). Improvements in water quality
may have reduced exposure to this pathogen. A second factor
possibly contributing to long-term declines in stroke and gastric
cancer is the reduced use of salt as a food preservative as
refrigeration became more widely used (60). Indeed, salt con-
sumption and H. pylori infection may interact to increase disease
risk, as may salt and increased nitrate consumption. A third factor
is better regulation of commercial food processing and livestock
management. Commercial food processing, especially thermal
processing of meats, may have reduced the prevalence of food-
borne pathogens possibly contributing to atherosclerosis (61).
Food processing expanded rapidly after 1950. Regulation of
livestock feeding and handling may also have reduced food-borne
viral pathogens. Fourth, food supplementation was initiated after
the discovery in 1917 of the relation of cod liver oil consumption
to rickets. Vitamin D supplementation, either by fish oil con-
sumption or the UV radiation of milk, was widely spread by 1924
in the United States. British studies suggest that nutritional
deficiencies in pregnancy may affect fetal development in ways to
increase the risk of chronic disease in late adult life. Finally, a
number of lifestyle factors could have contributed to changes.
United States surgeon general reports in the early 1960s may have
reduced smoking rates in successive birth cohorts (62).
The impact of medical therapy on disability prevalence is hard
to assess because many treatment innovations for chronic diseases
are recent [e.g., ACE-II inhibitors to control hypertension (63,
64)]. There are also relatively old medical interventions whose full
range of effects on chronic disease and disability are just begin-
ning to be understood. Exogenous estrogens were used in 1985 by
3 million United States women to treat postmenopausal symp-
toms. By 1995, nearly 10 million United States women were
taking estrogens, which may have benefit for such highly preva-
lent, disabling conditions as osteoporosis and cardiovascular
disease (65­67). A recent study suggested that exogenous estro-
gens might delay the onset of Alzheimer's disease by 5­8 years--
and possibly reduce the prevalence of that highly disabling
condition in females by 50%. Aspirin may reduce the risk of
colorectal cancer and recurrences of stroke and heart disease.
Recent data suggest that nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs
may also reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease--possibly by
25­40%. The effects of aspirin and other nonsteroidal antiin-
flammatory drugs, because of their widespread use, could affect
the health of a large proportion of the United States elderly
population. These older interventions may combine with numer-
ous more recent medical advances to cause both chronic disease
and disability to continue to decline for a long time--with the
implication of exogenously altering basic biological parameters
reflecting age changes.
Disability declines of the size in Fig. 1 may have important
implications for national health care costs. For example, the
1994 United States institutional population was estimated to
be 1.7 million persons. The 1982 rates, after age standardiza-
tion, implied 2.1 million persons would be institutionalized in
1994. The difference of 400,000 implies, assuming an annual
per capita nursing home cost in 1994 of $43,300 (49), savings
of $17.3 billion in nursing home expenses in 1994. That does
not include additional potential savings for acute care expen-
ditures (22). Specifically, if age increase in the prevalence of
chronic disability is a marker of the rate of loss of biological
function, then decreases in the number of chronically disabled
persons implies that persons in ``predisabled'' states are also
losing biological function at a slower rate. Thus, declines in the
number of disabled persons at late ages may imply better
function and lower health care needs in a large proportion of
the younger portion of the United States elderly population. If
many acute care medical expenditures are due to chronic
disability (22), then the decline in the prevalence of disability
rates from 1989 to 1994, which caused the disabled elderly
population to grow more slowly than the total elderly popu-
lation, could portend slower rates of growth in national health
expenditures in the future. A number of factors could affect
this. The interpretation above assumed that the length of time
a person remains disabled is relatively constant. In contrast,
prevalence could decline if the same number of persons were
disabled for shorter periods of time. This might seem reason-
able in the context of declining life expectancy, i.e., that
persons live a shorter period of time after a potentially
disabling chronic disease became manifest. However, United
States life expectancy has increased at later ages. If the
prevalence decline were due to shorter disability episodes
among the same number of persons this would require, in the
context of increasing late age life expectancy, the proportion
of the lifespan spent in nondisabled states to increase. That is,
constraining the standard epidemiologic relation of prevalence
to the incidence and duration of a chronic health event is an
increasing late age life expectancy.
A change in the relation of disability duration and incidence
could also have important effects on costs by changing the mix of
medical services required. For example, institutional and infor-
mal care use would increase if the duration of disability increased.
If duration of disability decreased, as health events increased in
incidence, this might shift costs to hospital use and other types of
acute health services.
Understanding the effects of chronic disability changes on the
level and mix of health service expenditures is important in that
currently there is great concern for the fiscal stability of Medicare.
Beginning in 2001, the Medicare Trust Fund is projected to go
into negative balance (69). Concerns about Medicare expendi-
tures will increase until at least 2028 when the largest post-World
War II baby boom cohorts pass age 65.
Unless gross domestic product grows faster than projected, the
projected increases in the size of the elderly population relative
to the labor force (and taxable payroll base) could require large
changes in the Medicare program to maintain fiscal balance.
However, projections of Medicare expenditures are based on the
projected growth of the United States elderly population--with
no assumptions made about how health changes before death in
the calculations--even though life expectancy is projected to
continue to increase at late ages. Thus, if declines in chronic
disability continue, the magnitude of changes required in the
Medicare (and Medicaid) benefits might be reduced because of
two factors. One is the change in the ratio of the size of the United
States population aged say, 18­64, to the population aged 65,
who are chronically disabled. This differs from the standard
dependency ratio of the 18­64 to 65 populations in that it would
reflect changes in the aggregate health of the over 65 popula-
tion--changes that could have large effects on Medicare and
other health expenditures. For example, Medicare Part A and B
expenditures are higher for chronically disabled persons. This is
due to a variety of factors, e.g., persons with severe chronic
disability are likely affected by medical conditions requiring
considerable acute care. To maintain the health of a chronically
disabled person, one thus has to provide large amounts of medical
service to deal with morbidity engendered by the physiological
effects of disability.
To keep a constant ratio between the United States popu-
lation aged 18­64 as projected for 2028, to the number of
disabled persons over 65, the disability prevalence rate above
age 65 would have to be reduced 1.5% each year for 34 years,
i.e., an overall reduction of 1  (0.98530)  0.402, or 40.2% in
34 years. The rate of decline from 1982 to 1994 has been 1.2%
per year, so a 1.5% rate of decline in the disability prevalence
rate is conceivable. However, it is important to recognize that
after the peak in 2028, the size of the age 65 population
relative to the population aged 18­64 declines. Hence, to
maintain a constant ratio in 2050, the per annum rate of
decline in the prevalence of disability above age 65 required is
lower--roughly 1.2%, the same rate of decline observed from
Medical Sciences: Manton et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 94 (1997) 2597
1982 to 1994. Even if such rates of decline are not maintained
over these longer periods, any sizeable decline will reduce the
magnitude of Medicare and Medicaid program changes
needed and possibly smooth out the demands induced at the
times of the peak Medicare burden.
A second factor determining how rapidly Medicare's burden
will grow is that the per capita annual rate of Medicare's
expenditures declines with increasing age at death (68). This is
because a large proportion of Medicare costs, at any age, are
made in the 2 years immediately before death. The per capita
expenditures for deaths at age 70 are $22,590, whereas for deaths
at age 101 they decline to $8,300 (1990 dollars; 1989­1990
deaths). This age trajectory of expenditures, combined with the
apparent slowing of biological age changes over time, may have
important consequences for the future burden of the Medicare
program. These were not factored into projections of Mediacre
Trust Fund obligations (3, 22, 55, 69).
In summary, declines in the prevalence of chronic disability,
observed up to age 95, suggest that there have been statistically
significant and biologically important changes in the age rate
of loss of biological fitness in the United States population
associated with increases in life expectancy above age 65. It will
be important to monitor these changes in chronic disability to
determine how the age rates of loss of biological fitness will
behave in the future. These changes may have important
implications in forecasting the future trajectory of changes in
health expenditures in the United States elderly population.
