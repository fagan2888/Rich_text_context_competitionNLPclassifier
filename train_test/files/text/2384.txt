Developing Calibration Weights and Standard-Error
Estimates for a Survey of Drug-Related
Emergency-Department Visits
Phillip S. Kott1 and C. Daniel Day2
This article describes a two-step calibration-weighting scheme for a stratified simple random
sample of hospital emergency departments. The first step adjusts for unit nonresponse. The
second increases the statistical efficiency of most estimators of interest. Both use a measure of
emergency-department size and other useful auxiliary variables contained in the sampling
frame. Although many survey variables are roughly a linear function of the measure of size,
response is better modeled as a function of the log of that measure. Consequently the log of
size is a calibration variable in the nonresponse-adjustment step, while the measure of size
itself is a calibration variable in the second calibration step. Nonlinear calibration procedures
are employed in both steps. We show with 2010 DAWN data that estimating variances
as if a one-step calibration weighting routine had been used when there were in fact two
steps can, after appropriately adjusting the finite-population correct in some sense, produce
standard-error estimates that tend to be slightly conservative.
Key words: Frame variable; response model; prediction model; general exponential model;
finite population correction.
1. Introduction
The Drug Abuse Warning Network or DAWN (Substance Abuse and Mental Health
Services Administration 2012) was a national stratified random sample of US hospitals
used to estimate annual drug-related emergency-department visits and related statistics.
This article describes a calibration-weighting strategy for the DAWN that was never
implemented because the survey was discontinued after 2012. Nevertheless, we feel this
strategy and our contemplated approach to variance/mean squared error estimation
contained some innovative features worth sharing.
The DAWN sample was drawn from a list frame provided by the American Hospital
Association (AHA). The frame was stratified by location, size, and ownership type (public
vs. private). Hospitals were oversampled within 13 metropolitan areas, for which domain
estimates were published when respondent sample sizes were deemed large enough.

In the estimation strategy used operationally for DAWN, the weight for a respondent
began with the hospital's design weight. A nonresponse adjustment factor was applied
to each weight to account for those hospitals that were sampled but did not participate
in the DAWN survey. This was followed by a sample balancing ­ often called a
"poststratification" adjustment ­ to improve the efficiency (reduce the variances) of most
of the resulting nearly (i.e., asymptotically) unbiased estimates. Both steps employed
simple weighting-class adjustments requiring ad hoc collapsing schemes when there were
too few respondents in a class or the class adjustment factor was deemed too large.
In this article, we will describe alternative approaches to these two adjustments.
For simplicity, we will ignore the subsampling of visits and visit-level nonresponse
adjustments that took place within some DAWN hospitals.
The new nonresponse adjustment factors use a calibration-weighting routine that
implicitly models the probability that a hospital responds to (participates in) the DAWN
survey. It does this by assuming hospital response is a function of its characteristics, such
as its size, measured by annual emergency-department (ED) visits on the AHA frame,
ownership (public or private), region, and the population density of the county in which it
is located. If the response model is correctly specified, as we assume it is, then employing
this calibration-weighting routine produces nearly unbiased estimates of DAWN totals.
The new sample-balancing adjustment factors are produced using a version of nearly
pseudo-optimal calibration (Kott 2011) that forces each final weight to no less than 1.
Sample balancing exploits the fact that the variables measured by the DAWN survey, such
as annual drug-related ED visits, are functions of characteristics known for all hospitals
on the AHA frame. Calibrating the respondents' weights so that the estimated totals of
(some of) those characteristics computed from the respondent sample exactly equal
corresponding frame (AHA) totals tends to increase the efficiency of estimated DAWN
totals, which remain nearly unbiased.
Evaluation of the nonresponse pattern in DAWN data from 2010 lead us to treating
the hospitals from the 13 metropolitan areas as one subpopulation and the remaining
hospitals as a separate subpopulation. For brevity's sake we restrict our attention in this
article to nonresponse modeling and weight adjustments for the former subpopulation.
Similar methods can be used for the subpopulation of remaining hospitals. The impact
of finite-population correction on variance estimation is much less of an issue in that
subpopulation.
Although the DAWN published domain estimates for many of the 13 metropolitan
areas, we investigated domain estimates within the four US census regions instead. This
kept the respondent sample sizes within domains more respectable given that much of the
theory underpinning calibration weighting is asymptotic.
Since many DAWN hospitals were sampled with certainty (before nonresponse), we
restrict our attention in this article to linearization-based variance estimators of nearly
unbiased estimated totals that require finite population correction. Most software designed
to estimate variances using linearization-based methods only capture the increase in
variance from the respondent sample size being smaller than the before-nonresponse
sample size and from the final weights being more variable than the original weights. We
will describe linearization-based methods that also capture the decrease in variance
resulting from hitting calibration targets as well as from finite population correction.

The software package SUDAAN 11w (RTI 2012) can produce linearization-based
measures that estimate variances appropriately when there is a single step of calibration
weighting, but not (easily) when there are multiple calibration steps. We will discuss a
simplified variance estimator for the DAWN given our two-step calibration scheme that
can be implemented in SUDAAN 11. The resulting estimated variances tend to be slightly
conservative when applied to DAWN data from 2010.
Calibration weighting for the DAWN is discussed in Section 2. Section 3 addresses
variance estimation after calibration weighting. Section 4 contrasts alternative variance
estimators using DAWN data, while Section 5 offers some concluding remarks.
2. Calibration Weighting for the DAWN
2.1. Nonresponse Adjustment
Let dk
be the design weight for a sampled DAWN hospital k. For our purposes, this was the
population size of the stratum (say h) containing k divided by its sample size (Nh
/nh
). The
strata within a metropolitan area were determined by size class (up to three within an area)
and ownership type.
Following Folsom (1991), our nonresponse-adjusted weight for a DAWN respondent k
has the form:
ak
¼ dk
1 þ exp ðgT xk
Þ
Â Ã
; ð1Þ
where xk
is a vector of the respondent's characteristics to be described shortly, and g is
determined using Newton's method (successive linear approximation) so that the
calibration equation

dj

Þ
Â Ã

holds where R is the respondent sample and S the sample before nonresponse.
The value
pk
¼ pðgT xk
Þ ¼ 1= 1 þ exp ðgT xk
Þ
Â Ã
implicitly estimates the probability that k is a respondent given its characteristics in
vector xk
.
Although pðgT xk
Þ is a logistic function of gT xk
, this method in not the same as finding
g using either maximum likelihood (i.e., so that
P
S
1 þ exp ðgT xk
Þ
Â Ã

n o

¼ 0,
where Ij
¼ 1 if j [ R and 0 otherwise) or quasi-maximum (i.e., so that
P
S
dj
1 þ exp ðgT xk
Þ
Â Ã
212Ij
n o
xj
¼ 0Þ. Kim and Riddles (2012) show why the
calibration approach in Equation (2) can lead to estimated totals with smaller variances
than maximum-likelihood-based alternatives.
Preliminary analyses of 2010 DAWN data strongly suggested that the probability of
response was better modeled as the log of the AHA emergency-department visits than as a
direct function of ED visits. This is a more sensible result than it may appear to be. It
means that a one percent increase in the size measure lead to an r percent increase in the
odds of response, all other things being equal.
Kott and Day: Developing Calibration Weights and Standard-Error 523
After extensive model searching, we ultimately assumed unit response to be a logistic
model of an xk
vector containing the log of the number of AHA emergency-department
visits, which we denote log(qk
), dummy variables for each of the 13 metropolitan areas,
d1k
, : : : , d13k
, an indicator for a public (as opposed to private) hospital, dPk
, an interaction
term between the public indicators and one of the area dummies dPk
d13k
, and the log of the
population density within the ZIP code containing the hospital (from US Census Bureau
2012) with imputation of missing values when needed, tk
. Note that qk
must always be
positive, which it was, so that log(qk
) can be defined.
Although we assume we know the correct form of the model governing the response
probabilities for each hospital, rk
¼ pðgT xk
Þ ¼ 1=½1 þ exp ðgT xk
Þ, we can only estimate
the parameter g with g in Equation (2). We further assume that whether or not a hospital k
responds given xk
is independent of whether another hospital responds.
2.2. Sample Balancing
Like most government surveys, the DAWN produces a number of estimates. It is possible
that a weight adjustment will decrease the variances of some estimates while increasing
those of others. Nevertheless, we chose to focus our sample-balancing efforts on reducing
the variance of a single estimate: the total number of drug-related emergency-department
visits. This can be viewed as the "flagship" variable of the DAWN survey. Not only is it
important in its own right, but it is related to many of the DAWN survey variables.
Using the nonresponse-adjusted weights from the previous step (the ak
), ignoring strata
(and thus the need to collapse strata with only a single responding hospital) but otherwise
using a routine sensitive to the sampling design, we fit linear models of drug-related
emergency-department visits, yk
, using covariates available on the AHA frame.
The model we liked best effectively modeled not yk
but yk
/qk
as a function of four
census-region dummies, u1k
, : : : , u4k
, log(qk
), and u1k
dPk
through u4k
dPk
. Observe that
yk
/qk
is the ratio of the number of drug-related emergency-department visits to a proxy of
all emergency-department visits (using a previous year's data). The final model fit yk
as a
linear function of qk
u1k
, : : : , qk
u4k
, qk
log(qk
), and qk
u1k
dPk
through qk
u4k
dPk
.
Following the advice in Kott (2011), we set final calibration weights at

The fraction on the right-hand side of Equation (3) is a particular version of the general
exponential model of Folsom and Singh (2000):

This version is centered at 1 (all ck
are 1) with all Ak
¼ Bk
. With some work, one can
see that the right-hand side of Equation (4) is nearly equal to 1 þ hT dk
when hT dk
is
small, which it should be assuming we have already appropriately adjusted for
Journal of Official Statistics

nonresponse (and there are no frame coverage issues). By setting lk
¼ 1/ak
, no weight can
be less than 1. Finally, letting dk
¼ ½ak
2 1zk
will tend to produce more efficient
estimates than the conventional setting dk
¼ zk
.
If no restriction is put on the upper size of the weight adjustment in Equation (3), that is,
if all uk
¼ 1, then
wk
¼ 1 þ ðak
2 1Þ exp ðBk
½ak
2 1hT zk
Þ:
The third census region has only 32 respondents. Without restricting the uk
some of those
have relatively large wk
qk
values. This suggested to us setting uk
in this region to .105Q/qk
,
where Q was the sum or the qj
in the region. This restricts the size of wk
qk
¼ ak
uk
qk
to
10.5% of Q. We chose 10.5% because a restriction to 10% was not possible without the
calibration equations failing to hold.
3. Variance Estimation
Both the weight-adjustment functions, whether ak

in Equation (1) or wk

in Equation

Table 1 displays the sample and respondent sizes for our 2010 DAWN data within

See, for example, Kott and Liao (2012) for a fuller explanation of why Equation (6)
provides a nearly unbiased estimator for the variance of ty,a
when unit response is a logistic
function of xk
. The argument there parallels an earlier one in Kott (2006) where instead
of the respondent sample being calibrated to the full sample as in Equation (2), the
respondent (or full) sample was calibrated to the population using
P

Equation (6) was proposed in Kott (2006) with u ¼ 0. The article shows that by injecting
f 0(gTxk

, one is able to avoid accounting for the pk
only being estimates of
the hospital response probabilities.
Were a simple random sample drawn with replacement within the H strata or if the

The added variance due to nonresponse is contained within what looks like a nai

single-phase variance estimator in Equation (8). The added variability due to the response/
nonresponse phase comes from the ak

¼ dkIk

, where Ik
is the response
indicator for hospital k, and pk
remains the hospital's implicitly estimated probability of
response. Since the Ik
are independent across hospitals, the nai

estimator fully captures the added variance due to nonresponse (for which

Since the variance estimator is nearly unbiased given any respondent sample, it is also
nearly unbiased on average across all respondent samples, that is, under the combination
of the assumed response and prediction models and the original sampling mechanism.
Note that when all the stratum sample fractions are ignorably small, this variance estimator
coincides with vðty;a;S

4. An Application
In this section, we compare variance estimators computed after:
1. Calibrating only for nonresponse pretending the sample was drawn with replacement;
2. Calibrating only for nonresponse;
3. Calibrating for both nonresponse and sample balance but pretending the sample was
drawn with replacement;
4. Calibrating for both nonresponse and sample balance;
5. Calibrating for both nonresponse and sample balance but pretending the sample was
drawn with replacement and using the simplified version of variance estimation
described in the subsection 3.2;
6. Calibrating for both nonresponse and sample balance using the simplified version of
variance estimation described in the subsection 3.2.
Since the estimated totals are different when we only calibrate for nonresponse, we
compare estimated coefficients of variation (cvs) rather than estimated variances.
Henceforth, we will abbreviate an estimated coefficient of variation as cv. The fourth
variance-estimation method above produced nearly unbiased estimates of the variances for
the following six estimated totals we investigated at the US and census-region levels:
all drug-related hospital visits,
alcohol-related visits,
illicit-drug-but-not-alcohol-related visits,
psychotherapeutics-related visits,
stimulant-related visits, and
drug-related visits ending in death
computed within each census region and across the four regions.
We computed some variance estimates pretending the sample was drawn with
replacement since that is how many variances are estimated in practice, either because
Journal of Official Statistics
528
stratum sampling fractions are very small, as they are not here, or because the assumption
makes variance estimation both easy and conservative. It also lets us see what damage, if
any, resulted from our prediction-model-based treatment of finite-population correction.
Both pretending samples were drawn with replacement (WR) and treating them as
drawn without replacement (WOR), the relative increase in the cv's from only calibrating
for nonresponse are displayed in the first two columns of Table 2. We looked at relative
differences in the cvs because the different weights from using one or two calibration-

taking the log of the ratio of the cvs being compared (e.g., log(cvA

number of deaths from drug-related visits both across the US and in the Midwest are larger
after sample balancing. All other cvs are smaller, over 40% smaller on average.
Columns 3 and 4 show that using the simplified variance estimator described in the last
subsection (Equation (6) with the Nh
replaced by the Nh
* in Table 1) increases the cvs
more often than not. When it is not conservative, the simplified method is never more than
3% lower than its nearly unbiased counterpart in the 30 cvs we computed. The results tend
to be more conservative and much more variable when the without-replacement version of
the variance estimator is used, and we employ Equation (11) to counteract what would
otherwise be an over-correction for the large sampling fractions in most strata. Replacing
qk
in Equation (11) by qk
2 would make the simplified cvs a bit less conservative (not
shown). The average upward bias would drop to 4.67%, with a minimum of 27.01% and
a maximum of 21.13%.
5. Some Concluding Remarks
We have shown how to produce calibration weights for the 2010 DAWN respondent sample
of hospitals in two steps ­ the first to remove the bias from unit nonresponse assuming that
we modeled response correctly as a logistic function of covariates, and the second to provide
sample balance and thereby increase the statistical efficiency of most estimated totals. We
have also shown how to compute nearly unbiased measures of the standard errors of
DAWN-estimated totals, providing a simplified version that, although not nearly unbiased,
appears to be mostly conservative and is easily computed using SUDAAN 11.
The reason why the simplified version tends to be conservative is that it replaces a
respondent-sample derived estimate for a parameter (b1
) by 0. To the extent that there are
efficiency gains to be made from the nonresponse calibration-weighting step in addition to
those made in the sample-balancing step 2 and there may not be any (we are effectively
regressing a residual, e2k
on xk
, in the nonresponse-adjustment step) 2 this simplification
will tend to underestimate the true standard error of the two-step calibration.
Since we were able to compute a nearly unbiased measure of the standard errors of
two-step-calibrated estimates, an obvious question is why bother introducing a simplified
version of the computation? The obvious reason is that statisticians will not be able to mimic
what we have done for variance estimation without great effort. Moreover, this effort grows
for estimated ratios, like the fraction of drug-related hospital visits involving alcohol.
Some may wonder why we did not perform the calibration-weighting steps in the
reverse order: sample balancing first, followed by nonresponse adjustment. That clearly
could be done, but we will not follow up on it here. Something to consider before reversing
the calibration steps, however, is that upper bounds on the final weights cannot be set in the
nonresponse-adjustment step unless one is willing to change the form of the response
model being fit. This runs the risk of introducing nonresponse bias. No such risk exists
when setting upper bounds in the sample-balancing step.
