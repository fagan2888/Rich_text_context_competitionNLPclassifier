Abstract
Objective: Over the past few decades, obesity has reached epidemic proportions, and is a major contributor to the global
burden of chronic diseases and disability. There is little evidence on obesity related co-morbidities in BRICS countries. The
first objective is to examine the factors associated with overweight and obesity in four of the five BRICS countries (China,
India, Russia and South Africa). The second is to examine the linkage of obesity with selected morbidities.
Methods: We used data from the Study on Global Ageing and Adult Health (SAGE) survey conducted by the World Health
Organization (WHO) in China, India, Russia and South Africa during 2007­10. The morbidities included in the analysis are
Hypertension, Diabetes, Angina, Stroke, Arthritis and Depression.
Findings: The prevalence of obesity was highest in South Africa (35%) followed by Russia (22%), China (5%) and India (3%).
The prevalence of obesity was significantly higher in females as compared to males in all the countries. While the wealth
quintile was associated with overweight in India and China, engaging in work requiring physical activity was associated with
obesity in China and South Africa. Overweight/obesity was positively associated with Hypertension and Diabetes in all the
four countries. Obesity was also positively associated with Arthritis and Angina in China, Russia and South Africa. In
comparison, overweight/obesity was not associated with Stroke and Depression in any of the four countries.
Conclusion: Obesity was statistically associated with Hypertension, Angina, Diabetes and Arthritis in China, Russia and
South Africa. In India, obesity was associated only with Hypertension and Diabetes.

Introduction
Over the past few decades obesity has emerged as a global
health challenge, with every sixth person being obese [1,2]. In
2008, more than 1.4 billion adults aged 20 or more years were
overweight [3]. Of these, 500 million adult men and women were
obese. Statistics suggest significant variations in the prevalence of
obesity across the globe. The prevalence of obesity ranges from
below 5% in China, Japan and African countries to over 75% in
urban Samoa [4,5].
Obesity is known to affect the overall health of a population.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), overweight
and obesity are the fifth leading risk for global deaths [3]. Obesity
is also found to be associated with a number of non-communicable
diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, muscu-
loskeletal disorders and some forms of cancers [3]. Statistics
indicate that 44% of the diabetes burden, 23% of the heart disease
burden and between 7% and 41% of certain cancer burdens can
be attributed to overweight and obesity [3].
BRICS is an international association of emerging national
economies: Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. The
member countries represent a mix of economies with developing
countries like Brazil, India, China and South Africa and a
developed country like Russia. The share of China, India, Russia
and South Africa together in the total world population is
approximately 40%. In terms of population aged 18 years or older,
these comprise 41% of the world's population [6]. These countries
are at different stages of demographic and epidemiological
transition. Like in many developed countries, obesity is emerging
as an important public health problem in BRICS. Economic
burden of obesity related NCDs in BRICS is considerable.
According to the WHO Report (2005), annual losses in national
income from heart disease, stroke and diabetes are estimated at
$18 billion in China, $11 billion in Russia, $9 billion in India and
$3 billion in Brazil [7]. Furthermore, China is expected to lose
$558 billion over the next 10 years in foregone national income
due to heart disease, stroke, and diabetes alone. India and Russia
are expected to cross $200 billion & $300 billion respectively in the
same period [7]. In addition, NCDs and injuries account for an
estimated 62% of the total age standardized burden of forgone
Disability Adjusted Life Years (DALYs) in India [8].
Several environmental as well as socio-economic and demo-
graphic factors are associated with increased risk of overweight
and obesity. Age, gender, socio-economic condition, and urban-
rural residence are associated with overweight and obesity [9­11].
Overweight/obesity are found to be associated with increasing age
and female gender [9­11]. The other factors that are associated

with obesity are urbanization, changing lifestyles, low physical
activity, and high calorie intake [12­15]. The evidence on
association between such factors and obesity in BRICS countries
primarily comes from small-scale studies. Moreover, the spread of
these risk factors in BRICS countries is relatively less known. In
addition, we do not know if all of these factors increase the risk of
overweight and obesity in different settings.
Obesity is known to contribute to a variety of health conditions.
Studies have shown a significant association between obesity and
major health risks such as diabetes, high blood pressure, high
cholesterol levels, asthma and arthritis [16,17]. To our knowledge,
there is only one study that has examined the linkage between
obesity and hypertension in four of the five BRICS countries [18].
We came across two studies from India [19,20], four studies from
China [21­24], one study from South Africa [25], and two studies
from Russia [26,27] that have examined the association between
obesity and hypertension/heart disease and have found a
significant positive association between them. With reference to
studies on obesity and diabetes, we came across three studies only
from China [21,23,24]. The association between obesity and
stroke was examined in a study conducted in China [21], which
reported that the obese were more likely to suffer from stroke than
normal respondents. Likewise, the association between obesity and
arthritis was examined only in a study conducted in rural Russia
[26]. It is important to note that, except for Basu & Millett (2013)
and Peltzer & Phaswana-Mafuya (2013) [18,25], all the studies
listed above were either based on small-scale datasets (and hence
are not representative at the national level) or referred to specific
population subgroups. Also, we did not come across any large
scale study that examined the association between obesity and
depression in these countries.
In view of the issues discussed earlier, the aim of our study is to
examine the extent of overweight and obesity in four of the five
BRICS countries, namely India, China, South Africa, and Russia.
Another aim of the study is to identify the most important factors
associated with the increased risk of overweight and obesity in
each of these countries. In addition, we examine the association
between obesity and selected morbidities ­ hypertension, diabetes,
angina, stroke, arthritis, and depression. Our study is likely to
provide more robust and comparable evidence on the association
between obesity and selected morbidities in these countries.
Methods
Ethics Statement
The study is based on a secondary data set with no identifiable
information on the survey participants. This dataset is available in
the public domain for research use and hence no formal approval
from the institutional review board is required. So, no ethics
statement is required for this work. The data can be freely accessed
from the WHO website http://apps.who.int/healthinfo/systems/
surveydata/index.php/catalog.
Data
The present study uses data from the Study on Global Ageing
and Adult Health (SAGE) surveys implemented by WHO in six
countries ­China, India, Ghana, Mexico, Russia and South Africa
­ during 2007­2010. The target population in the SAGE survey is
adults, 18 years and older. A multistage stratified clustered sample
design was used uniformly in all the countries included in the
SAGE. SAGE collected information about self­reported morbid-
ities and health conditions based on interview and health

measurement, anthropometric measurements and blood tests [28].
Since our analysis is restricted to BRICS countries, we included
China, India, Russia and South Africa in the analysis. Brazil could
not be included in our analysis because the SAGE survey was not
conducted in Brazil. SAGE interviewed 11,230 adults (18 years or
older) in India, 14,811 in China, 4,225 in South Africa, and 4,335
in Russia [28]. Adults for whom weight and height measurements
were not available were excluded from the analysis. Hence, the
final sample for the analysis was 10,915 for India, 13,898 for
China, 3,889 for Russia, and 3,994 for South Africa.
Variables
In this study, body mass index (BMI) is taken as an indicator of
obesity, calculated as weight in kilograms divided by the square of
height in meters. Measured weight and height are used to calculate
BMI. Respondents are classified as Underweight (BMI ,18.5),
Normal (18.5#BMI,25), Overweight (25#BMI,30) and Obese
(BMI$30) [29].
The inclusion of morbidities in our analysis is based on two
criteria ­ first, the morbidities must be influenced by obesity; and
second, information on the morbidities was collected by the SAGE
survey. Accordingly, we included hypertension, diabetes, angina,
stroke, arthritis, and depression in our analysis. The SAGE survey
collected three readings each of systolic and diastolic measures of
blood pressure. Any respondent whose systolic measure was 140 or
more or whose diastolic measure was 90 or more was coded as
`suffering from hypertension'. In addition, any respondent who
reported as ever been diagnosed with hypertension was also coded
as `suffering from hypertension'. The rest were coded as `not
suffering from hypertension'. These cut-offs for hypertension have
been recommended and used in a number of studies
[19,28,30,31].
For the remaining five morbidities, we used self-reports to code
respondents as those having or not having morbidities. The
following questions were used to address the remaining five
morbidities:
1. Have you ever been diagnosed with diabetes (high blood
sugar)? (Yes, No)
2. Have you ever been diagnosed with angina or angina pectoris
(a heart disease)? (Yes, No)
3. Have you ever been told by a health professional that you have
had a stroke? (Yes, No)
4. Have you ever been diagnosed with/told you have arthritis (or
by other names rheumatism or osteoarthritis)? (Yes, No)
5. Have you ever been diagnosed with depression? (Yes, No)
All the morbidities were coded into dummy variables. For
example, those reporting `yes' to diabetes were coded as `1' and
others were coded as `0'.
Since BMI and selected morbidities are known to be affected by
other risk factors, several individual and lifestyle factors have been
included in the analysis. The variables included in the analysis are:
age, gender, schooling, wealth quintiles, place of residence, current
smoking status, current alcohol use, and engaged in work that
involves physical activity. The wealth quintiles, which are already
computed in the SAGE, were generated through a principal
components analysis conducted on a set of variables based on the
ownership of household assets [32­35].
We identified respondents engaged in work that involved
physical activity using the following two questions:
1. Does your work involve any type of vigorous-intensity activity
that causes large increases in breathing or heart rate [like heavy

2. Does your work involve any type of moderate-intensity activity
that causes small increases in breathing or heart rate [such as
brisk walking, carrying light loads, cleaning, cooking, or
washing clothes] for at least 10 minutes continuously? (Yes, No)
Respondents who reported `yes' to any of the two questions
were coded as `1' and the rest were coded as `0'.
Two community level variables - percentage of educated
respondents in each community and average monthly household
expenditure per community - were also included in the analysis.
Statistical Analysis
Bivariate and multivariate analyses have been used to fulfill the
objectives of the paper. Since BMI had four categories (under-
weight, normal, overweight and obese), we used multinomial
logistic regression analysis to examine the factors associated with
overweight and obesity. As the selected morbidities were coded as
dummy variables, two level random intercept logit models with
respondents (level 1) nested within communities (level 2) were
fitted to examine the association of obesity with selected
morbidities. Appropriate sampling weights were used to control
for the complex survey design of the SAGE. Sampling weights are
given in the SAGE dataset (See the SAGE reports for details of
sampling weight). The analysis presented in the paper was
conducted in STATA 12.0.
Results
The percentage distribution of sample by selected characteristics
is shown in Table 1. Among the four countries analyzed, smoking
was highest in India (42%) and lowest in Russia (27%). In
comparison, drinking alcohol was highest in Russia (41%) and
lowest in India (7%). More than three-fourths of the respondents
in India and Russia reported that they were engaged in work that
involved physical activity. Engagement in work that involved
physical activity was reported least in South Africa (52%). Only
24% of the respondents from India and South Africa were 50
years or older. This compares with 36% in China and 40% in
Russia. Higher education was more common in the Russian
sample; about 86% of the respondents reported that they had high
school education or more. This percentage was 24% in India, 27%
in China and 28% in South Africa. Rural-urban residence varied
considerably across the countries. The percent urban ranged
between as low as 31% in the Indian sample to as high as 73% in
the Russian sample.
The prevalence of overweight and obesity in the four countries
is shown in Figure 1. The percentage of respondents who were
overweight ranged between as low as 9% in India and as high as
36% in Russia. Similarly, the percentage of respondents who were
obese ranged between 3% in India and 35% in South Africa.
Nearly 5% and 22% of the respondents in China and Russia
respectively, were obese.
In multinomial logistic regression, age was associated with
overweight and obesity in India, China and Russia (Table 2). 50

years or older respondents were 1.2­2.4 times as likely as
respondents below 50 years of age to be overweight than being
normal. Likewise, 50 years or older respondents were 1.5­3.7
times as likely as respondents below 50 years of age to be obese
than being normal. Gender was statistically associated with
overweight and obesity in India and South Africa. In Russia and
China, gender was only associated with obesity. Females, when
compared to males, were more likely to be overweight or obese
than normal in India and South Africa. In Russia and China,
females, when compared to males, were more likely to be obese
than normal. Wealth was statistically associated with overweight in
India and China. However, wealth was not associated with obesity
in any of the countries. Similarly, no association was found
between educational level and overweight/obesity.
Smoking was also associated with both overweight and obesity
in China, South Africa and Russia (Table 2). Smokers were less
likely than non-smokers to be either overweight (odds ratio: 0.58­
0.68) or obese (odds ratio: 0.42­0.75) than normal. Drinking
alcohol was associated with overweight and obesity in China and
South Africa. While engaging in work that involved physical
activity was associated with both overweight and obesity in China,
it was associated only with obesity in South Africa. Respondents
whose work involved physical activity were less likely to be obese
than respondents whose work did not involve physical activity in
these countries (Odds ratio for China ­0.83; Odds ratio for South
Africa ­0.76).
Table 3 shows the prevalence of selected morbidities in India,
China, South Africa and Russia. The prevalence of hypertension
was highest in South Africa (51%) and lowest in India (26%). The
prevalence of diabetes ranged between 3% in India and China to
4% in Russia. Nearly 16% of the respondents in Russia reported
angina compared to only 3%-4% in India, China and South
Africa. Of the four countries considered in the analysis, the
prevalence of arthritis was the highest in Russia (19%) and the
least in South Africa (8%). The prevalence of depression ranged
between 0.4% in China and 5% in South Africa.
Results, adjusted for selected demographic, socioeconomic,
lifestyle and residence related characteristics, suggest that obesity

was associated with arthritis, hypertension, diabetes, and angina in
China, Russia and South Africa (Table 4). Obese respondents
were 1.4­2.5 times as likely as normal respondents to report
arthritis in these countries. Likewise, obese respondents were 1.9­
3.5 times as likely as normal respondents to have hypertension.
Similarly, obese respondents were 2.1­3.0 times more likely to
report diabetes than the normal respondents. Obese were also
more likely to report angina than normal respondents. In India,
obesity was only associated with hypertension and diabetes ­ obese
respondents were significantly more likely than the normal
respondents to have hypertension or diabetes. Obesity was not
associated with either stroke or depression in any of the selected
countries.
Like obesity, overweight was also associated with hypertension
and diabetes in all the four selected countries. Overweight
respondents were 1.5­2.1 times more likely than normal
respondents to report hypertension. Likewise, overweight respon-
dents were 1.5­1.9 times more likely than normal respondents to
report diabetes. The association between overweight and arthritis
was significant in India, China and South Africa (odds ratio: 1.5,
1.2 and 1.5 in India, China and South Africa respectively). Around
0.2% - 42% of residual variation in the chances of suffering from
selected morbidities in selected countries was attributable to
differences in the community characteristics.
Discussion
Overweight and obesity varied considerably across four of the
five BRICS countries included in the analysis. The percentage
overweight ranged between as low as 9% in India to as high as
37% in Russia. The percentage of obese ranged between as low as
3% in India to as high as 35% in South Africa. The prevalence of
selected morbidities also varied considerably across the four
countries. The prevalence of hypertension, angina, stroke and
diabetes were considerably higher in Russia compared to the other
three countries included in the analysis. To account for the
differences in the age-structure of the sampled respondents in four
countries, we also estimated age-standardized prevalence for
selected morbidities in each country. The age-standardized rates
also suggested a considerably high burden of hypertension, angina,
stroke and diabetes in Russia compared to the other three
countries (results not shown).
Overweight/obesity was found to be associated with hyperten-
sion and diabetes in all the four countries. Our findings confirm
the findings of the three small-scale studies conducted on a similar
topic in China [21,23,24]. Obese respondents were also more
likely to report arthritis in China, South Africa and Russia. In
contrast to our findings, Kalichman et al. (2006) found no
association between obesity and arthritis in rural Russia [26].
Angina was also more likely to be reported by obese respondents
in China, South Africa and Russia. Unlike earlier studies, stroke
was not associated with overweight/obesity in our study. The
relationship between overweight/obesity and stroke might get
affected by the way in which information was collected about
stroke in the SAGE. The question on stroke in the SAGE did not
distinguish between ischemic stroke and hemorrhagic stroke. A
recent meta-analysis of prospective studies found increased risk of
ischemic stroke in both overweight and obese individuals [36].
Hemorrhagic stroke however was not related to overweight/
obesity. Depression was also not associated with overweight/
obesity in our study.
One of the strengths of the SAGE survey is that it also allows for
estimation of symptom based prevalence of selected morbidities
such as angina, arthritis and depression. To examine whether the
association between overweight/obesity and these morbidities is
robust, we also estimated binary logistic regressions using symptom
based prevalence as the dependent variable. The associations of
overweight/obesity with arthritis and depression were similar to
those obtained in self-reported prevalence. When we used the
symptom based prevalence of angina, the association between
overweight/obesity and angina became statistically significant
even in India (results not shown). In India, the relationship
between overweight/obesity and angina, in self-reported diagnosis,
might get affected by the biases related to health system access.
Self-reported diagnoses could reflect systematic over or under
reporting of NCDs due to biases related to health system access
[37].
The strengths and limitations of our study must be noted. One
of the strengths of our study is the use of a large-scale population
based dataset for examining the consequences of overweight/
obesity in four of the five BRICS countries. Our study, perhaps for
the first time, has provided robust and comparable evidence on the
association between overweight/obesity and selected morbidities
in BRICS countries. The large sample sizes allowed us to control
for a number of pertinent covariates in the multivariate statistical
models. The limitations of our study are that our study only
establishes an association between overweight/obesity and selected
morbidities and does not provide any evidence for causality.
Second, the choice of control variables was limited to only those
variables that were available for each of the four countries
considered in the analysis.
To conclude, overweight/obesity was found to be an important
risk factor for hypertension, angina, diabetes and arthritis. It is
thus important that public health programs focus their attention
towards the growing epidemic of obesity before it reaches alarming
levels. Interestingly, obesity is preventable [2]. Obesity prevention
policies should focus on facilitating key behaviors like choosing
healthier food, limiting unhealthy food, increasing physical
activity, improving sleep, reducing stress, etc. (http://www.hsph.
harvard.edu/obesity-prevention-source/obesity-prevention). To
achieve these, action is needed at multiple levels ­ from
governments and industries, communities and neighborhoods,
schools and workplaces, and individual and families [38­40]. For
example, to curb consumption of sugary drinks, governments
could levy heavy taxes. A recent Indian study has shown that
sustained high tax rates on sugar-sweetened beverages could
mitigate rising obesity and type-2 diabetes [18]. Schools can
increase the recess time and promote dietary education and
physical activity. Although evidence on how to prevent obesity is
growing, there is a dearth of obesity prevention studies in low- and
middle-income countries [41]. Hence future studies must examine
the impact of obesity prevention strategies in low- and middle-
income countries.
