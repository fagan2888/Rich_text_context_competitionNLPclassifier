Pressure and Disability in Older Adults

Abstract--The objective of this study was to investigate the association between blood pressure and disability in older
adults. Stroke-free participants in the Charleston Heart Study (n999, mean age68.5 0.2 years SE, 57% women, and
39% African Americans) were followed between 1960 and 1993. Functional measures including Nagi's Congruency in
Medical and Self Assessment of Disability Scale, the Rosow-Breslaw Scale, and Katz' Activities of Daily Living Scale,
in addition to systolic and diastolic blood pressures, were collected in 1984­1985, 1987­1990, and 1990­1993.
Additional systolic and diastolic blood pressures from 1960 to 1963 were also available. We defined remote blood
pressure change as the change from 1960 to 1984 to 1985 and concurrent blood pressure change as the change from 1984
to 1985 to the follow-up periods. Hypertension was defined as blood pressure 140/90 mm Hg or receiving
antihypertensive agents, and it was considered uncontrolled if subjects were receiving antihypertensive agents and blood
pressure was 140/90 mm Hg. Greater increases in remote and concurrent systolic blood pressure increases but not
diastolic blood pressure were associated with greater declines in all 3 of the functional measures. Participants with
hypertension were also at an increased risk for developing new disability (hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.04 to 1.59 for
Nagi scale; hazard ratio: 1.28, 95% CI: 1.02 to 1.59 for Rosow-Breslaw Scale; and hazard ratio: 1.3, 95% CI: 1.01 to
1.69 for Katz scale). Participants with uncontrolled hypertension were at greatest risk of disability compared with
normotensive subjects. In stroke-free older adults, increases in remote and concurrent systolic blood pressure increases
are associated with greater functional decline. Older adults with uncontrolled hypertension are at a particularly increased
risk for disability. (Hypertension. 2007;50:1026-1032.)
Key Words: hypertension  disability  blood pressure  aged  Southeast
More than 50% of people 65 years of age in the United
States have limitation in 1 functional activity. Previ-
ous longitudinal studies have suggested that stroke is associ-
ated with increased risk for disability and loss of indepen-
dence in older individuals.1­3 For example, in the
Framingham Disability Study, stroke was the strongest pre-
dictor of physical disability and explained 12% of the
variance over the follow-up period in men.4 The independent
relationship between blood pressure (BP) or hypertension and
disability risk in stroke-free individuals is not known. This is
especially important because 65% of older adults in the
United States have hypertension.5 Furthermore, the Framing-
ham population is predominantly white, whereas African
American elderly individuals are more likely to report limi-
tations in activities of daily living (ADL)6 and more likely to
have hypertension.5 Therefore, investigating the relationship
between BP and disability in a well-represented biracial
population fills an important gap in our knowledge. Finally,
the impact of BP on health takes a lengthy period of time.
Therefore, it is important to consider BP years before indi-
viduals start showing evidence of functional decline and
disability.
Controlling hypertension to 140/90 mm Hg is associated
with reduced cardiovascular disease mortality and morbidity
in older adults.7 Investigating the association between hyper-
tension control status and disability has important clinical
implications, because there are concerns that lowering BP
may have a negative effect on function and quality of life in
older adults.8
Therefore, the primary objective of this study was to
investigate the association of BP and hypertension with the
rate of functional decline and the risk of disability in an aging
biracial population. The second objective was to explore the
relation between hypertension control status and these dis-
ability domains.
Methods
Sample
A primary rationale for selecting the Charleston Heart Study was its
adequate representation of African Americans. Also, we were
interested in a study that includes remote BP data before the
functional measures. The Charleston Heart Study fits these criteria.
Participants were recruited from the community of greater Charles-
ton in 1960. For this analysis, we included data collected during 3

measurement waves: 1984­1985, 1987­1990, and 1990­1993. We
included participants who have available functional and BP data and
excluded those with stroke at baseline and follow-up. Stroke data
were collected using self-report. Of the 1040 participants evaluated
in 1984­1985, 38 had stroke and 3 had missing data, leaving 999
available for this analysis. Of these, 978 (98%) were evaluated in
1987­1990 and 916 (92%) in 1990­1993. An additional 39 individ-
uals developed stroke during the follow-up period (1984­1993) and
were also excluded. In addition, BP and antihypertensive data 20
years before the 1984 wave were available on our selected sample.
The institutional review board at Hebrew SeniorLife approved this
analysis. All of the participants signed written consents.
Data Elements
Data collected included demographics, weight, height, and social
elements (educational level, marital status, retirement status, access to
health care, and alcohol and tobacco use). Self-reported comorbidity
data were collected by an interview questionnaire, and a medication
inventory was also performed. Cognitive function was assessed using
the Short Portable Mini Mental Examination starting in the 1987­1990
wave.9 Mood was assessed using the Centre for Epidemiological Studies
Depression Scale10 collected only in 1990­1993.
Two BP measurements were obtained using a mercury manometer
at each visit by a trained observer. The observers underwent repeated
audiometric examinations. The participant was in a seated position,
and an appropriate size cuff was used. The cuff was placed at heart
level, and each reading was rounded to the nearest 2 mm Hg.
Systolic BP (SBP) was defined as the first Korotkoff sound (K1) and
diastolic (DBP) as the fifth Korotkoff sound (K5).11 For this analysis,
we used the mean of the 2 readings.
BP Predictors
Our main predictors were SBP and DBP, considered as continuous
variables. Because BP changed over the study period, as well as
between 1960 and 1984­1985, we designed our analysis to account for
the change in BP. We defined 2 BP variables, as follows. Concurrent BP
change is the variable reflected the change in SBP and DBP from the
baseline measurement (1984­1985) to the follow-up periods (1987­
1990 and 1990­1993). This was the concurrent change in BP measured
at the same time as the outcome measures. Remote BP change is the
variable that reflected the change in SBP and DBP from 1960 to the
baseline measurements (1984­1985).
Because some participants were receiving antihypertensive agents
during the period of BP measurement, these readings may not reflect
the participants' actual BP.12 To address this issue, we have used a
method suggested by Cui et al12 and confirmed by Tobin et al13 of
adding 10 mm Hg to SBP and 5 mm Hg to DBP in subjects receiving
antihypertensive medications during each data collection visit for
the BP analysis only. Please see http://hyper.ahajournals.org for an
expanded Methods section and the Results section for the BP
analysis without the treatment correction (Table S2).
Hypertension Predictors
We also defined hypertension status and control status at baseline
(1984­1985) as predictor variables. We assigned each participant to
1 of 2 groups: normotensive if the mean BP was 140/90 mm Hg
and the subject was not receiving antihypertensive medications or
hypertensive if the mean BP was 140/90 mm Hg or if the subject
was receiving antihypertensive medications. We further assigned
hypertensive individuals to 2 groups: controlled hypertensive if the
mean BP was 140/90 mm Hg with treatment and uncontrolled
hypertensive if the mean BP was 140/90 mm Hg.
To study the association of hypertension status with disability, we
compared normotensive subjects with hypertensive subjects. To
study the association between control status and disability, we
compared controlled and uncontrolled hypertensive subjects with
normotensive and uncontrolled to controlled hypertensive subjects.
Functional (Outcome) Measures
Measures of disability and daily function were collected in 1984­
1985, 1987­1990, and 1990­1999 using 3 standard scales: the
Nagi's Congruency in Medical and Self Assessment of Disability,14
the Rosow-Breslaw Scale15 and Katz' ADL Scale.16 We considered
these measures of disability in this analysis in 2 ways: as continuous
variables to investigate the rate of change in functional abilities and
as categorical variables to investigate the risk of developing new
disability (a participant is disabled if the participant reported limi-
tation in performing 1 activity on the corresponding scale).
Statistical Analysis
BP Analysis
We used linear mixed-effects models (PROC Mixed) for correlated
data to investigate the association between SBP and DBP with
disability.17,18 This procedure is less sensitive to missing data, allows
us to model the change in predictors and covariates during the
follow-up period, and calculates estimates of the functional measures
at each visit adjusted for covariates.19 We first conducted univariate
analyses by investigating the association between concurrent BP
changes (independent variables) with functional measures as contin-
uous variables (dependent variables). We then performed multivar-
iate analyses by developing a mixed model for each outcome
measure. The modeling process is provided in the online supplemen-
tal data. For these analyses, we present the rate of change in the
specific disability scale for each 10-mm Hg BP increase obtained
from the final models.
Hypertension Analysis
For the comparison between hypertensive and normotensive subjects
and the comparison of the normotensive, controlled hypertensive,
and uncontrolled hypertensive subjects, we also used linear
mixed-effects models. We also conducted univariate and multi-
variate analyses as in the BP analysis with hypertension status or
control status as the independent variables and the functional
measures as the dependent variables included as continuous
variables. We present the results including P values and least mean
squares adjusted for the covariates from these models.
Risk of Developing Disability Analysis
Proportional hazard models20 were used to study the association
between hypertension status and control status with the risk of
developing disability. These models were developed using a step-
wise model selection approach (forward/backward). For this analy-
sis, the time variable was either the time to developing disability or
the time to censorship for the participants who were lost to follow-up
or who died. Proportional hazard model assumptions were met.
We also calculated the cumulative incidence of disability for the
follow-up period excluding those with disability at baseline (1984­
1985) and the fraction of disability in the study population attribut-
able to hypertension by calculating the population attributable risk
percentage. Attributable risk percentage is calculated by dividing
the attributable risk by the incidence of disability in the study
population.
Covariates and Subgroup Interaction Analyses
For all of the analyses, covariates considered for model selection
included age, gender, race, educational level, body mass index,
baseline disability measures, alcohol, smoking status, and comorbid-
ity (coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, subsequent
stroke, diabetes mellitus, peripheral vascular disease, and arthritis).
Finally we tested for relevant interaction by age, gender, race, body
mass index (BMI), and comorbidities. All of the analyses were
conducted using SAS Software.
Results
Sample
The mean ageSE of the sample (n999) at baseline was
68.50.2 years, 57% were women, and 39% were African
Hajjar et al Hypertension and Disability 1027
Americans. Among these, 699 (70%) were hypertensive and
413 (59%) of the hypertensive subjects were receiving
antihypertensive medications. Only 146 (21%) were con-
trolled to 140/90 mm Hg. The control rates remained
constant through the study follow-up (20% in 1987­1990 and
21% in 1990­1993).
Table 1 describes baseline characteristics of our sample.
Hypertensive participants were older, more likely to be African
Americans, had higher BMI, reported fewer years of education,
and had lower physical activity levels. Hypertensive subjects
reported higher prevalence of diabetes mellitus and arthritis than
normotensive subjects. There were no differences in cardiovas-
cular disease or cognitive function between hypertensive and
normotensive subjects (Table 1). At baseline in 1984­1985,
hypertensive participants scored lower than normotensive par-
ticipants on the Nagi scale. There was no difference in the scores
on the Rosow-Breslaw and Katz ADL scales. We provide a
similar comparison for the baseline characteristics among nor-
motensive subjects and controlled and uncontrolled hypertensive
subjects in Table S1.
BP Analysis
Table 2 describes the association between remote and con-
current BP change and the rate of functional measure change.
Greater remote SBP increase was associated with greater
decline rates in all 3 of the functional measures. Similarly,
greater concurrent SBP increase was associated with greater
decline rates in all 3 of the functional measures. This
remained true in the multivariate models. In contrast, remote
and concurrent DBP changes were not associated with any of
the outcome measures (Table 2). These results did not change
when we considered SBP and DBP without correction for
the effect of antihypertensive subjects (please see the data
supplement).
Hypertension Analysis
Compared with normotensive participants, hypertensive par-
ticipants demonstrated greater declines in all 3 of the func-
tional measures. This remained true in the multivariate
models after adjusting for potential confounders (Figure 1).

pants, hypertensive participants without baseline disability
were at increased risk of developing a new disability during
the follow-up period (Table 3). The attributable risk percent-
age of hypertension on disability was 15% for the Nagi scale,
36% for the Rosow-Breslaw Scale, and 22% for the Katz
ADL scale.
Participants with uncontrolled hypertension were at in-
creased risk of developing disability compared with normo-
tensive participants. However, those with controlled hyper-
tension, defined as BP 140/90 mm Hg with treatment, had
no significant difference in disability risk compared with
normotensive or uncontrolled hypertensive subjects (Table
3). This was true for all 3 of the functional measures.
Attributable risk percentage for uncontrolled hypertensive
participants compared with normotensive participants was
36% for the Nagi scale, 63% for the Rosow-Breslaw, and
25% for the Katz ADL.
Subgroup Interaction Analysis
Table 4 provides the results of Cox proportional hazard
models with an interaction term to test whether there was a
different association between hypertension and disability by
various subgroups. There was only a gender-based difference
in the association between hypertension and disability.
Women had a significantly increased risk of developing
disability from hypertension compared with men based on the
Rosow-Breslaw Scale and the Katz ADL scale but not the
Nagi scale (Table 4). There were no consistent differences in
the risk of developing disability from hypertension by age,
race, obesity, or other comorbidities.
Discussion
This study suggests that, in a biracial elderly population,
concurrent and remote SBP increases are associated with
greater rates of decline in functional abilities. In contrast,
neither remote nor concurrent DBP was associated with
functional declines. In addition, those with hypertension at
baseline have greater declines in functional abilities and are at
increased risk of developing a new disability compared with
normotensive individuals. Only those with uncontrolled hy-
pertension have greater declines in functional abilities and are
at increased disability risk.
Few previous studies have investigated the role of BP or
hypertension in developing disability.4,21 Hubert and Fries22
identified hypertension as 1 risk of an array of factors for the
development of disability over a period of 6 years in a group
of 407 members of a runners club. In the Framingham
Disability Study, hypertension was associated with an in-
creased risk of disability.3 The populations in both studies
were predominantly whites, and, hence, generalizability is
limited. Our study extends these findings to a sample that,
unlike the Framingham study, adequately represented African
Americans. Moreover, none of the previous studies investi-
gated the roles of SBP and DBP measured during the study
period or remotely before the development of disability on
the rate functional loss in an elderly population. Our analysis
suggests that SBP plays a role in the loss of function, but DBP
does not. This is in agreement with previous evidence
suggesting that SBP is a better predictor of future cardiovas-
cular and cerebrovascular disease in elderly individuals than

DBP.23 Nevertheless, hypertensive subjects as a group are at
increased risk of both functional decline and developing a
new disability.
This analysis suggests that those with uncontrolled hyper-
tension had an increased risk of incident disability, whereas
those with controlled hypertension had a similar incident
disability as those without hypertension. The lack of associ-
ation between controlled hypertension and disability risk
suggests that adequate control of hypertension may prevent
functional decline. However, this could also be related to the
small sample size of those with controlled hypertension.
These findings should be interpreted cautiously and need to
be replicated in other studies with larger samples.
Women are more likely to develop disability compared
with men.24,25 In this study we found that, compared with
men, women are particularly at an increased risk of develop-
ing disability from hypertension. Because hypertension is
more prevalent in women,5 this may provide a possible
explanation for the increased predisposition to disability in
women.
The development of disability with aging is a complex
process and involves interactions between the individual's
abilities and the surrounding environment.26 Contrary to
previous thought that disability was because of disabling
medical illnesses, recent literature emphasizes a conceptual
difference between comorbidity and disability.27 We found an
association between hypertension and measures of disability,
which was robust to adjustment for self-reported relevant
comorbidities including diabetes mellitus, cardiovascular dis-
ease, and arthritis. The mechanisms by which hypertension
may produce disability are not known. It is possible that
hypertension may lead to disability through its effect on white
matter hyperintensities in the brain,28 cerebrovascular func-
tion,29 overall lean muscle mass,30,31 inflammation, or
changes in the renin angiotensin system.32,33 It also could be
mediated through the effect of hypertension on cognitive
function not assessed in the Charleston Heart Study, such as
executive function34 or fluid intellectual functioning.35 Fur-
ther studies to explore these possible mechanisms are needed.
An advantage of our study population is the low rate of
hypertension control, which enabled us to assess the associ-
ation between uncontrolled hypertension and disability. Also,
the sample had close to 40% Southeastern African Ameri-
cans, who were underrepresented in previous studies.
A limitation of our study is that our sample was not
disability free at baseline. We conducted 2 analyses: 1
investigating the rate of functional decline and the second
investigating the risk of developing a new disability in those
without disability at baseline. Both approaches lead to similar
results. Another limitation is that all of the functional mea-
sures were self-reported. These measures have been widely
used for assessing disability in the general population. Fur-
thermore, comorbidity assessment was conducted using self-
report via an interview. In particular, there was no further
objective confirmation for the diagnosis of stroke. Although
this method has been validated for stroke diagnosis,36 our
results should be interpreted cautiously. Also, measures of
cognitive function and mood were not conducted except in
the later period of the study. Because BP and disability are
related to both, interpretation of our results should take this
into consideration.
Higher concurrent and 20 years' previous SBP increases
are associated with an increased rate of functional decline
in older adults. In addition, those with hypertension,
particularly uncontrolled hypertension, have a significant
increase in disability risk independent of other risk factors
or comorbidities.
Perspectives
This study suggests an association between elevated SBP and
hypertension with disability in older adults. Considering that
65% of the elderly population has hypertension and that 71%
of them have uncontrolled hypertension, it is contributing
significantly to disability and to healthcare expenditure in the

CVD indicates cardiovascular disease (myocardial infarction, angina, stroke,
or peripheral vascular disease).
*These hazard ratios are testing the hypothesis that there is a difference in
the association between hypertension and disability risk by the corresponding
subgroup. It calculates the additional risk in that subgroup compared with the
reference group. For example, the risk of disability based on the Rosow-
Breslaw Scale associated with hypertension in women is 1.8 times that in men.

United States. Further investigation on the underlying mech-
anism of this association and clinical trials to test the effect of
controlling hypertension on disability are essential future
research areas.
