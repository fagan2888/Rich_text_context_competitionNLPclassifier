Gene-Behavior Interactions and Obesity
1Department of Kinesiology, The University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, USA. Correspondence: Rod K. Dishman (rdishman@uga.edu)
The brain controls behavior in widely varying environmental
circumstances. This control includes conscious decisions and
less conscious drives or urges that are influenced by inherent
and acquired traits, each of which are shaped by learning and
memories of reinforcement history, by genes and by devel-
opmental, social, and environmental factors that alter gene
expression. Brain neural circuits that regulate feeding, mood,
pleasure, pain, memories about the reward and punishment of
behavior, and cognitions such as liking, wanting, and decision
making for appetitive behaviors have been elaborated (1­4).
In contrast, little is known about how genes, the environ-
ment, and their interactions influence the brain's regulation of

physical activity behavior.
Family and twin studies have reported that 30­70% of the
variation in human physical activity is inherited (5­8), and a
few association and linkage studies have implicated candidate
genes that might explain small, but significant, portions of that
variation (9). Features of this small literature suggest that four
key issues be addressed during the search for gene­environ-
ment interactions that affect physical activity behavior: (i) the
need to exploit and elaborate current understanding of puta-
tive mediators and moderators of voluntary physical activity,
(ii) selection of candidate genes, (iii) measurement of physi-
cal activity, and (iv) multilevel statistical modeling of personal,
environmental, and genetic influences on physical activity
change across time.
Mediators and Moderators of Physical Activity
Although emerging animal and human studies suggest that
genetic variation explains a substantial amount of physical
activity, most of the variation in physical activity will be ulti-
mately determined by personal choices and environmental
opportunities or their interactions. Studies have not yet exam-
ined whether genetic variation in physical activity (i) occurs
independently of putative mediators and moderators of physi-
cal activity, (ii) modifies (i.e., interacts with) the association
of physical activity with those factors, or (iii) is explainable by
common genetic variation in physical activity and select medi-
ators or moderators (e.g., pleiotropic effects).
About 50 different behavioral correlates of physical activ-
ity have been reported among youths and adults (10,11).
Putative moderators and mediators of interventions designed
to increase physical activity include personal factors that influ-
ence decisions to be active, such as self-efficacy, perceived
behavioral control, attitude, enjoyment, social norms, and
perceptions of social support and access to physical activ-
ity settings. Personality appears to be weakly associated with
physical activity (12,13), but it plausibly could influence spon-
taneous physical activity or moderate and help explain gene­
environment influences on exercise behavior. In addition, real
and perceived features of social and physical environments
operate at the levels of families, schools, places of employment,
and neighborhoods, which are all located within communities,
to influence physical activity. Figure 1 illustrates these theo-
rized relations and interactions.
Social-cognitive variables (i.e., beliefs that are formed by
social learning and reinforcement history) are influences
on self-initiated change in health behaviors such as physical
activity (14). Self-efficacy is a belief in personal capabilities to
organize and execute the courses of action required to attain a
Gene­Physical Activity Interactions in the
Etiology of Obesity: Behavioral Considerations
Rod K. Dishman1
Understanding how genes, environment, and personal motivation operate to influence physical activity will require
(i) inclusion of properly validated measures of putative mediators (e.g., cultural values, efficacy and control beliefs,
goals, intentions, enjoyment, and self-management skills) and moderators (e.g., age or maturation, personality, race/
ethnicity, fitness, fatness, skill, and competing behaviors) of physical activity, (ii) a search for candidate genes involved
with motivational systems of energy expenditure in addition to energy intake pathways, (iii) assessment of specific
features physical activity exposure (i.e., type, intensity, timing, and context), (iv) manipulation of physical activity or
prospective observation of change in physical activity at multiple times, rather than cross-sectional association and
linkage studies, and (v) use of statistical procedures that permit multilevel modeling (i.e., personal and group-level
variables) of direct, indirect (i.e., mediated), and moderated (i.e., interactions of mediators with external factors)
relations with physical activity within theoretical gene­environment networks.

perceived access and actual proximity to physical activity set-
tings have direct relations with physical activity and/or indirect
relations moderated or mediated by social-cognitive factors
such as social support and efficacy beliefs about overcoming
barriers to physical activity has not been determined. Although
social networks may link physical activity habits in ways simi-
lar to those hypothesized for obesity (19), it is also possible that
social affiliations have, to some extent, a genetic basis. Hence,
genes might commonly influence features of both social affili-
ation and physical activity.
Candidate Genes
Like obesity, physical activity surely represents a complex,
multifactorial trait influenced mainly by polygenes that each
explain small portions (~1%) of the variance in physical activ-
ity. However, in contrast to the literature on obesity in which
at least 22 genes have been supported by at least five studies
(20), less than 10 association studies (9) and two linkage stud-
ies (21,22) have examined candidate genes for physical activity,
without much replication of results.
Most candidate genes for physical activity suggested by link-
age or association studies have been selected for study based
on understanding of energy intake pathways that influence
energy balance (e.g., LEPR, AGRP, MC4R) (9,22) more so than
models of otherwise motivated behavior (21,23). However,
some genes that have been studied (e.g., DRD2, DRD4, SERT,
5-HT2A, 5-HT2C, Orexin A) might be involved in regulation
of motivation systems for both feeding and physical activity.
Evidence has been mixed as to whether alleles of SERT and
DRD4 genes explain variations in personality (e.g., novelty
seeking and extraversion) (e.g., 24­26), which plausibly could
explain a portion of leisure or spontaneous physical activity.
Neurobiological regulation of physical activity by the cen-
tral nervous system is poorly understood and has been mainly
studied in order to model opioid regulation of anorexigenic
running (27) and to understand central fatigue (i.e., a pro-
gressive decline in supraspinal motor drive to motor neurons)
during exhaustive exercise (28,29) and prolonged, strenu-
ous exercise under conditions of hypoxia, hyperthermia, and
hypoglycemia (28,30­32). Putative brain mechanisms include
increased brain serotonin activity, elevated ammonia levels,
brain glycogen depletion, decreased striatal dopamine (DA),
and inhibitory feedback from the exercising muscles.
In contrast to the study of factors that limit skeletal muscle
control of locomotion under conditions of impairment, the
neurobiological regulation of voluntary, nonstrenuous physical
behavioral goal. Like self-efficacy, perceived behavioral control
includes efficacy beliefs about internal factors (e.g., skills, abili-
ties, and self-motivation or willpower) and external factors
(e.g., time, opportunity, obstacles, and dependence on other
people) that are imposed on behavior. Each construct is dis-
tinguishable from outcome expectancy, which is the perceived
likelihood that performing a behavior will result in a specific
outcome. Although people are more likely to form an inten-
tion to behave when they value an expected outcome of the
behavior (i.e., they have a positive attitude), that likelihood is
increased when a goal is set. People who set goals about being
more active and who are dissatisfied with their current activity
level will be more likely to adopt physical activity, especially if
they possess high self-efficacy about their ability to be physi-
cally active (15). Like perceived behavioral control, self-effi-
cacy affects behavior directly and also indirectly by influencing
intentions. Efficacy beliefs can affect physical activity both
directly by fostering self-management (16) and indirectly by
influencing perceptions about sociocultural environments that
provide assistance for physical activity which in turn directly
influence physical activity (17). Self-efficacy can also moderate
the relation between perceptions of social facilitators and phys-
ical activity change. Thus, beliefs in personal ability to over-
come barriers to physical activity can sustain physical activity
despite perceptions of declining social support of physical
activity (18). Although beliefs are learned, genes might influ-
ence historical adaptations to exercise or success in physical
activity settings so that contemporary relations between genes
and physical activity might plausibly be explained by an inter-
action between genes, biological adaptability to exercise, and
beliefs. Figure 2 shows a hypothetical gene­physical activity
interaction whereby genes and people's exercise goals, or their
interaction, might explain exercise adherence directly, or indi-
rectly by influencing adaptability to exercise training.
Cross-sectional studies have found that self-reports and
objective measures from geographic information systems of
the social and built environments (e.g., neighborhood safety
and facility accessibility) are weak correlates of physical activ-
ity and overweight among population-based samples. Whether

neuropeptide orexin A stimulates both feeding and spontane-
ous physical activity in rats when it is injected into the lateral
hypothalamus (47,48). Neurons that contain orexin A project
from caudal hypothalamic areas throughout the neuroaxis and
appear to enhance spontaneous physical activity, in part by
inhibiting hypothalamic GABA release and stimulating or syn-
ergizing with DA signaling in the striatum (49) or by possibly
modulating GABA

inhibition of the accumbens (50). Orexin-
containing neurons in the VTA appear directly involved in opi-
oid-dependent appetitive behavior and increased locomotion
by activation of the meso-limbic dopamine pathway between
the VTA and the accumbens (51), possibly by potentiation of
glutamate-N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor­mediated
neurotransmission(52).Chronicactivitywheelrunningappears

response after open-field
locomotion (53) and has a neurotrophic effect in the VTA (54).
Wheel and treadmill running (55,56) also increase gene expres-
sion for brain galanin which helps regulate feeding and may
also play a role in modulation of the dopaminergic meso-limbic
system. Galanin expression is not sensitive to other forms of
stress, which can permanently upregulate expression of some
HPA axis genes (57), but possible epigenetic effects of physical
activity have not received much study.
Measurement of Physical Activity
Physical activity is bodily movement produced by contrac-
tion of skeletal muscles that results in varying amounts and
rates of energy expenditure that are positively related to physi-
cal fitness and health depending upon the stimulus features
of physical activity such as its type, intensity, regularity and
timing. Among humans, physical activity can be spontaneous
and sporadic (e.g., leisure play or fidgeting) or purposeful and
repetitive (e.g., jobs, chores, organized sports, or exercise per-
formed with the goal of improving or maintaining physical fit-
ness, function or health).
Most studies have used self-reports of physical activity.
Fewer, more recent studies have used standardized obser-
vational systems or objective monitoring by accelerometry
(e.g., 21). Although some self-report measures have been vali-
dated by demonstrating correlations with objective measures,
those correlations are typically modest, accounting for <30%
shared variance. Self-report measures of physical activity used
in observational, population-based association studies gener-
ally were designed to categorize or rank people according to
frequency of physical activity or total energy expenditure esti-
mated crudely by metabolic equivalents (i.e., METh) rather
than to assess specific features of physical activity such as type,
intensity, and timing that are important for understanding the
direction, effort, and persistence of human motivation. Self-
report measures of physical activity used in studies of human
gene cohorts have been too crude to distinguish spontaneous
physical activity (e.g., fidgeting or pacing about) from other lei-
sure or purposeful physical activities. Likewise, commonly used
objective measures of physical activity or energy expenditure do
not assess the type or setting of physical activity (e.g., acceler-
ometry) or any specific features of physical activity (e.g., energy
activity by healthy animals has received little study. The tight
relationship between increased body mass and decreased spon-
taneous activity levels among rats and mice, irrespective of fat
mass, has led to a hypothesis that a reduction in spontaneous
activity is a symptom of obesity (33), but how body mass might
be sensed to regulate voluntary physical activity is not known.
Reduced DA release or loss of DA receptors in brain appears
related to the age-related decline in physical activity observed
among many species (34). The meso-limbic (i.e., ventral teg-
mentum-nucleus accumbens) DA system is a critical com-
ponent of the forebrain circuitry that regulates activational
aspects of motivation (4) (Figure 3). Antagonists of DA and
depletion of DA in the accumbens cause rats to reallocate their
instrumental behavior away from food-reinforced tasks that
have high work requirements and toward the selection of less-
effortful types of food seeking (35), implicating DA brain cir-
cuitry in energy-related decision making.
Activation of neuronal activity in hypothalamic reward
regions during spontaneous locomotion by rats was estab-
lished 40 years ago (36,37), and electrical self-stimulation of
the ventral tegmental area (VTA) has been used to artificially
motivate treadmill running (38) and weight lifting (39) in rats.
However, little is known about the role of the meso-limbic DA
system in the motivation of voluntary physical activity such as
wheel running or other types of spontaneous physical activity
in home cages or novel open fields. Treadmill running acutely
increases DA release (40) and turnover (41) and chronically
upregulates D2 receptors (42) in the striatum of rats, but forced
treadmill running by rats and mice likely confounds exertion
with emotional stress and is thus a poor model of voluntary
physical activity.
Rats and mice have been selectively bred for running (43,44),
but genes that might help explain motivated running or other
spontaneous physical activity in rodents have yet to be identi-
fied (45). Nonetheless, early gene expression has been impli-
cated in voluntary wheel running. A recent study found that
c-fos and delta fosB in the nucleus accumbens were activated
during wheel running in rats, and mice that overexpress delta
fosB selectively in striatal dynorphin-containing neurons
increased their daily running compared with control litter
mates (46). Delta fosB could plausibly facilitate wheel run-
ning by inhibiting the release of dynorphin by GABA neurons,
which otherwise binds with kappa opioid receptors to inhibit
DA release in the VTA or accumbens (46). The hypothalamic

level to change physical activity across multiple points in time.
Such models require analytical methods that address inherently
complex features, such as (i) the multilevel nature of the data, (ii)
the analysis of change across time, (iii) hypothesis tests of inde-
pendent (i.e., direct), mediated (i.e., indirect), and moderated
(i.e., interactive) relations, (iv) the use of different data forms
including self-ratings, as well as objective measures of the physi-
cal and social environment, and (v) the need to demonstrate
equivalence of the measurement properties of several person-
level variables between age, race, and gender groups and within
each of those groups across time. Common statistical techniques
such as ANOVA and ordinary regression cannot fully address
these complexities. Advanced techniques such as structural
equation modeling and latent growth modeling provide preci-
sion for multilevel, theoretically derived analysis of mediated
change (66) in physical activity, as illustrated by Figure 5.
Summary
Understanding how genes, the environment, and personal moti-
vation operate to influence physical activity will be hindered by
a search for candidate genes predominantly restricted to energy
intake pathways, continued use of cross-sectional, univariate
association studies, failure to include measures of personality or
putative social-cognitive mediators and moderators of physical
activity, use of physical activity measures that are poorly vali-
dated or improperly applied according to context, and by scarce
use of statistical procedures that permit simultaneous estimates
ofdirectandindirectrelations/effectsbetweengenes,motivation,

physical activity should compare results using both subjective
and objective measures to enhance convergence of methods
and exploit their unique assessment features.
Similarly, physical activity studies of mice and rats have used
various types of physical activity that are uncorrelated and
have widely different behavioral interpretations depending
upon the setting. For example, voluntary wheel running seems
to represent a unique motivational system in rodents (58).
Mice selectively bred for higher velocity wheel running (42),
and rats selectively bred for higher treadmill running endur-
ance (59) each have high aerobic capacities, but the treadmill
running trait is unrelated to voluntary wheel running (60) and
neither running trait is associated with other types of sponta-
neous physical activity such as locomotion in the home-cage or
in a novel open field (61­63). Moreover, commonly used meas-
ures of spontaneous physical activity by rodents (e.g., home-
cage locomotion) used to mimic human nonexercise energy
expenditure (e.g., reference (64)) do not seem well suited for
understanding human motivation for either leisure play or pur-
poseful physical activities of daily living. Spontaneous physical
activity in cages or in an open field can be selectively bred as
a trait (65) and can model fear, anxiety, agitation, depression,
aggression, social dominance, or exploration, depending upon
the social and environmental conditions of observation.
