Clarifying the Association Between Mother­Father
Relationship Aggression and Parenting
Although much research examines the associ-
ation between fathers' relationship aggression
and mothers' parenting, little attention is given
to mothers' aggression, mutual aggression, or
fathers' parenting. Using a sample of core-
siding couples from the Fragile Families and
Child Wellbeing Study (N = 973), the authors
examine the association between mothers' and
fathers' relationship aggression, measured
as frequency and perpetration­victimization
types (mutual, mother only, father only), and
mothers' and fathers' parenting. Fixed effects
regression models show that fathers' aggres-
sion is positively related to mothers' parenting
stress, whereas father-only or mother-only
aggression is related to fathers' stress. For both
parents, aggression perpetration is negatively
related to their own engagement with children.
Mother-only aggression is negatively related
to mothers' spanking and positively related
to fathers' spanking. These findings suggest
the importance of examining both parents'
aggression and perpetrators' as well as victims'

parenting to better understand the link between
relationship aggression and parenting.
Much research has shown that there is an associ-
ation between mother­father relationship quality
and parenting (Carlson, Pilkauskas, McLanahan,
& Brooks-Gunn, 2011; Deater-Deckard, 2004;
Erel & Burman, 1995; Krishnakumar & Buehler,
2000). In particular, mother­father relationship
aggression--that is, mothers' and fathers' hos-
tile and controlling behavior toward each other,
verbal aggression, physical aggression, or both
(Cui, Durtschi, Donnellan, Lorenz, & Con-
ger, 2010; Schumacher & Leonard, 2005)--is
related to more parenting stress, defined as gen-
eral feelings of difficulty in the parenting role
(Levendosky, Leahy, Bogat, Davidson, & von
Eye, 2006; Owen, Thompson, & Kaslow, 2006;
Renner, 2009; Taylor, Lee, Guterman, & Rice,
2010), and more ineffective parenting practices,
such as less engagement with children, more
lax control, and greater harshness toward chil-
dren (Edleson, 1999; Holden & Ritchie, 1991;
Ritchie & Holden, 1998; Taylor, Guterman, Lee,
& Rathouz, 2009).
Despite a large volume of studies examining
the association between relationship aggres-
sion and parenting, three limitations cloud
the understanding of this association. First,
inadequate attention has been paid to possible
selection effects. That is, characteristics that
select parents into relationship aggression--for
example, mothers' and fathers' sociodemo-
graphic or personality characteristics--can also
shape parenting stress and practices. Without
eliminating such unobserved characteristics that
are related to both relationship aggression and
parenting stress and practices, prior research

might have overestimated the degree to which
mother­father relationship aggression per se is
related to parenting stress and practices. Sec-
ond, recent studies largely focused on fathers'
aggression and its consequences for mothers'
parenting stress and practices (e.g., Gustafs-
son & Cox, 2012). This focus on the male
perpetration­female victimization pattern over-
looks the findings from survey-based studies that
women are as likely as men to be perpetrators
of relationship aggression (Johnson, Giordano,
Manning, & Longmore, 2015) and that close to
half of relationship aggression involves mutual
aggression where both partners are perpetrators
(Renner & Whitney, 2010). A third related lim-
itation is that gender differences in these asso-
ciations remain unclear. Because the dynamics
in relationships among different-sex couples
continue to be gendered (Anderson, 2010; Eng-
land, 2010), it is possible that consequences of
relationship aggression for parenting stress and
practices may differ for women and men.
In this article, we address these limitations
using longitudinal data of married or cohabit-
ing mothers and fathers from Waves 3 and 4
in the Fragile Families and Child Wellbeing
Study (FFCWS). To eliminate the influences of
unobserved between-person selection factors,
we used fixed effects models, which control
for unmeasured time-invariant characteristics
and estimate within-person differences (Allison,
2009). We examined the associations between
mothers' and fathers' frequency of relation-
ship aggression and three aspects of parenting
of mothers and fathers, including parenting
stress, frequency of engagement with children,
and frequency of spanking. In addition, we
assessed perpetration­victimization type--
mutual, mother-only aggression, father-only
aggression, and no aggression--to better under-
stand whose aggression matters for whose
parenting. The findings of the present analysis
contribute to the literature by investigating
men's and women's aggression, as well as
mutual aggression, and by examining their links
to parenting stress and practices.
Prior Research
Family systems theory (Cox & Paley, 1997)
posits that mother­father relationships and
parent­child relationships are interdependent.
Using this broader framework, family scholars
have examined the link between mother­father
relationship aggression and parenting stress
and practices (Cummings & Watson O'Reilly,
1997; Erel & Burman, 1995; Krishnakumar &
Buehler, 2000). Recently, research has focused
specifically on intimate partner violence (IPV)
and its consequences for victims' parenting
stress and practices (e.g., Postmus, Huang, &
Mathisen-Stylianous, 2012; Taylor, Guterman,
Lee, & Rathouz, 2009). Both lines of research
have conceptualized the association into two
contrasting hypotheses. The first perspective
is the spillover perspective, which posits that
higher levels of relationship aggression lead
to more parenting stress and poorer parenting
practices (Erel & Burman, 1995). Negativity,
hostility, or frustration in the mother­father
relationship may be carried over into mothers'
and fathers' mood and interactions with their
children (Holden & Ritchie, 1991; Murray,
Bair-Merritt, Roche, & Cheng, 2012; Palazzolo,
Roberto, & Babin, 2010; Renner, 2009; Taylor
et al., 2010). The second perspective is the
compensatory perspective, which contends that
mother­father relationship aggression could
result in less parenting stress and better parent-
ing practices such as more engagement and less
harshness. Parents whose intimate partnerships
are hostile and antagonistic may try to invest
more in their relationships with children to
obtain affection and warmth (Brody, Pillegrini,
& Sigel, 1986).
Empirical studies generally have supported
the spillover perspective, showing a positive
association between relationship aggression and
parenting stress or ineffective parenting (for
reviews and meta-analyses, see Erel & Burman,
1995; Krishnakumar & Buehler, 2000). Still,
a few studies found support for the compen-
satory perspective. Using a small sample of
racially diverse mothers with preschool chil-
dren, Levendosky, Huth-Bocks, Shapiro, and
Semel (2003) found that IPV victimization was
positively related to mothers' warm, responsive
parenting practices. DeVoe and Smith's (2002)
qualitative study of mothers who had been in an
abusive relationship reported that some mothers
consciously avoid using physical punishment to
teach their children not to use physical force.
Furthermore, other studies showed that the link
may depend on the aspect of parenting. Lev-
endosky and Graham-Bermann (2000) found
that IPV victimization was negatively related to
mothers' warmth toward children, but was not
related to their discipline of their children.
Relationship Aggression and Parenting 163
Three Limitations in Prior Research
In this article, we address three limitations in
prior research to advance our understanding
of the link between mother­father relationship
aggression and parenting. First, more attention
should be paid to a third perspective, which
we call the selection perspective. Theoretical
perspectives that emphasize contextual influ-
ences on marriage and parenting (e.g., Conger,
Ge, Elder, Lorenz, & Simons, 1994; Simons
et al., 2002) suggest that mothers' and fathers'
experiences in marital and parenting domains
are largely shaped by social and life contexts
in which they are embedded. Indeed, prior
research has shown that there are a number
of characteristics that are related to both rela-
tionship aggression and parenting experience
(Slep & O'Leary, 2001). These include par-
ents' demographic and socioeconomic (SES)
characteristics, such as poverty, unemployment,
incarceration, and relationship status (Anderson,
2010; Conger et al., 1994; Cooper, McLanahan,
Meadows, & Brooks-Gunn, 2009; McLeod
& Shanahan, 1993; Nomaguchi & Johnson,
2016; Turney & Wildeman, 2013); children's
characteristics, such as the number of children
and child health (Caetano, Cunradi, Schafer
& Clark, 2000; Nomaguchi & Brown, 2011);
and parents' personality characteristics, such
as antisocial personality, poor interpersonal
skills, or unrealistic expectations for others'
behaviors (Simmons, Lehmann, & Dia, 2010).
After these selection factors are controlled
for, there may be little association between
relationship aggression and parenting stress or
practices.
Although some studies have controlled for
these background characteristics, it is impossible
to measure and control for all the variables that
are related to both relationship aggression and
parenting outcomes in random-effects models,
which are standard regression models typically
used in prior research. In random-effects mod-
els, unobserved (i.e., uncontrolled) variables are
regarded as random variables that are not cor-
related with the observed variables. We suspect
that may not be the case in the present analysis,
as we just explained. Fixed effects models are
useful to eliminate unmeasured time-invariant
differences between those who are involved
in relationship aggression and those who are
not, such as parents' and children's sociodemo-
graphic and personality characteristics, although
they do not control for unobserved time-varying
factors and do not establish a causal direction
(Allison, 2009). Fixed effects models require
longitudinal data to examine how difference
scores in relationship aggression correspond to
difference scores in parenting stress and prac-
tices over two or more assessment periods. Much
of the prior research has relied on cross-sectional
data. Even recent studies that used longitudi-
nal data did not control for parenting stress
or practices in an earlier time period (Gewirtz,
DeGarmo, & Medhanie, 2011; Gustafsson &
Cox, 2012; Huang, Wang, & Warrener, 2010;
Postmus et al., 2012). For example, Huang et al.
(2010), using FFCWS, examined relationship
aggression at Wave 2 and parenting practices at
Wave 3. Postmus and colleagues (2012) exam-
ined the associations between changes in IPV
from Wave 2 to Wave 3 and parenting stress
and practices in Wave 4, not changes in parent-
ing stress and practices. These research designs
do not address potential selection processes. To
eliminate possible selection biases, the present
analysis used fixed effects models.
Second, recent studies have largely focused
on the association between fathers' relationship
aggression and mothers' parenting stress and
practices (Gustafsson & Cox, 2012; Huang
et al., 2010; Postmus et al., 2012; Taylor et al.,
2009). Three other possible combinations of
the association--that is, mothers' aggression
and fathers' parenting, mothers' aggression and
mothers' parenting, and fathers' aggression and
fathers' parenting--have been rarely examined.
Given that women are as likely as men to use
verbal and physical aggression toward their
intimate partner (Johnson et al., 2015) and
fathers' parenting is related to child outcomes
(Pleck & Masciadrelli, 2004), it is important
to examine how mothers' aggression relates to
fathers' parenting. In addition, although prior
work largely focused on victims' parenting, it is
possible that aggressive mood and behavior of
perpetrators may spill over into the perpetrators'
own parenting stress and practices. Some earlier
studies examined both mothers' and fathers'
perpetration of relationship aggression and its
link to mothers' as well as fathers' parenting.
For example, Holden and Ritchie (1991) found
that fathers' relationship aggression was pos-
itively related to their irritability toward their
children. Fathers' irritability toward children
was, however, measured using the mothers'
report, instead of the fathers' own reports.
The current study examined how mothers' and
164 Journal of Marriage and Family
fathers' relationship aggression are related to
their own as well as their partner's parenting
stress and practices. Furthermore, using data
from the National Survey of Adolescent Health,
Renner and Whitney (2010) found that about
half of those reporting relationship aggression
reported mutual aggression. Thus, in addition to
the frequency of mothers' and fathers' perpetra-
tion of aggression, we also used a four-category
measure of perpetration­victimization type--no
aggression, mutual aggression, mother-only
perpetration, father-only perpetration--to better
understand the role of relationship aggres-
sion perpetration and victimization in shaping
parenting stress and practices.
Third, related to the second limitation, gender
differences in the consequences of relationship
aggression for parenting are unclear (Ander-
son, 2002). Prior research provides two contrast-
ing predictions. One is the gendered parenting
perspective. Research has shown that mothers
often play the primary role in parenting, whereas
fathers tend to be mothers' helpers (Fox, 2009).
Thus, fathers' participation in parenting tends
to be affected by mothers' encouragement or
gatekeeping (Fagan & Barnett, 2003). This idea
suggests that men's parenting is more vulner-
able to relationship aggression enacted by the
mother of their children (Erel & Burman, 1995).
In contrast, the gendered intimate relationship
perspective contends that women are more likely
than men to pay attention to the well-being of
their romantic relationship and are more likely
to be distressed by poor relationship quality
(Kessler & McLeod, 1984). This idea suggests
that mothers' parenting may be more affected
than fathers' parenting by relationship aggres-
sion. Empirical findings, mostly from earlier
studies, are inconsistent. Erel and Burman's
(1995) meta-analysis reported that there was lit-
tle gender difference in the magnitude of the
association between relationship quality and par-
enting. In contrast, Krishnakumar and Buehler
(2000), also using a meta-analysis, reported that
fathers' parenting is more strongly influenced
by the quality of the mother­father relation-
ship than mothers' parenting. Past research is
limited in that most studies relied on one per-
son's report, usually the mother's. The present
analysis examines gender differences in the link
between relationship aggression and parenting
stress and practices using reports from both
parents.
The Present Study
This study examined how mothers' and fathers'
relationship aggression was related to their own
and their partner's parenting using a sample of
married or cohabiting couples drawn from the
FFCWS. Of the various aspects of parenting,
we focused on parenting stress, frequency of
engagement in activities with children, and
frequency of spanking children, indicators that
were commonly used in prior research (Gustafs-
son & Cox, 2012; Huang et al., 2010; Postmus
et al., 2012; Taylor et al., 2009). We examined
parenting stress and parenting practices as
separate outcomes because some research has
shown that parenting stress has a direct effect
on children's behaviors (Huth-Bocks & Hughes,
2008; Levendosky & Graham-Bermann, 2000;
Taylor et al., 2009), although others suggest that
parenting stress could be a mediator (Postmus
et al., 2012).
On the basis of the selection perspective,
we expected that the association between rela-
tionship aggression and parenting stress and
practices observed in prior research--mostly
focused on fathers' aggression and mothers'
parenting--were in part because of background
characteristics that were related to both rela-
tionship aggression and parenting stress and
practices, and thus the association would be
less pronounced or would not be found in the
fixed effects models. Alternatively, on the basis
of the spillover perspective, we expected that
relationship aggression would be positively
related to parenting stress, negatively related
to engagement with children, and positively
related to spanking frequency for both moth-
ers and fathers and for both perpetrators and
victims, even after controlling for background
characteristics. To explore possible differ-
ences between perpetration and victimization
in its link to parenting, we used a measure of
perpetration­victimization type in addition to a
measure of frequency of relationship aggression.
We did not state particular hypotheses regarding
differences across mutual, perpetration-only,
and victimization-only aggression in its associ-
ation with parenting stress and practices. With
regard to gender differences, we discussed two
contrasting hypotheses. First, on the basis of the
gendered parenting perspective, we expected
that the association between relationship aggres-
sion and parenting would be stronger for fathers
than mothers. Second, on the basis of the gen-
dered intimate relationship perspective, we
Relationship Aggression and Parenting 165
expected that the association would be stronger
for mothers than fathers.
Multivariate analyses controlled for fathers'
and mothers' time-varying characteristics
that prior research has suggested are related
to parenting and parenting stress as well
as relationship aggression. These included
employment characteristics such as moth-
ers' and fathers' unemployment, work hours,
nonstandard work schedules, and multiple
jobs (e.g., Conger et al., 1994; Nomaguchi &
Johnson, 2016), fathers' incarceration history
(Turney & Wildeman, 2013), and family charac-
teristics such as the number of children, marital
versus cohabitation status, family income, and
child health (Brown, 2004; Johnson et al., 2015;
Nomaguchi & Brown, 2011; Postmus et al.,
2012).
Method
Data
Data for the present analysis were drawn from
Waves 3 and 4 of the FFCWS (http://www
.fragilefamilies.princeton.edu/). The FFCWS
is a stratified, multistage, probability sample
of children born between 1998 and 2000 in
U.S. cities with populations of at least 200,000
(Reichman, Teitler, Garfinkel, & McLanahan,
2001). The baseline interviews were conducted
in the hospital soon after the child's birth (W1).
Wave 2 (W2), Wave 3 (W3), Wave 4 (W4),
and Wave 5 (W5) interviews were conducted
by telephone when the child was 1, 3, 5, and
9 years old, respectively. We focused on data
from W3 and W4, because W1 did not include
any questions on relationship aggression, W2
did not include questions asking fathers about
mothers' physical aggression, and W5 did not
ask all parents about parenting stress and had
question items different from previous waves
to measure parental engagement with children.
We used national weights, which made the
data collected from the 16 randomly selected
cities representative of births that occurred in
the 77 U.S. cities with populations of more
than 200,000 in 1994 (Fragile Families &
Child Wellbeing Study, 2008; e.g., Lundberg,
McLanahan, & Rose, 2007). For the present
analysis, we first selected cases where the focal
child's mother and father both participated in
the W3 and W4 interviews (n = 1,782). Then we
limited the sample to those coresiding (cohab-
iting or married) in both waves (n = 973). The
W3 and W4 data were pooled into one data set
(N = 1,946 observations). Missing cases were
imputed using multiple imputations in SAS with
five iterations (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC;
Allison, 2001).
The average age for fathers at the birth of
the focal child in the sample was 31.3 years
(Appendix Table A1). Fathers' racial or ethnic
compositions were 47.0% White, 14.6% Black,
30.7% Hispanic, and 7.7% other race. About
9.1% of couples were interracial or intereth-
nic. Of the fathers, 17% did not complete a
high school degree, 19.2% had a high school
diploma, 34.1% had some college education, and
29.4% had a bachelor's degree or more. We com-
pared means for demographic and SES variables
between those who were retained in the sample
and those who were dropped. White mothers and
fathers were more likely to be retained at W3, as
were those with higher education and those who
reported being married at W1. We also compared
mean scores of relationship aggression at W2
between those who were included in the sample
and those who were dropped. The mean scores
were slightly higher for those who dropped out
of the sample. Thus, mothers and fathers in
the analytical sample were more advantaged in
sociodemographic characteristics and less likely
to be involved in relationship aggression than
those in urban areas in the general population.
Measures
Three aspects of parenting were examined.
Fathers' and mothers' parenting stress was mea-
sured as the average of four questions ( = .63
in W3 and .66 in W4 for fathers;  = .67 in both
W3 and W4 for mothers), (a) "Being a parent
is harder than I thought it would be," (b) "I
feel trapped by my responsibilities as a parent,"
(c) "I find that taking care of my child(ren) is
much more work than pleasure," (d) "I often
feel tired, worn out, exhausted from raising a
family" (1 = strongly disagree, 2 = disagree,
3 = agree, 4 = strongly agree). These four items
were derived from the JOBS Child Outcome
Survey conducted by Child Trends and Abidin's
Parent Stress Inventory (Abidin, 1995; Hofferth,
Davis-Kean, Davis, & Finkelstein, 1997). Our
alpha reliability coefficients were comparable
with those obtained by Abidin (1995) and
Hofferth et al. (1997).
Fathers' and mothers' engagement with chil-
dren (W3 and W4) was measured as the average
166 Journal of Marriage and Family
of four questions ( = .84 in both W3 and W4
for fathers and  = .74 in W3 and .73 in W4
for mothers) that asked fathers and mothers
how many days a week they would (a) "sing
songs or nursery rhymes," (b) "read stories,"
(c) "tell stories," or (d) "play inside with the
child." Responses ranged from 0 to 7 days per
week. Fathers and mothers who did not see the
child in the past month were coded as 0. This
measure has been used in other studies (Carl-
son, McLanahan, & Brooks-Gunn, 2008; Ryan,
Kalil, & Ziol-Guest, 2008).
Fathers' and mothers' frequency of spanking
was measured using two questions. Fathers and
mothers were asked whether they spanked their
child in the previous month because their child
was misbehaving or acting up. If they answered
"yes," they were asked how often they spanked
their child. A measure of frequency of spank-
ing was created for fathers and mothers, respec-
tively, where 0 = none, 1 = only once or twice,
2 = a few times in this past month, 3 = a few times
a week, and 4 = every day or nearly every day.
Because very few parents reported "every day,"
we combined them with "a few times a week,"
resulting in a scale that ranged from 0 to 3.
Relationship aggression was assessed by
two measures: frequency and perpetration­
victimization type. Fathers' and mothers' fre-
quency of relationship aggression (W3 and
W4) was measured as a mean scale of seven
questions that were reported by the other parent
( = .64 in W3 and .66 in W4 for fathers;  = .69
in W3 and .71 in W4 for mothers): (a) "S/he
insults or criticizes you or your ideas"; (b) "S/he
tries to keep you from seeing or talking with
your friends or family"; (c) "S/he tries to prevent
you from going to work or school"; (d) "S/he
withholds money, makes you ask for money,
or takes your money"; (e) "S/he slaps or kicks
you"; (f) "S/he hits you with a fist or an object
that could hurt you"; and (g) "S/he tries to make
you have sex or do sexual things you don't want
to do" (1 = never, 2 = sometimes, 3 = often).
Past research has used the same items in the
FFCWS to measure relationship aggression or
IPV (e.g., Postmus et al., 2012; Taylor et al.,
2009, 2010). Perpetration­victimization type
was measured as four dummy variables created
by using fathers' and mothers' frequency of
relationship aggression scales: no aggression
(couples in which both the father's and the
mother's frequency of relationship aggression
scales were 1), father-only aggression (couples
in which the father's frequency of relationship
aggression scale was greater than 1 and the
mother's frequency of relationship aggression
scale was 1), mother-only aggression (couples
in which the father's frequency of relationship
aggression scale was 1 and the mother's fre-
quency of relationship aggression scale was
greater than 1), and mutual aggression (cou-
ples where both the father's and the mother's
frequency of relationship aggression scales
were greater than 1). In supplemental analyses,
we examined measures of relationship aggres-
sion excluding physical aggression as well as
those including physical aggression only (i.e.,
questions e, f, g in the previous list) to assess
whether the association between relationship
aggression and parenting stress and practices
varied by intensity of relationship aggression.
The patterns of the findings were substantively
similar to those using the measures that included
all items.
Several control variables, all of which were
measured as time-varying variables, were
included. Fathers' and mothers' employment
status (W3 and W4) was measured as dummy
variables, including not employed, employed
part-time (<35 hours per week), and employed
full-time (35 hours per week and more; refer-
ence). Fathers' and mothers' nonstandard work
schedule (W3 and W4) was a dichotomous
variable where parents who reported being
employed were asked whether they worked
evenings, nights, rotating shifts, or weekends
(1 = yes, 0 = no). Fathers' and mothers' multiple
job holding (W3 and W4) was a dichotomous
variable where parents who reported working
more than one job at a time during the past
12 months were coded as 1 and 0 otherwise.
The income-to-poverty ratio (W3 and W4)
was a FFCWS-constructed variable using the
father's report. Father's incarceration history
(W3 and W4) was a dichotomous variable
in which couples where the father had been
incarcerated were assigned 1, and others were
assigned 0. Cohabitation (W3 and W4) was a
dummy variable in which couples who were
cohabiting were assigned 1, and those who
were married were assigned 0. The number of
children younger than age 18 in the household
(W3 and W4) was measured using the mother's
report as a continuous variable. Child's health
(W3 and W4) was an ordered variable ranging
from 1 = poor to 5 = excellent as reported by
mothers.
Relationship Aggression and Parenting 167
Analytical Plan
To examine the association between relationship
aggression and parenting stress and practices,
we used the pooled data set to estimate fixed
effects regression models (Allison, 2009; John-
son, 1995). A random-effects model, which is
a standard regression model typically used in
prior research, examines variations across indi-
viduals in the sample. In contrast, a fixed effects
model focuses on the within-person variation
while controlling for time-invariant unmeasured
characteristics--that is, selection factors--that
are related to both relationship aggression and
parenting outcomes (Allison, 2009). We tested
the serial correlation of errors for the same case
across different times, a necessary condition for
fixed effects models (Wooldridge, 2002). The
correlations were significant at p < .001 levels
for all models (data not shown). This means that
there were unobserved differences that distin-
guished between those who were involved in
relationship aggression and those who were not.
In addition, we used Hausman tests to determine
whether the estimates for all combinations of the
associations between mothers' and fathers' rela-
tionship aggression and mothers' and fathers'
parenting stress or practices in random versus
fixed effects were significantly different (Alli-
son, 2009). The Hausman tests of differences
in the coefficients between random-effects and
fixed effects models were significant for all mod-
els (data not shown). Collectively, these results
support the selection hypothesis and the need for
fixed effects models (Allison, 2009).
Results
Table 1 presents descriptive statistics for vari-
ables in the analyses. The mean for frequency
of relationship aggression was 1.13 for moth-
ers and 1.10 for fathers. Of the couples, 32%
reported no relationship aggression, whereas
27% reported mutual aggression, 26% reported
mother-only aggression, and 15% reported
father-only aggression. Consistent with findings
of studies using survey-based studies (e.g., Ren-
ner & Whitney, 2010), mothers were as likely as
fathers, or even more likely than fathers, to be
perpetrators of relationship aggression.
The first aspect of parenting we examined
was parenting stress. Table 2 shows the results
from fixed effects models for the associa-
tions between fathers' or mothers' relationship

related to mothers' parenting stress with or
without control variables in the model. Mothers'
frequency of relationship aggression was also
not related to mothers' parenting stress with
or without control variables. Models 3 and 4
examined whether the four types of relation-
ship aggression--that is, mutual, father-only,
mother-only, and no aggression--were related
Relationship Aggression and Parenting 169
to mothers' parenting stress without or with
control variables, respectively. Controlling
for background characteristics (Model 4),
father-only aggression and mutual aggression,
but not mother-only aggression, were positively
related to mothers' parenting stress. We tested
differences in the coefficient across the four
types of relationship aggression by running the
same models but switching the reference group
(data not shown). Differences in coefficients
between mutual and father-only aggression
were not significant, whereas differences in
coefficients between mutual and mother-only
aggression as well as those between father-only
and mother-only aggression were significant.
Altogether, these results suggest that the pres-
ence of fathers' aggression, either father-only
or mutual aggression, was positively related to
mothers' parenting stress, whereas mother-only
aggression did not seem to be related to mothers'
parenting stress.
Turning to fathers' parenting stress, fathers'
frequency of relationship aggression was posi-
tively related to fathers' parenting stress, albeit
only when demographic and SES characteristics
were controlled for (Model 2, in Table 2). A sup-
plemental analysis (data not shown) indicated
that fathers' and mothers' employment status
suppressed the association between fathers'
aggression and fathers' parenting stress (e.g.,
mothers' part-time job was positively related
to fathers' aggression but negatively related to
fathers' parenting stress). Models 3 and 4 show
that the presence of father-only aggression was
positively related to fathers' parenting stress,
whereas mutual aggression was not related.
Interestingly, the presence of mother-only
aggression was also positively related to fathers'
parenting stress. Differences in coefficients
across mother-only, father-only, and mutual
aggression were not statistically significant.
The second aspect of parenting that was
examined in the present analysis was moth-
ers' and fathers' engagement with children
(Table 3). Again, we examined mothers'
engagement first. Neither fathers' nor mothers'
frequency of aggression were related to mothers'
engagement with or without control variables
(Models 1 and 2). Yet, when we used the four
perpetration­victimization types, we found that
mother-only aggression was negatively related
to mothers' engagement with children, whereas
mutual or father-only aggression was not related
after controlling for background characteristics
(Model 4). Differences in coefficients across
the three groups were not significant, however.
Turning to fathers' engagement with children,
fathers' relationship aggression was negatively
related to their own engagement with children
without control variables in the model (Model
1). Yet, when demographic and SES charac-
teristics were controlled for, the association
was no longer significant (Model 2). This
was because fathers' and mothers' employ-
ment status explained the association between
fathers' aggression and fathers' engagement
with children (e.g., mothers' part-time job was
positively related to fathers' aggression and
negatively related to fathers' engagement with
children; fathers' unemployment was negatively
related to fathers' aggression and positively
related to fathers' engagement). Similar patterns
were found for mothers' aggression, which
was negatively related to fathers' engagement
with their children without control variables
(Model 1), but the association disappeared
when control variables were included in the
models (Model 2). When we used the four
perpetration­victimization types, we found
that, after controlling for demographic and
SES variables (Model 4), father-only or mutual
aggression was negatively related to fathers'
engagement with children compared to no
aggression present. Differences in coefficients
between mutual and father-only aggression were
not significant, whereas those between mutual
or father-only aggression and mother-only
aggression were significant.
The third aspect of parenting that the present
analysis examined was frequency of spanking
(Table 4). Fathers' frequency of relationship
aggression was not related to mothers' spank-
ing frequency (Models 1 and 2). This was
inconsistent with findings in prior research
(e.g., Huang et al., 2010; Postmus et al., 2012).
Unexpectedly, mothers' frequency of rela-
tionship aggression was negatively related to
frequency of spanking with or without control
variables. Note that the association was positive
in zero-order correlations (r = .06, p < .01).
Because fixed effects models are equivalent
to first-differences models when there are
two waves, as in our case (Allison, 2009),
coefficients in fixed effects models indicate
changes in the frequency of spanking. Analyses
using the four perpetration­victimization types
showed that mutual or mother-only aggression
was negatively related to mothers' spanking,

mothers' aggression--mutual or alone--and
mothers' spanking was inconsistent with the
spillover hypothesis. Turning to fathers' spank-
ing frequency, neither fathers' relationship
aggression nor mothers' relationship aggression
was related to fathers' spanking frequency.
When we used the four types of relation-
ship aggression, we found that mother-only
aggression was positively related to fathers'

spanking frequency whether or not background
characteristics were controlled (Models 3 and
4). Differences in coefficients across mutual,
mother-only, and father-only aggression were
not significant, however.
Table 5 presents a summary of the findings
from the fixed effects models. In the case of
parenting stress, it appears that, for mothers, the
presence of partners' aggression was related to
more parenting stress whether aggression was
mutual or father only. In contrast, for fathers,
relationship aggression was related to more par-
enting stress if the aggression was not mutual.
These results suggest gender differences in the
association between relationship aggression and
parenting stress. To test whether these gender
differences were significant, we performed
supplemental analyses. For these supplemental
analyses, we first transformed the couple-level
data into individual-level data. (Details about
this procedure are available on request.) To avoid
intraclass correlation, we randomly selected one
partner per couple. (Note that we repeated the
analyses using five different randomly selected
one partner per couple and found similar
results.) With the individual-level data, we con-
ducted fixed-effect regression models that were
similar to those presented in Tables 2 to 4 except
that they included interaction terms between
gender and each of the four dummy variables of
perpetration­victimization types (Gender × No
aggression was omitted as the reference group).
The results showed that gender differences in the
patterns of the association between relationship
aggression and parenting stress found in Table 3
were statistically significant (Appendix Table
A2). For engagement with children, mothers
and fathers showed similar patterns: Their own
perpetration--for fathers, including mutual
aggression--was negatively related to their own
engagement with children. Supplemental anal-
yses, similar to those that were conducted for
parenting stress, suggest that gender differences
were not statistically significant. For spanking,
mothers' aggression was negatively related to
mothers' spanking and positively related to
fathers' spanking. Gender differences in these
patterns were statistically significant.
Discussion
The link between relationship aggression and
parenting has long been of interest to fam-
ily scholars. Findings of the present analyses
stimulate future research in this area in several
ways. First, we used fixed effects models to
eliminate selection factors--the role of pre-
existing differences between those who are
involved in relationship aggression and those
who are not in shaping differences in parenting
stress and practices between the two groups.
Second, in addition to the association between
fathers' aggression and mothers' parenting, we
examined the association between mothers'
aggression and fathers' parenting, a neglected
but important question. We also examined the
Relationship Aggression and Parenting 173
associations between fathers' and mothers' rela-
tionship aggression and their own (i.e., perpetra-
tors') parenting stress and practices, which have
been rarely investigated in recent studies. By
using a measure of perpetration­victimization
type, which distinguishes mutual aggression
from mother-only or father-only aggression, in
addition to a measure of frequency of aggres-
sion, we were able to better illustrate the patterns
of association between relationship aggression
and parenting. Finally, we found both gender
similarities and differences. Next we discuss our
key findings in more detail.
With regard to the association between
fathers' relationship aggression and moth-
ers' parenting, our findings from fixed effects
regression models show that fathers' rela-
tionship aggression is related to mothers'
parenting stress. These findings support the
prior research findings that showed that rela-
tionship aggression victimization is related to
more parenting stress among mothers (e.g.,
Murray et al., 2012; Renner, 2009; Taylor et al.,
2009). For mothers' parenting practices, how-
ever, we found that fathers' aggression was
not related to mothers' engagement with their
children or their spanking frequency, which is
inconsistent with prior research (e.g., Postmus
et al., 2012). These findings suggest a possible
merit of using fixed effects models to eliminate
the influences of background characteristics
that are related to both fathers' aggression
perpetration and mothers' parenting practices.
Researchers have emphasized the co-occurrence
of relationship aggression and poorer parenting
practices (e.g., Taylor et al., 2009). As Slep and
O'Leary (2001) noted, it is critical to identify
background characteristics that contribute to
both forms of parents' behaviors--that is, rela-
tionship aggression and poor parenting--that
may be harmful to their children's well-being.
With regard to mothers' aggression, our find-
ings show that, as found in prior research using
survey-based studies, mothers were as likely as,
or even more likely than, fathers to be a per-
petrator of relationship aggression. We found
that mothers' aggression is positively related to
fathers' parenting stress and fathers' frequency
of spanking when fathers are victims only (i.e.,
when fathers are not aggressors as well). These
patterns of findings support the idea that a part-
ner's relationship aggression is related to the
victim's parenting stress and harsh parenting
(e.g., Slep & O'Leary, 2001; Taylor et al., 2009).
Although prior research tends to focus on moth-
ers, our findings suggest that this idea may apply
for fathers as well. Future research is needed
to investigate the process through which moth-
ers' relationship aggression is linked to fathers'
increased spanking frequency.
Our findings underscore the importance of
examining perpetrators' parenting. We found
that fathers' aggression is related to fathers'
own parenting stress and engagement, although
not spanking frequency. It could be that, per
the spillover hypothesis, fathers carry over their
negative mood toward mothers into their mood
in their parenting role and are withdrawn from
interactions with their children. Several other
explanations are possible. The association could
be mediated by maternal gatekeeping--mothers
may try to shield their children from harsh, con-
trolling fathers (Levendosky et al., 2003), which
makes it more difficult for fathers to partici-
pate in parenting, a factor that is related to more
parenting stress (Nomaguchi & Johnson, 2016).
It could be that her partner's increased anger
toward her might have led a mother to discourage
her children from spending time with him. Alter-
natively, it is possible that the causal direction
is opposite: Fathers' parenting stress spills over
into their interaction with their spouse. Because
our analysis does not allow us to determine the
causal direction, we are unable to make a conclu-
sion among these possible interpretations of the
finding.
Similarly, we found that mothers' aggression
is negatively related to mothers' engagement
and spanking frequencies. Less engagement
with children may mean a decline in attention
to their children. Research has suggested that
women's perpetration of relationship aggression
typically reflects their frustrated attempt to
control some issues in their marriage or part-
nership, such as financial strain, infidelity, or
arguments over the division of labor (DeMaris,
Benson, Fox, Hill, & Van Wyk, 2003). Mothers
may be preoccupied with the issues they face
in their marriage or partnership, which may
distract them from parenting. With regard to
lower spanking frequency, two different inter-
pretations are possible. First, this result could
be interpreted as supporting the compensatory
hypothesis, which explains that mothers try
to seek a warmer, close relationship in their
parenting role when they are unable to have it
in their marriage or romantic partnership. Alter-
natively, as shown in prior research (McLoyd &
174 Journal of Marriage and Family
Smith, 2002; Simons et al, 2002), if spanking
is a primary tool of discipline, a decline in the
frequency of spanking could mean an increase
in lax parenting. In the present sample, close
to half of the mothers (46.2%) reported having
spanked the focal child at least once during the
previous month. Frequency of spanking was
positively, not negatively, related to engagement
with children for mothers (r = .076, p < .001
in the Pearson correlation test). These findings
may suggest that spanking could be a primary
method of discipline among many parents in
the present sample. Thus, it may be possible to
interpret our findings that mothers provide their
children with less discipline when they grow
increasingly harsh or more controlling of their
partners. More research that examines the asso-
ciation between relationship quality and various
aspects of parenting practices is warranted.
We found both similarities and differences
between mothers and fathers in the association
between relationship aggression and parent-
ing. Mothers and fathers are similar in that
their relationship aggression was related to
less engagement with children. Mothers and
fathers differ in the association between rela-
tionship aggression and parenting stress or the
frequency of spanking. Specifically, mothers'
parenting stress is more vulnerable to their part-
ners' aggression, including mutual aggression,
whereas fathers' parenting stress is more vul-
nerable to their own or partners' but not mutual
aggression. Mothers' spanking is influenced by
their own aggression, whereas fathers' spanking
is influenced by their partners' aggression,
including mutual aggression. Although we
considered two alternative hypotheses, one pre-
dicting that mothers' parenting would be more
affected than fathers' parenting by relationship
aggression and the other predicting that fathers'
parenting would be more affected, we find that
both mothers' and fathers' parenting is affected
but in different ways. Research on gender differ-
ences in implications of relationship aggression
has been inconclusive except that many
researchers agree that women are more vulnera-
ble to severe forms of IPV, including injury (e.g.,
Warner, 2010). For example, some research has
found that consequences of relationship aggres-
sion for mental health are greater for women
than for men (Anderson, 2002), whereas other
research has shown that IPV is related to more
depression for both men and women (John-
son, Giordano, Longmore, & Manning, 2014).
More research is needed to understand gender
differences in the consequences of relationship
aggression for various aspects of outcomes.
The present analysis has limitations that
future research should address. First, measures
of parenting practices are limited. Inconsistency
in discipline and monitoring, such as television
or bedtime rules, may be better measures of
parenting practices that could be affected by
mother­father relationship aggression and have
direct influences on child outcomes (Krishnaku-
mar & Buehler, 2000). Second, the reliability of
the independent variable, relationship aggres-
sion, may be somewhat low, which could have
resulted in biased coefficients (Wooldridge,
2002), although it was equivalent to that used
in prior research (e.g., Postmus et al., 2012).
Third, as mentioned earlier, the present analysis
showed associations but did not permit us to
draw conclusions about the causal direction of
the association between relationship aggression
and parenting. Finally, the FFCWS focused on
an urban population, and it is possible results
could vary across suburban and rural locations.
We also focused on married or cohabiting cou-
ples who stayed together at least up to when the
focal child was 5 years old. Thus future research
using a nationally representative sample of U.S.
parents is warranted.
To conclude, the present analysis suggests
that future research should make further efforts
to eliminate background factors that are com-
pounded in the association between relationship
aggression and parenting. In addition, our study
suggests the importance of investigating the
influences of relationship aggression perpe-
tration on parenting stress and practices for
both mothers and fathers, separating mutual
aggression from perpetration-only aggression,
and looking at perpetrators' as well as victims'
parenting. Future research may benefit from
couple-level analyses that explore dyadic inter-
actions that can facilitate or buffer the processes
in which different perpetration­victimization
types lead to mothers' and fathers' parenting
stress and practices.
