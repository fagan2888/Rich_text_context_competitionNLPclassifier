Trust is essential for people's daily lives as members of soci-
ety. Nearly all forms of positive social interactions involve
some degree of trust in others to cooperate or to at least not
interfere in one's actions unnecessarily. Social science
research on the social functions of trust have been increasing
rapidly (e.g., Cook, 2001; Hardin, 2002; Hayashi & Yosano,
2005; Mashima, Yamagishi, & Macy, 2004), and the role of
trust as a key factor in reducing frictions in society has been
increasingly recognized.
The focus of the current research is on cultural differences
in the degree of trust, in particular between American and
Japanese cultures. Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) found
that Americans trusted others more than Japanese did, based
on questionnaires to measure the tendency of trusting other
people (the General Trust Questionnaire). They proposed
that this result could be due to the role of trust in these societ-
ies; Japanese society is characterized as involving more
mutual assurance and therefore interpersonal trust is less
important, whereas American society utilizes mutual assur-
ance less and hence a baseline assumption of trust is more
important for effective social interactions. This idea is poten-
tially related to the distinction between Western individualist
culture and Eastern collectivist culture.According to Triandis
(1995), individualism is defined as a social pattern in which
people view themselves as independent of collectives and
give priority to their personal goals over the goals of their
group, whereas collectivism is defined as a social pattern in
which people see themselves as parts of one or more collec-
tives and give priority to the goals of these collectives over
their own personal goals.
To explore whether levels of trust and the individualism/
collectivism distinction are related,Yamagishi andYamagishi
(1994) focused on the in-group bias effect as an assay of cul-
tural variation. In-group bias is the preferential treatment
people give to those whom they perceive to be members of
their own group (Tajfel, 1970), and such a bias helps to pro-
mote in-group harmony, which is an important goal in a col-
lectivist culture. Yamagishi and Yamagishi found that
Japanese had a stronger in-group bias than Americans and
proposed that, because the target persons in the questionnaire
of general trust were likely to be regarded as strangers (out-
group members), this led to the degree of general trust being
lower for Japanese than for Americans. We name this expla-
nation the in-group bias hypothesis (e.g., Yamagishi, Jin, &
Miller, 1998).

Two Methods to Measure the Level of
Trust of Americans and Japanese: A
Cross-Cultural Study
Hiromi Yamaguchi1, Gary L. Brase2, and Hiroshi Yama3
Abstract
Interpersonal trust of Japanese and Americans was investigated using two methods: a General Trust Questionnaire and
a scenario judgments task, in which participants were asked to rate how strongly they trust a target person in a series of
vignettes. Participants were grouped into two conditions, with the target person being either an in-group member or an out-
group member. The purposes of this study were to investigate whether Americans have a higher level of trust than Japanese
do, to test the in-group hypothesis which predicts that the difference in trust between the two conditions is greater for
Japanese than for Americans and the dialectical thought hypothesis which predicts that the correlation between the General
Trust Questionnaire score and the scenario judgments task score would only occur in the Americans' data. The study, which
was conducted with American (n = 105) and Japanese (n = 102) participants, found no differences in the trust level between
Americans and Japanese in both methods. The results did not support the in-group hypothesis, but did support the dialectical
thought hypothesis, indicating that Japanese are more dialectical in judging how they trust others.

However, the results that Americans trust others more
than Japanese have not been consistently replicated. For
example, the study by Yuki, Maddux, Brewer, and Takemura
(2005), which argued for the importance of both self-
construal and in-group bias, found opposite results in com-
paring Japanese with Americans. Their position was that
Americans, who have independent self-construal, are more
sensitive to the categorical distinction between in group and
out group, and thus Americans trust in-group members more
than out-group members. Japanese, in contrast, have a more
interdependent self-construal and are more sensitive to rela-
tions between themselves and others and hence trust people
who have stronger relations with themselves. Their results
supported this hypothesis and did not find that Americans
trusted others more than Japanese did.
One of the reasons for the nonrobustness of the cultural
difference in trust may be the reference-group effect. As
Heine, Lehman, Peng, and Greenholtz (2002) point out, it is
very plausible that the method of using questionnaires is sus-
ceptible to the reference-group effect. When people are asked
to rate how much they trust others, they assume the imagined
standard of the group to which they belong. Hence, although
they are encouraged to make an absolute judgment, they are
very likely to estimate their attitude referring to their own
group. In the case of a cross-cultural study, it is very plausi-
ble that people refer to the group of their own country.
Therefore, even if there is an actual cultural difference in the
degree of trusting others, this difference may not appear in
questionnaire data.
To solve this problem, we utilized not only the General
Trust Questionnaire but an additional method to measure
levels of trust for Americans and Japanese. Hayashi and
Yosano (2005) used both a questionnaire and an imaged
scene method, but only for Japanese participants. In the
imaged scene method of Hayashi and Yosano (2005), the
participants were asked to judge the probability that a target
person would not cheat in a social exchange context vignette.
This "scenario judgments" task, initially developed by
Kosugi and Yamagishi (1998), is assumed to measure how
much people trust others. However, Hayashi and Yosano
(2005) found that the scores of the questionnaire and the rat-
ing from the scenario judgments task were not significantly
correlated with each other.
A possible reason for this nonsignificant correlation may
be Easterners' tendency toward dialectical thinking. For
example, Peng and Nisbett (1999) found that Chinese were
less sensitive than Americans to inconsistency in proverbs
and proposed that Easterners' thinking is more dialectical.
Easterners'tendency toward dialecticism has also been found
in self-esteem (Spencer-Rodgers, Peng, Wang, & Hou, 2004)
and in self-concept (Spencer-Rodgers, Boucher, Mori, Wang,
& Peng, 2009). It is therefore plausible that Easterners have
this tendency in the realm of trust. This would predict that
they are more likely to have dialectical views on their ten-
dency to trust others. For example, it is plausible that, even if
Japanese believe that they trust others, they do not actually
do so, and vice versa. We call this the dialectical thought
hypothesis.
The second possible reason for the nonsignificant correla-
tion is the difference in target person between the two mea-
sures. It is assumed that the targets are strangers in the
General Trust Questionnaire (Yamagishi & Yamagishi,
1994). However, it is unclear whether the target person in the
scenario judgments task is an out-group member or an in-
group member (Hayashi & Yosano, 2005). Hence, it is plau-
sible that some participants regarded the target person in the
vignette as an in-group member and thus the correlation was
low. Therefore, we set two conditions for the scenario judg-
ments task. One version of the scenario judgments task clari-
fies that the target person is an in-group member (the in-group
condition), whereas the other version indicates that the target
person is an out-group member (the out-group condition).
We do not intend to test the full self-construal hypothesis of
Yuki et al. (2005), but we focus on the effect of asking par-
ticipants to rate trust for relation-based in-group members
(you and the target person are old and good friends) versus
trust for relation-based out-group members. We predict that
the correlations of the scores between the General Trust
Questionnaire and the scenario judgments task will be higher
in the out-group condition.
The key goals of the present study were to examine the
cultural difference in trust between Americans and Japanese
using two methods to measure the degree of trust and to test
the in-group bias hypothesis and the dialectical thought
hypothesis. If the reference-group effect on the General Trust
Questionnaire hides a cultural difference in trust, we expect
a cultural difference will appear when using the scenario
judgments task. The two conditions in the scenario judg-
ments task make it possible to test the in-group bias hypoth-
esis. According to this, the difference in trust levels between
Americans and Japanese should be greater in the out-group
condition than in the in-group condition. Specifically,
Japanese trust of an out-group target should be less than that
of Americans. Furthermore, the correlation in score between
the scenarios judgments task and the General Trust
Questionnaire should be higher in the out-group condition.
Finally, according to the dialectical thought hypothesis, the
more dialectical thinking of Japanese participants will pro-
duce a lower correlation between the scenario judgments
task and the General Trust Questionnaire, as compared with
Americans.
Method
Participants and Design
A total of 105 American students at Kansas State University
(29 male, 76 female, M
age
= 19.04) and 102 Japanese stu-
dents at Bukkyo University, Kobe College, and Kyoto
University (41 male, 61 female, M
age
= 20.74) participated in
Yamaguchi et al. 3
this experiment. Participants within each culture were ran-
domly assigned to one of the two experimental conditions,
thus creating a 2 (Target: in group, out group) × 2 (Nationality:
Japanese, American) design. The number of participants in
each condition is shown in Table 1.
Materials
Materials were printed in booklets, which consisted of demo-
graphic information, the scenario trust judgments task, and a
General Trust Scale (see Appendix B).1 The scenario judg-
ments task consisted of six scenarios, which were originally
used in Kosugi and Yamagishi (1998) and Hayashi and
Yosano (2005). All these scenarios described a person who is
faced with taking an action that corresponds to either demon-
strating or violating trust and asks the participant to estimate
the probability that he will do the action or not by marking a
number along a horizontal line from 0% to 100% (see full
text in Appendix A). Half of the scenarios ask participants to
estimate the probability the person would violate the other
person's trust, and the remaining scenarios ask the probabil-
ity the person would fulfill the other person's trust. Scores
were calculated by reverse scoring the violation-type sce-
narios and then averaging the responses. A sentence was
added at the top of each scenario to indicate whether the tar-
get person was an in-group member ("Imagine that you and
Mr. A are old and good friends") or an out-group member
("Imagine an ordinary person named Mr. A, about whom you
know nothing at all beyond the following information").
We used the questionnaire measuring personal trust which
was modified from the original version of Yamagishi and
Yamagishi (1994) by Horii and Tsuchiya (1995), as this later
version was shown to be more reliable. Participants answered
each question on a 10-point scale, ranging from not at all to very
much, and these responses were averaged for an overall score.
For all the materials, the original stimuli were written in
Japanese and then translated into English for American par-
ticipants. A back-translation procedure was then used to con-
firm that both Japanese and English versions were equivalent.
Procedure
Participants in both cultures were run in classroom environ-
ments, with each person given a booklet to complete and
ample time for completion. American participants were
given credit toward completion of a course requirement. The
sections of the booklet were in the order presented above,
and participants were debriefed after they completed the
study.
Results
Mean general trust scores for Japanese and Americans par-
ticipants are shown in Table 1. There was no significant dif-
ference between the nationalities on general trust scores
(t(205) = 1.43, ns). Mean ratings on the scenario judgments
for each nationality (sorted by target condition) are also
shown in Table 1 along with reliability coefficients (alpha
values). A 2 (Target) × 2 (Nationality) ANOVA found a
weak effect of nationality, F(1, 205) = 3.28, p = .07.Although
this effect was not statistically significant, the direction of
the result was that Japanese trusted people more than
Americans. These were the opposite of the results that
Yamagishi and Yamagishi (1994) reported. Neither the main
effect of target--in-group versus out-group member: F(1,
205) = 1.47, ns--nor the interaction--F(1, 205) = 0.67, ns--
was significant.
Table 2 shows the correlations between the scenario
judgments measures and general trust scores of Japanese
and American participants. Consistent with the results of
Hayashi and Yosano (2005), the Japanese data showed no
significant correlations between the scenario judgments
measures and the general trust score. The American data,
however, show a totally different result from that of the
Japanese results. The correlations between the general trust
score and the scenario judgment measures were positive and
significant.

In addition, we analyze the data taking gender into con-
sideration as a variable. Because gender differences are not
very important in this field and the ratios of males and
females were not 1:1, this analysis is supplementary. A 2
(Nationality) × 2 (Gender) ANOVA was conducted for gen-
eral trust score, but neither the main effect of nationality,
F(1, 203) = 1.05, ns, and the main effect of gender,
F(1, 203) = 0.11, ns, nor the interaction, F(1, 203) = 1.32, ns,
was significant. A 2 (Target) × 2 (Nationality) × 2 (Gender)
ANOVA was conducted for rating on the scenario judgment.
The main effect of nationality was significant, F(1, 199) =
5.52, p < .05. The mean rating of Japanese was higher than
that of Americans. The main effect of gender was significant,
F(1, 199) = 7.16, p < .01. The mean rating of female was
higher than that of male. Neither the main effect of target,
F(1, 199) = 0.92, ns; the interaction between target and
nationality, F(1, 199) = 0.14, ns; the interaction between tar-
get and gender, F(1, 199) = 0.82, ns; and the interaction
between nationality and gender, F(1, 199) = 0.86, ns; nor the
interaction between target, nationality, and gender,
F(1, 199) = 0.05, ns, was significant. The correlations as
shown on Table 2 were also figured out in each of male and
female data set, but each pattern of correlations was almost
the same as that on Table 2.
Discussion
This study deals with one inconsistency in prior studies and
two hypotheses about human trust. First, do Americans have
higher levels of trust than Japanese? Although Yamagishi
and Yamagishi (1994) found this pattern, Yuki (2003) did
not. The present research found few significant differences in
either general trust or scenario judgments of trust across
these cultures, except for within the exploratory analysis
including gender. If anything, the present data suggest that
Japanese may trust people slightly more than Americans.
Because the reference-group effect is expected to be smaller
for the scenario judgment task measure, these results indicate
that the lack of cultural difference in general trust is not
because of a reference-group effect (Heine et al., 2002) but
rather because the difference does not exist (or is very small
at best). We are uncertain as to why we found these conflict-
ing results. One possible answer is that cultural differences in
trust may not be strongly related to any stable differences
between Easterners and Westerners and that how strongly
people trust strangers is susceptible to incentive structures
that are easily changeable (e.g., Yamagishi, Terai, Kiyonari,
Mifune, & Kanazawa, 2007). In other words, trust of strang-
ers may be more a function of opportunity costs (such as lost
profits) that may occur due to unnecessary distrust. In the
two decades since some of the previous studies were con-
ducted, it is plausible that opportunity costs have increased
due to changes in the economic system of Japan.
The in-group hypothesis was not supported by the sce-
nario judgments task results. Because we did not find an
overall cultural difference in trust between Americans and
Japanese, we may not need any hypothesis to explain this
result. The results on the scenario judgments task, neverthe-
less, clearly show that the difference in rating between the
in-group condition and the out-group condition is not greater
for Japanese.
However, the dialectical thought hypothesis was strongly
supported. The correlations between the general trust score
and the scenario judgments task measures were very low for
the Japanese data, but they were quite high (and statistically
significant) for the American data. One explanation for this
result, which was predicted a priori, is that Japanese partici-
pants were more likely to engage in dialectical thinking
while answering these questions and this tendency led to the
lack of correlation. This result and explanation should be
tempered with some caution, though, because the reliability
of the scenario judgment task measure is questionable.
Whereas the General Trust Questionnaire had a solid reli-
ability coefficient (.82 for the Japanese sample, which inci-
dentally indicates that their thinking was not entirely
dialectical across the items in this questionnaire), the sce-
nario judgments task had low reliability (.45 to .66). This
could be due to a few different causes. For instance, one pos-
sibility is that the scenarios in this scale are not perceived as
being uniformly about the same type of trust situation. This
is an issue for further research.
Another consideration is that the dialectical thought
hypothesis is not essential to explain how people trust others.
It was proposed to explain the nonsignificant correlation
between the General Trust Questionnaire score and the sce-
nario judgments task rating found by Hayashi and Yosano
(2005). However, it also suggests further implications for
conducting questionnaire research on psychological charac-
teristics of Japanese. For example, Miyamoto and Ryff
(2011) found that Japanese have more dialectical emotions
such as experiencing both positive and negative emotions
than Americans. Their results suggest that the tendency of
dialecticism among Easterners is not limited to situational
inferences and may extend to topics such as experienced
emotions. Eastern dialecticism may also manifest with the
context of in-group favoritism, which is more dominant in
Easterners than in Westerners. Ma-Kellams, Spencer-
Rodgers, and Peng (2011) reported that Chinese showed both
in-group favoritism and in-group derogation and concluded
that it was because of the dialecticism of Easterners. These
results are somewhat at odds with the common claim that
Easterners, who are in a more collectivist culture, have (only)
a stronger in-group bias.
There is another possible reason for the significant corre-
lations between general trust and the scenario judgments
only in the Americans' data. There may be differences in the
naïve concept of trust between Americans and Japanese. The
scenarios used in this experiment were constructed based on
social exchanges, and it is plausible that Americans view
their general trust as being based on the social exchange. It
may be the case that Japanese have a concept of trust that is
not solely based on the social exchange, although it remains
Yamaguchi et al. 5
unclear what the additional considerations would be. This
issue should be addressed in future studies. Finally, a remark
to be mentioned is that the ratios of males to females were
not 1:1 in our samples. Therefore, there is a risk that our
results cannot strongly be generalized. Gender differences in
trust have not been dealt with intensively, but for by some
authors. For example, Buchan, Croson, and Solnick (2008)
reported that women trusted more in economic games than
men. Our data of rating on the scenario judgment were com-
patible with their results. The gender differences should be
addressed in other future studies.
Appendix A
Scenarios Used in This Study
Scenario 1
He runs a restaurant and he owes Mr. B $100,000, with inter-
est, as funds for opening the restaurant. Mr. B lent this money
as a personal loan, without drawing up a signed acknowledg-
ment of a debt officially. Mr. A intends to pay it back to Mr.
B on a 10-year installment plan, and he has already paid back
$90,000. He still has $10,000 to pay back. Then, Mr. B
passed away. So, Mr. A should pay back the remaining
$10,000 to Mr. B's son now. However, Mr. B's son is work-
ing in a company overseas, and he doesn't know anything
about his father's loan to Mr. A.
Please estimate the probability that Mr. A does not pay
back the remaining $10,000 to Mr. B's son and just keeps
the money for himself.
Scenario 2
Mr. C went to a hamburger shop to have a meal, and he
ordered several hamburgers which cost about $25. As he was
paying the bill, he noticed that the waiter (a trainee without
much experience) miscalculated the bill as only $15.
Please estimate the probability that Mr. C will point out the
waiter's mistake.
Scenario 3
While Mr. D was in his car and waiting for a traffic light
to change, a car behind him bumped into his car. Both Mr.
D and the other driver were unhurt, but a back-up light on
Mr. D's car was damaged. The other driver, who caused
the car accident, told Mr. D that he will pay to repair the
damage without involving his insurance. It just so hap-
pens that the rear bumper on Mr. D's car had a certain flaw
before the accident, and the whole bumper could be fixed
for an additional $500. Mr. D could include the payment
to fix the bumper flaw (the problem for which the other
driver is not responsible) in the total amount of damage
compensation and the other driver would not know about
it.
Please estimate the probability that Mr. D does not ask the
other driver for the entire payment for the broken
bumper.
Scenario 4
While traveling, Mr. E stayed in a hotel for a week. When he
checked out of the hotel a front desk clerk misunderstood the
days of his stay and asked for a payment of $360, which was
much cheaper than the full charge for a week's stay. If Mr. E
pays that price, he will not be asked to pay the rest of the
money.
Please estimate the probability that Mr. E only pays $360
and pretends that he did not recognize the clerk's
mistake.
Scenario 5
Mr. F just bought a set of tableware for about $30 from a
mail-order company, but he carelessly dropped and broke it.
According to the mail-order regulations, customers can
return and exchange goods if they happen to get broken
goods or receive goods that are different from the ordered
ones. Of course, customers cannot do so if they break them
by themselves after receiving the shipment. However, Mr. E
kept the delivery box, and it is possible for him to pretend
that the tableware was broken during the mailing. So if Mr. E
sends the tableware back to the mail-order firm, he may be
able to get a new set of tableware.
Please estimate the probability that Mr. F tries to exchange
the tableware that he broke himself by pretending that it
broke during delivery.
Scenario 6
Mr. G runs a coffee shop, and he once borrowed a painting
from Mr. H to decorate the shop with. They didn't draw any
signed acknowledgment of a debt, but the painting was quite
valuable, worth about $7,000. After 5 years of having the
borrowed painting, Mr. G decided to close down the coffee
shop. By that time, Mr. H had passed away and his wife
became the painting's legal owner. However, Mr. H's wife is
a perfect stranger to Mr. G. She is not familiar with the value
of paintings, and she didn't even know that her late husband
lent it to Mr. G. So if Mr. G doesn't return the painting to her,
he can just keep it and pretend that it is his.
Please estimate the probability that Mr. G returns the
painting unwillingly.
