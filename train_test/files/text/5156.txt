Psychological Reports
Introduction
In forensic psychiatric/psychological assessment, examinees
may feign psychosis to escape culpability. Feigning psycho-
sis is one of the main manifestations of malingering.
According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of
Mental Disorders (5th ed.; DSM-5; American Psychiatric
Association [APA], 2013), malingering is defined as "the
intentional production of false or grossly exaggerated physi-
cal or psychological symptoms, motivated by external incen-
tives such as avoiding military duty, avoiding work, obtaining
financial compensation, evading criminal prosecution, or
obtaining drugs" (APA, 2013, p. 726). Malingering is differ-
ent from factitious disorder in that the motivation for the for-
mer has an external incentive whereas for the latter external
incentives are absent (APA, 2013). However, the distinction
between malingering and factitious disorder is usually diffi-
cult and problematic in clinical work (Rogers, 2008b;
Rogers, Bagby, & Vincent, 1994). Regardless of the differen-
tiation of these, the first most important step is to detect
feigning, which means "the deliberate fabrication or gross
exaggeration of psychological or physical symptoms without
any assumptions about its goals" (Rogers, 2008b, p. 6). As it
is often difficult to determine individuals' underlying moti-
vations, psychological tests can be used to establish feigning,
but not malingering (Rogers, 2008b).
Feigning is not rare. Surveys concerning forensic and
nonforensic referrals yielded mean percentages of approxi-
mately 15% to 17%, respectively, and about 7% for feigning
(Rogers, 2008b). In a study on the feigning of neuropsycho-
logical symptoms, 17% of criminal cases, 13% of personal
injury cases, 13% of disability or workers compensation
cases, and 4% of medical or psychiatric cases were found to
have either symptom exaggeration or probable symptom
exaggeration (Sullivan, Lange, & Dawes, 2005). Feigning
has also been recognized in the military context (Malone &

Detection of Feigning Psychosis With
Multiscale Personality Inventories:
A Simulation Design Pilot Study in Taiwan
Yi-Ting Chang1, Wai-Cheong Carl Tam2,
and Shih-Kuang Chiang3
Abstract
Assessing feigning psychosis is extremely important in forensic psychological assessment. This pilot study investigated the
utility of three multiscale personality inventories, namely, the Chinese Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI-2),
the Ko Mental Health Questionnaire (KMHQ), and the Health-Personality-Habit Inventory (HPH), in the detection of feigning
psychosis in Taiwan. It was hypothesized that the above three inventories were effective in the detection of feigning psychosis.
The sample consisted of 70 participants (students and community members; with 19 men and 51 women), with mean age of
22.01 years (SD = 3.86), who were randomly assigned to two different groups: feigning psychosis and honestly responding.
The KMHQ, the HPH, and the Chinese MMPI-2 were administered to each participant in this sequential order. Altogether
16 scales from these inventories were statistically analyzed using MANOVA, t test, Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC)
analysis, and discriminant analysis. Of these 16 scales, the scores of 14 scales differed significantly between the feigning
psychosis and honestly responding groups. In addition to the exploration of the best discriminant variables, the effect size,
best cutoff score, classification accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity of the scales of the above three inventories in
discriminating participants between feigning psychosis and honestly responding were presented, respectively. The results
of this study supported the utility of the Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH in the detection of feigning psychosis.

Lange, 2007). For instance, Chiang et al. (2006) found that in
a draftee sample for psychiatric reevaluation, 9.1% were sus-
pected to be feigners.
The phenomenon of feigning may create a range of seri-
ous problems. First, clinicians are trained with scientific
knowledge and methods to find the psychiatric truth.
Obviously, clinicians have not done their job well if they are
fooled by their clients. Second, medical resources may be
wasted on unwarranted care with clients with feigned illness.
Third, when the reports of the assessment of clients' condi-
tions are used in judicial procedures, justice may be hindered
if sentencing is based on incorrect evidence. Acceptance of
incorrect evidence may affect individuals' social standing,
their property holdings, or even issues of life and death.
However, the detection of feigning is not easy. Both lay
people and professionals are typically not very good at detect-
ing lies (Vrij, 2008).Although there are individual differences
in judging deception, few people can be identified as experts
in deception detection (C. F. Bond & DePaulo, 2008; G. D.
Bond, 2008). Scientific investigation on the detection of
deception has pointed toward verbal and nonverbal behaviors
that may be helpful cues in detecting deception. Yet, despite
many years of research, the accuracy of all these suggestions
is not high due to the enormous variation of human behavior
while lying or telling the truth, both at the intrapersonal and
interpersonal levels (Boyd, McLearen, Meyer, & Denney,
2007; Bradford & Goodman-Delahunty, 2008; Resnick,
2007; Sporer & Schwandt, 2007; Vrij, 2008). Some research-
ers focus on the physiological responses of liars and poly-
graph methods have been proposed for detecting deception.
However, as is well known, generally speaking, the opinions
of researchers on the accuracy of the polygraph fall on the
negative side. In fact, the National Research Council of the
United States National Academy of Sciences found that the
validity of the polygraph has not been scientifically supported
(Boyd et al., 2007; Iacono & Patrick, 2008; Vrij, 2008; Weiner
& Hess, 2006; Wrightsman & Fulero, 2005).
On the contrary, the clinical assessment of response styles
has made progress. Methods for the detection of feigning
have evolved from case studies and group differences to
detection strategies (Rogers & Correa, 2008). The
Infrequency (F), Lie (L), and Correction (K) scales of the
Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory (MMPI) were
regarded as the beginning of the assessment of response
styles both systematically and empirically (Rogers, 2008a).
There are four basic distinct response styles in clients within
the psychiatric setting: reliable response style, irrelevant
response style, defensiveness, and malingering (Rogers,
Bagby, & Dickens, 1992). At present, the most commonly
used multiscale personality inventories in clinical or forensic
settings in the United States are the MMPI-2, the Personality
Assessment Inventory (PAI), and the Millon Clinical
Multiaxial Inventory­III (MCMI-III), and significant
research has been devoted to assessing the validity of these
measures for detecting specific response styles (Boyd et al.,
2007; Greene, 2008; Sellbom & Bagby, 2008). With respect
to the MMPI-2, some scales, such as the Infrequency Scale
(F), the Back Infrequency Scale (Fb), the Infrequency-
Psychopathology Scale (Fp), the Gough's Dissimulation
Index (F-K), and the Gough's Dissimulation Scale (Ds),
have been shown to be useful in detecting feigning (Gough,
1950, 1954; Greene, 2008; Meyers, Millis, & Volkert, 2002;
Rogers, Sewell, Martin, & Vitacco, 2003). These are either
validity scales or scales constructed for detecting feigning.
According to the review by Rogers et al. (2003), the strate-
gies used for the detection of feigned mental disorders in the
MMPI-2 include the following: rare symptoms, symptom
severity, comparison of obvious and subtle symptoms, and
erroneous stereotypes. For example, the scales F, Fb, Fp, and
F-K use the detection strategy of rare symptoms, while the
scale Ds belongs to the strategy of erroneous stereotypes.
Despite the presence of various basic research designs in
studying response styles, most research on feigning mental
disorders relies on simulation designs using analog research
method, in which nonclinical participants are randomly
assigned to different experimental conditions (Rogers,
2008c). Then the experimental group is compared with the
control group (i.e., honest or standard conditions). The
strength of simulation designs is strong internal validity
(Rogers, 2008b). In addition, coaching is considered to be an
important variable in this kind of research (Bagby, Nicholson,
Bacchiochi, Ryder, & Bury, 2002; Rogers, 2008c; Storm &
Graham, 2000), as the assumption that the examinees in the
forensic psychological assessment are uninformed of the pur-
pose and method of testing is untenable (Rogers, Bagby, &
Chakraborty, 1993). There are two kinds of coaching: symp-
tom/disorder-based coaching and detection-based coaching
(Rogers, 2008c). Research showed that the factors assisting
feigners who succeeded to avoid detection on the MMPI-2
were greater intelligence, prior knowledge of the condition
feigned, and prior information of the MMPI-2 (Pelfrey, 2004;
Walters & Clopton, 2000). Moreover, Wetter and Corrigan
(1995) reported that 50% of attorneys felt obliged to inform
their clients about the MMPI-2. On the contrary, the effect of
incentives on simulators is another issue in research on feign-
ing mental disorders, and it appears that the desire for the
award increases the motivation to feign (Rogers, 2008c).
Some researchers attempted to provide higher incentives but
made them available to only the top few performers in the
simulating group (e.g., Bagby et al., 2002; Elhai et al., 2007).
The MMPI-2 has been translated into Chinese and pub-
lished by the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Cheung,
Zhang, & Song, 2003). Nevertheless, the Ko Mental Health
Questionnaire (KMHQ) and the Health-Personality-Habit
Inventory (HPH) are the two most frequently used multiscale
personality inventories in clinical settings in Taiwan. They
have also been used in forensic psychiatric/psychological
assessment ordered by courts. However, there has been no
research on the utility of the KMHQ or the HPH with respect
to the detection of feigning psychosis.
Chang et al. 3
Taken together, this pilot study investigated the utility of
the Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH in the detec-
tion of feigning psychosis. The following hypotheses were
made.
Hypothesis 1: The scales of the Chinese MMPI-2 used
for detecting feigned mental disorders would be effective
in discriminating participants in the feigning and control
groups.
Hypothesis 2: The validity scales of the KMHQ would be
effective in discriminating participants in the feigning and
control groups.
Hypothesis 3: The validity scales of the HPH would be
effective in discriminating participants in the feigning and
control groups.
In addition, the effect size, best cutoff score, classification
accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity of the scales of the
above three inventories in discriminating participants
between feigning psychosis and honestly responding were
investigated, respectively. Furthermore, for each of these
multiscale personality inventories, the best discriminative
variables were also explored. This information is extremely
important and useful for clinicians conducting forensic psy-
chological assessment.
Method
Participants
The participants were recruited through advertisements
posted on campus notice boards and the webpage of a uni-
versity in northern Taiwan for 2 months. The inclusion crite-
ria for participants were (a) at least 17 years old, (b) no
history of psychiatric illness, and (c) not studying psychol-
ogy or psychology-related courses. In total, 70 participants
(19 men and 51 women) responded voluntarily to the adver-
tisements and they all satisfied the inclusion criteria of the
study. Their mean age was 22.01 years (SD = 3.86), ranging
from 17 to 47 years old. The mean education level of the
participants was 14.70 years (SD = 1.68), ranging from 12 to
19 years. With regard to occupation, 64 of the participants
were students. In addition to the university's institutional
review board's (IRB) approval of this research project and
the signing of informed consent forms by all participants, the
Declaration of Helsinki was strictly followed in the protec-
tion of participants' rights.
Measures
MMPI-2. The MMPI-2 was first published in 1989 (Butcher,
Dahlstrom, Graham, Tellegen, & Kaemmer, 1989). It is a
self-report questionnaire comprising 567 items which can be
answered "True" or "False," and has seven validity scales.
The MMPI-2 was standardized on an adult norm. There has
already been accumulated a large amount of research on the
reliability and validity of the MMPI-2 which supports its uti-
lization (Butcher et al., 2001; Groth-Marnat, 2009). The Chi-
nese MMPI-2 was first published in 2003 (Cheung, Zhang,
& Song, 2003). Two norms have been reported: China norms
and Hong Kong norms. Generally speaking, the psychomet-
ric properties of the Chinese MMPI-2 are similar to that of
the English version (Cheung et al., 2003). Previous research
indicated that Chinese respondents endorsed much more
items of the MMPI F scale than American respondents, and
thus a new Chinese Infrequency scale (ICH) was developed
for the Chinese MMPI (Cheung, Song, & Butcher, 1991).
This scale has also been used in the Chinese MMPI-2. As
mentioned above, the scales F, Fb, Fp, F-K, and Ds have
been shown to be useful in detecting feigning. In addition, as
the ICH is the specific Infrequency scale for Chinese
MMPI-2 respondents, the scales Fb, Fp, F-K, Ds, and ICH
were used for statistical analysis in this study. The scales Fb,
Fp, and ICH are in the standard scoring system of the Chi-
nese MMPI-2 (Cheung et al., 2003) and consist of 40, 27,
and 15 items, respectively. Gough (1950, 1954) constructed
the Gough Dissimulation Index (F-K), which is the raw score
difference between the F and K scales, and the Gough Dis-
simulation Scale (Ds), which has 58 items in the MMPI-2.
The raw scores of these scales were used for computation.
KMHQ.The KMHQ is a Chinese multiscale personality
inventory for assessing psychopathology and has been used in
Taiwan for many years. The purpose of constructing this mea-
sure was to have an indigenous test similar to the MMPI. The
items were empirically derived without adhering to any par-
ticular personality theory or psychiatric diagnostic system
(Ko, 1998). The KMHQ's first edition appeared in 1964 (Ko,
1964), and was revised in 1974 (Ko, 1977) and 1991 (Ko
et al., 1992), respectively. The latest version was published in
1998 (Ko, 1998) and consisted of 300 items. Each item is
responded to using 6-point rating scale, ranging from totally
untrue to totally true. The KMHQ has 38 scales, in which six
of them are validity scales, namely, Reliable Responding (S1):
the degree which the respondent claims to respond honestly;
Unreliable Responding (S2): the degree which the respondent
claims to respond dishonestly; Maintaining Good Image (S3):
looking good; Inconsistency (S4): discrepancy in responding
to identical items; Opposite Response Consistency (S5):
responding to items with similar meaning in a similar way;
and Infrequency (S6): endorsing items that describe infrequent
or odd behavior. There are three kinds of norms: junior-high
students, senior-high students, and university students/adults,
with each further classified into male and female norms.
According to the manual of the KMHQ (Ko, 1998), most of
the 38 scales (except three) had reliability coefficients (Cron-
bach's s) that ranged from .5 to .97. The author of the KMHQ
explained that the low reliability coefficients of some scales
were due to few items in each of these scales (Ko, 1998). The
test­retest reliability coefficients (30-40 days) for most of the
4 SAGE Open
scales were above .6. The validity of the 1998 version of the
KMHQ was investigated via differences between males and
females, comparison of healthy versus unhealthy groups, and
factor analysis. All these analyses supported the construct
validity of the measure (Ko, 1998). Lin and Huang (1998)
studied the validity of the KMHQ by using meta-analysis on
11 scales of the measure. The analysis comprised the data of
52 studies. They concluded that the extent of the KMHQ's
validity generalization was high and its discriminating capac-
ity among the various mental disorders was good. The 1998
version of the KMHQ was used in the current study. As there
has been no previous research on the utility of the validity
scales of the KMHQ in the detection of feigning psychosis, the
statistical analysis of this study focused on the six validity
scales and the raw scores of these scales were used for
computation.
HPH.The HPH is a Chinese multiscale personality inven-
tory for assessing psychological health and personality char-
acteristics in Taiwan. The HPH was first published in 1995
(Ko, 1995) and slightly revised in 1999 (Ko & Chang, 1999)
and 2003 (Ko & Chang, 2003), respectively. The items were
derived according to the clinical experience of the authors of
the HPH and in reference to the diagnostic criteria of mental
disorders described in the DSM system (Ko & Chang, 2003).
The purpose of the HPH varies conceptually from the
KMHQ. The items of the HPH are different from that of the
KMHQ. In the HPH, there are 256 items in total. There are
27 clinical scales and five validity scales. The validity scales
are labeled as Self-Rated Mentally Healthy (D5): I feel psy-
chologically well; Self-Rated Mentally Unhealthy (D6): I
feel psychologically poor; Self-Rated Reliable Responding
(D7): I am responding honestly; Self-Rated Unreliable
Responding (D8): I am responding dishonestly; and Infre-
quency (D9): I have uncommon behaviors different from the
normal population. The response of each item is scored on a
6-point rating scale, ranging from totally untrue to totally
true. There are five kinds of norms: junior-high students,
senior-high students, junior college students, university stu-
dents, and adults, with each further classified into male and
female norms. According to the manual of the HPH (Ko &
Chang, 2003), most of the scales had reliability coefficients
(Cronbach's s) above .6. The measure possessed good sta-
bility (1-month test­retest). The validity of the 2003 version
of the HPH was investigated via content analysis, differences
between males and females, comparison of clinical versus
normal groups, factor analysis, and correlations between the
HPH with the KMHQ, the Edwards Personal Preference
Schedule (EPPS), and the Interpersonal Behavior Survey
(IBS). All these analyses supported the construct validity of
this measure (Ko & Chang, 2003). The clinical validity of the
HPH was further investigated on a sample of patients diag-
nosed with schizophrenia, bipolar I disorder, major depres-
sive disorder, and anxiety disorders, respectively (Liu et al.,
2015). The results found that the HPH displayed satisfactory
discriminative power among the various mental disorders.
The latest 2003 version was used in the current study. As
there has been no previous research on the utility of the
validity scales of the HPH in the detection of feigning psy-
chosis, the statistical analysis of this study focused on the
five validity scales and the Z scores of these scales were used
for computation.
Procedure
When each participant arrived at the testing room, a coin
was tossed to decide which of the two groups, feigning
psychosis or honestly responding, to which the partici-
pants were assigned. In total, 40 participants (seven males
and 33 females) belonged to the feigning psychosis group
and 30 participants (12 males and 18 females) to the hon-
estly responding group. The participants in the feigning
psychosis group were coached by reading a two-page
description of schizophrenic symptoms. To ensure that the
participants understood and remembered the instructed
symptoms, a 10-item quiz was administered; correctly
responding on eight or more items was considered as sat-
isfying the manipulation check requirements. The coach-
ing procedure was repeated if the eight correct responses
were not achieved. All the participants in the feigning psy-
chosis group passed the manipulation check. The partici-
pants in the feigning psychosis group were instructed to
imagine that they had killed someone and were eager to
escape culpability by feigning psychosis. To enhance their
motivation of feigning, they were told that the two best
feigners would receive a monetary reward. The partici-
pants in the honestly responding group were asked to
respond honestly according to their present feelings and
thinking. Three multiscale personality inventories, that is,
the KMHQ, the HPH, and the Chinese MMPI-2, were
administered to each participant in this sequence. The par-
ticipants completed the testing in two separate sessions on
different days.
Statistical Analysis
Statistical analysis was implemented by using SPSS version
20 computer software. To examine the differences of the
scores of the scales of the three inventories, respectively,
between the two participant groups, MANOVA, t test, and
Cohen's d were computed. Receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) analysis and discriminant analysis were also con-
ducted to evaluate the accuracy of the scales of each inven-
tory in differentiating feigning psychosis and honestly
responding.
Results
To compare the means of the scores on the scales Fb, Fp, F-K,
Ds, and ICH of the MMPI-2 of the feigning psychosis and
Chang et al. 5
honestly responding groups, MANOVA was first conducted.
The Hotelling's trace was 8.79, F(5, 64) = 112.47, p < .001.
Accordingly, one-tailed t test was used on each of the scales.
The means, standard deviations, t tests, and Cohen's d of each
of the scores of the scales of the Chinese MMPI-2 of the two
participant groups are shown in Table 1. Similar procedures
in statistical analysis were implemented for the validity scales
of the KMHQ and the HPH. For MANOVA, the Hotelling's
trace for the KMHQ and the HPH were 1.73, F(6, 63) = 18.20,
p < .001, and 1.62, F(5, 64) = 20.74, p < .001, respectively.
The means, standard deviations, t tests, and Cohen's d of each
of the scores of the scales of the KMHQ and the HPH of the
two participant groups are shown in Tables 2 and 3.
The utility of the scales with significant t-test results of
each inventory in the detection of feigning psychosis was
examined with ROC analysis. The results, including the area
under curve (AUC), best cutoff scores, the percentages of
the participants correctly classified, sensitivity, and speci-
ficity, are shown in Tables 4 to 6. In addition, discriminant
analysis, with stepwise procedure, was conducted to explore
the best discriminant variables of each of these inventories,
respectively. For the Chinese MMPI-2, the Wilks's lambda
was .110, F(2, 67) = 272.33, p < .001. The best predictors
were Fp and Fb, while the classification accuracy rate was
97.1%. For the KMHQ and HPH, the Wilks's lambdas were
.379, F(2, 67) = 54.93, p < .001, and .384, F(2, 67) = 53.70,
p < .001, respectively. The best predictors were Infrequency
(S6) and Inconsistency (S4) for the KMHQ, with a classifi-
cation accuracy rate of 90.0%. With regard to the HPH, the
best predictors were Infrequency (D9) and Self-Rated
Mentally Unhealthy (D6), while the classification accuracy
rate was 91.4%.

Discussion
The results of this study supported the hypotheses that the
three multiscale personality inventories, namely, the Chinese
MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH, possessed effectiveness
in the detection of feigning psychosis. In fact, of the 16
detection scales analyzed in the current study, only two had
nonsignificant t-test results in comparing the means between
the feigning psychosis and honestly responding groups.
As this study appeared to be the first in investigating the
utility of the Chinese MMPI-2 in the detection of feigning
psychosis, it may be informative to compare the results of
this study with those using the English MMPI-2. To adhere
to academic strictness and simplicity, meta-analyses of the
MMPI-2 in the detection of feigned mental disorders were
reviewed (Nelson, Hoelzle, Sweet, Arbisi, & Demakis, 2010;
Nelson, Sweet, & Demakis, 2006; Rogers et al., 2003).
Rogers et al. (2003) reported effect sizes for simulators ver-
sus nonclinical controls and the mean cutoff scores of
various detection scales in the meta-analysis. Compared with
the results of Rogers et al. (2003), the effect sizes and clas-
sification rates of the scales Fb, Fp, F-K, and Ds were higher
in the present study using the Chinese MMPI-2, as shown in
Table 7. However, these comparisons were made between a
large sample (2,514 participants in the meta-analysis) and a
small sample (70 participants in the current study). The dif-
ferences in the statistical sample representation of the two
samples might lead to the above differences in the effect
sizes and classification rates of the Chinese versus English
MMPI-2. One other possibility might be the effects of coach-
ing the feigning psychosis group, which in turn enhanced the
differences between the feigning psychosis and honestly
responding groups. With regard to cutoff scores, all of them
except for Ds were also higher in the Chinese MMPI-2 than
those of the English MMPI-2. Previous studies have indi-
cated that test takers in the Chinese society generally seemed
to have higher MMPI-2 scores than those in the Western
societies (Cheung et al., 1991). This implies that cultural dif-
ferences would be one of the reasons for having higher cutoff
scores for the Chinese MMPI-2 compared with the English
MMPI-2. In other words, if clinicians conduct psychological
assessment and use measures which are translated from other
languages to Chinese, they should be familiar with research
on cultural differences and do not interpret the scores of the
measures only according to the studies in other cultures.
Another finding of this study was that, among the five
scales of the Chinese MMPI-2 in the statistical analysis, the
scales Fp and Fb appeared to be the best predictors in discrimi-
nating feigning psychosis from honestly responding. However,
ICH was a new scale created especially for the Chinese MMPI
and has also been used in the Chinese MMPI-2 (Cheung et al.,
1991). This pilot study seemed to be the first research to inves-
tigate its utility in the detection of feigning psychosis. Results
showed that, in addition to its high correlation with the Fb, Fp,
D-K, and Ds scales (r = .925 ~ .970, p < .001), ICH possessed

compatible discriminating ability, in terms of effect size and
classification accuracy rate, with all these well-validated indi-
ces of the English MMPI-2. This implies that ICH is a valid
scale for validity checking. Therefore, in addition to the scales
of the MMPI-2 which have already been examined thoroughly
in the detection of feigning psychosis, it is recommended that
the utility of ICH of the Chinese MMPI-2 should also be care-
fully investigated in future research.
Despite that this is the first pilot study on the utility of
the KMHQ and the HPH in the detection of feigning psy-
chosis, the results of this study seemed to be very encour-
aging. For the KMHQ, the scales Infrequency (S6) and
Inconsistency (S4) appeared to be the best predictors in
discriminating feigning psychosis from honestly respond-
ing, using discriminant analysis. Moreover, the validity
scale Maintaining Good Image (S3) also possessed good
accuracy with regard to effect size and classification rate.
For the HPH, the validity scales Infrequency (D9) and
Self-Rated Mentally Unhealthy (D6) were good discrimi-
nant variables in discriminating feigning psychosis from
honestly responding. However, besides relying on the
validity scales of the KMHQ and the HPH for the detection
of feigning psychosis, specific detection scales, such as Ds
of the MMPI-2, should be developed in the future.
Moreover, for the MMPI-2, detection models, which con-
sisted of algorithms integrating individual indices, have
been advocated to increase the accuracy of detecting
feigned mental disorders (Meyers et al., 2002; Rosenfeld,
Green, Pivovarova, & Dole, 2010; Steffan, Morgan, Lee,
& Sellbom, 2010). The development of the detection mod-
els of the KMHQ and the HPH might be another future
research direction.
From a clinical point of view, in this study on the detec-
tion of feigning psychosis, the scale with the largest effect
size, classification accuracy rate, sensitivity, and specificity
for the Chinese MMPI-2 was the Chinese Infrequency scale
(ICH). Similarly, for the KMHQ, the scale with the greatest
accuracy was the Infrequency scale (S6); for the HPH, it was
also the Infrequency scale (D9). All these three scales use the
detection strategy of rare symptoms. According to research,
this rare-symptom strategy is the main technique for assess-
ing feigned psychosis and has been shown to be a robust
method (Rogers, 2008a; Rogers et al., 2003). Future research
on the Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH may
focus on the effectiveness of other detection strategies such
as symptom severity, comparison of obvious and subtle
symptoms, and erroneous stereotypes.
There were several limitations in this study. First, the
sample size was small (N = 70). Second, the participants
had generally high education levels (M = 14.7 years). Third,
the comparison group consisted of healthy participants,
instead of psychiatric patients, without psychopathology.
Fourth, this was a simulation design study which lacked
ecological validity. Fifth, the participants were not ran-
domly selected from a base. Sixth, the incentives given to
the simulators might be an issue of confounding variable.
As a result, it should be cautious in the generalization of the
results of this study to other populations and much further
research is needed.
In conclusion, the results of this study supported the util-
ity of the Chinese MMPI-2, the KMHQ, and the HPH in the
detection of feigning psychosis in Taiwan. In addition, the
scales which are particularly useful in the detection were also
indicated for further study.
