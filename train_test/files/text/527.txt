resistance of Propionibacterium acnes to topical antibiotic
regimens has led to the need to re-evaluate the use of topical
antibiotics in the treatment of acne vulgaris. While the rate of
topical antibiotic monotherapy is declining, their use should be

If a clinician feels that antibiotics are a necessary component to acne
therapy, they should be used as part of a combination regimen.

Introduction
Topical regimens for acne have traditionally targeted multiple
points in the pathogenesis, including the use of topical antibiotics
such as erythromycin and clindamycin to address the role of
Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) (1). Unfortunately, over time
bacterial resistance develops when topical antibiotics are used as a
sole treatment (2).
Given the problems of resistant bacteria and given the avail-
ability of many other treatment options, should topical antibiotics
ever be prescribed as a monotherapy for acne? Topical antibiotics
can be administered concurrently with benzoyl peroxide to
decrease the rate of developing resistance, or other options
(topical retinoids, other combination regimens) could be used
to avoid the use of topical antibiotics alone (3). The purpose of
this study is to determine how frequently topical erythromycin
and topical clindamycin are used as monotherapy for acne.
Methods
The National Ambulatory Medical Care Survey (NAMCS) is a
nationally representative database documenting physician visits,
diagnoses, and prescribing habits from physicians who are not
federally employed. The database was sampled in regards to visits
in which the sole diagnosis of acne vulgaris (ICD-9-CM code
706.1) was made in the span from 1993 to 2010. Information
collected included physician specialty (dermatology vs. non-der-
matology) as well as medication prescribed (topical clindamycin
or erythromycin monotherapy vs. other). The data were analyzed
to determine the frequency of topical antibiotics as monotherapy
for acne vulgaris, the trends in prescribing of topical antibiotics
with or without benzoyl peroxide over the 18-year period, and
differences in prescribing habits between dermatologists and non-
dermatologists. We examined the use of topical antibiotics (clin-
damycin, erythromycin, sulfacetamide, or dapsone) together with
or without benzoyl peroxide, either in a combination product or
as separate products. All data analysis was performed using SAS
9.2 (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and the study was declared exempt
by the Wake Forest Baptist Hospital Institutional Review Board.
Results
Acne vulgaris was the sole diagnosis made in an estimated
69 million visits. Of these visits, topical erythromycin or clin-
damycin was the sole prescribed medication in 560 000 visits
(0.81%), with 336 000 (60%) of the prescriptions from dermatol-
ogists and 224 000 (40%) from non-dermatologists. Over time the
frequency of topical antibiotic monotherapy for acne vulgaris has
declined (p < 0.001), while the frequency of topical antibiotic
therapy combined with benzoyl peroxide had increased (Figures 1
and 2).
Discussion
Over time, antibiotics become less effective as bacteria develop the
means to evade destruction. As bacteria become resistant, they are
able to induce resistance in other bacteria by transferring plasmids
containing the resistance trait, rendering an antibiotic therapy
ineffective for more than just the initial condition (4,5). While
topical antibiotics were effective for acne in the past, the growing
development of resistance is decreasing their effectiveness and
raising concern that use for a common problem like acne could
result in more widespread resistance issues.

While P. acnes has been implicated in the pathogenesis of acne
vulgaris implying the need for antibiotics, recent data finds that
inflammation plays a much larger role in acne than previously
understood (1,4). For this reason, a treatment that focuses more
on combating inflammation rather than, or in addition to, a
limited antibiotic strategy should be considered (6).
If it is strongly felt, or preferred, by the physician for topical
antibiotics to be a part of the treatment regimen for acne vulgaris,
the concurrent use of benzoyl peroxide decreases the risk of
resistance development (7­9). Do we need topical antibiotic
monotherapy products? Topical benzoyl peroxide in a combina-
tion treatment with a topical antibiotic is more effective at
eliminating P. acnes and treating acne vulgaris than treatment
with either topical benzoyl peroxide or topical antibiotics alone
(10,11). However, the potential reduction in adherence with the
more complex two-drug regimen could offset the potential ther-
apeutic gain. Given the potential for poor adherence in patients
with acne, use of combination topical benzoyl peroxide­clinda-
mycin as a single product (available as a generic) or use of a
benzoyl peroxide-retinoid product may be appropriate.
Given the development of resistance as well as the efficacies of
other treatment options for acne, perhaps avoiding use topical
antibiotic monotherapy in acne could be considered as a quality
metric for dermatology.
