Injury Prevention 2006;12(Suppl II):ii28­ii32. doi: 10.1136/ip.2006.012443
Objectives: This article describes how seven states participating in a new public health surveillance system
for violent death in the US, the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS), have used data to
support local suicide prevention activities.
Setting: The NVDRS is unique in that it augments death certificate data with event and circumstance
information from death investigation reports filed by coroners, medical examiners, and law enforcement.
These data illuminate why the victim ended his or her life, fatal injury patterns, and toxicological findings at
death.
Results: Current suicide prevention efforts using these data fall into three categories: describing the
problem of suicide and identifying opportunities for intervention; collaborating on statewide suicide
prevention plans; and forming new partnerships for targeted prevention initiatives. Taken together, these
three areas show early promise for state suicide prevention efforts.
Conclusions: In each of the states, NVDRS data analyses are being shared with injury prevention
colleagues, suicide prevention planning groups and policymakers, and adapted to respond to unique state
and local suicide problems. A powerful surveillance tool, the NVDRS is bringing new clarity and direction
to these state-based efforts. The NVDRS can serve as a model for other countries looking to establish timely
suicide surveillance systems and data driven prevention strategies.
Suicide is the eighth leading cause of death among males
in the US, and the eleventh leading cause overall.1 Yet it
is only within the past couple of decades that suicide has
been framed as a preventable public health problem.2 The
Surgeon General's 1999 Call to action to prevent suicide3 and the
2001 National strategy for suicide prevention4 called for the
creation of surveillance systems to better define and track the
problem and guide and evaluate interventions. Responding to
this call, and backed by the Institute of Medicine's report,
Reducing suicide: a national imperative,5 which explicitly
recommended the adoption of the National Violent Death
Reporting System, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) established the NVDRS in 2002.
The NVDRS is currently implemented in 17 states.
Previously, death certificates were the only ongoing data
source on suicides, supplying limited information such as
decedent demographics, place and date of death, and method
of death. The NVDRS augments these data by linking to it
information from death investigation reports filed by
coroners, medical examiners, and law enforcement that
illuminate why the victim ended his or her life.6 Data include
toxicological test results; the victim's mental health and
treatment status; previous suicide attempts and threats; and
whether the victim was coping with problems involving
physical health, intimate partner relationships, school, work,
and other issues. The CDC contracts with a state agency
(usually the state health department) to collect the data
using software supplied by the CDC. The state agency
controls the manner in which the data are collected and
released locally and can add state defined data elements. The
data are forwarded to the CDC's national database stripped of
personally identifying information.
The systematic collection of state level data on the
precipitating circumstances associated with suicide was
unprecedented. In the late 1999s and early 2000s, most
states in the nation responded to the Surgeon General's call
to action by establishing statewide planning bodies to chart a
course for reducing suicide.7 The only local data to guide
these early efforts were death certificates; most states relied
on psychological autopsy studies conducted in other states or
other countries to describe risk factors and precipitating
circumstances.8
This article describes how the more detailed state level data
made available by the NVDRS have been used thus far in
seven states that were early adopters of the NVDRS: Alaska,
Colorado, Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, South Carolina,
and Virginia. Alaska and Colorado began data collection in
2004; the others in 2003. Because these systems are still in
the relatively early phases of data collection and analysis,
their suicide prevention efforts currently fall into three areas:
1. describing the problem of suicide and identifying
opportunities for intervention;
2. collaborating on statewide suicide prevention plans; and
3. forming new partnerships for targeted prevention
initiatives.
CASE DEFINITION
The case definition for data noted throughout this paper is
decedents who were residents of one of the seven NVDRS
states, who died during the data collection year (2004 for
Alaska and Colorado, 2003 for the remainder), and whose
death certificate indicated an underlying cause of death in
the suicide category (codes X60­X84, Y87.0, or U03 of the
International Classification of Disease, 10th Revision, US
version). We used the Pearson x2 statistic when comparing
the proportion of victim groups for whom various circum-
stances were endorsed.

DESCRIBING THE STATE SUICIDE PROBLEM AND
IDENTIFYING OPPORTUNITIES FOR INTERVENTION
The NVDRS data enable states to examine the demographic
characteristics of the groups at highest risk for suicide in the
state (table 1) as well as those circumstances preceding
suicide that may assist in tailoring prevention strategies
(figs 1 and 2).
Nationally, 2003 marked the first year in which the age
adjusted suicide rate among mid-life adults ages 35­64 (15.0
per 100 000) surpassed that of elders 65 and over (14.6 per
100 000).1 The age distribution of suicide risk varies locally,
however, and in some of the NVDRS states, elder suicide
rates continued to outstrip that of younger age groups
(table 1). Oregon had the sixth highest elder suicide rate in
the nation;1 Oregon VDRS personnel examined the circum-
stances noted in elders' death investigation reports and
learned that most were coping with a physical health
problem and that 37% had visited a physician in the last
30 days (fig 1). While psychological autopsy studies are
divided on whether physical illness is an independent risk
factor for suicide after controlling for depressive illness,9 the
finding does suggest the critical role that healthcare providers
can play in screening for, and responding to, suicide risk.
Mid-life adult men make up the largest number of suicide
decedents, and strategies for reaching out to this group have
not yet been well developed.10 The Colorado site investigated
the occupations of decedents and found that construction
was the most frequently noted industry, accounting for 14%
of the state's 776 suicide victims ages 18 and older (male and
female) in 2004. This suggests that unions and construction
employers may serve as potential new partners for targeting
this population. Also in Colorado, 30 suicide victims aged 18
and older died either during attempted arrest, while under
arrest or while in jail or prison, suggesting the need to work
with law enforcement and criminal justice personnel on
minimizing suicide risk.
The Virginia site's report on 2003 deaths noted that,
overall, one in four suicide decedents had served in the armed
services and, among males ages 65 or over, nearly 60% were
veterans. Although veterans did not appear to be over-
represented among suicide decedents (61% of US men over
the age of 65 are veterans), the finding does suggest a venue
(veteran's hospitals and services) for reaching older men to
screen for suicide risk. For instance, the Virginia Department
of Veteran's Services reported 17 194 hospital admissions and
733 851 outpatient visits by veterans for fiscal year 2005;
these numbers represent a profound potential for assess-
ments and referrals for suicide prevention (personal com-
munication with Fred Fralin, Benefits Services Manager,
Virginia Department of Veterans' Services, 26 June 2006).
Maryland's VDRS data suggest the need for different
prevention strategies for women and men. Both the highest
rates and the largest number of female victims were those
aged 45­59. Among women and men aged 45­59 for whom
the death investigation report provided at least partial
information on circumstances associated with the suicide
(38 of the 39 women and 87 of the 95 men), a higher
proportion of women than men were noted as being in
current mental health treatment (p,0.01). These findings
suggest that interventions focused on improving mental
healthcare are an indicated strategy for women in this age
group, but relying solely on that strategy for men may miss a
significant portion of potential victims.
Victims who have not previously come to the attention of
the mental healthcare system pose a unique challenge to
suicide prevention. The New Jersey VDRS project investigated
who these victims are. Among New Jersey cases about which
circumstance information was available, there was no
documentation of a mental health disorder or a previous
suicide attempt in over 40% of the cases. These suicides
differed from those for whom a previous mental health
history was documented in several important ways: they
were more likely to occur among non-whites and the foreign-
born and were more likely to be committed with a firearm.
These findings are being shared with suicide prevention
policymakers in the state.
COLLABORATING ON STATEWIDE STRATEGIC
PLANS FOR SUICIDE PREVENTION
One objective of the National strategy for suicide prevention was
to increase the number of states with a comprehensive
suicide plan in order to focus intervention efforts, resources,
and funding. Six of the seven NVDRS states that are the
subject of this paper have released suicide prevention plans,
and the seventh is in the process of developing one with the
assistance of NVDRS data.7 Three of the state's plans focus
only on youth suicide, but at least two of these are currently
developing plans for other age groups, again with the
assistance of NVDRS data. Particularly in these early stages
of data collection and report release, surveillance data from
the NVDRS are re-energizing the planning process in several
states.
Collaborations between NVDRS sites and statewide suicide
prevention groups were strongest among the first-wave
NVDRS adopters (Maryland, New Jersey, Oregon, South
Carolina, Virginia), as most of these had already released
reports on their 2003 cases.
For example, in Oregon where suicides outnumbered
homicides nearly 6-to-1 in 2003, suicide prevention is a

priority. While Oregon had already developed a youth suicide
prevention plan, it released the Oregon Older Adult Suicide
Prevention Plan in early 2006. Oregon's VDRS data and
personnel took a lead role in defining the scope and
characteristics of this plan. The Oregon site has added state
defined data elements to the system, such as the date of the
victim's last physician visit, in response to local planning
needs. Oregon has also released a fact sheet on elder suicide.
Like Oregon, Virginia had already released a youth suicide
prevention plan for the state. The Virginia VDRS site is a
member of the group that is now developing the state's
lifespan approach to suicide prevention. Virginia is a 2005
recipient of federal Garret Lee Smith Memorial Act funds for
youth suicide prevention, and the NVDRS site is supplying
data to assist in planning interventions.
New Jersey's VDRS program is immersed in a wide
network of suicide prevention collaborations and is recog-
nized as a critical resource for collaborative work on suicide
prevention. New Jersey has not previously released a state
plan and is currently developing a lifespan suicide prevention
plan. NVDRS data are being used in that effort. Preliminary
data from the New Jersey VDRS were used by the New Jersey
team when they participated in the Suicide Prevention
Resource Center's Bi-Regional Suicide Prevention
Conference in June 2005. This conference was geared
towards assisting states in developing their plans.
In South Carolina, data collection started with year 2003
deaths and immediately began to impact suicide prevention
in the state. Preliminary data were used in the South Carolina
Suicide Prevention Strategic Plan, which was released in
June 2005. The overall focus of the plan is to increase public
awareness of suicide as a public health problem. The State
Suicide Prevention Strategic Plan led to formation of the
South Carolina Suicide Prevention Coalition. NVDRS staff in
South Carolina and the State Department of Health and
Environmental Control participate in this new Coalition.
FORMING NEW PARTNERSHIPS FOR TARGETED
PREVENTION INITIATIVES
The final use of NVDRS data is in sparking new or renewed
partnerships between NVDRS agencies and other state or
local agencies focused on suicide or violence prevention.
These new partnerships put surveillance data into the hands
of subject matter experts who apply them in developing or
evaluating interventions.
Alaska's VDRS initiatives will assist researchers and injury
prevention specialists in three areas. The first is the firearm
locker installation program, which is conducted jointly by
Harborview Injury Prevention and the Alaska Tribal Native
Health Consortium-Injury Prevention Programs. The suicide
rate in Alaska is among the highest in the nation, and is
particularly high (53 per 100 000) among American Indians/
Alaskan natives. Since many high risk populations in Alaska
participate in subsistence and sport hunting, the firearm
locker installation program has two functions: to prevent
accidental discharge by a youth and to hinder easy access to
loaded firearms during chemical intoxication and/or a mental
health crisis. Second, the Alaska Departments of Law and
Public Safety is collaborating with the Alaska VDRS project to
provide expanded analyses and more specific data on the
environment, weapons, and victim/perpetrator histories in
domestic violence related death events. A dangerous time for
a victim of intimate partner abuse is when she or he is
attempting to leave the relationship. As legislative statutes
and regulations are developed, evaluated, and modified in the
area of domestic violence, this partnership will identify
strategies that are most effective in protecting victims of
abuse. Third, the Alaska VDRS data will be used to
complement forensic data from suicide cases as part of the
Alaska Suicide Follow-Back Study. Designed as a psycholo-
gical autopsy study to review circumstances leading to a
suicide attempt, including review of medical and school
records, this study is being conducted by the Alaska Injury
Prevention Center through the Alaska Statewide Suicide
Prevention Council
Virginia's VDRS project is taking advantage of the incident-
based feature of the NVDRS to describe multiple victim
incidents, such as murder-suicides, homicides with multiple
victims, and suicide pacts. Of the 39 multiple victim death
events identified for 2003, 18 were family or intimate partner
homicides, and in 14 of these the suspect also took his own
life. Using these data as a springboard, collaborations are
now underway between VDRS project staff and the Virginia
Sexual and Domestic Violence Action Alliance to use
Virginia's VDRS data to understand the dynamics of
murder-suicides and intimate partner violence perpetration.
Also in Virginia, publication of a statistical overview of
Virginia's VDRS data from 2003 has prompted requests for
detailed community level portraits of suicide victims,
circumstances, and mechanisms of injury to assist localities
in understanding and preventing suicide in their own
communities. This Virginia Department of Health collabora-
tive effort is between NVDRS staff in the Office of the Chief
Medical Examiner and the Center for Injury and Violence
Prevention.
LIMITATIONS
NVDRS data on the circumstances that precede suicide
depend upon the completeness and quality of the death
investigation reports from which they are drawn. Coroners,
medical examiners, and law enforcement vary from one
jurisdiction to the next and from one individual to the next in
the types of questions they ask during a death investigation,
who they ask, and whether and how thoroughly they record
the information. What may appear to be, for example, a
higher treatment rate among victims in one jurisdiction over
another may in fact reflect one medical examiner's office
more thorough documentation than another's. It is impor-
tant, therefore, particularly as the system grows to a 50-state
system, to work toward greater uniformity in death
investigation procedures and documentation. As NVDRS
sites apply the data to local injury problems and share results
with the death investigators who supplied the data, this
should become easier to do.
CONCLUSION
Taken together, these three areas of use for NVDRS data--
better describing the problem and identifying opportunities
for prevention, revitalizing strategic planning processes
within states, and forging new partnerships for prevention
initiatives--show early promise for state suicide prevention
efforts. In each of these seven states, NVDRS data analyses
are being shared with injury prevention colleagues, suicide
prevention planning groups and policymakers, and are being
adapted to respond to unique suicide problems. A powerful
surveillance tool, the NVDRS is bringing new clarity and
direction to these state based efforts.
At the same time, the need for suicide prevention strategies
on the international level has been recognized. The World
Health Organization (WHO) describes suicide as a largely
preventable public health problem and has acknowledged
that greater reliability is needed in suicide reporting within
countries.11 This is one of the components of WHO's suicide
prevention (SUPRE) program, a worldwide initiative that
also seeks to break down the barriers to talking about suicide
in order to prevent it. In its Guidelines for suicide prevention, the
International Association of Suicide Prevention notes great
variation in quality and availability of suicide data by country

and that results to date indicate differences in demographic
characteristics and methods of suicide between countries.12
Implemented internationally, the NVDRS initiative could be a
valuable tool for providing information useful for framing
effective suicide prevention strategies within countries,
creating databases for international comparisons, and serving
as a model for countries in developing data infrastructure and
basic surveillance strategies.

Key points
N Data from the National Violent Death Reporting System
(NVDRS) are being used to shape suicide prevention
efforts at state and local levels.
N Because these data describe victim characteristics and
link these with suicide event characteristics, the NVDRS
assists localities in clarifying their unique problems with
suicide.
N Planning groups are relying on NVDRS data to craft or
refine suicide prevention plans.
N NVDRS data findings are creating new partnerships for
targeted suicide prevention initiatives.
