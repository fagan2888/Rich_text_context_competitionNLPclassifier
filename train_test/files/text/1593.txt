Objective. To explore the relation between 25-hydroxy-
vitamin D deficiency and frailty. Frailty is a multi-
dimensional phenotype that describes declining
physical function and a vulnerability to adverse out-
comes in the setting of physical stress such as illness
or hospitalization. Low serum concentrations of
25-hydroxyvitamin D are known to be associated
with multiple chronic diseases such as cardiovascu-
lar disease and diabetes, in addition to all cause
mortality.
Design. Using data from the Third National Health and
Nutrition Survey (NHANES III), we evaluated the
associationbetween low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentration and frailty, defined according to a set
of criteria derived from a definition previously
describedandvalidated.
Subjects. Nationally representative survey of noninsti-
tutionalized US residents collected between 1988
and1994.
Results. 25-Hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, defined as a
serum concentration <15 ng mL)1, was associated
with a 3.7-fold increase in the odds of frailty amongst
whites and a fourfold increase in the odds of frailty
amongst non-whites. This association persisted after
sensitivity analyses adjusting for season of the year
andlatitude ofresidence,intended to reducemisclas-
sification of persons as 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-
cientorinsufficient.
Conclusion. Low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-
trations are associated with frailty amongst older
adults.

Introduction
Frailty is a multidimensional phenotype that
describes declining physical function and a vulnera-
bility to adverse health outcomes in the setting of
physical stress such as illness or hospitalization
[1­5]. Multiple instruments to operationalize a defini-
tion of frailty have been developed and validated [1].
One such index, proposed by Fried and colleagues,
defines frailty as the presence of three or more of five
criteria: unintentional weight loss, exhaustion,
weakness,slowwalkingspeedandlowphysicalactiv-
ity [4]. Using the Fried criteria, estimates of the preva-
lence of frailty amongst independently living adults
varyfrom7%ofpersonsolder than 65 yearsto 40% of
persons older than 80 years; prevalence estimates
are higher amongst persons with diabetes and other
chronic debilitating diseases [2­4, 6]. Frailty, using
this definition, is associated with increased risk
of falls, hospitalization, disability and death [4].
However, diagnosing frailty in the clinical setting can
be cumbersome because most indices of frailty re-
quire a combination of anthropometry and physical
functiontesting.
Serum concentrations of 25-hydroxyvitamin D are
known to decline with age. Moreover, rates of 25-
hydoxyvitamin D deficiency are higher amongst
groups that are at high risk for poor physical func-
tioning: older individuals, women and non-whites
[7­9]. Our prior work has described higher rates of
frailty amongst non-whites and women [10]. 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D deficiency is also associated with
debilitating chronic diseases, such as hypertension,
chronic kidney disease, insulin resistance and diabe-
tes, obesity, and cardiovascular disease, as well as
other age-related conditions that may influence
physical functioning, such as macular degeneration
andosteopenia[9,11­19].

A small number of studies have previously evaluated
the relation between low serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
and frailty, but these studies have been in disease-
limited patient populations or have employed
nonstandard definitions of frailty [20­22]. We
hypothesized that 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency
would be associated with frailty in older adults, inde-
pendent of the associations seen amongst frailty,
advanced age and chronic medical conditions, and
that the association between frailty and 25-hydroxy-
vitaminD woulddifferbyrace.
Methods
Datasource
We obtained individual level data from the Third Na-
tional Health and Nutrition Evaluation Survey
(NHANES III), a nationally representative survey of
the health status of persons residing in the United
States (US) collected between 1988 and 1994.
NHANES III is a cross-sectional, multistage, strati-
fied, clustered probability sample of the US civilian
noninstitutionalized population conducted by the
National Center for Health Statistics, a branch of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
[23]. The purpose of NHANES is to determine the
prevalence of major diseases and potential risk fac-
tors for diseases in the general US population.
NHANES conducts both interviews and physical
examinations. The interview includes demographic,
socioeconomic, dietary andhealth-related questions.
The examination is conducted at a mobile evaluation
center (MEC) or the participant's home and consists
of medical, dental, and physiological measurements,
as well as laboratory tests administered by highly
trained medical personnel. The Institutional Review
Board for the CDC approved NHANES III and all par-
ticipantsprovidedwrittenconsent.Thepresentstudy
was granted exempt status by the Institutional Re-
viewBoard ofStanfordUniversitySchoolofMedicine.
Studysample
We identified all participants who completed an
NHANES interview between 1988 and 1994
(n = 33 198). We limited the study population to per-
sons aged 60 years or older at the time of their
NHANES examination whohad 25-hydroxyvitamin D
data available (n = 5335). We excluded persons for
whom sufficient data to assess frailty (described be-
low) were unavailable (n = 7). Persons who chose to
be examined in their homes rather than in an MEC
were eligible for phlebotomy including an assay for
serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D. A large fraction of home
examined persons (66%) were missing 25-hydroxyvi-
tamin D data; thus, we excluded home examined
persons from our primary analysis. Home examined
participants (n = 422) were more likely to be older
(mean age 77.8 years) and non-Hispanic white and
more likely to have multiple comorbidities than those
examined in an MEC. The analytic dataset included
theremaining5048persons(Fig.1).
Frailty
Wedefined frailty based ona modificationof the Fried
criteria [4]. Our definition adheres to the five frailty
domains previously established, but customizes the
criteriaforapplicationtoNHANESIII data [10].
1 Low body weight for height, defined as Quetelet's
(bodymass)index£18.5 kg m)2.
2 Slow walking, defined as the slowest quintile
adjusted forsex,ina timed8-footwalk.
3 Weakness, defined as present if participants
answered `somedifficulty,' `muchdifficulty,' or`un-
able to do' when asked how much difficulty they
have `lifting or carrying something as heavy as ten
pounds(likea sackofpotatoesorrice).'
4 Exhaustion, defined as present if participants an-
swered `some difficulty,' `much difficulty,' or `un-
able to do' when asked how much difficulty they
have `walking from one room to the other on the
same level.'

5 Low physical activity, defined as present if partici-
pants answered `less active' when asked `Com-
pared with most (men/women) your age, would
you say that you are more active, less active or
aboutthesame?'
We included persons with available data for three or
more frailty domains in our analysis. If three or more
domains were present according to the above criteria,
the person was considered frail for the purposes of
ouranalysis.
25-HydroxyvitaminD
All NHANES participants over the age of 12 years
were eligible for measurement of serum 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D concentration. Blood samples collected in
theMECwerecentrifugedandserumwasdividedinto
aliquots and stored at )70 °C until they were shipped
on dry ice to a central laboratory, where they were
stored at )70 °C until analysis. Analysis was per-
formed using the DiaSorin radioimmune assay kit
(Stillwater, MN, USA) to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin
Dwitha lower limitofdetection of3.5 ng mL)1.
For reasons related to the convenience and safety of
MEC staff, survey participants living in northeastern
andupper midwesternstates wereprimarily sampled
between April and September. Survey participants
living in southern states were sampled throughout
the year with the majority of sampling occurring be-
tweenOctoberandApril[23].
We used conventional definitions of 25-hydroxyvita-
min D deficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D con-
centration <15 ng mL)1) and 25-hydroxyvitamin D
insufficiency (serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-
trationof15to <30 ng mL)1).
Otherexplanatoryvariables
We ascertained participant race based on self-report
and classified participants as `white' or `non-white'
(includes participants of black and all other races).
We estimated socioeconomic status (SES) using the
poverty income ratio (PIR) which is based on income
thresholds from the US Census Bureau that vary by
family size and composition. We considered partici-
pants with PIR values <2.00 to be of low SES; we con-
sidered participants with PIR values 2.00 to be of
highSES.
We considered participants to have diabetes if a phy-
sician had informed them that they had diabetes or if
they recorded a haemoglobin A1c 6%. We consid-
ered participants to have evidence of liver disease
if they recorded an aspartate aminotransferase
(AST) >37 U L)1 or alanine aminotransferase (ALT)
>40 U L)1 for men and either AST or ALT >31 U L)1
for women. We defined chronic kidney disease as
either prevalent micro- or macro-albuminuria (de-
fined as a single urinary albumin-to-creatinine ratio
30 mg g)1) in the presence of a normal estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR, calculated using the
Mayo quadratic equation) or an eGFR <60 mL min)1
per 1.73 m2 [24, 25]. We considered participants to
have peripheral arterial disease if they reported activ-
ity-related calf pain that was relieved with rest. Simi-
larly, we considered participants to have coronary
artery disease if they reported activity-related chest
pain that was relieved with rest, or if they reported a
prior myocardial infarction. We identified partici-
pants with arthritis, cancer, chronic lung disease,
congestive heart failure or history of stroke based on
self-reported physician diagnosis. We considered the
presence of one or more of peripheral arterial disease,
coronary artery disease, heart failure or stroke as
`overt cardiovascular disease.' Blood pressure was
measured according to a protocol described else-
where; hypertension was defined according to the
Seventh Report of the Joint National Committee on
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
HighBloodPressure guidelines[26,27].
Statisticalanalysis
We conducted data analysis with sas, version 9.1.3
(SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC, USA), accounting for
oversampling, stratification and clustering [28].
Becauseserum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations
differ widely by race, we conducted race stratified
analyses (white and non-white) for frailty. We con-
trolledfordemographicfactors (age, sex, and poverty,
as described above) as well as seven comorbidities
(diabetes, history ofnondermatologic cancer, chronic
lung disease, chronic liver disease, chronic kidney
disease, overt cardiovascular disease and arthritis);
only chronic lung disease was not significantly asso-
ciated with frailty and was removed from our model.
For the discrete frailty outcome, we performed multi-
variable logistic regression adjusting for sociodemo-
graphic factors and comorbid conditions that were
associated with frailty at P < 0.20 in bivariate analy-
ses. In logistic regression models, we assessed
discrimination using the area under the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve and we as-
sessed calibration using the Hosmer­Lemeshow
goodness-of-fit test. The Hosmer­Lemeshow test

compares model performance (observed versus
expected) across deciles of risk, to test whether the
model is biased (i.e., performs differentially at the
extremes of risk). A nonsignificant value for the Hos-
mer­Lemeshowv2 suggestsanabsenceofsuchbias.
Because serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentra-
tions vary by season of the year and by latitude,
persons may be misclassified with vitamin D defi-
ciency or insufficiency depending on the time of
year that measurements were made. Further com-
plicating matters, the NHANES strategy of sampling
persons living in colder climates primarily in the
summer months and persons living in warmer cli-
mates primarily in the winter months also raised
concern for misclassification bias. We addressed
these complexities in the following manner: for the
primary analysis, we excluded season and latitude.
This nai
¨ve and analytically conservative approach
assumes that the measured concentration of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D reflects the participants' time-
averaged 25-hydroxyvitamin D exposure. However,
participants measured during July in Minnesota,
for example, might be misclassified as having high-
er 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations than their
time-averaged exposure. Therefore, we conducted
the following sensitivity analyses:
1 Seasonally adjusted 25-hydroxyvitamin D: using
data from persons residing in states grouped into the
census region of the South (Fig. 2), we created a
regression model that allowed us to adjust for month
of 25-hydroxyvitamin D measurement. The South
was chosen because it was the only census region in
which data were collected year-round. We then
applied that model to persons residing in other
regions and created race-stratified logistic regression
models, as in the primary analysis, using seasonally
adjusted 25-hydroxyvitaminD.
2 Latitudeadjusted25-hydroxyvitaminD:For survey
participants residing in counties with over 500 000
inhabitants, the county name is available in the
NHANES III dataset. Using data from the US Census
Bureau, we created a dichotomous latitude variable
to sort these participants into those living at latitudes
>40° andthoseliving at latitudes £40° (Fig. 2). Wecre-
ated a separate logistic regression model to estimate
the odds of frailty associated with living in northern
states.
Results
Of the 33 994 NHANES III participants, 5048 partici-
pants met inclusion criteria (Fig. 1). Study sample is
described in Table 1. The distribution of serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D concentrations amongst whites
and non-whites is shown in Fig. 3. Mean values were
significantlyloweramongstnon-whites [22.0 (0.6)vs.
28.2 (0.3)ng mL)1, P < 0.0001].
25-Hydroxyvitamin Dand frailty
Serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was associated with
frailty in both whites and non-whites. Amongst
whites, 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was associ-
ated with a significant increase in the odds of frailty,
even after adjustment for age (stratified by decade),
sex and comorbidities (Table 2). 25-hydroxyvitamin
D insufficiency was not associated with the odds of
frailty amongst whites. Amongst non-whites, both
25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and insufficiency
were associated with a significant increase in the
oddsoffrailty(Table 3).
Seasonallyadjusted25-hydroxyvitamin D
Figure 4 shows the distribution of 25-hydroxyvita-
min D concentrations by calendar month amongst
participants residing in Southern states. From the
regression model we developed, we derived a `cor-
rection factor' for each month of the year which
was then applied to survey participants residing
in the other regions of the country (Fig. 4). Our
corrected values resulted in 794 persons being
reclassified in the following manner: 180 moved
from deficient to insufficient; 191 from insufficient
to deficient; 202 from insufficient to normal; and
176 from normal to insufficient. Corresponding
odds of frailty for seasonally adjusted 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D deficiency and insufficiency for whites
were 2.7 (95% CI 1.6­4.6) and 0.9 (0.5­1.7) and
for non-whites were 2.4 (0.9­6.3) and 2.2
(1.1­4.4).

Amongst whites living north of 40°, 6.2% were frail,
compared to 4.1% residing south of 40°. Amongst
non-whites living north of 40°, 10.4% were frail, as

frailty even when controlling for measured 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D concentration, age, sex, SES and
comorbidities, indicating probable misclassification
of25-hydroxyvitaminD statusbya single25-hydrox-
yvitamin D determination. Amongst non-whites, the
odds of frailty associated with living in the northern
latitudes were nominally increased but not statisti-
cally significant (P = 0.5). These results are summar-
ized inTable 4.
Discussion
Using data from a nationally representativesample of
older adults, we found serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D
concentration to be associated with frailty. Amongst
whites, 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency was associ-
ated with a threefold increase in the odds of frailty;
the odds of frailty were even higher amongst non-
whites with 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency. 25-hy-
droxyvitamin D insufficiency was also associated
withfrailtyamongstnon-whites.
Two recent studies described a high prevalence of
25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency (and insufficiency)
in the general population, with higher rates in older
persons and racial and ethnic minorities [7, 8]. Other
studies have noted strong associations amongst
25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency, mortality and a
variety of morbidities. For example, using data from
NHANES III, Melamed and colleagues showed that
adults with vitamin D deficiency experienced a 26%
increased risk in all-cause mortality over a 10-year
follow-up period [14]. Similarly, researchers in the
Netherlands demonstrated an increased rate of nurs-
ing home admission in older adults with vitamin D
deficiency [29]. These results may be unsurprising
given the well-known association between 25-
hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and numerous chronic
diseases. For example, 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-
ciency is associated increased risks of diabetes [11,
14, 30]andhypertension[12,14].
In addition to the association between 25-hydroxyvi-
tamin D deficiency and chronic disease, there are
other potential connections between 25-hydroxyvita-
min D status and frailty. 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-
ciency may result in proximal muscle weakness,
which could limit a person's capacity to maintain lev-
els of physical activity and/ or performance [31, 32].

weakness may relate to the binding of 1,25-
dihydroxyvitamin D,the activatedform of25-hydrox-
yvitamin D, on nuclear receptors in skeletal muscle
cells, resulting in increased protein synthesis and
muscle cell growth [33, 34]. Consistent with this
observation,numerousstudiesdemonstrateareduc-
tionintheriskoffallsfollowingvitaminDsupplemen-
tation. A recent meta-analysis, which combined
results from five randomized controlled trials, con-
cluded that vitamin D supplementation may reduce
the risk of falls amongst older persons by 20% [35].
Even more striking, recent results from Moreira-
Pfrimer and colleagues, demonstrate that vitamin D
supplementation in older adults may increased lower
extremity strength [36].
The association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D and
frailty could reflect factors relating 25-hydroxyvita-
min D to health status, or could reflect `reverse
causality.' In other words, frail older adults may
spend fewer hours outdoors than more physically
able older adults, not gaining the benefits of
conversion of 7-dehydrocholesterol (in skin) to chole-
calciferol by ultraviolet B radiation. Because home-
examined NHANES participants were excluded from
our analysis, confounding bydifferences insun expo-
sure may have been mitigated, albeit not eliminated
or adequately controlled for. The fact that latitude
was associated with frailty after accounting for a sin-
gle 25-hydroxyvitamin D determination suggests
residual confounding by sun exposure. However,
even if the association we describe between frailty
and 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentration is mediated
by differences in sun exposure amongst frail and
robust older adults, this observation does not negate
the possibility that vitamin D supplementation may
protectorrestore physicalfunctioninginfrailpeople.
Recent reports suggest that the prevalence of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D deficiency is increasing in the
US. In fact, an analysis comparing rates of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D deficiency between NHANES
samples from 1988 to 1994 and those from 2001 to
2004 showed a clear trend towards lower serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations across all
demographic groups, with an especially worrisome
increase in the rate of 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-
ciency amongst blacks [7]. Given our findings of a
strong association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D
deficiency and frailty, the increased prevalence of
25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency and deficiency
are particularly problematic as our population ages.

Potential differences in the association of 25-
hydroxyvitamin D with frailty by race, i.e., some-
what stronger associations at lower threshold
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations for non-white
participants, highlight the need to consider race
when assessing optimal vitamin D status.
Atleastthreerecentstudieshaveevaluated thepossi-
ble association between 25-hydroxyvitamin D defi-
ciency and frailty. Boxer et al. reported that amongst
persons with systolic heart failure, low serum 25-
hydroxyvitamin D predicted a higher frailty score
[21]. Puts et al. report a significant association be-
tween lower serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D and frailty
amongst persons older than 65, but employ an alter-
nate definition of frailty that bears little resemblance
to the Fried criteria [20]. Shardell et al. demonstrated
an association between low serum 25-hydroxyvita-
min D and frailty amongst persons older than 65 in a
general population cohort, but only amongst men.
Moreover, this study made no apparent attempt to
controlforseasonofblood collection[22].
Our study's strengths include analysis of a nationally
representative sample of US adults with robust
recruitment of persons older than 80 years. We also
adjusted for a wide array of sociodemographic fac-
tors, comorbid conditions and environmental factors
that might have confounded the vitamin D-frailty
relation. Our study also carries a few important
limitations. First, NHANES III data are primarily
cross-sectional and we were unable to follow serum
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations over time. Sec-
ondly, 25-hydroxyvitamin D data were missing in
more than half of home-examined participants and
were therefore excluded from our primary analysis.
Since these home-examined participants tended to
have more comorbidity than participants examined
in mobile units, we have probably underestimated
the population prevalence of frailty (and 25-hydrox-
yvitaminD deficiency).
An additional challenge of our study was the com-
plexity of the NHANES sampling scheme whereby
northern dwelling survey participants were sampled
primarily in the summer months and residents of
southern states were sampled year-round with an
emphasis on the winter months. This sampling
scheme had the potential to increase misclassifica-
tion of 25-hydroxyvitamin D insufficient and defi-
cientparticipants.Wewere reassuredthattheresults
of our two sensitivity analyses, aimed at addressing
this potential misclassification, qualitatively con-
firmed the results from our primary analysis. Using
seasonally adjusted 25-hydroxyvitamin D concen-
trations, we found a nearly threefold increase in the
odds of frailty amongst whites with 25-hydroxyvita-
min D deficiency and a greater than twofold increase
in the odds of frailty amongst non-whites with 25-
hydroxyvitamin D insufficiency. The slightly lower
odds of frailty in the seasonally adjusted analysis as
compared to the primary analysis may appear coun-
ter intuitive if, as we expect, seasonal adjustment of
25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations reduces mis-
classification of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and
insufficiency. However, because persons living in
northern states were sampled in the summer, those
persons classified as 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficient
using 25-hydroxyvitamin D concentrations not cor-
rected for season were the most `deficient of the defi-
cient.' For this reason, the association between 25-
hydroxyvitamin D deficiency and frailty appeared
stronger in the primary analysis. In effect, some par-
ticipants at the upper end of the deficient range were
misclassified as `insufficient' in the base case analy-
sis. With re-classification in the seasonally adjusted

analysis, the odds of frailty associated with 25-hy-
droxyvitaminD deficiencywere attenuated.
It is also relevant to note that our seasonally
adjusted analysis applied an adjustment based
exclusively on residents of the southern census
region on other census regions. This method for
seasonal adjustment has an obvious limitation,
namely that southern seasonal adjustment may
introduce novel bias to 25-hydroxyvitamin D mea-
surements in participants living in other census re-
gions. This bias could take several potential forms.
For example, residents in the hot, more humid
south may plausibly spend less time outside during
the summer months (rather, choosing indoor air-
conditioned settings) than residents of more north-
ern latitudes where the weather is more temperate.
Therefore, the relative increase in summer sun
exposure may be attenuated in the south compared
with other regions. Unfortunately, it was not possi-
ble to create a model for seasonal adjustment based
on data from all four census regions.
Similarly, our secondary analysis in the subset of
participants for whomlatitude ofresidencewasavail-
able also qualitatively confirmed the results of our
primary analysis. The latitude adjusted analysis
showed a greater than fivefold increase in the odds of
frailty amongst whites with 25-hydroxyvitamin D
deficiencyand a greater than threefold increaseinthe
odds of frailty amongst non-whites with 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D deficiency. Whilst we believe that our
sensitivity analyses suggest a robust association
between vitamin D deficiency and frailty, there is
likely to be residual confounding by several factors
for which we could not adjust, including dietary 25-
hydroxyvitamin D intake, sun exposure (beyond that
accounted for by month of evaluation and latitude),
melanin content in skin (beyond what is accounted
for by self-reported race), and the use (and type) of
sunscreen.
The intersection of 25-hydroxyvitamin D deficiency
and ageing is an important area of research with
much that remains to be studied. In the future,
researchers should focus on longitudinal data
that demonstrate how 25-hydroxyvitamin D status
changes over time in older adults who are ageing well
and in those who are ageing poorly. In addition, fur-
therstudiesshouldinvestigatewhetherinterventions
to correct deficiency and insufficiency of 25-hydrox-
yvitamin D status, such as supplementation and/ or
sun exposure, could reduce frailty or improve physi-
calfunctioninginfrailpersons.
