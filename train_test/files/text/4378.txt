Interest in globalization over the last several decades has
prompted extensive related research and publication in the
fields of, economics, political science, sociology, public
health, geography, anthropology, education, and within the
design and planning professions. With the increasing research
and publication during this period, more detailed definitions
of globalization have emerged, often according to political
and social perspective, organizational mission, and disciplin-
ary context. Globalization, as a research topic, has also
prompted considerable anecdotal discourse within the disci-
pline of landscape architecture, including the development of
an emerging body of critical thought concerning globaliza-
tion relevant to landscape architecture practice, education,
and research. For example, Thayer (2008) speaks of a petro-
chemically and technologically dominated landscape
increasingly separated by vanishing resources at a local level
and interconnected through culture at a global level. Ndubisi
(2008) proposes planning and design theory derived from
ideas of sustainable regionalism, theories of natural regional-
ism, and of critical regionalism in response to metropolitan
growth and globalization. Bowring, Donald, and Liu, in turn,
have described the influence of hegemonic global visual
realms, the global export of cultural identity, and the loss of
cultural consistency in landscape architecture (Licka &
Roehr, 2008). Despite the interest and anecdotal reference,
however, no work to date has either identified or situated
contemporary discourse concerning globalization and
landscape architecture within the larger body of literature on
globalization. Accordingly, this article offers a review of
contemporary literature, identifying and describing the prin-
cipal areas of discourse related to globalization in general,
and its intersection with contemporary discourse in land-
scape architecture.
Method
Because globalization has been a topic of discussion for
more than three decades; because its related discourses have
become extensive in scope, bridging disciplinary boundaries
and geographic contexts; and because so little work has been
devoted to comprehensive reviews of the topic, this review
incorporates methods consistent with what Fiss and Hirsch
(2005) describe as a framing process for conceptual organi-
zation. As such, the review traces the emergence of global-
ization as discourse, samples its various emerging meanings,
and proposes methods to identify and contextualize the spe-
cific literature related to globalization and landscape
architecture.

Globalization and Landscape
Architecture: A Review of the Literature
Robert R. Hewitt1
Abstract
The literature review examines globalization and landscape architecture as discourse, samples its various meanings, and
proposes methods to identify and contextualize its specific literature. Methodologically, the review surveys published articles
and books by leading authors and within the WorldCat.org Database associated with landscape architecture and globalization,
analyzing survey results for comprehensive conceptual and co-relational frameworks. Three "higher order" dimensions
frame the review's conceptual organization, facilitating the organization of subordinate/subtopical areas of interest useful for
comparative analysis. Comparative analysis of the literature suggests an uneven clustering of discipline-related subject matter
across the literature's "higher order" dimensions, with a much smaller body of literature related to landscape architecture
confined primarily to topics associated with the dispersion of global phenomena. A subcomponent of this smaller body
of literature is associated with other fields of study, but inferentially related to landscape architecture. The review offers
separate references and bibliographies for globalization literature in general and globalization and landscape architecture
literature, specifically.

In light of the fact that the literature on globalization is
both multidisciplinary and discipline specific, the review
examines the existing literature comprehensively, and cate-
goricallyspecifictolandscapearchitecture.Methodologically,
the review surveys published articles and books within the
WorldCat.org Database using terms related to globalization,
in turn analyzing the identified literature for comprehensive
conceptual and co-relational frameworks.
Results
Globalization: Definitions and Conceptual
Organization
Four general definitions are useful in describing globaliza-
tion more broadly: The Oxford English Dictionary defines
globalization as "the act of globalizing"; from the noun
"global": meaning, "pertaining to or involving the whole
world," "worldwide," "universal" (Oxford English
Dictionary, 2000).
The World Trade Organization (WTO) Director-General,
Pascal Lamy (2006) proposes that
Globalization can be defined as an historical stage of accelerated
expansion of market capitalism, like the one experienced in the
19th century with the industrial revolution. It is a fundamental
transformation in societies because of the recent technological
revolution which has led to a recombining of the economic and
social forces on a new territorial dimension (see http://www.
wto.org/english/news_e/sppl_e/sppl16_e.htm).
The United Nations Poverty and Development Division
(1999) adds that "[w]hile the definition of globalization var-
ies with the context of analysis, it generally refers to an
increasing interaction across national boundaries that affects
many aspects of life: economic, social, cultural, and
political."
And the World Health Organization (2006) states
Globalization, or the increased interconnectedness and
interdependence of people and countries, is generally understood
to include two interrelated elements: the opening of borders to
increasingly fast flows of goods, services, finance, people and
ideasacrossinternationalborders;andthechangesininstitutional
and policy regimes at the international and national levels that
facilitate or promote such flows. It is recognized that
globalization has both positive and negative impacts on
development.
A brief review of the literature concerning the history of
globalization suggests ongoing processes of globalization,
which have persisted from ancient through contemporary
periods. For example, Hirst and Thompson (1999) describe
economic globalization as a continuation of economic inter-
nationalization originating in the Industrial Revolution.
Hopkins (2002), examining a much longer period, suggests
that globalization is ancient: citing evidence of technologi-
cal, social, and intellectual interconnections well beyond the
local or national level occurring over millennia in many parts
of the world. Cited examples of such connections are found
in the literature related to the diffusion of religious thought,
the expansion of political/military hegemony, and the socio-
cultural acceptance of agricultural and technological innova-
tion. Anecdotal discipline-related research concerning the
antiquity of "sprawl," the global plant trade, immigration of
landscape architects throughout the West during the 18th and
19th centuries, and the globalization of contemporary land-
scape architecture also suggest interrelationships between
globalization and landscape architecture over many centuries
(Hewitt & Nassar, 2004).
Fiss and Hirsch (2005) trace the development and use of
the term globalization to the early 1970s, suggesting that
while scholarly discourse on the topic has increased both in
amount and complexity, little consensus seems to exist con-
cerning its definitive boundaries, limitations, and scope.
Given this context, they suggest that discourse surrounding
globalization still demands considerable interpretation,
including the recognition of coexistence and co-evolution of
its "claims, its divergent interpretations, and selective cita-
tions." Consistent with Fiss and Hirsch, Fishman (1978) and
Fairclough (1992) suggest as corollaries that (a) as contex-
tual discourse increases, so too does diffusion across discur-
sive fields; and (b) that as discursive diffusion increases
across topical fields, so too do shared understandings across
and within fields.
Apreliminary review of the literature, in fact, suggests the
presence of such a discursive context at broader scopes of
review. For example, a review of published work in the
WorldCat.org Database using the term globalization returned
14,784 citations with 5,582 peer-reviewed articles in 2010.
In turn, a search of published work in the WorldCat.org
Database related to the term globalization and literature
reviews noted 634 citations with 634 peer-reviewed citations.
A brief examination of this surveyed literature identified a
wide range of specific issues, including topics such as glo-
balization and governance (Martinelli & Midttun, 2010),
labor in developing regions (Stallings, 2010), urbanization
and the natural environment (Clement, 2010), education and
literacy (J. Brooks & Normore, 2010), finance and invest-
ment (Schularick & Steger, 2010), and politics and media
reform (Waisbord, 2010), among many others. No compre-
hensive literature reviews of the topic of globalization, how-
ever, were evidenced in that year's literature, and no such
reviews were identified in the previous decade.
Operationally, the absence of existing comprehensive
reviews suggests the worth of preliminary legible and useful
organizational structure capable of both interpretation over
time, and correlation of shared and unique issues and subject
matter. Accordingly, such comprehensive reviews
should (a) illustrate a hierarchy of more broadly shared
Hewitt 3
discursive concepts and specific topics, (b) elaborate a range
of subcategories capable of relating broader concepts of glo-
balization with specific topics, and (c) provide relevant cor-
relations between shared issues and topics across the
discursive subcategories. Please see Figure 1 for an illustra-
tion of this conceptual organizational structure.
Globalization: Topical Discourse and Leading
Authors
Given the above suppositions, a brief review of topical dis-
course among leading authors on globalization offers a start-
ing point for the establishment of broadly shared discursive
topics, subtopics, and relevant issues suitable for the kind of
framing contemplated by Fisch et al.
I.
Saskia Sassen's work on globalization, for example,
addresses topical discourse closely related to migra-
tion policy and governance, the emergence of politi-
cal space, counter-globalization social movements,
and globally networked cities. Her identification of
"global cities," as multiple postindustrial, socially and
economically polarized urban nodes, and their influ-
ence on traditional nation states suggests broader top-
icsofglobalurbanismandnation-statetransformations.
Significant subtopics within her work address global
capital formation and information flows, transforma-
tive technology, and increasing social inequity result-
ing from globalization. Her work correlates well with
discourse originating in multiple disciplines, which
include cultural and literary studies, feminist theory,
political economics, sociology, and political science.
II.
Arjun Appadurai examines issues of globalization
closely related to cultural processes, ethnographic
inquiry, and the social influence of media, technol-
ogy, and finance. Topical discourse within his work
addresses ideas of imagination as a social force in the
development of identity, of nation-state transforma-
tion influenced by mass migration, of electronic
mediation of material culture and consumption, and
of multiculturalism. His work bridges discursive
boundaries related to the disciplines of the social sci-
ences, communication studies, political economics,
and anthropology.
III.
Zygmunt Bauman's elaboration of globalization
addresses postmodern social dislocation within the
broader discourse of changing global boundaries,
institutions, political loyalties, personal security, and
economic life. Significant themes evident in his work
emphasize aspects of economic individualism, social
polarization, placelessness, spatial segregation, secu-
rity, and poverty. Like Sassen and Appadurai, his
Figure 1. Conceptual organizational review structure.
4 SAGE Open
work correlates closely with discourses originating in
the disciplines of the social science and political
economics.
IV.
Ulrich Beck extends the topical discourse of global-
ization to issues of modernization, ecological change,
and individualism. His contributions to this discourse
include the concepts of "risk societies," and "reflexive
modernization." Both concepts contemplate modern-
ization in terms of technological change in work and
social organizations, individual lifestyle, political
repression, and social participation. Principal assump-
tions underlying these concepts suggest the decline of
the nation-state as a result of economic and cultural
globalization, and the emergence of wide-spread eco-
logical crisis and environmental risk as predominant
byproducts. Specific subtopics addressed in his writ-
ings include the origins of transnational social space,
economic internationalization, reorientation of educa-
tion, migration and networked economies, the femini-
zation and naturalization of society, and the diffusion
of cosmopolitan society. His work broadly correlates
with discourse derived from political economics, the
social sciences, environmental sciences, communica-
tion studies, and cultural studies.
V.
Michael Featherstone addresses topical areas related
to counter-globalization, mobility, transnational net-
works, and global/local cultural identities. While the
broader themes of his work reflect preoccupations
with sociocultural reproduction and transformation,
particularly noteworthy subtopics in his work address
culture as a world system, and international develop-
ment policy. Preoccupations with the sociocultural
aspects of globalization address the transformation of
national identity, cosmopolitan culture, transborder
cultural conflict, global cultural economy, and the
globalization of diversity. Consistent with aspects of
Sassen, Appadurai, Bauman, and Beck, his work
broadly correlates with discourse associated with the
social sciences, political science, economics, and cul-
tural studies.
VI.
Walden Bello contributes to globalization discourse
associated with the role of market-oriented, transna-
tional corporations, capital formation, and reform of
global financial management organizations. Themes
in his work associated with economic globalization
address bridging the world economy, regional coun-
ter-globalization development strategies, and state
food security. Important subtopics within his work
examine geo-economic competition and sustainable
development, democracy and civic society, agricul-
ture and the food industry. His work broadly corre-
lates with discourse in the social sciences, economics,
political economics, agricultural economics, economic
development, and cultural studies.
VII.
Noted author, Manuel Castells extends globaliza-
tion discourse to the relationship between informa-
tion and communications technology, urban
sociology, culture, and political economy. Castells'
concept of the "space of flows" describes aspects
of these relationships, describing urban concentra-
tions of economy, society, and culture, transformed
by increasingly horizontal information communi-
cations networks, expressions of personal identity,
and continually changing cultural context. His con-
cept of "the fourth world" describes groups of
excluded urban subpopulations typically identified
as nomads, subsistence farmers, and the hyper
poor. Castells's work broadly correlates with dis-
course in the social sciences, political economics,
technology, communication studies, and urban
studies.
VIII.
Sociologist David Held offers worthwhile contri-
butions to the discourse on globalization, national
and international politics, global political interrela-
tionships related to leadership, multilateralism, and
global governance. Noted subtopics in his work
address the changing nature of the modern state,
democracy, sovereignty, social justice, sustainabil-
ity, and cosmopolitanism. His work correlates
broadly with discourse in the social sciences and
political science.
IX.
Economist Joseph Eugene Stiglitz offers topical
discourse on the management of globalization,
global economic inequities, and the role of pollu-
tion in economic and political destabilization.
Themes in Stiglitz's work address institutional
transparency, economic opportunity, economic cri-
ses, incomplete information markets, monetary, fis-
cal, tax and trade policies, and economic
competition. His work correlates broadly with
political economics and economics.
Globalization: Framing Three Broad Dimensions
and Their Subcomponents
While consistent with the brief WorldCat.org Database liter-
ature survey in the section "Globalization: Definitions and
Conceptual Organization," the prominent authors survey
identifies wider ranges and more detailed elaborations of
topical discourse on globalization, including discourse
related to: political economy, governance, urbanization and
the natural environment, education, economics, communica-
tion, technology, social inequity, corporate, trade and busi-
ness processes, global systems and processes, development
studies, and cultural and environmental studies, cultural pro-
cesses, cultural identity, nation-state transformation, mass
migration, material culture and consumption, multicultural-
ism, security, placelessness, media and popular culture,
Hewitt 5
counter-globalization movements, resource conservation,
and global crisis assessment and risk, among others.
Given the number and breadth of these topics and the
cited operational need for legible organizational structure
capable of interpretation over time, Bergesen's conceptual
organization of globalization literature according to dimen-
sions of (a) political and economic processes, (b) large-scale
systems and processes, and (c) the diffusion of global phe-
nomena, offers worthwhile framing structures for several
reasons (Bergesen, 1980, 1983; Bergesen & Bergesenm,
2001; Bergesen & Parisi, 1999). Bergesen's three broad
dimensions of globalization correlate well with what Fiss
and Hirsch describe as "higher order" dimensions as a basis
for framing discursive analysis. The use of such higher order
dimensions facilitates broad-based organizations of existing
literature into a hierarchy of subordinate/subtopical areas of
interest useful for comparative analysis in a literature review.
And this organizational framework facilitates the use of
widely available databases such as WorldCat to identify and
correlate contemporary globalization literature. Because
WorldCat is widely available as a database, a consistent com-
prehensive longitudinal literature review is also possible by
different authors over long periods of time.
Dimensions of globalization: Political-economic processes.A
search of literature in the WorldCat.org Database related to
Bergesen's first dimension of globalization and political-
economic processes returned 21.721 citations, of which
11,344 were peer-reviewed articles. A brief review of the
subject matter available from this search provided five prin-
cipal clusters of discourse related to (a) flows of trade and
production between countries (Dicken, 1998), (b) intensifi-
cation of economic competition (Abedian & Biggs, 1998),
(c) internationalization of corporate production and sales (K.
Lee & Carter, 2005), (d) global governance based on multi-
lateralism or internationalism (Kyoto Protocol, Rio Agree-
ment, North American Free Trade Agreement), and (e) the
growing interdependence of existing states (Keohane, 1998).
These five clusters, in turn, exhibited subtopical framing,
which can be elaborated within the following subtopical
reviews.
Discourse Cluster 1: Flows of trade and production between
countries.A search of the WorldCat.org Database related
to globalization, flows of trade, and production between
countries, returned 6,595 citations, 4,668 of which were
peer-reviewed articles, concerning its economic, social, and
environmental issues. Specific contours evident in the litera-
ture related to its economic issues, address business, geog-
raphy, natural resources governance and law, specifically
(a) globalization and theories of trade, and the geography
of trade and production (Kamiski & Ng, 2001); (b) trade-
related labor and rights, informal institutions, price fixing
and international cartels, intellectual property, and interna-
tional services (Choi & Harrigan, 2003); as well as (c) trade
controls, and bilateral trade wars (Fatemi, 1997).
Published work concerning the environmental and social
aspects of this topical area broadly addresses (a) national
governance and social justice and (b) public health, the envi-
ronment, agriculture, and security. Bandy and Baldwin pro-
vide exemplary studies related to the conflict and social
justice aspects within this work in their examination of trans-
national social movements, transnational environmental jus-
tice, and transnational campaigns against child labor (e.g.,
Baldwin & Winters, 2004; Bandy & Smith, 2005). Taylor
and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United
Nations (FAO) offer worthwhile examples of literature in
this cluster related to public health and security, including
trade in public services and the influence of transnational
commodities and natural resource corporations (Taylor &
Thomas, 1999); and food system transformation, bioengi-
neered products, rural migration, changes in diet and nutri-
tion, and the spread of communicable disease (FAO, 2004).
Discourse Cluster 2: Intensification of economic competi-
tion. A corresponding search of the WorldCat.org Database
addressing the intensification of economic competition and
globalization, returned 6,777 publications, 4,354 of which
were peer reviewed. The contours of this clustered discourse
appear to be more narrowly defined than that of the litera-
ture related to flows of trade and production, addressing
issues of economic competition, politics, technology, busi-
ness, geography, culture, and sustainability. Subtopics of
interest in this cluster, address (a) the relationship between
globalization, protectionism, and competition (Faruqee,
2006); (b) intellectual property and competition (Maskus,
2008); (c) competition between political-economic sys-
tems, ethnic conflict, and democracy (Mudambi, Navarra,
& Sobbrio, 2003); (d) global cities, and global city-regions
(Scott, 2001); and (e) sustainability and global cities (Bak-
ker, 2005).
Discourse Cluster 3: Internationalization of corporate produc-
tion and sales. Publications related to the internationalization
of corporate production and sales are also rather narrowly
focused, addressing issues of global commerce and busi-
ness, economic geography, and technology. A search of the
WorldCat.org Database in this discursive cluster returned
3,589 citations, 2,956 of which were peer reviewed. A
review of specific subtopics in the literature included (a)
international distribution of multinational production (Bora,
2002); (b) global economics and technological change,
transnational production networks, and logistics and distri-
bution industries (Dicken, 2007); (c) the role of global value
chains, international production networks, and enterprise
clusters (Abonyi, 2007); (d) enterprise and information sys-
tems (Camp, 2004); and (e) global networks and production
(Palacios, 2004).
6 SAGE Open
Discourse Cluster 4: Global governance, multilateralism,
and internationalism.The WorldCat.org Database survey
concerning global governance, multilateralism, and inter-
nationalism returned a total of 13,341 citations, 11,311 of
which were peer reviewed. Discourse in this cluster to date
addressed issues related to change in regional, national, and
international relationships related to law, society, economics,
culture, politics, security, and the environment. Specific sub-
topics within the literature address (a) global governance and
regional integration of trade and investment, conflict pre-
vention and peacekeeping, and culture and multilateralism
(Cooper, Hughes, & De Lombaerde, 2008); (b) participa-
tory multilateralism and international institutions, multiparty
social action, and mutual accountability (Ebrahim, 2007); (c)
governance and conflicts of interest in international financial
institutions, and socially sustainable institutions (Fratianni,
Savonna, & Kirton, 2007); (d) multilateralism, and democ-
racy (Cox, 1996); political, economic, and cultural plural-
ism, (Farhang, 2000); and (e) social environmental change,
global civic ethics, migration, and international law (Com-
mission on Global Governance, 1995).
Discourse Cluster 5: The interdependence of existing
states.The final cluster identified within Bergesen's first
broad dimension addresses the interdependence of existing
states. A search of the WorldCat.org Database returned 1,101
citations with 1,103 of the total peer-reviewed articles. The
surveyed literature addressed issues of economics, the envi-
ronment, development, politics, governance, and law, edu-
cation and technology. Exemplary subtopics include (a) the
global interdependence of trade, aid, migration and devel-
opment (Aryeetey & Dinello, 2007); (b) transboundary air
pollution, regional climate change, management of shared
waters, transborder conservation and biodiversity conser-
vation, and interdependence in "green" development (Le
Prestre & Stoett, 2006); (c) interdependence between trans-
national corporations and governments (Buckley & Ghauri,
1999); (d) interdependence of location, education, develop-
ment, and innovation, and strategic technology partnering
(Narula, 2003); (e) interdependence, inequality, identity, and
demographics (Bonilla, 1998); (f) interdependence and insti-
tutions, international relations, and international law (Keo-
hane, 2002); as well as (g) regionalism, multilateralism, and
interdependence (Goddard, Cronin, & Dash, 2003).
Summary discourse concerning political and economic pro-
cess.As illustrated in Figure 2, the surveyed literature
related to the political and economic processes of globaliza-
tion provides five discursive topical clusters, which, as noted
in the elaboration of each cluster above, address 26 subtopi-
cal issues represented in the corresponding matrix. As one
would expect (considering Fiss et al.'s framing methodolo-
gies), the cited subtopical areas within each cluster exhibit
great variation in terms of their subject issues. Specifically,
shared discursive issues between clusters address subject
matter related to economic, environmental, political, tech-
nological, geographical, cultural, sustainability, governance,
law, and security contours of this dimension. For example,
shared economic issues are diffused across the entire range
of clustered discourse, while social, business, educational,
medical, and agricultural issues are more clearly nested
within unique subtopics of the literature in this dimension.
Issues addressing the environment, politics, technology,
geography, and law are shared among three of the five dis-
cursive subtopics, while issues related to culture, sustain-
ability, governance, and security are shared among two of
the five subtopical areas of discourse. Little evidence of dis-
course related to issues of communication or urbanism was
exhibited in this survey. These specific kinds and the extent
of shared and unique issues between discursive clusters dif-
fer markedly from the following two dimensions as will
become evident.
Dimensions of globalization: Large-scale systems and pro-
cesses.
The second dimension related to globalization
described by Bergesen addresses issues of large-scale sys-
tems and processes. Consistent with review methods related
to the political and economic processes of globalization, a
search of published articles in the WorldCat.org Database
associated with the term globalization and large-scale sys-
tems and processes returned 7,524 citations, of which 5,067
were peer-reviewed articles. The subject matter available
from this search suggests three principal discursive clusters
within the dimension: (a) increasingly relative sovereignty
(Agnew, 2009), (b) the replacement of socialist states by
market-oriented states (F. Wu, 2009), and (c) the weakening
of state primacy, autonomy, and international systems (Cole-
man, Weaver, & Streeter, 2009). These three clusters also
exhibit subtopical framing, as evidenced in the following
reviews for each discursive cluster.
Discourse Cluster 1: Relative sovereignty.A search of pub-
lished articles in the WorldCat.org Database related to glo-
balization and relative sovereignty identified 3,384 citations,
1,679 of which were peer-reviewed articles. The surveyed
literature addresses issues related to politics, economics, law,
human and civil rights, security, social and environmental
justice, women's empowerment, global consumer culture,
capital, and identity. Specific subtopics within the literature
include (a) human rights, environmental multilateralism,
economic justice, and security (Newman, Thakur, & Tir-
man, 2006); (b) ethnic and national identity, civil rights and
civil society, and religion, terrorism, and revolution (O'Neil,
2007); (c) globalization and empowerment, citizens' sover-
eignty, and the empowerment of women (Kartik & Sideras,
2006), (d) cultural identity and global capital (Friedman &
Randeria, 2004); (e) sovereignty, territoriality, and the global-
ization of finance (Smith, Solinger, & Topik, 1999); and (f)
global consumer culture, community justice, environmental
racism, and international water rights (Welton & Wolf, 2001).

Discourse Cluster 2: Replacement of socialist states by
market-oriented states.The clustered discourse related to
the replacement of socialist states by market-oriented states
exhibits considerable breadth.Asearch of the literature in the
WorldCat.org Database provided 2,229 citations with 1,960
peer-reviewed articles. Issues evidenced in this literature
included communications, sustainability/development, tech-
nology, culture, economics, social justice, the environment,
education, security, and politics. Specific subtopics included
(a) communication and state transformation, and markets
and cultural transformation (Chakravartty & Zhao, 2008);
(b) world heritage and socialist states, poverty and cosmo-
politanism, deregulated markets, and crime (Sassen, 2007);
(c) women and the labor markets in socialist and capitalist
states (Blossfeld, Buchkolz, & Hofäcker, 2006); (d) capital-
ism, sustainability and climate change, and global political
resistance (Anton & Schmitt, 2007); (e) globalization, class,
and multiculturalism, and educational policy and socialist
pedagogy (McLaren, 2005); (f) socialist models of develop-
ment, and technology, poverty and development (Allen &
Thomas, 2000); and (g) liberalism, consumerism and democ-
racy, and nationalism and mass culture (X. Zhang, 2001).
Discourse Cluster 3: Weakening state primacy, auton-
omy, and international systems.This last discursive cluster
addresses issues concerning security, international politics
and law, education, political and economic regionalization
and decentralization, governance, and urbanization. Identi-
fied citations were derived from a WorldCat.org Database
survey of 2,220 publications, of which 1,900 were peer
reviewed. Subtopics within the surveyed literature include
(a) the internationalization of education policy and security,
and global legal pluralism (Hurrelmann, 2007); (b) global-
ization, decentralization, and regional trans-governmental
interaction (Jun & Wright, 1996); (c) public empowerment
outside the nation-state, and new forms of states (Boyer &
Drache, 1996; Vanaik, 2007); (d) liberal democracy with-
out the classical state, international organizations as sources
of political change (Sakamoto, 1994; Stubbs & Underhill,
2000; van Kersbergen, Lieshout, & Lock, 1999); (e) rela-
tionships among states, citizens, and education (Popkewitz,
2000; Vellinga, 2000); and (f) economic globalization and
urbanization (Pattnayak, 1996).
Summary discourse concerning large-scale systems and pro-
cesses. Unlike the surveyed literature associated with Berge-
sen's first dimension, the literature related to globalization
and large-scale systems and processes exhibits a narrower
range of clustered topical discourse (specifically, 3 subtop-
ics, and 19 subtopics) with more shared issues across the
entire range of subtopics and an equal number of unique
issues among subtopics, as illustrated in Figure 3. Like
Bergesen's first dimension, subtopical areas within each
cluster exhibit great variation in terms of their subject mat-
ter. Shared discursive issues between clusters address, to
varying degrees, subject matter related to economic, social,
environmental, political, cultural, educational, governance,
law, and security contours of this dimension. For example,
shared economic, political, and security issues are diffused
across the entire range of clustered discourse, while techno-
logical, sustainability, business, communications, and urban-
ism issues appear as unique subtopics of the literature of the
dimension. Issues addressing society, environment, culture,
education, governance, and law are shared by two of the
three discursive subtopics, while issues related to geography,
medicine, and agriculture were not represented within the
surveyed literature. As with the literature related to global-
ization and political and economic processes, cited literature
within this dimension exhibits great variation in terms of its
subject matter.

Consistent with review methods for the previous two dimen-
sions of globalization, a search of published articles in the
WorldCat.org Database related to the dispersion of global
phenomena returned 4,735 citations, 2,184 of which were
peer-reviewed articles. The subject matter available from
this search suggests two principal discursive clusters within
the dimension: (a) the simultaneous dispersion of global phe-
nomena locally (Hansen, 2002) and (b) the subsequent trans-
formation of social and economic space (MacKinnon &
Cumbers, 2007).
Discourse Cluster 1: The simultaneous dispersion of global
phenomena locally.A search of the WorldCat.org Database
related to the term globalization and the simultaneous dis-
persion of global phenomena locally resulted in 1,399 cita-
tions, 885 of which were peer-reviewed articles. A review of
this literature identified broader issues related to bioethics
and medicine, society, material culture, agriculture, media/
communications, geography, design (including landscape
and architecture), and technology. Specific subtopics within
the literature included (a) global markets in body parts, new
and resurgent disease, electronic money, and local currency
(Mander & Goldsmith, 1996); (b) indigenous culture (Grae-
ber, 2007); (c) globalization and foods (Brunn, 2006); (d)
world society and regional cultures, global communication,
and the "construction of place and space (Rossi, 2007); (e)
phenomenology and global material culture, place and land-
scape, and technology as material culture (Tilley, 2006); (f)
distributed work, face-to-face communication, and com-
puter-mediated groups (Hinds & Kiesler, 2002); and (g)
media and conflict studies (Cottle, 2006).
Discourse Cluster 2: The transformation of social and eco-
nomic space. A search of the WorldCat.org Database for the
last of the clustered discourses related to globalization and
the transformation of social and economic space returned
3,715 citations, with 3,030 of those peer reviewed. The lit-
erature from this search addressed broader issues related to
geographic transformation, epidemiology, culture, economic
and social geography, the environment, sustainability, com-
munication and identity, design (landscape architecture and
architecture), and urbanism. Specific subtopics within the
literature include (a) transitory sites and "forgotten" urban
public space, hyper-modernization and hyper-tradition
(Elsheshtawy, Sintusingha, Stallmeyer, Qian, & AlSayyad,
2006); (b) indigenous health, disease and the social organiza-
tion of space (Green & Labonte, 2008); (d) commercial space
and globalization, gender relations, and media and globaliza-
tion (Somayaji & Somayaji, 2006); (e) ancient network soci-
eties, modern resistance identities, foreign self and familiar
other (Scham & LaBianca, 2006); (f) urban environmental-
ism, sustainability, geopolitics of urban informality (Brand,
2005; Roy & AlSayyad, 2004); and (g) the hyper-differenti-
ation of space, and autonomous public spheres (O'Loughlin,
Staeheli, & Greenbergeds, 2004).
Summary discourse concerning dispersion of global phenom-
ena.In summary, the surveyed literature related to Berge-
sen's third dimension concerning the dispersion of global
phenomena illustrates a narrower range of topical clustered
discourse than those concerning either political-economic
processes or large-scale systems and processes of globaliza-
tion.As illustrated in Figure 4, the survey identified two topi-
cal discursive clusters compared with three and five in the
previous two dimensions, and 14 subtopics compared with
19 and 26 in the other two dimensions. Unlike the other two
dimensions, the shared areas of discourse are more limited
within this dimension. Its shared issues include geographi-
cal, cultural, medical, and communications. This dimen-
sion also includes the most unique issues, including those
related to: economics, society, the environment, technology,
agriculture, and urbanization. It also addresses the fewest
issues, with no literature evident related to politics, sustain-
ability, business, education, governance, law, and security.
As observed in the discourse of the other two dimensions,
discursive clusters are more differentiated within the specific
Figure 3. Correlation between clustered discourse concerning large-scale systems and processes of globalization.
Hewitt 9
subtopics of their cited publications, and exhibit great range
and variation.
Summary discourse concerning the three dimensions of glo-
balization.As illustrated in Figure 5, the preceding three
surveys of globalization literature suggest the following
findings: (a) a broad confirmation of the definitions cited in
the Oxford English Dictionary, the WTO Director-General,
the United Nations Poverty and Development Division, in
the World Health Organization; (b) identifiable contours of
a widely differentiated contemporary discourse evident in
the writings of prominent authors on the subject; (c) con-
firmation and elaboration of these discursive contours from
WorldCat.org Database surveys in terms of clustered sub-
topics and disciplinary issues; (d) evidence of the extent of
shared disciplinary issues across discursive subtopics; and
(e) evidence of potential areas for further development in the
discourse of globalization.
Specifically, the reviewed literature suggests
·
· 10 clustered discourses describing globalization sub-
sumed within three conceptual dimensions related to
political and economic processes, large-scale systems
and processes, and global phenomena,
·
· 59 subtopical areas nested within the clustered dis-
courses addressing 17 discipline-related issues,
·
· variations in discipline-related issues within the 10
discursive subtopics ranging from 4 to 10 of the 17
identified issues, averaging 7.3 per subtopic, and
·
· variation in shared discipline-related issues across
subtopics ranging from 2 to 9, averaging 4.3 issues
per subtopic,
·
· a significant degree of shared discipline-related issues
between discursive subtopics in economics, social sci-
ence, politics, the environment, and culture,
·
· minimal amounts of shared discipline-related issues
between discursive subtopics related to urbanism and
agriculture.
These findings suggest that despite considerable growth
in the discourse of globalization during the last several
decades, (a) significant areas for discursive development
remain within all clustered subtopics; (b) significant oppor-
tunities for shared discourse remain between most subtopics;
(c) given the remaining potential for further development
within the discourse of globalization, considerable change in
its discursive contours may be anticipated over time; and (d)
given these assumptions, the growth of other discipline-spe-
cific inquiry not identified in this literature review.
Globalization and Landscape Architecture
While these general definitions and reviews of the globaliza-
tion literature offer useful measure of contemporary dis-
course on globalization in general, a review of the literature
related to landscape architecture and globalization (as sug-
gested previously) poses a set of problems related to its con-
textualization and discursive framing. Accordingly, the
remaining review section utilizes (a) the general framing
methodology applied above to identify the dimensions,
shared topical discourse, and subtopical areas associated
with landscape architecture, and globalization as a means to
identify and analyze the broadest range of relevant literature;
and (b) a review of select literature by prominent authors
originating specifically within the landscape architecture
discipline.
As a means of establishing this broad range of literature
associated with landscape architecture and globalization, a
search of published work in the WorldCat.org Database
related to those terms resulted in 475 citations, 350 of which
were peer reviewed. As anticipated, the survey identified
more narrowly defined discipline-specific issues related to
landscape architecture, and a body of literature that was more
broadly associated with a range of fields related to landscape
architecture (see Figure 6). The surveyed literature, which
addressed the more narrowly defined issues associated with
landscape architecture (dark green in Figure 6) fell primarily
Figure 4. Correlation between clustered discourse concerning the dispersion of global phenomena.
10 SAGE Open
within Bergesen's second and third dimension: Large-Scale
SystemsandProcesses,andDispersionofGlobalPhenomena;
and primarily addressed discipline-related issues concerning
economics, sociology, the environment, politics, technology,
culture, sustainability, communications, agriculture, and
urbanism.
Issues more broadly associated with other fields, which
referenced landscape architecture addressed every subtopi-
cal cluster within Bergesen's first and second dimensions:
except those concerning global governance, multilateralism,
and internationalism, and replacement of socialist states by
market-oriented states. Discipline-specific issues within this
surveyed group addressed economics, social sciences, the
environment, politics, technology, culture, sustainability,
business, education, governance, and security (identified in
light green in Figure 6).
Literature in the narrow survey sample evidenced discur-
sive interest in globalization and landscape architecture
related to (a) global cities, communications, and architecture
(Krause & Petro, 2003); (b) globalization and urban space
(Guggenheim & Soderstrom, 2010); (c) globalization and
landscape urbanism (Berger & Crawford, 2006); (d) global-
ization, identity, and development (Viquar, Broudehoux,
Sinha, Shwayri, 1998); (e) globalization, landscape ecology,
and sustainability (Musacchio, 2009); (f) globalization and
urban agriculture (Malaque & Yokohari, 2007); and (g) per-
vasive technology and society (Kourouthanassis & Giaglis,
2008); (h) landscape assessment and risk analysis (Calder,
Hofer, & Messerli, 2008); (i) transnational sustainability
(Keiner & Kim, 2007); (j) ecosystem biodiversity conserva-
tion (Perfecto & Vandermeer, 2008); and (k) urban ecology
and agriculture (Pope & Kraft, 2004).
As noted, these discipline-specific issues correlated pre-
dominantly with Bergesen's second and third dimensions:
Large-Scale Systems and Processes, and the Dispersion of
Global Phenomena. Specific subtopical discourse was asso-
ciated with three of the five discursive clusters, including (a)
the simultaneous dispersion of global phenomena locally, (b)

the subsequent transformation of social and economic space,
and (c) increasingly relative sovereignty.
The literature from the broader survey sample found to
fall predominantly within the domain of other fields, includ-
ing the topics primarily related to urban and cultural studies,
politics and economics, and education. Literature from this
broader survey sample related to the urban and cultural stud-
ies field addressed issues, including (a) globalization and
cultural heritage (Kalay, Kvan, & Affleck, 2008), (b) global-
ization and inequality (Nelson & Seager, 2005), (c) global-
ization and sociocultural meaning (Elsheshtawy, 2008), (d)
globalization and material culture (Tilley, 2006), (e) global-
ization and urban identity (Lee, 2008), (f) urban public space
(Law, 2002), (g) global and urban cultural economies
(Latham, 2003), and (h) media and transnational culture
(Burd, 2008).
Discursive topics in the broader sample related to fields of
politics and economics fell largely within Berensen's first
dimension of globalization: Political and Economic Processes
of Globalization. Specific issues in this surveyed literature
fell within four of five discursive clusters, including (a)
flows of trade and production between countries, (b) intensi-
fication of economic competition, (c) internationalization of
corporate production and sales, and (d) interdependence of
existing states. Issues identified in these clusters addressed
(a) globalization, governance, and economic justice (Feher,
2007); (b) globalization and political regionalism (Camilleri,
2003); (c) globalization, governance, security, and natural
resources (Lesage, van de Graaf, & Westphal, 2010); (d) eco-
nomic development and infrastructure management (Zhang,
Xu, Zhang, Yi, & Jian, 2010); (e) globalization and technol-
ogy management (Kamel, 2003); (f) globalization, competi-
tion, and consumer values (Zhao & Belk, 2008); and (g)
urban cultural political economy (Fumaz, 2009).
The last group in the broader sample addressed education,
falling primarily within Bergesen's first and second dimen-
sions: Large-Scale Systems and Processes, and Political and
Economic Processes. Examples of issues in this group
included (a) globalization, diversity, and educational empow-
erment (Chun & Evans, 2009); (b) globalization and
Figure 6. Correlations between landscape architecture literature and topical discourse on globalization.

educational leadership (Vulliamy, Webb, Sarja, &
Hamalainen, 2006); and (c) education, urban networks, and
sustainability (D'Auria, 2001). Specific subtopics were
associated in varying degrees with two of eight of the first
and second dimension's discursive clusters, and addressed
(a) the interdependence of existing states and (b) the weak-
ening of state primacy, autonomy, and international
systems.
As illustrated in Figure 7, these narrowly and broadly
identifiable groups suggest the following relationships
between the landscape architecture and globalization litera-
ture and the more general globalization literature.
Compared with the general literature on globalization, the
reviewed literature on landscape architecture and globaliza-
tion suggests
·
· a narrow group of landscape architecture discourse
falling predominantly within Bergesen's third
·
· dimension addressing all topics found in the general
literature on globalization except those related to geo-
graphical issues;
·
· a broader group of discourse more closely associated
with other fields falling predominantly in Bergesen's
first and second dimensions, which covered many
fewer issues than the general literature (14 as com-
pared with 62);
·
· shared discipline-related issues between discursive
subtopics in landscape architecture and globalization
literature that were less common and much less exten-
sive, which addressed issues associated with: eco-
nomics, politics, the environment, and culture, and
sustainability;
·
· minimal amounts of shared discipline-related issues
between discursive subtopics in the landscape archi-
tecture and globalization literature, that were predom-
inantly related to sociological and geographical issues,
business, communications, education, governance,
law, medicine, security, urbanism and agriculture.
These findings suggest, despite the considerable growth
in globalization discourse during the last several decades,
and despite its relatively large breadth of discursive issues
Figure 7. Composite correlations between landscape architecture literature and topical discourse on globalization.

(note: approximately 450 citations in landscape architecture
compared with approximately 34,000 citations in globaliza-
tion in general), that landscape architecture­related discourse
remains relatively underdeveloped within the larger body of
globalization literature.
Given the above suppositions, a brief review of topical
discourse related to globalization by leading authors within
the landscape architecture discipline offers needed elabora-
tion. The following section presents summaries of leading
authors' discourse, identifies prominent themes, and sug-
gests significant discursive correlations across disciplines.
Prominent themes include critical regionalism, ecological
modernization and deglobalization, ecological democracy,
the political economy and landscape change, landscape per-
ception, international education, and landscape
epidemiology.
Globalization and Landscape Architecture:
Topical Discourse Among Leading Authors
I.
Simon Swaffield and Jackie Bowring address a range
of globalization and landscape architecture­related
issues both individually and as coauthors, including
critical regionalism and culturally mediated land-
scape. In Think Global, Think Local: Critical
Regionalism and Landscape Architecture, Swaffield
and Bowring identify significant themes related to
globalization and landscape architecture, including
themes reminiscent of Manuel Castells's proposition
that "spaces of flows" are replacing the "space of
place." They cite Lane's reference to the transforma-
tive influence of digital media on landscape architec-
ture, as well as, Yeung and Savage's idea of the
homogenization of commercial and "touristic" set-
tings under the influence of global consumer markets
(Bowring & Swaffield, 2004).
Swaffield's and Bowring's conception of "critical
regionalism" is consistent with well-established ideas
coined by Tzonis, Lefaivre, and Frampton, as well as
J. B. Jackson, suggesting a more critical response by
landscape architecture to the integration of universal
aesthetics and the technological imperatives of glo-
balization, utilizing, instead, regionalist traditions of
the vernacular, theories of place, and historic preser-
vation. Bowring's and Swaffield's proposal for a land-
scape approach to critical regionalism is consistent
with Frampton's identification of the landscape's
redemptive and mediating qualities, recognizing the
inherently reactive response of landscape to global-
ization. Their argument for more direct and reflective
experience as a means of capturing greater sense of
place and region suggests several design concepts rel-
evant to landscape architecture, including: tactility,
eco-revelatory tectonics, and focus on occupation
rather than aesthetics.
Notable topics within their work correlate with disci-
plinary issues identified in the globalization and
landscape architecture literature under Bergesen's
third dimension, including (a) globalization, the
invention of modern vernaculars, and the mediatory
potential of built form (Umbach & Hüppauf, 2005);
(b) the architecture of resistance (Foster, 1983); (c)
postmodernism and imagery (Docherty, 1993); (d)
cultural studies and critical regionalism (Herr, 1996);
(e) phenomenology and place, tectonics, and elec-
tronic media (Nesbitt, 1996); (f) architectural identity
and globalization (Tzonis & Lefaivre, 2003); and (g)
authenticity and place-based fantasies (Kollin, 2007).
II.
Ingrid Sarlov-Herlin, Jorgen Primdahl, and Simon
Swaffield address the relationship between globaliza-
tion and landscape architecture associated with
urbanization, agriculture, and rural culture. Sarlov-
Herlin in her description of "landscape globalization"
characterizes the transformation of contemporary
landscape as (a) a derivative of rapid urbanization and
the disappearance of everyday landscapes within the
urban fringe, (b) a proliferation of "characterless
compensation landscapes" arising from formulaic
mitigation of environmental impacts, (c) the aban-
donment of uplands and marginal areas in response to
the movement of agricultural production to more
intensive areas, and (d) as dramatic and unpredictable
consequences of climate change (Herlin, 2004).
Swaffield and Primdahl have amplified this dis-
course, addressing the relationship between global-
ization and contemporary agricultural landscape
change focused on emerging market conditions,
technological developments, and sociocultural con-
ditions (Swaffield & Primdahl, 2010) Specifically,
they examine the way in which the global market lib-
eralization and international sustainability policy
influence the agricultural landscape in Europe, Asia-
Pacific and the United States ecologically, in terms
of urbanization, biodiversity, sustainable landscape
management, and climate change.
III.
Robert Hewitt, Hala Nassar, and Carl Steinitz offer
conceptual approaches to global and international
scale landscape assessment concerning the relation-
ship between industrialized societies and environ-
mental change--including the processes of
globalization. Aspects of Hewitt's and Nassar's work
are derived from ecological modernization theory,
originating in the early 1980s primarily in western
European countries, notably Germany, the
Netherlands, and the United Kingdom. Earlier contri-
butions to its theoretical development emphasizes the
role of technological innovation in environmental
reform (Beck, Giddens, & Lash, 1994), and the role
of the state and markets in ecological transformation,
including its institutional and cultural dynamics.
14 SAGE Open
During the last decade, ecological modernization
discourse has broadened theoretically and geo-
graphically to include examinations of the ecologi-
cal transformation of consumption, and global
processes. An important stream of thought within
this literature examines historically reactive
responses to modernization and globalization
defined by Janicke as "reflexive modernization"
(Janicke & Jorgens, 2000). Examples of "reflexive
modernization" include (a) the institutionalization
of nature conservation, (b) the merging of the envi-
ronmental movement and nature conservation, (c)
the growth of more aggressive environmental con-
cepts and alliances such as the animal protection
movement, (d) the advent of "green services," and
(e) the development of nature values in cultural
landscapes (Van Koppen, 2004).
Steinitz's work is especially useful as a landscape
issues framework for examining reactive responses
contemplated by ecological modernization and
deglobalization at three overlapping scales: global,
regional, and local (Steinitz, 2004). Operationally
Steinitz's framework predicts that the more global
influences expand and regional/local influences
contract the more pronounced the negative aspects
of globalization become.
Hewitt and Nassar (2006) cite Serrano's use of the
term deglobalization to describe reactive responses
to globalization processes, which include the rever-
sal of negative aspects of globalization through the
development of "more inclusive and sustainable
societies in an extremely unequal and environmen-
tally-damaged world (pp. 74-77)." Their work is
particularly useful in relating globalization to an
emerging class of landscapes associated with the
activities of international organizations advocating
universal values and cultural diversity (Nassar &
Hewitt, 2004); and with the effects of international
medical protocols in response to the threat of global
epidemic--described by Hewitt and Nassar in terms
of landscape epidemiology.
IV.
Randy Hester's recent work in landscape architec-
ture is broadly related to ecological sociology and
environmental justice scholarship addressing glo-
balization and ecological democracy. Emphasizing
both ecological and democratic processes, Hester
proposes the transformation of urban areas to "with-
stand short duration shocks." He suggests that the
development of "compelling not just consumptive
environments" and "multiple avenues of steward-
ship," which incorporate human values, everyday
behavior, and participatory action can critically
redress globalization related to climate change, eco-
nomic exploitation, loss of culture, degraded bio-
logical diversity, social division, and loss of
community.
Hester's approach to globalization, described as
"glocalization," emphasizes (a) direct face to face
participation; (b) the incorporation of "local wis-
dom," and global consequences in democratic deci-
sion making; (c) a heightened respect for place
attachment; (d) enhancing traditional culture; and
(e) the preservation of social-ecological networks.
Hester emphasizes local community interests in
relation to global interests and ecological integrity;
proposing that ecological issues and problems tran-
scend boundaries, and that democratic practices can
be adapted to a wide variety of decision-making
conditions in response to global change.
V.
James Wescoat suggests a conceptual approach to
globalization and context sensitive landscape archi-
tecture based on Kenneth Boulding's idea of an
"integrative power" capable of linking political and
economic power with humanistic values and land-
scape change. This approach acknowledges the sig-
nificant but relatively small amount of literature on
the relationship of private capital to landscape
change, suggesting that the attainment of sustainable
landscape change is as much the result of political-
economic factors as cultural-ecological factors.
Within this broader rubric, Wescoat identifies two
areas related to globalization: (a) finance connected
to risk management and innovation and (b) "glocal"
change. Speaking to the topic of globalization and
risk management, Wescoat emphasizes two types of
global land use and land cover changes: (a) those
driven by global scale processes like greenhouse
warming and (b) those related to aggregated local
change.
Wescoat's approach to glocalization is particularly
useful in relating a number landscape topics he iden-
tifies as local and global, including (a) ubiquitous
networks of international tourist destinations and
virtual landscape, (b) antiglobal and nostalgic public
sentiment, (c) the increasing interest in fortified,
atomized, and communitarian places, (d) the broader
phenomena of economic stagnation, political devo-
lution, and (e) globally induced socioenvironmental
distress.
VI.
Charles Waldheim and Alan Berger ground their
thoughts on the relationship landscape and global-
ization in economic and geographic processes asso-
ciated with industrialization, resulting in distinct
urban spatial organization and form reflecting previ-
ous spatial obsolete modes. Waldheim and Berger
suggest a contemporary second shift influenced by
globalization that is transforming industry from
nationally decentralized to internationally distrib-
uted organizations. Explained in terms of logistics
landscape, this shift is characterized by vast land-
scapes devoted to global supply chains for distribu-
tion and delivery, consumption and convenience,
Hewitt 15
and accommodation and disposal. Waldheim and
Berger's concept of logistical landscape is consistent
with aspects of Waldheim's "landscape urbanism,"
which suggests that contemporary urban order is
best offers the most appropriate medium upon which
to base urban order for the contemporary city for
better ways to deal with complex urban projects.
VII.
Robert Thayer Jr. addresses globalization and land-
scape architecture in terms of technology, communi-
cationsandmedia,sustainability,andbioregionalism.
Thayer identifies the ubiquitous proliferation of
digital imagery and technologically simulated land-
scapes as principal characteristics of a globalizing
cultural landscape, suggesting that sustainable
development must ultimately balance primal human
attitudes related to "topophilia, technophobia, and
technophilia." In response, he proposes a piece-by-
piece transformation of our world from one based on
the development of landscape, which is local, recog-
nizes resource conservation and consumption, is
interrelated with community-based living systems,
and preserves essential ecological characteristics in
the form of sustainable landscape technology.
Thayer expands on these themes in his description of
landscape "relocalization" in response to declining global
energy resources and the advance of information technolo-
gies, suggesting profound changes in the perceived and
actual size, scale, and grain of developed landscape.
Summary: Topical Discourse Among Leading
Authors
Like the literature identified in the WorldCat.org Database
survey related to globalization and landscape architecture,
the above literature concerning contemporary discourse
among leading authors from landscape architecture is clus-
tered around specific dimensions, categories and/or topics.
Specifically, much of the reviewed work on critical regional-
ism and culturally mediated landscape addresses topics con-
cerned with the global diffusion of phenomena locally,
especially those phenomena related to traditional and global
culture, the scholarship of place, communication, resistance
and identity, the environment, and agriculture. Inferential
connections to other dimensions of globalization (its politi-
cal and economic processes) are also evident in the scholar-
ship on political and economic humanism, and on critical
regionalism, especially its subcategories related to material
culture and the influence of technology on the built
environment.
A review of the discourse surrounding ecological democ-
racy is also largely clustered around topics concerning the
global diffusion of phenomena locally. As with the literature
addressing critical regionalism, it emphasizes topics
related to traditional and global culture, the discourse of
place, communication, resistance and identity, and the envi-
ronment. While the identified discourse on ecological
democracy certainly finds support in broader subject areas of
ecological sociology and environmental justice, it does not
yet appear to have crossed significantly into topical areas
within other dimensions of globalization.
In retrospect, the discourse concerning ecological mod-
ernization/deglobalization and the political economy of land-
scape change are inferentially correlated across the three
dimensions of globalization. Both discourses address broader
global processes and systems, contemplated in Bergesen's
second dimension; and both address the significant relation-
ships between global political/economic processes and local
change evidenced in Bergesen's second dimension. Because
the two disciplinary streams of thought are intimately tied to
the landscape and local culture, they also find significant
support in the literature concerning the diffusion of global
phenomena locally (Bergesen's third dimension). They offer
specific landscape associated discourse to the lesser devel-
oped areas of globalization literature addressing analytical
methodology across local and global scales, and global
epidemiology.
Common threads within authors' discourses related to
agriculture, urbanization, industrialization, declining global
energy resources, and advanced information technologies
suggest profound changes in size, scale, and grain of devel-
oped and undeveloped landscape, reflecting global influence
associated with broad themes within the globalization litera-
ture. Common threads within these discourses also correlate
across a wide range of discipline-related topics such as geog-
raphy, agriculture, urbanism, politics and economics, the
environment, sustainability/development, communications
and media, technology, governance, and society. The con-
tours of this discourse clearly fall within Bergesen's third
dimension addressing the dispersion of global phenomena,
and inferentially within Bergesen's second and third dimen-
sions of globalization.
Summary: Globalization and Landscape
Architecture
As a means of serving the needs of further research on glo-
balization in general and landscape architecture in particular,
the preceding review sought to place the surveyed literature
on globalization and landscape architecture in context of the
larger body of globalization literature through a systematic
review of (a) the cogent definitions and histories of global-
ization, (b) the works of recognized authors on the subject,
and (c) the body of existing literature available through the
WorldCat.org Database.
In recognition of Fiss and Hirsch's (2005) suggestion that
contextual discourse surrounding globalization still demands
considerable interpretation, the review has addressed inter-
pretation through better defining discursive contours, limita-
tions, and scopes. The details of these contours are most
16 SAGE Open
visibly illustrated in the figures indicating correlations and
disparities in areas of the literature associated with its pri-
mary components and discipline-related subject matter. The
review has suggested 10 subject categories of globalization
arrayed in three principal dimensions: the political and eco-
nomic processes, the large-scale systems and processes, and
the phenomenological aspects of globalization, with correla-
tions and discrepancies between these 10 subject categories
denoted across 17 identifiable discipline-related subject
areas.
Interpretive analysis of these correlations and discrepan-
cies, if measured against Fishman (1978) and Fairclough's
(1992) corollaries to Fisch and Hirsch's maxim on discursive
interpretation, suggests that discourse on globalization over
the last several decades has diffused unevenly across the
three conceptual dimensions. Interpretive analysis also sug-
gests that the clustering of discipline-related subject matter
across dimensions is more pronounced in areas related to
economics, politics, the environment, business, governance,
development, culture, and education; and that other disci-
pline-related subjects are less and sometimes much less well
represented. These observations are confirmed through
repeated WorldCat.com Database searches under a variety of
search methods ranging from very broad (entire text searches)
to very narrow (subject searches), which lends some measure
of reliability and predictability to interpretive analysis of the
more than 30,000 citations.
To provide consistent criteria for comparative analysis of
the literature on globalization and landscape architecture, the
review has followed the methods and conceptual organiza-
tion established in review of the more general literature.
Accordingly, the review identified a much smaller body of
literature related to globalization with considerable scope
across the various discipline-related subject matter but con-
fined primarily to topics associated with the dispersion of
global phenomena. A subcomponent of this smaller body of
surveyed literature was more inferentially related to land-
scape architecture, but more closely related to other fields. In
short, while there are not great quantities of scholarship asso-
ciated with landscape architecture and globalization, the
existing scholarship seems to address most of the important
discipline-related subject areas, if not the entirety of its
dimensions.
As with the literature review in general, the review spe-
cific to landscape architecture provided relevant examples of
citations available in the broader searches. These exemplars
are cited in the sections on references and bibliography, and
should be considered (for purposes of the review) samples of
the scholarship available within the larger database of more
than 30,000 citations. Separate references and bibliographies
are included for globalization literature in general and glo-
balization and landscape architecture literature, specifically.
Areference list of significant works in landscape architecture
is also included to complement the review of prominent
author's discourse on landscape architecture and
globalization. As a whole, this list of references is intended
to complement and contextualize extant discourse on land-
scape architecture and globalization, as well as provide cor-
relation between the more general literature on
globalization.
As such, it provides a significant source of data and ana-
lytical methods, which remain useful to students of the sub-
ject, scholars interested in the relationship between the
broader topic and landscape architecture, as well as a more
general scholarly audience. Its methods are easily repeated
and verifiable, and its sources and authors should remain
current for well in to the foreseeable future, as the cited work
spans decades and is derived from relatively large data sets,
which are unlikely to change appreciably.
