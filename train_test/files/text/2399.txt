INTRODUCTION
Methamphetamine (MA) is a highly addictive and power-
ful sympathomimetic drug that directly affects the central ner-
vous system as well as the autonomic nervous system, even
when taken in small amounts.1 Repeated MA use has been
shown to cause persistent dopaminergic deficits resulting in
long-term neurological damage2 and leads to clinically signifi-
cant social, occupational, and medical impairment.3 Despite
federal and international regulations designed to tighten con-
trol of precursor materials needed for the synthesis of MA,4

there is no decrease of MA use in the US and throughout the
world. MA abuse and dependence have become major public
health and law enforcement problems.5
MA use in the US has been demonstrated to have regional
variation and has consistently been higher in the West and
Midwest.5,6 One explanation for this relationship may be re-
gional differences in MA manufacturing and distribution.
First, since 1990, the manufacture and distribution of MA has
expanded in two major ways. MA production in home labo-
ratories became widespread throughout California and other
Western states, as well as in the Rocky Mountain states. At the
same time, large-scale laboratories developed in Southern
California and Northern Mexico. MA from these labs was
distributed primarily in the West and Midwest.5,7 MA supply
from these two sources resulted in a higher availability of MA
throughout the West and Midwest. However, these factors
do not completely explain the regional variation in MA use.
The West and Midwest hold consistently higher rates of MA
use though current MA production and distribution are more

ObjectiveaaMethamphetamine (MA) use rates in the United States (US) have consistently demonstrated geographical variation and
have been higher in the West and Midwest. This uneven pattern of use could be explained by regional differences in MA manufacturing
and distribution, but may also result from differences in altitude. The hypobaric hypoxia found at high altitude alters neurotransmitter
synthesis in the brain, which may contribute to MA use. The present study investigated the relationship between mean altitude and MA
use rate in the 48 contiguous US states and the District of Columbia.
MethodsaaState-level estimates of past year MA use were extracted from the National Survey on Drug Use and Health report. The mean
altitude of each state was calculated using the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission altitude data set.
ResultsaaThere was a significant positive correlation between mean state altitude and MA use rate (r=0.66, p<0.0001). Multivariate linear
regression analysis showed that altitude remained a significant predictor for MA use rate (=0.36, p=0.02), after adjusting for age, ethnici-
ty, education, socioeconomic level, employment, MA laboratory incidents, subpopulations, and other substance use.
ConclusionaaAltitude appears to a possible contributing factor for regional variation of MA use in the US. Further studies will be required
to determine biological changes in neurotransmission resulting from chronic mild hypoxia at high altitude in MA users.

geographically dispersed in the United States.6,8
The etiology of MA use disorders is not clear, but has been
suggested to involve multiple factors including the psychoac-
tive properties of MA, individual differences such as genetics
and personality, and environmental variables.9 Among these
factors, environmental stressors may be potent initial motiva-
tors for MA use as well as modulators of MA recurrence and
maintenance.10 Heritability is defined as the variance in a dis-
ease trait that can be attributed to genetic factors, with the re-
mainder accounted for by the environment. While the herita-
bility of MA abuse and dependence are unknown, several
studies have examined the stimulant class of drugs that in-
cludes MA and cocaine.11,12 In these studies, 33­79% of the
variance in the risk for stimulant use disorders is attributable
to genetic factors, indicating that up to 67% can be attributed
to environmental factors.
One potential environmental contributor to the regional
variation in MA use may be the effect of high altitude, which
is a major geographic characteristic of the Intermountain West
in the US Increased altitudes provide sustained hypobaric
and hypoxic environments. The brain consumes 20 percent of
the total body oxygen for its normal neurophysiological func-
tion.13 The rate-limiting enzymes related to the synthesis of
neurotransmitters including dopamine (DA), serotonin (5-
HT), and norepinephrine (NE) are highly oxygen-dependent
and require sufficient oxygen for their optimal activity.14 Thus,
even mild hypoxia could impact neurotransmitter synthesis,
potentially altering neurophysiological function.13 Although
the brain works to maintain neuronal function despite the hy-
poxic insult associated with altitude,15 a growing body of evi-
dence demonstrates that the homeostasis of the neurotrans-
mitter systems in the brain is altered in the course of time at
high altitude. In preclinical studies, exposure to hypobaric hy-
poxia for periods of 7 and 14 days has been reported to in-
crease DA levels and decrease 5-HT levels in the frontal lobe.16
It has also been shown that simulated altitude increases the
lethality of methamphetamine, but does not affect the lethali-
ty of sympathomimetic amines that act peripherally rather than
centrally.17
Altered functioning of brain DA and 5-HT systems may
play a role in MA use disorders. Psychostimulant abuse vul-
nerability has been linked to chronic exposure to stress,18 per-
sonality factors including sensation/novelty seeking and im-
pulsivity,19,20 and their genetic predisposition,21,22 which are
characterized by dopaminergic hyperactivity and/or seroto-
nergic hypoactivity.23,24 Enhanced DA levels are also implicated
in cross-behavioral sensitization between MA and cocaine.25
Cocaine and amphetamines are powerful psychostimulants
that cause euphoria, heightened alertness, increased energy
and intensified emotions. These effects are mediated by in-
creased synaptic concentrations of monoamines including DA,
5-HT, and NE.26,27 It is now well-established that the reinforc-
ing effect of drugs depends not only on striatal DA increases,
but on the rate of such increases.28 Given the cross-tolerance
between MA and cocaine,29 the recognized effects of altitude
on DA levels and MA lethality, and our finding that altitude is
a predictor of cocaine use,30 we sought to investigate the pos-
sibility of a relationship between altitude and MA use.
The majority of worldwide MA production and consump-
tion now occurs in Southeast Asia and North America.31 With
the epidemiologic and potential neurobiological connections
between high altitude of residence and MA use, we hypothe-
sized that altitude would have a significant association with
the rate of MA use in the US In this study, we investigated the
relationship between the state-level MA and other substance
use data from National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NS-
DUH) and mean state altitude in the US Also, to increase the
credibility of our hypothesis, we performed a multivariate re-
gression analysis of MA use rate with mean altitude and previ-
ously reported risk factors affecting MA use5,32,33 by state level.
METHODS
Methamphetamine use data
State-level estimates of 12-month prevalence of MA use were
extracted from the 2002 to 2005 National Survey on Drug Use
and Health (NSDUH) report sponsored by the Substance
Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMH-
SA).34 The NSDUH provides national and state-level data on
the use of tobacco, alcohol, illicit drugs, and mental health
variables in the U.S. The NSDUH survey is annually conduct-
ed in all 50 states and the District of Columbia, and involves
telephone interviews with approximately 70,000 randomly
selected individuals aged 12 and older. During the interval
2002­2005, approximately 1.4 million persons (0.60 percent
of the total population) aged 12 or older estimated using MA
in the past year. The highest and lowest rates of state-level MA
use were 2.02% in Nevada and 0.06% in Connecticut, respec-
tively (Figure 1).
Average state altitude data
Average state-level altitude in the U.S. was calculated using
the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) altitude data
set.35 The SRTM dataset is a high-resolution global scale digital
topographic database of the Earth covering virtually entire
land surface between ±60° latitudes. With 0.1 km spatial reso-
lution, the mean altitude of each county in the US can be ac-
curately calculated. County outlines from the National Atlas of
the United States (NAUS): County Boundaries of the United
States36 were used to obtain the mean county altitude based
432 Psychiatry Investig 2014;11(4):430-436
Altitude and Methamphetamine Use
on the SRTM mean altitude calculations for each square kilo-
meter. Four counties were not included in this NAUS data set;
one each in Montana and Georgia and two in Virginia. These
counties are not included in the analysis. The average altitude
of each county (n=3108) in 48 contiguous states and the Dis-
trict of Columbia except Alaska and Hawaii was calculated
using zonal statistics in an ArcGIS/ArcInfo 9.3 environment
(ESRI, Redlands, CA, USA). The ArcGIS/ArcInfo software is
a full-featured geographic information system for geographi-
cal database mapping. Each average state altitude was calculat-
ed using below formula;

Potential confounders
Potential confounding variables affecting MA use were ob-
tained from previous studies.5,32,33 State-level sociodemograph-
ic characteristics (population density, age, race, education, em-
ployment, and economic status), other substance use (cocaine,
heroin, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical use of
prescription pain relievers), MA laboratory incidents, and
subpopulations were included as confounders. Gender as a
confounder was excluded from the analysis model because
MA has been reported to appeal fairly equally to both men and
women.6,37 We obtained data from the 2010 Census on indi-
vidual sociodemographic state-level variables, including: age
under 18 years; White, Black, Hispanic, Asian, and American
Indian (AI) and Alaska Native (AN) populations; persons
aged 25 or over who are high school graduates; and median
household income.38 Average state unemployment rate data
was acquired from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) in the
United States Department of Labor.39 State-level cocaine, hero-
in, marijuana, alcohol, tobacco, and nonmedical prescription
pain reliever use rates were extracted from the NSDUH. The
state-level number of MA laboratory incidents in 2004 was
extracted from the National Clandestine Laboratory Seizure
System of Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) affiliated
with the US Department of Justice.40 Incidents entered into
this system are classified in one of three ways: Operational
Laboratories, Chemical/Equipment/Glassware seizures, and
Dumpsites. The manufacturing and distribution of MA are
likely to reflect the number of MA laboratory incidents. The
total number of MA laboratory incidents in the US was
18,091 in 2004. The highest number of incidents by state was
2,820 in Missouri, while no incidents were reported in Rhode
Island. State-level MA laboratory incident rates were defined
as the number of incidents per 100,000 population. The num-
ber of same sex couples per 1,000 households by state, which
may be regarded as a possible high risk subpopulation for
MA use,7 was obtained from the Williams Institute analysis of
2010 Census data.41
Data analysis
The Kolmogorov-Smirnov test was performed on each
variable to test for normality of the distribution in the data.

age, percentage of AI and AN population, MA laboratory inci-
dents per 100,000 people and heroin use rate showed skewed
distributions. Thus, logarithmic (log) transformation of these
data was carried out before correlation and regression analy-
ses. Because MA laboratory incidents per 100,000 population
for Rhode Island were 0, this was changed to 0.0001 before
log transformation. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that
this change did not alter the results.
Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated to investi-
gate the association between MA use rate and log trans-
formed mean state altitude. A simple linear regression analy-
sis was performed to analyze MA use rate as the dependent
variable, and transformed mean state altitude as the indepen-
dent variable.
To increase confidence in the significance of our results, we
performed an additional analysis that controlled for the ef-
fects of a number of possible covariates. Because this analysis
included many covariates potentially associated with MA use
rate compared to a total number of states (n=49),42 we per-
formed a two-step analysis as follows: Pearson correlation
analysis was conducted between MA use rate and the follow-
ing state-level variables: mean altitude, population density,
percentage under 18 year-old, percentage of White popula-
tion, percentage of Black population, percentage of Hispanic
population, percentage of AI and AN population, percentage
of Asian population, median household income, persons aged
25 or over who are high school graduates, unemployment rate
of 16 years of age over, same sex couples per 1000 households,
MA laboratory incidents per 100,000 people, cocaine use
rate, heroin use rate, marijuana use rate, alcohol use rate, to-
bacco use rate and nonmedical prescription pain relievers use
rate. The variables which did not reach a significance level of
p<0.05 in relation to MA use were excluded from the model,
and a multivariate linear regression analysis was conducted to
analyze the effect of significant variables from the prior cor-
relation analysis on the MA use rate.
All p-values are two-tailed, with p<0.05 considered statisti-
cally significant. Statistical Analysis System (SAS), version 9.1
(SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC, USA) was used for the compu-
tation.
RESULTS
As presented in Figure 2, there was a significant positive
correlation between 12-month state-level MA use rate and
mean state altitude (log-transformed) in the US (r=0.66, p<
0.0001). Simple linear regression analysis using MA use rate
as the dependent variable and mean state altitude as an inde-
pendent variable showed that state altitude (log-transformed)
was a significant predictor for MA use (=0.66, p<0.0001)
(Table 1). In this model, the adjusted R square value was 0.428,
suggesting that altitude accounts for a considerable propor-
tion of the variance in regional variation in MA use.
The predictor variables that we found to be significantly re-
lated to MA use included the following: mean state altitude
(log-transformed; r=0.66, p<0.0001), percentage under 18 year-
old (r=0.42, p=0.003), percentage of Black population (r=
-0.37, p=0.008), percentage of AI and AN population (log-
transformed; r=0.64, p<0.0001), MA laboratory incidents
per 100,000 people (log-transformed; r=0.61, p<0.0001), and
heroin use rate (log-transformed; r=-0.49, p<0.0001). Popu-
lation density, percentage of White population, percentage of
Hispanic population (log-transformed), percentage of Asian
population, median household income, persons aged 25 or
over who are high school graduates, unemployment rate of
16 years of age over, same sex couples per 1,000 households,
cocaine use rate, marijuana use rate, alcohol use rate in the
past month, tobacco use rate, and nonmedical prescription
pain relievers use rate did not reach significance in relation
to MA use and were therefore excluded from the multivariate
linear regression analysis. In this regression analysis (Table 1)
that controlled for the other significant variables, mean state
altitude (log-transformed; =0.36; p=0.02) remained a sig-
nificant predictor of MA use. Consistent with the published
literature in this area, the percentage of AI and AN popula-
tion (log-transformed; =0.35, p=0.002) and MA laboratory
incident (log-transformed; =0.38, p=0.004) were also found
to be significant risk factors in this model.6,8,43,44 However, the
percentage under 18 year-old, the percentage of Black popu-
lation and the heroin use rate (log-transformed) were not
found to predict MA use in this model.

Altitude and Methamphetamine Use
DISCUSSION
Using U.S. national data at a state level, we found that self-
reported past year MA use was significantly affected by alti-
tude of residence, as well as MA manufacturing and distribu-
tion. Furthermore, the published literature regarding MA risk
factors was reviewed, and available U.S. data for potential con-
founding variables was obtained and controlled for in these
analyses. To our knowledge, this is the first such report in this
area. These analyses add to our previous findings of altitude's
association with completed suicide, major depressive episodes,
and cocaine use.30,45,46 The accumulated epidemiologic data
suggest the need for further studies to investigate the mecha-
nism of altitude's association with these clinical phenomena.
A distinctive environmental characteristic of increased al-
titude is hypobaric hypoxia. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia
might lead to the changes in oxygen-dependent neurotrans-
mission. Animal studies have demonstrated that prolonged
exposure to hypobaric hypoxia causes elevation in DA and
NE levels47 and increases the activity of tyrosine hydroxylase,
which is the rate-limiting enzyme for catecholamine synthe-
sis, in the cerebral cortex.48
There is increasing evidence showing that increased DA
and decreased 5-HT levels in the brain may be linked to the
vulnerability to cocaine and MA use. Chronic stress activates
DA release and lowers 5-HT levels.49 Stress enhances craving
for cocaine or MA, resulting in increased relapse rate in hu-
man drug abusers50,51 and increases the self-administration of
psychostimulants in animal studies.18
Dopamine hyperactivity has been regarded as a mediating
factor in sensation- or novelty- seeking personality52 as well
as impulsive behavior,23 both of which are risk factors for MA
use. Marusich et al.20 demonstrated that a multivariate assess-
ment reflecting individual differences in sensation-seeking
and impulsivity predicted acquisition, maintenance, and dose-
effect measurements of amphetamine self-administration in
rats. Iritani et al.53 showed that novelty-seeking characteristics
were associated with greater likelihood of past year crystal
MA use among young adults in the U.S. In addition, several
clinical studies have suggested that MA users with a genetic
predisposition toward elevated DA functioning are higher in
novelty-seeking.21,22
Despite some controversies,54,55 previous epidemiological
studies have consistently suggested that high altitude of resi-
dence might contribute to the increased incidence of psychi-
atric problems including suicide,46,56 severe psychological dis-
tress and major depressive episodes,45 and cocaine abuse.30
These phenomena are also closely associated with alterations
of DA and 5-HT levels in the brain.57,58 MA use among youth
has a consistent relationship with depression, and suicide likely
contributes to increased morbidity and mortality among MA
users.59 Further, positive correlations between MA use rate
and mean state altitude are consistent with the increased rate
of cocaine use, which has similar psychopharmacological
properties.
Our finding that altitude of residence is a statistically sig-
nificant predictor of MA use should be cautiously interpreted.
Previous studies have suggested that MA use is affected by
age, ethnicity, education, socioeconomic level, employment,
and other substance abuse.6,32,33 Gonzales et al.5 emphasized
that subpopulations including people who have same sex
partners are at increased risk for MA use. In addition, MA
laboratory incidents implicating MA manufacture and distri-
bution should be not overlooked as a contributing factor of the
variation in MA use.8 However, when we conducted addition-
al analyses to control for the above variables, altitude remained
a significant contributing factor of MA use.
Several limitations should be considered in interpreting our
results. First, this study was based on state-level data, resulting
in a modest sample size. Although there is considerable be-

tween-state variation in altitude, within-state variation may
be also anticipated. However, at present, substate- or county-
level MA use data is not available. Also, further studies are
needed to investigate the relationship altitude and MA use at
the individual level. Second, the relationship between altitude
and MA use requires replication in other countries which have
different social and cultural environments, but similar geo-
graphic variation, compared to the US Third, neurobiologi-
cal investigation of altitude and hypobaric hypoxia's connec-
tion with MA use should be attempted in further studies.
In conclusion, we found that mean state altitude is positively
correlated with the rate of MA use in the US and that this
finding is robust to statistical adjustment for all of the avail-
able confounding variables. These results support the hypoth-
esis that altitude accounts for a significant proportion of the
regional variation of MA use in the US The available genetic
epidemiology data indicate that environmental factors unique
to each individual person determine which class of psycho-
active drug they will use or misuse.11 Increased use of MA at
altitude could be mediated by the hypoxic stress response,
which preclinical studies show causes neuroadaptation in
both brain DA levels and the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal
axis. Further studies are needed to determine if, and how, the
changes in neurotransmission resulting from altitude-associ-
ated hypobaric hypoxia play a role in MA use.
