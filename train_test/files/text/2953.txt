Retail payments: integration and innovation
"Retail payments: integration and innovation" was the title of the joint conference organised by the European Central
Bank (ECB) and De Nederlandsche Bank (DNB) in Frankfurt am Main on 25 and 26 May 2009. Around 200 high-level
policy-makers, academics, experts and central bankers from more than 30 countries of all five continents attended the
conference, reflecting the high level of interest in retail payments.
The aim of the conference was to better understand current developments in retail payment markets and to identify
possible future trends, by bringing together policy conduct, research activities and market practice. The conference was
organised around two major topics: first, the economic and regulatory implications of a more integrated retail payments
market and, second, the strands of innovation and modernisation in the retail payments business. To make innovations
successful, expectations and requirements of retail payment users have to be taken seriously. The conference has shown
that these expectations and requirements are strongly influenced by the growing demand for alternative banking
solutions, the increasing international mobility of individuals and companies, a loss of trust in the banking industry and
major social trends such as the ageing population in developed countries. There are signs that customers see a need for
more innovative payment solutions. Overall, the conference led to valuable findings which will further stimulate our
efforts to foster the economic underpinnings of innovation and integration in retail banking and payments.
We would like to take this opportunity to thank all participants in the conference. In particular, we would like to
acknowledge the valuable contributions of all presenters, discussants, session chairs and panellists, whose names can be
found in the enclosed conference programme. Their main statements are summarised in the ECB-DNB official
conference summary. Twelve papers related to the conference have been accepted for publication in this special series
of the ECB Working Papers Series.

conference and the preparation of this conference report. In alphabetical order, many thanks to Alexander Al-Haschimi,

Abstract
Germans are still very fond of using cash. Of all direct payment transactions, cash accounts
for an astounding 82% in terms of number, and for 58% in terms of value. With a new and
unique dataset that combines transaction information with survey data on payment behaviour
of German consumers, we shed light on how individuals choose payment instruments and
why cash remains so important. We propose a two-stage empirical framework which jointly
explains credit card ownership and the use of cash. Our results indicate that the pattern of cash
usage is compatible with systematic economic decision making. Consumers decide upon the
adoption of payment cards and then use available payment media according to their transac-
tion and personal characteristics, the relative costs of cash and card usage, and their assess-
ment of payment instruments' characteristics. Whereas older consumers use significantly
more cash, the comparison with younger consumers shows that the difference in payment
behaviour is not explained by age as such but to a large extent by differences in the charac-
teristics of these two groups. It is interesting that the possession of a credit card, especially
alongside a debit card, does not significantly affect the use of cash in Germany.

Non-technical summary
The diffusion of non-cash payment instruments has proliferated widely and payment tech-
nologies have been advancing rapidly in recent years and decades. Around 91% of German
consumers currently hold debit cards and 27% credit cards. The options for cashless payments
have also been increasing in recent years, in particular since more and more retailers have
introduced point-of-sale (POS) terminals. However, cash payments in Germany seem far from
fading out: cash still accounts for an astounding 82% of all transactions and for 58% of the
value of all direct payment transactions.
The aim of this paper is to explain this enduringly high and stable intensity of cash usage by
identifying the factors which determine the adoption and use of payment media. With a new
and unique dataset that combines transaction information with survey data on payment be-
haviour of German consumers, we shed light on how individuals choose payment instruments
and why cash remains so important. Following the literature, we propose a comprehensive
empirical approach, where both the adoption decision and the intensity decision are modelled
as depending on (i) transaction and personal characteristics, (ii) the relative cost of cash and
card usage and (iii) preferences for certain characteristics of payment media (e.g. the desire
for anonymity). This approach allows us to evaluate the explanatory power of a payment
choice model and thus to assess whether the high cash intensity can be explained in economic
terms or whether it predominantly reflects habit persistence.
Our results, obtained by means of regression analysis (multivariate probit and instrumental
variable estimations), suggest that individuals seem to base their choice of payment instru-
ments and hence their use of cash on systematic decisions: payment behaviour can be ex-
plained by variables describing transaction and personal characteristics, the relative costs of
cash and card usage, and individual preferences. Whereas older consumers use significantly
more cash, the comparison with younger consumers shows that the difference in payment
behaviour is not explained by age as such but to a large extent by differences in the charac-
teristics of these two groups. Finally, we find that owning a credit card (in addition to a debit
card) does not significantly affect the use of cash in Germany.
Ceteris paribus, i.e. with current technology and given the other factors in individual deci-
sions, the share of cash in total transactions is unlikely to erode much further. However, with
further technological or behavioural shifts or with changes in the strategies of merchants and
network providers, this may change.

1. Introduction

The diffusion of non-cash payment instruments has proliferated widely and payment tech-
nologies have been advancing rapidly in recent years and decades. Around 91% of German
consumers currently hold debit cards and 27% credit cards. The options for cashless payments
have also been increasing in recent years, in particular since more and more retailers have
introduced point-of-sale (POS) terminals. However, cash payments in Germany seem far from
fading out: cash still accounts for an astounding 82% of the volume (number of transactions)
and for 58% of the value of all direct payment transactions.1 These figures imply that cash is
still being used in many payment transactions for which cashless payments at low costs for
consumers would have also been possible.
The enduringly high and stable intensity of cash usage may simply be a remnant of the past,
where cash was the sole means of payment to carry out retail transactions. If the current situa-
tion could be best described in terms of incomplete adjustment, then a massive shift away
from cash could be expected for the near future, as consumers adjust to the new economic and
technological environment. Evidently, such a shift would affect monetary policy transmission,
the aggregate cost of the payment system and seigniorage revenues.
We investigate the fundamentals of cash usage in several dimensions. We develop a choice
model and assess its performance. While this model is not built up from first principles, the
selection of variables reflect the implications of rational behaviour as laid out in the literature.
Thus a rejection of the model would cast in doubt the validity of a rational choice framework.
In turn, if this model performs well, it is demonstrated that consumers do not just cling blindly
to their past behaviour. If choice follows systematic patterns, predetermined behaviour is
ruled out.

 We are grateful for comments by Denise Côté, Stefan Gerlach, Heinz Herrmann, Thomas Laubach, Cyril
Monnet, Dimitris Georgarakos, Alexander Wolman, and many participants at presentations at the
Oesterreichische Nationalbank, the Deutsche Bundesbank, the conference on "retail payments: integration and
innovation" in Frankfurt, organised by the ECB and the Dutch National Bank, the 2009 meeting of the Austrian

Economic Association 2009 annual conference in Toronto, and the 2009 annual meeting of EEA and ESEM in
Barcelona.
1 Bundesbank survey "Payment habits in Germany", cf. Section 3. The figures are very similar to results for
Austria, where cash payments accounted for 86% of all direct payment transactions in 2005 (Mooslechner, Stix
& Wagner 2006).

On the basis of our empirical framework, we can do more to address this question. Consumers
tell us how important long term acquaintance is for their choice of payment media, and we are
able to test the economic significance of these preferences directly. Finally, we perform a
powerful indirect test . Our survey results show that the prevalence of cash usage is especially
strong among the elderly: those aged 58 or older carry out 74% of the value of their payments
with cash while the share is 59% for those younger than 582. In the diffusion of innovations, it
is quite typical that elderly people are "laggards", adopting the innovation late or never. Thus
the differential behaviour may well point to a state of incomplete diffusion. But average char-
acteristics of elderly people ­ their education, income, consumption patterns etc. ­ also differ
from those of younger people, making a deviating behaviour explicable in terms of economic
choice. We investigate the influence of age once all other characteristics are controlled for, in
order to gauge the "pure" effect of age on payment behaviour.
We employ a survey data set which provides rich information. The data set comprises trans-
action records from a payment diary as well as detailed information on various more general
aspects of respondents' payment behaviour, including self-assessed payment routines at vari-
ous spending places. We estimate a model of payment behaviour which embraces both the
decision on the personal payment infrastructure ("card adoption decision") and then ­ for a
given infrastructure ­ the share of cash payments ("intensity decision").3 Variants of this
model are estimated for observed (short-run) transactions data as well as for the self-assessed
(longer-run) payment behaviour.
Our results suggest that individuals seem to base their choice of payment instruments and
hence their use of cash on systematic decisions: payment behaviour can be explained by vari-
ables describing the nature of transactions, the characteristics of payment instruments and
individuals. The behavioural functions for young and old consumers are rather similar, and
most of the age-related differences in payment behaviour can be explained by differences in
characteristics of younger and older individuals. This makes it unlikely that the observed high
prevalence of cash payments observed for Germany is predominantly the result of habit per-
sistence. Ceteris paribus, i.e. with current technology and given the other factors in individual
decisions, the share of cash in total transactions is unlikely to erode much further. This may
2 The choice of an age of 58 as the dividing line between old and young is based on statistical tests indicating
that the cash shares for the first seven age deciles (57 and younger) are similar. See Table A2 in the appendix.
3 Note that we treat the technical payment infrastructure, such as the number of card payment terminals, as given.
For example, Markose & Loke (2003) or Rysman (2006) focus on both the demand and the supply side.

change with further technological or behavioural shifts or with changes in the strategies of
merchants and network providers.. Finally, we find that owning a credit card (in addition to a
debit card) does not significantly affect the use of cash in Germany. This indicates that credit
cards are substitutes for other non-cash payment media rather than for cash. Given that credit
cards are mainly used as payment devices in Germany and not because of their credit func-
tion, this result is not surprising4.
The paper is structured as follows. Chapter 2 describes the distinguishing features of our study
with regard to the literature. Chapter 3 develops the analytical framework upon which our
empirical model is built. The data on payment behaviour in Germany is presented in Chapter
4. Estimation results are presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 concludes.
2. Background and contribution
Following the literature, we propose a comprehensive empirical approach, where both the
adoption decision and the intensity decision are modelled as depending on (i) transaction and
personal characteristics, including the transaction structure (cf. Santomero & Seater 1996;
Whitesell 1992 or Shy & Tarkka 2002) (ii) the relative cost of cash and card usage. (Attana-
sio, Guiso & Jappelli 2002, Baumol 1952, Markose & Loke 2003, Tobin 1956) and (iii) pref-
erences for certain characteristics of payment media, e.g. the desire for anonymity or expen-
diture control (Drehmann, Goodhart & Krueger 2002; Economist 2007; Mantel 2000b).5 This
approach allows us to evaluate the explanatory power of a payment choice model and thus to
assess whether the high cash intensity can be explained in economic terms or whether it pre-
dominantly reflects habit persistence.
Our paper contributes to this literature in several respects. First, we provide evidence about
which factors (including ownership of a credit card) determine the total cash share of a given
consumer's total payments. The paper is thus positioned between the newer empirical litera-
4 In Germany overdraft credit lines of checking accounts are widespread, and people can access them using their
debit card. Almost everybody pays off credit card balances in full at the end of the month in Germany, i.e. credit
cards are typically used as payment devices and not to get credit. According to the ECB Blue Book as of
February 2009 (ECB, 2009), only 2.6 Mio. credit cards in Germany are equipped with a credit function, 11.6
Mio. credit cards are only providing delayed debit functionality.
5 Some of these hypotheses are competing. For example, Markose & Loke (2003) argue that cash and card
payments are perfect substitutes while Drehmann, Goodhart & Krueger (2002) maintain that cash and payment
cards are not perfect substitutes because cash has the distinctive feature of preserving anonymity.

ture on the demand for currency (Attanasio, Guiso & Jappelli 2002, Alvarez & Lippi 2009,
Lippi & Secchi 2009, Stix 2004) and the rich literature on the choice of payment instruments (
e.g. Borzekowski, Kiser & Ahmed, 2008; Zinman, 2009) . These two strands of the literature
have been rather separate but share many similarities; our paper contributes to recent attempts
to bridge this gap (Klee 2008). Our approach differs from the former by not only focusing on
the importance of the withdrawal technology (ATM usage) but also on the impact of available
payment options (card ownership).6 Furthermore, our interest is in the scale of cash transac-
tions, while this literature has typically studied how ATM usage affects cash demand, taking
the scale of cash transactions as given. A notable difference from the literature on the choice
of payment instruments is that we analyze both the extent and the likelihood of cash-card sub-
stitution, while many papers typically model just the latter. Also, the focus on the cash share
improves upon some previous papers which, due to data limitations, base their measure of the
usage intensity of payment instruments on usage frequency alone (e.g. debit card usage fre-
quency) without scaling for the total number of transactions (e.g. Borzekowski, Kiser &
Ahmed 2008). A distinctive feature of our approach is that we calculate the cash share by
excluding those transactions that can be carried out only using cash or cards, respectively.
Hence, our model conditions on the existence of a true choice among payment instruments.
Second, we also analyze the payment behaviour of consumers for different transaction types
or spending categories (e.g. daily retail expenditures versus gas stations). This accounts for
the robust finding in the literature that the payment behaviour differs across these categories
or types.7 Our model explicitly accounts for the simultaneity of the decision to adopt a pay-
ment card and the decision on how available payment media are used, building upon results
from the demand for currency literature (e.g. Attanasio, Guiso & Jappelli 2002).
Third, related previous studies that use microdata have often been confined to studying only a
relatively limited set of explanatory factors. For example, among the studies that analyze
cash-card substitution at the level of individuals, one strand of the literature emphasizes the
relative costs of cash and card usage, often proxied by socio-demographic variables (e.g. Stix
2004), while another strand also takes account of the role of preferences or payment attributes
(e.g. Borzekowski & Kiser 2008, Mantel 2000a). Relatively few papers explicitly account for
6 For example, Lippi & Secchi (2009) assume that the existence of payment cards does not affect the parameters
of cash demand.
7 In contrast to Bounie & Francois (2006) and Hayashi & Klee (2003), for example, we do not have information
on the physical characteristics of the point of sale (e.g. the absence of a cashier or the availability of self-service).
10 ECB

transaction characteristics, though these have been shown to be of significant importance
(Boeschoten 1998, Bounie & Francois 2006, Hayashi & Klee 2003). By contrast, we can use
direct survey information about each group of potentially important factors ­ transaction and
personal characteristics, proxy variables for the relative costs of cash and card usage, and as-
sessments of given payment medium characteristics. This, in turn, allows us to focus on the
significance of interpersonal differences, and to measure the extent of explained and unex-
plained differences in the behaviour of older and younger consumers ­ which might be of
central importance for predicting the future of cash. To our knowledge, this issue has not been
addressed in detail in the literature.8
3. Analytical Framework
In order to fix ideas, we will first outline the individual's decision problem in a transaction
cost model. Individual i chooses a payment structure to minimize transaction costs. A pay-
ment structure is a vector

More specifically, let the first entry, 0

p ... p
  , to transactions associated with various non-cash payment instruments. The ex-
pected total transaction volume, i
T , is given, as are the characteristics of the individual,
i
x .
Transaction costs are given as a function of the payment structure and various individual
characteristics, including the planned structure of expenditure. For example, the relative costs
of using cash or credit cards will depend on whether a person likes to dine out or whether this
person orders over the internet. We assume that it is possible to pay cash in every situation
and that the marginal transaction costs of cash are constant. They are normalized to 1. Mar-
ginal costs of other payment alternatives depend on the individual's characteristics. The costs
of using a given medium of payment vary across transaction types ­ it is easy to pay cash in a
8 Borzekowski & Kiser (2008) are the only example we are aware of. In particular, in a counterfactual exercise
the population is "aged" and the authors analyze how this affects market shares of various payment instruments
in the U.S. In contrast to our approach, however, these market shares are only hypothetical, not accounting for
the transaction intensity.

retail market, yet many retail markets will only reluctantly accept credit cards. Similarly, time
costs differ (Klee, 2008). Ex post, we may always order transactions by the ease with which
they can be carried out using a given payment instrument. Therefore, by definition, the mar-
ginal costs of using this payment instrument as opposed to cash will increase. In order to ex-
pose the general structure of the problem, we may assume the following (quadratic) transac-
tion costs function:

This leads to simple first order conditions and can be seen as a second order approximation to
any more complicated cost function. Here, k

x gives the costs of the first (and cheapest)
transactions using the means of payment k. The coefficient k

it will not be worthwhile to use payment instrument k at all, because even the first transaction
will be more expensive than cash. If the inequality does not hold (and cash is used at all), then
a positive number of payments will be made using k .
Thus, the decision is the outcome of a cost minimization problem subject to non-negativity
constraints regarding the elements of

p and the constraint that the sum of payments adds up
to the individual's specific transaction volume:

As it stands, this is a corner solution model, one of the ways the general censored regression
model can be interpreted (see Wooldridge 2002, pp. 517). The solution yields a range of ac-
tively used payment instruments, together with the quantities for those in active use. Adoption
and the choice of intensity are really just different aspects of the same decision.
12 ECB
Working Paper Series No 1144
December 2009
In a more complex reality, however, there may also be fixed costs for the use of certain pay-
ment media, such as credit card fees, paperwork, learning costs or other restrictions such as
credit constraints (cf. Zinman 2009). Furthermore, unobserved variables may influence the
adoption and intensity decisions in different yet correlated ways. We therefore choose to
model the decisions on adoption and intensity in a less integrated way, using limited informa-
tion estimators (probit estimations for the adoption decision and instrumental variable regres-
sions for intensity) as well as full information maximum likelihood estimators (multivariate
probit estimation for payment instrument adoption and self-assessed payment instrument use
for different transaction types).
In our dataset, we observe the adoption decisions (ownership) for a variety of payment media.
However, not owning a debit card is a rare exception in Germany, and non-cash payment me-
dia other than debit and credit cards are either not widespread or used rather infrequently.
Therefore, we will focus on cash, debit cards and credit cards.
We have two different sources for measuring payment instrument usage: the payment diary
yields transaction data for a short period of time (one week), and the interviews give us self-
assessments for the use of cash and a variety of non-cash payment media, by type of transac-
tion. When using the payment diary transaction data, we estimate structural relationships for
the share of cash in total payments:

Our short-run transaction data is rather noisy, as we follow individuals for only one week.
Furthermore, payment behaviour is likely to depend very much on the type of transaction.
Therefore a second set of estimations combines, in a series of multivariate probits, the credit
card adoption decision with the prevalence of cash payments for two different types of trans-
actions, namely payment behaviour in daily retail transactions and at gas stations. In the two
payment behaviour equations, the LHS variable j
i
pv (prevalence) assumes a value of 1 if the
individual generally and exclusively uses cash for transaction type j (daily retail or gas sta-
tion).

Again, appropriate identifying exclusion restrictions have to be imposed on

error terms of all equations are allowed to be correlated. This is a recursive simultaneous
equation model of the adoption decision and transaction type specific intensities, both meas-
ured as discrete variables. See Maddala (1983, p. 122) on the model and Burnett (1997) for an
application.9
In modelling the payment decision, we make a distinct effort to take due account of individu-
als' heterogeneity by conditioning on their assessment of the characteristics of payment in-
struments and the structure of expenditure. Regarding certain characteristics of payment in-
struments, like convenience or anonymity, we use direct measures, as they will be evaluated
by different individuals in different ways. In addition, we include measures of the frequency,
of transaction types, as there may be supply constraints that induce a propensity to use a pay-
ment instrument in one context more than in the other.
4. The Dataset
The data for this study are drawn from "Payment Habits in Germany", a representative survey
of individuals aged 18 years or older living in Germany. The survey was conducted by Ipsos
on behalf of the Deutsche Bundesbank in April, May and June 2008. Based on a random sam-

Länder.10 The interviews were conducted face-to-face using a programmed questionnaire tool
(CAPI). A special feature of the survey is that the face-to-face interviews were supplemented
with a drop-off payment diary which was to be completed by the interviewed person in the
seven days following the interview (2,227 persons returned the drop-off diary).
The payment diary collects information on all individual transactions the interviewed person
conducts during a one-week period (in total, more than 25,500 transactions were recorded)11.
These include the euro amount of each transaction, the type of location where the transaction
took place (shop, restaurant, internet, etc.) and the payment medium used to settle it (cash and
a list of ten cashless payment methods, e.g. debit cards, credit cards, internet payment ser-
vices, mobile phone payments, fingerprint payment). The persons keeping the diary were
furthermore asked to indicate whether they would have been able to settle a given transaction
in cash in the event that they had paid with a non-cash instrument and vice versa.
The CAPI interviews supplement this information by providing data on various aspects of a
person's payment behaviour, like ownership of payment cards, assessments of certain features
of payment methods (anonymity, convenience, expenditure control, etc.) and on cash with-
drawal behaviour. Additionally, the survey contains questions on factors that may influence
an individual's decision to pay cash or use alternative methods of payment, such as demo-
graphic characteristics and income.
The next two subsections give an overview of how the data from the survey are used to con-
struct both the dependent and the explanatory variables. Table A1 in the appendix contains
further details.
4.1. Dependent Variables
The first stage of our empirical analysis is directed towards the decision to adopt a credit card.
Given the analytical framework and data characteristics, we restrict our sample to persons
10
The sampling technique comprised three stages. In the first stage, regions were selected ("sample points"),
which were used to define starting points/addresses for the second stage, in which interviewers contacted
households based on a random route procedure. Finally, an eligible person in each contacted household was
randomly selected.
11 We only collect information on direct payment transactions in the analysis, i.e. all transactions apart from
recurrent transactions, which are typically settled by direct debit or by bank transfers (e.g. rent, insurance fees,
telephone bills, utility bills).
15

who own a debit card ("Maestro", "`EC' card", "girocard").12 This restriction takes account of
the fact that almost all (adult) respondents own a debit card and hardly anybody owns a credit
card without also owning a debit card. The lack of variation renders it difficult to implement a
meaningful econometric model of the debit card adoption decision.
For the second stage, the intensity decision, we focus on two types of dependent variables,
both of which measure the intensity of cash usage of an individual. These variables differ in
several respects and allow us to address different aspects of the payment behaviour.
(i) For our first dependent variable, we use the individual transaction record and calculate
for each person the volume share of cash expenditures
i
s , i.e. the share based on the
number of transactions. Importantly, the cash share is calculated only for those trans-
actions for which the respondent was actually confronted with a choice, i.e. we ex-
clude those cash or card transactions where no other medium of payment was accepted
by the merchant.
(ii) The second set of dependent variables focuses on the payment behaviour for particular
expenditure types (e.g. daily retail transactions and gas stations). In particular, during
the CAPI interviews respondents were asked to indicate how they usually pay at vari-
ous spending locations, choosing among one or more payment media from a given list
(e.g. "cash", "debit card", "credit card"). Using this information, we construct a binary
variable which takes a value of one if an individual pays generally or exclusively cash
and zero if an individual either partly or exclusively uses non-cash media of payments
for the given type of transaction. In the empirical model, we consider this binary vari-
able to be the observed counterpart to the latent variable which measures the share of
non-cash expenditures. As regards the choice of expenditure types, we select those
types for which we observe the highest total expenditure during the one-week diary
period (grossed up over all persons): daily retail expenditure and gas stations.13
12 Persons not owning any cards (165 obs.) will ­ by definition ­ not be able to make any POS transactions by
media other than cash (their cash intensity is 100%). They are therefore excluded from our analysis. We also
exclude those stating that they use a debit card but do not hold an account (23 obs.).
13 In principle, the information about the cash share for different expenditure types could also be extracted from
the short-run payment diary data. However, most of the transactions recorded in the diary are retail transactions
(44 %) and no other spending place reaches more than 10% of total transactions recorded. Thus, there is only a
very small number of transactions other than retail. Given that we also exclude transactions where no alternative
media of payment was accepted, the number would be even lower. Therefore, we resort to the long-run payment
behaviour as described by the CAPI data.
16 ECB
Working Paper Series No 1144
December 2009
Descriptive statistics for the dependent variables are summarized in Table 1. The table reports
summary statistics for value shares and volume shares (numbers of transactions), both for all
payments and the subset that excludes those cash payments where no alternative payment
media were accepted. Furthermore, the binary variables reporting self-assessed payment be-
haviour in retail shops and at gas stations are described. Subsequently, we will refer to the two
types of payment data as short-run (payment diary) and long-run (CAPI). It should be borne
in mind that the two sets of variables differ by their time horizon, their content (actual behav-
iour versus self-assessed behaviour) and their source (transaction records vs. personal inter-
view). Evidently, they also differ by their scope (observed overall share of cash expenditures,
a continuous variable, versus a latent variable for the share of cash expenditures for particular
types of expenditure), such that different estimation techniques are required. In light of these
substantial differences, we are convinced that considering the results for both sets of variables
will constitute a rather solid basis for making judgments on the robustness of our findings.
4.2. Explanatory variables
In selecting the independent variables we follow the literature. Our model includes measures
of income, consumption patterns, the user cost of cash, assessments of specific characteristics
of payment instruments, a network density measure as well as several socio-demographic
variables. As the list of potentially relevant independent variables is quite long, we will
briefly describe the most relevant variables and their expected effects on the adoption and
intensity decision. Summary statistics are shown in Table 2.
Income is mainly important for the adoption decision where it plays a dual role. First, house-
hold income (HH_INCOME) measures the scale of transaction or the composition of expen-
ditures and should be positively correlated with the utility from card ownership. Second, in-
come affects the willingness of banks to grant credit cards to costumers. As a monitoring de-
vice, banks observe income which is transferred onto a given account. Therefore, we con-
struct a variable that measures the net income of a person if this person has an account
(ACCOUNT_INC). If a person does not own an account but nevertheless has access to an
account (e.g. joint account with a partner) this variable takes on the value of the household

17

income. In both cases, the variable proxies the financial situation of the respondent as ob-
served by banks. The willingness of banks to approve credit cards is also related to the type of
banks where respondents have their account. In particular, direct banks do not have branches
and supposedly are more inclined to issue payment cards than banks with a dense network of
branches or ATMs (DIRECTBANK).
Even when accounting for income, heterogeneity in the composition of consumption expen-
diture can be substantial. For example, those conducting internet transactions will have a
higher non-cash share of expenditure than those who do not make such transactions. The
transaction data from the diary cover a period of only one week, and the recorded transactions
are rather heterogeneous with respect to both their type and their size. Controlling for the
structure of the recorded transactions is therefore essential. Therefore, we control for both of
these effects. Regarding transaction types, we use the frequencies of expenditure relating to
(1) durable goods, (2) gas stations, (3) restaurants, hotels and cafes, (4) services (at home and
outside home), (5) drugstores, vending machines and leisure, and (6) other, with daily retail
being the reference category. In addition, we include the average value of transactions
(AVG_VAL_TRANS), as the relative costs of using cash or card (by transaction) can be ex-
pected to vary strongly with the size of payments.
The costs of cash and card usage should both affect the adoption and the intensity decision.
Our dataset allows us to consider three types of cash-related costs. First, we include the time
(in minutes) it takes the respondent to get to the location where cash is usually withdrawn (a
bank or an ATM, whichever is closer ­ DIST_WITHDR). The second type of cash-related
cost arises from the subjective risk of being robbed or pick-pocketed (RISK_THEFT). We
also include a variable for measuring the availability of payment cards at the POS. In particu-
lar, we have constructed a dummy variable which measures whether respondents are frequent
users of ATMs (ATM_USER) ­ as the payment function and the withdrawal function are
usually integrated on the same card. The availability of this card in the wallet eases its use for
payments, thereby reducing the cost of card usage relative to cash usage.
The density of the POS terminal network differs regionally ­ a higher POS terminal density
should reduce the net costs of card adoption and, evidently, should decrease the share of cash
expenditures. We generate a measure for POS density from the survey data. For all transac-
tions recorded in the payment diary, respondents register whether payment can be carried out
using cards. The survey sample is regionally clustered, and we calculate ­ region by region ­
18 ECB
Working Paper Series No 1144

the share of points-of-sale that allow cashless payments (POS_DENSITY). The value thus
obtained is region-specific.
We also consider assessments of certain payment instruments' characteristics. In particular,
respondents were questioned about what characteristics they consider important for a payment
instrument. Among our conditioning variables is information on whether the following char-
acteristics are of high importance for the value of a payment instrument: protection of pri-
vacy/anonymity (P_ANONYMITY), the possibility to make payments abroad (P_ABROAD),
the possibility to make payments on the internet (P_INTERNET), long-lasting experience
with a payment instrument (P_HABIT), the time needed for effecting payments (P_TIME)
and the facilitation of expenditure control (P_EXPCONTR).14 In general, these indicators are
equal to 1 if the respondent assesses the respective characteristic as "indispensable" and 0
otherwise. The other options were "rather important" and "unimportant". When constructing
P_ABROAD and P_INTERNET, we code the indicator as 1 if the respective quality is re-
garded as "indispensable" or "rather important", due to the small number of respondents
choosing the highest ranking.
Finally, we include a set of socio-demographic characteristics: gender (MALE), levels of edu-
cation (EDU_MEDIUM, EDU_HIGH, EDU_UNI), as well as dummies for labour market
status (e.g. EMPLOYED). Depending on the context (adoption or intensity), some of these
variables control for opportunity costs of time (education, employment status) or for credit-
worthiness (banks are less likely to grant access to credit cards to unemployed persons). Age,
too, might exert an effect via different channels: e.g. the shadow value of time or the propen-
sity to adapt to new technologies or the composition of expenditures. Most variables are inter-
acted with a dummy indicating an age of 58 and above ("_o" appended to the name of the
respective variable).
As discussed, our empirical framework accounts for the endogeneity of the credit card vari-
able. Identification of the instrumental variable approach requires finding variables that are
correlated with the credit card adoption decision but uncorrelated with the error term in the
intensity decision equation. In our estimations, we choose the following three variables as
instruments: DIRECTBANK, ACCOUNT_INC and JOINT_ACCOUNT, the last taking a
value of 1 if the respondent does not own a bank account, while still having access to one.
14 The formulation of this question is such that it refers to payment instruments in general and not to a particular
payment instrument.
19

The variables referring to accounts are proxies for information that banks can observe and use
when deciding whether or not to grant access to a credit card.
5. Results
5.1 Overview
Estimation results are summarized in Table 3. The adoption equation, estimated by univariate
probit, is depicted in column I. Column II summarizes OLS estimates for the share of cash
payments, and column III estimates obtained by an instrumental variable (IV) approach, ac-
counting for the endogeneity of credit card ownership.15 The multivariate probit estimates are
grouped in column IV. The estimated system contains equations explaining the prevalence of
(exclusive) cash payments in daily retail and gas stations and again the credit card adoption
decision. The results for the credit card adoption those from those reported in column I for
two reasons. First, the system estimate enhances efficiency by taking the correlation of error
terms into account. Second, the system equations can be estimated only for those respondents
who report both retail transactions and transactions at gas stations, effectively excluding peo-
ple who do not own a motorized vehicle.
We begin the discussion of our findings with a short overview of the main results and then
move on to a discussion of some detailed results regarding specific groups of explanatory
variables.
Our main question is whether a model based on economic choice is able to account for ob-
served payment patterns. With a view on the high share of cash in Germany, a plausible alter-
native could be habit persistence. Regarding this question, we want to concentrate on the
equations explaining credit card ownership and long-run payment habits (column IV). The
signs of the estimated coefficients are consistent with rational behaviour. The high predictive
power of the choice equations ­ 78% of cases are correctly classified in the adoption decision,
15 As noted above, the LHS variable is the share based on the volume of transactions. The results for the share
based on the value of transactions are very similar, qualitatively.
[INSERT TABLE 3 (RESULTS (COEFFICIENTS) OF PROBIT, OLS, IV AND
MULTIVARIATE PROBIT ESTIMATIONS) ABOUT HERE]

and 70% and 74% in the two equations describing payment patterns ­ indicates that the vari-
ables explain a significant part of the variation in payment behaviour. At the same time, we
observe that our direct measure for habit persistence (PREF_HABIT) is insignificant in all our
equations explaining cash shares or cash prevalence. Both results provide evidence against the
predominance of habit persistence.
Another very important clue comes from analysing young and old consumers separately. The
observed payment patterns of these two groups clearly differ. If habit persistence were im-
portant, we would expect that a large share of this age differential could be attributed to dif-
ferences in estimated coefficients and not to differences in characteristics. The results of a
decomposition show that most of the age gap can be attributed to differences in measured
characteristics and not to age as such. In other words, older consumers use more cash than
younger consumers mainly because they have different characteristics (e.g. lower income,
more time, etc.) and not because they are old.
We obtain important results on the role of credit card ownership in the intensity decision. Es-
timating the intensity decision equation by OLS, i.e. treating the credit card variable as ex-
ogenous, yields a negative and significant coefficient of credit card ownership. However, if
credit card ownership is treated as endogenous, the variable becomes insignificant. This result
is very robust, holding for long-term and short-term payment behaviour alike as well as for
different sets of instruments. After controlling for the fact that the adoption and the intensity
decision are driven by largely the same set of variables, exogenous variations in credit card
ownership do not seem to influence the cash share in transactions. We will discuss the impli-
cations of this finding in the conclusions.
More generally we learn that the choice and the use of payment instruments constitute a deci-
sion problem, for which many factors are relevant (cf. with Zinman, 2009). It is therefore es-
sential to jointly analyze several groups of potentially important variables ­the "broader pic-
ture"­ in order to understand the payment behaviour of individuals.
In the next sections we will discuss the details of our findings with respect to groups of vari-
ables included in our empirical model ­ transaction characteristics, relative costs of cash and
card usage, assessments of characteristics of payment instruments, demographics and credit
card ownership.

5.2 Transaction characteristics
For the OLS and IV estimations of the cash share equation using transaction data (columns II
and III), most of our choice-based variables turn out to be of limited importance. Estimates
are clearly dominated by the technical characteristics of transactions. In particular, the aver-
age value and the type of transaction are highly relevant for the observed share of cash in
transactions, whereas the other variables turn out to be mostly insignificant (two notable ex-
ceptions being ATM_USER and P_INTERNET). The high importance of the average value of
transactions corresponds well with the theoretical (Whitesell 1992) and the empirical litera-
ture (e.g. Boeschoten 1998, Bounie & Francois 2006, Hayashi & Klee 2003). In itself, the
importance of technical characteristics of payments does not run counter to an explanation in
terms of rational choice. Transaction value is certainly linked to relative costs, as is the type
of transaction. However, the result that the choice of payment instruments strongly depends
on the type of transaction could also be the result of entrenched behavioural patterns, related
to framing.
From this first set of estimates we learn two things. First, payment behaviour varies greatly by
type of transaction. It does not appear to be meaningful to aggregate across all types of
spending, and more can be learnt by analyzing transaction types separately. Second, the deci-
sion to acquire a credit card is endogenous and can lead to important biases if this is ignored.
Accounting for this endogeneity shows that credit card ownership does not significantly affect
the use of cash.
Our second set of estimates draws the practical conclusions from these lessons, as they are
conditional on type of transaction and credit card ownership. As a reminder, the latter is
treated in a simultaneous equation framework (multivariate probit estimation) with cash
prevalence (column IV). In the subsections that follow, we focus mainly on these results.
Overall, we find that all groups of explanatory variables (demographics, expenditure struc-
ture, the relative price of cash usage and preference for certain media of payment characteris-
tics) are important.
5.3 Relative costs
Our findings suggest that the relative costs of cash and card usage are important determinants
for cash use. We show that individuals using ATMs frequently tend to use less cash for their
transactions than other individuals, both in the regressions for cash share in transactions and
22 ECB
Working Paper Series No 1144

in the multivariate probit modelling long-run payment behaviour. This may seem surprising,
because for these people withdrawing cash is cheap, which should favour its use in transac-
tions. However, frequent ATM users also have their debit cards at hand most of the time,
since they need them in order to be able to withdraw money. They are also familiar with using
their cards and punching their PIN code into an electronic machine. The familiarity and per-
manent availability of non-cash payment instruments seem to drive their behaviour, rather
than the low cost of withdrawing money. A positive effect of ATM card ownership on debit
card use is also reported in Zinman (2009) for the US.
We were surprised to see that our risk of theft variable exerts a significant and numerically
strong positive effect on the propensity to use cash in daily transactions. It is conceivable that
feelings of vulnerability are correlated over means of payment, and that people who feel un-
easy with large amounts of cash are even more afraid of defraud associated with card pay-
hood of credit card adoption. This seems plausible, given that a high POS density implies that
debit card transactions are possible almost everywhere and credit cards, if solely used because
of their payment function, are redundant. This result may well be specific for Germany, where
the number of shops accepting credit cards used to be relatively small.16
5.4 Assessments of characteristics of payment instruments
Stated preferences for certain characteristics payment instruments are closely linked to the
credit card adoption decision, as expected. The results for the probit estimation of the adop-
tion equation indicate that individuals having a specific need for credit card services, e.g. to
conduct transactions on the internet or abroad, have a higher likelihood of credit card owner-
ship. Surprisingly, a preference towards long-lasting experience regarding the use of payment
instruments is associated with a higher rate of credit card ownership, at least for people under
the age of 58. For the prevalence of cash, this variable is unimportant. An interesting finding
from this block of variables is that consumers for whom the ability to use a payment instru-
ment on the internet or abroad is important pay cash less frequently at retailers and gas sta-
16 Currently, electronic point-of-sale terminals used by merchants have the technology to process both debit
cards and credit cards. However, there are transaction types, such as in grocery stores, where debit card
payments are allowed but not credit card payments. Given the technical infrastructure, the opposite is less likely,
as purely paper-based credit card payments are about to vanish. This could imply that the coefficient for the POS
density could actually reflect past rather than current POS densities, when the technology gap between debit and
credit card payments was larger.
ment. They may wish to keep control. POS_DENSITY exerts a negative effect on the likeli-

tion, a result which has previously also been reported by Hayashi and Klee (2003) and, for
debit card use, by Zinman (2009). This may be due to correlated individual-specific "technical
inclination" effects on several dimensions of behaviour, but learning effects are possible too:
the experience gained with electronic payments online and abroad may be transferred to other
spending locations.
5.5 Age and other demographic factors
Demographic factors are a third group of explanatory variables which play an important role
for adoption and intensity. The coefficients we obtain in the adoption equation are in line with
our expectations and previous findings in the literature. Relatively high household income and
high levels of education increase the probability of credit card ownership significantly.
Demographic characteristics also have a strong influence on the long-term payment behaviour
at retailers and gas stations.
By interacting all major variables17 with a dummy for old age, we put special emphasis on the
effect of age. As can be seen from the descriptive statistics in Table 1, cash prevalence, the
share of cash transactions and the level of credit card ownership are all clearly lower for older
people. However, older people and younger people differ in more respects than just age. They
also differ e.g. in employment status, income, risk aversion, etc, as is detailed in the supple-
mentary statistics in Table 2. It is of interest to assess the effect of age on cash usage that can-
not be attributed to differences in average age-related characteristics.
Actually, the effect of age as such seems to be of limited importance. First, despite the large
differences in average payment behaviour, the shift dummy variable for old age ("OLD") is
insignificant in all estimates. In the single equation probit estimation for credit card ownership
depicted in column I, only the habit variable has a significant different effect for older people.
Unlike younger people, credit card use by older people is negatively associated with a high
preference for dealing with familiar payment media. The multivariate probit equation detects
a further, equally intuitive difference: older consumers tend to dislike credit cards if they have
a high preference for quick handling of payments, unlike younger people.
It is not enough, though, to only look at differences with respect to the significance of coeffi-
17 Not interacted are the gender variable, the three indicators for education status and the frequencies of
expenditure for given transaction types included in the OLS and IV regressions.
24 ECB
Working Paper Series No 1144

cients. The insignificant differences might ­ taken together ­ generate a sizeable variation in
predicted values. We therefore analyze how much of the difference in mean predicted values
for young and old individuals can be explained by differences in characteristics, assuming that
the coefficients for young consumers also apply for old consumers (i.e. setting the old age
interaction terms equal to zero). This is done both for the estimate of the cash share and the
three multivariate probit equations.18
For the OLS estimates, 58% of the between age-group differences in the average cash share of
expenditures are explained by differences in characteristics. The remaining gap is not only
due to differences in coefficients, but can also partly be attributed to a second-order decompo-
sition effect (multiplicative effect of differences in characteristics and coefficients). For the
multivariate probit model, the explanatory power of our model is much greater. Here, it is
84% of the differences in retail cash prevalence, and 83% of the differences in gas station
cash prevalence that are purely due to between age-group differences in characteristics. The
fact that a large extent of the between-age group difference can be accounted for by observed
variables speaks for the validity of our model. For credit card ownership, differential charac-
teristics actually account for 139% of the observed differences in ownership. This "over-ex-
planation" can be attributed to the fact that credit card ownership for older people is the result
of a decision made in the past, when important characteristics like employment or household
income may have been similar to today's younger consumers.
18 For the share of cash payments, we use OLS estimates or this decomposition, as OLS is the best linear
predictor.

5.6 Robustness Checks
To assess the reliability of our findings, we conducted several robustness test. A first group of
tests concerns the estimation method. We run a series of bivariate probit models (with only
one transaction type and credit card as the independent variables) taking endogeneity into
account. In addition, we vary the number of pseudo-random draws (100, 1000, 2000) and
seeds for the multivariate probit. We also use different simulation methods (GHK, Halton
draws).
Another group of robustness checks concerns the independent variables. The OLS and IV
results presented here relate to the share of cash in the volume of transactions, and ­ as ex-
plained above ­ in calculating this share we eliminate those transactions where dealers did not
accept anything but cash. However, we also run estimates for the share of cash in the value of
transactions, and we dropped the restriction on transactions included. By and large the main
results qualitatively hold for all these different specifications.
6. Conclusions and scope for further research
We have analyzed the determinants of the cash share of German consumers' expenditure, fo-
cusing on the average payment behaviour over time. Our findings show that the choice and
the use of payment instruments follow multi-stage and multi-layered patterns. First, adoption
and use of payment media are influenced to a great extent by the same variables, hence ren-
dering joint modelling essential. In fact, neglecting this simultaneity would result in biased
estimates, and the conclusions on the effect of payment card ownership on cash usage would
be misleading. Second, we find that transaction and personal characteristics, the relative costs
of cash and card usage, and individuals' assessments of characteristics of payment instru-
ments' are important determinants of cash usage. This finding implies that the use of cash
follows predictable patterns consistent with rational economic behaviour.19 This is evidence
against habit persistence as a predominant explanation of the enduringly high share of cash.
Third, our analysis confirms the finding of the literature that payment behaviour differs across
spending categories. Fourth, we find some differences in the behavioural equations of
younger and older consumers. However, these are not overly important in terms of explaining
the differences in observed behaviour. Most of the higher prevalence of cash payments among
19 Zinman (2009) draws a similar conlusion for the use of debit and credit cards.
26 ECB
Working Paper Series No 1144

older consumers can be explained by differences in their personal characteristics, including a
number of variables measuring assessments of certain characteristics of payment instruments.
Therefore, an interpretation in terms of incomplete diffusion is not supported.
The stability of coefficient over age groups shows that, in principle, the aggregate cash use
can be forecasted, conditional on assumptions on the evolution of characteristics for young
cohorts in their old age. For a stable (ergodic) distribution of characteristics for old and young
people and their population shares, a stable cash share would result. That means that, as far as
tomorrow's old consumers will be like old consumers today, there is no shift pre-programmed
by a demographic "changing of the guard". Even if this stability of characteristics will cer-
tainly not bear out, eg concerning education, income or preferences, cash does not seem on
the verge of disappearance. From what we have seen, it seems that the high cash share in
Germany is unlikely to erode much in the near future, meaning that seigniorage revenues and
the cost of maintaining the cash payment system can be expected to remain relatively stable.
An important feature of our results is that, once endogeneity has been accounted for, credit
card ownership has no effect on the share of cash transactions. This result would be consistent
with the view that the decisions on adoption and intensity are hierarchical: the share of cash
payments is decided first, and it is left to other variables to affect the decision with which of
the available payment instruments the non-cash share is effected. The variation of costs be-
tween cash and the group of all non-cash payment instruments seems to dominate the varia-
tion within the group of non-cash payment media. In other words: the relative costs of non-
cash instruments vis-à-vis cash may be highly correlated. In any given decision context, there
does not seem to be a big difference between the costs of ­or the utility consumers derive
from­ using debit and credit cards. We view this result as a direct consequence of the institu-
tional frame of credit card usage in many European countries: overdraft credit lines of check-
ing accounts are widespread, and people can access them using their debit card. On the other
hand, almost everybody pays off credit card balances in full at the end of the month, i.e. credit
cards are typically used as payment devices. In this situation, it does not matter much for con-
sumer which of the two payment instruments they use for domestic payments). Interestingly
enough, the Economist reported that debit- and prepaid-card spending on Visa cards are ex-
pected to be higher in the U.S. this year than credit card purchases, as a result of recently
withdrawn credit lines (Economist, 2009).
This result suggests that the two competing systems of non-cash payments are close substi-
27

tutes, at least with respect to their domestic payment functionality. This could imply that only
one of them or a combination of both may survive in the long run. However, as credit cards
have some distinctive features which debit cards currently do not have, like travel insurance
coverage or the possibility to make payments abroad, it is unlikely that credit cards will dis-
appear.
Our comprehensive empirical model has demonstrated that payment behaviour is rather com-
plex. Clearly, more theoretical and empirical work is needed to fully understand the choices
consumers make. In this paper, we have concentrated on the overall cash share of a person. A
different topic of interest is the decision for each single transaction. The significant relation-
ship between the average value of transactions and the non-cash share as well as the different
coefficients in equations for different types of transaction already indicate that the specific
transaction characteristics have an influence on the choice of payment media for an individual
transaction. Another promising field for future research is to further study the role of intrinsic
characteristics of cash and cards, e.g. expenditure control features or anonymity considera-
tions ­ an issue we have only touched upon in this paper. Furthermore, our model explains
interpersonal differences, i.e. deviations from mean behaviour, but not the mean itself. In
other words, although we were able to exclude habit persistence as a dominant explanation, it
is still open why the cash share is in Germany is as high as it is. International comparisons
involving characteristics of households and their behaviour are called for to answer this ques-
tion. Ultimately, it would be interesting to study how the usage intensity of non-cash payment
instruments interacts with the demand for currency.

dependent variable is continuous and our independent variables are mostly dummies, we would not have expected
a higher R-squared. The R-squares we obtain are also similar to other studies using survey data (see e.g. Alvarez
