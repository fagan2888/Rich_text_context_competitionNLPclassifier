Trends
Why Employer-Sponsored Insurance Coverage
Changed, 1997­2003
Job quality plays a major role in workers' access to employer coverage
and the conditions that encourage take-up.
by James D. Reschovsky, Bradley C. Strunk, and Paul Ginsburg
ABSTRACT: Four and a half million Americans gained employer-sponsored health insur-
ance coverage during 1997­2001, while nearly nine million lost coverage in the ensuing
economic downturn (2001­2003), after population growth was accounted for. Macroeco-
nomic trends affecting employment, job quality, and incomes drove most of the coverage
changes, although key factors varied during the two periods. Take-up rates affected cover-
age, mostly reflecting the interaction of premium cost trends and labor-market tightness,
but take-up also was influenced by the implementation of the State Children's Health Insur-
ance Program (SCHIP) during 1997­2001. Coverage among low-income people was most
affected by economic conditions and premium costs. [Health Affairs 25, no. 3 (2006): 774-
782; 10.1377/hlthaff.25.3.774]
The census bureau reported in Au-
gust 2005 that the share of the non-
elderly U.S. population covered by
employer-sponsored health insurance fell 0.6
percentage points between 2003 and 2004.1
This decline occurred while the economy was
growing, which suggests that the long-noted
decline in employer coverage continues, con-
tributing to greater uninsurance and growing
burdens on public programs.
Researchers have long identified the state of
the economy and the cost of health insurance
as major drivers of changes in employer cover-
age rates.2 Employment levels fluctuate during
business cycles, consequently affecting peo-
ple's access to coverage. The economy also af-
fects the incomes of working families, which
influences take-up rates. Health insurance
costs primarily affect take-up rates, although
costs can also influence employers' offer and
eligibility decisions.
Two other factors have recently received
considerable attention. First is the crowding
out of private insurance by public insurance,
which is accentuated when public insurance
eligibility expands or private insurance costs
increase.3 Second are hypothesized structural
economic changes that are reducing the aver-
age "quality of jobs" by shifting employment
from larger to smaller establishments, from in-
dustries with traditionally high insurance of-
fer rates to ones with low rates, and in general
toward lower-wage jobs.4
This paper examines factors driving the
job-based insurance rate over two contiguous,
but very different, time periods: 1997­2001 and
2001­2003. We estimate that 4.5 million peo-
ple gained employer coverage during 1997­

2001, while nearly nine million lost it in the
shorter 2001­2003 period, after population
gains were accounted for. The first period was
characterized by robust economic growth and
modest growth in health care premiums; the
second period, by a short but sharp recession
in 2001 and a slow recovery along with double-
digit annual premium increases. Comparing the
factors driving changes in employer coverage
during these two periods provides insights into
the underlying dynamics of employer coverage.
Study Data And Methods
n Data source. Our analysis used the
Community Tracking Study (CTS) Household
Survey, a large, representative telephone sur-
vey of the civilian population in the contigu-
ous forty-eight states that covers a broad array
of health-related topics. We used Rounds One,
Three, and Four of the survey, conducted in
1996­97, 2000­01, and 2003, respectively. Re-
sponse rates ranged from 59 percent to 65 per-
cent. For simplicity, we refer to the periods de-
fined by the three surveys as covering 1997­
2001 and 2001­2003. All analyses used survey
weights, and standard errors account for com-
plex survey design. Our unit of analysis was
nonelderly people, providing sample sizes for
the three CTS rounds of 53,268, 51,676, and
39,262, respectively.
n Analysis. We used a shift-share analysis
to decompose changes in the coverage rate
over time into structural components. We
specified an equation explaining the coverage
rate as a function of nine factors and then as-
sessed the contribution of each factor to rate
changes by, in essence, comparing actual cov-
erage rates with those calculated to have oc-
curred had each factor been individually held
constant at its prior time-period value.5
n Components of coverage. Employment,
offer, eligibility, and take-up. As in most previous
shift-share analyses of employer coverage
rates, we investigated the role of employment
rates and conditional offer, employer coverage
eligibility, and take-up rates (the product of
which equals the job-based coverage rate).6 Be-
cause the option of family coverage is virtually
ubiquitous, provided to 99 percent of all
workers offered coverage in 2005, employ-
ment, offers, and eligibility are all defined in a
family context.7 For instance, if one family adult
has an employer coverage offer, all family mem-
bers are assumed to have access to the offer.
To better characterize how employment af-
fects access to employer coverage, we charac-
terized family employment not as simple rate,
but in terms of the percentage of the population
in families with two full-time workers, one full-
time worker, or part-time workers only.
Job quality. We extended the previous shift-
share analyses of employer coverage by adding
several additional components. We investi-
gated the hypothesized structural employ-
ment changes toward jobs that are less likely
to provide health benefits: those in smaller
firms, in certain industries, and with lower
wages. We combined these various dimen-
sions into a "job-quality" scale. Adding job
quality (conditioned on family employment)
allowed us to assess whether any changes in
offer, eligibility, or take-up rates are attribut-
able to firms' altering their benefit policies as
opposed to changes in the mix of jobs in the
U.S. economy toward or away from those his-
torically likely to provide any health benefits
or health benefits of greater or lesser generos-
ity. To create the job-quality scale, we used a
sample of full-time workers from all four
rounds of the CTS survey (N = 82,090) and re-
gressed the likelihood that their job carried
health benefits on interactions between six
employer-size variables, fourteen industry and
government categories, and four wage catego-
ries. Predicted values were then divided into
eight equal-size groups and assigned to work-
ing families. In families with multiple workers,
the best-quality job is assigned.8
FamilyincomeandSCHIPeligibility. We also in-
cluded two components that are related to the
likelihood of taking up employer coverage; this
allowed us to better isolate the role of insur-
ance costs on take-up. We accounted for
changes over time in the distribution of family
incomes among those with access to job-based
coverage. Because we already controlled for
family employment and job quality, changes in
the distribution of family incomes (expressed

as a percentage of the federal poverty level, in
five categories) are the result of changes in real
wages, hours worked, and the quality of sec-
ondary jobs. We further accounted for the ma-
jor expansion in eligibility for public insurance
among low-income children resulting from the
State Children's Health Insurance Program
(SCHIP) of 1997, which might have motivated
some to substitute public for private coverage
("crowding out").9
Nonworking and self-employed families. Finally,
some nonworking and self-employed families
retain coverage from former employers
through the Consolidated Omnibus Budget
Reconciliation Act (COBRA) or as a retiree
benefit. Consequently, the final two compo-
nents represent shifts in the coverage rates of
these two groups.
Altogether, we examined nine components:
family employment; quality of best job in the
family; insurance offer rate; insurance eligibil-
ity rate; family income; SCHIP eligibility rate;
take-up rate; coverage rate among people in
nonworking families; and coverage rate among
people in self-employed families. With the ex-
ception of the last two components, each is
conditioned on those preceding it.10

employment changed little in the earlier pe-
riod. Between 2001 and 2003, however, there
was a sizable reduction in employment, most
notably indicated by a 3.1-percentage-point
decline in the proportion of people in families
with two full-time workers and a 2.9-percent-
age-point gain in the proportion in families
with no workers.
Job quality changed little in the late 1990s
but declined in the later period. For instance,
during 2001­2003 the number of people in reg-
ular working families with jobs in the two
highest job-quality categories declined about
2.5 percentage points, while the number with
jobs no better than the two lowest job-quality
categories rose an equivalent amount. Offer
rates grew a modest one percentage point dur-
ing the earlier period but fell 2.2 percentage
points over the later period. Incomes among
those in families with access to employer cov-
erage grew during 1997­2001 and changed rel-
atively little during 2001­2003. Among those
with access to employer coverage, the percent-
age eligible for children's public insurance cov-
erage through Medicaid or SCHIP more than
doubled during 1997­2001 but was unchanged
in the later period. Take-up rates grew slightly
during the earlier period but fell 1.5 percentage
points in the later period. Finally, there was a
rapid increase in the percentage of people in
nonworking families covered by employer-
sponsored insurance over the 1997­2001 pe-
riod, a trend also found in data from the Cur-
rent Population Survey (CPS).11
n Decomposition of coverage changes.
The relative importance of the various factors
differed considerably over the two periods,
largely reflecting the different economic cli-
mates (Exhibit 2).
There was a small decline in coverage dur-
ing 1997­2001 attributable to employment
changes. This masks an increase in coverage
attributable to increased employment during
1997­1999 and likely reflects a sharp increase
in the unemployment rate during the latter
part of the survey's 2000­2001 field period. In
contrast, lower family employment accounted
for more than half of the decline in employer
coverage during 2001­2003, resulting in more
than five million people losing coverage, a fig-
ure roughly corresponding to the number of
people who lost employment during this pe-
riod, after population growth is accounted for.
The number of family workers and their full-
or part-time status, rather than whether the
family had a worker or not, are key to the like-
lihood of having job-based coverage. Had we
only characterized people as being in working

families versus nonworking or self-employed
families, employment effects in the earlier pe-
riod would have nearly disappeared, and they
would have been cut in half during the later
period.
n Job quality. Shifts in job quality had siz-
able effects on coverage rates. However, rather
than the secular decline in job quality that
some have posited, job quality appears to re-
flect business cycles.12 During the period of
economic growth in the late 1990s, job quality
improved (Exhibit 1), translating into a gain of
more than 800,000 people with employer cov-
erage. However, average job quality fell dra-
matically during 2001­2003 and is associated
with a decline of 2.8 million people with job-
based coverage. The effect of declining job
quality during 2001­2003 would have been
even greater had we used the simplified em-
ployment variable, which suggests that it was
often the best-quality job in families that was
lost.
n Offer and eligibility rates. After job
quality is controlled for, rising offer rates dur-
ing 1997­2001 increased the number of work-
ers with employment-based coverage by about
800,000, while about a half-million lost cover-
age during 2001­2003 because of fewer offers.
Somewhat surprisingly, eligibility rates in-
creased during both periods, resulting in in-
creases of roughly 300,000 people in 1997­2001
and 1.1 million in 2001­2003 with job-based
coverage. Had we not controlled for shifts in
job quality, a greater portion of the change in
coverage would have been attributed to offer
and eligibility rates.
n Income, crowd-out, and take-up. Not
only did the number of people with access to
employer coverage increase during the period
of economic growth in the late 1990s, but
among those with access to employer insur-
ance, incomes rose. Even after family work-
force participation and job quality are con-
trolled for, higher real incomes resulted in 1.1
million people taking up employer coverage
during 1997­2001, followed by a small increase
in 2001­2003.
Growth in public insurance eligibility for
children resulted in about 650,000 fewer peo-
ple taking up coverage between 1997 and 2001.
During 2001­2003, however, eligibility rules
changed little, and their effect on coverage
rates was negligible. After allowing for family
incomes and the effect of the SCHIP imple-
mentation, we saw take-up rates as increasing
employer coverage over the earlier period by
more than 800,000 individuals but decreasing
coverage over the later period by about 1.5 mil-
lion. The sizable drop in take-up during the
later period is consistent with sharp increases
in employee premium cost sharing (particu-
larly for family coverage) and in consumer cost
sharing for health care services.13
The contribution of higher take-up rates on
coverage during 1997­2001 would have been
larger had we not accounted for gains in job
quality, which indicates that higher-quality
jobs provide more-attractive insurance bene-
fits. Similarly, higher family incomes during
this period promoted take-up of insurance of-
fers, both directly and by making fewer chil-
dren eligible for public coverage. Had we ac-
counted for neither family income nor SCHIP
eligibility, take-up in the earlier period would
have been shown as modestly suppressing em-
ployer coverage, consistent with the modest
increases in insurance costs. In contrast, con-
trolling for income levels or public insurance
eligibility had negligible impacts on the take-
up effects in the later period.
n Employer coverage among nonwork-
ing families. Consistent with the patterns ev-
ident in Exhibit 1, more than a third of the in-
crease in employer coverage during 1997­2001
is attributable to an increase in the percentage
of people in nonworking families with job-
based coverage. The most likely explanation
for this phenomenon is an increase in COBRA
coverage. Between 1997 and 2000, COBRA en-
rollment grew 1.4 million, closely correspond-
ing with our results.14
n Effects on various socioeconomic
groups. Business cycles and rising health care
costs are likely to have their greatest effect on
the employer coverage of lower-income work-
ers. Consequently, we replicated our analysis
on three predicted income groups. The size
and composition of income groups change

during a business cycle. As a result, had we de-
fined the groups based on current income, we
could not have distinguished the underlying
reasons for changes in coverage from changes
in the composition of the subpopulations we
were investigating. Therefore, we defined our
groups based on predicted (or "permanent")
family incomes, based on a model in which
family income was regressed on "human capi-
tal" variables: age, race, sex, family composi-
tion, education, and health status. Income was
defined as a percentage of the federal poverty
level (less than 200 percent, 200­399 percent,
and 400 percent or more), which adjusts for
inflation and family composition. The regres-
sion used pooled data from all four CTS
rounds. Because of smaller sample sizes, public
insurance eligibility could not be included as a
component of these decompositions.
We classified 19 percent, 39 percent, and 42
percent of the population into categories of
predicted low, middle, or high socioeconomic
status (SES), representing populations equal-
ing fourty-four, eighty-nine, and ninety-six
million people, respectively. Not surprisingly,
changes in job-based coverage were felt the
most among low- and middle-income groups
(Exhibit 3). Gains in job-based coverage dur-
ing 1997­2001 were 2.3, 2.4, and 1.0 percentage
points for the predicted low-, middle-, and
high-income groups, respectively. During
2001­2003, the three groups experienced de-

clines of 4.9, 5.8, and 1.3 percentage points, re-
spectively, in their coverage rates.
Impact of economic changes. Macroeconomic
changes affected the workforce participation
of lower-income groups the most, in terms of
both increasing their employer coverage dur-
ing 1997­2001 and decreasing it during the
economic downturn of 2001­2003. For in-
stance, 2.9 percent of the predicted low-
income group lost coverage because of lower
workforce participation in the later period.
Surprisingly, the highest-income group had
declines in coverage associated with family
employment of about 0.5 percent during both
periods.
Impactofjobquality. During the earlier period,
both middle- and higher-income groups
gained coverage because of improved job qual-
ity, while the low-income group experienced a
small decline. The economic downturn during
2001­2003 likely contributed to reductions in
job quality for all income groups, accounting
for a 1.7-percentage-point reduction in the
coverage rate for those in the low- and middle-
income groups and a 0.8-percentage-point loss
among those in the highest-income group. Al-
though the percentage-point decline in the
highest-income group was the smallest, job
quality figured as the most important factor
for this group, contributing to nearly 900,000
high-income people losing employer-spon-
sored coverage.
During the earlier period, income growth
among those with access to employer coverage
had its greatest effect in rising coverage among
lower-income people. This is not surprising,
since the take-up rate among higher-income
people was already well above 90 percent. Yet
coverage rates among low-income people fell
because of lower take-up, after income is con-
trolled for.
Effects of cost sharing and take-up. Although in-
creases in average worker contributions to
premiums and cost sharing for health care ser-
vices were modest during 1997­2001, low-
wage workers were most affected.15 During the
later period, all income groups lost coverage
because of lower take-up, with the greatest ef-
fect among middle-income people, accounting
for more than one percentage point of their
5.8-percentage-point decline in coverage. Even
among high-income people, lower take-up ac-
counted for 0.4 points of their 1.3-percentage-
point decline in coverage.
Summary And Discussion
n Business cycles and other drivers of
change. Many interrelated factors influence
employer-sponsored health insurance rates.
Foremost, business cycles are important driv-
ers of short-term trends in employer coverage.
These operate primarily through workforce
participation but secondarily through the av-
erage quality of jobs and family incomes.
Higher-quality jobs are more likely to provide
both access to employer-sponsored coverage
and conditions that encourage insurance take-
up: higher wages, lower employee cost sharing,
and more generous plan benefits.
During the economic boom years of 1997­
2001, the gain in employer coverage was mod-
erated by dramatic expansions in public insur-
ance eligibility for children as a result of
SCHIP. Although crowding out can occur
through other, less direct mechanisms, the ef-
fect on take-up is likely to be the most impor-
tant component. Yet the estimated loss of cov-
erage (­667,000 workers) over the two periods
is quite modest compared with the 3.7 million
children enrolled in SCHIP and Medicaid ex-
pansion programs by 2003.16
After workforce participation, job quality,
family incomes, and SCHIP eligibility are con-
trolled for, we would expect take-up rates to
follow trends in health insurance premiums
and benefit packages. Indeed, we found a
sharp drop-off during 2001­2003, when a por-
tion of double-digit premium increases were
shifted to workers in the form of greater pre-
mium cost sharing and benefit buy-downs. Al-
though premiums grew at a modest rate dur-
ing the late 1990s, we found that take-up
increased. This suggests that benefit packages
and hence take-up are influenced by the inter-
action of both underlying costs and the tight-
ness of the labor market.
Lower- and middle-income workers are
most susceptible to business cycles. They en-

joyed the greatest gain in coverage rates in the
late 1990s but also suffered the greatest decline
in coverage in 2001­2003. Lower-income
workers are also the most susceptible to cost
pressures on the system. They alone lost cover-
age because of lower take-up during the late
1990s when cost pressures were modest.
n Future trends. What do the results por-
tend for the future? Although the improving
economy foreshadows gains in the number of
people with employer-sponsored insurance,
the recent Census Bureau numbers suggest
that other forces could continue to weaken the
employer coverage system over the long term.
Most important and well established is that
health care costs grow faster than wages, a
trend largely driven by improvements in
health care technology.17 Although this trend
briefly reversed itself in the mid-1990s at the
height of managed care's influence, there are
few technical, market, or policy tools on the
horizon likely to reverse it anytime soon.18 In-
creasing health care costs will likely continue
to depress take-up rates and, for firms that
employ mostly low-wage workers, perhaps of-
fer and eligibility rates as well. Although
higher-wage workers are likely to see the effect
in the form of lower wages and less generous
health benefits, low-income workers are the
most likely to lose employer-sponsored cover-
age altogether.
The second long-term trend concerns the
decline in job quality. Whether or not such a
decline actually exists is in dispute.19 Although
our research suggests that job quality is an im-
portant driver of employer coverage, we also
found that coverage is responsive to business
cycles. Our data series, which covers a single
business cycle, is too short to establish
whether a long-term trend exists.
Finally, the strong association between
macroeconomic trends and employer coverage
suggests that publicly sponsored health insur-
ance programs have an important countercy-
clical role. Most of the decline in employer
coverage between 2001 and 2003 was offset by
increases in public coverage through a combi-
nation of automatic stabilizers (job loss makes
some eligible) and policy changes.20 Policy-
makers should keep this in mind as they grap-
ple with Medicaid and SCHIP's severe budget-
ary strains.

5. The equation consisted of three additive compo-
nents, comprising the coverage rate for people in
regular working families, nonworking families,
and families with only self-employed workers,
weighted by population shares. The first compo-
nent, accounting for roughly 80 percent of the
nonelderly population, is further specified as the
product of conditional offer, eligibility, and take-
up rates in 240 subgroups defined by three family
employment, eight job quality, five family in-
come, and two child public insurance eligibility
categories, which is aggregated by weighting

contribution of these last four factors to coverage
rate changes was assessed by manipulating their
population shares. A covariance term is also part
of the equation. We suppressed it by ratio adjust-

tend to have higher incomes, the measure is inde-
pendent of secular income trends or changes in
the tendency of specific types of jobs to carry

the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) employer
wage index.
