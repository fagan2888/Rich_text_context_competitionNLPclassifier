The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a quantitative
measure of variability in the size of circulating erythro-
cytes with higher values reflecting greater heterogeneity in
cell sizes. Although RDW is routinely reported to physi-
cians in clinical practice as part of the automated complete
blood count (CBC), it is currently mainly used as an auxil-
iary index in the differential diagnosis of microcytic ane-
mia. Iron deficiency anemia is associated with a high RDW,
whereas thalassemia syndromes produce red blood cells
(RBCs) of more homogenous size.
A few studies recently showed that higher RDW, even
within the normal reference range, was strongly associated
with increased risk of death and cardiovascular disease
(CVD) events in middle-aged and older adults (1­7). Al-
though the exact mechanisms are unclear, this association is
provocative because it is independent of numerous factors,
including nutritional status, anemia, inflammation, and age-
associated diseases (5). Furthermore, RDW significantly
improved mortality risk prediction beyond established risk
factors, as assessed by several indices of model calibration
and discrimination (5). Given that higher RDW is associ-
ated with advancing age and higher disease burden (5), it is
possible that RDW is a novel biomarker that reflects multi-
ple physiological impairments related to aging.
Of the previous studies that examined RDW and mortal-
ity, all but one were performed in patients with clinically

Background. Red cell distribution width (RDW) is a quantitative measure of variability in the size of circulating
erythrocytes with higher values reflecting greater heterogeneity in cell sizes. Recent studies have shown that higher RDW
is associated with increased mortality risk in patients with clinically significant cardiovascular disease (CVD). Whether
RDW is prognostic in more representative community-based populations is unclear.
Methods. Seven relevant community-based studies of older adults with RDW measurement and mortality ascertain-
ment were identified. Cox proportional hazards regression and meta-analysis on individual participant data were
performed.
Results. Median RDW values varied across studies from 13.2% to 14.6%. During 68,822 person-years of follow-up
of 11,827 older adults with RDW measured, there was a graded increased risk of death associated with higher RDW
values (p < .001). For every 1% increment in RDW, total mortality risk increased by 14% (adjusted hazard ratio [HR]:
1.14; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.11­1.17). In addition, RDW was strongly associated with deaths from CVD
(adjusted HR: 1.15; 95% CI: 1.12­1.25), cancer (adjusted HR: 1.13; 95% CI: 1.07­1.20), and other causes (adjusted HR:
1.13; 95% CI: 1.07­1.18). Furthermore, the RDW­mortality association occurred in all major demographic, disease, and
nutritional risk factor subgroups examined. Among the subset of 1,603 older adults without major age-associated
diseases, RDW remained strongly associated with total mortality (adjusted HR: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.21­1.44).
Conclusions. RDW is a routinely reported test that is a powerful predictor of mortality in community-dwelling
older adults with and without age-associated diseases. The biologic mechanisms underlying this association merit
investigation.

significant CVD. Whether RDW is prognostic in more rep-
resentative community-based populations requires further
investigation. The aim of the current study was to quantify
the association of RDW with total and cause-specific mor-
tality in seven population-based studies of older adults with
varied health and demographic compositions. Specifically,
we characterized the dose­response relationship and as-
sessed its consistency across the studies as well as in major
subgroups of older adults.
Methods
Study Populations and Design
Individual participant data of older adults were analyzed
from six cohort studies developed in collaboration with the
Laboratory of Epidemiology, Demography, and Biometry,
National Institute on Aging/National Institutes of Health. In
addition, publicly available data on older adults who par-
ticipated in the Third National Health and Nutrition Exami-
nation Survey (NHANES III) were also analyzed. Table 1
provides a description of the studies included in the meta-
analysis. (A search of the MEDLINE and EMBASE data-
bases from 1974 to June 2009 using red cell distribution
width or RDW and mortality as search terms did not iden-
tify additional community-based studies for inclusion in
this analysis.) In all seven studies, RDW was measured as
part of the automated CBC and participants were subse-
quently followed for mortality. Although each study cohort
was composed of community-dwelling older adults, the
goals of the studies varied and therefore the sampling pro-
cedures and target populations differed accordingly. The
Women's Health andAging Study I (WHAS I), for instance,
sampled moderately to severely disabled women aged 65
years and older, whereas the Health, Aging, and Body Com-
position Study (HealthABC Study) recruited well-function-
ing men and women aged 70­79 years from a Medicare
sample within selected zip codes. The InCHIANTI ("Invec-
chiare in Chianti," aging in Chianti area) Study, NHANES
III, and the New Haven site of the Established Populations
for the Epidemiologic Studies of the Elderly (EPESE) used
probabilistic methods to sample men and women aged 65
years and older regardless of functional status, whereas the
East Boston and Iowa EPESE sites recruited all older per-
sons in their geographical areas. CBCs were collected at the
baseline visit in the InCHIANTI Study, NHANES III, and
WHAS I; 2 years after baseline in the Health ABC Study;
and 6 years after baseline in the East Boston, Iowa, and New
Haven sites of the EPESE.
Adjustment Variables
A standard set of variables that might confound the as-
sociation of RDW with mortality was available in each
study. This included information on demographic and health
behavior­related factors (age, sex, race, education level,

smoking history, and body mass index [BMI]) as well as
age-associated medical conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart
attack, hypertension, and stroke). Self-reported data on race
were included because of known differences in the distribu-
tion of some CBC parameters by race, including RDW (5),
and the differential effect of hemoglobin concentration on
mortality by race (8). Laboratory measures included serum
creatinine, serum albumin, hemoglobin concentration, and
mean corpuscular volume (MCV). The four-variable abbre-
viated Modification of Diet in Renal Disease Study formula
was used to calculate estimated glomerular filtration rate
(eGFR) (9). For subgroup analysis, chronic kidney disease
was defined as eGFR less than 60 mL/min/1.73 m2 and ane-
mia was defined as hemoglobin concentration less than 13
and less than 12 g/dL in men and women, respectively. In
addition, deficiencies in iron, folate, and vitamin B12 were
determined in the InCHIANTI Study, NHANES III, and
WHAS I using previously established criteria (10­13).
Statistical Analysis
Descriptive statistics were used to examine the baseline
characteristics of each study sample (Table 2). To assess the
shape of the RDW-to-mortality relationship, hazard ratios
(HRs) for RDW divided into nine categories were obtained
with data combined from all studies using a Cox propor-
tional hazards model that adjusted for age, sex, and study
(Figure 1). The proportional hazards assumption was con-
firmed by examining plots of Schoenfeld residuals. Test of
trend was performed by entering RDW as an ordinal vari-
able. HRs for RDW as a continuous variable were then
obtained from each study separately using Cox models ad-
justed for age, sex, education, race, smoking status, BMI,
eGFR, hemoglobin concentration, MCV, serum albumin,
and medical conditions (cancer, diabetes, heart attack, hy-
pertension, and stroke). (A Cox model fitted with a penal-
ized spline for RDW as a continuous variable confirmed a
linear association with mortality.) As per established meta-
analysis methods (14,15), a random-effects model was then
used to pool these HRs and determine the overall effect of
RDW on total mortality and assess the consistency of effect
across studies (Figure 2). These analyses were repeated to
separately examine cause-specific mortality outcomes, in-
cluding CVD, cancer, and other deaths (Figure 3). Finally,
Cox models were estimated with the pooled data to de-
termine whether RDW predicted mortality in various
subgroups adjusting for age, sex, and study (Figure 4). Sta-
tistical interactions were tested to determine whether the
effect of RDW on mortality varied by subgroups. Analyses
were completed using Stata/SE version 10.1 (StataCorp,

puting (Vienna, Austria). Associations with p values < .05
were considered statistically significant.
Results
The characteristics of the studies included in the meta-anal-
ysis are reported in Table 1. Among the 11,827 older adults
with RDW measured, there were a total of 3,985 deaths that
occurred during the 68,822 person-years of follow-up. Table 2
shows the baseline participant characteristics for each cohort
study. Median RDW values varied across studies from 13.2% to
14.6% and were generally higher in the older cohorts (Table 2).
The mean ages in the studies ranged from 73.6 to 79.1 years;
women comprised the majority in each of the studies. Racial/
ethnic minorities were included in four of the studies with the
proportion of blacks ranging from 7.8% to 38.4%.
Figure 1 shows that mortality risk increased steadily with
higher levels of RDW (p for trend <.001) adjusting for age,
sex, and study. Compared with a reference RDW less than
12.5%, the HRs were significantly increased for RDW greater
than 12.9%. Mortality risk was nearly doubled in participants

with RDW of 14.0%­14.9% (adjusted HR = 1.77; 95% con-
fidence interval [CI]: 1.53­2.04) and more than doubled in
those with RDW greater than 14.9% (adjusted HR = 2.51;
95% CI: 2.16­2.91) relative to the reference group.
In all the studies, RDW was a significant predictor of to-
tal mortality (p < .001; Figure 2). Adjusting for multiple
factors, mortality risk increased by 14% for every 1% incre-
ment in RDW (adjusted HR = 1.14; 95% CI: 1.11­1.17). A
formal test of heterogeneity showed that this association
was consistent across studies (p = .32). The meta-analyses
also showed that RDW was significantly associated with
each of the three cause-specific outcomes examined (Figure 3),
although the association with CVD mortality was slightly
stronger than with cancer and other causes of mortality.
In addition, RDW significantly predicted total mortality
in all the major subgroups shown in Figure 4, adjusting for
age, sex, and study. Although there were significant RDW
by age group interactions whereby RDW was more strongly
associated with mortality in adults aged 65­74 years than
in those aged 75­84 years (p < .001) and 85 years and older
(p < .001), the effect of RDW on mortality was significant
in each of the three age groups even adjusting for age as a
continuous variable within these strata. No significant sex
differences were observed in the association of RDW with
mortality. The effect of RDW was weaker in blacks than in
whites (p for RDW by race interaction = .011), but again,
higher RDW was significantly associated with increased
mortality for both racial groups. There was no significant
variation in the effect of RDW on mortality across sub-
groups defined according to smoking status, BMI category,
and individual diseases, although the association was sig-
nificantly weaker in anemic than in nonanemic older adults

(p for RDW by anemia interaction <.001). Notably, RDW
was significantly associated with mortality in the subgroups
shown in Figure 4 even after further adjusting for covari-
ates used in Figures 2 and 3 (results not shown). Further-
more, among the subset of 1,603 older adults without any
of the major age-associated medical conditions (anemia,
cancer, chronic kidney disease, diabetes, heart attack, hy-
pertension, and stroke), RDW remained a strong predictor
of mortality adjusting for age, sex, race, education, smok-
ing status, BMI, eGFR, hemoglobin concentration, MCV,
and serum albumin (adjusted HR for 1% increment in
RDW: 1.32; 95% CI: 1.21­1.44; number of deaths = 355).
Nutritional deficiencies were determined in the InCHI-
ANTI Study, NHANES III, and WHAS I. The association
of RDW with mortality occurred in participants with iron,
folate, and/or vitamin B12 deficiencies (adjusted HR for 1%
increment in RDW: 1.16; 95% CI: 1.09­1.24) as well as in
those without these deficiencies (adjusted HR for 1% incre-
ment in RDW: 1.22; 95% CI: 1.18­1.27) adjusting for age,
sex, and study (data not shown). There was no statistical
interaction between RDW and nutritional status in predict-
ing mortality (p = .283). The results remained essentially
unchanged when additionally adjusting for covariates used
in Figures 2 and 3.
Discussion
In this collaborative analysis of 11,827 community-
dwelling older adults in seven cohort studies, RDW was
a remarkably consistent and strong predictor of total and
cause-specific mortality. There was a clear gradient in
mortality risk associated with increasing RDW values.
For every 1% increment in RDW, the risk of death in-
creased by 14%. This association was independent of
several established risk factors for death in older adults,
including hemoglobin concentration. Furthermore, the
association occurred in all the major demographic, dis-
ease, and behavioral and nutritional risk factor subgroups
examined as well as in older adults without major
age-associated medical conditions. Considering that the
distribution of RDW varied between cohorts and yet sig-
nificantly predicted mortality in each of them indicates
that greater variability in RBC volume is a risk factor for
death in older adults.
The mechanisms through which RDW increases with age
and is associated with mortality have not been defined;
however, it is possible that oxidative stress and inflamma-
tion play a role given that both can reduce RBC survival
(16,17), leading to a more mixed population of RBC vol-
umes in the circulation. In patients with conditions charac-
terized by increased levels of oxidative stress, such as Down
syndrome (18), poor pulmonary function (19), and dialysis
(20), RDW values are elevated. Analyses of the NHANES
III data showed that decreased serum antioxidant levels, in-
cluding carotenoids, selenium, and vitamin E, were also as-
sociated with increased RDW, although adjusting for these
antioxidants did not meaningfully attenuate the RDW-to-
mortality association (5). In addition to reduced RBC sur-
vival, inflammation might further influence RDW levels by
disrupting erythropoiesis. Indeed, it is believed that the in-
creased prevalence of anemia with advancing age is due, in
part, to the effects of proinflammatory cytokines on inhibit-
ing the proliferation of erythroid progenitor cells and down-
regulating erythropoietin receptor expression (17,21,22).
Perturbations in erythropoiesis can lead to more variation in
cell sizes exiting the bone marrow and might increase RDW.
Importantly, however, RDW was more strongly associated
with mortality in nonanemic than in anemic older adults
(Figure 4). In the NHANES III, adjustment for C-reactive
protein, fibrinogen level, and white blood cell count did not
substantially alter the effect of RDW on mortality, even
though each of these factors was strongly related to RDW
and mortality (5).
Interestingly, the association of RDW with mortality was
significantly stronger in healthier older adults without major
age-associated diseases than in those with disease (p for inter-
action <.001). It is conceivable that there are subclinical dis-
ease processes that cause subtle dysregulation of erythrocyte
homeostasis that is expressed in RDW. Given that RDW was
significantly associated with CVD mortality and cancer mor-
tality, it might be that RDW predicts the occurrence of these
diseases as well as other age-associated conditions. Further re-
search is needed to understand the pathways through which
RDW is associated with mortality.
Previous studies on RDW were mainly performed in co-
horts or randomized trials of patients with significant CVD
(1­4,7). Although these studies showed that RDW was
strongly related to CVD events as well as all-cause mortality,
data from the NHANES III showed that RDW significantly
predicted deaths from CVD, cancer, chronic lower respira-
tory tract disease, and other causes except external ones (e.g.,
traffic accidents) (5,6). As RDW is associated with multiple
causes of death, it is plausible that RDW is influenced by
multiple diseases and is an integrative biomarker of dysfunc-
tion and impairment across physiological systems.
The clinical utility of RDW beyond its current use in the
diagnosis of certain anemias needs to be evaluated. A few
studies have shown that RDW might be a useful screening
marker for celiac disease, colon cancer, and acute coronary
syndromes in emergency department settings (23­25). In
terms of mortality risk prediction, RDW significantly
improved model performance in the NHANES III cohort
beyond established risk factors for adults aged 45­64 years
and 65 years and older (5). However, whether RDW im-
proves risk stratification for individual conditions, such as
myocardial infarction or congestive heart failure, is un-
known and should be investigated.
The current study does have some limitations that should
be considered. First, RDW was assessed in several different
laboratories. Although almost all modern automated blood
RDW AND MORTALITY IN OLDER ADULTS 265
cell counters report RDW as the coefficient of variation of
red cell volume, algorithms used to eliminate artifacts and
outliers vary to some extent between manufacturers, and
recommendations for standardization of cell sizing have not
been uniformly adopted (26­28). Nonetheless, there was no
evidence of heterogeneity among studies in the association
of RDW with mortality. Second, RDW was assessed on a
single occasion that might be influenced by biologic vari-
ability or measurement error, although such errors are likely
to attenuate the observed associations between RDW and
mortality. Third, despite adjusting for multiple risk factors
and prevalent diseases, it is possible that there may be re-
sidual confounding from conditions and medications not
included in the analysis.
In summary, RDW is a newly recognized and powerful
predictor of mortality in community-dwelling older adults
with and without major age-associated diseases. The bio-
logic mechanisms underlying this association merit investi-
gation. Considering that RDW is an inexpensive test that is
routinely reported to physicians, further research is needed
to determine whether RDW is a useful risk assessment tool
in different clinical settings.
