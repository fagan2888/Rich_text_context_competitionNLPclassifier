INTRODUCTION
In a study of cigarette smoking and sick leave in
an industrial population in Shanghai (Wang and
Dobson, 1992), the authors claim that `cigarette
smoking is one of the most preventable factors
contributing to illness, disability and death in the
world'. The limited research on smoking in China
has painted a grim picture: Holden argues that `if
current smoking patterns persist, tobacco will
cause more than a third of all deaths among
middle-aged Chinese men over the next few
decades' (Holden, 2001). Yang et al. predict that
as the world's largest producer and consumer of
tobacco, 2 of the 7 million deaths related to
smoking will occur in China (Yang et al., 1999).
The widely cited research by Yang et al. reveals
that smoking in China continues to be more
prevalent among men than women, although
the age of smoking initiation has declined by
~3 years for both men and women, from 28 to
25 years of age (Yang et al., 1999). They conclude
that there is an urgent need for smoking
prevention and cessation efforts in China, and
tobacco control initiatives are needed to
maintain or decrease the currently low smoking
prevalence among women. Using descriptive
statistics, Gong et al. studied the prevalence,
characteristics and attitudes surrounding
smoking in the Minhang district of Shanghai
(Gong et al., 1995). Their research showed that
88.4% of respondents believed smoking was
harmful for both the smoker and those exposed
passively to the smoke, but only 14.1% of male
smokers reported a desire to quit smoking. The
researchers believed that the low quit rate and
the low desire to quit were two of the most
serious problems among smokers.

have studied smoking behavior across different

SUMMARY
A number of previous studies have documented the
worsening smoking problems in China. This paper
identifies several key socioeconomic variables associated
with smoking among urban working adults and calls
researchers' attention to the important function of cigarette
smoking as a social connection builder in China. This study
argues that a smoking prevention and education program
should place more emphasis on making smoking socially
unnecessary and/or unacceptable because of the continuing
increase in the number of smokers and the low desire to
quit among smokers. The findings also suggest that while
socioeconomic characteristics are excellent in predicting
whether a person smokes or not, they are dismal in
predicting smoking frequency among working adults.

socioeconomic groups in the Chinese work-
place (Sun and Shun, 1995). Their analysis of
differences in predisposing factors, enabling
factors, reinforcing factors and smoking behav-
ior among white- and blue-collar workers in
Guangzhou suggested that significant differences
exist between these two groups of workers. They
reported that white-collar workers exhibit more
positive predisposing factors towards smoking
and consume more cigarettes than blue-collar
workers.
On the other hand, Hesketh et al. and Li et al.
found a very low prevalence of regular smoking
among Chinese youths from 12 to 19 years of
age (Li et al., 1999; Hesketh et al., 2001). The
strongest factors associated with smoking among
youths were maternal smoking, paternal smok-
ing, smoking peers or friends, low paternal
educational level and a poor self-reported
academic record. One interesting result is that
75% of respondents said that they obtained
cigarettes from home, and only 10% of youths
obtained cigarettes through self-purchase. The
attitudes of these youths were encouraging, with
10% of them thinking that young smokers
have a tough or glamorous image, although
significantly more of the current smokers thought
that smoking improves mood and increases con-
fidence or popularity. In a separate study of
smoking among secondary school students in
Henan, Zhang et al. reported that the likelihood
of tobacco use was significantly higher among
those with peers, teachers or mothers who
smoked (Zhang et al., 2000). They also found that
positive smoking-related attitudes among students
had a significant association with their smoking
status. Again, the authors argued for a compre-
hensive smoking prevention program in the early
teen years so that it can be effective.
Xiang et al. examined cigarette smoking
among medical college students in Wuhan,
China (Xiang et al., 1999). None of the female
respondents reported smoking on a regular
basis. The major reasons for first smoking were
stress, curiosity and loneliness. Multivariate
analysis also revealed that having a family
member who smoked was significantly associated
with cigarette smoking for the students. Xiang
et al. argued that their research suggested a need
to initiate comprehensive tobacco-use pre-
vention programs among medical students
(Xiang et al., 1999).
From a global perspective, Peto et al. predicted
that the sharpest increase in smoking would be in
China and in early middle age (Peto et al., 1996).
About 5% of women and 75% men in China are
occasional or daily smokers, which prompted
Richard et al. to claim that although `Chinese
men number 10% of the adults in the world',
they `smoke about 30% of the world's cigarettes'.
Although a number of researchers have
studied smoking behaviors in China, current
research has several weaknesses: First, the
research mostly concentrates on special segments
of China's population in specific cities, possibly
due to a lack of representative samples of the
whole population. Secondly, some of the research
is only descriptive in nature and does not analyze
the relationship between smoking and other
contributing factors. Thirdly, previous research
tends to jump quickly to the conclusion that a
comprehensive, effective prevention/education
program is needed without providing detailed
strategies. Finally, although the smoking
behavior of youth has drawn some attention
from scholars, the smoking behavior of adults has
not been adequately studied in China. Even
though previous research has identified gender
and occupation as important factors associated
with whether an adult smokes or not, the typical
social and economic characteristics of adult
smokers have not been adequately identified
and explained. This study attempts to identify
the typical socioeconomic characteristics associ-
ated with cigarette smoking and daily smoking
frequency of the urban working population
in China.
METHODS
Data
A nationally representative sample based on
the Household Income Project in 1995 in urban
China was used for this study. The principal
investigators (Khan and Riskin, 2001, Riskin
et al., 2001) claim that the data set is one of the
best available to examine urban China
nationwide. Only a few cases have missing values
for some of the key variables and the missing
values are replaced with the mean of each
variable. It should be noted that the data set is
only representative of the official urban residents
in urban China (Riskin et al., 2001). The so-called
`floating' population, or migrants to the city from
rural areas, were not included in the data
collection.

Dependent variables
Two dependent variables were used for this
study: the first was smoking (the respondent
smokes regularly = 1, no = 0) and the second was
daily smoking frequency (number of cigarettes
smoked per day). Logistic regression was used to
analyze the predictors of whether the
respondents smoke or not, while ordinary least
square regression was used to analyze the
relationships between socioeconomic predictors
and daily smoking frequency.
Independent variables
1. Continuous variables
Continuous variables included in the analyses
were: age of the respondent, years of working
experience, years spent in present job (measure-
ment of work commitment), urban residence
tenure (measuring the number of years since the
respondent obtained official urban residence, or
Hukou), Party membership tenure (a measure of
seniority within the Party), number of persons in
the household (household size), total family
financial assets (the total cash value in Yuan or
RMB of the financial assets owned by each
respondent's family), total family disposable
income in Yuan, and the average income of
the respondent from 1990 to 1994 in Yuan. These
income variables were constructed so that the
effects of individual and family income could be
assessed. This study also considered the estimated
minimum living standard, which was measured by
estimating the amount of money in Yuan that the
household required to maintain a minimum
standard of living. This variable was included in
the model to adjust the regional differences in the
cost of living, which may potentially affect
smoking behavior.
2. Dummy variables
Dichotomous (dummy) variables included in this
study were: female (yes = 1, no = 0); married
(married = 1, no = 0); work unit owned by the
state (yes = 1, no = 0); permanent employee
(permanent employee = 1, no = 0) (permanent
employees enjoyed a number of benefits and
some prestige that others could not obtain in the
previous planned economy); and educated youth
(yes = 1, no = 0). With respect to this variable, a
large number of young students was sent to
country villages to help with agricultural
operations during the Cultural Revolution from
the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s; most of them
came back to the city after the Cultural
Revolution. These people experienced the
dramatic event of the Cultural Revolution during
the Chairman Mao era and this variable was
included to test if these people were more likely
to smoke than others. Other dummy variables
included in this study were: public-financed
health care (health care financed by the state or
government = 1, other = 0) (recent health care
reform has cut health care benefits for many
employees, therefore smoking behavior may
differ along this variable); and work indoors
(yes = 1, no = 0) (a simple measure of work
environment).
3. Scale variables
The first scale variable used in this study was
occupational rank of primary employment.
This scale was a rank of primary employment
according to the Chinese Census Bureau
definition. A score of 9 represented the head of a
business or major government or business
branch, and a score of 1 represented an unskilled
worker. This variable was designed to examine
the relationship between occupational rank and
whether the respondent smoked or not. The
second scale variable was an educational scale
for the respondents. This variable ranged from
1­7, representing the different levels of educa-
tion attained by the respondents (1 = illiterate/
semi-illiterate, 7 = college or better education).
Each scale increase represented ~3 years increase
in education. This approximate measure of
respondent education was used to test if educa-
tion impacted significantly upon the probability
of smoking.
Analysis
As mentioned before, logistic regression was
used to analyze the dichotomized dependent
variable, while linear regression was used to
analyze daily smoking frequency. Since logistic
regression analysis revealed that Communist
Party membership had a powerful positive
influence on whether the respondent smoked or
not, Communist Party members were selected
from the sample and the predictors of smoking
were also analyzed and presented in Table 2. The
Discussion will focus on the Exp(B) coefficients
because these coefficients are much easier to
understand and give an intuitive understanding
Socioeconomic predictors of smoking in China 311
of not only the direction of impacts, but also the
strength of the impacts of the independent
variables. The impact of an independent variable
is positive if the Exp(B) coefficient is 1 and
negative if it is 1.
RESULTS
From Table 1 we can see that only 8% of smokers
were female, 89.1% of smokers were married,
32.9% were Communist Party members, 67%
had public-financed health care and 90% were
permanent employees rather than contracted
workers. In addition, 76% of smokers had
government-assigned jobs, which carry a number
of benefits and some social prestige.
In Table 2, logistic regression for all working
respondents suggested that females were much
less likely to smoke in urban China as indicated
by the extremely small Exp(B) coefficient for the
female variable. The older urban residents
tended to be less likely to smoke, as indicated by
the negative impact of the age variable.
The large Exp(B) coefficient of the marital
status variable suggested that being married
significantly increased the likelihood of smoking
by the respondent, as did Communist Party mem-
bership. Those who were permanent employees,
worked in state-owned enterprises, and had
government-assigned jobs were more likely to be
smokers than others. On the other hand, having
more education, a higher minimum living
standard and an indoor job tended to decrease
the likelihood of smoking by respondents.
Among the Communist Party members,
females and older respondents had a smaller
likelihood of smoking than others. Interestingly,
Communist Party membership tenure, higher
employment rank and urban residence tenure
decreased the probability of smoking among the
Party members, suggesting that the older Party
members with greater seniority, either for health
reasons or others, had a better lifestyle in terms
of smoking. However, working in state-owned
enterprises and having longer work experience
tended to increase the probability of smoking.
Similar to the general working adults, a higher
estimated living standard decreased the
likelihood of smoking among Party members.
The last statistical model examined the
socioeconomic factors associated with daily
smoking frequency among smokers in urban
China. The OLS regression results indicated that
marriage increased the number of cigarettes
smoked by the respondents. Greater education
significantly reduced the number of cigarettes
smoked. Interestingly, although total financial

DISCUSSION
The logistic regression results confirm previous
research that men are much more likely to smoke
than women in China, but the findings also lead
to several other interesting conclusions. First,
smokers are much more likely to belong to some
special segments of the population. The
significant effects of the variables suggest that
smokers are most likely to be male, married,
Communist Party members, permanent emplo-
yees, and workers in state-owned enterprises.
Previous research (Pan, 2004) has suggested that
these socioeconomic characteristics are strongly
associated with various benefits such as house
ownership, better housing location and housing
quality from employer or government in the
planned or transitional economy.
Secondly, the contrast between the high `%
correct' value of logistic regression and the
dismally low adjusted r2 of the OLS regression
model suggests that whether a person smokes or
not is strongly associated with socioeconomic
factors, while the amount smoked is probably
determined by other factors, such as the length of
smoking history, the amount of pressure or stress
in life, the affordability of smoking, etc.
Thirdly, some researchers may be tempted to
conclude from the findings that those with
characteristics associated with various benefits
and prestige in the planned economy and/or
transition economy are more likely than others
to smoke because they can afford to. Or they
smoke because they have better access to
cigarettes since packs of expensive cigarettes are
frequently offered to them as gifts or bribery.
These explanations are certainly valid to some
extent. But the statistically non-significant effects
of total family financial assets, total family
disposable income and average individual

income in the logistic regression models imply
that whether a person smokes or not doesn't
differ significantly along these `money' variables.
This study contends that smoking may be better
attributed to the special social function it serves
in Chinese culture. In China, smoking serves
an important social function: the connection
builder. When people meet each other, it is a
custom for everyone to offer cigarettes to signal
respect and hospitality. Among known friends or
acquaintances, cigarette offering is equally
prevalent and important, and serves the function
of reinforcing friendships or relationships.
For a non-smoker, it is very easy to suffer the
agony and even humiliation of not accepting
someone's polite but pushy offer of a cigarette
because Chinese culture accepts repeated
offerings of cigarettes as a gesture of hospitality.
It is unknown how many Chinese adults choose
not to quit smoking because of the advantage
smoking brings directly or indirectly in their daily
interactions with bosses, friends and potential
connections. This study argues that the people
who are married, Communist Party members,
permanent employees and state-owned enter-
prise employees tend to be more likely to smoke
because they are more heavily influenced by the
traditional culture of building and using
connections than others in the transitional
economy. Connections are much more important
for these people because most of the benefits
they receive, including housing benefits, are
obtained through the influence of their connec-
tions within their work units. Bian explained in
detail how connection (Guanxi) works in the job
allocation process in the planned and transitional
economy in China, and the importance of
connection in daily life since, as Bian argues, the
Chinese live in a web of social relations that
often determine the attainment and allocation of
various resources (Bian, 1994). A byproduct of
the unique culture of using cigarettes as
connection builders is a group of adults that this
study defines as `social smokers': those who only
smoke around their friends or others when
cigarettes are offered because they feel they have
to use smoking as a gesture of maintaining their
friendships so they don't hurt the `feelings' and
damage the delicate `relationships' among their
friends, even though they have decided to quit
smoking on any other occasion due to emerging
smoking-related health problems.
Smoking prevention is a monumental task
facing the Chinese authorities unless they can
make cigarette offerings both socially unnec-
essary and/or unacceptable. Researchers (Gong
et al., 1995; Peto et al., 1996; Mackay, 1997;
Tomlinson, 1997) have called for smoking
prevention programs in China; however, efforts
so far have neither made smoking a social taboo
nor convinced smokers to quit. This study argues
that future smoking prevention in China may use
different strategies for the two groups: on the
one hand, adult smoking prevention/reduction
programs should place a heavy emphasis on
educating the public about the potential harm of
the cigarette offering `custom' and on making it
socially both unnecessary and unacceptable.
Specific efforts should be made to maintain the
very low prevalence of smoking among women.
On the other hand, the smoking prevention/
reduction programs for Chinese youth should
place more emphasis on the bad image of
smokers, since previous research has identified
low rates of smoking among youth, alongside a
low proportion of young people thinking that
smokers have a tough and glamorous image (Li
et al., 1999; Hesketh et al., 2000). By reducing
both initiation at an early age and the necessity
of smoking for adults, future tobacco use in
China may be much lower than it is today.
Implication of this study
It is unknown how many Chinese adults started
smoking because they could not turn down the
repeated offer of cigarettes from friends or
strangers they met. It is also unknown to what
extent the low desire to quit smoking is the result
of the need to remain a regular or `social' smoker
for social reasons. The significance of this study is
that it brings our attention to the importance of
culture and custom in strategy formulation to
prevent smoking in China, where smoking serves
a crucial social function in daily interactions.
Because of the importance of culture in smok-
ing prevention, future research should try to
examine the underlying reasons for smoking
initiation and the low desire to quit among adults
so that coping strategies can be more effective.
As Yang et al. point out, smoking-related
illnesses and deaths will probably only occur in
the coming decades in China (Yang et al., 1999).
Unless effective prevention and reduction
programs are implemented, the sheer size of
China's smoking population will create grave
consequences for the country's health care
system.
