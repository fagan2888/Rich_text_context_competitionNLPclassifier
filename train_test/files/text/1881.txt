There is growing public awareness of risk of
methylmercury exposure associated with fish
consumption (Hightower and Moore 2003;
Knobeloch et al. 2005). Although omega-3
fatty acids in fish have been associated with
healthful benefits, there is increasing evidence
that the methylmercury content in some fish,
if consumed too frequently, can lead to adverse
health effects. The predominant concerns
at this time include cardiovascular disease
(Frustaci et al. 1999; Guallar et al. 2002;
Rissanen et al. 2000; Salonen et al. 1995,
2000; Sørensen et al. 1999; Virtanen et al.
2005), autoimmune disease (Bagenstose et al.
1999; Bernier et al. 1995; Bigazzi 1994;
Nielsen and Hultman 2002; Silva et al. 2004;
Stejskal and Stejskal 1999; Stejskal et al. 1999;
Via et al. 2003), infertility (Choy et al. 2002;
Dickman and Leung 1998; Leung et al. 2001;
Sheiner et al. 2003), neuropsychiatric effects
(Beuter and Edwards 2004; Yokoo et al.
2003), and subjective complaints (Fukuda
et al. 1999). Furthermore, many of these
adverse health effects may occur at mercury
levels previously thought to be safe.
The fetus has been the greatest concern
because permanent damage to the developing
brain can occur with methylmercury expo-
sure. The U.S. Environment Protection
Agency's reference dose for mercury was based
on a cord blood concentration of 5.8 µg/L
and corresponds to a maternal intake of 0.1 µg
Hg/kg body weight/day. However, it has been
argued that this concentration should be low-
ered to 3.5 µg/L, based on more recent obser-
vations showing that cord blood mercury
concentrations are approximately 70% higher
than maternal concentrations (Stern and
Smith 2003). It is of importance to note that
mercury concentration across the placenta was
not considered when the reference dose was
established (Mahaffey 2005; Rice 2004; Rice
et al. 2003).
Fish consumption accounts for most of the
daily intake of mercury compounds in the
United States, with lesser contributions from
elemental mercury from mercury vapor in den-
tal amalgams. Urine mercury is a reflection of
inorganic or elemental exposure, as occurs with
dental amalgams, magical uses of elemental
mercury, and herbs and medicines adulterated
with inorganic mercury. Only small amounts
of methylmercury, which is consumed primar-
ily through fish consumption, is metabolized
to inorganic mercury and excreted in the urine
(Dye et al. 2005).
There is also growing recognition within
the medical community of the clinical impor-
tance of methylmercury exposure and of the
connection between blood mercury levels and
consumption of fish and shellfish products that
are high in mercury. The American Medical
Association (AMA) has advocated that physi-
cians "assist in educating patients about the
relative mercury content of fish and shellfish
products and make patients aware of the
advice contained in both national and regional
consumer fish consumption advisories" (AMA
2004).
Since 1999, the National Health and
Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES)
has reported total whole-blood mercury levels
in children 1­5 years of age and in women
16­49 years of age. Recent reports based on
NHANES data for 1999­2002 have examined
blood mercury levels among the major
racial/ethnic groups but have not examined
blood mercury levels among those classified
as "other" racial/ethnic group. The "other"
group is of interest because it includes people
at potentially high risk for methylmercury
exposure through fish consumption, such as
Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans
(including Alaskan Natives) [Centers for
Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) 2004,
2005; National Center for Health Statistics
2005; Sechena et al. 2003].

INTRODUCTION: Asians, Pacific Islanders, and Native Americans are a potentially high-risk group
for dietary exposure to methylmercury through fish consumption. However, blood mercury levels
in this group have not been identified in recent reports of the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey (NHANES) for the years 1999­2002.
METHODS: We used NHANES data from 1999­2002 to obtain population estimates of blood mer-
cury levels among women of childbearing age classified as belonging to the "other" racial/ethnic
group (Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, and multiracial; n = 140). Blood mercury levels in
this group were compared with those among all other women participants, classified as Mexican
American, non-Hispanic black, non-Hispanic white, and "other" Hispanic.
RESULTS: An estimated 16.59 ± 4.0% (mean ± SE) of adult female participants who self-identified as
Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, or multiracial (n = 140) had blood mercury levels  5.8 µg/L,
and 27.26 ± 4.22% had levels  3.5 µg/L. Among remaining survey participants (n = 3,497), 5.08 ±
0.90% had blood mercury levels  5.8 µg/L, and 10.86 ± 1.45% had levels  3.5 µg/L.
CONCLUSIONS: Study subjects in NHANES who self-identified as Asian, Pacific Islander, Native
American, or multiracial had a higher prevalence of elevated blood mercury than all other
racial/ethnic participants in the survey. Future studies should address reasons for the high mercury
levels in this group and explore possible interventions for lowering risk of methylmercury exposure
in this population.

tiracial, or a race/ethnicity other than black,
non-Hispanic white, Mexican American, or
Hispanic) with those in all other racial/ethnic
groups (CDC 2005; National Center for
Health Statistics 2005).
Study sample. All women 16­49 years of
age who were selected for both the interview
and examination portions of NHANES and
underwent whole-blood mercury testing were
eligible for inclusion (n = 3,873). Among
these, 236 participants had missing blood
mercury results and were thus excluded from
the analytic sample (n = 3,637). Among the
women included in the analysis, 1,377 self-
identified as non-Hispanic white, 1,106 as
Mexican American, 794 as non-Hispanic
black, and 220 as other Hispanic, and 140
were categorized as "other."
Statistical analysis. We obtained popula-
tion prevalence estimates for blood mercury
levels  5.8 µg/L and  3.5 µg/L, respectively,
using appropriate sample weights (Stata statis-
tical software for complex survey design;
StataCorp., College Station, TX) (CDC 2005;
National Center for Health Statistics 2005).
We compared the estimated prevalence of ele-
vated blood mercury levels among participants
in the "other" racial/ethnic group with those
among Mexican Americans, non-Hispanic
whites, and non-Hispanic blacks.
To determine whether observed differences
in whole-blood mercury levels were most likely
to reflect differences in dietary fish consump-
tion rather than exposure to elemental or inor-
ganic mercury, we examined self-reported fish
consumption (number of fish and shellfish
meals in the preceding 30 days) among female
NHANES participants 16­49 years of age (n =
3,481) by racial/ethnic group. We also exam-
ined mean urine mercury-to-creatinine ratios
(micrograms per gram) across racial/ethnic
groups (n = 3,551). These analyses were also
conducted using sample weights.
Results
An estimated 16.59 ± 4.0% [mean ± SE; 95%
confidence interval (CI), 8.41­24.77] of adult
female participants who self-identified as
Asian, Pacific Islander, Native American, or
multiracial (n = 140) had blood mercury levels
 5.8 µg/L, and an estimated 27.26 ± 4.22%
(95% CI, 18.63­35.90) had levels  3.5 µg/L.
In accordance with the NHANES analytical
guidelines, these prevalence estimates are sta-
tistically reliable, because the relative SEs did
not exceed 30% of the point estimates. The
prevalence of elevated blood mercury levels in
the "other" group is significantly higher than
in all other racial/ethnic groups (Table 1).
Among the remaining participants (n =
3,497), an estimated 5.08 ± 0.90% (95% CI,
3.25­6.92) had blood levels  5.8 µg/L, and
an estimated 10.86 ± 1.45% (95% CI,
7.90­13.83) had mercury levels  3.5 µg/L.
The mean number of fish and shellfish
meals for the "other" racial/ethnic group was
higher than for the remaining groups, although
the 95% CIs overlapped with all except
Mexican Americans. Fish and shellfish con-
sumption among Mexican Americans is lower
than among the "other" population. There
were no statistically significant differences
between groups in urine mercury:creatinine
ratios (Table 2).
Discussion
In the United States, 4.1 million people iden-
tified themselves as Alaskan Native or Native
American alone or in combination with one
or more races in Census 2000; 12.5 million
people identified as Asian or Pacific Islander,
with 51% residing in the West, 19% in the
South, 12% in the Midwest, and 19% in the
Northeast. Asians, Pacific Islanders, Alaskan
Natives, and Native Americans accounted for
approximately 6.0% of live births in 2001, or
approximately 242,151 babies born (U.S.
Census Bureau 2002a, 2002b; Ventura et al.
2003).
The prevalence of elevated blood mercury,
whether this was defined as  5.8 µg/L or  3.5
µg/L, was significantly higher among members
of the "other" racial/ethnic group than among
any other racial/ethnic group and primarily
reflected differences in organic mercury expo-
sure, most likely due to fish consumption.
Although reports based on the most
recent NHANES data from 2001­2002 have
not reported mercury levels for this group
(CDC 2004), NHANES data for the years
1999­2000 showed a non-statistically signifi-
cant trend toward higher mercury levels in
the "other" ethnic group (Mahaffey et al.
2004). Estimates presented here based on
four years of NHANES data, 1999­2002,
demonstrate that levels of mercury in this
group are statistically significantly higher than
for all other groups considered.
Our findings are consistent with those of
smaller studies that showed a correlation of
methylmercury through fish consumption
within the racial/ethnic groups that comprise
the "other" population of NHANES partici-
pants. The groups identified in these studies
were Native peoples of the United States and
Canada (Beuter and Edwards 2004; Bjerregaard
and Hansen 2000; Clarkson 1976; Girard et al.
1996; Harnly et al. 1997; McKeown-Eyssen
et al. 1983; Mergler et al. 1998; Muckle et al.
2001; Weihe et al. 2002) and residents of
Hong Kong and China (Choy et al. 2002;
Dickman and Leung 1998; Leung et al. 2001),
Japan (Fukuda et al. 1999), and American
Samoa (Marsh et al. 1974). In fact, a recent
random-digit-dial fish consumption survey
(with subsequent hair mercury levels in women
18­45 years of age from 12 states in the
continental United States) found that Asians
had methylmercury exposures greater than
the reference dose 83% of the time, compared
with 12% for the total survey population
(Knobeloch et al. 2005).
Although NHANES was not designed
to identify small subgroups at risk, it is

and important trends be identified. Such iden-
tification will help health care clinicians apply
recommendations from the scientific literature
to the patients they see in their communities,
where appropriate.
Conclusion
Study subjects in NHANES who self-identi-
fied as Asian, Pacific Islander, Native
American, or multiracial had a higher preva-
lence of elevated blood mercury than all other
racial/ethnic participants in the survey. It is
important that both patients and clinicians be
aware that members of this group are at
increased risk for methylmercury exposure.
Future studies should address reasons for the
high mercury levels in this group and explore
possible interventions for lowering risk of
methylmercury exposure in this population.
