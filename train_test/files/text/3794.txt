Introduction
There is increasing awareness that teachers must be carefully
recruited and developed professionally throughout the course
of their careers to be effective (Billingsley, 2004; Burns &
Lawrie, 2015). Developing an effective means of supporting
and retaining teachers is crucial to creating a quality learning
environment for students and a supportive work environment
for teachers (Evers, Van der Heijden, & Kreijns, 2016; Polly
et al., 2015). Professional development is necessary to fill in
the gaps in the skill sets of new teachers, and to continue to
develop the expertise of teachers (Evers et al., 2016).
Professional development is necessary to keep the teacher
up-to-date with the continuously changing practices, and stu-
dent needs.
Success requires teachers to be active learners and be a
coherent part of other well-planned professional development
activities. To improve teaching in the classroom, professional
development must be collaborative, long term, and content
driven (Guskey & Yoon, 2009). Research also stresses that to
be successful, teachers need professional development that is
a sustained, intensive effort to improve teaching and learning
(Richardson, 2003). Researchers have identified professional
development program design elements thought to maximize
teacher learning, including a strong content focus, inquiry-
oriented learning approaches, collaborative participation, and
coherence with school curricula and policies (Garet, Porter,
Desimone, Birman, & Yoon, 2001; Garet et al., 2008;
Santagata, Kersting, Givvin, & Stigler, 2011).
The Organization for Economic Co-Operation and
Development's (OECD) "Teaching and Learning International
Survey (TALIS; 2013)" is a large-scale survey involving 34
countries (TALIS, 2013). The survey focuses on dimensions
related to the working conditions of teachers, the learning envi-
ronment in schools, and the various efforts of school leadership
(TALIS, 2013). A major part of TALIS is related to the profes-
sional development of teachers. The survey reflects teachers'
experiences with regard to professional development. The
experiences cover most activities related to advancing teachers'

Development Needs, Impacts, and
Barriers: The Abu Dhabi Case

Abstract
The article reports on findings from the TALIS (Teaching and Learning International Survey) 2013 study for Abu Dhabi which
gathered teachers' views on teaching and learning with a focus on professional development. The aim of this study is to better
understand teachers' perceptions of professional development needs and impacts as well as the barriers faced by teachers
from secondary schools in Abu Dhabi. The study provides some insights into the variations of those perceptions relative to
other independent variables such as teachers' age and gender, and type of schools. With regard to the perceived need for
professional development activities, the most significant variation is observed with regard to public or private schools. With
regard to the impact of those activities, male teachers almost consistently assign higher perceived impact scores than female
teachers. Public schools also assign higher perceived impact scores for all activities that they participated in. However, female
teachers assign significantly higher perceived barrier scores to five of the seven listed barriers to participating in professional
development activities. The research has implications for professional development providers to ensure the effectiveness of
professional development opportunities for educators in Abu Dhabi.

skills and knowledge. TALIS focuses of the different types of
professional development opportunities teachers receive which
includes induction and mentoring programs. It examines a
range of variables or constructs. The variables are related to
teachers and schools. The variables are thought to influence the
type and amount of professional development that a teacher
undertakes. The survey also covers professional development
needs, and perceived impacts. Teachers are also given the
chance to identify the barriers that prevent them from attaining
their desired professional development.
Abu Dhabi participated in two TALIS 2013 options: lower
secondary education (International Standard Classification
of Education [ISCED] 1) and upper secondary education
(ISCED 2). The Abu Dhabi Education Council (ADEC) is in
charge of the school system across the Emirate ofAbu Dhabi.
ADEC has stressed how critical it is for teachers to have
ongoing and regular opportunities to participate in profes-
sional development programs. Abu Dhabi education system
is unique compared with most countries. This would explain
some of the results we might obtain in this study. The current
research may be considered a case study based on in-depth
investigation of Abu Dhabi school practices with regard to
teacher's professional development. The objective is to pro-
vide a detailed description of the institutional setting within
which teacher professional development take place to
improve our understanding of the context in which the vari-
ous relationships may be interpreted. The study examines the
variation of professional development in Abu Dhabi schools.
The objective of this study is to better understand teachers'
perception of professional development needs, barriers,
impact, and durations. The study also identifies the effects of
characteristics of teachers (gender and years of experience)
and schools (public, private, or vocational) on teachers' per-
ceptions of professional development. The significance of
the study outlines how this investigation improves school
practices. It seeks to understand the teachers' experience as
they participate in professional development. The current
study is also inspired by many writings that stress the signifi-
cance of teachers' continuous professional development in
improving educational performance and effectiveness
(Girvan, Conneely, & Tangney, 2016). This study may
inspire many ADEC policy makers who support the rele-
vance of career-long opportunities for professional
development.
Review of Literature
Professional development should provide an important tactic
for improving schools, increasing teacher quality, and
improving student learning (Girvan et al., 2016; Opfer,
Pedder, & Lavicza, 2011; Witte & Jansen, 2016). The
National Staff Development Council (NSDC; 2001) stresses
that professional development is rapidly being viewed as
high-quality ongoing training programs with intensive fol-
low-up and on-the-job support. Hill, Beisiegel, and Jacob
(2013) provided evidence based results to show that profes-
sional development is significantly linked to student achieve-
ment. These findings and similar reported evidences point at
the impact of developing teachers' competencies (Meissel,
Parr, & Timperley, 2016). Quality professional development
can lead to important qualitative outcomes such as the cre-
ation of a positive school culture, citizenship, improvement
in individual teacher skills, and development of opportuni-
ties for peer learning (Willemse, Dam, Geijsel, van Wessum,
& Volman, 2015).
Needs for Professional Development Activities
Teachers learn best through professional development that
addresses their needs (Meissel et al., 2016). The theoretical
framework of adult learning theory shares the need for ongo-
ing quality professional development, which requires teach-
ers to become lifelong adult learners (Eleonora, 2003;
Hiebert, Gallimore, & Stigler, 2002). Professional develop-
ment needs include many different activities. Some activities
focus on students with special needs and managing the class-
room. Other activities involve designing curriculum and unit
planning (Garet et al., 2001; Pehmer, Groschner, & Seidel,
2015). From the school administrative side, some suggested
managing budgets and purchasing (Sair & Memiolu,
2013). Evers et al. (2016) cited activities dealing with teach-
ing strategy support, information on where to search for
needed resources, classroom management, and parental
involvement. Daresh (2003) also cited activities necessary
for beginner teachers to include how to plan classes, manage
student behavior, and work within district rules). He also
mentioned personal concerns and teaching concerns. In a
survey of new teachers, Yohon (2005) identified assessment
tools, student motivation, curriculum development, lesson
planning, and standards documentation. The recognition and
respect for the leadership abilities of teachers and all mem-
bers of the school community is essential (Witte & Jansen,
2016). Teachers need to be empowered to further develop
expertise in subject matter content, technologies, and other
essential elements that lead to high standards or quality
teaching (Korkko, Kyro-Ammala, & Turunen, 2016; Witte &
Jansen, 2016). The NSDC (2007) created a set of nine stan-
dards that all professional development should follow. They
include content knowledge and quality teaching, research-
basis, collaboration, diverse learning needs, student learning
environments, family involvement, evaluation, data-driven
design, and teacher learning.
Impact of Professional Development Activities
Developers and policy makers call for more rigorous evi-
dence that describes how professional development design
elements affect the likelihood of program success (Witte &
Jansen, 2016). Poskitt (2005) stressed that participations in
professional development have some impact on the teachers'
Badri et al. 3
ability to acquire and develop knowledge and skills. Gabriel,
Day, and Allington (2011) noted the importance of emotional
intelligence skills essential to good thinking, planning, and
dealing with students and colleagues. Desimone (2009) note
the importance of the positive impact of professional devel-
opment on the teachers' ability to decide on and implement
valued changes in teaching. Bolam (2002) stresses the impact
of professional development on leadership behavior so that
teachers could educate their students more effectively, thus
achieving a desirable balance between individual, school and
national need.
Research shows that some professional developments do
not meet the threshold needed to produce strong effects on
their practice or on student learning (Darling-Hammond &
Bransford, 2005; OECD, 2008; Wei, Darling-Hammond, &
Adamson, 2010). E. Powell, Terrell, Furey, and Scott-Evans
(2003) noted that professional development has both imme-
diate and long-term impacts. They add that the ability to
reflect gives teachers better skills to better evaluate the effec-
tiveness of their practice. Harris, Cale, and Musson (2011)
reported that professional development helped teachers to
experience immediate positive impact on their perceptions of
physical education. Some studies noted that the long-term
impact of professional development has to do with develop-
ing greater confidence with their practice (Buczynski &
Hansen, 2010; Harris et al., 2011; Harris & Sass, 2011).
Forms of Professional Development Programs
Structural features that affect teacher learning include the
form of the professional developmental activity, collective
participation, and the duration of the activity (Haslam &
Seremet, 2001).
For many teachers, professional development has been
viewed as a task that generally involves a 1-day in-service
training or workshop, with little or no expectation of what the
teacher should do with the information or how the teacher
should share the information with other colleagues (Garet
et al., 2001; Guskey & Yoon, 2009). Birman, Desimone,
Porter, and Garet (2000) argued that compared with activities
of shorter duration, the activities of longer duration have more
subject-area content focus, more opportunities for active
learning, and more coherence with teachers' other experi-
ences. This is further reinforced by Garet et al. (2001) asser-
tion that longer professional development activities are more
likely to provide opportunities for in-depth discussion of the
content, pedagogy, and student conceptions/misconceptions.
The authors also suggest that activities that extend over time
are more likely to allow teachers more time to try out new
practices in the classroom and obtain feedback on their teach-
ing (Girvan et al., 2016; Sedova, Sedlacek, & Svaricek, 2016).
With regard to forms of professional development, TALIS
(2013) included in its survey nine different choices: courses/
workshops, education conferences or seminars, qualification
program, observation visits to other schools, participation in
a network of teachers, individual or collaborative research on
a topic, and mentoring and/or peer observation and coaching.
These and other forms are also discussed in other studies
(i.e., Birman et al., 2000; Erickson, Noonan, Brussow, &
Carter, 2016).
Collective participation refers to the interest of groups of
teachers from the same school, department, or class (or grade
level) in professional development (Garet et al., 2001). With
collective participation, the professional development pro-
grams are designed to help contribute to a shared culture of
all participants. As a result, teachers from the same school,
grade level, or subject develop a common understanding.
Common themes might include instructional goals, methods,
problems, and solutions (Diaz Maggioli, 2012).
Barriers and Support for Participating in
Professional Development Programs
Studies show that many challenges exist with regard to the
effective implementation of professional development. The
forms of support can consist of paid working time and substi-
tutions (often discouraged for budget and organizational rea-
sons), funding costs sustained by teachers, salary incentives,
being a condition for salary progression and promotion,
national policies and campaigns (such as the one in Sweden;
OECD, 2005). The availability of collaboration, time, long-
term commitment, and resources are important for the suc-
cessful implementation of professional development (Maria
& García, 2016). Many believe that the level of intensity of
participation in professional development activities are par-
tially a function of the sort of backing that teachers get to
participate in them or the type of barriers they encounter
(Avalos, 2011; Jurasaite-Harbison & Rex, 2010; Mahmoudia,
& Özkana, 2015). North Central Regional Educational
Laboratory (NCREL) cited the need for the educational com-
munity to move away from prior professional development
models that occur only on teacher workdays, after school or
on weekends. The reallocation of resources--especially
time--was stressed. Furthermore, the restructuring of the
teacher's work to create "mental space" was highly recom-
mended (Drage, 2010). Other cited barriers to their fulfill-
ment include time, accessibility, staff motivation, marketing
and advertising, and financial issues (Geldenhuys &
Oosthuizen, 2015). Age, staff shortages, unsupportive man-
agers, staff attitude, availability of programs, work pressure,
family commitments, unsafe environments, and participation
on own time are also identified as barriers (Drage, 2010;
Fernandez-Manzanal et al., 2015).
Factors Affecting Variations in Professional
Development Perceptions
In TALIS 2008, one could analyze the disparity in the take-up
of professional development within countries by examining
participation with respect to teachers and schools
4 SAGE Open
characteristics. The teacher and school characteristics chosen
reflected the interest of policy makers in each country. With
regard to the duration of professional development activities,
on average, there was no statistically significant difference
between male and female teachers across participating coun-
tries. On average, younger teachers received more profes-
sional development. This indicates that, on average,
more-experienced teachers receive less days of professional
development than less-experienced teachers. On average,
teachers from private schools had 1 day less professional
development than their public school counterparts. However,
the difference is not statistically significant. A study by
Amanulla and Aruna (2014) revealed that there are significant
differences between male and female teachers, government
and private schoolteachers, and more-experienced and less-
experienced teachers in the mean scores of items related to
professional development.Alade and Odebode (2014) showed
that age, gender, educational qualification, and years of teach-
ing experience had no significant influence on the benefits
derived by teachers' from the Professional Development
Program. Sair (2014) showed mixed results of for the differ-
ence between male and female teachers regarding certain pro-
fessionaldevelopmentneeds.Basedonseniority,nosignificant
differences were observed in teacher views regarding their
professional development needs in most categories.
Independent Variables of Teacher's Age, Gender,
and Type of Schools
In general, TALIS results showed that on average across par-
ticipating countries, there is no statistically significant differ-
ence between male and female teachers with regard to days
of participation (TALIS, 2013). A study by (Hustler,
McNamara, Jarvis, Londra, & Campbell, 2003) showed that
male teachers were slightly less likely to have a positive atti-
tude toward professional development than their female
counterparts although the difference was minimal.
International literature identifies teacher's age as a deter-
minant of professional development take-up (Desimone,
Smith, & Ueno, 2006; Richter, Kunter, Klusmann, Lüdtke, &
Baumert, 2011). TALIS (2013) study showed that the on
average, the amount of professional development that teach-
ers received decreased with the age of the teacher. This indi-
cates that on average less-experienced teachers receive more
days of professional development than more-experienced
teachers.
The TALIS (2013) results showed that on average
teachers in public schools had 1 day more professional
development than their private school counterparts, a dif-
ference that is not statistically significant. A study by the
U.S. Department of Education (1997) concluded that pub-
lic schoolteachers were more likely to participate in pro-
fessional development activities. Their study showed that
public schoolteachers were more likely to participate in
professional development.
The TALIS Study
In general, the TALIS survey, fairly represented the impor-
tant features of teachers'professional development addressed
by research. The survey addressed many variables. The vari-
ables include rate of participation, professional development
activities and topics (including subject matters), and the
experienced impact of professional development activities. It
also included some others skills that are addressed by the
school's human resource development requirements and
continuous teachers' professional development. The survey
also covered preferred teaching strategies, and experienced
needs, and barriers to participation in professional develop-
ment. Other variables covered the relevant characteristics of
the school. The survey also required teachers to provide
some descriptive background characteristics (i.e., age, gen-
der, and experience). Teachers were also asked to portray
their attitudes and beliefs with regard to professional devel-
opment activities.
The conceptual framework developed by TALIS related to
teachers' professional development hypothesized some associ-
ations between the form and content of professional develop-
ment, with characteristics of teachers, schools, and the national
education context (TALIS, 2013). It focused on continuous
professional development in schools, which has a particular
impact on co-operation within school teams, peer review, and
human resources development. TALIS also asked teachers to
declare the average number of teachers' days during the past
year. To identify best practices in professional development,
researchers then compare variability in program content with
variability in these outcomes (Meissel et al., 2016).
Method
Study Instrument and Distribution
The TALIS survey asked teachers about their participation in
professional development activities during the 12 months
before the survey. The survey was designed in an orderly
fashion. It included dimensions (and items or variables) cov-
ering the support teachers received for undertaking these pro-
fessional development activities, their impact or effect, the
areas of their schoolwork that they found most in need of fur-
ther training and development, and the barriers they felt had
paused some challenges to prevent them from undertaking
additional development activities. Teachers were provided
with 14 specific topics to identify which they have partici-
pated in. The topics included, approaches to individual learn-
ing, student evaluation and assessment practices, pedagogical
competencies in teaching the subject field, and teaching stu-
dents with special needs. For each of the 14 topics, they were
asked to assign the appropriate impact on teaching score.
The TALIS survey also asked teachers about the form of
support they got for their participation in the various profes-
sional development activities. The type of option supports
included scheduling of activities, providing salary supplement,
Badri et al. 5
and other non-monetary support (i.e., decreased teaching time,
study leave, days off, etc.). To better understand participation in
professional development and provide insight into potential
policy implications, TALIS asked teachers to indicate barriers
to their participation.
Abu Dhabi participated in TALIS 2013. The survey was
available online in both Arabic and English. The Arabic ver-
sion of the survey was developed by ADEC with validation
and feedback as well as final approval from the OECD. A
letter from the Director General of ADEC and the OECD
went to the selected schools requesting their participation.
Study Sample
The sample of schools and teachers were identified randomly
by the OECD team. In each participating country, a mini-
mum representative sample of at least 20 teachers from each
of 200 schools was randomly selected. The international tar-
get population for TALIS included lower secondary teachers
and their school leaders in both public and private schools.
For Abu Dhabi, teachers from both lower and upper sec-
ondary schools were included. Both public and private
schoolteachers were asked to participate. Two types of public
schools were involved: regular public schools and vocational
public schools. A total of 4,941 teachers participated. A total
of 2,703 teachers were female (55.1%) and 2,202 teachers
were male (44.9%). This sample shows that a smaller pro-
portion of teachers were female than in most other TALIS
countries (compared with 68.1% in OECD countries). The
mean age of teachers was 39.65 years, with a median of 39.0
years, and a mode of 40 years. Teachers from Abu Dhabi
were on average younger than those in most other TALIS
countries (relative to 42.9 years in OECD countries). On
average, teachers from Abu Dhabi had spent fewer years
teaching than those in most other TALIS countries (12.8
years relative to 16.2 years). A smaller proportion of teachers
had completed a teacher education or training program than
in most other TALIS countries (83.3% relative to 89.8%).
Teachers from both private and public schools were
selected by the OECD to participate in TALIS. Around 2,352
teachers from public schools and 2,553 teachers from private
schools participated in the study. From the Abu Dhabi public
schools, 152 teachers came from the technical or vocational
schools. With regard to teachers' age, among the teachers
who declared their age, 91 were 25 years or younger, 375
were aged 26 to 29 years, 1,784 were aged 30 to 39 years,
1,324 were aged 40 to 49 years, and 608 teachers were 50
years or older.
Research Questions and Analysis
In general, the TALIS study is complex survey sample
data. The international TALIS (2013) documentation pro-
vides guidance on the appropriate analysis and estimation
procedures. TALIS uses sampling weights with a complex
multi-stage cluster sample. Such sampling method requires
appropriate software and analysis. The analysis incorpo-
rates the replication weights to obtain appropriate variance
estimates.
This research was done to express the professional
development programs for teachers from Abu Dhabi using
the TALIS data. It is important to learn different approaches
in different countries to get benefit from the good exam-
ples. In the field of education, Abu Dhabi has not received
enough international attention. Results of this study would
provide more insights in the professional development of
teachers in an era of education reform in Abu Dhabi. This
study seeks to answer the following questions:
Research Question 1: What are the teachers' perceptions
of the most needed professional development activities?
Research Question 2: What are the forms of professional
activities that produced the highest impact on teachers'
knowledge for teaching?
Research Question 3: What are the main activities of
professional development that teachers participated in?
Research Question 4: What are the teachers' perceived
barriers to their participation in professional
development?
Research Question 5: How the various teacher percep-
tions about professional development need and impact are
effected by teacher features (gender, age, and
experience)?
Research Question 6: How the various teacher percep-
tions about professional development need and impact are
effected by school features (public/private) and (general/
vocational)?
Predominantly, descriptive statistics will be used to explain
the outcomes with regard to the study items. In addition, analy-
sis of variance will be used to identify differences with regard to
teachers'gender and age, type of school (public or private), and
type of public school (regular or vocational).
With regard to age of teachers (five categories),
MANOVA will be conducted across the variables of
interest. MANOVA is used to determine whether there
are any differences between independent groups on more
than one continuous dependent variable. It should be
added that MANOVA can detect differences too small to
be detected through individual ANOVAs. MANOVA can
also capture multivariate patterns if present (see Huberty
& Olejnik, 2006).
As a final initiative, a teacher's focus group will be
formed. The ADEC Cluster Managers will be asked to pro-
vide names of some distinguished teachers. Several teachers
will be invited from the various schools in Abu Dhabi. The
teachers will be asked to elaborate on the results of this study.
Their feedback will be integrated with the recommendations
of this research and its implications for ADEC or school
policy makers.

Results
Professional Development Needs
In Abu Dhabi, in both public and private schools, teachers
are not explicitly obliged to engage in professional develop-
ment activities. TALIS asked teachers to provide their per-
ception of the type of professional developments needed.
The survey included 14 topics or activities as shown in
Table 1. Teachers were asked to rate their development need
in various aspects of their work. A 4-point scale from "low
level of need" to "high level of need" was used. The aspect
of teachers' work that was, on average, most frequently
rated by teachers as an area of high development need in
Abu Dhabi was "new technologies in workplaces" and
"teaching students with special needs." Other aspects of
teachers' work in which, on average, sizable proportions of
teachers reported having a high level of development need
were "approaches to develop cross-occupational competen-
cies for future work/studies" and "information and commu-
nication technology (ICT) skills for teaching." In contrast,
the aspects of teachers' work that, on average, received low-
est scores were "knowledge and understanding of my sub-
ject field(s)" and "knowledge of the curriculum."
Professional Development Activities' Impacts
TALIS asked teachers to report on the impact of their profes-
sional development activities on their own development as
teachers. The survey first asked teachers whether they have
participated in any of the previously mentioned 14 professional
need activities. For those teachers who provided a "yes" reply,
the survey further asked them to identify the impact of partici-
pating in those activities on teaching and learning. Teachers
were asked to rate their perception on a 4-point scale from low
level of impact to high level of impact. Because TALIS reports
teachers' self-perceptions, the results should be treated with
some caution, especially if teachers' perception of impact is to
reflect the effectiveness of the professional development activi-
ties they participated in. Nevertheless, we could presume that if
teachers feel that a certain professional developmental activity
has had limited impact, this is likely to affect their decisions
regarding future participation in that activity.
Results from Table 2 show that the three highest profes-
sional development activities that teachers participated in are
related to "student evaluation and assessment practices"
(84.5%), "pedagogical competencies in teaching own subject"
(79.9%), and "student behavior and classroom management"
(78.1%). Table 2 also shows the mean scores of the general
perceived impact of the activities teachers participated in on
teaching. The teacher's consistent positive view of the impact
of all types of professional development activities is noticeable
(all values above 3.0). On average, in Abu Dhabi, teachers
reported that the highest impact was related to "knowledge of
the curriculum," and "knowledge and understanding of my
subject field(s)." It should be noted that those two activities
received the lowest perception need scores as shown in Table 1.
Perceived Barriers to Their Participation in
Professional Development
TALIS asked teachers about the barriers to take more profes-
sional development. It asked teachers to indicate the reasons
Badri et al. 7
that had prevented them from enrolling in more activities.
Such information is thought to provide more information for
better policy making with regard to professional develop-
ment with regard to its make-up. They were given seven
options to choose from. Table 3 provides the responses given
by Abu Dhabi teachers. Results show that in general, the two
factors related to "too expensive/unaffordable," "lack of
incentives," and "professional development conflicting with
work schedule" received the highest scores.
Abu Dhabi also reports that "conflict with work schedule"
was most frequently reported as a barrier (42% of teachers).
The conflict with work schedule would find the timing of
certain professional development activities to be not appro-
priate. Family, responsibilities were reported as a barrier by
23.8% of teachers on average. Almost the same percentage
of those who did not participate at all in professional devel-
opment reported this as a barrier. In Abu Dhabi, teachers
have the option of enrolling in various professional develop-
ment activities for free, and during regular working hours.
As further inquiries, TALIS asked teachers about the type
of support received for participating in professional devel-
opment. Approximately 54.9% of Abu Dhabi teachers
recorded that they participated in certain professional devel-
opment activities during regular working hours.
Approximately 81.2% of teachers noted that they did not
receive a salary supplement for activities outside working
hours. In addition, only 12.9% of teachers noted that they
received non-monetary support for participating in certain
professional activities outside working hours.
Type of Professional Development and Durations
With regard to impact of professional developments types, it
is assumed that teacher responses are direct or indirect reflec-
tions of the general experience. Table 4 shows nine types of
professional development activities that teachers were asked
to state whether they have participated in, during the current
year. The four types that received the highest percent partici-
pation were courses and workshops (83.6%), mentoring and
coaching (63.0%), education conferences or seminars
(51.6%), and individual or collaborative research (50.8%).
The two types that received the lowest participation scores
were qualification program (16.6%) and observation visits to
other schools (29.9%). The table also shows that courses and
workshops (11.66 days) had the highest mean for the dura-
tion of the professional development type.
Teacher Gender Differences
Analysis of variance was performed to see whether there are
significant differences between female and male teachers
with regard to their perceived needs for professional develop-
ment. Results in Table 1 show that there are no significant
differences (.05) except with regard to three professional

development activities. Female teachers perceived more need
for ICT skills for teaching (F = 3.764, p  .049), whereas male
teachers perceived more need for school management and
administration (F = 26.937, p  .001) and more teaching in a
multicultural or multilingual setting (F = 25.988, p  .001).
Analysis of variance results of the effect of gender on
professional development impact revealed some signifi-
cant differences between female and male teachers. As
Table 2 shows, significant differences were observed
between male and female teachers with regard to the per-
ceived impact on teaching and learning of nine of those
activities. Three activities were related to the subject and
curriculum: knowledge and understanding of my subject
field(s), pedagogical competencies in teaching my subject
fields(s), and knowledge of the curriculum. One activity
was related to ICT skills. The other activities were related
to student evaluation and assessment practices, approaches
to individualized learning, teaching students with special
needs, developing cross-occupational competencies, and
new technologies in workplaces.
Results in Table 3 show that significant differences exist
between male and female teachers with regard to certain bar-
riers related to professional development. For both male and
female teachers, the highest score was assigned to the barrier
related to "there are no incentives for participation." Male
teachers assign significantly higher barrier scores to the fol-
lowing five barriers: lack of employer support, conflict with
work schedule, not having time because of work schedule,
family responsibilities, and lack of relevant provisional
development offered.

Differences Between Public and Private
Schoolteachers
With regard to perception of needs for professional activities,
Table 1 shows that significant differences exist between
teachers from public and private schools for 11 out of 14
activities. The activities that do not show significant differ-
ences are related to school management and administration,
teaching cross-curricular skills (e.g., problem solving and
learning to learn), and approaches to develop cross-occupa-
tional competencies for future work or future studies. Private
schoolteachers show greater needs for almost all activities
except for the activity related to teaching students with spe-
cial needs; for this, public schoolteachers showed lower per-
ceived needs.
Analysis of variance shows that teachers from public and
private schools show significantly different perceptions of
the impact of professional development activities (Table 2).
Significant differences are recorded with regard to three out
of the 14 activities. No significant differences were recorded
with respect to activities related to student behavior and
classroom management, school management and administra-
tion, and teaching in a multicultural or multilingual setting. It
is interesting to note that teachers from public schools con-
sistently assign higher impact scores with regard to all pro-
fessional development activities they have taken.
Table 3 shows that perceptions of professional develop-
ment barriers are significantly different between teachers
from public and private schools with regard to five aspects:
"I do not have the pre-requisites," "there is a lack of employer
support," "professional development conflicts with my work
schedule," "there is no relevant professional development
offered," and "there are no incentives for participating."
Teachers from private schools assign higher barrier scores to
not having pre-requisites, lack of employer support, and no
relevant professional development offered. On the contrary,
teachers from public schools assign higher barrier scores to
conflict with work schedule, and lack of incentives for
participating.
Differences Between General Public and
Vocational Public Schoolteachers
With regard to the perceived needs for professional develop-
ment activities, Table 1 shows that significant differences
exist between teachers from regular public schools and voca-
tional schools with regard to three activities only. The three
activities are related to knowledge and understanding of my
subject field(s), teaching students with special needs, and
teaching cross-curricular skills (e.g., problem solving and
learning to learn). For all three activities, teachers from regu-
lar public schools score relatively much higher needs.
Table 2 shows that teachers from regular public schools
and vocational public schools show significant differences in
impact for only six professional development activities. The
activities with significant differences for the two types of
schools are knowledge and understanding of my subject,
pedagogical competencies in teaching my subject fields(s),
knowledge of the curriculum, student evaluation and assess-
ment practices, approaches to individualized learning, and
student career guidance and counseling. Interestingly, teach-
ers from regular public schools show higher impact scores
for all professional activities.
Table 3 results show that teachers from regular public
schools and vocational public schools show significant dif-
ferences for only three professional development barriers:
not having the pre-requisites, professional development con-
flicting with work schedule, and lack of relevant professional
development offered. Teachers from regular public schools
assign higher barrier scores to not having the pre-requisites,
whereas teachers from vocational schools see that conflict
with work schedule and lack of relevant professional devel-
opment offered pose larger barriers.
Age Group Differences
Table 5 provides the general MANOVA results. We used
MANOVA to test the null hypothesis that the perceived
needs for professional activities are the same across the five
teachers' age groups. The Wilks's Lambda provides a value
of 0.919 with an F value of 6.386, which is significant at the
.001 level. As a result, we followed the analysis up with a
series of one-way ANOVAs to see individual differences
between the 14 professional development needs. Significant
results were resulted between almost all age groups. The
interesting thing here is that for most of the 14 variables, as
the teacher becomes older, the mean score related to per-
ceived need goes down (negative correlation). However,
there is a positive relationship between the teacher's age and
perceived need only with regard to two professional develop-
ment activities. These variables include ICT skills for teach-
ing and new technologies in workplaces.

With regard to perceived impact, MANOVA test yields a
Wilks's Lambda of 0.853 with an F value of 1.257, which is
not significant at the .05 level. MANOVA test reveals a sig-
nificant Wilks's Lambda value of 0.930 (F = 10.002) for the
perceived barriers to participate in professional development
activities for the different teachers' age groups. The series of
one-way ANOVAs show that significant differences exist
with regard to teachers' age for all the seven barriers to pro-
fessional development.
In general, results show that as teacher's age goes up, only
two perceived mean barriers go down: "I do not have the pre-
requisites," and "there is a lack of employer support." With
regard to the other barriers, mixed results are witnessed. For
all seven barriers, the highest perceived barriers are claimed
by teachers in the age groups 25 to 29 and 30 to 39 years. The
lowest perceived barriers are witnessed with teachers who
are aged 25 years or less, and those who are aged 40 years or
above.
On average, amongAbu Dhabi teachers, the amount of pro-
fessional development that teachers received decreased with
age. If age of a teacher is associated with his or her work expe-
rience as a teacher, then this finding indicates that, on average,
less-experienced teachers received more days of development
than more-experienced teachers. With regard to age, signifi-
cant differences were observed with regard to 10 of the 14
professional development activities. For all four activities on
this construct, no significant differences with regard to age
were related to teaching in a multicultural or multilingual set-
ting (F = 1.167, p  .203), approaches to develop cross-occu-
pational competencies for future work or future studies (F =
1.304, p  .080), new technologies in workplaces (F = 1.1261,
p  .109), and student career guidance and counseling (F =
1.348, p  .057). In general, for almost all other professional
development activities, as age of teachers increase, the per-
ceived level of need tends to go down.
Analysis of variance with regard to age of teachers and
the perceived impact of professional activities revealed the
existence of significant differences with regard to six activi-
ties only. These activities were related to knowledge and
understanding of my subject field(s)/impact, pedagogical
competencies in teaching my subject fields(s)/impact, stu-
dent evaluation and assessment practices/impact, ICT skills/
impact, student behavior and classroom management/impact,
and developing cross-occupational competencies/impact.
Again, in general, when age increases, the perception of
impact of professional activities decreases.
Older teachers assign significantly higher scores to almost
all listed items than younger teachers (except for profes-
sional development being too expensive and unaffordable)
where no significant difference is recorded.
Discussions
For Abu Dhabi, many of the teacher professional develop-
ment programs were meaningful and relevant because they
had transferrable impact in the classroom and a focus on
guided practice. Teachers felt that programs related to knowl-
edge of the curriculum, knowledge and understanding of
one's subject field, and student evaluation and assessment
practices had the greatest impacts. Out of the 14 professional
need activities, teachers also gave a high score for "teaching
students with special needs." This finding is significant,
because TALIS targets population did not include teachers
who only teach students with special learning needs. It is
probably a reflection of current trends in educational policy
particularly in Abu Dhabi. The first trend deals with the inte-
gration (or inclusion) of students with special learning needs
in mainstream schools (inclusive education). The other trend
deals with the growing emphasis on equity. This result is an
indication that teachers fromAbu Dhabi do not feel fully pre-
pared to cope with these challenges.
As further simple correlation analysis reveals a negative
overall correlation of (-.705) existing between teachers'
overall perception of the needs for professional development
and the impact of professional development items. As the
perceived need decreases, the perceived impact increases.
The negative correlation between teachers' perceived need
for and perceived impact of professional development should
be noted by ADEC and school decision makers. For Abu
Dhabi, results might indicate the lack of teacher understand-
ing of what professional development is needed.
Results showed that male teachers perceived more need
for school management and administration, and more teach-
ing in a multicultural or multilingual setting. Most teachers
come from other cultures other than the United Arab
Emirates. The findings are consistent with literature indicat-
ing that teachers' understanding of school management, in
fact, is often dependent on their knowledge of students' cul-
ture and backgrounds, language proficiency, and academic
needs. Wong and Snow (2000) indicated that teachers must
understand student culture and backgrounds, prior experi-
ences, culture, and language diversity to successfully teach
them, which is important for classroom management prac-
tices to be successful and appropriate for the students' needs.
Interestingly, the focused group discussions noted the fact
that teachers in private schools in Abu Dhabi may undertake
professional development, and pay for them by themselves,
to increase the possibility of obtaining a permanent position
in public schools. Many teachers thought that such profes-
sional development activities improve the rating of teachers
on which the appointment to public schools is based. Policy
makers may wish to explore approaches to engage teachers
and procure their investment in the process, perhaps by
accepting recommendations from teachers or teacher com-
mittees about staff development priorities, setting aside time
to meet with teachers about their professional development
learning plans, or speaking regularly to teachers to articulate
a vision for how the administrative professional develop-
ment priorities can enhance teachers' performance and even
job satisfaction.
Badri et al. 11
The most significant barrier to participating in profes-
sional development was related to conflict with work sched-
ule. Literature on professional development frequently
addresses scheduling and logistical issues, and such concepts
must be considered in any discussion of what it means to
have a sustained professional learning community (Witte &
Jansen, 2016) in which teachers are able to be learners in an
ongoing context. Family responsibilities were reported as a
barrier by 23.8% of teachers on average.
There is a significant negative correlation between the
extent to which teachers reported a lack of incentives or suit-
able professional development and the amount of profes-
sional development they actually had. In Abu Dhabi, on
average, teachers who reported a lack of suitable incentives
of participating in professional development actually partici-
pated in a smaller number of days of professional develop-
ment. As a result, there is a strong indication that there is
high association between the perceived lack of suitable
development opportunities and the amount of professional
development teachers enroll in. The lack of incentives and
lack of suitable professional development seem to be rela-
tively acute in Abu Dhabi.
The teacher's focus group discussions revealed a lack of
clear professional development program philosophy, stan-
dards, and goals. They also revealed a lack of deep and
meaningful involvement on the part of teachers in profes-
sional development planning, implementation, and evalua-
tion.Again, references to the importance of a strong structure
for professional development programming, and the neces-
sity of teachers being involved in the planning, implementa-
tion, and evaluation of professional development existed
including Bredeson (2003) and NSDC (2001).
The teachers' focus group stressed that relatively little
professional development program evaluation was con-
ducted to determine the value professional development has
on teachers' perception not only of the impact on their teach-
ing practice but also of the effect on student achievement.
This point is raised by other researchers too (Meissel et al.,
2016; Polly et al., 2015). The study recommends that using
need assessment tools such as the NSDC's (2001) Standards
for Staff Development. In addition, ADEC and school policy
makers should conduct a need assessment regarding teach-
ers' professional development needs, and evaluate profes-
sional development participation for impact regarding
effective teaching practices.
Conclusions, Implications, Future
Research Directions, and Limitations
ADEC should seek to balance the academic and emotional
learning needs of teachers, particularly those who are new to
Abu Dhabi and may be undergoing significant acculturation
and adjustment experiences. If policy is not responsive in
this manner, teachers find themselves under increased bur-
den, and they are unable to attend to what they perceive as
the much more important task of understanding their stu-
dents'cultural backgrounds, family and home situations, and
emotional needs. Increased time for teachers from other
nationalities to gain better cultural understanding would
allow teachers to devote time to supporting students in a
more effective manner.
Policy makers should allow for some participant choice in
determining professional development offerings. Although
research suggests that teachers need a core set of knowledge
in specific topics, particularly with respect to diverse learn-
ers (Ballantyne, Sanderman, & McLaughlin, 2008), this
study suggests that teachers find most opportunity for
engagement when they have the chance to select among a
menu of topics and to customize their professional develop-
ment experiences to their experience, prior knowledge, and
student populations. This may be accomplished by allowing
participants to complete various differentiated activities, pro-
viding a choice of face-to-face workshops, or some other
means such as online workshops (Dede, Ketelhut,
Whitehouse, Breit, & McClosey, 2009; Maria & García,
2016). Within Abu Dhabi schools, this study found the need
to more effectively plan, implement, and evaluate profes-
sional development program philosophy and activities and to
include and engage teachers in these processes. Teachers
shared that they are not meaningfully involved in the pro-
cesses of professional development planning, implementa-
tion, and evaluation. This finding was consistent with that of
previous research that details the value of involving teachers
in these processes (Bredeson, 2003).
The responses of Abu Dhabi teachers in this TALIS study
suggest that teachers appeared to identify classroom man-
agement as an important topic for staff development. This is
also mirrored in the literature, where researchers suggest that
classroom management may, in fact, have a number of other
components which affect students'ability to successfully fol-
low requirements and achieve (Polly et al., 2015; Mastropieri
& Scruggs, 2010).
It should be noted that the Abu Dhabi education system
has a unique setting, especially with regard to public schools.
Boys and girls are segregated starting from the fifth grade.
According to ADEC records in 2015, in girl public schools,
female UAE national teachers comprise 47.78% of the
female teacher's workforce. On the contrary, in boys'
schools, male UAE national teachers comprise less than
13.35% of the total male teacher workforce (86.64% are for-
eign UAE teachers). According to ADEC 2015 records, for
the male teachers from public schools, teachers come from
more than 118 nationalities. As a result, Abu Dhabi has
increasing numbers of culturally and linguistically diverse
teachers. Teachers whose professional development may not
have addressed those students' particular needs often find
that their skills and current knowledge base are not sufficient
to help students. Therefore, an increasingly important area of
teacher education and professional development involves
providing teachers information about cultural and linguistic
12 SAGE Open
diversity, as it affects both typical and atypical learners, help-
ing teachers to identify effective teaching practices to meet
the needs of students.
Results showed that teachers participated most in profes-
sional development programs where a group of colleagues
from their school or subject group actively communicated
with each other. The researchers recommend making social
networking (face-to-face or online) a more frequent part of
school activities and professional development structures. As
several teachers also indicated, some of their most formative
learning experiences came in the form of peer-to-peer inter-
actions with colleagues. Mentoring activities, pairing teach-
ers for work on particular tasks or for participation in
particular professional development activities--all of these
may help to increase opportunities for teachers to interact
within contexts, providing the opportunity for an exchange
of knowledge. The results also suggest that school leaders
make an effort to consciously expand their expectations and
their conceptual frameworks so as to view such informal
social networking within the context of its relationship to
technology. It may be easy for administrators to think that
faculty meetings should not include time to socialize or that
such socializing distracts everyone from focusing on school
goals and objectives.
Some related research addressed the causal links between
teachers' continuing professional development, their active
participation in professional development, and their beliefs
about learning and teaching (de Vries, van de Grift, & Jansen,
2013). Because the TALIS survey includes variables related
to teachers' beliefs and their need to participate in profes-
sional development, future research should try to better
understand the causal linkage between participation in pro-
fessional development, activities, and teachers' beliefs about
learning and teaching.
ForAbu Dhabi schools, especially public schools, most pro-
fessional development programs are centralized and mainly
offered through ADEC. Future research should look into the
question of the implications of this system-level factor.
Although TALIS did not directly reference online learning
experiences, the researchers recommend that practitioners, as
well as researchers, continue to explore feasibility of, and
teachers'responses to, online professional development initia-
tives. For Abu Dhabi, the lack of teacher feedback or response
to online professional development may, in fact, be more
reflective of a lack of exposure to online professional develop-
ment opportunities, rather than a negative set of experiences in
actual online experiences. The introduction of web-based
information technology has presented new opportunities for
offering professional development and knowledge online
(Fore, Feldhaus, Sorge, Agarwal, & Varahramyan, 2015;
Girvan et al., 2016; Kao, Tsai, & Shih, 2014; Maria & García,
2016). With their feature of no time or space limitations, web-
based resources can provide teachers with a more flexible way
of pursuing professional development. While enhancing
teachers' willingness to participate in online courses, it can
also motivate them to gradually change their teaching from
traditional ways (e.g., face-to-face lectures, single location) to
a more flexible and adjustable approach based on individual
needs (Hartley, 2010). Future research should try to link some
TALIS variables with other variables related to web-based
professional development of teachers.
Because the TALIS research involved teachers from only
lower and upper secondary schools, the researcher recom-
mends replicating this study to determine the generalizability
and relevance of the findings across other schools and teacher
or student populations. The new studies would provide use-
ful information to supplement, corroborate, or further con-
textualize the findings of this study. In addition, future
research may replicate this study with a larger teacher popu-
lation, so as to determine whether the same patterns, themes,
and findings are consistent across a larger group of teachers
(situated either in one school or in a cluster of schools).
The study's findings suggest that the structure and type of
professional development offered in schools can affect the
degree to which teachers feel professional development
meets their needs. It is also recommended that researchers
conduct further research on restructuring of school-based
professional development opportunities so as to further
teachers' engagement, investment, and ability for long-term
involvement with a particular issue.
For Abu Dhabi, this study has given rise to important
questions that could be addressed by teachers and research-
ers working in partnership to expand the knowledge base in
the field of teacher professional development:
·
· Under what conditions does teacher learning that is
associated with professional development get trans-
ferred to the classroom?
·
· What are the effects on student learning of teachers
who do not have backgrounds in the relevant disci-
plines to teach students?
·
· How does professional development in the area of
cultural understanding affect the way teachers teach
children from culturally and linguistically diverse
backgrounds? What adjustments do teachers make as
a result of this knowledge?
The current study used teacher's age and gender, and type
of school being public or private as the independent vari-
ables. Future studies should further consider teacher's teach-
ing experience, subject taught, and school size and school
location. Related research considered these factors signifi-
cant in measuring the effectiveness of professional develop-
ment (U.S. Department of Education, 1997).
Although the study describes teacher's perceptions about
professional development, it cannot describe school climate,
achievement, or teacher knowledge/skills in any more gen-
eral context. The message for ADEC is that to provide pro-
fessional development which aligns with teachers'
perceptions of their needs, and procures the investment of
Badri et al. 13
the teachers participating, it is important that schools and
administrators consider the diverse backgrounds of teachers
as well as their students, provide inter-related and numerous
opportunities for interaction among professional colleagues,
and strive to create a school environment which maximizes
opportunities for collaboration as well as for learning.
