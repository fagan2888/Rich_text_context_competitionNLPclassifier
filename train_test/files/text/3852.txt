Article
The number of people who use synthetic drugs, such as
amphetamine-type stimulants (ATS) and ecstasy, has
increased in recent years across the globe (United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014). China is no exception.
Official statistics show that the rate of synthetic drug use in
China grew faster than the rate of natural drug use (China
National Narcotics Control Commission Office, 2015), espe-
cially among the younger population. Nationally, approxi-
mately 75% of the 7 million synthetic drug users in mainland
China are below the age of 35 years (China CCTV, 2015).
Although what fueled the rapid increase in synthetic drug
abuse in China is not completely known, there seems to be
little doubt that the popularity of synthetic drugs among
youth and adolescents has played an important role shaping
the trend. Unlike American youth who are more likely to use
marijuana than any other illicit drug (Johnston, O'Malley,
Miech, Bachman, & Schulenberg, 2017), adolescents in
Asia, especially those in the Greater China Region, typically
choose synthetic drugs as their drugs of choice. Official sta-
tistics released by the Food and Drug Administration of
China (2014) show that people below the age of 18 years are
far more likely to use synthetic drugs than traditional drugs.
This pattern holds true in Macao, a Special Administrative
Region of China and the only place in the country where
gambling is legal. According to the surveys conducted by
Macao's Social Welfare Bureau in 2010 and 2014, metham-
phetamine and ketamine were the most frequently used drugs
among young drug users in recent years (Macao Social
Welfare Bureau, 2010, 2014). In consistency with the survey
data, official statistics from the Central Registration System
for Drug Abusers of Macao also show that young drug users
registered in the system disproportionally used synthetic
drugs such as methamphetamine and ketamine as opposed to
traditional drugs (Macao Social Welfare Bureau, 2016).
To reverse the trend of increase in synthetic drug use
among adolescents in the Greater China Region, we need
countermeasures that are scientifically based and effective. A
starting point in developing such countermeasures is to iden-
tify culturally relevant factors contributing to the problem.
However, there has been little scientific evidence that can
serve as a basis for building systematic understanding of the
key driving forces leading to the spread of adolescent syn-
thetic drug abuse in this region. Our study aims to contribute
to the knowledge base through a population-based survey.
While large-scale representative studies are lacking,
smaller studies using nonprobability samples have offered
some suggestions of potential predictors of adolescent use of
synthetical drugs in the Greater China Region. One of the

Predictors and Implications of Synthetic
Drug Use Among Adolescents in the
Gambling Capital of China
Spencer D. Li1, Xiaohua Zhang1, Wei Tang1, and Yiwei Xia1
Abstract
Synthetic drug abuse has become an increasingly serious problem among adolescents in Macao, the world's largest gambling
market and the only legal gambling place in China. To counteract this trend, a good understanding of the culturally relevant
risk factors for this behavior is required. Based on social learning theory and opportunity perspective of deviance, logistic
regression analysis was performed on a probability sample of 8,076 Macao students collected in 2014 to investigate whether
delinquent peer association, recreational use of time with friends, attitudes toward drug use, and the availability of synthetic
drugs are significant predictors of synthetic drug use among adolescents. The analyses revealed that students who had more
drug-using peers, perceived drug use to be less harmful, and had easier access to synthetic drugs were more likely to use
drugs. The findings indicate that preventing synthetic drug use among adolescents should target individual risk factors and
the availability of drugs.

key factors might be party culture, a form of socializing that
has taken a strong hold in major cities in the region in the
past several decades (Joe-Laidler & Hunt, 2008; Macau
Daily, 2015; Zhou, 2016). Adolescents influenced by this
culture tend to see synthetic drug use as a way to fit in with
friends and to have fun in a party setting. They do not neces-
sarily consider synthetic substances, such as ketamine, to be
drugs at all. In their minds, traditional drugs, such as opium
and heroin, are dangerous and should be avoided. To these
young people, synthetic drugs do not pose the same risks and
are acceptable to use, especially when doing it with friends
(Lam, Boey, Wong, & Tse, 2004; Lee, 2007; Macau Daily,
2015; Zhou, 2016). Taking advantage of the demand created
by party culture, drug dealers market synthetic drugs to ado-
lescents as recreational consumer goods, promote the use of
methamphetamine or ketamine as new types of fashion, and
propagate the notion that the occasional use of synthetic
drugs is harmless. They also offer discounts and incentives to
attract young people to these drugs and encourage them to
keep the habit (Meacher, 2013; Xiang, 2015). All of these
circumstances surrounding party culture appeared to contrib-
ute to the increase in the recreational use of synthetic drugs
in entertainment venues, such as KTVs (karaoke televisions)
and dance clubs among adolescents and young adults.
Second, a major change in the drug trafficking routes through
Asia has boosted the supply of synthetic drugs in this region.
The new trafficking route to Asia passes through Mexico, the
Middle East, Southwest Asia, West Africa, and finally to
drug-consuming countries in East and Southeast Asia, such
as Japan and China. Methamphetamine, for example, is fre-
quently trafficked from West Africa to South Africa or
Europe and later to East and Southeast Asia (United Nations
Office on Drugs and Crime, 2014; Wyler & Cook, 2011).
This change has increased synthetic drug trafficking to Asia.
At the street level, drug dealers increasingly rely on the sale
of synthetic drugs for profit. These market conditions have
increased the supply and use of synthetic drugs in this part of
the world.
The primary purpose of the current research is to identify
culturally relevant predictors of synthetic drug use among
adolescents in Macao. Built on prior knowledge in this area,
this study focuses on the modern party culture and drug
availability while taking into account of other potential cor-
relates of the delinquent behavior.
Literature Review
Lam et al. (2004) and Hunt, Joe-Laidler, Moloney, van der
Poel, and van de Mheen (2011) attributed the spread of drug
use among urban adolescents to the modern party culture,
which places heavy emphasis on communicating with friends
and regards the use of psychoactive drugs as a ritual, a form
of recreation, and an activity enhancer (e.g., dancing and
singing). Youth in the Greater China Region who are drawn
to the party culture tend to share at least three characteristics.
First, they have more unconventional friends and peer rela-
tionships. Second, they spend more time in recreational
activities. Third, they have more favorable attitudes toward
psychoactive drugs (Hua & Li, 2009; Perrone & Sanders,
2006; Xu, 2009; Zhang & Han, 2015). These three social and
personal characteristics have each been shown to positively
correlate with substance abuse (Arthur et al., 2007; Arthur,
Hawkins, Pollard, & Catalano, 2002; Hawkins, Catalano, &
Miller, 1992; Johnson, Marcos, & Bahr, 1987; Kandel &
Andrews, 1987; Yanovitzky, 2005). Drug availability has
also been found to be a significant predictor of illicit drug
use. For many adolescents, drug use is a choice of pastime.
They may start to use drugs when the activity is encouraged
and approved by peers and when an illicit drug is readily
available. First-time use does not usually require a lot of
effort. Continuing use over a period of time, however, may
depend more on one's ability to obtain drugs. Either behavior
is tied to the availability of drugs (Desmond, Bruce, & Stacer,
2012; Hogan, Tsui, & Ivanov, 2003; Nargiso, Friend, &
Florin, 2013).
Peer Influence, Time in Recreation, Attitudes
Toward Drugs, and Addictive Behavior
One of the strongest and most consistent correlates of delin-
quency in the criminology literature is the association with
delinquent peers, especially during adolescence when the
relationship with friends supersedes the relationship with
parents (Thornberry, 2005). According to the social learning
theory, individuals learn deviant behavior (e.g., drug use)
through their associations with other people, such as family
members, siblings, and peers (Akers & Sellers, 2009;
Petraitis, Flay, & Miller, 1995). Individuals associated with
deviant peers are more likely to hold attitudes favorable to
deviance, learn the skills to commit crime, and engage in
deviant or criminal behavior (Sutherland, Cressey, &
Luckenbill, 1992). Many studies have indicated that associa-
tion with substance-using peers is significantly and posi-
tively correlated with substance use among youth (Hawkins
et al., 1992; Johnson & Hoffmann, 2000; Kaplan, Martin, &
Robbins, 1984; Peralta & Steele, 2010). Perceived drug use
in peer groups is also a strong predictor of adolescents' atti-
tudes and actual drug use (Iannotti & Bush, 1992; Simons-
Morton & Farhat, 2010). A meta-analytic study comparing
the influence of parents and peers found that peers and
friends have stronger influences than parents on adolescent
substance use (Allen, Donohue, Griffin, Ryan, & Turner,
2003). Research conducted in Hong Kong and Taiwan also
found that peer influence contributed significantly to youth
drug use (Laidler & Pianpiano, 2006; Shek, 2007). A similar
pattern has been observed in Macao. Studies conducted by Li
and colleagues (Li, Tang, Xia, & Zhang, 2016; Li, Zhang,
Tang, Xia, & Lin, 2016) found that the association and time
spent with delinquent peers were positively correlated to
drug use among adolescents in Macao.
Li et al. 3
Furthermore, several studies examining the relationship
between leisure activities and antisocial behavior have found
that certain recreational activities (e.g., going out at night)
increased the risk of problematic behavior (e.g., drug use)
among youth (Berg, Aslanikashvili, & Djibuti, 2014;
Mahoney & Stattin, 2000; Piko & Vazsonyi, 2004). Casual
leisure activities, such as hanging out with friends for fun,
were found to be associated with heavy drinking among high
school seniors (Bachman et al., 2002) and first-year college
students (Finlay, Ram, Maggs, & Caldwell, 2012). Piko and
Vazsonyi (2004) found that peer-oriented or commercial-
based leisure activities are positively correlated with prob-
lem behavior among Hungarian youth aged 14 to 19 years.
Findings from Monitoring the Future consistently indicated
that socializing with peers away from home and authority
figures is closely related to deviant behavior (Johnston,
O'Malley, Schulenberg, & Bachman, 2006).
A number of studies have found that juveniles who had
favorable attitudes toward drugs and drug use were more
likely to use drugs (Bretteville-Jensen & Jacobi, 2011;
Hawkins et al., 1992; Kandel, Kessler, & Margulies, 1978).
The perceived harms of drug use are especially important in
predicting substance abuse. Studies have found that adoles-
cents have a tendency to underestimate the harms of certain
drugs, especially synthetic drugs that are designed to appeal
to young people (National Institute on Drug Abuse, 2014).
Furthermore, limited health literacy and the lack of personal
awareness of the risks of substance use contribute to the mis-
use and/or abuse of psychotic drugs (Shek, 2012; Shone,
King, Doane, Wilson, & Wolf, 2011). A study of 100 adoles-
cent synthetic drug users in Shanghai, China, found that the
respondents' lack of understanding of the harmfulness of
drugs and drug use was the main reason for their involve-
ment in synthetic drug abuse (Fan & Li, 2012).
Drug Availability and Drug Use
The availability of drugs in community has also been identi-
fied as a significant predictor of the prevalence and frequency
of adolescent drug use, especially for those who are prone to
drug use because of delinquent peer associations, beliefs, or
affectivity (Caviness, Tzilos, Anderson, & Stein, 2015;
Coudun, Gégout, Piedallu, & Rameau, 2006; Dembo,
Farrow, Schmeidler, & Burgos, 1979; Gillmore et al., 1990;
Lettieri, 1980; Smart, 1980; Teichman, Barnea, & Rahav,
1989). This idea is highlighted in the availability-proneness
theory of drug abuse proposed by Reginald Smart, which
contends that drug abuse is more likely to occur when a drug-
prone individual is exposed to a high level of availability
(Smart, 1980). This notion is consistent with the opportunity
perspective in the criminology literature. In their popular
book A General Theory of Crime, Gottfredson and Hirschi
(1990) argued that people with low self-control, character-
ized by impulsiveness and risk-taking, have a higher propen-
sity for criminal behavior. The actual commission of crime,
however, is conditioned by illegitimate opportunity. People
with low self-control will likely commit a crime when the
opportunity presents itself. Without the opportunity, criminal
proneness may not actually result in a criminal act. In this
regard, drug availability can be seen as an opportunity factor.
Adolescents influenced by delinquent peers and delinquent
beliefs are more likely to use drugs when they are readily
available or accessible. However, their proneness to drug use
may stay dormant if drugs are inaccessible to them. Several
studies have confirmed that drug availability has a signifi-
cant effect on adolescent drug use (Bretteville-Jensen &
Jacobi, 2011; Coudun et al., 2006; Feldman, Boyer, Kumar,
& Prout, 2011; Freisthler, Gruenewald, Johnson, Treno, &
Lascala, 2005; Parker, Williams, & Aldridge, 2002;
Lindström & Svensson, 1998).
Current Research
Although researchers have conducted a large number of
studies on synthetic drug use among youth in the past several
decades, there is still a lack of understanding of the factors
contributing to synthetic drug abuse. Most of the research on
drug use has been conducted in the West. Studies examining
the causes of synthetic drug use among adolescents have
been scarce in the Greater China Region, especially in
Macao. A survey of students in schools conducted recently
by Li and associates (2015) found that adolescents in Macao
had a higher rate of synthetic drug use than their counterparts
in nearby regions. However, the study did not explain why
Macao adolescents were more likely to use synthetic drugs.
Most of the studies on synthetic drug use conducted in the
Greater China Region have been descriptive based on data
collected from nonprobability samples. Studies examining
the influence of peers, drug use attitude, party culture and
availability of drugs usually focused on one of these factors
without considering the contribution of the other factors.
Multivariate statistical analysis using rigorous methodology
and large random sample is rare. To date, reliable evidence is
lacking with regard to how those factors influence adolescent
use of synthetic drugs in the Greater China Region. This
study attempts to fill this gap. Specifically, it tests the follow-
ing hypotheses.
Hypothesis 1: Factors related to the modern party cul-
ture, including association with drug-using peers, time
spent on recreational activities with friends, and favorable
attitudes toward synthetic drugs, significantly predict syn-
thetic drug use among Macao adolescents. All of these
factors have been known as correlates of adolescent drug
use. As an unconventional way of making friends and
sharing experiences, party culture increases adolescents'
exposure to these risk factors, which in turn leads to a
higher level of involvement in synthetic drug use.
Hypothesis 2: The availability of synthetic drugs poses
an additional risk factor for synthetic drug use among
4 SAGE Open
Macao adolescents. The common motives for adolescents
in Macao to use drugs appear to be curiosity and the pur-
suit of fun and excitement (Li et al., 2015). They may not
use them or doing it less frequently if they must spend
considerable effort to acquire synthetic drugs. On the con-
trary, if the drugs are more readily available at the time
they want to use them, they will be more likely to seize
the opportunity to engage in drug-using behavior.
Method
Data
The data used in this study were collected in Students and
Drugs in Macao 2014, a large-scale survey sponsored by the
government of Macao and conducted by the research team.
The main purpose of the study was to identify the level and
pattern of substance abuse among students enrolled in Macao
schools and colleges and the factors related to their addictive
behavior. The target population was fifth- and sixth-grade
primary school students, middle school students, and high
school students in Macao. To increase representativeness, we
applied a multistage stratified probability-proportional-to-
size cluster sampling method to select 15 primary schools
and 20 secondary schools. The sample consisted of nearly
8,300 students who were asked to participate in the survey
from July to December of 2014. Strict procedures were used
to ensure voluntary participation and to protect the students'
confidentiality. The response rate was approximately 97%.
Using a structured, self-administrated questionnaire, we
collected the following information in the survey: demo-
graphic characteristics, family background, parenting prac-
tices, routine activities, school performance, attitudes toward
drug use, antidrug education experience, and drug use. Many
items on the questionnaire were based on standard instru-
ments used in previous studies conducted in other cultural
contexts, such as the National Longitudinal Study of Youth
1997 (NLSY97) and Monitoring the Future (Johnston,
O'Malley, Bachman, Schulenberg, & Miech, 2014). When
necessary, we modified the items to accommodate for
Macao's context. Trained investigators administered the sur-
vey in class. To prevent interference, we asked teachers to
step out of the classroom when conducting the survey.
Altogether, we received 8,076 completed questionnaires:
1,172 from elementary students, 3,185 from middle school
students, and 3,719 from high school students.
Measurements
The key variables examined in this study were synthetic drug
use, association with drug-using peers, time spent in recre-
ational activities with friends, attitudes toward synthetic drugs,
and the availability of synthetic drugs. We also included a set
of control variables in the regression analysis. The appendix
provides a summary of the variables and their measures.
Synthetic drug use. Previous studies show that the same pre-
dictor may have different effect on substance use depending
on whether drug use is measured as 30-day, annual or life-
time prevalence of use (Gao et al., 2010; Johnston et al.,
2017; O'Malley, Bachman, & Johnston, 1983). To test
whether the predictive power of the key variables varies by
type of prevalence of use, we included three measures of
synthetic drug use: past-month use, past-year use, and life-
time use. In the survey, the respondents were asked how
many times they had used ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ice/
methamphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and mid-
azolam), and hybrid synthetic drugs in the past 30 days, in
the past 12 months, and in their lifetime. Each item was mea-
sured on a 7-point scale, where 1 = 0 occasions and 7 = 40 or
more occasions. Because our primary focus is prevalence of
use among the youth population, we dichotomized the mea-
sures of synthetic drug use such that 0 = did not use any
synthetic drug and 1 = used at least one type of synthetic
drug. This measurement approach is common in population-
based studies of drug use (Herman-Stahl, Krebs, Kroutil, &
Heller, 2007; McCabe, Knight, Teter, & Wechsler, 2005;
Stogner & Miller, 2014).
Association with synthetic drug-using peers.Association with
synthetic drug-using peers is a composite variable, measured
by five items asking how many of the respondent's friends
were thought to use ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ice/metham-
phetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and midazolam), or
hybrid synthetic drugs. The responses were measured on a
5-point scale ranging from none to all, with higher values indi-
cating more synthetic drug-using friends. Cronbach's alpha
for these five items was 0.92, indicating high-level interitem
correlations. We computed a mean score of these items as a
measure of the association with synthetic drug-using peers.
Recreational use of time with friends. The frequency of recre-
ational use of time with friends was measured by asking the
respondents how often they met with friends informally,
such as going to a party or hanging out. The responses ranged
from 1 = never to 5 = nearly daily.
Attitudes toward synthetic drugs.We focused on the perceived
harms of synthetic drug use. The respondents were asked to
respond to four statements designed to assess their perceived
harms of synthetic drug use (e.g., "How much do you think
people risk harming themselves if they occasionally/regularly
use ketamine?"). The responses ranged from 1 = no risk to 5 =
great risk. We reverse recoded the four items and computed
their mean to measure attitudes toward synthetic drug use.
Higher scores represented lower perceived harms or more
favorable attitudes toward synthetic drug use (alpha = 0.93).
Availability of synthetic drugs. The respondents were asked to
report how difficult they thought it would be for them to
obtain synthetic drugs, such as ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA,
Li et al. 5
ice/methamphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and mid-
azolam), and hybrid synthetic drugs. The responses ranged
from 1 = nearly impossible to 5 = very easy. The alpha coef-
ficient for the five questions was 0.90, indicating a high level
of interitem correlation. We computed a single measure by
taking the mean of all responses, with higher values repre-
senting greater levels of synthetic drug availability.
Control variables.We included several other risk factors,
all of which have been shown to correlate with adolescent
drug use in studies conducted outside Macao, as potential
competing explanations to the explanatory variables listed
above. Parental supervision was measured by asking the
respondent's perceived supervision and rule-setting from
their mother and father. The scale is measured by taking
an average of 10 items, five for mother and five for father.
The overall alpha equals to 0.90. Low self-control is mea-
sured by Hirschi's (2004) 9-item measurement, and the
scale is ranged from 0 to 9. School attachment is measured
by seven questions on how the respondents' bond to
school or school life (alpha = 0.68). Risk-taking is mea-
sured by two items on the respondent's tendency for risk-
taking behavior (alpha = 0.70). We also included a variable
measuring whether the respondent participated in any
antidrug educational programs. The variable was coded as
1 if the respondent participated in a program and 0 if he or
she did not.
Last, we included demographic and family background
variables that may operate as common confounders affecting
adolescents' synthetic drug-using behavior (Flynn, Falco, &
Hocini, 2015; Hemovich & Crano, 2009; Substance Abuse
and Mental Health Services Administration, 2014). Gender
was coded as 1 for females and 0 for males. Grade was coded
as 1 for elementary school, 2 for middle school, and 3 for
high school. In the analysis, we computed two dummy vari-
ables representing middle and high school students and
treated elementary school students as a reference group.
Two-parent home was measured by asking respondents with
whom they lived. It was coded as a dummy variable, with 1
for living with both parents and 0 for the rest. Parents' work-
ing status was measured by asking the respondents whether
their father/mother had a paid job. The answers were coded
as 1 for yes and 0 for no. We computed two dummy variables
by combining the answers for father and mother to indicate
that one of the parents had a paid job or neither of them had
a paid job. Respondents whose parents both had paid jobs
were regarded as the reference group.
Analytical Method
We first use cross-tabulation to explore the prevalence rate of
synthetic drug use in the past month, past year, and lifetime
by gender and grade of the respondents. Three multivariate
logistic regressions are then conducted to investigate the fac-
tors associated with synthetic drug use. Case-wise deleting
method is used to handle item missing in the response. The
statistic software applied in the current study is STATA 14.0.
Results
Descriptive Results
About 1.46% of the respondents had used at least one type of
synthetic drug, such as ketamine, ecstasy/MDMA, ice/meth-
amphetamine, tranquilizers (e.g., rohypnol and midazolam),
and hybrid synthetic drugs, in their lifetime. Approximately
1.04% and 0.78% of them had used in the past year and past
month, respectively (see Table 1).
The rates of synthetic use among male adolescents were
higher than those of female adolescents for lifetime use
(1.79% vs. 1.04%), past-year use (1.29% vs. 0.70%), and
past-month use (1.03% vs. 0.44%). Grade differences were
also noticeable. Synthetic drug use was most prevalent
among fifth and sixth graders at the elementary school level.
The rate of use was higher among middle school students
than high school students with regard to past-year use (1.01%
vs. 0.95%) and past-month use (0.76% vs. 0.61%). High
school students, however, had a higher lifetime use rate than
middle school students (1.45% vs. 1.33%; see Table 1).
Overall, the statistics shown in Table 1 indicate that synthetic
drug use is more prevalent among younger students in the
population of fifth to 12th graders in Macao. This finding is
consistent with the results of several other studies showing
that synthetic drug users in Macao are getting younger
(Deng, 2011; Li, 2016; Li, Zhang, et al., 2016). However, the
reason that students in lower grades were more likely to use
synthetic drugs has not been explored in previous research.
In the current study, students from elementary schools
reported lower participation in antidrug educational pro-
grams, which might be responsible for their relatively higher
rate of synthetic drug use.
Logistic Regression Analysis Results
We constructed three logistic regression models, each with
one of the three measures of synthetic drug use as the depen-
dent variable. As shown in Table 2, the association with syn-
thetic drug-using peers was significantly and positively
correlated to the students'synthetic drug use throughout their
lifetime, in the past year, and in the past month. More specifi-
cally, a one-unit increase in the measure of association with
synthetic drug-using peers (e.g., from 1 = none to 2 = very
few) increases the odds of an adolescent's lifetime use of
synthetic drugs by approximately 1.47 times (2.47 - 1.00 =
1.47), past-year use by 1.36 times (2.36 - 1.00 = 1.36) and
past-month use by 1.29 times (2.29 - 1.00 = 1.29). All of
these statistical tests were significant with p < .001.
Second, recreational use of time with friends was not a
significant predictor of lifetime, past-year, and past-month
use of synthetic drugs among Macao adolescents.
6 SAGE Open
Attitudes toward synthetic drug use were also signifi-
cantly related to synthetic drug use. Compared with those
who perceived greater risk of synthetic drug use, adolescents
who perceived lower risk were much more likely to use syn-
thetic drugs. Specifically, a one-unit decrease on the 5-point
scale used to measure perceived harms of synthetic drug use
would increase the likelihood of lifetime use by 1.70 times,
past-year use by 1.58 times, and past-month use by 1.60
times. The coefficients for lifetime, past-year, and past-
month use were all significant with p < .001.
The availability of synthetic drugs was also found to be a
significant predictor of synthetic drug use. A one-unit
increase on the 5-point scale (e.g., from "nearly impossible"
to "very difficult") measuring availability of synthetic drugs
was associated with an increase in lifetime use of synthetic
drugs by 0.16 times, past-year use by 0.22 times, and past-
month use by 0.19 times. All coefficients were significant
with p < .05.
Discussion
The results of the regression analysis are mostly consistent
with our expectations. Of the key independent variables
assessed in the regression analysis, association with syn-
thetic drug-using peers and favorable attitudes toward syn-
thetic drugs stood out as the strongest predictors of synthetic
drug use among Macao adolescents. Specifically, increased
delinquent peer associations and decreased perceived harms

of drug use are strongly correlated with elevated levels of
synthetic drug use in the past month, past year, and lifetime.
These findings lend strong support for the social learning
theory, which identifies delinquent peer association and
favorable attitudes toward delinquency as the primary influ-
ences facilitating delinquent behavior. In support of the
opportunity perspective of criminological theory, this study
finds that drug availability is significantly and positively cor-
related with the three measures of synthetic drug use. These
relationships, however, are not as strong as those for delin-
quent peer associations and attitudes toward synthetic drugs,
suggesting that individual-level factors, such as choice of
friends and antidrug attitudes, may play more important roles
in influencing adolescents' synthetic drug use.
Despite this study's extensive scope and representative-
ness, it has some limitations. This study is one of only a few
surveys in Asia that have adopted many questions from U.S.
surveys of adolescent drug use such as Monitoring the
Future. The use of standard instruments has the advantage of
producing measures with strong validity and reliability as
shown in this study. On the flip side, however, this practice
may have undermined our ability to capture culturally rele-
vant variation. For example, the results show that time spent
in recreational activities is not a significant predictor of ado-
lescent synthetic drug use in Macao. This unexpected finding
may be related to the measurement we used. In consistency
with how time with friends is measured in Monitoring the
Future, we asked the student respondents how often they had
met with friends informally, such as going to a party or hang-
ing out. These questions may not be specific enough to mea-
sure time-sharing activities with friends that amplify
synthetic drug use in the specific cultural setting, such as
going to KTVs or attending parties where synthetic drugs
(e.g., ketamine) are used. There are also two design issues
that may limit the validity of the study. First, the research
design was cross-sectional. The relationships discovered in
the analysis are correlational in nature and should be inter-
preted as such. More studies are needed to test the causal
links between delinquent peer associations, recreational use
of time with friends, proneness to drugs, and availability of
synthetic drugs and synthetic drug use. Second, the respon-
dents only consisted of students who attended school during
the time of the survey. Adolescents who dropped out of
school or did not attend their classes were not included in the
survey. Studies have shown that adolescents who do not go
to school tend to have higher rates of drug use than those
who do (Henry, 2010; Henry & Thornberry, 2010; Li et al.,
2011). Thus, our results can only be applied to at-school stu-
dents in Macao. Consequently, the overall rate of drug use
among adolescents in Macao may have been underestimated.
Future studies should make a better effort to reach out to ado-
lescents who do not attend schools.
With a population of approximately 600,000, Macao is at
best a midsize city by Chinese standards. Despite the recent
growth of the gaming industry, part of the society remains
conventional with a high level of informal social control (Li,
2014), which may explain the overall lower rate of delin-
quency (e.g., drug use) in this society. However, significant
risks exist for adolescent drug use, as shown in this study.
First, like young people elsewhere, Macao adolescents are
susceptible to the bad influences of unconventional peers.
The opportunities for Macao adolescents to develop delin-
quent peer associations have become ever greater. Macao is
a popular tourist destination. Thousands of tourists pour into
the city every day (Macao Statistics and Census Service,
2016). Some of these visitors are young vagabonds from
Hong Kong, Guangdong, and other places in China, trying to
make money through illegal activities, such as synthetic drug
trafficking. They prey on adolescents using various market-
ing techniques and even befriend them (Macao Social
Welfare Bureau, 2016). Adolescents in Macao also travel to
Hong Kong and bordering Chinese cities to meet people and
to have parties. Sometimes, the main purpose of their trips is
to buy and use drugs (Li, 2016). With more opportunities to
meet unconventional peers, some adolescents, especially
those with family and school problems, will be at high risk of
developing delinquent peer associations. Indeed, a sizable
portion of our sample reported that they had friends who
smoke, drink, or use drugs. This kind of peer relationship
may increase their likelihood to use drugs. Second, under the
influence of the modern party culture, synthetic drug use has
increasingly been seen as an acceptable way to have fun by
many adolescents in the Peal Delta Region including Macao
(Joe-Laidler & Hunt, 2008; Macau Daily, 2015; Zhou, 2016).
Adolescents exposed to the subculture tend to underestimate
the harms of synthetic drug use. For many of these young
people, traditional drugs such as opium and heroin are addic-
tive and dangerous. Synthetic drugs, on the contrary, do not
carry the same level of risk and are therefore safer to use. If
unchecked, the internationalization of these cultural norms
may lead to a significantly higher rate of synthetic drug
abuse among the youth population. Third, synthetic drugs
have become increasingly accessible to adolescents who
want to use them. In the past, most drugs trafficked to Macao
were opioids from Southeast Asia, particularly, the Golden
Triangle. Nowadays, synthetic drugs, such as ketamine and
methamphetamine, have largely replaced opioids. The
regions of China close to Macao, especially Guangdong
Province, have become major producers of synthetic drugs
(China National Narcotics Control Commission Office,
2015). Due to geographic proximity, Macao has become a
key market for these illegal substances (Macao Social
Welfare Bureau, 2016). Easy access to synthetic drugs pro-
vides more opportunities for sensation-seeking adolescents
to use them.
The results of this study suggest that public policies aimed
at preventing synthetic drug use among Macao adolescents
should promote several key strategies. One way is to pay more
attention to adolescents who are more peer-oriented and are
more frequently associated with drug-using peers. Parents,
8 SAGE Open
teachers, and social workers should encourage adolescents to
develop healthy relationships with conventional peers (Barnes,
Reifman, Farrell, & Dintcheff, 2000; Cottrell, Li, Harris,
D'Alessandri, & Stanton, 2003; Li, Stanton, & Feigelman,
2000). Another strategy is to educate adolescents about the
harms of synthetic drug use and strengthen their antidrug atti-
tudes. Adolescents who believe that drug use is unacceptable
or harmful are much less likely to use drugs (Alhyas et al.,
2015). Parents, teachers, and relevant government agencies
can all play important roles in helping students develop the
right attitudes toward drugs and drug use. Another strategy is
to control the supply of drugs. Police and customs agencies
should explore more effective approaches for reducing drug
trafficking and drug selling activities. One thing the agencies
can do is to intensify border patrol by using better technolo-
gies, such as mobile x-ray machines and drug-sniffing dogs,
and to increase the punishment for drug trafficking (Floyd,
Alexandre, Hedden, Lawson, & Latimer, 2010; Halverson,
2004). Currently, drug traffickers face a maximum of 15 years
of imprisonment in Macao. Many people have argued that this
punishment does not provide sufficient deterrence (China
Court, 2012; China News, 2010; Macao Daily News, 2015).
An increase in the severity of punishment may stop more peo-
ple from smuggling and selling drugs in Macao.
