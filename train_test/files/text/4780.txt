Regional design: Discretionary
approaches to regional
planning in The Netherlands

Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands
Abstract
In recent decades, The Netherlands has seen an increase in the use of regional design-led practices
in national indicative planning. Despite this, the interrelations between design and planning
decision making are not well understood, and attempts to involve the expertise and ambition
of designers in planning have had unclear outcomes. This article elaborates on the role and
position of regional design in indicative planning. It is argued that design in this realm resembles
discretionary action, implying that design both influences, and is influenced by, prevailing planning
rationales. An analytical framework is developed on these grounds and applied to a set of regional
design initiatives that evolved in the context of Dutch national plans between 1988 and 2012.
Significantly, the analysis reveals forms of discretional control that shape the creative design
practice, of particular importance being the flexibility of planning guidance and the resulting room
for interpretation. In theoretical terms, the article contributes to the discussion of how design
­ as an explorative search for solutions to problems in a particular spatial context ­ and design
theory can contribute to an understanding of the multiple planning experiments emerging in this
post-regulative era.

Introduction
Dutch national planning is plan led, meaning that the government predefines desirable
spatial outcomes and uses these determinations to take planning decisions. However, to
view Dutch planning as entirely shaped by national plans would neglect the flexibility of
such planning guidance. Plans by the national government usually incorporate outline

planning agendas and principles only. Sub-national governing bodies use the freedom
given: they formulate development proposals that fit the particularities of their territo-
ries, and then present these to the central government, which judges proposals on their
merits. Such `indicative' planning practices, in which decisions are legitimised by nego-
tiated interpretation of planning guidance, have a long tradition in The Netherlands.
Similarly, design ­ as an explorative search for solutions to problems in the built envi-
ronment ­ is an important and stable component of planning in The Netherlands. To
imagine design solutions for particular areas and to use these to influence planning guid-
ance is a long-standing practice, which can be traced back to the emergence of urban
planning in the early 20th century, with Van Eesteren as its most important founding
father (for his reflection on design and planning, see Van Eesteren, 1948). Design prac-
tice is positively associated with both innovation in, and operationalisation of, national
planning. Since the 1980s, in the context of decentralisation and deregulation, design has
also come to be seen as a practice that contributes to the formation of governance around
projects and strategies, as well as tempering any conflicting political and territorial inter-
ests that arise. However, the position and role of design in indicative planning are not
well understood. As a result, attempts to involve the professional expertise and value
schemes of designers in planning decision making continue to have unclear outcomes.
This article discusses the interrelations between design and planning. It is argued that
design, when used in the realm of indicative planning, aims to improve planning guid-
ance by assessing its implications for particular situations. In this way, design practice
resembles discretionary action ­ an attempt to look beyond generally applicable rules
when making decisions. This preposition implies that design is an integral part of plan-
ning, a practice that informs and is informed by prevailing planning rationales. The
dialectic is developed against a background of literature on design, spatial planning,
spatial representation and spatial concepts. The result of theoretical reflection is an
analytical framework to distinguish design practices by their discretional agency. The
framework enables us to identify if practices are intended to refine or challenge plan-
ning guidance. It also reveals forms of discretional control. In particular, it highlights
how, in the context of collaborative planning decision making, the flexibility of plan-
ning guidance and the resulting room for interpretation are important determinants in
the role of creative design practice.
The article is structured in four main sections. In the first section, the analytical frame-
work to interpret relations between regional design practices and planning is developed.
In the second, this framework is applied to four well-known regional design initiatives
that evolved in the context of consecutive Dutch national plans since the mid-1980s. The
analysis reveals that flexibility in Dutch national plans reduced over this period. It is
shown that, in this context of diminishing room for interpretation, the role of design in the
making of planning decisions changed: initially, it was a practice that criticised national
plans from an extra-governmental perspective; it then worked to collaboratively define
national planning with various levels of government, and then further transformed into a
practice that challenged national plans on behalf of the national government. Design
shifted from a practice operating on its own initiative, with the attention of a broad audi-
ence, into a procedure made mandatory by the national government, who acted as both a
sole initiator and a sole audience of designs. In the third section, observations from this
334 Planning Theory 17(3)
analysis are summarised, and the institutionalisation of regional design in Dutch planning
is critically reviewed. The fourth, concluding part of the article, discusses the theoretical
foundation of the analytical framework and further questions it raises.
In theoretical terms, the analytical framework and article are based on a combination
of planning and design theory, thus enhancing understanding between fields (for a lack
of such understanding, see Gunder, 2011). Its planning-theoretical ambition is to contrib-
ute to an increased understanding of planning in a post-regulative era. Observation indi-
cates that planning in the context of flexible planning guidance enhances attention to
particular spatial contexts (Allmendinger et al., 2015; Brenner et al., 2011). Such a con-
sideration of material settings and practices ­ the built environment and the way it is used
­ is central to design. Against this background, the article emphasises the capacity of
design theory to contribute to an understanding of variations in regional planning and
governance, under differing institutional circumstances (Mayntz, 2001).
Understanding regional design in the context of planning:
an analytical framework
The use of spatial representations in regional design
Few scholarly writings are dedicated to regional design, and many of these build upon
the seminal work of a small number of authors from the fields of architecture and urban
design (Hillier and Leaman, 1974; Rittel, 1987; Schön, 1983, 1988). These authors
describe design as a reflective and argumentative practice, oriented towards the improve-
ment of the built environment. Design has a holistic orientation also. It is an attempt at a
comprehensive understanding of spatial development, a search for integral solutions that
consider dependencies among parts. Since the built environment is a complex system,
the act of designing is unlikely to evolve in a linear manner from problem definition to
solution. It is more likely to be explorative, evolving during multiple synthesis-evalua-
tion iterations and steps in which problems and solutions are explicated, comprehended,
reflected upon and adapted.
However complex, the built environment itself plays an important role in design.
Design theorists argue that `design is a relatively simple set of operations carried out on
highly complex structures, which are themselves simplified by socially constructed "the-
ories" and modes of representation' (Hillier and Leaman, 1974: 4). Schön (1988) sug-
gests that design evolves in a `design world' ­ a designer's subjective perception of
material settings. A designer simplifies his or her perception of these settings into types
or `generative abstractions' (p. 183). When considering possible design solutions, these
abstractions lead to the recognition of matches and mismatches: the designer learns how
well certain solutions fit particular settings. In this way, design may be both a process of
elaboration and a process of discovery. Imagined solutions may lead to a refinement of
types, a more detailed account of material settings. They may also help the designer to
reveal new aspects of the built environment and define new types (Schön, 1988). From
the testing of solutions against types, rules are deducted: `As rules of law are derived
from judicial precedents, [...], so design rules are derived from types, and may be sub-
jected to test and criticism by reference to them' (Schön, 1988: 183).
Balz 335
Images of the built environment are a central media in design (Rittel, 1987). Maps,
diagrams and models facilitate the `conversation with the situation' that constitutes design
(Schön, 1985: 49). Specifically in the spatial planning literature, the use of geographic
imagery has also gained attention. Such imagery is frequently related to subjective percep-
tions of material settings and practices used in decision making (e.g. Dühr, 2004; Faludi,
1996; Neuman, 1996; Thierstein and Förster, 2008; Van Duinen, 2004). Images are seen to
be socially constructed, relative expressions of what different actors find important and
what they are willing to neglect (Davoudi and Strange, 2008). When associated with inter-
pretative planning, visualisations turn into spatial representations (Davoudi, 2011). These
representations have `agency' (Davoudi, 2011: 438), intentionally generating meaning by
drawing on repertoires of existing symbols for the purpose of politics and planning.
Writings on the utilisation of such spatial representations in planning processes distin-
guish three main logics that span multiple disciplines, notably an analytical, normative and
organisational logic (Dühr, 2004; Förster, 2009; Van Duinen, 2004). When representations
have an analytical logic, they are associated with (invariable) scientific knowledge about
material spatial settings and practices. The normative logic of representations evolves
against the background of political values and norms, wherein representations portray desir-
able planning outcomes. Such representations are often seen to be persuasive ­ to advocate
future development and also to promote appropriate planning action in light of this ­ hence
the focus of much (academic) attention to visions in spatial planning (e.g. Albrechts et al.,
2003). However, when distinguishing know-why (the values and norms that motivate plan-
ning) and know-how (the action derived from such motivation), the organisational logic of
spatial representations appears. Here, a representation shows a territory, it `relates to a con-
cern with regional impacts and incidences of policies and the question of how specific local
and regional entities (territories) are affected by those policies'(Schön, 2005: 391).
In this way, regional design can be seen to expose analytical knowledge, normative
convictions and territorial interests when developing solutions for the built environment.
A design proposal may be utilised for a single purpose, or may also assemble notions and
compose a more intricate story line about what, why and how to intervene. Van Dijk
(2011), who theorised regional design as a form of storytelling, notes that regional design
`deserves to be seen as an attempt to prepare the regional perceptual foundations of even-
tual decisions, and be applied as such' (p. 141). However, this does not evolve without
context. In the few scholarly writings on regional design, there is agreement that it is
often a collaborative and interactive practice, involving a broad array of planning actors
(De Jonge, 2009; Kempenaar et al., 2016; Van Dijk, 2011). In such an `arena of struggle'
(Faludi and Korthals Altes, 1994: 405), it is likely that design proposals produce matches
and mismatches not only in the mind of the individual designer but also with `pre-exist-
ing stories' (Faludi and Korthals Altes, 1994) ­ institutionalised perceptions of geogra-
phies that stabilise prevailing planning practices (see also Brenner et al., 2011, on the
reflexivity of assemblage urbanism).
Design in the context of spatial concepts
It is common to describe spatial planning as a strategic planning approach that pays more
attention to the particularities of the built environment than statutory planning does
336 Planning Theory 17(3)
(Albrechts et al., 2003; Allmendinger and Haughton, 2010; Healey, 2006; Nadin, 2007;
Needham, 1988; Schön, 2005). Its objective, `to articulate a more coherent spatial logic
for land use regulation, resource protection, and investments in regeneration and infra-
structure' (Albrechts et al., 2003: 113), has generated a considerable body of literature on
`spatial concepts' ­ the `pre-existing stories' and institutionalised geographies mentioned
above. Faludi (1987) and Needham (1988), theorising the emergence of spatial planning
in The Netherlands, argued early on that a form of planning that allocates planning
resources to some areas while others are omitted requires a shared understanding of spa-
tial development. They saw explicit (and negotiable) relations between what they called a
`spatial order' (autonomous spatial development, motivated by social action) and `spatial
ordering' (intervening in spatial development) as a precondition for any approach to stra-
tegic spatial planning. Empirical analysis verified their argument. It was shown that Dutch
national planning in particular relied on a generic spatial logic, a `planning doctrine', that
was repeatedly used to justify more detailed operational decisions (Faludi and Van Der
Valk, 1994; Roodbol-Mekkes et al., 2012). Investigations into Dutch `planning concepts'
(Van Duinen, 2004; Zonneveld, 1991) brought similar patterns to the fore. They also indi-
cated that operational planning relies on a set of relatively stable spatial concepts: core
guiding principles and related core planning tasks, articulating presumptive planning
rationales, which are explored when they are applied to more specific situations.
Such spatial concepts in planning have a well-established importance in The
Netherlands (for more recent writing, see, for example, Hagens, 2010; Van Duinen,
2015; Westerink et al., 2013) and are also recognised elsewhere (Davoudi, 2003; Graham
and Healey, 1999; Richardson and Jensen, 2003). Investigations into the use of relational
geographies in collaborative planning contributed to a growing recognition that percep-
tions of space and place are selectively used by governments `with the ambition of accu-
mulating sufficient allocative, authoritative and imaginative force to shape both the
materialities and identities of particular places' (Healey, 2006: 527). A critical review of
these geographies has shown that such concepts are used to perpetuate prevailing plan-
ning regimes and the political interests behind these (e.g. Brenner, 1999; Jessop, 2012;
Massey, 2011). In governance theory, certain perceptions of space (and time) are associ-
ated with institutions. They are used in order to
[...] stabilise the cognitive and normative expectations of [...] actors by shaping and promoting
a common worldview as well as developing adequate solutions to sequencing problems, that
is, the predictable ordering of various actions, policies, or processes over time [...]. (Jessop,
2001: 1230)
Davoudi (2003) observed the use of the polycentrism concept, which had become
widespread currency in European spatial planning by the mid-1990s. She noted that the
concept had several dimensions. This can be generalised to spatial concepts as a whole:
the analytical dimension provides knowledge on how unplanned individual action affects
spatial development; from the normative dimension, a concept is a metaphor for desira-
ble spatial structures and also includes a guiding principle to achieve a policy goal; the
final, organisational dimension of concepts reflects prevailing territorial control.
Davoudi (2003) showed how the concept of polycentrism was transformed from a
Balz 337
descriptive and analytical tool to a widespread prescriptive and normative agenda. As it
was applied to a multitude of situations in European Union (EU) member states, it turned
into an `ideal type', `despite a lack of common definition and empirical evidence about
its desirability, effectiveness, or the potential for its alleged success being replicated
elsewhere by policy intervention' (Davoudi, 2003: 996). The concept continued to be
used, not as a deterministic rationale but as a collection of notions from which planners
derived logics that fitted the spatial particularities of situations and arguably also their
political preferences and territorial interests.
From these notions, a model of an interplay between regional design and spatial
concepts (as key elements of planning guidance) appears. Design solutions for particu-
lar regions are framed by an institutionalised repertoire of notions from which decisions
about what, why and how to plan are derived. Design may be a form of analytical rea-
soning (referring to the analytical foundation of concepts), a form of political action
(referring to a normative planning agenda) or a form of organisational reasoning (refer-
ring to prevailing territorial control) (see Figure 1(a) below). As highlighted earlier,
design theorists argue that design ­ the testing of solutions against simplified abstrac-
tions of the built environment ­ may be a process of elaboration or of discovery. When
assuming that design evolves in the framework of spatial concepts, it may be used to
refine these: deducing solutions from a given choice, an institutionalised repertoire of
meanings (see Figure 1(b) below). Conversely, a hypothetical or imagined solution may
help the designer to uncover new aspects of the built environment. It may be inductive,
being used to challenge or enrich prevailing spatial concepts and the array of rationales
that these incorporate (see Figure 1(c) below).
Positioning design in the realm of planning
The notions above differentiate regional designs by their relation to the spatial concepts
used to stabilise and perpetuate prevailing planning guidance. The study of spatial con-
cepts in planning is not an easy task to accomplish. As Davoudi (2003) has shown, con-
cepts change while being used for the planning of particular areas. In this sense, it is
difficult to distinguish concepts from their interpretation. The use of concepts also varies
according to regional planning regimes and cultures in countries (Nadin and Stead, 2008).
In some European countries, regional planning relies on narrowly defined statutory plan-
ning guidance. In many countries, regional planning evolves in a `gap' (Allmendinger
et al., 2015: 1), an `institutional void'where `there are no clear rules and norms according
to which politics is to be conducted and policy measures are to be agreed upon' (Hajer,
2003: 175). Concepts, in the context of `gaps'and `voids', rely not on a select and detailed
empirical evidence base but on a fuzzy landscape of theories (Davoudi, 2006; Markusen,
1999). They incorporate not specific operational goals but vaguely defined political agen-
das. Spatial concepts then do not encompass specific policies, projected upon clearly
defined administrative territories by governmental authorities who hold the sole power for
planning, but general measures, projected upon softly defined regions by governance
arrangements who (often temporarily) share such planning power. When concepts are
seen to frame decision making, the degree of flexibility opens up room for interpretation.
Despite being difficult to trace, such room for interpretation is decisive for the position of
338 Planning Theory 17(3)

regional design in the realm of planning. What (Rittel, 1987) calls `the awesome epistemic
freedom' in design is built into a planning system.
In his reflection on a designer's way of reasoning, Rittel (1987) notes that design solu-
tions are derived from argumentation, but that such argument is always incomplete. The
built environment is composed of multiple dependent parts. During the design process, a
designer continuously chooses to focus on some dependencies, taking a distinct path in
reasoning while leaving others unexplored. His or her choices are based on arguments
but are not derived from them: `Looking at the various pros and cons, the designer has
"made up his mind." How this happens is beyond reasoning' (Rittel, 1987: 5). Multiple
choices constitute `epistemic freedom' on which design thrives (Rittel, 1987). They turn
design not only into a creative practice but also into a practice of doubt, wherein the
designer pragmatically searches for acknowledged constraints that limit choices and
releases him or her from responsibility:
What the designer knows, believes, fears, desires enters his reasoning at every step of the
process, affects his use of epistemic freedom. He will ­ of course ­ commit himself to those
positions which matches his beliefs, convictions, preferences, and values, unless he is persuaded
or convinced by someone else or his own insight. (p. 6)
These notions imply that being given room for interpretation informs not only the
nature of argumentation in design but also its collaborative rationality (Graham and
Healey, 1999; Healey, 1999, 2006). Design then is an elaboration of multiple beliefs,
convictions, preferences and values that actors pursue. Giving broad room for interpreta-
tion entails that design is a collaborative search for planning solutions by means of nego-
tiation on convictions (although with the risk of overly pragmatic behaviour). Narrow
room for interpretation entails that design and planning decision making evolves through
confrontation (at the risk of conflict).
Summary: design as discretionary behaviour
In Figure 2(a), the `room for interpretation' within which design may evolve is defined
by the multiplicity of choices that prevailing planning guidance incorporates. The room
for interpretation ­ likewise a `field of choice' (Faludi and Korthals Altes, 1994; Friend
and Jessop, 2013), `a field of argument'(Dryzek, 1993; Fischer, 2007) or `a field of posi-
tions' (Rittel, 1987) ­ has been extensively discussed in planning and design theory. The
most detailed notions of how such choices influence the making of planning decisions
stem from the field of planning law and discretion. Discretion is a form of decision mak-
ing concerned with `making choices between courses of action' (Booth, 2007: 131).
What distinguishes discretion from other forms of decision making is the importance of
rules therein. Discretionary action aims to bend rules; it is a search for `leeway in the
interpretation of fact and the application of precedent to particular cases' (Booth, 2007:
129). In normative terms, discretion is associated with an improvement of rules through
a judgement of their implications for particular situations.
The degree of flexibility or ambiguity within rules is seen to be decisive for the
way that discretion is exercised. Discretionary action in the context of imperative

Balz 341
instructions, select and detailed rules, is likely to be inductive ­ it challenges rules
by alternative reasoning. In the context of flexible guidelines, multiple and ambigu-
ous rules that allow for multiple interpretations, discretion is practiced in the form of
policy argumentation (Tewdwr-Jones, 1999: 245) ­ a consideration of multiple `other
schemes of values' to legitimise decisions, as Booth (2007: 136) notes. It is deduc-
tive meant to refine rules. The selection and degree of detail within rules inform the
nature of decision making. They also inform constellations among actors. Imperative
instructions are likely to have a clearly identifiable author and `court of appeal'
which exercises discretionary control in case of discretionary action by others.
Flexible guidelines imply a collaborative rationality. They are not only inclusive but
also result in unclear arrangements of who exercises discretionary action and who
exercises discretionary control.
The amount of room for interpretation is central to how design practices are embed-
ded in planning (see Figure 2(b)). It defines if design is meant to be a practice that assists
in the collaborative production of planning spaces, is deducted from an outline agree-
ment on planning agendas and principles, is at the risk of overly pragmatic behaviour or
is challenging planning from the outside at the risk of conflict. Several questions arise
regarding the flexibility of planning guidance, the relationship between design practices
and this guidance, and actors involved. Below, these questions are further defined and
used to discuss a series of exemplary regional design initiatives that evolved in the con-
text of Dutch indicative planning between the late 1980s and the 2010s, a period when
the flexibility of national planning guidance fluctuated widely under the influence of
deregulation and decentralisation.
Exemplary Dutch regional design initiatives
Above, an analytical framework to differentiate regional design practices by their rela-
tion to planning guidance was introduced. The framework raises three questions con-
cerning the role and position of regional design in the realm of indicative planning:
what is the flexibility of planning guidance? Are design proposals meant to challenge
or refine guidance? Who are the authors and audiences of design? Below, the frame-
work is used for an analysis of exemplary regional design initiatives that evolved under
the influence of four consecutive national planning frameworks published in 1988 (as
a backdrop for analysis), 2002, 2004 and 2012. The four planning frameworks are
briefly analysed to identify the spatial concepts they incorporated. From an analysis of
their dimensions, the degree of room for interpretation is deduced. Regional design
initiatives that emerged in the context of these frameworks are examined for their ref-
erences to the identified spatial concepts, as well as the way that these references have
been combined for the purpose of discretion.
The analysis of the flexibility of planning guidance is based on a review of publicly
available policy documents, most importantly the national plans themselves. Plans
include maps which set out planning principles in overview. Spatial concepts mentioned
in the key of these maps were selected by their concern about urbanisation. They pro-
vided the basis for a system of coding used for in-depth documentary analysis. Text and
additional maps in reports and secondary policy documents (referred to in core
342 Planning Theory 17(3)
documents) were reviewed for their analytical knowledge, normative goals and policy
measures associated with concepts. Changes in the flexibility of planning guidance were
deduced from the amount and relative degree of detail in evidence, goals and policy
measures given in plans. Findings were supported through a review of academic litera-
ture on Dutch indicative planning, spatial concepts and governance over time. The choice
of regional design examples was guided by the prominence that practices gained in
Dutch professional discourse on the role of regional design in national planning. The
analysis of regional design initiatives is based on various written and drawn material,
including regional design products (maps and other visualisations). This material was
reviewed for references to spatial concepts, analytical knowledge, normative goals and
organisational implications. In addition, authors (involved in design initiatives and/or the
making of design proposals) and audiences (who commissioned designs and/or to whom
designs were presented) were identified. Results on the discretionary agency of design
practices were supported by a review of professional and academic writing on the par-
ticular design initiatives.
Episode 1: designerly critique on national policies
The most well-known Dutch spatial concept is the Rim City (Randstad), invented during
the building of the Dutch welfare state in the 1950s. In its original form and in conjunc-
tion with its counterpart, the Green Heart (Groene Hart), the Randstad was considered to
have a distinction between rural and urbanised areas, resulting in a vision for a just and
healthy distribution of land uses across such zones, forming territories to which restric-
tions and regulations applied. The `urban-rural dichotomy' (Van Duinen, 2004: 49)
behind the concept remained a dominant planning rationale for decades (Faludi and Van
Der Valk, 1994; Roodbol-Mekkes et al., 2012). However, in the 1980s, in anticipation of
European integration, new spatial concepts emerged in the realm of Dutch national plan-
ning. In their analytical dimension, these concepts relied on observations of regionalisa-
tion and theories of functional relations from the field of economic geography. In their
normative dimension, they referred to economic competitiveness. In their organisational
dimension, they sketched the first contours of a new way of planning, favouring invest-
ment into strategic development over designation and containment by means of land-use
regulation (Hajer and Zonneveld, 2000).
The Fourth Report on Planning, published in 1988 (Ministerie van Volkshuisvesting
Ruimtelijke Ordening en Milieubeheer (VROM), 1988) was the first national planning
framework that reflected these new rationales (Lambregts and Zonneveld, 2004;
Zonneveld, 1991), albeit in a careful manner. The report used both old and new spatial
concepts, neatly set apart in two groups: a `spatial main structure'(ruimtelijke hoofstruc-
tuur), reiterating the principles of land-use regulation and a `spatial development per-
spective' (ruimtelijke ontwikkelingsperspectief), introducing new principles of strategic
spatial planning. The report received criticism nevertheless, particularly from lower lev-
els of government. Provincial and municipal governments accepted the new analytical
knowledge and agenda but were highly critical of the organisational implications that
were deduced from these. Increasingly imperative regulation and the selection of a few
projects of national importance were seen to be overly rigid and arbitrary choices in the
Balz 343
context of an increasingly broader selection of planning rationales. Sub-national govern-
ments also criticised the national government for the overly paternalistic role it took in
the late 1980s. The fact that these policies were promoted informally within national
governmental departments and by new actors with unclear positions in the political
structure only accelerated criticism (Hajer and Zonneveld, 2000).
In the mid-1980s, several regional design initiatives expressed similar worries. A
prominent one among these was called The Netherlands Now As Design (Nederland Nu
Als Ontwerp (NNAO)). It was initiated by a handful of individuals, among them planners
and designers. Its purpose was to produce a public exhibition on Dutch urban and
regional design to be held in 1987 (for a summary, see Van Der Cammen, 1987). To pre-
pare this exhibition, an elaborate, 3-year long design process was conducted. Overarching
societal trends were taken from analysis by the Scientific Council for Government Policy
(NSCGP), and their spatial impact was imagined in the form of four alternative futures
for The Netherlands. Projections were evaluated for their impact on ecology, energy sup-
ply, housing and labour markets. What they would mean for the development of four
typical Dutch regions, with different degrees of urbanisation, was imagined, and typical
measures to address development were illustrated in more detail. Designs were to `revi-
talise the political debate'on planning, as Frieling (2006: 10), a prominent member of the
NNAO initiative, noted in retrospect (see also Salewski, 2012). They demonstrated that
spatial patterns, deducted from different societal trends, can be desirable to variable
extents, depending on differing political stances, and that the appropriateness of planning
measures varies accordingly. In this way, they illustrated publicly that deciding on meas-
ures is not just an administrative task, accomplished inside the government, but a politi-
cal practice of public importance as well.
The NNAO initiative evolved in an extra-governmental domain, as did other design
initiatives at the time. Initiatives were instigated by individual professionals, with sup-
port from their professional institutes and a few governmental policy institutes. They
were meant to reiterate the important role that the design profession traditionally played
in Dutch planning. To design was seen as an indispensable way to bring emerging spatial
development to the foreground and debate planning decisions on these grounds. Design
practices were a form of quality control for national planning guidance, evaluating it
from the outside. This function changed in the period after, when decentralisation became
an important issue in Dutch national planning and sub-national governments became
involved in regional design.
Episode 2: designing national planning by local governments
The rigidity of territorial control in the Fourth Report on Planning caused worries not
only among professionals and sub-national governments. From the mid-1990s onwards,
the national government itself started to raise concerns. In 1998, the NSCGP summarised
these accumulated concerns. Reflecting on the possibility of a new Fifth Report on
Planning, it identified a fundamental mismatch between an analytical understanding of
spatial development patterns, normative planning agendas and operational policies. It
concluded with an influential call for the modernisation of decision-making structures
through more open planning protocols and new spatial concepts:
344 Planning Theory 17(3)
The basic principles of spatial planning and the way in which these have been elaborated into
practical concepts face radical problems [...]. In the Council's view, the challenges being posed
for the deliberation structure require the latter to be reviewed. (Netherlands Scientific Council
for Government Policy (NSCGP), 1999: 74)
Collaboration among levels of government became an important issue. New `argu-
mentative' concepts that could simultaneously guide and enhance involvement in plan-
ning were asked for (NSCGP, 1999: 80). However, exactly how such collaborative
spatial concepts should look remained unclear for the time being.
A famous Dutch regional design initiative took shape during this period of debate.
The initiative was rooted in the work of a group of professors in planning and urban
design at several Dutch universities. Starting in 1996, under the header `The Metropolitan
Debate' (Het Metropolitane Debat (HMD)), these experts engaged in reflection on
regionalisation in The Netherlands, with specific attention to the Randstad region. An
elaborate design process, conducted by students, researchers and professional designers,
imagined alternative futures for this region. During public debate on these proposals, the
`urban-rural dichotomy' behind the old Randstad concept was publicly dismantled. Its
empirical foundation was critiqued, for example, on its ignorance of uncontrolled sprawl
in the Green Heart and its neglect of the delta landscape structure, interwoven with both
urban and rural land. Observations of emerging regional development patterns were used
to stress the embeddedness of the region in European and international networks as well
as a need for regionally coordinated planning in such a context.
The products of the HMD design exercise were a range of critical readings of the clas-
sic Randstad concept. One of these framed the Randstad as a Delta Metropolis
(Deltametropool), envisaging partnerships among municipalities in the region (for
reviews of this process, see, for example, Lambregts and Zonneveld, 2004; Salet, 2006;
Van Duinen, 2015). In the mid-1990s, such a coalition ­ among politicians from the four
large Randstad municipalities ­ was already in existence in response to a perceived lack
of attention from national planning to the persistent economic underperformance of these
municipalities. They took up the Delta Metropolis design and brought it to the national
government. With these local governments associated with the design, it evolved from a
critique of the analytical and normative foundation of the Randstad concept into a pro-
posal for the organisation of planning in the region. The design circumscribed a territory
to be managed by the group of local governments who had volunteered to coordinate the
planning of the region on behalf of the national government.
In 2002, an initial version of the Fifth Report on Planning became available (VROM
and Rijksplanologische Dienst, 2002). This report, which remained a draft due to politi-
cal turmoil, was the first Dutch national report to explicitly foster decentralisation
(VROM and Rijksplanologische Dienst, 2002: 260). Concepts favouring land-use regu-
lation and investment into strategic development were both sustained, as in the Fourth
Report. However, in contrast to the Fourth Report, the organisational dimension of spa-
tial concepts became open to interpretation. In particular, `urban networks' (stedelijke
netwerken) figured prominently as a concept to facilitate decentralisation. A landscape of
information was associated with the concept, concerning functional relations within and
among regions, accessibility and diversity of social and economic activities for instance.
Balz 345
An array of goals was also attached to it, most importantly those of international eco-
nomic competitiveness and vitality, a social norm. In its organisational dimension, the
concept was a request for active engagement of sub-national governments in national
planning. Emerging regional governance arrangements were given the benefit of the
doubt. The national government hoped that they would have the ability to autonomously
and effectively act on the particular problems in their regions.
The Delta Metropolis initiative was taken up in the report as one such `urban net-
work', and inspired a period of optimism among Dutch regional planners and designers.
It became not only a planning but also a design precedent. Advocates of the Delta
Metropolis had promoted their ideas not only in professional and academic circles but
also in the hallways of public offices and on political podia (Van Duinen, 2004, 2015).
The act of designing came to be seen as a way to clarify political options and forge gov-
ernance alliances around design proposals. Design practices that resembled the Delta
Metropolis in their composition of participants emerged. Designers, groups of experts,
planners and politicians engaged in collaboratively exploring problems within their
regions and presented solutions to the national government. The `urban network'concept
was a near to empty canvas. The broad analytical notions on regional spatial develop-
ment, the many values and norms and the open call for involvement of sub-national
governments in national planning, turned nearly any design proposal by sub-national
governments into a refinement of the national planning guidance.
Episode 3: designing national planning on behalf of the national
government
The Fifth Report was a highly flexible planning framework. The room given for interpre-
tation was deliberately broadened to encourage the voluntary involvement of sub-
national governments in national planning. The following national report, the so-called
Spatial Strategy (Nota Ruimte), first published in 2004, restricted this flexibility again
(VROM et al., 2004).
The Spatial Strategy was a revision of the Fifth Report but incorporated new spatial
concepts nonetheless. To align national policies across various sectors, it was preceded by
several policy documents in which the ministries of economic affairs (EZ) and transport
(V&W) set out their ideas about spatial organisation. The final strategy included these
ideas in the form of new (and revived) spatial concepts. The `urban network' concept, the
central entry of the ministry of housing, spatial planning and the environment (VROM) in
the Fifth Report, came to lie next to `economic core areas', `main transport axis', `main
ports', `brain ports'and `green ports', promoted by a coalition among the ministries of EZ
and V&W. As the names already suggest, these new concepts relied strongly on theories
from the field of economic geography and emphasised economic competitiveness.
Taken together, the preexisting and new spatial concepts created a landscape of multi-
ple planning rationales, seemingly broadening the flexibility of national planning guid-
ance. This impression was deceptive though, since concepts were re-ordered and
selectively refined in terms of their organisational implications. The new concepts by the
ministries of EZ and V&W were immediately associated with direct investment into
national projects. Only the `urban network'concept, the contribution from the ministry of
346 Planning Theory 17(3)
VROM, remained associated with negotiation and collaboration among governments at
different levels. Furthermore, only five out of the 17 `urban networks' in the Fifth Report
were continued. Collaboration was refined by a prescription of policies for sub-national
governments to work with. Among these policies, the possible provision of funding for
infrastructure projects became the most important incentive for collaboration. In addition,
the national government started to regulate decision-making processes in the soft `urban
network'territories. Provinces were to take a leading role in regional governance arrange-
ments, for instance. As another example, specific analytical knowledge about regional
spatial development (e.g. insights into regional accessibility generated by a national sur-
vey) was to be considered when formulating potential projects of national importance.
A regional design initiative that emerged in the context of the Spatial Strategy was
Studio South Wing (Atelier Zuidvleugel). The studio was concerned with the southern part
of the Randstad region, the so-called South Wing (Zuidvleugel), as one of the core eco-
nomic areas that the Spatial Strategy identified. The studio was initiated by the province of
South Holland in 2002 but only took up work in 2005: the scope of the studio was exten-
sively discussed among governments in the region which caused delay. Eventually, a range
of partners from municipal and city regional authorities participated. The long negotiations
on the scope of the studio led to a brief being given to it. Designs were to investigate the
usefulness of the `network city'concept, exploring the region by means of the ­ admittedly
vague ­ theories and values it incorporated.Attention was focused on managerial concerns.
The many existing local plans in the region were to receive specific attention: design was
to deliver insights into how these plans might obstruct or catalyse the emergence of a `net-
work city' and produce comprehensive regional strategies that integrated these insights.
During the 2-year existence of the studio, a set of such strategies were designed, for exam-
ple, for integrated public transport and land use, and for integrated urban and rural develop-
ment (for a review, see Atelier Zuidvleugel, 2008; Balz and Zonneveld, 2015). Projects
were presented to the national government that was also a member of the advisory board.
In the composition of participants, Studio South Wing resembled earlier initiatives
that had emerged around the year 2000, such as Delta Metropolis and its successors.
However, in other aspects it differed. The national government took a more important
role therein as both author and audience. It was part of the advisory board of the studio,
as mentioned above. It also provided funding and important knowledge and expertise.
While earlier initiatives emerged around distinct problems in regions, this studio was in
search of such problems. An exploration of the region through the lens of the `urban
networks' concept was to provide `insights into nodes, crucial relations or indispensable
switches, where missing projects undermine a cohesive overall structure for the purpose
of optimal provincial governing' (Provincie Zuid-Holland, 2004: 2, my translation). It
was also to define projects of national importance. In light of the refinement of national
planning guidance, design became above all a claim for national funding.
Episode 4: designing national projects on behalf of the national
government
In July 2008, a new Dutch planning act became effective and obliged government at all
levels to formulate new planning guidance that complied with the procedural requirements
Balz 347
set out in the act. In 2012, the national government responded to the obligation (with some
delay): the National Policy Strategy for Infrastructure and Spatial Planning became avail-
able, replacing all earlier national frameworks (Ministerie van Infrastructuur en Milieu
(I&M),2012).TheNationalPolicyStrategywasauthoredbyanewministryofInfrastructure
and the Environment (I&M), the product of a fusion of the ministries of VROM and V&W
in 2010. It differed substantially from all previous national plans due to the spatial logics it
used. Only a few planning rationales were extended, retaining economic competitiveness
in a normative sense and the provision of infrastructure projects in an organisational one
(Needham, 2015). A thoroughly evidence-based method to measure accessibility was used
to identify new links in transport networks. Specialised economic activities also remained
important through a concept called `urban regions with top sectors' (Needham, 2015: 28).
Analytically, the concept relied on observed concentrations of specialised economic sec-
tors whose development was to advance the competitive position of The Netherlands inter-
nationally. However, in its organisational dimension, the concept was associated with
largely non-spatial policy measures such as tax incentives.
The National Policy Strategy incorporated few spatial concepts and had little room for
interpretation by sub-national governments. Instead, it consisted of a catalogue of
national projects, most of them concerning investment into infrastructure. A new per-
spective on decentralisation was employed: the new spatial planning act equipped sub-
national governments with more planning power. Regional planning (and the related
decision making) was now to take place at lower levels of government. However, deci-
sion-making procedures for national infrastructure projects required the participation of
government at all levels, and in this way incorporated the seeds for new rounds of nego-
tiations under the roof of the so-called Long-term Investment Programme for Transport
and Spatial Development (MIRT).
The MIRT programme allocates national funds to large-scale infrastructure projects
through highly regulated procedures. Since 2008, projects under this programme have had
to consider not only an improvement of transport but also spatial development. Advice to
the government at the time had indicated that the realisation of projects was being delayed
by conflict between the many affected stakeholders. The advice led to a revision of deci-
sion-making processes. Regional design became a mandatory requirement. It was assumed
that such design practices can, when employed at an early stage of implementation, expli-
cate interdependencies among planning issues at different scales, facilitate discussions
and agreements on these, and in this way help to avoid conflict, delay and costs at later
stages. With the increasing number of national projects included in the National Policy
Strategy, the MIRT programme, and thus also regional design, grew in importance.
The design of Spatial Models SMASH 2040 (Ruimtelijke Modellen SMASH 2040),
conducted in 2012, was associated with this new obligation to employ regional design
(Zandbelt and Van Den Berg, 2012). The acronym SMASH stands for Structural Vision
Main Port Amsterdam Schiphol Haarlemmermeer (Rijksstructuurvisie Mainport
Amsterdam Schiphol Haarlemmermeer), a framework detailing national planning for the
area around Schiphol International Airport, and one of the projects of national impor-
tance identified in the National Policy Strategy. The SMASH design exercise was com-
missioned by the ministry of I&M to investigate (infra)structural change in the area. It
was conducted by an individual urban design professional. During a series of workshops,
348 Planning Theory 17(3)
representatives of sub-national governments in the area, private parties and experts com-
mented on evolving design proposals. There were three alternative futures presented for
the region, reflecting on three predefined main tasks in the area: notably an improvement
of accessibility, the expansion of Schiphol and the satisfaction of housing demands. The
impact of each alternative was illustrated, showing implications for water management
systems, housing and working environments, energy schemes and environmental law.
Designs were to stress test the proposed national infrastructure project. The multiple
interwoven arguments they brought forward can be understood as a critique, challenging
the restricted scope of national planning. However, when compared to earlier regional
design practices, this challenge took place in a highly controlled environment in which
the national government predefined a project, the region that may be affected by it, the
main problems and tasks in implementation, and also both commissioned and judged it.
Discussion
Above, a set of regional design initiatives that evolved under the influence of four con-
secutive Dutch national planning frameworks were analysed using the new analytical
framework. The framework assumes that design in the realm of planning resembles dis-
cretionary action. Such discretionary action aims to improve planning guidance by judg-
ing its implications for particular situations. From this perspective, design is an integral
part of planning, a practice that informs and is informed by prevailing planning ration-
ales.Analysis by means of the framework allows for a detailed account of these interrela-
tions. Figure 3 below presents the results of the analysis in overview.
The first observation drawn from this analysis concerns planning guidance. In the
period between 1988 and 2012, the Dutch national government provided four planning
frameworks. During a seemingly experimental phase, the flexibility of each one differed,
reflecting different ideas about collaboration among levels of government in national
indicative planning. Differences in the degree of room for interpretation were mainly the
result of modifications to the organisational dimension of planning guidance, demon-
strating a pragmatic approach to collaboration. The Fourth Report on Planning (VROM,
1988) contained a broad array of new spatial concepts, but it was the national govern-
ment that decided upon the organisational implications. The Fifth Report on Planning
(VROM and Rijksplanologische Dienst, 2002) broke away from this paternalistic role
for national government, including concepts that were highly open to interpretation in all
their dimensions. To enhance the involvement of local actors, earlier imperative instruc-
tions about `what should be done'turned into broad suggestions for what `could be done'
(in the terminology of Tewdwr-Jones, 1999: 245, that is borrowed from the UK context
here). Later plans, published from the mid-2000s onwards, became more select and
detailed in their prescription of specific policies again. Direct investment into projects of
national importance became a dominant form of planning, as in the National Policy
Strategy of 2012. The few concepts that this plan included were also highly select and
detailed in their analytical and normative dimension. Regional planning and decision
making were largely devolved to lower levels of government.
In the context of diminishing flexibility and diminishing room for interpretation, the
role of regional design in decision making changed. Indeed, it reflected, through its
Balz 349
Figure 3. Interrelations between design initiatives and Dutch national plans over time.
350 Planning Theory 17(3)
discretionary action, shifts in the flexibility of guidance. Author­audience constellations
changed alongside. First, design was a practice that criticised national plans, from an
extra-governmental perspective, for a neglect of the political dimension of planning, as
the example of the NNAO initiative shows. Then, in the context of the highly ambiguous
planning guidance in the Fifth Report, design turned into a practice to collaboratively
refine national planning with various levels of government. This was exemplified by the
Delta Metropolis design initiative. When planning guidance then became oriented
towards projects of national importance, design practices followed, as the South Wing
studio example demonstrates. Finally, in the context of the National Policy Strategy and
the MIRT programme, design became a mandatory requirement in decision making on
national projects. As the SMASH example shows, design became a practice to purpose-
fully challenge these projects. The national government became the commissioner of
such critique as well as its sole receiver. This most recent institutionalisation of regional
design in Dutch national planning does not reflect the distance between authors and audi-
ences, or between discernible actors in action and control, which qualifies discretion.
Conclusion
There is a tradition of using regional design in Dutch indicative planning. Expectations
concerning the impact of design-led approaches on planning decision making were and
are usually high. Design is thought to mobilise thinking capacity; it is seen to be an adven-
turous and inventive endeavour. To reflect on spatial development is to enhance the tech-
nical quality of planning strategies and projects. Since decentralisation and deregulation
became issues in Dutch planning, design is now also expected to perform in political and
organisational settings. It is expected to clarify political options, forge societal alliances,
remove conflict around planning solutions early on and thus speed up implementation.
The analytical model developed here reflects these multiple expectations: design may
challenge or refine planning; it may be oriented towards political values and norms, towards
the analytical foundation of planning and/or towards organisational planning measures in
territories. However, the model implies that the impact of design is not only determined by
the design solutions themselves but also by concurrent planning guidance. The dialectics
between design and guidance suggests that design may be an inherently discretional prac-
tice. When viewing design as a form of discretion, it is the prevailing planning rationales
that define whether an imaginary future is a relevant interpretation of fact or an arbitrary
fantasy; a precedent to be considered in future planning decisions or a negligible incident.
Discretionary approaches within design aim to improve planning guidance by assess-
ing its implications for particular situations. The testing of this preposition has revealed
that there may be strong interrelations between planning and design. In particular, the
flexibility of planning guidance and the resulting room for interpretation are determi-
nants. Giving broad room for interpretation in planning guidance may inspire a collabo-
rative and creative search for problems and innovative planning solutions but at the risk
of a loss of operational planning guidance and overly pragmatic behaviour. Narrow room
for interpretation almost inevitably turns designs into criticism, with the risk of conflict.
As the examples above show, the Dutch national government has sought to resolve this
dilemma by positioning design in a highly controlled organisational environment where
Balz 351
the government itself is a facilitator of design and a court of appeal. However, such insti-
tutionalisation of discretionary practice (a form of meta-governance in fact) raises con-
cerns about its ability to legitimise planning decisions. More broadly, it shows that it is
important to consider the authors and audiences of design as they relate to planning. If
design practices are to be discretionary action, as is the case in Dutch indicative plan-
ning, they must evolve at a distance to the formal planning apparatus.
The analytical model that was used for analysis here is based on a combination of plan-
ning and design theory.Asearch for similarities among theories has resulted in the recogni-
tion that the built environment itself is the most common denominator across fields. The
model recognises that perceptions of geography are composed of analytical knowledge,
normative agendas and notions of territorial control. Spatial concepts that stabilise prevail-
ing or institutionalised planning practices incorporate such perceptions. Design assembles
a selection of notions for a distinct planning purpose in a particular area. Both the use of
concepts and design have agency in constructing perceptions of the built environment. This
notion calls for a more intricate understanding of how perceptions of material settings
transform as they are used ­ how spatial concepts turn into detailed plans and vice versa.
Planning-theoretical reflection has revealed that planning in a post-regulative era, in the
absence of clearly defined planning rules and institutions, pays increased attention to spe-
cific spatial development. Such attention has led authors to distinguish between policy-
making, which concerns the resolution of predefined problems in predefined territories,
and planning as a political practice, which includes the formulation of problems in areas
that are yet to be defined.Analysis here has shown that roles of design practices in planning
decision making vary. Varieties may be the outcome of incidental experiment. However,
observation indicates that they may also be the result of more structural attempts to balance
pragmatic and political planning approaches, which calls for an increased understanding of
the performance of design-led approaches in planning decision making.
