PROBLEMS regarding the mental health of the older
population are becoming increasingly severe. In the
United States, the rate of suicide among individuals aged 65
years and older is higher than that for any other age group,
with men making up 85% of these suicides (Coren &
Hewitt, 1999). Indeed, mental health is closely associated to
the aging process for older adults. Aging has been tied with
loss of sense of control (Mirowsky, 1995) and an increase in
depressive symptoms in late older adulthood (Mirowsky &
Reynolds, 2000). Understanding the factors that influence
the mental health of the aging population is especially im-
portant. One such factor that is highly entangled with men-
tal health is religious participation. Religious life and
participation become increasingly important to Americans
as they age (Dillon & Wink, 2007). The link between reli-
gion and mental health is well established (Ellison & Levin,
1998; Koenig, McCullough, & Larson, 2001). This study
seeks to investigate if and how the relationship between
religious activity and mental health varies by gender.
Studies exploring how gender affects the relationship be-
tween religious activity and mental health are sparse and
inconclusive (Krause, 2008). Similarly, only one study has
investigated this relationship among older adults (Idler,
1987), despite the fact that older Americans are especially
susceptible to losses in mental well-being and represent one
of the fastest growing demographics. The study of religion
and depressive symptoms by Idler (1987) found that public
religiosity was negatively related to depression for both
women and men, but had a stronger impact for women. Al-
though the study by Idler (1987) was the first investigation
into how the effects of religious involvement on depressive
symptoms vary by gender for older Americans, it was not
without limitations. This study used cross-sectional data,
only contained one dimension of mental health, was not
nationally representative, and did not test for nonlinear
effects.
Contemporary perspectives on gender socialization, gen-
der roles, and aging process suggest that religious activity
will have a different impact on mental health for men and
women (Beit-Hallahmi & Argyle, 1997). Accordingly, this
study is based upon the notion that men and women hold
unique social roles that are acquired through the process of
gender socialization. These gender roles place men and
women in very different social contexts within religious
communities and hence the salutary effects of religious in-
volvement may vary by gender. By utilizing longitudinal
nationally representative data, two dimensions of religious
involvement (organizational and nonorganizational religios-
ity), and four dimensions of mental health (depressive symp-
toms, death anxiety, optimism, and self-esteem), this project
aims to answer three question regarding older Americans.
First, does religious activity bolster mental health for women
and men? Second, how does the effect of religious involve-
ment on mental health differ by gender? Finally, are there
nonlinear effects in the relationship between religious
involvement and mental health.
Religion and Mental Health Among Older Adults: Do the
Effects of Religious Involvement Vary by Gender?

Department of Sociology, University of Texas at Austin.
Objectives. Few studies explore how the relationship between religious involvement and mental health varies by gen-
der among the aging population. This article outlines a series of arguments concerning the effects of gender in moderating
the effect of religious involvement on mental health and examines them empirically.
Methods. Using two waves (2001 and 2004) of the Religion, Aging, and Health Survey, this study estimates the dif-
ferential effect of gender in the religion­mental health connection using multivariate analyses for a nationally representa-
tive sample of U.S. adults aged 66­95 years.
Results. Results suggest that (a) men obtain more mental health benefits from religious involvement than women, (b)
women with higher levels of organizational religious involvement have similar levels of mental health as those with
moderate and lower levels of organizational religious involvement, (c) men with very high levels of organizational reli-
gious involvement tend to have much higher levels of mental health than all other men.
Discussion. The relationship between organizational religious involvement and mental health is found to be mostly a
nonlinear one such that those with the highest levels of religiosity receive all the benefits. The findings suggest a number
of promising research directions on the religion­mental health connection among older Americans.

Theoretical Framework
Religion and Mental Health
A large array of research documents the positive effect
religion has on mental health (Ellison & Levin, 1998;
Larson et al., 1992), although some research suggests that
religion can have a deleterious impact on mental health as
well (Krause, 2004; Krause, Ellison, & Wulff, 1998). The
literature proposes several mechanisms in which religious
practices affect mental well-being (Koenig et al., 2001).
Understanding the context in which religious activity af-
fects mental health is crucial in conceptualizing how gender
may moderate this relationship. One mechanism, which is
especially important for this study, that affects mental health
is social integration and support.
Through the sharing of religious belief and practices,
congregants often achieve a high level of social integration.
Religious involvement may increase social integration and
consequently reduce suicide rates (Colucci & Martin, 2008).
The religious setting provides a context in which offering
and asking for social and emotional support are both en-
couraged. Ferraro and Kelley-Moore (2000) show that indi-
viduals who are the most integrated in a religious community
are likely to seek religious consolation when enduring de-
pressive symptoms. Many religious groups provide formal
programs for members in need (Trinitapoli, 2005). Research
suggests that individuals ask for assistance more frequently
in groups when potential support providers are sure about
each other's obligations (Cutrona, Suhr, & MacFarlane,
1990). Attendance at religious services conveys the mes-
sage that other individuals share the same faith, beliefs, and
have a lot in common (Sosis, 2000). Accordingly, one of the
key forms of social support older people gain from religious
participation is perceived emotion support. Krause (2008)
shows that the anticipated level of emotional support one
would receive if they needed it plays a crucial role in the
maintenance of mental health.
The Possibility of Nonlinear Effects
An often-overlooked component in the relationship be-
tween religious activity and mental health is the role of po-
tential nonlinear effects. Previous work finding a linear
effect of religious activity may in fact be masking one of
three theoretically justified nonlinear effects: squared,
threshold, or exponential. The theoretical impetus for ex-
pecting a quadratic relationship can suggest either a "U"
shaped or an inverted "U" shaped relationship between
mental distress and religious involvement. The "U" per-
spective suggests that those with moderate levels of involve-
ment will garner the benefits (e.g., social support) without
extracting the social cost of high levels of involvement. At
least two studies have found this type of nonlinear relation-
ship with self-esteem and depressive symptoms as outcomes
(Krause, 1995; Schnittiker, 2001). The inverted "U" shape
perspective suggests that those who are only marginally
committed to religion will fair worse in mental health out-
comes because of uncertainty compared with those with no
commitment or high levels of commitment. A study of reli-
gious beliefs and psychological distress provides some sup-
port for this perspective (Ross, 1990).
The threshold perspective suggests that only at some
level of religious involvement will the effects begin to man-
ifest. For example, the threshold perspective suggests that
individuals with low or moderate levels of religious involve-
ment may have similar levels of depressive symptoms,
whereas those with high levels of involvement will witness
fewer symptoms of depression. Exponential effects suggest
that the effects of religious involvement will increase with
each increase in involvement but the magnitude of this in-
crease will grow exponentially. Overall, research is incon-
clusive in regards to the nonlinear relationship between
religious involvement and mental health.
Religion, Gender, and Mental Health
Gender socialization suggests that boys are socialized to be
competitive, aggressive, and independent, whereas girls are
taught to be obedient, sociable, and nurturing. Beit-Hallahmi
and Argyle (1997) argue that women are more likely to be
attracted to religion because many of the traits valued in
religion are considered feminine traits, such as obedience
to God and the nurturing of others. Similarly, Miller and
Hoffman (1995) contend that one reason why women are
more religious than men is that religion is essentially risk
averse, which resonates with behaviors associated with fe-
male socialization such as passivity and obedience. Women
may also be more religious because they are more relation-
ally restricted than men, and the religious community offers
a social setting where the formation and maintenance of
personal relationships are encouraged (Idler, 1987). Several
other explanations also exist and are reviewed elsewhere
(see Miller & Stark, 2002). Women tend to have more ex-
tensive social ties and social support systems both within
the church and in secular settings than men (Ajrouch,
Blandon, & Antonucci, 2005; Krause, Ellison, & Marcum,
2002). Although older women are more ubiquitous in
religious settings, a number of studies indicate that they
occupy more subordinate roles in these settings. For exam-
ple, Heyer-Grey (2000) finds that women are less likely
to lead or say prayers during services, assist in communion,
or read from the bible than men. Additionally, women are
more likely than men to clean up after church, work in the
nursery, and to cook and serve meals.
The manner in which gender affects the relationship be-
tween religious activity and mental health is unclear. Two
competing frameworks can be drawn from the concepts of
gender socialization, gender roles, and the aging process to
predict how gender affects this relationship. The first sug-
gests that women, because they develop and maintain more
RELIGION, GENDER, AND MENTAL HEALTH 623
weak and strong ties in church, will benefit more from reli-
gious involvement than men in terms of mental health and
well-being. The second perspective suggests that the reli-
gious world provides a unique context in which men are
encouraged to respond to and ask for (when needed) both
emotional and physical support. Additionally, men may oc-
cupy formal roles in the church that bestow social status and
respect, whereas women may tend to occupy more subordi-
nate roles. The acquirement of social status and respect may
be especially pertinent to retired older men who seek to re-
place the status they once possessed via their careers.
The first framework suggests that women tend to make
larger and stronger interpersonal relationships than men,
and because the church embraces traits associated with
femininity (sociability, communication skills, and nurtur-
ance), women may be able to extract more from their strong
relationships. Women are more likely to maintain weak ties
than men, and this becomes especially pronounced in reli-
gious communities (Scott & Wenger, 1995). Older women
are much more likely to be widowed and single than men
and may seek out kinship in religious communities. Indeed,
older women are more likely to have a church-based com-
panion friendship, to both provide and receive more social
and emotional support and to attend bible or prayer groups
than their male counterparts (Krause, 2008). Bible and
prayer groups provide an avenue for members to share per-
sonal problems and receive sympathy as well as practical
advice (Wuthnow, 1994). Because women comprise the ma-
jority of members of these groups, they may be especially
apt in providing support and advice for issues common
among women. Women tend to be more involved; therefore,
they may also be more likely to hear of and engage in
church-related programs that can lead to better mental
health (e.g., pastoral counseling). Support for this perspec-
tive is found in a study of adults living in Indianapolis show-
ing that religious involvement decreased depressive
symptoms for women but not men (Mirola, 1999).
The contrasting framework suggests that the religious
context provides a unique avenue that encourages men to
ask for help, share feelings and concerns, and engage in be-
haviors that in other social contexts would suggest to others
that they are weak. Because men are socialized to be inde-
pendent and aggressive, they are less likely to develop
strong social ties and interpersonal relationships than
women. One of the pathways in which religion improves
mental health is through social support. Social support is
only effective if it is provided in a manner that makes the
recipient feel comfortable (Eckenrode &Wethington, 1990),
and this is especially the case for men who are socialized to
be independent. The church provides a religious context for
men to receive assistance in a way that is acceptable to them
(Krause et al., 2002). Also, a religious community may pro-
vide men with an environment where they perceive that
emotional support is available to them if they need it. This
perspective suggests that women are likely to have both
secular and church-based support systems, whereas men
tend to rely more exclusively on church-based support. Sup-
port found from religious involvement may be more vital to
the maintenance of mental health for men. Additionally,
men may gain more from involvement because women
maintain such extensive networks that they are actually del-
eterious to their mental health (i.e., the cost of caring). Sup-
port for this perspective was found in a study of Presbyterian
adults exploring how the effect of emotional support on
self-reported health differed by gender. Women tended to
have more emotional support available to them, whereas
men experienced more gains in health from the emotional
support available to them (Krause et al.).
The effects of religious involvement may vary by gender
due to roles men and women occupy within the church and
the social status that those roles confer. Social status tends
to increase physical well-being and self-esteem (Reitzes &
Mutran, 2006) and those with higher levels of social status
tend to deal with stress better than those of a disadvantaged
social status (Kessler, 1979). Many churches emphasize
patriarchal gender roles that are rooted in biblical doctrine
calling for female submission to masculine authority within
social spheres. Men may witness a larger gain in mental
health because they disproportionately occupy more revered
roles that convey social status than women (Heyer-Grey,
2000). Conversely, women tend to occupy more private and
subordinate roles in the church and perform tasks such as
cleaning, cooking, and staffing the nursery.
The religious context may be especially important for
men because of the social relationships they lose from re-
tirement. Also, retired men who have been socialized to be
competitive may have a desire for power. Older men are
more likely than older women to have worked outside the
home during adulthood (Henretta, 2001). The vast majority
of men retire by the age of 65 years and may not be able to
maintain the relationships they developed over the last de-
cade. Women are less likely to have lost close ties among
work-related relationships because the current cohort of
older women was less likely to be employed outside the
home. Men are initially disadvantaged in terms of develop-
ing and maintaining social relationships and tend to lose the
employment-related relationships they have; hence, partici-
pation in a religious community may become their primary
source of socialization and have a stronger effect for men
than women. Also, the self-esteem and sense of control that
came with employment may slowly erode after retirement.
As mentioned earlier, men tend to disproportionately oc-
cupy formal roles in the church that convey social status
within the church. Social status within the church may pro-
vide a compensatory role in the maintenance of mental
well-being. Evidence for this perspective is found among a
study of older adults living in the Raleigh-Durham-Chapel
Hill metro area where religious identity had a greater posi-
tive impact on mental health for those who are retired than
those still employed (Keyes & Reitzes, 2007).

Data and Methods
The data from this study come from the Religion, Ag-
ing, and Health Survey, a nationally representative longi-
tudinal survey. The population of this study was designed
at the baseline interview as White or Black household
residents, noninstitutionalized, English speaking, and at
least 66 years of age. Geographically, the study was lim-
ited to the contiguous United States. The study population
was limited to currently practicing Christians, individuals
who were Christians in the past but no longer practice any
religion, and individuals who were never associated with
any faith.
One thousand five hundred baseline interviews took place
in 2001 and were conducted by Harris Interactive. Older
Blacks were oversampled and represented roughly half the
sample (752 Blacks). The overall response rate for the base-
line interviews was 62%.
The second wave of interviews took place in 2004 where
of the initial 1,500 respondents, 1,024 were reinterviewed
successfully. Among those who were not reinterviewed, 75
refused to participate, 112 could not be located, 70 were too
ill to participate, 11 were currently in nursing homes, and
208 were deceased. The interview rate for the second wave
was 80% when those who died or living in nursing homes
were excluded.
Listwise deletion was used to account for non-item re-
sponses, and the following analyses are based upon between
919 and 801 valid cases. In order to reflect the U.S. demo-
graphic landscape, survey data were weighted to account
for oversampling. Preliminary analyses using weighted data
show that roughly 58% were older women and roughly 42%
were older men. The average age of these individuals was
74.4 years (SD = 6.0 years). Approximately 64% were mar-
ried and roughly 9% were older Blacks and 91% older
Whites. Finally, the average respondent had completed
approximately 12.4 years of schooling (SD = 3.2 years).
Measures
Religiosity.--Table 1 presents the survey items that com-
pose the primary variables used in this study. Previous re-
search documents the lack of multidimensional measures of
both organizational and nonorganizational religiosity in
work on older adults (Krause, 1993). Consequently, this
study will utilize 3-item scales for both organizational and
nonorganizational religiosity. Organizational religiosity
taps the extent to which an individual engages with a public
religious institution. The internal consistency reliability es-
timate for this composite measure is .753. Nonorganizational
religiosity taps the extent to which an individual engages in
private religious practices (i.e., usually at home). This pri-
vate engagement with religion is especially salient for older
Americans, as physical limitations often restrict public reli-
gious practices. The internal consistency reliability estimate
for this measure is .720.
Table 1. Core Study Measures
1. Organizational religiosity (Wave 1 only)a
 A. How often do you attend adult Sunday School or Bible study groups?
 B. How often do you participate in prayer groups that are not part of
 regular worship services or Bible study groups?
 C. How often do you attend religious services?
2. Nonorganizational religiosity (Wave 1 only)a
 A. When you are at home, how often do you read the Bible?
 B. How often do you pray by yourself?
 C. How often do you watch formal church services on TV or listen to
 them on the radio?
3. Depression (Wave 1 and Wave 2)b
 A. I felt I could not shake off the blues even with the help of
 my family and friends.
 B. I felt depressed.
 C. I felt sad.
 D. I did not feel like eating, my appetite was poor.
 E. I felt that everything I did was an effort.
 F. My sleep was restless.
 G. I could not get going.
4. Death anxiety (Wave 1 and Wave 2)c
 A. Thinking about death makes me feel uneasy.
 B. I do not feel prepared to face my own death.
 C. I am disturbed by the shortness of life.
5. Optimism (Wave 1 and Wave 2)c
 A. I always look at the bright side of things.
 B. I'm optimistic about my future.
 C. In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.
6. Self-esteem (Wave 1 and Wave 2)c
 A. I feel I am a person of worth, or at least on an equal plane with others.
 B. I feel I have a number of good qualities.
 C. I take a positive attitude toward myself.
aThese items were scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses):
Never (1), Less than once per year (2), About once or twice per year (3), Several
time per year (4), About once a month (5), 2­3 times per month (6), Nearly
every week (7), Every week (8), Several times per week (9).
bThese items were scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses):
Rarely or none of the time (1), Some or little of the time (2), Occasionally or a
moderate amount of the time (3), Most or all of the time (4).
cThese items were scored in the following manner (coding in parentheses):
Strongly disagree (1), Disagree (2), Agree (3), Strongly agree (4).
The functional forms of the religious involvement­mental
health connection have not been verified; they may be
linear, quadratic, exponential, or observed only at or above
some threshold. Accordingly, organizational and nonorga-
nizational religiosity are defined using three categories
(high, medium, and low) to account for potential nonlinear
relationships. Those with low organizational religiosity tend
to attend church less than once per week and rarely or never
engage in bible or prayer groups. Those with medium val-
ues tend to attend church regularly but do not consistently
engage in bible or prayer groups. Those with high values go
to church regularly and consistently attend bible and prayer
groups. Those with low nonorganizational religiosity tend
to rarely or never read the bible, read religious literature or
watch religious TV, or pray at home. Those with medium
values tend to regularly do one of these things on a regular
basis and occasionally or never do the others. Those with
high levels on nonorganizational religiosity tend to regu-
larly do all three things or do two regularly and the third
occasionally.
RELIGION, GENDER, AND MENTAL HEALTH 625
Depressive symptoms.--Seven indicators were used from
the Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale to
assess depressive symptoms. The reliability estimates for
this measure at Wave 1 is .866. In order to deal with issues
regarding the distribution of this measure (high levels of
kurtosis), the natural log of these variables was used
throughout this study.
Death anxiety.--The three items measuring death anxiety
reflect the extent to which an individual feels anxious or
fearful about death. Higher values reflect higher levels of
anxiety or fear about death. The reliability estimate for this
measure at Wave 1 is .868. Death anxiety represents a di-
mension of mental health that may be most pronounced
among the older population and be intimately tied with
religious beliefs and practices.
Optimism.--Optimism is measured with three indicators.
The reliability estimates for this scale is .782 at Wave 1.
Higher values reflect higher levels of optimism and mental
health.
Self-esteem.--Feelings of self-worth were assessed with
three items.A higher score reflects higher levels of self-esteem.
The reliability estimate for this measure at Wave 1 is .900.
Functional limitations, health, and controls.--Functional
mobility and physical health are closely related to mental
health among older adults; hence, sufficient control variables
measuring functional limitations and health are included in
all multivariate analyses. A scale measuring functional limi-
tations was constructed using 16-items from Wave 2 (this
variable is not available in Wave 1) that asks respondents if
they encounter difficulty when performing activities of daily
living such as walking, dressing, bathing, and so forth. The
reliability estimate for this scale is .885. The self-reported
health variable asked respondents how they would rate their
overall present health. Responses varied by four categories
from 1 (poor) to 4 (excellent). Controls for age, race, educa-
tion, and marital status were also included. Race and marital
status were measured as dummy variables indicating if
the respondent is "Black" or "currently married." Age and
education were measured in years.
Weighted means for all variables (not shown) indicate
that women tend to have higher values of depressive symp-
toms and men tend to have higher values of death anxiety.
Men and women tend to have similar mean values of opti-
mism and self-esteem. Women appear to be more religiously
active than their male counterparts in both organizational
and nonorganizational religiosity. Nearly 20% of women in
the sample have high levels of organizational religious in-
volvement, whereas only 13% of men fall into this category.
Similarly, 32% of women have high levels of nonorganiza-
tional religious activity, whereas only 16% of men fall into
this category.
Results
The purpose of this study is to test if and how the effects
of religiosity on mental health differ for older women and
older men. The mean values of the organizational and non-
organizational variables show that older women are more
religious than older men. In order to test if the impact of re-
ligious involvement is different, all analyses are divided into
two subpopulations: women and men. The analyses pre-
sented here are divided up into two sections. Due to the lon-
gitudinal design and the relatively large number of
respondents who were not reinterviewed at Wave 2, the first
section tests for attrition effects. The second section employs
multivariate longitudinal ordinary least squares regression
models to test how the effect of religiosity varies by gender.
All of the effects found in multivariate models occur across
time controlling for the mental health outcome at Time 1.
The primary aim of this study is to test the claim that
older men obtain more mental health benefits from organi-
zational religious participation than women. Accordingly,
in multivariate analyses, this study implements split-sample
(between men and women) models and tests if the regres-
sion coefficients between models differ statistically. This
study will test for these differential effects using a formula
devised by Clogg, Petkova, and Haritou (1995). This t test is
of the form:
2 2
( ) ( )
[ ( )] [ ( )]
-
=
+
b x b y
t
se x se y
where b(x) and b(y) represent the regression coefficients for
men and women and se(x) and se(y) represent their standard
errors. Significance implies that the effect of religious
activity on mental health differs by gender net of all other
variables in the model.
Attrition Effects
The loss of subjects between Waves 1 and 2 may poten-
tially bias results; hence, analyses that may give insight into
if and how this is occurring are required. These analyses
probe how data from the baseline survey are related to study
participation in Wave 2. The following procedures docu-
ment this strategy: first, a dummy variable indicating miss-
ing status, coded 1 missing and 0 not missing was created;
then, using logistic regression, this binary variable was re-
gressed upon all of the Wave 1 variables mentioned earlier.
If any of the key independent or dependent variables in this
study is significantly related to absence at Wave 2, then this
would suggest that further analyses are likely biased.
Results of these analyses (not shown here) suggest that
participation in Wave 2 was not a random phenomenon.
Nonparticipants at Wave 2 were more likely to be older,
male, unmarried, and have lower levels of educational at-
tainment than those successfully reinterviewed. This pattern
of findings is consistent with prior research on attrition ef-
fects (Groves, 1989). These findings are not surprising as
MCFARLAND
626
the majority of respondents who were not reinterviewed
were either deceased or too sick to participate. Significant
differences in attrition effects failed to emerge for organiza-
tional and nonorganizational religiosity, depressive symp-
toms, death anxiety, optimism, or self-esteem. Ancillary
analyses differentiated nonparticipation by indicating those
who were sick or deceased from those who could not be
interviewed for other reasons. All models were replicated
using a Heckman selection procedure. This differentiation
did not have any substantive impact on the results presented
here. These findings suggest that further analyses in this
study are unlikely to be biased by attrition effects.
Multivariate Analyses
Depressive symptoms.--Models 1 and 3 in Table 2 show
that depressive symptoms at Time 1 are positively related to
depressive symptoms at Time 2 and health is negatively re-
lated to depressive symptoms at Time 2 for both women and
men. For women, being Black is associated with lower lev-
els of depressive symptoms, whereas for men, age is posi-
tively related to depressive symptoms. Models 2 and 4 show
that the negative effect of high organizational religiosity is
significantly different from zero for men but not for women.
The difference in effect size between men and women for
high organizational religiosity is trending toward statistical
significance (t = 1.347, p < .10). Modest levels of organiza-
tional religiosity also decrease symptoms of depression for
men but not for women. These results point toward an expo-
nential relationship between organizational involvement
and depressive symptoms. The difference in effect size is
also nearly significant (t = 1.302, p < .10). These models
find modest support that organizational religiosity is more
important for men than women and strong support that or-
ganizational religiosity shares a nonlinear relationship with
depressive symptoms.
Death anxiety.--Models 5 and 7 in Table 2 show that
death anxiety at Time 1 is positively related to death anxiety
at Time 2 for both women and men. For women, nonorgani-
zational religiosity decreases levels of death anxiety, but
having high levels of organizational religiosity increases
death anxiety. For men, modest amounts of organized reli-
gion are positively related to increased anxiety about death.
This finding among men suggests an inverted "U" shaped
relationship between organizational religiosity and death
anxiety. The size (and sometimes direction) of these effects
is statistically different for men and women. These findings
suggest that religious involvement is highly entangled with
death anxiety and that its effects tend to play out in different
ways for men and women.
Optimism.--Models 1 and 3 in Table 3 show that opti-
mism and health at Wave 1 are positively related to optimism

at Wave 2. Black women tend to report higher levels of opti-
mism than White women, whereas Black men tend to report
lower levels of optimism than White men. Model 4 shows
that high levels of organizational religiosity tend to increase
optimism over time for men. This finding suggests that there
is a threshold effect between organizational involvement and
optimism. The effect for women is not statistically different
from zero. The difference in effect size is statistically sig-
nificant (t = 1.961, p < .05). For women, both high and mod-
est levels of nonorganizational religiosity increase optimism
over time. The organizational aspects of religion are the most
important for men, whereas the nonorganizational aspects
are the most important for women.
Self-esteem.--Model 5 in Table 3 shows that for women,
self-esteem at Wave 1 positively predicts self-esteem at
Wave 2 and functional limitations are negatively related to
self-esteem. For men, none of the predictors in Model 7 are
statistically significant. Models 6 and 8 show that high lev-
els of organizational religiosity are positively associated
with self-esteem for men only. Again, these results suggest
the presence of a threshold effect between organizational
involvement and self-esteem. The difference in effect size
between men and women is statistically significant (t =
2.607, p < .01). This analysis suggests men with high levels
of organizational involvement tend to receive large divi-
dends in the form of positive mental health.
Discussion
Summary
Longitudinal multivariate models show a strong associa-
tion between organizational religiosity and mental health
after controlling for health and demographic factors. For
men, the effects of high organizational religiosity were neg-
atively related to depressive symptoms and positively re-
lated to optimism and self-esteem. These effects were not
statistically different from zero for women. For men, mod-
erate levels of organizational religiosity had a deleterious
effect on death anxiety. For women, both high and moderate
levels of nonorganizational religiosity were related to lower
levels of death anxiety. High levels of organizational religi-
osity had a deleterious effect upon death anxiety for women.
Other than death anxiety, religiosity did not have much of
an effect on mental health outcomes among women.
Table 4 displays the differences in the religiosity regres-
sion coefficients between women and men. This shows
whether the effect of religiosity on each of the four mental
health outcomes varied by gender. The most stark finding is
that the effect of being highly involved in organized religion
is much different for men (usually more beneficial) than
women. Although not as clear, there is also evidence to sug-
gest that the effect of modest organizational religious involve-
ment varies by gender as well. The difference in effect size
between men and women for nonorganizational religiosity is
MCFARLAND
628
statistically different from zero when looking at death anxi-
ety. Overall, these findings provide strong support that reli-
gious involvement has a relationship with mental health that
varies by gender and that men receive more mental health
benefits from organized religious involvement than women.
One of the core arguments of this paper is that men expe-
rience and gain more from church-based social support
when they share similarly high levels of religious involve-
ment as women. This proposition was tested in ancillary
analyses (not shown) using four dimensions of social sup-
port: emotional support received, emotional support pro-
vided, tangible support received, and anticipated support.
This perspective was partially supported as increases in re-
ligious involvement resulted in greater gains in social sup-
port among men, but social support did not diminish the
relationship between high organizational religiosity and
mental health in multivariate models. This lack of findings
in multivariate models does not negate this framework. Pre-
vious literature has shown that social support becomes es-
pecially important in the maintenance of mental health in
the presence of acute and chronic stressors (Krause, 2006).
Including such stressors is outside the scope of the current
study, but their absence may explain why they are seem-
ingly unrelated to mental health.
Conclusions
This study addresses the moderating effect of gender on
the religion and mental health connection among older
adults. Organizational religiosity decreases symptoms of
depression and increases levels of optimism and self-esteem
over time for men but not women. Similarly nonorganiza-
tional religiosity decreased levels of death anxiety over time
for women but not men. These findings are consistent with
the framework that religion provides men a unique context
in which they were able to reap more benefits from religious
activities than women. Organizational religious activity
(i.e., involvement in religious services, bible groups, and
prayer groups) appears to have a more pronounced impact
on mental health for men than women. These findings are
buttressed by the work of Krause and colleagues (2002),
which found that women had more church-based emotional
support than men, but men received a greater benefit from it
in regards to health. Additionally, the results found here
may be due to the cost of caring women pay in maintaining
vast social networks. Research shows that maintaining ex-
tensive social networks may extract a price on mental well-
being (Kessler, Price, & Wortman, 1985). If women tend to
have large social networks outside of the church, then the
networks they have within the church may not yield any
benefits, and could possibly be detrimental, to their mental
well-being.
This study finds that religious involvement has a greater
impact on mental health for men. A number of studies
dealing with adults have found the exact opposite, that or-
ganizational religious activity has a more pronounced ef-
fect on mental health among women. Mirola (1999) found,
in a sample of adults living in Indianapolis, that religious
attendance decreases symptoms of depression for women
but not men. Similarly, in a sample of Mexican-origin
adults, Ellison, Finch, Ryan, and Salinas (2009) found that
organizational religious activity was inversely related to
depressive symptoms for both men and women but the re-
lationship was much more pronounced among women.
These studies in which the differential impact of religion
was greater for women than men were not based on older
individuals. This study suggests that this differential rela-
tionship between men and women may be reversed in old
age because of the unique social contexts associated with
aging. Men at older ages (especially among the cohorts
studied here) are likely to be retired and have limited ave-
nues for social engagement and contexts to obtain social
status. Men are disproportionately able to acquire posi-
tions within the church that convey social status. For men,
the church may serve as a compensatory device in main-
taining and increasing mental well-being that former ca-
reers and jobs once served.
The results of this study suggest that the effects of orga-
nizational religiosity on mental health are largely nonlinear.
Only the most religiously active individuals will incur men-
tal health benefits. The important issue is that individuals
who have moderate levels of religious involvement do not
tend to have different levels of mental health than those with
little or no religious involvement. These findings are consis-
tent with previous work on religious attendance and mortal-
ity among older Mexican Americans (Hill, Angel, Ellison,
& Angel, 2005).
This study has several limitations that deserve mention
and should be considered in future research. First, this study
did not take into account acute and chronic stressors occurring

throughout the duration of the study. The presence of
acute or chronic stressors could have confounded the re-
sults found here. Second, this study did not take into ac-
count the level of secular support available to the
respondent. Religious involvement may not appear to af-
fect women's mental health because they have large secu-
lar support networks that men do not. Finally, the
longitudinal data may have masked some of the effects
from religious activity on mental health through temporal
lags. As with most longitudinal analyses, more time points
would be beneficial.
The findings presented here suggest new avenues for
research on religion and mental health among the aging.
Future work should begin exploring the specific mecha-
nisms in which gender differences manifest themselves
and include acute and chronic stressors as potential mod-
erators. A broader picture of how religious involvement
influences mental health throughout the life course is also
essential. Perhaps women gain mental health benefits
from religion much earlier in life than men. More work is
required on different dimensions of mental health and
to further explore the understudied concept of death
anxiety--which has been shown to be intimately related
to religious activity. Work on religion, gender, and mental
health among the older population is still in its infancy
and future research is needed to unravel these complex
relationships.
