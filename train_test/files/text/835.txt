DataWatch
Children And Health Insurance: An Overview Of Recent Trends
by Paul W. Newacheck, Dana C. Hughes, and Miriam Cisternas
Abstract: This DataWatch examines trends in health insurance coverage of children using recent
data from the Current Population Survey. The results indicate that the number and proportion of
children who were uninsured changed little between 1988 and 1992. However, substantial changes
occurred in the composition of the insured population: The proportion of children covered by
employer-based private insurance declined from 60.7 percent in 1988 to 56.2 percent in 1992, while
the proportion of children covered by Medicaid increased from 15.6 percent to 21.6 percent over the
same period. These results indicate that a fundamental shift is occurring in responsibility for insuring
the nation's children--from the private sector to the public sector.
For children, as for the population in general, health insurance is a
critical link to health care. Uninsured children use fewer physician
services than insured children use and are significantly less likely than
publicly insured poor children are to identify a usual source of routine care.1
Although most children are covered by some form of private insurance for
all or part of their health care needs, a sizable number of children in the
United States are uninsured. Of the estimated 38.5 million Americans under
age sixty-five without health insurance in 1992, one-fourth were age eight-
een and younger.2 The percentage of children without any form of health
insurance has grown significantly in recent years, increasing by 40 percent
between 1977 and 1987.3 This trend is of serious concern, given the
relationship between health insurance and access to care.
The purpose of this DataWatch is to examine children's health insurance
status using the most current data available. We base this profile on data
from the Current Population Survey (CPS). We examine differences in
health insurance coverage patterns in 1992 according to family charac-
teristics and parents' attachment to the work force. We also assess recent
trends in insurance coverage to determine whether the percentage of chil-
dren without insurance has continued to rise in the 1990s.
Data sources. The CPS has been conducted monthly for more than fifty
years and is the official source for government statistics on employment and

unemployment.4 It is also a frequently cited source on health insurance
coverage.5 For this purpose, questions are added to the annual March survey
to elicit health insurance coverage status during the previous calendar year.
For the March survey, the U.S. Bureau of the Census conducts interviews
in approximately 57,000 households including almost 150,000 persons.
Households are selected to be representative of the nation's noninstitution-
alized population. The questions on health insurance coverage were identi-
cal in the March surveys of 1989-1993 used in this analysis. However, data
for these five years are not comparable with data for earlier years because of
changes implemented with the March 1989 survey.6
We considered children to have private insurance if the respondent
indicated that a child in the household was covered under a private plan
(paid for by someone either inside or outside the household). We classified
sample children as being covered by employer-based private health insur-
ance if an adult in the household had employer-based private health insur-
ance that covered the child. Public insurance was defined to include
Medicaid, Medicare, or military coverage. A child was considered to be
uninsured if no private or public insurance coverage was reported for that
child.7
Findings
Coverage and family characteristics. In 1992, 87.6 percent of children
under age eighteen had some form of private or public health insurance
coverage (Exhibit 1). Three out of four insured children had private health
insurance, while one out of four had some form of public coverage (Medic-
aid, Medicare, or the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Uni-
formed Services [CHAMPUS]).
Patterns of insurance coverage varied considerably for children of differ-
ent family characteristics. Most children with private insurance are insured
as dependents under a parent's employer-based policy. In 1992, 81 percent
of privately insured children, or thirty-eight million children nationwide,
were covered through such insurance plans. Children most likely to have
employer-based coverage were adolescents, non-Hispanic whites, children
in two-parent families, and children in higher-income households.
Not surprisingly, differentials in rates of employer-based coverage were
largest for those characteristics most closely associated with employment
status: race and ethnicity, family structure, and family income.8 Specifically,
non-Hispanic white children were almost twice as likely as black or His-
panic children to have employer-based insurance, while children in two-
parent families were almost three times as likely as children in single-parent
households to be covered by employer-based plans. As might be expected,

income exhibited the most pronounced gradient with employer coverage.
Children in families with incomes at 300 percent or more of the federal
poverty level were almost twice as likely to have employer-based insurance
as children in near-poor families (100-199 percent of the poverty level)
and fully ten times as likely to be covered as children in families with
incomes below the poverty level
Public coverage made up for some but not all of the disparities in private
coverage. Most children with public coverage are enrolled in Medicaid (87
percent in 1992); the remainder are covered by CHAMPUS or Medicare.
Medicaid coverage was most prevalent among younger children, minorities,
children in single-parent households, and children in low-income families.
More specifically, preschool-age children were twice as likely as adolescents
to be covered by Medicaid. This differential is in part a reflection of the
favorable treatment given to younger children in the congressionally man-
dated Medicaid eligibility expansions of the 1980s.9 Black and Hispanic
children were on average about three times as likely as non-Hispanic white
children to be covered by Medicaid. Even more pronounced differences are
apparent by family structure and income--two variables that are histori-
cally linked to Medicaid eligibility. Children in single-parent families were

more than four times as likely as children in two-parent households to have
Medicaid coverage. A substantial income gradient is also apparent, with
nearly two-thirds of children in families with incomes below poverty hav-
ing Medicaid coverage, compared with slightly more than one-fifth of
children in near-poor families and less than one-tenth of children in
families with incomes above twice the poverty level10
It is apparent that despite public- and private-sector efforts to broaden
private health insurance coverage and congressionally mandated Medicaid
expansions, a significant minority of children remains uninsured--83 mil-
lion children, or 12.4 percent of all noninstitutionalized children in 1992.
Groups at risk of being uninsured included adolescents, minorities, children
living with a single parent, and children in poor and near-poor families.
Importantly, even though minority children and other children from disad-
vantaged family circumstances are disproportionately represented among
the uninsured, they do not dominate this population. Specifically, non-
Hispanic white children made up a majority of the uninsured child popula-
tion in 1992. Most uninsured children were members of two-parent fami-
lies, and nearly two-thirds were in families with incomes above the poverty
level.
Parents' attachment to the work force. Given that most Americans
receive health insurance through the workplace, it is not surprising that
health insurance coverage among children would be closely related to the
work-force attachment of parents. Two of the most important determinants
of employer-based coverage for children are the number of workers in the
family and whether the family head (the parent with the highest earnings)
is a full-time worker (Exhibit 2).

248 HEALTH AFFAIRS | Spring 1995
The chances of having employer-based coverage differed among children
from families in which no parent worked and in families in which at least
one parent worked. While only a tiny fraction of children in nonworker
families had employer-based coverage, more than half of all children with a
working parent were covered by such plans. Having two working parents
greatly increased the likelihood of having employer coverage. Indeed, four
out of five children with two working parents had employer coverage, and
only 8 percent of children in this group were uninsured in 1992.
Whether the principal breadwinner in the family worked part time or full
time also had a substantial impact on the likelihood that a child was
covered by employer insurance. Only one in five children were covered by
employer-based plans in families in which the head worked only part time.
This compares to seven in ten children with such coverage in families in
which the head worked full time.
Families with limited attachment to the work force in 1992 relied heavily
on public coverage--principally Medicaid--to meet the health insurance
needs of their children. Public plans covered nearly 80 percent of children
in families in which the head was not in the work force and almost half of
all children in families in which the head worked only part time.
In fact, public coverage made up for most of the gaps in private coverage
for families with limited attachment to the work force. For example, chil-
dren in families with no working parents were about equally as likely as
children in families with a working parent to have some form of insurance.
Similarly, children in families in which the head was a nonworker were
equally as likely as children in families in which the head worked full time
to have some type of coverage.
The uninsured child population comprises primarily children whose
parents have a strong attachment to the work force. In 1992 fully three-
fourths of all uninsured children were members of families with at least one
working parent. Moreover, 70 percent of uninsured children belonged to
families in which the principal breadwinner was a full-time worker.
Changes in health insurance coverage, 1988-1992. The number of
children with some type of health insurance coverage climbed from 55.6
million in 1988 to 58.8 million in 1992, a 5.8 percent increase (Exhibit 3).
Because the overall child population grew by 5 percent during this period,
the percentage of children with insurance coverage rose slightly, from 86.9
percent to 87.6 percent. While the percentage of children who were unin-
sured declined commensurately, the numeric count of uninsured children
remained virtually unchanged over the period.
The apparent stability in the percentage of children with insurance over
the 1988-1992 period masks substantial underlying shifts in private and
public coverage. During much of this period the nation was enduring a

recession that cost many family breadwinners their jobs and their health
benefits. The economic downturn, combined with continued medical care
price inflation, also affected businesses' ability to provide costly health
benefits to their remaining workers. The industrial composition of the
country was changing as well, with a rapid shift of jobs from industries such
as manufacturing, characterized by generous fringe benefits, to jobs in the
service sector, characterized by lesser benefits.11 The net result of these
trends was a marked reduction in the percentage of children covered by
private insurance, from 73.5 percent in 1988 to 69.3 percent in 1992
(Exhibit 3). The entire decline was attributable to loss of employer-based
insurance. The proportion of children with employer-based coverage de-
clined, while coverage under other types of private insurance, such as
individually purchased policies, increased modestly.
To illustrate the effect of declining rates of employer coverage, we
applied the 1988 rate of employer-based coverage for children (60.7 per-
cent) to the 1992 child population. The difference between this figure and
the actual number of children with employer-based coverage in 1992 indi-
cates the net loss in children's employer-based coverage attributable to
changes in coverage rates and population growth. These computations
indicate that had employer coverage rates remained at their 1988 levels,
40.7 million children, not the 37.7 million actually covered, would have
been covered by employer plans in 1992.
During this same period the number and proportion of children with
Medicaid coverage grew from 10.0 million in 1988 to 14.5 million in 1992,
a 45 percent increase that far outstripped population growth of 5 percent

during the same period (Exhibit 3). This large increase was the result of
legislative changes enacted by Congress in the 1980s, as well as the reces-
sion that pushed more families into poverty during the early 1990s. Follow-
ing more than a decade of retrenchment in Medicaid eligibility at the state
and federal levels, Congress began enacting a series of eligibility expansions
in 1984 that gradually required states to cover larger numbers of low-
income children and pregnant women.12 Additional increases in Medicaid
coverage resulted from the recession of 1990 and 1991, when rising unem-
ployment resulted in a substantial increase in the number of children living
in families with incomes below poverty. Between 1988 and 1992 the
percentage of children living in poor families rose from 19.7 percent to 22.2
percent--a net increase of 2.3 million children.
Winners And Losers
Both the contraction of employer-based health insurance and the expan-
sion of Medicaid coverage were broadly felt across the child population.
However, children were not equally affected (Exhibit 4). Almost all sub-
groups of children experienced reductions in employer-based insurance
between 1988 and 1992. Preschool-age children, Hispanic children, chil-
dren in low-income families, and children in families with weak attach-
ment to the work force were at greatest risk of losing employer coverage. In
contrast, children in higher-income families and in families with two work-
ing parents experienced only a slight elevation in the risk of losing em-
ployer coverage.
Medicaid expansions increased the likelihood of coverage for all sub-
groups of children between 1988 and 1992. Younger children, non-
Hispanic white and Hispanic children, and children in near-poor families
were most likely to benefit from these expansions. Large relative increases
in coverage also occurred for children in certain types of families that
traditionally have been excluded from Medicaid coverage, including two-
parent families, moderate-income families, and families with at least one
working parent. However, care must be taken in interpreting changes over
time for children in these groups. Since Medicaid covered only a small
proportion of children in these groups during the base year, even modest
absolute changes can result in substantial relative changes.
For the child population as a whole, the expansion of Medicaid coverage
more than offset the contraction in employer-based coverage between 1988
and 1992. The result was a modest reduction in the overall likelihood that
children would be without insurance, as shown in the last set of columns in
Exhibit 4. Again, younger children, minorities, and children in poor fami-
lies were most likely to gain health security; in contrast, the risk of being

Alan Monheit found that this increase was primarily attributable to loss of
employer-based private insurance combined with more restrictive Medicaid
eligibility policies. The decline in employer coverage was the cumulative
result of several trends, including growing numbers of employers dropping
dependent coverage for their workers and a shift in the labor market toward
fields of employment that are less generous with health benefits. The
decline in Medicaid coverage during this period was largely the result of
more restrictive federal Medicaid eligibility rules and the failure of state
governments to adjust income eligibility thresholds to keep pace with
inflation.13
Examining more recent data on children's insurance coverage, we found
that the downward trend in employer-based private coverage has contin-
ued, even accelerated, into the early 1990s. During the ten-year period
1977-1987 studied by Cunningham and Monheit, employer-based private
coverage of children declined 4.8 percentage points--from 67.7 percent to
62.9 percent.14 During the five-year period 1988-1992 in the present study,
employer coverage declined 4.5 percentage points--from 60.7 percent to
56.2 percent.
The loss of private coverage occurring between 1977 and 1987 contrib-
uted to a 40 percent increase in the proportion of children without any
form of insurance. Despite the recent acceleration in the rate of loss of
private insurance, the proportion of children without any insurance actu-
ally declined slightly between 1988 and 1992. The relative stability in the
size of the uninsured population is largely attributable to expanded Medic-
aid coverage for children. As a result, nearly five million children were
added to Medicaid between 1988 and 1992. These results illustrate the
significant role Medicaid plays in providing a safety net for children. In the
face of large-scale losses in employer coverage and severe economic con-
traction, the elastic nature of the Medicaid program has helped to provide
millions of children with continued access to care.
A number of studies have confirmed Medicaid's value in ensuring access
to health care services for children. Among children from poor families,
those with Medicaid coverage have been shown to be more likely than
those without Medicaid coverage to have a usual source of health care and
to receive routine preventive care services (such as physical, eye, and dental
exams) at professionally recommended intervals.15 Moreover, while unin-
sured children from poor families lag behind children from nonpoor fami-
lies in their overall use of ambulatory care, children from poor families with
Medicaid coverage do not differ much from nonpoor children.16
Although Medicaid provides important insurance protection for chil-
dren who otherwise would be uninsured, it does not afford children the
same level of access to care that private health insurance provides. For

example, Medicaid-covered children are less likely than privately insured
children to use any health services, including hospital care, ambulatory
care, dental and vision services, and prescribed medications.17 In addition,
Medicaid-covered children are nearly twice as likely as privately insured
children to report having no regular source of care.18 Thus, while Medicaid
provides a critical safety net for millions of American children, it is not a
substitute for private health insurance coverage.
There is little evidence to suggest that the downward trend in employer-
based coverage for children will diminish in the near term. Indeed, the
recent increase in the rate of decline in employer-based coverage for chil-
dren is an ominous sign. This trend suggests increased reliance on Medicaid
as a coverage source of last resort for families losing private coverage
because of the changing economy or employer cutbacks in benefits for
dependents. The needs of these vulnerable families, combined with the
evidence presented in this paper on Medicaid's efficacy and its relatively
low per child cost, must be considered by policymakers as they debate the
future of this program.

7. All insurance variables, with one exception, were created using a methodology identi-
cal to that employed by the Bureau of the Census. This exception applies only to a
relatively small number of children reported as having private health insurance cover-
age that was provided through someone living outside the household. Although the
interview question regarding coverage provided by persons living outside the household
does not elicit the type of private coverage provided (employer-based or individually
purchased), the Census Bureau classifies this coverage as being provided through an
employer-based plan. We chose not to make this assumption. Specifically, we counted
these children as privately insured but not as having employer-based coverage. Conse-
quently, estimates of the total number of children reported with private health
insurance presented here are identical to Census Bureau estimates, but estimates of the
subtotal of children with employer-based coverage differ. Our approach results in a
slight underestimate of the actual population with employer-based coverage, while the
Census Bureau approach results in a slight overestimate.
8. Employment status does not explain all of the differences in rates of private coverage
by race, family structure, and income. A separate multivariate analysis revealed that
after parental employment status was controlled for, minority children and children
from single-parent or low-income families were still at a disadvantage in obtaining
private insurance coverage. Controlling for occupation and industry might further
explain differences in rates of private coverage.
9. Medicaid participation rates are also likely to be higher for younger children and
especially infants, because enrollment is automatic for the newborn children of preg-
nant women enrolled in the Medicaid program.
