Introduction
Opiate-dependent people are stigmatized members of soci-
ety: They have been demonized by politicians, the law, and
the press (Buchanan & Young, 2000; Elliott & Chapman,
2000) and are labeled as "dangerous," "anti-social," "unas-
sertive," and "dirty" by the general public (Finnigan, 1996;
Sheard & Tompkins, 2008). This can push people who are
dependent on opiates away from mainstream society, as well
as make recovery more difficult by hampering their reinte-
gration into the mainstream (e.g., drug offences make it more
difficult to become employed). Opiate users may also inter-
nalize negative stereotypes, losing self-confidence and feel-
ing "discarded and isolated from mainstream society"
(Buchanan & Young, 2000, p. 414). Indeed, many studies
report opiate users' feelings of social exclusion as well as a
yearning to have a "normal" life (Andersson, Nilsson, &
Tunving, 1983; Nettleton, Neale, & Pickering, 2011).
The nature of addiction can also push one away from a
mainstream lifestyle. For example, although economic dis-
advantage is not as associated with heroin initiation as the
stereotype purports (Seddon, 2008), poverty can become a
serious problem if one becomes dependent, which may then
lead on to other stigmatized social issues; homelessness,
physical/mental illness, and criminality are all more preva-
lent among opiate-dependent people (Sheard & Tompkins,
2008). Being part of mainstream society is also about having
relationships with others who are part of the mainstream, yet
people who become dependent on opiates increasingly with-
draw from non-using friends and family (Best, Manning, &
Strang, 2007). Finally, the opiate-dependent community has
its own language, shared understandings of needs, and shared
experiences that make it more comfortable around like mem-
bers (Anderson & Levy, 2003), which opiate users may con-
trast against the identity and pressures of the mainstream
(Best et al., 2007).
While there is ample literature concerning how propo-
nents of mainstream society view opiate-dependent people,
there is minimal literature regarding how people who are
dependent on opiates view or construct their own lifestyles,
and none that explicitly and purposefully look at how opiate-
dependent people view or construct a mainstream lifestyle or
mainstream members. There are several reasons, however,
that an opiate-dependent persons'relationship with, and con-
structions of, mainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles

who is dependent on opiates are personal relationships and

Thinking-Aloud About Stereotypical
Mainstream and Opiate-Dependent
Lifestyle Images: A Qualitative Study
With Opiate Addicts
Andrew McLeod1 and Jane Ogden1
Abstract
Participants (6 male, 4 female) on a methadone maintenance program completed a Think-Aloud procedure while viewing two
stereotypical picture sets depicting opiate-dependent and mainstream lifestyles. Discourse analysis indicated that participants
used two different discourses: a stereotype-affirming defensive discourse, which involved affirming the negative and positive
stereotypes regarding opiate-dependent and mainstream lifestyles, and a stereotype-refuting defensive discourse, which involved
refuting negative opiate-dependent stereotypes while constructing mainstream lifestyles and members negatively. We argue
that both discourses fit within a grander discourse concerning normalization with participants' speech functioning to defend
them from being negatively stereotyped by making them "normal" members of society.

social inclusion, which were severely hindered by being out-
side of the mainstream society. In Best, Ghufran, Day, Ray,
and Loaring (2008), the most commonly expressed reason
for wanting to be abstinent was becoming "tired of the life-
style," and the strongest cited factor for achieving abstinence
was moving away from drug-using friends. Furthermore,
mainstream services designed to help people become free of
opiates are often found to be stigmatizing and shaming to
service users, effecting continued participation (Gourlay,
Ricciardelli, & Ridge, 2005; Radcliffe & Stevens, 2008).
Finally, Nettleton et al. (2011) and Taïeb, Révah-Lévy, Moro,
and Baubet (2008) found that people who recover often see
themselves as "damaged" and seek to establish "acceptable"
(mainstream) identities.
Given the present discussion, the aim of this study is to
explore how people who are dependent on opiates but are
on a methadone maintenance program talk about and con-
struct mainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles in reac-
tion to mainstream and opiate-dependent stereotypes. But
first, it is worth considering participants' positions in the
study; they have taken steps to become free of illegal opi-
ates via methadone maintenance and attending key worker
meetings regarding health, employment, housing, and
criminal justice. Thus, participants are under explicit sur-
veillance from a mainstream institution and their help-
seeking actions implicitly or explicitly represent a shift
toward mainstream society.
Method
Design
The study is qualitative, using a "Think-Aloud" procedure
with some verbal prompts to gain audio data. The order in
which the opiate-dependent and mainstream picture sets
were shown was counterbalanced.
Sample
This opportunistic sample consisted of six males and four
females, aged 30 to 58 years, all of whom were White British
apart from one male who was Iranian. All participants were
on a methadone program at a harm minimization charity for
drug-dependency (where A.M. had volunteered for 9
months), primarily opiates, in outer London. Although no
participants claimed to still be using opiates, this cannot be
ruled out, and some participants said they were using other
illegal drugs (e.g., marijuana) and/or alcohol. Participant
demographics are shown in Table 1. All participants have
been given a pseudonym.
Measures
The Think-Aloud procedure involved talking as much as
possible in reaction to the images presented. After the
participant had stopped talking for a significant amount of
time (approximately 15 s), the researcher prompted the par-
ticipant to talk about a picture they had not yet discussed or
if the participant had talked about all of the pictures, then the
researcher used a pre-developed prompt or one based on
what they had said during the procedure.
The reason for employing the Think-Aloud method was
to reduce overly thought responses and facilitate a stream of
consciousness (Aanstoos, 1983) in the hope of better repli-
cating more passive, everyday situations where one is on a
more reactionary, pre-conscious level.
Procedure
Participants completed the procedure in a small room at a
drugs charity they attended almost every day as part of a
methadone maintenance program. The researcher explained
to participants the Think-Aloud procedure and that they
would be shown stereotypical images of opiate-dependent
and mainstream lifestyles, stressing that there were no right
or wrong answers, as the procedure simply requires talking
about what comes to mind when viewing the pictures, and
that there are no "tricks." The first set of images was then
revealed (which were pinned onto a board at random, apart
from the central image which was always either the picture
of heroin or the pint of beer depending on the lifestyle that
was being represented). After clarifying each picture (e.g.,
saying the picture of the squat was not just a run-down house,
etc.), the participant was asked to begin, the microphone was
switched on, and the researcher then sat behind them. After
viewing the first picture set (for 10-15 min), the next image
board was set up, the images were explained, and then the
participants were asked to "think aloud" about them as well.
Pictures
There were eight pictures in each of the two picture sets. One
picture set was selected to represent a stereotypical main-
stream lifestyle, and consisted of a family meal, a typical

semidetached house, a woman shopping, a pint of beer, com-
muters getting on the tube to work, four friends laughing, a
heterosexual couple, and a credit card. The other picture set
was selected to represent a stereotypical opiate-dependent
lifestyle, and consisted of a block of council estate flats, a
woman shoplifting, a mother with two young children (one
White, one mixed race), a heterosexual couple, a homeless
man with a dog and a cup, a 10 pound note, a large pile of
brown heroin, and a squat with some young people sitting.
The ideas for images were chosen in collaboration with
people who are or have been dependent on opiates. Care was
taken not to make the stereotypical opiate-dependent life-
style pictures too extreme to constrict the participants'
constructions.
Data Analysis
The analysis is placed within the traditions of Potter and
Wetherell's (1987) model of discourse analysis which
emphasizes the action orientation of talk, considers discourse
as "doing," and focuses on the ways in which participants
use discursive resources and manage issues of interest and
stake. In addition, the analysis was informed by the princi-
ples of Billig's (1987) rhetorical psychology. Rhetorical psy-
chology draws on the long-standing history of the study of
rhetoric and places the ways in which people speak or write
within a notion of argument and ideology and highlights
their cultural context at any given time. Accordingly, using
both these perspectives reflects a methodological position
whereby the language people use can be read to explore the
positions they are taking within their given social context.
Results and Discussion
Overall, two discourses could be seen within the data relat-
ing either to affirming or refuting stereotypes; these dis-
courses fit within a grander discourse concerning
normalization. These will be briefly described before being
detailed further.
Stereotype-Affirming Defensive Discourse
Of 10 participants, 4 (Kelly, Sarah, Hamid, and Helen) had
an overwhelmingly stereotype-affirming defensive dis-
course. On the whole, this involved supporting negative ste-
reotypes regarding an opiate-dependent lifestyle and positive
stereotypes regarding a mainstream lifestyle, while keeping
oneself from being labeled a stereotypical "junkie." Given
participants were recruited because they were on a metha-
done program, by affirming the negative opiate-dependent
stereotypes and separating themselves from those stereo-
types, participants placed themselves in a more positive
light; by affirming positive mainstream stereotypes partici-
pants could speak of their "new life" in a positive way, as
well as once again place themselves outside of a negative
opiate-dependent stereotype by allowing referral to "nor-
mal," positive aspects of a mainstream lifestyle they kept
during the time they used opiates. Thus, one can see how
affirmation of the stereotypes can serve to defend the partici-
pant's image; however, when "affirming participants" were
unable to separate themselves from a negative stereotype,
their language then often served to make them blameless,
again defending their image.
Stereotype-Refuting Defensive Discourse
Of 10 participants, 3 (Joe, Chris, and Kate) had an overwhelm-
ingly stereotype-refuting defensive discourse. Essentially,
this involved challenging the stereotypes and re-organizing
the realities presented to make them more equal and over-
lain. By talking about the mainstream negatively, partici-
pants positioned their current and/or old lifestyles as a more
equitable alternative, as opposed to a sharp drop in status.
"Refuting" could also challenge the stereotypes by widening
the boundaries of the presented conception of mainstream
and opiate-dependent lifestyles, deconstructing them such
that the categories became convoluted. The reconstruction of
stereotypes did not go so far as to present opiate use posi-
tively, or whatever lifestyle or activities surrounded opiate
use for the particular participant, but talking about it nega-
tively seemed to be avoided; instead analogies were often
drawn, for example, by comparing opiate use with alcohol.
Like the "affirming" discourse, the "refuting" discourse can
be seen as protecting the participant's image. Again, actions
could be constructed as more blameless if "refuting" was a
restricted option.
Three participants did not have a mainly "refuting" or
"affirming" defensive discourse. Of these, two participants
(Jack and John) had a more "affirming" discourse concern-
ing mainstream stereotypes and more of a "refuting" dis-
course concerning opiate-dependent stereotypes, though not
as strongly as the mainly "refuting" participants. The last
participant (Phil) did not say much and the procedure was
short as he had a very strong emotional reaction to the "alco-
hol" image; therefore, not enough text is present to make a
judgment regarding overall discourses.
Normalizing Defensive Discourse
The "affirming" and "refuting" discourses in essence serve
the same defensive function--that of normalization. The
"refuting" discourse worked on more of a group level, chal-
lenging the construction of normality presented by the ste-
reotypical images, for example, by blurring the boundaries
between mainstream and opiate-dependent groups and life-
styles or by constructing the mainstream negatively, making
the lifestyles more equivalent. If we think of the stereotypi-
cal lifestyles as two separate, hierarchical boxes, the "refut-
ing" discourse works by bringing the mainstream box down
in line with the opiate-dependent box and expanding the
4 SAGE Open
borders so they overlap. The "affirming" discourse worked
on a more personal level: Instead of challenging the presen-
tation of group stereotypes, it served to place participants
outside of the opiate-dependent stereotype, often as an
exception during the years when they used. If we again think
of the lifestyles as hierarchical boxes, the "affirming" dis-
course largely left the boxes where they were and placed par-
ticipants outside, somewhere in-between. As mentioned,
making oneself blameless was another strategy used by par-
ticipants; this fit into the normalization discourse as it served
to signal that the participant was not a bad person, but rather
that their actions were understandable and normal given their
circumstances.
The two subdiscourses--stereotype-affirming defensive
discourse and refuting defensive--will now be described in
greater depth in relation to the process of normalization.
Stereotype-affirming defensive discourse. As part of the basis of
an "affirming" discourse, a mainstream lifestyle was labeled
as normal and attractive. Indeed, within an "affirming" dis-
course, participants, aside from the topics of alcohol and
stigmatization, had no criticism of the mainstream and only
talked about it in an aspirational way, for example, having
steady employment, family meals, shopping for the week
instead of a day, and so on:
could be anywhere, looks quite nice, hmm I'd like to live there,
yeah, nice little garden, yeah, quaint . . . family having dinner,
hmm, yeah, I'd pictured myself happy like this once. (John)
Right, these are just part of a normal life. (Kelly)
Consequently, the mainstream was constructed as a posi-
tive lifestyle, especially in terms of community:
but everything's building up nicely, I got a fam- a new baby on
the way, and everything seems to be good, you know, I do miss
friendship, like I say I'm building up on friends but to be honest,
a lot of my time on my own, cause I isolated myself so much,
and work, I've lost jobs, you know, really good jobs. (Helen)
As exampled in the above quote, the positives of a stereo-
typically mainstream lifestyle were often contrasted against
the negatives of their own, previous opiate-dependent life-
style--a lifestyle and drug that was constructed entirely
negatively:
the lifestyle gets you down, everywhere, always `round the
corner, and it just takes you places before you know it. (Sarah)
this stuff is, is evil and it will make people, the nicest people do
the horrible-est things. (Helen)
Indeed, opiates were portrayed as a drug that "spirals" one
"out of control" (Helen). These particular constructions also
mitigate participants from possible attacks on their character,
given opiates can make the "nicest people" commit horrible
acts and take people places without their knowing. Mitigating
responsibility was a feature of "affirming defensive" dis-
courses in terms of opiates, parental responsibilities, and
crime; one participant employed a medical discourse when
talking about her opiate dependency:
you know I've never met anybody like me, who was taking
drugs, everybody was so greedy, "yeah I'll have that and all this
pills and whatever," no I didn't use like that, I just used to stop
being sick. (Kelly)
Here the participants' drug-use was presented as more of
a necessity, in contrast to the "greedy" stereotype (a presen-
tation that will also be seen in "affirming" participants'crim-
inal activities). Thus, by constructing an opiate-dependent
lifestyle in a stereotypically negative way, participants can
boost their image by comparison--"I wasn't that bad"--as
well as distancing themselves from the "opiate-dependent
group" in general. Furthermore, participants talked about
their opiate use in the past tense, positioning them outside of
the associated lifestyle.
Negative stereotyping was not limited to the lifestyle
or drug however, but extended to opiate users as well.
This provided another opportunity to contrast their more
"normal" and "positive" opiate-dependency with that of
the stereotype:
my only saving grace is that I still got my looks and all my teeth
(laughs), you know, most people they're, they're absolutely, torn
apart by this drug. (Helen)
they're stoned, they can't do anything, just get money for drugs,
I, I had a job for most of the time, umm before I got sick, but that
wasn't related to umm, to heroin. (Sarah)
"Affirming" participants consistently placed themselves
in the mainstream prior to drug dependency--further nor-
malizing themselves in contrast to the opiate-dependent
stereotype:
these photos represent to me, of what I've had, umm, before I
heavily got involved with drugs, I had my relationship, I had my
set of friends, I had my own house, umm, my own business.
(Hamid)
In this quote, we get an indication of how opiates were
constructed as a causal factor in negative life outcomes,
something consistently emphasized within an "affirming"
discourse.
In terms of whether "affirming" participants positioned
themselves as having more of an "opiate-dependent" or
"mainstream" identity in the present, it was variable as par-
ticipants tended to switch depending on the context.
Still, when it came to an opiate-dependent lifestyle, it was
spoken of in the past tense. Given participants' history with
McLeod and Ogden 5
opiate use and their affirmation of negative opiate-dependent
stereotypes, it is not surprising "affirming" accounts refer-
enced shame and guilt at their past:
I was always ashamed, always feeling guilty because of my kids,
you know, and the friends I had left, they knew but, they didn't
know, not all of what I was doing. (Sarah)
Emphasizing guilt helps portray participants as more
human than the opiate-dependent stereotype and helps inoc-
ulate them from potential attacks on their character. Relatedly,
some participants also spoke about pretending to be normal
during times of opiate use:
we were pretending to live a, nice, life, but you know behind
doors it was domestic violence, stealing, crack. (Kelly)
Parenthood was quite a prominent theme for each of the
three "affirming" women, and appeared to represent an
important battleground for protecting their image. For Kelly,
her keeping and looking after her children was the most
prominent tool used in distancing herself from the "junkie"
stereotype:
they don't see their kids, ok so they might go visit once a year
but they've definitely been taking it off whether it's, I don't
know I can't imagine how, I mean, I don't know, I don't
understand why you can't look after them though. (Kelly)
For Helen, it was a different story:
really I should have been thinking about my children and how to
get them back, I didn't lose them, I handed them to my father,
voluntary, I had a break-down, so, but that was due to other
things going on. (Helen)
Stealing was another contentious issue. Shoplifting was
spontaneously admitted to by three of the four participants
with a mainly "affirming" discourse and one with a mixed
discourse, but none of the three "refuting" participants.
However, these admissions fit within the "affirming defen-
sive" discourse by contrasting their stealing--only occa-
sional, little, and necessary--with the general, over-the-top
stealing of a typical "junkie":
well I got charged for both offences and I got put on tag, and
really and truly I wasn't a heavy shop lifter, I wasn't someone
out there earning money for drugs or really or going at it every
day like some, other guys I know. (Helen)
Again, "affirming" participants presented themselves as
"not-as-bad," affirming the stereotype to their advantage.
Three of the four participants also positioned their stealing
within a more valiant or blameless frame by describing how
they had to steal for their kids, even when the money was
directly or indirectly for drugs, and two participants said they
stole because they needed to eat:
but it's usually just because I've been stoned and I need to eat,
that's mostly it, but umm, or it's been a couple of times where
I've nicked a couple of presents `cause it's my daughter's
birthday or something, so I can spend the money on drugs but
I've never nicked solely to buy drugs, never. (Jack)
Methadone, within the "affirming" discourse, was con-
structed as a positive intervention, one that would help with
preventing a return to a previously chaotic life:
I'm leading that life now because I'm on the methadone. (Kelly)
Alcohol, on the other hand, was in fact labeled by all but
two participants, across discourses, as a drug as bad as, or
worse than, opiates:
in my actual experience of drugs, alcohol is probably about the
worst drug going, when it comes to how it changes peoples
personalities. (John)
This negative construction of alcohol, along with the con-
struction for mainstream members who drink, enabled par-
ticipants to present their addiction in a more positive light.
By bringing alcohol into a similar arena to opiates and mak-
ing their use comparable, participants also de-mythologize
opiate use and opiate users. The use of alcohol as analogous
to opiates could be considered a "refuting" tactic, but still fit
into the "affirming" discourse with its higher function of nor-
malization. "Affirming" accounts may also have benefited
from a flavor of refuting in terms of allowing participants to
be more balanced in their highly positive presentation of
mainstream life, while simultaneously protecting their
image.
There was one more topic where "affirming" discourses
aimed some criticism at the mainstream, and that was related
to stigmatization:
to just treat them like a human being, would, would really make
a difference, cause that's what people want, they just want to be
spoken to normally, treated with respect, unless they've given
them a reason, to dislike them. (Helen)
Like alcohol, commentary regarding stigmatization fit
into an "affirming" discourse via its higher function of nor-
malization--indeed the above quote explicitly relates stig-
matization to not being treated normally. Criticism of the
mainstream was also unproblematic for participants with a
mainly "affirming" discourse because they would talk about
past stigmatization, keeping them from presently being
labeled negatively due to opiate dependency, but also remov-
ing them from the mainstream at the point where it is being
criticized--though the "affirming" discourse by its nature
6 SAGE Open
involved the stigmatization of people who are dependent on
opiates, producing hypocrisy when taken as a whole.
Refuting defensive.In general, participants with a mainly
"refuting" discourse spoke negatively about mainstream life-
styles, with two of the three mainly "refuting" participants
having nothing positive to say whatsoever:
looks like a typical wage slave environment, everything there is,
to do with money and, earning it basically, apart from what
would appear to be students rather than friends, but all the other
pictures are basically, sheep going to work on the underground,
which I did for years before I wised, wised up, the nice semi-
detached house with the nice mortgage on it, which they'll never
probably never own. (Chris)
and what, sitting `round the table not talking, being married and
not having, having any fun or what, the couple, look how pissed
they look. (Kate)
Here we can see the construction of mainstream lifestyles
as money-oriented and monotonous. The contrast to the
"affirming" discourse is stark; whereas "affirmers" saw a
"happy couple" (Kelly), "a good healthy relationship"
(Hamid), or a "lovely family" (Sarah), "refuters" talked
about the same pictures negatively. However, mainstream
lifestyles were at the same time talked about as normal, espe-
cially by Joe who was less directly critical of mainstream
lifestyles: Instead of making mainstream lifestyle compo-
nents more negative, he focused on making opiate-dependent
and mainstream lifestyle components more equivalent and
comparable:
That's a normal house, a semi-detached three-bedroom house,
that's normal but it's normal living on an estate as well . . . um,
them two lovers, are like the lovers in the last one to me, no
difference. (Joe)
As indicated hereinbefore, the process of normalization in
the "refuting" discourse, as with its defensive function, is
more explicit and direct than the "affirming" discourse.
Furthermore, this normalization extended to the types of
people who used opiates as well as opiate use itself, with all
three of the "refuting" participants using doctors as an
example:
the ones who come down here (drugs charity) might do but in
life you get doctors on drugs, everything don't you, they can
write their own scripts out, you get politicians, everyone on
drugs, you just don't see them `cause they got money to go to a
private doctor. (Joe)
you'd be amazed at the number of doctors that, secretly addicted
to opiates, thousands of doctors a year get put away to dry out,
from opiate, addiction, but they're not on the streets, they're not
on that board, their life is quietly brushed under the carpet,
nobody wants to see it proved that people can live a normal
lifestyle, and use opiates. (Chris)
In addition to illustrating high-status groups using opi-
ates, serving to limit the types of inferences one might make
from knowing someone is/was dependent on opiates, Joe's
quote has other normalizing--defensive functions--he uses
an extreme case formulation when stating "everyone on
drugs" and compares the clients of the drugs charity, who he
says might fit the stereotype, to opiate-dependent people one
would find in "life," making the stereotypical clients seem
not real and minimizing their representation of the group.
Chris's quote is interesting in the way it introduces conspira-
torial tones, criticizing the mainstream who "brush" normal
opiate-dependent lives "under the carpet." Furthermore,
arguing a counter position is made more difficult because
challenging him would place one with the conspirators or the
ignorant who do not want "to see it proved that people can
live a normal lifestyle, and use opiates." Notice here, also,
the construction of heroin as a drug which can be controlled,
a drug that does not take everything from you one by one. A
final touch in the quotes was the effect of constructing non-
stereotypical opiate users as people whom one does not see,
either because they have money for a private doctor or
because they are deliberately hidden; again, this makes their
positions more incontestable. This worked especially because
the "refuting" discourses were bolstered by participants'
appeals to special in-group knowledge; in other words,
"refuting" discourses, which by their nature involved coun-
tering common ideas, required participants to make them-
selves the experts on the topic and the mainstream ignorant
of reality (this was not a feature of "affirming" discourses,
possibly because "affirmers" distanced themselves from an
opiate-dependent identity):
they read a book, go to Cambridge and think they know
something about heroin but unless you've been there, unless
you've been there you have no fucking clue, so how do, do they,
know me, they don't. (Kate)
With the "refuting" discourse, participants tended to talk
about groups as opposed to individuals, and spoke very little
about themselves and the particulars of their own life. As
such, "refuting" participants did not talk about guilt, shame,
personal crimes, or about what they have lost because of
opiate dependency. Indeed, for the "refuting" discourse, it
would not be beneficial to give evidence reinforcing nega-
tive opiate-dependent stereotypes, and because participants
presented opiate users as heterogeneous, speaking at a group
level ensures that any negative conjecture is placed within
the category of stereotyping and stigmatization. Focus at the
group level also meant "refuting" participants did not talk
about their "old selves" as illegal opiate users, as the "affirm-
ers" did--in fact, they rarely talked about their own opiate
use at all. Indeed, if the "refuting" discourse worked by
McLeod and Ogden 7
challenging and convoluting the distinction between opiate-
dependent and mainstream lifestyles, there is less appeal to
a before and after, especially a negative old self and positive
new self; the effect of this is to reinforce, or at least not clash
with, the construction of people who are opiate dependent as
normal people who happen to use opiates. One consequence
of all this is that the "refuting" discourse rarely implicates
opiates as a causal factor in negative consequences, instead
attention is deflected:
that shoplifter . . . could be stealing for drugs but could just be
for some money, most people steal for alcohol. (Kate)
Not surprisingly then, "refuting" participants did not say
that the stereotypical opiate-dependent images were a good
representation of opiate dependency:
right, in all your pictures, uhh, you're portraying a heroin user as
a down and out, socially maladjusted, emotionally disturbed,
individual or individuals, you don't portray, the whole picture of
heroin addiction or addiction in general. (Chris)
. . . yeah they represent . . . apart from the one in the middle
(picture of heroin) they could all be anything, any lifestyle can't
they . . . take the drug one out the middle and all the rest could
be a normal lifestyle. (Joe)
Here we see two very different ways to "refute" the ste-
reotypes: Chris describes the pictures as extreme and unrep-
resentative, while Joe describes them as so normal they could
be part of "any lifestyle." Either way the effect is the same,
whether a part of a more mainstream or opiate-dependent
lifestyle, you are normal. Defining normality was particu-
larly present in Joe's account, who redefined the boundaries
of normality several times depending on context, but near the
end defined each picture as normal (e.g., the squat, shoplift-
ing, heroin use, homelessness), even if he could not describe
them as mainstream:
it's normal, but it's not mainstream . . . yeah only two represent
that to me, that was the drugs obviously and the man (homeless
man), well it represents more alcoholism. (Joe)
"Refuting" participants, by making opiate-dependent
people more heterogeneous than the stereotype and widening
the catchment area of normality presented in the pictures,
position themselves as normal and mainstream, often explic-
itly, without having to reference specifics of their life:
how I live is part of mainstream society as far as I'm concerned,
I don't try to exile myself from mainstream society, that's
mainstream society saying I'm not like you. (Chris)
However, when criticizing the mainstream, "refuting"
participants, much like "affirming" participants, remain
positioned outside of the mainstream:
sometimes I feel sorry for them, they got a lot of stress on their
boat ain't they, got to pay the mortgage and all that. (Joe)
As mentioned, the "refuting" discourse did not refute so
much that opiates became a positive experience or drug, but
it was normalized. Furthermore, negative talk about opiates,
rife in "affirming" accounts, was not talked about much;
when opiates were talked about negatively, it was more
innocuous than "affirming" accounts (e.g., "physically
addictive" (Chris) as opposed to "evil" (Helen)) and was
most often counterbalanced with an analogy:
heroin has never really been proved, to kill except in overdoes
quantities, which is the same in everything, water will kill you in
overdoes quantities. (Chris)
Methadone, however, was spoken of very negatively,
again contrasting the "affirming" discourse:
methadone's worse, it's addictive, it gets you down, has side
effects, withdrawals, umm, and, and the only reason that we get
it is `cause they won't give us gear to get us off it. (Kate)
Placing responsibility of addiction on factors other than
oneself was less of a feature in "refuting" discourses, in
part because the discourse was at a less personal, group
level. Therefore, responsibility, when laid down, was often
put at the feet of mainstream society as opposed to indi-
viduals such as partners or family, as in the "affirming"
accounts:
people have been shoveled onto these council estates, society
produces these problems, you shovel a whole bunch of people
who are all addicted to the same substance in one little same
area. (Chris)
they make it illegal, yeah, illegal, and then arrest us `cause we
need it, then when people try to get a job they can't, have to steal
yeah, tell people to get better then say sorry, you have to come
here every day at three. (Kate)
Hypocrisy was almost inevitable when refuting the ste-
reotypes and it was perhaps the most difficult in these
moments where mainstream society's part in opiate depen-
dency was being described. For example, Chris portrayed a
picture of people living on council estates as "all" addicted to
opiates, and Kate portrayed heroin as a drug that is needed
and leads to stealing, in sharp contrast to their previous state-
ments. Kate's comments regarding having to get her metha-
done script every day during working hours represents
another layer to the negativity directed toward methadone as
a solution to opiate dependency. The quotes, in fact, can be
taken as commentary on stigmatization, something that the
"affirming" and "refuting" discourses had in common along
with the rhetoric regarding the status of alcohol--in fact,
sometimes these concepts combined:
8 SAGE Open
a heroin's addict a heroin's addict umm, it's acceptable to be an
alcoholic but it's not acceptable to be a heroin addict, but umm,
I, both cost the same, how many heroin addicts would we have
and how many alcohol addicts? Remove the stigma which one's
more dangerous? (Chris)
Conclusion
The present study therefore aimed to explore how people
who are currently dependent on opiates conceptualize
mainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles using a Think-
Aloud procedure. From the analysis, two discourses could
be seen within the data relating either to affirming or refut-
ing stereotypes which can be understood with a grander
discourse concerning normalization. In particular, some
participants illustrated an affirmation of mainstream and
opiate-dependent stereotypes, which appeared to defend
the participant's notion of self, making them blameless and
defending their image. In contrast, some showed a refuting
defensive discourse which involved re-organizing and chal-
lenging the realities presented by the stereotypes. These
"affirming" and "refuting" discourses in essence served the
same defensive function--that of normalization, however,
while the "refuting" discourse worked on more of a group
level, for example, by blurring the boundaries between
mainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles, the "affirm-
ing" discourse worked on a more personal level by placing
the individual outside of the opiate-dependent stereotype.
Mostly, then, data indicate that people with an opiate-
dependency have a need to be seen as, and treated as, an
individual, three-dimensional human and not as a grossly
negative stereotype. This need could be triggered whenever
mainstream versus opiate-dependent identities or stereotypes
become salient. These results have implications for the ways
in which this population could be approached and illustrate
possible barriers and facilitators for uptake and involvement
in rehabilitation. First, in terms of how this population could
be approached, the results from the present study indicate
that what these clients actually say may not be a direct reflec-
tion of what they think but more an illustration of a presenta-
tion of their self which is defending against existing
stereotypes. When deciding to engage with a drug program,
these identities may become particularly salient as they are
being confronted with the norms of mainstream society.
Therefore, the ways in which clients in the drug service relate
their life circumstances and how they would like to move
forward may not present true and concrete versions of reality,
but rather their constructions may be borne out of need to be
seen as a normal individual. Accordingly, those working
with this client group should be aware of this need to be
defensive and attempt to offer a supportive, empathetic, and
non-judgmental relationship to help lower such defenses so
that more productive work can take place.
Second, in terms of potential barriers to the uptake and
engagement with support, the results also highlight some
implications for practice. In particular, the "refuting" dis-
course involved minimizing the negative consequences of
opiate dependency, while emphasizing the negative conse-
quences of mainstream life; specifically, methadone was
labeled negatively and opiates were constructed as a more
controllable drug. This construction may make it more likely
that clients slip back into an opiate-dependent lifestyle, or
even less likely to enter treatment in the first place. Similarly,
the "refuting" "slave wage" construction of mainstream real-
ity may signify that attaining secure employment is less
likely. Therefore, those working with this client group need
to be prepared to challenge this "refuting" discourse, while
recognizing the need for normalization. However, this will
not be an easy task given the level of functions that this dis-
course serves.
Third, it is possible that the "affirming" discourse may
signify positive outcomes in terms of abstinence and integra-
tion into mainstream society with an associated better quality
of life. Therefore, it may be beneficial to vocalize agreement
with mainstream stereotypes for the purpose of interacting
with mainstream members and institutions as it does not
cause tension or upset the status quo and will be less likely to
be interpreted as defensive.
There are several limitations to this study which need to
be considered. First, participants were on a methadone main-
tenance program and so the discourses produced, and their
hypothesized consequences, may not generalize to those who
are not seeking treatment or indeed to other people on a
methadone maintenance program, given the sample size.
Also, the potential consequences of the discourses are just
that--hypothesized. Future research, preferably quantitative,
is needed to establish whether there are any significant con-
sequences and to suggest helpful solutions.
To conclude, the results from the present study indicate
that participants dependent on opiates relate to stereotypes of
mainstream and opiate-dependent lifestyles in ways that nor-
malize their past and current positions in society.Accordingly,
whether they refute or affirm the stereotypes presented, they
do so in ways to protect and defend against their notions of
selves. Most treatment programs for opiate dependency offer
a solution to any client's behavior by encouraging a shift
away from the opiate lifestyle toward a more mainstream
way of living. The results from the present study not only
provide insights into how those with opiate dependency con-
ceptualize these two lifestyles but also highlight potential
barriers and facilitators that need to be addressed if this shift
in behavior is to occur. In particular, the results highlight a
need to understand the defensive nature of the rhetoric used
and that while affirming discourses may facilitate recovery
refuting discourses could act as a barrier.
