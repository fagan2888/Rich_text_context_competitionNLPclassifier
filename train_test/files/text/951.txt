About Trends in Late-Life Cognitive Functioning

TWO years ago, Freedman, Aykan, and Martin (2001)
reported that the percentage of older Americans with
severe cognitive impairment had declined significantly from
6.1% in 1993 to 3.6% in 1998. These apparent improvements
were not explained by changes in demographic and socioeco-
nomic composition or the prevalence of stroke, vision, or hear-
ing impairments. We concluded cautiously that older persons
appeared to have better cognitive functioning at the end of the
decade. In a companion piece (Freedman, Aykan, & Martin,
2002), we showed that these results were robust to a variety of
assumptions about missing data, loss to follow-up, and the
institutional population, and called for replication with future
waves of the Health and Retirement Study (HRS).
In today's issue of the Journal, Rodgers, Ofstedal, and
Herzog (2003) provide this much-needed analysis of additional
HRS waves. They conclude, quite the opposite--that there ap-
pears to have been little improvement--and call for future stud-
ies based on other data sources.
Like so many other scientific matters of import, the question
of late-life cognitive trends is not easily answered and research-
ers have called for additional investigation. Yet we are left to
wonder: Will analyses of additional data sources bring us closer
to the truth or simply add to the confusion?
These three analyses of the HRS join a small but growing set
of studies of national trends in late-life cognition. Rodgers and
colleagues (2003) refer to several studies that draw upon the
National Long Term Care Survey, which points to declines in
dementia among the chronically disabled from the early 1980s
through mid-1990s. In addition, using the 1986 and 1993
National Mortality Followback Studies, Liao, McGee, Cao, and
Cooper (2000) showed significant declines in cognitive dys-
function in the last year of life for men aged 65­84 years and
women aged 65 years and older. In sum, thus far two surveys
suggest improvements, and a third provides inconsistent evi-
dence that appears sensitive to analytic decisions.
As in the disability-trend literature, analysis of additional
waves and data sources (such as the National Health Interview
Survey, which recently added cognition measures) does not
guarantee that the ``truth'' will be forthcoming. During the last
decade, for example, inconsistencies have emerged regard-
ing trends in limitations in activities of daily living (ADLs;
Freedman, Martin, & Schoeni, 2002). The seven surveys that
have provided relevant information offer various strengths and
weaknesses and differ in their definitions of disability, the age
groups covered, time periods, modes of data collection, rules
about proxy involvement, inclusion of institutional population,
and effectiveness in minimizing loss to follow-up and non-
response. A similar set of variations exist for the four national
surveys that now include questions on cognition.
These varied survey design features are compounded by the
distinct analytic decisions made by authors about nonresponse
and coding of measures. Rodgers and colleagues (2003), for
example, cite several analytic differences between their study
and the studies by Freedman and colleagues (2001, 2002)--the
treatment of sampled persons for whom proxies responded, the
imputation methods for missing data, and the use of different
cutoffs to identify those with severe impairment. A fourth key
difference that appears especially important in the analysis by
Rodgers and colleagues--controlling for prior testing--could
not be incorporated into the two-wave comparisons (Freedman
et al., 2001, 2002). Without additional sensitivity analyses, it is
impossible to sort out how these analytic decisions contribute to
the inconsistencies.
Moreover, measuring cognitive functioning may be even
more challenging than measuring limitations in ADLs or re-
lated underlying physical limitations for three reasons. First,
cognitive impairment is a complex, multidimensional concept
encompassing disruptions of memory, language function, mo-
tor activity execution, object recognition, abstract thinking,
information processing, spatial orientation, and judgment. Yet
these concepts are not easily separated or measured, and despite
several reliable clinical screens for dementia, no universally
accepted survey instrument has emerged. The wide variation in
measurement approaches--from proxy-assessments of memory
to tests of recall for those able to participate in a survey--will
inevitably complicate comparisons. Second, the mere presence
of cognitive impairment increases the need for a proxy. On the
basis of the analysis by Freedman and colleagues (2001), for

example, we calculate that roughly 30­40% of older Americans
living in the community with severe cognitive impairment do
not respond for themselves, and roughly 35­50% of those with
severe cognitive impairment live in institutional settings, where
proxy interviews are the rule rather than the exception. Surveys
that omit proxy assessments or the institutional population may
paint a misleading portrait of national trends. Third, cognition
is influenced by external stimuli, so interview circumstances mat-
ter, and, for those functioning at high enough levels to allow
learning, responses may be influenced by the number of times
an individual is exposed to a test. The possibility of learning
effects, along with the complications of nonrandom loss to
follow-up that often occur with panel designs, suggests that a
repeated cross-sectional design may be more appropriate for
assessing national trends in cognition.
Through replication, scientists retest hypotheses and build
a body of knowledge. Yet varied survey features coupled with
unique analytic decisions dilute the notion of replication, rais-
ing the possibility of inconsistent findings despite a single
underlying truth. Can researchers coordinate their future efforts
to find the truth more efficiently? If scientists could agree to key
analytic decisions and vigorously examine the sensitivity of find-
ings, some unnecessary variation potentially could be elimi-
nated. The disparate underlying survey designs and measures
are more difficult to address, but an attempt at harmonization
of measures across surveys and settings would be a useful next
step. Ultimately researchers may need a new data source, one
that provides repeated cross-sections of both the community
and institutional population, to find the truth about trends in
late-life cognitive functioning.
