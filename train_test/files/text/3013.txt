totrauma,surgery,canceror
noncancer conditions, and
including pain occurring at
the end of life, continues to be a major
public health concern.1-4 Although nu-
merous nonpharmacologic treatments
can be used to relieve pain, the use of
opioids in the class of morphine is the
cornerstone of pain management.5-8
However, because opioids have the
potential to be abused, they are regu-
lated under international and national
narcotics and controlled substances
laws.9,10 International and US federal
drug laws embody a dual imperative to
ensure the availability of controlled sub-
stances for medical and scientific pur-
poses, while at the same time to pre-
vent their diversion and abuse.11
Concerns related to drug abuse per-
meate efforts to treat pain with opi-
oids. Patients are concerned about be-
coming addicted to opioids.6,12,13 Health
care professionals may be reluctant to
prescribe, administer, dispense, or stock
controlled substances for fear of caus-
ing addiction or contributing to the
drug abuse problem.14-17 There are few
studies of the extent to which prescrip-
tion opioid analgesics contribute to the
national drug abuse problem.18 In this
descriptive study, we examine the abuse
of opioid analgesics in relationship to
their medical use.
METHODS
We evaluated abuse trends for opioid
analgesics as a class, as well as the medi-
cal use and abuse of 5 specific Sched-
ule II opioids: fentanyl, hydromor-
phone, meperidine, morphine, and
oxycodone. We chose these 5 drugs be-
cause they are effective in treating se-
vere pain and are marketed as analge-
sics.5-7,19 We excluded opioid analgesics
classified in lower schedules (ie, Sched-
ules III and IV), such as hydrocodone
and codeine combinations because they
are not indicated for severe pain. We
also excluded opioid analgesics for
which consumption data would in-

Context Pain often is inadequately treated due in part to reluctance about using opi-
oid analgesics and fear that they will be abused. Although international and national
expert groups have determined that opioid analgesics are essential for the relief of pain,
little information has been available about the health consequences of the abuse of these
drugs.
Objective To evaluate the proportion of drug abuse related to opioid analgesics and
the trends in medical use and abuse of 5 opioid analgesics used to treat severe pain:
fentanyl, hydromorphone, meperidine, morphine, and oxycodone.
DesignandSetting Retrospectivesurveyofmedicalrecordsfrom1990to1996stored
in the databases of the Drug Abuse Warning Network (source of abuse data) and the
Automation of Reports and Consolidated Orders System (source of medical use data).
Patients Nationally representative sample of hospital emergency department ad-
missions resulting from drug abuse.
Main Outcome Measures Medical use in grams and grams per 100 000 popula-
tion and mentions of drug abuse by number and percentage of the population.
Results From 1990 to 1996, there were increases in medical use of morphine (59%;
2.2 to 3.5 million g), fentanyl (1168%; 3263 to 41 371 g), oxycodone (23%; 1.6 to
2.0 million g), and hydromorphone (19%; 118 455 to 141 325 g), and a decrease in
the medical use of meperidine (35%; 5.2 to 3.4 million g). During the same period,
the total number of drug abuse mentions per year due to opioid analgesics increased
from 32 430 to 34 563 (6.6%), although the proportion of mentions for opioid abuse
relative to total drug abuse mentions decreased from 5.1% to 3.8%. Reports of abuse
decreased for meperidine (39%; 1335 to 806), oxycodone (29%; 4526 to 3190), fen-
tanyl (59%; 59 to 24), and hydromorphone (15%; 718 to 609), and increased for
morphine (3%; 838 to 865).
Conclusions The trend of increasing medical use of opioid analgesics to treat pain
does not appear to contribute to increases in the health consequences of opioid an-
algesic abuse.

methadone).
Data on Drug Abuse Trends
We used the Drug Abuse Warning Net-
work (DAWN) as the source for data on
opioid abuse. DAWN, sponsored by the
SubstanceAbuseandMentalHealthSer-
vices Administration in the US Depart-
ment of Health and Human Services,
provides estimates of the health conse-
quences of the nonmedical use of indi-
vidual drugs. It is a large-scale, ongo-
ing retrospective survey of medical
records that is used to monitor na-
tional drug abuse trends. The system
collects information from DAWN-
affiliated hospital emergency depart-
ments (EDs) to identify substances that
are abused; monitor drug abuse pat-
ternsandtrendsanddetectnewdrugen-
tities and combinations; assess health
hazards associated with drug abuse;
and provide data for national, state, and
local drug abuse policy and program
planning.
Data are collected on patients 6 years

other nonmetropolitan areas. Hospitals

federal,short-staygeneralhospitalswith
24-hour EDs that are located in the co-
terminousUnitedStates.DAWNhasbeen
in existence since 1972, and began col-
lecting data from a nationally represen-
tativesampleofEDsin1990.20,21 Forour
analysis,weuseddatafromthe7-yearpe-
riodfrom1990to1996(themostrecent
year for which data were available at the
time this study was begun).
Each hospital has a designated re-
porter, usually a member of the ED or
medical records department, who is re-
sponsible for obtaining information
from medical records each time a pa-
tient visits the ED with a presenting
problem related to drug use; each visit
is defined as an episode. Reported epi-
sodes typically involve drug over-
doses, but also may be the result of long-
term drug use and adverse reactions.
The reporter collects information for
each episode, including gender, eth-
nicity, age, concomitant use of other
drugs, motive for use, reason for ED
contact, source of substance, dosage
form, and route of administration. The
national estimates of abuse are de-
rived from these data. Standardized pro-
cedures are used to collect DAWN data;
however, there may be some variabil-
ity from facility to facility.20
Drug abuse in the DAWN system is
defined as the nonmedical use of a sub-
stance for psychic effect, dependence,
or suicide attempt or gesture. Drug
abuse can involve the use of illicit drugs
or any other substance (eg, heroin,
marijuana, peyote, glue, aerosols); pre-
scription drugs in a manner inconsis-
tent with accepted medical practice; and
over-the-counter drugs contrary to ap-
proved labeling.20
For each episode of drug abuse, as
many as 4 different substances, in ad-
dition to alcohol, can be recorded. Each
is referred to as a drug mention. More
than half of DAWN episodes involve
multiple drug mentions.20 If DAWN re-
porters are not able to classify a drug,
these mentions are classified as other/
unspecified. DAWN reports do not in-
clude information about drugs for
which the frequency of annual men-
tions is less than 200. However, for our
study, the Substance Abuse and Men-
tal Health Services Administration per-
formed a special data run to extract an-
nual abuse mentions for one of the
study drugs, fentanyl, for which the
number of mentions is consistently less
than 200 per year.
We renamed several drug categories
and reclassified a number of drugs to
reflectcurrentmedicalterminologyand
pharmacology. The categories desig-
nated as narcotic analgesics and non-
narcoticanalgesicswererenamedasopi-
oidanalgesicsandnonopioidanalgesics.
Some drugs were reclassified: codeine
combinations were recategorized from
otherdrugstoopioidanalgesics.Hydro-
codone was reclassified from other/
unspecified narcotic analgesics to opi-
oidanalgesics.Ibuprofenandnaproxen
were transferred from other drugs to
nonopioid analgesics. Methamphet-
amine and methaqualone, originally
classified as amphetamines and non-
barbituratesedatives,respectively,were
moved to the category of illicit drugs.
Other/unspecified drugs listed within
each subcategory of DAWN reports
were aggregated into 1 "other drugs"
category.
DAWN reports routinely combine
heroin and morphine mentions into a
single category, making it impossible
to distinguish between the abuse of an
illicit drug and an essential pain medi-
cation. We requested that the Sub-
stance Abuse and Mental Health Ser-
vices Administration separate morphine
from the heroin-morphine category for
the period from 1990 to 1996. Mor-
phine mentions accounted for an an-
nual average of 1.9%, and never ex-
ceeded 2.5%, of the combined heroin-
morphine category.
Data on Medical Use of Opioids
We obtained data on medical use of opi-
oids from the US Drug Enforcement
Administration's Automation of Re-
ports and Consolidated Orders Sys-
tem (ARCOS) for the years 1990 to
1996. ARCOS is a federal, computer-
ized data system, required by the 1970
Controlled Substances Act.10 ARCOS
monitors the lawful distribution of con-
trolled substances in Schedules I and
II and narcotic substances in Schedule
III from manufacturers to the retail level
of consumption, including hospitals,
pharmacies, and licensed practition-
ers. The Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration makes reports on ARCOS data,
providing information on individual
states and national totals.22 Informa-
tion is provided for each drug in total
grams and grams per 100 000 popula-
tion.23,24 ARCOS is the only nonpropri-
etary source of information on medi-
cal use of opioids.

mentions, mentions for nonopioid an-
algesics account for 8.6%, and men-
tions for illicit drugs account for 33.2%.
TABLE 2 presents the abuse levels for
the same drug categories as number of
mentions and as a percentage of total
DAWN mentions for the period 1990
to 1996. From 1990 to 1996, the num-
ber of mentions for drug abuse in
DAWN increased from 635 460 to
907 561 (42.8% increase), with an in-
crease in total mentions for all drug cat-
egories. For opioid analgesics, the to-
tal number of mentions increased from
32 430 in 1990 to 34 563 in 1996 (6.6%
increase), but declined as a percent-
age of total mentions from 5.1% in 1990
to 3.8% in 1996. Illicit drugs is the only
category of drug abuse that exhibited
a continual increase in both number of
mentions and percentage of total men-
tions over the study period.
Trends in the medical use of the 5 se-
lected opioid analgesics from 1990 to
1996 are shown in TABLE 3. Substan-
tial increases were observed in use of
fentanyl and morphine, which oc-
curred in both total use and use ad-
justed for population.
TABLE 4 presents trends for the abuse
of the 5 selected opioid analgesics for
the same 7-year trend. The number
of abuse mentions, as measured by
DAWN, for fentanyl, hydromorphone,
meperidine, and oxycodone declined
during the study period, whereas abuse
mentions for morphine increased by
3.2%. The abuse levels for each of the
5 opioid analgesics, as a percentage of
total DAWN mentions, were less than
1% and declined during the study pe-
riod despite substantial increases in
medical use.
COMMENT
Official Drug Enforcement Adminis-
tration data indicate that the amounts
of fentanyl, oxycodone, hydromor-
phone, and morphine distributed to the
retail level have increased substan-
tially.25 According to the World Health
Organization, increasing medical use of
opioids is one indication that progress
is being made to improve pain man-
agement.19 Despite these increases, pain
is still inadequately treated due to nu-
merous barriers to pain manage-
ment.6,26 In the future, as these barri-
ers are addressed, the medical use of
opioid analgesics may be expected to
increase further.
Inthisstudy,meperidinewastheonly
opioidthatdecreasedinmedicaluseover
the study period. This decrease may re-
flect increasing awareness of the short-
comings of the use of meperidine for
chronic pain, which includes short du-
ration of action and accumulation of a
long-lived toxic metabolite.6,27
These data suggest that opioid anal-
gesics, including the 5 study drugs, are
a relatively small part of drug abuse as
measured by the DAWN system. Al-
though there are year-to-year varia-
tions, the abuse levels have remained
low and relatively stable for the past 7
years despite substantial increases in the
medical use of opioids. Although abuse
of most opioids decreased during the
study period, several caveats are needed
to place these results in context.
First, these data also indicate that
there is some abuse of opioid analge-
sics. However, compared with the abuse
of other drugs, illicit drugs in particu-
lar, the abuse of opioid analgesics ap-
pears to be relatively low, accounting
for 3.8% of total DAWN mentions in
1996. Moreover, even though there
were increases in the total number of
mentions of abuse for opioid analge-
sics during the study period, the pro-
portion of mentions for opioid abuse
relative to total reports of drug abuse
decreased by 25% (from 5.1% to 3.8%).

Second, the DAWN system may un-
derestimate the extent of the drug abuse
problem. The DAWN system mea-
sures only those episodes of drug abuse
that result in an admission to an ED,
and thus underreports the true extent
of all drug abuse, such as drug-related
overdoses and deaths occurring out of
the hospital. We believe that this limi-
tation, which is common to all drug
abuse monitoring systems, should not
affect the proportional representation
of drug categories because it should af-
fect all drug categories equally. Fur-
thermore, our study primarily ad-
dresses changes in abuse trends rather
than abuse levels at a single point in
time. As such, it is important to evalu-
ate these data longitudinally to exam-
ine the stability of the incidence fre-
quency, and to detect relative changes
in abuse levels. However, the appar-
ent stability of abuse levels over the
study period suggests that actual abuse
of opioid analgesics, regardless of to-
tal prevalence, is also relatively stable.
Third, although the DAWN system
collects some information about the se-
verity of adverse events resulting from
drug ingestion, such as mortality rates
and hospital admissions, we were un-
able to use the data to detect any trends
in the severity of adverse events re-
lated to the abuse of opioid analgesics.
The mortality data in the DAWN ED
system are sparse because most deaths
do not occur in the ED. Instead, these
deaths appear in the DAWN medical ex-
aminer data. However, the DAWN
medical examiner reports were not used
because drug-related mortality data do
not differentiate among deaths related
to morphine, heroin, and codeine.
Moreover, data on hospital admis-
sions related to abuse of opioid anal-
gesics are not available for most of the
drugs examined in this study.
Fourth, we used data on abuse of opi-
oids from the DAWN system. Two
other sources of drug abuse informa-
tion were considered but not used. The
National Household Survey on Drug
Abuse,28 a widely known survey mea-
suring drug abuse prevalence, was not
used because data are not available for
specific opioid analgesics. Also, the
Toxic Exposure Surveillance Sys-
tem,29 which tracks exposures to toxic
substances from a large sample of re-
gional poison control centers, was not
used because it is not nationally rep-
resentative and because the cost of ac-
quiring the data was prohibitive.
CONCLUSION
Conventional wisdom suggests that the
abuse potential of opioid analgesics is
such that increases in medical use of
these drugs will lead inevitably to in-
creases in their abuse. The data from
this study with respect to the opioids
in the class of morphine provide no sup-
port for this hypothesis. The present
trend of increasing medical use of opi-
oid analgesics to treat pain does not ap-
pear to be contributing to increases in
the health consequences of opioid an-
algesic abuse. To maintain this trend,
manufacturers, pharmacies, clini-
cians, and patients should continue
their efforts to improve pain manage-
ment while exercising care so that the
diversionofopioidmedications for non-
medical use is minimized. If the abuse
of opioid analgesics should increase, the
sources of diversion should be ad-
dresseddirectlywithoutinterferingwith
medical availability of opioid analge-
sics, legitimate medical practices, or pa-
tient care.
