Despite the fact that the treatment of hypertension remains
one of the most extensively investigated areas of clinical
medicine, there remain a number of important questions,
the answers to which would affect guidelines for hyperten-
sion management and a change in clinical practice.
Three of these questions were addressed by the
PATHWAY Programme of trials conducted under the
auspices of the British Hypertension Society (BHS).
The first of these trials, PATHWAY 1,1 was designed to
test the hypothesis that hypertensive patients initially ran-
domised to monotherapy, with subsequent progression to
combination drugs, are less likely to achieve optimal blood
pressure (BP) reduction when compared with those
assigned initially to combination therapy. The "never catch
up hypothesis" was suggested by the blood pressure
responses reported in two trials,VALUE2 and ASCOT,3
and was based on the premise that poor responses to mon-
otherapy are, in part, due to the reflex activation of coun-
ter-regulatory responses that may, in the longer term, affect
BP control by combination drugs.
PATHWAY 1, was a parallel group, randomised, dou-
ble-blind trial, carried out in hypertensive patients with
untreated home systolic BP > 150 mmHg or diastolic BP >
95 mmHg. Six hundred and five patients were randomised
in a double-blind study to sequential monotherapy with
either hydrochlorothiazide 12.5 mg, or losartan 50 mg, or
combination therapy with the two drugs. After a period of
four weeks, doses of the drugs were doubled for a further
four weeks. The monotherapy arms then crossed over for a
similar time period during which the combination therapy
arm continued on optimal dosage (phase 1). At the end of
the second monotherapy period all patients continued for a
further 16 weeks on combination therapy (phase 2). The
primary endpoint was the difference from baseline in home
SBP, compared between monotherapy and the combina-
tion, first averaged across phases 1 and 2 and then at the
end of phase 2. In a third phase of the study, additional
drugs could be added openly (amlodipine and doxazosin)
in those who failed to reach target blood pressures.
This trial and indeed the other PATHWAY trials were
unique in that they were the first trials to use home blood
pressure measurements as the basis for patient inclusion
and management throughout the trial.
The results of PATHWAY 1 have been presented but
await publication. Whilst the underlying hypothesis was
rejected by the finding that both arms of the trial achieved
identical blood pressure reduction at the time of evaluation
of the primary endpoint, the time course for blood pressure
reduction in those subject to sequential monotherapy was
much slower than in those starting with combination treat-
ment. There was no excess of withdrawals from treatment
in the combination treatment group; however, there were
more reports of symptoms suggesting hypotension on
combination therapy.
The implication of these findings is that new hyperten-
sive patients embarking on treatment with traditional mon-
otherapy will be exposed to higher pressures for longer
time periods than those initiated with combination treat-
ment. At a population level this clearly will increase risk of
major cardiovascular events.
PATHWAY 24 was designed to investigate optimal
treatment for patients with resistant hypertension.
Guidelines, notably the NICE Guidelines,5 provide treat-
ment algorithms for hypertensive patients which specify
the first three drugs (an angiotensin converting enzyme
inhibitor [ACEI], or an angiotensin receptor blocker
[ARB], a calcium channel blocker [CCB], and a thiazide-
like diuretic) together with recommendations for add-on
therapy for those who fail to achieve BP goals on three
drugs. There are, however, no trials of additional drug
treatment to provide insight into optimal treatment. This is

trials change the guidelines?

particularly important because there remain a substantial
number of resistant hypertensive patients at high residual
cardiovascular risk for whom there are no clear guidelines
for preferred treatment, but an increasing number of costly,
invasive interventions, advocated by many, but for which
there is doubtful objective evidence of real benefit.
PATHWAY 2 was a double-blind, placebo-controlled,
crossover study carried out in 348 hypertensive patients
receiving three antihypertensive drugs in optimal or best-
tolerated doses, and whose BP was uncontrolled (clinic
SBP > 140 mmHg, home SBP > 130 mmHg) following
observed drug ingestion and subsequent BP monitoring.
Patients received sequential treatment with spironolactone
(25-50 mg), bisoprolol (5-10 mg), doxazosin MR (4-8
mg) or placebo, assigned in random order, in addition to
their baseline treatment. Each cycle was for 12 weeks
duration with dose force titrated at six weeks. The hierar-
chical primary endpoints were the difference in home SBP
between spironolactone and placebo followed by the dif-
ference in home SBP between spironolactone and the aver-
age of the two other active drugs and finally the difference
in home SBP between spironolactone and each of the two
other active drugs.
Spironolactone was substantially more effective than
placebo (-8.70 mmHg), and significantly more effective
than doxazosin (-4.03 mmHg) or bisoprolol (-4.48 mmHg).
A critical finding in this trial was that spironolactone
controlled home SBP in almost 60% of patients (and an
even greater percentage if clinic pressures were used). In
addition, over 75% of patients had a > 10 mmHg reduction
in SBP.
These observations, in conjunction with the fact that BP
responses to spironolactone were inversely related to plasma
renin, confirm the view that sodium retention plays a major
role in the pathophysiology of resistant hypertension.
These results should be viewed in the context of the
many invasive intervention trials in so-called drug-resist-
ant hypertension, particularly in the light of the fact that
many recruits into these trials were not receiving or had
not received a trial of spironolactone.
In PATHWAY 2, concerns about hyperkalaemia with
spironolactone were not realized. Discontinuations due to
renal impairment, hyperkalaemia and gynaecomastia were
not increased in those assigned to spironolactone com-
pared with the other drugs.
PATHWAY 36 was designed to explore whether the
addition or substitution of a potassium-sparing diuretic
would prevent the glucose intolerance associated with a
thiazide diuretic and improve blood pressure control.
Many guidelines have advocated the use of low-dose thi-
azide diuretics in the treatment of hypertension yet the evi-
dence for cardiovascular event reduction was based on
trials of higher doses of thiazides, thiazide-like diuretics
(chlorthalidone, indapamide) or combinations of diuretics
such as hydrochlorothiazide (HCTZ)/amiloride.
The development of glucose intolerance associated
with thiazides appears linked to the development of
hypokalaemia, and PATHWAY 3 addressed this issue with
a comparison of the metabolic effects of a thiazide, ami-
loride and the combination.
Four hundred and forty-one hypertensive patients with
one component of the metabolic syndrome, on background
antihypertensive drugs requiring additional therapy, were
randomised to HCTZ 25 mg, amiloride 10 mg or the com-
bination of HCTZ 12.5 mg/amiloride 5 mg. Doses were
doubled after 12 weeks of treatment for a further 12 weeks.
The primary endpoint was the difference in blood glu-
cose measured two hours after a 75 g oral glucose load.
Secondary endpoints included differences in home SBP,
plasma electrolytes and renin.
Two-hour glucose rose on HCTZ, and fell on both ami-
loride and the combination. A greater fall in home SBP at
24 weeks treatment was seen on the combination (-19
mmHg), than either HCTZ (-14 mmHg) or amiloride (-16
mmHg) despite the combination being used in half the
doses of the individual components. Importantly serum
potassium fell on HCTZ, rose on amiloride and was
unchanged on the combination.
These observations clearly demonstrated that the glu-
cose intolerance associated with thiazides was closely
linked to hypokalaemia and could be abolished when the
thiazide was combined with amiloride. Given the well-
established benefits of the HCTZ/amiloride combination
on cardiovascular outcome reported in the Medical
Research Trial in Elderly Patients7 and the International
Nifedipine GITS Study Intervention as a Goal in
Hypertension Treatment (INSIGHT),8 PATHWAY 3 pro-
vides compelling evidence for this combination to replace
thiazide and thiazide-like diuretics in clinical practice, par-
ticularly in those patients at increased risk of developing
new-onset diabetes (NOD). No doubt some will argue that
NOD induced by thiazides does not carry the cardiovascu-
lar risk associated with non-drug-induced diabetes;9 how-
ever, this remains a highly controversial issue. Logic
surely dictates that if you can prevent major metabolic
consequences of a drug treatment by replacement with an
alternative that carries no such risk, and for which there is
excellent evidence for outcome benefits, a combination of
thiazide/amiloride should be the preferred choice diuretic
for most hypertensive patients.
These three trials were carried out over a period of five
years, in 12 secondary and two primary care centres in the
UK. All were part of a framework established by the BHS.
The working party was established to address a number of
important but unanswered questions in hypertension man-
agement at a time when most antihypertensive drug classes
were available in generic formulation and there seemed lit-
tle hope for industry sponsorship. In comparison with
industry-funded trials they were carried out at substan-
tially lower cost, despite the requirements for meeting the
Sever 3
demands of the drug regulatory bodies for trial oversight
and management. The trials were supported by a grant
from the British Heart Foundation and the UK National
Institute for Health Research through infrastructure sup-
port at regional level to the recruiting centres. The BHS
working party is now challenged with the design of and
funding for new studies to provide further insight into opti-
mal management of patients with hypertension.
One objective of the PATHWAY Programme of trials
was to provide an evidence base for new guidelines for the
management of hypertensive patients.
PATHWAY 2 clearly establishes the case for recom-
mending spironolactone as the optimal 4th line drug in
the treatment algorithm for patients with resistant hyper-
tensive patients, whilst PATHWAY 3 provides an impor-
tant insight into the different metabolic effects of the
diuretics commonly used in hypertension treatment
strategies and evidence for the benefits of a thiazide/
amiloride combination. In some respects the outcome of
PATHWAY 1 was disappointing in that the "never catch
up" hypothesis was refuted. Had it been upheld then
the case for initial combination therapy as opposed to
the more traditional monotherapy would have been a
powerful one. Nevertheless with increasing evidence
that failure to get to goal BP exposes patients to continu-
ing hypertensive risk of stroke and coronary heart dis-
ease events, PATHWAY 1 provides substantial evidence
that initial combination therapy achieves more rapid
blood pressure reduction safely and with the vast major-
ity of patients reaching target BP within a few weeks of
onset of treatment.

Systolic blood pressure intervention
trial: SPRINT
For more than a decade discussions have taken place on
the need for a trial designed to determine optimum systolic
treatment goals to prevent cardiovascular outcomes.
During the 20th century, treatment thresholds and targets
were set by diastolic pressure readings, largely dependent
on the historical focus of diastolic as the more important of
the two blood pressure readings, the fact that older inter-
vention trials in hypertension also used predominantly
diastolic thresholds and that guidelines had no hard evi-
dence base on which to recommend optimal systolic blood
pressure targets. Treatment trials in the elderly more
recently focused on systolic thresholds but there has been
no clear evidence that lowering systolic blood pressure
below 140-150 mmHg confers additional benefit in the
middle-aged and elderly population. Guidelines have,
however, consistently advocated a 140 mmHg target,
whilst admitting that the evidence base is lacking.
The dearth of new antihypertensive molecules and the
withdrawal by major pharma of investment in hyperten-
sion research has meant that new trials addressing impor-
tant unanswered questions about optimal treatment
strategies have been lacking. It was perhaps inevitable,
therefore, that the only independent funding body with
sufficient resources to fund a systolic pressure intervention
trial designed to ascertain optimal treatment targets was
the US National Heart Lung and Blood Institute and,
together with the coordinating committee, they are to be
congratulated for designing and conducting this long-
awaited trial.
SPRINT10 was an open label randomised parallel group
clinical trial carried out in approximately 100 sites in the
USA. Nine thousand, three hundred and sixty-one adults
aged 50 years or older with systolic blood pressure >130
mmHg and at least one additional cardiovascular risk fac-
tor were randomised to either intensive treatment designed
to achieve a systolic pressure of <120 mmHg, or less inten-
sive treatment with a goal of <140 mmHg (Figure 2). The
4 Journal of the Renin-Angiotensin-Aldosterone System
primary outcome was a combination of non-fatal myocar-
dial infarction, acute coronary syndrome, non-fatal stroke,
heart failure and cardiovascular death. Follow-up was
planned for a maximum of six years.
Systolic blood pressures at one year were 121.4 mmHg
in the intensive group and 136.2 in the standard treatment
group. The trial was stopped prematurely after 3.3 years
owing to a significant benefit in the primary endpoint (HR
0.75, CI 0.64-0.89, p<0.001). All-cause mortality was also
significantly reduced (HR 0.73, CI 0.60-0.90, p=0.003).
Serious adverse events, including hypotension, syncope
and renal complications were, however, increased in the
intensive treatment group.
These are extraordinary outcomes for a number of rea-
sons, the main reason being that the on-treatment analyses
reported by the Blood Pressure Treatment Trialists
Collaboration showed that in the non-diabetic hypertensive
population there was no additional cardiovascular benefit
from lowering systolic pressure below 140-150 mmHg.11
These data were based on observations on 125,000 trial
participants. This raises the question as to whether the
SPRINT population was different in any way from the
usual hypertensive population within this age group and,
more particularly, whether the SPRINT results can be
extrapolated to all hypertensives, particularly those with
much higher initial pressures, and those with diabetes.
One of the main concerns about the methodology used
in SPRINT was that blood pressure was measured in an
environment in which there was no doctor or nurse pre-
sent. This, more basal blood pressure, has been shown to
be equivalent to a routine clinic pressure of at least
10-15mm systolic higher - thus reflecting a benefit of
achieving a usual clinic blood pressure <140 mmHg, rather
than a blood pressure of <120 mmHg systolic !
On average, one additional drug was needed to achieve
the lower pressure targets. On the positive side the num-
bers needed to treat to prevent one primary outcome, death
from any cause and death from a cardiovascular cause dur-
ing the trial were 61, 90 and 172. On the other hand there
was a significant excess of hypotension, syncope, electro-
lyte disturbance and renal impairment in those assigned
intensive treatment. The population excluded those with
diabetes, who in the ACCORD trial12 did not benefit from
more intensive treatment, although in that trial, in a sub-
group analysis, there were some additional benefits of sys-
tolic pressure reduction to <120 mmHg.
Many patients in the standard care group in SPRINT
had antihypertensive drugs withdrawn in order to prevent
the achievement of lower systolic pressures and the conse-
quences of this practice are unknown.
Worldwide control of blood pressure in hypertensive
patients is very poor. In many countries more than 50% of
treated patients fail to be controlled to <140 mmHg systolic
pressure. Whilst there are many reasons for poor control, the
results of SPRINT should encourage physicians to focus on
systolic targets, rather than diastolic targets, and aim to
achieve control to at least 140 mmHg in the majority of their
patients using published treatment algorithms and await fur-
ther evidence of benefits of achieving lower targets.
As the SPRINT investigators advocate, it is vital to
assess achieved blood pressure comprehensively by multi-
ple measurements, ideally with home blood pressure
measurements or 24-hour ambulatory recordings. Single
clinic readings will grossly overestimate usual blood pres-
sure and aggressive therapy based on unrepresentative
readings of blood pressure could result in adverse conse-
quences of too low blood pressure.
SPRINT study design
Observations on the "J"-Curve
relationship
Several observational studies and updated meta-analyses
of the intervention trials in hypertension have been
published.13,14,15 These studies have addressed the issue as
to whether low levels of blood pressure, particularly dias-
tolic pressure, are associated with an increase in coronary
and other CV events. Most of these studies, both observa-
tional and interventional, have failed to show any evidence
for a "J"-curve relationship. However, a comprehensive
observational study in over 22,000 hypertensive patients
with established coronary disease, followed up over a
period of seven years, demonstrated that those with low
diastolic pressures had an increase in CHD events and all-
cause mortality, with a nadir of around 75 mmHg diastolic
pressure.16 Whilst these data are robust, the question is
whether the achievement of low diastolic pressures is a
treatment effect, or whether it is a phenomenon associated
with large artery pathology, an established marker for
CVD events, i.e. reverse causation.
Will the results of SPRINT influence
new guidelines for the management
of hypertension?
The current treatment targets for most hypertensive
patients is 140 mmHg systolic pressure - a goal that
remains elusive for most patients in clinical practice.
Figure 2. SPRINT study design.

Whilst in North America it is likely that the results of
SPRINT will be applied by many physicians to achieve
lower targets, it remains to be seen whether the US
Guidelines and new European Guidelines will urge cau-
tion based on a critical review of the blood pressure
assessment technique applied in SPRINT, and remain
more conservative in keeping with today's recommenda-
tion of a goal of <140 mmHg systolic. For those with
diabetes there is evidence that, for stroke, a lower sys-
tolic target of 130 mmHg is beneficial, but for other out-
comes there is no advantage below 140 mmHg. The
recent trials provide no new data for those with chronic
renal disease.
There remain many outstanding questions in relation to
optimal patient management in hypertension. Several tri-
als and observational studies have confirmed the impor-
tance of blood pressure variability, rather than achieved
mean blood pressure, as an important determinant of CV
outcome, including stroke and myocardial infarction.17,18,19
Moreover, it is clear that individual drugs have markedly
different effects on blood pressure variability and this may
be the underlying explanation for the benefits of the cal-
cium channel blocker regimen compared with the beta-
blocker regimen reported from ASCOT.3,20 No trials have
been designed prospectively to compare outcomes based
on blood pressure variability and, thus, the evidence base
required to influence future guidelines on blood pressure
variability is limited.
New guidelines should include a section on patient
adherence, which is a major problem in hypertension, par-
ticularly in those with treatment-resistant hypertension,
where as many as two thirds of patients are poorly adher-
ent to drug therapy.21
Whilst recent trials have contributed to our better
understanding of more optimal treatment strategies for
hypertensive patients, the healthcare costs to the commu-
nity associated with hypertension are largely influenced by
under-diagnosis and under-treatment. Unless a major
effort is taken to address these problems, hypertension will
remain a major contributor to poor health outcomes and a
substantial burden on healthcare costs.
