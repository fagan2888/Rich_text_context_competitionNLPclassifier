Long-Term Absolute Benefit of Lowering Blood Pressure in
Hypertensive Patients According to the JNC VI Risk Stratification
Lorraine G. Ogden, Jiang He, Eva Lydick, Paul K. Whelton
Abstract--Blood pressure (BP) levels alone have been traditionally used to make treatment decisions in patients with
hypertension. The sixth report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of
High Blood Pressure (JNC VI) recently recommended that risk strata, in addition to BP levels, be considered in the
treatment of hypertension. We estimated the absolute benefit associated with a 12 mm Hg reduction in systolic BP over
10 years according to the risk stratification system of JNC VI using data from the National Health and Nutrition
Examination Survey Epidemiologic Follow-up Study. The number-needed-to-treat to prevent a cardiovascular
event/death or a death from all causes was reduced with increasing levels of baseline BP in each of the risk strata. In
addition, the number-needed-to-treat was much smaller in persons with 1 additional major risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (risk group B) and in those with a history of cardiovascular disease or target organ damage (risk
group C) than in those without additional major risk factors for cardiovascular disease (risk group A). Specifically, the
number-needed-to-treat to prevent a death from all causes in patients with a high-normal BP, stage 1 hypertension, or
stage 2 or 3 hypertension was, respectively, 81, 60, and 23 for those in risk group A; 19, 16, and 9 for those in risk group
B; and 14, 12, and 9 for those in risk group C. Our analysis indicated that the absolute benefits of antihypertensive
therapy depended on BP as well as the presence or absence of additional cardiovascular disease risk factors and the
presence or absence of preexisting clinical cardiovascular disease or target organ damage. (Hypertension.

Key Words: blood pressure  cardiovascular diseases  mortality  risk factors
Hypertension is an important public health challenge in
the United States because of its high prevalence and the
concomitant increase in the risk of cardiovascular/renal dis-
ease. As many as 43 million Americans have hypertension,
which is defined as a systolic blood pressure (SBP)
140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic BP (DBP) 90 mm Hg
and/or taking antihypertensive medications.1 According to the
American Heart Association, in 1997, the estimated direct
health costs (physician or other healthcare provider visits,
hospital/nursing home stays, and antihypertensive medica-
tions) of the care of patients with hypertension in the United
States were $21.8 billion; the associated indirect costs (lost
productivity due to morbidity and mortality) were $8.2
billion.2 Moreover, hypertension is the most important mod-
ifiable risk factor for coronary heart disease (the leading
cause of death in the US population), stroke (the third leading
cause of death), congestive heart failure, end-stage renal
disease, and peripheral vascular disease.3­6
Prospective studies have repeatedly identified an increas-
ing risk of cardiovascular disease, stroke, and renal insuffi-
ciency with progressively higher levels of both SBP and
DBP.3­6 These studies have demonstrated a positive, contin-
uous, and independent association between BP and the
incidence of coronary heart disease, stroke, congestive heart
failure, and end-stage renal disease. They showed no evi-
dence of a J-shaped relationship or a threshold below which
increasing levels of BP are not associated with a correspond-
ing increase in the risk of stroke, coronary heart disease, and
renal disease. Furthermore, they suggest that the association
of SBP with these outcomes is stronger than that of DBP.
Randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated that antihy-
pertensive drug therapy reduces the risk of cardiovascular
disease and stroke among patients with mild hypertension.6­9
Traditionally, BP levels alone were used to make treatment
decisions in patients with hypertension. This approach was
based on the fact that elevated BP is an important indicator of
the relative risk of cardiovascular disease among groups. This
approach worked well for treatment decisions made in pa-
tients with moderate or more severe forms of hypertension
(stages 2 to 3), but it is less well suited for treatment decisions
in patients with milder elevations of BP. The recently
published sixth report of the Joint National Committee on the
Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High Blood
Pressure (JNC VI) emphasized the importance of absolute, as

first time, the JNC report presented a risk stratification system
that was based not only on an individual's average BP level, but
also on the presence or absence of target organ damage or other
risk factors.10 The objectives of our study were to evaluate the
absolute benefit derived from treating hypertension according to
the JNC VI risk stratification system using the National Health
and Nutrition Examination Survey I Epidemiologic Follow-up
Study (NHEFS) population.
Methods
Study Population
In the first National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES I), a multistage, stratified, probability sampling design
was used to select a representative sample of the US civilian
noninstitutionalized population aged 1 to 74 years.11,12 Certain
population subgroups, including those with a low income, women of
childbearing age (25 to 44 years), and elderly persons (65 years or
older) were oversampled. The NHEFS is a prospective cohort study
of NHANES I participants who were 25 to 74 years of age when the
survey was conducted (from 1971 to 1975).13­16 Of the 14 407
persons in this age range at baseline, 1473 were excluded because
they had taken antihypertensive medication within the preceding 6
months, and 306 were excluded because information on important
baseline covariables was missing. Of the remaining 12 628 partici-
pants, 359 (2.8%) were lost to follow-up, which left a total of 12 269
participants for inclusion in the current analysis.
Data Collection
Baseline data collection included information on medical history,
standardized medical examinations, dietary history, laboratory tests,
and anthropometric measurements.11,12 At the beginning of the
baseline physical examination, a physician measured BP once with
the examinee seated. With few exceptions, a standard mercury
sphygmomanometer and a cuff that was at least 20% wider than the
diameter of the arm (13 cm or 9.5 cm) was used to measure the
participant's BP level. American Heart Association guidelines were
followed. Blood samples were obtained, and frozen serum was sent
to the Centers for Disease Control for the determination of serum
total cholesterol. The baseline questionnaire on medical history
included questions about selected health conditions and medications
used for these conditions during the preceding 6 months. Baseline
information on smoking status was obtained in a random subsample
of 6142 participants who underwent more detailed baseline exami-
nation.11,12 For the remaining study participants, information on
smoking status at baseline was derived from responses to questions
on lifetime smoking history that were obtained during follow-up
interviews in 1982 to 1984 or later.17,18 The validity of information
obtained using this approach has been documented.17,18
Follow-up data were collected between 1982 and 1984, and in
1986, 1987, and 1992.13­16 In preparation for each follow-up
examination, a participant or his/her proxy was tracked to a current
address. The examination included an in-depth interview with the
participant or proxy. In addition, relevant hospital and nursing home
records were obtained, including pathology reports and electrocar-
diograms. A death certificate was requested for all decedents.
Mortality from cardiovascular disease was based on death certificate
reports. Incident cardiovascular disease was based on documentation
of an event that met prespecified study criteria and occurred during
the period between the participant's baseline examination and the
last follow-up interview. The validity of study outcome data from
both sources has been documented.19
Cause-specific mortality was identified by means of underlying
cause of death reports using the following codes from the Interna-
tional Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision: 410 to 414
(coronary heart disease), 430 to 438 (stroke), and 390 to 459
(cardiovascular disease). A new cardiovascular disease event was
based on a death certificate report in which the underlying cause of
death was recorded as code 390 to 459 or as 1 hospital and/or
nursing home stays in which the participant had a discharge
diagnosis with a code of 390 to 459.
Risk Stratification
Risk of cardiovascular disease in hypertensive patients is determined
by the BP level and the presence or absence of target organ damage
or other risk factors, such as cigarette smoking, dyslipidemia, and
diabetes. The JNC VI report recommended a risk stratification
system that is based on 3 categories of BP and 3 risk groups (A, B,
and C).10 The 3 BP categories (SBP/DBP) are as follows: high-
normal (130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg), stage 1 hypertension (140 to
159/90 to 99 mm Hg), and stages 2 or 3 hypertension (160/
100 mm Hg). Risk group A includes patients who do not have
clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage, or other car-
diovascular disease risk factors. Risk group B includes patients who
do not have clinical cardiovascular disease, target organ damage, or
diabetes but who do have 1 other cardiovascular disease risk
factor, such as smoking, dyslipidemia, age60 years, male sex,
postmenopausal status (in women), or a family history of cardiovas-
cular disease. Risk group C includes patients with diabetes mellitus,
clinically manifest cardiovascular disease, or target organ damage.10
In the present analysis, risk group B included men, postmenopausal
women, or those who were 60 years of age, current smokers, or
had a serum total cholesterol 240 mg/dL. Risk group C included
participants who had a self-reported history of diabetes, heart attack,
heart failure, stroke, or renal disease or who had evidence of these
conditions during their baseline examination.
Statistical Analysis
Poisson regression analysis was used to model the relationship
between SBP and mortality from all-cause or cardiovascular dis-
eases. Categorization and quadratic terms were used to test the
linearity of log mortality on SBP. In addition, the differences in
regression coefficients of log mortality on SBP among the 4 BP
categories (130/85 mm Hg, 130 to 139/85 to 89 mm Hg, 140 to
159/90 to 99 mm Hg, and 160 bpm/100 mm Hg) were tested by
using interaction terms. Because no evidence of deviation from
linearity or of interaction among the different levels of BP existed, an
overall model was used for each outcome. Risk differences among
the 3 groups were modeled using separate intercepts and interaction
terms. SBP levels were centralized to their mean value before
performing regression analyses to stabilize the estimates of regres-
sion coefficients on total and cardiovascular mortality and cardio-
vascular incidence. The Poisson regression models for cumulative
log mortality (event rate) over a 10-year period were as follows:
Total Mortality3.6517(1.8379risk group B)
(2.4632risk group C)[0.0343(SBP132)]
[0.0133(SBP132)risk group B]
[0.0179(SBP132)risk group C]
Cardiovascular Mortality5.7325(3.0247risk group B)
(3.9434risk group C)
[0.0613(SBP132)]
[0.0342(SBP132)risk group B]
[0.0434(SBP132)risk group C]
Cardiovascular Event Rate2.3035(0.9649risk group B)

[0.0285(SBP132)]
[0.0080(SBP132)risk group B]
[0.0131(SBP132)risk group C]
To estimate the absolute reduction in the risk of mortality associated
with a 12 mm Hg drop in SBP over a 10-year period of follow-up
among the 9 groups defined by different BP levels and cardiovascular
disease risk, we first calculated the 10-year probability of death using
observed data from the NHEFS population. We then calculated the
540 Hypertension February 2000
10-year probability of death for each participant assuming a 12 mm Hg
reduction in SBP throughout the period. The difference between the 2
probabilities represents the reduction in absolute risk that could be
expected from a 12 mm Hg reduction in SBP. The number-needed-to-
treat was calculated by taking the reciprocal of the absolute reduction in
risk, which represents the number of patients who would have to be
treated to prevent 1 outcome event. The number-needed-to-treat is a
useful way of expressing the degree of benefit that can be expected from
a healthcare intervention.20,21 To correct for regression dilution bias, we
calculated the coefficient of reliability using BP measurements at
baseline and at the 10-year follow-up examination.
Results
Table 1 shows the distribution of the 7090 NHEFS partici-
pants who had high-normal BP or hypertension according to
their baseline level of BP and category of presumed cardio-
vascular risk. Slightly less than a third of the participants
(27.9%) had high-normal BP, 43.3% had stage 1 hyperten-
sion, and 29.3% had stage 2 or 3 hypertension. A small
minority (9.0%) of the study participants had no other risk
factors for cardiovascular disease and no evidence of target
organ damage or clinical cardiovascular disease (risk group
A). The vast majority, however, had 1 other risk factor for
cardiovascular disease (71.7%; risk group B), and a substan-
tial minority had a current history of diabetes or of other
cardiovascular or renal diseases (19.2%; risk group C).
The number-needed-to-treat to prevent a cardiovascular dis-
ease event, with or without correction for regression dilution
bias, is presented in Table 2. The number was determined using
an average reduction of 12 mm Hg in SBP over 10 years of
follow-up. As expected, the number was reduced with increasing
levels of baseline BP in each of the risk groups. The number-
needed-to-treat was also smaller among persons who had major
risk factors or who had a history of cardiovascular diseases (risk
groups B and C) compared with their counterparts in risk group
A, who did not have additional risk factors for cardiovascular
disease. For example, to prevent a cardiovascular event, the
number-needed-to-treat for high-normal BP, stage 1 hyperten-
sion, or stage 2 or 3 hypertension, respectively, was 25, 20, and
10 in risk group A; 13, 11, and 7 in risk group B; and 10, 9, and
8 in risk group C.
The number-needed-to-treat to prevent a cardiovascular death
was also reduced with increasing levels of baseline BP in each of
the risk groups (Table 3). However, this reduction was particu-
larly prominent in those without a major risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease (risk group A). In this group, the number-
needed-to-treat was 486 for persons with high-normal BP, 273
for those with stage 1 hypertension, and 34 for their counterparts
with stage 2 or 3 hypertension. The number-needed-to-treat to
prevent a cardiovascular death was much smaller among persons
with major risk factors or with a history of cardiovascular
diseases (risk groups B and C) than in those who did not have
additional risk factors for cardiovascular disease (risk group A).
For example, the number-needed-to-treat for persons with high-
normal BP, stage 1 hypertension, or stage 2 or 3 hypertension,
respectively, was 36, 27, and 12 for risk group B and 21, 18, and
11 for risk group C.
The number-needed-to-treat to prevent a death from all
causes is presented in Table 4. In each of the risk groups, the
number-needed-to-treat was reduced with increasing levels of
baseline BP. In addition, the number was much smaller in
persons who had 1 additional major risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease (risk group B) and in those with a history of
cardiovascular disease or target organ damage (risk group C)
than in those in risk group A. Specifically, the number-
needed-to-treat for persons with high-normal BP, stage 1
hypertension, or stage 2 or 3 hypertension, respectively, was
81, 60, and 23 for those in risk group A; 19, 16, and 9 for those
in risk group B; and 14, 12, and 9 for those in risk group C.
Discussion

most are asymptomatic. The main objective in lowering BP is
to reduce the patient's absolute risk of premature death and
disease, primarily by reducing their risk of cardiovascular
diseases. In the US, 13% and 14% of the adult population,
respectively, has high-normal BP or stage 1 hypertension.1 In
contrast, only 4% and 1% of the adult population, respec-
tively, has stages 2 to 3 hypertension.1 Epidemiological
studies and randomized trials have repeatedly demonstrated
that the relative risk of cardiovascular disease increases
continuously with increasing levels of BP.3­9 However, no
specific BP level identifies the need for antihypertensive
treatment in an individual patient. We compared the expected
absolute benefits of BP lowering in the patients in the 9
groups characterized by baseline BP level and cardiovascular
disease risk. Our results indicate that the clinical decision to
treat high BP should be based on a person's average BP levels
as well as on the presence or absence of other cardiovascular
disease risk factors.
An important strength of our study is that we were able to
calculate the number-needed-to-treat to prevent an event
using a large representative sample of the US general popu-
lation. An additional strength was that the outcomes of
interest (cardiovascular and total mortality) were assessed
over a prolonged period of follow-up, which averaged 20
years. A 12 mm Hg reduction in SBP was chosen as the
treatment effect of interest because it represents the average
BP reduction that has been achieved in the major randomized
controlled trials that have been conducted to determine the
efficacy of antihypertensive drug treatment in reducing car-
diovascular disease risk.6 If a larger reduction in SBP were
achieved in hypertensive patients, a greater benefit on mor-
bidity and mortality might be observed. Likewise, the BP-
lowering benefit might be increased with more prolonged
treatment for hypertension than was the case in the databases
we used. Previous analyses have indicated that the reduction
in stroke risk observed in clinical trials is similar to that
expected on the basis of the risk associated with high BP in
observational studies.3,7 However, the reduction in risk for
coronary heart disease in clinical trials is less than expected
when based on results from observational studies. One
explanation for the latter discrepancy is that the clinical trials
from which the estimates of coronary heart disease risk
reduction were derived had a much shorter average duration
(3 to 5 years) than the corresponding experience in observa-
tional studies (10 years).
Our analysis supports the JNC VI recommendation to
prescribe drug treatment as the initial therapy in patients with
stages 2 to 3 hypertension and in those who have lower BP
levels when these persons have diabetes, target organ disease,
or cardiovascular disease.10 Moreover, our results suggest that
treatment of those with high-normal BP or stage 1 hypertension
who concurrently have 1 other major risk factor for cardio-
vascular disease is cost-effective. In such patients, the number-
needed-to-treat was similar to that noted in their counterparts
with stages 2 to 3 hypertension who did not have an additional
major risk factor for cardiovascular disease.
Only a minority (9.0%) of those with a high-normal BP or
hypertension did not have additional risk factors for cardio-
vascular disease. The number-needed-to-treat was high in this
group, especially in persons with high-normal BP or stage 1
hypertension. Therefore, lifestyle modification may provide a
more meaningful approach for lowering BP in this group.
Overall, antihypertensive treatment is a cost-effective ap-
proach to the reduction of cardiovascular disease and total
mortality compared with the treatment of other cardiovascu-
lar disease risk factors. For example, pooling the experience
of the 5 major trials evaluating the 3-hydroxy-3-
methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase inhibitors indicated

that an average decrease of 20% in total serum cholesterol
and of 28% in LDL cholesterol was associated with an
absolute risk reduction of 14 deaths from cardiovascular
disease and 16 deaths from all causes per 1000 persons
treated over the 5-year follow-up period.22 Therefore, the
number-needed-to-treat to prevent a death over 10 years of
follow-up would likely be 35 for mortality from cardiovas-
cular diseases and 30 for mortality from all causes. On the
basis of our analysis, the number-needed-to-treat to prevent
mortality from cardiovascular disease or all causes in patients
with stages 2 to 3 hypertension or in patients with high-
normal BP or hypertension who had 1 other major risk
factor for cardiovascular disease or a prior history of cardio-
vascular disease is similar or even lower. Results from the
recently published UK Prospective Diabetes Study indicate
that the number-needed-to-treat to prevent 1 death related to
diabetes is 15 for an average reduction in SBP/DBP of
10/5 mm Hg over 10 years among type 2 diabetic patients
with hypertension.23 The benefit of BP control may be greater
than blood-glucose control among these patients.23,24
In our study participants, only a single BP measurement
was obtained at the baseline examination. This imperfect
measurement of BP might have resulted in a misclassification
of our study participants into the different BP categories and
a consequent dilution of our estimates of absolute risk.
Because of this, we entered SBP as a continuous variable in
the risk equations to avoid estimating absolute risk based on
BP category. Furthermore, a repeated measurement of BP at
the 10-year follow-up was used to correct for the possibility
of regression dilution bias. These strategies should have
minimized the potential for bias due to imperfections in the
measurement of BP at the baseline examination.
In conclusion, our analysis demonstrates that the absolute
benefits of antihypertensive therapy depend not only on BP
but also on the presence or absence of additional cardiovas-
cular disease risk factors and the presence or absence of
preexisting clinical cardiovascular disease or target organ
damage. These findings have important implications for
clinical practice and public health. To make an informed
decision regarding the wisdom of initiating antihypertensive
drug treatment for high BP, the practicing clinician must
assess the absolute risk of an individual patient by determin-
ing the presence or absence of other cardiovascular disease
risk factors and the presence or absence of clinical cardio-
vascular disease or target organ damage. To improve the
cost-effectiveness of antihypertensive interventions in com-
munity programs, an emphasis should be placed on targeting
high-risk populations. Our study also suggests that a need
exists for more aggressive BP lowering among those with
high-normal or stage 1 hypertension who concurrently have
1 additional major risk factors for cardiovascular disease.
