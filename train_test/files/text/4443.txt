The 21st century has brought dramatic growth in demand for
foreign language courses for specific professional groups.
More than 30% of hiring managers planned to increase hir-
ing of bilingual businessmen, engineers, and medical person-
nel in 2006 (Lorenz, 2007). Traditionally, we have looked to
academia to train and evaluate speakers of foreign languages.
The problem is that academia has traditionally not done a
very good job in training the populace to communicate in
foreign languages (Jenkins, 2006). The need for foreign lan-
guage instruction that is not general in nature is evidenced in
professional areas such as engineering and medicine. A good
general knowledge of the target language does not necessar-
ily enable professionals to use the foreign language in spe-
cific areas key to the specialty (Dlaska, 1997). Technical and
subtechnical vocabulary needed by professionals is rarely
encountered in university foreign language classrooms
(Douglas, 2000; Nation, 2001). In particular, doctors and
other medical professionals in the United States have found
that general Spanish knowledge does not always equip them
with the vocabulary necessary for communicating with their
patients (Burbano-O'Leary, Federico, & Hampers, 2003).
Such a need has motivated a growing number of medical
schools and continuing education programs to offer Medical
Spanish courses (Binder et al., 1988; Frasier, Davalos,
Nusbaum, & Skinner, 2005; Prince & Nelson, 1995).
Unfortunately, research describing the benefits of such pro-
grams is limited. However, Clapham (1996) has indicated
that university students learn a foreign language faster in the
area of their expertise. As the area of foreign language learn-
ing for professional purposes is relatively new, approaches to
maximize acquisition of language for specific purposes
(LSP) within these generally short courses have not yet been
fully described.

Influence of Native Language Vocabulary
and Topic Knowledge on Foreign
Language Vocabulary Learning in Health
Care Providers
Marcia Foresee Drumhiller1,2 and Paula J. Schwanenflugel1
Abstract
Adults attending short, language for specific purpose courses may have expertise not utilized in general foreign language
courses. The present study investigates two factors that may influence the acquisition of medical Spanish vocabulary in such
persons: native English vocabulary size and topic knowledge. Forty-four health care workers attended 12 hr of medical
Spanish instruction. Prior to instruction, the Nelson­Denny Vocabulary Test, a Medical Spanish vocabulary test, and an
English Medical Terminology Test (an indicator of topic knowledge) were administered. The Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test
was readministered at posttest. Individually, both English medical terminology knowledge and English vocabulary size were
significant predictors of medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition, but English medical terminology knowledge explained most
of the variance in medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition. The results are discussed in terms of the impact of expert memory
organization on the ability to learn new labels in a second language. A curricular shift toward content-centered vocabulary in
language for specific purpose courses may be advantageous for some groups of foreign language learners.

The Role of Native Language
Vocabulary in Foreign Language
Vocabulary Acquisition
Word knowledge is an essential component of communica-
tion, important for production and comprehension of lan-
guage (Coady & Huckin, 1997). Language has been
characterized as an amalgam of vocabulary and grammar
(Lewis, 1997) that is combined with factors such as context,
strategic and background knowledge, and pragmatics
(Douglas, 2000). Vocabulary has been shown to be a good
predictor of reading success (Laufer, 1991). Carver (1994)
observed that if the proportion of unknown words in texts is
too high, comprehension is disrupted. Probably more impor-
tant to those who most often communicate orally, Nation
(2001) posited that learners who listen need to know at least
95% of the words in oral input to have reasonable success at
guessing from context. In fact, the theorists Dubin and
Olshtain (1986) have postulated that possessing a good
stock of vocabulary is what enables many learners to use
their knowledge of language effectively and in ways that fit
their specific needs. Vocabulary's importance to the typical
language learner cannot be overlooked (Coady & Huckin,
1997; De Bot, Lowie, & Verspoor, 2005; Thierry, Vihman,
& Roberts, 2003). Thus, it makes sense that the ability to
communicate in a second language depends upon vocabu-
lary also.
As the learner increases his foreign language vocabulary
knowledge, both the learner's native and second language
vocabulary base may facilitate the learning of new words.
The facilitating effect on second language vocabulary acqui-
sition has been attributed to shared storage in long-term
memory. The second language version is stored in the same
concept representation as the native vocabulary equivalent or
connected adjacent to that representation affording econo-
mies of time and effort in language acquisition (Kroll & de
Groot, 1997). Having a large vocabulary size appears to
afford an advantage for adult foreign language learners, as
they do not need to expend much effort on organizing the
conceptual component of new vocabulary in memory. A fur-
ther advantage of the established native vocabulary for lin-
guistically related languages may be that it can expedite the
entry of certain words which are similar in form and meaning
(cognates) into the vocabulary base.
Recently, researchers have been in nearly uniform agree-
ment that native language is the foundation upon which the
second language is built, an idea popularized by Cummins's
(1981) Linguistic Coding Differences Hypothesis. Cummins
noted that elementary school bilingual children learned
English only as well as they knew their native language.
Since then, the relationship between the first and second lan-
guages has been shown in diverse groups, including adults
(Nation, 2001). Therefore, second language researchers have
investigated a number of factors contributing to native lan-
guage acquisition: word memory, phonological memory,
background knowledge, and the recognition of grammar.
These have been found to hold true for second language
acquisition as well (De Bot et al., 2005; Nation, 2001).
Native language may facilitate second language vocabu-
lary acquisition through a number of routes. One is through
perception of word forms. Gathercole and Baddeley (1993)
have suggested that having a large vocabulary would
enhance phonological skill by increasing the number of
approximations to unfamiliar words in memory. Large
native vocabularies in languages such as English include
loan or root words that are written or pronounced in a simi-
lar enough manner as to aid acquisition of a second lan-
guage vocabulary. Thus, language learners who have a
large volume of word representations offered by ortho-
graphic and phonologic exemplars in the native language
are able to use these to assist in their acquisition of a second
language vocabulary.
Another route through which native language vocabulary
may influence vocabulary acquisition is through the ability
to identify those words possessing conceptual/vocabulary
equivalents already in long-term memory and storing the
new versions in the same or adjacent to the native concept.
Indeed, recent models of bilingual memory posit that words
in both languages are located in a shared conceptual memory
(Kroll & de Groot, 1997). In such a model, it is predicted that
vocabulary development in a second language would be
more efficient for concepts already created in the native lan-
guage. Thus, acquisition of a new second language word
would simply involve relabeling rather than constructing
new concepts. In sum, native vocabulary facilitates second
language acquisition by circumventing the need for concept
formation.
Some research demonstrates the facilitative effect of first
language vocabulary on second language acquisition in gen-
eral. Proctor, August, Carlo, and Snow (2006), in studying
English reading comprehension in 135 Spanish­English
bilingual fourth-grade students, found faster English reading
by those children who had more Spanish vocabulary knowl-
edge. A study by Sparks et al. (1997) of intermediate high
school students studying in foreign language study showed
that native language vocabulary as assessed by the Peabody
Picture Vocabulary Test (PPVT-R; Dunn & Dunn, 1981) was
a significant predictor, actually a better predictor, of overall
proficiency than the Modern LanguageAptitude Test (Carroll
& Sapon, 1959). Masoura and Gathercole (1999) found that,
once nonword repetition ability (a measure of phonological
memory) was controlled for, acquisition of foreign language
words was associated with native language vocabulary size.
It is clear, then, that native language vocabulary itself con-
tributes to foreign language acquisition, but its role in facili-
tating the acquisition of foreign language vocabulary per se
has not been distinctly established. For example, native lan-
guage vocabulary may not have as much of a facilitative
effect when the two languages are linguistically distinct
(Kahn-Horwitz, Shimron, & Sparks, 2005).

LSP
Specific-purpose language learners are distinct in their need
for low-frequency vocabulary and subtechnical (formal
vocabulary as in academics) and their depth of content
knowledge in a specific realm. It has been said that LSP rep-
resent the interaction of language ability and background
knowledge (Douglas, 2000). Second language learning tradi-
tionally covers a broad curriculum, characterized by the use
of high-frequency words applicable to general communica-
tions. However, the focus on high-frequency vocabulary in
the second language is not adequate for optimal functioning
in most professional endeavors. Professionally specific
vocabulary is needed as well. Furthermore, while traditional
foreign language instruction does not provide appropriate
vocabulary for learners for specific purposes, it also ignores
the relative benefits of conceptual and topic knowledge
which distinguishes the special purposes learner.
The potential advantage of capitalizing on the conceptual
nature of professional vocabulary words and their related
topic knowledge in instruction has been supported by a num-
ber of studies. Ganschow, Sparks, Javorsky, Pohlman, and
Bishop-Marbury (1991) showed that adults who are poor
foreign language learners access semantic representations of
target words in their knowledge base to aid in foreign lan-
guage acquisition. Furthermore, Lin (2003) has observed
that the understanding of technical words facilitates English
acquisition in Chinese university. Thus, both specific vocab-
ulary knowledge and topic knowledge may be helpful and
needed to expeditiously acquire a second language for spe-
cific purposes. While language ability in general has been
highly researched, its relationship to background knowledge
and expertise has not.
Topic Knowledge and Expertise
Vocabulary knowledge and topic knowledge are related
(Bedard & Chi, 1992). For example, it is not unusual in a
beginning science course for teachers to instruct the vocabu-
lary in an area to promote understanding of topic knowledge.
A specific concept is delineated in identifying those critical
features that make each word unique. In addition to the con-
vergence of specific semantic features, each word is situated
in an organized vocabulary base in experts.
The conceptual linkages have been characterized as inter-
acting knowledge structures stored in long-term memory,
called schemata (Rumelhart & Ortony, 1977). These "build-
ing blocks of cognition" are the framework to which new
information is linked (Rumelhart, 1980). They have been
shown to guide comprehension and interpretation of events
and their linguistic (oral and written) interpretation (Carrell,
1983).Whereas a disorganized conceptual schema will
impede word retrieval (Crutcher, 1998), related schemas of
associated words in a knowledge base will facilitate retrieval
(Baddeley, 1990; Bedard & Chi, 1992). Schemata triggered
by oral or written communication guide the listener as to
how he should construct the intended meaning from his or
her own previously acquired knowledge (Carrell, 1983).
Topic vocabulary can trigger conceptual knowledge, or sche-
mata in experts, making it no surprise that researchers have
chosen topic vocabulary knowledge as an indication of
expertise (Johnston, 1984).
The influence of topic knowledge on the learning of
domain-related vocabulary in the native language was stud-
ied directly by De Marie,Aloise-Young, Prideaux, Muransky-
Doran, and Gerda (2004) in undergraduate education and
business majors. Students were asked to recall three lists of
20 general, education, and business terms. They were then
categorized according to the number of courses students had
completed in one of three majors. The greater number of
courses taken in the domain predicted vocabulary recall of
domain-related words. It makes sense that topic knowledge
would be related to the acquisition of new second language
vocabulary as well.
A Specific Case of LSP: Medical Spanish
Learning and the Current Study
The acquisition of medical Spanish affords an opportunity
to study facilitated foreign language acquisition as well as
acquisition of LSP. It is known that first language vocabu-
lary predicts second language vocabulary acquisition, but it
is unclear how important first language vocabulary is to the
learning of a second language vocabulary in contrast to
other contributing factors such as general topic knowledge
and expertise. The role of topic knowledge and expertise in
the acquisition of a second language is unknown. Learners
of foreign languages for professional purposes possess
vocabulary-related advantages over other learners. First,
many students of science already know words similar to
target language words in their native language and they
may have topic knowledge that will allow them to supply
meaning when vocabulary is unknown. Second, as edu-
cated people, medical professionals are likely to have rea-
sonably good native language vocabulary skills that they
can bring to the acquisition of a second language, which has
shown to be influential by previous research. Therefore,
this article studies the acquisition of medical Spanish
vocabulary in health care providers to address the follow-
ing questions:
1. Is there a relationship between the vocabulary size of
the adult learner whose native language is English
and his or her ability to acquire beginning medical
Spanish vocabulary?
2. Is there a relationship between the topic knowledge
of an English-speaking health care professional and
his ability to acquire beginning medical Spanish
vocabulary?
4 SAGE Open
3. Is topic knowledge or native language vocabulary
more important in the acquisition of medical Spanish
by English speakers? Do the two interact to produce
better medical Spanish vocabulary learning?
In this study, employees of medical and public health
facilities who wanted to acquire some basic facility in medi-
cal Spanish took a short course in medical Spanish.
Participants were given a standardized test of English vocab-
ulary to assess the extent to which general English vocabu-
lary size predicted their Spanish vocabulary acquisition
outcome. They also were given a medical terminology test in
English to measure their background knowledge in medi-
cine. Finally, they were given a pretest and posttest of medi-
cal Spanish vocabulary to measure their medical Spanish
vocabulary acquisition. In this way, we were able to contrast
the relative contributions of specific topic knowledge and
general English vocabulary on the acquisition of medical
Spanish vocabulary.
Method
Participants
The present study included 44 employees of two public
health departments and one university hospital in Georgia.
All individuals were native speakers of English between 18
and 64 years of age (90% female). According to a question-
naire completed at the beginning of the study, most had some
previous Spanish language classroom experience, but not all.
Some, but not the majority, had previous experience with
Spanish-speaking patients. The majority of the employees
were medical professionals as nurses and nutritionists but
many also held clerical and technical positions. Of the sam-
ple, 13.6% completed high school, 27.3% either completed
their associate degree or some college, 27.3% received their
bachelor's degree, and 31.8% had postbaccalaureate gradu-
ate or professional training. Forty-eight percent had no for-
mal schooling in Spanish (M = 1.40, SD = 1.78; range = 0-7
years), and 33% had no formal foreign language experience
(M = 2.64, SD = 1.81; range = 0-7 years).
Participants were volunteers recruited through public
health and hospital system Internet announcements. The
courses were free to all participants, and major incentives for
attending the class included enhanced job performance, con-
tinuing education credit, and personal enrichment.
Materials and Procedures
Participant testing and instruction occurred in rooms desig-
nated by the institutions for instruction. Participants attended
at least 8 class sessions out of 10 offered over a period of 5 to
6 weeks with total instructional time totaling 12 hr. The
English vocabulary skill test and medical Spanish vocabu-
lary pretest were administered before the 1st hour of
instruction, and the medical terminology test within the 1st
hour of instruction. The instructor administered the medical
Spanish vocabulary posttest on the final day of instruction.
Students had as much time as needed to complete the test,
which took approximately 20 min.
Classes were taught by the first author, an instructor of
medical Spanish for more than 10 years who had advanced
training in a health allied discipline and who is a certified
medical interpreter. Classes generally began with the presen-
tation of Spanish vocabulary by the instructor. Students were
given two to three vocabulary lists of approximately 40
words total which they pronounced as a class. One list of 15
infinitives used in health care settings was first presented.
Later, a list of nouns and adjectives/adverbs/prepositions
used in health care was presented. The instructor subse-
quently supplied the meaning if no student volunteered it.
Next, students were asked to translate five to eight English
sentences containing those words in written and then oral
format as a class. A grammar sheet covering the immediate
future, present, or past perfect tense, requiring approximately
20 min to complete, was given to students on 5 days of the
course. In general, only first- and third-person plural com-
munications were presented. Classes emphasized medical
Spanish listening and speaking skills, with vocabulary intro-
duction involving the learners writing Spanish equivalents of
English words separately or in short phrases.
Assessments. There were three main assessments of interest
in the study: (a) the Nelson­Denny Vocabulary Test, which
served as a measure of English vocabulary skill; (b) the Med-
ical Terminology Test, which served as a measure of medical
background knowledge; and (c) the Medical Spanish Test, an
experimenter-constructed test. The vocabulary assessments
were as follows:
a.
Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test. Medical Spanish
vocabulary can vary depending upon the specificity of
the topic and its intended use. The professional status
of medical Spanish interlocutors determines whether
the vocabulary required is highly technical or merely
subtechnical. Similarly, as speech tends to be less for-
mal than text, the vocabulary requirements of conver-
sation are less technical than those that may be read.
Salager (1983), in analyzing a 100,000-word written
Medical English corpus, made three divisions in med-
ical English vocabulary-- basic English, fundamental
medical English, and specialized medical English.
Unfortunately, no such corpus exists for oral medical
English. Given the greater degree of informality in
spoken language and the diminished need for techni-
cal (highly specialized medical) words when patient­
health provider conversations are the focus, the
heaviest vocabulary requirement is for semitechnical
(fundamental medical) words. Accordingly, because
the purpose of the course was for medical
Drumhiller and Schwanenflugel 5
professionals to be better able to communicate with
patients, the Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test empha-
sized subtechnical words. All Medical Spanish
Vocabulary Test words were taught explicitly by the
instructor (the first author) during the course.
Because medical, oral Spanish has not been well
researched, we relied on research on written technical com-
munication, professionals functioning in the health care
domain, and general oral Spanish in formulating the Medical
Spanish Vocabulary Test. Nation (2001) identified technical
vocabulary words as those not normally found in other
domains or found more frequently in a particular domain
than elsewhere that are particularly useful for communica-
tion in the domain. This technical vocabulary, he suggests,
should be composed after consulting domain area experts.
Thus, first, to create a medical Spanish vocabulary list, we
composed a list of 300 words found in four currently used
medical Spanish texts and translated these terms into English.
We then asked 20 nurses and medical students to rate their
importance to communication with patients on a scale of 1 to
5 with 1 being the most important. Next, all words with a
mean rating of 3 or higher were selected to form a pool of
potential test words, yielding approximately 200 medically
related words. Only words that were not in the top 2,000
most frequent words in Spanish according to Davies (2005)
were considered technical or subtechnical medical Spanish
words to be used in this list. This list would later be used as
a repository from which to select relatively technical and
general vocabulary words for the Medical Spanish Test and
for instruction. Forty-nine of these important, low-frequency
medical Spanish terms were included in the Medical Spanish
Vocabulary Test.
The number of items was kept low as to not overwhelm
initial students in testing. To communicate, however, it is
important to have nontechnical as well technical words in
one's vocabulary. Nation (2001) suggested that the 2,000
most frequent words of a language be acquired prior to
studying technical vocabulary in a foreign language.
Commonly occurring words found in medical Spanish text-
books that occurred among the Davies (2005) list of 2,000
most common words were also selected for the assessment.
Fifty randomly chosen items from this list of common words
were included in the Medical Spanish Vocabulary Test.
Expertise in a foreign language may be demonstrated by
the ability to produce communications through expressive
vocabulary. Accordingly, the Medical Spanish Test used in
this study (Appendix A) required the students to produce a
Spanish translation of their English equivalent. The Medical
Spanish Vocabulary Test was administered prior to and at the
end of the course, and took approximately 25 min to
complete.
b.
English Vocabulary Skill Test. Because the learner
population ranged from high school graduates to
employees with graduate degrees, the Nelson­Denny
English Vocabulary Test, Form G (Brown, Fishco, &
Hanna, 1993b) was given as a measure of English
vocabulary skill. This instrument is designed for sec-
ondary students and adults and is widely used in
diverse settings to measure native English vocabulary
knowledge. Test scale reliability ranges from .88 to
.95 according to the test manual (Brown, Fishco, &
Hanna, 1993a). The test includes 80 words and pos-
sible definitions presented in a multiple-choice for-
mat with five possible responses. It was administered
immediately prior to the first class session.
Participants were given 25 min to complete the test,
as directed by the test manual.
c.
Medical Terminology Test. To determine the extent of
medical topic knowledge in these public health
employees, a medical terminology test was adminis-
tered prior to instruction in medical Spanish. The test
(Appendix B) consisted of 50 items drawn from
Glossary of Technical and Popular Medical Terms in
English (1995). The first and fifth entries from each
of 26 lists were selected, omitting words with multi-
ple meanings or that were closely related. Students
were asked to supply English written definitions for
each single English medical term. Students were also
asked to use the word in a sentence and this sentence
was used in cases where the definition was not clear.
Correct responses by the students were recorded, and
medical background was determined by a continuum
of scores from 0 to 50.
Results
Each test was graded against a key and the raw score totals
on each instrument were calculated. Bivariate scatterplots
were examined for outliers. Furthermore, studentized residu-
als, Df Betas, and Cook's D were calculated to identify outli-
ers. Those residuals greater than 3.3 were considered to be
outliers. Only one outlier was omitted from the data. Another
participant was missing the medical English test and was
also dropped from the analysis. Table 1 shows the descriptive
statistics for the variables in the study. Table 2 shows the
Pearson correlation matrix for all variables in the study.
Descriptive statistics of the student scores on the tests reveal
the heterogeneity of the study population in all but medical
background. No excessive skewedness or kurtosis was
found.
Hypothesis 1
The first hypothesis tested predicts that general English
vocabulary skill should significantly influence medical
Spanish acquisition. To test this hypothesis, we used a hier-
archical regression analysis in which the Spanish pretest was
entered in the first step to control for a priori Spanish
6 SAGE Open
knowledge and regressed on Spanish posttest scores. Then,
we entered English vocabulary scores on the Nelson­Denny
Vocabulary Test in a second step in this analysis.
Table 3 presents unstandardized coefficients, standard
errors of the coefficient, and R, R2, and F statistics for this
model. As can be seen, English vocabulary skill accounted
for substantial variance in medical Spanish acquisition
beyond that accounted for by the pretest, as predicted by this
model, t = 2.613, p = .013. The R2 change upon the addition
of the English Vocabulary variable was significant before the
addition of the variable representing English medical knowl-
edge. However, when English medical knowledge was added
to the model, it was a significant additional predictor to the
model, t = 2.79, p = .008, and English vocabulary skill was
no longer significant, t = 1.395, p = .171. The R2 change
affected between addition of English vocabulary and medi-
cal English was significant. Thus, this analysis provides sup-
port for the view that native language vocabulary skill does
influence the acquisition of a foreign language vocabulary,
but not when other factors are considered.
Hypothesis 2
The effect of medical background knowledge on medical
Spanish vocabulary acquisition was also investigated. That
is, this hypothesis predicts background content knowledge
should facilitate the learning of content vocabulary in a sec-
ond language. It was predicted that English Medical knowl-
edge would significantly predict Medical Spanish vocabulary
acquisition. Those learners employed in a health care facility
without an extensive background in the allied health disci-
plines were predicted to score significantly worse on the
posttest for Spanish than those who had extensive medical
training. The scores on the medical English terminology
exam were used to serve as an indication of the medical
background of the employees.
Table 4 presents unstandardized coefficients, standard
errors of the coefficient, and R, R2, and F statistics for this
model.As can be seen, English medical knowledge accounted
for substantial variance in medical Spanish acquisition,
beyond that accounted for by the pretest as predicted by this
model, t = 3.679, p = .001. While the addition of medical
English to the model produced a highly significant change in
R2, the change affected in R2 was not significant with the
subsequent addition of the English vocabulary variable.
Thus, there is substantial support for the view that content
knowledge influences the acquisition of a foreign language
vocabulary, even when other factors such as native language
vocabulary skills are considered.
Hypothesis 3
The third hypothesis investigates the nature of the relation-
ship between medical terminology knowledge and English
vocabulary size on two predictor variables on the acquisition
of medical Spanish vocabulary. It was predicted that both
English vocabulary and medical terminology would be sig-
nificant predictors of medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition

when entered into a combined model. Determination of how
the two predictor variables influence medical Spanish acqui-
sition, and how they would interact, if at all, was first investi-
gated through multiple regression procedures. Interaction
between the two major predictor variables of Spanish acquisi-
tion was investigated by introducing interaction as a predictor
beyond the main effects of the variables entered individually.
Table 5 presents unstandardized coefficients, standard errors
of the coefficient, and R, R2, and F statistics for this model.
When medical terminology knowledge was entered after the
Spanish pretest variable into the model, the R2 change was
highly significant. The addition of the English vocabulary
variable to the model did not produce a significant change in
R2, nor did the subsequent addition of the interaction variable
to the model. As can be seen, when this interaction term is
added, it does not account for additional variance beyond that
accounted for by the other variables. Thus, we have little evi-
dence that the interaction between the two variables account
for the learning of medical Spanish beyond that accounted for
by the contribution of the variables by themselves. In sum,
from the analyses above, it seems that there is best support for
Hypothesis 2, the view that medical background knowledge
is the best predictor of vocabulary learning in the acquisition
of medical Spanish.
Discussion
The purpose of the present study was to examine the influ-
ence of two factors believed to influence foreign language
acquisition--native language vocabulary base and subject
background knowledge. Specifically, we were interested in
the influence of native English vocabulary size (as measured
by a standardized test of vocabulary skill) and medical back-
ground knowledge (measured as knowledge of medical ter-
minology) on medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition.
Both measures, medical knowledge and English vocab-
ulary size, were significant predictors of medical Spanish
vocabulary acquisition, by themselves. Although both

native English vocabulary and medical English vocabulary
size predicted medical Spanish vocabulary acquisition
when entered alone, most of the variance in medical
Spanish vocabulary acquisition was accounted for by the
learner's medical terminology knowledge. No patterns
were found to suggest that a higher level of education
alone was a predictor of medical Spanish vocabulary
acquisition. Of course, English vocabulary size could be
related to higher educational levels in some populations,
but the majority of the learners in this study had postsec-
ondary education. The finding that medical vocabulary
knowledge is the primary predictor of medical Spanish
vocabulary acquisition expands our knowledge of factors
to be considered regarding individual differences in the
acquisition of a second language.
An explanation of why general vocabulary size and to a
greater degree topic knowledge influence second language
vocabulary learning may lie in their processing for storage in
memory. Levelt's (1989) speech processing model postulates
that lexical representations in short-term memory are stored as
units of meaning and phonological units. Furthermore,
Coltheart, Curtis, Atkins, and Haller (1993) posited that pho-
nological lexical representations in short-term memory are
converted to semantic representations in long-term memory.
This conceptualization is reflected in recent native language
acquisition models that suggest that phonology ceases to
become the major avenue for vocabulary acquisition after the
establishment of a vocabulary base in long-term memory. Our
study supports the view that medical professionals may utilize
an elaborated semantic representational base in their native
language (in terms of vocabulary size and medical knowledge)
to accelerate second language vocabulary learning.
Another possible contributor to the demonstration that
medical professionals rely on prior vocabulary and medical
knowledge is the method we used to evaluate second lan-
guage vocabulary growth in this study. Many studies evalu-
ating the growth of vocabulary knowledge have used
evaluations of receptive, rather than productive, vocabulary
knowledge (Meara, 2005, Schmitt & McCarthy, 2005).
Receptive vocabulary has been characterized by its feed for-
ward relationship with phonology in short-term memory
whereas productive vocabulary has been associated with
prior lexical experience or long-term semantic stores
(Coltheart et al., 1993). We measured Spanish acquisition
through productive vocabulary which may have called on
our learner's deep, elaborated conceptual organization and
established vocabulary base.
This reliance by our participants on previously learned
vocabulary and medical knowledge supports the view (De
Bot, 1992) that bilingual conceptual memory is generally
shared by the bilingual's two languages. The model predicts
that second language vocabulary acquisition proceeds more
efficiently for concepts already created in the native language
because conceptual knowledge is not stored separately in the
two languages. It is posited that because conceptual knowl-
edge is easily retrievable in either language, the reduced load
on working memory results in automaticity (fluency). Our
results mirrored this model, finding that those learners with
greater background knowledge in medical terminology relied
on it more than on general vocabulary skills to learn Spanish.

Until recently, native language's phonological influence
has been called upon to explain various aspects of foreign
language acquisition. Sparks et al. (1997), for example,
found that native language vocabulary was a significant pre-
dictor of overall foreign language proficiency (Spanish,
French, and German) in high school students after 2 years of
study, although after 1 year of study, decoding ability (a mea-
sure of phonological and orthographic knowledge) was a bet-
ter predictor. Similarly, Masoura and Gathercole (1999)
found that phonological memory skills in Greek children
learning English were highly correlated to vocabulary
knowledge in both languages, but that English vocabulary
learning was related to Greek vocabulary in ways not
accounted for by phonological memory alone. The present
study, while agreeing with the importance of native language
vocabulary on the acquisition of a second language, suggests
that in some beginners, other factors such as topic knowl-
edge might come into play and might be utilized in some
instructional settings.
The influence of topic knowledge on foreign language
vocabulary acquisition has been studied in multiple con-
texts. As early as 1937, Chapman and Gilbert noted that
English speakers could more easily learn Hindustani nouns
if they could define them in English. Similar results were
found by Paribakht (2005) in Farsi-speaking college stu-
dents when students were exposed in text to English equiva-
lents of words known to them in their native language. The
present study measured topic knowledge through medical
terminology knowledge and did find a highly significant
relationship between medical terminology knowledge and
medically related foreign language (Spanish) vocabulary
acquisition. All of these studies add credence to the model
proposed by Kroll and de Groot (1997) that conceptually
similar words sharing the same conceptual store are more
easily acquired.
Depth of topic knowledge and its relationship to vocabu-
lary acquisition has been investigated in the native language
and in general foreign language learning. De Marie et al.
(2004) found that native language vocabulary (English)
learning could be predicted in university undergraduates by
importance of vocabulary to their major area of study. De
Marie et al. noted that there was a threshold for predicting
vocabulary acquisition and that a sufficient amount of
coursework needed to be completed to have an effect.
Clapham (1996) found that specific topic vocabulary knowl-
edge affected the second language text comprehension
scores. Results of the present study agree with these studies
in that specific topic knowledge is a highly significant pre-
dictor of Spanish acquisition.
This study indicates that language learners rely upon
their background knowledge when they have expertise. Our
findings suggest that current models of bilingual memory
model must include information regarding the organization
of native language concepts in long-term memory.Although
most of the health care employees were not advanced
foreign language learners, many of them were, on the
whole, already acquainted with the concepts that the words
represented. To date, most foreign language acquisition
research has been devoted to the study of adolescents or
college students, novices with little expertise in any area.
While the students may have substantial experience with
foreign language learning at the adolescent level, they are
not experts in content knowledge. The present study indi-
cates that increased foreign language vocabulary retrieval
is in part dependent on the strength of conceptual structures
in adults. Thus, prior research, by focusing on language
learning in adolescents and young adults generally without
extensive levels of expertise in subject matter area, has
largely missed the key importance of content knowledge in
the acquisition of LSP.
In sum, this study suggests that certain learner popula-
tions may profit from topic knowledge in learning foreign
language vocabulary related to their areas of expertise.
Extent of background knowledge in certain areas of exper-
tise may predispose individuals to rely more on conceptual
knowledge than, say, symbol/sound representations
emphasizing phonology. Medical vocabulary requirements
are likely greater than those of nontechnical disciplines.
For example, Ulijn and Strother (1995) observed that con-
tent words were more important to the comprehension of
scientific texts than that of general academic texts. Thus,
learners with greater facility in medical terminology than
the adult population in general, such as those in the present
study, may profit more from their understanding of medi-
cal concepts over other factors such as native language
vocabulary and phonology in acquiring Medical Spanish
vocabulary.
The role of topic knowledge in the acquisition of medical
Spanish vocabulary is supported by findings from studies of
expert knowledge. Experts have been shown to have highly
organized concepts in long-term memory. These highly orga-
nized conceptual structures may serve to free learners'work-
ing memory so that they can attend to and learn new labels in
another language. Researchers have posited that expert con-
tent knowledge is characterized by an organization that pro-
motes deep understanding and is thus more easily retrievable
(Bransford, Brown, & Cocking, 2003). As Schneider and
Shiffrin (1985) observed, novices must expend greater atten-
tional effort and are substantially handicapped in learning
new terms, and so may show a disadvantage here when both
concept and foreign language label must be learned simulta-
neously. Therefore, the savings in attentional effort when the
concept is well understood may be conserved for enhanced
foreign language learning.
Implications for Pedagogy
Our findings have implications for foreign language educa-
tors and to training professionals. Our findings suggest that a
curricular shift toward content-centered vocabulary may be
10 SAGE Open
warranted for adult early foreign language classes. Instructors
of LSP courses and ESL (English as a Second Language)
programs may find that less emphasis on general vocabulary
and more on the topic vocabulary needed in key communica-
tion scenarios encountered by professionals can secure more
rapid acquisition of core vocabulary and, hopefully, subse-
quent fluency. Businesses contemplating training employees
who will communicate with foreign language speakers may
wish to include professional terminology knowledge as a key
criterion for selection of LSP training personnel and identify
with some clarity the vocabulary to be taught in the training
programs.
Limitations and Generalizability of Findings
The present study evaluated a population of foreign language
learners that has not yet been well studied. Unfortunately,
our sample size, although acceptable, was not as large as we
would have ideally liked. Increased sample size might have
increased our ability to detect an independent effect of native
language vocabulary, above and beyond the overwhelming
influence of topic knowledge on medical Spanish vocabulary
acquisition. The fact that the majority of learners were female
may limit the transferability of the findings in male health
care providers. On the positive side, though, our sample con-
tained three separate groups of health care employees. Two
public health departments and employees of a large private
university hospital were represented. The learners' occupa-
tions ranged from clerks to technicians, nutritionists, epide-
miologists, and nurse practitioners with varying levels of
medical background and patient contact. The fact that the
study included both hospital employees and public health
employees allows us to generalize the study's findings to
health care employees in general.
A second possible limitation is that we used an
experimenter-created medical terminology test as an indi-
cator of prior knowledge. However, terminology knowl-
edge is only one aspect of expertise. Unfortunately, full
assessment of our participants' expertise was not practical.
Furthermore, the psychometric properties of this test were
not as well established as in the Nelson­Denny Vocabulary
assessment. On the positive side, there was a strong cor-
relation between the Medical Spanish posttest scores and
the medical terminology test. This would indicate that, to a
great extent, the medical terminology test was a valid indi-
cator of medical vocabulary knowledge. Furthermore, the
reliability of the English Medical Terminology Test was
excellent.
Differences in the format of the three tests may have
impacted the study results. While the Spanish and Medical
tests were both of short-answer format, the English vocab-
ulary test was multiple choice. The form of the response, to
a certain extent, determines the nature of the knowledge
being assessed. The Spanish and medical tests measured
productive knowledge. The Nelson­Denny Vocabulary test
could be considered less a measure of receptive knowl-
edge. It may be that productive vocabulary bears a greater
relationship in learning vocabulary in a second language
than receptive vocabulary does. Therefore, future research
should determine whether our finding that topic knowl-
edge is more important than native vocabulary size gener-
alizes to native language productive vocabulary size as
well.
The Spanish pre- and posttest results cannot be consid-
ered as indicators of Spanish vocabulary acquisition, but
only as vocabulary learning. The attention required of the
students to increase Spanish vocabulary scores was accom-
plished in a structured, rather than in an informal setting in
the present study. Thus, the increases may not adequately
reflect incidental vocabulary gains in a more authentic lan-
guage setting.
Finally, the pre- and posttest used was a paper­pencil test
and not the potentially more valid situation of using oral
vocabulary to communicate with others. For example, a test
evaluating the use of vocabulary in a medical setting would
likely be a more valid indicator of vocabulary learning than
the test used here. Therefore, the Spanish vocabulary test
should be considered as exploratory. The intricacies of for-
mal and informal oral interactions in health care settings
have not been addressed in this study. The reliability and
validity of the test in those settings cannot be claimed. It is
possible that vocabulary deployed in a more realistic medical
setting situation might be shown to be more differentially
affected by general vocabulary skill than that was displayed
in this study.
Directions for Future Research
The finding of the role of topic knowledge on the acquisi-
tion of foreign language vocabulary acquisition suggests
that future research should be directed toward other expert
populations outside of the university community to more
closely ascertain how various types of expertise are
exploited to facilitate the acquisition of new second lan-
guage vocabulary during the working years. Second, this
study had a relatively short duration between the acquisi-
tion of the vocabulary through coursework and testing.
Future studies could examine the influence of topic knowl-
edge versus general first language vocabulary skill acquired
over a longer period of time. It may be that, at longer peri-
ods of time, general vocabulary skills come into play. Last,
as long-term retention of a foreign language is important,
future studies should include a long-term Spanish posttest
to measure the amount and nature of the vocabulary
retained.
In sum, we find that foreign language vocabulary acqui-
sition is driven by the information that precedes it.
Accordingly, all language learners are not alike; they chose
Drumhiller and Schwanenflugel 11
the path that is to their best advantage. Foreign language
learning is the product of memory systems that preferen-
tially select new information most compatible with that
already stored.
