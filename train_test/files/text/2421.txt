Abstract
Socioeconomic status is associated with health disparities, but underlying psychosocial
mechanisms have not been fully identified. Dispositional optimism may be a psychosocial
process linking socioeconomic status with health. We hypothesized that lower optimism
would be associated with greater social disadvantage and poorer social mobility. We also
investigated whether life satisfaction and positive affect showed similar patterns. Partici-
pants from the Midlife in the United States study self-reported their optimism, satisfaction,
positive affect, and socioeconomic status (gender, race/ethnicity, education, occupational
class and prestige, income). Social disparities in optimism were evident. Optimistic individu-
als tended to be white and highly educated, had an educated parent, belonged to higher oc-
cupational classes with more prestige, and had higher incomes. Findings were generally
similar for satisfaction, but not positive affect. Greater optimism and satisfaction were also
associated with educational achievement across generations. Optimism and life satisfac-
tion are consistently linked with socioeconomic advantage and may be one conduit by
which social disparities influence health.
Introduction
Disparities in health and longevity based on socioeconomic status (SES) are well established
[1]. Individuals with lower social status have greater risk of disease and mortality relative to in-
dividuals with higher social status. However, less well understood are the pathways underlying
this association. Access to health care, engaging in preventative health behaviors like exercising,
and exposure to environmental hazards have been suggested as pathways by which SES and
health are connected. Psychosocial processes have also been theorized as a possible pathway by
which SES and health are linked. For example, the reserve capacity framework posits that indi-
viduals in low socioeconomic contexts are exposed to more stressful situations, which may

strain the psychosocial resources (e.g., social support, feelings of control, optimism) that can be
used for managing challenges [2]. Moreover, repeated encounters with stress may reduce the
number of opportunities that individuals with low SES have to either develop or replenish their
psychosocial resources [3]. With both more stressful experiences and fewer psychosocial re-
sources with which to cope, worse health outcomes may ensue [4].
Dispositional optimism--or the generalized expectation that good rather than bad events
will occur [5]--has been characterized as a health asset. In other words, optimism can be con-
sidered a psychosocial resource that may protect health over the life course [6,7]. This is based
in part on a growing body of research indicating that optimistic individuals have reduced risk
of heart disease and all-cause mortality compared with less optimistic individuals [8­10]. Sev-
eral investigators have also reported that optimism appears to be associated with social status,
with findings in non-U.S. cohorts suggesting higher optimism is associated with higher SES
[11,12]. As a result, optimism has been put forward as a potential psychosocial resource that
may explain in part why higher social status is associated with better health [4,13­15].
Optimism can serve as a mechanism by which social advantage leads to better health only if
it is itself systematically patterned and produced by income, education, and race/ethnicity such
that those with greater social advantage have higher levels of optimism. However, although op-
timism is only partly heritable [16], relatively little is known about its distribution across the
social structural factors that are so strongly linked to health disparities--hereafter called struc-
tural factors [5]. This is partly because epidemiological cohorts do not typically assess disposi-
tional optimism; they more often assess other psychological assets (i.e., indicators of positive
psychological functioning) such as life satisfaction and positive affect. Limited research indi-
cates greater optimism is associated with higher SES (most often indicated by education)
among older community members [12] and adolescents or young adults [13,17,18]. But no re-
search has systematically examined optimism's association with key structural factors contrib-
uting to social disparities in health among U.S. adults including race/ethnicity, education,
occupational class and prestige, and income.
In addition to prior work in British and Finnish cohorts suggesting that low SES is associat-
ed with viewing the future less optimistically [11,12], research with other indicators of psycho-
logical health suggests that while they may seem intensely personal, they are in fact patterned
by structural factors. For example, low SES individuals are more likely to experience higher lev-
els of depression and anxiety with greater frequency [19­21]. Moreover, life satisfaction is asso-
ciated with social advantage [22,23] such that greater satisfaction is linked with more
education and higher income [24­27]. Whites also tend to report being more satisfied than
Blacks and Hispanics in the U.S. [26]. In sum, prior work indicates substantial social disparities
in some of the most commonly assessed indicators of psychological health.
Thus, there is reason to suspect that dispositional optimism is similarly patterned by the
structural factors that influence access to resources and are linked with health disparities. We
posit that optimism may be associated with disparities-related factors because these factors
provide a context for either developing or restricting optimistic tendencies. For example, opti-
mistic people expect favorable outcomes, persist at goals, use effective coping strategies, and
engage with attainable goals or disengage from unattainable goals [28]. Higher levels of educa-
tion may foster such skills, as well as the opportunity for positive feedback loops to develop
about goal attainment that validate optimistic perspectives. By contrast, poverty and/or the ex-
perience of being a racial or ethnic minority may suppress optimistic tendencies because indi-
viduals encounter more demanding environments and have fewer resources to combat
challenges [20]. Because they are more frequently exposed to unpredictable and difficult situa-
tions, individuals of low SES are more likely to develop a schema that the world is threatening,
and therefore interpret ambiguous events with more negative and fewer positive attributions

[29]. Such experiences are unlikely to routinely foster upward spirals of optimism. Notably,
SES is frequently perpetuated across generations [30,31], and this may extend to the corre-
sponding cognitive and affective processes that are associated with lower social status [20].
Thus, in addition to understanding optimism's association with structural factors, it is also use-
ful to consider whether optimism is associated with the educational attainment of one's parents
or responsive to social mobility.
Taken together, our primary aim was to investigate dispositional optimism's association
with a set of social structural factors related to health disparities: gender, race/ethnicity, educa-
tion level (of the participant and his or her parents), occupational class, occupational prestige,
and income. Consistent with previous research, we expected that higher social position
(e.g., higher levels of education and income) would be associated with greater optimism. We
also considered age-related patterning as health-related social disparities widen with age [32].
For comparative purposes, and because satisfaction and positive affect are more often included
in large epidemiological cohorts, we also considered whether social patterning in optimism is
similar to patterning with these psychological assets. Although numerous studies have consid-
ered the distribution of life satisfaction or positive affect across social indicators, few have com-
pared these patterns with those for optimism. Given the moderate to high correlations between
these psychological assets [33], we expected them to be similarly distributed. However, evi-
dence that they are not similarly distributed might suggest that unique psychological assets are
not equally relevant for understanding how social disadvantage translates into
health outcomes.
A secondary aim was to use a life course perspective to investigate the association of each
psychological asset with intergenerational continuity and change in educational attainment.
Evidence from a Finnish cohort suggested that optimism was associated with intergenerational
trajectories of social mobility such that individuals with persistently high SES (present in child-
hood and adulthood) were more optimistic than individuals with persistently low SES or who
became upwardly or downwardly mobile [11]. We sought to replicate that finding with educa-
tional achievement in U.S. participants, and to examine whether satisfaction and positive affect
were similarly influenced by intergenerational trajectories. To our knowledge, limited research
has considered whether different psychological assets are influenced by social mobility.
Methods
Participants
Participants were men and women from the Midlife in the United States (MIDUS) study.
MIDUS was initially designed to investigate behavioral, psychological, and social factors
in aging individuals. The first phase (MIDUS I) began in 1995 and included a national ran-
dom-digit-dialing sample, oversamples from five metropolitan areas, siblings of the random-
digit-dialing sample, and a national random-digit-dialing sample of twin pairs (total N =
7,108). Individuals were eligible to participate if they were non-institutionalized, spoke English,
and were 25­74 years old. A longitudinal follow-up began an average of 9 years later in 2004
(MIDUS II); 4,963 of the original MIDUS I respondents participated in MIDUS II [34]. A new
sample of Blacks was also recruited from Milwaukee to participate in MIDUS II (N = 592). Our
analyses were based on MIDUS II data so Milwaukee participants could be included and be-
cause a well-validated measure of dispositional optimism was assessed then. Thus, the initial
sample of 5,555 included main MIDUS II and Milwaukee participants.
The analytic sample for the current analyses was further reduced by 1,140 participants miss-
ing data on optimism, life satisfaction, and positive affect. The three psychological assets were
assessed with self-administered questionnaires returned by mail, so fewer participants

completed them compared with the primary phone interview. However, among participants
who completed the measures of psychological assets, the vast majority completed all items and
over 98% completed at least two thirds of the relevant items in each measure (n = 4,415).
Among these participants, some were missing data on structural factors. Where possible, miss-
ing data on structural factors at MIDUS II was replaced with MIDUS I data. Thus, sample sizes
in the primary analyses were 3,844­4,415, with 1,837 members of a sibling or twin set in the an-
alytic sample. Included versus excluded participants tended to be women who were older,
white, educated, of a higher occupational class, and with higher household incomes. As a result,
estimates of social disparities in the psychological assets may be conservatively estimated in
this sample. All respondents provided written informed consent. Original data collection was
approved by institutional review boards at the University of Wisconsin Madison, University of
California Los Angeles, and Georgetown University. Secondary data analyses were approved
by the institutional review boards at Chapman University and Harvard School of Public
Health.
Measures
Social structural factors. Social structural factors were self-reported by participants at MIDUS
II except for parental education, which was self-reported at MIDUS I for non-Milwaukee par-
ticipants. If social structural information from MIDUS II was not available, information from
MIDUS I was used when possible. The social structural factors included gender (men, women),
race/ethnicity (white, black; other races were excluded), highest level of education attained by
either the participant's mother or father, and highest level of education attained by the partici-
pant (each coded as less than high school, high school diploma, some college, college degree or
more). In addition, we assessed occupational class (managerial/professional, technical/sales/
clerical/service, manual; homemakers and individuals not currently working were excluded if
their previous job was unknown) and Duncan's socioeconomic index (SEI) as an indicator
of the status of participants' current job or previous job if retired [35]. SEI was standardized
(M = 0, SD = 1). Standardized scores of +1 (e.g., public administrators with SEI = 54.35), 0
(e.g., postmaster with SEI = 39.84), and-1 (e.g., apparel salesperson with SEI = 25.37) approxi-
mated high, average, and low prestige occupations, respectively [36]. Finally, we assessed
household income in U.S. dollars, which was further categorized into quintiles ($0 to
<$21,000, $21,000 to <$40,250, $40,250 to <$63,750, $63,750 to <$102,750, $102,750 to
$300,000 or more). To maintain confidentiality, household incomes greater than $300,000
were converted to $300,000.
Following previous work [11,37], we created four trajectories of social mobility across gener-
ations for the 1,959 participants whose parents had either less than a high school diploma or a
college degree or more. We excluded participants whose parents were moderately educated to
focus on effects of either upward or downward social mobility, or stable SES from extreme so-
cial-class origins. Intergenerational trajectories of education were categorized as persistently
high (high parental education and participant education; n = 592, 30.22%), downwardly mobile
(high parental education and low participant education; n = 292, 14.91%), upwardly mobile
(low parental education and high participant education; n = 932, 47.58%), and persistently low
(low parental education and participant education; n = 143, 7.30%).
Psychological assets. Dispositional optimism was defined as generally having favorable ex-
pectations for the future. Although this is the most common way to define optimism, other def-
initions exist. These include, for example, explanatory style optimism and pessimism (i.e., the
pattern of attributions that individuals make about events in their lives) [38], unrealistic or
comparative optimism (i.e., an individual's belief that he or she is more likely to encounter

positive events and less likely to encounter negative events than others) [39], and situation-
specific optimism (i.e., having favorable expectations for a specific event) [40]. Despite using
the term "optimism", these three other definitions are weakly to moderately correlated with
dispositional optimism and are considered distinct constructs [5,39,40]. In this study, disposi-
tional optimism was assessed with the valid and reliable six-item Life Orientation Test-Revised
[41]. Example items are "I expect more good things to happen to me than bad" and "I hardly
ever expect things to go my way" (1 = agree a lot to 5 = disagree a lot). Although past work has
occasionally derived subscales from the three positively-worded ( = .68) and the three nega-
tively-worded items ( = .80; in the present study, the subscales were correlated r = -.44), we
followed recommendations to use all six items to more fully characterize optimism [42,43] and
to achieve higher internal consistency. An optimism score was derived by reverse coding items
as necessary and then summing responses such that greater numbers reflected greater opti-
mism (possible scores ranged from 6­30). Following MIDUS data conventions, if at least three
items were completed, a missing value was imputed with the mean value of the other items. In-
ternal consistency reliability in the present sample was good ( = .79).
Life satisfaction, defined as judgments about life in general or specific life domains [44], was
assessed with six previously validated items [45,46] that asked participants to rate their satisfac-
tion with work, health, relationship with spouse/partner, relationship with children, financial
situation, and life overall (0 = the worst possible to 10 = the best possible). The two items regard-
ing relationship satisfaction were first averaged together and subsequently averaged with the
remaining items for an overall life satisfaction mean [46]. Following MIDUS data conventions,
if at least one item was completed, a mean score was computed with greater numbers reflecting
greater satisfaction (possible scores ranged from 1­10). Internal consistency reliability in the
present sample was acceptable ( = .72).
Positive affect (colloquially known as happiness) was assessed in response to six items refer-
ring to the question: "During the past 30 days, how much of the time did you feel. . ." Items
included "cheerful", "in good spirits", "extremely happy", "calm and peaceful", "satisfied",
and "full of life" (1 = all of the time to 5 = none of the time) [47]. Following MIDUS data con-
ventions, a mean positive affect score was computed if at least one of the six items was complet-
ed. Greater scores reflected more positive affect (possible scores ranged from 1­5). Internal
consistency reliability in the present sample was excellent ( = .91). We also examined
positive affect assessed with the Positive Affect and Negative Affect Schedule [48] and the Mul-
tidimensional Personality Questionnaire [49,50], but patterns were similar so results are
not discussed.
Statistical Analyses
Descriptive analyses were first conducted. Differences in mean psychological assets according
to each individual structural factor were then examined with analyses of variance (ANOVAs),
which indicate whether at least one level of social strata differs from the others. We also con-
ducted focused contrast analyses that tested a linear trend to reflect the expected social gradient
[51]. These contrast analyses yielded Fcontrast
(which provides the significance level for the line-
ar trend) and rcontrast
(which provides the magnitude of effect for the linear trend). Multivariate
models with all structural factors simultaneously predicting the individual psychological assets
were also conducted. The psychological assets were also examined in relation to social mobility
trajectories using ANOVAs. Because of sibling and twin pairs in the data, we conducted gener-
alized estimating equations for primary analyses. Findings were nearly identical (data not
shown), suggesting that clustering in the data did not bias parameter estimates. We present the
unadjusted findings for easier interpretation.

satisfaction, and positive affect relative to older individuals (Table 2). However, in general, par-
ticipants tended to report levels of psychological assets above the midpoint on each rating scale
(optimism M = 23.03, SD = 4.75; satisfaction M = 7.44, SD = 1.32; positive affect M = 3.44, SD
= 0.72). For example, the average participant experienced positive affect some or most of the
time. The three psychological assets were correlated (optimism and satisfaction r = .44; opti-
mism and positive affect r = .44; satisfaction and positive affect r = .52).
Social disparities in psychological assets
The social structural patterning of the three psychological assets is shown in Table 2. Men and
women did not differ in reported levels of optimism, satisfaction, or positive affect. The psy-
chological assets were associated with race/ethnicity. Optimism and life satisfaction were sig-
nificantly higher among Whites relative to Blacks. In contrast, Blacks reported higher positive
affect relative to Whites. Optimism also seemed to be strongly patterned by other SES indica-
tors. For example, optimism's association with education in one's family of origin was robustly
graded such that participants who had a parent with a college degree or more were the most
optimistic compared to those who had a parent with a high school diploma or less. However,
satisfaction did not vary based on parental education. Moreover, a social gradient was not evi-
dent for positive affect in the context of parental education. Counter to expectation, partici-
pants whose most highly educated parent did not complete high school reported the highest
levels of positive affect. Participants' own education level was significantly and positively asso-
ciated with optimism and satisfaction. Individuals with a college degree or higher reported
being the most optimistic and satisfied compared with less educated individuals. For optimism
in particular, the association was strikingly linear such that with each increase in education
level, there was an associated increase in optimism. By contrast, positive affect was not signifi-
cantly associated with participants' level of education.
The highest levels of optimism and satisfaction were evident among individuals with mana-
gerial or professional occupations (i.e., the highest occupational class). Furthermore, both opti-
mism and satisfaction had a linear relationship with occupational class such that manual
occupations (i.e., the lowest occupational class) had the lowest levels and managerial occupa-
tions (i.e., the highest occupational class) had the highest levels. By contrast, positive affect did
not differ by occupational class and a linear trend was not evident. Greater occupational pres-
tige was also linearly associated with higher levels of optimism and satisfaction, but positive af-
fect did not differ by occupational prestige. A similar pattern was evident for income.
Optimism and satisfaction had a linear association with income such that individuals with the
highest income reported the greatest optimism relative to their less wealthy counterparts. Posi-
tive affect was not significantly associated with income.
Multivariate models that included all of the structural factors simultaneously showed nearly
identical patterns as the univariate models presented in Table 2 (data not shown). The percent
of variance explained by all structural factors was 9% for optimism, 12% for satisfaction, and
4% for positive affect.
Trajectories of social mobility across generations
Different patterns of optimism, life satisfaction, and positive affect emerged for trajectories of
social mobility across generations (Fig. 1). Individuals with persistently higher education across
generations had significantly greater optimism than the upwardly mobile, downwardly mobile,
and persistently lower educated (post-hoc comparisons p < 0.05). Individuals with persistently
lower education were the least optimistic relative to the other groups (post-hoc comparisons
p < 0.05). Satisfaction demonstrated a similar pattern with the persistently higher educated

Discussion
Although optimism is relevant for health outcomes [6,7,9,10] and is an important psychosocial
asset in its own right [5], little is known about its social distribution, particularly among U.S.
adults. We examined dispositional optimism's social structural patterning in the context of a
social disparities framework and compared findings on optimism with two more commonly
assessed measures of psychological assets in epidemiological cohorts: life satisfaction and posi-
tive affect. Our hypothesis that social disparities in optimism would be evident was largely sup-
ported (although associations were modest), which is consistent with the reserve capacity
framework [4]. Greater levels of optimism were evident among more socially advantaged indi-
viduals--that is, those without minority status who had more education, higher occupational
classes and prestige, and larger incomes.
Consistent with previous findings [25], optimism, satisfaction, and positive affect did not
differ between men and women. However, the patterning across other social structural factors
tended to vary, with optimism and life satisfaction generally similar (except in relation to pa-
rental education). Whites reported the greatest optimism and satisfaction, whereas Blacks re-
ported the greatest positive affect. The highest optimism and satisfaction levels were evident
among college-educated participants, but positive affect was not associated with educational at-
tainment. Consistent with other studies, optimism was also greatest among participants with at
least one college-educated parent [52,53], although this association was of a smaller magnitude
than the other statistically significant findings. In contrast, life satisfaction and positive affect
were not linearly associated with parental education.
We also found that optimism and life satisfaction were patterned by occupational class such
that individuals with professional or managerial jobs were the most optimistic and satisfied.
Occupational prestige also had a clear gradient with optimism and satisfaction whereby more
prestige correlated with more optimism and satisfaction. This was not the case with positive af-
fect, which conflicts with previous findings (but this could be due to differences in methodolo-
gy including single sex samples and ecologic momentary assessment methods) [3]. Finally,
consistent with past work [54,55], optimism and satisfaction each demonstrated a positive, lin-
ear association with income. Although we did not find a statistically significant association be-
tween positive affect and income, previous studies report small associations and suggest
income's relation with affect is smaller and more unstable than with satisfaction [56].
When examining intergenerational social mobility, the most optimistic and satisfied indi-
viduals were those with high levels of education across generations (i.e., parent and participant
were both college-educated). These findings are consistent with those from Heinonen and col-
leagues [11] who studied Finnish youth into adulthood, although they also found that the
downwardly mobile were more optimistic than the upwardly mobile and the persistently low.
In our sample of mostly middle-aged U.S. adults, those who were upwardly mobile were more
optimistic and satisfied than the downwardly mobile. We also found that individuals with per-
sistently high levels of education across generations did not differ in positive affect from those
with persistently low levels of education, the upwardly mobile, or the downwardly mobile. To
our knowledge, only one other study has examined links between satisfaction and social mobil-
ity [57], and no studies have examined positive affect.
and upwardly mobile, as well as the persistently low and the downwardly mobile. For positive affect, only the
comparison between the upwardly mobile and the downwardly mobile was significantly different.
Note. Only participants with low or high parental education were included in these analyses (i.e., participants
whose parents were moderately educated were excluded).

Social Disparities in Optimism, Life Satisfaction, and Positive Affect
PLOS ONE | DOI:10.1371/journal.pone.0118066 February 11, 2015 11 / 16
Dispositional optimism, life satisfaction, and positive affect are sometimes used as inter-
changeable markers in studies examining psychological factors in relation to physical health.
Our findings suggest that such practices should be avoided, particularly if studies are investi-
gating a possible role for psychological assets in explaining social disparities in physical health.
These measures are not proxies for one another as they have different associations with SES.
Optimism was consistently related with structural factors, which is in line with the reserve ca-
pacity framework. Namely, higher levels of dispositional optimism were evident among more
advantaged members of society: white, college-educated individuals with higher occupational
positions, prestige, and income. Satisfaction had a similar pattern, with the exception of paren-
tal education. Compared with optimism and satisfaction, positive affect seemed to have unique
associations with status [56]. This could be because positive affect taps the emotional aspect of
well-being whereas optimism and satisfaction are cognitively-oriented. Alternatively, perhaps
because affect has evolved to signal whether a particular stimulus may be beneficial or harmful,
the utility of positive affect may cut across different levels of SES. Moreover, optimism and sat-
isfaction may be patterned similarly because they reflect more enduring characteristics com-
pared with positive affect, which may be subject to transient influences. Or, optimism's (and to
a lesser extent satisfaction's) emphasis on fulfilling meaningful goals versus positive affect's em-
phasis on enjoying pleasure may be more strongly tied to social structural status and capacity
to attain goals. Having the educational, financial, and other resources associated with higher
status may further enable greater striving and more hopefulness about the future. Although
these speculations extrapolate beyond the current data, they could be investigated in future re-
search designed to examine the association between psychological assets and structural factors
implicated in opportunities (or the lack thereof) across the life course.
The correlational design of the current study prohibits causal conclusions and the size of the
reported associations could be considered small according to conventional guidelines. Howev-
er, reported associations are comparable to other findings [58] and even very small effects can
have a large impact at the population level [59], especially if effects stemming from SES and
psychological assets accumulate across the life course [60]. This study captures structural fac-
tors at only a single point in time, so it is unclear whether a recent change in status (e.g., chang-
ing from employed to unemployed) is associated with changes in psychological assets. In
addition, educated individuals were more likely to participate in MIDUS II [34], so reported as-
sociations may be conservative due to selective attrition. Although study participants ranged in
age from 30­85 years, most were middle aged. And, despite supplementing the sample with
Blacks, the current sample was primarily White and numbers were not large enough to investi-
gate other racial or ethnic groups separately. Generalization to more diverse samples may not
be warranted, although evidence suggests that optimism and other psychological assets are uni-
versal phenomena [61,62]. In addition, findings related to intergenerational social mobility
were based only on education, not other status indicators such as employment status, occupa-
tional class, or income [63,64]. Moreover, educational attainment in earlier generations may
not correspond exactly to education attainment in subsequent generations (e.g., a high school
diploma for somebody in the early 20th century may be equivalent to a college degree for some-
body in the mid to late 20th century).
Despite these limitations, this is one of the first studies to broadly examine dispositional op-
timism in relation to one's socioeconomic position among mostly middle-aged U.S. men and
women. Findings indicate that optimism is contoured by social structural factors related to op-
portunity (i.e., race/ethnicity, education, occupational class and prestige, income, and social
mobility), perhaps because such factors provide the context in which optimistic tendencies are
shaped, developed, or used. Although associations between structural factors and optimism at
first appear modest, they may have meaningful implications at the population level or as effects

accumulate across the lifespan. Indeed, the 4-point spread in optimism scores evident for the
highest versus lowest levels of participant education has been shown to translate into a 16% re-
duced risk of myocardial infarction and a 30% reduced risk of heart disease-related mortality
[9]. Thus, even apparently small differences in optimism can have critical health implications.
We also compared the patterning of optimism with two other widely assessed psychological
assets, which has not been done previously. Although dispositional optimism is not routinely
assessed in surveillance studies, findings reported here suggest that it may reveal unique in-
sights about effects of social structure on health (among other pathways), and should be con-
sidered for inclusion in future assessments. Moreover, given links between optimism and
improved mental and physical health [6,65], assessment of optimism may provide additional
insight into social disparities in health or other factors that shape capacity for positive adapta-
tion in the context of adversity [66]. Because optimism and satisfaction appear to be related to
social structural influences and health, they may be useful targets for both policy-oriented as
well as individual-level intervention strategies for improving population health. Furthermore,
increasing educational opportunities and otherwise reducing social disparities may not only
improve physical health, but may also foster greater psychological assets.
