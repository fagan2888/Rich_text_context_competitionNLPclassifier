Abstract: Throughout the animal kingdom, larger males are more likely to attain social
dominance. Several lines of evidence suggest that this relationship extends to humans, as
height is positively related to dominance, status and authority. We hypothesized that height
is also a determinant of authority in professional refereeing. According to the International
Football Association Board, FIFA, football ("soccer") referees have full authority to
enforce the laws of the game and should use their body language to show authority and to
help control the match. We show that height is indeed positively related to authority status:
referees were taller than their assistants (who merely have an advisory role) in both a
national (French League) and an international (World Cup 2010) tournament. Furthermore,
using data from the German League, we found that height was positively associated with
authoritative behavior. Taller referees were better able to maintain control of the game by
giving fewer fouls, thereby increasing the "flow of the game". Referee height was also
positively associated with perceived referee competence, as taller referees were assigned to
matches in which the visiting team had a higher ranking. Thus, height appears to be
positively related to authority in professional refereeing.

Introduction
Throughout the animal kingdom, larger males are more likely to attain social
dominance (Andersson, 1994; Archer, 1988; Ellis, 1994; Isaac, 2005), which is the ability
Height increases authority in professional refereeing
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -589-
to acquire resources in the presence of others through either agonistic or affiliative
strategies (Pellegrini and Bartini, 2001). Several lines of evidence suggest that this positive
relationship between body size and social dominance extends to humans. First of all, taller
men are more likely to win physical fights as they are physically stronger (Sell et al., 2009),
have an enhanced capacity to deliver potentially damaging strikes (Carrier, 2011), and react
more aggressively in sports (Webster and Xu, 2011). Additionally, taller men are less
sensitive to cues of dominance in other men (Watkins et al., 2010) and respond with less
jealousy towards socially and physically dominant rivals than do shorter men (Buunk, Park,
Zurriage, Klavina and Massar, 2008). These findings suggest that it is more important for
shorter men, as compared to taller men, to accurately gauge a rival's dominance given the
higher costs associated with engaging in a fight if a competitor is miscategorized.
Similarly, taller men could be (or perceive themselves to be) better able to deter dominant
rivals, which would reduce the need for jealousy.
Perceptions of height and dominance are also closely related. Taller men are
perceived as more dominant than shorter men (Montepare, 1995), and, vice versa, more
dominant men are estimated as taller than less dominant men (Dannenmaier and Thumin
1964; Marsh, Yu, Schechter and Blair, 2009). Similarly, the losing candidates in political
elections are judged as shorter, whereas the winning candidates are judged as taller than
they were perceived to be before the election (Higham and Carment, 1992). People also
judge politicians whom they support as taller than politicians whom they oppose
(Sorokowski, 2010). Perceptions of height also affect behavior. Huang and colleagues
(2002), for example, manipulated the camera angle in a negotiation task and found that men
who were perceived as taller were more influential in the task than men who were
perceived as shorter. The positive relationship between size and perceived dominance is
even apparent in very young children: Thomsen, Frankenhuis and Carey (2011) showed
that children as young as ten months old recognize that size plays a role in dominance
contests, and are "surprised" by (i.e., pay more attention to) a situation in which a smaller
individual dominates a larger individual.
Perhaps because of their increased physical (Sell et al., 2009), behavioral (Watkins
et al., 2010) and/or perceived dominance (Marsh et al., 2009), height is positively related to
access to actual resources in humans. This is supported by the findings that taller
individuals (particularly men) are more likely to have higher starting salaries (Loh, 1993),
higher overall income (Judge and Cable, 2004), and are more likely to be promoted
(Melamed and Bozionelos, 1992) than shorter men. Not surprisingly therefore, height is
positively related to authority status. For example, when one's dominance is exercised
legitimately, taller individuals are more likely than shorter individuals to occupy a
leadership or managerial position (Gawley, Perks and Curtis, 2009; Stogdill, 1948). These
findings extend to politics, because since 1896, U.S. citizens have always elected a
President whose height was considerably above average (Judge and Cable, 2004).
Moreover, Presidents whose presidency was considered "great" were taller than those
whose presidency was considered a "failure" (Sommers, 2002). Thus, taller men are more
likely to obtain a position of authority, and when they do, are considered more successful.
Giving the above findings, we hypothesized that male height may also be related to
authority in a different setting: professional football ("soccer") refereeing. According to the
Height increases authority in professional refereeing

International Football Association Board, FIFA, football referees have full authority to
enforce the laws of the game and can use their body language to show authority and help
control the match (Laws of the Game; FIFA, 2012). Similarly, the website of the British
Football Referees' Association (2010) states that a referee always has to "keep control [of
the game], by bending his authority to encourage the flow of the game". These
recommendations are not surprising, given the fact that referees have to deal with verbal
and physical aggression not only from players, but also from coaches, and spectators
(Folkesson, Nyberg, Archer and Norlande, 2002). With almost every blow of the whistle,
half of the players, coaches and crowd are likely to disagree with the referee's decision.
We examined whether height was related to authority and authoritative behavior in
professional refereeing. First, we examined whether or not referees were taller than their
assistants (who merely have an advisory role) in the French professional League (Study 1)
as well as during the 2010 World Cup that took place in South Africa (Study 2).
Furthermore, we investigated whether there was an association between referee height and
authoritative behavior on the football pitch. A recent study by Van Quaquebeke and
Giessner (2010) investigated the association between height and dominance in football
players. In this study, taller players were perceived as committing more fouls than shorter
players. We hypothesize that, apart from player height, referee height is also related to
authority and dominance on the pitch (Study 3). We predicted that relatively taller referees
would be better able to maintain control of the game (i.e. players would be more wary of
committing fouls or retaliating towards other players) and would increase the "flow of the
game" by having to give fewer fouls (Study 3). Furthermore, we predicted that the
allocation of referees to matches by the football league is contingent on referee height, with
taller referees being appointed to more important matches.
Study 1: Ligue 1 (French Professional league) referees
Material and Methods
The aim of our first study was to investigate the relationship between height and
status success in professional refereeing. We collected data on assistant referees (n = 64)
and referees (n = 38) from six seasons of Ligue 1 (2004/2005 to 2009/2010), the top French
football league from the website http://www.worldfootball.net/. One individual acted as
both referee and assistant referee during this period; he was classified as a referee in our
analyses. We chose the French league because all referee heights and the majority of
assistant referee heights were available (only five out of 69 heights of assistant referees
were missing; for consistency with Study 3, we preferred to have data on the German
league (Bundesliga). Unfortunately, for this league, more than one third of all assistant
referees' heights were missing). Independent sample t-tests were performed to test whether
head referees were significantly taller than their assistants.
Results
Referees were on average 4.09 cm taller than assistant referees (Figure 1a; t-test; M

= 179.71; SD = 5.49 cm versus M = 175.62; SD = 7.32 cm; t(100) = 2.98; p = .004; d =
0.62). No difference in age was found between referees (M = 41.00 years; SD = 5.39) and
assistant referees (M = 41.41 years, SD = 5.83; t-test; t(102) = 0.35; p = .724, d = 0.07).
The effect of height can thus not be attributed to the association between age and height.
Study 2: World Cup referees
Material and Methods
To replicate our finding for the French league we collected data from the FIFA-
website (www.fifa.com) on all referees and assistant referees who officiated in the 64
matches of the 2010 World Cup in South Africa. In total, 29 trios consisting of one referee
(n = 29) and two assistant referees (n = 58) were invited for the World Cup. Referees were
either assigned as an "active" referee or as "stand-in" referee (fourth official) during a
match. Similarly, assistant referees were either assigned as an "active" assistant referee or
as "stand-in" assistant referee (fifth official). The fourth official is the primary replacement
of the referee when he is unable to continue officiating, whereas the fifth official is the
primary replacement of the assistant referee.
Only four individuals were assigned exclusively as referee during the tournament.
Thirteen officials acted more often as referee than as fourth official, seven acted more often
as fourth official than referee, and five acted only as fourth official. With respect to the
assistant referees and fifth officials: twenty-two officials acted exclusively as assistant
referee, seventeen acted more as assistant referee than as fifth official, nine acted more
often as fifth official than assistant referee, and ten acted only as fifth officials. Referees or
fourth officials never officiated as an assistant referee or fifth official and no assistant
referee or fifth official ever officiated as referee or fourth official. We classified officials on
the basis of their most common overall assignment throughout the tournament (e.g., an
individual officiating as an assistant referee more often than as a fifth official was classified
as an assistant referee). This led to the following classification of officials: 17 referees, 12
fourth officials, 39 assistant referees, and 19 fifth officials.
We tested whether there was a difference in height between referees and assistant
referees and between "active" and "stand-in" (i.e. the 4th and 5th official) referees. Given
that height varies between countries, and that referees and assistant referees were invited in
trios, often with individuals from the same or neighboring countries, we included the trio as
a random effect. Inclusion of such a random effect rules out that the effect found for height
is an artifact of between-country variation in height.
Results
In 26 out of the 29 invited trios, the referee was taller than at least one assistant
referee, and in 17 trios the referee was taller than both assistants. The invited 29 referees
were on average 4.31 cm taller than the 58 invited assistant referees (t-test; t(85) = 2.94; p
= .004, d = 0.68). When taking into account the overall assignment of the officials, the
between-country variation in height and the age of the officials, referees were estimated
Height increases authority in professional refereeing

4.17 cm taller than assistant referees (Linear mixed model parameter estimate (±SE): -4.17
± 1.14; 2(1, N = 87) = 12.37; p = .0004; see Table 1 and Figure 1b).
There was no significant difference in height between the "active" official and their
potential "stand-in" (-0.38 ± 1.72; 2(1, N = 87) = 0.05; p = .82; Table 1). Age was not
significantly related to height (p = .14; Table 1). The height effect can thus not be attributed
to the association between age and height. Parameter estimates for the full model can be
found in Table 1.
We also investigated whether height was related to the years of international
experience a referee had. Taller referees had fewer years of international experience prior
to the World Cup (Pearson r(27)= -.39; p = .037). After controlling for the age of the
referee in a partial correlation, the relationship between height and experience became
marginally significant (r(26) = -.37; p = .051). For assistant referees, there was no
relationship between experience and height (r(56) = .15; p = .25).

Study 3: Bundesliga (German First Division) Referees
Material and Methods
The aim of our third study was to investigate whether authoritative behavior and
competence was related to height and experience of a referee. We used football data
purchased from Impire AG, a company that specializes in collecting professional sports
data (www.impire.de). Available data comprised 1,530 matches from five seasons
(2004/2005 to 2008/2009) of the Bundesliga, the highest professional German football
division. For each match the referee's identity (n = 28), his height and experience (number
of seasons refereeing in the Bundesliga) were available, as well as the average rank of the
home and visiting team in the seasons 2004/2005 through to 2008/2009 (1=highest,
18=lowest), the total number of fouls given by the referee, and the number of yellow and
red cards that were administered to players. In football, a red card is given for a severe foul,
and will result in direct expulsion of the player for the remainder of the match. Two yellow
cards, for less severe fouls, will also result in a red card, and hence expulsion. The foul data
only include illegal physical contacts towards other players (e.g. unfair tackles), and no
other illegal actions that are penalized by the referee (e.g. handball and offside). For all
analyses, we included referee, the home team and the visiting team as random factors and
height, Bundesliga experience and age of referee as covariates. As referee age was highly
correlated with referee experience (Pearson r(26) = .83; p < .0001), we did not include
referee age in the reported models. Including age in the models did not change any of our
results, as age never reached statistical significance (all p > .16). We tested whether referee
height was predictive of measures of authority and control during a game, such as the
number of fouls and the number of cards given.

Furthermore, we investigated whether referee height was predictive of the perceived
competence of the referee, by examining whether these factors influenced the likelihood of
being assigned to matches in which the home or visiting team was high ranking (controlling
for respectively the visiting and home team by adding them as a random factor). All
analyses were performed in R version 2.11.1 (R Development Core Team, 2008), using the
lmer package. In the following we defined "tall" or "experienced" as one standard
deviation above the respective mean, and "short" or "inexperienced" as one standard
deviation below the respective mean.
Results
Referees were on average 185.18 centimeters tall (SD = 5.79) and had on average
6.25 years of Bundesliga experience (SD = 5.08) at the start of the seasons 2004/2005 to
2008/2009 (see Table 2 for descriptive statistics).

Referee height was also associated with measures of authoritative behavior during a
match. Controlling for the ranks of the playing teams, both referee experience (-0.75 ±
0.11; 2(1, n = 1,530) = 27.45; p < .0001) and height (-0.33 ± 0.15; 2(1, n = 1,530) = 5.26;
p = .022; Figure 2a) were negatively associated with the number of fouls in a match (see
Table 3 for all parameter estimates), indicating that taller and more experienced referees
assigned less fouls and thus interrupted the game less. Experienced referees gave on
average 7.63 fewer fouls compared to inexperienced referees. Tall referees gave on average
3.79 fewer fouls than short referees. Experience and height were not significantly
associated with the number of cards given in a match (Table 3).

predicted the average rank of the visiting team, but not of the home team (see Table 4 for
all parameter estimates). Thus, more experienced and taller referees, as opposed to
respectively inexperienced and shorter referees, were assigned to matches where the
visiting team had a better performance over these five years (higher ranking means lower
average rank). More experienced compared to less experienced and taller compared to
shorter referees were assigned to matches in which the visiting team on average was ranked
1.83 and 0.96 higher, respectively (out of 18 teams).

Discussion
In this study, we have shown that referees, the leading officials in football, are taller
than their assistant referees in both a national (French professional football league) and an
international (World Cup 2010) setting. These novel findings are in line with predictions
based on previous studies reporting a positive association between height and authority
(Gawley et al., 2009; Judge and Cable, 2004).
In addition, we found evidence that the height of referees was associated with their
(perceived) competence. First of all, we found that taller referees had relatively less
international experience than shorter referees prior to their invitation to the World Cup.
Height increases authority in professional refereeing
Evolutionary Psychology ­ ISSN 1474-7049 ­ Volume 10(3). 2012. -597-
Thus, a tall referee required less experience to be promoted to referee at the highest level.
Second, we found that taller and more experienced referees were assigned to matches in
which the visiting team had a better performance over the study period in the German
League. Hence, as more competent referees are more likely to be assigned to matches with
higher ranking teams, both experience and height appear to be indicators of this (perceived)
competence. The reason why no effect of height and experience was found on the rank of
the home team can be explained by how referees in the Bundesliga are assigned. A referee
is registered to a particular region within Germany and is not allowed to officiate in any
matches in which teams from that particular region are playing (DFB, 2010). However, for
logistical reasons, referees are likely to be assigned to matches in regions neighboring their
own. Therefore, the region where the referee is registered constrains the set of home teams
that he can be assigned to, and hence the ranks of these home teams he can be assigned to.
We also found evidence that the height of referees was associated with their
effectiveness and authority in the field. An important aspect of refereeing, according to the
British Football Referees' Association (2010) is to "keep control [of the game], by bending
his authority to encourage the flow of the game". Taller compared to shorter referees gave
fewer fouls, and thus increased the "flow in the game". Apparently, taller referees are better
able to control the game by "bending their authority", resulting in players committing fewer
fouls (i.e. players would be more wary of committing fouls or less inclined to retaliate
towards other players), or they resolved them in another way (e.g. deciding to "play
advantage" instead of stopping the game for a foul, because the fouled team still has the
advantage in the situation, or by warning players in another way). Similarly, more
experienced referees also awarded fewer fouls than less experienced referees. It is worth
noting that in the Bundesliga, for both the number of given fouls and the rank of the
visiting team, the effect of two extra centimeters in height was comparable to
approximately one extra year of experience.
Instead of the increased "flow" or control of the game by taller referees, the
negative association between referee height and the number of fouls could also mean that
taller referees either notice fewer fouls, or that they are more lenient. Some evidence
suggests however, that these alternative explanations are unlikely. Noticing fewer fouls
would indicate poor refereeing, as the main job of the referee is to notice and penalize
fouls. As mentioned above, referee height was positively associated with measures of the
perceived competence of the referee (e.g., being assigned to matches with higher-ranked
teams), rendering it unlikely that taller referees are less likely to notice foul play.
Additionally, more experienced referees also awarded fewer fouls. As experience is a likely
determinant of competence (Dohmen, 2008; Nevill, Balmer and Williams, 2002), the fact
that more experienced and taller referees awarded fewer fouls suggests that, awarding
fewer fouls is likely to be a sign of competence rather than incompetence. It is also unlikely
that the positive relationship between height and number of fouls arises because taller
referees are more lenient as no differences were found in the number of cards given by
taller referees compared to shorter referees (if anything taller referees were less lenient as
they gave fewer fouls than shorter referees, yet handed out similar numbers of cards).
Again, these results were mirrored by the effects of experience: no differences were found
in the number of cards handed out by experienced referees compared to less experienced
Height increases authority in professional refereeing

referees. A possible explanation for the finding that both stature and experience are related
to the number of fouls but not the number of cards, is that there may simply be too little
variation in the number of cards given and hence the possibility to find an effect of height
and experience may be reduced. Additionally, perhaps interrupting the game by calling a
foul is a more subjective decision than the decision of whether or not a player deserves a
card, for which there may be more strict guidelines (FIFA, 2010). In conclusion, the most
likely explanation for why taller (or more experienced) referees give less fouls, is that due
to the authority a tall (or experienced) referee induces, he can increase the "flow" of the
game.
The present study does not address the process underlying the association between
height and authority. It could arise as a consequence of the association between height and
actual ability of the referees. Previous studies have proposed several hypotheses explaining
this association, including the positive relationship between height and cognitive ability
(explained by common factors such as genes or nutrition; Silventoinen, Posthuma, van
Beijsterveldt, Bartels and Boomsma, 2006), health (Silventoinen, Lahelma and Rahkonen,
1999), participation in social activities in young adulthood (Persico, Postlewaite and
Silverman, 2004), and self-esteem (Judge and Cable, 2004). The association between
height and authority in referees may also be a consequence of the perception of the referees
by others. Taller people may be perceived as more competent, authoritative, or dominant
(Judge and Cable, 2004; Marsh et al., 2009; Young and French, 1996). Further research is
necessary to determine the causal pathways through which height induces (perceived)
authority across different settings.
The higher perceived competence of taller men (Judge and Cable, 2004; Young and
French, 1996) is likely to lead to discrimination against shorter men. Cinnirella and Winter
(2009) showed that in the labor market employer discrimination with respect to height was
likely as height was positively related to income in employees (i.e. subordinate to their
employers) and, in contrast, this relationship was not found in self-employed workers (i.e.
who have no manager above them and hence are not at risk of discrimination). The finding
that taller referees were assigned to higher quality matches could be a consequence of a
similar type of discrimination. When actual competence is not related to height and our
subconscious biases act to discriminate against short individuals, society should consider
policies to guard against this form of discrimination.
