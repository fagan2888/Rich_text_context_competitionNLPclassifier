Introduction
Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is a serious
global public health problem. It is estimated that 2
billion people worldwide have been infected with
HBV, and 240 million people are chronically
infected with HBV. People who are chronically
infected with HBV are at an increased risk of devel-
oping hepatic cirrhosis, hepatic decompensation,
and hepatocellular carcinoma [Sarin et al. 2016].
The prevalence of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
(NAFLD) has increased recently. NAFLD is a dis-
ease that comprises a wide spectrum of liver dam-
age, including simple steatosis, steatohepatitis,
fibrosis and cirrhosis. NAFLD is now the most
common liver disorder in Western countries,
affecting between 17% and 46% of adults in 2016
[EASL-EASD-EASO, 2016]. Patients with
NAFLD have an increased mortality from both
liver-related and non-liver-related disease when
compared with the general population [Levene
and Goldin, 2012]. There are patients who have
concurrent chronic hepatitis B (CHB) virus infec-
tion and NAFLD, which can cause a clinical
dilemma regarding different clinical management
for these two conditions. Therefore, the early diag-
nosis and appropriate management of hepatic stea-
tosis in patients with CHB is important. However,
at present, studies on the clinical characteristics

Abstract
Objective: The objective of this study was to develop a noninvasive diagnostic test for
nonalcoholic hepatic steatosis in patients with chronic hepatitis B (CHB) by using routinely
available clinical markers.
Methods: A retrospective study of patients with CHB, with or without hepatic steatosis
(fatty change) who were diagnosed with controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) measured
by transient elastography were included. Patient information was analyzed on lifestyle;
laboratory tests, including serum lipid levels; blood pressure; blood uric acid; and medical
history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM).
Results: A total of 1312 patients were included in the study; 618 patients had confirmed
hepatic steatosis. The CAP levels were significantly correlated with patient height (p < 0.001),
weight (p < 0.001), waistline measurement (p < 0.001), hipline measurement (p < 0.001), and
diastolic blood pressure (DBP) (p < 0.001). Multivariate logistic regression analysis resulted
in the development of an equation for the diagnostic of simple steatosis: the fatty liver (FL)
test. The area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve of the FL test was
0.79 (p < 0.001) in the training group and 0.82 in the validation group. When the FL test was
>-0.425, the sensitivity, specificity, positive likelihood ratio (LR) and negative LR were 74.72%,
72.12%, 2.68, and 0.35 respectively. The average FL test result was -0.54 ± 1.26 in patients
with CHB without hypertension, and 0.42 ± 1.35, 1.12 ± 1.65, and 1.98 ± 1.22 in patients with
hypertension grade 1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < 0.001).
Conclusion: This study has demonstrated a noninvasive test for hepatic steatosis in
patients with CHB.

and diagnosis of NAFLD in patients with CHB
remain uncommon.
Liver biopsy is still regarded as the `gold stand-
ard' for assessing hepatic steatosis. However, the
invasive nature of the process of liver biopsy
brings about a risk of complications in 0.5% of
cases, and mortality of about 0.05% [Lok and
McMahon, 2009; Peng et al. 2016]. It is impor-
tant to develop methods for quantifying hepatic
steatosis in a noninvasive way.
Liver ultrasound (US) is the most commonly used
noninvasive imaging diagnostic tool to assess
hepatic steatosis. A recent study has demonstrated
that hepatic ultrasound has a high sensitivity and
specificity for evaluating hepatic steatosis when
hepatic fat content is >20% [Dasarathy et al.
2009]. For those patients with liver steatosis
<20%, hepatic ultrasound may not be effective
for clinical use. The controlled attenuation param-
eter (CAP) measured by transient elastography
was recently introduced as a promising noninva-
sive quantitative test for measuring hepatic steato-
sis [de Ledinghen et al. 2014; Sasso et al. 2010,
2012]. CAP can be used to assess hepatic steatosis
when hepatic fat content is at least 5% [Masaki
et al. 2013]. Recent studies have confirmed that
CAP is well correlated with the grade of hepatic
steatosis when confirmed by histological grading,
as well as hepatic steatosis assessed by hepatic
ultrasound [de Ledinghen et al. 2014; Sasso et al.
2010]. However, due to the practical difficulty of
performing the transient elastography assessment,
and the lack of skilled operators, CAP measured
by transient elastography has not been widely
implemented clinically. A simple, economical,
and effective diagnostic model would be valued,
especially in low-income countries.
Therefore, the purpose of this study is to develop a
noninvasive diagnostic test for nonalcoholic hepatic
steatosis in patients with CHB by using routinely
available clinical markers. Demographic and clini-
cal parameters were compared in patients with
CHB (control group) and in patients with concom-
itant CHB and hepatic steatosis (steatosis group).
Methods
Patients studied and clinical parameters
From June 2013 to January 2016, a retrospective
study of data from 1312 patients with CHB from
the First Affiliated Hospital, Xiamen University,
were included and analyzed. The Institutional
Review Board of First Affiliated Hospital, Xiamen
University approved the study. Each enrolled
patient provided informed consent.
The clinical data obtained were allocated to two
phases, in sequential chronological order (Figure
1). CHB was defined as the presence of seroposi-
tivity for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) for more
than 6 months with persistent or repetitive ala-
nine aminotransferase (ALT) elevation [Sarin
et al. 2016].
The 1312 patients included in the study were
diagnosed with chronic active HBV infection
and with documented persistent or repetitive
elevation of ALT (113.83 ± 82.79 U/L). The
mean serum HBV DNA viral load was 7.19 ±
1.61 log10
IU/ml. Among the patients studied,
844 of 1312 patients (64.33%) were under anti-
viral treatment (331 patients received entecavir
treatment; 143 received telbivudine; 171
received adefovir; 86 received lamivudine treat-
ment; and 113 received combination treatment)
at the time of the end of the study.
According to the histological scoring system
designed by the Nonalcoholic Steatohepatitis
Clinical Research Network of United States, sim-
ple steatosis was defined as hepatic steatosis 
5% of hepatocytes [Kleiner et al. 2005]. The
CHB patients included in the study were diag-
nosed with simple hepatic steatosis when they
had fatty liver (FL) with a CAP value >232.5
dB/m, according to the previously reported rec-
ommendations [Masaki et al. 2013].
In the patients studied, metabolic syndrome was
defined as the cluster of any three of the following
five clinical features: impaired fasting glucose or
type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM); hypertriglyceri-
demia; low high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol;
increased waist circumference; and high blood
pressure. Hypertension was defined, according
the 2013 European Society of Hypertension/
European Society of Cardiology guidelines for the
management of arterial hypertension, as an office
sitting systolic blood pressure (SBP) of 140
mmHg and/or office diastolic blood pressure
(DBP)  90 mmHg, measured by a mercury
sphygmomanometer [Mancia et al. 2014].
According to current guidelines, for the diagnosis
of hypertension, patients were divided into the
H Ou, S Cai et al.
http://tag.sagepub.com 209
following four groups. The normal group: SBP
<139 mmHg and/or DBP <89 mmHg; Grade 1
hypertension group: SBP 140­159 mmHg and/or
DBP 90­99 mmHg; Grade 2 hypertension group:
SBP 160­179 mmHg and/or DBP 100­109
mmHg; Grade 3 hypertension group: SBP 180
mmHg and/or DBP 110 mmHg.
Patients identified with medical evidence of coin-
fection with hepatitis C or hepatitis D virus or
HIV, and heavy alcohol abuse (>30 g/day) were
excluded from the study [EASL, 2012].
CAP measured by transient elastography
The CAP value was assessed using transient elas-
tography (Echosens, Paris, France) by a profes-
sionally trained technician according to the
manufacturer's handbook [Castera et al. 2010].
Briefly, the operation was performed on the right
lobe of the liver through intercostal spaces on
subjects lying in the decubitus position with the
right arm in the abduction. Ultrasonic attenua-
tion was measured at 3.5 MHz using signals
assessed by transient elastography. The median
CAP value was expressed in units of the decibel
per meter (dB/m). A CAP value was considered
reliable with both interrogative range/median
<0.3 and success rate >60%.
At the time of transient elastography, patient
information on lifestyle, including alcohol con-
sumption and smoking, was collected and ana-
lyzed. Laboratory tests, including levels of serum
lipids, and blood uric acid were assessed, accord-
ing to standard procedures and the results per-
formed within 14 days of transient elastography,
by automated techniques, were also collected.
HBV serological markers were determined using
a commercially available radioimmunoassay
(ARCHITECT i2000SR, Abbott Laboratories).
Serum HBV DNA levels were measured using
real-time polymerase chain reaction quantifica-
tion. Blood pressure was measured twice at rest in
a sitting position, spaced 2­5 min apart, and the
mean of two values was used in the analysis. The
medical history of T2DM, demographic data
including age, height, weight, waistline, and hip-
line were measured and recorded.
Statistical analysis
The measurement units were expressed as mean
± SD for normally distributed data and median

(range) for data showing non-normal distribu-
tion. Categorical data was expressed as a percent-
age. Paired t-test and Pearson correlation analysis
were used to compare the differences, when
appropriate. The area under the receiver operat-
ing characteristic (AUROC) curve and logistic
regression were calculated. Sensitivity, specificity,
and likelihood ratio (LR) were applied. All analy-
ses were performed using SPSS (version 13.0)
with an alpha level of 0.05.
Results
Baseline demographics and clinical
characteristics
A total of 1312 patients with CHB infection were
included in the study. Of these patients, 618 CHB
patients were diagnosed with simple hepatic stea-
tosis with a CAP value >232.5 dB/m and 694
CHB patients without hepatic steatosis. The
height, weight, waistline, and hipline measure-
ments of the steatosis group were significantly dif-
ferent from those of the control group: height:
166.31 ± 7.65 versus 164.91 ± 8.96 cm,
p = 0.003; weight: 70.23 ± 12.31 versus 59.53 ±
9.63 kg p < 0.001; waistline measurement: 86.45
± 9.51 versus 75.95 ± 9.45 cm, p < 0.001; hipline
measurement: 94.35 ± 7.26 versus 89.37 ± 6.19
cm, p < 0.001). Blood pressure in the steatosis
group was significantly higher than in the control
group: SBP: 129.54 ± 13.72 versus 124.41 ±
12.74 mmHg; DBP: 83.39 ± 9.74 versus 79.09 ±
8.89 mmHg, p < 0.001. The mean CAP value in
the steatosis group was 281.36 ± 36.59 dB/m,
higher than in the control group with 191.09 ±
30.91 dB/m (p < 0.001), as shown in Table 1.
Analysis of demographic characteristics as a
predictor of simple hepatic steatosis
The CAP levels of 1312 patients were signifi-
cantly correlated with height (r = 0.107,
p < 0.001), weight (r = 0.515, p < 0.001), waist-
line measurement (r = 0.530, p < 0.001), hipline
measurement (r = 0.392, p < 0.001) and blood
pressure (SBP: r = 0.218, p < 0.001; DBP:
r = 0.253, p < 0.001).
A study of the relationships between the demo-
graphic characteristics and hepatic steatosis in the
training group who were included between June
2013 and September 2014 (n = 669) used a mul-
tivariate logistic regression analysis designed to
aid in the prediction of hepatic steatosis >5%
(Table 2). The gender (odds ratio = 2.209, p =
0.001), weight (odds ratio = 1.057, p < 0.001),
waistline measurement (odds ratio = 1.071, p <
0.001) and DBP (odds ratio = 1.023, p = 0.019)
were predictors for diagnosis of simple hepatic
steatosis. Therefore, an equation was established
for the diagnostic of simple steatosis: the FL test
= -12.367 + 0.023*DBP + 0.792(*2 if female)
+ 0.055*weight + 0.069*waistline.
In order to confirm the diagnostic feasibility of
this equation, we used the AUROC curve to
examine whether the FL test could be used as an
indicator for the diagnosis of simple hepatic stea-
tosis. The AUROC was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.758­
0.827, p < 0.001), higher than the other
predictors. When the FL test was >-0.425, the
sensitivity, specificity, +LR, and ­LR for predict-
ing patients with simple steatosis were 74.72%,
72.12%, 2.68, and 0.35 respectively, as shown in
Figure 2.
To validate the FL test in the diagnosis of simple
steatosis in patients with CHB, the parameters
estimated from the training group were used to
predict the probability of being diagnosed with
simple steatosis for the independent validation
group (n = 643). Similarly, the predicted prob-
ability was used to construct the ROC curve.
The AUROC was 0.82 (95% CI: 0.788­0.853,
p < 0.001), higher than the other demographics
characteristics, as shown in Figure 3.
The relationship of the demographics
characteristics and the FL test
To verify the reliability of the FL test, we ana-
lyzed the demographic characteristics and life-
style of patients against the score from the FL
test. The Pearson correlation showed that the
CAP value (r = 0.576, p < 0.001; Figure 4), SBP
(r = 0.385, p < 0.001), DBP (r = 0.402, p <
0.001), height (r = 0.236, p < 0.001), weight
(r = 0.881, p < 0.001), waistline measurement (r
= 0.939, p < 0.001), and hipline measurement
(r = 0.774, p < 0.001) were well correlated with
the FL test. In addition, there were 219 patients
(16.7%) with a diagnosis of metabolic syndrome
among the CHB patients; the FL test value was
0.54 ± 1.47 versus -0.54 ± 1.24 (p < 0.001).
The FL test value was also significantly different
in patients of a different subgroup. The FL test
value was 0.06 ± 1.46 in patients with

hyperlipidemia, which was significantly higher
than that for other patients with -0.44 ± 1.30
(p < 0.001). Similar trends were observed in
patients with type 2 diabetes versus non-
diabetics (0.23 ± 1.47 versus -0.43 ± 1.31, p <
0.001), hypertension versus non-hypertension

and alcohol consumption positive versus no alco-

When we grouped the patients with an FL test
>-0.425, the number of patients with FL test
>-0.425 diagnosed with hyperlipidemia, hyper-
tension, diabetes, hyperuricemia, or alcohol con-
sumption was significantly greater than the
corresponding patients with an FL test  -0.425,
as shown in Table 3.
Additionally, we found that the FL test could
effectively distinguish between the different
grades of hypertension (Figure 6). The average
FL test was -0.54 ± 1.26 in patients without
hypertension, and 0.42 ± 1.35, 1.12 ± 1.65, and
1.98 ± 1.22 in patients with hypertension Grades
1, 2, and 3, respectively (p < 0.001).
Discussion
The results of this study show that the FL test, a
noninvasive diagnostic model, based on the CAP
measured by transient elastography, could pre-
dict hepatic steatosis in patients with CHB. The
FL could be developed as a diagnostic test of sim-
ple steatosis in CHB patients who refuse liver
biopsy or in whom liver biopsy is contraindicated.
The study findings support the argument that the
FL test could be important for clinical practition-
ers in countries with limited medical resources
and funding.
There are now many reports on the prevalence of
the coexistence of NAFLD with CHB. In a study
in China, 891 CHB patients were compared to
922 healthy people, and the prevalence of NAFLD
in CHB patients was 13.5% compared with 28.3%
in the control group [Wong et al. 2012]. Another
study, reported by Bondini and colleagues
[Bondini et al. 2007] showed that NAFLD was
observed in 19% of patients with CHB, with a
Figure 2. ROC curve when using FL test and other characteristics for diagnosis NAFLD. We used AUROC to
examine the use of the FL test as an indicator for diagnosis of NAFLD. The AUROC was 0.79 (95% CI: 0.758­
0.827, p < 0.001), higher than the other predictors. When the FL test was >­0.425, the sensitivity, specificity,
+LR, and ­LR to predict patients with NAFLD were 74.72%, 72.12%, 2.68, and 0.35 respectively.

similar finding reported by Thomopoulos and col-
leagues [Thomopoulos et al. 2006].
In this study, we found that 618 patients were
diagnosed with simple steatosis, from 1312
patients with CHB. The cut-off value for the
CAP measurement was set at 232.5 with a sen-
sitivity value of 87.0% and a specificity value of
77.2% [Masaki et al. 2013]. The prevalence of
NAFLD in this study was similar to that in the
general population as reported by the clinical
practice guidelines for the management of
NAFLD [EASL-EASD-EASO, 2016]. Perhaps,
unlike hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection, the
CHB virus infection did not have a significant
impact on hepatic steatosis. For most CHB
patients, the presence of NAFLD may be
caused by an unhealthy lifestyle. However,
larger studies are required to investigate this
association further.
Current guidelines recommend that the treat-
ment of patients with CHB should commence if
they have persistently elevated ALT levels, at
more than twice the upper limit of normal [Sarin
et al. 2016]. However, an abnormal ALT level is
often observed in patients with hepatic steatosis;
the raised ALT level from HBV-infected patients

than the other predictors.

who also have hepatic steatosis may not be caused
by HBV infection alone. A marker such as serum
HBV DNA level may not reflect antiviral response
[Cai et al. 2014]. Similarly, inappropriate antivi-
ral treatment with HBV associated with non-
alcohol steatohepatitis (NASH) brings the risk of
HBV drug resistance and increases the economic
burden of treatment, which may also influence
the treatment adherence of CHB patients [Peng
et al. 2015]. However, lack of antiviral treatment
in patients with CHB because the physicians mis-
takenly believe that elevated ALT was due to
NASH carries the risk of progressive liver fibrosis
and risk of hepatocellular carcinoma. Therefore,
a noninvasive diagnostic model for hepatic steato-
sis, such as the FL test would be of value as an
assessment for patients infected with HBV, espe-
cially before the antiviral treatment.

were observed in patients with diabetes versus non-diabetes (0.23 ± 1.47 versus -0.43 ± 1.31, p < 0.001),
hypertension versus non-hypertension (0.39 ± 1.36 versus -0.59 ± 1.26, p < 0.001), hyperuricemia versus non-
hyperuricemia (-0.001 ± 1.43 versus -0.44 ± 1.31, p < 0.001) and alcohol consumption positive versus negative
(0.12 ± 1.40 versus -0.49 ± 1.29, p < 0.001).

A study by Jin and colleagues [Jin et al. 2012],
found that, in patients with CHB, the presence of
FL was an independent risk factor for clinical out-
come following entecavir treatment. Another study,
reported by Ates and colleagues [Ates et al. 2011],
of 84 patients with CHB who received interferon
treatment, the sustained virological response
showed no difference between patients who had
hepatic steatosis and those who did not, although
there was a trend towards a poorer response in the
hepatic steatosis patients. In 2012, Shi and col-
leagues [Shi et al. 2012] observed a similar result,
and reported that there was no significant differ-
ence in HBeAg seroconversion and virological
response rate in patients with or without NAFLD.
Studies have reported that high baseline ALT lev-
els result in improved clinical outcomes after anti-
viral treatment [Cai et al. 2016; Liaw et al. 2009].
Whether CHB associated with NASH is also
associated with increased ALT levels at baseline,
and is an indicator of better clinical outcome, is as
yet unknown. Liver steatosis has been shown to
be associated with an unfavorable response to
treatment with interferon and ribavirin in patients
with HCV [Poynard et al. 2003]. For patients
with CHB, diet and lifestyle changes may be
recommended.
NAFLD had been shown to be associated with
insulin resistance in the liver, muscle, and adipose
tissues [Gaggini et al. 2013], and with metabolic
syndrome, [Alberti et al. 2005], which is sup-
portedbythefindingsofthisstudy.Cardiovascular
disease is a common cause of death in patients
with NAFLD [Targher et al. 2010], which raised
the possibility that the FL test from our study
could be developed as a method for risk stratifica-
tion for patients with CHB who may develop car-
diovascular disease.
It is important to mention that previous studies
have described the use of the FL index and the
FL algorithm as predictors of hepatic steatosis,
based on liver ultrasound [Bedogni et al. 2006;
Lin et al. 2011]. When the cut-off value of the FL
index was set as 50, the sensitivity was 70%,
and the specificity was 80% [Bedogni et al. 2006;
Lin et al. 2011]. However, these previous studies
were undertaken in the general population, and
patients infected with HBV were excluded
[Bedogni et al. 2006; Lin et al. 2011]. The FL
index has not been investigated in patients with
CHB. Liver ultrasound has a limited sensitivity
and specificity for the evaluation of hepatic stea-
tosis when hepatic fat content is >20% [Dasarathy
et al. 2009]. For those patients with hepatic stea-
tosis <20%, liver ultrasound may not be effective,
whereas CAP can be used to assess hepatic stea-
tosis when the hepatic fat content is 5% or more
[Masaki et al. 2013].
Although this preliminary study is one of the first
to evaluate the FL test in patients with CHB, it
has limitations. The study was retrospective in a
single center, performed by clinicians from the
same center. The small study size and the poten-
tial for study bias could be overcome in future
studies with the use of multiple centers, possibly
in several regions and countries. The FL test
could also be validated using patients who have
also had liver biopsies and a histological quantifi-
cation of hepatic fat.
In conclusion, this study has demonstrated a
noninvasive test for hepatic steatosis in patients
with CHB infection. The findings of this study
have supported the potential use for CAP value
in the diagnosis of hepatic steatosis, as a sensi-
tive and specific noninvasive test. However, it is
important to stress that the findings of this pre-
liminary study should be taken further and sup-
ported by larger, controlled, multicenter studies
in patients with NAFLD with and without CHB
virus infection.
Figure 6. FL test can effectively distinguish between
the different grades of hypertension. The average
FL test was -0.54 ± 1.26 among patients without
hypertension, and 0.42 ± 1.35, 1.12 ± 1.65, and 1.98
± 1.22 among patients with hypertension grades 1, 2,
and 3 (p < 0.001).
FL, fatty liver.
